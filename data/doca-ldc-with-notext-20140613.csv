A judge today ordered Tawana Brawley's mother jailed for 30 days and fined $250 for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating her daughter's assertion that she was abducted and raped in a racially motivated assault last November. In imposing the maximum penalty, the judge, Angelo J. Ingrassia of State Supreme Court, said he had ''no other alternative'' after the mother, Glenda Brawley, failed to appear in court to explain her actions and after her lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason, offered no legal basis for her defiance of the subpoena. Abrams Asks for Delay The special prosecutor in the case, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, said after the hearing that he had asked the Dutchess County Sheriff's office to delay arresting Mrs. Brawley until Wednesday, when the grand jury holds its next session. This would give her time to reconsider her actions, he said, and avoid the court-imposed penalty by testifying. Mr. Abrams said he would ask Justice Ingrassia to have the mother of the black Dutchess County teen-ager brought before him before she is taken to jail so that ''he can fully indicate what lies before her.'' He also criticized her lawyers as having given their client ''reprehensible and irresponsible'' advice and having ''utterly failed to offer a defense.'' At one point Mr. Maddox indicated to the judge that Mrs. Brawley had been outside the courthouse with her supporters but had not come into the courtroom because ''she knew the outcome'' would be ''injustice.'' Mrs. Brawley spent much of the afternoon sitting in a car parked outside the courthouse. As Justice Ingrassia was ruling, Mr. Maddox grabbed his legal papers and was halfway down the aisle to the exit. Mr. Mason remained seated at the lawyers' table and was heard muttering: ''This is outrageous. They're winning. This case is over as far as they're concerned.'' The lawyers left the courthouse, where several hundred supporters, chanting but orderly, had gathered on the street outside during the three-hour hearing that began at 2 P.M. The lawyers made no comment, nor did they indicate if they planned to appeal. Justice Ingrassia also quashed subpoenas issued by the Brawley lawyers to, among others, Governor Cuomo, Mr. Abrams and The New York Times. In failing to appear before the grand jury on May 24, Mrs. Brawley defied the state's first attempt to compel testimony from a member of her family. Mr. Abrams, appointed by Governor Cuomo to serve as the special prosecutor, has unsuccessfully sought Tawana Brawley's voluntary cooperation. She and her family stopped cooperating with investigators last fall after giving fragmentary accounts of what they contend was an attack on Miss Brawley, now 16 years old, by up to six white men, one of whom carried a police-like badge. In the months since, the Brawley lawyers have publicly accused several whites in the case and have accused local, state and Federal investigators of a cover-up. They have also called both the Governor and the Attorney General racists and have asserted involvement in the case by the Irish Republican Army, the Ku Klux Klan and the Mafia. Law-enforcement authorities have said they could find no evidence to support Miss Brawley's account, and the F.B.I. has all but withdrawn from the investigation. The action by Justice Ingrassia represented the state's strongest action to date in its efforts to discover what actually happened to Miss Brawley during her four-day disappearance. But Mrs. Brawley's continuing defiance could provide the state with an excuse to drop an investigation that has been exasperating as well as expensive. Lawyers Sharply Criticized ''We may well be at that point of time, if we have no cooperation, that this investigation may have to wind itself down,'' Mr. Abrams said today. The Attorney General said he would consider routes to have the lawyers disciplined, but he did not elaborate. The judge's order came after several hours of testy arguments by Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason, which were more political and social history than legal in nature and were laced with sarcasm and disdain for the proceedings. ''I don't think we should be wasting each other's time,'' Mr. Maddox told the judge. Justice Ingrassia agreed and invited the lawyers to offer some legal basis for Mrs. Brawley's absence from the courtroom and defiance of the subpoena last month. When they did not, the judge said, ''You're tying my hands.'' Air of Expectancy While it had not been clear what would take place today, there was an air of expectancy as scores of journalists and other spectators lined up in a broiling sun to jockey for the 100 seats available in the courtroom. Many of those who showed up had come in response to subpoenas issued last week by Mr. Maddox. The lawyers for Mrs. Brawley had promised their supporters that they would transform the contempt hearing into a trial of the State of New York. They promised to demonstrate that blacks could not obtain justice in the state, and among the witnesses they said they would call were the families of men and women who had been killed in encounters with the police. Hundreds of people could not get into the courtroom, the largest in the courthouse. Among them was the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, whom the Brawley lawyers have recruited in their attempt to create a black political movement. 'First Come Basis' Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason charged that court officials had deliberately denied access to most of the 300 supporters they brought up in buses from New York City. The judge, however, said he had ordered that 40 to 50 seats be set aside for journalists and the remainder to be filled ''on a first come basis.'' Early in the proceedings, there was a fleeting moment of hope that, after more than six months, Tawana Brawley's account would be given when Mr. Maddox told the judge, ''I can find no better place than here for us to lay out the entire story.'' But it soon became clear that this would be unlikely as the lawyers raised objections to everything from Justice Ingrassia's hearing the case to media coverage to the lack of seats in the courtroom for any but a few of the supporters they brought with them to Poughkeepsie. It seemed at times that they were even daring the judge to hold Mrs. Brawley in contempt. '400 Years of Oppression' ''I ask you to search your heart, mind and soul,'' Mr. Maddox told the judge in asking him to step down from the case, ''because 400 years of oppression is riding on this case and we have reached a point where African-Americans in this country, and particularly African-Americans residing in New York, are thoroughly disgusted with the way justice is administered and are thoroughly disgusted at being told by grand juries that they are hallucinating and what they said happened to them is a hoax.'' The judge replied: ''That last part of your statement about 400 years of oppression is very moving. There is a great deal of truth in it. There's a great deal of right in it if you want to put it that way.'' But the judge refused to step down, saying he felt he could render a fair and impartial decision. As the afternoon wore on, Justice Ingrassia asked Mr. Maddox if he wanted the case decided on the basis of the legal papers before him or whether he could offer ''any factual issues'' that could spare Mrs. Brawley a criminal contempt citation. 'A Lot of Factual Issues' Mr. Maddox replied: ''I really don't think it's necessary. There's a lot of factual issues, but I don't think it's going to do any good here.'' He later added that ''I don't believe that Glenda Brawley has a snowball's chance in hell of getting justice in New York.'' To that, Justice Ingrassia said, ''Even if you are correct, that still doesn't give her the right to defy the lawful mandate of this court, does it?'' ''Is it your defense to this case that black people cannot receive justice?'' the judge asked Mr. Maddox. Mr. Maddox said yes. Finally, the judge said he ''had no problem'' with ruling from the bench. He found that Mrs. Brawley ''has had ample opportunity to appear.'' After the hearing, in a news conference in the courthouse lobby, Mr. Abrams said: ''I'm of a firm opinion that she was poorly represented today. Her interests were not served. ''Glenda Brawley received reprehensible and irresponsible advice. Her lawyers utterly failed to offer a defense. They offered no defense. I point the finger of blame at them. I'm urging her to try and purge this contempt and not spend time in jail.'' 'Something Mysterious' Asked whether he thought Mr. Mason and Mr. Maddox were challenging the judge to make a martyr of Mrs. Brawley, Mr. Abrams replied: ''We all saw that something mysterious happened at the end - a desire by the lawyers to get out of the courtroom. I'm of a firm opinion she was poorly represented today. The judge time and time again asked for more information. The judge wanted very much to hear arguments with respect to defense and reasons as to why Mrs. Brawley should not have to answer her subpoena.'' When asked how he could expect Mrs. Brawley to change her mind and come before the grand jury after all this time, Mr. Abrams responded: ''Going to jail is a searing thing in life. When the moment of truth comes, when the judge is there, a person's mind can be altered to make an informed opinion.'' On Mr. Maddox's and Mr. Mason's assertion that blacks cannot receive fair treatment in the courts, Mr. Abrams said: ''I think it is clear that we have had racism rear its ugly head in this nation. We must continue to fight for reforms and have the door of opportunity swing ever wider. But don't abandon and abdicate your client and allow your client to face the prospect of jail. You take other steps. You argue vigorously, forcefully for your client. You seek to have the client there so the judge can look into the client's eyes and see a real human being.'' March Is Organized When Mr. Mason and Mr. Maddox left the courthouse, they were met by supporters of the Brawleys. A chaotic scene ensued. The two lawyers caucused in the middle of Market Street before quickly organizing a march down the street. The crowd chanted, ''No justice, no peace,'' and ''Free the land,'' and scores of reporters and camera crews gave chase. The march stopped just two blocks down, near Church Street, in front of the Social Services Department's building, where a dozen state troopers were positioned. The crowd milled and continued chanting, creating an angry atmosphere. Dozens of state troopers were positioned in the armory building across the street in case any violence erupted, but no confrontation took place. Once, when one of the supporters shoved a television microphone out of Mr. Mason's face, the lawyer, apparently not wanting to cause an incident, said, ''Don't do that.''",1988/06/07/0151963.xml,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,710,19830,J.
