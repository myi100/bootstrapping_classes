THE THORNY AND MAGNIFICENT MAX REGER
LEAD: RECORDINGS THAT EXPLORE byways of the classical repertory can often prove more stimulating and satisfying than repeated versions of the familiar.

There are qualified options, so-called because they ''qualified'' for tax-favored status.

ETHICS PANEL IS TREADING QUIETLY
LEAD: THE first meeting of Governor Cuomo's Commission on Government Integrity took place in New York City last week almost unnoticed.
In part this may have reflected the unassuming personality of its new chairman, John D. Feerick, the dean of the Fordham University School of Law.

LEAD: When his name was announced as he went to the plate in the 10th inning with the bases loaded, many of the 37,235 spectators tried to boo him.

But Gaelic is taking it a bit far.


DECORATIVE WORKS TO J.P. MORGAN'S TASTE
LEAD: J. PIERPONT MORGAN, COLLEC-tor'' at the Morgan Library is something quite new for the Library.
By definition, a library is concerned with two-dimensional objects -books, manuscripts, autograph letters, musical scores, drawings, prints and stage designs.
Almost all of the Morgan Library's exhibitions have had that character.


Golf; FOCUS ON BLACKWELDER, EXPECTING CHILD IN JUNE
LEAD: Jan Stephenson and Cindy Hill both birdied the 18th hole to take a one-shot lead today after three rounds of the S&amp;H Classic.

Page 1  The U.S. role in the contra war has been marked by contradictions and questions since President Reagan approved support for the rebel forces six years ago, officials said.


WHEN THE DOLLAR FINALLY HITS BOTTOM
LEAD: THE dollar has fallen more than 40 percent over the last two years, and some investment strategists think it could soon hit bottom.
If so, investors should consider changing the strategies they used while the dollar was heading down.


BIDDING ADIEU TO THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE
LEAD: THERE WAS A TIME WHEN GOING TO THE movies let us sink into solitude, when the archetypes of ideal women were before us in all their vast simplicity, as aloof as goddesses, nine feet high.
They represented what we wished we were or thought we were, would like to be, ought to be, ought not to be.


SOFT COVERS FOR CHILDREN
LEAD: NOW that publishers are printing their best children's books in their own paperback editions, brows are knitting as serious trend watchers ask what it all means.
Will paying one-third the hardback price deprive a child of two-thirds of the book's literary experience?
Is the only real book a hard-cover book?


U.S. Barring a Prize-Winning Vietnamese Pianist
LEAD: Not all those in Moscow who are being denied the right to travel abroad are victims of Soviet restrictions.

SOVIET MONITORING OF PHONES IS CITED
LEAD: The Soviet Union maintains an elaborate system for eavesdropping on sensitive United States Government communications from Soviet-bloc embassies here, according to intelligence authorities.


Educating for Freedom
LEAD: Normally we don't pay much attention to teachers.
We expect them to educate our children and practically to raise them by protecting them from drugs, crime and sexual disease, all for a lot less than we pay plumbers.
From time to time, when they slip a bit in their police functions, we yell at them but we don't actually try to find out what is on their minds.


Streetscapes: The Samuel R. Smith Infirmary; 'Pride of the Island' Facing an Uncertain Future
LEAD: DESPITE its size and prominence, the Samuel R. Smith Infirmary - a great red-brick Victorian castle in New Brighton, S.I. - is a building that has fallen through the cracks.


POLITICIANS AND POWER SHORTAGES
LEAD: I wish to protest negative reporting re the shortage of electric power on Long Island  [ ''Lilco Sounds Sharp Alarm on Power,'' April 12 ] .

More Nonexistent Classics
LEAD:  To the Editor:


A CORRECTION

Detached single-family houses sell for up to $700,000; brownstones range in price from $200,000 to $500,000.


WHAT'S DOING IN: TEL AVIV
LEAD: In an increasingly polarized Israel, Jerusalem rightly remains the hilly bastion of spirituality, while Tel Aviv, only 50 minutes away by car, is fiercely secular, Mediterranean and dedicated to fun.
Mount Zion may fulminate about the cities of the plain, but as the country's largest urban center (1.2 million with the suburbs), Tel Aviv revels in being


A LESSON FROM PAPA
LEAD: In their book, ''The Classic Touch: Lessons in Leadership from Homer to Hemingway,'' to be published this month by Dow Jones-Irwin, John K. Clemens and Douglas F. Mayer reconsider the great works of literature in search of lessons for modern executives.

Highway Horrors
LEAD: A highway engineer has come up with a way to quantify the severity of traffic jams.

LEAD: Scores of anti-abortion protesters demonstrated this morning at a women's clinic that performs abortions, and 75 to 80 people were arrested, the police said.
The demonstration at the Northside Women's Clinic in this Atlanta suburb was part of a day of protests planned in the region by anti-abortion advocates.


FEW WELCOME MATS OUT FOR WALDHEIM IN EUROPE
LEAD: THERE are too many living ghosts of the Nazi past around for any European nation to feel that the case of Kurt Waldheim is simply an isolated Austrian matter.
This month France warily confronts the trial of Klaus Barbie, the erstwhile Gestapo chief in Lyons; his lawyer has vowed to expose alleged betrayals by the French resistance and even of the French Jewish community during World War II.


IN THE BALDWIN TRADITION
LEAD: BILLY BALDWIN'S IN-teriors - those crisp-lined rooms that epitomized elegance and sophistication from the 1950's through the early 70's - had such a powerful effect on design that his name became synonymous with American style.
Popularly referred to as the dean of decorators, Baldwin, who died in 1983, has been an inspiration to old-guard designers for as long as anyone can remember.


GLAMOUR AWARDS
LEAD: IT didn't quite have the celebrity quotient of the Academy Awards ceremony, but last week's International Center of Photography Awards Dinner in New York managed to bestow some Hollywood-style glamour on the field.
The I.C.P. awards were the third installment of a program to honor outstanding talents in the field.


THE HUMBLING OF BANKAMERICA
LEAD: The building dominates the San Francisco skyline, not only by its 52-story height but also by its bulk: a monolith rising without setbacks from most of a city block.

New York: George Braziller. $16.95.


National Parks
LEAD: To the Editor: As Irvin Molotsky reports in ''Pay As You Go at National Parks'' (Travel, March 29), this is just another tax.
It's repulsive in the extreme to be charged a fee to enjoy the great outdoors.
Let's hope a more enlightened administration will rescind these revolting fees.
BEN CALDERONE

LEAD: A Federal district judge has appointed an outside overseer to supervise the Veterans Administration's compensation and pension division for an indefinite period.


BLAKE EDWARDS: LAUGHS AMID THE BRICKBATS
LEAD: THE TOMATOES ARE AGAIN flying, as they always do with the advent of a new Blake Edwards film.
For a director who specializes in light farce, Mr.
Edwards certainly can generate a lot of ill humor. ''Ever been steered by a critic to a movie you ended up actively despising?'' asks Amram Whiteman of New York City, one of numerous annoyed readers.


BIG ART MUSEUM PLANNED FOR RURAL MASSACHUSETTS
LEAD: This decaying industrial city in the northwest corner of Massachusetts may soon become the site of the largest contemporary art museum in the world.

CHOOSING THE RIGHT PAINT FOR THOSE OUTSIDE JOBS
LEAD: THE homeowner who decides to repaint the outside of his house often finds that shopping for exterior paints or finishes can be confusing, because there are quite a few types from which to choose.
This is particularly true when manufacturers make conflicting or exaggerated claims, or when you are dealing with a salesman who may not be as knowledgeable as he should be.


Providing Care
LEAD:  To the Sports Editor


Talking: Admissions; A Job Can No Longer Be an Issue

According to the current definition, people infected with the virus are diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome only if they have at least one of the cancers or infections that take advantage of the body's weakened immune system.


Science Academy Rejects Harvard Political Scientist
LEAD: Since it was founded in 1863, the National Academy of Sciences has been dominated by practitioners of physics, chemistry and other sciences whose subject matter is particularly amenable to the rigors of mathematical analysis.
Human behavior is more difficult to quantify, however, and members of the so-called soft sciences - which include sociology, political science and economics - have had trouble penetrating American science's most prestigious club.


SAUCES ADD A SPICY TOUCH TO FISH DISHES
LEAD: WHILE nothing beats fresh seafood served plain, I like to experiment with different sauces.
For example, a green peppercorn and brandy sauce is superb with fish steaks such as shark, swordfish or tuna or fillets of red snapper.
A piquant ancho chili sauce is wonderful with sauteed shrimp.
And, for shad roe, which are now at the height of their season, an old-fashioned beurre noisette with capers - a sauce normally served with skate in

EVERYBODY IS EDGY AS GOETZ TRIAL OPENS
LEAD: THE trial of Bernhard H. Goetz opened last week with the same mixture of sharp contrasts in opinion and subtle legal distinction that have characterized the case since the day on the subway in December 1984 when Mr.

ACTUALLY, WE ARE ALL GETTING POORER
LEAD: FOR nearly a decade now, analysts have been saying that American income inequality is growing and that the middle class is declining.

Forums of Anti-Communism
LEAD:  To the Editor:


ARE VIEWERS ENTITLED TO GAMES ON FREE TV?
LEAD: It seems everyone is making a big fuss about the paucity of games being broadcast on free television these days.
Others may welcome the opportunity to experience a season of baseball in a new way.
Actually an old way, the way it was before picture tubes, slow-motion replays and remote controls evolved to render the fan an unthinking, lifeless lump, slouched six times a week in a recliner.


PUTTING A PINCH ON MANAGEMENT PERKS
LEAD: SHOULD companies take from the rich or give to the poor?


TRASH, AGE 140, IS A TREASURE TO ARCHEOLOGISTS IN THE VILLAGE

KINJI MORIYAMA
LEAD: Kinji Moriyama, a Member of Parliament and a former Japanese Cabinet minister, died today of heart failure after suddenly becoming ill at a resort hotel west of Tokyo.

Under a widely applauded agreement with Mr.

Roommates
LEAD: I CAME RATHER LATE to understanding myself in the cycle of life.
Until three years ago, I was a boy in relation to my grandfather.
He lived to 107 and remained mentally and physically capable until the end of his life.
A generation after the last of his friends died, he could still mow the lawn on a hot summer afternoon, and he insisted on doing so.


Q AND A
LEAD: Paris Hotels

ARISE! YOU CAN'T SLEEP ANYWAY
LEAD: I AM an insomniac. ''Me too!
Me too!'' cry 30 million bleary-eyed bedfellows from apartments, Cape Cods, bungalows, condos, mansions, igloos and lanais all over the United States.
From China, using the same population ratio, 120 million voices would be elegible to join the ''Me too!'' chorale.

NOT ALL ERRORS ARE RUN-OF-THE-MILL
LEAD: MOST errors are banal and need no explanation; they are made by grandmaster and amateur alike.
Yet every once in a while there is something intriguing about an error.
We are prompted to ask why.
Consider, for example, the game between Grandmasters Alonso Zapata of Colombia and Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland in the ninth round of the Hoogoven International Tournament in Wijk-aan-Zee, the Netherlands.

MONTANA GRAPPLES WITH HIGH WORKER INSURANCE
LEAD: When his best logger quit for a better-paying job cutting timber in California, Bruce A. Vincent felt cheated - not by the employee but by the Montana Division of Workers' Compensation. ''There was nothing we could do,'' said Mr.

KEEPING THE SHOW GOING ON
LEAD: MY favorite character in ''42d Street'' isn't Sawyer, who goes out there a kid and comes back a star; it's Marsh, the director, who turns a collapsing musical comedy into a hit.
But Maryellen Barnes of Bayside keeps Long Island musicals from any danger of collapse.


Angola Rebels Report Victory In Diamond-Producing Area
LEAD: Angolan rebels said today that they had killed 108 Government troops and 4 Cubans in a battle in the northeastern diamond-producing province of Lunda.


OLD LINEN AND LACE RETURNS IN LONDON
LEAD: Stephen Lunn, a London antiques dealer, holds up a big linen sheet, old and worn.
Not long ago it might have wound up in a trash heap.
But for a small, ardent following, this old sheet is a treasure.
Its appeal lies in the soft, smooth feel that crisp new linen lacks.
Renewed interest in antique textiles has further burnished its popularity - and its price.


Postings; High-Tech Future: Airport in Flight
LEAD: The 41-year-old private airport in Waterford, Conn., will soon disappear and be replaced by a high-tech office complex planned by the Reynolds Metals Development Corporation of Richmond, Va.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Q &amp; A
LEAD:  SALES TAX ON CO-OPS  Question: I read recently that apartment houses are among the kind of investment properties that are automatically reassessed at 45 percent of market value when sold.
Does this mean that the apartment building in which I live would be reassessed at 45 percent of value if sold to a converter or a co-op corporation?.

LEAD: ONE Brazilian, Nelson Piquet, will skip today's San Marino Grand Prix auto race in Imola, Italy, and another, Ayrton Senna, will leave from the pole position.

NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  MY TIRADE AGAINST MYSELF
At 71, Jorge Luis Borges had had such a copious literary career that he even grew a bit tired of himself.

LEAD:  To the Editor


JAZZ: THE ALTO SAX OF FRANK MORGAN
LEAD: PETER ZUMMO composes works for his orchestra that are very much in the minimalist vein, but leavens his spare material with jazzy tunes and unusual instrumentation: he plays the trombone and also employs a drummer, accordionist, cellist, clarinetist and marimba player in his ensemble, which performed Wednesday evening at the Alternative Museum.

TURNTABLES RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE CD ERA
LEAD: WITH ATTENTION concentrated on the ascendant CD, developments in conventional phonography are easily overlooked.
Yet millions of LP's, accreted over nearly four decades, still make up the bulk of the world's recorded music, and the audio industry continues to provide conventional turntables to serve the needs of listeners loyal to their older disks.


3 Sharing $9.7 Million Prize
LEAD: Two Massachusetts residents, a carpenter from Chelmsford and an operator of a messenger service in Melrose, and a resident of Connecticut won Wednesday's $9.7 million Massachusetts Megabucks jackpot.

Watching the Ball
LEAD: DICK WAGNER, the Houston Astros' president, said yesterday that A. Bartlett Giamatti, the National League president, had told him that umpires would continue to check balls for scuff marks when Mike Scott pitches for the Astros.

FICTION
LEAD:  STORIES.
By Cesare Pavese.
Translated by A. E. Murch. (Ecco, $12.95.) In 1950 the Italian novelist and poet Cesare Pavese committed suicide at the age of 41, just three months after receiving his country's highest literary prize, the Premio Strega, for his novel ''Among Women Only.'' Numerous short works of fiction were found among his papers; the present collection includes 22 examples, of varying length and quality, rather ploddingly translated by A.


Shooting Mystery In Gangland
LEAD: If it was an attempt to assassinate John Gotti, it didn't work.
The reputed Mafia chief was still alive, outside his Queens headquarters with several companions, after the noise that could have been a gunshot startled the neighborhood Wednesday afternoon.
Mr.
Gotti denied that he had been shot at, and there was no suspect for the police to arrest.


A NEW TAKE ON TYPE A
LEAD: I DROVE ALL THE WAY IN THE RIGHT-HAND lane this morning,'' says one of the senior executives proudly.
His five colleagues sitting around a conference-room tabel nod approval.
They are part of the fast track, at the San Francisco headquarters of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, but they are also determined to sample life in the slow lane.


Racing Returns to the Battery
LEAD: At the turn of the century, commercial traffic in New York Harbor forced most yacht racing to develop in Long Island Sound.

LEAD: When he resigned in March from the PTL television ministry, the Rev.
Jim Bakker hoped his exile would be brief.

What Ails Musicals; Upbeat Rock?
LEAD: To the Editor:


OPERA: COPELAND'S 'TENDER LAND'
LEAD: ''THE TENDER LAND,'' Aaron Copland's second opera, was produced in 1954, revised and revived the next year, and has been seen occasionally - mostly on college campuses - since then.
It has never really caught on, but the manifest merits evident in excerpts, workshop performances and an abbreviated recording have placed it high on the list of American works deserving re-evaluation.


Headliners; Sincere Actors
LEAD: In a refreshing departure from the usual vein of such events, none of the actors who paid tribute to Sir Alec Guinness last week appeared to be practicing his or her craft.
Instead, the ''Tribute to Alec Guinness'' by the Film Society of Lincoln Center was marked by unabashed admiration of his mastery.


U.S. Rebukes an Arms Control Aide
LEAD: As the United States and the Soviet Union seemed to be moving cautiously toward an agreement to remove their medium-range missiles from Europe, there was more contentious talk last week among officials concerned with arms control.


The Unromantic Generation
LEAD: Mr.

Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington.


RIPPING CLIO'S BODICE - THE CHRONCILE OF A SWEET SAVAGE HACK
LEAD: ON the first day of school, my junior high English teacher used to make us write essays called ''What I Did on My Vacation.'' I always invented healthy, normal activities like sailing and swimming to conceal the fact that I had spent the summer in our beach cottage pantry soaking up the fiction of Frank Yerby.

POP AND FOLK ROCKS A QUIET VILLAGE
LEAD: Eleven months of the year Roskilde is a peaceful town.
At midday church bells sound, as they have since medieval times.
Through the crisp air comes the call of a gull or a mockingbird.
And then, July rolls around.
Church bells are drowned out by the sound of applause.
The occasional sound of a strident guitar is heard across the town, as are the voices of a sing-a-long.

CROSSFIRE AT THE BAR
LEAD: Study this scene and spot the one false note.


Switzerland
LEAD: To the Editor: The discussion of the Swiss countryside (Travel, April 5), jarred some personal memories.
More than a score of years ago, my family toured Switzerland, staying for a few days in Interlaken.
My father and I walked up into the hills.
As Judith Mandelbaum-Schmid implied in ''Where Heidi Belongs,'' the Swiss mountains, even where they are not Alpine, are always Heidi-esque.


Dr. Deborah Ruiz Becomes a Bride
LEAD: Dr.
Deborah Geraldine Ruiz, an ophthalmologist, and Anthony Blenk, a director of equity investments at MONY Financial Services, were married yesterday at Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church in New York.
Msgr.
Myles M. Bourke performed the ceremony, assisted by the Rev.
Robert A. Nunn of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian


Not Ready For Prime Time?
LEAD: Describing the low-rated but superb ''Our World'' as a ''cheap news show'' does a disservice both to the intestinal fortitude it must require of ABC honchos to keep it on the air and the intelligence of the people who produce it. ''Our World'' teaches and entertains; if it is not ready for prime time, then it really doesn't matter who runs the networks.


SLIP OF THE THUMB WITH A HAPPY ENDING
LEAD: MANY American ideas are eagerly copied in other parts of the world, too eagerly for the peace of mind of some inventors and manufacturers.
But Americans are often slow to adopt new ideas that have originated elsewhere.
A minor example is the bidding box, which was invented in Sweden a quarter of a century ago and is used automatically in every small


Company With Union Trouble Gets Contract from the Navy
LEAD: The Navy has awarded a $4.1 million contract to a New Hampshire company that has been embroiled in a labor dispute for the past nine months and has become the object of a Congressional inquiry.
A Navy spokesman said Friday that the contract, awarded to the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Newington, N.H., did not alter the service's policy of labor neutrality.


THE DANCE: FENLEY'S 'MOMENTS'
LEAD: ''GEOLOGIC MOMENTS'' was the mysteriously evocative name Molissa Fenley gave to the full-evening piece she and her company presented on Wednesday at the Joyce Theater.
Set to music by Philip Glass and Julius Eastman, the dance had muted subtextual elements.
But there were times when wondering about the context and extra-dance content of the work proved more absorbing than the dance itself.


Hope B. Wickser, Interior Designer, Weds David Weil
LEAD: Hope Baldwin Wickser, a daughter of Mrs.
Roy D. Chapin Jr. of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and Nantucket, Mass., and the late Robert Livingston Wickser of Buffalo and Palm Beach, Fla., was married yesterday to David Scott Weil, the son of Nancy E. Weil of Philadelphia and Fredrick S. Weil of New York.

BASEBALL;
LEAD: He will turn 44 years of age in less than three weeks, but Tommy John is proving that he can still pitch effectively and win in the big leagues.
Tonight, he also became the Yankees' stopper, beating the Minnesota Twins, 6-4, in the Metrodome and putting an end to a losing streak that had reached three games.


The Laziest Gal in Town
LEAD: With pandas few and far between in New York, the city's residents - who can safely be said to have seen just about everything else - are journeying north to the Bronx Zoo.
There Ling Ling and Yong Yong, loans from the Beijing Zoo, are doing what pandas always do, which is to say not much, while cameras click and voices urge ''Look over this way.


Can a Town Set a Minimum House Size?
LEAD: A DENSE hilltop thicket of beech trees and red oaks in a pastoral corner of East Hampton, Conn., seems an unusually tranquil location for a major legal dispute.
But the fate of this three-acre parcel is expected to determine the right of any Connecticut town to regulate the minimum size of a house.


MOLECULAR INSTITE ADDS STAFF
LEAD: ENCOURAGED by recent Federal grants toward its new $36.4 million center for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the Center for Molecular Medicine and Immunology in Newark has begun adding to its staff.


TRYING TO SELL WITHOUT SALES
LEAD: A STRANGE paradox has developed in retailing lately.
When department stores increased the initial prices of the merchandise, their profits ebbed.
Now that they are reducing some of the list prices, their profits have picked up.


Sports of The Times; SHOOTING FOR PENSION PLAN FROM UNDER N.B.A. RUG
LEAD: HE's 59 years old now, a retired Wall Street institutional broker living in Stuart, Fla., in a condo on a golf course.
Every so often he puts on a sweat suit and sneakers and goes over to the Martin County High School gym where the coach, Don Wallen, lets him shoot baskets.
One day not long ago when the high school players were shooting free throws, one of the kids asked him if he wanted to shoot, too.

LEAD:  To the Editor:


HIGH C'S AT LOW PRICES IN GERMANY
LEAD: THIS IS BEING WRITTEN IN THE MIDST OF A new production here of ''Der Ring des Nibelungen.'' The subject, however, is neither the performance of Wagner's music nor Ruth Berghaus's avant-garde staging.
My concern here is with the sociology of opera - how the very experience of going to opera in Frankfurt seems so different from that in New York.


Protests On Navyport
LEAD:  To the Editor:


DEVELOPERS HALT PLAN TO BUILD DAM ON NEW HAMPSHIRE RIVER
LEAD: A six-year effort to build a small hydroelectric dam on the Merrimack River here has been abandoned.


BRINGING LIGHT AND SPACE TO A TENEMENT
LEAD: THERE WOULD SEEM, AT FIRST glance, no common ground whatsoever between serious architectural intentions and a tenement on Mott Street.
The tenement is harsh, cramped, a pile of tiny warrens that barely meets any rational standard of decent housing.
Its problems would not seem to be those that can be solved by a dose of high art.


Diverging Views Found on Donating Organs
LEAD: Americans are more likely to donate the organs of a loved one for transplant than to donate their own, according to a new survey of public opinion.


The Unromantic Generation
LEAD: Bruce Weber does offer hope, though, when he states that ''young people are older than they used to be.'' I suspect that by the time they are 30 they will be sufficiently bored by their own constrictions to go through ''mid-life crisis.'' Fortunately, they will be young enough to start over, or to start, period.


WHY THE SUN NEVER SETS ON A GEOCHRON CLOCK
LEAD: JAMES M. KILBURG'S big day in the sun was Nov. 19, 1985.

ISLANDERS ARE LEVELED BY FLYERS, 5-1
LEAD: For the first time in these playoffs, the Islanders could not scramble their way into a comeback.
Finally, faced with a sixth glimpse of elimination and the unrelenting force of the Flyers, the combination proved too much for the Islanders.


SAUCES ADD A SPICY TOUCH TO FISH DISHES
LEAD: WHILE nothing beats fresh seafood served plain, I like to experiment with different sauces.
For example, a green peppercorn and brandy sauce is superb with fish steaks such as shark, swordfish or tuna or fillets of red snapper.
A piquant ancho chili sauce is wonderful with sauteed shrimp.
And, for shad roe, which are now at the height of their season, an old-fashioned beurre noisette with capers - a sauce normally served with skate in

Return From the Dustbin of History
LEAD: I appeal to you, a future generation of Party leaders, whose historical mission will include the obligation to take apart the monstrous cloud of crimes that is growing ever more huge in these frightful times. . . . -Nikolai Bukharin, a few days before his arrest in 1937 Will Mikhail S. Gorbachev give Leon Trotsky, Bukharin and other Bolshevik revolutionaries their rightful place in the history of the Soviet Union?


'GUYS AND DOLLS' STAGED IN BRIDGEPORT
LEAD: ONCE, musical comedies were just what Broadway did best.
Now, the season's new American musicals have dwindled to none.
What to do, but to turn to ''Guys and Dolls'' for sustenance.
After all, if one musical can represent the best of Broadway's best, this is the one.


Joan Fisher Is Married
LEAD: Joan Catharine Fisher and Christopher M. Fox, art teachers at the Haverford School, were married yesterday at White's Chapel in Milton, Del.

ARE VIEWERS ENTITLED TO GAMES ON FREE TV?
LEAD: The matter of ''entitlement'' to view free games at home may be debatable, but to baseball teams concerned about increasing the ranks of their fans there can be but one answer.

IRAN-CONTRA INQUIRY NETS ITS FIRST OFFENDER
LEAD: EVEN as Congress made final preparations for the opening this week of its public hearings on the Iran-contra scandals, a central question was resolved.

Paris Museums
LEAD: To the Editor: I enjoyed your article on the little museums of Paris.
Not only are their collections unique, but they are often in areas that travelers might not otherwise visit.
One such museum (not included in the article) that fascinated my family and me on a rainy afternoon last year was the Musee de

The letters are to be published this month by Princeton University Press.


GARBAGE ODYSSEY PROVES EMBARRASSING
LEAD: LONG ISLAND'S pariah garbage barge gathered more than just flies last week as it meandered through the southern seas.


DISHES THAT DEFY LABELS
LEAD: WHAT kind of restaurant is Uwe's in Oyster Bay?
It's a puzzlement.
The slightly nautical decor with wall hangings of sailing ships and fish suggests a seafood restaurant.
But the menu doesn't confirm the nautical theme.


Diane McWhorter Is Married to Richard Rosen
LEAD: Rebecca Diane McWhorter, the daughter of Elizabeth Gore Biggs and Martin Westgate McWhorter, both of Birmingham, Ala., was married there yesterday to Richard Dean Rosen, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

LEAD: The New York City Department of Health last week released a list of 30 food establishments cited for violating the health code.


DANCE: 'VARIATIONS' BY BALANCHINE
LEAD: GEORGE BALANCHINE'S ''Theme and Variations'' is more than a set of choreographic patterns to music by Tchaikovsky.
When well danced, this ballet can have the elegance of a fancy party.
Its variations can seem like sparkling repartee and its duets can resemble the sonnets two sophisticated lovers might send each other.


MAINE DEBATES BIG PLAN TO BUY LAND FOR PUBLIC
LEAD: With its 3,500 miles of coastline, 6,000 lakes and rugged northern mountains, Maine has become known as a paradise for outdoor pursuits.

BLUES: COPELAND'S AFRICAN INSPIRATION

The Rowny Time Bomb
LEAD: The chorus of doubts that has greeted the Reagan Administration's proposal to eliminate nuclear missiles from Europe includes some surprising voices.

A NOBLE EXPERIMENT GOES BANKRUPT
LEAD: WHEN Hyatt Clark Industries makes its last roller bearing here in August, it will fade into history as one of the nation's most closely-watched - and perhaps most disheartening - industrial experiments of the 1980's.


INSURERS START TO TOUGHEN THEIR RULES
LEAD: SINCE the 1970's, health and life insurance for people labeled high risk - either because they have medical problems like hypertension or because they engage in hazardous activities like sky diving - has become more and more affordable.

EATING THE COMPETITION FOR LUNCH
LEAD: A TRIP to the Corporate bookshelf usually provides some food for thought,and my latest excursion was no exception.
In ''Managing Your Mind and Mood Through Food,'' Judith J. Wurtman, a nutrition expert, says the overriding, undeniable reason many people feel listless at conferences and seminars - wait, don't nod off yet -is that they eat incorrectly.


The Unromantic Generation
LEAD: Bruce Weber's perceptive article ''Alone Together: The Unromantic Generation'' (April 5), did not go far enough.
It should have been entitled ''The Unromantic Age.'' Though yuppies in their mid-20's may reflect most obviously a loss of human values, the trend is much more pervasive.
Consider the longstanding success of ''Dallas,'' Madonna's hit song ''Material Girl,'' the beer commercial ''You Can Have It All'' and the recent scandals originating in greed.

Starting Over to House Newark's Poor
LEAD: OF all the grim images that have ruled Newark, overshadowing small signs of hope whenever they arose, none has been more severe than that of its high-rise housing projects.
Ravaged, worn, largely vacant and looming over their crumbling neighborhoods, they have become towering reminders of the city's failure to care for its own.

WHEN THE DIFFERENCE REALLY MATTERS
LEAD: NOT knowing what a piece of software really can do is one of the greatest stumbling blocks to putting it to use.
Ten years ago, for instance, few writers had any idea of the value of moving blocks of text or of searching and replacing words or phrases.
Today these functions are standard on most word processing packages.

AN EXQUISITE NOVEL, A CLOUDY DRAMATIZATION
LEAD: ELIZABETH BOWEN'S ''DEATH OF the Heart,'' published in 1938, remains an exquisite exploration of adolescence.
Even today, when teen-ager anxieties seem centered on whether or not Molly Ringwald will get a date for the school prom, the novel can whisk readers back a mere 50 years to a time when a sensitive 16-year-old girl named Portia might still have to confront the profoundly unsettling specter of Innocence Betrayed.


CARLY SIMON'S EMOTION-LADEN SELF-PORTRAIT
LEAD: ''COMING AROUND AGAIN,'' the title song of Carly Simon's latest album, embodies everything that the 41-year-old singer-songwriter does best.
This deceptively simple song, written for the movie ''Heartburn,'' distills the film's themes and atmosphere in broad, blunt strokes.
Depicting a high-powered, high-strung woman struggling miserably through the rituals of daily life while her marriage is coming apart, its verses paint a concise picture of domestic desperation: ''You pay the grocer/ Fix the toaster/ Kiss the host goodbye/ Then you break a window/ Burn the souffle/ Scream the lullaby.

I want to get this taken care of so I can visit my family in Mexico.''  - Melesio Sidon of  San Antonio, Tex., an illegal  alien who will seek amnesty.  [ 1:4. ]


THE FINE ART OF COLLECTING COLLECTORS
LEAD: ON THE HOT TURF OF CONTEMPORARY art, museums are beginning to look like corporate raiders.
In today's market, where seven-figure prices for major 20th-century works are increasingly evident, institutions can no longer come up with the money to buy them.
So they are making more aggressive pitches than ever for donations of single works and whole collections, and boldly invading the ''territory'' of other institutions to do so.


THE STAGE: 'KEEPING UP'
LEAD: THE simple facade of an authentic folk art hints always at some deeper and more mysterious ur-world behind it.
Grieg at his best -which is usually when his music is at its simplest - invents such a tradition out of thin air.
And it is a world of such charm and fascination that even an entire evening of his songs - like the one Norma French and Richard Gordon offered at Alice Tully Hall


99 Demonstrators Are Seized At Seabrook Nuclear Reactor
LEAD: About 300 demonstrators converged on the Seabrook nuclear power plant today to protest attempts to reduce its evacuation zone, and 99 were arrested when they refused to leave.

LEAD: Mrs.
Alastair Campbell of Bernardsville, N.J., and Frans H. ten Bos of London have announced the engagement of their daughter Helena ten Bos to Count Frederic de Belloy de Saint-Lienard, the son of Count and Countess Henri de Belloy de Saint-Lienard of Notre Dame de Gravenchon, France.
A June 27 wedding is planned.


SAUCES ADD A SPICY TOUCH TO FISH DISHES
LEAD: WHILE nothing beats fresh seafood served plain, I like to experiment with different sauces.
For example, a green peppercorn and brandy sauce is superb with fish steaks such as shark, swordfish or tuna or fillets of red snapper.
A piquant ancho chili sauce is wonderful with sauteed shrimp.
And, for shad roe, which are now at the height of their season, an old-fashioned beurre noisette with capers - a sauce normally served with skate in


AN AEGEAN ARISTOCRAT
LEAD: Places that have seen their days of glory but still bear themselves with the dignity of a dowager are often among the most rewarding for travelers.
However prim and staid, they offer an adventure in time, a plunge into the not-quite-past, a stroll through a present that no longer looks toward a future.


RAINES SPARKLES IN DEBUT
LEAD: Tim Raines of the Expos hitting a grand slam against the Mets.
He also hit a triple and two singles.
Page 5. (The New York Times/Larry C. Morris)


ARE VIEWERS ENTITLED TO GAMES ON FREE TV?
LEAD: Since most Yankees and Mets games are on a cable channel I cannot receive, when I am in the mood for baseball I find myself forced to watch two other teams whose games I do receive - the Braves and the Cubs.
Need I say more?
GIL RENBERG  Chappaqua, N.Y.

Vamping Till Ready
LEAD: It ALL BEGAN WITH AN innocent parenthetical remark.
A couple of months ago, in a piece about the language of self-involvement, I quoted a girlfriend of Woody Allen as having described the actor as ''very much of a womanizer, very self-involved.'' Then this afterthought: ''(If anyone knows the noun for the feminine counterpart to womanizer, send it in).


NO LONGER IN HIDING
LEAD: THESE DAYS, IF A WOMAN LEANS FORWARD and a bit of an essential underpinning shows, it is not considered a fashion faux pas.
Quite the opposite.
Today's teddies, brassieres, bustiers, camisoles and corselettes are designed to be seen, and not just in the boudoir.
The best do the things they have always been intended to do - help support or shape up a comely figure.

They've worn them before, but generally not to the office.

Audience of One For a Daughter
LEAD: MY daughter turns this way and that, striking professional model-like poses as best she knows how.
I regard her with mixed feelings, my mouth perhaps too tight, lips more pursed (as my own mother might say) than smiling openly and appreciatively: an independent, willful tear sneaks warily down my cheek.


ARE VIEWERS ENTITLED TO GAMES ON FREE TV?
LEAD: The real issue facing us is not whether viewers should have to spend a few extra bucks a month to see games on cable as opposed to free television; it's whether they should be able to see games at all.

THEATER: PIELMEIER'S 'SLEIGHT OF HAND,' A THRILLER

Mr.
Pielmeier's would-be thriller opens with 50 minutes of rambling, numbing exposition -much of it accompanied, if not enlivened, by the sort of canned magic tricks so memorably mocked by the comic illusionists Penn and Teller.

The Editorial Notebook; The Near-Nuclear Club
LEAD: For decades, the effort to contain the spread of nuclear weapons has depended on several assumptions.
There were five nuclear-weapons nations, the rest were nonnuclear-weapons nations, and the best way to maintain that status was to control nuclear technologies and materials.

MUSIC: KOLB PREMIERE, BY CHAMBER SYMPHONY
LEAD: BARBARA KOLB'S ''Yet That Things Go Round,'' which received its premiere Saturday evening in a performance by the New York Chamber Symphony at the 92d Street Y, is a taut, edgy piece of music, smartly conceived.
Written in three nearly continuous movements, the 15-minute work builds to an early and stirring climax and then explores in moody fashion some of the jagged melodies laid down in the opening section.

Dirt Under the U.S. Rug
LEAD: The trial of Klaus Barbie, known as the ''butcher of Lyon'' for his wartime Gestapo activities, finally starts next week.
It will be something of an ordeal for France, which never really faced up to the extent of collaboration in Nazi atrocities during the German occupation.
It should be for the U.S.


BOND VOLATILITY IS COOLING DEMAND
LEAD: Pessimism is widespread as the credit markets face this week's Treasury borrowing program with a long list of reasons why foreign and domestic investors will require higher interest rates before adding to their holdings of notes and bonds.


Probe Albany's Padded Commissions
LEAD: Prosecutors are looking into a dark corner of New York government: legislative commissions believed to be hidden preserves of no-show and seldom-show jobs.
Governor Cuomo boldly questioned the value of several commissions before he signed off on the state budget last week.
But he stopped short of singling them out for a veto, apparently to avoid further inflaming his battle over ethics with the Legislature.


Must We Torpedo Our Banks?

With his death, there is need to guard against making him a scapegoat as well as a participant.

LEAD: By the time the trip was over, there was far less luster to the Yankees than there had been two weeks ago.

LEAD: ''STEELE JUSTICE'' isn't designed as a comedy, but it does earn high marks for inadvertent humor.

LEAD: Meile Rockefeller, the 31-year-old great-granddaughter of the man who built Rockefeller Center, is herself altering the cityscape.

ROCK: SQUEEZE, REUNITED
LEAD: SQUEEZE disbanded in 1982.
But the crowd that packed the Ritz on Wednesday for the last of the reunited band's three sold-out shows greeted the barrage of insidiously catchy songs as enthusiastically as if they were the latest pop hits.
One had to wonder where all these people were in 1979-80, when ingenious pop-rock confections like ''Another Nail in My Heart'' and ''Pulling Mussels (from the Shell)'' were failing to win Squeeze the American mass audience the critics insisted the band deserved.


A NEW SLR MAKES ITS DEBUT
LEAD: NIKON is a camera company best known as a supplier of professional equipment, including rugged camera bodies, crisp lenses and fuss-free accessories.

USING LIFE INSURANCE AS A TAX SHELTER
LEAD: WHILE the recent Tax Act effectively axed many tax shelters, it hardly touched the tax breaks provided by life insurance.

LEAD:  DESERT FABULOSO.
By Lisa Lovenheim. (Plume/ NAL, Paper, $7.95.) ''Desert Fabuloso'' would be a typical coming-of-age novel about the early development and spiritual education of Bradley Roberson 3d, but for the fact that the poor little rich boy is already a man.

WHOSE BUSINESS IS TV NEWS?
LEAD: THERE IS A CRISIS IN NETWORK NEWSROOMS, although then again maybe there's not.
Congress has wondered what's up.

PIANO: GERALD ROBBINS
LEAD: IT took only the opening theme of Mendelssohn's ''Variations Serieuses'' to establish that Gerald Robbins's evening of piano music at Weill Recital Hall on Wednesday would be an event of substance.

QUIET HAVEN IN THE BALEARICS
LEAD: For many people, Minorca is the plain Jane of the Balearic Islands.
Less visually spectacular and poorer than Majorca, not as hip or trendy as Ibiza, the island to miss if you can't see them all.

LEAD: Peter Maas's distressing story of the victimization of Teresa Taylor, her young son and, ultimately, her entire family by a violent husband is, tragically, not an anomaly in our society (''Legacy of a Mother's Murder,'' April 12).
The latest Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics indicate that 30 percent of the women murdered in this country are killed by their husbands, former husbands or boyfriends (usually after having suffered years of physical and emotional abuse).

GUN MOVIES: BIG BORE AND SMALL CALIBER
LEAD: IT'S TIME TO COME TO THE DEFENSE of the American moviegoing public, too often and too glibly characterized as a collective cretin with the taste of a 12-year-old and the brain of a gnat.
In fact, the American moviegoing public is incredibly sophisticated.
It's an organism so sensitive that, within a few weeks, it can discern the difference between Sylvester Stallone in ''Rambo,'' stripped to the waist and carrying enough live ammo to refight the Vietnam War, and Sylvester Stallone in ''Over the

...AND LEARNING TO BE A MODERN MOM
LEAD: ONCE upon a time, motherhood was a sacred institution based on the combined arts and sciences of baking, laundering, polishing and mending, in addition to listening, advising, healing and nurturing.
But as my musical hero Bob Dylan so aptly put it, ''The times, they are a-changing.''


REWRITNING THE ANNUAL BUDGET DRAMA
LEAD: THE clarion call has come once again from the Treasury Department: Congress must approve an increase in the public debt ceiling so the Government can continue to borrow to pay its bills.

The Pope Looks at The Reformation
LEAD: In other centuries, and even in this one, the Roman Church referred to Protestant groups as ''heretical conventicles,'' so unyielding was the schism over Rome's authority.
A few decades of ecumenicism have cast it in a softer light.
Last week the Pope himself visited a center of the Reformation, and he said the movement had brought spiritual renewal to the Roman Catholic

Tenants are in Command As Vacancies Hit Home
LEAD: FACE-TO-FACE with a record volume of empty offices, many of the nation's developers and builders are changing the way they do business.
Smaller companies that were in the business just for the tax advantages have either left the field already or sold out at fire-sale prices.
The larger, more diversified owners have reached far into their deep pockets and now are willing to cut major deals to finally fill some of their vacant buildings.


THE LITTLE VILLAGE AND THE BIG HOUSE
LEAD: FOR more than 100 years the village of Ossining has sought to close the state prison known as Sing Sing.

LEAD: GALLERY EXHIBITIONS of medieval objects -boldly carved stone capitals, dragon-embellished candlesticks, massive iron locks, lavishly illuminated manuscript pages and buckles enameled in jewel colors - have become increasingly rare in New York in recent years.
The scarcity of such material in the marketplace makes ''Art Treasures of the Middle Ages,'' at Michael Ward, 9 East 93d Street, through

COUNCIL LOOKS FOR BETTER WAYS TO CROSS THE STREET
LEAD: WHEN Borough President David N. Dinkins announced appointment of a Planning for Pedestrians Council in February, he said the council would make recommendations within a year.

DRESSING UP ROUTINE PAPERWORK
LEAD: WITH its new PS/2 series of computers, I.B.M. is beaming its spotlight on large corporations.

A TRW TWIST: SELLING A SERVICE THAT IS OFTEN FREE
LEAD: CREDIT reporting agencies have been keeping tabs on Americans' spending habits for years, selling the information to banks and other lenders.
Now TRW Inc., the biggest of these watchdogs, has introduced a unique marketing twist: It wants consumers to pay $35 a year for a package of services centered on their credit reports, some of questionable value, others available for free.


HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, DENNIS LEVINE
LEAD: THE puncturing of a social myth is not a lovely thing.
When Dennis Levine was arrested a year ago this week, and then others and still others, and then Ivan Boesky - suddenly the whole idea that risk arbitrage could be practiced without inside information lay in doubt.
And with it, the Reagan era myth that greed was good.


Q / and A
LEAD:  Andorra


MY SUMMER JOB WITH SINCLAIR LEWIS
LEAD: ONE morning in May 1937, back from a year's study at Clare College, Cambridge, I sat reading ''Gone With the Wind'' in the New York apartment of my former Yale roommate Chester Kerr, wondering what to try next in the job line.
A hoped-for spot on Time magazine had fallen through.
The phone rang, and the call was for me - from another Yale classmate, Henry McKnight, who was working at The Herald Tribune.


THE BARBIE FILE
LEAD: THE TRIAL OF KLAUS Barbie is to open tomorrow in the French city of Lyons, and when it does, it will take an act of will to reconcile the frail 74-year-old man in the dock, whom one might imagine stooped over a flower bed in the garden of his retirement home, with the crimes he is accused of committing.


THE AVANT-GARDE ADVANCES, EARNING APPLAUSE AND RUFFLING FEATHERS
LEAD: THE BIG NEWS IN VIENNA this season - culturally speaking, that is - has been the takeover of the ancient and honorable Burgtheater by a bunch of West German avant-gardists.
Traditionalists are shaking their heads in dismay, but the theaters - the Burgtheater itself and the separate Akademietheater, under the same company's auspices - are full, and the press response has been enthusiastic.


If You're Thinking of Living in:; NEW CANAAN
LEAD: TWO hundred years ago, Canaan Parish's population of less than a hundred people was decimated.

WHEN A MOTHER GIVES UP A CHILD
LEAD: WHEN a woman gives birth, something happens that bonds her forever to that child.
There is a primal, instinctive drive that makes mothers do crazy things to keep the children they bear - Mary Beth Whitehead is a good example of that.
No matter what the courts decide, a woman who gives up her infant is affected for life by it.


A World Without Nuclear Weapons
LEAD: In his contribution to the symposium, Zbigniew Brzezinski argues that, as long as the great powers continue to settle disputes through war, it is not possible to abolish nuclear weapons because, in case of war, the antagonists would be tempted to build them again - and possibly use them - and the knowledge of how to make these weapons cannot be erased.

ONTARIO'S FRENCH RIVER FOR SALACE OF THE WILDS
LEAD: Canoeing around Ontario's near north one day in 1615, the French adventurer Samuel de Champlain found what he had long been searching for, a river that French fur traders could ply to paddle their pelts out from as far west as present-day Sault Ste.
Marie.
Some 300 years later well-heeled Pittsburghers - this time in search of nothing more esoteric than a patch of fresh air -discovered the same French River.

EAST SIDE, WEST SIDE
LEAD: Imagine that the island of Manhattan is divided by a wall running down Fifth Avenue, with Times Square and Lincoln Center in the hands of a pro-Western government linked to a free republic entrenched west of the Mississippi River.
A Communist regime, though, dominates the eastern half of the island; it also controls all of the United States east of the Mississippi.


SKIDMORE COLLEGE
LEAD: At Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., 518 students were awarded degrees yesterday.

TAFFETA GOWNS BLOSSOM AT FESTIVE SPRING BALLS
LEAD: SWIRLING onto the New York social scene like so many taffeta tornadoes are this spring's ball gowns, which seem to be setting a new standard for opulence.
Few, and not far enough between, are the chairs that can accommodate these splendiferous garments, whose skirts drape or balloon over the edge of chairs like parachutes floating to rest.


On the Stand: Patriots or Rogues?
LEAD: The first week of Iran-contra hearings quickly displayed the harsh dilemma facing the Reagan Administration.
The testimony of the first witness, a retired Air Force general named Richard Secord, threw the untenable choice into sharpest relief: whether to describe those who participated in the Iran-contra affair as patriots or as rogues.

A SPRINGTIME DINNER, A TO Z
LEAD: A SPRINGTIME dinner, one that takes advantage of the season's fresh treasures, can be a pleasure to prepare and serve.
After a winter of tired parsley, distressed zucchini and lettuces struggling to survive, it is a delight to shop for produce once again.
The verdant selection beckons.
Spring means freshness.


The Democrats' Trade Folly
LEAD: It is up to Democrats in the Senate to reaffirm their party's long-standing commitment to free trade by voting ''no'' to protectionist legislation.
That is the only way they can atone for the irresponsible behavior of their Democratic colleagues in the House, who handed President Reagan an enormous political gift when they passed (with the help of 17 Republicans) the Gephardt amendment to the trade bill.


Headliners; Voting for Jobs
LEAD: When voters lose jobs, elected officals tend to lose votes.
So it was with Mayor Richard G. Hatcher of Gary, Ind., whose bid for a sixth term ended last week when he finished second in the Democratic mayoral primary.
Mr.
Hatcher, who gained national prominence in 1967 as one of the first blacks elected mayor of a major city, had been losing support in recent years as the steel industry, Gary's main employer, collapsed and his administration was unable to revive the city's economy.

Cable Service Postponed Again
LEAD: The saga of cable television in New York City might be the stuff of a network series - if it is ever concluded.

POLICE GAINING A COMMUNITY ROLE
LEAD: ONE day a few weeks ago, a large garbage container appeared on Columbus Avenue near 62d Street in Manhattan.
The bin, provided for a nearby construction project, blocked the fire hydrant in front of a restaurant.
Police Officer Edward Acevedo, who walks past the restaurant nearly every day as part of his duties as a member of the Community Patrol Officer Program in the 20th Precinct, called the Sanitation Department.


Tears of Mrs. Hart
LEAD: Gary Hart said he woke up about 4 A.M., and decided hell, no, he wouldn't just go out quietly but would speak his mind, tell everybody about the dreadful times we are in.
He ought to know that those wonderful middle-of-the-night inspirations don't look so good in daylight.

MUSIC IS SUBTEXT IN 'THROUGH ROSES'
LEAD: CALL it a mini-spoken opera, a music monodrama or just a hybrid.

JAMES AND US-25 YEARS AND THE BOND SURVIVES


Career Choice
LEAD: WHILE many of his fellow graduates will start the summer continuing their search for suitable employment, Brian Bosworth, who picked up a degree in management information from the University of Oklahoma yesterday, should have a simpler time securing a job worthy of his college-honed talents.
The outspoken Sooner star is expected to announce tomorrow that he will try his hand in the National Football League, and given his record on the football field and in the classroom, he should have no problem finding a slot in a linebacker-training program.

TWO VISIONS OF THE SPOILS OF CRUELTY
LEAD: AS THE CREATOR OF THE THEATER OF Cruelty, Antonin Artaud declared that cruelty was not exclusively a matter of ''bodily laceration.'' From the point of view of the mind, he said, it ''signifies rigor, implacable intention and decision, irreversible and absolute determination.'' That definition aptly applies to the essence of Christopher Hampton's brilliant adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos's novel, ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses.

SINGULAR ARTISTS WHO WORK IN THE FIRST PERSON PLURAL
LEAD: IN ONE OF THE GALLERIES OF THE current Whitney biennial, the work of the photographers Mike and Doug Starn, better known as the Starn Twins, and the collaborative painters David McDermott and Peter McGough face each other from opposite walls.
With this juxtaposition, - perhaps the most provocative and appropriate in the entire exhibition - the biennial's curators signal that the artists have a lot in common, and to some extent they are right.

The bride, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward C. Haggerty of Summit and Sea Girt, N.J., graduated from Hollins College.


LEHMAN SHOWS 'PRODUCTS' OF BRONX ALTERNATIVE SPACES
LEAD: THE number of artists has long exceeded that of galleries willing and able to exhibit them.
Still, the imbalance can never have been so dire as it was in the early 1970's, when the present art-education system introduced by American universities after World War II began bearing fruit in earnest - and when alternative spaces came to the rescue.


PATTERNS IN FAMILY VISITS
LEAD: LIFE, after all, is not a one-way street.
Living on Long Island had seemed to dictate that everything moved from the city to the suburbs.
First we moved to the Island, and hardly looked back to Brooklyn.


The Annual Rent Catharsis
LEAD: Now is the time for tenants and landlords to sign up for the annual hearings that help to determine how much rents will be allowed to rise in some 943,000 rent stabilized apartments, lofts and hotel rooms in New York City.


A Martyr Of Auschwitz
LEAD: It appears to me that Susanne Batzdorff misunderstands the concept of martyrdom.
Martyrdom is not the desire to die.
Rather it is the belief that there is something more important even than one's own life, to wit, one's convictions, one's principles or what one perceives to be the truth.

LEAD: From time to time, an article receives a particularly strong response.

WHAT'S NEW IN THE TEA BUSINESS
LEAD: IT WAS the drink back in colonial days.
But then the Boston Tea Party made it a symbol of British oppression.
After that came expanding coffee imports.


Youth Hostels
LEAD: To the Editor: Paul Hofmann's mention of youth hostels in Europe in his A to Z listings (''The Instant Seasoned Traveler,'' March 1) neglected to point out that many of them are open to those of all ages, umpteen-agers as well as teen-agers with some hostels being real show places, i.e., the Swiss youth hostel in St.

Margaret Ann Drewes Weds Richard G. Pyle
LEAD: Margaret Ann Drewes was married yesterday to Richard G. Pyle at the Douglaston (Queens) Community Church by the Rev.
John Meyer.


A Martyr Of Auschwitz
LEAD: All the current hullabaloo about whether Edith Stein was killed because she was a Jew or because she was a Roman Catholic is irreligious and irrelevant (''A Martyr of Auschwitz,'' by Susanne M. Batzdorff, April 12).
Of course, she died because of the Nazis' odium fidei!
Jewish faith and Catholic faith are at their esoteric core the same faith: the faith of our common father, Abraham.


Susan E. Rehm Becomes Bride of Joseph D. Gatto
LEAD: At the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn Heights yesterday Susan Elizabeth Rehm, a vice president for corporate finance of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Manhattan, was married to Joseph Daniel Gatto, an investment banker for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company in Manhattan.

CLEAN AIR-CONDITIONERS FOR THE COMING COOLING SEASON
LEAD: ALTHOUGH modern room air-conditioners require little maintenance, there are a few steps that every homeowner can take to prolong the life of the machine, as well as to improve efficiency and lower costs.


Stereotype and Stigma
LEAD: To the Editor:


ROCK: HUEY LEWIS
LEAD: CLEAN-CUT, good-natured, proudly conventional - that's Huey Lewis's kind of rock, and it filled Madison Square Garden on Monday and Tuesday for shows by the six-man Huey Lewis and the News.
With the Tower of Power horn section for added punch, the band dispensed a solid, well-crafted amalgam of soul, doo-wop and blues-rock on Tuesday, topped by Mr.


A SPRINGTIME DINNER, A TO Z
LEAD: A SPRINGTIME dinner, one that takes advantage of the season's fresh treasures, can be a pleasure to prepare and serve.
After a winter of tired parsley, distressed zucchini and lettuces struggling to survive, it is a delight to shop for produce once again.
The verdant selection beckons.
Spring means freshness.


NEW YORK CITY CHILDREN LEARN TO RECYCLE REFUSE
LEAD: A squadron of pupils from a Greenwich Village elementary school has enlisted in New York's war against waste, shouting their battle cry -''recycle'' - in their classrooms, playgrounds, neighborhoods and homes.


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: A users' guide to New York City parks on April 26 in The World of New York, part 2 of The Times Magazine, misstated the size of several city swimming pools.
Only Hamilton Fish Pool in Manhattan and Astoria Pool in Queens now meet Olympic specifications.
Also in that magazine, on the map of development projects in the city, site 14 was misidentified.


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: Because of a mechanical error, two arts-review headlines were reversed last Sunday on the bottom of page 76 in this section.
The headlines that should have been transposed were ''Recital: Norma French Sings Grieg Program,'' and ''The Stage: 'Keeping Up.' ''


NOW, WOMEN HAVE TO TAKE THE BLAME
LEAD: IT HAS been easy and valid during the past decade to blame women's inability to reach senior management on corporate America's caste system - men at the top and women at the bottom or, more recently, at the middle management level.
The reasons for women's failure to rise through the ranks more quickly are myriad and have been dissected ad nauseum - lack of drive, family considerations, lack of sponsors, the old-boy network.


No Headline
LEAD:  QUESTIONABLE SUBLEASE
Question: I have been offered a sublease for $800 a month on a rent-stabilized apartment for which the tenant pays only $400 a month.
The tenant says she has bought an apartment elsewhere in Manhattan and plans to move there.

U.S. TIES WITH LIBERIA PUT UNDER NEW STRAIN

Every West African nation has a patron, usually the former colonial power - Britain, France or Portugal.
Liberia has the United

On the schedule are Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in ''Keeper of the Flame'' (1942); the Joanne Woodward-Paul Newman project, ''Rachel, Rachel'' (1968); and though not in the same league, Don Ameche and Gene Tierney in the original ''Heaven Can Wait'' (1943).


TALE OF TWO STRING QUARTETS: ONE RISES, ONE DISBANDS
LEAD: TWO string quartets performing Friday evening provide a contrast between an up-and-coming group and a 15-year veteran that is disbanding.

LEAD: Israel's Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, who is also head of the Labor Party, threatened last week to try to break up the country's 31-month-old goverment over the issue of a proposed international peace conference on the Middle East.
Mr.
Peres, a former Prime Minister, favors the talks, whose participants would include Israel, Jordan, a Palestinian delegation, the United States and the Soviet Union.


Reluctant to Relate
LEAD: To the Editor:


Where There's a World There's a Way
LEAD: AFTER the gray skies of winter break and patches of blue burst out more frequently from whitening clouds then, in the first glorious sun-filled days of spring, the human spirit rises to greet the coming season of rebirth.
The warmth and promise, so different from the chill before and the dulling heat to come, provide the most delicious time of the year.


FOR BANKS, MUCH IN A NAME
LEAD: DON'T be surprised if the next time you drive by your neighborhood bank, someone is out front changing the sign.


KEEPNG SPRING NOISY WITH SONG
LEAD: THIS year marks a quarter of a century since Rachel Carson told her ''fable of tomorrow'' - a tomorrow in which a devastating blight had crept over a once happy, healthy and beautiful town.


The Air Force's SR-71 shows an eye for detail
LEAD: MOST OF THE TIME IT IS INVISIBLE from earth, hurtling along at speeds over 2,000 miles an hour at altitudes up to 100,000 feet.
The United States Air Force SR-71 is the world's fastest, technically most advanced spy plane, capable of seeing more from a greater distance than any other aircraft.
And recent developments - the escalation of espionage between East and West, the curtailment of NASA's Space Shuttle program and the loss of several spy satellites through technical failures - have made this extraordinary plane more vital than ever.


AIRLINE CHECK-IN FOR YOUR KAYAK
LEAD: When it took us several days to bully a Latin American airline into freighting our son's acoustic bass to him in Bogota, we thought with envy of those parents whose offspring had fallen in love with the flute or piccolo.
The crate sat for days and days in a hangar at Kennedy International Airport, presumably to be sure it was not explosive or illegal.


BISTRO'S NEW SIMPLICITY
LEAD: THE RETURN - SOME MIGHT even say the debut - of bistro-style cooking in the United States has restaurantgoers astir.
But the puzzlement of the moment seems to be exactly how to define what it is.

Virtually overnight, this 2,300-acre stretch of low-rise offices has posed a significant challenge to tenant-needy developers throughout the

THE WRIGHT SITE
LEAD: To the Editor:


BEYOND THE SPECTACLE OF A.B.T.'S 'SLEEPING BEAUTY'
LEAD: ''THE SLEEPING BEAUTY'' OF 1890 was created as a ''ballet-feerie'' for Russia's Imperial Theater in St.
Petersburg.
Yet, if ''ballet-feerie'' was a term applied to productions in which spectacle was dominant, ''The Sleeping Beauty'' was never conceived as empty spectacle.
Meaning was present on every level.


Andrea Zalaznick, A Research Aide, Becomes a Bride
LEAD: Andrea Zalaznick, a research assistant for the Whitcom Investment Company in New York, was married yesterday to Eugene Braigen, research analyst for Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates, an investment bank specializing in the communications industry.

Doing Battle With the Scourge of Graffiti
LEAD: IT may not be Star Wars weaponry, but a company in Stamford, Conn., has developed a chemical and a technique to remove vandals' scrawls from buildings and keep them off.


A LA CARTE
LEAD: WHEN Main Streets, not shopping malls, were the centers of Long Island, luncheonettes were the places to meet friends and have freshly squeezed lemonade.
There are still a few luncheonettes left on Long Island.
Their decor is not 1987 but 1947, and so is the food.


SPOTLIGHT FALLS ON THE SECRET WORLD OF A MASTER OPERATIVE
LEAD: AS the first week of hearings on the Iran-contra affair drew to a close, new questions had been raised about Ronald Reagan's involvement.

McFarlane's planned testimony.


TELEVISION'S MESSAGE IS SEX
LEAD: GEORGE ORWELL'S ''Nineteen Eighty-Four,'' published in 1949, portrayed a form of television as ''Big Brother,'' which beamed controlling messages to the public.
Orwell may have misread the messages, but he pinpointed the messenger.


BASEBALLS ARE FLYING OUT EVERYWHERE
LEAD: BOB OJEDA, the Mets' best pitcher in 1986, suggested that maybe the moon is aligned with Saturn.
Dave Johnson, his manager, speculated that it might have something to do with the work force in Haiti. ''Maybe one shift likes pitchers and another shift doesn't,'' Johnson said. ''Maybe the shift that doesn't like pitchers comes in and winds the ball tighter.


INHERITED FACTOR MAY PLAY A ROLE IN RISK OF AIDS
LEAD: British scientists have found the first evidence that genetic differences make some people more susceptible than others to infection with the virus that causes AIDS.


O'ROURKE ASSAILED OVER HOUSING SITES
LEAD: THE pieces of county-owned land listed last month by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke are either too small, too wet, too rocky or not really available for moderate-priced housing, according to officials in the communities where the land is situated.


DEFIANCE AND RAGE HONE A DEBUT RAP ALBUM
LEAD: ''UH-OH, CHUCK, THEY OUT TO get us!'' are the first words on the debut album by Public Enemy, ''Yo!
Bum Rush the Show'' (Def Jam/Columbia BFC 40658, album and cassette) - the grittiest rap album so far this year and one of rap's fastest sellers. ''Us'' refers to Chuck D (whose last name is Ridenhour) and Flavor-Flav (William Drayton), Public Enemy's songwriters and rappers.


Less Joblessness, Higher Hopes
LEAD: Analysts in and out of Government tore back to their calculators at last week's report of a drop of three-tenths of a percentage point in unemployment in April, to 6.2 percent, the lowest level in seven years.


WHY THE DOLLAR MUST FALL ANOTHER 30%
LEAD: DESPITE having fallen nearly 40 percent since February 1985, the dollar continues to be overvalued.
In fact, it will have to decline as much as 30 percent to eliminate the remaining trade deficit, create the conditions for cutting the Federal budget deficit and force Europe and Japan into more reasonable macroeconomic policies.


MUSTANG STILL SPORTS THAT OLD APPEAL
LEAD: I HAVE lusted, oft as not, over objects made of fiberglass and steel, with a bit of leather thrown in here and there.
It is hard to say how some of them have escaped me, but the list is long, a whole litany of automobiles I have coveted but not possessed.


INSURANCE ACCORD HITS SNAG
LEAD: FOR SIX years, Governor Kean has tried to change New Jersey's automobile-insurance law to limit nuisance suits, but just when he appears to have his best chance, the changes he wants seem to have developed a language problem.


Home From the Sea
LEAD: THE YACHTSMAN from Jamestown, R.I., who built his own sailboat for a race around the world won the Class II prize yesterday in the BOC Challenge competition.
Mike Plant crossed the finish line in Newport, R.I., at 2:10 P.M., completing his 27,000-mile solo voyage in 157 days 11 hours 44 minutes 44 seconds.


IN ROWAYTONCASUAL COMPETENCE
LEAD: IN this era of two-income families, going out to dinner is often a nonevent, a mere excuse to avoid cooking at the end of a working day; it is no longer always a special occasion.
A clutch of pleasant restaurants have opened to meet our new need, establishments that are fun and informal with light-hearted atmospheres.

HAITANS FIND HOPE IN SPECIAL STATUS
LEAD: When there was a knock on the door of his apartment in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, the former Haitian farmer would be gripped by fear, afraid it was the immigration agents.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  EDITOR TO AUTHOR: The Letters of Maxwell E. Perkins, edited by John Hall Wheelock. (Scribners, $10.95.) At Charles Scribner's Sons, the editor Maxwell E. Perkins shepherded into print the works of Wolfe, Fitzgerald, Hemingway and others.

LEAD:  To the Editor:


Legacy Of a Mother's Murder
LEAD: My gratitude to you for publishing Peter Maas's article.
To me, the callous attitude of officials was even more shocking than the murder.
LUCILLE PURDY  Westport, Conn.


BERLIN 1937, BERLIN 1987
LEAD: Berlin is about to begin celebrating its 750th anniversary, and on both sides of the wall there will be a great outpouring of art, theater, music and so on, enough to keep things humming for the rest of the year.
As usual, culture and politics will be cunningly intermingled in ways not always visible, for in this remarkable city you cannot play a sonata or exhibit a painting without touching a political chord.


90 FEARED DROWNED AS FERRY CAPSIZES ON YANGTZE
LEAD: More than 90 passengers on a ferryboat were feared to have drowned in the Yangtze River Friday when the ferry collided with a tugboat near the city of Nantong in Jiangsu Province, the official New China News Agency reported today.


TEAPOT -- TEST OF A POTTER'S INVENTIVENESS
LEAD: HOW FAR can you push a teapot?
It would seem, from a group of works by Mayer Shacter, a California artist, at the Sheila Nussbaum Gallery here, that a teapot can be pushed to the point of disassembling the components.
Of course, that implies that a sculptural form has been based on the concept of a teapot.


17 Killed in a Crash in Haiti
LEAD: A water truck crashed into a crowd of pedestrians and street vendors here Friday night, killing at least 17 people and injuring five others, witnesses said.
The accident occurred in the densely populated Post Marchand slum neighborhood.


THE HARTS: PARADOXES OF A POLITICAL MARRIAGE
LEAD: Gary Hart's dizzy fall offered a searing look at scenes from a modern political marriage, painstakingly patched together in private only to be pulled apart in public.


FOSTER CARE
LEAD: The additional $103 million for foster care would permit some innovations, including a computer to track vacancies in foster homes and a new unit to review adoptions.
The largest chunk - $66 million - would be used to provide foster-family standing for relatives who take in children.
There are 3,000 such families now, caring for 6,600 children who are related to them.


ATHLETES DRAW FIRE, AND PEOPLE STOKE IT
LEAD: IT happened on a Sunday night after a game in Kearney, Neb., during the summer of 1959.
I was a 19-year-old pitcher with the Kearney Yankees of the Class D Nebraska State Rookie League.
Four teammates and I had just walked around the corner after leaving a restaurant when we were suddenly confronted, in a menacing way, by eight local tough guys about our age.


FOR THE PANEL, SECORD STIRS ANGER AND QUESTIONS
LEAD: After listening to Richard V. Secord's detailed testimony in the first week of Congressional hearings into the Iran-contra affair, many committee members say they are outraged and amazed by how much the Reagan Administration delegated foreign policy to a small group of covert private operators.


Compassion From Connecticut
LEAD: The stir over the cause of Representative Stewart McKinney's death ought not distract from his achievements as a public servant.
Mr.
McKinney, who died last week at age 56, was a man of compassion.
His constituency for 17 years was Connecticut's ''Gold Coast'' Fairfield County, and he was well to do himself.

RICE UNIVERSITY
LEAD: Rice University presented degrees to 650 undergraduates and 320 graduate students in commencement exercises today.


A NEW JAPANESE NATIONALISM
LEAD: It is a historical truism that the dominant civilizations of history prospered, paradoxically, by an open absorption of alien cultures.
Witness the character of history's greatest cities: Athens, Florence, Amsterdam, New York and, perhaps soon, Tokyo.


BOTANICAL ROCK GARDEN, COMPLETED IN 1934, GETS A NEW NAME
LEAD: A THREE-ACRE rock garden at the New York Botanical Garden last Friday was renamed the T. H. Everett Memorial Rock Garden, in honor of Thomas H. Everett, the horticulturist, author, educator, former director of horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden and creator of the rock garden.

Commercial Property: Sidewalk Newsstands; Retailers Resent Their Bargain-Rent Competition
LEAD: ON street corners of Manhattan, pedestrians dodge, squeeze and shove their way past sidewalk emporiums offering T-shirts, sunglasses, snack foods, cigarettes, jewelry, lipstick, even cotton candy.
Nominally known as newsstands, the establishments pay pennies a day for rent.


LOVINGLY NURTURED FREAKS OF NATURE
LEAD: AT this time of year, when home landscapers are busy seeking out and planting the best small evergreens for their needs, the work of one man has special significance.


New Evidence Linking Alcohol To Breast Cancer
LEAD: For the last 10 years, researchers have accumulated data suggesting a possible connection between drinking and breast cancer.
Two studies published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine made the association seem especially strong.
While past studies have spoken of the possible dangers of consuming more than three drinks a day, the new research indicates that women might be increasing their risk of getting cancer by having only several drinks a week.


In the Region: Westchester and Connecticut; Condos That Are All Work and No Play

LEAD: To the Editor:


Verbatim; Dissenting
LEAD: ' I do not believe that the meaning of the Constitution was forever ''fixed'' at the Philadelphia Convention.
Nor do I find the wisdom, foresight and sense of justice exhibited by the Framers particularly profound.
To the contrary, the government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government, and its respect for the individual freedoms and human rights, we hold as fundamental today.

New Orleans, La.; A Glossy New Anomaly Rises in an Overloaded Market
LEAD: TO the motorist drving along Interstate 10 west of New Orleans, the new high-rise looks as if it just flew in from Dallas, a mirrored monolith above the flatlands.


ECONOMIC BOOM OUT WEST IS MOSTLY INSIDE CITY LIMITS
LEAD: MORE people moved out of Utah last year than moved into it.
The same was true in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon and Wyoming.
The reason: Not enough jobs.


HOSPITALS PITCH HARDER FOR PATIENTS
LEAD: IT worked for Tupperware.
So now hospitals are using the same idea: getting a group of women to gather in a home for games, prizes, refreshments and a sales pitch.
But at the BodyCues women's home health care parties sponsored by the St.
Elizabeth Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio, the pitch comes from doctors and nurses - and what is being sold is nothing less than the hospital itself.


'What Do I Owe This Frail Woman?'
LEAD: MY mother has come again for an extended stay.
She comes now with a home health aide to care for her and tend to her needs, a hospital bed and other assorted paraphernalia of the aged and infirm.
Most of the time she knows she is at my house but she does not always remember why, and there are times when she speaks of her visit as if she were in a hotel.


LAW INTERNS FOCUS ON HUMAN RIGHTS
LEAD: Sixty law students at Columbia University will soon begin jobs as summer interns in an unusual human rights program.


TROPICAL ECHOES
LEAD: Since summer is nearly here, the sun and the swimming season cannot be far behind.
For those women who haven't already found an attractive suit, there are many new ones to choose from.
Sleek in fit, daring in shape and hot in shade, they will certainly light up any beach.
One requisite, though, will be a superb figure.


PROPP SILENCING HIS CRITICS
LEAD: Brian Propp, Philadelphia's version of a tight-lipped Jim McMahon, ran a calloused hand over his latest brush cut, removed his opaque wraparound sunglasses, and considered the spectacle of the black-shirted Flyers gliding through a practic session today.


A LIST OF MAJOR AIR DISASTERS
LEAD: Here is a list of major air disasters before the crash yesterday of a Polish jetliner near Warsaw, in which 183 people died:  March 27, 1977: 582 killed in a collision of two Boeing 747's operated by Pan American and KLM at the airport on Tenerife in the Spanish Canary Islands.
Aug. 12, 1985: 520 killed when a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 crashed into a mountain on a domestic flight.

She is also busy writing other articles that involve the elderly, as well as putting out her monthly newspaper column.


QUEST FOR A FABLED ANCIENT LIBRARY
LEAD: IN 1979 THE WORLD REMEMBERED - WITH EX-hibitions, congresses, publications - the Great Eruption of Mount Vesuvius that, in 79 A.D., buried the Roman towns of Herculaneum, Pompeii and Stabiae, on the Gulf of Naples, under volcanic ash, mud and lava.
Next year will mark the 250th anniversary of the inauguration, at Herculaneum, of systematic excavation of those Vesuvian cities - a development of immense consequence not only for our knowledge of the ancient world but for the influence exerted over archeology, art and science, and over civilized consciousness, by the Vesuvian revelations.

Photography
LEAD: Victor Schrager has never been interested in appealing to the crowd.
Until recently, his photographs consisted of skeletal webs of images appropriated from various webs of images appropriated from various sources, both artistic and commonplace.
Their complex network of meanings, and the daunting air of intelligence that accompanied them, tended to override what decorative appeal the pictures possessed.


QUESTIONS OF OLD AGE AND DUTY
LEAD: A WOMAN I know has put her mother into a nursing home in a town some distance away.
I asked why she had not chosen a place near by.


OILERS EDGE WINGS WITH GOAL AT )0:36
LEAD: Marty McSorley's goal with 36 seconds to play tonight gave the Edmonton Oilers a 2-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings in Game 3 of their semifinal series.


JAZZ: JIMMY WITHERSPOON SINGS THE BLUES
LEAD: JIMMY WITHERSPOON, a veteran blues singer, is singing the blues with more than theatrical emotion at Carlos 1, 432 Avenue of the Americas between Ninth and Tenth Streets.

The Barbie Trial: Not Just Vengeance
LEAD: It's not obvious to everyone that prosecuting Klaus Barbie, the ''Butcher of Lyons,'' is such a relentlessly good idea.

LEAD: When the West Dallas Housing Project was built it was, like most housing in Texas in 1952, unashamedly segregated: 1,500 units for whites, 1,500 for blacks and 500 for Hispanics.
After ''desegregation'' it became all black, like the ghetto that surrounded it.
Now, under an unusual three-way agreement, most residents are to be integrated into suburban apartment complexes and most of the project is to be torn down.

CONCERT: CHAMBER MUSIC FROM MARLBORO
LEAD: MUSIC FROM MARLBORO'S concert Monday evening at Alice Tully Hall brought together eight artists with a shared musical vision.

The study by Wharton Econometrics, a private forecasting concern in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., and Ward's Automotive Reports states that a buying rush to beat tax-law changes in late 1986 - rather than a collapse in consumer demand - was the primary force behind this year's expected sales decline.

ALYSHEBA BATTLING THE ODDS
LEAD: Alysheba's competition in the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Saturday consists of five colts he beat in the Kentucky Derby 13 days ago and three newcomers with skimpy credentials.
The bettors will understandably make him a heavy favorite - but the odds are that he will lose.


TELEVISION NEWS AND THE CONGRESS
LEAD: To the Editor:


Texas, 2 Cheers For Temperance
LEAD: Texas, cowboy-and-pickup-truck division, continues to undergo deflation: As of Sept. 1, drinking at the wheel will no longer be permitted.
The Legislature made the decision by voice vote, without opposition.


A House In the Country
LEAD: At best, Erica Abeel's article ''Magnificent Obsession - A House in the Country'' (April 19) is a subtle treatment of the story, which needs to be told.
That story tells that responsibility for the deteriorating quality of life in the city must be placed on the individuals who are presently obsessed with the great escape from New York.


Jazz
LEAD: Eddie Daniels is coming into the Village Vanguard with a quartet on Tuesday in an unusual glow of encomiums.
He was the No. 1 clarinetist in Down Beat's readers' poll last year, and he also gained a Grammy nomination as the best jazz instrumental soloist.
His reviews have called him ''the most gifted and intensely beautiful clarinetist now recording'' and declare that he is ''bringing  [ the clarinet ]  to a new stage in its evolution.


ALL IN A MORNING'S WORK
LEAD: SOMETHING I cannot forgo is having time in the morning, in bed.
I accomplish it, but with difficulty.
Without this small pleasure, my nerves become jangled by late afternoon and my spirits sag.

LEAD:  FAST FORWARD  Hollywood, the Japanese, and the Onslaught of the VCR.
By James Lardner. 344 pp.
New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $18.95.


If You're Thinking of Living in:; PARK SLOPE
LEAD: JAN HODENFIELD remembers six years ago when a town house in Park Slope could be bought for less than $200,000 and Seventh Avenue was mostly bodegas, cobblers and neighborhood bars.
Today, brownstones cost $750,000 and a Benetton clothing store opened on the avenue in October.


THE BARGAINS IN A BAD MORTAGE MARKET
LEAD: THE April leap in mortgage interest rates did more than raisemonthly paments for new borrowers; it also damaged a pulic confidence in affordable rates that had been building since the autumn of 1984, when rates began their 30-month decline - from 14.5 to 9.25 percent.
Uncertainty has re-entered the mortgage marketplace and that hurts both home buyers and sellers.


Gorbachev Outpolls Reagan in West Germany
LEAD: Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, is more popular and credible in West Germany than President Reagan, according to a flurry of recent opinion polls.


HERE'S TO SEXUAL PHILANTHROPHY
LEAD:  CHARLES FOURIER  The Visionary and His World.
By Jonathan Beecher.
Illustrated. 601 pp.
Berkeley: University of California Press. $49.50.


WHO DECIDES THE COLOR OF MUSIC?
LEAD: WHEN THE NA-tional Association for the Advancement of Colored People examined racial discrimination in the music business recently, its report concentrated on offstage employment opportunities.
For all the visibility and profitability of black performers, the report said, blacks are ''grossly underrepresented'' in the business itself: in record companies, concert promotion, management.


AIDS: SHOULD INSURERS BE ABLE TO TEST?
LEAD: INSURANCE companies want to be free to require individual applicants to undergo laboratory tests designed to detect infection with the AIDS virus.
But several states, responding to complaints of discrimination against homosexuals and concern that some people who have antibodies to AIDS may never develop the disease, have restricted the use of such tests by insurers.


FREEZE AHEAD
LEAD: OUT ON THE EASTERN TIP OF Long Island, where I live, this time of year brings a tidal wave of fruits and vegetables.
It starts in May, with the first sweet peas and tender asparagus, rising to a swell in midsummer with string beans, spinach and multicolored peppers.
By August, the countryside has been inundated with zucchini, tomatoes, corn and yellow summer squash.


AN UNEVEN FILM ABOUT JOE ORTON THAT COULD HAVE USED HIS LEFT HAND
LEAD: THE BEST PLACE TO meet a writer, it has been said, is on the page (or on the stage, or wherever else his work appears).
I don't think the British playwright Joe Orton would have dissented.
At all events, he once told an interviewer that, unlike Oscar Wilde, he thought that a writer should put his genius into his work, not into his life.


A TRADITION THRIVES IN RIDGEFIELD
LEAD: THE restaurant mortality rate being what it is, the 30-year-old Inn at Ridgefield is unusual.
Even more remarkable is that its high performance remains as consistent as ever - even when it changes hands.


Julie Freundlich Becomes a Bride
LEAD: Julie Beth Freundlich, a partner in the New York graphics design firm Dekker Freundlich Babian, and Julius Francis Lang Jr., an associate in the New York law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling, were married yesterday at the Church Center for the United Nations in Manhattan.

Goetz's own videotaped statement about how and why he shot four youths in a Manhattan subway car on Dec. 22, 1984.


THE POIGNANCY OF 'FALLING AWAY'
LEAD: I would like to commend you on publishing Julia Aldrich's ''Falling Away, Here at Home''  [ Opinion Page, April 26 ] .
The subject, a theme that makes most flinch and recoil, is one that is stark, sensitive reality - it moved me to tears.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: AFTER spending 14 acclaimed years as athletic director at North Dakota State, A. L. (Abe) Sponberg probably deserved a rest.
What he got was a new job as athletic director at the University of Wisconsin.
Sponberg, who replaces Elroy Hirsch, called the Wisconsin post ''the ultimate challenge.'' . .


CONCERT: PERCUSSION AND PIANO DUO, AT WEILL HALL
LEAD: WEDNESDAY'S evening of percussion and piano music at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall eloquently reminded us of the polyglot world around us.
Daniel Druckman -tapping, beating, stroking a wild variety of instruments - and Alan Feinberg at the keyboard together called to mind a pair of frantically busy interpreters at a United


Fanny Butcher Dead; Literary Critic Was 99
LEAD: Fanny Butcher, the literary editor of The Chicago Tribune for 40 years, has died at the age of 99.


DANCE: GREGORY'S BEAUTY'
LEAD: THERE are actors' actors and dancers' dancers.
There ought, perhaps, to be a category of performances about performing.
Cynthia Gregory offered a radiant, skillfully danced interpretation of the title role in ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' presented by American Ballet Theater on Tuesday at the Metropolitan Opera House.


TAKE THE GUESTS OUT
LEAD: THE CITY IS HOT, WITHERING HOT, loiter-in-air-conditioned-office-lobbies hot.


HAYDN'S KEYBOARD MUSIC BLOOMS ANEW
LEAD: MOZART AND BEETHOVEN found the piano a major merchandising tool in their struggle for audience recognition.

First, it is important to understand the role of corporations and foundations.


Boston
LEAD: Spring is the season when Boston, which is still a pedestrian's city, slips gratefully from galoshes to running shoes.

On stage, that is.

LEAD: Bach's ''Art of the Fugue'' is one of the great works from the Baroque, a summation of Bach's thinking on contrapuntal writing and a heroic piece of music.

TODAY'S MORALITY PLAY: THE SITCOM
LEAD: IN THE CONTROVERSY OVER TV evangelism, no one seems to have noticed that the most influential preacher in America is not Jim Bakker or Jerry Falwell or John Cardinal O'Connor.
Rather it is Bill Cosby.
Every week his program and some others - ''Family Ties,'' ''Growing Pains,'' ''Mr.
Belvedere'' and ''My Sister Sam'' - present vivid and appealing paradigms of love to vast audiences.


11 SMALLER COMPANIES NAMED 'WINNERS'
LEAD: THEY are growing faster than any other companies in the country.

To eat on the streets of New York this weekend is to understand better than ever how much New

Washington University
LEAD: William G. Hyland, who served as national security adviser to Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter, told graduates at his alma mater Friday that the Reagan Administration should not permit its foreign policy to reflect a trend toward isolationism and protectionism.

TOP BASSISTS ARE THE BOTTOM LINE IN JAZZ ENSEMBLES
LEAD: PLAYING THE BASS IN YOUR own improvising ensemble can put you in the driver's seat, just as a certain rent-a-car agency claims to do.
Of course, not every bassist wants to drive or is capable of handling a careering vehicle.
Not every band wants to be driven, by the bassist or by anyone else.
But the bass has special capabilities, and its role in the jazz ensemble has developed in a special manner.


40 YEARS OF CANNES: GHOSTS AND DREAMS
LEAD: LOOKING RATHER LIKE AN OVER-sized reproduction of Christopher Columbus's flagship, the vessel built for the filming of Roman Polanski's ''Pirates'' is now moored alongside a quay off the old port of Cannes.
From time to time, it's open to the public.
It can be rented for private parties.

RAW OR BLANCHED VEGETABLES, COCKTAILS FOR 70
LEAD: WHAT to serve at a large cocktail party?
Spring vegetables are the answer at this time of year.

Gotham's Groundhog
LEAD: To the Editor:


New Repair Yard Is Opened
LEAD: The Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company opened its $13.7 million repair yard today to trains on the Harlem line.
The 63,000-square-foot center in Putnam County, 52 miles north of Grand Central Terminal in New York City, was built on the site of a smaller diesel repair shop made obsolete with the introduction of electric trains on the Upper Harlem line in June 1984.


EUROPEANS SWITCH TRAINS
LEAD: One era in European railroading is about to come to an end, and a new one is beginning.
For 30 years the Continent has been crisscrossed by some of the best trains in the world, the T.E.E.'s.
The initials stand for Trans Europ Express, and the lack of a final ''e'' on Europe was deliberate.
That was the spelling used for the group of first-class, air-conditioned, extra-fare trains that connected the major cities of Western


Jeffry B. Seidel Married To Leslie Carol Fielden
LEAD: The marriage of Leslie Carol Fielden, an associate in the New York law firm Solinger Grosz &amp; Goldwasser, and Jeffry Bruce Seidel, a manager in the tax department at the Touche Ross Financial Services Center in New York, took place last evening at Federal Hall in Manhattan.
Rabbi David Posner performed the ceremony.


Water Problems And Development
LEAD: It appears quite admirable of Roger Tilles to stress the seriousness of one of the issues confronting us on Long Island  [ ''Arbitrary, Unilateral Caps on Water Use Will Hurt,'' Opinion Page, April 19 ] .
However, one has to wonder where, as a developer who has constructed and proposes additional development in Nassau County, he and other builders have been while these issues were intensifying.


Sid Fernandez Status Unclear
LEAD: The Mets were told by their doctors last night that Sid Fernandez did not suffer cartilage damage in his left knee while pitching Friday night.

Joseph Lynch, a Jesuit priest and longtime scholar of seismology, died of heart failure Thursday at the Murray-Weigel Infirmary at Fordham University.
He was 92 years old and lived in the Bronx.


SHOULD WE CARE WHO WROTE IT?
LEAD: DOES IT MATTER THAT STRAVINSKY WAS A Russian?
If that question strikes you as too obvious to deserve serious consideration, you probably haven't kept up with the hot debate being waged in scholarly circles over two seemingly irreconcilable methods of appraising music.
The argument originally was joined over the narrow musicological question of whether ''The Rite of Spring'' is essentially a tonal or a nontonal work, but has taken on the fervor of a dialectical struggle between Greek philosophers over the nature of the Sublime.


CAUGHT IN THE UNDERTOW
LEAD:  BEST INTENTIONS  The Education and Killing of Edmund Perry.
By Robert Sam Anson. 221 pp.
New York: Random House. $17.95.


A House In the Country
LEAD: At a time that millions of Americans cannot afford homes of their own, in a world in which land is a limited resource, it is appalling that owners of second homes may still deduct mortgage interest from their taxable incomes.

LEAD: Vice President Bush, while insisting that he was not breaking with President Reagan, said today that one of the ''highest priorities'' in the next decade should be helping families finance a college education.


A Dog And His Man
LEAD: What a lovely, deeply affecting piece of writing, and what a lovely man.
How fortunate that fate brought Ben Stein and Trixie together at the animal orphanage.


TAKING THE PERSONAL OUT OF PC
LEAD: THE word ''personal'' is still very much a part of I.B.M.'s promotional campaign for its new line of microcomputers.
But in a very real sense the machines are not personal computers at all, and this may well be the crux of their impact on the future of small computers.


VIOLINS YIELD THEIR SECRETS TO EXPERT
LEAD: TO DARIO D'ATTILI, although ''no two fiddles are or sound alike,'' there is ''not much of a difference'' between one fine violin and another.


TRASH BARGE ENTERS NEW YORK HARBOR, HEADS FOR BROOKLYN
LEAD: The garbage barge that nobody wants was towed into New York Harbor last night but was turned quickly around and anchored in Gravesend Bay off Brooklyn.


EARTH DAY'S VISION: A LONG WAY TO GO
LEAD: THE first Earth Day in New Jersey - April 22, 1970 -served notice to government and industry that the environmental cause had, indeed, become a mass movement.
All over the Garden State, campus organizations and citizens' groups launched cleanup campaigns, recycling projects, educational forums and public rallies.


THE SEASON FOR SETTING OUT PLANTS HAS COME
LEAD: WHAT a glorious spring.
The lawn has never been greener.
Tree blossoms are clouds of pink with the flowers of crabapples, flowering cherries and dogwoods.
Lilacs are in bloom.
Tulips are showing off their regal petals in shades of yellow, orange, red and almost blue.
Even the last daffodils shimmer.


Midblock Oasis: Gift of Sunlight
LEAD: In 1971, a vest-pocket retreat known as Greenacre Park was carved out of the East 51st Street block between Second and Third Avenues.
It has trees, a waterfall and a sculptured fountain, and it has become a neighborhood delight.
But in recent years, high-rise development in the area has threatened to throw shadows over this midblock oasis.


MAN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH NEW CARS IS MORE THAN SKIN DEEP
LEAD: THERE are certain dreads that must be universal among men: the dread of turning and running from the first danger on the battlefield, the dread that a desirable woman will look you straight in the eye and whisper, ''Not so long as you shall live,'' and the dread of the first scratch on your brand-new automobile.


KNOTTY DONOVAN TRIAL WINDS DOWN
LEAD: In a Bronx courthouse accustomed to violent-crime cases it is a rare event: an intricate fraud trial in which two key defendants, former Labor Secretary Raymond J. Donovan and State Senator Joseph L. Galiber, charge they are victims of political persecution.

LEAD: Athletes should not be role models; fathers and mothers should be role models.
E.
P.
HUMPHREY Jr.
Wynnewood, Pa.


MUSIC: PETER SCHICKELE IN AN ALTERNATE MODE
LEAD: It was curious to sit in Washington Square United Methodist Church Wednesday night, along with 30 or 40 other devoted listeners, and hear the music of a man who routinely fills Avery Fisher Hall and Carnegie Hall.
Even more curious to remember how utterly charming he can be in either circumstance, and to wonder bemusedly about the inherent schizophrenia of having a public and private persona.


Packing Too Much
LEAD: THE way the Green Bay Packers' coach, Forrest Gregg, figures it, Donnie Humphrey's ideal playing weight would be 270 pounds, or about 25 pounds under the defensive lineman's listed weight last season.
To help Humphrey trim down, the Packers sent him to a hospital nutrition program, but the 26-year-old player didn't cooperate, Gregg said, citing some weighty evidence.


ROCK: CHRIS ISAAK SINGS
LEAD: SOME rock singers try everything; some specialize.
Chris Isaak, the singer who came to the Bottom Line Tuesday, has narrowed his specialty to a subsection of a subgenre - rockabilly-tinged, minor-key songs about deceitful lovers.
It's a surprise when he breaks into a major key; it's a shock when he straps on an accordion to sing the Louis Jordan hit ''Caledonia Boogie.


ONE MAN'S MOUSETRAPS
LEAD: HIS FRIEND WAS SO SHORT THAT when she was seated at Washington's Kennedy Center her feet barely reached the floor.
Could he, she asked, devise some sort of stool on which to rest her feet?
One day while driving to work it came to him.
You can't walk into a theater with a stool under your arm.
But what about a book?


A 'NEW CENTRISM' QUIETLY CREEPS INTO CAMPAIGN
LEAD: A quiet change under way in American political life - the creation of a new center - may be more momentous in the long run than such attention-seizing matters as Gary Hart's evening with Donna Rice or President Reagan's Iran-contra problems.


Panel May Save A Boston Church
LEAD: THE Boston Landmarks Commission has unanimously recommended landmark status for the interior of a 126-year-old church that was partly demolished in a renovation effort by the Jesuits who own it.


'JOURNEY TO HINDOOSTAN' AT UCONN'S BENTON
LEAD: FEADING Edmund Wilson on the subject of Rudyard Kipling, George Orwell was amazed to find how much of the Anglo-Indian mystique, ''so boringly familiar'' to the British, was ''barely intelligible to an American.''


ALL IN A DAY'S CHORES
LEAD: I will do spring cleaning by cleaning out closets and maybe throwing out junk.
I have nine closets.
I wonder which has the most memorabilia.


THATCHER PLEDGING MORE OF THE SAME STERN STUFF
LEAD: WHEN she called a general election for June 11, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made it clear she was not thinking of serving a few more years and retiring to her garden. ''This is only the third term we are asking for.
There is quite a long way to go,'' she said, hinting that the year 2000 might be a nice time to step down.


IN MYSTIC'S TROVE, TALES OF 19th-CENTURY LIFE AT SEA

The ceremony was performed by the Rev.
Daphne Hawkes, assisted by the Rev.


Indian Museum Hitting the Trail?
LEAD: For more than a decade New York State and city officials have been debating how to rescue the Museum of the American Indian and its more than one million artifacts from the too-small and poorly attended quarters at 155th Street and Broadway it has occupied since 1922.


Two Visions Vie In the East Village
LEAD: AS the spirit of the East Village creeps eastward into the region that runs from Avenues A to D, between Houston and 14th Streets, two distinct yet overlapping identities are emerging.
One is Loisaida, indigenous and struggling; the other is Alphabet City, arty and affluent.


Maltese Policy
LEAD: After years of drifting politically toward Libya, the Mediterranean island nation of Malta is preparing to move closer to Europe, according to its new Prime Minister, Eddie Fenech Adami.
Mr.
Fenech Adami, who took office last week after his conservative Nationalist Party ended 16 years of Socialist rule by defeating the governing Labor Party, said he planned to renegotiate a treaty with Libya to elminate clauses on defense cooperation.


CITIES IN THE SKY, SKYSCRAPERS BY THE ACRE
LEAD: AT a time when most American cities are trying to figure out what to do with hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space no one seems to need, New Yorkers are facing a generation of skyscraper parks laid out not by the square foot but by the block.
Never before have so many gigantic projects been planned simultaneously, underscoring the unrelenting expansion of the city's financial services industry, which seems to devour almost every inch of space that comes on the market.


'THE END IS ONLY IMAGINARY'

AUSTRALIAN, 2 OTHERS TIED FOR LEAD AT COLONIAL

WHEN CATERERS GO ON VACATION
LEAD: LIKE MANY PROFES-sional caterers, Chip Fisher doesn't stop entertaining during his weekends off. ''We usually have between six and a dozen people over for lunch or dinner at least once each weekend,'' said Mr.
Fisher of his summer holidays at the house he and his wife rent near the beach in East Hampton, Long Island.


SUSTAINING WILLIWEAR'S SPIRIT
LEAD: One month ago today, Willi Smith, 39, who designed inventive low-priced sports clothes that became street classics, died of AIDS at Mount Sinai Hospital.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  Little Shark Face  Mothers' love has evolved like everything else, as we can see in ''Bluegill,'' a story in which a young woman strikes an unusual maternal note in talking to her unborn child.

HUMANITY IS WASHED UP - TRUE OR FALSE?
LEAD:  EINSTEIN'S MONSTERS  By Martin Amis. 149 pp. New York: Harmony Books. $12.95.


Was This Objectivity?
LEAD: To the Editor:


Making It Easy For Yourself
LEAD: EASY IS A LOVELY WORD.
AMONG ITS DICTIONARY DEFINI-tions one finds even nicer words: ''free from constraint,'' ''comfortable,'' ''carefree,'' ''unhurried.'' All evocative of what a summer should be.
And how a host or hostess should feel about summer entertaining.
But the reality is that most of us look on a summer party as a chore - the beach beckons, the hammock lures, the dolce far niente of warm months takes over and sociability goes on hold until fall.


The Latest Crop Of B&amp;B Guides
LEAD: The shelf for researching bed and breakfast accommodations grows crowded.


IN CHARLESTON, A 20TH-CENTURY PRESERVATION BATTLE
LEAD: In this city renowned for its well-tended colonial history and rows of carefully restored antebellum mansions, the battle over historical preservation has moved for the first time into the 20th century.


TOUCHING THE 19th-CENTURY ADIRONDACKS
LEAD: ''The Sunday Rock was the rock everybody passed on their way into the park, on their way into the Adirondack wilderness back in the old days.
Once they passed that rock, Sunday could be Wednesday, Tuesday could be Saturday.
You lost account of time.
It didn't matter, because once you were in the woods, you were on a different time, in a different frame of mind, everything.


Panel Split Over Job Rights Ruling
LEAD: For the first time in more than three years, conservatives lost their tight control of the United States Commission on Civil Rights last week.

RAW OR BLANCHED VEGETABLES, COCKTAILS FOR 70
LEAD: WHAT to serve at a large cocktail party?
Spring vegetables are the answer at this time of year.

BOOKED FOR THE SUMMER
LEAD: FORGET the gold that was discovered in Cobalt last year; the hottest commodity in Connecticut this summer is waterfront rentals.
They are almost impossible to find and more costly than ever.


REAGAN SAYS HIS EFFORT TO PROMOTE THE REBELS WAS RIGHT - AND LEGAL
LEAD: THE disclosures came in bits and pieces last week, buried in the impassive, often disjointed testimony of Robert C. McFarlane, President Reagan's former national security adviser.
But they added up to a new picture of the President's role in the Iran-contra affair, a picture very different from that drawn by the Tower Commission last February.

BATTLE RAGES TO PRESERVE COLLEGE IN NEW ORLEANS
LEAD: The sedate social clubs of upper-class New Orleans are abuzz this spring with an unusual issue for the time and the place: The rights of women, specifically Newcomb College women.
The issue has caught on as the proposed Federal equal rights amendment never did.


Stephanie Jane Mairs Weds Dr. Nitin Damle

IN PARIS, A FACE LIFT IN GRAND STYLE
LEAD: WHEN THE ENGLISH QUIBBLE about plans for new public buildings in London, the arguments are esthetic.

Directed by Josef von Sternberg, based on his story. 1932.
MCA Home Video. 89 minutes. $29.95.


VERMONT PICKS BEST STUDENT WRITERS
LEAD: It seemed like a typical school event: 20 students, dressed casually in jeans and T-shirts, or loose skirts and blouses, sat in a littered classroom, hunkered over blue examination books as two teachers in tweed jackets watched the clock tick toward the time limit.


Breeze McMennamin to Marry in July
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.

A BLEND OF DRAMATIST AND PROPHET
LEAD: ''YOU can be either a prophet or a rabbi - but not both.'' Melvin Cooperman of East


GOING AFTER THE INDISCRIMINATE SPENDER
LEAD: AS POPULAR as exotic fruits have become, they are still small potatoes at many supermarket cash registers.
Mr.
Kemp of Super Valu, for example, says they account for just 1 percent of total fruit sales at his stores.


A Dog And His Man
LEAD: I am getting fed up with stories such as this, in which the author uses any excuse (in this case, his dog) to publicize his accomplishments in life, how well off he is and what a fine and charming wife he has.
I mean, who really cares?
MIRIAM N. ALLARD  New York City


IT'S 'EMBARRASSING' TIME FOR PADRES
LEAD: PERHAPS a pivotal run that the Pittsburgh Pirates scored against San Diego one night last week epitomized the kind of season it has been for the pathetic Padres.


U.S. PRESSES VOUCHER PLAN AS A RENT AID
LEAD: COMMUNITIES in the county are being urged by the Federal Government to use a new rent-subsidy system that could make more housing available to homeless and low-income people but that would require them to pay more than the 30 percent of their income they are paying now in rent.


A House In the Country
LEAD: I continue to be surprised that New Yorkers have never heard of the eastern part of Connecticut.
We, too, have nice old houses yearning to be restored, and we have, at least at the moment, brooks with cowslips and forget-me-nots and orchards with bluebirds and lovely views.
I persist in believing the climate is much nicer than on the other side of the river.


The Seclusions of Men-Only Clubs and Purdah
LEAD: To the Editor:


Fishing Yields Soviet a South Pacific Toehold
LEAD: This quiet archipelago of coconut palms, sandy beaches and tropical jungles makes an incongruous front in an East-West confrontation.


AFFORDABLE HOUSING: ANOTHER VIEW
LEAD: Herbert Mandel is missing the mark when he blames advocates of low-density housing on Long Island for the area's lack of affordable housing  [ Letters to the Long Island Editor, April 19 ] .


'42d STREET STAGED IN EAST WINDSOR
LEAD: SHOWMANSHIP, glitter and a distinctive directorial imprint don't just embellish the quintessential backstage fairy tale, ''42d Street,'' they define it.
The 1933 film is identified by its splashy Busby Berkeley production numbers, the stage version turned out to be a testament to the effervescent style - and spectacular career - of its director and choreographer, Gower Champion, who died the day the show opened on


BUY ME SOME SOFTWARE AND CRACKER JACK
LEAD: JUST after Jim Ray Hart, the third baseman for San Francisco, grounded out to end the seventh inning in the last game of the 1965 season, the phone rang in the press box at Candlestick Park.
It was Herman Franks, the manager of the Giants and a man of few words, calling from the dugout. ''And?'' he rasped.

ALBANY DUCKS A RENT CONTROL CONFRONTATION
LEAD: IT promised to be a dramatic showdown over one of New York's most bitterly contested issues.
With only days remaining before the May 15 expiration of the state's rent regulation statutes, legislators were besieged by lobbyists.
Tenant and landlord groups took turns busing thousands of angry, placard-waving supporters to

LEAD: A tentative decision by executives of the American Cancer Society last month to move the 74-year-old agency from New York has stirred dissatisfaction at the society's headquarters in Manhattan and touched its officials around the country.


USE A MICROWAVE
LEAD: THE ARRIVAL OF WARM WEATHER and weekend guests is an ideal time to take advantage of a microwave oven.
This handy appliance does not heat up your kitchen, cooks rapidly and lets you make festive dishes quickly after a late return from tennis or the beach.
And although microwave ovens are not appropriate for every recipe, many foods cook as well as, or better than, they would in a conventional oven, and in a fraction of the time.


Lynne Queenan Is Wed in Washington To Philip Henry Michael Beauregard
LEAD: Carrie Lynne Queenan, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
John Thomas Queenan of Washington and of Jeffersonville, Vt., was married yesterday to Philip Henry Michael Beauregard, a son of Mrs.

His elegantly flowing bronzes, true to their material and engaged in the kind of dialogue with tradition that was unthinkable in the 60's and 70's, are hip enough to raise eyebrows and challenge some of the strictest modernist taboos.

THE EVENING HOURS
LEAD: THE bright balloons and paper streamers flying outside the American Museum of Natural History Tuesday night were a tip-off.
Inside the Theodore Roosevelt Rotunda, there was no doubt at all.
This wasn't a conventional benefit dinner.
A popcorn stand was on the left, waiters were offering miniature pizzas and the huge space was ringed with displays of exotica - electric fish, poison dart frogs, the skull of a saber-toothed cat and flesh-eating beetles working on an owl skeleton (not the most popular exhibit).

Tackling the Global Farm Ripoff
LEAD: A new international report says it plainly: The industrial countries currently waste $100 billion a year on farm subsidies.

Lessons of the Stark, Not All Costly
LEAD: Cheap Exocet missiles crippled the frigate Stark this week and devastated the British destroyer Sheffield in the 1982 Falkland war.
But these products of 1960's technology are not magic weapons.

The question is why the Stark let down her guard and why, once hit, damage and casualties were so heavy.

CONCERT: JUPITER SYMPHONY
LEAD: VICTOR HERBERT supported himself as a cellist before ''Babes in Toyland'' and ''Naughty Marietta'' made his fortune, and he wrote a good deal of music for his instrument.
No one would be surprised to find in it a wealth of gracious melody; in his E minor Concerto - revived Monday by Joel Krosnick and the Jupiter Symphony in Alice Tully Hall - there is also an arrestingly angular main theme and substantial symphonic development and construction.

RECITAL: MORDECAI SHEHORI, PIANIST, AT MERKIN HALL

His playing is by no means technically flawless, and at several moments during the concert he pressed fast tempos beyond manageability or played so quietly that notes became inaudible.


CHANGES IN STORE FOR YANKEES
LEAD: There was a distinct sense of emptiness as the Yankees ate their postgame meals in silence and packed their duffels Wednesday night in preparation for the final stop on a trip through the West.

CAETANO VELOSO PERFORMS NEW SOUNDS FROM BRAZIL
LEAD: CAETANO VELOSO, who has been one of Brazil's most influential and durable singer-songwriters since the late 60's, says he was skeptical when associates suggested a solo concert in New York City. ''Alone?
With just my guitar?
In New York?
I didn't feel technically or professionally prepared to do something like that,'' he recalled earlier this week.


Comment on Hearns
LEAD: ''I am not involved in any negotiations regarding Thomas Hearns for the proposed Bobby Czyz fight,'' said Dennis Talbert, a spokesman for Hearns's manager, Emanuel Steward, in denying that Hearns would challenge Czyz for the International Boxing Federation light heavyweight title.

LEAD: As a devoted fan of many forms of auto racing I think that auto racing is a dangerous sport by nature.

SUMMER ESSENTIALS
LEAD: MEN THINK first about how they look, then they worry about how they feel,'' says Richard Lane, a proprietor of Latham House, the Manhattan and Long Island clothier.

A Fee, Not a Ban, on Audio Progress
LEAD: Ever heard of digital audio tape recordings?
Most people haven't, and never will if the recorded music industry has its way.

WAITING FOR THE BOOK: STORMS BEFORE THE CALM
LEAD: EIGHTEEN months generally elapse nowadays between the time a publisher accepts a manuscript and its appearance in book form - the gestation period of an elephant.

ART: 'THE HELGA PICTURES,' BY WYETH
LEAD: Andrew Wyeth's ''Helga Pictures,'' which begin their two-and-a-half-year, six-stop national run today at the National Gallery of Art, are not that disturbing in themselves.
In this suite of works, which amounts to around 15 to 20 percent of the artist's output during the last 15 years, Mr.
Wyeth is what he has always been -a sometimes admirable, sometimes moving, invariably problematical figure whose work reflects the principles and problems of

HAS AUTO RACING BECOME TOO DANGEROUS?
LEAD: Professional drivers choose their livelihood fully cognizant of the risks of the malfunction or incorrect design of the machines and the condition of the track.

CONNECTICUT OPINION
LEAD: THE fashion arbiters have decided low-heeled shoes will be in style soon.

AIDS FEARED AS OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD
LEAD: FEDERAL officials said there was no reason for alarm when the Government last week reported three cases of health care workers infected with the AIDS virus after brief exposure to the blood of infected patients.

IN COURT, ANGER, DISBELIEF AND A CRY OF 'J' ACCUSE'

LEAD: Philip Boffey's article brought back memories to me, the first physician on the new Sloan-Kettering payroll, when Dr.

Marks is quoted as saying, echoes what Dr.

California Gives Boost to Methanol
LEAD: California, which led the country in requiring stringent smog controls for automobiles in the 1960's, has taken another big step toward cleaning up its polluted air.
In what environmentalists hope will prove the impetus for a nationwide movement, state officials said last week that they would promote the replacement of gasoline with methanol, a form of alcohol that is abundant and less polluting.


Perspectives: Nonprofit Institutions; Handling a Project Without a Developer
LEAD: WHEN a nonprofit institution in Manhattan sets out to make use of the full development rights inherent in its land, it normally allies itself at an early stage with a developer.


Do Not Go Gentle
LEAD: It seems to me that Dylan Thomas was advising not so much the manner of one's going as how to be - ungenteel - while going.


HAS AUTO RACING BECOME TOO DANGEROUS?
LEAD: Auto racing has always been dangerous, but the sophistication of today's safety systems has helped offset the danger posed by what seems to be an annual increase in racing speeds.
It should be remembered that practice laps, where there is no other traffic to slow down driver and car, are very different from actual race conditions where dozens of cars are on the track.


PTL Ministry Raises $100,000

A RIOT OF ROSES
LEAD: EIGHTY YEARS AGO, THIS PENNSYLVA-nia rose garden was planted as a laboratory by Edwin Rosenbluth, a Philadelphia chemist who became well-known as a manufacturer of garden spray.

The Price of Leadership
LEAD: When members of the New York City Council voted recently to increase the salaries of other top New York City officials, they couldn't resist throwing in a hefty raise for themselves.

A 'Liaison' Lament
LEAD: To the Editor:


A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
LEAD: WHEN the city of Chicago and eight equity partners teamed up in March 1986 to open a business incubator called Enterprise Place, the building was filled within a month.

IN THE END, FLYERS FIND DETERMINATION UNDOES OILERS' FLASH
LEAD: There is criticism that the Philadelphia Flyers have a robot-like quality about them.

SYRIA AIDE SAYS LIBYA BOUGHT FRENCH HOSTAGE
LEAD: Islamic fundamentalists holding foreign hostages in Lebanon have sold at least one of their French captives to Libya, a senior Syrian officer was quoted today as having said.


JOE PUTS NIEKROS IN RECORD BOOK

Greitzer Assails Rent-Roll Checks
LEAD: City Councilwoman Carol Greitzer of Manhattan has introduced a resolution condemning a state plan to cross-check computerized rent rolls against income-tax returns.

LEAD: AN empty nest on Memorial Day!
With four participating children in our family, we've stood at attention for a lot of village parades.


AT GOLDEN GATE, A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR BRIDGE, 50
LEAD: In some circumstances a mile is a long way.
In the 1920's, at the entrance to San Francisco Bay, in a channel of savage tidal currents, ocean waves and rushing winds, within 12 miles of a major earthquake fault, a mile seemed unbridgeably long.


NEW JERSEY GUIDE
LEAD:  4-DAY TASTE OF GREECE  Authentic Greek dishes will be the centerpiece of ''Greek Festival '87, a Taste of Greece,'' Thursday through Sunday at the Community Center of St.
George Greek Orthodox Church, 1200 Klockner Road, Trenton.


Stern Stuff
LEAD: To hear her critics tell it, W. Ann Reynolds runs the 19 campuses of California State University with an iron fist inside a steel glove.
Dr.
Reynolds, chancellor of the 335,000-student system since 1982, was accused earlier this year of verbal brutality in her treatment of Richard Butwell, who died of a heart attack two weeks after she suggested he resign as president of the Dominguez Hills campus.


DVORAK -COSMOPOLITAN NATIONALIST
LEAD: ANTONIN DVORAK IS CELE-brated at once for being a musical proponent of Czech (or pan-Slavic) nationalism and for his cosmopolitan career.
After he achieved fame in his late 30's, his services as composer and professor were much in demand all over Europe, Britain and the United States; indeed, some of his most popular works were conceived in

Saturday night at 9:15 and 11:30 at the Lone Star Cafe, 61 Fifth Avenue, at 13th Street, Rockin' Dopsie and the Cajun Twisters will play zydeco - the accordion-and-washboard-powered bayou dance music that's part Cajun, part Caribbean, part blues and part rhythm-and-blues.


A PAINTER WHO LENDS FIRE TO THE GODS
LEAD: AT THE MARIAN GOODMAN GAL-lery, 24 West 57th Street, there can be seen through June 4 an exhibition, that is not like any other.
In the big room, there are exactly two paintings, on the theme of Isis and Osiris.
One measures roughly 11 feet by 18 feet.
The other is a little larger.
They are huge, therefore, and they are also dense and dark and, at first sight, cryptic.


Broadcast TV
LEAD: Neatly timed to get viewers through the normal summer drought of quality programming, ''The Jewel in the Crown'' is being revived on public television's ''Masterpiece Theater.'' The 14-part series reopens with a special two-hour episode Sunday at 9 on Channels 13 and 49.
Based on the Paul Scott novels known collectively as ''The Raj Quartet,'' this British mini-series, made for Granada TV, has been justifiably showered with international awards.


WHERE WAGONS HEADING WEST LEFT THEIR MARK
LEAD: It is a quiet place, ignored on most maps, home to a few songbirds and a thousand memories.
A couple of weathered signs might steer the extremely curious traveler from the middle of Guernsey, a small southeastern Wyoming community, south past the Sunrise School and just across the North Platte River.


Q AND A
LEAD:  A C.P.I.
LEASE CLAUSE  Question: I have a small retail business in Queens.
My landlord is prepared to give me a new lease for 10 years at $325 per month with a 5 percent annual increase.

I would like to renew my lease but before I do I would like to know if a C.P.I.


WHAT'S NEW IN BUSINESS INCUBATORS
LEAD: CARLOS MORALES says he can hardly keep pace with the demand.
To hear him tell it, the National Business Incubation Association, the group he heads, has been so deluged with requests for information that callers complain they cannot get through on the phone lines.
Everybody, it seems - from California colleges to


HOW CONGRESS CREATED A CABLE MONSTER
LEAD: WHEN he was alive and robustly effective as the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Robert Kerr used to rise heavily to his feet in the Senate chamber and declare that ''I am against all monopolies'' - slight pause - ''that I'm not a part of.'' America has never approved or allowed monopolies - except, as with utilities, under the restraint of public agencies.


VERMONT MEASURE ALLOWING STATE TO COMPETE WITH POWER UTILITIES
LEAD: Fearful of losing its allocation of low-cost Federal power, the Vermont Legislature has passed a bill that allows the Vermont Department of Public Service to buy electricity from any source and to sell that power to any customer.

LEAD: Public debate over the Whitney Museum's expansion plans has opened with a focus on whether razing a row of adjoining brownstones would clear the way for piecemeal dismemberment of historic districts in New York City.


Dance
LEAD: Claire Porter and Lisa Kraus, two choreographers who can make incisive comments on the world around them, are both presenting works this week.
Ms.
Porter's creations are as deftly constructed as epigrams, and because her small-scale productions can work in large spaces and small, she calls her dances ''Portables.


KIT CARSON SLEPT HERE
LEAD: Six hundred dusty miles out of St.
Joseph, Mo., pioneers crossed a low rise on the plains of eastern Wyoming and came across a welcome sight.
There in a saucer-shaped valley was a lonely outpost known as Fort Laramie, a cluster of rough-hewn buildings in a vast and forbidding wilderness.


THE CONSTITUTION'S 200 YEARS HAILED WHERE IT ALL STARTED
LEAD: In a happy, sometimes boisterous celebration of the United States' chancy, uncertain origins and its present-day power and unity, the major phase of the Constitution's bicentennial got off to a rousing start Friday night and today.


HELP FOR A DAY, OR EVEN AN HOUR
LEAD: JUNE LAVELLE has been managing the Fulton-Carroll incubator since the Industrial Council of Northwest Chicago opened it in 1981.
At first, the rent included a receptionist/secretary (Ms. Lavelle), meeting rooms and loading docks.
Council members volunteered help when tenants had management problems.


FOR A NICARAGUAN, THE MIAMI OPTION
LEAD: On a sunny morning last January, Maria Azucena Ferrey was leaning against a jeep waiting for an anti-Sandinista protest march to begin.


VIEWING IT ALL A FEW YEARS LATER
LEAD: I WAS sitting down to breakfast and the newspaper one Sunday morning when the telephone rang.

VISTORS JAM THE CITY'S SIDEWALKS - AND CASH REGISTORS
LEAD: THE continued decline of the dollar may be causing shudders on Wall Street, but in the hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions of Midtown Manhattan it is a source of joy.
New York City, while seeming to be ever more expensive for its own residents, is becoming something of a bargain for foreign visitors, and they are flocking here in near-record numbers.

LEAD: Disregarding the protests of defense lawyers, a judge in the Bronx refused yesterday to declare a mistrial in the fraud case of former Labor Secretary Raymond J. Donovan.


POINTS OF INTEREST UPCOMING
LEAD: THROUGHOUT most of the regular season, it is the southern half of the county that gets most of the concert business, but in the weeks before summer programs get under way, Tarrytown and points north are often the musical places to be.


THE FARCE, BEAUTY AND PASSION OF RAMEAU'S 'PLATEE'
LEAD: ''I DON'T THINK BAROQUE opera is about to displace the 19th-century variety in popularity,'' admits Grant Llewellyn, the 27-year-old British conductor who will lead the American premiere of Rameau's ''Platee'' this evening at the Spoleto U.S.A.

More Power To the Scorer
LEAD:  To the Sports Editor:


THE GIANTS RING IN THEIR '86 INSTANT REPLAYS
LEAD: LIKE little children, the Giants stared at their Super Bowl rings, smiling at the dazzle of the diamonds.
In the blue stone, a miniature replica of the Vince Lombardi Trophy sparkled - a three-quarter-carat diamond in the shape of the football atop the trophy, nine other diamonds forming the base of the trophy.


Do Not Go Gentle
LEAD: William Safire's article ''The PAWs That Refresh'' (On Language, April 26), on allusion catching, does indeed remind us of one of the few delightful pastimes that is low calorie, tax free and harmless to the environment.
When he wanders from citation into literary criticism, however, he spoils the fun.


Mr. Dole's Hunger Politics
LEAD: One of the Reagan Administration's wiser foreign policies supports the nominally Marxist but increasingly pragmatic Government of Mozambique.
Still, some right-wing extremists would prefer backing the Mozambican insurgency financed by South Africa.
The nomination of a new U.S. ambassador to Mozambique offers them an opportunity to press their case.


Turks Celebrate Their Day
LEAD: Marchers in the sixth annual Turkish-American Day Parade yesterday in Manhattan.
The parade moved down Avenue of the Americas to 47th Street and on to Dag Hammarskjold Plaza for a rally. (NYT/Fred R. Conrad)

CONNECTICUT GUIDE
LEAD:  TWAIN'S SOUVENIRS  When Mark Twain and his Hartford neighbor, Harriet Beecher Stowe, traveled abroad, they bought the tourist souvenirs now on exhibit in the basement gallery of the Twain House at 77 Forest Avenue.
The exhibition is a collection of some 40 items picked up around the world by Twains and his family, the Stowes and their relatives, the Beechers and the Days, all of whom inhabited Nook Farm, as the compound was called, and by Charles Dudley Warner, Twain's collaborator on the writing of ''The Gilded Age.

Woodson Off Track
LEAD: HE was the favorite to win the 110-meter hurdles at the Big Ten track and field championships, but when the meet began at Iowa yesterday, Purdue's acclaimed athlete, Rod Woodson, was not among the competitors.
On Friday, Woodson, a star defensive back who was a first-round draft choice of the Pittsburgh Steelers, was disqualified from the championships by the Big Ten commissioner, Wayne Duke.


A LESSON IN THE CAIRO HUSTLE
LEAD: My first day in Cairo I was offered 10,000 camels, 2 donkeys, a horse and 20 shekels to marry a rather charming Egyptian named Sharif.
Actually, the two women I was traveling with were offered the booty as they were the only ''family'' Sharif could find to bargain with.
He read my palm - ''Let me see your hand, no, no, the clean one'' - in an alley cafe, four chipped Formica tables tilted toward the drain.


AUCTION FEATURES POSTAL HISTORY
LEAD: AN auction of manuscripts and United States postal history will be held on Saturday at the Hilton Hotel in Danbury, Conn.

Streetscapes: The Dakota Stables; A 'Soft-Site' Garage on the Booming West Side
LEAD: THINGS look peaceful on ''stable row,'' a collection of a dozen public and private garages, most of them former stables, on Amsterdam Avenue from 75th to 77th Streets.
But to a developer it is really a collection of sites crying out for development: old, low buildings, with no residential tenants, that are not landmarks - and are right in the middle of the fashionable West


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC: Behind America's Lens on the World.
By Howard S. Abramson. (Crown, $17.95.) Howard S. Abramson's unauthorized history exposes the not so very dark side of a venerable institution and its phenomenally successful publishing arm.
Among those aspects of the National Geographic Society we may not read about in the authorized version - due out next year, to coincide with the society's centennial - are the magazine's relentlessly sunny attitude, which gave rise to such travesties as a glowing report on Nazi Germany published in 1937, and a 1962 article about South


IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR: THE UNFOLDING STORY
LEAD: A parade of secondary figures -expediters, contributors and one beneficiary of aid to the Nicaraguan rebels - testified at last week's Congressional hearings on the Iran-contra affair.

REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST
LEAD: ROCK-AND-ROLL IS MORE than 30 years old, and its roots reach back further than that.
It's a tradition now, not just rude teen-aged rebellion.
But with its deliberate formal limitations - rock is simple, danceable, hummable music - there is a crisis of originality in rock.
What is original may not be rock any more; what is stereotypically rock may seem boring.

GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS, BUT WILL IT CONTINUE?
LEAD: The economy grew at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, better than the previous estimate of 4.3 percent, and far better than the 1.1 percent rate of the fourth quarter of 1986.

REUNION TACTICS FOR THE FAMILY
LEAD: If you drew the short straw and are in charge of the family-reunion arrangements, I sure hope it's for the 1988 season.

A Spurt in Early Human Evolution?
LEAD: In the conventional view of early human development, evolution occurred steadily and gradually over millions of years.

DEVICES TO PROTECT CAR STEREOS

MOREL CONQUESTS
LEAD: ''THE INORDINATE APPETITE for mushrooms is considered to be a French disease,'' observed an anonymous author in the 17th century.
The same statement could be made about Americans in the 20th century, who recently seem to have developed their own inordinate appetite for all kinds of wild mushrooms, partly because improved modern shipping allows cooks to use such exotic produce within hours of its being picked.


Bad Wine, Good Times
LEAD: Several years ago, I informally presided over a dinner party of seven in the San Francisco area (''The Returns Are In,'' by Frank J. Prial, Wine, April 26).
I did not know the wine (it had been selected by committee vote), and it was probably not far off (and after a stiff rum punch and a mild case of sunstroke, could I really tell?), but it seemed off enough to force a snap decision: ''I'm sorry, but I must ask to try another bottle of this.

HOW A GENIUS FUSED ADORNMENT AND MODERNITY
LEAD: IT WAS LOUIS SULLIVAN'S SAD FATE not only to have been insufficiently appreciated in his time - he died in 1924, broke and without work - but also to have been misunderstood later on.
For even when there was no doubt about his status as one of the greatest architects America has ever produced, Sullivan was too often thought of as having had one crucial flaw: he was a brilliant modern polemicist who filled his buildings with lavish ornament.


NEIGHBORS RISE IN VETERANS' GROUPS
LEAD: THREE residents of Windham are gaining prominence as leaders of the largest veterans' groups in the state.

STRANGE STATE FOR JOHNSON

LEAD: There are some sections of New York in which the only way you can tell the season is by the temperature.

There are fewer dismal vistas these days, thanks to Operation GreenThumb, now entering its 10th year of bringing life and color to blighted neighborhoods.


IN PRAISE OF BLACK-AND-WHITE PRINTS
LEAD: I suppose I should admit it: I shoot more black-and-white film than I do color.
This makes me a bit of a dinosaur, since 95 percent of the pictures now taken in the United States are color pictures.
But despite color's universal appeal, there remain a few diehards to whom the tones of black and white are as beautiful as any colors.

IN NEW JERSEY, A GROWING SENTIMENT FOR LIMITING GROWTH
LEAD: THE old roads that wind through the tree-lined villages and small farmsteads of central New Jersey are still marked as scenic routes on some maps, but with the growth of the area in recent years, the principal view seems to consist of the bumper and brake lights of the car in front.

YOUTHFUL PRESS CORPS LEARN ROPES IN NEWARK
LEAD: THE journalistic ethics involved in the articles that ended Gary Hart's bid for the Presidency may be debated for years; however, if Chad Peterman had been assigned to the story, Mr.
Hart's candidacy might have been salvaged.


THREE-RING SHAKESPEARE
LEAD: JUDGING BY ITS FASHION, COLOR and ornament, as William Shakespeare might have put it, the ''Comedy of Errors'' now previewing at the Vivian Beaumont Theater would seem to be quite the merry demolition of the Bard.
After all, this is the vaudeville version of ''The Comedy of Errors'' -the production that transforms Shakespeare's town of Ephesus into a circus's winter quarters, where characters polish their acts while performing their lines.


ZEN AND THE ART OF NOODLE MAKING
LEAD: THE REST OF THE WORLD may see Japan as a nation of workaholics, but not Juzo Itami.

The Ommegang takes place in Brussels every year in early July.
This year July 2 is the regular night for the pageant, but this time there is an extra performance.


The Marshall Plan
LEAD: If it can put politics aside for a few minutes, Europe will be celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan on June 6, but it's not likely to remember the little band of valiant men who helped put that European recovery program together.

All Eyes on Her
LEAD: IT BEGAN IN A RESTAURANT in Portofino.
She walked in ahead of me, a classically beautiful young woman with a mass of red hair tumbling around her shoulders.

THE SOVIET MISSILE STRATEGY MAKES THE FRENCH NERVOUS
LEAD: GIVEN France's general coolness toward NATO, it is not usual for a French Prime Minister to suffer diplomatic abuse for something the Atlantic Alliance might do.
But that is what happened on Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's visit to Moscow, which ended last weekend.
Mr.
Chirac was publicly upbraided for being the West's strongest critic of the Kremlin's plan to eliminate Soviet and American short-and medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe, even though France has no such missiles on its own soil and is not part of NA

Hill Town

We tried the fried artichokes the article praised and if anything, we'd say the writer was too restrained!
Delicious.

DANCE: ALL ABOUT CASTANETS
LEAD: THE history and musical range of the castanet may not sound like the most exciting of subjects.
But the Matteo EthnoAmerican Dance Theater's ''Castanets in Concert,'' pre-sented on Thursday at the American Museum of Natural History, offered an informative and highly entertaining look at that ancient instrument.


PRUNE NOW FOR NEXT SPRING'S BLOOM
LEAD: THIS is the time to keep pruning shears out.
Shrubs that have been established for some time become too large for their spaces and should be disciplined by cutting them back.
Cut back to near ground level and do not leave ugly stubs.
This type of rejuvenation done promptly will invigorate shrubs and allow them sufficient time to form flowers for next spring.


WEATHER REPORT: YUCKY
LEAD: WHAT'S IT LIKE out today?'' ''Yucky.'' You reach for your raincoat and begin a search for your overshoes (which you used to call rubbers before that word became a euphemism for condoms), because you know that yucky means ''inclement'' (a word most often meaning ''stormy,'' based on the opposite of the Latin clemens, ''lenient, mild'').


Mideast Conference? Yes, But First ...
LEAD: What should Israel and America do: Seize the opportunity now to move toward peace?
Or stonewall virtually every effort to trade peace for territory?
Israel's bitter rivals, Prime Minister Shamir and Foreign Minister Peres, put forward these choices.
Neither makes sense.


Ft. Greene Conversion: Griffin Co-op
LEAD: A griffin - a mythical animal that is half eagle and half lion - still looks down from the facade of the Griffin, an 18-story building in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, as it has since 1931.

WHAT GOES UP CAN COME DOWN -- AND WITH DISMAYING SPEED

TREKKING TO PLACES KNOWN TO FEW
LEAD: ROLLING downhill in the battered blue Volvo to Port Jefferson past the harbor. . .
For a minute I feel things open up - there's a flash of Monterey, Calif., in the corner of my memory; memories of last summer's vacation, the land opening out over the water.
I'm quickly easing my way uphill, and the first specks of pale green spot the open sky at the hill's top - spring!

SHOULD THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE BE LAW?
LEAD: IMAGINE, IF YOU WILL, ONE Congressman looking over Dan Rather's shoulder, while another snoops about Peter Jennings.
Imagine, further, an incumbent on the phone to his local station, complaining that the 6 o'clock news is being too kind to the candidate running against him.
Actually, none of this takes a great leap of imagination.

STEPPING INTO THREE DIMENSIONS
LEAD: Perspective was always a problem for me in art classes.
Sometimes I would capture it successfully, but just as often there would be a false, unsatisfying depth to a drawing or a painting that would leave me keenly frustrated.
I would shrug my shoulders and mumble something about the Egyptians and Picasso having had the same problem.


QUANDARY FOR THE JUDGE: TO START ALL OVER OR NOT
LEAD: Justice John P. Collins swept motions aside, grappled with ambiguity in the law and resolved a legal dilemma over the objections of defense lawyers yesterday, all with one apparent overriding objective: moving the fraud trial of Raymond J. Donovan and his co-defendants forward.

LEAD: The past impresses itself on every visitor to Rome, just as the sky-scraping present spellbinds a visitor to Manhattan.

TROUBLES IN INDIA ERODE POPULARITY OF GANDHI

Championship.


In Venice, Keeping the World Afloat
LEAD: ''The only good thing about this summit is that it's in Venice - and Venice is sinking.'' This gloomy assessment by an official helping to prepare next month's meeting of the leaders of the seven main industrialized democracies is somewhat off the mark.
Because of Italy's corrective action, Venice is no longer sinking, but because of the political paralysis of the summit leaders, the world economy is.


One Tough Bench
LEAD: THE Sacramento Kings will have a pair of Hall of Famers on their bench next season.
Willis Reed, the former all-star player and head coach, will join the Kings Tuesday as an assistant coach to Bill Russell, who last month signed on with Sacramento for seven years.

Preserving a Mix Of Rich and Poor

LIGHTS UP! LIBRETTOS OPEN! ENJOY!
LEAD: TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, say the French, is to forgive everything.
Perhaps that even applies to opera singing.
Unfortunately, audiences at staged productions all too rarely have the opportunity to test the validity of that maxim.
For good theatrical reasons, they must be kept literally in the dark.


How to Rent Reality
LEAD: Apparently, the idea has been around for some time, but happily I managed to avoid it until the ad appeared in the paper: surrogate staffs for surrogate bosses.

COUNTRY MUSIC IS ROAMING FAR FROM ITS ROOTS
LEAD: COUNTRY MUSIC LEFT HOME long ago.
It took its heritage -Celtic ballads and fiddle tunes, backwoods hymn-singing and square-dancing, Western swing's echoes of jazz and blues, hints of Cajun and Tex-Mex music, the twangs of down-home singers and guitarists - and moved out of the South and West, reaching listeners and performers from Canada to Great Britain to Nigeria.


CORRECTIONS

'OF PAPTER, PGIMENT AND GLASS' FROM PERSPECTIVE OF AN ARTIST
LEAD: Artists make good curators because, for them, choosing art is not too remote from making it.
This is not to disparage the professionals who would instruct the viewer or prove a point with their choices.
But it is to say that a show without a curatorial cause can be very bracing. ''Of Paper, Pigment and

The Palestinian Campus
LEAD: If these Palestinian students really want to have freedom, they should develop responsible leadership to negotiate with the Israelis in accordance with the Camp David accords.

CITICORP SUCCUMBS TO THE INEVITABLE
LEAD: CITICORP'S decision to take a $3 billion reserve against its third world loan portfolio is in every way welcome, as a sign of rationality at our largest bank and as a signal that the private lenders are prepared to make a real contribution to clearing out the channels of the world's trading system, which have been clogged much too long with garbage debts.


SECTARIAN TENSION IS ON THE RISE IN INDIA
LEAD: New concerns about growing sectarian tension in northern India were fueled this week after at least 63 people were killed and hundreds were injured or arrested in rioting between Hindus and Moslems in the capital and nearby Meerut.

LEAD: Nancy Reagan told the graduating class of the Georgetown University School of Medicine today that there is no excuse for drug abuse in the medical profession.
She asked the new physicians to watch for drug problems among their patients and their colleagues.


Classical Music
LEAD: Massed amateur American choruses are not everyone's cup of tea, especially those used to the surer, more solid English choral tradition or, on the rare occasions when they can be encountered in this country, large professional choruses.
Still, amateur choruses can make up in fervor what they lack in tonal focus, and when they are well conducted in the right repertory, the results can be pretty exciting.


3 Found Slain in Restaurant
LEAD: Three employees of a Wendy's restaurant were shot to death before the restaurant opened for business this morning and were not found until another employee arrived for the lunch-time shift, the police said.

THE LEGACYOF MISS ALBERTINA BLOOM, TEACHER AND BENEFACTOR
LEAD: ALBERTINA BLOOM, of course, never thought of herself as a little person, although she was not very tall.

They are people who flirt with the truth.
Or maybe they just have serious memory lapses, or are born under an extraordinarily benign star.
Because it isn't possible to believe that there truly are beings, particularly New York beings, who don't have to have a lot of things done twice.

KITTENS: CUTE, CLEAN AND $1,141.50
LEAD: KITTENS.
The classifieds were full of advertisements for adorable, cuddly, fluffy, baby cats.
As I skimmed past the columns of kittens, looking for good deals on household items, I realized the best deal was staring right at me.
My daughter's birthday was just weeks away and we still had not decided on a gift.


Philadelphia and Denver Winnow Mayoral Aspirants
LEAD: W. Wilson Goode and Frank L. Rizzo will be opposing each other at the polls for the second time this fall, since Philadelphians gave them equally impressive primary victories last week.


Outdoors: Casting Away Doubts
LEAD: YOU will have heard - if you bother to listen - anglers prating about how catching fish is really less important than the quest itself, than feeling the wind in their hair or listening to a lovely stream's sweet song.


FOR THE ASHANTI IN U.S., A NEW KING
LEAD: For a few short hours this weekend, Ghana, the West African nation of 13 million people, was re-created in the ballroom of the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan.


Ellen Frankfort, 50, Is Dead; Author on Feminist Issues
LEAD: Ellen Frankfort, the feminist author, died early yesterday at Long Island's Southampton Hospital.
She was 50 years old and lived in Sag Harbor, L.I.


Breeding Success
LEAD: When industry supplicants go to Albany to beg for legislative handouts, they generally tell such heart-rending economic sob stories that the lawmakers have to get out their handkerchiefs to wipe away the tears.
When a delegation representing the state's thoroughbred breeders made such a trip a few weeks ago, it was the breeders who had to pull out their bandanas - to wipe the smiles off their faces.


INSIDE
LEAD: Regulating Cabs of All Hues  New York City officials are striving to regulate gypsy cabs and other nonmedallion vehicles.
The effort could make it easier to find a taxi -but not always a yellow one.
Page 21.

Machine Tool Orders Declined 20.9% in April
LEAD: New orders for American-made machine tools fell 20.9 percent in April from their March level, the National Machine Tool Builders' Association said in a report to be released today.

Syrian Officer Denies Linking Libya to Purchase of Hostage
LEAD: The chief of Syrian military intelligence in Lebanon denied today that he said Moslem kidnappers had sold a French hostage to Libya, Beirut radio stations reported.


Where Should the Third World Turn?
LEAD: Citicorp's startling decision to write off $3 billion in third world loans has angered competitors with shallower pockets.
Comparable write-offs, they argue, would cut sharply into their capital reserves and dash hopes for settlements that might permit additional loans to debtor nations.
Yet if they don't follow


CITY BALLET: BALANCHINE'S 'UNION JACK'
LEAD: Created in 1976 in response to this country's Bicentennial, George Balanchine's ''Union Jack'' rather perversely but amusingly celebrated the British Empire with a ballet changing of the guards.
And Hershy Kay wove together British traditional tunes to make a colorfully, grandly nationalistic musical score.


The Gooden Sideshow
LEAD: THE Mets open a road trip in San Francisco today, but Dwight Gooden will be working out at Shea Stadium - alone with himself and his future.
Tomorrow night and again next Sunday, he is scheduled to pitch for the Tidewater farm team.
And a week from Friday night against the Pittsburgh Pirates, the 22-year-old right-hander is expected to stride to the mound at Shea Stadium, accompanied by cheers of encouragement.


JAMES J. DELANEY, 86, A DEMOCRAT AND FORMER QUEENS CONGRESSMAN
LEAD: James J. Delaney, the former Queens Congressman whose three decades in Washington catapulted him into the chairmanship of the powerful House Rules Committee, died yesterday at his son's home in Tenafly, N.J.

The Worm and the Apple: Wired; Javits Center, Electrified
LEAD: Managers of New York's 13-month-old Javits Convention Center deserve credit for responding swiftly to disclosures of payroll discrepancies involving electricians who work on exhibits at the center.


Summer Market Rally: Inevitable or Mythical?
LEAD: Summer is upon us, and post-Memorial Day thoughts are turning to vacations, tennis, the beach, swimming pools and the inevitable stock market rally.
The inevitable stock market rally?
Laszlo Birinyi, the statistical guru at Salomon Brothers, says that there is always a summer rally.
He also says the ''rally'' has the same relevance to real life as current airline schedules.


A 1,000-YEAR-OLD CULTURE WITH FEW TOMORROWS
LEAD: On a chipped sheet of blackboard leaning against the cinnamon-colored dry-mud wall, Tian Rujun chalked the poem ''Seeking a Recluse in Vain,'' by the ninth-century poet Jia Dao:  Let's ask the lad beneath the pine tree.
He said: My master has gone to gather herbs.
He is somewhere on this mountain,  But so thick are the clouds,


BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, MAY 25, 1987
LEAD:  THE ECONOMY


AT WELFARE HOTEL, PEDIATRIC CARE ON THE PREMISES
LEAD: The narrow corridor on the second floor of the Prince George Hotel was crowded with young mothers holding babies in their arms and balancing other children on their laps.
Some had appointments, but many others had simply shown up.
They were all waiting to take their children into a place that exists in no other New York

LEAD: Amy Maude Grabino, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Harold Grabino of New York and Orange, Conn., and James Kenneth Landau, a son of Dr. and Mrs.

A.Russell Ayre, a Congregational minister, performed the ceremony.


CALIFORNIA'S DARING THRIFT UNIT
LEAD: Until it was acquired by Charles H. Keating Jr. early in 1984, the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., was a quiet little institution suffering like many others through a downturn in the traditional business of home lending.


Linda R. Snow Wed to Barrett Z. Gross
LEAD: Linda Ruth Snow, an account executive for El Diario/La Prensa, a Gannett newspaper in New York, and Barrett Zinn Gross, a merchandising manager for Illuminating Experiences Inc. in Highland Park, N.J., were married yesterday afternoon at the home of the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Robert M. Snow, in Darien, Conn.


The Peace Conference
LEAD: Every diplomatic effort has its logic, and the next logical step in the process of trying to arrange an international peace conference on the Middle East may be taken when American and Soviet officials sit down for a periodic review of Middle East issues.


MICHELIN'S ANNUAL BEST SELLER
LEAD: When thousands of Americans descend on France this summer, many will no doubt be toting the tourist's bible: the Michelin Red Guide to Hotels and Restaurants.


Carol H. Buttenwieser Weds

Lawrence B. Buttenwieser of New York and North Salem, N.Y., and Dr.

Rabbi Linda Henry Goodman performed the ceremony at the home of the bride's paternal grandparents, Mr.


SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS
LEAD: Coming Up Short It's not that Carl Larsen is an especially impatient sort, but as the executive director of the Kentucky Harness Racing Commission, he's come to the conclusion that many of the sport's fans and potential fans are.
They would enjoy harness racing more, he figures, and more of them would come to the track, if the races didn't take so darned long - as much as two minutes for the average trotter or pacer to cover a mile, the standardbred distance standard.


Mothers, Fathers, Forefathers
LEAD: Jim Wright, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, sought the other night to deliver a funny response to a glowing introduction, but not many people laughed.


DODGERS 8, METS 6
LEAD: Instead of letting yesterday's 8-6 loss to Los Angeles plunge them into deeper dejection and despair, the struggling Mets should look at the positive lesson that came with the game: If the Dodgers could overcome their base-running buffoonery and win the game, there is hope for everybody, including the


DIM HOPES FOR SUMMIT TALKS
LEAD: The seven-nation industrial summit conference that President Reagan will attend next month in Venice is likely to prove unusually modest in its achievements despite the long agenda of issues, analysts and officials report.

LEAD: Leo Castelli outlasted Gone West to win the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park yesterday, a race that earned the top two finishers a trip to the Belmont Stakes and made Gone West look especially impressive in defeat.


Dismembered Body Found
LEAD: The dismembered body of an unidentified man was found in plastic garbage bags in front of Sandra's Restaurant at 5 St.

LEAD: Confident that the financial and other problems that rocked it in the 1970's and early 1980's have been solved, Yale University's new president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., has begun laying out priorities for what he calls a ''new era in Yale's history.''

LEAD: Nearly 60 years ago, Babe Ruth was bargaining with the Yankees over the same $80,000 salary that a borough president now makes.


In Search of A Cause
LEAD: The ardor of the wealthy people who gave money for a plane and military supplies to the White House contra cause is a reflection of the broader attempt by hard-liners to take foreign policy out of functioning international relations.


POSTSCRIPT ADDED TO RETIREES' CAREERS
LEAD: For 15 students who graduated yesterday from the College of New Rochelle's lower Manhattan campus, there will be no panicking over job interviews or last-minute writing of resumes.


RECITAL: IRISH TENOR
LEAD: If you don't especially like the sound of an Irish tenor - clear, reedy, sweet, penetrating and somewhat nasal - you surely wouldn't have liked Frank Patterson's recital Friday night in Carnegie Hall, because all the traditional characteristics are quite marked in his singing.
If, like this listener, you have an affection for the style and the songs that go with it, a visit to his next local appearance is warmly recommended.


Banks Need Sensitivity In Latin Debt Talks
LEAD: To the Editor:


SUNY-Binghamton
LEAD: Commencement ceremonies were held in two parts yesterday at the State University of New York at Binghamton.


The Worm and the Apple: Wired; A Shrewd Power Play
LEAD: New York City's biggest handicap in attracting or keeping electricity-hungry businesses is the ruinously high cost of power, compared with that above the city line or across state borders.
Higher taxes explain some of the discrepancy.
New York takes 22 cents of every Con Edison dollar.
New Jersey utilities pay only 14 cents.


70% OF PAROLED YOUNG ARE ARRESTED
LEAD: About 7 in 10 young adults paroled from prison were arrested again at least once for serious crimes within six years, the Department of Justice said today.


EXPELLED ARTIST SEEKS PAINTING HELD BY THE K.G.B.

LEAD: Karen Susan Heiko and Dennis Man-Hei Wong were married yesterday at the Colby Chapel of the Andover Newton Theological School in Newton Center, Mass., by Rabbi Albert Ginsburg.


ALL OBSTACLES FALLING FOR SCHOOLBOY PITCHER
LEAD: EVENTS - like his fastball -are moving at a fast pace, sometimes faster than Willie Banks would prefer.
The recent past, the times he would spend playing stickball in the neighborhood schoolyard, seems like an eternity ago, among the few carefree moments in a difficult childhood.
Then, Banks pretended to be Reggie Jackson, hitting sponge balls over the schoolyard fence that he and his brothers would have to scale in order to get in.


MUSIC: CAETANO VELOSO
LEAD: Caetano Veloso started to shake up Brazilian music in the late 1960's, when he and some Bahian cohorts created the pushy, rock-tinged ''tropicalia'' style.
At the time, tropicalia was seen as a rebellion against the cool, jazzy bossa nova.
And in previous New York appearances with his band, Mr.
Veloso has raised a celebratory ruckus.


A NEW STAND OVER CONTRAS
LEAD: President Reagan's recent assertions that a Congressional ban on aid to the Nicaragua rebels in 1985 did not apply to his National Security Council or national security adviser directly contradict detailed statements to Congress in 1985 on how the Administration was complying with the law.


Chanting for Iran
LEAD: Every few weeks an Iran-related demonstration takes place in the streets of Washington.
Sometimes it is in favor of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and sometimes it is against.
In either case, passers-by usually pay little notice.
But ears picked up last week when a pro-Khomeini group marching by the White House sounded the cadences of an American sports cheer familiar to anyone who has attended a high school football game.


President of Cox Calls Appointment a Surprise
LEAD: James Cox Kennedy has been named president of Cox Enterprises Inc., assuming command of one of the world's largest privately held media companies.


OFFICIALS SEEK MAJOR CHANGE IN TAXI POLICY
LEAD: New York City is in the midst of a drive to regulate gypsy cabs and other nonmedallion vehicles, an effort officials say will enhance the industry's image and could make it easier to find a taxi - although not necessarily a yellow one.


New York City's Inhuman Dimension
LEAD: In November 1975, my oldest son was bar mitzvah in ''the near perfect symmetry'' of a 19th century architectural landmark.

LEAD: With about half of its members destined to be a freshman class, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is likely to take on a new tone in coming months.


IN BRITAIN, BATTLE IS ON FOR COMPASSION VOTES

The New, and Democratizing, Soviet Middle Class
LEAD: A major realignment of class power is taking place in the Soviet Union.


Bishop Finis Crutchfield, 70; A Methodist, Victim of AIDS

Vassar College
LEAD: The playwright John Guare and Adele Chatfield-Taylor, director of the design-arts program of the National Endowment for the Arts, who are husband and wife, addressed those attending the 123d commencement of Vassar College yesterday in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
Some 570 graduates received degrees in a colorful ceremony that included the faculty in full academic regalia and the traditional 150-foot Daisy Chain, a century-old Vassar tradition.

LEAD: One patient was killed and five others were injured, two critically, in a fire in a geriatric ward at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island last night, officials said.


AFTER YEARS OF FROTH, AARON SPELLING GETS SERIOUS
LEAD: ABC will present ''Cracked Up,'' a drama about a teen-age track star's addiction to crack, a potent form of cocaine, Tuesday night at 9.
One of the most surprising aspects of the film is that it was produced by Aaron Spelling, who is best known as a purveyor of glamorous escapism.


NEWS SUMMARY: MONDAY, MAY 25, 1987
LEAD: INTERNATIONAL 2-5, 24  Gulf nations should provide bases and other support for aircraft that would patrol the Persian Gulf, protecting oil tankers and their naval escorts Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said.

RULER OF KUWAIT SAYS WAR SPILLS OVER FROM GULF AREA
LEAD: The Emir of Kuwait, which is seeking both United States and Soviet protection for its oil tankers, has said the growing Gulf War threat to shipping should be a matter of ''international concern.''


90 YEARS OLD, THE FORWARD STILL CRACKLES
LEAD: The Forward, which helped hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants understand the often baffling life they found in America, is 90 this year.
And while it surely is not as robust as it once was, its step is still spry and its Yiddish voice can still crackle with indignation.


THATCHER'S WEALTHIEST CRITIC
LEAD: David Sainsbury, one of Britain's most respected business executives and one of its wealthiest individuals, is precisely the type of person expected to be applauding Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's free-enterprise vision of the nation's future and supporting her Conservative Government in next month's general election.


OPERA: UPDATED 'SALOME' AT SPOLETO
LEAD: With their ''Salome,'' Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier have provided a good argument against the radical restaging of opera.
The two young directors, who work principally in France, have brought their new production of the Strauss opera to the 11th Spoleto Festival U.S.A. here.
The setting is a greenhouse belonging to Herod, in this incarnation a wealthy, drunken German industrialist from the 1930's.


WEINBERGER URGES BASES IN GULF AREA FOR U.S. AIR PATROL
LEAD: Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said today that the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf should provide bases and other support for aircraft that would patrol the waterway, protecting oil tankers and their naval escorts.


University of Texas
LEAD: Speaker of the House Jim Wright urged University of Texas graduates to work for a just society and for an end to the nuclear arms race.


DANCE: 'DON QUIXOTE'
LEAD: Mikhail Baryshnikov's 1978 staging of ''Don Quixote'' returned to American Ballet Theater this weekend at the Metropolitan Opera House.
If the major debuts in the season's first two performances are an indication of how spiritedly the ballet will be performed in the future, then new life has obviously been breathed into a so-called old warhorse.


Inquiry Panel Members Want to Recall Secord
LEAD: Members of the Congressional committees investigating the Iran-contra affair say they want to recall Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force officer who became an arms dealer, to clear up discrepancies between his version of events and those of later witnesses.


FOR TOWN AND TEAM, HONOR IS ITS OWN REWARD
LEAD: For Coach Cleveland Stroud and the Bulldogs of Rockdale County High School, it was their championship season: 21 wins and 5 losses on the way to the Georgia boys' basketball tournament last March, then a dramatic come-from-behind victory in the state finals.


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: An Associated Press list Wednesday of casualties aboard the frigate Stark incorrectly listed the hometowns of three crew members.

In addition, the first name of Mr.


FORDHAM AND RIDER DEFEATED
LEAD: Somehow, the inferiority complex common to Northeastern teams in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's baseball tournament had seemed to vanish from the Fordham dugout.


The Sixth Man
LEAD: It was Bob Cousy and such teammates as Joe Mullaney and George Kaftan who received the lion's share of the acclaim when Holy Cross won the college basketball championship in 1947.
So much, in fact, that all five starters have been inducted into the Holy Cross College Athletic Hall of Fame, as has the coach, Al (Doggie) Julian, who received an honorary induction last year.


Penelope Stone Is Wed To Steven J. Campbell
LEAD: Penelope Farrington Stone, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
James Boething Stone of New York and Darien, Conn., and Steven Jeffrey Campbell, a son of James Mulford Campbell of Yellow Springs, Ohio, and Mrs.

TV: CHANNEL 13 SHOWS 'HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES'
LEAD: Television has been doing exceptionally well by stage plays recently.

Wyman and Beech Get New Leaders
LEAD: James S. Walsh, president and chief executive officer of the Raytheon Company's Beech Aircraft Corporation subsidiary in Wichita, Kan., has been named president and chief executive officer of the Wyman-Gordon Company.


In Harm's Way
LEAD: The case for keeping a U.S. naval force in the Persian Gulf is summed up as (1) a superpower must maintain the principle of ''freedom of the seas'' everywhere; (2) we must not allow Iran to cut off the flow of oil to the Western democracies and Japan, and (3) unless we honor our decades-old commitment to protect the gulf, the Soviet Union will eagerly move into the vacuum and take control of the oil shipping lanes and the

Ralph M. Freydberg of Stamford, Conn.
Rabbi Morris Friedman performed the ceremony.
The bride is a graduate of Syracuse University.


LAKERS' WORTHY NOW PLAYING WELL
LEAD: The nuances that make for the success or failure of a team are often rooted in actions that have little to do with conditioning, practice, or even skill.
And they do not always occur between the time the athletes report for training camp and the end of their season.
Sometimes, a reassuring conversation between two teammates during the off season can make the difference between months of conflict or months of contentment.


Ousted Premier of Fiji Balks at a Compromise
LEAD: Timoci Bavadra, who was deposed as Prime Minister in a coup 10 days ago, refused today to work with an interim Government backed by the military.

YANKEES 10, ANGELS 8
LEAD: The manager took another deep sigh of relief as he began to undress.

Channell's Diet
LEAD: Members of the Congressional committees investigating the Iran-contra affair may see a leaner witness than they were expecting when Carl R. (Spitz) Channell testifies next month.

GUIDRY FALTERS IN STADIUM RETURN
LEAD: Ron Guidry came home last night to cheers that are typically reserved for some kind of returning war hero.

LEAD: TEXAS INSTRUMENTS, the giant semiconductor manufacturer, lost money in 1983 and 1985 and was barely profitable last year.

Dangerous Until Proved Innocent
LEAD: Everyone is presumed innocent until proved guilty but not every defendant is entitled to release pending trial.
Murder suspects, for instance, are locked up.
The law will always find a way to hold a suspect so mad or so murderous that the usual rules must be waived.
Still, America's very sense of justice turns on the noble presumption of innocence; the exceptions should be rare.

President, a Canada at peace with itself, aware of its diversity and resolved to recognize it with respect, tolerance and generosity.

Back in Style on the Beat
LEAD: Except for their first nine years, when all they wore was a star pinned onto any old thing, the New York City police have been snappy dressers - the spit and polish of their outfits reflecting the discipline of their work.

FILM: 'UNFINISHED BUSINESS'
LEAD: VIVECA LINDFORS is the writer, director and star of ''Unfinished Business,'' which looks and sounds like a monodrama, though there are a number of other speaking parts in it.
The film, a project of the Directing Workshop for Women, of the American Film Institute, is an intensely self-absorbed, self-referential work about Helena (Miss Lindfors), a great actress attempting to come to terms with herself and her dedication to the theater, thus ''to justify my time on earth.

The gleaming white 440-foot vessel - one of the largest under sail in the world - dominated not only the harbor, but the local social scene as well.


FRAGILE TRADITIONS OF MUSIC SURVIVE FOR CITY LISTENERS
LEAD: ON the surface, New York may seem like no place for musical traditions to make themselves heard.

The U.N. Today: May 29, 1987
LEAD: GENERAL ASSEMBLY


'ATHENS, GA.,' ON ROCK BANDS
A NUMBER of the musicians seen in ''Athens, Ga. - Inside/Out'' point to Pylon as the best band in town, but Pylon isn't even operational any more.
The group, according to one member, ''just decided to quit while we were still having a good time.'' Formerly art students, the band members now hold odd jobs; the lead singer, a dynamo on stage, works in a copying shop. ''But I never planned on being a musician, so it's no big loss in my life,'' she said.
Bear in mind that Pylon, having played several shows with U2 and begun to get some big-city bookings, stood on the verge of stardom while throwing in the towel.
In Athens, Ga., which is the subject of Tony Gayton's bright, scrappy new documentary, this kind of attitude makes more sense than it might in other places.
The musicians who are interviewed and perform in concert sequences display a uniformly easygoing attitude toward mainstream success.
Some of them have made it (like the B-52's, senior statesmen of the Athens scene, and R.E.M.), and some have little chance.
But they all share an appreciation for the friendly and comforting cultural atmosphere of Athens, and for the energy and eccentricity that have put the place on the map.

LOBBYING FOR A MUFFIN: STATE MAY FAVOR APPLE
LEAD: There are bills that advance slowly through the State Legislature, assisted by arm-twisting and deal-making, and there are those that simply sail through on the strength of a little home cooking.

If the tulips have not bloomed well in recent years, dig up bulbs and discard; order new ones for planting in fall; finish pruning spring-flowering shrubs; cold soil has persisted and given tardy gardeners time to sow grass seed or set in sod; continue asparagus harvests from three-year-old plants or older; snap off spears at ground level just before cooking.

A COLORFUL CORNER OF PENNSYLVANIA
LEAD: Only in the latter half of the eighteenth century did settlers from Connecticut begin clearing the land in the wooded northern hills of Wayne County, Pa.

LEAD: Morton Hunt's useful article ''A Common-Sense Guide to Health Insurance'' (May 3) needs to be considered in this larger context: Why does the world's wealthiest nation indulge in a health system so chaotic, expensive and inefficient that such guides are necessary?

OF TIME AND THE TRAIN
LEAD: ''When does your flight leave?'' my young acquaintance inquired as our Philadelphia convention drew toward a close.
For a split second I considered an evasive answer, then decided to brave it out: ''I rode the train.'' My friend's fleeting grimace probably mirrored her inner conclusion: any American in the 1980's who deliberately wastes 48 hours on a train trip to and from a professional meeting must ipso facto be phobic, indigent or verging on senility.

Sophisticated Sailer

LEAD: FEW industry groups have displayed more erratic stock market behavior than the biotechnology companies.
After last year's swing from favor to neglect, the shares of most companies in the industry sprang back strongly in the first few months of 1987.

EDUCATED ILLEGAL ALIENS BLOCKED FROM AMNESTY

PUNGENT HAMS OF SMITHFIELD
LEAD: It's no secret that the tiny southeast Virginia town of Smithfield produces a particularly lusty ham, for the pungent, smoky evidence smacks your nose as soon as you cross the town line.
The reputation of this most distinctive of country hams has kept it in demand by both outsiders and locals for centuries, from Colonial days when settlers discovered that salt curing and prolonged aging would keep pork almost indefinitely.


CHILDREN SEEK ARCHITECTURAL TREASURES
LEAD: THEY were sharp-eyed sleuths who would let nothing escape them - not a bracket, not a pilaster, not a single fancy shingle.

THE RELEASE OF the Beatles' ''Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' as a compact disk (Capitol CDP 7 46442 2), exactly 20 years after the album appeared, will usher in the anniversary of the ''Summer of Love,'' when the hippie spirit seized Western culture.

Wiping Out Foxes On Aleutian Island
LEAD: AS the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service saw it, if the Aleutian Canada goose, an endangered species, was to thrive again on the Aleutian island of Kiska, it was necessary to turn back the ecological clock.

Herlinde Koelbl
LEAD: To the Editor: As your headline says, Linz, Austria, does ''Cast a Spell'' (Travel, April 5).
An interesting industrial-historic city, it and its suburbs straddle the Danube with economic and tourist bustle.

HOUSING GROUPS ATTACK ADS USING ONLY WHITES
LEAD: The dominant use of white models in real-estate advertisments is increasingly coming under attack by open-housing groups and public-interest lawyers in New York and elsewhere.


TRAVEL
LEAD: In much the same way as the top executives at Levi Strauss are reputed to wake in a cold sweat each morning wondering whether anyone is going to want their products anymore, booksellers must wonder whether the apparently insatiable demand for travel books will suddenly come to an end, leaving them with enough stock to build a chain of covers from Kansas to Katmandu.


Correction
LEAD: A brief article on the theater page in some copies of the Arts and Leisure section today about the acting teacher Sanford Meisner omits a name from the list of surviving members of the Group Theater of the 1930's who are still active as teachers.

HOW WILL FANS REACT TO GOODEN'S RETURN?
LEAD: Putting aside Dwight Gooden's baseball statistics that have made him a superstar; putting aside his brushes with the law; putting aside his connections with drugs, guns and women, Dwight Gooden will be greeted with the most thunderous applause yet to be heard in Shea Stadium as he strides to the mound for his first game since being suspended.


The Crippled Genius

A small brook chatters, and fluffy clouds float in a cerulean sky.


SWIMSUITS: FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
LEAD: IT'S time someone revealed the harsh truth about new swimsuits.
I adore every tiny ritual of spring except buying a new swimsuit.
There is, of course, the usual disgruntled acceptance of winter's contributions to one's figure.
Like others, I, too, stand in the dressing room and resolve to diet.
I then rush home for a soothing bowl of ice cream to prop up my damaged ego.

THE AVANT-GARDE'S HORIZONS WIDEN
LEAD: OFTEN ASSAILED FOR BEING hermetic, for stressing style at the expense of substance, the theatrical avant-garde is increasingly expanding its vision and displaying a heightened awareness of science, history and politics.
At the same time, conceptual directors are, to a greater degree, employing - and commenting on - other arts in their theater work: painting, sculpture, puppetry, modern dance and music, film and video.

TV EVANGELISM IS SATIRIZED IN 'SALVATION!'

Five years ago they went all-out for their 16-millimeter send-up of Big Business, ''Vortex,'' which was shown at the New York Film Festival.
Now, on her own, Beth B has directed ''Salvation,'' a comparatively ambitious (35-millimeter), mini-budgeted satire of television evangelists so topical that it could have been made yesterday, which is also the way it looks.

ROCKIN' CHAIR COUNTRY
LEAD: A drive through the mountain town of Hendersonville, N.C., can be deceiving.
In some wooded neighborhoods, amid two-story antebellum homes and leveled yards, it's hard to believe you're close to the summits of the southern Appalachian mountains.
Not a peak breaks the soft, hilly landscape to remind you.


TO END BASEMENT DAMPNESS, ADD A PROPER DRAINAGE SYSTEM
LEAD: IN most cases, dampness in a basement is due to poor drainage of surface water around the outside of the house, or to excess accumulation of ground water in the soil around the outside of the foundation.

This is a paradigm of the best of American society.

NEW YORKERS, ETC.
LEAD: IT doesn't require any particular brilliance to know why thousands of dogs are named Rover, or why carloads of cuddly white cats answer to the name of Snowball.

On Tour With Rock Hudson
LEAD: It's distressing to think that so many Americans are uncomfortable with the idea that homosexuals might be so masculine as to be unrecognizable.
When will they realize that gays might be their doctors, lawyers, sports heroes, garage mechanics or brothers?

TO END BASEMENT DAMPNESS, ADD A PROPER DRAINAGE SYSTEM
LEAD: IN most cases, dampness in a basement is due to poor drainage of surface water around the outside of the house, or to excess accumulation of ground water in the soil around the outside of the foundation.

WHY A LOW SAVINGS RATE ISN'T ALL BAD
LEAD: PERSONAL saving is the part of your paycheck that is left over after taxes and all the bills are paid.
For most Americans struggling to make ends meet, it will come as little surprise that saving amounts to a small share of income.

SO LONG CARS, HELLO PEOPLE
LEAD: BUD CLARK, the tavern owner who became Mayor of this Oregon city in 1984, pedals his bicycle to City Hall most days, but he seldom draws so much as a second glance from pasers-by.

Short Is Chic
LEAD: In the grand scheme of things, skirt lengths are not important (''Why Short Is Chic,'' by Carrie Donovan, Fashion View, April 26).
Short may be chic for those women who have nothing better to do than lunch at Le Cirque. (Although I, for one, find scrawny middle-aged women in mid-thigh creations pitiful.) However, in the business world, the length of a woman's skirt is important.
