Q. &amp; A.: ALIGNING A DOOR LATCH BOLT
LEAD: Q. Ever since we did some remodeling on the first floor of our home, the door to our bedroom, which is on the second floor, will not stay closed when we shut it.
The door closes all right and doesn't rub or stick, but the lock doesn't seem to engage - in other words, the latch bolt doesn't seem to snap into the opening in the metal plate on the door frame.


DENVER
LEAD: Every day this summer, scores of vacationers will pass through Denver without stopping for so much as a tank of gas.
They are hungry for the West, and for most of them, the West is somewhere high in the Rocky Mountains, not down in the glass and steel canyons of Denver.


Q and A
LEAD:  Tax on a Swapped Co-op  Question: My husband and I would like to swap our co-op apartment for a residence in Italy for about six months beginning next May.
We plan to sell it shortly after we return.
However, we are concerned that this swap might be construed as a sublet for the purpose of the 1 percent New York City real-estate transfer tax.

LEAD: In an effort to head off racial violence, New York City has formed a new unit to keep a close watch on brewing tension in its neighborhoods.


A Call to Workable Arms
LEAD: No administration in peacetime has funded defense as generously as has President Reagan's.
Yet the performance of the armed services when called to action has too often fallen below the high standards the services expect of themselves.
In Lebanon, Grenada, Libya and now the Persian Gulf, the military execution of civilian policy has been flawed by failures of command, training and equipment.


China Says Tornado Killed 16 And Injured 442 in Northeast
LEAD: A tornado swept through three counties in northeastern China on Friday, killing 16 people, seriously injuring 442 and leaving 13 others missing, the New China News Agency reported today.


BET TWICE EDGES ALYSHEBA
LEAD: Bet Twice held off Alysheba's late charge by just a neck today to win the $500,000 Haskell Handicap at Monmouth Park.
It was an exhilarating chapter in their continuing rivalry and one that set the stage for yet another rematch in their duel for the 3-year-old championship.


Her Serendipity Was Writing About Biology With Elegance and Wit
LEAD: In the late 1960's Helena Curtis was working part time for the Rockefeller Institute as a freelance writer and also raising two children.

Bad Marriage
LEAD: Margaret Thatcher won applause from free marketeers for selling the state-run British Airways to private shareholders.

Massachusetts, Angered by Terrorism, Raises Tuition for Foreign Students
LEAD: Foreigners studying at public colleges and universities in Massachusetts face huge tuition increases this fall as a result of legislation signed last month by Gov.

Behind the Saudi-Iranian Tumult, Political and Religious Frictions
LEAD: The crisis that has erupted between Saudi Arabia and Iran after violent clashes Friday in the holy city of Mecca is a consequence of considerable political and religious frictions between the two largest countries on the Persian Gulf.


WHEN BUYING HEALTH CARE IS LIKE BUYING BREAD
LEAD: YOU may remember Jack Riley.
He played the paranoid hypochondriac Eliot Carlin on the old ''Bob Newhart Show.'' When the ConnectiCare Health Plan needed a new spokesman, what better example of a medically afflicted layman would there be than Mr.
Carlin?


Steering Clear Of Street Scams
LEAD: In June the Florence area jewelers' guild sent a letter to the United States Consul General in that city deploring operations in which guides steer tourist groups into shops offering only overpriced wares.
The English translation provided by the Florentine artisans was not perfect, but the import was clear:


Developers Find Benefits in Offshore Construction
LEAD: USING technology from the flagging offshore oil industry, and inspiration from the development of property along the water's edge, entrepreneurs are tapping the potential of floating structures.


SHE TOOK THE AIDS TEST
LEAD: Dena Kleiman and other extremely low-risk individuals should stop obsessing and donate a unit of blood.
The testing is free, confidential, accurate and will be repeated every eight weeks, with each donation.
This would help replenish the donor pool depleted by an ill-informed public, as a result of AIDS panic.

LEAD: Prime Minister Giovanni Goria's new Government overcame its first parliamentary hurdle today, comfortably winning a vote of confidence in the Senate.

A Raft of Plans That Try To Dispel Math Anxieties
LEAD: ''So many girls in my math class moan and groan that it's just too hard,'' said Susie Casente, a high school senior in Morgan City, La., and a past participant in the Summermath program at Mount Holyoke College. ''Girls are expected to be dainty and not work hard.
And because math is hard work, a lot of them consider it unfeminine.

Polydor 831 384-2 Y-1.


TWO LUNCHES FEATURING FRESH PRODUCE
LEAD: SOMETIMES the idea is not to be original or creative in the kitchen, but merely to be expedient and to satisfy.
The goal is easier to accomplish in summer, when fresh produce is at its peak and the hot weather requires bright refreshment instead of hearty sustenance.


JET DEFENSIVE LINE STARTS IN A RUSH
LEAD: It was almost dreamlike: The Jets unveiled a pass rush today along with an impressive-looking outside linebacker.


Home Sales Falter In the Suburbs
LEAD: No one could predict how long the trend might last, or even say for sure that it was a trend, but a look at home buying in New York City's suburbs last week - which should have been the peak of the season - detected a lull.
In communities where real-estate prices have more than doubled since 1980, sellers were lowering their prices and still waiting for buyers.


Teachers Are Trained to Use Arts as Bridge to Other Areas
LEAD: WHAT better time than summer for teachers to become students?


Tuscany
LEAD: To the Editor: Having just returned from a trip to Tuscany, I would like to add a note to Beth Archer Brombert's excellent article ''Exploring the Hill Towns of Tuscany'' (Travel, July 12).


Books in Britain
LEAD: To the Editor: The article on antiquarian booksellers in London (Travel, June 21) reminded me that many booklovers have extended the experience of browsing through bookstores in the United Kingdom by purchasing the Sheppard Press publication: ''A Directory of Dealers in Second-Hand and Antiquarian Books in the British Isles,'' which costs about $15 and can be purchased by mail or phone from Hatchards in London, Blackwell's in Oxford and most booksellers in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and


Circus Camp Lures Vermont Youths
LEAD: When Nicholas Ponzio applied to summer camp, he received a list of things to pack: rugged clothes and poncho, insect repellent, bathing suit, clown costume and juggling balls.
For good measure, Nicholas packed his unicycle, too.
No need to worry about red bulbous noses, spinning plates and juggling clubs, however.


EMBASSIES SMASHED IN TEHERAN
LEAD: More than 400 Moslems died when clashes broke out Friday between Iranian Shiite Moslem pilgrims and Saudi riot policemen in Mecca, Islam's holiest site, Saudi Arabia announced Saturday.

MASERATI BITURBO: ECONOMICAL SPEED
LEAD: OVER the years, I have been lucky enough to have driven most of the cars there are.

Morris Minors whose valves I burned with mega-octane aviation fuel in a far time and a long-ago place.
Studebakers and

UNRULY NATURE, UNRULY LIFE
LEAD: Edwin Dobb's article, ''Battling With Unruly Nature''  [ Opinion Page, July 14 ] , is brilliant.
I especially like the paragraph about theorizing on ''getting rid of everything but the grass,'' and the ones following it, ''Isn't life just the reverse - messy and unruly?'' and ''What, then, are these reposeful places we fashion for ourselves?


Music
LEAD: As the dean of American summer music festivals, Tanglewood has encountered its share of criticism for offering mostly standard crowd-pleasers that will attract large audiences and bring in revenue.
In fact, the Lenox, Mass., festival, more than most others, has demonstrated a commitment to new music, despite its box-office drawbacks.


MARY I. BUDD IS WED TO MARK S. LOGAN
LEAD: Mary Innes Budd, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
William B. Budd of Winchester, Mass., and Silver Creek, Minn., was married yesterday to Mark Skelton Logan, the son of Carol S. Logan of New Fairfield, Conn., and C. Wayne Logan of Santa Clara, Calif.

DELI DOLDRUMS
LEAD: BECAUSE I live in Brookhaven Town, my life is filled with fresh air, trees and delicatessens.

GETTING READY FOR FALL
LEAD: RASPBERRY canes that fruited this summer should be cut to the ground.
Check lawns for chinch bugs and control, if found.
Before mowing, use clippers to trim under fences, by mail boxes and around tree trunks.
Never water a lawn with a hand-held hose; it does more harm than good by encouraging shallow roots; allow the lawn to turn strawlike (go dormant) in hot weather.


WILL TAYLOR'S DRUG STORY HURT THE GIANTS?
LEAD: I don't think there will be a problem at all.
There are 44 other Giants on the team.
I believe they all have sympathy for L. T.'s problems.
They won't let it affect the caliber of their play.
The way they played defense all last season, they could have won with Andy Headen at right linebacker.
It's a team game and one player, no matter how high he rises to the occasion, cannot carry his team to a championship by himself.


Beyond Principles
LEAD: THE BREAKDOWN at first was hardly noticeable except to the trained eye.
The Ivan Boesky scandal, for instance, did not seem especially alarming, nor did the discovery that Wall Street was swarming with chiselers and finaglers of the Boesky type.
It was only Wall Street, after all.
The chance to get filthy rich had always brought out the worst in people.


FATHER PANIK VILLAGE: HIGH HOPES ARE NOW DESPAIR L&gt;By PEGGY McCARTHY
LEAD: IT began on Dec. 23, 1939, as Yellow Mill Village, an alternative for more than 1,000 families to the rundown tenements they lived in on the east side of Bridgeport.
Politicians of the time predicted that the clean, sunny apartments in the new complex would put an end to juvenile deliquency, disease and crime.


Business Climate
LEAD: To the Editor:


Dana Ivey's Penchant for the Persnickety
LEAD: WITH NOTICEABLE CONSIS-tency, Dana Ivey has played antagonists or less than commendable characters -snobs, manipulators or loners.
Her willingness to take on unlikable characters and to refrain, in the process, from seeking audience affection, partially explains why she was the unanimous choice for the title role in ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' , which reopened last week at the John Houseman Theater.


LIFTING FARM CREDITS SYSTEM OUT OF MIRE
LEAD: EVEN as many farmers are cautiously forecasting a more profitable harvest season than they have seen in years -in large part because of Federal aid -the vast and intricate system that holds a third of all farm debts is calling for one of the costliest Federal bailouts ever.


P. B. PERETZMAN MARRIED TO ANN ELIZABETH MAGEE

LEAD: The tanker Gas Prince slipped quietly out of Kuwait today without the mine-damaged supertanker Bridgeton and sailed under United States Navy escort through Persian Gulf waters thought rife with Iranian mines.


Music: The Taneyev String Quartet
LEAD: THE air of peacefulness that seems to be hanging over Soviet-American relations these days settled tangibly over the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine Friday night.
The instigators were the members of the Taneyev String Quartet, a venerable group formed at the end of World War II in Leningrad.
This was their American debut and their presence counterbalances similar tours of the Soviet Union made a year ago by the Manhattan String


New Milford
LEAD: THE stately brick building, with the words ''Town Hall of New Milford'' in gold lettering, overlooks an old-fashioned bandshell on a historic town green surrounded by dozens of boutiques.


A DRAMA-FILLED LANDING IN GROTON
LEAD: FRANCIS MOHR'S hobby was flying, and for years one of his favorite trips was a short flight from Republic Airport in Farmingdale, L.I., near his home in Baldwin, across Long Island Sound to Groton.


HOT DOGS AND HAVE A NICE DAY
LEAD: As an Indian who has just immigrated to the United States after a four-year stopover in England, I found Steven R. Weisman's article, ''Doing the Needful'' (On Language, July 12), rather amusing.

In the Heat of Summer, The Market Is Sizzling
LEAD: The bull market just won't quit, despite the heat of summer and an economy that is merely plodding ahead.
The Dow Jones industrial average has been leading its less-visible siblings into record territory again and again, surprising those analysts who had been predicting that the unprecedented five-year rally would end any day now.


G.O.P. PONDERS AN APPEAL TO MINORITIES
LEAD: WHEN Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, stared down at an audience of young Republicans the other day, he was struck not so much by what he saw as what he did not.

William Rau's Scene Was the Railroad
LEAD: WILLIAM H. RAU (1855-1920), whose turn-of-the-century landscape views of Pennsylvania and New York are on view at the Museum of Modern Art through Sept. 29, has the perfect qualifications for canonization by the museum's Department of Photography.
Like Eugene Atget and Jacques-Henri Lartigue -two photographers whose work the museum first brought to wide public attention - -Rau is a master of what might be called the vernacular sublime.

Q. &amp; A.: ALIGNING A DOOR LATCH BOLT
LEAD: Q. Ever since we did some remodeling on the first floor of our home, the door to our bedroom, which is on the second floor, will not stay closed when we shut it.

Condo And Co-op Rates Drop

A Shorter Leash for Pit Bulls

A LAUREL BY ANY OTHER NAME
LEAD: Re ''Laurel: Sacred Shrub, Seasons' Celebrant,'' Opinion Page, June 28: Jerry Cimisi should have taken the trouble to learn the proper name of the laurel, which is Kalmia latifolia.
The laurel of ancient times is Lauris nobilis and no relation at all.

MY NEIGHBOR, MY ENEMY
LEAD: Thomas L. Friedman's deeply moving report on contemporary Israel is at the same time deeply flawed (''My Neighbor, My Enemy,'' July 5).
For while his article probingly demonstrates a parity of psychological and even historical claims to the land, the piece is curiously neglectful of policy and political considerations.


Pay Attention to Trade North of the Border
LEAD: To the Editor:


Hungry City Unions Beginning the Hunt
LEAD: IT'S called the Easter Egg Hunt, and it happens every three years.
The term was coined by Robert W. Linn, director of the Office of Municipal Labor Relations, to describe the search for the money the city hides in its budget for municipal wage increases - this year perhaps as much as $450 million.


Haitian Soldiers Shoot Protesters

LEAD: Nipping Disease in the Bud


Is OSHA Falling Down on the Job?
LEAD: In the office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that covers Travis County, Tex., there is a file that reads like a roadmap to laborer Victor Nazario's death.
For more than a year, the file shows, OSHA inspectors visited worksites of the Austin-based Bland Construction Company.
Almost every time, they found workers deep in trenches that were not shored up or sloped to protect them from the cave-in accidents that kill scores of construction workers every year, about 10 annually in Texas alone.

LEAD: THE BRASS PLATE ON the enormous dark wooden door of Allan Bloom's apartment, in a 1920's building near the University of Chicago campus, might read 221b Baker Street.
Mr.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD:  THE HAUNTED MESA.
By Louis L'Amour. (Bantam, $18.95.) The newest best-selling novel by Louis L'Amour, who is especially noted for his Sackett family series of westerns, is a combination of western and occult adventure, with the former given a decided edge.

Music: Piano and Voice On Mostly Mozart Bill
LEAD: LEOPOLD HAGER did not produce a fully satisfying concert with the Mostly Mozart orchestra Friday night, but he did enough to leave one interested in hearing more of the conductor's work.

Demolitions Anger Queens Homeowners
LEAD: THE residents of Bayside, a tight community of homeowners in northeastern Queens, have gone on a bulldozer alert.


HOT DOGS AND HAVE A NICE DAY
LEAD: While many more people in the subcontinent speak English regularly than the 2 or 3 percent Steven Weisman indicates, it is clear that it is not the first language of the vast majority.
English serves as a bridge across the multitude of India's languages, and it serves very well.
The idiosyncrasies of diction and tense he observes are excellent links not only between traditional and modern concepts and cultures but also language structures.

LEAD: TRUTH FLOATS.
PEOPLE'S literal words rise or fall in a sea of unconscious intent and body language.
Consider this summer's Iran-contra hearings.

By contrast, uniformed Oliver L. North, firm and facile in the witness chair, persuaded three-quarters of the public that he's telling the truth.

But Why Call It 'Don Giovanni'?
LEAD: THE TERM OPERA HAS BECOME THE RECEP-tacle for disposable works of all sorts, a black plastic bag where otherwise unclassifiable refuse may be deposited and immediately forgotten.

Taking Tape's Measure
LEAD: PICKING A BLANK CAS-sette can be more puzzling than picking any other audio component.

LEAD: EVEN though two out of three new dwellings in Westchester today are condominiums, the market for single-family houses - each on its own plot of land - is thriving, and the houses are bigger and more expensive than ever.


Two Lunches Featuring Fresh Produce
LEAD: SOMETIMES the idea is not to be original or creative in the kitchen, but merely to be expedient and to satisfy.
The goal is easier to accomplish in summer, when fresh produce is at its peak and the hot weather requires bright refreshment instead of hearty sustenance.

Of course.


ARRIVING AT FUNK FROM TWO DIRECTIONS
LEAD: RHYTHM IS WHAT FUNK IS ALL about.
Funk is stripping the music down and getting rid of everything that isn't hard rhythmic muscle.
Bass and drums, stuttering in tandem, are no longer simply the foundation of the music - they are the music.
And the music is the beat.
The bass player plucks and pulls at his strings, making them pop like a drumstick ricocheting off the head of a snare.

Jazz: The Mulgrew Miller Quintet
LEAD: MULGREW MILLER, a young pianist who has been impressing his fellow musicians with accomplished, inventive and increasingly individual playing and composing, has been heard in a variety of contexts, from solo and trio work to hard-bop combos.

The Cubs had lost three in a row.


Extreme Measures
LEAD: ON the face of it, Iran seems to be holding the world by the throat.
Its strident calls for Islamic revolution have unsettled Moslem neighbors and Arabs of every political persuasion.
Last week, during the annual pilgrimage to the Moslem shrine at Mecca, Iranian activists began chanting ''death to America, death to the Soviet Union, death to Israel'' in defiance of rules against political acts at the shrine.


SHE TOOK THE AIDS TEST
LEAD: Dena Kleiman may have understated how the possibility of a false positive result may affect a person who was not counseled to the extent that she was.
A friend of mine, someone, like Ms.
Kleiman, who had no reason to think she had been infected, was plunged into a profound depression when her first test result came back positive and she was warned never to have children and to inform previous sexual partners of the result.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  SANDS OF SORROW: Israel's Journey From Independence.
By Milton Viorst. (Harper &amp; Row, $19.95.) Some Israelis remember the Six-Day War as their finest moment, others as a victory that contained the seeds of despair.
If it rescued the Jewish state from possible annihilation, it also marked the beginning of an occupation that continues to sap the nation's strength.


Rome's Mischievous Architect
LEAD: To chance upon one of Rome's many beautiful fountains or hidden piazzas is a common pleasure, but I was not prepared for the array of fanciful buildings designed by a single architect in one of the city's subdued residential quarters.

LEAD: In the last six weeks a half dozen friends have asked me to give them advice about buying a point-and-shoot camera.
My mother, whose lifelong photography experience has consisted of posing for my father, now owns a Pentax IQ Zoom, the first point-and-shoot model to have a zoom lens.
Clearly point-and-shoot mania is upon us.


WILL TAYLOR'S DRUG STORY HURT THE GIANTS?
LEAD: If we can believe that Taylor is telling the truth when hefan can - then L. T. will have yet another great year at the expense of opposing quarterbacks.
His fellow Giants have overcome greater obstacles than the revelation of a drug story two years old, and their primary concern will not be Taylor's book or the backlash.

Broadcast TV

So many twinkled at once, near and far, that they gave depth-perspective to the darkness.


BROADWAY 'SCOOPED' BY RUTGERS
LEAD: WHEN Kevin Patterson was writing what he calls a ''biographical play about a mathematical genius and avowed homosexual who was instrumental in inventing the computer and in winning World War II,'' he hardly expected another play about the same subject to pop up right away.


STEAKHOUSE LIVES UP TO THE IMAGE
LEAD: P.G.'S on Jericho Turnpike in Huntington is a classic steakhouse.
You know the formula: steaks can be ordered for one, two or three people ($19.75, $39.25, $58.75), come sliced from the kitchen and are perched on an overturned saucer so that the juices congregate at one end of the platter.


More Violence In South Africa
LEAD: Eric Mxolise Mntonga, a senior official of an anti-apartheid group that sponsored a recent discussion between white South Africans and leaders of the outlawed African National Congress, was found dead in his car last Sunday, bludgeoned and stabbed.

SHOULD IT BE HARDER TO CASH IN ON OUR PUBLIC SERVICE?
LEAD: AS the number of American lobbyists listing themselves with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agent Registration Act has grown, to close to 1,OOO by last year, so has concern that for many high officials and their top aides, service in the United States Government has become no more than a way station for the acquisition of expertise and contacts to put at the disposal of foreign clients.

At 6:15 the other morning, I brushed my teeth with Clearasil.
What's even worse news is that I didn't notice what I had done until I read the tube, which was lying deceptively, like toothpaste, next to the sink.
The good news is that at least I can still see to read.

Author Chronicles Shreds of Lives
LEAD: WE might meet the people in Marian Thurm's books, both her 1984 story collection, ''Floating,'' and her recently published first novel, ''Walking Distance,'' eating an egg roll or a Twinkie in the supermarket, or getting excited about a trip to Disneyland at age 50.

A Turn-of-the-Century Vestige Threatened on the 'West End'
LEAD: UP to a year ago it looked as if the 1904 Progress Club building, at 88th Street and Central Park West, would survive as the neo-classical base for a 25-story apartment tower.
But now, after protests by neighbors and a stalled development plan, a new developer has proposed demolishing it.


'REVOLUTION' SEEN AT TURNING POINT

LEAD: THE roster of free county concerts continues to grow, so whether your musical tastes run to chamber music, show tunes or jazz, listening can become a family affair without any strains on the budget.

Eze's Herbal Medicine clinic, Nigeria's bronze age is flourishing - 600 years after it began.


Africa Goes Private
LEAD: A depressing sight on Africa's landscape is the litter of abandoned factories, legacies of a socialist god that failed.

WILL TAYLOR'S DRUG STORY HURT THE GIANTS?
LEAD: If the Giants are hurt by L. T.'s drug story it will not be because of the revelations included in his book ''LT: Living on the Edge.'' It will be because of the media's insistence on making an issue about what is basically old news.
Everyone knew about L. T.'s problem with drugs and everyone knew that L.

Rialto Screams
LEAD: To the Editor:


Summer Serves Up Its Sleepers
LEAD: THIS SUMMER'S TWO MAIN SLEEPERS TURN out to be ''Robocop,'' which has already attracted a sizable action audience, and ''La Bamba,'' which should draw a smaller but no less attentive music-loving crowd.
On the surface, a violent, futuristic police fantasy and a sweetly nostalgic rock-and-roll biography would appear to have nothing in common, but in a way these films have similar appeal.


Next Week; What Kind Of Pennant Races Do You Expect?
LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.

LOSING DECADES WISTFULLY

For Italy's Sake

Why College Classics Stay That Way
LEAD: THE AGE OF FLIGHT had just dawned and World War I was still some years in the future when Thomas E. French's ''Engineering Drawing and Graphic Technology'' was published in 1911.
But the book is still taught at many colleges and universities.
So are at least a dozen other textbooks published in the 1920's and 30's, some of which not only hold their own against the newcomers on the block but actually dominate the field.

LEAD: Saint Patrick's Day is a time when Irish Catholics (and would-be Irish Catholics) around the world raise their voices in song, lift a pint to good old St.

LEAD: A State Senator from New York City was arrested by the F.B.I. in an elegant, wood-paneled dining room at the Plaza Hotel yesterday after an agent posing as a shady international financier gave him $150,000 to smuggle out of the country in violation of currency laws.

WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY OF EXCESS - WHY?
LEAD: OUR society is laden with excess.

Earthquake in California

LEAD: SOMETIMES the idea is not to be original or creative in the kitchen, but merely to be expedient and to satisfy.

Handling Death at Home: Lessons in Experience
LEAD: The moment Lisa Carlson pulled open the door of the pickup truck one March night in 1981, she knew her husband was dead.

That night she became the widow of a suicide.


Report Describes Contra Violations
LEAD: When Congress approved $100 million in aid for the contras last year, an important string was attached: $3 million would have to be used to insure that the Nicaraguan rebels showed a more enlightened attitude toward human rights.

LEAD: THE art of crazy quilting, so popular in the Victorian era, has been revived in East Haddam for the benefit of the East Haddam Historical Society.


Cable TV
LEAD: It's easy to dial past good movies with cryptic titles, and cable this week is chock-full of such plums - like ''The Family Way'' (1984) and ''Cluny Brown'' (1946).
The first, Yoshimitsu Morita's import, is a deadpan, wickedly funny look at Japan's newly affluent, utterly aimless middle class.
It's due Sunday at midnight on Bravo.

My Cellar: A Nice Place To Visit, if Not Live
LEAD: I GREW up in a house, but I lived in apartments after graduating from college, so until I bought a home a few years ago I had no cellar in my life, no cellar of my own.

THE ITALIANS
LEAD: THE ITALIANS HAVE A WORD FOR IT - garbo - that elusive combination of decorum and grace that characterizes the most disparate accomplishments: a finely turned phrase, a virtuoso recital or, for that matter, a deft piece of tailoring. ''Garbo,'' wrote the social commentator Luigi Barzini, in his book, ''The Italians,'' ''keeps everything within the boundaries of credibility and taste.


Black Holes May Underlie Process Of Galactic Birth
LEAD: Of all the astronomical oddities, none are weirder than black holes and quasars.

CHILDREN OF DIVORCE
LEAD: Having shared Karin Spencer's experience as the daughter of a divorced and remarried father, I understand exactly what she is saying when she tells her father, ''I don't feel comfortable living here (''A Curfew for Karin,'' by Duncan G. Spencer, About Men, July 5).
And Mr.
Spencer is correct when he assumes that she is also saying, ''You left my mother, and now I'll show you how it feels.

SCIENCE FICTION
LEAD: Let me say right off that Brian Herbert, author of PRISONERS OF ARIONN (Arbor House, $17.95), is the son of the late Frank Herbert, author of the massively popular Dune series.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Rock: Bonnie Raitt And a Five-Man Band

Music: New Leads In 'Sweeney Todd'
LEAD: THE New York City Opera's current run of ''Sweeney Todd'' changed casts on Thursday night and offered a new pair of well-matched principals.

When Mail Order Isn't Up to the Mark
LEAD: Below are answers to some recent questions from readers of the Personal Finance column.


WESTON, SPLENDID ATMOSPHERE
LEAD: IF restaurants were graded for settings alone, Cobb's Mill Inn in Weston would deserve a valedictorian A. After all, what could be more restful, scenic or romantic than dining in a 200-year-old gristmill-turned-inn, overlooking a tranquil stream replete with showoff swans and ducklings?


Suddenly, Business Schools Tackle Ethics
LEAD: FROM IVAN BOESKY and Martin A. Siegel, lately two of the better-known names in the financial community, to a handful of callow young Wall Street traders whose alleged conspiracy was derided as ''Yuppiescam,'' insider-trading scandals in the last year have badly tarnished the reputations of some of the nation's most prominent financial institutions.

Hot Song, Cool Message
LEAD: ''Cuando Estemos Juntos'' (''When We're Together'') is sexy, suggestive and sung by a boy and a girl who look as if they have a mattress in mind.

SHE TOOK THE AIDS TEST
LEAD: Although Dena Kleiman's article, ''She Took the Aids Test'' (July 5), was an interesting piece of reporting, it left me cold and disheartened.
Is passing the AIDS test yet another commodity to flaunt - along with a co-op on the West Side and a house in the Hamptons?
That Ms.
Kleiman views AIDS as a problem of the individual and not as a crisis of the community is sad but not surprising.


'Teen Wolf' Stunt Kills Youth
LEAD: A teen-ager performing a handstand on the hood of a moving pickup truck here died after falling to the pavement, the police said.
The 17-year-old, Kelly David Draper, lost his balance as the truck moved at 15 miles an hour, Sgt.

New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. $17.95.


THE OLD NEW WAVE
LEAD: USUALLY, I'M NOT TOO fond of trends.
The very word sounds more like the length of a hemline than something good to eat.
However, the current interest in traditional foods is one that hits just where my taste buds are happiest.
The only problem with many of these richly flavored concoctions is that they have always taken too long to make.


WILL TAYLOR'S DRUG STORY HURT THE GIANTS?

THE THIRD WORLD IS SOFTENING ITS VOICE
LEAD: BUFFETED by years of global economic slowdown and adamant rejection from Washington and much of Europe, representatives of the world's poorer countries are quietly jettisoning their harsh rhetoric and most radical demands for aid, trade and third world development.
Last weekend, many of their spokesmen took a conciliatory tack at the close of the month-long forum at which the world's rich industrial northern countries hold a dialogue with the poorer southern nations.


Foreign Film Makers Look to American Actors
LEAD: ALTHOUGH THERE IS nothing new about American actors starring in foreign directors' films -from Marlon Brando in Bernardo Bertolucci's ''Last Tango in Paris'' to William Hurt in Hector Babenco's ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' - the phenomenon is assuming ever-larger proportions.
For economic as well as artistic reasons, directors from abroad making English-language movies want to work with American performers; similarly, actors from the United States are attracted to the challenging projects that Hollywood doesn't seem to be offering.


OLD SAYBROOK BOATBUILDER FEATURED IN MUSEUM EXHIBIT

TWO LUNCHES FEATURING FRESH PRODUCE
LEAD: SOMETIMES the idea is not to be original or creative in the kitchen, but merely to be expedient and to satisfy.
The goal is easier to accomplish in summer, when fresh produce is at its peak and the hot weather requires bright refreshment instead of hearty sustenance.


Nuclear Plant Is Shut Down
LEAD: A leak of radioactive water in its cooling system forced a shutdown early Friday of the Detroit Edison Company's Fermi II nuclear power plant, officials said.

LEAD: I'VE seen many drawings of the Mad Hatter, from Tenniel's classic to Disney's cartoon, but never dreamed he resembled a gnome and was the exact color of Pepto-Bismol.

Mets, Darling Keep Surging
LEAD: His season has been a capsule version of what has happened to the Mets, adversity leading to frustration, but never silencing the expectation that things would get much better before the National League East pennant was decided.

The odd thing about ''Who's That Girl,'' the new comedy starring Madonna, is that it looks as if it might have achieved its fairly modest goals had the people making it spent just 15 more minutes thinking about what they were doing.

LEAD: ''The Nose,'' Shostakovich's 1930 dramatization of the classic Gogol satire, is hardly contemporary music, but a company steeped only in the traditional repertory would have to stretch to encompass it.
The Santa Fe Opera - steeped in Henze, Stravinsky, Eaton and Britten - took it comfortably in stride

It's the Right Time to Offer Real Relief
LEAD: IT is time for a new direction in United States leadership in the Latin American debt crisis.

LEAD: ON shrinking beaches, the crowds are thicker than they used to be.
More than half of America's population lives within 50 miles of the ocean or Great Lakes, and that proportion is rising quickly.

Art's Anguish Is A Constant Joy To Behold
LEAD: THE REAPPEARANCE ON screen of Paul Gauguin, in ''The Wolf at the Door,'' is evidence of the enduring appeal to movie makers of the lives of artists.
And why not?
The 19th-century artist, that superbly suffering figure, challenger of convention, unbudgeably independent, holding to his unique vision despite the scorn of a philistine society, enduring poverty in his, yes, garret, solaced only by adoring and available serving girls and society women, is the hot stuff of romantic drama.

It's Done with Mirrors

It occurred in Athens, and a recent sequel has been reported by Warren

SAFE SEX
LEAD: WHEN I was 13 years old, I remember one day feeling that I was very, very lucky, first of all to have been born a human being rather than an ant or a fly or a wart hog, to have the most wonderful parents in the world, to live in the finest city of all, Grand Rapids, Mich. - the Furniture City - in that greatest of all the countries in the world, America.

Mets' Streak Halted
LEAD: The fastball that struck Darryl Strawberry on the right ear flap of his batting helmet in the second inning was the first jolt the Mets suffered last night.
The second came more than three hours later on what they will remember as a long night of wasted opportunities.
The Cubs ended the Mets' seven-game winning streak, 5-3, dropping the Mets four and a half games behind the first-place Cardinals in the National League

COLLABORATION SPARKS CREATIVITY IN Wood
LEAD: IN COLLABORATIVE works at their best, two or more talents rubbed together light a creative spark that takes each beyond its limits.
At the Genest Gallery here, a selection of furniture and wood accessories does exactly that.


WHAT REAGAN DID
LEAD: The Iran-contra hearings left the image of a President airily detached from all that had gone on.
Committee members spoke of a ''junta'' inside the Government, of William Casey and John Poindexter and Oliver North carrying out a ''coup.'' It was as if their activities had nothing to do with Ronald

MOD, ECLECTIC MIX IN GREAT NECK
LEAD: THE mode of the Kitchen restaurant in Great Neck is strictly mod.
Suntanned, sport-clothed suburbanites dine amid mirrors, brass banisters, pink napery, dramatic floral arrangements and the obligatory strings of twinkling lights.
They listen to the music of Porter, Gershwin and Berlin and peruse a wine list with exotic conversation pieces from the likes of Washington State and even Australia.


BASEBALL SALARIES
LEAD: In a recessed economy, the offer made to Mr.
Gedman would put him among the top income-earners in Houston.

TWO ROCK MUSICIANS TURN TO ADULT REALITIES
LEAD: ROCK MUSIC IS NOT AN IDIOM that encourages the delineation of grownup experience.
With its charged rhythms and aggressively defiant stance, the genre was invented to proclaim youthful independence from adult cares.
Yet as the musicians who grew up on rock-and-roll reach middle age and their creative juices still surge, what other subject could be more pertinent?


CHINA'S CULTURAL CRACKDOWN
LEAD: I have just returned from three weeks in China as part of a small group of American film artists and educators.
We found the Chinese consistently eager and available to meet with us; we enjoyed frequent and robust exchanges of views on a limitless variety of film arts issues.
The films and discussions were quite wholly unrestrained, most especially with regard to criticism of the Cultural

LEAD: TO MILLIONS OF LATIN Americans, Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes and their guitars are as much a symbol of Cuba and its revolution as Fidel Castro and his beard.


Mayor Recovering After 'Tiny' Stroke Slurs His Speech
LEAD: It may have been only a ''tiny, trivial'' stroke, but the attention paid to Mayor Koch's small cerebral incident last week underscored a fact New Yorkers often forget: The 62-year-old Mayor is one of the two or three most powerful elected officials in America.
Thus the status of his health affects a wide range of political plans and ambitions.

Sports of The Times; Abbott Up Front At Games
LEAD: CARRYING the American flag with his one hand was not a problem for Jim Abbott yesterday.
He has handled tougher chores in far more demanding arenas.

LEAD: BABY TODD AND THE RATTLESNAKE STRADIVARIUS.
By Teresa Kennedy. (St. Martins's, $17.95.) In 1830 or thereabouts, Mary Faith Beaudine took a lover and then his violin.
Unable or unwilling to speak, she said only one word during her 82 years in Aytolles Parish, Louisiana - and then nobody was around to hear it.


FIGHTING TO WIN

If those strategies continue, the Persians in Teheran will triumph and the United States will have involved itself on the losing side.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: UP THE COUNTRY: A Saga of Pioneering Days.
By Miles Franklin. (Beaufort, $15.95.) Readers may know Miles Franklin, the early feminist and prolific Australian writer (1879-1954), as the author of a classic novel, ''My Brilliant Career.'' But ''Up the Country'' was considered her finest work; first published in 1928, it is now appearing in this country for the first time.


A Quick Fix That Would Be Harmful
LEAD: THE search for a quick fix for the Latin American debt problem has generated numerous proposals for concessional debt relief.
But a close analysis suggests that, except for some extreme cases (Bolivia, for example), such relief is not needed and actually would be counterproductive.

BUILDING A BRIDGE FROM ISLAND TO HEARTLAND

LEAD: John Artis, who spent 14 years in prison as the accomplice of Rubin (Hurricane) Carter, a former highly ranked middleweight boxer, before a Federal judge overturned their murder convictions, was in Passaic County Jail today.


UPSCALE RETAILING AND LIFE STYLES
LEAD: The writing style that Brendan Dack of Carrefour U.S.A. and Patience O'Connor of Western Development Corporation use in their letter to the editor on June 28 is just as bad as the idea of their proposed Hypermarket for Brookhaven Town.
I will copy their style in my response, so they can understand my objections.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  ON ICE


INSURANCE: NEW FIGHT SHAPING UP
LEAD: FOR the third time in 18 months, the Republican majority in the Assembly has passed a bill calling for a change in New Jersey's automobile insurance law.
The measure aims at limiting suits arising from accidents, and for the third time the Democratic-controlled Senate appears ready to reject it.


Sidewalk Franks
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Selling the Sidewalk Frank'' (July 26) focused on Wall Street offices, and why the level of the stock market influences the number of hot dogs being sold during the lunch hour.
Unfortunately, the article overlooked the importance of blue-collar workers.
Construction workers, postal workers, maintenance people and the like all have hearty appetites and provide the vendor with plenty of business, forming a line the length of a city block.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  THE GARDEN OF EDEN, by Ernest Hemingway. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) Left unfinished at his death and now extensively edited, Hemingway's novel is ''highly readable . . . if not possibly the book he envisioned,'' E. L. Doctorow said in The Book Review last year.
The story of a young novelist and his wife traveling in Spain and France in the 1920's, it presents a picture of a doomed marriage, sexual ambiguity and creativity in crisis.


IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO REPAIR OR REPLACE HOUSEHOLD SCREENS
LEAD: ONCE summer is past, it's tempting to put off repairing household screens until next spring.

Many insects seek indoor shelter as fall approaches.

Report Says PCB Levels May Endanger Bluefish Fanciers
LEAD: IF they choose to pay attention to a survey that discovered high concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls - PCB's - in bluefish, East Coast anglers who excel at catching that species will have to embrace the realization that they can't always have their cake and eat it too, at least not in the quantities to which they are accustomed.


HAGEN CELEBRATES WITH NEW ROLE
LEAD: UTA HAGEN, the actress who will be celebrating her 50th anniversary in the theater this year, has a reputation for being choosy about roles.
She has won Tony awards for her performances as Georgie in ''The Country Girl'' and Martha in ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' and she has been applauded for her other performances, including Desdemona in ''Othello'' and Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' and, most recently, in ''You Never Can Tell.

With any luck, he'll accuse Darling of scuffing the ball and investigate


Answering the Mail
LEAD: Q. We have a large room with a parquet wood floor.
Under the wood is a concrete slab that has radiant heating pipes.

Italy: The Symphony Front
LEAD: ITALY HAS PRODUCED MORE THAN its share of important composers, conductors and instrumentalists in this century, but it has not been renowned for the excellence of its symphony orchestras.

Recent generations of Italians, like their counterparts elsewhere, have been raised on movies and television, and for most of them concert music as well as opera now count as Culture with a capital


CORRECTION
LEAD: The Fashion View column in The Times Magazine on June 21 misstated the relationship between the designers Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo.

POSTINGS: Builders' Fellowships; Matters of Degree
LEAD: The Urban Land Institute, a 51-year-old education and research organization, believes future developers ought to go to graduate school, just as aspiring doctors and lawyers do.

LEAD: ''SOMETIMES I have a dream,'' a bank chairman said recently, leaning back in his chair.

HOW IRANGATE DIFFERS FROM WATERGATE
LEAD: Is Irangate Watergate revisited?
As in Watergate, one little accidental revelation popped open a fantastic political can of worms, a pile of twisted deceptions, a tangle of operations running outside the constitutional fence.
As in Watergate, what looked at first like a low-level imbroglio soon crawled up to the White House and eventually into the lap of the President himself.

LEAD: WHEN THE neurobiologist Gary Lynch wants to instill in his students a sense of what it is like to do science - to wrest from the world's complexity a fact that is clear, simple and undeniably true - he tells them the story of Emil du Bois-Reymond.
In 1843, the German physiologist became the first person to prove beyond doubt that electricity - and not some supernatural ''life force'' - runs through the nervous system.

Pianist at Work
LEAD: Vladimir O. Feltsman, the pianist, appeared destined for the heights of Soviet stardom when, in 1979, he asked the wrong question: May I leave?

Last week, however, in a move credited to Mikhail S.

THE UNFLINCHING EYE
LEAD: In Vicki Goldberg's article, she describes Diane Arbus's photography as being filled with a ''profound and contagious malice.'' This strikes me as a most fallacious characterization of the late Arbus's work.
Vicki Goldberg seems to have made the elementary critical error of condemning the messenger for the message which she brought.


Answering the Mail
LEAD: Q. We have a large room with a parquet wood floor.
Under the wood is a concrete slab that has radiant heating pipes.
These pipes burst several times, so we disconnected them and use other heat.

PLEASURES OF TRAVELING IN LIFE'S SLOW LANE
LEAD: THE commute from Fairfield County into Manhattan was exciting, at first.
Trains, taxis, subways.
Then the novelty wore off.
Suddenly it seemed that the trains were dirty, crowded and late; the taxis nonexistent when needed most; the subways packed, hot and smelly.


U.S., Soviet Agree To Speed Work on Draft Arms Treaty
LEAD: The major obstacle to a new Soviet-American arms control treaty is Moscow's demand that the American nuclear warheads on West Germany's short-range Pershing 1A missiles be eliminated.


Crowding the Seashore on Every Coast
LEAD: ON shrinking beaches, the crowds are thicker than they used to be.
More than half of America's population lives within 50 miles of the ocean or Great Lakes, and that proportion is rising quickly.

Hodel's Proposal To Undam a Dam

Rayner Hesse Jr. performed the ceremony.


Jazz: Joe Henderson at the Vanguard
LEAD: JOE HENDERSON and the quartet he is leading through today at the Village Vanguard was raising some male eyebrows the other night.
Mr.
Henderson's pianist, bassist and drummer are women, and in jazz, even in 1987, that is unusual. ''I'm not sure about the music,'' one male fan commented, ''but I think I'm in love.


Jazz
LEAD: Illinois Jacquet is usually thought of as a product of the swing era and the big bands that flourished then.
And, in truth, he is.
He played in territory bands in the Southwest during the late 1930's and he first joined a major band - Lionel Hampton's - in 1941.
During the next five years he moved to Cab Calloway's band and then to Count Basie's.

LEAD: IF Bill Kizorek is tailing you, he won't be doing it from a few yards away with a newspaper hiding his face.
Chances are he'll be a block away, watching you through a video camera in a surveillance van -and you'll never know he's there.


Norma O'Leary; 'I THINK FARMERS CAN SURVIVE'
LEAD: NORMA O'LEARY and her husband, Ernest, operate a dairy farm of 250 head of cattle in Thompson, a town with 30 dairy operations 40 years ago but only a half dozen today.
As the president of the Connecticut Farm Bureau, Mrs.
O'Leary has been an active advocate for farmers in the state.
She is the mother of three daughters - all of whom have chosen careers in fields outside farming.


IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO REPAIR OR REPLACE HOUSEHOLD SCREENS
LEAD: ONCE summer is past, it's tempting to put off repairing household screens until next spring.

Many insects seek indoor shelter as fall approaches.

One college student remarked, ''Now, if only the newspapers would go on strike, we could really relax.


ON THIS LITTLE TOUR, FOOD RULES OVER HISTORY
LEAD: THERE are the Five Towns, and then there are the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth towns.
Here were these visitors from New Jersey, and it seemed like a good idea to show them the sights of East Rockaway, Oceanside, Baldwin and Freeport.
Accompanied by my totally inaccurate thumbnail history of the area, we hit some of the high spots of these villages, which have never made it to the exalted status of the Five

Q and A
LEAD:  Madagascar  Question: We would appreciate information on touring Madagascar.

Writers in China: How Long Is the Leash?
LEAD: The Peace Hotel is a noble, well-preserved pile of gray stone at the corner of downtown Shanghai's main shopping street and the Bund, the embankment along the Yangtze.
At night on the promenade young Chinese embrace their lovers; elderly men and women perform tai chi exercises at dawn; and students seek to practice their English with Western tourists attracted to the Bund by all of the above, as well as by the view of busy river traffic and the city skyline.

His Pitches Sink, but He's Afloat
LEAD: ALL around him, there is youth that can never be his again.
The first baseman is 26 years old, the third baseman 27, the rookie pitcher just 23.
But Tommy John does not seem out of place as he sits among them, dressing, talking, eating in the visitors' clubhouse at Tiger Stadium when the day is done.


A FAMILY LIVING APART AND STAYING CLOSE
LEAD: THREE years have passed since Shira went off to boarding school.
Initially it was a very scary time for my husband and me.
We had been raised to believe that good, caring parents simply did not cast off their children's upbringing on nonfamily members and certainly not away from the home environment.

THE UNFLINCHING EYE
LEAD: I enjoyed reading ''The Unflinching Eye'' and ''A Father's Pictures'' (About Men, by Dean Pitchford, July 12).
We live in an age of autoload, autofocus and autoflash cameras where everyone considers himself a photographer.
Our profession is much more than taking pictures.
We create images that excite, stimulate and move the viewer.


THE SPOILS OF SUCCESS
LEAD: AT THE start of my investigations into the life styles of the juvenile and affluent, I visited the F.A.O.
Schwarz toy store - toy heaven, is more like it - at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street in Manhattan.
The average child in America will be presented with about $200 worth of toys this year.
That sounds like a lot, but it wouldn't go far at Schwarz; Johnny would have to save for 25 years to afford the $4,900 mini-Porsche, almost three years for the $500 panda next to the $2,500 giraffe (12 years or so).


Soviet Union
LEAD: To the Editor: I agree with E. Wallace Lawrence 3d that it is a good idea to take along bubble gum when going to the Soviet Union (Q &amp; A, June 21).


Israel-Jordan Alliance Quietly Taking Root on the West Bank
LEAD: FEW Israelis have ever heard of Saeb Erakat, a West Bank Palestinian who has never been considered dangerous enough to grab many headlines here.

Removal of Caps Will Spur Rehabilitation
LEAD: NEW YORK CITY'S J-51 tax incentive program has been a driving force in the rehabilitation of older residential buildings for years, but legislative changes periodically alter the way it is used.

FOR THOSE IN PURSUIT OF WESTCHESTER ESOTERICA
LEAD: WESTCHESTER, so often recognized as the home of commuters, condominiums and carports, is claiming its rights to about 40 national ''firsts'' - plus an additional 260 seconds, thirds and just plain unusual facts about the county that range, according to the compiler, ''from the sublime to the ridiculous.

STUDY IN ARROGANCE
LEAD: Though an international treaty imposes a moratorium on commercial whaling, Japan is reported ready to approve the slaughter of 875 whales in the Antarctic this fall.
Japan justifies the hunt by saying the whales would be used for scientific research - before being sold as meat.
That ruse won't work anymore.


HOME MUSIC MAKING ENTERS THE DIGITAL AGE
LEAD: ELECTRONICS HAS OFTEN been blamed for the decline of Hausmusik - the amiable tradition of making music at home.
Time was when many musical families could easily muster a string quartet among their members, and young ladies -as they were known then - counted passable piano playing among their indispensable accomplishments.


AT LAST, TOMATO TIME
LEAD: AFTER NINE LONG months of almost total abstinence, I am ready to eat tomatoes again.
I am a tomato lover, but experience has taught me to resist the showy imported or hot-house varieties and wait for the beauties that arrive in summer.
From mid-July through September, fresh tomatoes can be prepared simply and star in any number of meals.


A Down-Home Feeling Lingers in Tasmania
LEAD: So blue are the sea and the sky in Tasmania that there is no horizon line between them.
This would come as a surprise to most Australians, who like to joke about their southernmost island.
One favorite is that there are more sheep than people.


Head Over Googol
LEAD: THE FEDERAL budget and the national debt are both getting higher than most of us can count.
As in some primitive number systems that go ''one, two, three, many,'' we have reached the end of the known, or at least the end of our vocabulary. (Beyond lies the realm of numbers like a googol - a real number with a joke name.) Rather than appear to be baffled by what is after a trillion, Congress wants to reduce the numbers.

Reggie Ritter, the Cleveland Indians' pitcher who was struck on the chin by a line drive in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays Friday night, was placed on the 21-day disabled list.


When Defensive Tactics Don't Stop the Enemy
LEAD: THE logical method of refuting a gambit is to seize the sacrificed material, slowly wrestle the attacker to a stop and prevail in an endgame.
But what if the attacker cannot be muzzled and one cannot see any light at the end of the tunnel of defense?
If the gambit is this strong, it may be mandatory to forget about refutation and either decline the sacrifice or accept it but then return it as quickly as possible to re-establish equilibrium.


Walk, He Said
LEAD: WHEN the doctor said walk, my first response was that he had to be kidding.
The first thing I learned, upon moving to Lindenhurst 32 years ago, was that nobody ever walked farther than to the car in the driveway.

LEAD: WITH ALL PRECINCTS unaccounted for, the early Super Bowl favorites are the Giants and the Seattle Seahawks.


Long, Cold Swim
LEAD: IT was a simple seaside picnic, a genteel tea party on the beach, but to get there took some doing for the guest of honor.
The picnic on the island of Big Diomede in the Soviet Union was a tribute to Lynne Cox, the 30-year-old American endurance swimmer who had just endured two hours five minutes of 44-degree water to become the first person known to have swum across the Bering


Going After Crime by the Numbers
LEAD: YOU may think your finances are nobody else's business, but private investigators don't agree.
They spend a great deal of time these days tracking private financial information.


CORRECTION
LEAD: An article last Sunday about the opening of the Cross County Square Shopping Center in Yonkers contained inaccurate information about financing for the Hudson River Museum.

Recovering From The Satellite Crisis
LEAD: Because of a series of failures, including the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in January 1986, the United States has been frustrated in its effort to send satellites into space.
This has been especially disturbing to the military, which has had no way to replace aging spy satellites.

STREETSCAPES: THE 81st STREET THEATER; The Curtain Falls, but Preservation Is in the Wings
LEAD: OLD theater buildings in development areas are usually either demolished or given landmark designation - often over the owner's protests.

Crowding the Seashore on Every Coast
LEAD: ON shrinking beaches, the crowds are thicker than they used to be.

The Rev.
John Stubbs performed the ceremony.


Opera: Santa Fe Offers 'Butterfly'
LEAD: THERE is much to be said for the potential benefit of light lyric voices in Puccini, but it has to be said in a cloud of qualifications.
Unless the conductor is far more sensitive than most are today, unless the house is well below City Opera or Metropolitan size, unless (most important) the singer is secure in his technique and comfortable with his own vocal identity - then lyric voices can wreck themselvs straining over Puccini's symphonic orchestrations.

THE UNFLINCHING EYE
LEAD: The photographs in The Times Magazine by Mary Ellen Mark (''The Unflinching Eye: Photojournalist Mary Ellen Mark,'' by Vicki Goldberg, July 12) touched me deeply and made an unforgettable impact.

Victorian Scenes On a Melbourne Walk
LEAD: Sedate and stately Melbourne is more ''British'' than Sydney, and some might say not nearly so vibrant.

RUTH PHENOMENON: The Sexual Awakening of America?
By Barbara Multer. (Richardson &amp; Steirman/Kampmann &amp; Company, $16.95.) Hello, Dr.
Ruth?

It was bad enough when you parlayed your radio success as New York's ''Munchkin of Sex'' and ''Bavarian Charo'' into an inescapable empire of television, board games, ''how to'' video cassettes, feature films, lovemaking guides, fantasy tours to India and commercials for soft drinks, typewriters and condoms.

LEAD: THE GODDESS LETTERS.
By Carol Orlock. (St. Martin's, $15.95.) This first novel is just what the book jacket says it is: ''The Myth of Demeter &amp; Persephone Retold.'' Here expanded, touched up, re-created, it is retold in fact by mother and daughter themselves through letters spanning roughly the years 1500 B.C.

ITALY: POLITICS OF OPERA
LEAD: IT WAS A FLORENTINE SUNDAY early in June when they rehearsed ''Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria'' at the Teatro Communale.
Claudio Monteverdi wrote it 347 years ago for a few of his friends; Hans Werner Henze (very much alive) has puffed it up for the modern stage.

LEAD: THERE IS AN HONORABLE TRADITION, AT least in our time, of the artist as architecture critic.
Saul Steinberg's collages have deftly demolished the banal, boxy facades of modern skyscrapers; Siah Armajani's sculptures comment subtly on the nature of architectural form.

LEAD: HENRY McBRIDE was barking up the wrong tree when he said, in 1931, that Stuart Davis thought ''in terms of abstraction'' as naturally as a child born in China speaks Chinese.

Reagan Latin Plan: Hole Gets Deeper

If those Sandinista Communists sign a peace agreement, they'll cheat, lie and not comply.
And if they don't sign, they'll dawdle until American aid for the contras expires.

Opera: 'Pastore,' At Mostly Mozart
LEAD: One of the duties of a court composer in the 18th century was to write operas that flattered and glorified the aristocracy, usually by dramatizing the legend of some monarch's magnanimous acts.

Mozart wrote in honor of an archduke's visit to Salzburg, is not the composer's most successful effort in the stiffly formal genre known as opera seria - ''Idomeneo'' and ''La Clemenza di Tito'' both overshadow this two-act ''dramma per musica.

Record for McGwire
LEAD: IT'S not every day that a visiting player receives a standing ovation after hitting a home run, but the homer that Mark McGwire of the Oakland Athletics hit against the California Angels in Anaheim Friday night was not an everyday blast.
It was his 39th of the season, breaking the major league record for a rookie that had been shared by Wally Berger of the 1930 Boston Braves and Frank Robinson of the 1956 Cincinnati Reds.


Appetites
LEAD: The carcass of a 40-ton whale, recently washed ashore at East Hampton, L.I., provided a meal for every shark within miles.
It also provided a meal of sorts for sightseers, who came in droves to exclaim and shiver.
The jump in the tourist trade more than made up for what it cost the town to keep people out of the water and to get the deceased off the beach.


NEAR-MISS FLiER IN ARMY CUSTODY
LEAD: The soldier who while absent without leave piloted the small plane that nearly collided with President Reagan's helicopter Thursday has been turned over to the Army.


CUTTING LARGE PANELS DOWN TO SIZE

LEAD: THE crowds at Mount Vernon's Memorial Stadium next Saturday and Sunday are expected to exceed 10,000, bigger than the turnout for some Major League baseball games.

Harlem's Hedge Against Gentrification

Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President, condemned a city plan to turn over 45 empty buildings there to a white construction company to develop 900 units of new housing.


Suspended Animation
LEAD: HE has a lot of time on his hands while serving a 10-game suspension for scuffing baseballs, and Joe Niekro of the Minnesota Twins was trying to make the best of it Friday night, playing the offense for laughs as a guest on ''Late Night With David Letterman'' in New York.


ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD:  Q. Over the years I have put many coats of clear sealer on my flagstone patio.
This finish has yellowed over the years, so I would like to take it all off and get back to the natural flagstone.
Any suggestions?
A.
Although I am not familiar with the particular brand of sealer you have been using, most stone sealers can be removed with a chemical paint and varnish remover.


A LA CARTE
LEAD: A LONG time ago, pizza became one of America's favorite foods.
Recently, Long Island has broken out with a rash of interesting pizza possibilities.
Decidedly non-Italian restaurants are offering individual pizzas, and even the familiar pizza parlors have added surprises.

MIAMI'S IMAGE
LEAD: I have ambivalent feelings about Robert Sherrill's article.
Having recently returned to New Jersey from a two-year assignment with my company in Miami, I believe that he has accurately highlighted some of the problems facing that city.
However, he has perpetuated some of the unwarranted fears and misconceptions concerning the area.

A New Romance
LEAD: I FOUND NEW LOVE AFTER A DIVORCE, and lived, sheltered, while the thunderheads of AIDS stacked up outside.
We broke up a year ago, because I wanted babies and my partner, younger and on a career roll, wanted her kids eventually.
It was a wistful, sensible parting, ugly and standard.


POSTINGS: Restoration; Petite Project
LEAD: Jersey City is known for mixed-use developments, such as Samuel Lefrak's Newport, that are so massive as to boggle the mind.
But amid the construction blitz is a restoration that is so petite it appeals by its very smallness.


Report Criticizes U.S. AIDS Effort
LEAD: To help prevent the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the Reagan Administration proposes to spend $247 million in 1988.
But health authorities interviewed for a Congressional report released last week said it would take several hundred million more dollars to wage an effective fight.


The System Is Robin Hood in Reverse
LEAD: OVER the past several decades, a significant redistribution of Federal funding has occurred across the country.
In the case of both grants-in-aid and total Federal procurement of goods and services, most states in the Southern region of the United States have witnessed an erosion of their relative positions on a per capita basis.


Up the Apalachee Captures a Slowly Run Alabama Stakes
LEAD: The cliche that Saratoga Race Track is the ''Graveyard of Favorites'' requires a bit of alteration this year.

LEAD: BERNITA CROFT runs the Vernon Heights Day Care Center in Mount Vernon, and last week she recalled with pleasure the day that Veronica, one of six youngsters working with her as part of a summer youth employment program, received her first paycheck.


Brazil Stopped By U.S.
LEAD: For the last five days, Teresa Edwards had read newspaper stories about Hortencia Marcari, whose skills as a basketball player have made her a national hero in Brazil and the talk of the Pan American Games.


Spartan Advice for Managers
LEAD: CORPORATE resuscitation - the near-heroic art of bringing a company back from the dead - is no place for the faint-hearted.
Salvaging a terminally ill organization often means making gut-wrenching decisions, performing radical surgery and living with slim odds of success.
It's the ultimate ''bet your company, bet your job'' crap shoot for which consensual good guy-managers need not apply.


Q and A
LEAD:  Bad Roof Repair Job  Question: I am a tenant in a rent-stabilized building that was recently converted to a co-op.
In the amendment to the conversion plan the sponsor agreed to a roof repair job in which it would be stripped, insulated and covered with a four-ply cap sheet.
But what the sponsor did, which can be verified in photographs and an engineer's report, amounted to a patch job that saved $25,000 in repair costs.

Avian Flu Reaches Michigan
LEAD: An outbreak of avian influenza has prompted the quarantine of 60,000 turkeys, officials say.
Dan Torrington, vice president for farm operations at Bil-Mar farms, said Thursday that the outbreak was the first of its kind in Michigan.
The influenza strain forced farmers in Pennsylvania, Virginia and other Eastern states to destroy millions of birds in 1983 and 1984.

Cold Spring Harbor
LEAD: A WALK along Main Street in Cold Spring Harbor is like sauntering into a village downtown of the mid-19th century, with brick sidewalks, white picket fences and Victorian-age facades masking modern boutiques.


Pop/Jazz
LEAD: In the United States, George Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein, among many others, pulled 20th-century popular music into the concert hall.
In Argentina, Astor Piazzolla reversed the equation: He took the harmonies and structures of Stravinsky, Bartok and other 20th-century modernists and applied them to Argentina's own popular music, the tango.

James Church.


Switching Sides in The Indian Wars
LEAD: It may have come too late to improve New York City's chances of keeping the Museum of the American Indian, but last week Mayor Koch and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato withdrew their opposition to a plan that might yet work.
Rather than let the museum move its nearly one million tribal artifacts to Washington, they said, they would support relocating it to the old United States Custom House at Bowling


CORRECTION
LEAD: An article last week on thorium removal in Maywood misstated the amount of new contaminants the borough had been asked to accept at a temporary storage site.

ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD:  Q. Over the years I have put many coats of clear sealer on my flagstone patio.
This finish has yellowed over the years, so I would like to take it all off and get back to the natural flagstone.
Any suggestions?
A.
Although I am not familiar with the particular brand of sealer you have been using, most stone sealers can be removed with a chemical paint and varnish remover.


Pumps and Conservation
LEAD: The Federal Government and, increasingly, the states have spent billions trying to move water from where it is to where it is wanted.
But many factors - faster-than-expected growth, changing patterns of water use or a summer without rain - can still confound those plans.
What follows are reports on how different regions are coping with the problems of providing enough water to their industries, households and farms.


SHARING THE AIDS RISK
LEAD: Insurance companies have been beating the drum about the costs of AIDS, warning that they face bankruptcy if not allowed to test and exclude people carrying the AIDS virus.
Though life insurance companies may have a case, health insurers at present do not.
Governor Cuomo and James Corcoran, New York State's Superintendent of Insurance, courageously faced down the clamor and last week issued a regulation to bar health insurers from testing applicants for AI

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  THE LIFE ERA: Cosmic Selection and Conscious Evolution.
By Eric Chaisson. (Atlantic Monthly, $19.95.) Eric Chaisson opens ''The Life Era'' with nearly 50 pages of the cosmic, hyperbolic kind of prose that Carl Sagan has made famous.
This is followed by an equally long section that almost seems an attempt to recapitulate the history of Western thought.


GRAND PRIX TENNIS COMES TO COUNTY
LEAD: IT was in 1968 that big-time tennis went from amateur to ''open'' status, enabling amateur players to compete with professionals for prize money.
In actuality, though, according to Gene Scott, tournaments on the international Grand Prix circuit are usually ''open'' only to the world's top 250 players.


Defective Gene May Contribute To Colon Cancer
LEAD: Many scientists have long thought that environmental factors, such as high-fat and low-fiber diets, contribute to the development of colon cancer.
Last week, researchers in London reported that the disease might also have a genetic cause.


WILL ISRAEL FINALLY GET A CONSTITUTION?
LEAD: IT has always been ironic that Israel, the nation descended from Moses the lawgiver, the state where lawyers and Talmudic scholars seem to grow on trees, could never produce a constitution of its own.


'Sting' Catches Bribery Suspects In 40 N.Y. Towns
LEAD: A ''sting'' operation in 40 New York municipalities last week spread a cloud of suspicion over the way public business is done in much of the state.


KID CREOLE BRINGS THE REAL WORLD TO POP MUSIC
LEAD: AHEAD OF THE TIMES IS no picnic.
Ask August Darnell, whose band, Kid Creole and the Coconuts, forecast late-1980's urban pop back in 1980, when Mr.
Darnell became Kid Creole full time.
The band Mr.
Darnell and the songwriter-arranger Andy (Coati Mundi) Hernandez formed from the remnants of Dr.
Buzzard's Original Savannah Band set out to make real New York pop the way they heard it - all the sounds of the city from Broadway to the Bronx, from Tin Pan Alley to the Caribbean enclaves of Brooklyn and Queens.


Question Of the Week; Is Altering Bats and Balls a Part Of Baseball?
LEAD: Every time a pitch is thrown or a bat swung in the major leagues, millions of dollars are directly or indirectly at stake.
So are the career prospects of those who stand to lose by the efficacy of those pitches and swings.
Doctored balls and bats, then, should be regarded as much a part of baseball as are doctored dice in a casino, inside trading on Wall Street and cheating on S.A.T.


Doctors, Becoming and Unbecoming
LEAD:  To the Editor:


LESLIE D. YUNKO WED TO THEODORE J. FINN
LEAD: At the Nassau Inn in Princeton, N.J., Leslie Denise Yunko, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Design Flaw Reported at 2 Westchester Reactors
LEAD: The two Indian Point nuclear reactors operated for several years with a design flaw that could have blocked the automatic start of a key safety system, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


Budapest
LEAD: Budapest is one of the great European music bargains in almost any season, but never more so than in autumn.
On Sept. 15, the opulently restored Hungarian State Opera will open its 104th season, and on Oct. 20 the company's second - but equally first-rate - house, the Erkel Opera, reopens its doors.


TOBACCO GOES BACK ON TRIAL
LEAD: TOBACCO never grew in this part of the South.
But Ella Mae Horton and her lawyers hope it will begin to die here.


Chad's Leader, in an Interview, Predicts Long War
LEAD: Charging that 15,000 Libyan troops were massed on his country's northern border, the President of Chad said today that the two nations could be in for a long period of border warfare.

WAYS TO DECREASE THE NURSE SHORTAGE
LEAD: The July 26 letter to the editor by Audrey Mulford, R.N., offered several suggestions for decreasing the nursing shortage that I believe are more reflective of her frustration with the health care system than actual solutions to the problem.


OUTLOOK DOUBTFUL ON CHARTER SHIFT
LEAD: Even though President Reagan pointed out in his televised speech Wednesday night that a new constitutional convention ''is only two states away from approval,'' there are widespread doubts that such a gathering will ever convene.


AT BRADLEY AIRPORT, ART SWAYS IN THE AIR
LEAD: IT is more than a year since Bradley International Airport's new passenger terminal opened, but construction seemed under way again last week as, with the aid of an electric scaffold, T. Merrill (Tim) Prentice installed his new creation, a 230-foot-long vermilion kinetic sculpture, which will sway gently beneath the building's skylight.


Film
LEAD: Going to Alice Tully Hall these days is a little like going to a cocktail party where all the hors d'oeuvres border on the irresistible.


Chicago Bears Owner's Body Is Exhumed for a 2d Autopsy
LEAD: The body of the former president of the Chicago Bears football team, George Halas Jr., was exhumed today and a second autopsy was performed to determine the cause of his death eight years ago.


HARDBALL ON WALL STREET
LEAD: A HAZE OF GRAY smoke met Rob Minicucci as he entered the office where the commitments committee of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. had gathered.
No matter what the world may think of smoking, on Wall Street cigars are as common as suspenders, a symbol of power, a sign that important business is being transacted, as it was on this morning at the nation's second-largest securities firm.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD:  BEST INTENTIONS.
By Kate Lehrer. (Little, Brown, $15.95.) The 17-year-old daughter of an influential Washington political commentator is murdered, and subsequently a mother-daughter relationship based on guilt trips comes to light.
The journalist, Sarah Corbin Adams, has made it big by charming intimate truths out of powerful interview subjects; in her own life, she is an insecure, dictatorial phony whose obsessive love is like a bear trap.


A WEEK OF FINALES FOR CLASSICAL FARE
LEAD: IF classical music is your beat, take advantage of the last busy week in Westchester for a while; thereafter, the concert scene goes into virtual hibernation, and it will be late September or early October before anything like our normal performance pace is resumed.


Breaking Away To a Belgian Inn
LEAD: For the traveler who likes to eat well but without unnecessary ceremony, Belgium is still, mysteriously, the best-kept secret.
The country is too small and too modest to figure on the itineraries of the Grand Tours.
Have you ever heard of someone setting off to see Belgium?
Brussels is a bustling place and something of a Eurocapital, but its institutionalization as the headquarters of the Common Market and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization seems to have blurred rather than sharpened its profile beyond the kingdom's frontiers.


Molitor's Hitting Streak Reaches 30
LEAD: Paul Molitor of Milwaukee extended his hitting streak to 30 games with a single on the second pitch of the game tonight, but the Baltimore Orioles hung in to defeat the Brewers, 2-1.


A Wild Party For the Bull Market
LEAD: The unstoppable bull market celebrated its fifth birthday like a gleeful 5-year-old, crashing headlong through 2,600 and racing toward 2,700.
A lot of investors came to the party, with volume close to or exceeding 200 million shares each day.
Institutional buying combined with a marked lack of profit taking seems to be lighting the candles this time as the slow but sure advance of the economy makes stocks more attractive than other financial instruments.


Saratoga Fashion; A Place to Enjoy Linens, Languor And the Rustle of Silk
LEAD: SARATOGA and late summer: the combination is almost magical.
Perhaps it is the hue of the greensward, which is especially deep and lush this time of year.
Or the swift click of the race horses' hooves, or the jockeys in their colorful silks.
Or the track crowd languorously strolling the elm-shaded paddock area between races.


OIL-IMPORT TAX IS A DAGGER AT STATE'S THROAT
LEAD: AN OIL import tax, which has been proposed in Congress as a means of reducing the Federal budget deficit, would be a dagger at the throat of New Jersey's economy.


Opera: Britten's 'Dream'
LEAD: Shakespeare and opera remain passionate, if somewhat mistrustful, partners after 200 years.
The language of the plays literally breathes with music, and their allure for composers is as irresistible as it is duplicitous.
Opera, in other words, is rarely kind to words or to plot - smothering the first and oversimplifying the second.


LOADS OF LAUNDRY, LOADS OF LIFE
LEAD: WHEN I was 13, my mother taught me to iron so I would be ''a good wife'' someday.
I stood in the kitchen, stringy adolescent bangs flopping in my eyes, and sullenly said that I didn't see what was so important about ironing.


Security Increased In Wake of Fight
LEAD: The tense coexistence between the Cuban delegation at the Pan American Games and opposition groups erupted late Friday night with a fight outside the boxing ring at the Indianapolis Convention Center.


SUSHI AND BEYOND IN BROOKFIELD

Medical Use of Fetal Tissues Spurs New Abortion Debate
LEAD: The surge of interest in medical uses for tissue from aborted fetuses has opened a new debate about medical technology and the beginnings of life and added a new dimension to the longstanding controversy over abortion.


NORTHEAST JOURNAL
LEAD:  Fears for Health In Maine County


Rock-a-Bye Baby
LEAD: To the Editor:


Re-admitted
LEAD: If, as Ariel Dorfman put it, exile is a ''a convenient substitute for death,'' then Mr.
Dorfman has been restored to life.
Mr.
Dorfman, a Chilean novelist who is among the hundreds of opponents of the Government of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet who have been banned from their country, said last week that the Government has lifted the order to exclude him.


WHEN WILL THE WELSH BE RECOGNIZED?
LEAD: WHY are the Welsh angry?
First, let's identify the Welsh.
For the uninformed they are descendents of Iberians, the original inhabitants of Wales, the country that bounds the west of England and faces the Irish sea.
The Iberian stock is the most widely represented in Wales even though they were displaced by a tall, fair, red-haired people, the Celts, who originated in the valley of the Danube.


WHEN THE FOCUSING IS NOT AUTOMATIC
LEAD: ALTHOUGH the tide is toward automatic focusing, there still are more cameras in existence that need to be focused by hand.
And there are still plenty of people buying manual-focusing SLRs, just as they did before the Minolta Maxxum appeared some three years ago.
These folks either don't want the camera to focus for them, or they don't want to pay the premimum that auto-focusing cameras command.


HOW STATE PICKS SITES FOR HANDLING HAZARDOUS WASTES
LEAD: ON Feb. 14, 1986, the New Jersey Hazardous Waste Siting Commission made public a list of 11 potential sites that might prove to be suitable hazardous-waste facilities for the new hazardous-waste treatment and disposal facilities required to assure the proper management of New Jersey's hazardous waste.


IF THE CHARM MATCHED THE FOOD. . .
LEAD: THE Spring Close House in East Hampton, unlike the stereotype of East End restaurants, is not all show and no substance.
In fact, the food, despite some weaknesses, is the best part of the dining experience.
It is the decor that disappoints and the service that often sputters.


Rangers at Mt. Shasta Brace for a 'New Age'
LEAD: At sunrise Sunday, believers in ''harmonic convergence'' plan to resonate and meditate, hold hands and hum here, preparing for a new age supposedly predicted in Mayan, Aztec and Hopi writings.
National Forest Service rangers made plans of their own to keep order over the two-day ''planetary purification.


SUNY Expected to Act on Executive Salaries
LEAD: Trustees of the State University of New York are expected to consider a new executive pay plan this week that would raise the salaries of top administrators to levels comparable with those offered at state universities across the country, officials said last week.


Civil War Papers Found in Safe Box
LEAD: Another cache of documents, including letters signed by Ulysses S. Grant, has been discovered in a safe-deposit box of Charles Merrill Mount, a portrait painter and art historian who was arrested in Boston Thursday on Federal charges of interstate transportation of stolen property, the authorities said today.


Chicago Reshapes A Treasure
LEAD: THE REDESIGNED AND RE-installed new galleries at the Art Institute of Chicago are by common consent a model of what such things should be.
Not only do we see great and famous works of art in profusion, but we are led to look with fresh eyes at others, not so famous and perhaps not always so great, that have been placed in such a way as to hold our attention.


Ballet: The Choreography Project
LEAD: Liz Thompson, director of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, described herself and the Choreography Project as adventuresome in a curtain speech before a performance by the group on Thursday night.
But the program highlighting new choreography by dancers of the New York City Ballet also demanded a certain degree of adventurousness - as well as generosity - from its capacity audience.


Testaverde Passes Test
LEAD: Vinny Testaverde passed for three touchdowns in the final 6 minutes 18 seconds tonight in a spectacular debut for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
His heroics weren't enough, however, as the Cincinnati Bengals scored a 31-30 victory.

LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  FESTIVE TIMES  Quick, before the fall festival season starts, this is a good week to take advantage of what summer still has to offer on the fair front.
That action begins today with the Huntington Historical Society's 24th annual Heritage Festival, from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. at Heckscher Park.


RECORD NOTES
LEAD: ARABESQUE HAS COME A long way since it began life in 1979 as the classical-record arm of Caedmon, a division of D. C. Heath, the publisher, which in turn was a division of Raytheon.
When Raytheon recently divested itself of Caedmon, the man who had been running Arabesque, Ward Botsford, bought the company, along with a partner, and now it is out there on its own.


U.S. Swimmers End With 27 of 32 Golds
LEAD: Katie Welch of St.
Louis set a Pan American Games record in the 200-meter backstroke tonight as 16-year-old Silvia Poll of Costa Rica, who finished second, lost her bid for a record four gold medals in individual swimming events.

Produced by Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown.
Directed by Robert Ellis Miller. 1974.
MCA Home Video. 103 minutes. $59.95 She's flouncy, she's cutesy, she's adorable, she's Goldie Hawn.
Alas, she never comes close to being believable as a Russian ballerina named Oktyabrina.

In my eight-plus years as a major leaguer I was subject to eight different field managers, but this lack of stability pales terribly in the face of what Willie Randolph or Ron Guidry, the oldest Yankees in seniority, have been subject to.


WHAT'S NEW IN TRADING STAMPS
LEAD: A GENERATION ago, saving trading stamps from supermarkets and service stations was an all-American pastime.
By filling up enough books of stamps, frugal families to acquire useful household appliances and long-coveted gifts just for shopping at their favorite stores.
Three-quarters of all grocery stores and supermarkets in the nation offered stamps to attract loyal shoppers, and 10 major stamp companies competed for the business.


Wanted: Miracles at 110 Livingston St.
LEAD: WHEN Nathan Quinones suddenly announced last week that he would retire as New York City's Schools Chancellor at the end of this year, six months before the expiration of his contract, the questions raised were hardly new: Was the growing public perception that he could not manage the nation's largest school system a personal failure?


Unhappy Trip To Saratoga
LEAD:  To the Sports Editor:


NEWS SUMMARY: SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1987
LEAD:  International 3-22  The largest demonstration in Seoul in more than a month was held, attracting people to hail the democratic changes they won last month and to call for more.
They celebrated with speeches, with songs and with traditional Korean dances.
Page 1  A mine ouside the Persian Gulf blew up a small supply ship serving oil tankers.


SATING MUSICAL APPETITES
LEAD: RANSOM WILSON orchestrates the Chestnut Hill Concerts in Madison the way a chef creates a fine dish. ''I think of a program like a meal,'' said the music director. ''I don't enjoy turkey, ham and beef all at the same time.
I like to have little things that enhance one big thing.''


'NIMBY' TAKES HOLD
LEAD: AS new or heightened social needs require the building of new or expanded means to meet them, community opposition has become a phenomenom so pronounced that it has acquired a nickname: ''Nimby,'' for ''Not in my backyard.''


Officer Is Shot in Thigh Arresting Drug Suspect
LEAD: A police officer was shot in the thigh during a struggle with a drug suspect in the South Bronx yesterday afternoon, authorities said.


MUSIC VIEW
LEAD: THE OTHER EVENING, AS I SAT in the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth trying to make out Wagner's ''Parsifal'' through a scrim of obscurantism thrown up by a much-publicized Gotz Friedrich staging, it struck me that this was an archetypal 1980's opera production: enormous amounts of theatrical energy and technical expertise had been expended to rescue a work that did not need rescuing.


Mysterious Case Of a Rich Friar
LEAD: WHEN he joined a Roman Catholic order of friars at a New Jersey monastery in 1934, the Rev.
Angelus DeMarco took a vow of poverty.
When he died in Virginia of a brain tumor in 1984, he left an estate valued at $873,000 and no explanation of how he had acquired the wealth.


The Candidates vs. the Deficit
LEAD: If all the Presidential candidates' promises to wipe out the Federal budget deficit were laid end to end, the surpluses would stretch well into the 21st century.
They agree, with disarming unanimity, that the deficit is terrible.
They disagree on remedies.
And they underestimate the difficulties.
If they want to be taken seriously on one of the most serious issues, they'll have to do better.

A Window on the Blackboard World of the 1890's
LEAD: THE end of a seven-year preservation battle in the Beekman Place area of Manhattan may be at hand.
Public School 35, out of service for 20 years, is scheduled for auction next Wednesday.
Although not a designated landmark, the 94-year-old school will be sold by the city with preservation restrictions, putting to rest community fears that a new building might rise on the site.


Dog of Mayor's Chef Bites a City Worker
LEAD: For some reason, a dog belonging to Mayor Koch's chef bit a sanitation supervisor at Gracie Mansion yesterday.
Afterward, the Mayor said he would have to decide whether the dog must go.


Cable TV
LEAD: This is a rewarding week for musical movie buffs, with Gene Kelly in Paris, Tony Martin in Algiers, Betty Grable on Coney Island and Judy Holliday in the heart of the Big Apple.


VISITORS FIND A RESTRAINT IN IRAN DESPITE MECCA RIOT AND GULF WAR
LEAD: After several days of mourning and protest earlier this month over Iranian-Saudi violence in Mecca, this city has returned to relative calm - a possible indication that Iran's leaders have decided to let the issue cool.

Ms.
Cestone, who teaches music at the Central School in East Hanover, and her fiance, an associate at the New York law firm of Lian, Geringer &amp; Dolan, plan to be married in November.


Taking Chances
LEAD: 'When we punish the normal risks, then we're also punishing competitiveness and we're also punishing progress.
We do not live in a risk-free world and never will.
If we're not willing to accept some of the risk that other countries are, then even if the Constitution lives to 300 years I'm not sure there'll be much to celebrate.


Travel Agents Report a Strong Summer
LEAD: AT first glance, travel agents might appear to be working in a difficult climate this summer.
New and merged airlines, battling in deregulated skies, have produced a baffling array of discount fares and rearrange them constantly.
The lower fares mean smaller commissions.


Why Our Persian Gulf Policy Is So Murky
LEAD:  To the Editor:


The City Opera: A New Production Of 'Die Zauberflote'
LEAD: STRANGE, but true.
The New York City Opera, for the first time in its history, put on ''Die Zauberflote'' last evening.
Of course, the company has often performed Mozart's opera, but always as ''The Magic Flute,'' never in the original German.
This staging replaced Beni Montressor's 1966 production, which had reached such a point of decay that fire insurance could not be obtained for it.


SHARING AN ISLAND AND THE SUMMER WITH 12,000 TERNS
LEAD: BIRDS screech overhead, odd-looking plywood structures dot the rocky terrain, and a sign at the narrow wooden pier warns: ''Research Station!
DO NOT LAND.'' The boats that do land bring workers, supplies and occasionally observers to a project that has made Great Gull Island, eight miles off the Connecticut coast, the site of one of the largest tern colonies in the


Paper Books Are Now Plastic Cards
LEAD: THE inevitable pull of technology is drawing trading stamps into the 21st century.
At Frank's supermarket in Glastonbury, Conn., shoppers have been collecing S.&amp;H.
Green Stamps for 15 years.
Now instead of savings books they have plastic Giftsaver cards with magnetic strips on the back.
When purchases are rung up, the consumer's credit-card-sized saver is run through an electronic device that records the number of stamps earned.


Q and A
LEAD:  Paris Terminal  Question: Where can I find the Charles de Gaulle Airport bus terminal in Paris? - F. M. R., Wilmington, Del.
Answer: The terminal for Charles de Gaulle Airport buses is at Porte Maillot (also a Metro stop) in the Palais des Congres convention center.
Buses leave for the airport from outside the center; coming from the airport, they arrive near the Concorde La Fayette Hotel on the other side of the block.


Switzerland
LEAD: To the Editor: I enjoyed Sol Hurwitz's article ''A 5-Day Hike in the Valais of Switzerland'' (Travel, June 7), since I grew up in Martigny, a town in the middle of the area described.
I spent many weekends hiking and fishing with my father in the Vallee de Bagnes, as well as in Champex, a mountain resort not far from


Sightseers' Sanctuaries; For the footloose and footsore, where to stop for tea or a bite to eat
LEAD: The last thing a weary visitor wants during a day of sightseeing is a long trek for a decent lunch or afternoon tea.
But if you go to the nearest establishment, especially in London, you run the risk that the inflated bill and bad cooking will add a sour taste to your already tender condition.


D. V. ROWLAND IS WED TO LISA DEBENEDICTIS
LEAD: The marriage of Lisa Rene DeBenedictis, a television and film production coordinator, to Daryl Verne Rowland, a television and movie screenwriter, took place last evening in the White and Gold Suite at the Plaza in New York.

MOVIES
LEAD:  Topper Returns  Starring Roland Young, Joan Blondell, Eddie Anderson, Billie Burke, Carole Landis.
Directed by Roy Del Ruth. 1941.
Colorized.
Video Treasures. 87 minutes. $9.98.
This is but a ghost of the original ''Topper,'' and it proves that mindless sequels are not an invention of the television generation.


Governor Issues Vetoes and a Dare
LEAD: With the Legislature adjourned and the Albany stage his alone to command, Governor Cuomo last week vetoed two measures that the Legislature had passed unanimously.
Then he hinted he might make the summer even warmer for the lawmakers if they should atttempt to override him for the first time.


Advance Warnings
LEAD: The Federal Government and, increasingly, the states have spent billions trying to move water from where it is to where it is wanted.
But many factors - faster-than-expected growth, changing patterns of water use or a summer without rain - can still confound those plans.
What follows are reports on how different regions are coping with the problems of providing enough water to their industries, households and farms.


LOVE WITH THE RIGHT FARM HAND
LEAD:  GETTING MARRIED IN BUFFALO JUMP  By Susan Haley. 276 pp.
New York: E. P. Dutton. $17.95.


CUTTING LARGE PANELS DOWN TO SIZE
LEAD: CONSTRUCTION materials that come in panel form, such as plywood, particleboard and flakeboard, are popular among both professional homebuilders and do-it-yourselfers because panels are usually less expensive per square foot than lumber, are sometimes stronger and generally require less time and skill to apply effectively.


In a Wet Year, Memories of the Dry
LEAD: The Federal Government and, increasingly, the states have spent billions trying to move water from where it is to where it is wanted.
But many factors - faster-than-expected growth, changing patterns of water use or a summer without rain - can still confound those plans.
What follows are reports on how different regions are coping with the problems of providing enough water to their industries, households and farms.


DIANE ADAMS TO MARRY
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Mrs.
Halstead J. Adams of New York and Quogue, L.I., of the engagement of her daughter, Diane Lynn Adams, to Richard Henry Rush Toland Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Adams, is employed by the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation in New York, and her fiance is a communications manager for Bear Stearns &amp; Company in New York.


Unwritten Rules of Engagement in the Gulf
LEAD: ON May 17, an Iraqi fighter pilot drew an electronic bead on a ship sailing in the Persian Gulf.
Seconds later, two Exocet missles slammed into the hull of the frigate Stark, sending a fire raging through the cramped crew quarters, killing 37 American sailors.
It is not known whether the Iraqi pilot received the Mercedes that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein customarily bestows on victorious pilots or the rather less pleasant rewards of those who displease the strongman.

Langella Finds Playing Holmes Isn't Elementary
LEAD: IN THE MIDST OF SIPPING A 1794 Chateauneuf-du-Pape, flirting with a fine-boned redhead, smoking hashish from his calabash pipe, and explaining a few things to Dr.
Watson about jiujitsu, sodium sulfate and Tibetan yoga, Sherlock Holmes takes a moment to discuss his feelings.


MUSIC, EVERY WHICH WAY
LEAD: TO WATCH A COMPOSER watching his new work come to life, shaped into sound by performers over whom he has no direct control, is to observe nervous apprehension made painfully apparent.
William Bolcom went through just that anxiety recently when the St.
Louis Symphony and its music director, Leonard Slatkin, rehearsed his Fourth Symphony, which the orchestra had commissioned.


DOCTOR MADE FSTER THAN TRAIN STATION
LEAD: DURING the last four years I have boarded Amtrak trains at the Stamford railroad station three or four times.
The station was the start of the second leg of a long day's journey to Virginia to visit my son who began his training as a medical student in the fall of 1983.

Appalachian Trail Gathering Marks Its 50th Anniversary
LEAD: Friends of the Appalachian Trail celebrated its 50th anniversary today by dedicating a trailside plaque honoring the work crews of the Depression era that forged the final link in the famous footpath from Maine to Georgia.


CUTTING LARGE PANELS DOWN TO SIZE
LEAD: CONSTRUCTION materials that come in panel form, such as plywood, particleboard and flakeboard, are popular among both professional homebuilders and do-it-yourselfers because panels are usually less expensive per square foot than lumber, are sometimes stronger and generally require less time and skill to apply effectively.


A TIME FOR DAYDREAMS
LEAD: OH sweet summer, don't slip away.
I'm not ready to sing my annual Labor Day refrain: sh-bop, sh-bop, summer, where have you gone?
I hate September when I'm left to lament the many summer things I failed to do.
Yet each successive summer cunningly tempts, then outsmarts me.


Dance
LEAD: The Ted Shawn Theater at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., is a small, rustic theater that gives the dancegoer a feeling of special intimacy.
In the case of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, which performs at the Pillow Tuesday through Saturday, the performance becomes less an experience of concert dance and more one of immersion in a kind of life that seems as much a part of nature as the insects Mr.


Press Notes; Forbes Silent, Goodson Isn't, A Bad Review
LEAD: Forbes magazine's refusal to answer questions regarding a recent controversy involving one of its columnists has put the business biweekly in the middle of a second controversy over the decision to remain silent.


PERTH AMBOY'S REBIRTH TIED TO PROJECT
LEAD: A PIECE of this city's history is about to disappear, its place taken by one of the most significant developments here in nearly a century.


Question Of the Week; Is Altering Bats and Balls a Part Of Baseball?
LEAD: The answer is no.
If the players think they need doctored equipment in order to perform well with an eye toward bigger salaries, or the owners think they need doctored equipment to bring more people to the ball parks, it just emphasizes the greed (and that's the only word I know to express my feeling on the matter) for more and more money at the expense of the fans.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD:  EVIL ANGELS.
By Pascal Bruckner.
Translated by William R. Beer. (Grove, $16.95.) ''I was going to Asia in search of a holy turmoil,'' declares the narrator of Pascal Bruckner's novel, published to some acclaim in France in 1981.
He gets a double dose without ever leaving the Mediterranean.
Scarcely has his ship left Marseilles when Didier, an earnest young Parisian, falls under the spell of a morally twisted doctor, Franz, who, Ancient Mariner-style, grips him by the arm and over the course of five nights relates a bizarre tale of sexual obsession.


Sports of The Times; Yankee Fans Hostages To Steinbrenner's Whims
LEAD: A GREAT crowd had gathered on the sidewalk of the main street in Cooperstown, and those strolling had to step onto the thoroughfare to get around the milling group.
It was obvious that the crowd had encircled someone.

LEAD: Jean Averill Young and Pierre Samuel du Pont 5th were married yesterday at the Zion Episcopal Church in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
The Rev.
Robert J. Godley performed the ceremony.


Creating a Hip, Young Image
LEAD: WHEN S.&amp;H. surveyed 400 trading stamp savers last year, it found that peel-back stickers were more popular with consumers than old-fashioned stamps.
In fact, people preferred seals to stamps, 11 to 1, and among consumers under the age of 35, the ratio was even more striking - 22 to 1.
As a result, the grand-daddy of trading stamps has decided to offer contemporary pressure-sensitive stickers along with its stamps.


The New Decolletage
LEAD: THE old-fashioned decolletage reappeared as an important evening fashion in the Paris fall and winter couture collections.
Highlights of those clothes were seen in New York Wednesday night in a show sponsored by the Fashion Group Inc. at the Waldorf-Astoria.
Sweetheart necklines and rounded scoops were emphasized by bows, ruffles and velvet bands.


From Fresh Air Visits, Strong Bonds
LEAD: Doreen Yoder Ross had no intention of throwing the bouquet to Robin Griffith, one of her bridesmaids, at the reception after her wedding to Scott Ross.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  FURTHER PARTICULARS.
By C. H. Rolph. (Oxford University, $19.95.) ''By elimination,'' C. H. Rolph writes on the first page of this second volume of his memoirs, ''I had arrived at something between the essayist, the historian, the polemicist, and the crusader'' as the definition of his life's work.


Omm Sety's Lost Life
LEAD:  To the Editor:


Resources for Pied Pipers
LEAD: It may sound smart to say that London is a man's town or that the English don't really care for children.
But those who propound such views are having to refine their appraisals.
There are enough push-chairs (strollers to people west of the Atlantic) on the streets of London these days to create a new sort of traffic jam.


Yankees Erupt
LEAD: The Yankees rediscovered the way to win last night, but a development in the stands was as intriguing as the game on the field because Yankee Stadium fans entered the feud between George Steinbrenner and Lou Piniella, and lined up squarely behind Piniella.


MISS IACOCCA PLANS TO WED
LEAD: Lia Antoinette Iacocca and James Frederick Nagy Jr., a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Nagy of Birmingham, Mich., plan to marry next month.
She is a daughter of Lee A. Iacocca of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, and the late Mary K. Iacocca.


Californians Take Aim At Community Colleges
LEAD: Not many years ago California was unchallenged as the nation's leader in community colleges.
From the Mexican border to Oregon, virtually every community of any size had its own two-year college that offered free, highly regarded vocational and academic training to anyone 18 years or older.


SAVING A MUSEUM'S BEAUX-ARTS PAST ...
LEAD: THE NEW GALLERIES OF EURO-pean painting at the Art Institute of Chicago do not seem, at first, to be new at all.
They are graciously proportioned rooms, detailed with a restrained classical precision, and they look as if they had been displaying paintings and drawings since the institute's Beaux-Arts building by the architects Shepley, Rutan &amp;


A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE LEADS THE WAY TO VICTORY
LEAD: TWO of the winners of the recent Interzonal Tournament in Subotica, Yugoslavia, took their prizes in regal style, but the third needed a last-minute desperate scramble to gain a piece of the pie.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  MY DEFENSE - C'EST MOI  Generalizing about Americans and Europeans is a grand sociological parlor game.
This is from ''Painted in Blood: Understanding Europeans'' (Atheneum) by Stuart Miller.


An Aquino Rival Is Now a Senator
LEAD: Juan Ponce Enrile, the former Philippine Defense Minister who helped Corazon C. Aquino oust Ferdinand E. Marcos from the presidency 18 months ago, then turned against her and was dismissed, resumed his attacks on the Aquino Administration last week from his new position as a senator.
He seemed ready to use the post in his role as the chief political opponent of the president.


THE NATION: Airspace Intruder; Reagan Copter In Close Call
LEAD: A DAY after the Government cracked down on private planes in the skies over Southern California, a small Piper Archer came dangerously close to the helicopter carrying President Reagan and his aides to his ranch near Santa Barbara.
The plane strayed into the restricted airspace over the ranch Thursday afternoon, forcing the helicopter's pilot to veer to avoid the craft; they passed within 200 to 300 feet of each other.


Stocks Zoom, But Economy Is Dwadlinge
LEAD: WHILE Wall Street was cheering the fifth anniversary of the big bull market that had carried the Dow Jones industrial average from 776.92 on Aug. 12, 1982, to a record close of 2,691.49 Thursday, some experts were worrying that the economy was ready to throw the stock market a curve.

WAKERS OF THE WORLD, UNITE! YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BUT YOUR THEORY
LEAD: SINCE 1931 the incomprehensibility of ''Finnegans Wake'' has been justified by the explanation that James Joyce was inventing the language of the dreaming mind.
That theory, offered by Edmund Wilson in ''Axel's Castle,'' gave readers courage to plow through a book that opens forbiddingly -''riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodious vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs'' - and gets worse.


CHEWING ON WORDS
LEAD: Four chef's hats to Bryan Miller for his delicious article ''Chewing on Words'' (On Language, July 19).
Aside from tickling my culinary funny bone, as a food writer I was delighted to see someone taking the recent spate of ''menuese'' over the coals.

LIFE WITHOUT SHOREHAM? YES
LEAD: THE Long Island Lighting Company and its allies have repeatedly challenged nuclear critics to provide alternatives to the Shoreham nuclear plant  [ see ''Shoreham's Critics Ignore Realities,'' Opinion Page, July 19 ] .
The reality is that not only have alternative supply plans been offered by citizen groups, the State Energy Office and even the Public Service Commission, but parts of these plans are already being implemented, to the benefit of Long

John M. Poindexter told the Iran-contra committees on national television, ''had been prepared essentially by the C.I.A. as a - what we call a C.Y.A. effort.''


If Steinbrenner Wants Winner, He Doesn't Have to Look Far
LEAD: IN CITING Yankee tradition, George Steinbrenner often points to the fact that the Yankees had the best overall record in the major leagues from 1976 through 1986.
Actually, the owner is being modest.
From the day in 1973 they played their first game with Steinbrenner as their principal owner to this very day, the Yankees have had the best record in baseball (a .564 won-lost percentage to


SHEILA SINCLAIR BERNER WED TO CHRISTOPHER G. KENNEDY

Post-Muppet Primitives
LEAD: EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE PORTFOLIO of puppets for ''Inner Tube,'' Jim Henson's newly conceived television show, just wasn't taking shape.
Henson, the creator, of course, of the Muppets, and the deity who populated ''Sesame Street,'' felt that ''designwise,'' he and his associates were getting a little stale.

LEAD: A provision adopted by the House of Representatives would deprive the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of $400 million in aid unless it bans smoking on Long Island Rail Road trains.

But the Gershwins (who were no slouches on Broadway in the first half of the century) aren't available - George died in 1937, at the age of 38;

LEAD: THE New York City Opera's production of ''Madama Butterfly,'' which received its first performance of the season Saturday evening, dates all the way back to the spring of 1967.

But the Ethics in Government Act signed last week by Governor Cuomo doesn't end the Legislature's duty.
Ominous gaps and loopholes need to be plugged before the new rules take effect Jan.

At first she seems to be relying on the standard mannerisms of the stage nonagenarian, the toothlessness, the noddings, the blinkings, alternating with girlish posturings, an extravagantly arched back, a self-consciously elegant sweep of an arm.

Make the Best of the Junta in Haiti

LEAD: Australia's trade unions said today that they would consider buying large stakes in state corporations if the Labor Party Government went ahead with plans to privatize the companies or sell them to the public.

LEAD: MANY lawns are now straw-colored instead of green.

While cash deals still far outnumber those financed by equity, the value and number of stock deals have been rising.

LEAD: A 60-story tower rising in the heart of the downtown office district will house the regional headquarters of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.

A Virtuoso Who Specializes In Everything
LEAD: IN LONDON IN THE SUMMER OF 1976, I was disappointed to learn that Alan Bates, the star of Simon Gray's ''Otherwise Engaged,'' had left the cast and had been replaced by an actor named Michael Gambon.

He bobbled it for a second -Columbus for you!

2 EVENTS TO MARK EQUALITY DAY

Maine City Finds Boon In Closed Air Force Base
LEAD: When the Defense Department announced in 1964 that Dow Air Force Base here would close, this Maine city was stunned and fearful.

LEAD: HE didn't have any drugs on him and he wasn't creating a disturbance, but in California it is a crime simply to be under the influence of a controlled substance.

THE VERDICT ON CREATIONISM
LEAD: Contrary to Professor Gould's prediction, creationists have a fourth strategy that they are already using with success.

LEAD: IN an era of spiraling American trade deficits and shrinking world markets, Japanese companies and agencies have marshaled some of Washington's best legal and consulting talent - at an estimated cost of $60 million last year - to represent their interests.

SACKING THE EXCHANGE: A COMPLEX MATTER

Question Of the Week; International Sport: Does It Build Friendship?
LEAD: Yes, international sport competition is capable of building friendship.
But it is not an automatic outcome of young men and women traveling and competing worldwide in athletic contests.
Like everything else of real and lasting value, international sport competitions must be extremely well planned, the leadership must be experienced and altruistic and the athletes must be made aware of their responsibilities as well as their privileges.

Abroad
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Don't go abroad -abroad's bloody!'' is such a splendid quotation that I made note of it as soon as it appeared, despite misgivings over the attribution to Edward VII.
It seemed unlike the great cosmopolite prince.
Then came a letter attributing the remark to George VI.
Knowing nothing of that monarch, I was well satisfied until I opened ''A Taste for Travel'' by John Julius Norwich.


Costa Rican Wood, Carved and Painted
LEAD: Not many countries seriously tempt visitors to take home gaily painted wooden ox carts, along with coffee-wood sculptures of coffee pickers, or bowls, boxes and combs of woods that occur naturally in vivid purples and deep greens.

Turn of the Century Preserved in Iowa
LEAD: Colette says that the sense of smell is the only one that never plays us false.
The aroma of popcorn or salt water or the unmistakable sock of Tabu will without warning plunge us back to another day.
So it is with Legel's store in Charles City, Iowa.
This store, which was 90 years old in 1961 when it was swept up into immortality of sorts, still gives out faintly the aromas of another time.


Burgville Marches On
LEAD: TOO POOR FOR NEW York, we moved to Burgville.
It is not a suburb.
It is not an exurb.

It used to be a burg, but since it was attacked a few years ago by earth-moving equipment and occupied by squadrons of $30,000 German cars, its burgness has died.

'FINALLY SOMEONE'S PAYING ATTENTION'
LEAD: THIS summer, Long Island Sound has seen thousands of fish and lobster die as a result of low oxygen conditions, particularly in the western end, from New York to Norwalk Harbor, and in some isolated eastern bays.

U.S. Backed Gulf Convoys to Limit Soviet Union, Report Says

SMALL AIRFIELDS YIELD TO THE VALUE OF THEIR LAND
LEAD: MANY of Connecticut's 18 privately owned commercial airstrips were started by World War II pilots returning home who wanted to continue flying as a hobby.
Today, however, they are finding that hobby expensive.
Their land, often hundreds of acres next to a major thoroughfare, has increased dramatically in value, to the point where it no longer makes economic sense for them to operate it as an airport.

The Cities Need Federal Help
LEAD: HARDLY anyone wants to talk about cities these days.

CORRECTION

I have tried pure Clorox, a polishing compound and lots of rubbing, but nothing has worked.

It is possible the brown stain is actually rust and if so, a rust remover may be your best bet.

LEAD: FEW money managers have been more vocally skeptical during the last 1,000 or so points of the Dow Jones industrial average's ascent than Charles Allmon, president of the Growth Stock Outlook Trust.

The Kremlin Seeks a New Kind of Coexistence With Religion
LEAD: ON Sunday afternoons, the crowds often line up for two hours to get into the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism, a peculiarly Soviet tourist attraction located in a profaned cathedral on Nevsky Prospekt, the city's main boulevard.
Inside, the view of religion is cold, secular and official.

LEAD: Kelly Marie Fowler, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

BEING CATHOLIC IN AMERICA
LEAD: THE FIRST TIME A POPE VISITED the United States, Barbara J. Devine was a junior at the Mary Louis Academy in the New York City borough of Queens.
The girls there slipped on white gloves and joined other parochial-school pupils in lining the Van Wyck Expressway to hail the pontiff as his bubbletop limousine carried him toward Manhattan from Kennedy International Airport.

COLOMBIA'S DRUGS AND VIOLENT POLITICS MAKE MURDER A WAY OF LIFE
LEAD: THE story headlined ''Sixteen Murders in Eight Hours in Medellin'' won little space in a leading newspaper here.
The killings occurred separately, no one prominent was a victim and no common motive was apparent. ''That's about right,'' a Bogota resident said casually. ''It's usually around 20 murders every 24 hours there at weekends.


MARY GAIL GEARNS WEDS D. L. RUSSO
LEAD: Mary Gail Gearns, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

LEAD: WHAT do you want for dessert in the summer?

Pop Music
LEAD: Orchard Beach in the Bronx may not have palm trees or conch-fritter vendors.
But Sunday from 1 to 9 P.M., it will have some of the best music north of Puerto Rico, in a free salsa concert headlined by Eddie Palmieri.

Upheaval in the Fish Political Dynasty
LEAD: Hamilton Fish 3d, the 35-year-old former publisher of The Nation, has been spending the last two months preparing to run for Congress next year, but that should be no surprise.

INTO EACH MIDLIFE SOME RAIN MUST FALL
LEAD:  50  By Avery Corman. 254 pp. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. $17.95.


Soviet Union
LEAD: To the Editor: June 9 ended our fourth trip to and through the Soviet Union.
Each trip confirms that the U.S.S.R. is not a service-oriented country.
Intourist may rate hotels and services first class, deluxe, etc., but they are using perhaps Soviet standards, which are not strictly comparable to the United States or Britain.


A Table Set with Memories
LEAD: We had wanted to feel at home, only in a place that clearly wasn't home.
There should be no further packing or unpacking.
No more planes to catch.
A place where after a while we could easily find the bathroom light switch in the dark.
But new surroundings, new objects, new food; above all, new faces.


A Word From Our Sponsor
LEAD: LINGUISTICALLY speaking (and that's still the preferred way), there is only one rule in advertising: There are no rules. ''We try harder,'' lacks parallelism. ''Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee,'' is a double negative.
And ''Modess.
Because. . . .'' Because . . . why?
My friends didn't know.
My mother wouldn't tell.


Hospital Patient Becomes Its Patron
LEAD: Benjamin Eisenstadt says he hates begging money for his favorite local charity, Maimonides Medical Center in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn.

Flirting With All Styles But Embracing None
LEAD: GERHARD RICHTER, ONE OF the most important West German painters of the postwar period, is currently having his first solo exhibition in an American museum, the venerable Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.

ART L'DEBUT' AT HUDSON MUSEUM OF A 30'S ARTIST
LEAD: SEARCHING American art history for the name of Harold Knickerbocker Faye, who lived from 1910 to 1980, is an unrewarding enterprise.
Even as a Social Realist working for the Works Progress Administration's graphic division he seems to have eluded documentation.
Consequently, ''The Graphic Art of Harold Faye'' at the Hudson River Museum, a show organized by a former chief curator at the museum, Jan Ramirez, must be taken as his debut.


Jazz
LEAD: The pianist Mal Waldron's darkly insistent trance-blues and the soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy's wryly angular, Theolonious Monk-inspired improvising were widely considered anomalies in the late 50's, when they made their first album together, exploring Monk's compositions in order to refine a stance of their own.

Vienna's Love Of the Trolley
LEAD: The tourist who arrives from Italy, the migrant worker from Turkey or Yugoslavia, and the refugee from the Soviet Union are all likely to see the same thing on stepping out of Vienna's South/East Railroad Terminal - a red trolley car.
It is the D tram and offers one of the longest and most varied rides on the city's venerable ''slow transit'' system.


RUSSIA'S RESTLESS YOUTH
LEAD: Bill Keller's portrait of Russian adolescence suggests a pluralistic mix not unlike that found in the United States (''Russia's Restless Youth,'' July 26).
The influx of Western fads in clothing, hair style and music can be partly traced to glasnost, but the sense of alienation among Soviet youth seems intrinsic to youth itself.


NEW ISSUES HONOR HISTORIC TRADITIONS
LEAD: TWO new United States issues this month are widely divergent.
The August 14 stamp pays tribute to the craft of lacemaking, while the August 15 issue salutes Sioux Indian chief Red Cloud.

LEAD:  TRIO'S 'TRIPLE' IN JERSEY


CORRECTION
LEAD: Because of an editing error, a report on Aug. 9 in the Northeast Journal column about the Big Reed Pond virgin forest in Maine incorrectly described timber companies' plan to use trees there in experiments.

THE VERDICT ON CREATIONISM
LEAD: I agree with Dr.
Gould and the Supreme Court.
However, I have a sympathy for the biblical literalists.
Within their literalism is a desire for authoritative societal values that are worthy of humane people, a nostalgia for an old value structure that has been lost.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  A WORLD OF SECRETS: The Uses and Limits of Intelligence, by Walter Laqueur. (Basic Books, $11.95.) Intelligence gathering is not always done intelligently, Walter Laqueur argues in his detailed analysis of the many ways in which the United States monitors the world.
In 1985, our reviewer, Edward Jay Epstein, praised the author as ''a consummate researcher'' who ''demonstrates considerable investigative skill.


Discovering Self-Interest
LEAD: Through the driving sandstorms that fitfully darken the lands around the Persian Gulf, a few glimmers of rationality may be starting to penetrate.
Iran's mullahs seem now to perceive that free navigation for all in the gulf, not mine-laying, serves their best interests.
It is the Iranians, far more than Iraq or other Persian


Vermont's Few Blacks Finding Special Problems

QUALIFYING FOR THE WOMEN'S TEAM TRIALS
LEAD: THE method of selection of the United States women's team in world championships is about to change.

'BRIGIT,' A BRITISH BEDROOM FARCE
LEAD: IN spite of the blitz of British theater that has brought us spectaculars such as ''Les Miserables,'' ''Nicholas Nickleby'' and ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' the West End in London, like its Broadway counterpart, suffers through its share of mediocre nonsense.
A case in point is ''Happy Birthday, Brigit,'' the current production at the Arena Players Repertory

Rock: Motley Crue With Whitesnake, at Garden
LEAD: THE star of Motley Crue's show Thursday at Madison Square Garden was a machine - a lift that carried Tommy Lee's drum setup to the front of the stage, rocked it from side to side, then turned it in complete somersaults as the drummer pounded away.
Pausing at various angles, the setup re-created the overhead and tilted-camera shots of rock videos; the crowd, cued by narration from Mr.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  WILDE WHEELS RUSKIN'S BARROW  When Oscar Wilde attended Ruskin's lectures at Oxford, the art critic invited his students to help him improve the countryside.
This is from ''Four Dubliners: Wilde, Yeats, Joyce, and Beckett'' (Braziller), by Richard Ellmann.


MISTAKEN IDENTITY
LEAD: ITS ODD, SLIGHTLY OFF-CENTER peaked turret and weathered shingles make this building seem as though it were one of those whimsical English garden structures known as follies, mysteriously washed up on the Massachusetts shore.
No clues reveal the real identity of the building.
Indeed, even the keenest architectural eye would be hard pressed to know that part of it was originally a carriage house built in 1872 as part of an estate whose grand main house is still up the road.


Capone Image Backfires on Maryland
LEAD: It seemed like a good idea to Maryland officials: Get maximum publicity for the state's new amnesty program for tax evaders and delinquent taxpayers through a hard-hitting advertising campaign.

Cost of Cooling Homes in U.S. Rose for July
LEAD: The Government estimates that the cost of electricity for air-conditioning in the United States was nearly $196 million above normal in July but still was not as high as the same month last year.


Breland Stopped by Starling
LEAD: Marlon Starling did not have to see the scorecards to know where he stood.
Mark Breland was the unbeaten welterweight champion, a movie star and an Olympic hero with a medal and a future made of gold.
Starling wasn't going to win this fight on points.
But he also knew that five rounds remained, five more than Breland had ever fought before, and when he came out of his corner for the first of those rounds, Starling noticed once more the weary expression on Breland's face.


'LA BAMBA,' BACK ON THE CHARTS
LEAD: ''LA BAMBA'' THE MOVIE IS A HIT, ''LA Bamba'' the single is No. 2 and climbing, and ''La Bamba'' the soundtrack album is rising in the Top 10.
This success is a tribute to Luis Valdez's film, to Hollywood marketing and to the re-creations of oldies on the soundtrack, especially Los Lobos's loving cover versions of the Ritchie Valens songs that form the centerpiece of all these related projects.

LEAD:  Q. We have a white plastic sink that has a yellow stain behind the faucet where water tends to collect.
I have tried pure Clorox, a polishing compound and lots of rubbing, but nothing has worked.
Do you have any suggestions?
A.
Most ''plastic'' sinks are made of fiberglass.
It is possible the brown stain is actually rust and if so, a rust remover may be your best bet.


WHAT THE LAND RULING REALLY MEANS
LEAD: The article ''U.S.
Land Ruling Causing Concern'' on June 21 overlooked what I believe will prove to be the most significant component of the Supreme Court's recent decision.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the majority, stated:

Soviet Clarification

Now, however, Tikhonov says his remarks were misinterpreted and grossly exaggerated.

What's Left Out, and Who
LEAD:  To the Editor:


Question Of the Week; International Sport: Does It Build Friendship?
LEAD: Only bad feelings and unpleasant incidents are the result of international sports.
Every athletic event is occasioned by disgruntled decisions, protests, accusations of fools and other such charges.
The winners gloat and celebrate - the losers become angry and feel bitterness.


Robinson Doesn't Fulfill Promise Yet
LEAD: As the United States prepared for Sunday's gold-medal game with Brazil, David Robinson acted like a person contemplating the end of a delicious three-week vacation.
Not that the last three weeks of basketball have been such a treat for the 7-foot-1-inch center.


Morris County Views: A Touch of Acapulco
LEAD: When 25-year-old William Procida was vacationing in Acapulco recently, he spotted sleek contemporary houses with flat roofs doubling as decks, providing open-air views of the mountainous landscape.

A Bridge to the 21st Century
LEAD: The Williamsburg Bridge is not falling down.
But wind, tide and pollution have taken their bite out of this 1903 marvel.
The worst wound was inflicted by planners who, in the interest of thrift, failed to galvanize the wires that make up the giant cables.
If nothing is done, the bridge will fall down.


Q &amp; A
LEAD:  Section 8 Tenant  Question: My wife and I own a two-family home in Brooklyn.
A few years ago our tenant in the other apartment asked me as a favor to sign an agreement with the city's Housing Authority that would make him eligible for the Section 8 rent-subsidy program.
I agreed and then renewed his lease in 1981 and again in 1983 - but not thereafter.


COOKIES OR CAKE WHEN BERRIES AREN'T ENOUGH
LEAD: WHAT do you want for dessert in the summer?
Fresh fruit and cream.
Blueberries, raspberries, or even blackberries, if you can get them, mounded in a bowl and topped with a generous dollop of vanilla ice cream.
Then the cry goes out for cookies or a piece of cake.

LEAD:  HAMPTON CLASSIC  With more than $150,000 in prize money, including the $50,000 Grand Prix, and a long history in the Hamptons, the Hampton Classic Horse Show is a major event in competitive riding and social circles.

LEAD: REFINISHING counter- and tabletops, shelves, chests of drawers -in fact, any flat-sided wooden furniture - using plastic laminate is an easy way to achieve durable, colorful, contemporary good looks.


Comedy
LEAD: Despite the recent boom in standup comedy, good serious humor with teeth is still a rare commodity.
But this week three different varieties can all be found in the same place, the Ballroom, at 253 West 28th Street.

A DEGREE OF DETACHMENT
LEAD: Dr.
Shragg's ''detachment,'' it seems to me, is simply one way of being appropriate with his patients.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  In the half-dozen essays that make up the bulk of this hefty work, the history of the Vienna Opera is laid out in an engaging, clear and thoughtful fashion.
The authors assembled in THE VIENNA OPERA (Rizzoli, $65) by Andrea Seebohm, a music critic and the editor of the volume, have written a history that not only details the progress of opera in Vienna during the last 350 years but also instructs about the characteristics of operatic production everywhere.

LEAD: The annual conference on United States-Soviet relations, overshadowed last year by the arrest of an American reporter, will be highlighted this year by a televised speech by President Reagan and the attendance of a Soviet delegation that reads like a Who's Who of Mikhail S.

LEAD: UNTIL last week, tens of thousands of people in the industrial city of Ulsan could be seen every morning heading for work at the giant Hyundai conglomerate.

Air Travel
LEAD: To the Editor: This summer I had to take two trips abroad leaving from New York airports.

NEW YORKERS, ETC.
LEAD: HIS friends don't blink an eyelash when James S. Brady talks about a raccoon in terms of a real live human being.
Probably because his Raccoon is a real live human being.

Mr.
Brady, the White House press secretary who was severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan, is what his wife describes as an ''animal fanatic.


New York City Attracts the Young as Volunteers

Caricature In the Hands Of Red Grooms, And Satirists Of the Jazz Age
LEAD: I f HAPPINESS, AS FREUD once said, is the delayed fulfillment of a childhood wish, Red Grooms must surely be a happy man.

What Does Education Really Cost?
LEAD: When I was teaching in Vermont back in the dark ages before color television, I was surprised to discover that one could start a college by buying a $5 license from the state education department.

LEAD: DRAWING PARALLELS BE-tween pianos and loudspeakers may seem like comparing apples and oranges, yet there are similarities in their history.


Question Of the Week; International Sport: Does It Build Friendship?

AN AIR TERMINAL INSPIRED BY THE TRAIN STATION
LEAD: THE PROCESS OF GETTING PEO ple in and out of airplanes has generally been viewed as antithetical to the making of architecture - not by architects themselves, but by the airline executives and aiport authorities who make most of the decisions about what airports actually look like.

Lake Champlain
LEAD: Travelers who think they know Lake Champlain may be surprised to find that much is new - from thriving restaraunts in Burlington, Vt., to a bustling marketplace in Vergennes, Vt.

RUSSIA'S RESTLESS YOUTH
LEAD: Russia's restless youth are not all hippies and heavy-metal fanatics.

ART BORN IN THE FULLNESS OF AGE
LEAD: THOUGH NOTHING IF NOT SPECIFIC, ''old-age art'' as a name lacks glamour.
It makes us think of elderly persons pecking in dudgeon at a pre-electric typewriter, turning away in despair from an unfinished canvas or giving up on a commissioned concerto because they cannot think how to get beyond the opening tutti.


Schubert's Final String Quartet Gets Its Due
LEAD: SCHUBERT'S LAST STRING quartet has somehow slipped through the fingers of the modern listening public.
It is a terrible fate for a piece that joins ''Winterreise,'' the String Quintet and the final piano sonatas in a body of work as important as any in Western music.
The situation is puzzling, for this Quartet in G (D.

MUSICIAN'S RANGE IS HISTORIC
LEAD: AFTER an hour with Ted Simons, a singer, composer and arranger, you will know, among other things, that ''Dixie'' was written in New York City and that ''Rockabye Baby, on the Treetop'' resulted from a desperate baby sitter's need to calm a frantic child in Winthrop, Mass., in the 1800's.

Mystery in Chicago: Chutists and Balloons
LEAD: A commercial airline pilot has reported that he nearly clipped a flock of parachutists, and another pilot, in a separate incident, has reported seeing several red helium balloons near his plane.


Verbatim:; Moon and Beyond
LEAD: 'The establishment of a lunar outpost would be a significant step outward from Earth - a step that combines adventure, science, technology and perhaps the seeds of enterprise.
Exploring and prospecting the moon, learning to use lunar resources and work within lunar constraints, would provide the experience and expertise necessary for further human exploration of the solar system.


After Plane Crash Rescuers In Detroit Find Job Doesn't End
LEAD: AT 8:46 last Sunday evening, Northwest Flight 255 lifted from Runway 3-Center at Detroit's Metro Airport, stalled, hit a light pole, clipped a car rental building and shot under a railroad trestle and two highway underpasses, shedding its wings and spewing debris over a thousand feet as it burst into flame.

SWEET ARE THE USES OF ANTHOLOGY
LEAD: Every reader is an anthologist, but few carry the mania for selecting to the extreme of compiling a book.
Memory keeps records for us, chooses this story and drops that one, builds odd manticores out of authors who happen to have met at our bedside.
As readers, we change what writers write, cut it to fit our daily quotas, give it the tone of that particular moment in which something was read, mirror it in other texts of similar plot or style - in a word, make the writing ours.


Maui Potato Chips
LEAD: To the Editor: In a way, I'm sorry that the word is out about Maui Kitch'n Cook'd Potato Chips (Travel, July 12).

Teapots, Ceramic to Silver

A Man of Two Clashing Principles
LEAD: TWENTY years ago in my corporations class at the Yale Law School, the late Prof.
Joseph Bishop wryly commented: ''If someone proposed a law that guaranteed substantial wage increases for law professors, I'd be first in line to lobby for it, but not Bob Bork.
He's a man of principle.'' That single observation explains why Judge Bork has proved so difficult for both supporters and detractors to understand.


Q &amp; A
LEAD:  Vietnam  Question: Please name any groups sponsoring tours to Vietnam. -M.
G.
B., New York  Answer: A few tour companies that operate programs in Asia and the Pacific have begun to send small groups on tours to Vietnam.

COOKIES OR CAKE WHEN BERRIES AREN'T ENOUGH
LEAD: WHAT do you want for dessert in the summer?
Fresh fruit and cream.

Then the cry goes out for cookies or a piece of cake.

LEADERS IN CENTRAL AMERICA STEP TOWARD BRINK OF PEACE

Music Boxes Contain Echoes of the Past
LEAD: THOSE WHO ARE IN-volved in Victorian restoration and are striving for absolute authenticity in interior details may well look to antique music boxes.

THE ABUNDANCE OF SKULLDUGGERY IN BASEBALL

New York: Elisabeth Sifton Books/Viking. $18.95.


By the Way, The Singers Were Good, Too
LEAD: THE MOST IMPORTANT DEVEL-opment in opera during the last three decades, I would argue, has been the decline in attention paid to the singers, not only by artistic administrators but by professional critics and the public itself.
To some extent, that is the inevitable outcome of an opera system that is producing fewer singers worth paying serious attention to and consequently comes under pressure to create diversionary appeals in the form of startlingly quirky or visually spectacular stagings.


U.S. to Give Second Chance To Cars That Fail Crash Test
LEAD: The Transportation Department said Friday tht it would permit the retesting of automobiles that already have undergone a Government crash test if safety improvements have been made to the vehicle.


What TV Drama Is Teaching Our Children
LEAD: EVER SINCE THE TELEVISION age began in the 1940's, it has been a standard bromide that those who spend hours watching this tube with moving pictures will be influenced.

LEAD: EVERY so often a camera columnist needs a reality checkup.

LEAD: It drives William S. Litwin crazy to watch all the frustrated consumers among the parade of tourists this time of year in his native Kent, Conn., the Litchfield County vacation home mecca. ''Once they've seen the trees and the river and the mountains, they want souvenirs,'' said Mr.
Litwin, who has built the foundation for a condominium complex combining stores and offices in a rambling structure on Main

A DEGREE OF DETACHMENT
LEAD: I understand and respect a doctor's need to remain emotionally at a distance from patients (''A Degree of Detachment,'' by Bruce Shragg, About Men, July 26).
Without that distance, physicians would be among the chronically morose, I would expect.
There is a difference, though, between emotional perspective and compassion or sensitivity.

Question Of the Week; International Sport: Does It Build Friendship?
LEAD: The question is not whether international sport builds friendship.

Rock: Los Lobos, Tex-Mex and Blues
LEAD: ''LA BAMBA,'' a glossy summer movie based on the short life of the 1950's rocker Ritchie Valens, has given Los Lobos a hit, and an anthem.
The group could probably play Mr.
Valens's insidiously infectious ''La Bamba'' all night long and keep audiences happy.
Fortunately, they don't have to.
Their own guitar-band rock-and-roll, rhythm-and-blues and Tex-Mex dance music are vital enough to keep audiences enthusiastic, as they proved Saturday night in a packed open-air concert at Pier 84.

Art: Gallery Presents Painters of Bloomsbury
LEAD: MOVE over ''Dallas'' and ''Dynasty'': here comes the real thing, ''Bloomsbury.'' The story of this group may be short on serious money, but it is loaded - perhaps overloaded - with sex and good, if sometimes esoteric, dialogue, and, as such, qualifies as grand soap opera (we're talking public television, of course).


DISSIDENT SOLDIERS IN MANILA ATTACK PRESIDENTIAL PALACE IN APPARENT COUP ATTEMPT
LEAD: Hundreds of dissident soldiers attacked the presidential palace, took over portions of at least two military bases and knocked four of the capital's five television stations off the air today in what appeared to be an attempt to overthrow President Corazon C. Aquino.

Give Pakistan Aid
LEAD: Key legislators have urged Congress to vote against an economic and military aid package for Pakistan because of its defiant attempts to develop nuclear weapons.

LEAD: Horrified that there might be microscopic graffiti on postage stamps, the Bureau of Engraving announces sternly that it will review 500 issues of the last 10 years to look for secret signs on dies from which its stamps were printed.

'HAMBURGER HILL,' ON A PLATOON IN VIETNAM
NO movie is simply what's on the screen.
Much of what we see is what we bring into the theater.
American critics saw ''Platoon'' as antiwar.
When it was shown at Cannes last year, European critics, especially the French, read it as a glorification of American jingoism.
Some audiences find Stanley Kubrick's ''Full Metal Jacket'' perfunctory and uncharacterized.
Others think it's the most profoundly considered film yet made about the import of Vietnam and all militarism.

RELIVING ALL THE JAZZ AGES AT GREENWICH VILLAGE FESTIVAL
LEAD: JAZZ was not born in Greenwich Village, but it has been thriving there since its early years.
There have been lean years for jazz in the Village, but there was always a Barney Josephson, who made his Cafe Society Downtown a mecca for blues, boogie-woogie and idiomatic swing, or a Max Gordon, maintaining the Village Vanguard's commitment to quality through every vicissitude.

LEAD: A LARGE segment of Detroit's Roman Catholic clergy has been attacked and murdered by a crazed killer, yet there's only one sneaker-wearing priest on the trail.

LEAD: Lou Piniella, the manager, and George Steinbrenner, the owner, talked yesterday for the first time in nearly four weeks in a session that Piniella called ''an air-clearing meeting.''

Hans-Joachim Mack, also a West German, who is retiring.


New Car for Ford
LEAD: A two-door Ford coupe to be manufactured at the Mazda Motor Manufacturing Corporation's plant near Detroit will be called the Probe, officials for the Ford Motor Company said.
The vehicle will be sold by Ford dealers beginning in the spring of 1988.
The car was at one time seen as the replacement for Ford's Mustang, but there was resistance to giving the Mustang name to a car assembled in a Japanese-owned plant, The Detroit Free Press reported.


FUTURE FOR AQUINO STIRS U.S. WORRIES
LEAD: Reagan Administration officials today said they were confident that President Corazon C. Aquino would withstand the immediate problems presented by the coup attempt against her Government, but some expressed concern about the longer-term implications.

Answering The Mail
LEAD:  Q. I am having difficulty removing nonskid decal strips from the bottom of my bathtub.
The directions said to soak with detergent, then scrape with a razor blade, but this isn't working very well.
What can you recommend?
A.
Try heating the decals with a hair dryer or heat lamp.
This will soften the adhesive backing so that scraping with a razor blade will be easier.


POSTINGS: Century Conversion; New Attempt
LEAD: Conversion attempts are rarely congenial affairs, but the one at the Century, the twin-towered Art Deco structure at 25 Central Park West, has been even more drawn-out and ugly than most.
Over the last five years, the Attorney General's office rejected a preliminary offering plan because the sponsor, Century Apartments Associates, had failed to disclose about 140 building violations.


Instant Replay: A Nuisance
LEAD: IT sounded like a terrific idea: instant replay to second-guess officials.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Tennis  Svensson Surprises Leconte: Unseeded Jonas B. Svensson of Sweden scored his third straight upset in the $150,000 Hamlet Challenge Cup in Jericho, L.I., by beating seventh-seeded Henri Leconte of France, 6-3, 6-3, in a semifinal match yesterday.
Eighth-seeded David Pate of Las Vegas, Nev., won the other semifinal, beating unseeded Paul Annacone of Bridgehampton, L.I., 7-6, 6-4.


Prosecutors Sue the Bonannos
LEAD: In an unprecedented use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Federal prosecutors last week filed a civil suit aimed at breaking up the Bonanno organized-crime family in much the same way the Government once used the Sherman Antitrust Act to break up the Standard Oil trust.


A Daughter Lost to Faith
LEAD:  LOVINGKINDNESS  By Anne Roiphe. 279 pp. New York: Summit Books. $17.95.


House Hunting
LEAD: IN the nation's capital the remarks must have sounded very near to treason, but Jack Kent Cooke, the owner of the Washington Redskins, said he wanted to find a new home for his National Football League team.
Cooke took pains, to be sure, to make clear that he was not dissatisfied with Washington, the Redskins' home for 51 years, but that he was disenchanted with the confines of R.F.K.


East Germans and Rumanians Sharp
LEAD: East Germany won two of the four heavyweight men's events and Rumania captured three gold medals in the women's races on the first day of the two-day world rowing championships on a wind-swept Lake Bagsvaerd course today.

Louis Cardinals defeated the Atlanta Braves today, 4-2.


Going to Extremes for 'Animal Rights'
LEAD: IT has been more than a century since a group of Victorian Englishmen founded the National Antivivisection Society and won passage of Britain's pioneering Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876.
Now with laboratories in the United States maintaining an annual population of about 20 million ''guinea pigs'' - a diverse menagerie that actually includes dogs, frogs, cats, rats, monkeys, rabbits, goats, gerbils, chickens and armadillos - ''animal rights'' activists are becoming increasingly militant.


Housing Officials' Choice: Asbestos Risk or Arrest
LEAD: Environmental officials say it is dangerous to enter the basement of the old Gertz department store in Queens because of asbestos.
But a Civil Court judge in Manhattan has ruled that it may be just as risky not to.


Take a Quiz and Learn from Answers
LEAD: WHEN I looked around the room on the first day of a summer photography workshop, which I recently taught in England, I could see thousands of dollars worth of gleaming cameras and lenses, most of which were of professional caliber.
But how sophisticated were the participants who were toting them?
Could they tell an ISO speed from an aperture?


A PRICELESS BUT FREE COLLECTION
LEAD: ANTIQUES collectors are a breed unto themselves.
Come the first balmy day, they are up and out scurrying the countryside for whatever it is that they collect.
Up at the crack of dawn, map in hand, these hearty souls have the tenacity of an English bulldog and the motivational drive of a Vince Lombardi.


HOW TO REPAIR METAL FASTENERS
LEAD: STRIPPED or damaged threaded fasteners are a nuisance, especially when you encounter them on hard-to-replace appliance parts, cabinet hardware, furniture fasteners and other items for which substitutes are not likely to be found in hardware stores.
There's a remedy, however.
You can rethread existing fasteners or even make new ones yourself using taps and dies, precision hand tools for cutting threads in metal.


In the Shadow Of the Acropolis, A Struggle Over Cultural Identity
LEAD: EMBLEMS OF AN ATHENS summer: On a warm, Sunday evening, in an amphitheater 1,900 years old on the lea of the Acropolis, Vladimir Ashkenazy plays Schubert and Schumann.
The brilliance billows through old stonework dusted by dusk sliding towards indigo night, and haunted by other, impenetrable gloamings from the past.

LEAD: Steve DeBerg flipped a 4-yard touchdown pass to James Wilder with 1 minute 43 seconds left in the game tonight to give the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a 17-10 exhibition victory over the Washington Redskins.


Fundamentalists Lose on Texts
LEAD: While they have been frustrated in their attempts to have prayer and creationism allowed in public schools, many fundamentalist Protestants feel that an enemy religion called secular humanism has been allowed to slip through the door.
Through textbooks - the only publications that people can be legally required to read - schools are teaching a creed in which man, not God, is the center of all things, the fundamentalists believe.


CORRECTION
LEAD: Because of a film distributor's change in plans, an article on page 17 of the Arts and Leisure section about the film ''Coming Up Roses,'' and a listing in The Guide, section 2A, give outdated information on the film's opening date.

Black Miners Reject Offer
LEAD: In the third week of the nationwide strike of black miners in South Africa, both sides seemed to be holding fast.
The 300,000 miners rejected an offer to end the strike, the costliest and most damaging in South African history.
It has already severely disrupted production in at least half the country's gold mines and a fifth of its coal pits, and is estimated to be costing the companies between $10 million and $15 million a day.


Epic Legends, American Accents
LEAD: Though the British will be amply represented with plays, musicals (notably Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''Phantom of the Opera'') and Peter Brook's epic nine-hour version of ''The Mahabharata,'' this would appear to be far more of an American season than those of recent years, with new plays expected from Lanford Wilson, August Wilson, David Mamet, Horton Foote, Terrence McNally, Beth Henley, Michael Weller, A.


Soviet Ethnic Minorities Take Glasnost Into the Streets
LEAD: WHEN Mikhail S. Gorbachev called last February for ''a revolution of expectations'' in the Soviet Union, he probably did not have in mind the crowd that gathered here in Lithuania last Sunday to chant ''Freedom!

LEAD: To the Editor:


Beware the I.N.F. Risks
LEAD: President Reagan's speech of Aug. 26, which put the arms control issue in the perspective of foreign policy as a whole, is being wrongly dismissed as a ritual gesture to placate his right wing.
We should not allow the important message of the speech to be drowned in the cacophony of dispute over the details of the agreement on intermediate nuclear forces.

WHO WILL WIN THE U.S. OPEN, AND WHY?
LEAD: When it comes to the winner it is hard to go against Ivan Lendl and Steffi Graf.
Both are now No. 1, dedicated and playing their best tennis.

MYSTERIES FROM A NOVELIST NUN
LEAD: PEERING OUT from behind the convent door, she makes you laugh right away as she thrusts out her chest to show off the message on her sweatshirt: ''I'd rather be writing my novel.'' Then she turns, in her patchwork slippers, and scuffles down the linoleum-tiled hallway to her office.
It is there, across the bay from San Francisco, writing long-hand in a green Naugahyde easy chair, that she comes up with popular murder mysteries.


Corinne Neale Is Wed To Patrick McCormick

LEAD: COLLEGE COURSES for our time:


WHO WILL WIN THE U.S. OPEN, AND WHY?
LEAD: It is most likely that one will find Steffi Graf as one of two remaining competitors in the United States Open, held on hardcourts, a medium of grass and clay.
This gives her an even chance against her opponent, whether it be Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova or Gabriela Sabatini.
Graf is halfway to completing her best year in her career as a professional tennis player, so far.

THE TRIUMPH OF AMERICAN DIVAS
LEAD: IT IS GETTING HARD TO remember that opera used to be an imported delicacy, that you had to send for European singers to get it done right.
The Chicago Lyric Opera's nickname was ''La Scala West,'' and Chicago used to scoop New York on hot new singers from Italy.
Now it scoops us on hot new singers from Connecticut.

LEAD: A lawyer for Clayton J. Lonetree, the former Marine sergeant sentenced to 30 years in prison for spying while a member of the American Embassy guard in Moscow, said today that the defense would seek to have the sentence set aside on the ground that prosecutors had ''falsely and emotionally'' portrayed the defendant as the first marine ever convicted of spying.


Folk Festival Will Help the Homeless
LEAD: From a modest beginning in 1981 as an outdoor entertainment for disadvantaged children, New York City's annual Folk Festival has grown into a week-long celebration that will be devoted this year to the theme, ''House the Homeless.''


Giverny, as Monet Painted It and Lived It
LEAD: It must often rain in Giverny, but somehow one doesn't expect it to.
This large garden, and this pink house, will be associated for all time with Claude Monet, the Impressionist painter who is famous for his sunlight, his shimmering poplars, his bright flowers and iridescent sheets of water, for his blurry and brilliant palette - his contemporary critics said of him that he had ''invented light.


TOMATOES, TOMATOES EVERYWHERE
LEAD: THE undeniable appeal of fresh, vine-ripened tomatoes in season makes them a compelling choice for every summer meal.

POSTINGS: A Bit of the Old World; Hillside Condos
LEAD: Copley Court, a new condominium development in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., was designed as a single grand structure draping over a hillside rather than as a series of clustered units for two reasons.

William G. Cahan, who is no slouch as a conversationalist, hit upon a hostess's dream - a topic that not only kept dinner parties humming but engaged the active interest of almost every guest.

Outdoors; New Edition of Book on Decoys Is Timely and Useful
LEAD: THE new edition of William J. Mackey Jr.'s ''American Bird Decoys'' (E. P. Dutton) is both welcome and timely.
Welcome because copies of this bellwether volume, first published in 1965, have become increasingly difficult to find, and timely because there has been an astonishing surge of interest in collecting these hunting artifacts, which were once prized only for their utilitarian function.

Jackson, has been announced by her parents, Virginia R. McElman of Belleaire, Fla., and Evans Rose of Sewickley Heights, Pa.


THE NURSING CRISIS: ANOTHER VIEW
LEAD: MUCH public attention has been focused recently on the critical shortage of nurses.
It is felt no more acutely than by patients who are turned away from hospitals' doors or by physicians who are unable to gain hospital access for their patients.
The vacancy rate for registered nurses in hospitals has more than doubled from 1985 to 1986, to 13.6 percent from 6.3 percent at a time when the Bureau of Labor forecasts a need for an additional 400,000 nurses by 1995.

This is from ''Onward and Upward: A Biography of Katharine S. White'' (Harper &amp; Row) by Linda H. Davis.


TASTEMAKERS
LEAD: SMILE WHEN YOU CALL AN ART worldling a ''tastemaker.'' There's a disreputable tinge to the word, largely because it seems to suggest power used immodestly and also - well, a certain unserious trendiness.
Those with enough clout to make or break taste tend to disclaim the role, and those who are their subjects have a natural reluctance to say so.

A Consumer's Guide to Mental Health Treatment
LEAD: A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS AGO, PSYCHOTHERAPY was an expensive, exotic cure indulged in by a tiny elite, and even as recently as the 1950's only one person in eight had sought it.

LEAD: Parity will play a deciding role in this year's United States Open.

Opposition in Nicaragua Springs to Life - and Into Disunity
LEAD: NICARAGUA'S 11 legal political parties, which range from extreme left to militant conservative, burst into activity last week as a result of the newly signed Central American peace accord.
Most of their energy, however, was directed against each other.
For the four other Central American countries who signed the agreement and for the United States, one of its most important stipulations is the call for free elections, to be held under international observation.

The directions said to soak with detergent, then scrape with a razor blade, but this isn't working very well.
What can you recommend?
A.
Try heating the decals with a hair dryer or heat lamp.
This will soften the adhesive backing so that scraping with a razor blade will be easier.


The Stage Dining Table: Food for Thought
LEAD: IT WAS A MOMENT I HAD BEEN subconsciously waiting for, and when it arrived, I was not surprised.

TWO NEW MUSICCALS IN STATE STAGINGS

POSTINGS: Brownstones; Sales Drop, Prices Rise
LEAD: Sales of Manhattan brownstones dropped off considerably in the first half of the year, falling to 149 from the 199 recorded in the first six months of 1986 and even farther from the 341 in the second half of last year.

West Side's New Road To Ornament Manhattan?
LEAD: THE West Side waterfront, whose shabbiness somehow became all the more unattractive during the more than 15 years of controversy over Westway, is potentially a second Central Park.

Luring People Back to Downtown
LEAD: BEFORE the advent of home video and shopping-mall cinema, going out meant going downtown - to the Loop - where the blazing marquee of the Chicago Theater boasted the hottest names in show business.
But gradually, as in other big cities, downtown became a district to skirt, not stroll.
Fear of crime kept many city and suburban dwellers away, and so did the brand of entertainment - the hard-core pornographic films and the so-called ''action'' movies - being shown in the deteriorating old theaters.

Missiles of October, Then and Now
LEAD: The Cuban missile crisis has become the textbook case of how to win and lose in the nuclear age.
According to the lore, President Kennedy went eyeball-to-eyeball with Nikita Khrushchev, and the Soviet leader blinked and removed his missiles from Cuba.
Twenty-five years later, the story of the crisis is not so simple and it teaches more than toughness.


HONDA IS FIRST ON THE BLOCK TO FLAUNT 4-WHEEL STEERING
LEAD: THE automobile is now 101 or 103 years old, depending on whether you are partial to the German Carl Benz or the Frenchman Edouard Delamare-Deboutteville, both of whom staked credible claim to the invention.
No matter who or when, though, the time of the horseless carriage as a high-tech experiment has long since passed.

Edward Weston's career will be surveyed at the Metropolitan (Sept.


Call It What You Will, It Is Still Child Abuse
LEAD: Unfortunately there is no law against parents who fail to instruct their children about safety on the roadway.
There is a law, however, against parents who fail to provide adequate supervision for children too young to play by themselves in areas unprotected from traffic.
I would hope that Catherine Henningsen had learned about, and acted on, this law by the time her story was published on the Aug.


IRAN'S GUARDS TAKE THE LEAD IN THE MILITARY
LEAD: Iran's Revolutionary Guards, once regarded as an undisciplined group that used suicide tactics and terrorism to supplement conventional military forces, are gaining such new power in the military establishment that they may now be its dominant component, diplomats from several nations here say.


NUCLEAR BACKERS IGNORE REALITIES AND CRY WOLF
LEAD: I strongly disagree with Herbert Jaffe's recent Opinion Page comment about the need for Shoreham  [ ''Shoreham's Critics Ignore Realities'' ] .
For him to espouse these views implies that he is ignoring the last 15 years of mistakes, mismanagement and special interests that have brought us to this point.

Legends and Reunions

You Can Tell a Bookstore by Its Covers
LEAD: CHARLES and Diane Newman bought a bookstore in 1977 and in 1987 they bought another one.

A World In Miniature In Yorkshire

DREAM CARS
LEAD: I was very pleased to read Bill Boggs's article about his '56 Fury.

FALL'S GREAT EXPECTATIONS
LEAD: IT IS A SECRET THAT CANNOT BE KEPT.
Every least thing betrays it.
The first hesitant downward drift of a leaf, for instance.

The highways along the Northeastern corridor, with a boat strapped on top of car after car and every one of them headed for home.

Finding the Perfect 'A' Sparks A Pitched Battle
LEAD: IN A DISORDERLY WORLD, THE scene is soothing, almost pastoral: the symphony orchestra, which has been indulging in seemingly random caterwauling and last-minute warming up, falls respectfully silent as all ears bend to the principal oboe's plaintive A. With the authority invested in him by his title of concertmaster, the principal violinist then picks up the tone and passes it to the orchestra.


A Stop on the D Train: Sand, Sea and Handball
LEAD: New York is a city of many wondrous things.
It is a city where an all-Japanese band plays tangos and where Asian Indians run Mexican restaurants.
And hard as it is to believe when the air smells of exhaust and the street tar bubbles in the heat, it is also a city with a seashore.


Pewter and Bamboo of Kyoto
LEAD: On Teramachi-dori, a street in central Kyoto, small, elegant shops and coffeehouses mark the strolling shopper's progress toward the Imperial Palace grounds.

Corrections

PENN STATION: TALE OF TIRED AND TROUBLED
LEAD: AT 11 o'clock on a recent summer night, a handful of commuters hurried down Seventh Avenue to Pennsylvania Station to catch the next train home to Long Island.
At 35th Street, the clock over the station entrance came into view, a few bulbs out, but enough still burning to illuminate the time.
As usual, it was about three minutes slow: often the difference between making and missing the train.


Plucking Nostalgia From Defeat
LEAD: Any people needs icons, legends, heroes, but never more than when defeated.
As a present garish example, we need look no further than Rambo.
The prostrate, despairing South after Appomattox exalted leaders like Lee, Davis and Jackson and rewrote parts so that cameo players would appear as stars, skirmishes as battles and defeats as victories.

CITY LIFE VS. SUBURBAN SERENTIY
LEAD: LIKE you, I have friends who have recently moved to the city. ''We're free!'' they proclaimed one day while visiting. ''You mean living in the suburbs was like being in prison?'' I asked. ''No, don't get us wrong,'' they replied. ''The suburbs are great while the kids are still - kids.
But now they're out on their own, it's our turn to live a little.

This sounds like a forest on the beach.


To Squalor, With Love
LEAD: WHATEVER happened to squalor?
While re-reading ''Pere Goriot'' I was struck by the splendid description of squalor in the first chapter.
You can feel Balzac's joy - it might be called the joy of description - as he goes through the Maison Vauquer, a boardinghouse for indigents, room by room.
It's such vivid writing - and reading - that I found myself wondering about squalor.

TURKISH AND OTHER DELIGHTS
LEAD: YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED it, but quite a lot of New Yorkers are spoiled. ''What's new?'' they always ask.
But when you tell them, they say ''I've seen it,'' ''I've heard it'' or ''I've read it.'' ''And besides,'' they say, ''it's flawed.''


BILL BRADLEY'S QUALIFICATIONS
LEAD: In explaining why he is not running for the 1988 Democratic nomination for President, Bill Bradley says: ''Winning is not enough.
We need to govern, too'' (''Why Bradley Isn't Running,'' by Randall Rothenberg, Aug. 2).
Senator Bradley's decision, considering he has the political punch to make a strong run, shows a compelling thoughtfulness about what it means to function effectively as the nation's Chief Executive.


Help for the Stretch
LEAD: THE California Angels, in a move to strengthen the club for the American League West pennant run, acquired the veteran second baseman Johnny Ray from the Pittsburgh Pirates yesterday.

William D. Persell.


ENGLAND'S ENDLESS LOVE AFFAIR WITH FARCE
LEAD: WHY IS NEXT SATURDAY A day that can scarcely be ignored by anyone with an interest in British taste, British audiences, indeed the British drama itself?
Not because the National Theater will once again have sold every seat for its thrilling production of ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' nor because the public will be standing in line in case someone returns a ticket for Caryl Churchill's satiric ''Serious Money,'' nor because the scalpers will be out selling seats for ''Les Miserables'' and ''Phantom of the Opera.
