Hartford Stage is Playing to Success
LEAD: FOUR seasons ago, the Hartford Stage Company was going through its worst of times.
Its debt exceeded $400,000, subscriptions had fallen to an all-time low of 8,900 and confidence in the risk-oriented repertory favored by the artistic director, Mark Lamos, was wobbly.
Now, in a turnaround that for dramatic surprise may rival a cunningly crafted play, the company, in its 25th year, is enjoying its best of times.

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Bargains in College Dorms and Youth Hostels
LEAD: IF you are a backpacking type, all the time or occasionally, and cost is more compelling than even such basic amenities as a private bathroom, there are at least two cheaper ways to travel than using minimum-service motels.
These are staying either in hostels or in college dormitory rooms that come open in the summer, where time-warp prices such as $9 and $20 a night are easy to find.

But nothing could be further from the truth at this small place on Main Street in Old Saybrook, which seems to be a model of efficiency.
In limited space with elbow-to-elbow tables and diners waiting to be seated, a no-nonsense staff manages to serve successions of courses with no undue delays.

What Is Too Old?
LEAD: THE WOMAN IS 99, she has fainted several times.
So she is brought by her family to a hospital, where an electrocardiogram shows that her heart is pausing too long between beats.

At the Soviet Congress, Watching Big Brother Squirm
LEAD: EVEN for a country growing accustomed to high-voltage rhetoric, the past week provided a jolt.
The debut of the Congress of People's Deputies - part morality play, part parliamentary improvisation, part exorcism - has gripped the public like no other event in the short history of glasnost.

A Museum Exhibits a Splendid Lack of Glitz
LEAD: In an age in which museums are increasingly grand, elaborate and pretentious, it is refreshing to see one that is grand, elaborate and reasonable.
The Chrysler Museum, which until 1971 was known as the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences, has just completed a $13.5 million expansion and reconstruction that stands out by its refusal to stand out: the building's new wings have been designed not to make an aggressive ''statement'' but to join the disparate parts of the museum into a coherent whole.


Olympic Cover-Up?
LEAD: Did the head of the International Olympic Committee want to suppress the laboratory finding that Ben Johnson had steroids in his system when he set a world record in winning the 100-meter dash at the 1988 Summer Olympics?

PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: After the advent of Jose Raul Capablanca, the brilliant Cuban who held the world championship from his defeat of Emanuel Lasker in Havana in 1921 to his defeat by Alexander Alekhine in Buenos Aires in 1927, the old quantitative idea of mobilizing the pieces was scorned as primitive.
No longer could anyone just ''get 'em out as fast as you can'' and worry later about what to do with them in the middle game.

ISRAEL: MIRED IN THE WEST BANK
LEAD: Does it never occur to Joel Brinkley that the Israeli soldiers he is tagging along with might behave somewhat differently in the presence of an American reporter than they would unaccompanied?

It is situated just off the A1, the Great North Road joining London and Scotland, in a narrow isthmus between the old counties of Rutland and Northamptonshire.
Few places can match it for the wealth and variety of its buildings, but what makes a visit to Stamford so special is the unspoiled charm of the townscape as a whole, with its mix of Gothic spires and Georgian houses, all set off by gentle hills, meadows and the River

LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  MUSIC IN THE MANORS  Since a little history never hurt anyone, including music lovers, today's the day for fanciers of both to get together at either Sagtikos Manor in West Bay Shore or the Joseph Lloyd Manor House in Lloyd Harbor.

Question Of the Week; Should Contracts Be Honored Or Ignored?
LEAD: In the same issue in which you ask, ''Should Contracts Be Honored Or Ignored?'' a front-page article deals with congressmen violating their public trust; an article inside the paper tells of some 40 youths casting aside all civilized bounds and rampaging through Greenwich Village, and the editorial column, most extraordinarily, is devoted to but one subject: the breakdown brought on by the crack epidemic, which threatens ''life itself, at all levels of American society.

Taking No Chances
LEAD: The pitcher's complaint was just a bit of tightness in his left shoulder, but when the shoulder belongs to a gold-medal rookie on a roll you don't want to take any chances.

LEAD: David Bowie's 1987 Stadium extravaganza, the Glass Spider Tour, was overstuffed with dancers, props, videoprojections and fancy lighting effects.

Stranger Off a Train
LEAD: SOME TIME AGO, ignoring signs of a marriage in trouble, my small family and I took a train trip to San Antonio with a friend.

LEAD: Ever since 1967, when ''Hair'' first opened at the Public Theater, many have assumed that somehow our ailing musical-theater tradition would be salvaged by rock-oriented musicians.
In the most optimistic scenario, it was hoped that such leading singer-songwriters of the 60's and 70's as Paul Simon, Randy Newman and James Taylor would graduate from records into the theater and overhaul

Rambo Dancer Wins a Photo Finish

LEAD: Thomas Friedman's article on Israel is just the kind of incisive and illuminating article one expects from this Pulitzer Prize-winning writer.
He always comes up with new insights that clarify the tortured situation of Israel and its neighbors.


Rolling Stone Keith Richards at 45
LEAD: KEITH RICHARDS'S FACE shows an odd mixture of relief and satisfaction as he reviews his latest chart success.
The 45-year-old rock star is interred in the back seat of a limousine, and New York City's rush hour is advancing his reputation for excessive lateness.
The triumph under discussion is not another Rolling Stones record, but a doctor's appointment - ''My first in nine years,'' Richards exults - required by contract for all band members before commencing a tour.


State-Run Success
LEAD: To the Editor:


Amid Green Fields, the Shadow of War
LEAD: WE had not planned to stop last summer at an infantry museum in Bodmin, Cornwall.

POSTINGS: Diamonds Downtown; Condos Atop a Jewelry Exchange
LEAD: While most New Yorkers associate jewelry sales with the Diamond District around West 47th Street in midtown Manhattan, many old-line jewelers originally set up shop on the Lower East Side a century ago.

Hollywood's Indy Envy
LEAD: Keeping up with the Joneses has taken on new meaning in Hollywood.
In this case it is a trilogy of adventure movies about Indiana Jones, the intrepid archeologist, that has other movie makers envious.

A Call for Steps that Ease Traffic and Aid the Environment
LEAD: WE must find a solution to traffic congestion that is both cost effective and friendly to the environment.
There are no simple solutions since increasing taxes for new highways is politically unpopular and many proposed routes for new roads go through fragile wetlands and water supplies.


Ratepayers' Rebellion Is Not Far Off
LEAD: ''Shoreham: Pressures and Prospects''  [ May 14 ]  was fair and objective.
However, the existing litigation to have the Cuomo-Lilco agreement declared invalid and the recent introduction by Governor Cuomo of legislation to try to legalize the Long Island Power Authority's taking title to Shoreham should be added to the pressures and prospects.


Two Views of a View Bring a Lawsuit

Any Way You Slice It, Graf Is the Best
LEAD: What everyone is saying about Steffi Graf, they say about the dominant player in every generation.

LEAD: To help the House bind its wounds.
To guide it back to a public-policy focus.
To address ethical problems.
These are the announced priorities of the new Speaker, Representative Tom Foley of Washington, in the wake of last week's leadership upheavals, and he lists them in that order.


An Accountant's Debt
LEAD: It was crime-busting with a sculptor's bust.
Eighteen years ago, John E. List, a churchgoing accountant in Westfield, N.J., vanished after his mother, wife and three children were found shot to death in their home.
The search for the fugitive was futile until the case was featured on May 21 on a television program, ''America's Most Wanted,'' with a bust, shown here, depicting what the fugitive might look like now, with wrinkles and a receding hairline.

A One-Two Punch at Education
LEAD: Public education in New York City is reeling from two blows in one month.

NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Augusta, Me.; Farm Buffer Zone Faulted
LEAD: THE Maine Association of Realtors and a host of property owners are working to change a state law passed last year that bars development within 150 feet of a registered farm.
They say the law favors the farmer at the expense of the individual landowner because the 150-foot buffer zone is on the abutter's, not the farmer's, land.


Nasty Reviews
LEAD: To the Editor:


Deaths of 19 Prostitutes Pose a Mystery in Miami
LEAD: The circumstances suggest foul play.
The bodies of all 19 women were found in the same section of the city in outside areas like fields, or they were behind buildings.
Yet medical examiners said they had found no wounds on the bodies, no bruises, no scratches, no needle marks.
Nothing.

LEAD: Many people intend to move when they retire, looking for a more attractive life style, perhaps, or to be closer to family.


After a Home Is Sold, It's Just a House

We are removing our furniture, photographs and housewares that are the expressions of three generations.
The house once belonged to my grandparents but they are no longer alive.
It was my uncle's house next, but he, too, died.
Now it is no one's and everyone's - a part of my uncle's estate.


Canada's St. Andrews by the Sea
LEAD: By 6:40 the sun's been up for two hours in St.
Andrews, New Brunswick, yet still its strange, boreal light looms low on the horizon.
The surrounding hills, covered with coniferous forest and checkered with tawny fields, roll to a granite shoreline gouged 10,000 years ago by receding glaciers.
On the water, a few wisps of morning sea smoke drift in raggedly from Fundy Bay; they'll soon burn off as daylight stirs the crisp night air.


O.A.S. Draws Latin Fire for Stand on Panama
LEAD: The decision of Latin American countries to cooperate with Washington's efforts to seek ''a regional solution'' to the crisis in Panama through the Organization of American States has generated widespread criticism and skepticism in the hemisphere.

ISRAEL: MIRED IN THE WEST BANK
LEAD: Mr.
Friedman blames Israel's leadership for not picking up the telephone to call for peace with its neighbors.
However, Israel's leadership has been talking and meeting with Jordan's King Hussein for over 20 years, trying to hammer out some compromise solution.
But Hussein's primary goal is survival, and he has disappointed both the Israelis and the Americans many times.


Rabbi Disputes Report of His Views
LEAD: Herbert Hadad's article ''A Leader of P.L.O.
Is to Speak''  [ May 14 ]  misquotes my words and severely distorts my attempt to build bridges of understanding between Arabs and Jews.
In its distortion of my statement, The Times inflames passions on a topic already too hot for reasonable dialogue.
The article's manipulation of facts and quotations makes it more difficult for the moderates of both sides to establish the middle ground of understanding on which peace might be established.

FROM JOHN SAYLES, A FLAWED HERO FOR THE 90'S

LEAD: The tax storm brewing now (''In Suffolk, Tax Revolt Gathers Steam,'' May 14) pales compared to a tax cyclone forming on the horizon.

Question Of the Week; Should Contracts Be Honored Or Ignored?
LEAD: One of the components leading to the probable decline and fall of the American Empire is dishonesty.

After a four-month review of American foreign policy, it all came down to a long weekend at President Bush's Kennebunkport home.
By all accounts the President was angry.
His mountain of papers, the product of his bureaucracy's much ballyhooed effort to set the framework for his Administration's foreign and defense policies, had produced a mouse.

LEAD: Two Soviet veterans of Afghanistan and two American veterans of Vietnam met in a Manhattan office on Thursday to talk about some of the things they have in common: the wars they did not win, the comrades they loved and lost, the loneliness of coming home to people who do not always understand what war does to the soldiers who fight it, and the utter futility of fighting for causes that have been abandoned by their

CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost; Playground Safety
LEAD:  It's important to inspect and maintain outdoor playground equipment, and now is a good time to do it.

Mobile Phones, as Prices Drop, Aren't Just for Work Anymore

Connecticut's Precarious Tax Solution
LEAD: IN the 1930's, when state legislatures began enacting the first comprehensive taxes, economists adopted a homely model called ''the three-legged stool'' to describe the system that seemed to work best.
One leg was a property tax, the second was a sales tax and the third was an income tax.
Without any one of the legs, so the theory went, a tax system would be unstable over the long haul because the other taxes would have to be too high.

A Few More Notes About Recordings

His wooziness comes from air pockets and turbulence, for his daily commute is to


In Peru's Lush Rain Forest
LEAD: ONCE over the snowy peaks of the Andes, all that can be seen on the flight to Puerto Maldonado, in the Amazon's southern headwaters, is an enormous dark green sea of forest.
The only breaks are small clearings, increasingly frequent near the city, and rivers, gleaming silver in the tropical sun.
Puerto Maldonado is the capital city of Madre de Dios, a Peruvian department that contains the largest area of pristine rain forest in the entire Amazon basin.

Fignon, again withstanding the pursuit of his closest rivals in a tough mountainous leg from La Spezia to Prato, placed third yesterday, 46 seconds behind the winner but in the same time as a group of seven cyclists including his top challengers, Flavio Giupponi of Italy and Andrew Hampsten of the United States.

Joseph A. DeAndrea performed the ceremony.


Capricious Regulation Is the Market's Foe
LEAD: Decades of ideological wrangling over the role of government has led us to choose between regulation and deregulation, as if we were deciding whether to handcuff American business or uncuff it.
The cuffs were removed in the late 1970's and 1980's.
Now the cuffs may go back on.
But if the 1990's turn into the decade of re-regulation, we will be right back where we started - with commands emanating from Washington, shackling

Loan Enforcers Focus on Trade Schools

LEAD: Communism as a political idea, a movement claiming a hold on the minds of men and women, has played a powerful part in world history for more than 70 years.
That period came to an end last week.

Where the Swiss Take a Break

These Alpine guesthouses are a national institution, beloved by the Swiss; they often afford an American visitor a chance to catch an intimate glimpse, almost a family view, of the

THE IDEAL SUMMER BOOKS: HUGE, SCARY, WATERPROOF
LEAD: I came to love summer reading back in the 1950's, when I spent my summers at a camp located in Dutchess County right near a New York State mental hospital.
We campers had four major activity options: sports, nature, crafts and reading.
I ruled out sports, which consisted primarily of swimming in a lake filled with a murky, dark-green waterlike substance.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Dismaying Moan Ends Belmont Gala
LEAD: Nothing empties a race track before the last race faster than a beaten odds-on choice in the eighth.


Test On Skills Is Warped
LEAD: TO protect citizens from themselves, the state sometimes produces a well-intentioned program that eventually becomes so warped from its original intent that it causes grave dangers.
The New Jersey High School Proficiency Test is such a program.
Some background: People were (and are) appalled by the limited skills in reading, writing and mathematics of public high school graduates, especially those of poor and urban high schools.


The Antheneum Displays The Show it Sent to France
LEAD: IN addition to being the oldest art museum in the country, the Wadsworth Atheneum has proved itself able to supply the wherewithal for a show representing the United States at the French bicentennial celebrations.
Titled ''200 Years of American Painting,'' the exhibit was displayed at Galeries Lafayette, the Paris department store, and has now returned to


Reagan Optimistic on China
LEAD: Former President Ronald Reagan says he thinks the democracy movement in China will in time prevail.

When the Kids Must Fly Solo
LEAD: EVERY year Americans send more children on air trips by themselves.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My house is heated with baseboard heating and has been troubled by gurgling and banging noises.
The plumber put in a relief valve near the boiler to eliminate the gurgling noises, but said the other noises were due to expansion of the pipes and vanes.
I think there is air in the pipes.
Bleeder valves are in each heating zone, but I don't know how to eliminate the trapped air, nor whether this will cure the problem.


But Not A Drop to Drink? The Water Scam

Review/Dance; Dreams and Commentary In Sally Silvers Program
LEAD: Sally Silvers presented a typically provocative evening of dance on June 3 at Performance Space 122.
Miss Silvers' costume designs bring extra humor, color and a lot of chic to the enterprise.
She has a keen sense of her dancers and most of her dances offer revelations about them.
But her dances - and the improvisational scores they are set to - are full of small knots and fascinating tangles.


Johnson to Take the Stand
LEAD: Thirty-nine witnesses have appeared over the last 10 weeks, and the weight of testimony by those close to Ben Johnson seems to suggest that the sprinter not only took performance-enhancing drugs for years, but knew what drugs he was taking, what benefits they brought him and what side effects he risked.


Reviews/Dance; Preserving Work by Predecessors

Filling a Twin Operatic Bill From Out of Left Field
LEAD: Glimmerglass Opera, with its pastoral, lakeside setting near Cooperstown, N.Y., has been called an American Glyndebourne, though its general director, Paul Kellogg, objects to the label, saying, ''I hope we have enough personality of our own.'' Various elements make the 15-year-old opera company unusual among regional opera troupes.


Nothing to Sink Your Teeth Into
LEAD: FIRST OF ALL, let me say that my visit to Procter &amp; Gamble was an enormous thrill for me, apart from the sucrose polyester I got to taste.
For one thing, I had always wanted to dine in the Procter &amp; Gamble kitchen, and I wasn't disappointed.
It was neat, and I mean that literally.

LEAD:  I'LL TAKE IT  By Paul Rudnick.  292 pp. New York:  Alfred A. Knopf. $18.95.


DID THE PENALTY FIT THE CRIME?
LEAD: What I found upsetting was not so much Professor Frazier's plagiarism as Paul Scatena's eagerness to nail a big gun.
Anyone who would put off his doctorate to spend, for three months, ''the equivalent of a month of eight-hour days'' investigating might have his motivations considered suspect.


Environmental Groups Gain in Wake of Spill
LEAD: Public support for environmental organizations has apparently increased since March, when the largest oil spill in American history fouled the waters of Prince William Sound in Alaska.


Charting Traditions Of Nontraditional Photography
LEAD: The National Museum of American Art in Washington has proved that there is more than one way to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the invention of photography.
While some museums have mounted historical surveys and others have zeroed in on the medium's earliest achievements, the National Museum has focused on photography's burgeoning present, a time of runaway growth and influence.


Cancer Comes Home
LEAD: WELCOME TO MY home and hospital,'' says Richard Wahlenmeier.
This is Wahlenmeier's joke, but it's accurate.
In his New York living room there are two couches, three shelves, a coffee table, wall-to-wall carpeting and, on the wood parquet by the front door, a metal pole supporting a computerized infusion pump and a bag of thick fluid.

ACCIDENTS DECLINE
LEAD: Despite a dramatic increase in the number of people riding bicycles in Manhattan, accidents involving bicycles and pedestrians have decreased for the third consecutive year, a recent study by the New York City Department of Transportation shows.


Corrections
LEAD: An article last Sunday about support within South Africa for economic sanctions omitted the position taken in 1985 by the Congress of South African Trade Unions.
The congress said it supported foreign companies' divestiture of South African holdings.
In recent months the congress has not issued similar public calls for foreign companies to leave.


AMAZING SPACE
LEAD: Something as utilitarian as a superbly organized closet or as frivolous as the elaborate trimming on a pair of curtains can make a space memorable.
So can a sleek kitchen designed and placed as artfully as a giant sculpture or a master bathroom whose architectural shell is as elaborately crafted and furnished as an 18th-century drawing room.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My house is heated with baseboard heating and has been troubled by gurgling and banging noises.
The plumber put in a relief valve near the boiler to eliminate the gurgling noises, but said the other noises were due to expansion of the pipes and vanes.
I think there is air in the pipes.
Bleeder valves are in each heating zone, but I don't know how to eliminate the trapped air, nor whether this will cure the problem.


U.S. SEES PAKISTAN MOVING ON A-ARMS
LEAD: Despite Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assurances this week that Pakistan does not intend to produce a nuclear bomb, the Bush Administration believes Pakistan is pressing ahead with some aspects of a weapons program, according to Administration officials.


ART BOOKS
LEAD: Over the last year or two, and not before we needed them, several new kinds of art books have come into view.
Though the work of disciplined minds, none of them is the kind of book in which one professional addresses a handful of others.
Some of them are powered by detective work on a broad social base.


Garden Party, And a Party For a Garden
LEAD: The rain came for the third year in a row, but it didn't dampen the Museum of Modern Art's Party in the Garden dinner-dance Wednesday.
The festivities were moved indoors.
No one seemed to mind, and the museum raised $250,000.
This year, 1,800 guests drifted among three floors, riding up and down the escalators like shoppers in a department store.


DID THE PENALTY FIT THE CRIME?
LEAD: There are some who will feel Paul Scatena is a noble whistle blower.
The fact that he is a graduate student (although not one who worked with Dr. Frazier) may reinforce this view, because many of us know that leading professors routinely run graduate programs as feudal fiefdoms.
As a third-year law student at Yale Law School, I have witnessed several instances in which professors have appropriated the intellectual property of students.


In Hong Kong, Black Signs to Denote Horror
LEAD: Rachel Wong, a school teacher here, said this week that when she stepped into her high school classroom, ''many of the students just began to cry.''


Sanchez Surprises Graf to Win the French Open
LEAD: The stop here on the road to a second straight Grand Slam in tennis seemed to be a routine one for Steffi Graf.
Her most serious challengers were either skipping the French Open or were eliminated in earlier rounds.


Despite Tests, Turin Shroud Is Still Revered
LEAD: It is eight months since radiocarbon tests showed it to be inauthentic, but the Shroud of Turin retains its allure for believers who venerate it as the burial cloth of Jesus.


Europe Vote? Some Britons Hardly Know
LEAD: Sir Jack Stewart-Clark has represented East Sussex in the European Parliament for 10 years.
Today he went out on the streets of this prosperous town in the rolling English countryside of The Weald to ask people to give him their vote again in the European elections next Thursday.


How Do Museums Speak the Unspeakable?
LEAD: Last year the United States Holocaust Memorial Council in Washington issued a list of institutions and organizations that were related to the Holocaust.
On the roster were 19 museums, 48 resource centers, 34 archival facilities, 12 Holocaust memorials and 26 research institutes.
In the United States and abroad, edifices, museums, memorials, monuments and sculptures are being erected with near feverish intensity.


Field of Reality
LEAD: The farmer who owns the infield of Iowa's best-known baseball field, the one used in the movie ''Field of Dreams,'' said he was beginning to regret his decision to keep the place groomed.
The outfield, meanwhile, is back to corn. ''The way I'm beginning to look at it is, maybe keeping it was a mistake,'' said Don Lansing of Dyersville, Iowa.


Grace Vance Has Wedding
LEAD: Grace Roberts Vance, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Cyrus Roberts Vance of New York, was married yesterday at St.

Their responses follow:  Roy Blount Jr.
Author of ''Now, Where Were We?

PASTIMES: Around the Garden
LEAD: For This Week: Recent rainfall has spurred growth of grass, shrubs, trees and flowering plants.
Prune back this exuberance on hedges, especially yew, hemlocks, spruces; thin trees where needed; mow again and keep the blades set to cut high, no lower than two inches; pinch back petunias, snapdragons, marigolds, geraniums, lantanas and other flowering plants that may need discipline.


Earthquakes in the Communist World
LEAD: In China, what began only weeks ago as new hope for democracy now seems to be trailing off into old repression.
A Poland that imposed martial law in 1981 has just completed a free election that legitimized opposition.
The new Soviet Congress does not recognize the idea of loyal opposition, but daily listens to critical voices.


Correction
LEAD: A chart last week showing the percent of American patents issued to residents of foreign countries gave an incorrect date.

A surprising number of Martinu's countless works are just as appealingly fresh and cosmopolitan as are his three cello sonatas.

NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  Dream House


DID THE PENALTY FIT THE CRIME?
LEAD: I was a teaching fellow at Harvard during the late 1960's; at that time, plagiarism was a plague there.
Students felt they had a right to get through any way they could to avoid the draft, and many teachers looked the other way, out of sympathy to the anti-Vietnam movement.
The result was that the university's attitude toward scholarship itself changed; what had previously been grounds for expulsion became, by the early 1970's, merely an academic peccadillo.

CHINA TRADE

They sailed to Hawaii, they crossed the Formosa Strait and the China Sea, as well as the Strait of Malacca to the Malay Peninsula and beyond to Indonesia.

As the Temperature Rises, Simplicity May Be in Order
LEAD: SOMETIMES the best meals are the simplest.

Q and A
LEAD:  Vermont


Review/Theater; Illusion vs. Reality, in 'The Tablets'
LEAD: Armand Schwerner's sly and sophisticated sequence of poems called ''The Tablets,'' published in the 1960's and 70's, make up a wonderful, riddling text on illusion and reality, on communication and misunderstanding and the limits of speech.

I don't like to be too low.

Changing, Unchanging Nantucket
LEAD: On and off for more than two decades, I have been vacationing on Nantucket, lured by its beaches, moorlands, magnificent mansions, cobblestone streets, history as a famed whaling port and insularity.

PERSPECTIVES: The Article 7A Program; Strengthening the Court's Appointees

Rural Towns Fight Plans for A Dump
LEAD: THE criteria for a site for a low-level radioactive dump narrow the choice to largely rural areas, and many elected officials feel that is one more burden for small towns.


Better Sound, Bigger Sales and Bitter Rivalry
LEAD: Since the 1950's, music and cars have been inseparable parts of the national iconography.
But the image of a convertible with a tinny AM radio straining to project the Top 40 above the roar of the engine and the rush of air has faded.


Shipboard Music Becomes Shipshape
LEAD: When the king of England wanted a little water music, he loaded Georg Friedrich Handel on a barge, along with a bunch of other musicians, and shipped out on the Thames.

For 60 seconds, Lebenthal talks about the wisdom of investing in bonds and makes a pitch for his ''Bond of the Day.


Sports of The Times; The Dreaded Damaged Hamstring
LEAD: Before the Detroit Pistons and the Los Angeles Lakers resume the National Basketball Association finals today, Commissioner David Stern should proclaim, ''May the better hamstrings emerge triumphant.'' As well as untorn and unpulled.


The Bloodstram Express
LEAD: IT IS A FILM SET UNLIKE MOST, A rubberized and plasticized vision of the human body's insides.
And according to Dave Carson, the film's special-effects director, it differs from most of the sets built by the company he works for, George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic. ''We're used to working with miniatures and foot-long spaceships,'' says Carson, who is a veteran of such I.L.M.


Nadine Aubort Weds Violinist
LEAD: Nadine Eliane Aubort, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

PASTIMES: Gardening; A Basic Glossary for Newcomers
LEAD: Gardeners speak a peculiar language.
They pinch their plants, deadhead them and prick them.
When all is said and done, they cover everything with mulch.
Those who have been in this game for some time, use this language freely.
But those who are new, often wonder what they are talking about.


Keeping Watch On Young Eagles

Wichita State Captures Title
LEAD: Wichita State won its first N.C.A.A. baseball title today as Greg Brummett tied a record with his third College World Series victory and Pat Meares hit a two-run homer in a 5-3 victory over Texas.

It was the eighth title game for Texas, which has won four times.


Political Memo; Attack Shows G.O.P. Strategy Shift
LEAD: The uproar this week over a Republican National Committee memorandum attacking House Speaker Thomas S. Foley underscored an important shift in Republican politics under President Bush: putting control in the national committee headquarters, not the White House.


Faked Out By Zethel
LEAD: UNTIL I SAW LAST season's National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game between the University of Tennessee and Auburn, I hadn't watched a game of women's basketball for decades.
I wasn't surprised that both teams played skillfully.

A Celebration of Beauty in the Wild
LEAD: MARGARET McCARRICK stepped gingerly over a soggy bog in Willington.

SURPRISE FROM ROSE'S CANTINA
LEAD: The Belmont Stakes was the last of four stakes races on a rich card at Belmont Park yesterday, and one of the supporting features provided one of the biggest upsets of the season.


Review/Opera; New Staging of Monteverdi 'Poppea'
LEAD: ''Personen-Regie'' is a German term for a stage director's work with actors, as opposed to any grander conceptual conceits.
Peter Sellars, for instance, is often brilliant at such subtleties, even if they are usually obscured in his detractors' eyes by his gags and updatings.

Kindergarten Teacher Is Held in Crack Raid
LEAD: A kindergarten teacher and three other people were arrested on charges of possession of crack early today, when the Suffolk County police raided a motel in Huntington Station.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Let's hope it never happens, that we'll never be in a position where we have to trim whatever standard of living we now enjoy (or perhaps endure).
But unless one is particularly affluent, there are times when, in order to do one thing, something else has to go.


Street Smarts
LEAD: James G. Watt may not know a lot about the housing industry, but he does know the street value of a former Cabinet member's influence with housing officials.
Appearing last week before a House panel investigating accusations of influence-peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the former Interior Secretary was asked what he had done to earn a $300,000 consulting fee from the developer of a 300-unit H.U.D.-financed housing project.


Keeping The Home Fires Burning (While The Masters Are Away)
LEAD: It was a great old house like those of the 1930's movies, in which ''Long Island'' meant luxury without saying anything else.
It overlooked the Sound, but that winter day when Ann Pearson and her daughter, Mandy, moved in, there wasn't much of a view.
A big snowstorm had blown up, borne on strong winds.

Diarams of the Pan Am's and NWA's 1988 route system (pg. 1); chart of comparative strengths and assests of NWA and Pan Am (pg. 14); Pan Am's Bold Bid to Survive
LEAD: When Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman of the Pan Am Corporation last year, a large map depicting what remained of the airline's once vast worldwide route system adorned the hall outside his office.

London
LEAD: To the Editor: I read with delight Claire Frankel's article on Neal's Yard (''A London Enclave of Whole Foods,'' Travel, April 30), a place I have recommended frequently.

The Rev.
J.
Seymour Flinn performed the ceremony.


SEATS OF POWER
LEAD: CONSIDER THE BOSS'S CHAIR.
A MUTE OBJECT, YOU might think, a mere agglomeration of steel springs and upholstery - just a place to sit.
In fact, the chair chosen by top executives is a great deal more than that.
It is a totem, a symbol of power, and it projects an intriguing, if subliminal, message.


Correction
LEAD: The Databank table on page 14 in some copies of Sunday Business today misstates the current prime rate.


East Meets West, With Sousa, Sails and Greasepaint
LEAD: SOUSA'S ''Stars and Stripes Forever'' is not commonly heard at concerts in Leningrad nor do Russian actors often have a chance to join in a chorus from ''Guys and Dolls.'' And collegiate sailors from Moscow do not usually race yachtsmen from Yale.
But these events are under way and illustrate the increasing ways that American and

Art, Dissent and Legislative Wrath
LEAD: IN March, amid daily protests by veterans and other patriotic-minded citizens, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago exhibited an American flag spread on the floor.
The student work invited people to ''confront their feelings'' about symbols and patriotism and to step on the flag if they chose.


DID THE PENALTY FIT THE CRIME?
LEAD: As someone whose academic career was destroyed by undisclosed objections from unidentified sources, I was not surprised by the harshness of Dr.
Frazier's experience.
Particularly before tenure, academic review is characterized more by star-chamber secrecy than by constitutional due process.
The criminally accused have far more legal protection in our society.


A Day Out of Padua
LEAD: THE vast plain that surrounds Venice by land is unobstructed but for a cluster of cone-shaped, green-clad mounds that rise on the outskirts of Padua - the Euganean Hills.
The hills are volcanic in origin, and their eastern valleys are dotted with hot springs known since ancient times for the therapeutic qualities of their waters and mud.


Why the U.S. Is Urged To Think Again About Afghanistan
LEAD: PRESSURE is building on the Bush Administration to undertake a fundamental reappraisal of American policy toward Afghanistan.
The pressure has come mainly from Congress, but also from Pakistan, Washington's staunch ally in the 10-year campaign to get Soviet troops out of Afghanistan, and it appears to have resulted in a shift of tone, at least.

LEAD: A new wave of violence in the northeastern state of Assam by tribespeople using homemade bombs, guns, and bows and arrows has caused widespread destruction and displaced hundreds of people.


Road Not Taken Gets Spruced Up
LEAD: Digging ditches, moving boulders or cutting trees is not everyone's idea of a fun holiday, but increasing numbers of people are doing just that on weekends and even on vacations.
Throughout the Northeast, there are networks of hiking and cross-country trails that constantly need maintenance, and volunteers are constantly needed to do this work.

Preparing Outdoor Furniture
LEAD: WHEN summer comes, lawn, patio and picnic furniture often needs cleaning or repairing before it can be used.
Getting these items ready may consist only of spraying them with a garden hose or dusting with a whisk broom or soft brush; however, with a bit more care, outdoor items can be maintained for years in like-new condition.

Question Of the Week; Did Pitino Make The Right Move?
LEAD: For a man of Rick Pitino's status, a collegiate coaching job would have come along any time.
And the job would not be with a team that is under three years of probation.
However, the chance of coaching the Knicks to an N.B.A. championship only comes around once (if that often).
Pitino sounds as if he may already be regretting the move as he talks of leaving the Knick job incomplete and assuring fans that the new coach will get that title.


Special Education: Promise, Not Privilege
LEAD: Jane Goldblatt's letter (''Special Education Isn't Sacrosanct,'' May 14) gives new meaning to the words ''misguided'' and ''cynical.''

Dispute Grows Over Cleanup of Florida Dump
LEAD: Ten feet from a row of modest houses here, a wire fence with a ''no trespassing'' notice indicates the boundary of an inactive landfill.

TRAVEL BOOKS
LEAD: On a recent trip to China, I found myself in one of the most un-Chinese spots on the planet.
The arcades of the Lido Holiday Inn function much like an airtight space station floating in the dusty, funless void of Beijing.
Outside, the winter winds howled off the Gobi Desert, but all was cozy in the pizzeria - crammed between the German sausage shop, a disco for ''overseas Chinese only'' and the city's only bowling lanes - as yesterday's pigtailed Maoists served the masses thick pies dripping with that indigestible heathen delight called mozzarella.


Prospects; A Discrimination Decision
LEAD: Last Monday, the Supreme Court ruled on an employment discrimination case, Wards Cove Packing v.

'Fra Angelico of Satanism' Shines at Harvard
LEAD: The display of Aubrey Beardsley's works at Harvard University's Arthur M. Sackler Museum through July 9 is the sort of casually splendid show that only an institution with a first-rate collection can mount.
It happened almost by chance.
A traveling exhibition destined for the Sackler fell through, leaving a gap in the museum's schedule and providing Miriam Stewart, a curatorial associate in the drawings department, with the opportunity to cobble together what Harvard possesses in

Father's Day Gifts With a Twist on Tradition
LEAD: Next Sunday is Father's Day, and somehow even creative people find their imaginations grinding to a halt when it comes to buying a gift.
Unless there is a hobby like golf or stamp collecting to give direction to the quest, a child or wife can feel totally at sea.
Hence the decision to buy something ''safe'' like a striped tie or a plain white shirt.

Already, China and the


A Refreshing Look At a Status Symbol
LEAD: Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra is one of the handful of 20th-century works to have entered the standard repertory.
For orchestras, it represents what the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto represents for violinists: a work that simply must be mastered, if only as a status symbol.
No wonder, then, that Bartok's concerto has received dozens of recordings since its first performance on Dec.


CAMPUS LIFE: Lafayette; Preservationists Defeated As Bulldozer Settles Debate
LEAD: Preservationists and some students and alumni at Lafayette College believed that the campus's Delta Upsilon fraternity house was destined to become a landmark.

LEAD: Thanks to Rick Pitino (and the Knick players) for bringing the thrill of competitive basketball back to New York.

Candlewood Entices A Broadway Actor
LEAD: FIND an accomplished performer with impressive credentials in musical theater and give him the leading role in one traditional favorite and the directorial reins of another.

TALKING: Resort Deals; Buying Condos to Rent Out
LEAD: MANY people looking for a vacation home are tempted to buy a condominium or co-op that is part of a hotel or motel resort complex.

The plumber put in a relief valve near the boiler to eliminate the gurgling noises, but said the other noises were due to expansion of the pipes and vanes.

A Piano Giant Is Rescued From Ghostdom
LEAD: When piano buffs get together to talk about the great ones, the names of Hofmann, Rachmaninoff, Lhevinne, Cortot and Friedman invariably come up.
Seldom is the ghost of Leopold Godowsky (1870-1938) invoked.

There never was, until a short time ago, any transfer of the Godowsky 78-r.p.m.

JACK KEMP FACES REALITY

LEAD: Interest rates headed down, with banks lowering the prime rate by half a percentage point, to 11 percent.

In May 1988, the prime was 8.5 percent.


Yankees Are Buried by 19 Red Sox Hits
LEAD: The Yankees took their best shot at Roger Clemens yesterday, but the wicked grounder that Deion Sanders hit in the first inning wasn't enough to knock the Red Sox ace out of the game.

Managua May Free 39 Somoza Men
LEAD: In the heart of the maximum security prison here there is a small, unyielding colony from another Nicaragua.


As the Temperature Rises, Simplicity May Be in Order
LEAD: SOMETIMES the best meals are the simplest.
As the weather warms up, I find myself less inclined to make complicated recipes.
Instead, I'd rather use a few very fresh ingredients to add flavor: herbs from the garden, good extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice and plenty of pepper.


Seth Kaplan Wed To Barbara Lewis
LEAD: Barbara Gail Lewis, a first vice president at the Ruder-Finn public relations agency in New York, and Seth Adam Kaplan, a partner at the New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, were married last evening by Rabbi Amiel Wohl at the East River Yacht Club in New York.

WHERE THE ACE IS KING
LEAD: ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS, THE BACK ROOM of Reuben's, a Manhattan delicatessen, rings with the hubbub of hocus-pocus.
Seated in clusters around the Formica tables, munching on frankfurters and sipping coffee, amateur magicians from all over the city take turns performing their latest tricks for an audience of their peers.

The Rev.
Ralph E. Ahlberg, a United Church of Christ minister, officiated.


Midnight Writers Defacing the L.I.E.
LEAD: AS the saying goes, Rome was not built in a day, but I doubt that Caesar tolerated destruction while under construction.
So why can't one of the greatest cities in the world at the latter part of the 20th century keep the Long Island Expressway free of graffiti?


Question Of the Week; Did Pitino Make The Right Move?
LEAD: Rick Pitino took Boston University to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in 1983 for the first time in 24 years.
He took Providence College to the Final Four in 1987 but came up short of winning the crown.
This season he led the Knicks to the second round of the playoffs, still short of the National Basketball


PASTIMES: Stamps
LEAD: The humble 3-cent Jefferson, that squarish purple profile that seemed ubiquitous - indeed, was ubiquitous - throughout the 1940's and 50's, has come back into its own as a stamp that collectors collect.


COOKBOOKS
LEAD: A few years ago, while I was collaborating on a cookbook with the chef and columnist Pierre Franey, I was certain that the great popularity of recipe books would crest any minute and then dissipate.
After all, who could be cooking all these dishes?
How long would it take before people realized there are only so many ways to prepare a stew, grill fish, bake a cake?


The Passing Playlets of City Politics
LEAD: For a campaign that hasn't caught fire yet, New York's mayoral race has already been a long one.
Long on speculation, that is.
Every few weeks the spin doctors and kibbitzers settle on a new version of who's ahead.
It's speculation with a New York accent - an arrogant certainty that each passing theory is permanent insight.


BRAWLEY ADVISERS BATTLE INQUIRIES
LEAD: Eight months after a New York State grand jury found that Tawana Brawley fabricated her tale of abduction and rape at the hands of a group of white men, the young woman's lawyers, C.

A Family Show On and Off the Air
LEAD: ROD ROSS, the host on WPKN-FM, switched on a cut from Paul Simon's ''Graceland'' album, slipped off his headset and waited.

Atlanta Places Its Bets On a New Underground
LEAD: Throughout the 1970's, Underground Atlanta was a raucous monument to the city's coming of age, a gas-lighted hodgepodge of downtown shops and bars where Emory University fraternity boys wooed their dates over Flaming Hurricane cocktails and the segregationist former Gov.
Lester Maddox peddled autographed pick handles and ''Wake Up America'' alarm clocks.


The Ins and Outs of Life In a Tall Neighborhood
LEAD: ONE cold and rainy day I sent my 4-year-old son, Eddie, out to play, dressed only in his sweatpants, Mickey Mouse T-shirt and bedroom slippers.
In our case, though, ''out to play'' means his scampering over to the apartment next door and saying, ''Can I play with Evan for a while?'' As simply as that, my son had an hour with a friend, and

LEAD: ''Productivity's Little Secret: Hard Work,'' a Business Forum article appearing on May 14 by Dan Subotnik, prompted an unusually large response from readers.
Some of their comments follow.
To the Editor:


Rap Groups Are Getting a Glitzy Edge
LEAD: When rap first impinged on the consciousness of mainstream America, back in the mid-1970's, its visual appeal seemed more attitude than showmanship.
The voice of the urban streets, the rhyming, cadenced poetry of rap was proclaimed by young men (mostly) who wanted to look as if they had just stepped off those streets.


Legally Defenseless
LEAD: A Federal judge in Manhattan last week indefinitely postponed the tax evasion trial of Harry B. Helmsley, ruling that Mr.
Helmsley's deteriorating mental condition had left him legally defenseless.
Judge John M. Walker Jr. said that the reports of several doctors, one of them court-appointed, showed that the 80-year-old real estate and hotel tycoon had suffered ''substantial brain damage'' from a series of small strokes and was unable to contribute to his defense.

Kashmir's Heritage: Art of Papier-Mache
LEAD: IN India, where the traveler on a shopping expedition can wallow in brass and silver and gold, brilliant silks and bold cotton hand looms, embroideries, appliques, fine leather, pottery and wood, some people never get around to the exquisite papier-mache boxes of Kashmir.
That's a pity.
Kashmiri papier-mache work - not only in boxes, but also in bowls, trays, lamp bases and other objects - reflects in its finely drawn and gilded decoration the Persian heritage of this Muslim frontier of India.


Alvar Aalto
LEAD: To the Editor: Any article on the great Finnish architect Alvar Aalto is always welcome since there is little written about him in this country.

A Feast of Tofu In Tokyo and Kyoto
LEAD: THE tofu restaurant Sasanoyuki is justly proud of its 300-year history in the same location in northeastern Tokyo.

As the story is told, he compared the restaurant's soybean curd to ''snow on bamboo leaves'' (in Japanese, sasanoyuki).


For Bonn and Moscow, Affinity and Suspicion
LEAD: IF the public opinion polls are right, Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be met by a nation more taken by him than even his own when he arrives here this week on his first official visit to West Germany.

Gorbachev has not rushed to visit Bonn, which trails far behind other important


DID THE PENALTY FIT THE CRIME?
LEAD: During the 1970's, I was a student at McGill University and an occasional research assistant to Ronald Melzack.
Never was there the slightest indication that Dr.
Melzack's contributions to pain research were falsely attributed to Dr.
Frazier or that Frazier was recognized for research on pain.
Although words, even paragraphs, were used without attribution, ideas were not stolen.


RED-HOT PASTORALE

Thanks to Trevino, This Is One Tough Course
LEAD: THERE is a common trait that runs through the egos of club members who feel theirs is the best course imaginable.
They cannot stand it when a superb golfer comes along and shoots a record score on their hallowed links.
So they solve the problem by change.
Those changes are not always for the better, though they may serve the purpose of making the course tougher.


Ojeda's 6-Hitter Sets Back Pirates
LEAD: After losing three straight games in the last inning, the Mets finally got their act together today.
And in one of their rarer performances of a mystifying season, they combined pitching with hitting on the same day in the same stadium, scored five runs inside two innings, coasted behind the six-hit pitching of Bob Ojeda and subdued the Pittsburgh

Reviews/Music; Two of Motown's Finest Update Their Own Sound
LEAD: As hip-hop music overtakes gospel-oriented pop as the dominant mode of commercial black music, the generation of pop and soul songwriters and performers who grew up with Motown face a quandary.
Short of totally revamping their style, how are they to continue to keep the faith of the past and still make music that sounds fresh and up-to-date?

Review/Television; Remembering Anne Frank, Holocaust's Witness
LEAD: As an expression of monumental evil, the Holocaust is so incomprehensible and repugnant that its full impact can perhaps be absorbed only in isolated images and symbols.
No matter how earnest, most ambitious dramatizations of Hitler's Germany tend to trivialize not only issues but experiences.
Yet a diary kept by a 14-year-old girl hiding in an Amsterdam attic managed to capture the essence of the monstrousness.

Publishing; A Secret of Many Successes: The Independent Bookstore
LEAD: ''THE Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat'' has the kind of title that often does well in bookstore chains, but the chains balked at buying a book about strange neurological disabilities. ''The Joy Luck Club'' is well written, but like most first novels the chains considered it too risky to order many copies.


Coyly, the Court Turns 180 Degrees
LEAD: With alarming disrespect for law and its own precedents, the Supreme Court has overturned one of the most significant rulings of the Court.
Not of that activist, liberal Warren Court, but the Court that was headed by Richard Nixon's Chief Justice, Warren Burger.
The new 5-to-4 majority, coyly pretending it was doing no such thing, has scrapped a 1971 ruling delivered by the former Chief Justice for a unanimous

Custody Battle in Utah's Top Court Shines Rare Spotlight on Polygamy
LEAD: The main route into this thumbnail-size town is barely marked - just a tiny street sign on a red dirt road, easy to miss without detailed directions.

The people of Hildale would rather not be found.


Review/Opera; 'Gotterdammerung,' Wagner's Big Booby Trap
LEAD: The whole of Wagner's ''Ring des Nibelungen'' is strewn with land mines for directors and performers, but the finale of the cycle, ''Gotterdammerung,'' is one great booby trap.
It was not a total surprise, therefore, that the Deutsche Oper Berlin's performance at the Kennedy Center Opera House on Saturday evening blew itself to bits, not entirely owing to technological missteps.

LEAD: The bloodstains are scarcely visible on the pavement now, the once ubiquitous posters calling for greater freedom are now only tattered shreds, and no one dares protest as the prisons open up for those who sought change.


'Call Waiting,' on Hold
LEAD: For some people, ''call waiting'' phone service is a godsend.
When they are talking, it signals that someone else is calling; the listener can put call A on hold while checking out call B. It's cheaper than two phones or hiring a secretary, and it's a real help in emergencies.
But the person on call

Except for annuals, how long houseplants live depends entirely on care and growing conditions.

Topics of The Times; Whose Morals? What Majority?
LEAD: According to its detractors, the Moral Majority, which will close its doors this summer, was neither moral nor a majority.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Videos With a Record Connection . . .
LEAD: In the battle for shelf space in video outlets, bigger - big films from big companies - is better, so it's unusual to see some high ground seized by a smaller distributor with some decidedly rarefied titles.

FICTION
LEAD:  RED ARMY.
By Ralph Peters. (Pocket Books, $18.95.) In his second novel, Ralph Peters, a United States Army intelligence officer, has concocted a might-yet-be tale of conventional war on the terrain where, according to the conventional wisdom, the Western allies would logically expect to meet the forces of the Eastern bloc - namely, the same German plains that have seen other invaders, from the Goths of the late Roman Empire to the Soviet troops of World War II.

Though it is virtually on the border and has shifted back and forth between the two countries 13 times, it has been part of England (its northernmost town) since 1482.
Berwick is indeed worth visiting, if only for the sight of those three long, magnificent, history-spanning bridges.


Review/Opera; Purcell's 'King Arthur' In St. Louis Production
LEAD: It is no news by now that the Opera Theater of St.
Louis counts as one of this country's most innovative companies.

LEAD: There is a time just after the onset of maturity when one must balance the wildness of youth with the growing responsibilities of age.

WHO'S TO JUDGE?
LEAD: I respect and welcome second opinions of diagnoses.

Violence In a Man's World
LEAD: WE WERE TALKING, my old classmate and I, about the case of Lisa Bianco.

Chinese and Jewish Intermarriage
LEAD: I am of Chinese descent and my husband is a nice Jewish boy from Rockaway Park.

Certainly the Chinese race and its heritage have been around just as long if not longer than the Jews.

LEAD: When the Polish Government declared martial law in 1981, and then outlawed Solidarity, the United States reacted decisively.

Husband and Wife Take Hurdles Titles
LEAD: Their devastating defeat in the Olympic Trials last year seemed a bit farther away today for David Patrick and Sandra Farmer-Patrick.

Not Much Light At the End Of This Tunnel
LEAD: Nothing weakens a story more than the storyteller's effort to explain characters who should be explaining themselves.
The writer's rule is: show the villain acting villainously or the wit being witty; don't hang descriptive tags around their necks and expect the reader to believe in their reality.


COOL COMFORT
LEAD: As temperatures climb in the summer, my enthusiasm for complicated cooking wanes.
Although I still like substantial, robust-flavored foods, the slowly braised and roasted dishes that are nurturing in winter are too heavy and complicated in the heat.
Fixed mealtimes also seem antithetical to summer, when outdoor activities have a greater tug.

1986 AMNESTY LAW IS SEEN AS FAILING TO SLOW ALIEN TIDE
LEAD: The most sweeping effort to halt illegal immigration in American history, the 1986 overhaul of immigration law, may have cut the flow of illegal aliens less than expected and may have actually encouraged unlawful entry in several ways.


The Great Houses of North Wales
LEAD: IN 1283, after King Edward I conquered the remote regions of Snowdonia in North Wales, thus terminating the rule of Welsh princes, his military architects built a string of majestic castles to fortify his gains.

Reviews/Dance; A Work On AIDS By Lamhut

WHAT'S DOING IN: Rome
LEAD: Getting lost is a good way to discover Rome.
Just take the wrong turn or simply follow your instincts through the city's labyrinth in the centro storico and the surprises soon follow.
A piazza too small to appear on a map, a fountain more beautiful than famous, a cluster of nuns under colorful parasols, a shuttered palazzo decorated with the morning's washing, young boys playing soccer against a 10th-century wall and myriad other moments that prove

The Two Fathers I Have Known
LEAD: BY the time I was 35, I had buried two fathers.
One I feared.
The other, I loved from a distance.
The one I feared - the one whose genes I carry - was an alcoholic.
I don't ever remember feeling close to him even when I was close to him.
His life was a war, and whenever I was with him, I was involved in a skirmish.


Kite Charges to a 1-Stroke Lead in Open

Hot Tip

TALKING: Modulars; The Pluses Outweigh The Pitfalls
LEAD: EVEN though modular homes are becoming increasingly commonplace, they can still generate the kind of apprehension that comes from unfamiliarity.


Question Of the Week; What's Wrong With The Mets?
LEAD: The Mets' downhill slide began to gather momentum when Davey Johnson's MasterCard commercial hit the airwaves.
His harebrained claim, ''Sometimes I wish I could use this card just to buy me a run,'' is insufferably ironic.
Of course, if he can figure out how to breathe some life into this notion, instead of doing an endorsement next season, he can deliver a testimonial.

LEAD: At the Hargrave Vineyard here, Abigail Bakker is packaging newly bottled wine.

LEAD: WITH THE OPENING OF THE SUMMER jazz festival season, the annual chorus of lamentations begins.

There's a Word For Yank Illness
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Wrought in Glass, Variations on a Presidential Theme
LEAD: Eagles embellish the rims of footed glass compotes.
They ornament the bodies of decanters.
They decorate vases, tumblers, sugar bowls and water bottles.
They stand poised above wind-whipped banners bearing the nation's motto, ''E Pluribus Unum.'' They grace the clear, frosted and tinted - red, green and blue - glass vessels, enriched with cutting, engraving and swirls of gilding.


Sports of The Times; The Soccer Fan With Two Teams
LEAD: There are many advantages to America being a nation of immigrants, but they do not always translate into a home-team advantage for the national soccer team.

Correction

Cox said.


FOOD SAMPLING SOIREES DRAW CROWDS AND SPUR SALES
LEAD: Sampling is being used by manufacturers with greater frequency these days to get products into the hands of shoppers and to stimulate the demand necessary to justify a spot on a grocer's shelf.
Last year, ShopRite alone held 400 to 500 demonstrations a week at its 175 stores, up 50 percent from the previous year, according to the New


Drafting an Epilogue to Anne Frank's Diary
LEAD: Most editions of the diary of Anne Frank end with her last entry of Aug. 1, 1944, about trying to keep her temper in the crowded hiding place.
There is often a stark note: Anne Frank and her family were arrested by the Gestapo on Aug. 4, 1944; she died at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in March 1945.


On the Record With a Witness To Sales Tricks
LEAD: In their publicly professed view of audio retailing, most equipment manufacturers resemble those Chinese monkeys who see, hear and speak no evil.
They don't want anyone to get mad at them.


Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''It is increasingly obvious that most of the reasons for illegal immigration are in the countries people are leaving, and that unless those conditions change we may be able to reduce the flow somewhat, but no enforcement scheme will stop the tide.''  - Representative
Bruce A. Morrison,
Democrat of Connecticut.


Cyclists Vying for Title

Factories are laying off their employees, and industrial production has virtually stopped.


LIFE STYLE: Sunday Menu; Warm Fresh Scallops With Sauteed Onions
LEAD: Scallops and onions make a delightful warm-weather treat.
You don't need Vidalia, Maui or other sweet onions if you have the patience to cook ordinary red onions very slowly with a bit of sugar.
Combine them with scallops, which are naturally sweet, make a side dish of potatoes, add a salad or green vegetable and Sunday lunch or dinner is served.

LEAD: About 2,000 people rallied yesterday in support of a fugitive Irish Republican Army member who has been held in a Federal prison in New York without charge for six years.


The Night Tony Got The Best Of Oscar
LEAD: People, and perhaps their psychiatrists, are always talking about having mood swings.
There they are, happy as squirrels romping across the greensward, and zap! gray skies are all they can see.
Or vice versa.
I don't seem to work this way.
I tend to have mood lags, which are something like jet lags but take longer to shake.


6DIE IN CRASH OF MILITARY HELICOPTER ON CAPE CODE
LEAD: All six men aboard a National Guard helicopter were killed when it crashed in dense fog on Cape Cod early today, narrowly missing several houses.


Vallauris
LEAD: To the Editor: In her article on Vallauris (Travel, Feb. 22) Ruth Robinson has done a remarkable job sifting wheat from chaff.
Nowhere in my broad experience of travel have I seen more junk per square inch offered to unwary tourists.
One wonders what the French think of travelers - that they leave their taste at home?


A Verdi Soprano Treads Carefully In Career Moves
LEAD: ''I was pretty scared.
After all, he had been one of my heroes for a long time.'' The soprano Susan Dunn is recalling the first time she sang for Luciano Pavarotti, in the autumn of 1980. ''I suppose he heard potential, because he asked me to come and sing in his competition in the spring.
My feet didn't touch the ground for a week!


WHO'S TO JUDGE?
LEAD: I do not know whether Elizabeth Morgan is telling the truth when she says that her former husband sexually abused their daughter (''Who's to Judge?'' by Marianne Szegedy-Maszak, May 21).

POSTINGS: Showroom to Condos; 19 Montclair Duplexes
LEAD: A one-time Chevrolet auto dealership in the heart of Montclair, N.J., has been transformed into 19 duplex condominium apartments through a development plan that has just been completed.

Catskills Housing
LEAD: To the Editor:


A HOMEGROWN VIEW
LEAD: Decorators frequently talk about the ''bones'' of a room - the architectural framework around which they can create a suitable environment.
Gardens have ''bones,'' too.
Indeed, the walls, trees, borders and pergolas that outline a property are as important to a landscape as beautiful proportions are to an interior.

A flamboyant fellow with a bottomless appetite for publicity, Jakubowski courted the press, telling reporters far and wide that Adirondack real estate was the last nickel bargain in America and that he intended to buy up the whole goshdarn park, all six million acres of it.

By Marc Galanter.  230 pp.
New York:  Oxford University Press. $22.95.


Bowing Out
LEAD: One reason it is so easy for so many to call Kareem Abdul-Jabbar the best ever is that he does not do it himself.
Not that it is a matter of opinion.
The numbers, the National Basketball Association records - 40 of them, from most points scored to most years played - speak for themselves.
Before that he set records in high school in New York City and at the University of California at Los Angeles.


Prices Of Gasoline Steady
LEAD: GASOLINE prices have leveled and should remain stable through the Fourth of July, an official in the state budget office said last week.

Moscow's Afghan Mess, Part Two
LEAD: FEW men have worked harder for an end to the war in Afghanistan in recent months than Yuli M. Vorontsov, the Soviet Ambassador to Kabul, who has shuttled among Pakistan, Iran, China and other points in a bid to create interest in the Soviet Union's plan for peace.
So it was no surprise when Mr.
Vorontsov ended a lengthy absence last week and flew to Kabul from Moscow, still less surprising that he drove almost immediately to the old Arg-i-Shahi Palace for talks with the Afghan Government leader, President


KING BHUMIBOL'S REIGN
LEAD: In 1953, William J. (Wild Bill) Donovan was named Ambassador to Thailand by President Dwight D. Eisenhower (''King Bhumibol's Reign,'' by Barbara Crossette, May 21).

Language
LEAD: To the Editor: Thirty years ago a schoolmate and I burst upon Europe with four years' of impeccable French (and about a dozen words of German).
But language was no problem; sign language, face language and sometimes the intervention of a passing bi- or tri-linguist was all we needed.

And what an absolute joy it is, in reading Bartholomew Gill's novel THE DEATH OF A JOYCE SCHOLAR (Morrow, $18.95), to watch the meditative chief superintendent of Dublin's murder squad (''the sempiternal Dub','' his wife calls him) discover his kinship with Leopold Bloom while hunting down the killer of a Joycean scholar who fancied himself a latter-day Stephen Dedalus.


WHO'S TO JUDGE?
LEAD: Hilary's case is indeed complex, but one thing is clear: there exists reasonable suspicion of her having been sexually abused by her father.
To require unsupervised visitation in light of such suspicion is nothing less than a perversion of power and judgment, particularly when a less-detrimental alternative, in the form of supervised visits, may be taken.

This year 14 buildings got the institute's official pat on the back, one less than last year and substantially fewer than the 20 in 1987.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I recently built an extension onto my house, the exterior of which is covered with tongue-and-groove cedar siding.
For the last two years, the siding has been treated with wood preservative, which has darkened the cedar.

They behave similarly when a good American


Graduation Unceremonies
LEAD: We went to graduation early to get good seats.
Even so, we won't see the big moment until tomorrow.
That's when the photos come back.
A few of us saw the diploma change hands, in miniature, through our viewfinders.
The rest of us missed it entirely.
Our view was blocked by people crowding in front of the rostrum, standing on chairs, squinting through their own viewfinders at what used to be, and could be again, a ceremony.

It seems to be standing in a gulley.

Forgotten Soldiers: A Footnote
LEAD: The article by Joseph G. Bilby, ''A Salute to Forgotten Soldiers'' (Opinion page, May 28), is yet another indication of how significant people never make it to the history books.

U.S. Beats Guatemala to Become No. 2
LEAD: There are more glamorous places to play soccer, but perhaps none as important to the United States as this small southern New England town, one of the stops on the road to Italy next year.

The Television Politicians Rise In Congress, Too

BASEBALL: Chasing Records, Game by Game; Maris's Mark Remains Elusive
LEAD: When Kevin Mitchell hit his 23d home run for the San Francisco Giants nine days ago, he prompted a rush to everyone's baseball reference shelf.
There, in the Elias record book, on page 382, instant researchers found that Mitchell was one game ahead of Roger Maris's 61-home run pace in 1961.


Reversing the Reservoirs
LEAD: If there's anything good to be said about day after day of June rain, it's that the reservoirs, those famous drought-stricken reservoirs, are within spitting distance of 101 percent capacity.
If they get to that point, the overflow will go into spillways, then streams and eventually into the Hudson and Delaware Rivers.


Lunch on the Connecticut River
LEAD: THERE is so much wringing of hands each summer over where to eat at the water's edge that perhaps a new solution is called for: eat on the water instead, on a cruise boat that serves lunch and dinner.

WHO'S TO JUDGE?
LEAD: A false accusation of parental sexual abuse can do as much damage to a family as sexual abuse itself.
Therefore, an accusation of this type must be treated, in the absence of clear evidence to support it, with considerable skepticism.
A parent in a custody battle cannot be allowed to undermine a court order merely by bringing unsubstantiated charges.


The Old West Preserved on Canvas
LEAD: BRAVADO and eccentricity have long been the stuff of American legends, and the cowboy artist Charles M. Russell, who captured the Old West at a peak moment, was no exception.

LEAD: The trade deficit shrank to $8.26 billion in April, the second monthly decrease in a row.

Who Wants to Be Comptroller? People With Plans
LEAD: CHANGES proposed in the New York City Charter may trim the powers of the city comptroller, but that prospect has not trimmed the office's appeal for politicians.

Now I work from home most days, including weekends, and this inevitably has an effect on family life.


Question Of the Week; What's Wrong With The Mets?
LEAD: This year Met fans have been victimized by dull, lethargic, lackluster baseball since spring training.
In comparison, the 1986 Mets had a never-say-die attitude that led them to numerous comeback victories.
In 1989, it seems like no lead is safe for very long.


Selecting a Bouquet for Profit
LEAD: Investing in wine used to be a matter of pleasure first, profit second.

Tantalizing Idea in a Triple Bill

The Eyes and the Color of Life
LEAD: ''OH, I knew something was terribly wrong,'' I murmured to the ophthalmalogist who had just told me that I had a cataract in the left eye.

Spirits in St. Louis Are High - And Rightly So
LEAD: In a major museum, there should be no dead ground, no rooms overdue for renovation and no flaky housekeeping.

Marking the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, the concert will be lighted by candles after twilight.

LEAD: In his first interview since being forced into hiding by death threats, the British author Salman Rushdie has described the Islamic revolution in Iran as a force for evil that has eaten its own children.


Copeland vs. Tyson
LEAD: According to one witness, the blow was really a little push, no more forceful than a hearty slap on the back.
But that's not the way John Copeland says he felt it last year when he and Mike Tyson had a little set-to outside a bar in Hudson, N.Y.


Campaign Filings Find Need For New Sources of Funds
LEAD: The first filings under New York City's campaign-finance law have revealed a new political landscape in which most candidates will have to devote considerable energy - and money - to finding new sources of funds rather than relying on large contributions from real-estate developers, lawyers, bankers and business people.


Kngghts of the Range
LEAD: THERE are many would-be inheritors of the knight-errant mantle.
A lot of fictional private eyes think they are modern-day Lancelots.
Some motorcycle cops, wearing their visored helmets and riding steel horses, believe they are latter-day knights.
But perhaps the group with the best claim on the title are the cowboys, the knights of the range.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  THE POWER GAME: How Washington Works, by Hedrick Smith. (Ballantine, $5.95.)

Federal Computers And Right to Know
LEAD: The Government's shift to storing information in computers instead of on paper is causing a growing number of legal scholars to say the public faces new obstacles when seeking access to Federal documents.

Better-Paid Teachers Head Back to School

Week's Scorecard: Raindrops 4, Mets 1

Like the Al Capp character who went through life under a perpetual cloudburst, Johnson and his Mets just couldn't seem to elude the rain no matter where they tried to hide.


Spielberg's Elixir Shows Signs Of Mature Magic
LEAD: It is one of the anomalies of this liberated era, when virtually nothing is taboo on screen, that the best of our mass-market movies are now children's films, at least those children's film that, as a kind of bonus, can also be enjoyed by adults. ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' was last year's exemplar.

Review/Piano; Pavlina Dokovska Recital
LEAD: Pavlina Dokovska, a Rumanian pianist who has studied in France and New York, played Schumann and Chopin at Merkin Hall on Thursday night.
Her solid skills and basic musicality might have held more interest - and, indeed, served music better -had the program been more imaginative.
Miss Dokovska, on the other hand, chose almost everywhere to explore repertory long since mined to exhaustion - the Chopin B-flat-minor Sonata and G-minor

In the Time Deal, the Public Is the Loser
LEAD: Europe's Thirty Years' War in the 17th century was a clash of empires and religions: allies in one battle became enemies in another.

PERSPECTIVES: Conversions in Harlem; Buyers Struggle to Qualify for Mortgages
LEAD: IF he could do it over again, said Robert Ezrapour, he would change the apartment mix to more larger units and fewer smaller ones.

A BAGFURL OF ELECTRONICS - CARS AND SHELVES THAT TALK

Kander-Ebb Musicals Revisited
LEAD: WHEN one could count on a modicum of new musicals a season, the scores and the shows of John Kander and Fred Ebb were often underrated.
Such modest musicals as ''Flora, the Red Menace'' (1965, three months), ''The Happy Time'' (1966, nine months) and ''70, Girls, 70'' (1971, four weeks) had more than a fair share of melodic moments, fondly remembered.


; Devils Add Poddubny in One of 3 Trades
LEAD: The Devils, who floundered last season after coming within a game of the Stanley Cup finals in 1988, made three trades today as the National Hockey League held its draft.

Philadelphia
LEAD: To the Editor: Although I am not a Philadelphian, I feel impelled to say that ''What's Doing in Philadelphia'' (Travel, April 2) omitted both in the content of the article as well as the map, the famous Rodin Museum.

Flawed but Powerful, Like Its Subject
LEAD: BIRD (1988, Warner Home Video, $89.95), Clint Eastwood's film about the life and times of the saxophonist Charlie Parker, may be long, messy and a bit drab-looking, but it is still one of the two or three most powerful jazz-oriented features ever produced.

Housing Chief's Fund Favored New York
LEAD: Almost a third, or $12 million, of the nearly $38 million in a discretionary fund at the disposal of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development went to projects in New York State between 1981 and 1988.
And all but a small fraction of that went to causes championed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York.


A Highway of the Future Whose Time Has Passed
LEAD: Burrowing through an island and floating across a lake, the stretch of Interstate highway that opened here this month was supposed to be the road of the future.
But after 30 years of planning and construction, it is instead seen by some critics as nothing but a historical oddity.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I recently built an extension onto my house, the exterior of which is covered with tongue-and-groove cedar siding.
For the last two years, the siding has been treated with wood preservative, which has darkened the cedar.
How can I treat the new cedar to make it the same color as the old cedar?

Italy's Loreto Offers Vistas And a Legend
LEAD: WHEN an Atlantic storm was tossing Columbus's ships during his second voyage to the Americas in 1493 his frightened men invoked Our Lady of Loreto for succor.
As the storm raged a huge church was being built in Italy on a hill overlooking the Adriatic Sea.
The church was named for a nearby laurel grove, lauretum in


Unleashing the Dark Methods of the Cultural Revolution
LEAD: THE scene could have come straight from the Cultural Revolution: 26 workers who had participated in the democracy movement were forced onto a stage before a packed meeting hall, so the masses could jeer at them.
The workers' heads had been shaven, and some of them wore placards around their necks, giving their names and ''crimes.


The 300-Year-Long New York City Light Show
LEAD: NEW YORKERS, perhaps overzealous in pursuing the Lord's strictures about letting there be light, have been engaged for nearly 300 years in blotting out the dark interval known as night.
Ever since 1697, when the first public lighting ordinance was issued in the British colony requiring every seventh house to hang out a candle and a lantern pole on moonless nights, the goal has always been to shed more light on city streets, both to inhibit skulking crime and to offer esthetic inducements to the citizens for greater enjoyment of the thoroughfares during evening hours.


WHAT THEY'RE WEARING: BOWS
LEAD: It's not that a bow is new as a decorative touch.
But where they are putting them this season is riveting.
Many of the most attractive women on the New York social scene are showing up at gala events in dresses featuring bows on the backside.
These additions range in scale from minuscule to momentous, but in each case they add a certain je ne sais quoi to the costume.


Elizabeth Haase Weds a Teacher
LEAD: Elizabeth Katharine Haase, a magna cum laude graduate of Princeton University who has taught English for two years at Newark Academy, was married yesterday to Andrew Alfred Meyers, chairman of the English department at the Bergen School in Jersey City.

WHO'S TO JUDGE?
LEAD: Two years ago, a young Long Island woman went to jail for her involvement in the homicide of her father.
She said that he had sexually abused her for many years but that she feared no one would believe her if she accused him.
The judge in the case sentenced her to jail for her ''crime'' because he believed she should have sought help, presumably from the legal system, instead of taking matters into her own hands.

ARTFUL SURVIVOR
LEAD: In the late 1950's, one of my second-grade pupils in a small private school in Manhattan was Helen Frankenthaler's nephew Clifford.

FASHION: On the Street; Eye-Catching Wedding Finery
LEAD: At most weddings, there is at least one simple rule: the bride wears white.
That certainly was the color of choice for Caroline Rudd, above, when she married Nicolas Combemale at St.
James' Episcopal Church in Manhattan this month.
Her off-white, two-piece lace dress, a Pauline Trigere design, had a peplum bodice that gave it something close to the effect of a tailored suit.


At Williamstown, a Search for a Vision THEATER; At Williamstown, a Search for a Vision
LEAD: On an icy afternoon last January, several hundred of the country's best-known actors and directors gathered in the candle-lit darkness of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in New York.
They were assembled to honor the memory of the fiery Greek director Nikos Psacharopoulos, who had died unexpectedly a few weeks before.


'Flowers in the Dirt': Love on the Rocks
LEAD: Twenty years ago, as the Beatles were splintering behind the scenes, Alan Aldridge published ''The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics,'' a collection of fantasy drawings by a few dozen artists.
The book's end-piece was a Michael Leonard sketch showing the Fabs in their 50's, with receding hairlines and looking paunchy and rich, but too eccentric to be mistaken for businessmen.


In Unusual Spotlight, Orioles Beat the A's
LEAD: Phil Bradley drove in three runs with two doubles today as Baltimore beat Oakland, 4-2, in the first nationally televised game from Memorial Stadium in almost three years.


Disney's Shrunken Kids Have a Mission
LEAD: An absent-minded professor in a placid suburb invents an incredible shrinking machine that accidentally turns his own children and his next door neighbors into creatures one-quarter of an inch tall.

Question Of the Week; What's Wrong With The Mets?
LEAD: The Mets lost their chance to be the dominant team of the 80's when they eliminated Kevin Mitchell and Ray Knight from their roster.
The '89 Mets have all of the talent in the world but none of the spirit and inner strength characterized by these two players.
That kind of drive is what enables a half-crippled outfielder to hit a home run at the 11th hour of a World Series game or a 17-year-old tennis player, seeded 15th, to win a Grand Slam tournament.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: The 100 million or so television viewers who were watching last January when Tim Krumrie broke his leg in the Super Bowl should not be surprised that the Cincinnati Bengals' nose tackle will not be participating in next month's training-camp drills.
The team said he would concentrate on classroom work and was not expected to join the club until sometime during the season.


George Lansbury, a Research Analyst, Weds Marianna Morgan in Vermont
LEAD: Marianna Caroline Morgan and George Winthrop Lansbury were married yesterday at the Peru (Vt.) Congregational Church by the Rev.

The bride, a graduate of Connecticut College, and her husband, a graduate of Trinity College in Hartford, received master's degrees from the Harvard Divinity School.


Struggles of Would-Be Film Makers
LEAD: Hollywood studios often spend more than $20 million to produce a film these days.
But Gary Handel, a 29-year-old New York City cab driver, recently spent only $3,000 to produce a 10-minute film that has been broadcast nationally on cable television.
And Maxi Cohen, 30, of Manhattan, who until recently made ends meet working in the New York City morgue, was commissioned to produce a short comedy for ''Saturday Night Live'' on N


Rounding Up an American Tradition
LEAD: COME summer, cowboys and cowgirls hit the trail - the rodeo trail - and the fans are never far behind.
Winter is the slow season -a finals competition here, a livestock show there - but in summertime in the West rodeos are as ubiquitous, and as well-loved, as barbecues and county fairs.
Pro rodeo riders call the Fourth of July cowboy's Christmas, because, as David Brown of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association says, ''There are so many rodeos to go to they can make a good portion of their income that week.

Review/Film; Nicholson and Keaton Do Battle in 'Batman'
LEAD: ''Batman'' begins with a lot of promise: the camera pans across dark, lowering clouds as we hear music so doomy you might think it to be Mahler, though it's really Prince in a cosmic mode.

It's a production designer's coup de cinema, a nightmare version of megalopolis, an urban landscape without sun, seen through a smog of pollutants and despair.

DIALOGUE: Art and the Taxpayer's Money  Cocoran: Courage or Cowardice?; Don't Punish the Arts
LEAD: The decision of the Corcoran Gallery to cancel a retrospective of the works of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe has caused a firestorm.
The action was not based on a curator's objection to the material, which might have been a tiny bit more defensible (one photo showed a black man urinating into a white man's mouth.) It was a pre-emptive maneuver, amid growing Government intervention in the arts, to protect the museum's $292,000 in Federal funding from


DIALOGUE: Art and the Taxpayer's Money  Corcoran: Courage or Cowardice?; Say No To Trash
LEAD: In canceling the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition last week, Washington's Corcoran Gallery did more than refuse to show a few raunchy photographs of what the press, unable to print them, primly called ''explicit homoerotic and violent images.'' Because the exhibition was supported in part by public funds from the Congressionally embattled National Endowment for the Arts, the Corcoran doubtless considered financial self-interest in arriving at its decision.

Mr.
Bunch, who worked in the 1950's with big bands led by Benny Goodman and Woody Herman and who has also accompanied Tony Bennett, is an orchestral pianist on his own.

''There's Potential for Exploitation'
LEAD: OFFICE romances are not always the forbidden trysts that novels and movies make them out to be, according to Lisa A. Mainiero, who has written a book on the subject after four years of research.
Sometimes, she says, they are well-matched, healthy relationships.
But bad or good, ''almost everybody knows or has been involved in an office romance, and they're dying to talk about them,'' she said.


Scientists Differ on Spill, but They Contrast It With Alaska's
LEAD: Government scientists sampling the oil-polluted water around Narragansett Bay this morning differed on how serious the spill from the World Prodigy was likely to be.

Sweden's Tranquil Retreat

That Rare Breed: Both a Revolutionary And a Man of Peace
LEAD: ONE OF THE MOST REWARDING shows of the summer, and one that has an impact out of all proportion to its size, is ''The Intimate Eye of Edouard Vuillard'' at the Katonah Gallery in Katonah, N.Y.

LEAD: THE distinctive concrete-block screen, gone since 1987 from the 1956 Edward Durell Stone house at 130 East 64th Street, is beginning to fade from memory.
The picture windows, originally hidden by the grillwork, now have an expansive view of the street and admit much more light to the house.


Pronounced Differences

IF THE WALL CAME TUMBLING DOWN
LEAD: WHAT MAGNIFICENT dream could President Ronald Reagan have had before his eyes in the spring of 1987 when he exclaimed, to polite applause from West Berliners, ''Mr.

Or President Bush, when he followed his mentor by declaring in Mainz, West Germany, last month that ''the brutal wall .

The Hard Case of the Flag: Apologies and Surprises
LEAD: DISPLAYING some of the emotions that the Stars and Stripes inspires, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment: burning an American flag in a nonviolent political demonstration cannot be punished criminally because it is a form of expression protected by the First Amendment.
Justices on both sides of the 5-to-4 ruling last week wrote fervent opinions on the defilement of the symbol of freedom.


Natural Result Of 2 Bad Trades
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Injuries Don't Faze Reds but Rose Case May Be Taking a Toll
LEAD: AS a player, Pete Rose set so many major league and National League records he might hold the record for holding the most records.

The bride is a daughter of Stuart A. Kaplan of Huntington Station, L.I., and Mrs.
Michael L. Greenberg of Lawrence, L.I.


Aesthetic Goals At Exhibitions
LEAD: Helen Harrison seemed to like the exhibition  [ ''At Juried Show, Dominant Esthetic Is Abstract and Gestural,'' May 28 ] , because it had the esthetic cohesion of an invitational show.
While there is much to be said for a show with a cohesive and dominant esthetic, the Huntington Township Art League's annual juried exhibition was publicized as an open juried show and should, therefore, have reflected many styles and media.


Wimbledon: Noises In the Cathedral
LEAD: WIMBLEDON, which begins tomorrow, is one of the many mirrors held up, not so much to nature as to the changing ways of society.
What used to be a practically religious atmosphere has given way to a raucous cacophony of mingled high spirits and childishness.
The money lenders are well and truly established in the temple.


Keeping Hotels on Their Toes
LEAD: THE Sheraton Stamford Hotel and Towers, on a Monday afternoon, breathed the quiet of a slowly filling hotel.
A few people clustered at the front desk, a car or two slithered up outside.
The gift shop was deserted, and only a couple of stragglers were dining in the lobby restaurants.


Miss Kingsbury Is Wed on L.I.
LEAD: The marriage of Heather Snow Kingsbury, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
James M. Kingsbury of Brooklyn and Point O' Woods, L.I., to William Newton West, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

George A. Tollefson.
The Rev.
John S. Rogers, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony at St.


For Pop, Comedy May Be The Sincerest Form of Flattery
LEAD: TODAY'S POP MUSIC CUL-ture tends to take itself so seriously that almost any comic deflation of pop grandiosity and pretension is welcome.
What does it mean to grow up in a society where Elvis imitators inspire reverence rather than laughter, Bruce Springsteen's lyrics are accepted as oracles and changes in Michael Jackson's and Madonna's wardrobes and hair styles are read as maps to our cultural psyche?


WHY MOW?
LEAD: Michael Pollan has much to say about lawns, but he fails to mention Thorstein Veblen, whose social and economic theories included even lawns (''Why Mow?'' May 28).
What governs our passion for a scrupulously maintained lawn, according to Veblen, is not the need for beautification, social conformity nor civic responsibility.


Q and A
LEAD:  Transfer Tax on a Co-op


Youth on the Move in Tennis
LEAD: EVERY tennis generation has produced child stars, resolute girls in pigtails, steely-eyed boys who have not yet begun shaving.
In the open era, for instance, Chris Evert was 19 when she won Wimbledon and the United States Open; Tracy Austin was the youngest female winner of the Open at 17; Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander were still teen-agers when they won the French Open for the first time, and John McEnroe was 18 when he reached the semifinals at

Corrections
LEAD: An article last week about supermarket promotion incorrectly characterized a test of the Videocart advertising program being conducted by Information Resources Inc.

Sanding Floors: Prepare With Care
LEAD: SANDING a wood floor before refinishing is not too difficult, but it is a dusty, noisy and time-consuming job.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: The British queue up and the Americans wait in line, except for New Yorkers, who idiomatically wait on line.
New Yorkers wait in/on so many lines that some have taken to hiring other New Yorkers to wait for them.


Sorrel's Popularity Is on the Upswing
LEAD: SORREL has had an uneven reputation in America.
Its swings in popularity have probably been due to the fact that it is sour (it is also known as sour grass) and Americans like sweet things.
But in France it has always been loved and now Americans are rediscovering its virtues.
It is used with eggs, fish like shad, mackerel and salmon and as a sauce for veal, lamb or chicken.


CAMPUS LIFE: Montana State; When 'Finals' Means Rodeo And U.S. Titles
LEAD: Ty Murray has already won tens of thousands of dollars on the professional rodeo circuit this year.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  JAMES BALDWIN: Artist on Fire.
By W. J. Weatherby. (Fine, $19.95.) For nearly two decades, beginning in the 1950's, James Baldwin was one of America's leading writers.
An accomplished novelist and relentless traveler, he was best known for works of essay-reportage - such as ''The Fire Next Time,'' first published in 1962 in The New Yorker - that explored black sensibilities in the civil rights movement, with a strong commitment to interracial harmony.

'Twas Method, Yet There Was Madness in It
LEAD: ''PEOPLE ARE APT TO GETJU weepy when they talk about the opening night of 'Waiting for Lefty,' '' Robert Lewis says, recalling the many memorials to the Group Theater he has attended.
As a member of the Group, Mr.
Lewis was onstage on Jan. 5, 1935, in New York, when Clifford Odets's play about a union meeting of taxi drivers inspired the audience to leap to its feet and roar ''Strike!

We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


The Future Has Arrived For Bioethics, and It's a Profession Now
LEAD: ONCE a novel and somewhat suspect effort to examine the ethical problems arising from advances in biology and medicine, bioethics no longer carries a faint tinge of science fiction.
It is now a well-established field with scholarly journals, endowed professorships and government commissions.
Leading figures in bioethics have even begun to ask whether the field has become too well established.


Seeing Through The Crisis Makers
LEAD: Philip Pilevsky complains that we have pushed a whole host of issues aside.
He goes on to decry local communities' Not In My Backyard Syndrome.
They don't want to hear about solutions to household garbage, jail overcrowding and medical waste, and become extremely susceptible to crisis makers who create a crisis where none exists.


Nathan Zucker, 74, Film Producer, Dies
LEAD: Nathan Zucker, an independent film producer, died Friday of kidney failure at Princeton (N.J.) Medical Center.
He was 74 years old and lived in Cranbury, N.J.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  Festival Finale


'Realism' In an Art Show
LEAD: Rather than criticizing the work of the North Shore Watercolor Society or comparing it to the other work in the art show now at Gallery North in Setauket, perhaps it would have been more appropriate for Helen Harrison  [ ''Mind's Eye as Creator,'' June 4 ]  to question its being there in the first place.


MAKING COUNTRY MUSIC HOT AGAIN
LEAD: WHEN THE CLEAN-CUT young man with dark brown eyes, brown hair swept off a high forehead and a prominent square jaw strides through the stage door of the Grand Ole Opry, barely a head turns.
The musicians wandering the polished hallways recognize Randy Travis.
He is, after all, perhaps the most sought-after young country singer in the world today.


At Longwood Gallery, 20 ArtistsTraverse Culture and Literacy
LEAD: THE current Longwood Arts Gallery production, an exhibition about literacy, could have used a spot more literacy itself.
Its news release says, among other things, that ''the act of reading is either repressed or encouraged in subtle and not so subtle ways throughout our social fabric.''


Purse May Rise For Super Derby
LEAD: The Super Derby purse will be doubled to $2 million if Sunday Silence and Easy Goer enter the Sept. 24 race, the Louisiana Downs owner, Edward J. DeBartolo, said Friday.


Ad Executives Leave It All Behind
LEAD: FROM a muddy hillside in Union, by seven burnings kilns, Matthew J. McNerney and Mark E. Greene earn their livelihood.
They make charcoal, the kind that people use for backyard cookouts and industries use as filters.


List Shows Link of U.S. Weapons To Banned Semiautomatic Imports
LEAD: Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has told a House subcommittee that 17 makes of domestically produced semiautomatic assault weapons have the same characteristics as weapons subject to a temporary ban imposed earlier this year on imported semiautomatics.

In Jungle at Thai-Burmese Border, Last Stand for Student Protesters
LEAD: Hailed as fighters for democracy last September when they fled the Burmese military crackdown to train with insurgents along the borders, the students who remain in this unforgiving jungle near the Thai border have too little to eat and not enough medicine to treat the endemic malaria.

Ideals Aside, Ethics Are Practical
LEAD: ELABORATE ethical systems that include abstract concepts and specific codes are not helpful to practical managers.
These days, even the word ethics can be confusing.
Some say management ethics can be summed up in phrases like ''don't steal,'' while others argue that ethics are part of a larger social agenda for a business or company.


A Seaside Town's Country Airs
LEAD: THERE are two Swedens.
There is the Sweden that conjures visions of a meticulously organized but joyless society of blond-haired, blue-eyed conformists.
Swedish design, for example, is often seen as elegant, intelligent, functional - yet soulless.
And Swedish cities are often viewed as triumphs of social as well as civil engineering, but lacking the addictive taste of hustle, the tantalizing smell of opportunity, that New York, say, or Paris provide.

Visas
LEAD: To the Editor: Though the answer to the question about getting a visa for Hungary (Q &amp; A, May 14) was correct, it was not complete.

A Band That Gave An Age of Excess A Good Name
LEAD: THE FILLMORE EAST, A DILAPIdated old vaudeville theater on New York's Lower East Side, was host to more than its share of unforgettable rock-and-roll shows during its heyday in the late 60's and early 70's.
The promoter, Bill Graham, usually herded soon-to-be-legendary bands on and off the stage with an almost military punctuality, but when the Allman Brothers Band was performing, even Mr.

Phoenix Prepares Its Second Season
LEAD: ''PEOPLE said, 'You'll never do it.' Having done it, I then heard, 'That's it; you'll never do it again.' '' Such was the negativism that Bram Lewis recalls confronting as he established the new Phoenix Theater Company in Dobbs Ferry last summer.
Now Mr.
Lewis is trying to do it again.


LIFE STYLE: Sunday Outing; Woodstock: A Colorful Past, a Lively Present
LEAD: This village, nestled on the edge of the Catskills, is a place with a past, but it lives very much in the present.
The rock festival that made its name famous around the world in August 1969 was actually held in Bethel, some 50 miles away, but no matter.
Stores in Woodstock are selling as many T-shirts that say only ''Remember Woodstock: Three Days of Love, Peace and Music'' as those that point out that Bethel was where it was.

Well, Mr.
Baldinger has another profession that takes a great deal of his time.


FASHION: Leading Questions; Buttoned Up, Or a Little Bare?

Grasping an Idea, the Long Way and the Short

'Guilty' Is on Jury Blackboard
LEAD: Jurors considering murder charges against a United States marine say they can still reach a fair verdict after they entered the deliberation room Friday morning and found the word ''guilty'' scrawled on a blackboard.
The word was accidentally left behind by a prosecutor on Thursday.

LEAD: MARVIN SLOVES says he knows ''all about these guys,'' but his colleagues on Madison Avenue think he's got his work cut out for him.


Take Japan Seriously in Aerospace
LEAD: THE aerospace industry plays a central role in Japan's strategic vision of its future.
The Japanese are seeking technology leadership rather than cost advantage and will emerge as a dominant force in certain segments of the market much faster than is generally expected.
American aerospace companies must avoid the ''it will never happen here'' attitude that contributed to the downfall of the steel, consumer electronics, automobile, shipbuilding and semiconductor industries.


Workers Want Protection From the Promises of 1992
LEAD: WHILE businessmen have high hopes that the European Community's plan to remove internal trade barriers by the end of 1992 will allow their companies to become more efficient and profitable, labor unions fear that 1992 could mean huge layoffs and other setbacks.
Volkswagen workers in West Germany, for example, worry that they might lose jobs as the end to customs posts and other obstacles makes it easier for their employer to move production to its factories in low-wage

Reviews/Dance; Four Offerings by Harlem Troupe
LEAD: The second program in Dance Theater of Harlem's season, which ends next Sunday, is a decidedly mixed bill.


SLIPPER CHAIRS
LEAD: The very idea of a slipper chair stirs the imagination.
It conjures up a romantic setting of an 18th-century boudoir where a beautiful woman, wearing a skirt as layered and swagged as an elaborate curtain, sits on a small chair by the fire.
Kneeling at her feet is her maid, helping her put on a pair of silk slippers.


What Argentina Must Sacrifice to an Economy Gone Mad

LEAD: IN recent weeks, the two continuing dialogues in the Middle East - one a dialogue of words between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization and the other a dialogue of deeds between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs - have reached critical junctures.
The question is which one is more likely to shape the future of the Palestinian


SPIES &amp; THRILLERS
LEAD: The plot of A DENIABLE MAN by Sol Stein (McGraw-Hill, $18.95) can quickly be summarized.
It is a standard triangle.
A brilliant teacher of law becomes besotted with a very bright student and helps her become a fearsome trial lawyer.
The woman's father is a general in the United States Army.
He is killed in Rome by terrorists.


FASHION: On the Street; To Take On An Artful Look, Use Your Head
LEAD: Used to be, a diploma from the tonsorial academy was all one needed to practice barbering.
Now, it seems, a couple of semesters at art school would not hurt.
We are living in an age in which the term ''close back and sides'' has taken on a whole new meaning, and hair is more than just hair: it is a canvas, a hieroglyphic message center, a follicular billboard.


CAMPUS LIFE: University of California at Davis; School Struggles to Preserve Festival After Melee
LEAD: With five people hospitalized and six others arrested after a melee at a recent festival celebrating black culture, administrators at the University of California at Davis are wrestling with the problem of how to save the popular event that has served as an image-maker in the school's efforts to attract more minority students.

And its 13th-century story -''of someone,'' says Ms.


POSTINGS: 8-Home Complex; Field &amp; Stream
LEAD: There was some heavy skirmishing in the Westchester Town of Yorktown during the Revolutionary War, and French troops under General Rochambeau were encamped there at one point to support the Colonials in case an assault on New York City became necessary.
But General Washington, who slept in other nearby communities, never slept there.


Summer Theater Opens With Variety
LEAD: SUMMER STOCK is not what it used to be, but at least it is still here.

Dittman.


Should Ben Johnson Be Allowed to Run Again?
LEAD: We all make mistakes as we go through life.
We all, too, need to be forgiven for our mistakes.
The problem here rests in the fact that Mr.
Johnson, once he had commenced taking steroids, continued playing by his own rules FOR YEARS.
Then he tacitly lied to his followers, fans, family, by accepting the Olympic gold medal, and finally, with the opportunity at hand, still refused to be man enough, sportsman enough, to confess his faults.


The Rise of 'Civil Society'
LEAD: The crises of reform in Communist states have brought forth the concept of ''civil society.'' The phrase is heard more and more frequently.


Nassau Needs A New Deal
LEAD: WHILE it is true that the Nassau County District Attorney has not been able to find any indictable offenses as a result of his Mitchel Field investigation, unfortunately, it does in fact lead to one conclusion: the indictment of Nassau County government.


Should Ben Johnson Be Allowed to Run Again?
LEAD: Athletes who abuse cocaine, an illegal substance on and off the field, are rehabilitated and welcomed back to their sports after their problems become known.
But after abusing steroids, Ben Johnson may be banned from his sport for life.
Sure, steroids give athletes an unfair advantage, but the fact that they're not illegal across the board can confuse seemingly naive athletes like Johnson.


WHY MOW?
LEAD: It is indeed a futile struggle to contain nature.
I spent three hours mowing and trimming last weekend, but after three days of midweek rain, my yard looked ready to go to seed.
Yet, I managed to plod out to the barn and crank up the mower.
As a hay field, my yard might look pretty, but the insects, woodchucks and snakes that would stake their claim would make my family's life miserable.


Deadline Near on $500 Million New Jersey Gap
LEAD: With a week to go before the new fiscal year, no one in the New Jersey Legislature or Gov.

Made-for-Cable Movies: tempest in a Hot Tub
LEAD: COUPLES HEATEDLY UNDRESS-ing each other, couples panting in hot tubs, couples sweatily entwined - we are, friends, in the aggressively liberated territory of pay TV's made-for-cable movies.
And don't forget the foul language.

Historic Haven On an Ontario Isle
LEAD: For the rebels in 1776, an American who sided with George III was reviled in a popular saying as ''a thing whose head is in England, and its body in America, and whose neck ought to be stretched.''

An English Recording Tradition Continues to Be Observed
LEAD: BRITISH RECORD COMpanies, especially many of the smaller ones, take admirable pride in their native music; the pages of Gramophone magazine are always dotted with announcements of cycles of recordings of this or that British composer.
In this tradition, one of the largest record companies, London (called Decca in Britain), has issued a clutch of midpriced compact disks, remastered from analog recordings, and bearing the series title the British Collection.

A 'Goldberg' by Any Other Instrument . . .
LEAD: IF AN EARLY BACH BIOGRAPHER, Johann Forkel, is to be believed - and his tale has become an indestructible part of musical legend - Bach composed his ''Goldberg'' Variations on a theme of a young court harpsichordist, Johann Gottlieb Goldberg.
Goldberg was often asked to tinkle his keyboard discreetly in an adjacent room to help overcome the insomnia of Count Hermann Carl von Kaiserling, the Russian ambassador to the Saxon court.


Drug Companies Shouldn't Come First
LEAD: Karen S. Dougherty ends her moving essay, ''The Muddle in Eating 'Right' '': ''It is ironic that miracle drugs are used to fight cancers that could be caused by the other 'miracle' drugs we eat and breathe.''

Malpractice Rates Ease, But Many Are Skeptical
LEAD: With insurance rates expected to stabilize this year after more than a decade of increases, some analysts and government officials are cautiously declaring an end to New York's medical malpractice insurance crisis.

Sorrel's Popularity Is on the Upswing
LEAD: SORREL has had an uneven reputation in America.
Its swings in popularity have probably been due to the fact that it is sour (it is also known as sour grass) and Americans like sweet things.
But in France it has always been loved and now Americans are rediscovering its virtues.
It is used with eggs, fish like shad, mackerel and salmon and as a sauce for veal, lamb or chicken.


Elegant Chinese That Looks the Part
LEAD: CHINESE food lovers feel strongly about their favorite restaurants.
Ask any of them, and they will, without urging, recommend what is absolutely, positively Long Island's best Chinese restaurant.
