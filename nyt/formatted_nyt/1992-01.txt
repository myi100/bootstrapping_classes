With More to Recycle, a Village Closes Its Center
Back in 1971 after the first Earth Day, it was a sign of the environmentally conscious times when village fathers here decided to do their part for the planet by opening a recycling center.
Now, behind the village office building where people used to drop cans, bottles and other recyclables into big dumping bins, there is a newer sign of more complicated times.
It reads: "No Dumping."

Board Likely to Be Ousted At Maxwell Communication
The fight for control of the Maxwell Communication Corporation neared a resolution today, and it seemed that the company's directors would be the losers.
An examiner appointed by a United States court and administrators appointed by an British court agreed to oversee the company's affairs together.
The implication, which could not be confirmed today, was they had agreed to oust the company's board, including the chairman, Peter Laister, who only took office on Dec. 3.


Avoiding 'Caregiver Burnout' In Alzheimer Family Groups
For the last 13 years, Josephine Mazur and her twin sister, Mary, have alternated on a two-week cycle as primary caregivers of their 94-year-old mother, who has Alzheimer's disease.
They do everything for her, including cleaning, dressing and feeding her, and they sometimes feel their efforts are at the expense of their own lives.
"Nowadays when I talk to her there's no response," said Josephine Mazur.
"She's literally like a six-month-old baby."

Rangers Easily Beat Jets
Mark Messier and Adam Graves scored two goals each as the Rangers won the eighth game in their last 10 by beating the Winnipeg Jets, 5-2, here tonight.

"But it won't be a quick fix."


Cheating Scandal Jars a Suburb of High Achievers
In this affluent suburb on Chicago's North Shore, where large houses are set on richly landscaped lots and many residents are well-educated and highly paid professionals, it is not uncommon for parents to expect their children to score well above the national average on standardized tests.
So last year, when students in third grade at the Cherokee School received scores substantially above those of third-graders at the district's three other elementary schools, parents of students at those other schools wanted to know why.


Court Ends Suit Against Judge in 'Bonfires' Case
A Federal appeals court today dismissed Essex County's lawsuit against the Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court, who had banned the filming of a scene from "The Bonfire of the Vanities" inside a Newark courthouse.

There is no need, he asserts, to taste and sniff.


A Rising Argument That Teaching Values Should Rank With Lessons
Kevin Walsh, an education professor at the University of Alabama, says that what is wrong with America's schools is not that Johnny can't do math.
Johnny can do math.
And he can read and write.

When Johnny works through math problems, he often races to find a solution, seizing shortcuts and bypassing critical steps that prevent errors.

The Pop Life; Top 12's, or So
Given that the average buyer of recordings has access to a wider span of music, both chronologically and geographically, than at any other time in history, compiling Top 10 lists might seem like an exercise in inadequacy.
So they've been expanded slightly, to Top 12 (more or less) lists that include a few anthologies.
The intention is to acknowledge that much of the century's musical splendor is out there, waiting.
Whatever else these lists offer -- a reflection of cultural movement, the importance of the artists, or simply each critic's idea of pleasure -- they are meant to provide a path through the last year in popular music.

New Years
57-55-55-56-59.
As the old year clicked down on the world's clocks, he lay watching the bright orange numbers pulse across a computer monitor.
Now and then, when he sat up in the hospital bed, the numbers shot up too, triggering the flashing legend "Artifact," and then dropped back.
The throbbing numbers and the graph line measured out the heart beats of the old year.
Another new year, he thought, but how many more?

Ease Load on Courts, Rehnquist Urges
Describing the Federal court system as "a resource which is both precious and exhaustible," Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist today called on Congress to shift some categories of cases to the state courts and to refrain from expanding Federal criminal jurisdiction.
"The time has come to re-examine the role of the Federal courts," the Chief Justice declared in his year-end report on the Federal judiciary.
He said the writers of the Constitution intended the Federal judicial system to have only a "limited role reserved for issues where important national interests predominate."


King Fahd Pledges Changes in Saudi Government
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia announced on Monday night that laws permitting the creation of a consultative council and other political reforms would be introduced in February, the Saudi Information Minister, Ali al-Shaer, said in Riyadh.
The King communicated his decision to widen the scope of government in what is viewed as the first substantial reforms in the Saudi Government structure to his Cabinet ministers in a meeting Monday night.


It's Not His Census Anymore
When Robert Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce, refused last July to adjust the 1990 Census to correct for the miscount of three to five million Americans, he took a regrettable but defensible position.
But when the same Robert Mosbacher, since designated as chairman of the 1992 Bush re-election campaign, won't give Congress the correction data, that's raw politics.
Rejecting the adjustment was unfortunate because most professionals agreed that present statistical methods could make the population count more accurate and fair.
Barbara Everitt Bryant, the Census Director, told the Secretary that not adjusting amounted to "denying that these five million persons exist."


Rebels Ready to Storm Parliament in Georgia
Georgian rebels bolstered their strongholds with heavy artillery today and appeared determined to storm the Parliament building to oust President Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia, who has taken refuge inside with several hundred troops.
Mr.
Gamsakhurdia, accused of being a dictator by the opposition, says the rebels are criminals trying to seize power.
His most prominent political opponent, Georgi Chanturia, said that while he was confident of victory, neither side had the force to achieve quick military success.


Neither War Nor Economic Slump Could Stem the '91 Market Surge
A year ago, few on Wall Street predicted the yearlong bull market to come.
Stock prices had slumped amid the apprehension of a nation poised for war, and the economy was in recession's clutches.
But when war came in the Persian Gulf in mid-January, it gave stocks their first lift, with prices rising sharply in the six weeks of fighting.
And even though economic recovery remained as elusive as a desert mirage for the rest of the year, ever-lower interest rates gave stocks a magnetic ability to attract cash and hold on to it.  20% Gain for the Dow


Clocks Are Fugitive: Will Father Time Now Carry a Watch?
LAST night, anyone with a television set and the stamina to fight off sleep could watch 1991 count itself out of existence.
But other than those expiring nanoseconds, the passing of the year was hard to track, because clocks are fading from neighborhood walls, and time's component minutes and hours plop into oblivion unheralded.
Not to say there aren't fancy new clocks: for one, those micronumbers on the VCR, although the time is often wrong because of lapses in resetting the displays.
But those numbers with a blinking hiatal colon serve only the insomniac, giving unwanted news, namely that anxiety has consumed one-quarter of a night's sleep, and still counting.


Who's No. 1? Keep a Close Waych on Both Coasts Babn on a Husker Is a Distraction At Orange Bowl
Nebraska's Cornhuskers, who came here to play in the 58th Orange Bowl as overlooked guests because of anticipation of a Miami national-championship party, were suddenly thrust into the spotlight today when they determined that questions about a player's eligibility could cost them their conference title.
Late this afternoon, one day before the bowl game, Nebraska officials determined that the use of Omar Soto, a senior fullback, could eventually lead the Cornhuskers to forfeit as many as four of their nine victories this season and to give up the Big Eight Conference championship that placed them here.

BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY -- The Global Lab: Agriculture; U.S. Biotech Seeks Foreign Backers
In agricultural biotechnology, the contrast between the American style of creating new businesses and the approach in Europe and Japan is especially stark.
The difference has direct bearing on the way biotechnology companies tend to form their foreign alliances, with smaller American players teaming up with bigger overseas companies.
Although some big American corporations like Monsanto have invested heavily in biotechnology, many of the most intriguing developments in the United States have been reported by entrepreneurial start-up concerns like Mycogen, Ecogen, Calgene, Crop Genetics, Biotechnica and DNA Plant Technologies.

The winner of college football's mythical national championship won't be decided until later, when polls are taken and computers are fed the appropriate post-bowl game information, but the arguing is likely to start in the late hours of New Year's Day.
Back East, in the Orange Bowl against Nebraska, Miami (11-0) will have the most significant voice in determining the unofficial No. 1 team for this season, but out here, where the 78th Rose Bowl will be played Wednesday, it remains a distinct possibility that either Washington (11-0) or Michigan (10-1) could end up as the nation's top-ranked team.

Bank Fund, C.D. Yields Down Again
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit were down for the week that ended yesterday, as the effects of Federal Reserve's latest discount rate cut, and the prime rate cut by most commercial banks that soon followed, continued to affect savings returns.
The lowering of interest rates this year to help a faltering economy has also played havoc with savings.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest-rate publication, the highest yield on a money market account at the beginning of the year was 7.57 percent, and that was more than the best yield on a five-year certificate the previous week.


Marcor Resorts Sells Properties
Marcor Resorts Inc. said it had sold its commercial real estate operations and all its real estate holdings except the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for $25.8 million.

The transaction increased Marcor's shareholder equity by about $7 million, the company said.
The sale relieved the company of $19.4 million in debt owed to Marnell-controlled affiliates and $6.4 million owed to third parties.
The sale allows the company to focus all its attention on the Rio Hotel.

Hong Kong Comes to the U.S., Whole Fish, Noodles and All
IT is noon on the Bowery in Chinatown and there is not an empty seat at Noodletown, an unassuming restaurant that specializes in homemade noodles and wontons.
The air is thick with the singsong melody of spoken Cantonese as customers hunch over bowls of steaming noodles and plates of barbecued goose and salt-baked cuttlefish.
The scene could pass for any neighborhood restaurant in Hong Kong.
Not far away, at the more sedate Eastern Villa on Mott Street, a waiter dips a net into a tank of live fish, nabs one and takes it over, still squirming, to some customers for their examination.
He heads for the kitchen and reappears not long after with a platter holding the whole fish steamed with scallions and ginger root.
Other dishes include grilled skewered eel, steamed whole shrimp in the shell, fried young chicken with pickled vegetable, and stir-fried snow pea shoots with crab meat.


Gay Groups Call Police Decoys Ineffective

Commenting on "As You Like It," George Bernard Shaw said that "Rosalind is to the actress what Hamlet is to the actor." By that he meant that, given a performer's "reasonable presentability," failure is "hardly possible." In both instances, Shaw was probably being intentionally ingenuous.

Economic Scene; Zionist Dreams, Capitalist Reality
DO Israel's born-again capitalist policy makers truly, sincerely wish to live by the rules of free markets?
Conservative critics -- notably, Alvin Rabushka, an economist at the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies in Jerusalem -- contend big government is an addiction that Israel will not kick until it is threatened with the loss of American aid.
But Benjamin Gaon disagrees.
And as the chief executive of Koor Industries, his views cannot be lightly dismissed.
Four years ago Koor was the very symbol of Israeli-style statism, an arteriosclerotic, union-owned behemoth that measured success by the size of the payroll.
Today, thanks in part to a tough stance by the Israeli Government, Koor is a lean-and-mean conglomerate that sheds money-losing businesses faster than you can say "Charles Darwin."

It has taken several weeks, but America has begun to emotionally distance itself from Magic Johnson.
In a recent article by The Associated Press, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola, Andrew Giangola, brazenly admitted that a new promotional campaign featuring Johnson, whose contract with that company expires next summer, "is not on the front burner."
The article also quoted Marty Blackman, of the advertising consulting firm Blackman &amp; Rayber Limited, on the likelihood that "companies will fully support his public commitment and refrain from using him in active advertising."


Wheat and Soybeans Rise; Oil Prices Are Up Sharply
Wheat and soybean futures prices recovered from their recent selloff to close higher today, while crude oil prices jumped on year-end buying.
Wheat fell Monday on the possibility that the splitting of the Soviet Union could diminish food aid from the United States.
Soybean prices fell on expectations of large deliveries for both beans and soybean oil when the current contracts expire.


Sterling Optical In Bankruptcy
The Sterling Optical Corporation said today that it had filed for bankruptcy protection and had agreed to sell its stores.
Sterling, an eyeglass retailer based in Hackensack, filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in Manhattan, the company said in a statement, which provided no explanation for the filing.

U.N. Envoy Wins Yugoslav Peace Move
The United Nations special envoy, Cyrus R. Vance, won formal agreement from Serbian and Yugoslav officials today for a plan providing for a cease-fire, the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces and the withdrawal of the pro-Serb Yugoslav Army and Serb irregular units from the war-ravaged breakaway republic of Croatia.
The agreement today offers a glimmer of hope that progress has been made toward ending the six-month Serb-Croat war, which has taken thousands of lives and destroyed scores of towns and villages.
But despite the assurances given by the Serbs, serious doubts remain that the United Nations will be able to bring in peacekeeping forces any time soon because the crucial first step, a lasting cease-fire on Croatia's battlefields, has yet to be fulfilled despite 14 previous truce agreements.


Francis Tursi Is Dead; Professor of Viola, 69
Francis Tursi, a chamber musician and professor of viola at the Eastman School of Music for 36 years, died on Sunday at Bryn Mawr Hospital after a heart attack.
He was 69 years old and lived in Bryn Mawr.
Mr.
Tursi, originally from Camden, N.J., studied viola and composition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
He continued his composition studies with Bernard Rogers and Howard Hanson and received degrees from the Eastman School at the University of Rochester in 1946 and 1947.
He joined the faculty there in 1949.


BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY -- The Global Lab: Semiconductors; Costs May Be Too High For All-American Chips
When the Reagan Administration first pressed to open Japan's market to American semiconductors in the mid-1980's, the issue seemed as straightforward as an on-off switch: There were American chips, which the Japanese were not buying, and there were Japanese chips, of which the Japanese could not seem to buy enough.
The result was the United States-Japan semiconductor trade agreement.
But when the pact came up for renewal this past year, American companies were still complaining that their market share still fell far short.
In private conversation, however, many corporate executives acknowledged that the whole idea of an all-American chip was fast becoming a historical artifact.
No industry has seen a bigger blitz of international alliances.


Cowboys Not Lacking Incentive
A team in the second round of the National Football Conference playoffs probably doesn't need any extra motivation.
But for the Dallas Cowboys, some added incentive for their game against the Detroit Lions at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., Sunday can't hurt.
The Cowboys were mowed down near Motown on Oct. 27, 34-10.
In that game, Dallas outgained Detroit in total yards, 415-208, but turned the ball over four times, had a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown and gave up 24 second-half points.


Officer Kills Unarmed Man In Brooklyn
A police officer shot an unarmed man to death in Brooklyn last night, apparently mistaking the bottle he held in a paper bag for a gun, the police said.
Hector Rivera, 47 years old, was arguing with his stepson and his stepson's wife near his home at 12 Fayette Street in Bushwick at about 5:30 P.M., the police and one eyewitness said.

Newmark &amp; Lewis Closing 12 Stores
Newmark &amp; Lewis Inc., a New York City-area electronics and appliance dealer, said it would close 12 stores in January.
That would leave the retailer, which began 1991 with 67 stores, with just 14 outlets.
Ronald Fleischer, the company's chief executive, said holiday sales were substantially below expectations.
He said the economy had worsened since Newmark &amp; Lewis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late August.
About 100 employees are expected to be affected by the closings.
Mr.
Fleischer said the company would try to relocate some workers.


Bush, in Australia, Under Fire on Trade
President Bush opened a 12-day crusade today to increase American exports in the Western Pacific, picking as his first stop a country that, like his own, is mired in recession, running a 2-to-1 deficit with a major trading partner, and angry about the protectionism it says has sustained that sorry ratio.
But the villain here is not Japan, with which Australia actually enjoys a multibillion-dollar trade surplus.
Rather it is the United States that stands accused of holding off Australia's wheat and cattle industries in the name of protectionism, a charge that is getting Mr.
Bush's crusade for free trade in the Pacific off to a bumpy start.


Accord Reached to Halt Civil War in El Salvador
The Government of El Salvador and the leftist guerrillas who have fought to overthrow it for more than a decade announced in the first minutes of the new year a comprehensive plan to end their civil war.
Their accord capped an extraordinary day and night of talks that saw the departing Secretary General of the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar, postpone his retirement hour after hour to continue prodding the negotiators to settle their differences before the year ended.


Fare Wars in Albany: City-Suburban Clash
Behind the mixed signals today over just what the State Senate will do to hold the New York City bus and subway fare to $1.25 is a long-simmering clash between the six Republican Senators from New York City and many of their suburban counterparts in the Republican-led chamber.
The dynamics of power in the Legislature here are often cast along geographical fault lines, with the Democratic-led Assembly catering to New York City interests and the Senate representing its suburban and upstate constituents.


Quotation of the Day
"We are slowly dying, just as the Bible said we would. The only expectation is for things to get worse. Either there will be a civil war or we will all burn together, as it is written in the Apocalypse." -- MARIYA Y. VRUBLEVSKAYA, a retired factory worker in Moscow.  [ 4:2. ]


Sports of The Times; Never Back Hurricanes Into a Corner
THE assorted wizards, soothsayers and microchips have made a grievous mistake in recent polls.
They have given the Miami Hurricanes a cause, a mission, a common enemy.
This is never a good idea.
The Hurricanes are currently under the impression that some voters do not want them to win the unofficial national college football championship for the fourth time in a decade.
They are, if not mad, then bitter.
It works out the same.

Windstorm Kills 100 People In Three Provinces in Vietnam
High winds devastated parts of two Vietnamese coastal provinces over the weekend, killing at least 100 people and leaving nearly 500 missing, the official Vietnam News Agency reports.
The agency, in a dispatch seen here in Bangkok today, said 22 people died Saturday morning when a windstorm struck Quang Nam and Da Nang Provinces, destroying or sweeping away many boats in its path.
It said 193 people were missing, with a greater number possible.

Editorial Notebook; The World Through Beijing's Eyes
From America, China's leaders look tough, dangerous and maddeningly contemptuous of international opinion.
From close up, they look worried about adverse international trends, frightened by their post-Tiananmen isolation and willing to make pragmatic concessions.
There's no getting around many pernicious Chinese policies.
But by understanding Beijing's state of mind, Washington can respond in ways that increase American leverage.
Beijing offends international decency in a variety of ways.
It profits from prison labor and tolerates copyright piracy.
It relentlessly persecutes people who campaign for democracy and for self-rule in Tibet.
It supplies arms to Myanmar's murderous State Law and Order Restoration Council and, until recently, to Cambodia's genocidal Khmer Rouge.
It exports missiles to Syria and shares nuclear technology with Iran, Algeria and Pakistan.
When other countries protest, Beijing accuses them of impermissible interference in Chinese domestic affairs or colonialist trampling on China's culture and sovereignty.
No context can justify China's misdeeds or negate the need for a vigorous American response.
The challenge for Washington is to find responses likely to yield constructive results.
Deng Xiaoping and his hard-line allies crushed the 1989 democracy protests because they believed their survival was at stake.
Now, Beijing believes it has restored political stability.
China's rulers are unlikely to agree to release all political prisoners immediately for fear of resurrecting a powerful movement.
But they can and should be pressed toward leniency, case by case.
Prison exports and copyright violations grow out of the lawless atmosphere created by decades of revolutionary convulsions.
China's leaders are, on their own, taking steps toward rebuilding the rule of law.
These trade abuses also reflect Beijing's desperate drive to accumulate hard currency for development.
For Washington to threaten stiff trade sanctions if these practices persist is both appropriate and effective.
China's arms sales to tyrants and belligerents is deplorable.
But until the U.S. renounces such sales for itself, it cannot credibly demand purity from China.
U.S. diplomats have consistently raised arms sales and proliferation issues with Beijing, sometimes to good effect.
These efforts are worth continuing, and toughening.
Last month China assured Secretary of State Baker that it would soon ratify the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
Even now, Beijing is said to be applying treaty rules to its civilian nuclear cooperation with Iran.
China has also been prepared, for its own reasons, to discourage North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.
When viewed from Beijing, the Bush Administration's China policies seem tougher than many American critics think.
U.S. sanctions against China stayed in place far longer than Europe's or Japan's.
And while top leaders of other Western countries are again visiting Beijing, America has limited official travel to a tough-talking working visit by the Secretary of State.
America is now in an excellent position to work for changes in China.
But to do so, the Administration needs to rebuild a consensus on policy toward Beijing.
That consensus collapsed not only because of Beijing's murderous repression, but also President Bush's repeated stumbles in the months following the Tiananmen massacre.
The ideal way to undo the damage would be for the public to hear a clear articulation of U.S. values and purposes, direct from President Bush.

Bridge
Natural bidding runs into problems when it has to deal with direct raises.
The two-level and three-level are available to deal with three types of hand: weak, invitational and game-forcing.
In classical methods the single raise was always weak, the double raise always forcing, and the responder had to fudge with an intermediate hand of about 11 points.
Nowadays the limit raise is standard, so the 11-point hand can jump, but stronger hands have to use an artificial solution.


U.N. Plan for Saharan Voting Gains Support
A United Nations plan for ending the 16-year civil war in Western Sahara advanced today when the United Nations Security Council gave qualified support to proposals for organizing a referendum to determine the territory's future.
The departing Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, has drawn up guidelines for determining who should vote in this referendum.
The guidelines have been strongly criticized by the Polisario Front, which has been fighting Morocco for control of Western Sahara since Spain gave up the former colony in 1975.

Unity or Not? Soviet Heirs View 1992
Sixty-nine years ago, Communists from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and the Caucasus ushered in the New Year by proclaiming a new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Meeting in Minsk on the anniversary of that fateful event, the 11 successors to that union seemed to recoil from anything that might vaguely resemble the deed of their predecessors.


TOKEN PRICE RISES 10 CENTS, TO $1.25, IN NEW YORK CITY
Transit officials, after scrambling to put together a makeshift, tentative financing plan, officially voted yesterday to raise New York City's subway and bus fare to $1.25, from $1.15.
The new fare took effect at 12:01 A.M. today.
Tokens bought before the new fare went into effect will be accepted for an unspecified time, transit officials said.


Food Notes
Herring for Luck
In the South, black-eyed peas are the food for New Year's Day.
In Tuscany it's lentils.
In Eastern Europe, herring is a traditional symbol of good luck.
These days, the people of that region those need all they can get of both luck and herring.
For New Yorkers who want to try herring for a better 1992, one long-established source for the fish, in a variety of styles, is Russ &amp; Daughters, 179 East Houston Street (near Allen Street).
The store has been in business since 1914.
It is now featuring lightly salted matjes herrings, imported from Holland.
The silken-textured herrings are $2.99 each and will be filleted to order.
The store also sells fat Icelandic schmaltz herrings, cured in salt, for $2.25 each, or $1.25 for a single fillet.
German-style rollmops stuffed with onions are $1.99 each.
Ruddy Swedish matjes herrings with their sweet cure are $1.95 for a fillet; they come in the store's own brown sugar and cranberry sauce.
Pickled herrings -- plain, in cream sauce or mustard sauce -- are $1.75 each and chopped herring is $5.99 a pound.
Russ &amp; Daughters is open today from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M.
Normal hours are 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. seven days a week; (212) 475-4880.
Park Slope Patisserie
Dukens Daniel, a Haitian lawyer, immigrated to Brooklyn 26 years ago and wound up baking instead of practicing law.
He baked first at Ebinger's and then, after that company went out of business in the early 1970's, he baked for 19 years at William Greenberg Jr.
Desserts in Manhattan.
He opened his own bakery, Patisserie Daniel, at 388 Seventh Avenue (11th Street) in Park Slope, Brooklyn, two years ago.
"I waited until I could afford to buy a building because I did not want to have to depend on the whims of a landlord," Mr.
Daniel said.
The years spent at Greenberg's have left an indelible mark on Mr.
Daniel's baking.
Devotees of that bakery will recognize and appreciate Mr.
Daniel's delicious glazed dark chocolate cake, his buttery cookies, his hamantaschen and his schnecken.
He has put his own stamp on other items like breads, muffins, elegant little lemon meringue tarts, cheesecakes, brownies and pies.
Cookies are $15 a pound; chocolate cake is $12.95 for the 6-inch and $21.50 for the 8-inch size; small schnecken are 85 cents; brownies are $2, and a 6-inch cheesecake is $15.95.
The shop is open Monday through Friday, 6 A.M. to 9:30 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 6 A.M. to 6 P.M.; (718) 832-2323 or 832-2360.
Cooking Charitably
Project Open Hand, founded in San Francisco in 1985, provides meals for people with AIDS.
In 1989, the group published "The Open Hand Cookbook," edited by Robert C. Schneider (Pocket Books, $18.95), with recipes by chefs from the San Francisco Bay area; it was a successful fund-raising effort.
Now it has been followed by "The Open Hand Celebration Cookbook," edited by Stanley Eichelbaum (Pocket Books, $22).
The new book is filled with more than 60 seasonal and special-occasion menus and recipes contributed by chefs and food specialists in the region.
From both a culinary and charitable standpoint, it is lovely and worthwhile.
Chocolates With a Twist
Le Francais in Wheeling, Ill., has often appeared on lists of the best restaurants in the country.
Its new owners, Roland and Beth Liccioni, have put their own stamp on the place, while keeping the restaurant's classic style intact.
An example of the inventive elegance that now infuses Le Francais is Mrs.
Liccioni's range of chocolates.
Her finely wrought hand-dipped bittersweet chocolates come with lush, creamy ganache fillings flavored not only with the typical vanilla, mocha, hazelnuts and raspberries, but also with mint, an infusion of Earl Grey tea and an exotic mixture of fragrant spices.
The chocolates, which are served in the restaurant, can be ordered by mail.
A 10-piece 3.75-ounce sampler of Chocolats le Francais is $9; 21 pieces are $16.75; a 45-piece assortment, about a pound, is $33.
Postage is extra.
Telephone: (708) 541-7470.
Chefs on Skis
There will be nearly 500 skiers in toques schussing the slopes in Windham, N.Y., on Sunday, to start this year's round of five regional competitions for the annual Chefs Ski Race.
What began with two dozen chefs in 1975 has now grown into an international competition that now boasts the sponsorship of Grand Marnier and raises money through entry fees to benefit charities, among them City Harvest, City Meals-on-Wheels and several food banks.
It's a serious amateur ski competition enlivened by the skiers' decorated chefs jackets.
The series of races begins at 9 A.M. and continues until 3:30 P.M. at Ski Windham, off Exit 21 of the Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
Information: (518) 734-4300.
Fewer New Products
Shoppers may not have noticed, but this past year there were 10.6 percent fewer new food products (including old products in new sizes, styles or flavors) introduced onto the market than in 1990, a year that set a record for new product introductions, according to a study released by Marketing Intelligence Service, a market research firm in Naples, N.Y.
There was an overall decline of 3 percent in the number of new retail packaged products (including nonfood items), according to the study.
Still, some individual categories like beverages and pet products did show increases.
The service also reported that one-third of these new products claimed some kind of nutritional benefit, relating to the quantities of salt, cholesterol, fat, calories, fiber or sugar.
And a record 13 percent of the new products advertised some kind of environmental benefit.
The market research company expects the trend toward fewer new products to continue in 1992.
"More restrictive labeling regulations are likely to dampen, rather than accelerate, new foods and beverages that have thrived in recent years on a freewheeling climate for nutritional claims," said Richard Lawrence, president of Marketing Intelligence Service.
NEW FOODS WITH A TASTE OF PROVENCE
IT'S a first at Pierre Deux.
The chain of French country home-furnishings shops has just introduced a collection of food products.
They bear the label of Baumaniere, the name of the elegant restaurant and inn in Les Baux de Provence.
They were introduced in France last year, and in America are only available at the Pierre Deux retail shops.
They are infused with the herbaceous aromas and flavors of the south of France.
Honeys, mustards, vinegars, spice mixtures and even nougats are given unusual tastes like lavender or thyme.
The products include traditional candies from Aix-en-Provence and some expensive but excellent blended coffees.
Prices range from $5.50 for jars of mustard to $43 for calissons d'Aix, traditional glazed candies layered with glace fruit and almonds.
The products are sold at the Pierre Deux shop at 870 Madison Avenue (70th Street) and 12 others around the country.
They can also be ordered by calling (800) 874-3773.


Where Dickens Couldn't Get a Drink
To the Editor:
"Around the holidays, historic hotels become surrogate hearths and homes for families who return every year," you write in "Going Home (to a Hotel) for Holiday Meals" (Dec. 18).
"At these stately dowagers, the planning and baking, preserving and spicing of food for Christmas dinner begins months before the meal is served." You report that Charles Dickens stayed at the Golden Lamb, an inn in Lebanon, Ohio.
He did not stay the night there, but stopped to dine on Wednesday, April 20, 1842, as part of a marathon 23-hour journey from Cincinnati to Columbus, leaving at 8 A.M. and traveling all night.


Coslet and Steinberg Ready to Go Shopping
When Jets Coach Bruce Coslet and General Manager Dick Steinberg were asked about what the Jets needed to do to improve on this season's 8-8 record and the first trip to the playoffs since 1986, they both talked about defense and about depth.
"I think we need one more impact player on defense; I don't care where he plays," said Coslet.
"I also think we could use some more depth on our offensive line."


U.S. Adds Louisiana Black Bear To Its List of Threatened Species
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has listed the Louisiana black bear, the model for the traditional teddy bear, as a threatened species, but will continue to allow logging in the areas where the bear lives.
The listing, which grants protection under the Endangered Species Act, is based primarily on losses of the bear's habitat, which logging and development have reduced by more than 80 percent, service officials said Monday.
But the agency said normal logging would not place the bear in imminent danger of extinction.

CHRONICLE
TIM PETERS, the ex-husband of SALLIE BINGHAM, the media heiress, has been denied a claim to the Bingham family fortune.
Judge Benjamin Shobe of Circuit Court in Louisville, Ky., upheld a prenuptial agreement between Ms.
Bingham and Mr.
Peters, in which he gave up any claim to alimony.
The couple were divorced in October 1990.
In his 27-page ruling, Judge Shobe said that though Mr.
Peters "may now feel he made a bad bargain," that is not sufficient grounds for setting the agreement aside.
He also questioned Mr.
Peters's insistence that he married Ms.
Bingham for love, finding that "the uncontradicted evidence is that the petitioner married the respondent for her money and stayed married to her because of the material benefits that the relationship conferred." Mr.
Peters was, however, awarded various assets that, when sold, may be worth as much as $500,000.


Prices Paid To Farmers Decline 0.7%
Prices farmers get for raw products declined seven-tenths of 1 percent in December from the previous month and were 3.5 percent less than a year earlier, the Agriculture Department said today.
Lower prices for lettuce, cattle and tomatoes were partly offset by higher prices for eggs, wheat and hogs.


Tucson Electric's Revamping Plan
A Federal bankruptcy court dismissed an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed against the Tucson Electric Power Company, a company spokesman said, enabling the Arizona utility to procede with plans to restructure its debt and supplier contracts.
The court's action was a prerequisite for a 15 percent rate increase promised to Tucson Electric by the Arizona Corporation Commission.


Doors Begin to Open in Korea
The divided people of Korea have good reason to celebrate the old year along with the new.
The withdrawal of all U.S. nuclear arms from South Korea made the peninsula nuclear-free.
Now a potentially far-reaching agreement between the Governments of the South and the North could keep it that way.
Yesterday's accord reaffirms the commitment of the two Governments, undertaken in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, not to acquire nuclear arms.
And it goes two critical steps further: It commits North Korea not to construct facilities for reprocessing nuclear material, and it opens the way to on-site inspection by the South of a suspect facility in the North.


A Town's Disastrous Investment Fling
Normally, the talk around town in late December is of the Iowa State basketball team.
But this year, conversations have turned to the city's complex and highly speculative investments in options, part of a strategy that could have ended in devastating losses for taxpayers.
Marshalltown was one of dozens of municipalities early in December that found their investment funds frozen when their investment manager, Steven D. Wymer, was accused of fraud in handling their money.
Mr.
Wymer, the owner and president of Institutional Treasury Management Inc., a money-management firm in Irvine, Calif., was taken into custody and has been charged with securities fraud in connection with his management of $1.2 billion in money from state and local governments.


Settlement for Olson?
The New England Patriots could be close to settling a lawsuit with the former sportswriter LISA OLSON, who said she was harassed by the team owner, VICTOR KIAM, and three players during the 1990 season.
Olson filed suit last April against Kiam; the former general manager, PATRICK SULLIVAN, and three players ZEKE MOWATT, MICHAEL TIMPSON and ROBERT PERRYMAN.
Olson, who was working for The Boston Herald, charged that the players sexually harassed her on Sept. 17, 1990, in the team's Foxboro Stadium locker room.
She also charged that her civil rights were violated, and that the incident caused her emotional stress.


The Pop Life; Top 12's, or So
Given that the average buyer of recordings has access to a wider span of music, both chronologically and geographically, than at any other time in history, compiling Top 10 lists might seem like an exercise in inadequacy.
So they've been expanded slightly, to Top 12 (more or less) lists that include a few anthologies.
The intention is to acknowledge that much of the century's musical splendor is out there, waiting.
Whatever else these lists offer -- a reflection of cultural movement, the importance of the artists, or simply each critic's idea of pleasure -- they are meant to provide a path through the last year in popular music.


Yankees Still Muddled Despite Leadership Change
For the better part of a week, some of the New York Yankees' limited partners expressed their desires, publicly and privately, that the swirl of uncertainty surrounding a team be stopped.
That, these partners said, could easily be accomplished if only baseball commissioner Fay Vincent would let George Steinbrenner resume control of the team when the resignation of his successor, Robert Nederlander, became official yesterday.
But that was not about to happen.


That Extra Dime Is a Little to Some, a Lot to Others
As word of the new $1.25 subway and bus fare rumbled through the Brooklyn-bound No. 1 train yesterday afternoon, Tripp Evans struggled for the perfect analogy to describe how powerless he felt when contemplating the 10-cent fare increase.
"Unfortunately, it's like iceberg lettuce," said the 38-year-old humor writer from TriBeCa.
"I have to buy it."


Contract Keeps Jockeys on Job
A nationwide strike by jockeys has been averted after the Jockeys Guild and the Thoroughbred Racing Associations reached a tentative agreement on a contract to replace one that expired last night.
The guild told jockeys to accept mounts today, assuring continued racing action at tracks around the country.


Trade Talks With Japan Call for Toughness
To the Editor:
"Mr. Gephardt's Irresponsible Economics" (editorial, Dec. 22), criticizing my trade bill, embraces free trade theory and ignores the facts of Japan's adversarial capitalism.
Since 1980, the United States has accumulated a merchandise trade deficit of more than $1 trillion, of which Japan accounts for more than $400 billion.
Despite a 50 percent reduction in the value of the dollar since 1985, which has turned a trade deficit with the European Community into a substantial surplus, we have a $42 billion trade deficit with Japan.
Since our products sell in Europe, why does our trade deficit with Japan endure?


Story of the Weeping Icon Divides Greek Orthodoxy
The leadership of the traditional Greek Orthodox Church has cast doubts on the now famous Weeping Icon that was stolen from a small Greek Orthodox cathedral in Astoria, Queens, last week.
The traditional church has long been at canonical odds with the leadership of St.
Irene Chrysovalantou Greek Orthodox Cathedral, which is a member of a dissident sect of the Greek Orthodox church that left the main body in 1924.


Remember the Noriega Trial, Anyone?
To the Editor:
While the television news media inundated the airwaves with their gavel-to-gavel coverage of the William Kennedy Smith trial, did anyone notice the trial of Manuel Antonio Noriega on Federal drug and racketeering charges?
It required a United States military invasion of Panama to arrest General Noriega, and yet our television news media have remained largely silent, focusing instead on a rape trial that promised to break absolutely no new legal ground.
However, we may do well to remember the words of Thomas Jefferson, who warned that "a democracy cannot be both ignorant and free."


The Pop Life; Top 12's, or So
Given that the average buyer of recordings has access to a wider span of music, both chronologically and geographically, than at any other time in history, compiling Top 10 lists might seem like an exercise in inadequacy.
So they've been expanded slightly, to Top 12 (more or less) lists that include a few anthologies.
The intention is to acknowledge that much of the century's musical splendor is out there, waiting.
Whatever else these lists offer -- a reflection of cultural movement, the importance of the artists, or simply each critic's idea of pleasure -- they are meant to provide a path through the last year in popular music.


N.B.A. Fines Person
CHUCK PERSON of the Indiana Pacers was fined $7,500 by the N.B.A. for flagrantly elbowing Chicago's JOHN PAXSON in the fourth quarter of the Bulls' 109-104 victory Monday night.
In addition, 12 players -- 8 Bulls and 4 Pacers -- received automatic $500 fines for leaving the bench during the ensuing melee. (AP)


60-Minute Gourmet
IT seems appropriate after all of the holiday feasting and mirthmaking to offer a recipe that is restorative, wholesome and lean.
In France, we might have a pot-au-feu after the New Year's celebration -- which is essentially boiled lean cuts of meat, carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, celery, potatoes and parsnips.
The broth yielded by this combination of ingredients is sublime.
The American equivalent of pot-au-feu is the traditional New England boiled dinner.
Eighteenth-century American cooks boiled many foods, believing that this was the most salubrious method of cooking.
In the first cookbook written by an American -- "1796 American Cookery," by Amelia Simmons -- boiled meat dishes are common.
Little is known about Amelia Simmons, except that she lived near Hartford, and described herself in the book as "an American orphan."
One of the most popular recipes was for Alamode Beef, in which less tender cuts of beef were larded, seasoned and boiled with lots of herbs.
The New England boiled dinner is a logical evolution of that.
In my recipe, smoked shoulder or butt of pork is combined with winter vegetables and chicken quarters.
The smoked pork is already cooked, which greatly reduces boiling time.
The chicken legs and thighs go in last because they cook quickly.
Serve guests a little of each ingredient along with Dijon-style mustard, grated horseradish and cornichons.
A mixed green salad is all you need on the side. New England Boiled Dinner
1 head cabbage, about 1 pound  1 1/4 pound smoked shoulder or butt of pork  6 medium Washington or Idaho potatoes, about 1 1/4 pounds, peeled  6 carrots, about 1/2 pound, trimmed and scraped  2 leeks, trimmed and well washed  4 ribs celery, trimmed and tied  1 onion peeled and stuck with 2 cloves  2 teaspoons allspice  2 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried  1 bay leaf  6 peppercorns  Salt to taste  4 chicken legs and thighs.
1.
Remove and discard any tough outer leaves on the cabbage.
Quarter the cabbage and remove the core.
2.
In a large kettle, combine the pork butt, potatoes, cabbage, carrots, leeks, celery, onion, allspice, thyme, bay leaf and peppercorns.
Cover with water, and salt.
3. Cover and bring to a boil; simmer for 20 minutes.
4. Add the chicken legs and simmer for 15 minutes more.
5.
Serve with Dijon-style mustard, cornichons or grated fresh horseradish, or any combination of all of these garnishes.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings Mixed Green Salad
1 head Boston lettuce  1bunch watercress  1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard  2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar  1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic  4 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  2 ripe plum tomatoes, cored and sliced thin  1 medium Vidalia or red onion, peeled and sliced thin  Shaved Gruyere or Parmesan cheese for garnish.
1.
Core the Boston lettuce and separate the leaves.
Trim off the tough stems of the watercress.

Yield: 4 servings


Defying Fernandez, Panel Names Bronx Principals
Amid charges of anti-Semitism and lying, members of a Bronx school board defied Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez on Monday night and approved the appointments of six principals.
A spokesman for the Chancellor said that if the board refused to rescind the appointments Mr.
Fernandez would supersede the board.


Treasury Bonds Continue to Gain
Treasury bond prices moved higher yesterday and long-term interest rates fell again in light pre-holiday trading, as dealers closed their books on what for most was a highly profitable year.
Retail accounts seeking to lock in higher yields were responsible for most of the day's purchases, traders and analysts said.
But thin trading exaggerated the size of the gains, which amounted to more than half a point on some longer-dated issues.


Back in the Screening Room With Stalin
The most potent symbol in the new film "The Inner Circle" is the one audiences will never see.
It's inside Lenin's head -- literally.
Andrei Konchalovsky, the film's director, gained permission to shoot numerous scenes in the Moscow headquarters of the K.G.B., whose lobby is dominated by a massive bust of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the first chief of the Soviet secret police.
Mr.
Konchalovsky wanted to move the sculpture and replace it with a bust of Lenin, but on this point he could not prevail.
"So we simply wrapped Lenin around Dzerzhinsky," the director said, laughing.
What appears on screen is a gleaming steel head of Lenin, thinking a private, very frightening thought.
The nightmare that unfolded from that thought is the subject of Mr.
Konchalovsky's first film on Russian themes since the highly acclaimed "Siberiade," made in 1979.
"The Inner Circle" surveys the Stalin years through the eyes of Ivan Sanshin, a young, idealistic Communist who works as the Kremlin's film projectionist.
The character is based on Aleksandr Ganshin, who showed films for Stalin and other top Government figures, including Lavrenti Beria, chief of the secret police.
A Nation Seduced


Yanks Pick Managing Partner Amid Rumblings
The Yankees, whose front-office situation seems to grow more and more troubled, finally selected a managing general partner yesterday to replace Robert Nederlander.
But the choice, Daniel R. McCarthy, immediately put the situation under a new cloud.
The elevation of McCarthy, a minority owner who was instrumental in helping George Steinbrenner purchase the Yankee franchise from CBS in 1973 and who serves as Steinbrenner's tax lawyer, was in doubt because he does not live in New York and because he sued Commissioner Fay Vincent in 1990, shortly after the commissioner had reached a disciplinary agreement with Steinbrenner for the Yankee owner to remove himself from the team's day-to-day operations.


BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY -- The Global Lab: Aerospace; International Flights, Indeed
Every new airliner is the product of international cooperation.
In the new Boeing 777 program, for example, the Boeing Company is manufacturing only the wings, nose structure and engine nacelles.
The rest of the wide-body airplane will come from hundreds of subcontractors in North America, Japan and Europe.
The main fuselage sections, for example, will be fabricated in Japan; the wing flaps come from Italy.
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Boeing's only domestic rival in the airliner business, wants to go even further.
It is seeking to sell 40 percent of its civil airliner business to the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, a newly formed entity that has the backing of the Taiwan Government.
Because no military technology is involved, the deal requires no approval from the United States Government.


Inquiries Into Deaths at City College Find Dizzying Confusion
A swirl of confusion continued yesterday around events that led up to the crushing human tide that killed eight young people waiting to get into a basketball game at City College on Saturday night, with college officials, an entertainment promoter and a private security agency explaining their actions.
For the first time, an explanation was offered for the whereabouts of the money raised by the event but even that was cloaked in some uncertainty.


New Rochelle Fire Deals New Blow to Downtown
In the wake of a fire that destroyed a dozen stores and offices in the heart of the downtown business district here, detectives searched the rubble today for clues to how the fire began, and neighboring merchants wondered how many disappointments they could endure.
The recession has not been kind to this once-thriving shopping district.
Empty stores with "For Rent" signs in the windows are ubiquitous.
Shopping malls in neighboring communities have drawn away many customers, and developers' promises to inject new life into downtown New Rochelle have gone unfulfilled.
The Christmas shopping season was, in the words of more than one local merchant, "a disaster."

Mutual Funds End '91 on a High
Stock mutual funds had a banner year in 1991, apparently their best ever, fund managers say, and bond funds, which drew in almost twice as much money as stock funds, seem to have turned in their best sales figures since their peak year of 1986.
"People are beginning to realize that after inflation and taxes, they might be losing money on bank C.D.'s and money market rates," said Gavin Quill, a marketing analyst for the Scudder family of funds in Boston.
"The low cash returns are converting people who used to be savers into investors."


Foreign Affairs; Freedom Against All Odds
Humankind seems poised to survive the 20th century.
It has not been easy.
And it is frighteningly uncertain where leaders and events will take the story next.
But humanity's survival from the beginning of World War I until now, and arriving at this point with glimmers of freedom in places familiar only with tyranny, is a monumental achievement that should give courage almost whatever the unhappy turns of the next few years.

Insurance Rate Increase Rejected
The New York State Insurance Department said it had rejected a request by U.S.
Healthcare Inc. for a 10.7 percent average rate increase.
The move pulled the company's stock price down $3.50 today, to $41.50, in over-the-counter trading, with the price falling as much as $5.25 a share.
More than 2.8 million shares were traded.
Officials of U.S.
Healthcare, based in Blue Bell, Pa., were not available to comment.


For a Robust Seafood Gumbo, Mix and Match Ingredients
NOW is just the time for a robust seafood gumbo, a real heartwarmer in this cold season.
I've called for a lot of ingredients in this gumbo, but you can eliminate and make substitutions, based on market availability and price.
For example, I use both fish and shrimp, but one or the other is quite sufficient.
You can also add sausage or ham, both of which are often found in traditional gumbo recipes.
Especially good choices would be the tasso ham of Louisiana and andouille, a spicy American sausage, very popular in New Orleans, that is totally different from its French namesake.
Sausage has the advantage, too, of being relatively inexpensive.


2 Koreas Agree on Nuclear Ban, But Not on Method of Inspections
North and South Korea announced today that they had initialed an agreement banning nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula, but the two sides did not settle on measures to insure compliance.
According to a text provided by South Korean officials, the agreement says that each side will be allowed to inspect "objects" on the other's territory "in order to verify the de-nuclear ization of the Korean Peninsula." But the procedures and methods for these inspections have yet to be decided by a joint nuclear control committee.


SOVIET BRAIN DRAIN POSES ATOMIC RISK, U.S. REPORT WARNS
Bush Administration officials are expressing apprehension that the economic deterioration of the former Soviet Union, the demoralization of its military forces and an expected high rate of unemployment may prompt some of its top experts with the know-how for making nuclear weapons to sell their services abroad.
A classified report prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence bureaus and agencies on weapons proliferation in the former Soviet Union warns that the potential for nuclear mercenaries is more worrisome than the danger of nuclear-related materials going astray because they are easier to control, said officials familiar with the report.


Tired of Relying on U.S., Japan Seeks to Expand Its Own Intelligence Efforts
Japan is quietly moving to reshape and expand its intelligence operations in an effort to wean itself from its dependence on American analysis of threats to its economic and military security.
Officials here say they are not hiring spies and would steer clear of creating a single, large intelligence agency.
Their biggest concern, they say, is to avoid rekindling memories of the Japanese secret police of half a century ago.


BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY The Global Lab -- A special report inside: Industry by industry, pages 48-49.; Technology Without Borders Raises Big Questions for U.S.
Just as they once moved manufacturing plants overseas, American companies are now spreading their research and product development around the world, helping to turn the creation of technology into an activity that transcends national borders.
The trend raises tough new issues for policy makers intent on preserving jobs for Americans and keeping the nation competitive in high-technology industries like aerospace, pharmaceuticals and information processing.
But many business leaders say the march toward technology with no national allegiances -- the march toward the borderless lab -- is as inevitable as it is irrevocable.
Government policies that do not adapt to this fundamental industrial shift, many executives contend, are bound to fail.


U.C.L.A. Stonewalls Illinois by 6-3
U.C.L.A. turned two Illinois turnovers into two field goals by Louis Perez as the Bruins outmuscled the Illini, 6-3, in the John Hancock Bowl today.
The victory gave Bruins Coach Terry Donahue eight consecutive victories in bowl games, starting with a 24-14 victory over Michigan in the 1983 Rose Bowl.


The Pop Life; The Garden Says It Can Handle Big Rap Show Friday
Saturday's catastrophe at City College, where eight people died in the crush as a throng tried to force its way into an overcrowded celebrity basketball game featuring rappers and singers, has once again brought attention to the relationship between violence and musical events.
On Friday, the rappers Public Enemy, Queen Latifah, Kid 'n' Play, the Geto Boys, D.J.
Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince and Naughty by Nature will be performing at Madison Square Garden, the first local arena-sized rap show in recent memory.
"We're getting inundated with calls," said Monie Feurey, the vice president for communications at Madison Square Garden.
"But frankly, I don't understand it. The situations are so different. We have professional crowd control; we're in a business, so we have to know what we're doing. And what we're doing for this show is no different than what we do for say, Guns 'n' Roses or other heavy-metal acts."

U.S. Official Calls Muslim Militants a Threat to Africa
A few weeks before the Islamic Salvation Front swept to victory in the first round of national legislative elections in Algeria, a senior Bush Administration official was analyzing the many faces of political ferment in Africa in the 1990's: the drift to anarchy in Somalia, the move to democracy in Zambia, unrest in Zaire and the promise of peaceful change in South Africa.
At the end, he paused to reflect on the single most worrisome trend for policy makers.
"The march of Islamic fundamentalism," he said.


Shifts at Top Of an Insurer
The Niagara Exchange Corporation said today that Edward G. Wright had been named president and chief executive of the Exchange Insurance Company, its primary operating subsidiary.

Currency Set In Argentina
The peso, Argentina's fifth currency in 22 years, will be introduced on Wednesday to replace the austral, which was devalued by inflation to near worthlessness.
New peso bills were distributed by the central bank this week, but most Argentines will not see them until banks reopen on Thursday after a bank holiday today and New Year's Day.


Indicators Dropped 0.3% In November
The Government index meant to predict the economy fell three-tenths of 1 percent in November, the fourth straight month without a significant advance.
At the same time, a companion gauge of current economic conditions issued by the Commerce Department dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent, suggesting that the economy may have contracted slightly in the final quarter of the year after modest gains in the spring and summer.

He was 79 years old and lived in Washington.
He died after a long illness, said a spokesman for his firm.

BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY -- The Global Lab: Pharmaceuticals; Though Markets Vary, Drugs Work Anywhere
Drug research has become as international as medicine itself, and pharmaceuticals are among the few products in which the United States can boast a net surplus of exports over imports.
The final tally for 1991 is expected to show an American surplus of $1.4 billion, up from $1.2 billion a year earlier, with some $900 million of the surplus coming from sales to Japan, the world's second-largest drug market after the United States.


Manville Sells 50 Acres
The Manville Corporation said today that it had sold a 50-acre site here that had been cleared of hazardous wastes to ARCO.
Terms were not disclosed.
The sale includes the transfer of all water rights at the site.Manville operated a pipe plant and insulation manufacturing plant at the site from the 1930's through 1982.
Two years later, the empty site was placed on the California Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund list of hazardous waste sites to be cleaned up.
Manville completed the cleanup in June 1990.


Hunger Is Stalking the New Year in Moscow
As 1991 was drawing to a close, Mariya Y. Vrublevskaya went out shopping in a faint snow for a pine tree so she and her two young granddaughters could decorate a traditional yolka to cheer up their spare New Year's celebrations.
What the 62-year-old retired factory worker discovered was that the trees, like everything else connected with this eerie holiday, had soared in price, costing 10 times more than last year and way beyond the means of grandmothers trying to bring up two girls on a combined pension and part-time pay of 250 rubles a month.


No More Free Brunch
In the darkest days of the Great Depression, when banks failed, businesses went bankrupt and old family fortunes crumbled, membership in even the nicest men's clubs declined.
Things got so bad at the Harvard Club, which was losing more than five hundred members a year, that its board imposed severe cost-cutting measures.
In 1931, the club abruptly stopped ordering matchbooks embossed with the club insignia.
While nothing so drastic has yet occurred at most of New York City's dozens of social clubs, even some of the most prestigious preserves of the city's well-to-do are hearing the sharp, cold knock of the recession at their doors.


Metropolitan Diary
DEAR Diary:
At 7 A.M., on my way to work the other morning, it seemed like a good idea to grab a bran muffin as fortification against the long day ahead.
Little did I know.
The glass door at the local Food Emporium was a bit recalcitrant, so I applied that extra shove New Yorkers know is often needed.
On this occasion the door slipped its track, tipping rapidly in my direction.
Acting more on instinct than good judgment, I caught the door in midtilt and found myself holding an enormous piece of glass and steel that was no longer attached to the ground by any other fastening save my own tenuous grip.
By some adrenaline-induced miracle, however, I managed to totter under this incredibly heavy object all the way across the entrance hall of the Food Emporium, bringing it to an incredibly soft landing against the far wall.
Still shaking from my narrow escape, I motioned to the woman standing behind the register who had apparently witnessed the episode with something less than the astonishment one might expect.
"I'm sorry," she said. "We're closed." -- ERIC W. ANNER

The scene, the second floor of Kiddie City in Manhattan.
The time, the height of the recent Christmas bustle.
A woman, holding a book she has chosen for her grandson, collars a Kiddie City employee.
"Excuse me," the customer says.
"Where is checkout?"
The employee looks quite puzzled. A long silence. Then he asks, "Is that a game?"
Customer: "No, I just want to pay for this book."
The employee directs her to the cashier.
The woman pays for the book and chuckles all the way home.
"Christmas shopping can really be fun," she says to no one in particular. -- EDITH MARTIN

. . .
Dear Diary:
A funny thing happened on the way to Grand Central this time of the year a decade or so ago.
It was a chilly Wednesday and I -- a suburban lady of a certain age who comes to town occasionally on business -- decided to forgo the rush-hour pleasures of the commuter trains and leave the city early.
I hailed a cab on the corner of Eighth Avenue and 59th Street.
It was 1:20 P.M.
Plenty of time to catch the 2:05 to Westport.
Two blocks later, the cab came to a complete halt.
I had not included the holiday traffic in my plans.
There we sat, my philosophical, middle-aged driver and I, exchanging complaints about the double-parking, the economy, the weather, the Mayor.
I closed my eyes.
When I opened them, we were turning into Vanderbilt Avenue.
It was 20 minutes past 2.
My train was long gone, the next one not until 3:05.
"What do I owe you?" I asked.
"I hate to tell you, lady," the driver replied. "It looks like the national debt."
I pulled a bill from my wallet.
Waiting for change, I wondered: Should I check my packages and take a walk?
Too cold.
Read in the station?
Ugh!
Get on the train?
It wouldn't even be in yet.
"Lady," said the driver, "it's been a lousy day. Can I buy you a drink?" I hesitated perhaps a second and a half.
"You sure can," I heard myself say with enthusiasm.
We left the cab in front of the Biltmore, he locked his cash box and my packages in the trunk (could one have dared do that 10 years ago?) and, the quintessential odd couple, marched arm in arm into McCann's across the street.
Forty minutes later, we said goodbye.
We had shared first names, the stories of our respective long-term marriages and a bowl of french fries.
As we parted, he grinned.
"Doris, you made my day."
"Thank you, Ralph." -- DORIS F. JACOBY


U.S. Orders Assessment of Harm Caused by Dams
A Federal energy agency is undertaking a long review of scores of hydroelectric dams, and promises a new era in which such dams will be operated in ways aimed at reducing or eliminating damage to the environment.
Over the next two years, the agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, will review applications from utilities, paper mills that run dams for their own power and other industries to relicense 237 of the country's oldest hydroelectric dams and generating stations.
That is the most hydroelectric projects to come up for relicensing at any one time in the agency's 71-year history.


Corrections
A capsule news report about the stock market yesterday in the "Inside" summary on page A1 misstated the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average for December, through Monday.
It was 269.23 points.
For the year, through Monday, the Dow had risen 530.25 points.


Mitchell D. Schweitzer, 86, Dies; Served as a Judge in Manhattan
Mitchell D. Schweitzer, who retired in 1972 as a New York State Supreme Court Justice after more than 26 years on various benches in New York City courts, died on Monday at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J.
A former resident of Manhattan, Judge Schweitzer was 86 years old and lived in Wayside, N.J.
His death was caused by congestive heart failure, his family said.


Chefs' Hopes For '92 Include Lasting Till '93
CHEFS usually hesitate to think beyond their plats du jour.
But at certain times, they are willing to raise their line of vision above the morning's market basket and peer into the future.
Times like now, with a new year dawning, the economic climate uncertain and popular tastes in flux.
They say that business will improve, or that it will not.
They say that customers want their plates loaded with hefty portions, or that they want tasting menus with food that is lighter than ever.
So much for consensus.


Candidates Must Flee NBC-Style 'Debates'
To the Editor:
The sorry spectacle of NBC's televised Democratic "debate" (front page, Dec. 16) restates the sorry states of both network television and the Democratic Party.
How could Ron Brown, Democratic national chairman, and the candidates allow this sequel to 1988's "seven dwarfs" to happen?
The sequel is worse than the original.
An imperious Tom Brokaw stands before these seated inferiors (they're only candidates for the Presidency) and sternly tasks them to answer briefly questions that should be important enough to require exposition.


Chemical Bank Merger Is Official
In formally announcing their merger yesterday, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover said the savings from their combination would be greater than previously estimated.
Although the companies are now legally combined, the merger of their subsidiary banks will not be completed until the middle of the year, and customers must still pay different prices and use different branches.


Heat Activates Douglas
The newly signed Miami point guard, SHERMAN DOUGLAS, was activated by the Heat yesterday and may start taking off pounds in Seattle tomorrow.
The third-year pro passed a physical after two days of tests, but he was 12 pounds over his Heat-mandated playing weight of 183, and his body fat was about 15 percent higher than last season.
The Heat decided Saturday to match a seven-year, $17 million offer sheet he signed Dec. 13 with the Los Angeles Lakers. (AP)


Estrogen Is Found to Improve Mood, Not Just Menopause Symptoms
A Los Angeles research team has shown that in addition to the established benefits of estrogen replacement after menopause, it also improves the mood and psychological functioning of well-adjusted, healthy women without any distressing menopausal symptoms.
Estrogen hormones given to women to replace those the body stops making at menopause were already known to relieve menopausal symptoms like hot flushes, vaginal dryness and urinary tract irritability, and it was also known that replacement hormones slow the loss of bone with age and help lower cholesterol levels.


Personal Health
Winter has more than its share of petty annoyances that people can do little or nothing about.
But many of the distressing aspects of the dark cold months ahead can be mitigated by knowledge, forethought and simple preventive measures.
While you may be at the mercy of transportation systems that bog down in ice and snow, you need not be plagued, for example, by brittle skin or respiratory infections that just won't quit.
Nor should myths and old wives' tales govern your life.


Trade Talks With Japan Call for Toughness; Where Theory Fails
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 22 editorial attack on Representative Richard Gephardt reminds me of a cancer patient in the denial phase.
Reality is too difficult, so the doctor must be wrong.
Your economic analysis is simply silly.
You argue that we should not try to end the trade deficit because that would strengthen the dollar and affect the trade balance.
But achieving some sort of equilibrium is just what we want; there is no inherent virtue in a weak currency.
Nonetheless, your arguments do bring out a couple of salient facts, even if in a somewhat backward manner.


A Flurry of Drug Approvals by the F.D.A.
Tying its record for new drug approvals in a single year, the Food and Drug Administration said late yesterday that it had approved four new drugs this week, bringing the 1991 total to 30.
The list included Zoloft, a Pfizer treatment for depression that analysts predicted would have $1 billion in worldwide sales by 1995.
Working late on New Year's Eve, F.D.A. officials also approved two antibiotics, Eli Lilly's Lorabid, and Warner-Lambert's Penetrex, as well as Ismo, a chest-pain treatment made by American Home Products.

Given that the average buyer of recordings has access to a wider span of music, both chronologically and geographically, than at any other time in history, compiling Top 10 lists might seem like an exercise in inadequacy.
So they've been expanded slightly, to Top 12 (more or less) lists that include a few anthologies.
The intention is to acknowledge that much of the century's musical splendor is out there, waiting.
Whatever else these lists offer -- a reflection of cultural movement, the importance of the artists, or simply each critic's idea of pleasure -- they are meant to provide a path through the last year in popular music.


Devils Show a Flair In Topping Penguins
It was the turn of the inconsistent Devils to play well, and tonight they did so in smashing fashion, knocking off the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, 7-4, at the Civic Arena.
Scott Stevens and Valery Zelepukin led the Devils with two goals apiece.
Aleksei Kasatonov, Laurie Boschman and Dave Barr (empty net) also had goals for New Jersey, which posted its first victory in its last nine games against Patrick Division opponents.


Many Children Learn Early the Importance of Giving to the Neediest Cases
"What do you need to live?" asked a note attached to a $25 contribution to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"You need water and shelter and the basic thing you need is money. If you are rich you should give people who are poor some of your money. If you don't give people some of your money people will die of starvation. Would you like it if you died of starvation?"
The letter, written by 6-year-old Mark Weinberger of Newton, Mass., reflects the forthrightness of many of the youngest contributors to the Neediest Cases.
In dozens of notes the children have managed to overcome all the social policy questions that divide the left from the right, Democrat from Republican, and they have boiled the issue of poverty down to a simple thought: Those with more should help those with less.


150 Nonunion County Workers in Nassau to Start Receiving Layoff Notices
With 3,000 unionized Nassau County workers facing layoffs, county officials said today that they would begin notifying 150 nonunion employees by Friday that their jobs, too, are being eliminated.
David Veiser, a spokesman for Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive, declined to specify which jobs would be eliminated.
The cutbacks were announced on Monday by Mr.
Gulotta, who also said he would impose a 5 percent pay cut for nonunion employees making over $65,000 a year.

Sports of The Times; Baseball's Sinus Pain Recurs
ON July 31, 1990, on the morning after George Steinbrenner was exiled from baseball, Commissioner Fay Vincent had a phone call from an old friend.
Bob Strauss, known formally as Robert S. Strauss, once the national chairman of the Democratic Party and now the United States Ambassador to Russia, was on the horn.
"Just remember," Strauss told the commissioner, "that George Steinbrenner is like sinus. He may not be bothering you today, but he'll always be there."

5-Touchdown Flurry Sinks Vols
In one of the most improbable comebacks in recent memory, a Penn State football team that trailed by 10 points late in the third quarter scored five touchdowns in a span of less than 8 minutes today and rallied for a 42-17 victory over Tennessee in the 21st Fiesta Bowl.
"We were in absolute disbelief on the sidelines and I'm sure they were too," said the Penn State quarterback, Tony Sacca, who completed only 11 passes, but threw four for touchdowns.

Slain Officer May Have Been Protecting One Thief From Another
The police are investigating whether an off-duty police officer who was killed on Saturday when he broke up a a robbery at a bank cash machine may have been protecting one thief from another.
Detectives think that the robbery victim, who fled while Sgt.
Keith R. Levine was killed, "possibly is a criminal" because records from the bank branch indicate that "a stolen automated-teller-machine card was used before the homicide," said Sgt.
Peter Sweeney, a spokesman for the police.

While Vincent has said repeatedly that there would be no negotiations until the suits were dropped, his comments yesterday were the first sign that Steinbrenner was moving to do so.


Banking Crisis Still Grips Rhode Island
On New Year's Day 1991, Bruce Sundlun was inaugurated as the new Governor of Rhode Island.
Less than an hour after the ceremony, he announced that 45 banks and credit unions would be closed indefinitely because of the collapse of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation, the private fund that insured them.
More than $1 billion, belonging to more than 150,000 depositors, was frozen.
A year later, many of those people still have not been paid, and state regulators are still ironing out how to do so.

Review/Philharmonic; What's a New Year's Eve Without Party Animals?
There are two traditions of New Year's Eve orchestral concerts.
The dominant one treats the evening as an opportunity for frivolity and escapism, a chance to set aside everyday burdens and be surrounded by music that is lush, undemanding and entertaining.
The alternative view is that the evening is best used for reflection, either on the year gone by and the one about to begin or on some humanistic ideals that might yet be attained.
The New York Philharmonic generally chooses its New Year's Eve programs from the less strenuous column A, but within that context, this year's program offered a few odd twists.
The concert, a benefit for the orchestra's pension fund, was conducted by Leonard Slatkin and had as its centerpiece a wickedly unconventional rendering of Saint-Saens's popular "Carnival of the Animals."

With Islanders, the Defense Rests
Only the San Jose Sharks have given up more goals than the Islanders this season, and they have excuses.
They are an expansion team and they have played two more games.
The Islanders have no such rationalizations, and their 8-5 loss to the Washington Capitals today was a poor excuse for a hockey game.
New York trailed by 2-1 after one period and by 6-2 after two.
Only a letdown by the home team early in the third period gave the Islanders some faint, brief, false hope for an upset.


Editorial Notebook; Faces of Japan
After just a week in Japan, some familiar American stereotypes about this country and its people seem shockingly superficial and dangerously out-of-date.
Japanese society differs from America's in important ways.
But like American society, Japanese society is neither monolithic nor static.
Today's Japan is one of the world's most modern, most affluent societies, plugged into every trend in international pop culture and a powerful creator of new trends for others.
Its young people are highly educated, fashion-conscious and remarkably well traveled.
Its face is far more diverse, and youthful, than would ever be guessed from the cautious politicians and corporate tycoons who dominate the news.


COLLEGE FOOTBALL: It's Election Day for Miami and Washington; Cornhuskers Caught in Eye of Hurricanes

The Hurricanes, a group with no audible shortage of confidence, surprised themselves with a defensive effort that became a memorable exclamation point.
Miami raised its level from unbeatable to suffocating as it overpowered, outran and overwhelmed Nebraska, 22-0, in the 58th Orange Bowl.


Save Somalia From Itself
Since civil war broke out in Somalia on Nov. 17, as many as 20,000 people, mainly civilians, have been killed or wounded.
Many more Somalis are starving to death because the fighting is preventing relief agencies from distributing emergency food supplies in the East African country.
Most of the thousands of injured Somalis cannot make it to the few rudimentary hospitals remaining in Mogadishu, the capital.
The war continues to escalate, yet the world largely ignores it.
The fighting pits two clans of the Hawiye tribe, who are battling for control of Mogadishu.
Other factions, including forces of ousted dictator, Mohammed Siad Barre, control other regions.
One group, the Somali National Movement, has declared an independent state in the north of the country.


Bill of Rights Only Spelled Out Our Freedoms; Why Madison Switched
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis reports in "If Madison Were Here" (column, Dec. 13): "James Madison, who had opposed a bill of rights, was persuaded and drafted the amendments."

In New Hampshire, Needy Schools Test a Tradition: Little State Aid
When a ceiling collapsed in the elementary school here, officials were so strapped for money that they had to take proceeds from a candy sale by parents that had been intended for a new playground.
Similar shortages in poorer towns around New Hampshire have prompted five school districts to sue Gov.
Judd Gregg and other officials, challenging the state's system of paying for public education and, by extension, its most cherished political policy: the refusal to adopt a state income tax or sales tax.


U.S. DISASTER AID WAS COSTLY IN '91
A sharp increase in the number of natural disasters that state and local governments could not handle resulted in nearly a doubling of a normal year's Presidential disaster-aid declarations in 1991, the Federal Emergency Management Agency says.
In a report issued Monday, the agency said that a wide range of natural disasters -- from wildfires in Washington State to floods in Texas and Hurricane Bob along the Atlantic Coast -- caused President Bush to declare 43 major disasters last year.
That was 20 more than are declared in an average year, but only 5 more than were declared in 1990.

Hollywood Delighted At Holiday Success. But Relaxed? No.

After a tepid economic year in Hollywood, such films as "Hook," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Father of the Bride" did strong business over the holidays in a time of recession.
And many movie executives, vacationing in such places as Aspen, Colo.; Sun Valley, Idaho, and Maui, Hawaii, read their daily faxes of box office returns and proclaimed business better than ever.

HOME IMPROVEMENT
IF you need more storage space after the holidays or if you want to break in some new tools, here are two easy shelving projects: one supported by brackets and standards, the other a hanging style.
Shelves attached by brackets to slotted metal standards or strips mounted on a wall are easy even for novices to build.
Hardware stores carry the standards and brackets and sometimes even prefinished shelves.
Or you can make the shelves yourself.
A good choice is nominal 1-by-8 lumber, which actually measures three quarters of an inch thick by seven and a quarter inches wide.
Plywood is suitable, but cutting it and neatly covering its raw edges will complicate the project.


Yeltsin and Russians Prepare For Harshness of Price Plan

The Government will continue to set ceilings on basic food and fuels, but even those will be three to five times higher.

Long Viewed as Safe From Slumps, Las Vegas Finally Feels the Recession
For some time Las Vegas has purveyed an escapist world of fantasy and gambling and a view of itself as largely resistant to national recessions.

There are more visitors than ever under the neon glare, but they are gambling less and spending less.

Overhauling Services: The Long, Painful Process -- A Special Report; Employment in Service Industry, Impetus to Boom in 80's, Falters
For decades, banks, fast-food restaurants, hospitals, law firms, retail chains and governments -- the so-called service sector -- have been the engine that powered the great American job machine.
In the 1980's, when services added a stunning 21 million jobs and employed almost four out of five workers, Americans debated whether service jobs were good jobs or bad jobs, but basically took the steady growth of services for granted.
No more.
Except for health care, the services are in the throes of a pervasive shake-up very much like the one that racked smokestack manufacturing a decade ago.
The concerted drive to squeeze costs and improve profits has resulted in extensive cost-cutting, job freezes, layoffs, consolidations and takeovers.
The storm threatens to last much longer than the recession -- prolonged, very likely, by the wave of white-collar layoffs and the unusual reluctance among service companies to hire.

Bill of Rights Only Spelled Out Our Freedoms
To the Editor:
As we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, it is especially appropriate that we see that amazing document not only for what it is, but also for what it is not.

Investors' Hopes Overseas Shaded by Doubt
The professionals who spend their time pondering foreign stock markets say that on balance they are optimistic about 1992.
But their optimism, bolstered by an end-of-the-year rally, is tempered by the underlying economic outlook, especially uncertainity about a global recovery.
This makes 1992 harder to call than 1991, despite the threat of the war at the beginning of last year.

Low Rates Expected to Continue for Bonds
Credit market analysts and economists say the precipitous decline in short-term interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve Board over the last 18 months should begin to pay some dividends for the economy in the second half of this year.
Few of them, however, expect much more than a tepid rebound.
If they are right, short-term rates will stay low, and bond yields, which remained stubbornly high through much of 1991, will probably fall.

From Leg Lifts to 'Later' on First Day of New Year
On New Year's Day, some people make resolutions.
Others act on them.
The latter species could be found in the New York Health and Racquet Club on West 56th Street and one of the few fitness centers open in the New York metropolitan region.
While the weaker-willed made vows to eat right and get fit over one last Bloody Mary or burger, gladiators of the 1990's sweated in the New Year.
"Unfortunately, this place was open," said Lorraine Noel, who, wearing a black leotard, stood outside a packed and vigorous step aerobic class, one of a small crowd of compulsives impatiently waiting for the 1 o'clock session.
"Actually, I was hoping all the clubs would be closed, so I'd have an excuse." Ms.
Noel, a secretary, had made a resolution for 1992 that was shared by virtually everyone in that seven-floor, 45,000-square-foot mirror-and-steel temple of tautness.
"I just want to keep doing what I am doing, exercise every day and stay healthy." The 'Weekend Warriors'
Guilt-ridden gourmands in New Jersey flocked to Bally's Holiday Fitness Center, a health spa at Quaker Bridge Mall in Lawrenceville.
"We're seeing our share of weekend warriors today," said Kevin T. McClain, the assistant manager, who spent the day guiding dozens of potential clients on an open house of his gym.
"With all the holiday food, the cookies and the extra poundage, you've got a lot of people with New Year's resolutions to lose weight."

For the first time ever, New York enthusiasts were able to end a year with a tournament.

Welland, who was en route along with his partner, Henner, to his fifth regional victory in 1991, found himself in four spades as South and regretted his optimism when a heart was led.
He won the first trick with the heart king, and led a trump, which brought the jack, queen and ace.

Anti-Americanism Critiques at Home and Abroad, 1965-1990 By Paul Hollander 515 pages.
Oxford University Press. $35.
After plowing through the thickets of a dense and depressing sociological tract titled "Anti-Americanism," the only good news is that the new year has nowhere to go but up.
It's an unwittingly anti-American book that is actually intended to be a defense of what the author considers to be the one true patriotic American way: his vision of a squeaky-clean, uncritical acceptance of the government and the country.


Kurt Masur in Leipzig: A Favorite Son at Home
His towering frame draped in baggy brown slacks and a gray shirt opened at the collar and not tucked in, Kurt Masur raised his arms and the Gewandhaus Orchestra stirred to life as though its genial music director had never been away.
It was his third visit to Leipzig, where he remains Kapellmeister, since assuming the directorship of the New York Philharmonic in September.
At the end of his 10 days here, he will have conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony three times, including on New Year's Eve, extending a tradition begun in December 1918 by a predecessor here, Arthur Nikisch, in the dark aftermath of World War I.


The Fear in Russian Eyes
Russia makes a perilous leap to markets today when it lifts price controls on nearly all consumer products.
Prices are expected to triple, or more, grinding millions of Russians -- those without a mountain of rubles stuffed under mattresses -- further into poverty.
No matter what preparations were in place, the leap wouldn't be easy or graceful.
But in Russia, virtually nothing is in place to absorb the shock: no sizable Western aid, no banking or taxation systems and no functioning safety net for those who will be crunched.
What makes the situation truly terrifying is that Russia is flying off on its own by launching economic and military reforms that could harm its neighbors.


Sony Official To Aiwa Unit
Akinobu Ishihara, an executive at the Sony Corporation in Japan, is moving from Tokyo to New Jersey to become the president and chief executive of Aiwa America Inc., the United States unit of the Aiwa Company, which is based in Japan.
In making the announcement on Tuesday, Aiwa said Mr.
Ishihara replaced Yukio Utsunomiya, who had joined Sony.
Mr.
Utsunomiya had been the president and chief executive at Aiwa since 1987.


Abroad at Home; He Let In The Light
Mikhail Gorbachev went out like the old year, unmourned.
There was a grudging quality to much of the comment when he resigned.
He was not a true democrat, the critics said.
He fumbled economic change.
He temporized, he wavered, he failed.
The criticism was even harsher at home.
Roy Medvedev, the anti-Stalinist Communist historian, said: "The country that was the Soviet Union in 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power was incomparably better, given all its deficiencies, than it is today."


Long-Stifled Dresden Debates Highway to Prague
Nearly 60 years after Hitler promised the people of eastern Germany a highway that would connect Dresden to Prague and points south, planning for the road is under way.
Government officials say the highway will boost Dresden's economy and provide a long-needed transit link for motorists and truck drivers.
But some of the city's residents are unconvinced.


Warring Yugoslavs Accept U.N. Plan
Croatia joined Serbia and the pro-Serb Yugoslav Army today in formally accepting a United Nations proposal for the possible deployment of an international peacekeeping force in war-ravaged regions of the breakaway Yugoslav republic.
Croatia's agreement to the peacekeeping plan has raised hopes that an end to full-scale warfare in Yugoslavia might be in sight.

For President, Help in Tokyo; Intent of the Japanese Is to Bolster a Friend
President Bush's trip to Japan next week has turned into a messy confrontation over trade and a major test for Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
But Japanese leaders also hope to make the trip at least look like a success for an American President viewed as a friend.
Aides to Mr.
Miyazawa were dismayed when domestic problems forced Mr.
Bush first to postpone his visit, originally scheduled for November, and then to take along 21 executives of the American automobile and other industries to demand greater access to Japanese markets.


PARENT &amp; CHILD
IT can be almost painful to watch very shy children, overwhelmed and tense, acutely aware of their vulnerabilities.
For many, timidity around new people is a temporary response to stresses at home.
For a few, it is a part of a larger set of anxieties and discomforts that may last a lifetime.
"The average person you meet is either shy, used to be shy, or is easily shy in certain situations," said Dr.
Philip Zimbardo, a professor of psychology at Stanford University and the author of "Shyness: What It Is, What to Do About It" (Addison Wesley, 1990; $6.95).
"Only about 10 percent of Americans say they've never felt shy."

Mary F. Rice, 89, Dies; A Catholic Educator
Mary Frances Rice, known as Sister Berenice of the Order of St.
Ursula, a retired faculty member and trustee of the College of New Rochelle, died on Sunday at the Marian Residence in New Rochelle, N.Y.
She was 89 years old.
Sister Berenice was a member of the Ursuline Convent of St.
Teresa, having entered the Ursuline Order in 1925.
Three years later, she became an English instructor at her alma mater in New Rochelle, an independent women's college founded by the order in 1904.
After earning a Ph.D. in psychology from Catholic University of America in 1938, she started the psychology department at New Rochelle and headed it from 1942 to 1967.


'Time for Her to Be at Rest'
As an agent for the New York City Department of Transportation, 20-year-old Dawn McCaine spent the last year placing tickets on the windshields of illegally parked cars.
But she often did so reluctantly, particularly during the Christmas season.
"She felt guilty," her sister Bernice recalled last evening, after Ms.
McCaine became the ninth victim to die from the stampede at a celebrity basketball event at City College on Saturday.
"Around the holidays she would never ticket cars near the supermarkets or churches or hospitals. She just wrote tickets elsewhere."


COLLEGE FOOTBALL: It's Election Day for Miami and Washington; Huskies Sit Back And Smell Roses With 12-0 Mark
With only the polling and the computing remaining, the University of Washington, No. 1 somewhere between the end of the Rose Bowl and the end of the night, made a convincing case for itself today with a 34-14 victory over Michigan.
"There's no question in my mind that we're No. 1 in the country," defensive tackle Steve Emtman said after the 78th Rose Bowl had ended.
"We proved that we can play with anybody, and we're 12-0."


SALVADOR ACCORD AIMS AT QUICK END TO LONG CIVIL WAR
The peace agreement reached early this morning by the Government of El Salvador and its guerrilla enemies will bring an almost immediate halt to their fighting and a final end to the 12 years of civil war there by autumn, rebel and Government officials said.
Diplomats said that the accord, wrapped up by Javier Perez de Cuellar in the final moments of his term as Secretary General of the United Nations, contains a number of points that have yet to be resolved, including details of the dismantling of the rebels' military structure and a comprehensive schedule for putting its various provisions into effect.
Signing Set for Jan. 16
Although the two sides have negotiated other incomplete agreements in the past, this time they devised a guarantee to back their categorical promise that a formal cease-fire would go into effect on Feb. 1.
The guarantee provides that if they fail to settle their remaining differences by Jan. 10, the United Nations would have the power to decide them.
In either case, they said, "final agreements of peace" will be signed in Mexico City on Jan. 16.

BUSINESS DIGEST
The Dissonant Messages of 1991
The stock market story of 1991 was one of prices that soared early in the year and again at the end, producing an excellent year for large stocks, and a phenomenal one for small stocks.
But the economy barely limped along, with the weakness returning in the summer and consumer confidence plunging to its lowest level in a decade.
Such a divergence suggests that something has to give, that either the economy will pick up soon or the stock market will have to surrender.
Some market bears even suggest that both could happen.

Indian Rebels Said to Be Based in Bangladesh
Pro-independence groups from northeastern India have set up bases and offices in neighboring Bangladesh and placed millions of dollars in banks to finance their insurgencies, especially in the state of Assam, Indian officials say.
The officials, citing intelligence information, said the United Liberation Front of Asom, the main guerrilla group in Assam, had established an office in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, a transit camp for rebels and three training and arms collection centers near the Indian border.


Essay; No 'Horror Show'
Put yourself in the shoes of an assignment editor for any of the news media today, as shoppers in Russia return to stores closed for the New Year's holiday.
You dispatch reporters to cover an inflationary horror show.
What Gorbachev had long flinched from doing, Boris Yeltsin has just dared to do: ended the state subsidies for most goods, removed the corrupt bureaucracy from the marketplace and opened the economy to the law of supply and demand.


Review/Film; Harsh Family Business In a Haunting Siberia
"The Second Circle" begins with a haunting, enigmatic image: a man walks along an empty, snowy road, struggling against the wind.
Suddenly he bends, as if kneeling in prayer, and slowly vanishes as snow fills the screen.
There is no sound except the wind, no sign of life except the radio tower that looms in the distance like a halfhearted joke about civilization.
As it turns out, this young man is heading to a Siberian village to bury his father, and the harsh, bone-chilling landscape he trudges across is the perfect introduction to this uncompromising, imagistic, masterly work by the Russian film maker Aleksandr Sokurov.


Higher Hurdles for Young Smokers
All anyone has to do to find out why young people need to be discouraged from smoking is to look at the adjacent chart.
It's about women and lung cancer and death.
Lung cancer usually takes 20 or so years to develop.
In the 1960's, not many women had been smoking that long, which is why their death rate from the disease was 23.9 per 100,000 from 1960 to 1964.
From 1982 to 1986, however, that sinister black bar stretched to 130.4 deaths -- and today more women succumb to cancer of the lung than of the breast.
Baby sure
has
come a long way.

Let Us Recognize Imprudence's Part in Contracting AIDS
To the Editor:
Randy Shilts in "Good AIDS, Bad AIDS" (Op-Ed, Dec. 10) states his concern for all disease victims.
He suggests that the only "wrong" committed by those who have contracted AIDS from dirty needles is that they were born black or Hispanic.
True, using contaminated needles is not "wrong," but it is imprudent.
The virtual banishing of this concept from our language enables Mr.
Shilts to imply that people who ignore medical warnings deserve our sympathy because they are helpless puppets -- for otherwise they would be criminals.


DISSONANT MESSAGES: Market Place; Can the Rally Endure Without a Recovery?
Rarely in the history of Wall Street has a year ended with such opposing messages coming from the stock market and the economy.
The stock market story of 1991 was one of prices that soared early in the year and again at the end, producing an excellent year for large stocks, and a phenomenal one for small stocks.
The Nasdaq composite index had its best year ever, rising 57 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20 percent.


Mixed Messages of '91


An Uncertain Outlook For Dollar's Rebound
As the new year begins, the dollar is falling, just like last year.
But analysts are not soon expecting a sudden and sharp rebound of the sort that occurred at the beginning of 1991.
In fact, some forecasts show the dollar falling to record lows against the German mark before it makes a modest recovery late in the year.
The latest jolt to the sagging dollar came the week before Christmas, when the Bundesbank raised German interest rates sharply and the Federal Reserve cut American interest rates sharply a day later.
By the end of the year, the dollar had lost almost all the ground it had gained against the mark and other European currencies in 1991 and had fallen against the yen as well.


For Many in the New York Region, The City Is Ignored and Irrelevant
Without quite noticing it, the New York area, home of the ultimate American city, has transformed itself into a sprawling, dispersed region that more than ever resembles Los Angeles, where a movie at the multiplex or a trip to Bridgewater Commons has become as much a day out as a journey to Lincoln Center or Herald Square.
In place of a "the-subway-can-get-me-there" attitude that survived the first moves to the suburbs from places like the Grand Concourse in the Bronx or Flatbush in Brooklyn, a new culture has taken hold.
Many residents in the ring of communities around the city never lived in the five boroughs, hardly ever visit the city and do not care much about what happens there.

Fifty sleep-away and day camps in the Northeast, including camps run by the Y, will be represented.
The second fair, featuring 45 private and agency-run camps in the Northeast, will be held on March 1 from 2 to 6 P.M.

Ringside Seat on Corporate Disasters
Harold D. Jones has had a front-row seat on the excesses of an era.

"Come January, we're going to get inundated because Christmas may not be so wonderful, and many retailers may fall in," he predicted in an interview last month.

India Seems Adrift in Changed World
Last August, when most of the world's leaders were rushing to denounce the hard-liners' coup in the Soviet Union, India's Prime Minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, declared that the coup was an instructive example of what happens to "over-enthusiastic reformers."
Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, and India's foreign policy as a whole, Boris N. Yeltsin crushed the plotters, resurrected Mikhail S. Gorbachev and began the final disassembling of the Soviet Union.
Since then, India has struggled to cope with the new landscape in the old Soviet Union and has begun to search for its own place in a world that is changing rapidly, in ways that have upset India's traditional assumptions.


Fatal Beating Is Changed From Bias-Related Crime
In an incident that the police at first classified as bias-related -- but later downgraded -- a black man died of head injuries Tuesday night, four days after he was beaten with a baseball bat and repeatedly kicked by five white men on a Queens street, the police said.
The sister of the victim said a friend who was with her brother at the time of the attack told her that the epithet "nigger" was shouted by one or more of the assailants before they attacked him and then chased him into the street in South Ozone Park, where they beat him again.


2 Charities for Poor Children Battle Over a Name
Usually occupied with helping the world's poorest children, a Connecticut-based charity has recently become embroiled in a nettlesome legal and public-relations battle over its own name.
Save the Children, a 60-year-old nonprofit organization with headquarters here, has become more than a little upset over a newer, increasingly well-financed group also dedicated to aiding impoverished children.
To defend its trademarked name and stave off what some organization officials say is an intentional effort to create public confusion about the two groups, Save the Children has sued the newer charity, Feed the Children, which is based in Oklahoma City, charging trademark infringement.


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS Czechs Reach Final  Karel Novacek and Helena Sukova combined for a mixed-doubles victory over Boris Becker and an ailing Steffi Graf last night, lifting Czechoslovakia to a 2-1 victory over Germany in the semifinals of the Hopman Cup at Perth, Australia.
The Czechoslovaks will face either Spain or Switzerland in the final tomorrow night.
Graf had a virus for the first two days of the event and defaulted from her singles match against Sukova with the players tied at one-set all.
Becker defeated Novacek, 6-2, 7-6 (7-1), to even the contest at 1-1 but the Czechoslovak pair won the doubles, 6-4, 6-4.
Graf's serve was broken once in each set of the doubles -- the only service breaks of the match. (AP) Steeb Advances: Sixth-seeded Carl-Uwe Steeb of Germany recovered from a slow start for a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Sandon Stolle of Australia yesterday in the second round of the Australian Hardcourt championship at Adelaide.

Shelton defeated Karsten Braasch of Germany, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, while left-hander Gilbert defeated Christo van Rensburg of South Africa, 6-4, 6-3.
Steeb can pass $1 million in career earnings if he wins the tournament. (AP) Ferreira Gains: Third-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South Africa eliminated the defending champion, Richard Fromberg of Australia, 7-6, (7-3), 7-5, yesterday in the first round of the BP Nationals at Wellington, New Zealand.

At Florist's, The Pot's The Thing
TOM PRITCHARD, an owner of Pure Madderlake, a high-style florist at 478 Broadway (Broome Street), had this "fun idea" -- a shallow terra-cotta bulb pan (2 1/4 inches high, $10) and a similar pan for azaleas (3 inches high, $12).
"We've always been fascinated with English orchid pots, but they are disappearing," said Mr.
Pritchard, speaking for the shop.
It is trying for "wonderfully misshapen" pots that look "old and loved." And the pots are numbered.
"That was my way of dealing with decoration," he said.

Croatia's Tudjman Is Really a Moderate
To the Editor:
I appreciate Anthony Lewis's insightful assessment of the war in Croatia in "The Killing Goes On" (column, Dec. 20).
However, he makes certain allegations concerning Croatia's president, Franjo Tudjman, that are unsupported, biased, and simply untrue when he states:


Supreme Court Case May Determine Fate of Thousands Seeking Asylum
Jairo Jonathan Elias Zacarias was 18 years old in January 1987 when two masked guerrillas armed with machine guns went to his parents' home in Guatemala at dusk, asked him to join their army and, when he refused, told him: "Piensalo bien," or, think it over well.
Several weeks later, with the equivalent of only $20 in his pocket, Mr.
Elias fled, making his way to Mexico and then toward the United States, sometimes sleeping outdoors and working for a few weeks to save money for the next bus ride.
He crossed the border near Nogales, Ariz., on July 12, 1987, and was immediately picked up by officers of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.


Foreign Affairs; Japan, Jobs and Baloney
President Bush says his trip to Japan next week is about "jobs, jobs, jobs."
But even to a tin ear that sounds like politics, politics, politics.


Review/Photography; The Faces and Lives Of Black Achievers
In 1932, at the age of 52, Carl Van Vechten gave up his career as a critic and novelist to photograph black American poets, writers, painters and performers.
He pursued this ambitious project until shortly before his death in 1964, recording a host of renowned figures, including Marian Anderson, James Baldwin, Romare Bearden, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright.
The marvelous exhibition "Oh, Write My Name," at the Manhattan East Gallery on the Upper East Side, presents 50 of Van Vechten's portraits in rich photogravure prints by the acclaimed printmaker Richard Benson.
Van Vechten made good use of a few stylistic elements to achieve a surprisingly wide range of expression in his pictures.
The portraits, photographed with a 35-millimeter camera, are all verticals and present the subjects framed from the waist up.
For most of the pictures, Van Vechten adopted the simple device of posing his subjects in front of distinctively patterned fabrics.
In one, a professorial W. C. Handy is shown in front of a star-spangled background, while the painter Jacob Lawrence appears in a picture from 1941 seated in front of a cloth printed in interlocking geometric forms.
No doubt this was practical, allowing him to take pictures in virtually any setting.
But it also gives the photographs both consistency and diversity, while not distracting from the main business of recording the appearance of the sitter.


Sparing a Dime, Whether They Agree or Not
During the morning rush hour yesterday at the Borough Hall subway station in Brooklyn, flames leaped from a trash bin fire that the station manager said probably was set by someone with a ravaged mind.
But to a grumbling commuter, John Beranbaum, a civil rights lawyer, the fire looked like a "subterranean protest" of the new $1.25 fare.
Already pinched for money from the holidays and the recession, New Yorkers returned to the subways and buses yesterday to encounter a fare increase that had them waiting in longer-than-usual lines and digging into pockets for an extra dime.
The fare increase provoked a range of emotions, from indifference to peevish resignation.


Yields of Money Funds Post A Mixed Showing for Week
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended Tuesday.
Assets of taxable funds declined sharply in the same period, as investors sought higher interest elsewhere.
Tax-exempt money fund yields moved up smartly in the latest week.
The rise in yields was attributed to a combination of seasonal factors and, to some extent, a dwindling demand for money market funds.


Study Criticizes U.S. Deal On Sale of Bailout Property
A Congressional report released today said that a deal the Bush Administration had called a model for disposing of savings and loan properties in bulk was wasteful, uncompetitive and plagued by financial uncertainties.
The report, by the staff of a House Banking subcommittee, covers the discount sale, announced in August, of hundreds of millions of dollars of office buildings and hotels to Patriot American Investors L.P., a newly formed group of Canadian and American investors.


Man Indicted in Killing Of U.S. Judge in 1989
A state grand jury has indicted Walter Leroy Moody Jr. on capital murder charges in the 1989 mail-bomb slaying of a Federal judge, a prosecutor said today.
Mr.
Moody, a 58-year-old resident of Rex, Ga., could be sentenced to death if convicted.
He is already serving seven life terms plus 400 years for Federal convictions last year in the December 1989 slayings of a United States Circuit Court Judge, Robert Vance, and Robert E. Robinson, a civil rights lawyer in Savannah, Ga.


Long-Term Issues Plunge Sharply
The new year began on a somewhat sour note in the credit markets yesterday, as prices of longer-dated notes and bonds fell fairly sharply, and interest rates rose.
The selloff took place despite the release of more dispiriting news about the economy, the type of information that market participants normally like to see.


Why Did It Have to Take 'J.F.K.' to Wake Us?; Raises Suspicions

Yanks Closing In On Trade of Sax
The Yankees were on the verge last night of making their first significant trade in almost 18 months, a deal that would send Steve Sax, their only .300 hitter last season, to the Chicago White Sox.
In return, a source familiar with the talks between the teams said, the Yankees would acquire pitcher Melido Perez, and free up second base for the younger Pat Kelly, as well as at least $2 million on the payroll.


NBC Handles a Lost-Feed Frenzy
The best that can be said for NBC's 15-minute power outage during the Orange Bowl game Wednesday night is that it's lucky Miami had the game won handily.
It was 22-0 when power lines from the Orange Bowl to the NBC mobile truck burned out and 22-0 when power was restored and the game's video and audio returned intact.

Felicja Blumental, a Polish-born Brazilian pianist who was known for her performances of 19th-century rarities and music by contemporary composers, died on Tuesday in Tel Aviv, where she was attending a recital by her daughter, Annette Celine Blumental, a soprano.
She was 80 years old and lived in Monte Carlo.
She died of heart failure, said her husband, Markus Mizne.


O'Connor Pledges to Assist Lebanese in the Rebuilding
John Cardinal O'Connor, Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, met today with top officials of the Lebanese Government and pledged a church charity to rebuilding one room in every house demolished in 16 years of civil war.
Emphasizing that his three-day visit to this country is a humanitarian mission, Cardinal O'Connor told reporters he was particularly concerned over the suffering of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese who had been driven out of their homes during the war.


New Campaigns
*
The latest radio commercials for TDK recording tapes often do not sound much different from the rock songs that precede and follow them.
The 60-second spots feature 50 seconds of uninterrupted music from new bands, like Pale Divine and Five Thirty, before a voice-over announcer begins promoting TDK tapes.
Lord, Dentsu &amp; Partners created the spots, which continue to use the tagline "TDK. As Serious As You Can Get."


Wife of California Schools Chief Quits Project Under Investigation
The wife of the California schools chief resigned today as head of an educational consulting program that is under investigation by the state and Federal authorities.
The woman, Nancy Honig, said in a statement that she resigned from the program in the hope that questions over her involvement would not further affect it or her husband, Bill Honig, who is the Superintendent of Public Instruction.


Frogs Get a Leader
Former Heisman Trophy winner PAT SULLIVAN became head coach at Texas Christian yesterday and vowed to guide the Horned Frogs to the Cotton Bowl.


Once Again, Penguins Are Just Sitting Ducks
The first strong indication the Devils were ready for a big game tonight was when they limited the Pittsburgh Penguins, the defending Stanley Cup champion, to one shot in the first period.
When they killed a five-minute major penalty to Slava Fetisov against Mario Lemieux and friends late in the second period, the Devils were clearly on their way.
Their destination turned out to be a 4-0 victory over Pittsburgh at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, the second in three nights over the Penguins (25-15-1).


Chadian Insurgents Claim Capture of 2 Towns

The Russian Tea Room, like the Soviet Government before it collapsed, has been propped up by legends and energetic public relations, but beneath all the hype there is little substance.
One wants to love the Russian Tea Room.
It is a festive New York City institution that glitters like a Christmas tree and has the aura of important people discussing important issues.
It's a shame that the pallid, overpriced food reduces it to a tourist trap.

Lothar Baumgarten 'Carbon'  Marian Goodman Gallery 24 West 57th Street Through Jan. 18
The German artist Lothar Baumgarten here turns his attention from the native peoples he has celebrated in earlier work to industrial America, symbolized by the railroad.
In large black-and-white photographs that recall the work of Robert Adams and Lewis Baltz, Mr.
Baumgarten undertakes a sort of poetic archeology of industrial forms in the American landscape.


Excerpts From Mayor's Speech: A Vision of a City
Following are excerpts from yesterday's State of the City address by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
We have just ended another very difficult year, as life proved to be a little harder, a little harsher than the year before.
It has been a year that began with the threat of war abroad and that concluded with tragedy and injustice here at home, as nine promising young people were taken from us so cruelly in a stairwell at City College. . . .

Australia's Focus, Like Bush's, Is Tokyo
President Bush wound up a three-day visit to Australia today, having proved his will to keep the United States in a strong position in Asia, but failing to dispel a gnawing fear that he lacks the means to do so.
Just as in Washington, Australian officials said today, the worries here center on Japan, whose growing influence the United States seems hard pressed to balance, much less channel to its own benefit.


CUNY Officials Review City College Leadership
Several officials and trustees of the City University of New York said yesterday that they are reviewing the leadership of City College after an extraordinarily troubled year.
Marred by a three-week student strike and a storm of criticism over racially charged remarks by professors, the year ended with the deaths of nine young people who were crushed outside a campus gymnasium last Saturday.
A major focus of the review is what some officials say has been the lax oversight by college officials of student groups and activities, including the Evening Student Government.
Members of that student organization contracted with professional rap promoters to put on a basketball game that featured a host of rap stars and drew twice as many people as the 2,700-seat gymnasium holds.


Samuelson Shifts Her Sights to 10,000
JOAN BENOIT SAMUELSON has decided not to compete with herself -- that is the runner she was when she won the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984.
Instead of trying for a place on this year's United States marathon team, she will seek a spot with the 10,000-meter contingent.
"On paper, I may look better in the marathon," said Samuelson, who has been bedridden with the flu this week, "but I'm more eager and excited to run the 10,000."


Books of The Times; Life in a Country Where Nothing Works Out
Sleepwalker in a Fog  By Tatyana Tolstaya  192 Pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $19.
For Tatyana Tolstaya's characters, everything about daily life in the former Soviet Union seems "shopworn, squalid, fifth-rate, with cavities and defects, abscesses and flaws." Good apartments, good jobs, good food -- and as far as the women are concerned, even good men -- are hard to find.
Faced with little prospect of bettering their real lives, they indulge in wistful daydreams about the long-lost past and rhapsodic fantasies about an impossible future.


Man Arrested Is Linked to Long List of Robberies
To get into his victims' apartments in a poor Bronx neighborhood, he posed as a building superintendent, and once inside, the police say, he would use a gun and a threat to kill their children to rob his victims.
Yesterday, a man coming out of a building in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, where there had just been such a robbery, was arrested and linked to a long list of crimes.


YUGOSLAV FACTIONS AGREE TO U.N. PLAN TO HALT CIVIL WAR
Leaders of the Serbian-led Yugoslav Army and the Croatian National Guard pledged today to cease hostilities on Friday, raising hopes that United Nations peacekeeping forces could be deployed to separate the warring factions in Yugoslavia.
The accord, reached in Sarajevo during four hours of negotiations led by Cyrus R. Vance, the United Nations Special Envoy, says, "Each party agrees to the complete cessation of all hostile military activity on land, at sea and in the air." The cease-fire is to take effect by 6 P.M. local time (noon, Eastern time).


A Corner of Middle Europe Where Empires Mean Little
Ukraine begins on the other side of a border pole here that thrusts across a road and makes cars pull up short.

UConn Wallops Miami
If the sport was football, Connecticut would be hard pressed to stay even with Miami for five minutes.
But it was basketball at Gampel Pavilion tonight, and the Hurricanes from Miami were never even with the unbeaten Huskies, who registered their ninth victory of the season, 85-62.
The defeat was the sixth in 11 games for Miami, which made its basketball debut in the Big East Conference.
The Hurricane basketball program was swept into the conference along with some lesser sports last year as an afterthought to the fancy football team, which was seen as the keystone to the Big East's ambitious plans for a football conference.


In Rural New York City, Where Wild Things Are
THERE'S a quiet to a winter woods that can bring subtle surprises to visitors who walk softly.
A light snow had blanketed the forest in Pelham Bay Park in the northeast Bronx recently and there, to the observant eye, were tracks of sparrow, pheasant, squirrel and muskrat.
The muskrat's paws had left four prints in the snow, shaped much like human hands, and its tail had carved a knifelike line right up the middle.

Without Werdann, Redmen Pull Together
The starting center was on the bench in street clothes tonight, and he watched his St.
John's teammates beat Villanova and come up with something new this season -- 40 quality minutes from the center position.
With Robert Werdann sidelined because of a pulled muscle in his right calf, St.
John's seemed uncharacteristically aggressive and creative underneath the offensive glass.
The result was a 79-69 road victory for the Redmen at DuPont Pavilion.


A Leisured Stay In the Lap of Luxury
IT was condition orange, shading to red.
The room-service waiter at the Essex House was on his knees trying to free a tricky latch on the rolling breakfast table and remove its portable heating unit.
But the thing wouldn't budge.
He looked up, stricken, and said, "Oh, sir, I know, I am taking too long." The genuine anguish in his voice made it clear that I would be well within my rights to horsewhip him on the spot.
And I wondered: What sadist is in charge of the hotel's training program?
After a 20-month renovation costing more than $75 million, the Essex House on Central Park South has thrown open its doors.
Once familiar to television viewers as the hotel where "Saturday Night Live" parked its guests, it was bought by Nikko Hotels International, a subsidiary of Japan Airlines, in 1985.
In 1989, the company began a total overhaul of the 60-year-old hotel that has left only the Art Deco elevator doors intact.
The reborn Essex House has new plumbing, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, a new look (sumptuous and marbled), fewer and larger rooms and standards of service so high that the lesser staff walks in fear.


Study on Breast Cancer Finds Therapy Is Effective for Years
In findings that have startled even the most optimistic experts, the largest analysis of breast cancer patients ever conducted shows that the life-saving benefits of widely used hormone or drug treatments prevail for at least 10 years, long after therapy has ended.
The difference in breast cancer recurrence and death rates actually continued to increase several years after even relatively brief treatment had ended, the analysis showed.
Benefits of the synthetic hormone, tamoxifen, or a combination of drugs in chemotherapy were even more striking in the second five-year period than in the first.


New Measure Will Punish Fraud in Car Registration
New Yorkers and other out-of-staters who try to beat high automobile-insurance rates by falsely registering their cars in New Jersey will face stiff fines -- up to $15,000 -- under a bill signed into law today by Gov.
Jim Florio.
The new law makes it a violation of the state's Fraud Prevention Act for any out-of-state motorist to misrepresent his legal residence in applying for automobile insurance.
First offenders can be fined $5,000, a second offense is subject to a fine of $10,000, and third and subsequent offenses, $15,000.


United Telecom to Buy GTE's Stake in Sprint
United Telecommunications Inc., which owns 80.1 percent of U S Sprint, said yesterday that it planned to buy the remaining 19.9 percent from the GTE Corporation for $530 million.
The purchase, which had been widely expected, caps United Telecom's takeover of the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier, created through the merger of the two companies' long-distance units in 1986.
United Telecom bought an additional 30.1 percent stake from GTE in 1989.


Windfalls Offer a Chance to Give to the Neediest, and to Reflect
At a time when many New Yorkers are defining luck as a steady paycheck, sudden windfalls can be occasions for sober reflection, say contributors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"Last year my husband found a small white change purse on the floor of his taxi," wrote Susan Hermanson of Manhattan, who gave $100.
"We have tried off and on over the months to get through the bureaucracy of the Taxi and Limousine Commission to see if anything like that had been reported missing. Since I am at last giving up, I thought at least that money could be put to some better use than some of our more trivial household expenses."


Texans Fear New Rains Could Worsen Flooding


Upjohn Turns to Women To Increase Rogaine Sales
HAVING learned in selling Rogaine to men that the prescription hair-loss treatment does not sell itself, the Upjohn Company is planning an aggressive advertising campaign to market the product to women.
Beginning Monday, television commercials and print advertisements by Klemtner Advertising Inc. in New York will address women worried about baldness in the same direct, assertive tones that have infused the agency's ads aimed at men for the last two years.
That contrasts dramatically with the initial, almost passive approach taken in the campaign for Rogaine, Upjohn's brand name for its 2 percent solution of the drug minoxidil.


Frank Carrington, 55, Victims' Rights Lawyer
Frank G. Carrington, a lawyer who served on a Presidential panel that advocated victims' rights, died in a fire yesterday at his home in Virginia Beach, Va.
He was 55.
Mr.

In 1981 he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the Task Force on Victims of Crime.
In April 1991, he was honored by President Bush for "outstanding service on behalf of crime victims."

Improvising That Evokes New Orleans
New Orleans polyphony -- the shouting, honking and howling sound of a marching band's horns intermeshed with drumming -- is one of America's great contributions to music in the 20th century.
Listening to a full band joyously improvising is an ecstatic -- and increasingly rare -- experience.
Much of the polyphony now being played in New Orleans, mostly for tourists, is but a sad shadow of the original music.
But New Yorkers have a chance to hear true, traditional polyphony in all its raw beauty this weekend at the Village Vanguard.
The New Orleans clarinetist Michael White will be leading his Original Liberty Jazz Band, a septet that, for a few sets at least, may include the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.


Purchasers Index Drops Sharply
The nation's industrial economy, stalled by declining orders and lower production, contracted in December for the third consecutive month, to its lowest level since May, the nation's purchasing managers said yesterday.
The report was the first significant indication of the state of the economy last month.
The survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management came as the Government reported that construction spending slowed in November and the nation's auto makers said their sales remained weak in mid-December.
The Labor Department said that first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell during the third week in December, but economists noted that they were still at a recessionary level.
Reading Indicates Contraction
The association's monthly survey, conducted with more than 300 purchasing managers from a wide range of industrial companies, put its main index of economic activity at 46.5 percent in December, down from 50.1 percent in November.
The association said the last reading below 50 percent was in May, when it was 45.4.
A reading below 50 percent indicates that the economy is contracting while a reading above 50 percent indicates expansion.

Bush Signals He's Prepared For Tough Campaign in '92
Acknowledging that it will be "very difficult" to get re-elected without an economic recovery, President Bush says he is girding for a "dog-eat-dog fight" in the campaign and will do whatever it takes to win.
In an interview with David Frost that is to be broadcast Friday night by the Public Broadcasting Service (9 o'clock Eastern standard time, and on Channels 13 and 49 in the New York area), Mr.
Bush tried to project confidence about the economy, citing predictions that it would recover by July.


Preliminary 1991 Figures Show Drop in Homicides
After seeming most of the year to be headed toward another record number of murders, New York City may have had fewer homicides in 1991 than in 1990, the first decline in the city in six years, according to preliminary figures gathered by the Police Department.
At the same time, The Associated Press reported that three of the nation's 10 largest cities -- San Diego, Dallas and Phoenix -- set homicide records in 1991, and in a fourth city, Los Angeles, it seemed almost certain that a record was broken, although year-end statistics were not available yesterday.
Several smaller cities also set records, according to the A.P. report.


Who Won in Salvador? Everyone
After 11 years, El Salvador's Government and guerrilla armies have at last agreed to end a war neither can win in exchange for a peace from which both can gain.
The Government won a chance to turn its energies from killing to development, along with good prospects for foreign aid in reconstruction.
The guerrillas won an official commitment to economic, social and political reforms, along with an opportunity for their fighters to return, safely, to normal pursuits.


3 BOMBS SET OFF IN SOUTH AFRICA
The bombings of three public buildings in different Transvaal towns in the first days of 1992 have raised concern that white militants are embarking on a violent campaign of resistance to the dismantling of apartheid undertaken by President F. W. de Klerk.
Early today, bombs severely damaged post offices in Verwoerdburg, south of Pretoria, and Krugersdorp, west of Johannesburg.
The powerful blasts, which occurred about 2:10 A.M. in Verwoerdburg and 3:15 P.M. in Krugersdorp, gutted both post offices and shattered nearby windows.


Hertz Imposing Stiff Surcharges On New Yorkers
The Hertz Corporation effectively withdrew from a large part of the New York City car-rental market yesterday, announcing that it would impose surcharges of $15 to $56 a day on residents of Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx who rent cars anywhere in the metropolitan region.
A surcharge of $3 would be added for Manhattan residents, with no extra charge for Staten Island residents.


Files of East German Secret Police Are Opened but Few Seek Access
The secret police files kept on eastern Germans by their former Communist Government were formally opened for public inspection today, but the storm of interest that many had predicted failed to materialize.
Only a trickle of people, mainly artists, writers and human rights campaigners, showed up at the gray stone building in Berlin that houses the agency responsible for granting access to the files, which were kept by the former East German secret police, known as the Stasi.

When It Comes to Championships, Miami Has Gotten Very Defensive
They have been called many things in the last nine years.
But as succeeding generations of Miami Hurricanes have constructed one of the most successful stretches in the history of college football, they might now just have to be considered trendsetters.
"The last couple of years, a lot of people have been trying to emulate what we're doing defensively," said Miami Coach Dennis Erickson after the 22-0 Orange Bowl victory over Nebraska that left the Hurricanes with another unofficial national title.
The final No. 1 ranking in The Associated Press poll of writers and broadcasters and The New York Times' computer rankings gives Miami its fourth title in the past nine years.


Vehicle Sales Weak Again In Midmonth
Sales of cars and light trucks built in the United States remained weak in mid-December, a historically slow period in the automobile industry.
Although auto makers said today that they had posted a slight gain of four-tenths of a percent over last year, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.2 million cars was the lowest since the comparable period last year.
"With few exceptions, this was a poor showing," said Tom Webb, the chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, a leading industry group.
Underreporting Results
But Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco, said the sales figures were artificially low in mid-December because Chevrolet and Ford underreported sales of pickup trucks.
He said they were likely to bunch sales in the final 10 days of December as a competitive move.
Those results are to be announced on Monday.


No Liability Insurance at Game That Led to the Deaths of 9
Blame for the charity basketball game at which nine people were fatally crushed at City College last weekend went around and around again yesterday amid disclosures that the event was produced with an unusual contract, with no liability insurance and with a budget that spent far more on promotion than on security.
Lawyers for the promoters and officials of the City University said that the brief contract to produce the event made a student group responsible for what proved to be inadequate security; made promoters responsible for insurance that was never obtained, and did not include the college -- ordinarily responsible for all events on campus -- even as a party to the agreement.


New York City Wants State To Take Back Two Prisons
Four years after New York City bought two prisons from the state for $113 million to ease crowding in city jails, the city now wants the state to take back the prisons.
City officials say that if the state did so, then both the state and the city could ease crowding in their penal systems by allowing the state to speed up the transfers of 2,500 state inmates from city jails.
At the same time, selling the two prisons -- at Cape Vincent and Ogdensburg near the Canadian border -- to the state would give the city an instant infusion of money and would save the city $2 million a year, the cost of transporting inmates to and from the prisons.


DINKINS PROPOSES EFFORTS TO ROUSE NEW YORK ECONOMY
In a broad, hopeful speech intended to build new confidence in his ability to lead New York City through hard economic times, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced measures yesterday to stimulate the city's sagging economy and to ease the burdens of residents and businesses hit hard by the recession.
Mr.
Dinkins's second State of the City address, at the midpoint of his term, was studded with a mixture of ambitious ideas and simple gestures, some of which have been previously proposed, and he did not say how he would pay for his plans.
The proposals include speeding payments to companies that do business with the city, pushing capital rebuilding projects ahead of schedule, freezing property-tax increases and reducing licensing rules and fees to aid small businesses.

'Casual Ceremony'  White Columns 154 Christopher Street West Village Through Jan. 13
This group exhibition at White Columns, an alternative space dedicated to the work of young and unknown artists, is especially good.
It focuses on that famous gap between art and life, an interval that emerging artists find as fascinating today as their counterparts did in the early 1970's, when Post-Minimalism and Process Art were the rage.


Longtime Executives Are Promoted by G.E.
Glen H. Hiner's recent decision to leave General Electric's plastics business to become chief executive at Owens-Corning Fiberglas has produced quick benefits for two longtime G.E. executives: Yesterday the company named Gary L. Rogers to take over as head of the $5 billion plastics business and J. Richard Stonesifer to take Mr.
Rogers's place as head of the appliance business.
By moving to plastics, the 47-year-old Mr.
Rogers gets a chance to add to his credentials as one of a handful of General Electric Company executives in the running to succeed John F. Welch Jr., 56, as chief executive one day.
Mr.
Welch yesterday called him "one of the great young leaders" at the company.

Evelyn Hofer  Witkin Gallery 415 West Broadway (near Spring Street) SoHo Through Jan. 18
Evelyn Hofer, known for her handsome photographic portrayals of cities ranging from Florence to Dublin, here focuses on the residents of Soglio, a small village in the Ticino region of Switzerland near the town where Ms.
Hofer spends her summers.
A single image sets the scene: a handful of white houses perched on a hillside beneath a row of towering mountains.
The rest of the pictures in the show present the people of Soglio in simply lighted and posed black-and-white portraits.


Market Place; A Very Stingy Year for Dividends
The year just ended was in some ways the worst on record in terms of dividend actions, with fewer companies providing good news for shareholders than at any time since comparable figures began to be compiled in 1955, the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation reported yesterday.
Nonetheless, the year ended with some limited signs of revival.
In December, as in two of the previous three months, more companies announced dividend increases than had done so in the comparable month of 1990.
That provided some hope that the decline in corporate profits might be about to end.
Fewest Increases on Record
The poor overall dividend figures reflected the recession and the cash-flow problems that have hit many companies burdened by debts left over from the 1980's and hurt by a slowdown in sales.


ALGIERS MARCHERS OPPOSE MILITANTS
A crowd estimated to number at least 135,000 people demonstrated in Algiers today against the Islamic fundamentalist movement, which won handily in the first round of parliamentary elections last week.
Today's march was the first public reaction by dozens of anti-fundamentalist groups and political parties to the elections, in which the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front triumphed over 48 other parties.
Results of the country's first free elections gave the Islamic Front 188 seats, just 28 short of a majority in the 430-member Parliament.
The next round of elections, pitting the top two vote-getters in districts where no candidate received a majority in the first round, is scheduled for Jan. 16.
Candidates of the Islamic Front are reported leading in at least 150 of the 199 districts that remain to be decided.
According to final official results of the first round of elections, announced only in the last 24 hours, the Front for Socialist Forces, a secularist party with a strong base in the Berber tribal Kabylia region, was a distant second to the Islamic Front with 25 seats, while the National Liberation Front, which led Algeria to independence from France in 1962 and has governed ever since, won only 15 seats.
Call for Election Halt
Organizers of the march, including the country's largest workers' union and several women's associations and secularist parties, estimated that one million people took part.
Journalists in Algiers, a city of about three million, estimated the crowd size at 200,000, and the police estimate was 135,000.
A growing number of groups, including the sponsors of today's rally, are demanding cancellation of the second round of the elections.
Calls for something to stop the fundamentalist victory have also been heard from the independent press, which has sprouted over the last two years since Algeria introduced multi-party democracy.
The inclusion of representatives of the largest workers' syndicate, the General Union of Algerian Workers, was seen as a significant development since its members work in key industrial and governmental sectors including the oil industry.
The union is widely viewed as hostile to fundamentalists.
In June it resisted a strike call by the Islamic Front.
Some secularist leaders have called for general strikes to paralyze the country.
The leader of the Assembly for Democracy and Culture, a largely Berber and intensely secularist party that was eliminated in the elections, called in a news conference on Wednesday for "a democratic holy war" against the fundamentalists. 'People Want Radical Change'
But Hocine Ait-Ahmed, the leader of the Front for Socialist Forces, and senior National Front officials asserted today that they were opposed to any Government interference in the democratic process.
"Our people want a radical change," Mr.
Ait-Ahmed told the French newspaper Liberation in an interview.
"A democratic crisis can be settled only by more democracy."
Several senior Algerian Government officials said in telephone interviews over the last two days that they doubted that the Government would cancel the elections.
"We can't really do anything of the sort," said a Cabinet minister who asked not to be identified, adding that any such action "would simply push the problems aside for a while and may provoke acts of violence that are more grave than the results we are facing now."
The official said there was "still a ray of hope" that the Islamic Front could be prevented from getting 287 seats, a two-thirds majority that would give the fundamentalists the power to change Algeria's Constitution.

'Viennese Graphic Design: From Secession to Expressionism'  Galerie St.
Etienne 24 West 57th Street Through Jan. 11
In turn-of-the-century Vienna, as in other cultural capitals of Europe, modern art could mean a return to basics on several, sometimes conflicting, fronts.
It could mean a disdaining of ornament in favor of clean, simplified forms and designs, or a love of deftly stylized patterns derived from nature.
It could mean a revival of handwork techniques or folkloric subjects shunted aside by the Industrial Revolution, as well as an unprecedented sexual frankness and emotional openness.
And in Vienna, as elsewhere, the modern period was also a time when many artists, rather than devoting themselves exclusively to painting and sculpture, were rethinking the outward appearances of nearly everything, whether buildings or playing cards, clothing or typefaces for books and posters.


West Acts to Defer Issue of New U.N. Council Seats
By allowing Russia to take over the Soviet Union's permanent Security Council seat last week, the three Western powers believe that they have postponed action for several years on demands by Germany, Japan and several large third world countries for permanent membership on the Council.
Diplomats now say a consensus is forming that the United Nations should not give serious consideration to reviewing the privileged position of the five World War II victors, who hold permanent Security Council seats and a veto over its decisions, before the middle of this decade.

Knicks Shoulda Stayed in Bed
The Knicks, the Charlotte Hornets and the Houston Rockets were fined $10,000 apiece by the National Basketball Association yesterday for practicing on New Year's Day and were prohibited from holding practices or team meetings today.
The New Year's Day practices violated the league's collective bargaining agreement, which prohibits teams at home from practicing on Christmas Day or New Year's Day.
It is not unusual for teams to ignore this rule, but when the league became aware of these most recent violations, it decided to enforce it.


Cut the Football in Half: There Are Two No. 1's
So now that college football's coronation committee will have to spring for two crowns, now that Miami and Washington can stay in not-so-neutral corners of the continental United States with 12-0 records, what points are left to argue?
Miami's Hurricanes and Washington's Huskies, after ending perfect seasons with convincing bowl-game victories, sounded satisfied today to share an unofficial but exhausting championship.
At the point in the season reserved for embraces and index fingers extended in the air, no one seemed to mind settling for a split.


Sports of The Times; Hurricanes Would Win In Public
PAT ENGELBERT, who has a 3.587 grade- point average and something like a size-18 neck, also has a proposal.
He is tired of national champions enhancing their reputations by whupping on his team, and he would like them to settle things on their own.
Engelbert, the nose tackle for Nebraska, wishes Miami and Washington would just go off somewhere and play a football game.


What's the Price? Russians Risk Shock
All through the day, people shuffled into Products Store No. 18, stamped the snow off their boots onto a muddy rag and wandered over to glance at the lone, scrawny chicken lying in a battered enamel tub in the "Meats" case.
A penciled price tag over the chicken read "36," and most people needed no further information.
Among these tenements hard by the decrepit Hammer and Sickle metallurgical works, residents spend a tidy piece of their lives scouring stores and standing in lines for basic sustenance, so their instincts are well developed.

Topics of The Times; Times Square, the Morning After
Times Square takes some of its charm from being unkempt.
There's a limit, though, and it's exceeded in the extreme by the litter from New Year's Eve.
But, presto!
When New Yorkers returned to the regular grind yesterday morning, the spot where thousands cheered the New Year was immaculate.
Well, not quite.
But thanks to a double-blitz by clean-up crews, it was noticeably cleaner than it is on Mondays after an ordinary weekend, which New Year's assuredly is not.
The coordinated blitz was the work of the city's Sanitation Department and the new Times Square Business Improvement District.


A Therapist Finds His Own Passion and Therapy
HE looks exactly as a psychia trist should tall, bearded and deep-voiced with the slightest European accent.
He sits attentively, long fingers wrapped around his chin, in a quiet, clockless office steeped in wood grains, books and stale grief.
The room is furnished with the usual couch, the ceiling well-worn from countless stares and, nearby, the requisite box of tissues.
The man's sentences are uh-free and as tidy as his desk.
"Why should it surprise you?" asks Dr.
Theodore Cherbuliez.
And the mind of his current appointment scans recent dreams for a satisfactory answer, in vain.
A shrug of stupidity must suffice.

TV Weekend; How Ray Charles Became Ray Charles
The voice is as familiar as Sinatra's or Pavarotti's.
The face, wrapped in dark glasses, has taken on a life of its own, whether in concert performances or advertisements selling soft drinks or credit cards.
According to "Ray Charles: The Genius of Soul," an "American Masters" special on Channels 13 and 49 tonight at 10, the man has become "a national treasure." This time around, that overused label is not an exaggeration.
Written, directed and narrated by Yvonne Smith, the documentary manages to celebrate a legendary performer without ignoring some of the more uncomfortable facts about his life.
Mr.
Charles had severe drug problems in the 1950's and 60's. ("Flying higher in his career required more fuel to keep going," Ms. Smith says.) He managed to kick a heroin habit but, as Ms.
Smith puts it, he continued to pursue women "with equal passion," having nine children with seven women between 1950 and 1976.
The joke among backup singers auditioning for his band was that "in order to be a Raelette, you had to let Ray." His wife of 23 years divorced him in 1977.

Dinkins as a Populist: Hearing 'Our People'
Mayor David N. Dinkins's speech on the state of New York City was not so much a summary of the present as a political summons to the future, aimed at assuring restive supporters that he would not abandon the poor to balance the budget, even as he pledged new efforts to appease the middle class.
The Mayor's speech, delivered at the midpoint of his term with his popularity low and his electoral coalition shaken, was less a public report card than the product of having assessed his prospects in private and found them wanting.
In forceful and unusually blunt tones, he unleashed what many in the invited audience of city officials and supporters said was the opening salvo of his re-election campaign.

Israel Expelling 12 Arabs; P.L.O. Warns About Talks
A day after a Jewish settler was shot to death in the Gaza Strip, Israel said on Thursday night that it would expel from the occupied territories 12 Palestinians whom it accused of terrorist involvement.
The action, taken by Defense Minister Moshe Arens, was apparently aimed at placating angry settlers who had put pressure on the Government to adopt stern anti-Arab measures after fatal ambush attacks on four of their number in the last 10 weeks.


TV Weekend; A Time Capsule's Messages to Posterity
"The Class of the 20th Century," the 12-part series that begins on Sunday at 8 P.M. on the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network, is billed as "a kaleidoscopic view of the 20th century, as seen through the eyes of people who helped shape it." The agglomeration is to be stored in the Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan for anyone extant in the year 3000 who might like to know what things were like back now.
The series turns out to be an anthology of anecdotes, mainly from American show-business figures and television personalities, along with a smattering of well-known journalists, politicians and random celebrities.
It will be of particular interest to contemporaries who care about the ruminations of Hugh Downs, Howard Cosell and Hildegarde.

Emmitt Smith of the Cowboys finished the season as the National Football League's leading rusher, while the Lions' Barry Sanders finished second.


Peat Partner Is Named S.E.C.'s Top Accountant
Walter P. Schuetze, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, was appointed yesterday to be the chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The job, considered among the most prestigious accounting positions in Government, had been vacant for a year after the departure last January of Edmund Coulson, who left after three years in the position to join Ernst &amp; Young.
It had been temporarily filled by George Diacont, an associate chief accountant, who said he would stay on as one of Mr.
Schuetze's top aides.


At Victims' Funerals, Disbelief and Anger
Disbelief, with an undercurrent of anger, hung over a funeral and a wake for two young people who died at City College on Saturday, as friends and family gathered yesterday to mourn deaths they said were as senseless as they were unexpected.
"This is horrible," said Alise J. Hannah, a 76-year-old retired nurse's aide, as she leaned on her cane a few feet away from the open casket of a young man she had known for all 24 years of his life, Yul C. Dargan.
"I feel such pity for him."


Jacques Aubuchon, 67, an Actor In Movies, Plays and TV Dramas
Jacques Aubuchon, an actor who appeared in more than 20 feature films, 300 television dramas and 10 Broadway plays, died on Saturday at his home in Woodland Hills, Calif.
He was 67 years old.
He died of heart failure, said his daughter-in-law, Joanna Lipari Aubuchon.


Parcells Not Done Talking
Bill Parcells has met with his friend, Ron Wolf, the Green Bay Packers' new general manager, to discuss the Packers' coaching vacancy.
They will talk again this weekend, but there is no indication that Parcells will take the job, assuming it is offered.
The meeting took place on Wednesday in New Jersey.
In a statement released by his office yesterday, Wolf said: "We had a preliminary discussion. A contract was not offered."
Parcells said: "I met with him. No job was offered. We discussed the parameters of the job, and I have an understanding of what the job is."


For Children
A walk through lower Manhattan requires little energy or money.
Just start at Broadway and Fulton Street and head straight down to Battery Park City, where the fog rolls in and settles on a normal January day.
At the park is a handsome enclosed playground.
George Washington's Pew St.
Paul's Chapel Broadway at Fulton Street (212) 602-0847
The day George Washington was inaugurated as President, April 30, 1789, he attended a special service at St.
Paul's Chapel and sat in a private pew.
The present one is a modified version of the original, which had high walls, a canopy and foot warmers with coals.
Children can sit in the pew on the 18th-century-style blue damask high-back chair and ruminate on the perils of being America's first President.


Money Fund Assets Off
The assets of the nation's 585 money market mutual funds decreased by $21.28 billion, to $457.76 billion, in the week that ended on Tuesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.

COMPANIES
The results of the holiday selling season began trickling out, with most results in line with analysts' expectations.
But Toys "R" Us reported better-than-expected sales gains, causing a stampede among investors to buy its stock, which gained $2.
Venture Stores and Caldor reported sales results that were more in line with expectations.  [ Page D1. ]

Richter Gets Decision In Battle of the Goalies
Here, at Chicago Stadium, was a disparate tale of two goaltenders.
Ed Belfour of the Blackhawks, still struggling to regain his rhythm after a 14-game holdout against intransigent management, faced a modest 25 shots tonight and did not stop enough of them.
Mike Richter of the Rangers, who played through the preseason without a contract and then signed a compromise pact with little fuss, was often brilliant with 44 saves in the Rangers' 4-3 victory over Chicago.


Jerusalem, Dressed in White
Jerusalem, city of miracles to three major faiths, found itself humbled today by one of the few heavenly acts for which the millenniums have provided scant experience: a world-class snowfall.
The city struggled with its worst snowstorm in four decades, muddling through like the eclectic place it is, with a mixture of Mediterranean efficiency and Manhattan carefreeness.

Why Did It Have to Take 'J.F.K.' to Wake Us?; Kennedy Was No Dove
To the Editor:
Oliver Stone's assertion (Op-Ed, Dec. 20) that history "may be too important to leave to newsmen" should be expanded to include reductionist film makers.


New Publisher For Seventeen
Janice Grossman, who became the publisher of New York magazine a year ago, was named publisher of Seventeen yesterday by K-III Magazines, which owns both publications.
She replaces Michelle Berman, who resigned in October.
Seventeen, which is aimed at young women 13 to 24 years old, leads the teen-age market with a circulation of 1.8 million, up almost 7 percent for the first six months of last year over the previous six-month period.


A Specialist in Cutting Costs Is the New President of PNC
The PNC Financial Corporation, the prosperous Pittsburgh banking company, which grew rapidly in the 1980's to become the 16th largest in the country, yesterday named a new president, James E. Rohr.
Mr.
Rohr, 43, started at the Pittsburgh National Bank in 1972 and spent most of his career in corporate banking.
In his new position, he will be the No. 2 PNC executive after Thomas H. O'Brien, who gave up the president's title but remains chairman and chief executive.


A Warning From Margarita
Does it make sense for a child who has lived with foster parents for seven years, almost her entire life, to be returned to her natural mother?
Perhaps not, but that was the painful decision of a New York City Family Court Judge, Jeffry Gallet.
He faced a no-win situation after seven years of mismanagement by a private agency and an alarming failure by the city's Human Resources Administration to monitor it.
The child, identified as "Margarita," was born prematurely to a drug-abusing mother living in a homeless shelter.
After spending her first two months in neonatal intensive care, Margarita was placed with foster parents with the permission of her natural mother.
There she remained, with the exception of one month, for seven years.
The child and the foster parents were supervised by the Puerto Rican Association for Community Affairs (Praca), one of many voluntary agencies used by the city to provide foster care services.


Kansas City Journal; A Shared Dream: Treasures From a Sunken Boat
Few people dream of recovering historical treasure from a sunken ship.
But for five businessmen who did, the dream came true at the bottom of the Missouri River in the form of a 19th-century steamboat, the Arabia.
Now they are sharing their dream with the public after the excavation of that relic of life on the frontier.
In November the businessmen, including a father and two sons, and their families opened a museum, the Treasures of the Steamboat Arabia, to show off the Arabia, which sank in 1856, and thousands of artifacts salvaged from her.


No One Has a Child for Welfare Benefits
To the Editor:
New Jersey's and California's proposals to "reform" welfare by refusing additional benefits to families that have additional children (news articles, Dec. 6 and Dec. 11) constitute another misguided and mean-spirited attack on the poor.


Critic's Choice/Dance; A Collaboration In Individuality
Beverly Blossom and Douglas Nielsen are antic, highly individualistic choreographers and performers whose vividly theatrical dance has grown out of wide worlds of experience in American modern dance.
The two, who are sharing a program this weekend at Dance Theater Workshop, will present three solos each and perform together in a new collaboration called "Four Bits (a k a Two Cents)."
Ms.
Blossom was a principal dancer with Alwin Nikolais from 1953 to 1963, later working with Roberts Blossom's Filmstage Inc. and on her own in New York City.
After a 22-year career as a dance professor at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, Ms.
Blossom returned to New York in 1990, and has carved a niche for herself in the city's dance life as a solo performer capable of capturing audiences with a turn of the head or a teasing bit of bump and grind in her comic-tragic pieces.


CHRONICLE
Who is the busiest member of the British royal family?
TIM O'DONOVAN, a London insurance broker who has kept track of the public engagements -- opening ceremonies, receptions, banquets, investitures, luncheons and the like -- for members of the family for 13 years, said that PRINCESS ANNE ranks first in industriousness, outdoing even her mother, QUEEN ELIZABETH II.
Princess Anne had 504 engagements in 1991 in Britain, and 241 abroad; the Queen had 455 in Britain, 126 abroad.
Anne started to catch up with her mother in 1985, Mr.
O'Donovan said, and she has been tireless ever since.


Gloom Prevails at Crucial Time in Quebec Dispute
At a gathering of well-to-do Canadians at a private home here on New Year's Eve, the midnight toasts included one to a happier year for Canada in 1992 than in 1991.
Then, as the conversation turned to Quebec and its French-speaking majority, voices were raised.
"No more concessions!" an English-speaking businessman said, prompting similar remarks from several other guests.


Sounds Around Town
A Quartet's Anniversary
Modern Jazz Quartet, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600.
Although the Modern Jazz Quartet is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a group this month, the original members were playing together in Dizzy Gillespie's orchestra as early as 1946.
In fact, the initials M.J.Q. were first used to identify the Milt Jackson Quartet in 1951, a year before the Modern Jazz Quartet became an entity.
Since Mr.
Jackson, John Lewis, Percy Heath and Kenny Clarke became the Modern Jazz Quartet in 1952, there has been only one change in its makeup, when Mr.
Clarke, the drummer, went to France in 1955 and was replaced by Connie Kay.
Since then the same four musicians have been creating, polishing and re-creating one of the most rewarding repertories in jazz, based on the compositions of Mr.
Lewis and Mr.
Jackson.
They play in the Cafe Carlyle tonight and tomorrow at 8:45 and 10:45 P.M.
There is a music charge of $35, plus a $10 minimum.
Rare Performances
Chris Anderson Trio, Birdland, 2745 Broadway, at 105th Street, Manhattan, (212) 749-2228.
In the 31 years since the pianist Chris Anderson moved to New York City from Chicago, he has received accolades from fellow musicians like the saxophonist Clifford Jordan (who called him "a harmonic master whose playing is very subtle") and the pianist Barry Harris ("When Chris does his thing, it's just beautiful").
Yet in three decades New Yorkers have had relatively few opportunities to hear Mr.
Anderson because his public performing has been limited by two physical disabilities: he is blind, and his bones are so brittle that they break easily and frequently.
But on Sunday he is to appear at Birdland for three sets, at 9 P.M., 10:30 P.M. and midnight, with Lisle Atkinson on bass and Winard Harper of the Harper Brothers on drums.
There will be a $5 music charge and a $5 minimum at tables; at the bar there is a one-drink minimum but no music charge.
Recording at J's
Ken Peplowski Quartet, J's, 2581 Broadway, between 97th and 98th Streets, Manhattan, (212) 666-3600.
Ken Peplowski's jazz career is being built around one-nighters at J's.
Carl Jefferson, who owns the perceptively swinging jazz label Concord Records, heard the clarinetist and saxophonist playing at J's a couple of years ago and signed him to make his first album.
As a result, his debut album was made at J's.
Now he is to make his second album, again for Concord and again to be recorded live at J's.tomorrow night.
The quartet includes Frank Vignola on guitar, Murray Wall on bass and Tom Melito on drums.
The music starts tomorrow at 8:30 P.M. with a $12 minimum at tables and a $7 minimum at the bar.
There is no cover charge.

And He Can't Dunk
Commissioner DAVID STERN, the man who maneuvered the National Basketball Association into big money and international markets, is the most powerful person in sports, according to The Sporting News.
Only three athletes -- two of them basketball players -- made the weekly newspaper's list of the 100 most powerful people in sports, and they finished far down in a ranking dominated by businessmen, television executives and league commissioners.
MAGIC JOHNSON was No. 31, MICHAEL JORDAN, 50th, and JACK NICKLAUS, 81st.


Salvadoran Opponents Clash Hours After a Peace Accord
Salvadoran Army troops and leftist guerrillas clashed only hours after both sides signed a peace plan aimed at ending the civil war, officials said today.
A spokesman for the Salvadoran armed forces said one soldier was killed on Wednesday in fighting in the northern department of Chalatenango.


The Art Market
It's Better to Receive
Museums can't stop talking about what they got for Christmas.
Despite cuts in public and private aid caused by the recession, museums -- both big and small -- are reporting a rush of year-end gifts of top-quality artworks.
The reason: a Federal tax law that permits donors of valuable objects to deduct their full market value, determined by an outside appraiser, on income-tax returns.


Art in Review
Agnes Martin  Pace Gallery 32 East 57th Street Through tomorrow
Agnes Martin, now 80 years old, has been working out basically the same abstract painting for many years.
It is six feet square, and based on a version of the grid form she has favored since the late 1950's.
Although usually associated with Minimalism, in Ms.
Martin's hands the grid had the flavor of a mathematical folk design, like almanac charts and quilt patterns.


Abortion Advocates Denounce Shutdown of Hospital's Clinics
For years, abortion foes, including some of Nassau County's top officials, have tried to stop the county's only public hospital from performing abortions.
Now as Nassau County Medical Center has begun to close its abortion and family-planning clinics in a cost-cutting move -- one that will force hundreds of poor women to seek alternatives -- advocates of abortion rights are accusing the county of carrying out a cynical, ideological vendetta.

Diner's Journal
For Indulging at Lunch
Even though the holiday binges are guilt-laden memories, there is no reason not to indulge in a good lunch now and then.
Here is a suggestion.


Battle Sings Previn
The Orchestra of St.
Luke's is to present a concert on Sunday at 3 P.M. at Carnegie Hall.
Andre Previn is to conduct the premiere of his song cycle "Honey and Rue," for soprano and small jazz ensemble, with lyrics by Toni Morrison.
The soloist is Kathleen Battle, who will also perform two arias by Rossini.
Also on the program are Mozart's "Haffner" Symphony and Mendelssohn's "Italian" Symphony, conducted by David Zinman.

Information: (212) 247-7800.


Little Anger Among Those on Bush Trip
For all the Japanese fears that the business executives joining President Bush on his Asian trip are coming to protest their trade policies, many of these leaders will probably bear a friendlier message.
Many have already prospered from contracts with Japanese companies and see the trip as a chance to drum up business.
J.
Bronce Henderson 3d, chief executive of Detroit Center Tool Inc., simply wishes to sell the Japanese his most advanced welding systems.
For him, the President's trip represents an unusual opportunity to get the attention of top Japanese auto executives, said Paul Diettmer, the company's manager of advertising.


Topics of The Times; Tacky, Not Trendy
Perhaps we are oversensitive, but a term newly making the rounds seems particularly offensive.
It is "breeder," meaning one who chooses to have children.
It can be used in question form ("Oh, so you're a breeder?") or in the simple declarative ("I've decided I'm a non-breeder.") In either case, the required mode of delivery is studied nonchalance.
What rankles is not so much the breezy dismissal of parenthood as a stud and kennel service.
It's more the implication that a difficult and emotional decision requires no more thought than choosing a pair of shoes.


Toys 'R' Us Christmas Sales Jump
As the nation's retailers began reporting the results of the holiday selling season yesterday, Toys "R" Us stood out with better-than-expected sales gains that caused a stampede among investors to buy its stock.
Results of two regional discount chains were more in line with analysts' expectations.


Shadow of Prison Wall
One of Connecticut's most notorious murderers and another inmate at the state's maximum-security prison in Somers escaped on New Year's Eve.
They briefly took two hostages here, stole a truck and have not been seen since.
To prison administrators, this was an unfortunate and -- as of now -- an unexplained lapse.


Establishing Paternity Earlier To Gain Child Support Later
The father of Magdalena Marrero's two sons stopped giving her money to support the boys in 1989, she said.
Even so, she only reluctantly named him recently to qualify for welfare.
The man was a heel, Ms.
Marrero said, but she still felt guilty for turning him in to the welfare system, which she said had treated her "like a speck of dirt that doesn't mean anything."


Review/Art; At the Met, a Large Sampling Of Small South Asian Works
For admirers of South and Southeast Asian art, the Samuel Eilenberg Collection has long been one of New York's hidden treasures.
Mr.
Eilenberg, a professor (now emeritus) of mathematics at Columbia, has spent decades building up one of the world's premier collections of small-scale Asian sculptures, chiefly in bronze, but including objects in silver, stone, terra cotta and stucco as well.
The Met purchased several pieces over the years, and in 1987 Mr.
Eilenberg gave the museum more than 400 as a gift.
Almost half of these works, supplemented by a few loans from Mr.
Eilenberg himself, have been brought together in an exhibition titled "The Lotus Transcendent." Much of the material will be included in the Met's new Florence and Herbert Irving Galleries of Indian and Southeast Asian sculpture, to be completed in 1994.
But schedules, economics and politics being what they are -- the Irving galleries' opening has already been put off more than once -- it is best to see this remarkable gathering while you can.

Washington Coach Is Happy With Just a Share of the Title
When the phone in his hotel room hadn't rung by 6:30 this morning, Don James turned to his wife, Carol, with a look full of disappointment.
Not even a Rose Bowl victory, it seemed at that moment, was enough to earn the University of Washington a national championship.
But 11 minutes later, James finally smiled.
Even though The Associated Press panel of writers and broadcasters had narrowly voted Miami as its No. 1 team, the coaches in the USA Today/CNN poll had picked Washington, assuring college football of co-national champions for a second straight year.
The New York Times computer picked Miami first, Washington second.
The United Press International poll had Washington No. 1 and Miami No.  2.


Why Did It Have to Take 'J.F.K.' to Wake Us?; Questions Need Asking
To the Editor:
Does it matter that Oliver Stone presents in his movie a view discredited by some?
The point of "J.F.K." lies not in Jim Garrison's (and Mr. Stone's) point of speculation.
Rather the film stirs debate and demands questions be asked about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
The film is important, whether or not President Lyndon B. Johnson was involved and independent of possible connection with the assassinations of the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy.
Even if Mr.
Garrison (and Mr. Stone) miss the boat completely, the Warren Commission report may still be subject to inquiry.


Atlanta Man Charged in Killing of 4 in His Family
The police charged a 30-year-old man today with the slaying of his parents, his sister and his 5-year-old niece.
They were stabbed and bludgeoned on New Year's morning as they slept and a 2-year-old boy apparently looked on.
At a preliminary hearing in Municipal Court on the four murder counts today, the suspect, Maxwell Winston Jr., stood mute, nodding only "yes" that he understood the charges and "no" that he did not want the court to appoint a lawyer for him.


Algeria Chooses Islam
Algeria's struggle to rid itself of French colonialism in the 1950's inspired colonized people around the world.
Last week Algeria set a different kind of example, successfully completing the first round of the most democratic elections ever held in North Africa.
The key question, for Algeria's secularist minority and for its neighbors, is whether the victorious Islamic Salvation Front will respect the pluralism that permitted its victory.


Republics, Following Russia, Free Prices
Fearful that suppliers would divert their goods across the border to Russia, the governments of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova went along with President Boris N. Yeltsin's sweeping liberalization of consumer prices today.
Ukraine, which had reluctantly planned to raise prices one week after Russia, at the last minute decided to free prices today.
Moldova and Belarus followed suit with price increases of their own.


Mary Virginia Gaver Dies at 85; An Advocate for School Libraries
Mary Virginia Gaver, who championed the cause of school libraries in America, died Tuesday at the Roman Eagle Memorial Home in Danville, Va.
She was 85 years old and died of Parkinson's disease, her family said.
Miss Gaver helped develop national school library standards in 1960 and headed a $1.1 million campaign promoting their adoption nationwide and creating eight model libraries.


Croatia's Tudjman Is Really a Moderate; Still Time to Forgive
To the Editor:

Indictment In Fraud Case
A Federal grand jury today returned a 30-count indictment against Steven D. Wymer, an investment manager accused of defrauding local governments in Iowa, California and Colorado.
At least $100 million is estimated to be missing from client accounts.
The indictment, charging Mr.
Wymer with securities fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice and lying to Federal investigators, broadened the Government's case against the former president and sole owner of Institutional Treasury Management Inc. of Irvine, Calif.
The charges carry maximum penalties of 275 years in prison and fines of more than $14 million.


On Stage, and Off
Broadway and a Cause
The biggest names in theater have all been working over the holidays -- on their contributions to "Broadway: Day and Night," the book being published in the fall by Pocket Books, which says it will give all royalties to Equity Fights AIDS and Broadway Cares.
A first printing of 50,000 copies is planned.


Kuwait City Journal; Foreign Women Lured Into Bondage in Kuwait
Edita Castro left her home in a Manila slum for Kuwait after hearing a radio commercial promising a good job overseas.
Out of work, struggling to feed her three children, the 33-year-old mother packed her bags for what she thought would be a two-year stint as a nanny.
But when she showed up at the airport she was spirited away in a van to a house in Kuwait City.
She would work, she was informed, not as a nanny but a maid.


Publisher to Begin Three Magazines
Viare Publishing Inc. in New York, the publisher of Video Review, plans to begin three more entertainment-related magazines in the next six months.
They are Skypix, a movie magazine that will complement the Skypix satellite pay-per-view system; Event/U.S.A., which will report on special events offered by promoters across the country, and Camcorder Review.


Corrections
An article on Tuesday about birth rates in Eastern Europe referred incorrectly in some editions to a new Romanian abortion law.
It allows abortions in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.

Dow Gains 3.58 to Close At 3,172.41
Stocks edged further upward in the year's opening session yesterday, as widespread selling was overwhelmed by a last-minute buying surge that extended the market's rally and carried it to a fifth straight record.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.58 points, to 3,172.41, the 10th consecutive rise.


Economic Scene; How Much Aid To Give the East?
AMID great turmoil and doubts, Russia has taken its historic plunge to economic and political freedom.
And the United States, perhaps belatedly, is moving to organize Western aid for Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union that must rebuild collapsing economies.
At Princeton University last month Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the popularly elected leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the other republics are looking to America and the West for "guidance and help in launching genuine, far-reaching political and economic reform." But how much can the United States, running a budget deficit expected to exceed $350 billion this year, do to help the ex-Communist countries?

CHRONICLE
"This may be exhausting, but I can't think of a better way to start the New Year," JOHN CORIGLIANO said yesterday, noting that performances and rehearsals of his two new works -- "Ghosts of Versailles" and his Symphony No. 1 -- will converge in the coming week.
The opera is to be performed tomorrow, Tuesday and Friday by the Metropolitan Opera, and the symphony is to be performed by the New York Philharmonic on Thursday evening, Friday morning and Saturday evening, and then again the following Tuesday evening.

More than 90 percent of Metro-North's customers reside in Westchester County, N.Y., and Fairfield County, Conn.


Rear Adm. Grace M. Hopper Dies; Innovator in Computers Was 85
Rear Adm.
Grace Murray Hopper, retired, a mathematician and pioneer in data processing who was a legendary figure among both computer scientists and industry executives, died New Year's Day at her home in Arlington, Va.
Admiral Hopper, who was 85 years old, had been in ill health recently, family members said, and died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes.


Cavs Quiet Knick Noisemakers
The Knicks played hard last night, but they did not always play well.
They fell behind by 15 points in the third quarter.
They missed a bundle of easy shots.
They received no offense from their starting shooting guard, Gerald Wilkins (no points, 0-for-4 shooting), and when it counted most, the Cleveland Cavaliers played with more poise.


Steinbrenner Hopes for Talks
George Steinbrenner confirmed yesterday that there has been movement to dispose of the two lawsuits brought against baseball by Yankees associates, further indicating that Steinbrenner is hoping to meet with Commissioner Fay Vincent by next week to discuss his possible return.
Though Steinbrenner said the lawsuits "are still out there," he agreed with the comments Vincent made Wednesday when the commissioner said he expected the lawsuits to be rescinded soon.
Vincent has refused to have any substantive discussions with the former managing general partner of the Yankees until the lawsuits are renounced.


Little on Its Agenda, Congress Plays Wait-and-See as New Session Starts
Congress will return to the capital to meet for a few minutes Friday, fulfilling a constitutional command that it begin its session on Jan. 3, but with little on the immediate agenda besides leadership meetings and a few news conferences.
In contrast to the scene a year ago, when most lawmakers were here early expecting to confront the grave issue of war in the Persian Gulf, few are in town now, and the choices they face seem harder to grasp.


Emerson Radio Gets Chairman
Jerry Zarin, the turnaround expert named president and chief executive of the financially troubled Emerson Radio Corporation last August, yesterday assumed the additional title of chairman.
He replaces William L. Lane, 57 years old, whose family continues to be a major shareholder in the company, based in North Bergen, N.J.
Emerson markets a range of consumer electronics products manufactured to its specifications in the Far East.


Moses Files For Arbitration
Edwin Moses, the former Olympic champion 400-meter hurdler, and three other athletes have applied for arbitration through the United States Olympic Committee to gain places on the American bobsled team for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France.
Moses and the others -- Willie Gault of the Los Angeles Raiders; Greg Harrell, a former football player, and Brian Shimer, already a member of the United States team as driver of a two-man sled -- are seeking to make the team in the four-man event.


Puerto Rico's Vote
To the Editor:
"Puerto Ricans Tilt to Statehood" (editorial Dec. 16) does not fully explain Puerto Rico's vote on Gov.
Rafael Hernandez Colon's ambiguous plebiscite.
The voting constituency of Puerto Rican-Americans has spoken and its clear majority "no" represents a victory for the Republican National Committee of Puerto Rico and our quest for statehood.


Robert Wakefield Armstrong, 69, a Revlon Executive for 3 Decades
Robert Wakefield Armstrong, retired chairman of the Revlon subsidiary that introduced the company's perfumes and other cosmetics to the Soviet Union and markets in Asia, died on Wednesday at the Stamford Hospital in Connecticut.

He died of cardiac arrest, a family member said.


Simon's Tour Backed in South Africa
The largest group of anti-apartheid musicians in South Africa said today that it supported a tour of the country by the American singer Paul Simon despite criticism by radical blacks.
The mainly black group, the South African Musicians' Alliance, said it approved of the tour this month because Mr.
Simon had contributed to a fund to develop black music, and his musicians would hold workshops for young artists during the tour.

Bridge
There is no way to determine, objectively, the identity of the world's best junior player, who according to international standards must be under 26 years of age, but one of the strongest candidates is a Canadian.
He is 23-year-old Geoff Hampson of Toronto, who four months ago was a member of the Canadian team that finished second in the World Junior Team Championships in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Since then he has qualified to be a member of Canada's squad in the World Team Olympiad in Salsomaggiore, Italy, next August.
Junior players rarely achieve such heights, and he will be one of the youngest contestants.
A week ago Hampson was at the Greater New York Bridge Association's Winter Regionals, where he won the premier event, a four-session Swiss Teams, along with Michael Polowan, Sue Picus and Richard Schwartz.

Despite a Lingering Recession, More People Are Giving to the Neediest Cases
A dramatic surge in the number of donations enabled The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to top $3.5 million yesterday as it entered the second half of the campaign.
Thirty-four days into the campaign, the Neediest Cases has received 9,789 donations, a 21.5 percent increase from last year when 8,060 contributions were made in the same period.


Treasuries Slip on Budget Concerns
Prices of Treasury securities slipped a bit again yesterday, as worries arose again about what sort of fiscal package Congress and the Bush Administration were likely to concoct over the next few months.
Talk about tax cuts and the like was stimulated by an article yesterday in The Washington Post, which quoted President Bush as saying the 1990 budget accord might be reopened to shift spending planned for the military into domestic areas.


Documenting Your House
The start of a new year is a good time to sort important papers at home.
One of the most important files for any homeowner is the one that records all improvements.
That file can be used to lower the size of the capital gains tax owed after sale of the house because such verified costs will be deemed part of the amount the owner paid for the home.
The file can also be useful when applying for an equity loan because it will verify value added to the original worth of the house.
Documents to Keep
A record of the original purchase price and all incidental expenses connected with that purchase.
Contracts, estimates, bills, receipts and canceled checks covering labor, materials and other costs for renovations.
Any building permit or certificate of occupancy connected with a major alteration like an addition or an outdoor improvement like a swimming pool.
Before and after photographs will separate improvements from routine maintenance.
Home Offices
Anyone working at home should also include records substantiating when the office was opened and its maintenance costs.
These records can make a significant difference in the taxes due after sale of the house or in regular income taxes.
What to Discard
Records of routine maintenance costs like repainting a room, fixing a leaky gutter, replacing a cracked window pane.
Neither lenders nor the Internal Revenue Service consider these as adding value to a property.

REBELS IN GEORGIA KILL TWO AT RALLY
Opposition gunmen hurled smoke bombs today and then opened fire on demonstrators chanting the name of President Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia.
At least 2 people were killed and 25 others wounded.
Panic reigned amid the smoke and flying bullets, and many at the rally of about 3,000 people dived for cover behind cars and kiosks.


Foothill Deal for Utility
The Tucson Electric Power Company sold a block of 3.8 million shares of Foothill Group Inc. yesterday to a number of institutional and individual investors for about $19.3 million, Foothill announced.

Review/Cabaret; Billy Stritch In a Solo Act At Rainbow
Billy Stritch has been a familiar face on New York City's cabaret scene from his years as leader of the vocal trio Montgomery, Plant and Stritch, but not until he went solo last year did his career begin to soar.
Last spring, the singer, pianist and protege of Liza Minnelli played a successful engagement at the Greenwich Village club Eighty-Eight's that revealed him as a sort of swinging answer to another Minnelli protege, Michael Feinstein.
And on Thursday evening he moved a significant rung up the ladder by opening a four-week engagement at Rainbow and Stars (30 Rockefeller Plaza, 65th floor).
The date coincides with the release of his first solo album on DRG Records.
Like Mr.
Feinstein and Harry Connick Jr., Mr.
Stritch, who is 29 years old, has built a musical style that is a personal composite of 1940's and 50's influences.
In Mr.
Stritch's case, they include the breathy crooning of Dick Haymes and the scat style of Mel Torme.
If Mr.
Stritch's voice lacks the physical power of his models, his more intimate singing is beguiling in its warmth, delicacy and clarity of diction.
He is also one of a handful of singing pianists whose keyboard proficiency, skills in arranging and charm work together to make one forget that he is tied to a piano, even when executing technically demanding flourishes.
At Rainbow and Stars, he is joined by David Finck on bass and Dave Ratajczak on drums, whose support enhances the rhythmic strength of singing that even in the quietest moments conveys a steady current of swing.


Insurance Mirage; A Growing U.S. Affliction: Worthless Health Policies
About a year ago, Camille Ewing survived a grueling $200,000 operation to replace his diseased heart.
But he suffered one unforeseen complication: His health insurance turned out to be worthless because the plan collapsed, and he was stuck with the bills.
Mr.
Ewing and his family have since been sued by Stanford University Hospital.
They recently lost their home in Santa Barbara, Calif.
Over 10 months, the Ewings' health coverage was shifted to two other plans.
Both of them also collapsed.

Cold War Static On Fiber Optics
In a hangover of the cold war, the Bush Administration is continuing an embargo on the sale of sophisticated telecommunications technology to the former Soviet Union.
This misguided policy prevents American companies from helping the Russians when they really need it and making a buck at the same time.
Washington's error became embarrassingly clear -- and costly -- when a German company, using a loophole in the trade restriction, recently sold high-speed fiber-optic cable to Moscow at the expense of an American manufacturer, U S West.
Unless the Administration rescinds the embargo, it risks putting the U.S. telecommunications industry at a competitive disadvantage in its effort to capture a huge market.


Cuban Pilot Defects With 33 Others in a Daring Helicopter Flight
In a daring escape from one of the world's last remaining Communist nations, a pilot for the Cuban national airline commandeered a helicopter in Havana today and flew 33 relatives and friends to a small suburban airport here.

Fugitive Slain After Long Chase in California
A driver killed a good Samaritan, then led the police on a 300-mile chase before he ran out of gas and was shot to death, the authorities said today.
Officers pulled up near the fugitive on a freeway exit in this Los Angeles suburb and shot him as he moved a sawed-off shotgun toward them, said Lyle Whitten, a California Highway Patrol officer.

Deep Recession Takes Aim at New Jersey Papers

It was the lowest since rates averaged 8.18 percent during the week ending July 27, 1973.


RESULTS PLUS N.B.A.  Battle Leads Cavaliers Over Celtics


Algeria Says Election Violations May Erode Militants' Advantage
The Algerian Government asserted today that voting irregularities could deprive the Islamic fundamentalists of as many as 70 of the 188 seats they won in last week's parliamentary elections.
The Government and most other parties opposed to the fundamentalists are now trying to dilute the Islamic triumph in the Dec. 26 elections, in which the Islamic Salvation Front appeared well on its way to securing a majority of the 430-seat multi-party National Assembly.
Depending on how far the Government is willing to go, the result could in fact deny the fundamentalists their almost certain victory.  300 Complaints Reported
Government officials said today that as many as 300 complaints of irregularities could result in the annulment of vote results for seats that the Islamic Salvation Front won in the first round of elections.
The complaints involve such activities as improper campaigning and tampering with ballots.


CEASE-FIRE STILLS GUNFIRE IN CROATIA
After six months of increasing warfare and a night and a day of intense clashes, fighting between Serbs and Croats appeared to wane on Croatia's battlefields tonight as the deadline for ending hostilities arrived.
The United Nations-brokered cease-fire took effect at 6 P.M. local time, and it is too early to call the truce successful.
But reports that silence replaced gunfire in Vinkovci, Sibenik and other front-line areas of Croatia raised hopes that all-out fighting between Serbs and Croats might be near an end, and that United Nations peacekeeping forces may soon arrive to prevent new violence from breaking out.


White Sox Abandon Sax Deal
Just when it appeared that the Yankees had worked a deal to trade veteran second baseman Steve Sax and the bulk of his $12.4 million contract to the Chicago White Sox for pitcher Melido Perez, the trade appears to have fizzled.
Hours after saying that the deal was set and awaiting only the approval of the Yankees' hierarchy, White Sox General Manager Ron Schueler announced a sudden turnaround last night.


Knicks Hurt by Jack-Rabbit Play
Playing well for 48 minutes has suddenly become a problem for the Knicks.

U.S. ACCUSES IRAQ OF BLOCKING AID
The State Department accused Iraq today of continuing to impede international aid to its 18 million people and called on President Saddam Hussein's Government to immediately resume sales of crude oil under United Nations supervision to help feed its people.
A department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, catalogued several recent attempts by Iraqi officials to block the distribution of donated food and medicine to tens of thousands of Iraqis.
Many Iraqis are said to be suffering from disease and malnutrition brought on in part by a 17-month-old trade embargo that has further devastated the Iraq's economy and prevented it from recovering from the effects of the Persian Gulf war.


For Olympics, Choices Are Not Clear
Because the sport is tennis, one noted more for self-aggrandizement than selflessness, selecting a team of Olympic volunteers by next week's deadline may be easier said than done for the United States.
For some players accustomed to earning six-figure paychecks in the space of an afternoon, a near-three-week stint in Barcelona, Spain, where they will bed down in a dorm instead of the Ritz, may seem like an underpaid eternity.
While the Olympic medals beckon, the United States is trying to sort its sure things from its long shots: John McEnroe wants in, Andre Agassi wants out, and there's even a hitch with the normally trouble-free women's squad because two teams, the United States and Puerto Rico, are vying for the services of one player, Gigi Fernandez.

Patents; Extended Rights Sought On Some Delayed Products
The Procter &amp; Gamble Company says it has spent $180 million and more than two decades trying to win regulatory approval for Olestra, its potentially revolutionary fat substitute made from polyester.
Yet as the company carries out still another round of tests for the Food and Drug Administration, it complains that its patents have been rendered all but worthless because they are scheduled to expire by the end of 1994.

U.S. and Allies to Seek U.N. Support Against Libya
Before seeking international sanctions, the United States, Britain and France plan to ask the United Nations Security Council to support their demand that Libya turn over agents accused in the bombings of two airliners, Western diplomats said today.
The three countries would ask the Council to approve sanctions against Libya only if Tripoli refused to obey the proposed order by the Security Council, which would also demand compensation.


Nassau Board Squabbles Could Lead to Stalemate
Six minutes after the historically staid Nassau County Board of Supervisors convened in its dark-paneled meeting room today, the fireworks began.
Lewis J. Yevoli, the newly sworn-in Democratic supervisor from Oyster Bay, looked around in confusion and asked, "When can I speak?" Then, taking the floor, he lambasted the county for paying $550,000 in what he termed unnecessary legal fees, much of it to well-connected Republican law firms.


Your Money; Help for Workers Posted Overseas
WITH the economic integration of Western Europe this year and the remarkable drive by Eastern Europe toward a market economy, American companies are increasing their presence abroad.
But people who assume that a transfer to Brussels is like a move to, say, Boston, can find that financial disasters arise.
Even in Western Europe, consumer banking practices often do not meet American expectations, and in Eastern Europe and the third world many services may not be available at all.
Also, most people assigned overseas continue to have financial obligations at home -- mortgage and tuition payments, insurance premiums, investment accounts, credit cards, taxes, perhaps alimony or support for elderly parents.
All of this calls for arranging financial affairs in advance.


Big Retailers Report Weak December Sales
The nation's big retail chains reported disappointing December sales yesterday, even falling short of the industry's modest goals, retail executives and industry analysts said.
The reports mark the third straight year of weak sales during the crucial holiday selling season.
Several large merchants, including Sears, Roebuck and J. C. Penney, either failed to match or barely exceeded last year's poor results, while the Gap and Wal-Mart Stores posted solid gains.

But its administrators have yet to complete an affiliation plan with Sacred Heart University in Fairfield that will result in Bridgeport ceasing to exist as an independent institution at the semester's end.


It's Billington's Turn Now as the Devils Play Favorites
One of the peculiar things about professional hockey is that a team sometimes goes through a stretch in which it performs more effectively in front of one goaltender than it does another.

LaFontaine's Revenge: Sabres Thrash Islanders
A visit to Memorial Auditorium tonight left the Islanders with one more defeat and three more injuries.
The Sabres beat them, 5-2, as Aleksandr Mogilny scored three times.

Tom Kurvers scored twice for the Islanders.
"Some of the Islanders were joking around and saying things about my mask and my jaw and my mouth and I was trying to focus," said LaFontaine, the former Islander star who is wearing elaborate headgear to protect a jawbone healing from a recent break.
"During the first period, I had butterflies, nerves.

Politicians Assail Hertz For New York Surcharge
Kathleen Restifo and Dr.
David Bernstein rented from Hertz this weekend, but she will be doing all the driving.
She's from Philadelphia; he's from Brooklyn.
Dr.

Israelis Have Every Right Not to Hear Wagner; After Herzl's Time
To the Editor:
Karl E. Meyer misses the point (Editorial Notebook, Dec. 19).
Theodor Herzl died in 1904 and so did not survive, witness or even live during, the murder of six million Jews by men and women who were also inspired by Richard Wagner's music.


Election Panel Is Hoping To Replenish Its Funds
The Federal Election Commission, hoping to stave off a $150 million shortage projected by 1996 in the taxpayer-financed campaign fund, announced today that it would begin a public relations effort and an appeal to Congress to replenish its coffers.
Joan Aikens, the chairwoman of the commission, said the Presidential Election Campaign Fund would probably not run out of money in the 1992 campaign season, but only because Presidential candidates had made lower demands on the public financing mechanism this year.


Younger Baby Boomers Are Found Less Well Off
The outsized baby boom generation, whose attitudes and angst have been fodder for demographers, advertisers and scriptwriters since the early 1960's, is really made up of two disparate mini-generations equal in size but not in opportunity, with the younger less well off and more politically alienated than the older group.
This conclusion made in a new report, "The Baby Boom -- Entering Midlife," by two demographic researchers, Leon F. Bouvier and Carol J. DeVita, and is based on data showing that by several economic measures, including home ownership, the "trailing edge" of the baby boom, or those born in the years 1955 through 1964, is not likely to achieve the same standard of living as the "leading-edge" baby boomers born in the years 1946 through 1954.

EX-SOVIETS RECEIVE LIST OF U.S. MISSING
The Bush Administration has given several former Soviet republics the names of more than 50 Americans listed as missing in action from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars who might have been moved to the Soviet Union, officials said today.
The names include those of Americans who fought in Asia in World War II, crew members aboard warplanes that were downed near Soviet territory in the Korean War and prisoners of war taken in Vietnam, the officials said.

U.S. Sharp at Junior Finals
In Germany this week, five first-round National Hockey League draft choices are part of a United States team that might make history with its best finish in the world junior championships.
Despite a 5-0 loss Thursday to the Commonwealth of Independent States, formerly the Soviet Union, the young Americans could finish with a 5-2 record with a victory over Czechoslovakia in the final game today in Fussen.
Until now, the only American medal in tournament history has been a bronze in 1986.
The Yanks still have a chance for a silver, but no guarantee of even third place.

Palestinians Delay Trip to Peace Talks
Palestinian delegates to the Middle East peace talks said today that they had suspended plans to go to Washington for a new round of negotiations next week as a protest against Israel's decision to expel 12 Palestinians from the occupied territories.
The negotiators said a final decision on whether the delay would be temporary or turned into a full-blown boycott was to be made by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which they called "the legitimate political leadership of the Palestinian people."


Preserving Skin Without Preservatives
Adverse reactions to skin-care products are relatively rare, but when they do occur, the two most common culprits are the fragrance ingredients and the preservatives.
Although there are a number of different brands of moisturizers made without fragrance, it is difficult to find a mass market product made without preservatives, especially one from a major manufacturer.


6 EX-SOVIET STATES GAIN U.S. SUPPORT FOR TIE TO LENDERS
The Bush Administration, in a policy switch aimed at more quickly assisting the economic transformation of Russia and five other former Soviet republics, urged today that they be admitted to full membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Membership in the fund and the World Bank for Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia -- the former republics with which the United States is initially establishing diplomatic relations -- could allow them access to billions of dollars in development loans to help make the unsettling transition from a centralized to a free-market economy.

There are about 2000 entries in the Oxford Dictionary of New Words, published last month, and probably less than 10 have to do with religion, ethics or systems of belief.
Far more of the decade's new terms, or new meanings for old terms, have sprung from the business world, with its "junk bonds," "greenmail," "poison pills" and "headhunters." Youth culture, the news media and drug use did more than their share with new words like "high-fives" and "sound bite" and new meanings for once-innocent words like "crack" and "ice."


Water? No. 'New Age' Soda? Clearly.
It looks like a mineral water, tastes like a soft drink and sells for $1 a bottle.
It is Clearly Canadian and it is the beverage industry's fastest-rising star.
Some industry analysts say Clearly Canadian is the new leader of what they call the "new age" category of light beverages like flavored seltzers and fruit juice-based soft drinks.
Unsweetened mineral waters, like Perrier, are not included in the category.


4 Are Given Maximum Sentences in Utah Tourist's Subway Murder
Saying that he wanted to send a strong signal to those who carry out "wolfpack" attacks in New York City, a state judge yesterday sentenced each of the four defendants convicted in the murder of Brian Watkins to the maximum of 25 years to life in prison.
"Make no mistake, we must come to grips with these marauding gangs," the judge, Justice Edwin Torres of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said.


James F. Bere, 69, a Chicago Leader and Corporate Chief
James Frederick Bere, the chairman and chief executive of the billion-dollar Borg-Warner Corporation and a Chicago civic figure, died early yesterday at his home in Hinsdale, Ill., a Chicago suburb.
He was 69 years old.
A statement issued at the Chicago headquarters of Borg-Warner said he had died after a heart attack.


Trouble in SimCity
It had seemed like a chancy Christmas gift: a computer game called SimCity, based on urban management.
But in one New York household, it turned out to be as addictive as any firefight with alien invaders -- and soberingly instructive.
Booted up on the Macintosh computer, the SimCity program presents a piece of barren if promising real estate to a player invested with sweeping powers over a capital fund, zoning rules, tax rates and an operating budget for city services.


In Capital's Power Circle, a Box Helps Keep Score
Forget invitations to White House dinners.
Forget dinner a deux at the British Embassy.
Forget personal tours and tea at the Russian Embassy.
The most clamored-for invitation in the capital is the one from Jack Kent Cooke, septuagenarian owner of the Washington Redskins football team, to watch the National Football League playoffs from his 50-yard-line director's box at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium.


The High Court v. Habeas Corpus
Even as Congress resists attempts to gut the Federal law of habeas corpus, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and his band of Supreme Court activists are racing to lobby the legislators or, if unsuccessful, to amend the law by judicial fiat.
These efforts deeply threaten the Great Writ of habeas corpus, by which Federal courts have long guarded the rights of state prisoners.
Two weeks ago the Court called for argument over whether Federal judges should give extra deference to state legal judgments, including erroneous ones, when reviewing criminal convictions for constitutional error.
Then on New Year's Day the Chief Justice delivered his annual message, calling on Congress to reduce the workload of Federal courts, especially their obligation to hear habeas corpus cases.

Corrections
An article by The Associated Press on Thursday about a Federal audit of Stanford University's research contracts with the Federal Government misattributed an estimate of how much money Stanford might eventually owe the Government.
A Government employee who brought charges of overbilling against Stanford used the figure $480 million; university officials did not use a specific figure.


Orders Rose At Factories In November
An otherwise listless manufacturing sector showed improvement in November largely because of a spurt in aircraft orders, the Government said today.
Orders received by factories rose a modest six-tenths of 1 percent in November, to a seasonally adjusted $243.74 billion, the Commerce Department said.
The jump was attributed primarily to a 24.7 percent rise in aircraft and aeronautics bookings.

Teachers' Union Refuses to Help in the Search for Budget Cuts
In the opening salvo of a campaign to stave off further cuts to New York City's education budget, the United Federation of Teachers has ordered its district representatives not to cooperate in the search for school programs that might be eliminated.
Mayor David N. Dinkins, facing a shortfall of more than $200 million in the city's current $28 billion budget, has proposed that the central Board of Education make a midyear cut of $40 million.
That would be on top of the $430 million eliminated from the school system's budget on July 1, the start of the current fiscal year.


Four Killed in New Jersey Fire Are Buried


METRO DIGEST
DEFENDANTS SENTENCED IN WATKINS TRIAL
Saying he wanted to send a strong message to those who prey in "wolfpacks," a state judge yesterday sentenced each of the four defendants convicted in the murder of Brian Watkins to 25 years to life.
Although none of the four was armed with a deadly weapon during the attack, the judge said they were just as guilty as the person who stabbed Mr.
Watkins.

Review/Pop; Moving to the Beat of Bahia And Tropicalia Connections
Bahian roots have become a hot property in Brazilian pop.
Bahia, the state on Brazil's northeastern coast with the nation's strongest African-Brazilian culture, emerged in the late 1960's as the cradle of the tropicalia movement, which transformed Brazilian pop by connecting local traditions to international rock.
In the late 1980's, Brazilians and foreigners became newly aware of Bahia's blocos afros, orchestras of drums and percussion that play songs about black pride and resistance.
Tania Alves, who is to perform through tonight at the Ballroom, 253 West 28th Street, was born in Rio de Janeiro, but her mother is Bahian.
And she is climbing on the Bahian bandwagon behind Gal Costa, tropicalia's leading interpreter, and Margareth Menezes, who is remaking current Bahian rock.
On Tuesday night, wearing a modified bikini of satin, feathers and beads and dancing with hip-swiveling sensuality, Ms.
Alves dedicated her set to the blocos of Bahia and to Brazil's "mixed blood," the source, she said, of the richness and beauty of Brazilian culture.


Correction Aide Is Demoted During Inquiry
The head of the Correction Department's legal division was demoted yesterday, apparently another casualty of the inquiry into a disputed $1.9 million New York City contract to monitor released prisoners electronically.
Allison Lewis-Smith, who had been the department's Deputy Commissioner for Legal Affairs, was stripped of much of her authority in an administrative shake-up by the city's acting Correction Commissioner, Gerald Mitchell.
Ms.
Lewis-Smith had been brought into the agency last January by Allyn R. Sielaff, who resigned as Correction Commissioner on Dec. 23, hours after he was rebuked by Mayor David N. Dinkins for his department's handling of the contract.


Utley to Attend Game
MIKE UTLEY, the Detroit offensive lineman who suffered an injury to his spinal cord in a game on Nov. 17 and is paralyzed from the chest down, is progressing well in his rehabilitation program in Denver and will attend today's playoff game between Houston and Denver.
He said he wished both teams well, but his primary interest is seeing the Lions make it to the Super Bowl.


Apple-I.B.M. Plan Backed
The Federal Trade Commission has given I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc. approval to proceed with two ventures planned to develop advanced personal computers and multimedia consumer products.
The ventures, Taligent and Kaleida, will be set up in Silicon Valley in California with employees from both computer makers in an effort to carry out an ambitious plan hatched last year by executives of the computer makers.
The officials called the plan an effort to revitalize the computer industry.


Alan E. Himelick, 62, Retired Ad Executive
Alan Edward Himelick, a retired advertising executive, died Dec. 27 at New Milford Hospital in New Milford, Conn.
He was 62 years old and lived in Washington Depot, Conn.
He died of cancer, his family said.


Put Away the Polls: It's Time to Resume the Playoffs; Elway Takes On Moon in a Matchup of Hurlers
Even if the game has been largely ignored, it still doesn't lack for a certain kind of star quality.
John Elway and Warren Moon are undeniably two of pro football's marquee players.
But Saturday's American Conference playoff between the Denver Broncos and the Houston Oilers (Channel 4, 4 P.M.in New York) might be determined, in part, by others.
Like, for instance, Doug Widell, Keith Kartz, William Fuller and Ray Childress.


College Plans Security Force After Deaths
At a tense two-hour meeting yesterday, the trustees and Chancellor of the City University of New York closely questioned top officials of City College yesterday about their roles in planning a celebrity basketball game that turned deadly for nine young people, and then announced that they would make major changes in campus security.
The Chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, said that the college would create its own security force as early as July, with guards who would be given new powers to make arrests.
Currently, the college uses Pinkerton's guards under a contract.
Student Government Blamed
The announcement came after a meeting at which, university officials said, the president of the college, Dr.
Bernard W. Harleston, and several top aides blamed the game's organizers -- the Evening Student Government -- for misleading the college about the nature of the event.
Dr.
Harleston, whose leadership has come under scrutiny in the aftermath of the calamity, blamed that "duplicity" for the failure to provide sufficient security.


Israelis Have Every Right Not to Hear Wagner; 'Behind the Jargon'
To the Editor:
For Daniel Barenboim, conductor of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, to claim that he fully understands the agony felt by concentration camp survivors (Arts pages, Dec. 17) is disingenuous.
And to claim that because Wagner's music forms part of the standard orchestral literature is sufficient reason to include it in the repertory of every orchestra is specious.
One might argue that if just one orchestra, for the most humane of esthetic reasons, excludes that music from its repertory, that is testimony to an esthetic judgment far more compelling in our time than the matter of a representative repertory.


Radio Drama Isn't Dead, Nor the Scary Sound Effects
Making the first episode of "The Radio Stage," a series of hourlong dramas that begins a new season at 7 P.M. tomorrow on WNYC-FM (93.9), was almost as scary as anything in the script.
This is radio, after all, and that means sound effects, not canned sound effects from some dusty old record lying around the control room, but real ones.
Digital audiotape recorder in hand, the director, Marjorie Van Halteren, and the engineer, Edward Haber, spent a day in Bear Mountain State Park in Highlands, N.Y., re-enacting everything but the dialogue, which was recorded back in the studio.
"That's me running through the bushes," Ms.
Van Halteren said.
"Me jumping off a stump. Me putting my foot on the fence."


Police Say Bias Is Still Possible Factor in Killing
Investigators said yesterday that they were still considering racial bias as a possible element in the fatal beating of a black man by several whites in Queens last Saturday.
The commander of Queens detectives, Deputy Chief Raymond J. Abruzzi, said that the death of John Kelley, 22 years old, was still being investigated as a possible bias-related crime, despite reports that it had been stripped of that classification.


New Yorkers Help Tourist in Trouble
To the Editor:
Last week I flew in to New York for some Christmas shopping.
I hadn't been there more than a few hours when someone reached into my shoulder bag in midtown and grabbed my wallet.
Turning for help, I saw firsthand a side of New York most of us usually don't see.
An off-duty firefighter sprang into action to help me call 911, digging through his pockets for a quarter for the phone.


Radioactive Leak at Nuclear Arms Plant Lingers in Savannah River
A radioactive leak from the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant in South Carolina has caused lingering contamination of the Savannah River and prompted the Energy Department today to postpone indefinitely the long-awaited restart of a nuclear reactor there.
The leak of 150 gallons of highly radioactive cooling water came 11 days ago during the final preparations to restart a 37-year-old nuclear reactor that the Government had spent four years and well over $1 billion to repair, the Energy Department said today. 10 Times Above Safety Limit
The leak contained tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, and forced a water utility downstream that serves 50,000 people in Jasper and Beaufort Counties in South Carolina, and two food companies in Savannah, Ga., to close their drinking water intake valves and shut off any flow from the river.


No War. No Peace. No Yugoslavia.
Fourteen cease-fires between Serbian and Croatian forces have failed in the past six months.
But the 15th now looks as though it might hold well enough to permit deployment of some 10,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops.
If so, great credit is due to Cyrus Vance, the former Secretary of State now serving as U.N. special envoy.
Mr.
Vance does not pretend to have resolved all the complex issues of sovereignty, territory and minority rights that led to combat.
But he has worked to halt the killing that has bled Yugoslavia and threatened to draw neighboring countries into destructive conflict.


President Is Installed At Economists Group
William Vickrey, a grand old man of public finance whose avant-garde ideas have influenced economists since the late 1930's, has become the new president of the 20,000-member American Economics Association.
Mr.
Vickrey, 78 years old, a professor of economics at Columbia University, will hold the post -- largely an honorary one -- for the usual one-year term.
As president-elect last year, he took over the new position yesterday at the start of the organization's yearly meeting in New Orleans, succeeding Thomas Schelling of Harvard University.


Chad Army Claims 2 Towns; French Paratroopers Go In
The Government said today that it had recaptured two towns taken briefly by rebels loyal to former President Hissen Habre, killing 400 of them and taking hundreds prisoner.
France, meanwhile, ordered 450 paratroopers to Chad from bases in France and elsewhere in Africa to help protect French nationals and property in the central African nation.
The new paratroops will join about 1,000 French soldiers already in Chad.


Observer; Nobody's the One!
Look, I'm just as fed up with politics and Washington time-servers as you are, but something eerie could be going on with these birds.
For instance, once-invincible President Bush has suddenly become vincible.
The polls show the Democrats can beat him as long as they don't nominate a candidate.
The minute the poll takers test Bush against a live Democrat, however, the President wins easily.
In short, ancient wisdom is failing.
The old-timers said, "You can't beat somebody with nobody." Now a new age: The only way Democrats can beat Bush is with nobody.


Threats by Phone: Free Speech or Just Another Evil?
The answering machine at Gary Hale's home has lost its angry edge.
No longer does it play back obscene messages attacking Mr.
Hale, a state senator, for casting one of the pivotal votes last summer that gave Connecticut an income tax.
But vitriolic messages left on that machine months ago, at the height of protests against the new tax, have come home to some of the people who called him.
One anonymous caller has been identified and charged with harassment.
The police say other arrests are possible.


Twins Born in Different Years
Katherine and Jessica Goddeke are twins, born this week to Susan and Paul Goddeke.
But their birth dates are in different years.
Katherine was born at 11:56 P.M.
Tuesday at St.
Joseph's Mercy Hospital, weighing 8 pounds, 3 ounces.
Jessica arrived at 12:14 A.M.
Wednesday, on New Year's Day, weighing 6 pounds, 15 ounces.
The mother, Susan, said, "We weren't exactly watching the clock, but we were ready to yell, 'Happy New Year!' "


DEMOCRATS AGREE TO SEEK END OF BAN ON BUDGET SHIFTS
Democratic Congressional leaders agreed today to move soon to break down the barriers in the 1990 budget law between military and domestic spending so savings from Pentagon cutbacks could pay for other programs, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said.
Mr.
Foley, a Washington Democrat, and George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader, both praised President Bush for indicating during a television interview tonight with David Frost a willingness to consider removing those barriers.
"We commend the President for reviewing and reversing his position in the light of changing circumstance," Mr.
Mitchell said.


Put Away the Polls: It's Time to Resume the Playoffs; It's Best Vs. Boast As Redskins Face Falcons
The Redskins, like their coach, Joe Gibbs, are smart, methodical, relentless and almost always at their best.
The Atlanta Falcons, like their coach, Jerry Glanville, are unorthodox, flamboyant gamblers who are always boisterous and sometimes obnoxious.


Russians Find Goods Too Pricey, or Don't Find Them at All
As the hard reality of Government-ordered price increases began to take hold in Russia and other former Soviet republics, people continued today to search for goods that either were not there or cost far too much if they were.
There was no comment or evaluation of the effect of the increases from the Russian Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin, who is advocating them as a way to move the country toward a market economy.


A Bag That Lets the Golfer Put Both Shoulders Into the Game
It is common for hikers to carry their gear in knapsacks that hang by two shoulder straps across their backs.
But this concept is largely foreign to golfers, who persist in carrying golf clubs in bags that are slung over one shoulder.
Now a golf equipment manufacturer is trying to change that habit.
The Wilson Sporting Goods Company of River Grove, Ill., has introduced a golf bag with two shoulder straps, modeled after the backpack.
The new bag is designed to balance the weight of clubs more evenly across the back than single-strap bags do.


Junk Mail to Throw Into the Nearest VCR
As some companies scramble to generate sales, consumers are increasingly seeing high-tech forms of advertising -- videotapes and computer disks that promote products, including some that are mailed to consumers' homes.
Last September, for example, some newsstand copies of Elle magazine came with a videocassette that contained a two-and-a-half minute commercial for Spellbound, a perfume made by Estee Lauder.
And for Christmas, the Hartmarx Corporation, the Chicago clothing manufacturer and retailer, mailed videotaped catalogues to the homes of some 150,000 customers.


Bird Misses Game
LARRY BIRD missed the Boston Celtics' game against Cleveland last night and was expected to sit out tonight's contest at Minnesota because of a sore back.
DAVE GAVITT, the Celtics' chief executive officer, said the problem resulted from a fall the player took in practice about a month ago and was not related to Bird's off-season back surgery. (AP)


With Bullets' Record, Why Is Unseld Secure?
One call that was made and another that wasn't were sure to haunt Bill Fitch for at least an airplane ride to Chicago tonight and probably longer.
The Nets' coach slumped behind his desk, his face drained, his hopes dashed, his team's winning streak snapped at four games.
A battle with the Washington Bullets, one so fierce it belied the fact that it was for undisputed possession of fifth place in the Atlantic Division, had been lost.
It was the worst kind of defeat, with twists and turns and opportunities you can't forget.


Few Problems at Madison Square Garden Rap Concert
The first arena-sized rap concert in New York City in four years went off peacefully last night, as an increased police force circled Madison Square Garden and the performers on stage repeatedly reminded to audience to stay calm. .
Worry about outbursts at the show -- already a concern in the long absence of big rap shows in the city -- was heightened this week after the deaths of nine young people crushed at the entrance to a basketball game at City College that featured rap celebrities.
The concert was planned for months, but fell by coincidence less than week after the deaths.


Officer Finds Man's Body in a Bronx Park
A patrol officer who became suspicious when he saw two men leaving the woods in Pelham Bay Park Thursday and was dubious when they said they had gone to bury a dog went to look for himself and found a man's body, the police said.
Returning to the Bronx street where he had left the two men -- after taking their car keys with him -- the officer, David Kozlow, told the men he was going to issue them a summons.
Then he called for more help.

Court Approves Plan to Shift Control of Maxwell Flagship
A plan that transfers control of the Maxwell Communication Corporation to officials appointed by British and American courts was approved by a United States bankruptcy judge yesterday.
The plan, whose approval was expected, leaves the company's board in place, but essentially powerless.
The judge approved a plan giving a United States-appointed examiner and the British-appointed administrator the right to oversee the bankruptcy proceedings.
A British court approved a comparable plan earlier this week.


Slatkin and His Affinity for the Music of America
When the New York Philharmonic was searching for a successor to Zubin Mehta a few years ago, Leonard Slatkin was regularly mentioned as a likely candidate.
At the time, Mr.
Slatkin denied that he was discussing the post and renewed his contract with the ensemble he has directed since 1979, the St.
Louis Symphony Orchestra.
Yet his ties to the Philharmonic seem to have grown stronger since Kurt Masur became music director.
This season, besides leading the Philharmonic's New Year's Eve gala, he conducted a subscription week in September and is now back for a three-week stay that ends on Jan. 21.
He is to return to conduct the orchestra again in March.
In April, he will conduct a run of Puccini's "Fanciulla del West" at the Metropolitan Opera.
And between now and then he will bring his own orchestra to Carnegie Hall for a pair of concerts in February.

Coaching Interviews In Full Gear in N.F.L.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Indianapolis Colts, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings yesterday continued their searches for new coaches.
SAM WYCHE, who roamed and fumed on the Bengals' sideline until a Christmas Eve falling out with the Cincinnati general manager, MIKE BROWN, was interviewed in Tampa, Fla., yesterday. (Wyche issued a statement in which he said NBC and CBS were also on his list.) The next chat scheduled for the Buccaneers' vacancy is with BUDDY RYAN, the former coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, on Monday.


Sports of The Times; The Menace That Looms In the N.B.A.
When Karl Malone made like Scarface Capone and ripped a hole in Isiah Thomas's head, it made people in the National Basketball Association and beyond take particular notice.
At least, it seemed to.
But Chuck Person, among others, was apparently otherwise occupied.
On Dec. 14, in Salt Lake City, Thomas, the 6-foot-1-inch, 185-pound guard for Detroit, drove in for a shot and Malone, the 6-9, 256-pound forward for Utah, defended his basket by going for the ball, he later said.
But he missed the ball -- the Mailman was obviously suffering an unaccountable lack of coordination at that moment -- and smashed Thomas in the forehead with his elbow, causing 40 stitches.
Thomas was sidelined for a week and missed three games.


Dow Up 29, Past 3,200
The stock market rally steamed further into uncharted territory yesterday, shoving the Dow Jones industrial average through the 3,200 level for the first time.
Just a week after passing 3,100, the Dow closed at 3,201.48, up 29.07 points.
Posting its sixth straight record, the Dow rode an initial spurt of buying and then climbed gradually, reaching 3,200 in the final hour of trading.
It was the Dow's 11th consecutive rise.

The Pet Cemetery Defense: Sloppiness, but Not Fraud
The lawyers for the two men accused of cremating dead animals en masse or throwing them into huge graves in the woods at the Long Island Pet Cemetery said yesterday that while their clients may have done these things, they had not broken the law.
Instead, the lawyers said in opening arguments in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the pet cemetery was simply a sloppily run business that tried to do too much and found itself overwhelmed by a lack of equipment and a burgeoning volume of animals that could not always be disposed of as promised.


Weyerhaeuser Taking Big Charge
The Weyerhaeuser Company said today that it would take year-end special charges and a credit that would reduce its 1991 after-tax earnings by about $344 million, or $1.70 a share.
The charges will result in Weyerhaeuser's first annual or quarterly loss since it began reporting in 1933.
"These actions should put a number of uncertainties behind us and allow the company to begin 1992 with a clean slate," said John W. Creighton, Weyerhaeuser's president and chief executive.


Chairman of Unilever To Replace Whitbread's
Whitbread P.L.C., the British drinks and leisure group, announced on Thursday that Samuel Whitbread, 54, will retire as chairman in July.
He will be replaced by Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Unilever P.L.C., the British-Dutch consumer products company.
Mr.
Whitbread, who has been chairman since 1984, said he was retiring "to have more time available for my many other public and private interests." He will continue as a non-executive director, a position he held for 12 years before becoming chairman in 1984.
Mr.
Whitbread's retirement coincides with the company's 250th anniversary.

Corrections
An article yesterday about a study of follow-up treatments for breast cancer referred incorrectly to one comparison of possible benefits of therapies in women of different ages.
The study suggested that tamoxifen in women over 50 years old (not under 50) produces as good an effect as chemotherapy.


Quotation of the Day

Corrections
A report in the Religion Notes column last Saturday about Roman Catholic Holy Days of Obligation referred incorrectly to the observance on Dec. 8 for which attendance at Mass will remain obligatory, regardless of the day of the week on which it falls.
It is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. (As noted elsewhere in the report, the Feast of the Assumption is observed on Aug. 15; for that day, if it falls on a Saturday or a Monday, the nation's bishops are proposing that the obligation to attend Mass be lifted.)

The lot of young actors in the Victorian theater was not an easy one, as is illustrated in a letter by Jerome K. Jerome (who later became a playwright and novelist), quoted in "Theatre in the Victorian Age" by Martin R. Booth (Cambridge University).
A stock company was organized on true repertory principles, which meant that the evening's bill could be frequently changed, and because there might be two or three pieces on the bill a new actor was faced with a bewildering and exhausting variety of parts. . . .
In the early 1880's Jerome K. Jerome wrote to a friend from a country theater about the two-week visit of a London star:
Francois Rabelais, the irreverent author of the satirical novel "Gargantua and Pantagruel," offered a surprising opinion to a friend who had asked what astronomers were predicting about the upcoming year of 1535.
His letter is included in "The Complete Works of Francois Rabelais," translated and edited by Donald M. Frame (University of California).
Summarily exposing to you about this year what I've been able to extract from the authors in the field, Arab and Latin. . . . in this year will come only machinations, carryings-on, bases, and seeds of the unhappiness to follow.
If we have good weather, that will be beyond the promise of the stars. . . .
That's what they say.
For my part, I say that if the . . . kings, princes, and communities hold in reverence the divine Word of God and according to that govern themselves and their subjects, then never in our time did we see a year more salubrious for bodies, more peaceful for souls, than this one will be: and we shall see the face of heaven, the covering of the earth, and the bearing of the people more joyous, merry, pleasant and benign, than it has been for fifty years back.
Dreaming About Going Home
We never forget the rooms in which we were raised, as Michael Ann Williams discovered from the elderly subjects she interviewed for a study of homes in the early 20th century.
This is from "Homeplace: The Social Use and Meaning of the Folk Dwelling in Southwestern North Carolina" (University of Georgia).
It is not the property or the landscape, any more than it is the physical structure, that is important.
The empty house site, or the empty house, is a symbol of the experience, or memories of the experience, of home. . . .
People who no longer have physical access to their homeplace seek solace in the power of narrative.
Through their stories people may still travel home.
Many of the narratives I heard had been polished over the years, as people studied on their pasts and gave shape to their experiences.
For the people who told them, the stories, too, were precious symbols of home.
For scholars these stories are also artifacts.
While many times I crossed snaky fields in high boots and crept gingerly across rotting porches to inspect old structures, the entrance to the home place, I found, was through these oral narratives.
The Natural Theater of the New
The art critic Robert Hughes, using Zurich's Cafe Odeon as an example, asserts that European cafes were the nurseries in which many of the most provocative, persistent elements of modern culture first emerged.
This is from "The Shock of the New" (Knopf, paper).
Today, the phrase "cafe intellectual" is a mild, obsolete insult.
Then, places like the Odeon were a medium of intellectual life, quite as much as the literary magazines.
People separated from the social order, by choice or not, needed the cafe as their study and opera house: a place to meet, work, argue, and display themselves.
It was a place for little groups, for specialists, where one met one's intellectual peers -- the essence of metropolitanism, and therefore of modernism, which in its self-referring ironies and sense of civilization was an urban sensibility, born in the cities, petering out in the country.
The cafes of Zurich, Berlin, Barcelona, Vienna, Milan and Paris were the natural home of exiles, and modernism was largely the creation of exiles and polyglots, from Picasso the Spaniard to Beckett the Irishman.
The Odeons, in short, were the natural theater of the new.
In them, the intellectuals, writers and artists could feel and behave like a class, the mandarins of change.
The Art of Asking Questions
The ornithologist Robert W. McFarlane reminds us that every advance in science begins with an exactly phrased question.
This is from "A Stillness in the Pines: The Ecology of the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker" (Norton).
Science, from one perspective, is the art of phrasing questions and identifying their attendant assumptions.
Its basic tenet is that nature has no secrets.
The obstacles to furthering knowledge lie in formulating the right questions and in circumventing ambiguous answers, never an easy task.
The best practitioners know that incisive questions and skillful analysis will ultimately yield their reward.
Artful questions may require new technology, often from unrelated disciplines.
New questions may require fresh insight, unencumbered by the baggage of past experience, and a probing mind to test old concepts.
The importance of the proper question is often overlooked, by experienced observer and novice alike.


Hilary E. Silver Is the Bride of David E. Zeltner
Hilary Ellen Silver, the director of affiliate sales for Travel Channel, a cable television channel in Mount Kisco, N.Y., and David Edward Zeltner, a New York lawyer, were married last evening at the Rainbow Room in New York by Rabbi Robert Summers.
The bride, 28 years old, graduated from the University of Georgia.
She is the daughter of Albert and Rose Silver of Coconut Creek, Fla.

Nassau Real-Estate Office Plagued by Bias Attacks
The telephone rang for Antonio Patino, whose small realty agency was riddled with shotgun blasts early New Year's Day.
It was another hate call.
"I have a problem because you let these niggers in and they downgrade the neighborhood," said the unidentified male caller on Friday.


Parents on The Front Line
"PARENTS are really working with their children," said Carla Weir, of the Dallas public schools, local sponsors of a program that in various forms has become a growing national movement.
The program coaches parents, especially in immigrant and minority neighborhoods, to teach their young children at home simple skills like shapes, colors and listening.
In Dallas, the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters, or Hippy, reaches 220 families.
Nationally, it has spread to 8,000 children ages 4 to 5 in 17 states since the effort, Hippy USA, was organized three years ago through the National Council of Jewish Women.


Bridge
When the American Contract Bridge League was founded in 1937 by merging two older organizations, its first executive secretary was William McKenney.
He donated a trophy to be awarded to the player with most tournament success in a calendar year, and the measure was the newfangled master point.
The most active experts on the tournament trail have been fighting to win "the McKenney" ever since.
They still refer to it that way, although the national body now prefers the term "Barry Crane Top 500" in honor of a Californian, a 1985 murder victim who won the title six times.


Corrections
The Data Update chart on page 10 of the Real Estate section today misstates the percentage change in housing starts and housing sales from October 1990 to October 1991.

Suddenly, Towns Fight To Keep Their Garbage
YEARS ago, the town of Babylon was so concerned about the dwindling space in its landfill that the supervisor himself patrolled the dump with a gun, turning away out-of-town garbage.
But now that the dump is closed and Babylon burns its trash in an incinerator, the town is finding itself in a strange and unforeseen situation: it wants all the garbage it can get.
It doesn't seem to make sense.
But Babylon's situation is being repeated throughout New York and New Jersey, and the reason lies in the changing nature of trash disposal in the garbage-glutted Northeast.
As alternatives dwindle and prices go up, municipalities are finding that the only way to pay for their new, expensive electricity-generating incinerators or recycling operations is to take in as much trash as possible and charge their residents hefty fees for dumping it.


Pennsylvania City Hopes It's Bouncing Back From the Bottom
This small city of 42,000 people, surrounded by the thriving middle-class suburbs west of Philadelphia, has one of the highest concentrations of urban problems in America.
Its schools and public housing rank among the worst, as do the city's rates for crime, joblessness, truancy, teen-age pregnancy and infant mortality.
Homelessness, drug abuse and AIDS are major problems.


The Man Paris Lines Up For (Even at Lunch Time)
One of the more remarkable sights in Paris this winter is the long line that forms outside the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris on the Avenue President Wilson.
Ever since the Pompidou Center was first opened, now close on 20 years ago, Paris's municipal museum of 20th-century art has been somewhat in the shadows.
But right now the line is there even at midday on Sunday, when Parisians find it hard not to sit down to lunch and even harder to get up from the table.
What draws them is the enormous exhibition of sculptures, paintings, drawings and lithographs by Alberto Giacometti that can be seen through March 15.
Giacometti's work is not, of course, an unknown quantity in the city in which he spent the greater part of his life.
There must be very few people with any interest in 20th-century art who do not know of his work since World War II -- for example, the elongated and slenderized sculptures of young women (such as "Four Women on a Base" from 1950).
Equally familiar are the rugged busts of men (above all, his brother and best model, Diego) and the paintings and drawings in which he looked at face after face, year after year, and sought to say the unsayable.
Where other artists found so-called inspiration in travel, Giacometti stayed in one place, looked fixedly at one face over and over again and thought the world well lost.

Ships Avoid Yugoslavia
Most -- but not all -- cruise ships that normally make calls at Yugoslav ports are steering clear of Dubrovnik, Split and Korcula and substituting more Greek and Italian ports because of Yugoslavia's civil war.
Royal Cruise Line, for example, has decided to substitute the Greek island of Corfu and Messina (the port for Taormina), Sicily, for visits to Dubrovnik and Korcula.
The changes will apply to the entire year, according to Carol McRonald, vice president-marketing.
The ships involved are the Crown Odyssey and the Golden Odyssey.

U.S. Lifts Ban On Travel To Vietnam
The United States has lifted the ban on American travel to Vietnam.
The easing of a decades-old trade embargo clears the way for American travel agents to arrange individual and group tours there.
The Administration also lifted its prohibition on American travel companies booking hotel accommodations, local tours or transportation for Vietnamese visiting the United States..
One of the first cruise companies to offer visits to Vietnam to Americans, following the lifting of restrictions, is Salen Lindblad Cruising.
The company had been marketing its program mainly in Britain.

It's Like Strudel Without the Filling
THE new offering at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale, "In One Bed . . . and Out the Other," makes a vain attempt at being a frothy turn-of-the-century romantic farce in the manner of Schnitzler's "Ronde." The authors, Mawby Green and Ed Feilbert, have concocted nothing more substantial than a strudel without the filling.
The slim plot centers on a novelist named Didier, who has fallen in love with a married woman.
He devises a plan to meet her and then have her husband invite him to stay as a house guest.
Didier's best friend, Maurice, is posing as a butler to help expedite the affair.

Computer Companies Say State Tax Hampers Them
PAUL M. COFONI, vice president of Computer Sciences Corporation and manager of its center in Norwich, sees big growth for his industry in the next few years, he said.
But he is not sure whether any of that growth will be in Connecticut, he said, because the state puts a 6 percent tax on computer services.
During the next three years the total spent nationwide on computer services will grow to $15 billion from $7 billion, Mr.
Cofoni said.
"If we're successful, and we know we will be, we'll have a major share of that," he said.
But he cannot predict how many of those new jobs will be in Connecticut, he said, or whether the 500 jobs the company has in the state now will still be around.

Organizer of Fatal Rap Event Is Hip-Hop Maestro
Five days after nine young people were crushed to death at a celebrity basketball game at City College, the man who organized the game's star-studded roster of rap players made his first public appearance.
Baby-faced and thin, Sean Combs, who is known in the rap world as Puff Daddy, faced a barrage of reporters and cameras in an ornate, gilded salon of the Plaza Hotel.
His voice quivering and his head slightly bowed, Mr.
Combs, 22 years old, said he was deeply hurt by the deaths. 'In addition to sponsoring a profitable event," he said, "my dream for this evening was to bring a positive program to my people, to people of my age and to people of my community."

FLASHCARD
THREE college freshmen in 10 took at least one remedial course in the fall of 1989.
Twenty-one percent took remedial mathematics, 16 percent writing and 13 percent reading, according a survey of colleges and universities released by The National Center for Education Statistics.
Three-quarters of the institutions surveyed offered at least one remedial course during the 1989 fall semester, a decrease from the 82 percent found in a similar survey taken in 1983.
About 20 percent of the schools awarded degree credit for remedial courses.


A Sampling of India's Great Legacy of Art
VAST and slightly dusty halls, unexpected objects and great numbers of masterpieces -- the Prince of Wales Museum in Bombay today feels like the survivor of another era.
Art, in the 19th century, seemed less awe-inspiring (even if it was no less revered); the cultured viewer could be trusted to recognize what he saw, and the deluge of learning aids that cover the walls of modern institutions had yet to come.
Although the Prince of Wales Museum was founded in 1906 and opened in 1921, its organization and its appearance place it firmly in an earlier era.
There is neither dramatic lighting nor lengthy labeling (on occasion there is no labeling at all); but the observant visitor is offered a sample of some of the best sculpture and painting ever produced in India.
Because many American visitors arrive in Bombay, the museum can also serve as a concise introduction to some of the marvels ahead.
The very style of the building, in fact, is an important part of the experience.
A curious but highly successful blend of two apparently contradictory styles, the Indo-Saracenic and the Scottish Baronial, the exterior of the museum is as appealing as it is improbable.
Bow windows and a neo-Gothic porte-cochere give way to arcades and a vast onion dome borrowed from the 17th-century Gol Gumbz in Bijapur.
Brick, stone and faience tiles (an addition made in the last few years) continue the 19th-century tradition of polychrome architecture.
Like the neighboring Victoria Terminal, the Prince of Wales Museum, in its amiable flamboyance, ends up by looking prototypically Indian.


28 Years After Kennedy's Assassination, Conspiracy Theories Refuse to Die
Nearly three decades after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the film director Oliver Stone has revitalized an American obsession with conspiracies.
Mr.
Stone's movie "J.F.K." liberally mixes fiction with fact, and some have dismissed it as an outrageous distortion of history.
But the monstrous web of political, government and corporate interests that the film portrays as being behind the killing does reflect widely held suspicions that more than a single gunman was responsible for the slaying.


The Bad Boy of Insurance Ratings
Executives at the Travelers Corporation were horrified.
In August, analysts at Weiss Research Inc., an insurance-rating firm, assigned a "weak" rating to Travelers's life-insurance subsidiary.
The rating, reflecting the company's outsized portfolio of troubled real estate loans, touched off a wave of telephone calls to Travelers from jittery policyholders and agents.
So in September, a team of Travelers executives boarded the company's private jet and flew to Weiss Research's headquarters here in an attempt to get the rating changed.
As a pair of stretch limousines stood idling outside, the executives tried to persuade Weiss analysts that Travelers had ample capital to weather its difficulties.
But despite two hours of tense negotiations, the analysts, who use an A-to-F grading system, agreed only to raise their rating to C-, from D+.


CAMPUS LIFE: Connecticut College; Group Celebrates Fashion of Funk, Less the Alcohol
It may be 1992, but for many Connecticut College students here, it is still the 1970's.
Their Undisputed Funk Organization, which, despite its initials, has nothing to do with unidentified flying objects, has revived appreciation of funk music and fashion fads of that decade, celebrating them at alcohol-free social events on campus.
Begun last semester by Andre Lee, a junior from Philadelphia, and Robert Marbury, a junior from Baltimore, the group has 224 members from the college, which has 1,710 students.
Events are open to the entire campus.


Mother Teresa Is Improving
Mother Teresa's condition was upgraded from serious to fair today as she continued a slow recuperation from pneumonia, doctors said.
The 81-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who entered the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation on Dec. 26, is no longer suffering chest pain or an irregular heartbeat, Dr.
Patricia Aubanel said.
She said Mother Teresa was slightly anemic and suffering protein deficiency, possibly from eating only the food of the poor she has devoted her life to helping.

POSTINGS: Saratoga Square; New Site for Houses
Three years ago, in accepting City Hall's plan to house several hundred homeless people in the area between Bedford-Stuyvesant and Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn insisted on a broader solution to the crisis.
"What we were trying to push for was a neighborhood approach," Mr.
Golden's executive assistant, Marilyn Gelber, said last week.
"Yes, we'd approve a considerable number of homeless units but it was more important that it be part of a balanced plan."

The sauce for this lamb dish is all-purpose: it will taste as good with chicken or duck or pork.
Because of the dish's North African accent, couscous is an appropriate grain, but rice would make as good a base.


Searching for Revival Signs In Oil Prices
As the United States enters 1992, the signs of economic revival are clearly visible on Wall Street, where stock prices regularly hit new highs.
Unfortunately, that completes the list of places where strength seems especially visible.
Manufacturing, which in mid-1991 was hailed as the island of activity that would lead the revival, has since fallen on hard times.
Consumers were cautious at Christmas, auto sales are miserable and the Government's leading indicators have once again begun to fall.


Talking: Small Co-ops; Shopping Around to Refinance
IT'S always difficult for a New York City co-op in a brownstone or other structure with less than 20 shareholders to find a lender willing to refinance the underlying mortgage, especially for under $500,000.
Even in the best of times -- which these are not -- most bankers shun such loans.


Let the Students Really Live the Homeless Life
Though well intentioned, it was folly for 40 college students to sleep overnight in a cardboard box to "understand the plight of the homeless"  [ Long Island Journal, Dec. 8 ]  One student slept on an air mattress near his TV, the teacher wore longjohns, and one arranged his tent "so the wind would pass over me." There was a convenient bathroom nearby, and surely all of them had a decent supper.
This sanitized expedition hardly parallels the conditions the homeless endure, many sleeping in crime-infested alleys, malnourished, suffering physical and emotional ills with no future.
These students can never be totally immersed in their plight unless they spend time with them as participant observers.
Let them feed them with the money they collected, interview them and study and analyze their predicament.
Let them tape the voices of these Americans who have lost their way in our once-proud, boastful nation that now offers few solutions for them to survive.
Let them experience compassion for these victims of society.
Let them protest after their study, to our political leaders and learn about the twisted priorities in our bureaucracy.
Let them trace the steps of the homeless in the blind alley where it began and let them find a few points of light.
Only when they weep for them, will they see the thin line between the plight of the homeless and their own fate.

Overworked Dramatic License
To the Editor:
Once again Oliver Stone is playing fast and loose with the truth.
In his previous film he presented a portrait of Jim Morrison that bore little resemblance to the leader of the Doors.
In "Born on the Fourth of July," he had Ron Kovic being assaulted by Syracuse police, an episode that never occurred, as well as creating a fictional soldier from a fictional town (Venus, Ga.) who supposedly inspired Mr.
Kovic to join the antiwar movement.

Run, Dance and Be Noisy
TUESDAY, NEW YEAR'S EVE -- The Grand Central Partnership sponsored First Night New York a family-centered alcohol-free celebration.
The participants, who paid $9, could take part in 40 cultural events over a 12-hour period at 20 sites in midtown.
The grand finale saw the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal turned into a giant ballroom as dance bands and the Orchestra of St.
Luke's provided music ranging from swing to Strauss waltzes.
Even commuters and passers-through paused to join the high stepping in the terminal.
In Central Park that same evening, imagination was uncorralled as several thousand runners took part in a costumed midnight race under a sky bright with fireworks.

Items to Augment a Basic Tool Kit
MANY home repair tasks can be accomplished with only a basic kit of tools: tape measure, claw hammer, crosscut saw, hack saw, regular and Phillips-head screwdrivers, pliers, adjustable wrench and electric drill.
But owning some other tools can broaden the range of jobs one can do and make some familiar chores easier.
Following is a list of tools to augment a basic kit.
To save money, buy tools only as needed.


Camera
Last week Greg Heisler's electronic portrait of Ted Turner, with a globe made up of television images, appeared on the cover of Time magazine.
Incorporating 44 transparencies put together with a computer, it was printed as a single image.
For the first time in his career, Mr.
Heisler, a freelance photographer who lives in New York City, had turned in an electronic cassette to a client, rather than a print or transparency.
At the Atlanta airport, travelers are greeted by a huge photographic display: two Atlanta Braves baseball players, one on each side of the city's skyline at night.
The display, put up during the playoffs last fall, is one of William Samenko's contributions to the new art of electronic imaging.
The digitalized image, 16 1/2 by 4 feet, was made by combining three separate images, then printed conventionally on Duratrans display film.


Lisa Giacoio Is Wed
Lisa Anne Giacoio, a daughter of Grace L. Giacoio of Surfside, Fla., and Anthony Giacoio of Kinnelon, N.J., was married yesterday to Timothy John Egan, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph V. Egan of New Brunswick, N.J.
Msgr.
William J. Capik officiated at the Seton Hall University chapel in South Orange, N.J.
The bride, 28 years old, graduated from Seton Hall, as did the bridegroom.
She is a systems analyst for Ballet Makers Inc., a dancewear manufacturer in Totowa, N.J.
Mr.
Egan, 29, is an investment banker at First Fidelity Securities group in Newark and has a law degree and an M.B.A. from Seton Hall.


Fundamentals Of Self-Esteem
IT was difficult to keep straight -- the busy lives, interests and sweaters of the 16 children in Jo Ann Sokoloff's prekindergarten program at P.S. 254 in Brooklyn.
Ryan Carbonara, 4 years old, for instance, had moussed his hair.
Amy Liu had a new little sister.
And Amanda Diaro wanted to share something very special.

Wall Street; Pinkerton's Liability Wild Cards
The stampede in New York at a City University gymnasium that left nine people dead and 29 others injured points up a growing problem for the nation's 10,000 security firms and the people who rely on their protection: events that draw big crowds may desperately require the know-how of professional security firms, but many companies shun the work because of the risk of getting sued over a disturbance.
The nation's largest security company, Pinkerton's Inc., and third-ranked Wackenhut Corporation routinely cede crowd-control work to what analysts rank as the No. 2 rival, the Burns International Security Services, a unit of the Borg-Warner Corporation, or to smaller rivals like Command Security Corporation in Legrangeville, N.Y.


For a Limited Time Only: The Presidential Primary Season
FIRST there were no candidates willing to enter the race.
Then a non-candidate, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, stole the limelight.
Then the holidays came, and who had time to worry about a bunch of Presidential contenders slogging around in New Hampshire?
Now 1992 has arrived and it seems as if the race for the Democratic nomination is just beginning.
In fact, it's almost over.


Home Entertainment; New Rivals Target DAT
Once again the audio industry reaches into its seemingly bottomless bag of high-tech tricks.
Its publicity proclaims that 1992 will be a year for radical innovation, with at least two new methods for digital home recording to be unveiled.
The public, naturally, is expected to jump with anticipation and have the cash ready.
Remembering the heady 80's, the industry seems convinced that audio buyers can never resist novelty.
Dealers are less optimistic.
In any case, here are the audio developments on tap for the new year.


Image Is a Serious Matter
To the Editor:
Perhaps I am misreading the tone of "Image-Making, From Soup to Sales Pitch." But the need for executives to be aware of the image they project to others is more crucial, especially in these days of downsizing, than your playful tone implies.


UKRAINE BIDS FLEET TO SWEAR LOYALTY
Ukraine has ordered the entire Black Sea Fleet and all ground forces based on the republic's soil to take an oath of loyalty to Ukraine, a move that has roused ominous new tensions with Russia and within the military.
So far, the command of the Black Sea Fleet, which has its headquarters in Sevastopol in the Crimea, has refused to administer the oath, arguing that Ukraine agreed in forming the new Commonwealth of Independent States to leave the Navy under joint commonwealth command.


Commercial Property: Exhibition Halls; Coliseum, Pronounced Dead, Looks for Extra Cash
MAYOR Robert F. Wagner, who usually knew what he was talking about, called the New York Coliseum "one of the wonders of the modern world" when he opened it in April 1956.
So it might have seemed premature -- if not presumptuous -- to declare it dead at the age of 29.
As it turns out, the obituaries were a bit early.
Rather than crumble under demolition or fade into obscurity, the exhibition hall has been reviving.
This weekend it is the site of the New York Coliseum Antiques Show, one of the largest events to be held there since it closed "forever" in March 1986.


Conditioned Response
To the Editor:
Perhaps Oliver Stone, in "J. F. K.," is giving us nothing more nor less than we have come to expect of the popular media.
For many years, television has presented us with news as entertainment.
Mr.
Stone now gives us an entertainment disguised as news.
The line between the two, already blurred, may disappear completely in another generation.

More Pressure For Access to Insurance
"Removing Hurdles to Buying Health Insurance"  [ Dec. 8 ] , while correctly suggesting that some barriers to health coverage may be falling, could have done more to tell Long Islanders what they can do to make medical benefits accessible to all.
The Empire Blue Cross open-enrollment plans, which are available to those able to pay the premiums, are in financial jeopardy.
Legislation in Albany would preserve the plans by restricting the unfair underwriting practices of commercial insurers, who would no longer be able to reject unhealthy subscribers.


Sea Kayaks
To the Editor: In reference to your article "Kayaking in the Seas Off Belize" by David Noland (Nov. 10), I did not find identification of the type of sea kayak used on this expedition.
In addition to the rigid kayaks available, there is the Klepper folding kayak, which can be packed into two bags and carried anywhere.
Equipped with sail, Kleppers have crossed the Atlantic and raced down the Colorado River.
The advantage of the Klepper is that you can take your own boat and fly anywhere on the globe and even though it is a sea kayak, you can still set it down on any river or lake.
The design principle, a rigid frame supporting a flexible hull, originated with the early Aleutian Eskimos.
BUDD BAILIN Hartsdale, N.Y.
Cully Erdman, president of Slickrock Adventures of Moab, Utah, which outfitted Mr.
Noland's trip, comments
: David Noland used a double kayak, the Seascape I by Northwest Kayak.
Two types of single kayak were also used, the Chinook and the Sealion, both by Perception.
I have seen Klepper kayaks used off Belize, but because they have soft shells, they are not as high-performance, and require more effort to paddle.


Visionaries Rewarded By Growth of Ski Clubs
IT was on a steely cold winter Saturday afternoon, seated before his television in Roselle Park, that John Czyzewski decided he could not watch one more rerun of "Gilligan's Island." He opted instead to take advantage of the season and become a skier.
In readiness to help those new to the sport, along with meeting the needs of advanced skiers, 44 ski clubs with a roster of 10,000 members are based in New Jersey.


Survey Finds 25 Homes Tainted by Radium
After an unusual house-by-house search in 11 communities for buildings constructed with sand that had been laced with radioactive radium, a Federal agency said Friday that it had found 25 contaminated homes, including four in this western suburb of Philadelphia.
The Government offered to relocate 13 families whose homes were found to have excessively high levels of contamination.
It said one of the most extensively tainted properties was found here, with a contamination level 23 times that considered acceptable.


Managing; Nice Degree - Go Away and Use It
A leading employer here is financing higher education for its workers.
But instead of welcoming them back once they've earned their degrees, it tells them it never wants to see them again.
The novel plan, developed by Canadian Tire stores in the Vancouver area, is in contrast to programs of many large companies, which typically strive to retain employees after paying for their advanced degrees and fret if they decide to quit.


CAMPUS LIFE: Wisconsin; Planning Circle of Cities To Aid the Environment
A professor of landscape architecture at the University of Wisconsin at Madison not only has a design for the urban future but is planning a way to make it come true as well.
The professor, Philip Lewis, says he envisions a core of natural resources around which cities would be formed.
For example, there would be such a core in southwestern Wisconsin.
The cities around it would be Milwaukee, Chicago, Minneapolis, St.
Paul and Des Moines.

Her mother, Phyllis Klein, is the administrative secretary of the Central Island Nursing Home in Plainview, L.I.


Simms Is Better
To the Sports Editor:
Is Ray Handley the only person in the world who still thinks Jeff Hostetler is a better quarterback than Phil Simms?
It's one thing to want to be the boss, but to be pigheaded just to satisfy one's own ego is another matter.

Smaller Craft Are Biggest News at the Boat Show
The boating market continues to reel from a two-year slowdown made worse by a widening recession.
But a glimmer of light still flickers in the ailing industry, sustained by sales of the ever-popular 16-foot outboard runabout.
Organizers of the New York National Boat Show, which begins Saturday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, have addressed boaters' slimmer wallets and general skittishness with plans to exhibit a variety of craft that fit the small-boat niche.
Among them will be ski boats, small aluminum fishing boats, day sailers and cruising boats.
Costs can be expected to vary between about $5,000 to $10,000.


Coins
Some of the smallest and strangest United States coins are the territorial fractional gold pieces of the mid-19th century.
These quarter- and half-dollar pieces, minted in various areas of the West, became so popular that even after they were outlawed, reproductions kept appearing until the beginning of this century.
Now a luscious collection of California fractional gold pieces is to be auctioned in Orlando, Fla., this Friday by Bowers and Merena Inc. of Wolfeboro, N.H.
The fractional coins replaced the pinches of gold dust and tiny nuggets that circulated throughout California after the 1849 gold rush.
Coins that are widely recognized and trusted for their weight and purity are a tremendous convenience; trading in gold dust or nuggets required an accurate scale and a means of testing for purity.
Mints normally fulfill those needs, but they were not available in California before 1854.
Private foundries filled that void instead.


Eastern Germans Still Flocking West for Jobs
In a troubling continuation of migration patterns that led to the collapse of the old Communist East German state, more than 200,000 citizens of Germany's eastern regions migrated to the west in the nation's first full year of unification, most of them in search of jobs or better pay, according to figures released here today.
The figures, based in part on projections, show that from July to September 1991, an average of 20,000 eastern Germans left each month to go west in search of work.


Sellout With Rangers Is a Rarity for Devils
The Devils had more than one reason to be eagerly awaiting their game with the Rangers at Byrne Meqdowlands Arena tonight.
They are seeking redemption from two losses to the Rangers at Madison Square Garden earlier this season and they will have their first sellout of the season here.


Coming: Telephone Calls That Follow You Around
EARLY one chilly morning in Washington last month, a kind of gold fever swept the halls of the Federal Communications Commission.
Elbow to elbow in the agency's main hearing room -- and in two overflow rooms where latecomers watched on television -- lawyers, lobbyists, consultants and hangers-on attended a hearing on an arcane and little-known area of telecommunications that they hope will dwarf the nearly $6 billion a year market for cellular telephones.
So new and ill-defined is the technology that it goes by two names: personal communications networks and personal communications services.
In this jargon-loving industry, the cognoscenti say "P.C.N.-slash-P.C.S."


South Africa's Trek to Democracy
Only in a world jaded by dramatic change would the earthquake in South Africa occasion so little astonishment.
The country's first interracial convention is now striving to bring about what would have seemed impossible a few years ago, a multiparty democracy, a common citizenship and no discrimination.
Prospects for achieving these goals are realistic enough to provoke increased violence by die-hard opponents of compromise.
Think for a moment of the blood and tears it took to convene this Convention for a Democratic South Africa, known as Codesa.
For most of this century, white South Africans have been deaf to demands for rudimentary racial justice.
After blacks formed the African National Congress in 1912, a white-ruled Parliament responded by limiting African land ownership to tribal reserves -- the first big step to total apartheid.


Reporter's Notebook; For Bush, Jog Overseas Beats Running at Home
After President Bush took his morning jog New Year's Day at a college in Sydney, Australia, someone asked whether he had made any resolutions.
He responded, as expected, with pledges to work for peace and prosperity and a slightly faster two miles around the track.
And then he said something revealing.
"I'll tell you something," he said.
"We are blessed with family, with kids that come home, and with the loyalty and strength that one gets when one is in public life from sons and a daughter. And so I don't have to ask for any more there, but if I were, I would simply say 'Keep it strong, Lord, because we're going into one hell of a year over there.' It's politics from tomorrow on. And it isn't very pleasant."


Islanders' Injuries Pile Up In Defeat
A visit to Memorial Auditorium on Friday night left the Islanders with one more defeat and three more injuries.
The Sabres beat them, 5-2, as Aleksandr Mogilny scored three goals.
Pat LaFontaine, an old acquaintance not to be forgotten, had three assists for the Sabres in his first game against his old team.


New Business Would be Nice But So Would Breaking Even
OF all the departures by city officials at this mid-point in the Dinkins administration, the one that is likely to prove most significant is that of the deputy mayor of finance and economic development, Sally Hernandez-Pinero.
With businesses threatening daily to leave the city, unemployment at over 10 percent and pervasive doubts about the city's ability to compete with other urban centers, the person who charts the next round of economic development policies could have great influence over the direction of the city.


Mary McDaniel To Wed in June
Mr. and Mrs.
John S. McDaniel Jr. of Baltimore have announced the engagement of their daughter Mary Perine McDaniel to Richard Oliver Chapman, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Ned Chapman of Raleigh, N.C.
A June wedding is planned.
Miss McDaniel, 29 years old, is a corporate bond analyst at Fidelity Investments in Boston.
She graduated from Harvard University and has an M.B.A. degree from Cornell University.
Her father is a partner in Baltimore with the Richmond law firm of McGuire, Woods, Battle &amp; Boothe.
Her mother, Emily McDaniel, who is a retired, was a psychiatric social worker.

Mr. and Mrs.
James F. Richardson of Rye, N.Y., have announced March wedding plans for their daughter, Cynthia Anne Richardson, and Douglas Joseph Ryan, a son of Mrs.
Erwin B. Chark of Rye and Joseph Donal Ryan of Marblehead, Mass.
Miss Richardson, 27 years old, is an advertising account executive at Gannett Suburban Newspapers in White Plains.
She graduated from Kenyon College.
Her father is a stockbroker at Wertheim Schroder in New York.


Abroad at Home; Metaphor For Failure
President Bush's visit to Japan this week, with his entourage of business executives, is a metaphor for what ails America.
There in a neat package are symbols of corporate failure, social division and lame political response.
The most prominent businessmen in the delegation are the leaders of the U.S. auto industry: the C.E.O.'s of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
And what is their message to Japan and the world?
That when an American leads his company into disastrous losses, his response is to whine about the competition and indulge his personal greed.


A Growing Leadership Role for Women
WHEN Dorcas T. Helfant took her first job selling homes in a small real estate office in Portsmouth, Va., in the mid-60's, she was the only person on the sales team who wore a skirt.
"I was surrounded by men in my first sales job," said Mrs.
Helfant, speaking from the vantage point of nearly 25 years in the residential brokerage business.


Series of Attacks on Policemen Worries Pretoria
A series of attacks on the police has left five policemen dead and at least two others wounded so far this year, with guerrillas loyal to a militant black group saying they committed two of the killings.
The refusal of the militant group, the Pan-Africanist Congress, to criticize the killings claimed by its supporters has raised the prospect of a bloody year for the police, whose death toll is rising as apartheid is dismantled.


A Multimedia Education
ONLY A FEW years ago, multimedia presentations were big-stage, big-screen productions involving dancers, actors and musicians -- live and on tape -- slides, a sound track, stage effects and probably a laser light or two.
Much of the machinery was computer-controlled.
Now multimedia has miniaturized; it is both practical and affordable for schools.
Teachers can easily integrate words, sounds, pictures and video (both live and animation) to produce lessons that dazzle the eye, razzle the ear and capture the imagination of students.


Making a Difference; The Hedgehog Takes Hold
Final numbers are not yet in, but Sega Enterprises Ltd. is already boasting that 1991 will be remembered in the world of video games as the year that Sonic the Hedgehog left Super Mario in the dust.
The speedy blue porcupine has become the most popular character in Sega's Genesis video-game line, which went head-to-head this Christmas with archrival Nintendo's new Super Nintendo machine.
A victory at Christmas could make Sega the standard in the new generation of video games, which are based on 16-bit computer chips, analysts say.


Birds Contribute Color to a Lively Yard
PERHAPS it is their sweet sound.
Or their bright colors or just their presence.
But feeding birds is always a plus.
One of the best ways to be sure they will come to the yard is to supply their favorite foods, especially if the winter is harsh.
This custom is also a way to learn what species are about.
To reinforce this process, keep a bird guide near the window to identify that chance rare one that may come around.
Also, keep binoculars in a convenient place for a quick grab.
These magnifiers are handy because sometimes it is difficult to detect that eye line or wing patch.
Having said all this, there still are a few pointers to keep in mind.


Close on Coaches
The music in the National Football League Coaches Scramble is slowing down, and it's becoming clearer who will get chairs and who won't.
CHUCK KNOX is apparently the man the Los Angeles Rams want.
TOM FLORES, the Seattle general manager, appears ready to name himself to replace Knox as the Seahawks coach, especially after University of Miami Coach DENNIS ERICKSON said he was flattered but not interested in moving to Seattle.
The details: After the Rams interviewed MIKE HOLMGREN, the San Francisco offensive coordinator, news leaked out yesterday via the Los Angeles Times that the Rams' owner, GEORGIA FRONTIERE, is expected to meet with Knox next week to offer him the job for a salary in the mid-$500,000 range.
Knox made more than $900,000 in his final year at Seattle.


Ms. Schulman Has Wedding
Helen Schulman, a novelist and teacher, and Bruce Handy, also a writer, both in New York, were married last evening at Michael Wager's Loft in New York.

David Schulman of New York.
The bridegroom is a son of Marlene Bogel Handy of Stanford, Calif., and the late Ralph Handy Jr.

Writer Distorts Modern Psychiatry
I am disturbed by the publication of Ms.
Inyard's letter, "Lobotomy as Ancestor of Psychosurgery"  [ Letters, Dec. 8 ] .
As a self-proclaimed "psychiatric survivor" who "seeks alternatives to traditional psychiatric services," she clearly presents a biased and unsubstantiated viewpoint of modern psychiatry.
The belief that physicians would perform psychosurgery on the mentally ill merely to insure that these patients would be unable to contribute to society is absurd.
Psychosurgery is a treatment of last resort reserved for those persons whose mental illness is resistant to standard treatments.
There is no evidence to believe that any reputable psychiatrist would seek to harm a patient or to reduce their ability to contribute to society.


Where Was The Fourth Estate?
To the Editor:
While Tom Wicker may be right in his assertion that Oliver Stone's "J. F. K." represents an absurdly vehement presentation of one possible version of events, his condemnation of it for being a movie, and thus a powerful former of opinion, strikes me as false and disingenuous  [ "Does 'J. F. K.' Conspire Against Reason?," Dec. 15 ] .


Mary Hall to Marry
Mr. and Mrs.
James Preston Hall Jr. of Greenville, S.C., have announced June wedding plans for their daughter, Mary Carolyn Hall, and David Loring Titus, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Miss Hall is a certified public accountant at Elliott, Davis &amp; Company, C.P.A.'s in Greenville.
Mr.
Titus is a sales representative for General Equipment and Supply in Greenville.


New Yorkers, etc.
Tony Aylward, a movie fan since he was tall enough to reach the cashier's booth at Loews Paradise in the Bronx where he grew up, remembers his favorite movie candy as vividly as the films themselves.
"No doubt about it," he recently recalled.
"Dots and Jujyfruits were definitely the best."
Why Dots and Jujyfruits??
"They're soft and they're quiet candies," said Mr.
Aylward, an actor.
His parents, he said, had always encouraged him to respect the rights of others, and that included the right to enjoy movies in peaceful, relatively food-free surroundings.
Then, quicker than it takes to say "bon appetit," things changed.


Tricia Emery To Wed in June
Mr. and Mrs.
John C. Emery Jr. of Darien, Conn., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Patricia Millar Emery, to Geoffrey Baker McGean, the son of J. Michael McGean of Norwich, Vt., and the late Lois Waring McGean.
A June wedding is planned.
Miss Emery, who is known as Tricia, is 28 years old.
She graduated from Lake Forest College and is a nursing student at Boston College.
Her father, who is retired, was the chairman, president and chief executive of Emery Air Freight in Stamford, Conn.


Tailored Learning
AT FIDALGO Elementary School in Anacortes, Wash., a class of third graders and fourth graders are playing with blocks.
They may seem a little old for this activity, but then they seem a little young to be handling file folders marked with incomprehensible acronyms.
The blocks, in unusual shapes, are used as spatial reasoning tools in Fidalgo's Structures Of Intellect program; the folders contain class exercises for each student.


For Physicians, a Public Service Incentive
To the Editor:
In "High Cost of Training" (letter, Dec. 10), Nina Stuzen, a medical student, concurs that Americans could benefit from a health care system that provides primary care for all, but states that because she will be $125,000 in debt upon graduation, she will not pursue a career as a family physician.
If, she states, "primary care is to be a priority in this country, it's time we took a look at the financial burden of medical school." I concur, and am pleased to inform her that the Government has done so.


Hooked on Ad Claims
AMERICANS are used to being inundated with slick commercials for beer, fast food and cars, so it was probably just a matter of time until a company like Gateway Educational Products tried the approach with one of its product lines, "Hooked on Phonics."
The insistent advertising campaign has worked, if one accepts the privately held company's sales claims.
Gateway, which is based in Orange, Calif., says that more than 500,000 consumers have dialed 1-800-ABCDEFG to order "Hooked on Phonics," a $179.95 collection of tape cassettes, cards and workbooks.
But Does It Work?

Mr. Bush's Road Show Hits the Pacific


The Computer As Catalyst
A FRIEND who works at home discovered one morning that his personal computer's diskette drive would not accept a disk.
His 3-year-old son observed him snarling and muttering as he tried repeatedly, without success, to get the computer to accept the disk.
"Maybe there's a penny in the hole," the child suggested.
Sure enough, dad spied a penny in the narrow slot and eventually extracted it with tweezers.
The drive still wouldn't take the disk.


TUNIS CHIEF CALLS FOR ARAB REPRESSION OF MILITANTS
The president of Tunisia, a determined opponent of Islamic fundamentalists in his own country who had been warily watching neighboring Algeria's march toward a fundamentalist government, today called on other Arab countries to repress Muslim militants who use religion as a cover to gain power.
President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, in an address to interior ministers of 16 Arab countries who are in Tunis to review, among other things, ways of cooperating against Islamic militancy, told the security chiefs: "We must combine our efforts to struggle against this phenomenon, which is grave for our Arab-Islamic society, by groups using violence and sedition."
While Mr.
Ben Ali did not mention Algeria, his remarks indicate the degree of alarm among many Arab chiefs of state - including those of Egypt, Morocco, Jordan and Saudi Arabia - about the rising tide of militant fundamentalism.


GRADY'S GIFT
Howell Raines's article "Grady's Gift" (Dec. 1) is a grand tribute to Grady Hutchinson, but more than that, it is a tribute to the many other women who have been confined by time and circumstance to jobs beneath their abilities.
My family greatly benefited from the wisdom of Beulah Wells and Beulah Groves, and my children, like Howell Raines, are grateful for that gift and for continuing friendships with these women.

Rhonda Lupin Has Wedding
Rhonda Beth Lupin, a daughter of Saul and Marlene Lupin of Short Hills, N.J., was married last night to Ilan Nissan, the son of Charles and Esperance Nissan of Dix Hills, L.I.
Rabbi Barry Friedman officiated at the Short Hills Hilton.
Mrs.
Nissan, 27 years old, is a retail sales associate at Bear Stearns &amp; Company Inc. in New York.
She graduated from Simmons College.
Her father is a senior partner in the accounting firm of Smolin, Lupin &amp; Company Inc. in West Orange, N.J.


GAME SHOW
I began reading Bryan Miller's Food column "Game Show" (Dec. 8) with interest, since my twin sister had her wedding reception at Perona Farms in 1981.
My interest soon turned to disbelief and disgust.
The description of the nearly all-male banquet -- a 45-course meal, consisting of slaughtered animals prepared in a variety of casseroles and pates, with hunting videos shown for entertainment -- was bad enough.
The ensuing description of these happy hunters roasting woodcock heads over wax candles as they were urged to "suck out those delicious little brains -- and theeyes, too, if you want to" was enough to make even Stephen King recoil in horror.
Perhaps King can use Perona Farms for his next book -- "Nightmare at Perona Farms"?

Dr. Venturini Engaged to Richard A. M. Smith
Mr. and Mrs.
Carl A. Picha of Somers, N.Y., have announced June wedding plans for Mrs.
Picha's daughter Dr.
Catherine Mary Venturini and Richard Antony Marston Smith, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Brian Smith of London.
Dr.
Venturini, 30 years old, is a postdoctoral fellow in pharmacology at Wellcome Research Laboratories in London.
She is also a daughter of the late Robert Venturini.
Mr.
Smith, 28, is a research engineer at the Defense Research Agency in Sevenoaks, England.


Recalling an Era When Ornateness Was All the Rage
If visitors to the new galleries of 19th-century European sculpture and decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art would itemize their favorite objects, probably no two lists would be the same.
"It would even be true of the lists I'd make on different days," said James David Draper, the curator in charge of the selection and organization of items in the new Iris and B. Gerald Cantor galleries, three permanent spaces named for the donors.


Salvador War Ends for U.S. And Rebels
The occasion was short on ceremony, but hours after El Salvador's Government and leftist guerrillas reached an agreement on Wednesday to end their civil war, the United States made its peace with the rebels, too.
Bernard W. Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, was sitting with a colleague in the Lantern, a coffee shop on East 42d Street that advertises "Egg and Cheese on a Roll with Coffee" for $1.50, when in walked a Salvadoran guerrilla commander who goes by the nom de guerre Raul Hercules.
So they had breakfast.


Wall Street; Lean Times Ahead in the High-Tech Nursery?
Last year was a lush one for the startup side of the computer industry, with a host of little companies leaving the venture capital incubator to toddle into the public marketplace through initial public offerings.
Indeed, 1991 was the best year for technology I.P.O.'s since 1983, according to Richard A. Schaffer, editor and publisher of the Technologic Partners Computer Letter.
But Mr.
Schaffer warns that there may be skimpy rations in the high-tech nursery in the year ahead.


CAMPUS LIFE: Cornell; Junkyard Finds Become Devices For the Disabled
Using what look like junkyard finds, Cornell biological engineering students design and build inexpensive durable therapeutic devices and toys for handicapped children.
So far, the students have built a radio-controlled toy truck and a battery-powered child-sized car intended to be operated by children with cerebral palsy, a zero-gravity arm sling to help children with minimal muscle tone use computers, a large four-position electrical switch that requires very little pressure to use, a car-loader to transfer children from wheelchairs to vehicles and a flying toy airplane.


A Show That Evokes the Spirit and Principles of Kwanzaa
DR.
MAULANA KARENGA is chairman of the black studies department on the Long Beach campus of California State University.
His fame derives not from this, however, but from his having instituted the celebration of Kwanzaa, in 1966.
The word is Swahili and denotes the fruits of the harvest; the holiday, which is not yet in the American calendar, lasts from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1.
By all accounts Kwanzaa is celebrated by eating, gift-giving, music, events like the recent Holiday Expo '91 at Manhattan Community College and, last but not least, the show here at Aljira.
As this demonstrates, Kwanzaa is not another field day for Mammon.
It is, rather, an opportunity for people of African descent to focus on principles vital to their survival with self-esteem.
There are seven of these: unity (Umoja), self-determination (Kujichagulia), collective work and responsibililty (Ujima), cooperative economics (Ujamaa), purpose (Nia), creativity (Kuumba) and faith (Imani).


The Rothschild Files
ERIC ROTHSCHILD likes to joke about the New York City cabdriver who asked him, when he was a young man just starting out in life, where he had gone to college.
"I told him, 'Harvard,' " Mr.
Rothschild said.
"He said, 'So, what are you going to be when you grow up?' I said, 'A teacher.' He said, 'So, for this you went to Harvard?' "
Yes, he did.
To be precise, he went to Harvard to prepare for a career teaching American history at Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, N.Y., his alma mater.
He has taught there for 28 years, and each fall a new group of students is enthralled.
"It's like he's teaching everything for the first time," said Marc Leibert, a junior this year.
"You can't
not
be interested."


Differences Can Outweigh Similarities in Photo-Realism
IN the beginning (of the 1960's) there was Pop and it was followed by Minimalism.
Then, halfway through the decade, there came the backlash, Process Art and Photo-Realism.
The first was derived from Abstract Expressionism; the second came out of Pop yet had the affectlessness of Minimalism and, at the same time, capitalized on the public's fondness for exact replication.
No small achievement this.
But it took the critic Thomas Albright to nail the movement by quoting Roland Barthes's 1958 definition of the New Objectivity in French literature: "No alibis, no depth, keeping to the surface of things, examining without emphasis, favoring no one quality."


A la Carte: Finding Dream Dishes at Easy Prices
THE year 1991 was a mashed-potato-and-meat-loaf year on Long Island.
The recession that hit with sledgehammer impact deepened, and potential restaurant customers responded as did most shoppers, by hunting for value.
Luxurious big-ticket restaurants like Giorgio's in the Garden City Hotel and Nicola's in Glen Cove closed, but casual cafes prospered.


Across Europe, Faces of Homeless Become More Visible and Vexing
Just before midnight, an unmarked Salvation Army van pulled up to the curb outside Euston Station and a trickle of tattered men and women edged cautiously from the shadows around the railroad terminal, hunched against the biting winter air.
There were, in all, about 30 of them, many wrapped in blankets.
Most were young, in their early 20's, a few smelling sharply of alcohol.


Hungary's Abortion Opponents Depict a Nation on the Wane Foes of Abortion Depict a Hungary in Decline
As Hungarians debate the future of their relatively liberal approach to abortion, it has become apparent that the debate is not just about abortion, but about nationhood.
The Constitutional Court told Parliament recently to draft a new abortion law by next December, presenting the prospect of a change.
Yet the country may just put off the decision indefinitely; Hungarians have, after all, taken the availability of abortion for granted for 40 years.
Abortion is widely available, and although there are a few restrictions, basically anyone who is willing to go through the red tape can have one in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, or in the first 18 weeks if she is a minor.
Abortion is allowed through the 20th week if medical reasons are established, as well as on request in cases of rape or incest.


Hoosiers Heat Up, And Down Cincinnati
Eric Anderson scored a season-high 23 points today, including 10 in the opening minutes of the second half, to rally No. 10 Indiana past Cincinnati, 81-60.
Anderson hit two jumpers and a pair of 3-pointers as Indiana (9-2) wiped out a 6-point halftime deficit.
His 3-pointer put Indiana ahead to stay, 44-41, with 16 minutes 16 seconds left.


Sports of The Times; Write-In for Rose: 3 Years Are Enough
NOW that George Steinbrenner appears to be within an unconditional surrender of returning to baseball on Commissioner Fay Vincent's terms, Pete Rose will surely be next on line outside the confessional.
Not long ago, Rose, banned after Commissioner Bart Giamatti concluded in 1989 that the Cincinnati Reds manager had bet on baseball and on the Reds, disclosed that he planned to seek reinstatement sometime this year.
If it were granted, the most avid golfer in Boca Raton, Fla., would then seek employment with the Florida Marlins, the National League expansion team that is scheduled to begin play in 1993.


Right Numbers
In her more than 13 years as the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Janet L. Norwood earned a reputation for having zero tolerance for numbers that lied.
Dr.
Norwood, who retired last week, is known not merely as a stickler for accuracy -- that goes with the territory -- but also for refusing to let her statistics be pressed into political service.
She would say that if you mess with the data base -- perhaps by manipulating unemployment figures to justify an economic policy -- you mess with democracy.
Such attitudes led one senator to deem her "a national treasure." Discussing her retirement last week, the 68-year-old Dr.
Norton expressed concern that Washington might not be managing the ever growing stream of economic information as well as some others.
"We are really not operating internationally as effectively as we ought," she said.
"I'm concerned about the increasing effectiveness of other countries. I worry about where we will be 10 or 15 years from now."


Promoter Gives His Account of 9 Deaths at City College
The promoter of the celebrity basketball game at City College, in his first detailed account, told a city investigator yesterday that crowd violence had begun an hour before nine young people were fatally crushed and that the police had failed to stop it and had ignored his pleas to disperse and control the increasingly restive and swelling throng.
A lawyer who was present said that Sean Combs, a 22-year-old promoter, also told Deputy Mayor Milton Mollen, the head of a mayoral panel investigating the tragedy, that contrary to earlier reports the gymnasium was well short of its 2,730-seat capacity at the time of the crush, but that the crowd outside had grown to between 3,000 and 4,000, far larger than previously estimated.


'Naked Lunch' Goes Buggy
David Cronenberg has a soft spot for bugs, and they've always been kind to him.
His first feature was a low-budget 1975 horror movie called "Shivers," a k a "The Parasite Murders" and "They Came From Within," a grotesque little story about man-made, sexually-transmitted killer parasites.
His popular breakthrough came in 1986 with his remake of "The Fly," in which a scientist played by Jeff Goldblum turned into a giant fly that drooled gallons of sickening fluid around the lab.
This penchant for insects had commercial value, but it did not seem to be an artistic obsession on the order of, say, Picasso's fascination with bulls.
Who knew what David Cronenberg would one day do with a bug?
In his smashingly funny and wise version of "Naked Lunch," bugs are the witty devices that bring the hero's unconscious desires to dizzying cinematic life.


Jill Bates Plans A May Wedding
Mr. and Mrs.
James S. Bates of New Vernon, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Jill Elizabeth Bates, to Roger Bernard Champagne Jr., the son of Judge and Mrs.
Champagne of North Falmouth, Mass.
A May wedding is planned.
Miss Bates, 26 years old, graduated from Catholic University and is an executive assistant at the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission in Washington.
Her father retired as president of the Vanderbilt Petroleum Company, an oil marketing concern in New York.
Her mother, Louise Bates, is president of New Vernon Travel, a travel agency.


Britrail Freezes Price of Passes
The British railroad system says it is holding the price of its passes in 1992 at last year's level.
Among these tickets offering unlimited rail travel in England, Scotland and Wales is the eight-day Britrail Pass, which remains at $209 a person in standard class, and the Flexipass, good for four days' travel in eight days, which is staying at $179 in standard class.
The passes are also sold for longer periods and for first class as well as standard.
Children 5 to 15 travel for half price.
Young people aged 16 to 25 and travelers over 60 receive discounts.
Britrail is introducing a Scotrail pass, allowing travel on trains and major ferries in Scotland, for 1992.
It is available for 8 days ($129), 15 days ($189) and 22 days ($249) in standard class only.
There is no youth or over-60's discount.
More information: (212) 575-2667.


Fitch Says He's Fed Up With Rumors, Not Anderson
For any Nets owners, administrators, reporters, broadcasters, fans and reserve point guards who think Bill Fitch has a grudge against Kenny Anderson, the coach is determined to set the record straight.
"I've heard enough of that stuff," Fitch said after a workout last week.
"To say I have a vendetta against Kenny, well, I just don't see it."


Bills Can Run, Too. But Can They Slow the Chiefs?
Is there a more physical offense in the American Conference than Kansas City's?
The Chiefs use the type of muscle and bruising run-first mentality more popular in the National Conference.
The Buffalo Bills know this firsthand.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
NOBODY BELIEVES HIM
BILL WADE of Huntington is the new president of the New York Area Skeptics.
Last year he was treasurer.
It was tough being treasurer of a skeptics' group, he said.
"Nobody believed how much we had in the treasury. I had to keep giving detailed reports."


Winds From an Atlantic Storm Topple Trees and Tear at Moorings
Like a snapped spring, a "tightly wound" storm lashed at the Atlantic Coast yesterday, smacking the Jersey Shore with 60 mile-per-hour winds, toppling trees and tearing loose a 320-foot-long barge on Long Island Sound.
It wasn't the vicious nor'easter that ravaged coasts on Halloween nine weeks ago, but yesterday's storm was trouble enough.


Parcells Snubs Chance To Join the Packers
In what looks like an instant replay, Bill Parcells spurned a chance to coach the Green Bay Packers yesterday just one week after the former Giants head coach rejected a long-term offer to run the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
But talks with Ron Wolff, the Packers' general manager, apparently never progressed as far as those with Hugh Culverhouse, the Buccaneers' owner, who said he tendered Parcells a five-year, $6.5 million contract.


Santa Monica's Urban Living Room
AMERICAN cities tend to be like houses without a living room.
There are places to sleep.
Places to work.
Places to eat.
But there are very few places for people to live together, to enjoy each other in large numbers, to be the social animals we were meant to be.
Without a living room, American cities are just anthills.
Western cities tend to have even fewer living rooms than do Eastern cities.
By the time you reach California, the urban parlor has all but ceased to exist in any form.
Or at least that was the case until Santa Monica unveiled its new Third Street Promenade at the extreme western edge of America, three blocks from the Pacific Ocean.
The official opening was Sept. 16, 1989, but only in the past few months has it made a real impact on Greater Los Angeles.
Now, suddenly, some 10,000 people visit this Promenade, which is just three blocks long, every week.
Put in L.A. terms, it is a blockbuster.

Hispanic Doctors Form Network
IN a move to meet the health needs of a rapidly growing segment of the county's population, Spanish-speaking doctors have formed the county's first Hispanic medical society.
Dr.
Felix Davila, a White Plains internist, has spearheaded the drive among Westchester doctors to help Hispanic residents who -- because of a language barrier, financial need or a lack of understanding of a new culture -- may not have access to medical care.


In Late Abortions, Decisions Are Painful and Options Few
Catherine Stern found out from a sonogram when she was seven months pregnant that she was carrying a fetus with stumps for arms and legs and possible brain damage.
"I was in shock," she said.
"I was catatonic."
Ms.
Stern, a lawyer who lives in Turnbridge, Vt., said she and her husband agonized over whether to have an abortion.
"I felt as if I was being given a choice," she said, "and if I can find any way I was going to make it a choice." She decided to terminate the pregnancy.


George Plimpton, Writer and Editor, Is Wed to Sarah W. Dudley, a Writer
Sarah Whitehead Dudley, a freelance writer, and George Ames Plimpton, the writer and editor, were married on Tuesday in Redding, Conn., at the home of the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs.

Mr.
Wilmot is the vice president for leasing of Wilmorite Inc., a shopping center developer, builder and manager in Rochester.
His father was a founder of the company.


Birds Contribute Color to a Lively Yard
PERHAPS it is their sweet sound.
Or their bright colors or just their presence.
But feeding birds is always a plus.
One of the best ways to be sure they will come to the yard is to supply their favorite foods, especially if the winter is harsh.
This custom is also a way to learn what species are about.
To reinforce this process, keep a bird guide near the window to identify that chance rare one that may come around.
Also, keep binoculars in a convenient place for a quick grab.
These magnifiers are handy because sometimes it is difficult to detect that eye line or wing patch.
Having said all this, there still are a few pointers to keep in mind.


Douglas Is Back, But Friendship Suffers
The protracted holdout of Miami point guard SHERMAN DOUGLAS earned him a seven-year, $17 million contract, but may have cost him his friendship with his teammate RONY SEIKALY.
Douglas rejoined the Heat last week and came off the bench to contribute 10 points and 7 assists in a 113-109 overtime loss to Seattle Thursday night.
It was his first action after missing 30 games.


Garden Q. &amp; A.
Winter Compost Q.
I have a plastic compost bin to which I've added leaves, vegetable matter and cow manure.
Should I continue adding kitchen vegetable scraps through winter and then try to turn it?
Will it continue to "cook," or should I hold these scraps till spring?  -- P. DeSavino Jr., Beach Haven, N.J.


A Deadly Night Out
THE basketball game between rap stars in a City College gymnasium was heavily advertised on radio just before it was to begin.
Promotion was, at $2,850, the biggest item in the event's $10,000 expense budget.
Security was not -- about $1,850 was budgeted for it.
But as many as 5,000 people showed up, trying to get into a gymnasium that could seat 2,730.
Windows were broken by the unruly crowd.
But the 66 police officers outside did not move in, since there were no reports of crimes or danger to the public.
Then people at the back began to shove forward.


Editorial Notebook; Penny Wisdom
Thanks to Dwight Bravo and his kind, one New Yorker is $63.84 richer.
Mr.
Bravo, a security guard at a Manhattan bookstore, told the Times reporter Eleanor Blau the other day that he wouldn't stoop to pick a penny up from the street.
That's
his
mistake.
Since St.
Patrick's Day 1989, when the undersigned started stooping in earnest, the streets and sidewalks of New York have yielded 1,604 pennies, 65 nickels, 128 dimes, 46 quarters, five subway tokens, two slugs, a miscellany of coinage from around the world, and now and then some green.
All told, $57.59 in U.S. coin and currency, plus the five tokens worth $1.15 apiece when acquired but now worth $1.25. (Some of the coins may have added value, too, as rarities, but that's not the point. The game is in the hunting and finding.)


POSTINGS: Tweed Courthouse Elevators; Glass Sheathing For Open Cages
A plan to enclose and automate two open-cage elevators in the old New York County Courthouse in Manhattan, better known as the Tweed Courthouse, was approved by the city's Department of Buildings last month.
As part of a restoration of the building, the wrought-iron elevator cars will be completely glazed with plate glass on the inside.
Another layer of glass will cover the elevator doors on each floor.
"We think the glass will be inconspicuous," said John G. Waite of Mesrick Cohen Waite of Albany, the architect that is restoring the building.


Massachusetts Town Refuses Tax Increase To Rehire Teachers
Residents of the tiny Massachusetts town of Wales, which laid off five of the seven teachers at its lone elementary school last year because of budget problems, voted Friday against increasing property taxes to pay for rehiring the teachers.
By 407-to-249, voters turned down a measure that would have raised $160,745 to bring back the teachers immediately.
By a nearly identical margin, the residents approved a second measure raising $20,000 to maintain their garbage collection services.


When Abstraction Becomes an Obsession
The New York City Ballet has announced that it will devote an entire week in May to nothing but premieres.
At least 10 choreographers will stage works; the participants range from experienced creators to comparative newcomers.
That the company will be running risks is terrific news, for it is no secret that ballet is suffering from a shortage of challenging new productions.
The scope of ballet has narrowed.
Few choreographers today are as versatile as Michel Fokine, Leonide Massine, Bronislava Nijinska or George Balanchine.
While those dance pioneers were geniuses, and genius cannot be wished into existence, we are not without talented ballet makers today.
However, too many choreographers are stuck in ruts.
For instance, there's an inordinate emphasis nowadays upon music as choreography's primary source.
Of course, music can inspire.
But ballet-making involves more than setting steps to concertos or symphonies.
A ballet must have a distinctive theatrical personality apart from its accompaniment.
Although Balanchine called music a floor for dancing, he surely conceived a ballet as a structure rising boldly from that floor and not as a piece of linoleum stretched upon it.

Mayor Halfway
The intelligent State of the City speech that Mayor David Dinkins gave last week contained some good ideas and sounded New York City's traditional theme of compassionate leadership for all urban America.
Yet it was just a speech, one of many he has given that reflect his performance over two years.
He certainly sounds as if he knows how to lift New York City from its recessionary torpor.
Yet he has not yet pushed hard enough to master the city's fiscal fates, never pressed his appointees hard enough and never rallied his fellow citizens insistently enough.


Texas 'River Rats' Wait Out the Flood
Standing around a fire built in a rusty oil drum, a group of men who call themselves "river rats" sipped coffee dispensed from a Red Cross truck today and surveyed the high ground where they had taken refuge.
"We can still catch all the fish we want," said Homer Fewox, 66 years old, "and we got good people to keep company with up here, some guitar pickers among them. But on the whole, any one of us would be a whole lot happier back on the bottom."


For $64,000: Who Lost in the Big Fix?
"The Quiz Show Scandal" recalls that in an era before Presidents had done much lying on television, trusting Americans were already being lied to by the shows they loved best.
"The $64,000 Question," "21" and "Dotto" were among the tube's earliest and biggest hits, bringing money and celebrity to contestants, bonuses to producers, profits to advertising agencies and fortunes to sponsors.
All were rigged.
The road to exposure, which caused much breast-beating in the 1950's, is clearly laid out on tomorrow night's edition of "The American Experience," at 9 on Channels 13 and 49 in the New York area.
Linking individual motives to institutional pressures, the program casts an unkind light on much of commercial television.


Clearing Mudd
Over the years many Government officials, including Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, have come to believe that Dr.
Samuel Mudd was just doing his job when he set the broken leg of John Wilkes Booth.
But the United States Army has not been so easily convinced, and depite decades of appeals by his grandson, Dr.
Richard Mudd, Army records still list Dr.
Mudd as a convicted accomplice in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
That may change this month, when the Army Board of Correction of Military Records meets to reconsider the case of Dr.
Mudd, who was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in 1869 after serving four years of a life sentence.
Dr.
Mudd and his family are expected to help make the case that their forebear knew nothing of the assassination.
Dr.
Mudd, who is 90 years old, admits having wearied of the long fight, but is game for finishing it.
"After 75 years, I'm getting tired of the thing," he said.
"But I'm not tired to the point I wanted to give it up."


Lisa A. Lebow, Analyst, Weds
Lisa Anne Lebow, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Harry Poe Lebow of Baltimore, was married yesterday evening to Mark Alan Kaufman, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Lawrence Kaufman of Baltimore.
Rabbi Floyd Herman performed the ceremony at the Harbor Court Hotel in Baltimore.
Mrs.
Kaufman, 25 years old, is a financial analyst at LaSalle Partners in New York.
She graduated from Brown University.
Her father is president of H. Poe Lebow Ltd., a clothing design and marketing concern, and her mother is a psychiatric social worker at the Keswick Home for Incurables, both in Baltimore.


Sweeping Up the Rubble of the Year
LAST year seems to have wound down in a grump, at least among some readers.
And, for the first column of 1992, we might as well get rid of some of the rocks and pebbles that have rolled this way.
A Bummer of a Bimmer?
Dear Sir:
Based on your article, "With the 325i, BMW Drops the 4th Shoe," (The Times, Dec. 1), I'm convinced you're about as qualified to evaluate cars as a graham cracker.
I own a 1992 325i and I'm exceptionally pleased with all aspects of the car.
As for the "weak detent between low and reverse," I have to force it into reverse, and my wife let the car sit in the garage for three days because she didn't know the "trick" to get it into reverse.
Maybe this BMW isn't the greatest car on the road.
Time will tell.
But it's an excellent complete package.
Come to your senses!
HOLLARD R. EARLE Long Valley, N.J
A graham cracker? I tend to think of myself as Cracker Jack.
Dear Sir:
What a travesty to condemn a terrific new car almost solely because of your inability to distinguish first gear from reverse.
I did agree with you about the air-conditioning controls: a mishmash of confusion, particularly at night.
But if I'd agreed with your obvious preference for lightweight and thin-skinned small cars like the Lexus, Maxima and Camry, I'd have bought one.
How strange to condemn BMW for being itself.
EDWARD S. DUBEL North Myrtle Beach, S.C.
I confess. I have an affinity for the thin-skinned.
Dear Sir:
After your positive impressions of the new models BMW has introduced since 1987, everyone here was surprised by your 325i review.
BMW's surprise was compounded by the fact that the 325i was on the eve of receiving significant awards from both Car and Driver and Automobile magazines, and the newspaper reviews of the car have been very good throughout the country.
Your opinions are your opinions, but one part of the article states a fact that is difficult to understand.
BMW has never been criticized for the operation of our five-speed manual transmission.
Reporting that the "reverse gear lives in dangerous proximity to low" is something new and "the problem, echoed by others who have driven the car" does not match our experience from the media or customers.
Safety is very important to BMW, so we are concerned with the emphasis you placed on an experience others have not shared.
THOMAS O. MC GURN Woodcliff Lake, N.J
McGurn is general manager of corporate communications for BMW of North America.
His opinions are his opinions.
Dear Sir:
Having purchased a new BMW 325i several weeks ago, I found your review insufficiently critical.
Let me tell you what we have encountered.
First, the windshield developed a long vertical crack at 200 miles, and at about the same time a defective sensor told us we were without coolant.
None of the heater ducts worked and much packing material had to be removed from each.
Then the power steering began to groan.
After a long wait, it was replaced.
At about 300 miles, the right cornering light fell out of its socket and was dangling by its wires while we tried to figure out why people were tooting and pointing at us.
There is more, but I will not bother you with it, except to cite one problem that BMW dealers told us is endemic in the new 325i: engine vibration.  that is felt through the accelerator and the steering column.
The new engine is quite rough, and at certain steady speeds on our freeways, you can really get quite annoyed at the vibration of the accelerator pedal and the steering column.
Compared to our '85 BMW, this really is an unpleasant car to drive.
DANIEL S. CHAFFIN San Rafael, Calif.
O.K., I'll try to be more critical.
Hit From Both Sides
Dear Sir:
Your recent article discussing the differences between the Volvo wagon and minivans ("Volvo Makes Its New 960 a Safe Bet," The Times, Dec. 15), which came complete with a few technical updates and emotional letters from mommies, left me cold.
Sideguard protection isn't new.
G.M. has been putting this type of protection into autos since the late 70's.
And your emotional mommies are just that.
If they want
all
the protection they can get, they should consider a Jeep Wagoneer, a G.M.
Suburban or maybe a production Hummer.
TOM HANDLER Cherry Hill, N.J.
It's rumored that surplus Gulf War Hummers are going for 25 bucks.
Dear Sir:
Your column about the Volvo 960 did not really address the concerns of the letter from Ellie Dunham.
Where is she supposed to seat four young children if she and her husband also want to ride in the car?
We have three children in car-seats and own a Volvo 740 wagon, and we have the same dilemma.
The Volvo wins on safety, but the minivans look attractive because they offer more seating.
Volvo does offer a third bench seat for the back of the wagon, but I am concerned about the safety of that -- tiny knees pressed up against the rear door in a rear-end collision, etc.
SUSAN SWARTZ Highland Park, Ill.
Given the volume of mail, this is a problem that is on the minds of a lot of people.
Automotive engineers are among them, and they say they are trying.
They also maintain that vans have gotten a bad rap, so to speak.
Dear Sir:
Just weeks before your column appeared, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration responded to Congressional questions on the safety of light trucks and vans and stated the following:
"NHTSA is aware of the greater use of light trucks and multipurpose vehicles such as vans as passenger-carrying vehicles. In spite of these increases, accident data have shown that the average occupant fatality rate for all types of light trucks and vans (LTV's) is identical to that of passenger cars.
"In side impact crashes, the number of fatalities per million registered vehicles for LTV's is significantly lower than that for passenger cars (25.5 vs. 57.3). Although this may be in part because the side door sills are somewhat higher on some LTV's than on passenger cars, nonetheless LTV's have a lower fatality rate, even though they have not had to meet the same safety standard as passenger cars."
We agree on this point.
For the record, the only manner in which Chrysler minivans do not meet all passenger car standards are the side-impact door beams and the unbelted driver-restraint requirement.
Both of these will be resolved in late 1993, when a passenger air bag will also be added.
One certainty about adding door beams is an increase in weight and an offsetting reduction in fuel economy.
We have preferred to invest our minivan resources in the first and only integrated child seat, the first minivan air bag, antilock brakes and all-wheel drive.
RONALD S. ZAROWITZ Highland Park, Mich.
Zarowitz is manager of car and truck safety for Chrysler Corporation.
He is also the inventor of Chrysler's new child safety seats.
But Then . . .
Dear Sir:
I'd like you to know that before your excellent column appeared regularly in Sunday Sports, this section of The Times was used at my house only for such things as wrapping fish heads, training the dog, kindling the wood stove and the like.
Now these tasks wait until I've investigated your column.
DAVID MAJERCIK Williamsburg, Mass.
Always nice to end on a high note.

An Open Letter To Bobby Bonilla
Dear Bobby:
Congratulations on your new contract.
It must feel great knowing that you and your family are secure for life.
So Bobby, why are you so sour?
Why do you persist in bashing the Pirates' management at every turn?
Are you so concerned that selling yourself to the highest bidder doesn't square with your "great guy" image?
Does maintaining that image require the presence of other, non-economic factors?
Is that what's behind this modern-day tragedy you've created in which those simultaneously wicked and bumbling Pirates executives are solely to blame for your leaving Pittsburgh?
Bobby, are you trying to kid us or yourself?
Listen, forget the image thing and just enjoy your fortune; you're not such a great guy, anyway, and the money hasn't a thing to do with it.


Cultural Impersonators
To the Editor:
Henry Louis Gates Jr. delightfully demonstrates that however important a text's (presumed) origins may be in determining its reception, readers are bound to be as helpless before a true blindfold test as writers are incapable of controlling the multifold influences that qualify even well-intentioned "authenticity." But what
shall
we do with Dickens's clairvoyant response to George Eliot's first fiction?
Her assumption of the male pseudonym was insufficient to persuade the great genius of the English novel.

This Week: Winter Greens
If evergreen boughs and a Christmas tree were part of your holiday season, don't just throw them away.
Strip the branches from the tree and use these and other evergreens to mulch plants, especially those planted in the fall.
The greens and other mulch will keep plants from being heaved from the ground during cycles of thawing and freezing.
Now that the annuals and perennials aren't coloring your garden, take a good look around the yard.
Do you have some interesting green and blue-green conifers to add interest to the winter landscape?
Siberian dogwood (Cornus alba 'Sibirica') would brighten the eye right now with its bright red-barked twigs.
Chinese witch hazel (Hamamelis mollis) has fragrant yellow confetti-like blooms that will open under a February sun.
"Arnold Promise" is another favorite witch hazel; both will do well as far north as hardiness zone 5.

Oh Yeah? Yeah!
Having popularly elected local school boards can indeed bring democracy to education.
But the board members, on occasion, may act like politicians.
Last week, New York City Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez threatened to overrule a Bronx school board and rescind the appointment of six new principals after the board disobeyed the chancellor's order that the appointments be postponed.
Mr.
Fernandez ordered the postponement to investigate a dispute among the board members over the appointments.
Raul Cruz, the chairman of the Bronx board, said that a "racist and anti-Semitic" faction sought to block the appointments because two of the new principals were Jewish.
Edward Cain, a member of the dissident group said Mr.
Cruz was "an out-and-out liar" and that he opposed the appointments because at least one of them appeared to be a political reward.
A spokesman for the central board said that Mr.
Fernandez would meet with the Bronx board this week.


Dream Bowl: Sling, Knute And Friends
I dreamed I watched every minute of every bowl game, which is not possible, and when I awoke I had memories that were all my own:
An hour before the Inc.
Bowl, the one Howard Cosell came back to broadcast with Jane Fonda on CNN, the quarterback for the Hog Butchers of Chicago A&amp;M called a team meeting.
I think his name was Sling.
The coaches were pleased at first; they thought he would do their job for them, psych the animals into tearing apart the Cossacks of Moscow (Idaho) State.


Mythic


The Arab World Comes to the End of Illusions
ACROSS the Arab world almost a year after the end of the gulf war, people are comparing that crisis and its aftermath to the thunderclap of the 1967 defeat of the Arabs by Israel in the Six Day War.
That event is deeply engraved in the consciousness of an entire generation that was emerging then from school and that today administers the Arab world.
The "naksa" (setback), as it is known in Arabic, set off a chain reaction that changed the Arab status quo in the late 1960's and 70's.
Eventually Egypt made peace with Israel, and some Arab countries, notably Egypt and the Arab gulf states, realigned themselves with the West even as anti-Western leaders like Saddam Hussein and Muammar el-Qaddafi consolidated their power.


Tropical Tresses
A recent issue of British Vogue features the model Claudia Schiffer cavorting about St.
Barts in a glamorous assortment of resort clothes.
As usual, she looks like Brigitte Bardot, circa 1959, with volumes of blond hair -- windblown, shiny and blissfully frizz-free.
The look is utterly effortless, which is precisely what Frederic Fekkai, the Fifth Avenue hair wizard who styled Schiffer's tresses, wanted.
But achieving such a silky style -- one that glistens with health -- was, according to Fekkai, "a challenge."


Don't Equate Red With 'Bimbo'
To the Editor:
Camille Lavington should use some of the "$10,000 a day" she earns to hire someone to check her remarks before they appear in print. ("Image-Making, From Soup to Sales Pitch," Executive Life, Dec. 8.) There are quite a few of us professional women business owners who proudly wear Borghese Red lipstick and nail polish and take umbrage at being called "bimbo." As she should know, good manners begin at home.

Tech Notes; All Aboard For Virtuality
Virtual reality is becoming reality.
W Industries of Leicester, England, is manufacturing a virtual reality system for use in video arcades and other entertainment spots to be distributed in the United States this year by a division of Edison Brothers Stores of St.
Louis.
Game software is being provided by Spectrum Holobyte of Alameda, Calif.
In virtuality, participants wear helmets containing screens that show three-dimensional computer-generated images.
The helmets also block out the real world, giving participants the illusion of being completely immersed in the computer's fantasy world.


The View From the Front Of the Bus
IN my nightmares I stand in front of a bus facing 44 restless tourists, of all ages, personalities, expectations and demands.
I'm supposed to describe the passing scenery to them, supply colorful anecdotes from local history, but the windows are all fogged up, and what's more I've forgotten my spiel, other than the words
encompassing three geological epochs.
The bus skids along on its chassis, the wheels having fallen off; a man with a foghorn voice sitting in back shouts out complaints about our lunch stop; I have marinara sauce on my necktie; my driver has lost his way.
Such, 10 years later, is the psychological residue of the three seasons I spent as a tour director for one of America's largest bus-tour companies, leading their "Cape Cod and the Islands" tour of southeastern New England.
Seven days a week, 20 weeks in a row, I worked as a combination nursemaid, lecturer, social director, group psychologist, diplomat and scout (
shepherd
is the occupation I listed on my tax forms each year). It was a demanding job, but not a bad one for an apprentice novelist; a heavy dose of real and not-so-real life, followed by seven months off in which to recuperate from the mileage and to write.


Lesbian Presbyterian Pastor To Lead Church in Rochester
The Presbyterian Church's first openly lesbian minister has been appointed a local church pastor, becoming the first lesbian to reach that post, the denomination said today.
In a briefing sent to leaders of the 2.9 million-member Presbyterian Church (USA), the church's news service said the Rev.

Supporters of Georgia's President Stage a Protest Without Incident
Heavy gunfire echoed today through the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, but a demonstration by supporters of President Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia went ahead without bloodshed.
The gathering of about 300 people had raised fears of a repetition of the violence that took place on Friday, when opposition gunmen opened fire on Gamsakhurdia supporters who defied the rebels' ban on demonstrations.

Righting, Not Rewriting History
To the Editor:
If Tom Wicker originally covered President Kennedy's assassination with the same naivete on the politics of power in the United States displayed in his article on "J. F. K.," it is no wonder people like Oliver Stone still have to work to get to the truth.
In doing so, Mr.
Stone has come to the conclusion, as have many others -- including the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1979 -- that the Warren Commission was incorrect in its lone-assassin theory.


All About/Basketball Shoes; High Tops: High Style, High Tech, High Cost
When Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls basketball team began advertising basketball shoes a few years ago -- the Air Jordan line by Nike Inc. -- he was selling high-tech style as much as performance.
Unlike their low-tech, black-and-white predecessors, today's basketball shoes are made of light-weight leathers and synthetics dyed in a dazzling array of colors with vivid, high-contrast, graphic designs.
They are also constructed with sophisticated cushioning devices and fitting systems.
And they are expensive.
PF Flyers and U.S.
Keds, the standbys of a generation or two ago, rarely cost more than $10 or $15 a pair -- roughly $20 now.
Today's popular styles can cost as much as $160.


Chess
The first shock from China was 21-year-old Xie Jun's winning the women's world championship in October.
The second is that three of the six players who took top places in the women's interzonal tournament, qualifying them for the next round of eliminations to pick a challenger for Xie in the fall of 1993, are her compatriots.
Considering that China was not a part of the International Chess Federation until 1975, this is extraordinary.
In the tournament, which ended on Nov. 25 in Subotica, Yugoslavia, Nona Gaprindashvili, a former titleholder from the Soviet Union, shared first place with Peng Zhaoqin of China, each scoring 9-4 in the 34-player Swiss-system event.
Third place was shared by Irina Levitina of Teaneck, N.J., and Nana Ioseliani of the Soviet Union, each tallying 8 1/2-4 1/2.
The last two qualifying places were taken by Wang Pin and Qin Kanying of China, each with 8-5.

Catching a Mediterranean Flavor With Salt Cod
SALT COD (also known as baccala in Italy) is a humble food that has become something of a luxury.
Dried in the sun and salted, it has for centuries been a basic dish in Europe, particularly around the Mediterranean.
It is the main ingredient in the famous French dish called brandade, in which salt cod is whipped into a puree with potatoes, garlic and olive oil.
It is also extremely popular in Italy, where it is traditionally eaten at Christmastime and New Year's.
In the United States, salt cod can be found in Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Italian markets, in specialty stores and in some of the larger supermarkets.
Choose plump, soft pieces with an ivory-colored flesh and, if possible, avoid stringy tail ends, which may never lose their leathery quality even when cooked.

Items to Augment a Basic Tool Kit
MANY home repair tasks can be accomplished with only a basic kit of tools: tape measure, claw hammer, crosscut saw, hack saw, regular and Phillips-head screwdrivers, pliers, adjustable wrench and electric drill.
But owning some other tools can broaden the range of jobs one can do and make some familiar chores easier.
Following is a list of tools to augment a basic kit.
To save money, buy tools only as needed.


On the Street; An Italian Outdoors on Fifth Avenue
Fifth Avenue over the New Year week was alive with Italian tourists on shopping splurges or stopoffs on the way to the Caribbean.
New York City's luxury hotels were jammed with women dressed in their functional everyday idea of status dress.
They appeared in a harmony of spice colors: cinnamon, mustard, nutmeg, paprika, thyme, ginger and clove, along with taupes and bone colors anchored by terra cotta and olive green.
That seemed the first rule of the Italian look.
The second was apparently that the silhouette must be rigorously adhered to, creating an unmistakable national fashion identity for the Italians, unlike the American mandate to "do your own thing."

Tragic Twist to a Difficult Season Strengthens Lions' Resolve
The flickering image of tackle Mike Utley making a block on film is at once eerie and then heartening to Detroit tackle Roman Fortin, Utley's best friend and teammate with the Lions.
Fortin was watching Utley's work in film of the Lions' Oct. 27 game against Dallas in preparation for this afternoon's National Football Conference divisional playoff game against the Cowboys at the Silverdome.
A scant three weeks later, Utley was paralyzed from the chest down after making a block in a game with the Los Angeles Rams on Nov. 17.
Utley, confined to a wheelchair, is now a undergoing rehabilitation at Craig Hospital in surburban Denver.


Stabilize the Banks and Reverse the Recession; Pension Borrowing
To the Editor:
In "The Economy: Go Fast, and Slow" (editorial, Dec. 19), you imply that a business could borrow from its own pension fund and use these "tax-subsidized" dollars for "tax-subsidized" investments.
This ambiguity results from the preceding sentences, which paraphrased read: It makes little sense to allow businesses to deduct the entire cost of long-lived investments with tax laws that also permit tax-free contributions to pension funds.

Birds Contribute Color to a Lively Yard
PERHAPS it is their sweet sound.
Or their bright colors or just their presence.
But feeding birds is always a plus.
One of the best ways to be sure they will come to the yard is to supply their favorite foods, especially if the winter is harsh.
This custom is also a way to learn what species are about.
To reinforce this process, keep a bird guide near the window to identify that chance rare one that may come around.
Also, keep binoculars in a convenient place for a quick grab.
These magnifiers are handy because sometimes it is difficult to detect that eye line or wing patch.
Having said all this, there still are a few pointers to keep in mind.

Corporate Incentive To Teach
SCHOOLS clamor for dedicated teachers, while corporations send managers to the unemployment lines.
Doesn't seem fair, does it?
The Chevron Corporation doesn't think so.
To pare down payroll with a minimum of pain, the San Francisco-based oil company is letting employees with five years' experience, no matter how young, take early retirement.
And, in a fillip stemming from equal parts philanthropy and self-interest, Chevron will pay $4,000 toward tuition if they go to school for teaching credentials.


Recycle the Budget Agreement
One year after its implementation, the budget agreement of 1990 has achieved a bizarre status: worshiped as a kind of totem by the Bush Administration, it is simultaneously scorned by fiscal zealots as a sham that did nothing to reduce the Federal deficit.
Both views are wrong.
The budget agreement did cut the deficit.
It's just that cutting the deficit did nothing to help our stagnant economy, which, as a perverse consequence, will yield a record $362 billion deficit in fiscal 1992.
In short, the budget agreement performed as advertised and failed miserably anyway.

A Limo in Time
To the Editor: At 2 P.M. on a Monday in August, I was at home here in Waterford, Conn., when I got a call from a friend on his way to a 7:30 P.M.
London flight out of Kennedy Airport.
John had just realized he had left his passport at home in nearby Groton Long Point.
For me to deliver the passport by trying to get from New York City to eastern Connecticut, then to Kennedy was pure folly -- especially without a car; there was just not enough time.
Well, the solution was as elegant as it was simple.
"No problem," was the answer when I spoke to a young person named Florine at Connecticut Limousine Service.
"What was the person's name; the airline, the flight number, the departure time?" If I would bring the passport to the New Haven terminal (half an hour from Waterford), there would be a labeled envelope waiting (it was) and the counter person would put it on a bus in time to reach my friend at the airport.
She did, and it did.
The charge for all this was
zero!
(I did give the counter person $10, which she was reluctant to take, $5 for the driver and if I ever see Florine, I'll give her $5, too).
These people saved me eight hours of driving, and avoided complication and disarray for my friend.

Cultural Impersonators
To the Editor:
In 1956, Jorge Luis Borges, who can be read via the categories of Latin American, visually impaired and sui generis, anticipated Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s discussion of literary authenticity.
His
ficcion
"Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote" imagines a 20th-century novelist rewriting chapters of "Don Quixote" verbatim but creating a book quite distinct from Cervantes', precisely because the context of its production and reception is so radically different.
If a monkey doodling at the typewriter happened to pound out the precise text of "Hamlet," the result would be a dramatic experience as different from Shakespeare's as if authorship by the Earl of Oxford were definitively established.
If Sholom Aleichem were somehow proved to have composed "Mein Kampf," reading the book would suddenly become a very different matter from what it is now.
While authorship should not be used as a stamp of kashrut, our awareness of it ineluctably and profoundly shapes the transaction that we call reading.
Discovery that a venerated "Vermeer" is a forgery does not necessarily diminish the painting's brilliance; it will still be the same arrangement of shades and shapes.
But it does and should color our viewing.

Donations to Neediest Cases Make an Operation Possible
When the doctor told Lucilla Santiago two months ago that she needed an operation to remove a tumor from her ovaries, she asked him, "How much?"
The answer -- $4,000 -- was more than she had.
But she hardly heard the doctor, for she was thinking about her husband, and his decision to cancel his life insurance policy just before he died of a heart attack in 1986.
She also thought about the arthritis

Getting About by Computer: Step-by-Step Programs
WHERE'S a good, affordable place to stay or dine in Dallas or London?
How can you make the most of frequent-flier miles?
What's the most direct way to drive from New York to Cleveland, or the most interesting?
Traditionally, people have turned to books, periodicals, travel agents or friends for answers to such questions.
But now, software can help.


An Adviser Speaks Out
To the Editor:
Tom Wicker castigates the former District Attorney of New Orleans, Jim Garrison, for trying to do what Texas law officers and courts have studiously avoided.
Mr.
Garrison attempted to the best of his ability to prove what men like Lyndon B. Johnson had come to believe: that the assassination in Dallas had been part of a conspiracy.
Because Mr.
Garrison's account of that trial provides Oliver Stone with a complete panoply of "assassination lore," it gives him an excellent foundation for that part of his broad drama.
From that base Mr.
Stone goes on to present a full spectrum of facts, such as President Kennedy's documented plan to withdraw all Americans from Vietnam by the end of 1965 and to bring 1,000 of those men home by Christmas 1963.
That Presidential directive created enormous pressures within the United States political and industrial complex.


Why Japanese Adore Vending Machines
Vending machines are everywhere in this supposedly tradition-bound country, dispensing nearly all of life's necessities, and many of the frills.
In addition to the usual train tickets, soft drinks and cigarettes, Japan's colorfully turned-out machines dispense jewelry, fresh flowers, frozen beef, rice, whisky, hamburgers, pornographic magazines, videocassettes and batteries.
From bustling urban intersections to the most bucolic rural lane, there is sure to be a humming box to satisfy a consumer's needs for a few coins.


Paris as It Used to Be: The Surprising 10th
ON a recent visit to Paris I got two distinct reactions when I mentioned the city's 10th arrondissement.
An American journalist based in Paris sniffed slightly and gave a good imitation of the classic Gallic shrug.
It's pretty grimy, he said, and if you weren't interested in streetwalkers there wasn't much to draw you up there except the New Morning jazz club.
But a French pianist who has lived in Paris for more than 20 years smiled and spread his arms.
"The
tennnth
," he said, drawing out the number with evident affection. "That is Paris as it once was, without the Americans and before the Japanese."
Both were right.
The 10th is in many places -- but not all -- grimy of aspect, its often narrow streets crowded and boisterously commercial, and at night along Rue du Faubourg St.-Denis there is a woman artfully posed in almost every other doorway.
But the resident pianist was right, too, both in his affectionate regard for this district, which contains so many surprises, and in his observation that it remains immune from those chic foreign influences that have so transformed the arrondissements of the city's inner ring.


State of the City: Trouble Ahead
AS he took stock of his city last week, Mayor David N. Dinkins let his fellow New Yorkers do much of the talking for a change, quoting a homeless man on a breadline, a mother struggling to find child care, the family of a gay man slain in a bias attack, and promising to listen and help them all.
But if the Mayor's State of the City speech was a reaffirmation of his sensitivity to the problems that surround him at the midpoint of what he pointedly called his first term, it was also a reminder of the work ahead.
Absent were specifics on how he will carry out his proposals, from revamping neighborhood health clinics to speeding up city construction projects to boost the economy, or on the deep spending cuts he will announce when he presents his preliminary budget in two weeks.

At Last, Women In the Biathlon
This was the moment that a group of young women, considered eccentric by some, had worked for, winter and summer, for four years.
So why shouldn't Joan Smith's brother pop a champagne cork?
And why shouldn't a disappointed Anna Sonnerup walk off with tears in her eyes?


Amid Bright Colors, an Oasis of White
White is hot.
It's also cool.
At a time when color is exploding all over the fashion world, white is soothing.
Its impact will be growing in the next few seasons.
Most designers like it neat: no jewels, no color accents, no complications.
Women whose bodies can take the glare have long known that the most dramatic style they can wear to the beach is a white swimsuit -- black is the second.
The impact of a white organdy blouse or even a white T-shirt is unchallenged.
White silk, linen or cotton pants have long been a summer staple in smart women's summer wardrobes.


Chad Says It Crushed Rebellion, Killing 425
The Government said today that it had crushed a rebellion by forces loyal to former President Hissen Habre and killed 425 of his troops in fighting west of Ndjamena, the capital.
An official communique on the state radio said hundreds more rebels had been wounded when Government forces recaptured the town of Bol and three smaller army bases in the Lake Chad area of this African country.


NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Bear, Del.;
A COMMUNITY of town houses is enjoying brisk sales thanks to a partnership created to stimulate affordable housing.
The community, Amberfield, about six miles southwest of Wilmington off Interstate 40 in the small community of Bear, is the first development to offer homes to moderate-income buyers under the new Delaware Housing Partnership, whose members include the state Housing Authority, New Castle County, the Delaware Business Roundtable and the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce.
Its creation, meant to bring home ownership over the next three to five years to up to 800 buyers with incomes as low as $24,900, was announced by Gov.
Michael N. Castle in September.


Catching a Mediterranean Flavor With Salt Cod
SALT COD (also known as baccala in Italy) is a humble food that has become something of a luxury.
Dried in the sun and salted, it has for centuries been a basic dish in Europe, particularly around the Mediterranean.
It is the main ingredient in the famous French dish called brandade, in which salt cod is whipped into a puree with potatoes, garlic and olive oil.
It is also extremely popular in Italy, where it is traditionally eaten at Christmastime and New Year's.
In the United States, salt cod can be found in Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Italian markets, in specialty stores and in some of the larger supermarkets.
Choose plump, soft pieces with an ivory-colored flesh and, if possible, avoid stringy tail ends, which may never lose their leathery quality even when cooked.


Herzog, Still Shopping, Makes Up With Gilbert
A few weeks ago, Whitey Herzog seemed ready to bury a hatchet in Dennis Gilbert's head.
Now, reality has overridden anger, and Herzog has buried the hatchet with the agent.
As a result, the friends-again will meet Tuesday to talk about the best baseball free agent still unsigned, Danny Tartabull.
"I called Go-Go the other day," Herzog said, referring to Gilbert by the name he acquired as a minor league player with the Mets.
"I said let's forget about the Bonilla thing and let's go from there."


Barcelona Theft
To the Editor: My friend and I were mugged in Barcelona on Aug. 26.
Although warned by our hotel clerk not to venture into the area of the Iglesia de San Pablo del Campo, since we had traveled all over Spain in August with only two minor incidents -- one in Madrid and the other in Seville, we went to this site, just off the Ramblas.
There wasn't much to see -- the church was closed -- and we walked a short distance to the subway to return to our hotel.
On entering the subway, a young man. came from nowhere and grabbed at my bag.
It was hard to take off easily, so he knocked me to the ground and my friend was pushed and went flying down.
I was kicked in the shins and had many bruises.
Of course my bag was taken.


Falcons Needed the Run-and-Bumbershoot
When the Atlanta Falcons arrived at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium this morning and saw the steady rain pelting the field and turning it into mud, they knew that their Red Gun offense could drown and that their playoff hopes might go down with it.
"I expected problems with footing in the passing game," said the Falcons' quarterback, Chris Miller.
"There was no way I thought it would come to this."


Items to Augment a Basic Tool Kit
MANY home repair tasks can be accomplished with only a basic kit of tools: tape measure, claw hammer, crosscut saw, hack saw, regular and Phillips-head screwdrivers, pliers, adjustable wrench and electric drill.
But owning some other tools can broaden the range of jobs one can do and make some familiar chores easier.
Following is a list of tools to augment a basic kit.
To save money, buy tools only as needed.

A COSMOLOGICAL EVENT
Having just read Timothy Ferris's article "A Cosmological Event" (Dec. 15), I find myself marveling not at the "course of cosmic history" but at the dialectical gymnastics required to avoid the obvious.
Ferris considers the astonishing tales of hikers in free fall and determines, as a result, that the near-death experience may well be a matter of polypeptides.
He asks why human beings undergo not agony but ecstasy on their deathbeds, and concludes: "It may not be unreasonable to suppose that life on earth resonates with internal and external harmonies as yet unnoticed by science."
Pardon me, but I fail to understand why harmonic communication with the forces of earth should be a more plausible explanation for near-death experiences than the presence of an afterlife.
Where Ferris sees polypeptides, I see God.

FLASHCARD
MORE American teen-agers believe in heaven than in hell.
The latest Gallup Youth Survey reports that 90 percent of the teen-agers interviewed said they believe there is a heaven where people who have led good lives are eternally rewarded.
By contrast, 75 percent of the 513 youngsters ages 13 to 17 said that they believe in a hell where the wicked are punished.
The nationwide poll found that teen-agers who have attended religious services during the previous week were more likely to believe in either heaven or hell than those who did not attend services.

UP AND COMING: Kimberly Williams; For an Actress, Life Rivals Art, But Only So Much
Kimberly Williams, the 20-year-old actress who plays the bride in "Father of the Bride," would like to make one thing clear: she does not intend to have a fancy wedding.
It's the question of the hour for this newcomer of the season, and over a shrimp cocktail at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan, she is forced once again to disabuse a reporter of the notion.
"My parents have already assured me that I'm not going to have a wedding like that," she says, referring to the movie's silk-and-satin, swan-bedecked, $250-a-plate extravaganza.


POSTINGS: On the Waterfront; More Office Space for Jersey City
Harsimus Cove South, the name given to a 52-acre development site along the Hudson River in Jersey City, is adjusting to the times.
Its developer has begun to market it to builders primarily as a commercial site and has changed the name in the process.
The project is now called Hudson Exchange.
The site, filled with scraggly marsh weeds, lies between Newport, the big Lefrak Organization residential-retail-office project to the north, and the Harborside Financial Center to the south.
Initially, Harsimus Cove South was to have up to 2,200 apartments and town houses and eight million square feet of offices.
An additional 30 acres, which are under water, are to be used for a 250-boat marina.
But now "we are changing the development's emphasis by replacing housing along the water's edge with offices and adding more retail than orginally planned," said Thomas Leane, the project manager for the owner, National Bulk Carriers of Manhattan, which is owned by Daniel K. Ludwig.


OPENING THE DOOR
As someone who has lived in a Manhattan brownstone, I, too, have experienced middle-of-the-night pleas for help for a variety of emergencies.
Sadly, I have ignored most of them.
I have a family, and it comes first.
Once, when a request sounded legitimate, I offered to make a phone call (in this instance, the stranger left when I offered to do this).
I find it hard to understand why Grossman did not exercise this much safer option.

U.S. Sees Major Policy Shift in Plan for Commonwealth Loans

The changes, first spelled out by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d last month in his Soviet policy speech at Princeton, are forcing agencies across the Federal Government to reconsider longstanding policies.

In This Book, The ABC's Of Therapy
FOR a young child about to embark on psychological counseling, the world can become full of anxious questions.

In Hartford, a Revival of Albee's 'Virginia Woolf'
THE word was out even though the reviews were not yet in.
A stunning new play, the first full-length work by an acknowledged Off Broadway playwright in his Broadway debut was about to open and it was already a hot ticket.
Paul Weidner remembered that he was "lucky to get a last-minute cancellation in the fifth row at preview prices" for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" by Edward Albee.
Then a 27-year-old Yale Drama School graduate, Mr.
Weidner held odd jobs as a gofer, an Off Off Broadway actor and a stage manager, he said.
"I was a hopeful director, eager to break into theater, expecting it to turn into something wonderful."


Competition Winner Makes a Connecticut Debut
AT 3 P.M. today in Cathedral Theater in Hartford, Chamber Music Plus presents one of the first recitals of the new year, an excursion into "Viennese Verve," with Sonatas of Mozart and Robert Starer leading to the B-flat Trio of Franz Schubert.
The violinist Renee Jolles joins the group's founders, the cellist Harry Clark and the pianist Sanda Schuldmann (232-0085).
Competitions are popular these days but not all artists can play their best under the pressure of auditions and the glare of press coverage.
For those reasons, several alternatives have been developed.
The Avery Fisher Prize for instrumentalists and the Marian Anderson Award for singers are prime examples of prestigious recognitions given to artists who, in most instances, are unaware they are being considered for the honor.
The selections are made by a panel of musicians, managers and others weighing reviews, artist recommendations and evaluations.


Ms. Portman Plans to Wed

A May wedding is planned.
Ms.
Portman, 27 years old, is the women's program coordinator at Covenant House in New York.
She graduated from the State University of New York at Oneonta and received a master's degree in social work from Columbia University, as did her fiance.
Her father is the vice president of the American Boarts Crushing Company, an industrial diamond concern in Woodside, Queens.
Her mother, Tamah Portman, is a painter and the president of VIP Parties Inc., a party-planning company in East Meadow.


A Battle Looms for Bush On Another Asian Front
WHEN President Bush returns to Washington this week, he is likely to find that many members of Congress are at least as disturbed by his policy toward China, which is not included on his Asian trip, as they are about his policy toward Japan.
A common lament on Capitol Hill is that the President does not have a consistent or credible policy for dealing with Beijing, whose human rights record is flawed, whose support of authoritarian regimes in Asia is expanding, and whose role in the international arms market is a cause of concern worldwide.
The perception that China policy -- or the lack of it -- is a weak point in Mr.
Bush's handling of foreign affairs stands out all the more because he has more personal knowledge of the Chinese than did any of his predecessors.
In 1974-75 he headed the United States Liaison Office in Beijing, the precursor to the embassy.


Huff-Huff, Bang-Bang: It's Run-and-Shoot Fever
Three of the eight teams that made the National Football League divisional playoffs were run-and-shoot teams, an indication that something about that offense must be working.

Swiss Tolls
To the Editor: Not long ago I crossed the whole length of Switzerland by car on one of the main expressways, entering from Liechtenstein and exiting at Geneva.
Afterward, I was told by friends that a toll is due for driving on the Swiss expressways and that I could have been heavily fined.
There was not the slightest indication anywhere on the route I took that a toll was due, so I checked with the Swiss Tourist Office in New York.
Yes, the young woman said, a toll was indeed due in the form of a sticker or "vignette," costing 30 Swiss francs.
When I said that I could see no indication that one was required, I was told that signs are posted at border crossings and that one should familiarize oneself with foreign driving regulations.


POSTINGS: $185 Million in Improvements; New Laboratories for City College
As part of a $185 million campus improvement project at City College, the 30-year-old Steinman Hall laboratory building is now under renovation.
The six-story, 300,000-square-foot structure on Convent Avenue, between 140th and 141st Streets, is to get new laboratories, a new facade of steel panels and an additional 14,000 square feet.
The architects are Pomerance &amp; Breines and the mechanical engineers are Ambrosino, DePinto &amp; Schmieder, both of Manhattan.
"The Steinman Hall project is merely one of many ongoing and just-completed renovations," said Prof.
Richard Zerneck, acting director of facilities and space planning.
Also under rehabilitation are Shepard Hall, Harris Hall and Compton/ Goethals Hall.
In January, Professor Zerneck said, the college expects to begin work on the new Herman Goldman Center for Sports and Recreation -- a soccer and lacrosse field ringed by a 400-meter track, with bleachers for 1,500 people.


U.S. Hockey Team Hits Lots of Bumps on Road
The road to Albertville, France, or more precisely to the nearby village of Meribel, has been long and arduous for the United States hockey team.
And the end is still not in sight.
The tired squad, its players weary of life on the road, lost nine straight games before a seven-day Christmas break.


A Shelter Reaches Out to 'Children in Crisis'
A FEW months ago the parents snapped.
They deposited their three children -- 2, 4 and 6 years old -- on a neighbor's doorstep, saying only, "Please take care of them." Then the couple, residents of an affluent town in lower Fairfield County, took off.
The youngsters ended up in three different foster homes across the state.
If they had been 12 and older, they could have found help together at the Youth Shelter on Prospect Street in Greenwich, which provides around-the-clock crisis intervention and is a temporary home for teen-agers with family problems.


In Chappaqua, the Revival of a Chamber Group
CHAMBER MUSIC lovers can look forward to next Saturday at the Chappaqua Library Theater, when the renamed and reorganized Chappaqua Chamber Orchestra performs a revival program.
"Friends of chamber music can mark a joyous event on their calendars," said Mary Rohde, publicity chairwoman of the group.
"Both players and former subscribers have been eager for this community orchestra to resume its excellent concerts."


Q and A
Right to Sue  Question: We bought a small building in Manhattan.
Before signing the contract, we showed the building to a licensed building engineer.
The report said that the mechanical systems and appliances were in good condition.
However, after closing, it was discovered that the wooden columns in the basement were damaged, probably as a result of long-term water action.
The damage had been concealed by the previous owner, who we believe had covered the columns with plasterboard.


Making a Difference; Mr. Oshman's Second Act
Few Silicon Valley entrepreneurs hit the big time twice.
M.
Kenneth Oshman is hoping to be an exception.
Mr.
Oshman, 51, co-founded and was president of the Rolm Corporation, which grew into a major telecommunications equipment company before running into trouble after its acquisition by the International Business Machines Corporation in 1984.


World Markets; The Strange Appeal of a Slowdown
The pace of investment by those who helped to discover the world's emerging stock markets is slowing down because many of the great bargains, like Latin America, have already been well mined.
According to a survey by Kleiman International Consultants, a majority of institutional investors in these markets said they expect to hold onto their current level of investment in these volatile markets in 1992.
Those who plan to increase their share of investment expect it to be at a rate lower than last year.

At the Met, Ghosts Come to Applaud 'Ghosts'
First Figaro appeared on-stage in drag, his phony bust nearly bursting out of his bodice as he tried to offer Count Almaviva a fig.
Then he was chased about in a Keystone Kops-style melee, until he leaped onto a giant plastic sultan and set off fireworks from the turban.
But well before this finale to the first act of the new opera "The Ghosts of Versailles," it was clear enough to the laughing audience at the Metropolitan Opera that the composer John Corigliano and the librettist William M. Hoffman were not really writing a conventional sequel to "The Marriage of Figaro."
The characters were the same, many of the allusions similar, and Beaumarchais's own sequel inspired the festivities, but here Figaro was embedded in a fantastical farce, including floating ghosts, perverse villains, Beaumarchais himself and music that merrily and sentimentally plundered from Mozart and Rossini.
The laughter was partly due to funhouse thrills; it even had an edgy, nervous quality.


A Hollow Catharsis
To the Editor:
It appears to be fashionable these days to expend great quantities of creative energy making bold statements about victimized American citizens.
The arts, of course, reflect society in general.
A prolonged recession has hurt many of us and has scared the rest.
Artistic endeavors like "J. F. K." capitalize on our fears by reinforcing the attitude that we aren't responsible: someone else did it -- we need to get even.
Instead of being ennobled by the creative experience, we get a hollow catharsis of anger and defensiveness.
It's a cheap substitute.


In the Real World
To the Editor:
In "Reducing Tenure in the Boardroom" (Forum, Dec. 22), Jayne Barnard points out a problem of lingering unproductive corporate directors.
But her suggestions to address the problem ignore some realities of the world of corporate governance.


Staying by the Beach: Hotels of All Sizes
VISITORS to Santa Monica, drawn by its setting on the Pacific and its proximity to some of the West Coast's best restaurants and museums -- the Getty is only 10 minutes away -- have an appealing choice of accommodations, ranging from the new and modern to the slightly funky to an intimate bed-and-breakfast.
Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel
Certainly no Santa Monica hotel is better situated than Loews, a 350-room extravaganza on the Pacific that was opened two and a half years ago.
To take advantage of the light and the sweeping views of wide flat beaches, the hotel is built around a five-story glass atrium with a skylight.
To enhance the maritime flavor, the lobby has been decorated in pale blues and pinks, with bamboo sofas and potted palms.
The exterior of Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel relies on the pinks and beiges popular in seaside resorts.


Oliver Stone Manipulates His Puppet
Oliver Stone's "J. F. K." achieves an unintended irony when it exhorts its audience to be suspicious of unreliable information, since the figure who emerges from this three-hour-and-eight-minute harangue as the most suspect is the film maker himself.
This has nothing to do with Mr.
Stone's opinions about who may have been responsible for the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and everything to do with the way those opinions are expressed.
If there's anything that the recent firestorm of front-page news about "J. F. K." makes evident, it's that Mr.
Stone is his own best invention.
As a once-conservative, now-disaffected figure free to question authority and celebrate iconoclasm, he has perfected a beleaguered public posture and a raffish world-weary manner.
This plays very well on talk shows and even better on the screen, where most of Mr.
Stone's heroes have embodied similar attitudes in their quest for truth.


Making a Difference; A Big Break in Biotech
A long-awaited breakthrough finally came late last month for 10-year-old Crop Genetics International and Joseph W. Kelly, its 47-year-old chairman and chief executive.
On Dec. 27, Crop Genetics announced that it had formed an alliance with E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company to develop naturally occurring insect viruses into pesticides.
Without financial and marketing support from large corporate partners, few startup biotechnology companies can hope to survive.
And though Crop Genetics has a long way to go before it can compare its success in developing such alliances to companies like Mycogen and Calgene, even one such deal wins kudos on Wall Street.


The Theater of AIDS: Attention Must Be Paid
In a country beset with so many problems that it is hard to know where to direct a helping hand, the theater seems to have paid greatest attention to AIDS.
The concern is understandable.
The ravages of the epidemic have been particularly acute in the theater, which has suffered horrible losses across the board -- playwrights, performers, designers, as well as all those who labor behind the scenes.
This is not to deny the awful facts of homelessness or the deterioration of the environment or society's increasingly callous disregard for the welfare of its children.
But you fight the scourge on your doorstep first.
And in the theater that's been AIDS.


CAMPUS LIFE: Tufts; A Fraternity, Disciplined Twice, Faces New Threat
It all began last September when members of the Psi Upsilon fraternity chapter were accused of spray-painting obscenities and nude figures on the hood of a student's car.
Within two months, six fraternity members were put on probation and the fraternity itself was suspended for the spring semester.
Now the six students may be dislodged from their off-campus residence in Somerville, a town where many of the university's academic and residential activities are centered.
That is the goal of an angry Somerville alderman, Jack Connolly, who says of the fraternity: "They have an 'Animal House' reputation."


GRADY'S GIFT
I am a descendant of several "Gradys." My mother, grandmother, godmother and aunts have all worked, some longer than others, as domestics in white households at varying points in their lives.
It is within this context that I read Raines's article on his coming of age in Birmingham, Ala.
Regardless of how much Grady may have enriched their lives, the Raines family perceived her largely in terms of the position she held as a maid in the household.
Had they seen her as an individual, with dreams and ambitions, perhaps they might have assisted her in some way in achieving her goals.
The lesson to be learned is that proximity to the powerful is not necessarily beneficial.
This may help whites to understand why so many African-Americans grimace in anger when they hear that a former servant was treated "just like a member of the family." YVONNE V. JONES

A COSMOLOGICAL EVENT
It is possible that some of the visual phenomena associated with near-death experiences, particularly phenomena relating to a dark tunnel followed by brilliant, radiant light, may have to do with successful resuscitation and recovery.
This would be the expected sequence of events if the visual centers of the brain, the occipital lobes, were deprived of, and then resupplied with, blood.
This would happen if the heart stopped and was then restarted.
I trust that a mechanistic explanation does not detract from the beauty or significance of these experiences.

Stabilize the Banks and Reverse the Recession; Help Small Business
To the Editor:
The state of the economy has produced an environment that allows our major corporations to downsize rapidly.
The news media have been making much of this, though it has been going on for some time without fanfare.
With the coming Presidential election, our politicians have noted the increasing number of unemployed.
What has gone unnoticed is that many of the people losing jobs at large companies have been re-employed by small companies.
Small businesses provide more jobs than big business.
Yet we seem to do everything possible to stifle the creation of new companies.


Redskins Score a Very Mushy Victory
The playoff game here this afternoon wasn't pretty, not with the heavy rain or the muddy grass field that became so treacherous -- and certainly not with the Falcons' inability to hold on to the ball, which resulted in six Atlanta turnovers.
It wasn't efficient, not with the wasted turnovers and the never-ending field-goal attempts wide of the goal posts.


Women Take To the Field
NORTHBROOK, ILL., was a sports town even 25 years ago, and not just for men.
Several young women were training for the United States Olympic speed-skating team, and at Glenbrook North High School the largest club was the Girls Athletic Association.
But it didn't seem odd that the school's 1967 yearbook devoted 38 pages to boys' sports and 5 to girls', or that on the faculty there were 22 male coaches and 6 women, or that girls had no interscholastic teams.
That was just the way things were.
Now, Glenbrook North offers 11 interscholastic sports for boys and 11 for girls.
More than 40 percent of the girls are on these teams, and others play intramural sports.
"We can't complain about wanting for anything," said Marilyn Bradley, assistant athletic director.
Girls use the main gym and work out in the weight room.
That's the way things are.

New &amp; Noteworthy
A DANGEROUS WOMAN, by Mary McGarry Morris. (Penguin, $10.) The author of "Vanished" tells the bleak and arresting story of Martha Horgan, a disturbed woman in a small Vermont town whose desperate efforts to be accepted alienate every life she touches.
"At once thrilling and deeply affecting, 'A Dangerous Woman' should burnish Ms. Morris's reputation as one of the most skillful new writers at work in America today," Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year.
LONELY HEARTS OF THE COSMOS: The Scientific Quest for the Secret of the Universe, by Dennis Overbye. (Harper Perennial, $13.) Somehow, about 10 billion years after the birth of the universe, conglomerations of atoms (little packets of energy forged in stars) congealed into astronomers and cosmologists with the disturbing ability to wonder what it all means.
Last year our reviewer, James Gleick, said Dennis Overbye's spirited chronicle of their scientific adventure makes for "vivid and passionate telling. . . . For his sense of their culture of science -- the traditions, the slang, the rivalries, the unwritten rules -- Mr. Overbye makes himself a wonderful tour guide."


Catching a Mediterranean Flavor With Salt Cod
SALT COD (also known as baccala in Italy) is a humble food that has become something of a luxury.
Dried in the sun and salted, it has for centuries been a basic dish in Europe, particularly around the Mediterranean.
It is the main ingredient in the famous French dish called brandade, in which salt cod is whipped into a puree with potatoes, garlic and olive oil.
It is also extremely popular in Italy, where it is traditionally eaten at Christmastime and New Year's.
In the United States, salt cod can be found in Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Italian markets, in specialty stores and in some of the larger supermarkets.
Choose plump, soft pieces with an ivory-colored flesh and, if possible, avoid stringy tail ends, which may never lose their leathery quality even when cooked.


Sports of The Times; The Mud Is Redskins' Element
SOMEDAY soon, it will all be antiseptic, the players laboring dry and clean on some artificial carpet in the sterility of a dome.
And what a shame.
The spectacle of the Redskins and the Falcons, slogging in the mud of Robert F. Kennedy Stadium, was a gripping throwback to the old days well beyond the Decatur Staleys and the Frankford Yellow Jackets, back to the time when tribes would battle each other on some rainswept plain.


Man Sought in Rape of 5 Women In Three Queens Neighborhoods
Attacking lone women after they get off buses or jitneys, a man has raped and robbed five women in three Queens neighborhoods since September, New York City police officials said yesterday.
In each case, the suspect has grabbed the victim from behind as she walked home from the bus stop, placed a metal object that may have been a gun to her head, and demanded money.
He then put a knit cap over the woman's face and forced her to an isolated spot where he sexually attacked her, according to the police reports of the five incidents.


China's Party Chief Plans Trip to Japan
China's Communist Party leader will visit Japan in the first half of 1992, the two Governments said today in an announcement that underscores Japan's decision to lead the way among industrialized countries in rebuilding ties with Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.
The announcement represents a modest triumph for the Communist Party leader, Jiang Zemin, who is officially described as the successor to Deng Xiaoping as China's paramount leader, although real power is expected to remain with Mr.
Deng during his lifetime.
Mr.
Jiang has visited the Soviet Union and North Korea, but with the collapse of Communism abroad there are fewer and fewer countries for him to visit to promote party-to-party ties.


Arabs Delay Leaving for Talks But U.S. Expects a Resumption
Syria, Lebanon and Jordan postponed the departure of their negotiating teams today for the second round of peace talks with Israel in Washington, joining the Palestinians in protest over Israel's planned deportation of 12 Palestinians from the occupied territories.
United States officials said, however, that they expected the Palestinians, Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese to turn up in Washington, where the talks are scheduled to resume at the State Department on Tuesday.
The officials said that the four delegations apparently felt the need to make some gesture of protest over the Israeli actions, but that none of them appeared to want to scuttle the talks over the issue.
More Explosive Issue
The chief Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said by telephone from her home in the West Bank that the Palestinians "are making our point" by delaying their departure.
But she said it was her "surmise" that the Palestinians and others would end up going to Washington, now that the United States has strongly condemned the Israeli deportation orders.
At the first round of Washington negotiations in December, Israel postponed its delegation's arrival in protest the venue of the talks, which Israel had wanted to hold in the Middle East.

OLYMPICS: Albertville Profile; Yamaguchi Has Her Sights Set at a Higher Level
There are skaters all around her, gliding and floating through the air and causing a maze of bodies that intersect but somehow never seem to collide.
Yet Kristi Yamaguchi, her smallish figure breezing from one end of the indoor rink to the other in balletic gusts, appears solitary.
She is so lithe and light, and so wonderfully graceful, that even in the midst of a routine practice session with her coach, Christy Kjarsgaard-Ness, Yamaguchi stands apart from the crowd.
There is the temptation to find a gold medal to place on her shoulders.
But there is time for that.

Mt. Vernon Challenges Definition Of a Family
FOR the last two years, the city of Mount Vernon has been trying to prevent a nonprofit housing group from building a two-family house in a depressed neighborhood for use as a communal home for 12 elderly people.
The project would cost the city nothing, provide affordable housing for the city's growing population of low-income elderly and improve a site that has been an abandoned lot and garbage dump.
But Mount Vernon has opposed the establishment of what it calls a boarding house, a use the city prohibits in a residential neighborhood with single-family zoning.


On the Appalachian Trail, Lessons in Living
LAST April 8, after nine months of marriage, Leticia Lacativa and David Fleischman set out from Springer Mountain in Georgia to walk the Appalachian Trail.
Five months and more than 2,000 miles later, on Sept. 13, the couple reached Paxter Peak on Mount Katahdin in Maine, the trail's end.
Their story, shared recently over coffee in their cozy home here, tells of the joys of achievement, the surprises of unexpected friendships and the strains that for a time threatened to pull their relationship apart.


A G.O.P. Leader Aims At 'Welfare State' Values
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the second-ranking Republican in the House, has laid down a confrontational approach to this year's Congressional session by claiming to be Washington's "true revolutionary" and pledging to spend the year battling the "welfare state."
A speech Friday by Mr.
Gingrich set out an election-year theme that reflected his belief that his party will never escape minority status in Congress by working with the controlling Democrats.


If You Love Gloves, Clap Your Hands
Gloves can be among the most important accessories in a wardrobe.
They suggest character and give the wearer an excuse to "talk" with her hands.
Sometimes they speak for themselves.
Daniel Storto, for instance, sometimes creates glove designs as a protest of society's morals, like his "Ten Commandment" style, in which a commandment is inscribed on each pair in bold, white block letters on black suede gauntlets.


Ms. Canaday To Wed in June
Siesel E. Canaday of Old Lyme, Conn., and Katherine M. Canaday of Bronxville, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter Jennifer Bryan Canaday to Patrick Thomas Holleran, a son of Mary Steffen Holleran of Carlsbad, Calif., and the late Dr.
Walter M. Holleran.
A June wedding is planned.
Ms.
Canaday, 27 years old, is a postproduction coordinator for Saban Entertainment, a cartoon animating company in Burbank, Calif.
She graduated from Smith College.
Her father, who is retired, was an investment banker in New York with John Nuveen &amp; Company.
Her mother is a volunteer coordinator for Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York.


Yeshivas Defy The Odds
THIRTY years ago the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School was in a dilapidated building surrounded by tenements and rubble-strew lots on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
The school, called a yeshiva, had 500 boys in its elementary division and I was one of them.
I have memories of rabbis who spoke with the accents of Eastern Europe, of recesses spent playing punchball in the streets and of general studies teachers who went on strike when paychecks were late.


Suspended Player Says He'll Tell All
A University of Texas basketball player who was suspended earlier this season for having accepted a gift of money when he graduated from a Texas junior college in 1990, said Friday that he would tell a National Collegiate Athletic Association subcommittee about improper offers of money that he received two years ago from prominent N.C.A.A. schools.
The player, Dexter Cambridge, is scheduled to meet with the N.C.A.A.'s subcommittee on eligibility appeals for Division I in Anaheim, Calif., on Tuesday to appeal his suspension.
The suspension was imposed on Nov. 20 after the N.C.A.A. ruled he had accepted a $7,000 check from Keith Heingartner, a former assistant coach at Lon Morris Junior College in Jacksonville, Tex.

In Those Days It Paid To Be Clever
A small and elegant exhibition has opened at the Philadelphia Museum of Art which focuses on a picture that resists simple description.
The work is from the turn of the 17th century by the Dutch master Hendrick Goltzius, and it represents a seated Venus, her right hand gently clasped to one of Cupid's wings, her left hand resting on the shoulder of a young Bacchus.
To her side stands a grizzled satyr offering a bunch of grapes.
The scene, set in a forest, is illuminated by the warm light of Cupid's torch.
The subject almost certainly derives from a maxim in a comedy by Terence, the ancient Roman dramatist: "without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus freezes" -- without food and wine, love grows cold.


At Last, Russia Wobbles Into the World of Real Money
FINALLY, after weeks of warnings and debates about the coming "liberalization" of prices, millions of Russians woke up last week to find that the price of bread and gasoline had tripled and that vodka cost four times what it used to.
Gone were the days of some of the world's best state-subsidized bargains, such as an air ticket between Moscow and Vladivostok that, until Jan. 2, cost the same as two reasonably plump chickens sold privately at the Central Market.
So, it's done, the first wobbly step across the threshold to a market economy.
And while people are not clapping themselves on the back -- it is far too early for that -- the reformers were relieved that the first jolt of shock therapy Russian-style had been administered without any violent reaction.

Making a Difference; It's Mea Culpa Time For Savings and Loans
Donald B. Shackelford has one of this town's most difficult lobbying jobs: reviving the United States League of Savings Institutions, the once-powerful trade group that ultimately became a victim of its own successes.
Mr.
Shackelford is chairman of the league, which was so good in the 1980's at keeping the Government from more tightly regulating the savings and loan industry that even it now acknowledges it contributed mightily to the costliest bailout in American history.

Sunday Dinner; In 3 Manhattan Hotels, Tranquil, Spacious Oases
Now that the tumultuous holidays are over, it is time to slow down, catch one's breath and contemplate the year to come.
If a restaurant is to be the setting for such regeneration, let it be a tranquil and relaxing one.
Here are three such settings.
Le Regence
Plaza Athenee, 37 East 64th Street, (212) 606-4647.
This opulent French restaurant has the genteel air and calming cadence of a luxury restaurant in Paris.
This is no surprise since the hotel is the American branch of the esteemed Paris hotel of the same name.
The setting is regal, a soft and stately den done in turquoise and white, with velvet banquettes, soft leather armchairs, ornate mirrors and benign lighting.
Service is discreet and knowledgeable.


Ex-New York Official Told to Pay $10 Million in Bribe Case
A former New York City official who pleaded guilty to taking $1.5 million in bribes from landlords for arranging leases has been ordered to pay the city $10.1 million for his crimes.
A Manhattan State Supreme Court jury ruled on Monday that Alex Liberman, a former New York City director of leasing, was liable for violating the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and ordered him to pay the city $3.75 million.
Under the RICO statute, which has been used increasingly to prosecute white-collar criminals, the jury's award will be tripled to $10.1 million, city officials said.


Birds Contribute Color to a Lively Yard
PERHAPS it is their sweet sound.
Or their bright colors or just their presence.
But feeding birds is always a plus.
One of the best ways to be sure they will come to the yard is to supply their favorite foods, especially if the winter is harsh.
This custom is also a way to learn what species are about.
To reinforce this process, keep a bird guide near the window to identify that chance rare one that may come around.
Also, keep binoculars in a convenient place for a quick grab.
These magnifiers are handy because sometimes it is difficult to detect that eye line or wing patch.
Having said all this, there still are a few pointers to keep in mind.

Stabilize the Banks and Reverse the Recession; Not by Neglect Alone
To the Editor:
It is surely accurate to say that Presidential neglect contributes greatly to our domestic economic plight.
However, neglect conveys a flavor of just not getting around to something.
It would be more appropriate to remain mindful of the active role that Reagan-Bush planning and policies have played in bringing us to where we are.


It's Finally Made Official: Elliott Joins Junior Johnson's Team
In one of the corporate hospitality suites at the Nascar Winston Cup awards dinner last month in New York, a banner had a blank space that said a lot.
The banner depicted the No. 11 Junior Johnson Ford entry.
It was complete with all its Budweiser logos.
Only the spot over the left window where the driver's name usually goes was empty.


Bodyscapes
Here in the surreal setting of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park are the season's new white bathing suits.
Whether they are sleek maillots, sheaths or two-pieces, all have subtle elements of detailing reminiscent of lingerie or couture dressmaking.
A brassiere is quilted, a bikini is belted.
Underwiring or shirring defines the bosom, and luxurious materials like lame and crepe are laced with Lycra to make them practical.

Tamils Are Target of Riots in Southern India
The school principal stood in the ruins of the library, a blackened shell of a room, after riots in this southern Indian city left 16 people dead and hundreds of buildings destroyed recently.
"My life's work has been destroyed," the principal, K. P. Gopal Krishna, said as he walked through the wrecked building, glass crunching underfoot, walls scarred with smoke and prized books reduced to small ash heaps.
Computers were stolen, and the national school's new science laboratory was smashed.

Catching a Mediterranean Flavor With Salt Cod
SALT COD (also known as baccala in Italy) is a humble food that has become something of a luxury.
Dried in the sun and salted, it has for centuries been a basic dish in Europe, particularly around the Mediterranean.
It is the main ingredient in the famous French dish called brandade, in which salt cod is whipped into a puree with potatoes, garlic and olive oil.
It is also extremely popular in Italy, where it is traditionally eaten at Christmastime and New Year's.
In the United States, salt cod can be found in Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Italian markets, in specialty stores and in some of the larger supermarkets.
Choose plump, soft pieces with an ivory-colored flesh and, if possible, avoid stringy tail ends, which may never lose their leathery quality even when cooked.


Miss Hold Wed To T. S. Leggett
Phyllis Handley Hold, the daughter of Annette-Gene Hold of Garrison, N.Y., and the late Lucien A. Hold Jr., was married yesterday to Timothy Snowden Leggett, a son of Mary Lee Leggett of New York and John W. Leggett of Napa, Calif.
The Rev.
Frank Geer, an Episcopal priest, officiated at the Highlands Country Club in Garrison.
Mrs.
Leggett, 39 years old, is the renal transplant coordinator at the St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.
She graduated from Fairfield University and received a master's degree in social work from New York University.
Her mother retired as a promotions copywriter for Reader's Digest in Pleasantville, N.Y.
Her father was the president of the Cold Spring (N.Y.) Lumber Company.


In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester; Amid Recession, a Recovery for Shelton
TWO years ago, the vacancy rate for Shelton's six million square feet of office and industrial buildings was 37 percent, the highest in Fairfield County.
This was a result of a building spree that began in the late 70's, when the city courted developers in an effort to shed its smokestack image and create a more viable economy.
Hundreds of thousands of square feet of new commercial space came on the market in time for the 1987 crash.


REACHING FOR THE GOOD LIFE IN VIETNAM
Lam Van lives the Vietnamese good life selling shiny new Dreams.
Honda Dreams -- 8.5-horsepower, $2,000 motorbikes manufactured in Thailand -- are the most coveted status symbol on the streets of Saigon, the bustling, hustling Vietnamese metropolis that almost no one calls by its still-official name, Ho Chi Minh City.
"Everyone calls it Saigon," says Van, who owns a small motorbike shop.
"We never stopped calling it Saigon." Business has been so good that the 31-year-old entrepreneur can afford to smoke black-market English-made John Player cigarettes, wear a gold Longines watch and join his friends most nights at the city's neon-flooded Superstar disco, where he rocks to bootleg recordings from Guns 'n' Roses and Madonna, his "No. 1 favorite" recording star.


Holding Back To Get Ahead
IN the 1950's, when the children of the baby boom were in elementary school, being held back for a year was an indelible mark of failure, while being the youngest in class was sometimes considered a sign of brilliance.
Now that the boomers themselves are parents, everything has changed.
Recent studies show that since the mid-1980's a rapidly increasing number of parents are choosing to send their children through an extra year of preschool so that they enter kindergarten as 6-year-olds, a year after the normal start time in most states.


MIA-POW Flag to Remain
The National Football League, bowing to pressure from veterans' groups and others, won't take down the MIA-POW flag hanging from the roof inside the Metrodome.
A league spokesman said Friday that the flag amounts to a political statement, which could prompt other groups to demand equal treatment.
"We get endless requests, whether it's the American Cancer Society or someone else," said Jim Steeg, director of special events for the N.F.L.
"We don't want to egg on more requests."


Exchange Teachers Are Getting a Taste of Life in America
FOR Aurora Gonzalez, a native of Spain who is spending the academic year at Valhalla High School, shopping at the Galleria Mall in White Plains, trying out Indian food and meeting a wide variety of new people from different backgrounds is an intoxicating experience.
Her reaction to living in America is typical, one would think, for an exchange student.
But Miss Gonzalez is not a student.
She is a foreign exchange teacher, working as an intern in Valhalla's Spanish-language classes, to offer students exposure to a native speaker who can add a valuable cultural dimension to the curriculum.

All-Day Delicacies: Scones of Scotland
IN Scotland the scone isn't just a quick tea bread, it's a national institution, and as such a legitimate target for home-grown humor.
A cartoon strip this August in the national newspaper The Scotsman, for instance, depicts panic in the Highlands as the local people learn that there will be no more money available for museums devoted to the history of the scone as foodstuff and metaphor through the ages.
But the fact is that Scottish foods have a celebrated place in the country's history and literature.
A whole school of 19th-century Scottish fiction is named for the kailyard -- Scottish for cabbage patch -- and scones have a much longer, more distinguished pedigree.
Boswell ate scones as he toured the Hebrides with Dr.
Johnson (he thought them very good, but couldn't understand how the Highlanders could eat them with cheese for breakfast).
In "Kidnapped," David Balfour and Alan Breck Stewart, fleeing the Redcoats, "lay upon the bare top of a rock like scones upon a girdle" (girdle is Scottish for griddle).
As for the poet Robert Burns, "souple scones" were "the wale of food" -- wale meaning simply "the best."

And I can't wait for the wrenching changes we shall surely suffer when the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace retools.

To the Editor:
Milton Hindus (letter, Dec. 17) rightly restores to our reading list the autobiography of Martin Van Buren, a wise and literate man; and, we should add, radically misguided.


Election Staffs Resemble Candidates
It is said that by some strange quirk of biology, dog owners and their pets come to resemble each other.
The same, it seems, can be said of candidates and the members of their campaign staffs.
Six weeks before the New Hampshire primary, each of the major candidates for President appears to have put together a staff that imitates, for good or for ill, his own strengths and weaknesses.
Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, for instance, has a reputation for being well-organized and disciplined; so, too, do his staff members.


Sheraton Puts In Coffee Makers
I.T.T.
Sheraton has announced that coffee makers will become a standard item in all guest rooms of its 300 hotels in North America.
The decision was made after coffee makers were tested at the Sheraton Park Central Hotel and Towers in Dallas and the Sheraton Cavalier Hotel in Calgary, Alberta.


Young At Heart
SEVERAL outstanding educational programs were introduced in the final months of 1991, and with luck they signal a trend rather than a few isolated success stories.
It seems that many of the young software developers who sharpened their skills on business software in the 1980's have now become parents and are applying their talents to educational software.


PITCAIRN ISLAND
Dea Birkett's account of her visit to Pitcairn Island was of particular interest to me ("Fletcher Christian's Children," Dec. 8).
I was one of eight passengers on the German cargo ship New Zealand when it made an unscheduled stop there on the morning of March 11, 1991.
Half of the island's population -- some 25 people, ranging in age from 12 to 70 -- turned out, in gloom and rain, aboard a 40-foot motorboat.


Elway's Drive II Kicks Out Oilers
Somewhere deep in his mind, John Elway must play these moments again and again, perhaps as much for pleasure as preparation.
One day, he will need to rewind and repeat them.
Five years after his most glorious moment with the Denver Broncos -- a 98-yard touchdown drive against the Cleveland Browns -- Elway engaged in heroics once more.
This time, it brought the Broncos from behind to a 26-24 victory today over the stunned Houston Oilers and into the American Football Conference championship game.


What Works
DESPITE THE continued grumbling about the nation's schools and the lack of money to fix them, eight years of school reform haven't been for naught.
The national obsession to retool schools has spawned ideas that work -- and work well.
At least seven such ideas have sprouted into successful full-fledged programs in classrooms nationwide.


Usual Suspects; Blaming Japan Has Its Risks; So Does Bush's Visit to Tokyo
EVEN by the rigorous standards of an American election year, Tokyo is a long way to go to try to win votes back home.
But in his three-day visit this week to Japan, President Bush will be doing precisely that, prodding the Japanese to open their markets and buy more American goods to help, he says, "create jobs and restore prosperity" in the United States.
Mr.
Bush and his advisers recognize that with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the international threat that most worries voters is no longer nuclear warfare but something far more subtle -- an erosion of living standards as American industries lag in the global competition with foreign rivals, especially Japan.
And those concerns have been magnified by recent announcements from pillars of corporate America, like General Motors and I.B.M., that they are cutting thousands of workers and permanently shrinking.


Political Talk
More Than a Backdrop
As a 27-year-old Democratic district leader in October 1977, Fernando Ferrer said he was "elated" when Jimmy Carter's motorcade pulled up to the rubble of Charlotte Street in the South Bronx, turning it into a famous symbol of urban America in need of help.

Items to Augment a Basic Tool Kit
MANY home repair tasks can be accomplished with only a basic kit of tools: tape measure, claw hammer, crosscut saw, hack saw, regular and Phillips-head screwdrivers, pliers, adjustable wrench and electric drill.
But owning some other tools can broaden the range of jobs one can do and make some familiar chores easier.
Following is a list of tools to augment a basic kit.
To save money, buy tools only as needed.

A report in the Travel Advisory column on Nov. 24 about the World Elephant Polo Association championships in Nepal misstated the dates of both the 1991 and 1992 events.

Who Would Move Money Where
When investors believe the economy will worsen, they are more likely to seek professional investment advice.
But affluent and ordinary investors look for guidance in different places, according to Russ Alan Prince and Richard K. Weingarten in a report called "Marketing Mutual Funds," to be published in February by Renaissance Inc. of Carmel, Ind.
In one survey, 298 investors with at least $1 million in liquid assets said they would tend to abandon mutual funds in favor of private money managers when times are bad, returning to funds as the outlook brightens.
But for another 3,442 investors surveyed at random, the opposite is true: a worsening economy would generally cause a movement into funds.
Because very affluent individuals make up only a small part of the investing public, continuing economic weakness may actually be good news for the fund industry, Mr.
Weingarten said.

Designer Makes Flowers That Complete a Room

"You have to get some movement," she said, as she bent and twisted the flower in the living room of her 1894 carriage house in Darien.
Mrs.
James said she would never treat a real flower this way.
But silk flowers, which are produced in a rigid, blatantly artificial state, "need to be handled," she said.
"It's very time consuming. There!" And she held up the transformed imposter.


The Executive Computer; Daunting Hurdles to Using System 7 on the Mac
Many executives and veteran computer users have long followed a policy of staying away from any software package whose version number ends in zero.
Often through bitter experience, they have learned that software publishers frequently view their initial customers as an extended testing ground.
Rather than contending with computer crashes and lost data, these veterans believe it is safer to wait for version 1.1, or even 1.5, rather than rush out to buy the hottest new program.
This philosophy caused considerable anxiety last year among the many companies that use Macintoshes.
After Apple Computer Inc.'s new operating system, 7.0, was introduced in May, companies had to decide whether to take the plunge.
Would the expected benefits in productivity be worth the anguish of the transition?


CONNETICUT GUIDE
CHAMBER OPERA
"Tiny Operas," three short chamber operas adapted by Susan O. Bingham from stories by O. Henry, will be presented by the Chancel Opera Company of Connecticut today at 4 and 7:30 P.M. in Christ Church, 84 Broadway, New Haven.


Cultivating Their Own Gardens
On a Sunday morning not long ago, the woman who is probably the nation's most lauded resident of public housing went on a visit that took her two miles across St.
Louis and two decades back in time.
Her destination was a mid-rise cluster of apartment buildings on the city's south side, part of the 1.4 million units of public housing overseen by the Government, to virtually no one's satisfaction.
The woman threw her rental car into park and clicked her red high heels into the building's lobby, where she found an 11-year-old boy casually knocking holes in the plaster.
She seemed to take it personally.
"Why you tearin' that stuff up?" she barked.
The face of the offender leaped with alarm then landed in a look of awe.
"You the one with the President!" he said.


The Salvadorans Make Peace in a 'Negotiated Revolution'
AT the height of President Ronald Reagan's crusade against Communist subversion in Central America, he and his aides liked to say that the United States would never let the guerrillas in El Salvador "shoot their way into power." And in the end that the guerrillas have helped draw to their tiny country's 12-year-old civil war, they have not proved Mr.
Reagan wrong.
But while the settlement they announced with the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani in the first minutes of the new year did not give them actual power, leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front have won at least paper rights to participate in the political process of their country's transformation.
Never, in the memories of diplomats who oversaw the last 25 rounds of negotiations between the two sides, has a such a conflict ended with agreement to such sweeping reform in advance of new elections.
"This is the closest that any process has ever come to a negotiated revolution,"said the United Nations' principal mediator, Alvaro de Soto.


BUSH TO PROPOSE INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR HEALTH COSTS
In his budget request to Congress later this month, President Bush intends to propose tax credits to help people buy health insurance, further cuts in military spending and major new restrictions on the payment of Government benefits to the affluent, Administration officials say.
Mr.
Bush's advisers say the tax credits will be the centerpiece of his election-year strategy to show that he has a substantial domestic policy and to fend off attacks by Democrats who contend he has no plan to aid the 34 million Americans who lack health insurance.


Why Americans Prefer to Hear Words They Don't Understand
Wagner's "Flying Dutchman," which returns to the Metropolitan Opera repertory on Thursday evening, is an opera with a distinguished Met history.
The house premiere, in 1889, was led by Anton Seidl, who was Wagner's own protege.
Theodor Reichmann, who sang the Dutchman, had taken part in the first "Parsifal," at Bayreuth.
Subsequent Met performances -- 126 in all -- featured such famous Wagnerites as Johanna Gadski, Friedrich Schorr, Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter, George London, Astrid Varnay and Leonie Rysanek.
And yet "The Flying Dutchman" has a second performance legacy in the United States -- a truncated legacy that documents achievements that were never pursued, and suggests the costs inflicted by snobbish resistance to opera in English.
That all but one of the Met performances have been given in German, as "Der Fliegende Hollander," may seem unsurprising.
In fact, America's first "Flying Dutchman," in Philadelphia in 1876, was sung in Italian.
And the opera's most elaborate mountings during the Gilded Age, when Wagnerism was at its apex, were those of the touring American Opera Company, which gave everything in English.


Crime
"We've never been as tolerant as we claim," concedes one of the proud characters in PRIDE'S HARVEST (Morrow, $20), another of those big and fascinating mysteries that Jon Cleary sets in his native Australia.
Inspector Scobie Malone of the Sydney homicide division has no illusions about the tolerance of his countrymen; but he is taken aback, nonetheless, by the racial hostility he finds in the outback town of Collamundra, where the aborigines have lower status than the sheep and where someone has tossed the manager of a Japanese-owned cotton mill into his own gin works.
"Australia has never bred any aristocrats," says Mr.
Cleary, who designates them "a rare breed in this flat land of flat social levels." But the point seems lost on the local power elite, a band of conservative families with a political lock on the town.
Shunned himself as a big-city outsider, Scobie has the perspective to view the crime from the proper distance -- back two generations to its twisted roots.


Easing the Glut of Legislative Bills
WITH little more than a week to go before Republicans assume potentially veto-proof control of the State Legislature, lawmakers on opposite sides of the aisle seem to have agreed to disagree on nearly every major issue.
Leaders of both parties, however, have apparently found common ground on at least one vexing problem: the ever-increasing number of bills and resolutions that the Legislature buries itself under each year.


Tearful Dispute
If the Weeping Icon does as members of a dissident Greek Orthodox sect believe, last week might have been a good time for it.
The icon, a small painting of St.
Irene, was reported stolen at gunpoint from a Greek Orthodox cathedral in Queens two days before Christmas and was returned last weekend -- minus its jeweled frame, which the church said was worth $800,000.
But amid the uproar surrounding the icon, which is said to have shed tears as American troops headed for the Persian Gulf, a religious war of words broke out between dissident leaders and leaders of the traditional Greek Orthodox Church.
They suggested that the icon never even got misty, and hinted there was something fishy about the theft.
Bishop Vikentios of Avlon, the spiritual leader of St.
Irene Chrysovalantou Greek Orthodox Cathedral, threatened to sue, saying that the carping about the icon was born of jealousy.
"From the time the icon started to cry, they have been fighting with us," he said.


Ann Luppi Wed At Harvard
Ann Christine Luppi, a graduate student in English at George Mason University, and Peter Anders von Mehren, an associate at the Washington law firm of Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering, were married yesterday in Cambridge, Mass.
The Rev.
Dr.
Thomas J. S. Mikelson, a Unitarian minister, officiated at the Harvard University Memorial Church.

She is a daughter of Hobart Luppi of Hagerstown, Md., and Claudine Luppi of Fairfaix, Va.
Her father is a retired Foreign Service officer.

Home Sweet Home Turns Ugly As the Lakers Lose Another
The Los Angeles Lakers, who responded to the retirement of Magic Johnson with a nine-game winning streak, are facing adversity again.
They lost their fourth consecutive home game Friday night, by 114-87 to the Indiana Pacers, and their 33 percent shooting performance was the 11th consecutive time they have been under 50 percent.


Streetscapes: Turn-of-the-Century Rowhouses; A Tale of Two Streets And Oversize Houses
IT is a sign of the times that the biggest construction story of 1992 may be a tale of de-construction -- the demolition of 12 floors atop the building at 108 East 96th Street.
In 1985, the city gave the developer permission for the 31-story building because it was largely outside a special park improvement district, but it withdrew permission during construction in 1986 after Genie Rice, president of Civitas, a planning organization, correctly noted that the permit was based on an erroneous interpretation of a zoning map.


Second-Guessing Game Doesn't Appeal to Sax
At an annual average income of $3.1 million, Steve Sax earns more than any general manager, but on the particular problem posed to him yesterday, he was reluctant to play general manager for the moment.
The problem: If he were the Yankees' general manager, what would he do about having Steve Sax at second base with Pat Kelly waiting to move there?


Oakland Journal; In Fire's Wake, Nature Leads Rebirth
On the scorched hillsides of Oakland, amid blackened rubble and ash, crocuses poke through the soil with vivid green shoots that seem to say all is not dead here.
The nascent flowers, along with stubborn crabgrass and dandelions, have brightened the gray moonscape left by last October's deadly fires and are harbingers of better days for the 3,000 homeowners who lost everything and are now in the earliest stages of rebuilding.


Schools Trying to Cope With 'Crack Babies'
JANE STEIN, a 29-year veteran of elementary school teaching, is seeing a different breed of pupils in her kindergarten class these days at the Joyce Kilmer School in Trenton.
"Their attention span is much shorter," she said.
"It's very difficult for them to sit still for a long period of time. I guess you'd call it itchiness. They plain can't pay attention."


Reading Teen-Agers Their Rights
THE debate raged among the 30 or so students in C. J. Foy's eighth-grade social studies class at Adam Clayton Powell Jr.
High School in Harlem.
At issue was a hypothetical police roundup of six teen-agers -- five with drug records -- and a search of them without permission.
The police found drugs in the pockets of the five with drug histories.
"The police were undoubtedly wrong?" Ms. Foy asked.


Cultural Impersonators
To the Editor:
A postscript to Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s intriguing essay on "cultural impersonators" (" 'Authenticity,' or the Lesson of Little Tree," Nov. 24).


IN THIS CORNER
Gov.
Lowell Weicker of Connecticut may be correct in his observation that the public prefers eating Doritos to voting ("In This Corner" by Michael Specter, Dec. 15).
However, he seems ignorant of the extent to which politicians like him help to perpetuate the preference.
Connecticut's Dorito bandido says that he "never made any damn pledge" to voters not to establish a personal income tax to solve the state's fiscal woes.
Pledge or not, his carefully worded comments and calculated omissions with regard to the tax were decisive in his victory over Bruce A. Morrison and John Rowland in the 1990 gubernatorial campaign.
Once again, voters have ended up with an elected official who does not resemble the candidate they thought they were voting for.


George H. Wiedeman; Psychiatrist Was 79
George H. Wiedeman, a psychiatrist and educator, died Dec. 27 at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan.
He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
He died of a heart attack, his family said.


Shifting Loyalty on the Job
To the Editor:
"Restoring Loyalty to the Workplace" (Forum, Dec. 15) overlooks a powerful new force shaping employee commitment.
Employees are demanding democratic processes in matters important to their personal well-being.
They no longer are willing to entrust their destiny to some distant, hopefully benevolent, leadership.


Stabilize the Banks and Reverse the Recession; Buy American
To the Editor:
Re "The Economy: Go Fast, and Slow" (editorial, Dec. 19): We look to the Federal Government as the sole force capable of reversing our deepening economic morass.
It is the sole organized force, but consumers can turn the economy around by simply buying American-made products.


Tacos, Salsas and More for the Family
SU CASA, a Mexican restaurant near Exit 55 of Interstate 95 in Branford, has had an 18-year run.
Efficient and welcoming service, cozy dining areas decorated with Mexican artworks, and decently cooked, predictable food, all explain why.
The menu isn't extensive but it touches all the familiar Tex-Mex bases.
For a newcomer to Mexican food there is a concise, helpful description beneath each listing, sometimes with a comment.
Macho Nachos are described, for example, as "tortilla chips topped with lots of sauce, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions and melted cheese. Not for men only."


Terry Is Re-signed
Right-handed relief pitcher SCOTT TERRY, who set the table for most of LEE SMITH's record 47 saves for St.
Louis last summer, signed a one-year contract with the Cardinals.
Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. (AP)


Corrections
An article yesterday about the University of Bridgeport's efforts to remain open referred incorrectly to the status of negotiations between the university and a group of banks over the conditions of a $2.2 million loan.
The university presented a plan to the banks to cut salaries and to raise $500,000 to supplement the loan.
A final agreement has not been reached.


Welcome: Foreign Businesses, and Jobs
AS the economy sags, a new psychological syndrome -- resentment of foreign companies -- has emerged.
On the other hand, foreign companies are welcomed because they provide jobs.
There is no evidence in Westchester of hostility toward foreign companies, said Gregory A. Russo, chairman of the board of directors of the County Chamber of Commerce in White Plains.
Moreover, Mr.
Russo said, eight foreign-owned companies that have made Westchester their home base in the United States were saluted last month at the county chamber's annual meeting.

Turning Pickup Trucks And Broken Hearts Into Pure Platinum
The Sunset Grill is one of the trendiest restaurants in Nashville -- in fact, it's one of the only trendy restaurants in Nashville.
With its pale blue walls, sprigs of fresh flowers in slim white vases and pasta dishes that go for less than $10, the Grill is actually a pretty down-home affair compared to restaurants in New York or Los Angeles; but then trendiness was never much of a commodity in Nashville.
On a recent evening, Tony Brown, a senior vice president at MCA's Nashville division, sits at the corner table in the Sunset Grill's bar area.
Arguably the most important record company executive in the country music industry, Mr.
Brown, like the restaurant, lacks a high-powered air: he wears a white shirt, dark vest, black jeans and cowboy boots, and has a neatly trimmed beard.
"I was watching MTV recently, and they were going through the top five records," he says.
"The veejay says, 'No. 5 is Metallica. No. 4 is Guns 'n' Roses. No. 3 is some rap act. No. 2 is some other rap act. And No. 1 is' " -- Mr.
Brown imitates the veejay's exaggerated Southern accent -- " 'Yee-haw! Garth Brooks!' "


Coffee in Japan
To the Editor: I am a big fan of Amanda Mayer Stinchecum; her travel writing on Japan is consistently knowledgeable and perceptive.
I was amazed, however, by her statement ("Japan's Other Ritual: The Coffee Ceremony," Nov. 17) that "Japan is one place where you can feel confident of finding a good cup of coffee -- freshly brewed, strong and fragrant -- in almost any town or village big enough to have a single coffee shop."
As a law professor with an interest in Japanese law, I have traveled four times to Japan, once for a full year.
I have found that the search for a decent cup of coffee in Japan is only slightly less exhausting than the search for the Holy Grail.
A common technique among Japanese coffee enthusiasts is to select coffee beans with great care, roast them painstakingly in the shop, brew the coffee fastidiously, and then boil it beyond recognition.
I have not, though, visited any of the shops highlighted in Ms.
Stinchecum's article; perhaps there is hope yet.
JONATHAN WEINBERG Ann Arbor, Mich.
Amanda Mayer Stinchecum responds:
Professor Weinberg's unfortunate experiences do not coincide with mine.
One clue to finding good coffee is to look for shops that call themselves "coffee specialty shops" or for coffee shops that serve a number of different types of beans and blends; many shops that sell beans also serve a carefully brewed cup of coffee.


Yugoslavia Truce Is Largely Holding
Despite reports of local clashes, a United Nations-brokered cease-fire in contested areas of Croatia appeared to gain momentum today.
No clashes were reported in Dubrovnik, Osijek or Vinkovci or in central Croatia -- areas of almost daily fighting since late in June, when Croatia and another Yugoslav republic, Slovenia, declared independence.


OPENING THE DOOR
I want to thank Robert M. Grossman (About Men: "Opening the Door," Dec. 8) for making a believer of one old cynic.
There is still hope -- hope for the human race -- if only one person behaves as he does.

Her father is president of Sogo Technology, an engineering consulting and real-estate development concern in Metuchen.


A Family Circle Campaign With Unexpected Images
TO encourage marketers to buy advertising pages, the Seven Sisters women's service magazines have portrayed their readers as celebrities or jugglers.
But until now, readers were never presented bare-chested, with tattoos and spiked hair.
Beginning this week, those unconventional images will be the focus of a tongue-in-cheek trade advertising campaign for Family Circle created by Kirshenbaum &amp; Bond, a brash agency known for unorthodox work for clients like No Excuses jeans and Kenneth Cole shoes.


S. M. Plotnick, 76; Taught at and Ran Westchester School
S.
Maurice Plotnick, an educator who headed the Westchester Day School in Mamaroneck, N.Y., died Dec. 28 at White Plains Hospital.
He was 76 years old.
Mr. Plotnick died of prostate cancer, his family said.


New Interest in Missing Servicemen May Imperil Move Toward Hanoi Ties
Expectations that the United States and Vietnam would soon establish diplomatic relations, more than 15 years after the end of the Indochina War, may be set back by a resurgence of interest in one piece of unfinished business that will not go away: the fate of missing Americans.
The revival of the issue has been spurred by a series of statements over the last six months -- from apparently bogus reports of sightings of live Americans to unsubstantiated information that Soviet officials interrogated Americans in Indochina after the time Vietnam said it had freed them.


Review/Television; Treating Education Ills As Courtroom Drama
Format gets in the way of content on "Learning in America: Education on Trial," the three-part series that begins tonight at 10 on Channels 13 and 49.
Each hour is set in a courtroom and features real lawyers and a real judge.
Viewers are to serve as jurors, via a toll-free number, and their verdict will be revealed in the next morning's USA Today.
In tonight's program, "Do We Need a National Report Card?," the witnesses -- Dr.
Saul Cooperman, who used to be the New Jersey Education Commissioner; Gov.
Roy Romer of Colorado; David Smith, a teacher in an East Harlem secondary school, and Ann Lynch, a former president of the National Parent Teacher Association -- are examined and cross-examined in what turns out to be a fitfully informative hour.


Plans for Repairing 6 Battered Industries
From autos and real estate to retailing and banking, some leading American industries were battered last year.
Now top managers are seeking to repair the damage.
To be sure, some areas of the economy, like financial services and the pharmaceutical industry, fared well.
But many businesses must deal with a continued crisis in consumer confidence, while contending with too much capacity and corporate management styles more suited to the complacent marketplace of the past than to today's competitive maelstrom.


Market Place; At Dollar General, What Recession?
The recession has not brought hard times to all retailers.
The Dollar General Corporation, which sells inexpensive necessities like toothpaste, bleach and paper towels to low-income consumers, is growing at a pace that is the envy of merchants with more affluent customers.
Last week, it reported "the best Christmas selling season in the history of the company," said Cal Turner Jr., the chairman and grandson of the Tennessee tobacco farmer who founded the company 52 years ago.
Sales at stores open more than a year are up 10 percent through December.
Last month, sales roared ahead 25.2 percent.


The Quandary in Japan; Bush Will Be Given Concessions on Trade, But Not the Broad Changes the U.S. Wants
For weeks, Japanese newspapers have been filled with reports of trade concessions Japan will offer President Bush on his visit this week, most of them aimed at increasing Japanese imports of American autos.
But for all the expected promises, the measures are likely to create a troubling quandary for American officials: many of the steps have nothing to do with opening the Japanese market or freeing trade, the professed aim of the President's trade policies.
Instead, they add up to Government orders simply to buy more American products to head off worsening trade tensions.


J. M. Hess Wed To Beth Posner
Beth Sheba Posner, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Herbert T. Posner of East Windsor, N.J., was married yesterday to Jonathan Morris Hess, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Robert L. Hess of Brooklyn.
The bride's uncle, Rabbi David M. Posner, officiated at Temple Emanu-El in New York.
Ms.
Posner, 24 years old, is keeping her name.
She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and is pursuing a doctorate in comparative literature and literary theory from the University of Pennsylvania, as is the bridegroom.
Her father is a partner in the law firm of Weltz &amp; Posner in New York.
Her mother, Jacklyn H. Posner, is a vice president at Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. in New York.


Seattle Journal; City Fights to Keep Its Losing Team
For the first time in its inglorious history, the Seattle Mariners baseball team has a problem that has nothing to do with its performance on the field.
The club posted its first winning record last year after fielding an unmatched series of losers for 14 years in a row.
In the process, it shattered all home attendance records, attracting more than two million fans -- close to what the pennant-winning Atlanta Braves drew.


Topics of The Times; Frank Politicking
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the House Ways and Means chairman, is already off and running for re-election in an Illinois district dramatically altered by reapportionment.
Last month, he sent his would-be constituents a "Dear Friend" letter discussing his sponsorship of tax fairness and health care reform.
What's troubling is that under present rules, taxpayers pay for this electioneering.
Mr.
Rostenkowski used his free mailing privilege, known as franking, to flood the redrawn district with news about Congress and, of course, favorable news about himself.
His challenger in the Democratic primary, Dick Simpson, has good reason to complain about abuse of the frank.
But Mr.
Rostenkowski was only taking full advantage of current rules allowing members to send taxpayer-financed mail into their new district once a redistricting plan is final.


Review/Opera; From Shanghai, a Tale Of Love and a Dream
When the Beijing Opera appeared at the Metropolitan Opera House more than a decade ago, uninitiated Westerners were struck by the teeming theatricality of the productions.
Stately stylized gesture often gave way to bolder modes of expression, including outright acrobatics.
With continued exposure to the varieties of Chinese opera, thanks mainly to annual Viva Chinatown celebrations of the Chinese-American Arts Council, New Yorkers have come to see more of the intimate and subtle side of this ancient artistic tradition.
"The Dream," presented by the Hua Wenyi Kun Opera Troupe of Shanghai on Friday evening in the Viva Chinatown program at Alice Tully Hall, stood at the furthest remove from the grandiose Beijing productions.
This exquisite miniature, little more than a half-hour long, featured a four-member cast and a four-member orchestra, with only a dressing table and chair as props, though the costumes were typically ornate and gorgeous.


Guns 'N Skis, Enter the N.R.A.
The National Rifle Association would seem to be a perfect sponsor for the financially strapped United States Olympic biathlon team.
After all, the sport requires rifle-shooting ability in addition to skill at cross-country skiing.
"But the people who are in biathlon, and follow it, are not N.R.A. types," said HOWARD BUXTON, the president of the United States Biathlon Association.
"In fact, they're probably opposed to many of the N.R.A. ideas."


Review/Television; A Bright if Problematic Future Fouled by Tragedy
On June 12, 1985, Edmund Perry, a 17-year-old black student, was killed in Harlem by a white plainclothes police officer.
New York City confronted still another tragedy with racial undertones.
What made this one different was that Mr.
Perry was no ordinary student.
He had just graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy, one of the nation's most prestigious prep schools, and was planning to attend Stanford University on a full scholarship after working for the summer on Wall Street.
Striking a national nerve, the incident could not be swept quickly out of sight.
The case was subsequently recounted in "Best Intentions," a book by Robert Sam Anson, which has now been adapted by Richard Wesley for a television movie -- tonight at 9 on NBC -- with the lumbering title of "Murder Without Motive: The Edmund Perry Story." Directed by Kevin Hooks with a cool authority that is all the more unnerving for its matter-of-fact tone, the film explores issues of race and class, ambition and opportunity.
There are no comforting bromides.


Longer Year Is Advocated For Schools
Education Commissioner John Ellis is laying plans to add a month or more to the school year in New Jersey, a change that would sharply increase the costs of the nation's most expensive school system.
"We have to make a commitment to extend the school year and that will drive up the costs," Mr.
Ellis said in an interview in which he reflected on an 18-month tenure that he described as "turbulent" and that has been marked by continuing rumors of an imminent resignation -- rumors that both he and Gov.
Jim Florio, who appointed him, have denied.


Dance in Review
Beverly Blossom and Douglas Nielsen
Bessie Schonberg Theater
It is hard to imagine a more inspired pairing of kindred souls than the matching of Beverly Blossom and Douglas Nielsen on a program on Friday night.
They are opposites in looks and styles.
Ms.
Blossom is small, dowdily dressed in shapeless black and shifts position in small increments of steps, looking sometimes as if she is being blown by a fierce wind.
She is an extraordinarily acute performer, whose theater-dance solos are at once profoundly comic and tragic.
Mr.
Nielsen is a tall sprucely turned-out performer who moves in big gulping steps and flummoxing tumbles.
His work, less seasoned than that of Ms.
Blossom, is more pure physical comedy.
What unites the two is an irresistible look of madness.


If It's Monday, N.F.L. Coaches Must Be Interviewing for Jobs
The Green Bay Packers, who were unable to lure Bill Parcells from the television studio to the sidelines, are still looking for a coach after dismissing Lindy Infante two weeks ago.
Mike Holmgren, San Francisco's offensive coordinator, has interviewed for the job and is considered a top candidates, along with Chuck Knox, the former Seattle coach.


Sampson Opts Out of N.B.A.
Ralph Sampson said Saturday night that he would immediately leave the Washington Bullets of the National Basketball Association and join a professional team in Spain.
The 7-foot-4-inch Sampson, who joined the Bullets on Nov. 19 after getting a buyout from his lengthy contract with the Sacramento Kings, appeared in only 10 games with Washington and was used sparingly.
He did not play in any of the Bullets' last six games and announced his decision to leave the team after spending the entire game on the bench in Washington's 113-99 loss to the Knicks.
The 31-year-old center will go on waivers on Tuesday, although he said his days with the Bullets are over.
"I love the N.B.A., so if anyone wants me they can feel free to give me a call," Sampson said.
Sampson said he was unsure of the name of the team he would join in Spain.


Soviet Emigre Fatally Shot Defending Wife in Attack
A Soviet Jewish emigre coming home from a birthday party was shot and killed early yesterday on a Brooklyn street corner as he rushed to defend his wife, who had been punched by one of three muggers, the police said.
By chance, the man's 19-year-old son was a block away, driving a young man and a teen-age girl home, and saw the tragedy unfolding, said the girl in the car.
The son smashed his car into the robbers', forcing them to flee on foot, said Sgt.
Steven Sheehan of the Brooklyn South Homicide Squad.


BATTERED INDUSTRIES Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors; Travel: Empty Seats, Empty Beds, Empty Pockets
For a student, a grade of 65 percent is nothing to write home about.
But for the airline and hotel industries, filling 65 percent of the seats or rooms is the difference between profit and loss.
For these hard-pressed industries, simply breaking even this year would seem like a moral victory.
Beset by recession and the fallout from the Persian Gulf war, airlines on average filled 63 percent of their seats in the first 10 months of 1991, according to the Air Transport Association.
Hotels fared no better, with occupancy averaging 62.3 percent through November of 1991, according to Smith Travel Research.
Although both are fairly close to break-even rates, analysts say the industries will continue to lose money unless the economy improves -- a big if.


On the Beach On Super Sunday
The last -- and only -- time a Super Bowl was held in the North, visitors to the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., complained about the weather outside.
That was in 1981.
Some fans, remembering how they slogged through the snow to get there (a massive traffic jam ensued when Vice President GEORGE BUSH decided at the last minute to attend), have decided to head south when the Super Bowl is held Jan. 26 in untropical Minneapolis.
But fans in Cancun, the resort island in Gulf of Mexico, will be able to have their beach and football, too.


In Japan's View, U.S. Car Companies Should Be Blaming Only Themselves
When President Bush and the chairmen of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler arrive Tuesday to cite the dismal sales of American cars here as a symbol of what is wrong with Japan, they may meet a rude surprise: Tokyo is preparing to cite the same example to make its case about the shortsightedness of American business.
For years, the Big Three auto makers have been the most conspicuous case of what happens to companies that try to sell in Japan exactly the same products they sell in America, with few concessions to Japanese tastes, Japanese habits, or even the width of Japanese roads.


Once Again, Bad News Nets
Just as the Nets began to generate some momentum, they stumbled at home Friday night against the Washington Bullets and collapsed on the road Saturday night in Chicago against the Bulls.
A winning streak of four games suddenly seemed like ancient history and the coming week, because of one misstep by Derrick Coleman, became more of a daunting future.
Coleman turned his troublesome left ankle late in the first quarter of a 140-96 pounding by the Bulls at Chicago Stadium.
After taking a shot, he landed on Stacey King's foot and hobbled off to the locker room to have the ankle iced.
Results of X-rays taken late yesterday afternoon upon Coleman's return to New Jersey were pending, but Coleman's status for tonight's game against the Los Angeles Clippers at Byrne Meadowlands Arena is at best questionable.


Democrats Call Bush's Health Proposal Inadequate
Two Democratic candidates for President today criticized health-care proposals being developed by the Bush Administration, saying they would not do enough to control health costs or to protect the millions of Americans who lack health insurance.
One of the Democrats, Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, asserted that the Administration did not have "the guts to go after the wasteful health-insurance system we've got, the wasteful health-care system we've got."


CHRONICLE
WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY will read aloud from one of his novels at a small gathering tomorrow evening in the home of MARION JAVITS to benefit the reading program of PEN, the organization of writers and editors.
The purpose of the program, said TAMARA MOSKOWITZ, PEN's director of development, is to send authors into libraries, schools and community centers to encourage people to read more adventurously.
Mr.
Buckley viewed the prospect of reading a biographical section of one of his nine novels -- he refused to say which one -- as something of an adventure in itself.


Spa Owner to Pay Blacks Over Hiring Bias
The owner of Holiday Spa health clubs in five Eastern cities is creating a $1.4 million program to compensate blacks rejected for jobs because of their race, the company and the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have announced.
The agreement between the commission and United States Health Inc. of Towson, Md., announced on Thursday, followed a year of investigation and about another year of negotiations, Frank Fritts, a supervisor in the commission's systemic investigations division, said.
The chain is owned by the Bally Manufacturing Corporation of Chicago.


World Economies


Out of Sight, Fire Burns Hidden World in Kansas
No one has been able to get close enough to even see it yet, but for more than a week now a stubborn fire has burned deep within one of the converted limestone mines near here that make up a subterranean world right out of a Batman movie.
It is a world of paved and lighted roads, a college library, a computer center and train tracks.
It serves as the venue for black-tie dinner dances and a 10-kilometer race.
And with its even temperature and low humidity, it offers almost perfect storage conditions for hundreds of acres of canned food, toys, stamps and other goods.


Question Box
Yount Nears Milestone
Q.
How close is Robin Yount to reaching 3,000 hits in his major league career?
A.
Closer than any other active player, and close enough to count on baseball issuing a "Robin Yount Countdown" shortly before the outfielder's 37th birthday next Sept. 16.
The Milwaukee Brewers' star will enter the 1992 season with 2,878 hits for his 18-year career, which means he needs just 122 to join a group of 16 players that embraced Rod Carew as its most recent member in 1985.


Yugoslav Cease-Fire Holds
Except for minor shooting incidents, Croatian and Yugoslav Army forces were reported today to be respecting the cease-fire in all the embattled Croatian regions, improving chances that the United Nations Security Council will send a peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia.
Federal army and Croatian officials reported that Saturday night was the most peaceful in months along the 350-mile battlefront, and no serious violations were noted today.


Getting Out of the Nuclear Arms Business
To the Editor:
It is extraordinary to me that the production of nuclear weapons by the United States and by other countries are always discussed separately, as if they had nothing to do with each other.
United States policy is as simple as it is contradictory: we do not want anyone else to produce nuclear weapons, but we want to continue even after the cold war is over.


BATTERED INDUSTRIES Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors; Retailing: Sick Merchants, Capitalist 'Cure'
How bad is it in the world of retailing?
One merchant, Child World, recently sent out a press release boasting that it actually made a payment on time to suppliers.
The "second in two weeks," the company noted.
Despite Child World's notice that it is still breathing, the dismal holiday shopping season is expected to be a prelude to a round of retailing bankruptcies.

BATTERED INDUSTRIES Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors; Real Estate: The Developers Are Still Sifting Market's Rubble
Few industries in recent years have collapsed as completely and rapidly as commerical real estate.
Property values are down across the board, vacancies are at all-time highs and with the national economy caught in the grips of recession, the prospect that the demand for space will grow much this year is only a pipe dream.
The commercial real estate industry is trapped in a depression marked by a virtual absence of lenders willing to take any risk.
Even the usually optimistic developers and property market analysts are now admitting that things are likely to worsen over the next 18 months, especially for the staggeringly overbuilt office market.


U.N. CHIEF TO SEEK TEAM OF MONITORS TO AID YUGOSLAVIA
In an effort to encourage Yugoslavia's warring factions to respect their fragile cease-fire, the new United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Ghali, will ask the Security Council on Monday to send about 50 military observers there as quickly as possible.
But Mr.
Ghali will not ask the Council to send a proposed 10,000-member peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia until he has clearer evidence that the truce that went into effect Friday continues in force and until the civilian leaders of Serbian-occupied regions of Croatia agree to cooperate with a peacekeeping operation, diplomats and other officials say.
Approval Is Expected
The officials say the proposal, which the Security Council is expected to approve early this week, is intended to press all sides in the Yugoslav conflict to exercise restraint.


Battle on Jerusalem's Future Has Roots 3,000 Years in Past
Avi Maoz says he has a dream.
Fatmeh Ahmad Karain asks why his vision should come at her expense.
Their differences form the core of a nasty court fight that is being waged over conflicting property claims in a part of East Jerusalem called Silwan, which spreads across hills lying just below the imposing walls of the Old City.


Chemical Banking Realigns Agencies
The new Chemical Banking Corporation, formed last week by the merger of Chemical and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, has completed a realignment of its advertising accounts, said Charles Salmans, senior vice president of corporate advertising.
As was expected, the retail-bank account has been consolidated at McCann-Erickson New York, which previously handled Manufacturers Hanover's consumer advertising.
A new campaign is expected in June.


Man Dies in Attempt To Rob a Merchant
A 71-year-old jewelry store owner in Chinatown shot and killed a 40-year-old man who tried to rob him yesterday morning, the police said.
The dead man, tentatively identified as Robert Collado of 289 21st Street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, was shot three times in the torso about 11:13 A.M. by the store owner, Herman Muser, at the Canal Material House, at 94 Canal Street, the police said.


Jesse C. Goodwin, 76, A Packaging Executive
Jesse C. Goodwin, co-founder of Mother's Food Products, which packaged kosher foods, died on Dec. 30 at St.
Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J.
He was 76 years old and lived in Verona, N.J.
He died of heart failure caused by a variety of pulmonary conditions, his son Richard said.


Those Great Shirts Are Going Global
MIKE CONNOR, the newest commissioner in sports, is not about to capture a lucrative television contract.
But maybe he can interest Japanese and Europeans in some nifty bowling shirts?
Connor has just started his duties as the head of the Professional Bowlers Association, a post that had been JOSEPH ANTENORA's since 1970.
Connor, like his counterparts in other sports, is looking toward globalization and marketing as a way to increase flattening income.


UMass Fine-Tunes a Prime-Time Upset
Last February, Coach John Calipari of the University of Massachusetts scheduled a game at midnight to get a national television date from ESPN.
It was one way to get his up-and-coming Minutemen some exposure.
This season, thinking the same way, he went even further out on a limb, scheduling Oklahoma for a Jan. 4 game at Springfield, Mass.
"We have to fight like heck to get on TV," Calipari said, explaining that to sign Oklahoma, he had to agree to play in Norman, Okla., two years from now.


Season on the Links: More Prosperity Is Just Around the Next Dogleg
After a season that gave us the most dramatic Ryder Cup ever played and the thrilling power of John Daly, 1992 will have to go some way to keep from being regarded as an anticlimactic year in golf.
Of course, the same could have been said last January about 1991, the year that followed the social upheaval of Shoal Creek.
In fact, 1992 promises a great deal, including Daly's first encounter with the wide fairways and short par 5's of Augusta National, Phil Mickelson's professional debut, and the classic venues of Pebble Beach and Muirfield, where the United States and British Opens will be played.


Cecile Naumburg, 94, Philanthropist, Is Dead
Cecile L. Naumburg, a philanthropist and former board member of Carnegie Hall and other cultural organizations, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital.
Mrs.
Naumburg was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.
Her death was caused by respiratory failure, her family said.


Sports of The Times; Detroit Fans Cheer for the Quarterback Without the Union Label
THE last guy anyone in Detroit would have considered a football hero became an unabashed, unmitigated, unquestioned hero yesterday.
In this town that wears the union label so proudly, he was considered a strikebreaker.
In this town that has boasted such quarterback stars as Bobby Layne and Earl Morrall and Tobin Rote, the guy who came to camp this summer as the team's No. 3 quarterback, who has played in things like the Potato Bowl while attending a community college, who wasn't even drafted by the National Football League after his senior year in college, this guy is today's hero here.
And in this grizzled, battered town, this blue-collar, lunch-bucket town, the guy with the dark, tousled hair and the gentle eyes and the unprepossessing build of, say, a high school chemistry whiz, this guy was cheered wildly by the 78,290 football fans in the Silverdome.


3 Are Attacked By Large Gang In Manhattan
A gang of about 50 to 60 teen-agers swarmed around three young men walking in lower Manhattan yesterday evening, stealing their jackets and slashing one of them who resisted, the police said.
Twenty-three teen-agers -- 8 of them juveniles and 15 of them 16 to 19 years old -- were arrested a few minutes after the group attacked the three young men about 5:30 P.M. at Trinity Place and Rector Street, near Trinity Church, a police spokesman, Sgt.
Edward J. Burns, said.


Dance in Review
New York City Ballet
New York State Theater
The dancers of the New York City Ballet looked surprisingly fresh and committed in "The Nutcracker" on Saturday night, given the fact that they had been performing the ballet for over a month.
Perhaps it was because the end was near, in a last weekend of "Nutcracker" performances for the year.


Votes Are Said to Favor An Independent Revco
A plan proposed by some creditors of Revco D.S.
Inc. to maintain the drugstore chain as an independent entity won the widest support in a vote by creditors that concluded Friday, according to preliminary results announced by Revco.
The plan competed against two other proposals, both of which would have merged the company with other drugstore companies.
One merger plan called for Revco's acquisition by the Jack Eckerd Corporation; the other proposed a merger with the Rite Aid Corporation.


Topics of The Times; Naivete's Not the Problem
Older Americans are being bilked of their life savings, as documented in a recent report in The Times.
The victims, most of them widows, tell, for example, of trusting "a nice young man" who ingratiated himself and then disappeared with most of their bank account.
Even sadder were the tales of family thievery.
Driven by drugs and the recession, children in soaring numbers prey on elderly parents.
The solution seems obvious: Wise up the gullible old folks.
But older adults are no more naive than younger ones.
What they lack is not savvy but support, the friendship and confidence they need to sound the alarm.
One bilked widow in Asbury Park, N.J., told authorities that she was so lonely "she'd pay the devil to visit her."


Behind the Iron Hand at Tenneco
In his first months at Tenneco, Michael H. Walsh has practically run a seminar on how to act swiftly to alter the course of an industrial giant in distress.
Even so, it will take a few years before anyone can applaud Mr.
Walsh for administering at Tenneco Inc. his successful industrial shock therapy, which he most recently demonstrated at the Union Pacific Railroad.


Your Personal High-Tech Coach
If you were a ski-jumper trying to get an extra few feet of lift, you could be tested and videotaped by the United States Olympic Committee.
Olympians have access to the latest psychological and physiological testing by a battery of experts.
But what if you're a weekend tennis player and your serve fails you on match point?


Breaking Welfare Dependency for Young Mothers
WHEN Padora Vincent gave birth as a teen-ager three years ago, she personified a growing national problem.
Today, she may exemplify one possible solution.
The Census Bureau reported last month that more and more new mothers, teen-agers in particular, are unwed.
Among blacks, 9 of 10 teen-agers who had babies in 1990 were unmarried -- the highest rate of any major ethnic or racial group.
Regardless of whether the social stigma of premarital pregnancy has declined, teen-age motherhood typically bodes badly for the children.
Many grow up poor.
Some get another chance later in life.
Their mothers often don't.


QUOTATION OF THE DAY
"I lived for many years cherishing the revolution. I loved it and worked for it and sacrificed for it, but the Cuban people have no rights anymore, and nothing to eat or enjoy as diversions. Before too long, Cuba is going to be thrown back to the conditions it was in when Christopher Columbus discovered America." -- MARIA DE LA CARIDAD CARRAZANA, who fled to Florida by helicopter last week.  [ B8:1 ]


Athletes and Textbooks: A New Chapter Awaits
The most far-reaching new academic requirements for college athletes in almost 10 years will go before a vote of National Collegiate Athletic Association schools this week.
Opponents are bracing for what is likely to be a futile fight.
"I told the Presidents Commission to expect even more heated debate at the 1992 convention than what they experienced in 1990 or '91," the N.C.A.A.'s executive director, Richard Schultz, said.


Miss Rothberg Weds
Debra Joan Rothberg, a daughter of Mrs.
Ira D. Rothberg of Westbury, L.I., and the late Prof.
Rothberg, was married yesterday to Barry Steven Grodenchik, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Nathan Grodenchik of Flushing, Queens.
Rabbi Robert Benjamin officiated at Temple Emanuel in New Hyde Park, L.I.
Mrs.
Grodenchik, 29 years old, is an assistant professor of developmental mathematics at Nassau Community College.
She graduated from Pace University and received a master's degree in mathematics from Adelphi University.
Mr.
Grodenchik, 31, is the chief administrative officer of the Office of the Queens Borough President.
He is a graduate of the State University of New York at Binghamton.


Corrections
A picture caption on Saturday about two fatal shootings in Bridgeport, Conn., described the incident incorrectly in some copies.
The police initially thought the two men had shot each other; investigators later said that both had been killed in a robbery.


Real Estate Firm to Name President
At a time when many real estate developers are cutting back, the Edward S. Gordon Company, a leading New York brokerage and real estate services company, is aggressively expanding its operations.
The company is expected to announce this week the appointment of Stephen B. Siegel, a former chairman of Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc., as its new president.
The appointment is likely to be seen as a coup for Edward Gordon, who will remain chairman of the firm he founded in 1972.
Mr.
Siegel, who rose to become president, chief executive and chairman of Cushman &amp;


As Fighting in Somalia Rages On, African Neighbor Seeks a Truce
In an unusual regional diplomatic initiative for Africa, the Eritreans are attempting to bring an end to the fighting in Somalia.
And some Western officials believe the move may have a better chance for success than more publicized international efforts.
Traditionally, African governments have been unwilling to try to solve civil wars in neighboring countries on the ground that such efforts constitute undue intervention.


At the Fish Library, a Chronicle of Death and Taxes
When Alice Curtis Desmond died in 1990 leaving an $18 million estate and no heirs, the trustees of the library she founded and liberally supported in the decade before her death anticipated a settled future.
So did her lawyer and her nurse.
But when the will was read, the trustees and many of the 6,500 residents in this bucolic Hudson River estate town were dismayed to learn that the millions the 93-year-old banking heiress had left to the library would be all but eaten up in paying taxes on the $2 million apiece she left to the nurse and lawyer.


Brooklyn Pizzeria Dispute Leads To Violence and Fatal Shooting
A dispute in a Brooklyn pizzeria turned deadly Saturday night when three assailants attacked a pizza maker, blinded him by throwing flour in his face, then shot him in the head as he wobbled backward into the shop's kitchen, the police said.
During the attack, the worker, Redzep Ulaj, 30 years old, defended himself by swinging a wooden pizza paddle at one of the men, who came into the shop, Original Pizza at 2351 Ralph Avenue in Mill Basin, at 11:30 P.M., the police said.


Escape From Cuba: An Affair For Family and Friends, Too
Ten days ago, at a ceremony in Havana, German Pompa Gonzalez was awarded a medal for "exemplary service" to the Cuban Revolution for his performance as a helicopter pilot.
This morning, he sat in the living room of his sister-in-law's modest house in a Miami suburb, a wanted man back in his homeland but a hero to thousands of Cuban exiles here.
Mr.
Pompa's journey to freedom began on Friday at dawn, when he awoke, dressed quietly in the uniform of Cuba's national airline so as not to wake fellow crew members still asleep in a staff dormitory and boarded the Russian-made MI-8 helicopter in which he normally ferried tourists around Cuba.


Mary Blair, 75, Dies; Prominent in Society
Mary Josephine Blair, a prominent figure in New York society for many years, died on Dec. 29 at her home in Hobe Sound, Fla.
She was 75 years old.
She died of cancer, said her daughter, Mary McFadden, the fashion designer.


Muhammad Kenyatta, 47, Dies; Professor and Civil Rights Leader
Muhammad I. Kenyatta, a legal scholar and civil rights crusader who sued the Federal Government in 1969 for harassing him under an F.B.I. counterintelligence program, died in Buffalo on Friday.
He was 47 years old.
Mr.
Kenyatta, a visiting professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law since 1988, had long been in ill health, said university officials, who added that the professor had suffered complications from diabetes and was hospitalized at the time of his death.


Rules Forcing Towns to Pick Big New Dumps or Big Costs
New Federal and state rules are forcing the closing of hundreds of old community garbage dumps and prompting the development of many fewer, but much larger landfills that only the biggest cities and the largest garbage companies can afford to build and operate.
And residents of thousands of small communities, like this one south of Montgomery, will be forced to choose the revenue and heavy truck traffic of a new nearby landfill or the huge increase in costs of transporting their garbage far away.
What is definite, though, is that the new regulations are proving to be a bonanza to the nation's largest garbage companies.


Taiwan Voted forStatus Quo, not One China; A Stinging Defeat
To the Editor:
Contrary to your Dec. 24 editorial on the Dec. 21 Taiwan election, the ruling Kuomintang Party "victory" was not "a vote for one China." How could it be?
The Kuomintang-dominated Government banned the opposition party's platform of an independent "Republic of Taiwan" even from election posters.
The Government arrested a score of pro-independence leaders on election eve.


BATTERED INDUSTRIES Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors; Insurance: Calming Policyholders and Satisfying Shareholders
Barring some extraordinary event, like another run by policyholders, most analysts and industry executives do not expect a giant insurance company to fail this year.
But neither do they expect much improvement in returns to shareholders, which have contracted considerably in the face of sharp competition.
"The central problem in this industry remains the same: how to earn effective profits," said Larry A. Brossman, the head of insurance rating at Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
"Companies that used to earn 12 to 15 percent on their equity now earn less than 10 percent."

Cable's Big Ally on Capitol Hill: Hollywood
Having struck out twice in the last two years, Congress will begin a third effort later this month to pass legislation that would allow most cities to regulate prices for basic cable television services.
Similar cable bills have foundered largely because of opposition from the cable industry's formidable lobbying group and from Republicans who oppose rate regulation.
But this time, despite broad support among lawmakers who see the measure as an ideal consumer issue, it is in danger of being derailed by opposition from a new quarter: Hollywood movie studios and their renowned lobbyist, Jack Valenti.


No Time to Read? Well, Just Listen
It is the next century.
New Age Person walks up to a latter-day newsstand, asks for her favorite magazine and is handed a tape.
She pops it into her Walkman, adjusts her earphones and settles in for a good new-fashioned browse.
Well, maybe.
But that day is hardly around the corner.
In fact, the magazine industry is just beginning to look into the possibilities of audio cassettes as marketable spinoffs of existing magazines.


New Zealand's Latest Yacht Makes Fine First Impression
New Zealand's newest America's Cup yacht looks as if it could be a front-runner this winter in challengers' efforts to win the America's Cup, based on first impressions.
New Zealand's boat, the team's fourth and final yacht to be built for the 1992 cup trials, beat seven other America's Cup contenders here Saturday in an informal fleet race in the ocean off Point Loma.
The official challengers' trials, which begin Jan. 25, are match races.

CHRONICLE
For THOMAS P. WALSH, becoming director of public safety for the newly organized Times Square Business Improvement District, is a homecoming of sorts.
A former New York City police officer who rose to become the department's highest-ranking officer for the southern half of Manhattan, he began his career 35 years ago on foot patrol on West 44th Street.
Now he is back in the neighborhood, in charge of recruiting, training and supervising 40 public safety officers for the district, which went into operation last week.
"My first post was in 1957 on 44th Street between Broadway and Ninth Avenue," said Mr.
Walsh, who retired in October as patrol borough commander for Manhattan South.
" 'Little Abner' was playing then, so was Ethel Merman in 'Happy Hunting.' The biggest problems had to do with sex and prostitution and that has improved immeasurably.


Sect's Racketeering Trial Is Set to Open
At the peak of his power, the man who calls himself the Son of God presided over a multimillion-dollar business and real estate empire, the Temple of Love Inc., and was courted by politicians.
But when Yahweh ben Yahweh goes on trial in Federal court here this week, jurors will hear former members of his group and more than 100 other witnesses argue that his reign was one of murder, arson, extortion and sexual exploitation.
Along with 15 followers, Yahweh ben Yahweh, a 56-year-old preacher who asserts that blacks are the true Israelites and that all whites are devils, is charged with masterminding the killings of 14 people in the Miami area in the 1980's.
His Nation of Yahweh, one of the names used by the group and which once claimed to have more than 20,000 members in 45 cities, is now on trial itself as a "continuing criminal racketeering enterprise" masquerading as a religion, according to the United States Government.


Paying to Train Volunteers To Work With the Neediest
The 2,000 to 3,000 new volunteers who come to the Community Service Society of New York every year often arrive with very definite plans about the kind of people they want to help.
Many have been inspired by news stories and documentaries, by Oprah, Geraldo and Donahue and by made-for-television movies.
"The Burning Bed," for example, which starred Farrah Fawcett as a battered wife, prompted many people to volunteer to work with abused women, said Maureen Curley, who runs the society's Retired Senior Volunteer Program.


Muslim Guards: Security Unit Maintaining Pride
Silent and stonefaced, they stand in their crisp suits and bow ties in some of the nation's toughest neighborhoods and assemblages, their hands folded neatly, their eyes scanning for the slightest sign of disruption.
More often than not, they work without pay.
They carry no arms.
Still, the guards from the Nation of Islam, who have been called to clean up crack-infested streets and protect black politicians and celebrities, wield a weapon that often eludes the police in black neighborhoods: respect.


Rain or Shine, It's Hail to the Redskins
The Redskins have reached the National Conference championship game because they are a better-balanced team than the Atlanta Falcons.
For the same reasons, the Redskins should beat the Lions here next Sunday to win the conference title and head for Super Bowl XXVI two weeks later.
Teams with gimmicks often win big games, but sooner or later they also lose them.
And in the National Football League playoffs, one loss sends you home.


Rise in Long-Term Rates Expected
The winter is usually a bad time for the bond market, with interest rates tending to rise, and some analysts expect this year to be no exception, even with the weak economy and low inflation.
"January and February has always been a tough time for the bond market," said James Kochan, fixed-income strategist for R. W. Baird &amp; Company in Milwaukee.
"I think between now and the quarterly refunding auctions in February, there will be a bit of a back-up in long-term interest rates, even though the fundamentals look very good."

BUSH WARNS SEOUL ON PACE OF PACTS WITH NORTH KOREA
Following several remarkable agreements intended to end four decades of war and hostility between the two Koreas, President Bush arrived here Sunday and quietly warned the South Korean leadership against moving too fast in dealings with the Communist North before hard evidence emerges that it is ending reported efforts to produce nuclear weapons.
At a private dinner Sunday night with South Korea's President, Roh Tae Woo, Mr.
Bush made it clear that he believed the cold war was far from over in northeast Asia, and seemed implicitly critical of Mr.
Roh for rushing into agreements with North Korea, according to Hyun Hong Choo, the South Korean Ambassador to Washington, who attended the dinner.
The accords, which the two nations signed on Dec. 31, include a nonaggression pact and a mutual vow to ban nuclear weapons from Korean territory.
Vague Terms on Inspections
But the agreements are vague about inspection of nuclear sites, something the North Korean Government of President Kim Il Sung has held off while he appears to be nearing the capability to build a crude nuclear weapon.

Fuming Assembly Returns To Simmering Tax Battle
When the Legislature reconvenes Monday morning, Democratic Assemblymen plan to be in the State House and Republicans plan to be across the street.
Whether they join their colleagues under the dome depends on whether enough Democrats show up.
More is at stake in the final eight days of the Democratically controlled 204th Legislature than the contentious and bitterly partisan issue of taxes -- redrawing the state's Congressional map, for one.
But the lengthy list of bills has essentially been put on hold until the Democrats prove they can overcome the hurdles the Republicans erected last month by not showing up.

New York Needs Three Heroes, Not One
Mayor David Dinkins, Gov.
Mario Cuomo and Felix Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, are likely to strike a deal soon that will shape the health of New York City's economy and the fiscal viability of its government.
Its elements may be outlined by Jan. 16, when the Mayor submits his four-year financial plan to the State Financial Control Board.
This plan should be examined to determine whether it addresses the city's underlying problems or merely papers over them.
The crux of the problem is that in the 1980's the government grew too large to be sustained by the economic base that remained after the Wall Street crash of October 1987 and the 1991 recession.
The first fiscal adjustment to this harsh problem was the budget adopted last June.
To close a $2.3 billion gap projected for the current fiscal year, the city adopted a "tax and slash" program.


Israelis Expecting Arabs to Attend Talks
Israeli negotiators headed tonight for another round of Middle East peace talks as senior officials here predicted that Arab delegations would also journey to Washington before long despite having delayed their travels to protest Israel's planned expulsion of 12 Palestinians from its occupied territories.
"They will come," said Health Minister Ehud Olmert, who is close to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
"Don't worry."

"The pain became unmanageable," Mr.
Kanengiser said.


Industry's Turmoil Is Shaking Out Other Fields
SINCE newspaper advertising began a steep decline about 18 months ago, many peripheral businesses and organizations that are nourished by the newspaper industry have gone on short rations.
For instance, as budgets have been tightened, newspapers have been cutting back sharply on sending employees to weeklong bouts of training.
In December, The Philadelphia Inquirer eliminated all conventions, seminars, group meetings and outside training, except those related to the opening of a new printing plant.


Honor to R.A.F. Leader Wakes Dresden's Ghosts
For two generations of Europeans, Dresden is a metaphor for mass destruction.
The city's name is rarely uttered without at least a trace of sorrow over the tens of thousands who perished here in the British and American firebomb attacks of Feb. 13-14, 1945.
Germany has since become a member of the Western alliance, and memories of Dresden's destruction have been steadily fading.
Suddenly, however, they are vivid again.


Taiwan Voted for Status Quo, not One China; A Stinging Defeat
To the Editor:
Contrary to your Dec. 24 editorial on the Dec. 21 Taiwan election, the ruling Kuomintang Party "victory" was not "a vote for one China." How could it be?
The Kuomintang-dominated Government banned the opposition party's platform of an independent "Republic of Taiwan" even from election posters.
The Government arrested a score of pro-independence leaders on election eve.


Neutrogena Drops Dailey &amp; Associates
The Neutrogena Corporation, Los Angeles, has ended its affiliation with Dailey &amp; Associates, Los Angeles, after two years of experimenting with stepped-up television advertising.
An advertising executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said the marketer of toiletries planned to add two agencies to its roster, while Eisaman, Johns &amp; Laws, Los Angeles, remains its agency of record.
Carlson &amp; Partners, New York, the agency for Polo/Ralph Lauren fragrances, will receive a portion of the account, the executive added, with Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre, San Francisco, being awarded some of the company's advertising on a project basis.

Sports of The Times; Bills Pledge: No Elway Drive III
NEVER look ahead until the game is over.
That's a National Football League commandment obeyed by coaches and players, at least publicly.
But near the end of their 37-14 rout of the Kansas City Chiefs yesterday, some of the Buffalo Bills were already thinking ahead to their American Conference championship confrontation here next Sunday with John Elway and the Denver Broncos.
"I knew Kansas City's offense wasn't geared to score quickly like Denver's is," Steve Tasker, the Pro Bowl special-teams tackler, was saying now at his locker.
"You saw Denver bounce back. You got to play 60 minutes against them. Elway had Drive II on Saturday. But we want to prevent Drive III next week."


Forecast for Norwood: Increasing Confidence
The question was subtle.
How significant, Scott Norwood was asked, was it to make that 47-yard field goal?
"It's always significant," the Buffalo Bills' kicker said.
"It's always good to make a field goal, to keep things positive."


The Difference a Few Blocks Can Make
At the Kingston Avenue subway station in Brooklyn this summer, a young black man stole David Ehrentreau's wide-brimmed black hat off his head.
Mr.
Ehrentreau, a Lubavitcher Jew, chased the man, but stopped when he crossed Eastern Parkway, the border separating the mostly Jewish Crown Heights from the mostly black and Hispanic Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Eventually, Mr.
Ehrentreau got back his hat after two other black men, who had pursued the thief, returned it to a local synagogue.
"It was a happy ending," his wife, Deborah Ehrentreau, said recently.
"But you don't want to go where you're not wanted. I wouldn't cross Eastern Parkway unless I had to."


Devils Do Swimmingly In the Cross-River Rivalry
After the Devils' triumph over the Rangers here on Saturday night, Coach Tom McVie of the Devils called the cross-river rivalry between the two teams "a war between New York and New Jersey."
"We have the war in Alberta," McVie said, referring to the rivalry between the Edmonton Oilers and the Calgary Flames.
"We have the war in Quebec," he said of the Montreal Canadiens and the Quebec Nordiques.
"Now, we have a war between New York and New Jersey."


State Democrats Consider Running Cuomo as Their 'Favorite Son'
Downstate Democratic leaders met yesterday and agreed to pursue the possibility of naming Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo a "favorite son" candidate in New York's Presidential primary on April 7.
But the state's party leader emphasized that a move for favorite son status in the primary was not the same as a draft-Cuomo movement for the Presidency.
John A. Marino, New York's Democratic Party Chairman, said the gathering, which was held at the party's state headquarters in midtown Manhattan, was called by Dominic J. Baranello, the Suffolk County Democratic leader and former state party chairman, and attended by some two dozen Democrats representing 13 counties from southern New York.


Quayle Tells of Effort to Be Vice President
Dan Quayle, as a little-known Senator from Indiana, reportedly conducted a quiet campaign in 1988 to persuade George Bush to make him the Republican Vice Presidential candidate.
"You don't run for Vice President," Mr.
Quayle is quoted as saying in The Washington Post today.
"But let me say that there're ways you can be put on the available chart."


Anger Mixed With Sorrow for Organist Suspected in Church Burglaries
Parishioners and clergymen at two churches in Woodbury, L.I., which have been robbed in the last year, expressed both sorrow and anger yesterday to learn that the suspect was a former church organist.
Violation of a Church
"We pray for that person because we don't know what caused him to go into a religious house of worship, damage it and steal sacred vessels," Msgr.
Anthony J. Savastano told some 200 worshipers at the Holy Name of Jesus Church at 675 Woodbury Road.


Foreign Affairs; Kennedy and Vietnam
On Oct. 11, 1963, President Kennedy issued top-secret National Security Action Memorandum 263.
In it he called for stepped-up training for South Vietnamese forces so they could take over the duties of U.S. forces, thus permitting the bulk of Americans to withdraw by 1965.
Based mainly on that document, Oliver Stone's "J.F.K." movie asks us to believe one of the great historical "ifs" of the century: that if the young President had survived through a second term, the U.S. would have been spared the ordeal of full-scale war in Vietnam.


Greenspan's Film 'Voice' Is Silenced
BUD GREENSPAN is grieving these days.
The writer, producer and director of the Olympic Games documentary films in a sense lost his voice on Dec. 28, when his brother, DAVID, died of lung cancer.

NEW YORK CITY SOVIET EMIGRE FATALLY SHOT
A Soviet Jewish emigre was shot and killed on a Brooklyn street corner as he rushed to defend his wife who had been punched by one of three muggers, the police said.

HEIRESS, LIBRARY, NURSE AND LAWYER
When Alice Curtis Desmond died in 1990 leaving an $18 million estate and no heirs, the trustees of the library she founded and liberally supported in the decade before her death anticipated a settled future.
But when the will was read, the trustees and many residents of Garrison, N.Y., were dismayed to learn that the millions the heiress had left to the library would be all but eaten up in taxes on the $2 million apiece she left to her nurse and lawyer.
This conflict of death and taxes inexorably led to court.

Frightening Consumers, Carelessly
For a brief time last summer, every taxpayer in Norwich, Vt., was listed as a deadbeat, the result of an incredible error inserted in their credit histories by TRW Inc., one of three companies that dominate the credit-reporting industry in America.
The error: A novice data collector mistook a list of taxpayers for a list of
tax delinquents.
TRW says it expunged the mistakes and altered procedures to keep them from recurring.
But that did little for the trauma of Norwich residents who found themselves potentially creditless, with credit cards, mortgage applications and even Norwich's good name in doubt.

General Cinema's Big Bet On Harcourt Brace's Revival
Richard A. Smith, the chairman of the General Cinema Corporation, once asked students at the Harvard Business School to estimate how much his company should pay for a motel chain.
So the students turned in sophisticated financial analyses.

Mr.

The problem, he said, was that motel chains pick the best locations first.
Most new locations would never be as profitable and future growth would be limited.

SportsMonday, page C1.


It's a Runaway for Lions On Their Passing Game
Playing the National Football League's version of chicken, Dallas stacked the line of scrimmage with defenders to stop Detroit running back Barry Sanders.
The Cowboys dared the Lions to beat them with a passing game that was crippled by injuries to three key receivers and guided by a quarterback, Erik Kramer, who had played the previous nine games as if he were incognito.
It wasn't until late in the third quarter, when Kramer had thrown his third touchdown pass of the day, and early in the fourth quarter, when Sanders got loose on a 47-yard touchdown run, that the Cowboys realized that their plan had failed miserably.
By then it was too late.
Kramer had been unmasked as a legitimate passing threat and the Cowboys had stumbled to a 38-6 loss today before 78,290 screaming fans at the Silverdome.


Albany Legislators Face Tough Session With Combustible Mix
Although it never really seemed to leave town, the State Legislature returns to Albany this week to convene a session that many participants predict will be the most difficult in recent memory because of an uncommonly combustible mixture of political ingredients.

Bills Leave Chiefs With Nowhere to Go
The Buffalo Bills had decided long before the kickoff that their playoff fight here this afternoon with the Kansas City Chiefs would be decided by turning the game into a match of options on offense.

"Privatization in Eastern Europe has been a debacle," Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at Harvard University, said at the three-day annual meeting of the American Economics Association here, which concluded today.
The topic of economic reform and aid to former Communist nations overshadowed discussions about the sluggish economy in the United States.


BATTERED INDUSTRIES Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors; Automobiles: What Detroit Car Makers Can Do While Waiting for the Recovery
The huge cutbacks announced by the General Motors Corporation just before Christmas capped what had already been a grim year for the American auto makers, and 1992 does not look much brighter.
After layoffs, plant closings and other cost-cutting steps, most industry executives say they can do little now but wait for a stronger economy.
Their 1992 models are already in production, and 1993 models are set as well.
The hope is that growth picks up and consumers flock to the showrooms.

Keep the Bicyclists Off the Sidewalks
To the Editor:
The debate over cyclist vs. pedestrian safety in Central Park overshadows a more ominous metropolitan menace: the peril posed to walkers on city sidewalks by unprincipled bicyclists -- messengers, restaurant deliverers, commuters and exercisers -- who have abandoned riding with traffic in favor of careering wantonly and recklessly down congested sidewalks.


Bridge
Half a century ago two young men, Alvin Roth and Tobias Stone, won the National Open Pair Championship in Syracuse and introduced the bridge world to a new idea that is now standard.
It was the forcing no-trump response to a major opening, which makes it possible for two-level suit responses to show strong hands, virtually guaranteeing game.
Subsequently the Roth-Stone system gave us the negative double, the unusual no-trump and other theoretical ideas that are now well-known.
Roth is still creative, as his latest book shows.
It is "Picture Bidding," available in hard-cover for $24.95 including mailing from "Bridge Today," 18 Village View Bluff, Ballston Lake N.Y. 12019.


Bills and Notes This Week
The tentative schedule of Treasury financings this week includes the regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills today, followed on Wednesday by an auction of new seven-year notes.
On Thursday, the Treasury plans to auction new one-year bills.
By late in the day on Friday, the outstanding three-month bill was bid at 3.85 percent and the six-month bill was bid at 3.88 percent; the one-year was at 3.94 percent.
In when-issued trading -- between when a new security is announced and the time it is issued -- the seven-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.49 percent.


Film Critics' Award to 'Life Is Sweet'
"Life Is Sweet," Mike Leigh's gastronomic view of family life in an English suburb, was voted last night the best film of 1991 by the National Society of Film Critics, a 35-member group representing critics from New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities.
Alison Steadman and Jane Horrocks, who play a mother and daughter in the film, were voted best actress and best supporting actress, respectively.
River Phoenix was voted best actor for his performance as a narcoleptic male hustler in "My Own Private Idaho," and Harvey Keitel was named best supporting actor for roles in three films: "Bugsy," "Thelma and Louise" and "Mortal Thoughts." David Cronenberg was voted both best director and best screenwriter for his adaptation of William S. Burroughs's novel "Naked Lunch."

Tax Breaks Proposed for U.S. Autos
Tax incentives for Americans who buy domestically made cars could help stimulate sales and save "a dying industry" in Detroit, a research organization has proposed.
Calling on the Government to intervene as an advocate for the Big Three auto makers, a report by the Economic Strategy Institute advocates diverting some money from military research and development into a low-interest loan for a cooperative research and development project.
The report suggested that the project be sponsored by the auto makers.


A Big Oil Find By Occidental
The Occidental Petroleum Corporation has made an important oil find in northwest Oman, the country's oil minister, Said Ahmed al-Shanfari, said today.
The Los Angeles-based company discovered large quantities of light crude oil at the site in the Suneinah concession, Mr.
Shanfari said in a statement to the Oman News Agency.
He gave no details but said the find was "very encouraging."


Arizona St. Hires Cal Coach
Bruce Snyder, who turned California into a Pacific-10 football power, will try to do the same at Arizona State.
Snyder resigned as coach at California on Saturday night and accepted the job at Arizona State, where he will make more than twice as much money as he did leading the Golden Bears to a 10-2 record in 1991.


Japan U.N. Role Dubious: Bush
President Bush today gave only tepid support to proposals that Japan be given a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, saying the idea has merit but would be "extraordinarily difficult."
Speaking at a news conference in Seoul, Mr.
Bush said "various friends" of Washington have approached him about expanding the five-member permanent security council to reflect a world in which Japan, Germany and other nations have emerged as economic, if not military superpowers.


Review/Rap; The World of Hip-Hop Returns to the Garden
The concert on Friday night at Madison Square Garden took place without any deaths or arrests, and about 14,000 people had a good time seeing favorite performers.
Normally, that would be taken for granted, but Friday's concert had a severe symbolic burden.
The show, featuring Public Enemy and six other acts, was the first all-rap concert at the Garden since late in 1987, when there were some highly publicized incidents of violence at rap events and insurance costs soared.
Rap tours have continued to play arenas around the United States, but had been absent from the Garden, a shame since the music was born in New York City.
On Friday, there was a major police presence outside the Garden, as well as metal detectors at entrances and many uniformed Garden personnel within.


Tartabull Agrees to Yankee Contract
Making a dramatic turnaround from their winter-long slumber, the Yankees executed a stunning move late last night, reaching agreement with Danny Tartabull, the most attractive free agent still available, on a five-year contract worth $27 million.
The Yankees made no immediate announcement, but a friend who spoke to Tartabull said the slugging outfielder told him shortly after negotiations were completed that he had accepted the Yankees' offer of $25.5 million in signing bonus and salary plus $1.5 million in endorsements.
The friend provided the information on condition he not be identified.


Cairo Journal; Militant Islam's Conquest Stops at Egypt's Border
In a small, barren room in downtown Cairo, three bearded members of the outlawed Holy War organization gathered late one evening to plot the next move in their struggle to topple the Egyptian Government.
But the euphoria of a decade ago, when these men were part of a group that gunned down President Anwar el-Sadat and seemed able to challenge the state, was gone.
Instead they talked morosely of comrades killed in clashes with the police and leaders languishing in prison.


Review/Philharmonic; The Many Sides of William Bolcom
William Bolcom's Clarinet Concerto had its premiere on Friday night at Avery Fisher Hall.
In the process it seemed to divide a New York Philharmonic audience into a number of camps.
First there were those taken aback by its accessibility.
Others were evidently suspicious of it.
Still others -- those perhaps unburdened by a recent history of public estrangement from new music -- seemed to welcome accessibility as their due.
Mr.
Bolcom's piece, as played by Stanley Drucker and conducted by Leonard Slatkin, was indeed easy to listen to, so much so that it often fit comfortably under the rubric of easy-listening.


BATTERED INDUSTRIES Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors; Banking: After Falling Into Risky Habits, Banks Relearn Value of Prudence
Recessions have never been kind to banks, and the current economic downturn is no exception.
But even when the economy recovers, the scars in the banking industry will remain, and bankers are vowing not to return to their old habits.
From giant Citicorp to small savings banks, bankers are relearning the principles of safe lending -- sometimes to the dismay of real estate developers and others in business.
But while banks tighten their lending standards to keep a rein on future loan losses, there are no miracle cures for the record amounts of bad loans already on their books.
Since most bankers cannot afford the losses that would occur if they sold these loans, they must nurse them along.
They can foreclose, carry borrowers under easier terms or offer new loans in hopes that more money will put some troubled developers over the hump.


Tentative Pact Reached in 3-Month-Old Steel Strike in Pennsylvania


Dance in Review
Lorellen Green
Performance Space 122
"Mangia Mangia" promised to be a theatrical banquet.
Lorellen Green took the title of her dance, which she presented on Friday night, from the Italian word for "eat." The floor was littered with plates of pasta, and the piece began when Peter Lynn entered riding an eccentrically designed bicycle that had a water wheel and an enormous rack attached to it.
He could have been a delivery man filling orders for food and drink.
But not enough sustenance arrived.


Tokyo Stocks Up Sharply
Stocks jumped in Japan today following the record highs reached last week on Wall Street.
Trading was limited to the morning on the first day after the weeklong New Year's holiday.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 817.41 points, or 3.56 percent, to close at 23,801.18.
An estimated 180 million shares were traded.


Topics of The Times; When the President Passes Go
Prof.
David Weimer teaches the 4,000-year-old game of Go at the University of Rochester.
A few lessons might have helped President Bush prepare for this week's encounters in Seoul and Tokyo.
One out of five males in Korea plays it.
So do 10 million Japanese.
Professor Weimer aims to infuse students with the mind-set of Far Eastern culture.
Western games like chess, he says, take "the Clausewitzean view of conflict -- go for the capital and destroy everything along the way." (Mr. Bush's bombastic buildup to the trade talks is a striking example.) But in Go, Professor Weimer says, "you have to be patient; early moves may not have full consequences until much later."


How the Pasha in 'Ghosts' Grew So Big
Near the end of the first act of "The Ghosts of Versailles" -- the new opera by the composer John Corigliano and the librettist William Hoffman that has its final performances of the season at the Metropolitan Opera tomorrow and Friday evenings -- the ghost world of Beaumarchais, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and the French court dissolves into a colorful fantasy set in the Turkish Embassy in Paris in 1793.
The scene that unfolds over the next 10 minutes is mostly peripheral to the plot of the opera; in fact, it was composed not so much to advance the story as to give the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne a star turn.
Yet a combination of compositional, vocal and staging virtuosity has made the scene one of the most talked about parts of an opera that has proved to be an enormous popular success.


Severe Turbulence Injures 13 On Brazilian Flight to U.S.
Thirteen people aboard a TransBrasil Airlines jetliner were injured Saturday morning when the plane encountered severe turbulence near Puerto Rico, airline and Government officials said.
An airline spokeswoman, Jeri Beth Katz, said 12 passengers and a flight attendant were hurt.
The most serious injuries were a broken arm, suffered by the flight attendant, and a passenger's dislocated shoulder, she added.


Taiwan Voted for Status Quo, Not One China
To the Editor:
Having just returned from a mission to observe Taiwan's Dec. 21 National Assembly elections, I must differ with "A Strong Vote for One China" (editorial, Dec. 24).


Don't Look for Jobs in Japan
Americans buy much more from the Japanese than the Japanese buy from the U.S.
Everybody knows that these huge trade deficits force Americans out of work.
That's why President Bush is leading an entourage of big-shot executives to pressure the Japanese to import more goods and thereby create "jobs, jobs, jobs."
But what everybody knows just isn't true.
Trade deficits don't cause unemployment; indeed, the number of employed Americans is unrelated to the size of the trade deficit.
If that statement seems to contradict common sense, just recall the 1980's, when the U.S. rang up $100 billion trade deficits yet operated near full employment.
Bashing Japan might make good campaign rhetoric, but it's unlikely to lower the unemployment rate one tick.


Rogers Is Named
William Rogers, a former Secretary of State and Attorney General, was named yesterday to be chairman of the United States Olympic Committee's new ethics oversight committee.


Devils Consistently Seeking Consistency
The president of the New Jersey Devils doesn't want to hear about the team's accomplishments in the first half of the season.
If you want to talk to Lou Lamoriello about his hockey team, go see him late in the spring.
Even after their 6-4 victory over the Rangers here Saturday night gave the Devils their 20th victory -- the first time in club history that they have had 20 at the halfway point of a season -- Lamoriello was careful not to sound overwhelmingly optimistic.
He knows better than anyone how inconsistent his team can be.


Putting a Strong Breeze to Good Use


Toward Managing Memory
COMPUTER memories are made of silicon, and a computer can never have too many.
A new program is intended to organize those memories.
Adding memory to a Macintosh is a relatively straightforward proposition although opening the box with the one-piece models calls for special tools.
Still, after the chips are put in, the computer knows what to do with them.
The SE/30 around here, formerly a two-megabyte clunker, now barrels along with five.
System 7.0 loves elbow room.


Science of Home Runs
Long before he was a professor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's department of aeronautics and astronautics, Dr.
Paul Lagace was a Red Sox fan.
So when the roof behind home plate was torn down after the 1988 season and replaced with a higher one, he noticed that fewer balls were hit into the center field stands.
"I have season tickets in the center field bleachers, and it was easy to see that something was up," he said.
Balls that once soared into the stands were falling short.


Lawmaker Seeks Revamping of Military
In the aftermath of the Soviet Union's demise, the United States military must make top-to-bottom changes in its size, shape and missions to deal with a new array of international security threats, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said today.
Outlining a broad framework for restructuring the Pentagon, the panel chairman, Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, entered a battle that is unfolding between Congress and the Bush Administration over the changing role of the American military.

Gorman Puts McEnroe And Leach on Cup Team
John McEnroe and Rick Leach were named yesterday to the 1992 United States Davis Cup Team by captain Tom Gorman, completing the four-man squad that faces Argentina in the first round at Hawaii's Mauna Lani Racquet Club from Jan. 31 to Feb. 2.
Gorman had previously picked Andre Agassi (12-4 in Davis Cup play) and Pete Sampras (0-2) as his singles players.
But he had been undecided about selecting a doubles unit following consecutive losses by established doubles teams in the 1991 semifinal (Scott Davis and David Pate) and final (Ken Flach and Robert Seguso) rounds.


Jets' Quarterback Coach Is Dismissed by Coslet
In what may be one more sign that they are contemplating a major change at quarterback next season, the Jets announced yesterday that they are not renewing the contract of Joe Daniels, the quarterbacks coach.
"I appreciate the job Joe did for us the past two seasons, but I've decided to make a change and go in another direction," Jets Coach Bruce Coslet said in a brief announcement issued by the club.


O'Connor Says Jerusalem Issue Fades
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York said today that the Vatican's views on Jerusalem had changed and that Israel's disputed control of the entire city no longer seemed to be an impediment to possible diplomatic relations between this country and the Holy See.
"The Church has no particular interest in who controls Jerusalem, who does the housekeeping for Jerusalem," the Cardinal said after meeting with the city's Mayor, Teddy Kollek.


Consumer Videophone By A.T.&amp; T.
The picture phone, that Tomorrowland marvel of Disneyland in the 1960's, is here -- well, almost.
A.T.&amp; T. announced yesterday that in May it plans to start selling a mass-market videophone for $1,500, about one-twentieth the cost of equipment meant for big corporations.
The new phone takes advantage of the latest signal-processing techniques, called compression technology, which edit out all but the essential features of a television picture.


WASHINGTON JOINS U.N. IN CONDEMNING ISRAELI EXPULSIONS
In the harshest criticism of Israeli policies ever made at the Security Council by the United States, the Bush Administration joined other Council members today in a resolution that "strongly condemns" the decision by Israel to deport 12 Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied territories.
As a result of the Israeli Government decision, which was announced last week but has not yet been put into effect, Palestinian and other Arab delegations declined to come to Washington for the resumption on Tuesday of the American-brokered direct peace talks with Israel.
The Palestinians had strongly hinted that a Security Council criticism might lead the Arabs back to the table, and the Bush Administration's vote today was clearly aimed at coaxing the Arabs back.


D.M.B.&amp; B. Changes On Burger King
William R. Kelly has been named executive vice president and managing partner at D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles in New York, in charge of the agency's Burger King account, a spokesman said yesterday, confirming a report in this week's issue of Advertising Age.


Chess
The Yugoslav Chess Federation had guaranteed the safety of the participants in the women's interzonal tournament in Subotica and it kept its word.
Although the explosion of bombs 20 miles away could be heard, the chess competition went off without a hitch.
Boris Gulko, of Fairlawn, N.J., the grandmaster coach of the Americans, wrote, in the Dec. 23 issue of Inside Chess: "I must congratulate the organizers of the 35-player event. Playing conditions were excellent. Yugoslavia is really a chess country."


New York City and L.I. Would Gain From Water Exchanges
To the Editor:
David Major, former chief of water resource planning for New York City, calls for additional water conservation to manage increasing demand and also new studies to increase system capacity (letter, Dec. 7).
He writes of an average shortfall of 250 million gallons a day, which could create severe drought emergencies every nine years, and implies larger shortfalls if the city system has to provide future water to Long Island.


Power Failure Darkens Much of Washington
Much of the capital was plunged into darkness early this evening when a power cable failed, turning out most of the lights at the State Department and the Federal Reserve Board, and producing a flickering at the White House before emergency generators took over.
People were trapped in elevators, and rush-hour traffic was snarled when the power failure occurred about 5:15 P.M.
Some power, including that on parts of Connecticut Avenue in the downtown area, began returning at 7 P.M.


American Home Shuffles Accounts
The American Home Products Corporation, based in New York, has reassigned among five agencies the accounts of several of the largest brands at its Whitehall Laboratories and A. H. Robins divisions.
In the shuffle, an American Home Products spokesman said yesterday, advertising for the Anacin pain relievers and Riopan antacid was reassigned from Partners &amp; Shevack in New York, to, respectively, McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York, and Avrett, Free &amp; Ginsberg, also in New York.
Partners &amp; Shevack still handles advertising for other American Home Products brands; McCann handles the company's Dristan line.

Energy Companies to Curb Drilling
Dismayed by low prices for oil and natural gas, many energy companies are concluding that it makes more sense to buy than to drill.
This finding -- from an annual survey by Salomon Brothers of the spending plans of 241 energy companies -- is more bad news for the battered oilfield services industry, the worst-performing sector of the stock market in 1991.


Scientists Unraveling Chemistry Of Dreams
SCIENTISTS studying the sleeping brain are making new progress in understanding the nerve cells and messenger chemicals that paint the mysterious mental images known as dreams.
The purpose of dreams remains as elusive as ever.
Some scientists believe they help consolidate the memories and learning that took place the previous day.
Others see dreams as a mechanism for allowing busy brain cells to recharge their depleted stocks of transmitter chemicals.
There is no physiological support so far, however, for Freud's view of dreams as repressed wishes, and psychoanalysts are for the most part busy trying to cut and trim their guru's theory to the framework of modern findings.


Black Children Beaten in Bias Attack, Police Say
Two black youngsters walking to school in the Bronx were beaten by white teen-agers yesterday and sprayed with a white substance in what the police have classified as a bias incident.
The attack at Allerton Avenue and Boston Road was quickly criticized by Mayor David N. Dinkins, who called it "truly heinous."


El Salvador Gets Loan
The International Monetary Fund said today that it would lend El Salvador $60 million to help it strengthen its economy after 12 years of civil war.
The 14-month credit agreement is designed to bolster El Salvador's 1992 economic reform program and to encourage others to pledge aid.


With Frustration, Yet Hope, Donors Give to Neediest Cases
"The individuals who populate our street corners and vestibules, our subway benches and vacant lots, seem increasingly to have passed a line beyond which there is not even hope," Mary S. Glucksman of Manhattan wrote in a note attached to her $500 contribution to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"I've stopped waiting to be asked for change in recent weeks; instead I've pulled bills from my pocket and thrust them at those who appear cold and hungry. This seems to me a paltry token effort, so I thought I would give something more substantial. I am sending it to you because I believe that you will use it best and because your colorful stories of the people who give and those who receive renews my faith in my fellow New Yorkers each year."


Classical Music in Review
'Honey and Rue'  Orchestra of St. Luke's Carnegie Hall
"Honey and Rue," with music by Andre Previn, lyrics by Toni Morrison and singing by Kathleen Battle, is the third major premiere in the last few weeks to have reached out eagerly for its audience from the opening bars.
At the Metropolitan Opera it has been "The Ghosts of Versailles"; at Avery Fisher Hall the Bolcom Clarinet Concerto, and on Sunday afternoon, with the help of the Orchestra of St.
Luke's and a quartet of jazz players, it was Mr.
Previn's settings of six texts.


Jeweler on Job a Day After Robber's Death
A 71-year-old jewelry store owner was back in his Chinatown store yesterday morning, but he said it was not easy, one day after killing a 40-year-old man who had tried to rob him.
The store owner, Herman Moser, said that he found that he could not concentrate on his work and that his eyes flickered to the door to size up anyone who entered his store, Canal Material House, at 94 Canal Street.





Nemchinov Finds Net, And Words
Sergei Nemchinov scored a goal, set up two others and then conducted his first postgame interview in English.
On a night when the humdrum Winnipeg Jets were at Madison Square Garden to absorb a methodical 4-2 licking by the Rangers, Nemchinov's stickhandling and linguistic grand slam provided the only real excitement in the house.


Oklahoma State to Big Eight: Beware
Oklahoma State held Kansas State to 11 first-half points tonight and went on to beat the Wildcats, 72-34, in their bruising Big Eight opener.
Sean Sutton scored 16 points as the Cowboys, now 13-0 and ranked third by The Associated Press, won their 23d straight home game.
Kansas State, held to 29-percent shooting, dropped to 6-4.


Woman, 25, Wins Right to Die
A Quebec judge today approved a request by a 25-year- old woman that her doctor be authorized to switch off the respirator that has kept her alive for the last two and a half years, setting what legal experts described as a precedent for such cases in Canada.
Jacques Dufour, a judge of Quebec's Superior Court, issued the ruling five weeks after the woman put her request directly to a court hearing that convened in her hospital room in Quebec City.

A Clemens Victory
A judge in Houston has dismissed a charge against Boston Red Sox pitcher ROGER CLEMENS, who was found not guilty last month of another charge stemming from an alleged barroom brawl with an off-duty police officer.
The misdemeanor charge of interfering with a public servant was dropped Friday by Judge JAMES BARKLEY, said GEORGE TYSON, a lawyer for Clemens.


What Gloom? 4 Newcomers Turn Out Best Sellers
Some points of light flickering through the gloom that cloaks the fashion business today are the new designers.
Usually in their 30's, these creative people are also entrepreneurs.
They have established viable businesses during a bleak economic time and their clothes show up on stores' best-seller lists.
Their forte is party clothes, probably because there is more opportunity for expression in evening than daytime styles: customers are more accepting of flights of fancy.


What Lies Ahead For Users
THE new year is upon us, and it is customary among pundits to try to divine what lies ahead in 1992 from what occurred in 1991.
It does not require much of a leap to predict that computer prices will continue to fall, as they have every year since the industry started.
PC makers have realized that if they are to survive in 1992 (and some of them may not), they must reduce their manufacturing costs and learn to survive with thinner profit margins.
The pressure will be most intense on the big companies, including the International Business Machines Corporation, Apple Computer Inc., the Compaq Computer Corporation and the Tandy Corporation.

Tax Repeal Is Introduced In Assembly Tactics Duel
After weeks of a Republican boycott that brought legislating to a halt in the State Assembly, Democratic members finally managed a quorum today and introduced two sets of bills that would repeal the $2.8 billion tax increase they rammed through the Legislature 18 months ago.
But truculent Republicans, who showed up for the session only after the Democrats achieved a 42-member majority on their own, continued their stalling tactics.
An Appropriations Committee hearing on the repeal package was delayed until late in the evening as wary Democrats refused to leave the Assembly floor for fear that a new Republican boycott would emerge and again deny a quorum if committee members left for a hearing.

On My Mind; Presenting Hypocrisy Inc.
President Bush lands in Tokyo with 21 top American business executives and a full cargo of economic evasion, self-delusion, bombast and prefabricated "agreements" that cleverly avoid the realities of the problems between the United States and Japan.
But that's all right -- it will be fair trade at its best.
The Japanese will meet him with their own complete product line of economic hypocrisy, including that new and fast-growing specialty, contempt lightly camouflaged as compassion.


Intel Is Top U.S. Chip Maker
The Intel Corporation, propelled by sales of its microprocessors, passed Motorola Inc. to become the largest American manufacturer of semiconductors in 1991, according to preliminary rankings by Dataquest, a marketing company in San Jose, Calif.
Dataquest also estimated that American manufacturers of semiconductors dropped slightly in worldwide market share to 35.9 percent, from 36.5 percent in 1990, while the share held by Japanese manufacturers rose to 49.6 percent, from 48.7 percent.
In 1990, the American market share had risen and the Japanese share had fallen for the first time in years, largely owing to a collapse in prices of memory chips, a category dominated by Japanese producers.


Treat Haitian Asylum Seekers Equally
To the Editor:
"Haitians Are No Exception" by Daniel A. Stein (Op-Ed, Dec. 14) does not protest the exceptional treatment given to Haitians seeking asylum on our shores.
Our Government's position on Haitian boat people is clearly discriminatory, contrasted with the welcome we give, almost without exception, to Cubans, Vietnamese and Russians (and, going back a few years, to Czechs, Hungarians and others fleeing Communist countries).


Utilities Want Rates to Cover Health Costs
Public utility companies across the country are applying for substantial rate increases to finance the expensive medical benefits they have promised to their current and future retirees.
The increases, if granted universally, would add more than $4 billion each year to the nation's electric, gas and telephone bills, according to Government economists.
The requested increases have drawn strong opposition from state officials and consumer groups, in part because utility employees and retirees typically receive far more generous medical benefits than most Americans.

In Nuclear Deal, Seoul Halts War Game With U.S.
South Korea today canceled the huge annual military maneuvers it was due to hold here with United States forces, after receiving indications that North Korea is ready to allow inspections of its secret nuclear installations.
There was no United States confirmation of the cancellation.


For Black Students in South Africa, Dismal Scores
In a confirmation of the crisis affecting black education in South Africa, more than half of its black high school students failed their final examinations in 1991, despite a modest improvement in the pass rate over 1990.
The Department of Education and Training, which supervises black education, announced that 39.2 percent of 287,666 black candidates passed their matriculation examinations, as the battery of comprehensive high school tests are called.


Let the Commercials Begin. And They Have.
The assault of the Olympic commercials has begun, as CBS pitches its February broadcast of the Winter Olympics from Albertville and NBC hawks its July 26-Aug. 9 pay-per-view cable package of the Summer Olympics from Barcelona, Spain.
The goals of both are divergent.
The intent of CBS's "Share a Moment With the World" campaign is to remind viewers to tune in from Feb. 8-23 -- a conventional promotional strategy.


Treat Haitian Asylum Seekers Equally; Punishing the People
To the Editor:
My company sells rosebuds and ribbon flowers to many industries.
Most of our work has been done in Haiti, which has the poorest economy in North America.
We have been through Duvalier regimes with never a word from Washington.
But to punish the new military government, President Bush has ordered trade with Haiti to stop.


Inmate Killed in Brooklyn
A convicted murderer serving 15 years to life at the Brooklyn House of Detention died last night, apparently choked to death by another inmate, the police said.
Andrew Lawrence, 20 years old, who had been in jail since October 1989, was discovered lying unconscious, outside his cell, at 5:40 P.M., officials said.
He died later at Long Island College Hospital.
The police said that another inmate, who was being questioned last night, had confessed to the killing.


The Politics of Finding Homosexuality Genetic; What of Bisexuality?
To the Editor:
"Are Some People Born Gay" by Michael Bailey and Richard Pillard (Op-Ed, Dec. 17) falls into the trap the "civilized world" has set for anyone wishing to discuss this topic for 2,000 years.
The strange and grave reluctance to admit of bisexuality leads straights and gays alike to think of themselves as one or the other.
Only the ancient Greeks seemed to grasp the fundamental bisexuality of human nature without hypocrisy.

LSI Is Leaving Sematech; First of Founders to Defect
The LSI Logic Corporation today became the first founding member to drop out of the semiconductor consortium Sematech, citing disagreements with the industry group's agenda as well as the company's own financial imperatives.
The move by LSI comes as the consortium, a pioneering experiment in industrial cooperation by American companies, is seeking Government approval to continue its program for an additional five years after its initial five-year charter expires in October.
Sematech, based in Austin, Tex., has a budget of about $200 million a year, half provided by the Defense Department and half by its member companies, which until now numbered 14.

Business and Health; Companies' Costs: How Much Is Fair?
LARGE employers, especially manufacturers, are telling Congress they have been saddled with an unfair share of the nation's health-care spending.
A new study for the National Association of Manufacturers contends that hospitals overcharged employers by $10.8 billion in 1991 to make up for losses on unpaid bills.
The study by Lewin/ICF, a Washington-based health-care consulting firm, also said that hospitals charged an additional $10.6 billion because Medicaid and Medicare payments did not fully cover hospital costs.
The association estimated that employees and their employers -- including Federal, state and local governments -- spent $171 billion on health care last year.


Stein Plans Fund-Raiser And Dinkins Sees Red
Mayor David N. Dinkins is not invited to the feast, but he already has indigestion over the plans of his longtime rival, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, to host a glittering political dinner with Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Shirley MacLaine to raise more than $2 million.
In fact, Mr.
Dinkins has been so concerned that some of his own friends were listed among the committee members on the invitation to Mr.
Stein's "Birthday Celebration" Jan. 21 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel that he has called up to ask if they were abandoning him for Mr.
Stein, two years before the next mayoral election.
That put some of them where they least like to be -- in the spotlight in a public feud.


Cadillac, Aiming at Luxury Imports, Shows New Engine
Cadillac took the wraps off a powerful new multivalve engine, the Northstar, today.
The engine is intended to make the G.M. division more competitive with German and Japanese luxury car makers.
Japanese auto makers owe part of their success in the United States to multivalve engine technology, which develops more horsepower from smaller, lighter engines that operate at higher speeds and are often quieter than conventional engines.
Luxury car buyers increasingly demand the quiet, smooth power delivered by Lexus, Infiniti and Mercedes models.

Neither Party Offering a Good Economic Plan
To the Editor:
The failure of economists to expect much uplift to the economy from the Democratic Party plan to give middle-income families a tax cut of about $8 a week is easy to understand.
People concerned about losing their jobs would be slow to spend the extra money, even if they noticed it in their paychecks.

Brady, on Bush Trip, Expected to Press Tokyo
Japan's Finance Minister made a surprise announcement today that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady would accompany President Bush on his visit here, which begins Tuesday.
The announcement caused speculation that he might press Japan for financial measures to bolster the ailing American economy and to help American companies doing business in Japan.
Japanese and American officials were unusually tight-lipped about Mr.
Brady's visit and its purpose, other than acknowledging that he was coming, and that added to the speculative fervor.
A senior Treasury official has been here since the weekend negotiating with the Japanese, but officials would say only that a range of macroeconomic issues have been discussed.

Lions Are Planning to Do Their Talking on the Field
It was quite clear, immediately after Detroit had shut the mouths of a few Dallas players with a convincing 38-6 victory, that Coach Wayne Fontes of the Lions did not want to provide the Washington Redskins with the same kind of fuel that the Cowboys used to stoke the flames leading up to Sunday's game at the Silverdome.
The Cowboys were embarrassed by the Lions in a regular-season game at the Silverdome and some Dallas players took the opportunity last week to say that they were looking forward to returning to Detroit to even the score.


Global Warming Threat Found in Aircraft Fumes
NITROGEN oxide fumes emitted by aircraft exert 30 times as great an effect on climate as the same fumes emitted at ground level by industrial processes and the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, British scientists have calculated.
The nitrogen oxides react with other chemicals in the air to create ozone in the troposphere, or lower atmosphere.
At higher altitudes, in the stratosphere, ozone blocks ultraviolet rays from the sun that can cause cancer in humans.
In the troposphere, ozone is toxic to plants and animals, and it is one of a number of tropospheric gases -- carbon dioxide is the chief one -- that trap heat.
Many scientists believe that increases in the gases as a result of human activity will cause the earth's climate to warm substantially in coming decades.


Text of Resolution on Israeli Expulsion Plan
Following is the text of Security Council Resolution 726, adopted unanimously today, condemning Israel's decision to deport 12 Palestinians:
THE SECURITY COUNCIL,
RECALLING the obligations of member states under the United Nations Charter,
RECALLING its Resolutions 607 (1988), 608 (1988), 636 (1989), 641 (1989) and 694 (1991),
HAVING BEEN APPRISED of the decision of Israel, the occupying power, to deport 12 Palestinian civilians from the occupied Palestinian territories,
1.
STRONGLY CONDEMNS the decision of Israel, the occupying power, to resume deportations of Palestinian civilians;
2.
REAFFIRMS the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 to all the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem;
3.
REQUESTS Israel, the occupying power, to refrain from deporting any Palestinian civilian from the occupied territories;
4.
ALSO REQUESTS Israel, the occupying power, to insure the safe and immediate return to the occupied territories of all those deported;
5. DECIDES to keep the matter under review.


Man Freed in Arson Case Is Arrested in Killing
A man who spent almost a decade in prison for setting a notorious 1978 blaze that left six firefighters dead at a Waldbaum's supermarket in Brooklyn was arrested yesterday and charged with strangling a pregnant homeless woman last November at a deserted concession stand in Coney Island.
The suspect, Eric Jackson, also known as Eric Knight, was seized at State Supreme Court in Brooklyn when he appeared for a hearing on a possible new trial in the Waldbaum's case.
He was charged last night with the murder of Linda Cassella, 43 years old, in a concession stand at West 33d Street on Coney Island's Boardwalk.

Linking Arms Cuts to Taxes
Senator Phil Gramm, one of the most influential Republican lawmakers on budget policy, called today for a 5 percent cut in military spending by 1993 to allow the Government to raise the personal income tax exemption for every taxpayer by $416.
The conservative Texas Republican said his plan would result in a $466-a-year tax cut for a family of four whose income is $35,000.
Because Mr.
Gramm's proposal would cut military spending by more than the 1990 budget agreement provided for, it would bend, if not break, the agreement, which he helped to negotiate.
Significance of Remarks
Mr.
Gramm's proposed cut in military spending from $291 billion this year to $276.5 billion in the 1994 fiscal year and $275.3 billion by the 1995 fiscal year is thought to be close to the kind of cut President Bush is thinking of proposing in his State of the Union Message later this month.
By making his proposal first, Mr.
Gramm could protect Mr.
Bush from criticism by Congressional conservatives who warn that military spending has already been sliced enough.


As Bonn Talks Louder, Some in the U.S. Wince
United States policy makers concerned with eastern and western Europe say they have become disturbed during the last six months by what they regard as new assertiveness on the part of the German Government and its willingness to flex its muscles in international relations.
Some of these officials -- at the White House below the level of President Bush, and at the State Department below the level of Secretary James A. Baker 3d -- say they are worried about this issue.
Their response for the time being is to discuss their feelings among themselves but not to convey them to the Germans.

Embattled Georgian Leader Flees; Opposition Council Claims Power
The embattled President of the former Soviet republic of Georgia slipped away from the capital, Tbilisi, this morning, as rebel forces stormed the Parliament building where he and members of his family had been holed up during a violent two-week siege.
The leader, Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia, who had been elected with 87 percent of the vote less than nine months ago as the republic's first independent President, was reportedly fleeing across the Caucasus region.
He was said by the independent news agency Interfax to have stopped in Azerbaijan before moving to Armenia with an escort of 60 armed guards.


The Politics of Finding Homosexuality Genetic
To the Editor:
"Are Some People Born Gay?" (Op-Ed, Dec. 17) by Michael Bailey and Richard Pillard presents the reader with an example of a disturbing trend in which investigators make stronger sociobiological claims in the popular press than are warranted by the data they present in scientific journals.
Here the authors state, "Science is rapidly converging on the conclusion that sexual orientation is innate." In support they cite their study of male twins.

Observer; Boat and Bridge People
Flu-smitten and oozing self-pity, I watched in deepening depression as the Washington Redskins disposed of a football team called the Atlanta Falcons.
The depression had nothing to do with the game, except that the game reminded me of a campaign afoot to rename the Redskins.
There is a nasty predicament created by humanity's insistence on constantly renaming everything at the same time its life span is constantly increasing.
As you age you don't want to be forever going back to elementary school to unlearn everything you learned as a tyke, yet this is what's necessary unless you're content to look hopelessly dotty.


Suffering From the Winter Blahs? A Bright Remedy Emerges.
IT doesn't get any worse than this.
The holidays are over.
The bright-colored lights seem sadly dated.
We get up in the dark and get home in the dark.
December's bills are arriving.
Days are a boring gray.
The leaves are gone.
The grass is brown.
Tax forms are coming.
Some bones complain, and the flu is everywhere.
It's six months until medical waste can be found on the beaches and five months until the next universal holiday (unless you're into white sales or that Pennsylvania groundhog).
In short, this is the time hereabouts for the doldrums, that endless period of murky puddles and sleepy cars, of cold fingers and street lights that sputter all day, of chest coughs and red noses.
Even in leap year, how can the five months from New Year's to Memorial Day be twice as long as the six months from July to Christmas?
Why are there only two seasons around here, a jiffy-quick summer of sunlight and wet-towel humidity and a slow-motion time when the rain is cold?


Record-Setting Dow Rally Ends on 1.35 Loss
The stock market's mighty winning streak finally ended yesterday, but just barely.
After 11 straight rises and 6 straight records, the Dow Jones industrial average inched downward for a change but hung on above 3,200.
At 3,200.13 at the close, it was off 1.35 points.
Trading was heavy, and while there appeared to be some weakness in large issues, the broad market continued to make strong advances.
The Nasdaq composite index rode to a new high of 597.90, up 5.25, and the American Stock Exchange's composite index also set a new record, up 0.44, to 399.27.


Tax Credit, or Health Discredit?
President Bush's advisers know he'd better come up with a domestic agenda for his State of the Union message Jan. 28.
They have evidently decided that the centerpiece should be health care reform.
The idea seems to be to provide tax credits, refundable as cash to the poor, to help families pay for health insurance.
If the plan stops there, it would be a fraud, bordering on public policy malpractice.


Careers; Real Estate May Require New Skills
IN spite of a recession that has been devastating to real estate, good job opportunities may eventually appear in real estate, said Lynn K. Cherney, a managing director of Ferguson Partners Ltd., a Chicago consulting firm that specializes in advising the real estate industry.
A recent study by the firm documents many changes in the industry and calls for finding a new approach to educate people going into real estate by the year 2000.
This education, the study says, should shift the emphasis away from finance and law in many real estate programs at the degree level of master of business administration.
"For the study we talked to real estate executives around the country as well as professors of real estate at many universities," she said.

Instrument Failure Halts Mapping of Venus
FLIGHT controllers have halted the radar mapping of Venus by the Magellan spacecraft while they examine its malfunctioning primary radio transmitter, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced yesterday.
Jim Doyle, a spokesman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said that mapping of the planet had been temporarily halted because of a component failure in the Magellan's main radio, the one capable of the high-speed transmissions necessary for communicating the tremendous amounts of imaging radar data for producing maps.
A secondary transmitter is sending engineering data on the spacecraft's health.


By Design; Daringly Veiled
There has always been something alluring about what is half revealed.
Evening clothes with bits of veiling here and there are perennial fashion favorites.
Designers know that a daringly deep decolletage, for instance, doesn't seem nearly as extreme when the plunge is filled in with a wisp of chiffon.
It makes it seem more discreet, although it isn't really.
And many women of a certain age have learned to appreciate the charm of a gown with shoulders, sleeves, even a back, of sheer net or chiffon.
It gives the illusion of bareness while masking any errant bumps and sags.

Auto Sales Fell 11.2% Last Year
United States auto sales ended 1991 on a positive note, but the upturn capped the weakest year since 1983 and one in which the industry performed far worse than many experts had predicted.
In addition, the Big Three auto makers relinquished a larger share of the American market to the Japanese.
Retail sales of domestically made cars and trucks rose 7.7 percent in the Dec. 21-31 period, largely because of strong pickup truck sales by Ford and Chevrolet, a year-end surge stimulated by incentives for buyers and anticipated by analysts.
That closed out a year in which sales of all vehicles sold in the United States dropped 11.2 percent from the year before.
For all of December, car and truck sales, domestic and foreign, declined 2.5 percent.

On Japan Leg of Journey, Bush's Stakes Are High
President Bush arrived in Japan today for four days of politically freighted trade talks, hoping to cap a four-nation sweep of the Western Pacific with concessions from Tokyo that will appear, at least, to prop up America's slumping economy.
Mr.
Bush brings his top advisers on the region, his commerce secretary and a platoon of 18 American corporate leaders with him to Osaka and Tokyo.


A Stunning Deal in the Style of Steinbrenner
George Steinbrenner, the old college hurdler, still hasn't cleared the hurdle that blocks his way to the meeting with Commissioner Fay Vincent that could restore him to his position as the man in charge of the Yankees.
But one week after the latest change in that office, Steinbrenner seems closer to running the club than at any time since his banishment from baseball 17 months ago.
No one accused Steinbrenner yesterday of ordering, approving or engineering the Yankees' signing of Danny Tartabull for more than $5 million a year, none of which he is permitted to do under his agreement with the commissioner.
But if someone dusted the deal with an ethereal fingerprinting kit, the principal owner's hands might be discovered all over it.


The Analyst Behind the Lowering of New York's Rating
For months, George W. Leung, vice president of state debt ratings for Moody's Investors Service Inc., has been worried about New York State's mounting budget deficit.
Yesterday, he acted on his concerns, recommending a lower rating for the state's appropriations-backed bonds, which represent about two-thirds of New York's $20.9 billion in debt.
After reviewing Mr.
Leung's analysis, Moody's public finance department concurred, issuing the lower rating.
Aaa Rating for the Rater
"This decision reflects the fact that time is running out because we are in the final quarter of the fiscal year," Mr.
Leung, who lives in South Orange, N.J., said in a telephone interview yesterday.
"Not only has the state not dealt with the problem, but the problem has grown."

SUNY Campus Delays Opening Over PCB Fears
Officials of the State University here announced today that they would delay the spring semester by two weeks and move 1,000 students out of dormitories after electrical transformers exploded or overheated last week, contaminating five buildings with PCB's.
Three dormitories and two academic buildings were contaminated after a car struck a utility pole on Dec. 29, causing a power surge that damaged the transformers.
In the transformer room of one academic building, the level of PCB's was 3,200 times the level considered safe under state guidelines, although some samples revealed no contamination in parts of the affected buildings.
Concern From Students
Twenty-two people, including seven students, were exposed to smoke-borne polychlorinated biphenyl particles.
They were treated at local hospitals and released.

Market Place; A Look Ahead For the Big Board
THE New York Stock Exchange kicked off the celebration of its bicentennial year yesterday with brave words from its chairman, William H. Donaldson, about becoming "the centerpiece of a global securities market."
But even as Mr.
Donaldson was re-emphasizing the Big Board's efforts to trade more foreign stocks, by allowing so-called world-class stocks to be traded without complying with American disclosure requirements, substantial opposition to the move was apparent.


Sports of The Times; Tartabull: Headlines Or Headache?
WHEN the Yankees finally blew the cobwebs off their bankbooks, they spent $25.5 million for the services of outfielder Danny Tartabull, a 29-year-old slugger, over the next five seasons.
But what will be the Yankees' return on this investment?
Maybe $25.5 million in headlines.
Maybe $25.5 million in headaches.
More likely a little of each.


The Perils of 'Lustration'
When Czechoslovaks swept away Communism in a velvet revolution, demonstrators chanted, "We are not like them." That proud distinction has been sadly blurred by a "lustration law" recently enacted by the Federal Assembly.
The term itself has unfortunate roots.
It derives from the Latin "lustrum," meaning a purifying sacrifice carried out at five-year intervals in Imperial Rome.
Coincidentally, the new law provides for a five-year ban on employment of former Communist officials in government or private managerial posts.


Cheaper, Faster Civil Justice
The spectacle of Chief Judge Sol Wachtler suing Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo over the state courts' budget would be funny if the system itself was not such a mindless, wasteful drain on tax dollars and litigants' assets.
Common sense could probably cut the cost of civil justice in half while speeding it up.


New Mayor Says Philadelphia Needs 'Change From Top to Bottom'


Shooting Death Is Latest Of Brighton Beach Terrors
When Leonid Vinokur was shot and killed early Sunday morning as he struggled with a man trying to mug his wife, his death on a graffiti-covered street in Brighton Beach became a symbol for what has gone wrong in the Brooklyn neighborhood.
As friends and family members gathered at his home yesterday to mourn his loss, residents of the predominantly Russian neighborhood spoke with anger against the muggers and drug addicts who control their streets and transform the daytime bustle of families and shoppers into a nighttime terror.


Russians Sniff at Beef, Miffing British Donors
There may be no meat in most Russian food stores, and prices for what little there is may be shooting skyward, but agricultural inspectors in Moscow turned up their noses at a shipment of 120 tons of British beef on Sunday, fearing that it was infected by "mad cow disease."
Instead, after hours of wrangling and telephone calls between Moscow, Brussels (headquarters of the European Community, which is providing the beef as part of an emergency food aid program for Moscow and St. Petersburg), and London, the Russians sent the Russian cargo plane carrying the shipment off to the Arctic Circle.


Dizzy Gillespie Stays Put, but Not for Long
Over the next month, Dizzy Gillespie will probably wade through "A Night in Tunisia" 50 more times.
Considering that he's been playing the tune twice a night, 300 nights a year for the last 50 or so years, another 50 times won't mean a thing.
The idea doesn't seem to bother him.
"Even 'Night in Tunisia,' doesn't bore me; I'm never bored," Mr.
Gillespie said on Sunday afternoon before rushing off to perform "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the Knicks game at Madison Square Garden.
"There's always a new way to play anything."


Seaver Is on Deck As Next Hall of Famer
There will be protest votes for PETE ROSE.
There will be sentimental votes for BILL MAZEROSKI.
Most important, though, there will in all likelihood be sufficient votes tonight for TOM SEAVER to be elected to baseball's Hall of Fame.
Seaver, the overpowering right-hander who led the Mets to their World Series triumph in 1969, is expected to earn admission to the Hall in his first year of eligibility with the official announcement of voting by the Baseball Writers Association of America.


CHRONICLE
EDWIN W. EDWARDS of Louisiana was the winner in November in the bitterly contested gubernatorial race against David Duke, and he apparently was a winner again on New Year's Eve, in a casino in Las Vegas, Nev.
According to Peter Nicholas, a reporter for The Times-Picayune in New Orleans, who stood near the Governor-elect and watched him for two hours at Caesars Palace, Mr.
Edwards left the craps table with a pile of chips worth $40,000 to $50,000 after a winning streak.
Mr.
Nicholas reported on the episode in his paper's Sunday issue.


F.D.A. SEEKS HALT IN BREAST IMPLANTS MADE OF SILICONE
The Food and Drug Administration today asked all doctors to stop inserting silicone breast implants, and all manufacturers to stop supplying them, because of new concerns about their safety.
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Dr.
David A. Kessler, said, "The F.D.A. cannot assure the safety of these devices at this time."
About two million American women have received the implants since they came on the market in the early 1960's, and about 100,000 to 150,000 are now put in every year, according to various estimates.
Advice for Implant Recipients
Addressing himself to these women, Dr.
Kessler said: "If you are not experiencing any difficulties, there is no need to consider removing the implants. However, if you are having symptoms you think may be related to your implants, you should see your doctor. And all women with implants should have periodic checkups for problems such as rupture."

Beaver Harris, 55, A Leading Drummer In Jazz Ensembles
William G. (Beaver) Harris, a jazz drummer who worked with the leading avant-gardists of the 1960's and led his own groups, died on Dec. 22 at his home in New York City.
He was 55 years old.
His wife, Glo, said he died of prostate cancer.
With avant-garde groups, Mr.
Harris's drumming was both swirling and muscular, waves of rhythm that gave propulsion and texture to the incantations of saxophonists like Albert Ayler and Archie Shepp.
But Mr.
Harris was also steeped in more traditional forms of jazz swing and in African and Caribbean rhythms.
His own group, the 360-Degree Music Experience, included a steel drummer along with saxophonists and the rhythm section, and moved freely between traditional and experimental jazz on its albums "From Ragtime to No Time" and "A Well Kept Secret."

Carnesecca Denies St. John's Involvement In Effort to Pay Player
Lou Carnesecca, the St.
John's head basketball coach, yesterday denied that a representative of St.
John's offered an athlete $30,000 if he would agreed to play for the school.
Dexter Cambridge, who played forward at the University of Texas before being declared ineligible this season, said someone who claimed to represent St.
John's offered him $30,000 in November 1989.

Lawyer Is Sentenced In Theft of Millions
A Manhattan lawyer who stole more than $7 million from the trust and escrow accounts of four clients and told them that he was dying of brain cancer was sentenced yesterday to 7 1/2 to 22 1/2 years in prison.
The 55-year-old lawyer, Steven J. Romer, maintained his innocence even as he was being sentenced yesterday, saying to the judge, "How can I show remorse when I'm innocent?"


New Effort Is Begun to Treat Boston Schools' Ills
Boston schools, plagued recently by racial turmoil, high dropout rates and stubborn budget deficits, began a new chapter today when a seven-member school board handpicked by Mayor Raymond L. Flynn officially replaced an elected body that had become synonymous with all that is thought wrong with Boston's schools.
The Mayor, who has called for major changes in the bureaucracy and in vocational, athletic and other programs, led a successful legislative effort last year to oust the members of the nation's oldest elected school board, which had been bickering for years over how to solve the system's problems, and to start over with an appointed body.


Flores to Wear 3 Helmets
Tom Flores, the Seattle Seahawks' president and general manager, took over as the team's coach today, succeeding Chuck Knox.
The announcement was expected since Friday, when Flores said that the University of Miami coach, Dennis Erickson, was not interested in taking the job.


Review/Music; Handel's First Operatic Success
How serious was opera seria?
Not very, according to the production of Handel's rarely staged opera "Agrippina," which opened on Saturday night at the Kennedy Center here.
The Washington Opera, having just recovered from a labor dispute with its orchestra, is offering the work in Italian with supertitles through Feb. 8.
"Agrippina" was Handel's first operatic success, written to a taut and witty libretto, receiving an extraordinary 27 performances in Venice in 1710.
One early report said the audience was "thunderstruck with the gravity and sublimity of his style" and hailed Handel as the "dear Saxon."
But this Michael Hampe production, first seen at the Cologne Opera, with additional direction in Washington by Florian-Malte Leibrecht, hardly left room for gravity or sublimity in its attempts to rekindle that popularity.
This tale of Empress Agrippina's maneuverings to get her son, Nerone, crowned Emperor of Rome featured an over-age gray-haired Nerone, who may not have fiddled, but who rode around on a gold hobbyhorse he occasionally treated like a love object.
It offered a Claudius who was a doddering Emperor and husband to Agrippina, half-fool and half-buffoon, and an Agrippina who could take time out from scheming to sneer at her enemy Poppea's taste in pearls.
One of the few aspects of the drama taken seriously was not in the libretto: several lingering incestuous kisses between plotting mother and infantile son.


Big Sports, Big Names, Big Money
DECADES ago, the sportswriter Grantland Rice declared that it was is not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game.
Today, it seems, it is not whether you play the game, but whether you sponsor one.
Eight executives from consumer-marketing giants and advertising agencies have been named to the annual list of the 100 most powerful people in sports, as compiled by The Sporting News, the weekly newspaper.
They outnumbered the players by 4 to 1; the two active athletes on the list -- both, by no coincidence, busy product endorsers -- were the basketball superstar Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and the golfer Jack Nicklaus.

The Advertising column in Business Day on Thursday misidentified the marketing company that imports Santa Margherita, the top-selling fine Italian wine in the United States.

Yankees Show a New Appetite by Snaring Tartabull
After two months of off-season lethargy and front-office chaos, the Yankees emerged yesterday with a $25.5 million free-agent outfielder and a suddenly voracious appetite for the trade market.
In a quick move that surprised fans and baseball people alike and reminded many people of George Steinbrenner's previous spending sprees, the Yankees signed slugger Danny Tartabull to a $25.5 million contract just after midnight yesterday.


President Is Appointed For Laura Ashley Unit
Laura Ashley Holdings P.L.C., the British apparel and home furnishings retailer, announced yesterday that Donna Moore, an executive with the Walt Disney Company, had been named president of the North American division, which represents about 40 percent of its business.
On Feb. 1, Ms.
Moore, 51, will take over a division still reeling from the dismissal of its president and most of its merchandisers shortly after Jim Maxmin was appointed chief executive last July.
The company made the moves amid a worldwide sales slump; sales declined 11 percent in the six months ended July 27.

Tax Revolt Brings Assessments Under Scrutiny
The Wilson place, a rambling array of gables and porches in this tiny and genteel summer colony, has become the unlikely centerpiece of a court battle that could force most Connecticut towns to review the way they assess property for real-estate taxes.
It was here, on the waters of Long Island Sound, that John C. Wilson 3d declared war against the tax assessor for the town of Old Saybrook, of which Fenwick is a borough, after his tax bill rose to $14,000 a year, from $4,000.


Broad Effort Under Way to Track Ozone Hole's Effects
DESPITE growing anxiety about the "ozone hole" that has begun appearing each year in the stratosphere above Antarctica, inhabitants of the white continent seem to be taking the resulting seasonal blasts of solar ultraviolet radiation in stride -- the wildlife, by producing protective pigments, and the humans, by wearing dark glasses, heavy clothing and sun-blocking lotions.
But while scientists say the dangers of exposure to intense ultraviolet are presently under control, the hazard is expected to increase sharply in the coming years, and experts have begun the most comprehensive environmental monitoring study of its kind to keep track of it.

RATING FOR CREDIT OF NEW YORK STATE DOWNGRADED AGAIN
Strongly censuring New York State's fiscal condition and the political paralysis in Albany, a major Wall Street credit agency today downgraded the rating on most of the state's debt, leaving New York with the second lowest rating of all states.
The new rating from Moody's Investors Service, which affects only the portion of the state's debt backed by annual legislative appropriations, is the lowest in the state's history and could mean that New York would have to pay higher interest rates when it borrows money in the future.
The lower rating places New York in a tie with Louisiana for the nation's second lowest credit rating, ahead of only Massachusetts.


Schools Vie in a Marketplace: More 'Choice' Can Mean Less
More than three years after Britain applied a free-market cure to its ailing schools, using the same ideas President Bush endorses for American education, its schools relish their growing authority but parents find they still do not have enough good schools to choose from.
The measures that President Bush prescribes for American educational ills are now the law in Britain: national curriculum standards, national tests and "choice," a voucher-like system in which money goes not to parents but to schools, based on the number of students they attract.

Overhaul of Dividend Tax Is Urged
Challenging a fundamental feature of the nation's tax law, the Treasury contended today that the double taxation of dividends -- first at the corporate level and then at the shareholder level -- distorts decision-making throughout the economy and thereby reduces output as much as $25 billion a year.
The Treasury proposed to "integrate" corporate and shareholder levies so earnings would no longer be taxed two or more times and suggested options to do so.

New Knicks Have Broken Their Old Habits
It seems like only last season when the Knicks often faltered in pressure situations.
In fact, it

But that was before John Starks's game and his confidence grew by leaps and bounds.
That was before Xavier McDaniel arrived to give New York another weapon to lift some of the late-game scoring burden from Patrick Ewing.
That was before Mark Jackson retooled his body and resurrected his career.
And that was before Pat Riley's coaching coaxed more out of the Knicks than most people expected.

The Cuba Missile Crisis: Kennedy Left a Loophole
Records of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, made publicly available today for the first time, suggest that the United States did not give Moscow any ironclad assurance that it would refrain from invading Cuba.
That disclosure comes as a surprise to some historians of the crisis, who believed that the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, had agreed to remove Soviet intermediate-range ballistic missiles from Cuba after receiving such an assurance.


2 Experts Say Women Who Run May Overtake Men
IF women's running performance continues to improve at the rate at which it has soared since the 1920's, the top women will soon be running as swiftly as the best men, and may even outrun them someday, two physiologists say.
The researchers suggest that elite female runners have been getting so much faster at such a rapid pace that they should be running marathons as quickly as men by 1998, and other shorter track events before the middle of the next century.

Most's Legs Amputated
JOHNNY MOST, the gravelly voiced Boston Celtics' radio announcer for 37 years, had both his legs amputated yesterday at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston because of a blood circulation problem.
Most, 68 years old, was reporting to be doing well following the surgery, which apparently was not an emergency procedure.


Randy Warshaw Taking Next Step, at the Joyce
Randy Warshaw would seem to be in an enviable position.
A former dancer with the popular and influential modern-dance choreographer Trisha Brown, he is now much in demand himself as a teacher of modern dance.
He has a vibrant seven-member company of his own that has performed at some of the major dance theaters in New York City and in Europe, and is establishing a second home in Miami, where he grew up.
And tonight, Mr.
Warshaw and his company open the three-week Altogether Different festival at the Joyce Theater, where the choreographer will present four new dances.
But at the age of 32, Mr.
Warshaw is also at a difficult point in his career.
He does not fit into the categories of hot new choreographic Wunderkind or acknowledged older master.
How do you sell a "middle-aged" choreographer?
Without the resources to hire a manager, he must devote a large chunk of time to the business of dance, losing the time and energy to focus on and create the new work that will help him develop both his audiences and an individual voice.
Paradoxically, too, there are fewer places in New York for him to perform.
His company has grown beyond the intimate loft theaters that dot Manhattan, but it is not ready for larger, more formal theaters.
All of which makes him just right for the Altogether Different festival.


Pirates Let Go Doughty
The Pittsburgh Pirates dismissed General Manager LARRY DOUGHTY yesterday despite the team's consecutive National League East titles.

Books of The Times; A 'Noises Off' Struggle in a Michael Frayn Novel
A Landing on the Sun By Michael Frayn 249 pages. Viking. $21.
Michael Frayn's characters are obsessed by order and control, dismayed by change, confusion and messy emotion.
The bumbling actors in his farcical play "Noises Off" struggle to continue playing their roles amid growing disorder on stage and off.
The prim, punctilious schoolmaster in the movie "Clockwise" misses his train and finds himself unable to extricate himself from a snowballing set of complications.
And the pompous professor in Mr.
Frayn's last novel, "The Trick of It," endeavors to make his life conform to the neat rules of literary theory.


North Korea Opens Up
North Korea has now told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it will shortly sign a nuclear safeguards accord.
Barring a last-minute hitch, Pyongyang will then open all nuclear facilities to inspection.
That's a giant step toward making the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free.
It may also help free North Korea from years of self-imposed isolation.
North Korea deeply resents its reputation as a harshly regimented, deprived country desperate to acquire nuclear arms to stave off collapse.
Yet only the North can dispel that impression -- by letting outsiders in to see for themselves, starting with international inspectors.


A Winning Year for Stock Funds
With a striking 8.7 percent price jump in the final 11 days of December, stock mutual funds posted a yearly gain of 36 percent in 1991, their best since 1967.
In contrast to 1990, when they lost 6.3 percent of their value, stock funds were brawny last year.
They out-performed two traditional competitors for small investors' money: fixed-income funds, which were up 18 percent, and money-market funds, up 5.6 percent.

And Once Again, Cuomo Won't Run
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo slammed the door today on an effort to make him a favorite-son candidate in the state's April 7 Democratic Presidential primary.
In a statement, Mr.
Cuomo said that "because of the current intensity of the state's fiscal difficulties and for the good of the party," he would not be a favorite-son candidate.
"The Governor is sending a clear signal, for the second time now, that he's not a candidate," Anne Crowley, the Governor's press secretary, said.
On Dec. 20, the Governor announced that he would not be a candidate for President.
Ms.
Crowley also said Mr.
Cuomo would ask that his name be removed from the Georgia Presidential primary ballot.
It had been included by Georgia officials when Mr.
Cuomo was considering a possible Presidential campaign.
On Sunday, a group of powerful New York Democratic county chairmen met in New York City to plan a Cuomo favorite-son candidacy.

Mr. Gingrich's Flawed Prison Math
The year has just begun, but Representative Newt Gingrich, second-ranking Republican in the House, may already have won the 1992 glibness award.
In a speech Friday attacking the "welfare state," he as much as blamed its soft-headed "value structure" for the crimes of a Georgian crack addict reported to have murdered his father, stepmother, sister and niece.
The killer had recently been paroled from a state prison.
A society ruled by sterner values, he suggested, would build enough prisons to lock up "every violent criminal in America." He said this could be achieved at "common-sense cost" by taking "three or four large military bases . . . we lease the land to every state in the country and we allow them to build prisons without having to worry about neighborhood problems." Construction could be carried out at bargain rates, he said, by National Guard engineering battalions.


When Bullets Pierce the Body, Mind and Soul
Nancy Jones's surgeon decided against removing the bullet that ripped through her left side, then lodged under her right collarbone after gunfire exploded in a Crown Heights deli where she was shopping.
Two years later, she is still carrying around the bullet -- as much in her mind as in her body.
In New York City, the toll of gunfire is not limited to the dead.
There are thousands more, about 4,500 in 1991, who are shot and survive.
In a city overwhelmed by violence -- and saturated with increasingly powerful guns -- they are unnoticed victims.
Whether paralyzed or simply grazed, they have similar stories to tell.


Unions Want McDonnell Deal Delay
Unions representing aerospace workers in California began a drive today to delay the McDonnell Douglas Corporation's plan to sell a 40 percent stake in its commercial aircraft business to Taiwan.
The unions are convinced that the deal will lead to the disappearance of jobs in the United States.
Officials of unions representing nearly 25,000 workers at McDonnell Douglas and the General Dynamics Corporation, a major subcontractor on McDonnell Douglas aircraft, said they would seek to find alternatives to the proposed $2 billion deal with the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation.
They said they were exploring possible investments in McDonnell Douglas by pension funds or by other American companies, although they said they had no specific prospects.


The Politics of Finding Homosexuality Genetic; Explain and Oppress
To the Editor:
The dual claim by Michael Bailey and Richard Pillard in "Are Some People Born Gay?"

Fort St. John Journal; For That Long Road to Alaska, a Long Birthday
Leslie Markham, a 79-year-old who lives in a trailer park here just off the Alaska Highway, recalls the day in 1942 during the road's construction when the muskeg "ate" one of the United States Army's Caterpillar tractors.
As the driver of a two-and-a-half-ton truck, Mr.

St. John's to Show How Good UConn Is
The Big East Conference season has already started for the Connecticut Huskies, but the serious mind games have just begun.
A victory over St.
John's on Tuesday night at Gampel Pavilion would give the Huskies a record of 11-0 and tie the second-best start in school history.
Another defeat to the Redmen, Connecticut's most troublesome conference opponent, could suddenly raise questions about a team ranked fifth in both major national polls.
Which explains the timing of the mind games.

Bridge
Some four decades ago, in "Moonraker," James Bond made use of a famous trick deal to get the better of the villainous Hugo Drax.
Convinced that Drax was cheating at the Blades club, he maneuvered to play against him for a very high stake indeed.
Apparently drunk, Bond switched decks in order to achieve the diagramed layout, which many will recognize.
He then opened seven clubs as South, and redoubled when Drax, as East, confidently doubled with his 31 high-card points, more than most players see in a bridge lifetime.


Trade Discord Persists as Bush Arrives in Japan
President Bush began his visit to Japan today in an atmosphere of contention and confusion, with negotiators for the United States and Japan in sharp disagreement over an American demand for Japan to buy more American automobiles and parts.
At issue are both the amount of cars and parts that Japanese auto makers and dealers would purchase and how the commitment would be described in light of Tokyo's insistence that purchases should be left up to Japanese businesses and not to the Government, officials on both sides said.

The Politics of Findin Homosexuality Genetic; What of Bisexuality?
To the Editor:
"Are Some People Born Gay" by Michael Bailey and Richard Pillard (Op-Ed, Dec. 17) falls into the trap the "civilized world" has set for anyone wishing to discuss this topic for 2,000 years.
The strange and grave reluctance to admit of bisexuality leads straights and gays alike to think of themselves as one or the other.
Only the ancient Greeks seemed to grasp the fundamental bisexuality of human nature without hypocrisy.

Study of H.I.V. Transmission at Birth
A STUDY of twins born to mothers infected with the virus that causes AIDS indicates that most infants who become infected acquire the virus during the birth process.
The researcher, Dr.
James J. Goedert of the National Institutes of Health, said the study confirmed other reports suggesting that mother-to-infant transmission of H.I.V. comes late in gestation, most likely at the time of birth.
"The observation that twins born first are at greatly increased risk of H.I.V. infection is intriguing," Dr.
Goedert said in an interview.
"It suggests that many infants remain uninfected until time of delivery, and that specific measures might prevent some of these infections."


A Rural South African Town Finds Black Boycott Costly
The stores in this small copper-mining town glitter with bright decorations, leftovers from Christmas, and with advertised post-season sales.
But a trickle of white customers is the only thing that has kept them from shutting down.

David H.

The Maxwell board, which filed for bankrutpcy court protection in the United States hoping to avoid a liquidiation of its main American-bassed assets -- Macmillan and the Official Airlines Guide -- saw most of its power transferred last week to a British-appointed administrator and an American examiner.

The murder of 48-year-old Leonid Vinokur, who was killed during a robbery as he returned home from a party with his wife at about 2 A.M., had quickly becoeme a public symbol of the problems of the predominantly Russian neighborhood, which has been plagued in recent months with drug activity and muggings.
Daniel Velasquez, 13 years old, of 2120 Randall Avenue in the Bronx, was arrested near his home at about 7 P.M., the police said.
They said his brother Carlos, 15, who lives at the same address, was taken into custody in New Jersey later last night.
The police said a third suspect is still being sought.

Bank Funds and C.D.'s Fall
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit continued to decline sharply in the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication that watches interest rates.
The lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve to help spur the economy has hurt consumers who rely on income from savings accounts and other relatively safe investments.
Banks are much slower to reduce interest they charge on loans and much faster in cutting the interest they offer depositors.  'Grim Picture'
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday: "Unfortunately for the consumer, although bank yields are dropping like rocks, borrowing rates still remain stubbornly high. For example, the prime rate has come down two percentage points in the past four months, from 8.50 percent to 6.50 percent, and average certificate of deposit yields have fallen by more than one percentage point, to the 3 percent to 4 percent range. But personal loan rates have declined by only one-half of 1 percent.

The manufacturer and retailer, based in Chicago, said it would combine its Hartmarx Specialty Stores Inc., the troubled parent of Wallach's, Baskin, Field Brothers and 26 others, with its Kuppenheimer Men's Clothiers, a discount chain.


Paramount Net Off 53%, But Outlook Improves
Paramount Communications yesterday reported financial results for 1991 that only the Addams Family could love: For the fiscal year that ended Oct. 31, profits were less than half the prior year's level, despite slightly higher revenues.
Martin S. Davis, Paramount's chairman and chief executive, said he believed that cost cutting and management changes last year will produce "markedly better results" in the current fiscal year.
Indeed, the first fiscal quarter is getting off to a powerful start with the popularity of the company's newest film releases, "The Addams Family" and the latest in the "Star Trek" saga.


Helping to Mate 2 Arts That Seemed as One
John Duffy has two favorite stories.
Each has a great deal to say about Meet the Composer, which Mr.
Duffy helped found in 1974 and which he now directs, and the Composer-Choreographer Collaboration Project, one of the organization's most popular programs.
The first story is about a little boy who stood up at a session in which a composer discussed his work with schoolchildren.
When had the composer been born? the child asked.
"And when did he die?" The second anecdote comes from a newspaper interview in which the composer Aaron Copland was asked why he never created dance music after "Appalachian Spring," the score for Martha Graham's work of the same name.
No one had asked him, the composer answered.
"That was kind of a jolt," Mr.
Duffy said.


California Olive Oil May Follow Wine In Upward Mobility
WHEN Californians talk about varietals, harvests and pressing these days, they may have olives, not grapes, in mind.
The same undaunted pioneer spirit that over the years has successfully conquered the gastronomic frontiers of wines, goat cheeses and sun-dried tomatoes is now tackling olive oil.


Digital Update for a 325-Year-Old Tool
A Silicon Valley company has embedded a computer chip and special circuitry in a carpenter's level, creating what one expert calls the first major advance in levels since 1666, when a Frenchman named Jean de Thevenot wrote down his ideas for a device based on an air bubble floating in a thin glass vial of liquid.
Wedge Innovations Inc. of San Jose, Calif., calls its tool the Pro Smartlevel.
It resembles a conventional carpenter's level except that the familiar bubble vial has been replaced by a "sensor module" containing a digital liquid-crystal display.
The user presses a button to see the degree of level, measured to an accuracy of one-tenth of a degree.
The Smartlevel can also measure angles, plumb and percent of slope, as well as degree of pitch measured in inches per foot.


Metaphor Post Filled
The International Business Machines Corporation said today that it had named Catherine Y. Selleck president of its Metaphor Computer Systems Inc. unit, based in Mountain View, Calif.
I.B.M. completed the acquisition of Metaphor in November.
Ms.
Selleck, 58 years old, was recently director of I.B.M.'s United States office and publishing systems division; she left I.B.M. to join Metaphor.


Spirit of Christmas Calls Again to Russians
The Christmas services were already well under way when a well-dressed woman squeezed tentatively into St.
Pimen's Church and looked around.
After a while she saw other worshipers buying candles and bought a handful herself, then followed the others to a candle stand.
Once her candles were burning, the woman sidled up to an old babushka whose nonstop devotions suggested she might be an authority, and quietly asked what, exactly, was happening.


Harazin Holds Meeting With Cone's Agent
AL HARAZIN, the general manager of the Mets, met yesterday with the agent for DAVID CONE in the first stage of negotiations on a potential longterm contract for the right-handed pitcher.
Harazin, who has said he is interested in signing Cone to a significant deal to avoid the danger of losing him to free agency after the 1992 season, held what he termed a preliminary meeting with STEVE FEHR in New York.
Harazin said no proposals were exchanged and characterized the discussion as exploratory in nature.


2d Guilty Plea In Abuse Case At St. John's
A former St.
John's University student pleaded guilty yesterday to sexually abusing a female student in a widely publicized case in which three other men had been acquitted.
The plea by the former student, 24-year-old Adam Gerber, came six days before the sodomy trial of the final defendant was to begin.
Mr.
Gerber is the second of the six defendants to plead guilty to sexually abusing the 23-year-old woman in a student house near the university's campus in Jamaica, Queens, in March 1990.


Nassau Beaches Are Latest Budget Victim
For decades workers from the Nassau County Health Department, traveling on foot and by motor launch, monitored the waters off some of Long Island's best-known beaches, assuring the public that they were safe for swimming and fishing.
But as part of sweeping budget cuts, the county today disbanded its two units monitoring ocean water quality, laid off its marine biologist and announced plans to turn the monitoring over to the operators of the beaches.


CHRONICLE
Honorary committees can be an eclectic lot.
Take, for example, the the list for the national campaign of the National Museum of the American Indian.
They include PRESIDENT BUSH, the four living former Presidents and their wives, KEVIN COSTNER, PAUL NEWMAN, ARNOLD PALMER, SARGENT SHRIVER, BARRY GOLDWATER, the writer OCTAVIO PAZ, Chancellor W. ANN REYNOLDS of the City University of New York, the Navajo Indian artist R. C. GORMAN and such Indian leaders as WILMA MANKILLER, chief of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, and LaDONNA HARRIS, president of Americans for Indian Opportunity.
"We went down a list of people in elected office, people who are active in the national Indian community and those in entertainment," said Representative BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, Democrat of Colorado, the only American Indian in Congress.
"We wanted high-profile people whose support would make it easier for us to raise money, and we chose them for their interest and sensitivity to Indian issues. My gosh, it's pretty hard to find a group with five living Presidents!"


2 Named to Bush's Campaign
After weeks of searching, President Bush's re-election campaign has filled vacancies in its public relations team, picking two longtime Congressional campaign aides as communications director and press secretary, campaign officials said today.
William J. Feltus 4th, staff director of the Senate Republican Conference who is a former associate of Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman, was named deputy campaign manager for communications.


U.S. Asks Japan to Wait On Reshaping U.N. Role
Bush Administration officials say that although they have agreed to Russia's assuming the permanent seat of the former Soviet Union on the United Nations Security Council, they do not see this as the right time to reshape the Council to allow Japan also to become a permanent member.
Administration officials say the message President Bush is conveying on his visit to Japan is that "in principle" Washington would be ready to support Japan's taking a permanent seat on the Security Council -- with veto powers equal to that of China, Russia, Britain, France and the United States -- but that such a move right now raises several legal, political and possibly even strategic problems from a United States point of view.


Dow Up 4.70 In Resuming Its Advance
After a one-day pause, the stock market resumed its daily record-setting yesterday, as investors, unable to find better returns elsewhere, continued to beat a path to equities.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.70 points, to 3,204.83, its seventh record in eight sessions.
Don Hays, director of investment strategy for Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, said he was amazed at the amount of money pouring out of bank certificates of deposit and money market funds that has found its way into this market.
"There are people who have never invested in stocks before, sticking their toes in," he said.


Seaver in Hall on a Truly Terrific Reception
The mechanics on the mound were straightforward and sound, the strategy a mix of sophistication and strength, the slider as precise as the fastball was powerful.
The demeanor was one of professional pride.
With Tom Seaver there was always something both elemental and authoritative about his talent, and so it seemed only appropriate that his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame last night was pure and definitive.
He received an unprecedented 98.8 percent of the ballots cast by members of the Baseball Writers Association of America.


Dance Artifacts Given To Missouri Society
Katherine Dunham has given a substantial portion of her collection of costumes, musical instruments, papers and films to the Missouri Historical Society in St.
Louis, where they will be housed in the society's new Library and Collections Center.
Ms.
Dunham, the internationally known dancer, choreographer and teacher, had stored the collection in the Dynamic Museum in East St.
Louis, Ill., which will remain open.
"During our years of touring," Ms.
Dunham said, "I have seen our trunks and boxes come out of storage, and with the costumes would drift a cloud of fine dust, mold and small moths. Now that our collections of art, videotape, film, costumes and manuscripts are safely in the custody of the Missouri Historical Society, I feel at ease. I am so happy that the major body of my life's work will receive the needed attention and will be available for future use."

Watchdog of the Parking World Seeks Tax Justice
The automobile is the uncrowned king of Manhattan.
As horrible as that might seem to you, it rings like a cash register in the agile mind of Jerome W. Gottesman, whose company owns or operates 77 parking lots and garages in the cluttered borough.
Just two things cloud his pleasantly congested horizon.
One is the stratospheric sales tax of 18 1/4 percent for parking in New York City.
The other, outlandish as it sounds, is government's laxness in collecting it.


Textron Lycoming In Pact With Rolls
Textron Lycoming Inc. has won a large subcontract for a new Rolls-Royce jet engine, that puts the small jet-engine maker in direct competition with Pratt &amp; Whitney Inc.
Lycoming has said it would build parts for the Tay 670, a Rolls-Royce turbofan engine.
The engine will be offered on several passenger jet models, including the proposed MD-95 by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
Neither Lycoming nor Rolls-Royce would estimate the value of the engine market for the MD-95.


Message to Albany: Bah-Humbug
It is a symptom of the times that New York State's credit rating has become not only a financial benchmark but a significant political one as well.
In the last two years, the state's credit rating has twice been downgraded because of the inability of its leaders to balance the budget.
In both cases, Wall Street rating agencies have made it clear that the dismal grades were given primarily for the state's political failure, not the sluggishness of its economy.

The Pop Life; Nirvana's 'Nevermind' Is No. 1
That crunching noise heard in record stores across the country last week was the sound of Nirvana's "Nevermind" (Geffen) stepping on just about every other album.
In a surprise move, the album, featuring adventurous college rock, bolted to the No. 1 spot on Billboard's album charts.
It sold 373,520 copies, according to Soundscan, Billboard's sales reporting system, bumping off, in order of appearance, Garth Brooks, Hammer and U2.
The big loser was Michael Jackson's "Dangerous," which dropped to No. 5 from No. 1.
Mr.
Jackson's decline actually began a week earlier, when his album was dislodged from the top spot by Mr.
Brooks's "Ropin' the Wind"; the change wasn't noted because Billboard didn't publish that week.


Sports of The Times; How Casey Predicted Tom Seaver
CASEY STENGEL used to tell us the Youth of America was coming.
It might be named Bearnarth or Hinsley or Powell or Wakefield, but it was coming.
All Casey could do was fight a rear-guard action, hold the fort with quips instead of a subma chine gun, wait for reinforcements, for players "who ain't failed yet," as Casey put it.


Where Bowman Goes, Intrigue Follows
When Jill Trenary announced last month that she was withdrawing from the national figure skating championships, she virtually cleared a path to the medal podium and the 1992 Albertville Olympics for Kristi Yamaguchi, Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, the medalists at last year's national and world championships.
But as this year's nationals opened tonight with the compulsory competition for dance teams, none of the other categories seemed so well-defined.
The men's competition may be especially intriguing.


New York May Sue Hertz for Surcharge
The executive director of New York State's Consumer Protection Board said yesterday that he would sue Hertz if the company did not rescind surcharges it has imposed on New York City residents who rent cars in the metropolitan area.
The executive director, Richard M. Kessel, said that the surcharges, which the Hertz Corporation began imposing on Jan. 2, violate a two-year-old provision of state law.
The law, he said, includes a clause that bars rental car companies from imposing any surcharges.

Heart Seizure or Panic Attack? Disorder Is a Terrifying Mimic
TERRIFIED that her sharp chest pains, profuse sweating, dizziness and a sense of impending doom meant she was having a heart attack, the woman went to a hospital emergency room.
Sent home again when cardiac tests there found no problem, the woman nevertheless was back in the emergency room four times in the next week with the same symptoms.
Over the next 10 years, she sought help in emergency rooms more than 50 times.
Six times, concerned doctors admitted her to the hospital's cardiac unit where, each time, tests found no heart problem.


Imelda Marcos Back on Center Stage
With the announcement by Imelda Marcos that she will run for President in the Philippine elections, the widow of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos added further uncertainty today to an already chaotic and unpredictable campaign.
Mrs.
Marcos, declaring that her candidacy was a reaction to the "sick and misdirected Government" of President Corazon C. Aquino, has undermined the presidential ambitions of several former Marcos family cronies and put new pressure on Mrs.
Aquino to reconsider her refusal to seek a second term.


Frank Yerby, Writer, 76, Is Dead; Novels of the South Sold Millions
Frank Yerby, who wrote 32 historical novels that sold in the millions, died on Nov. 29 in a hospital in Madrid.
He was 76 years old and lived in Madrid.
He died of heart failure, said his wife, Blanca.
She said she had kept news of her husband's death secret for five weeks at his request.


Hardships the Job Numbers Miss
The United States unemployment rate is officially 6.8 percent today.
But economists are now saying that this figure considerably underestimates the real number.
They warn that the current unemployment figure, influential in gauging the nation's economic health and determining what policies should be adopted to improve it, provides a false sense of the economy's strength and its potential for rebounding.
The problem: changes in the work force over the last 15 years that are not accounted for in calculating the rate.
One such change is the growing number of people on the edge of unemployment, counted as working but facing the hardships and insecurity of the jobless.
These people, probably numbering more than three million, include many temporary and freelance workers, older men pushed into lower-paying jobs, consultants and single mothers who cannot work as many hours as they would like.


2 Britons Buy The European
The European, the money-losing weekly newspaper started by Robert Maxwell, was sold on Monday to a company controlled by David and Frederick Barclay, twins who are two of the richest men in Britain.
The sale was announced by the court-appointed administrators of the late Mr.
Maxwell's bankrupt private companies, one of which owned The European.
The price was not disclosed.

Mr. Marino's Bad Budgeting
New York State's lowered credit rating hardly comes as a shock.
Gov.
Mario Cuomo has been warning about it and the rating agencies have been hinting at it.
Despite these alarms Senate Republicans, led by Ralph Marino, the majority leader, accused Mr.
Cuomo of crying wolf and refused to help resolve the state's latest budget impasse.
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the rating on most of New York's debt, leaving the state with the second-lowest rating, Baa1, in the country.
The least Mr.
Marino can do now is limit the damage by negotiating in good faith on a plan to close a gap of $875 million in this year's $30 billion budget.


Lewis M. Friedman, Cabaret Impresario, 47
Lewis Michael Friedman, a leading cabaret impresario in New York City in the 1970's and 80's, died on Friday at his home in Cazadero, Calif.
He was 47 years old.
He died of AIDS, said his mother, Kit Friedman of Dayton, Ohio.


Real Estate; A Gamble For an Urban Developer
"THE better mousetrap will always sell," says Ernest F. Belle Donne, whose company, Belle Donne &amp; Associates, was a major force in the transformation of Wilmington's skyline during the 1980's, beginning with its development of the Chase Manhattan Bank building on Interstate 95.
Now, with the city's parking authority, the company has begun work on what Mr.
Belle Donne calls the better mousetrap -- a $10 million parking and retail complex that will serve as the base for a $20 million office building.


Japanese Visit, on the Surface: Jovial Bush, Friendly Crowds
He is about to engage the Japanese Government in a titanic struggle over his nation's economic future.
But on Tuesday, opening a four-day state visit to Japan to discuss trade and security issues, President Bush was trying his utmost to build bridges, not wreck them.
He played tourist at an ancient palace.
He engaged an astonished circle of middle-aged Japanese men in a slightly goofy, highly telegenic game in which a leather ball is kicked around.
He waxed enthusiastic to college students about brotherhood and understanding.
He undertook that most American of political tasks -- a ribbon cutting at a new store.


Books of The Times; The Bill of Rights, Stretching and Growing
A People's Charter  The Pursuit of Rights in America  By James MacGregor Burns and Stewart Burns  577 pages.
Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
In a majestic chronicle that covers history, political science and the philosophy behind the social contract between citizen and government, "A People's Charter" celebrates and extends the Bill of Rights toward the dawn of the next century.
It's a bold and path-breaking book that brings the first 10 Amendments down to earth and, at the same time, reaches for the moon in its idealism.


60-Minute Gourmet
AS a fisherman, I am always looking for new ways to prepare my catch.
With cod season at hand, I have been experimenting with that firm-fleshed, mild-tasting fish.
Cod is good poached and served with a hollandaise sauce.
A classic French preparation for cod is cabillaud etuve a la creme.
The fillet is browned in butter, then braised in cream.
Cod can also be broiled or roasted, but it has so little moisture that dryness is always a risk.
With the recipe here, I took the safe, though delicious, road: using cod in a fish chowder.
I have used cod in bouillabaisse many times and it works splendidly.
This recipe is less time-consuming than bouillabaisse, yet wonderfully flavorful.
The recipe calls for a second fish as well.
You may use halibut, another firm, lean fish, or red snapper, fluke or any other mild white-fleshed fish.


Experts Call Georgia's Future Unclear
American and British experts on the Caucasus and the former Soviet Union voiced uncertainty yesterday about the degree of popular support for the opposition forces that have taken power in Tbilisi, Georgia.
In telephone interviews, the experts also expressed uncertainty about Georgia's future, and they emphasized present and potential divisions within the opposition, which has formed a military council to wield authority.


Linking Bits of Leftover Land To Put Parks Closer to Home
In a movement that is changing the way American parks are created and used, an open-space conservation drive in the New York region and across the country is stitching together thousands of acres of new parkland from abandoned and unused areas.
This "greenway" movement is fighting to save undeveloped and overlooked corners of suburban areas for recreation and wildlife preservation.
The results are not like the big, formal parks created for 19th-century cities or the vast wilderness National Park preserves created shortly afterward.
They are networks of trails connecting existing parks, riverways and historic sites. 'Parks of the Future'
"These are the parks of the future, because suburbanization is the future," said James C. Amon, director of the New Jersey's Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission.
"Instead of looking at parks as distant preserves to be visited on special occasions, we are integrating parks right into our own backyards and into our daily lives."

McDonnell Sale Delay
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation said today that the closing of its deal to sell 40 percent of its commercial aircraft business to the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation would be delayed beyond its target date of Jan. 31.
Michael Burch, a McDonnell spokesman, said the closing would be pushed back "weeks or maybe months" as Taiwan Aerospace analyzed McDonnell's books.
Executives from Taiwan arrived at Douglas Aircraft's commercial jet plant in Long Beach, Calif., today to being examining the business.

He batted .310 with 18 home runs and 74 runs batted in. (AP)


AID PANEL STALLS ON FORMER SOVIETS
Just 15 days before the Washington Coordinating Conference on aid to the former Soviet republics is scheduled to begin, American and foreign diplomats are still trying to assemble a detailed agenda, a complete list of participants and even a consensus on what aid should be included.
Born of a last-moment insert in a speech on Dec. 12 by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, the conference is seen by American officials as a way to prevent countries from duplicative efforts and insure that no region of the former Soviet Union is neglected.


Bell Atlantic To Cut Profits
The Bell Atlantic Corporation, one of the largest of the regional Bell operating companies, plans to take a $1.55 billion one-time charge for the year just ended to meet new suggested accounting rules for retirees' health costs.
The charge does not mean that Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, must set aside new money, so it will not affect cash flow or dividend payments.


New Jails Breaking Down Old Habits
In the piney woods just outside this small town is a county jail that bears little likeness to the noisy, graffiti-adorned and violent institutions that have become common around the country.
The Horry County jail here, the J. Reuben Long Detention Center, houses a mix of people, from those accused of minor crimes to convicted murderers, yet all blend in a place that is quiet, clean and safe and as sparkling today as it was when it opened two years ago.


Market Place; Junk-Bond and Mark Funds Excel
Last year was a strong one for bond funds, particularly for those invested in high-yield junk bonds.
In the fourth quarter, however, the best-performing funds were those that invested in the Deutsche mark and in long-term domestic securities.
Figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services showed that the year's top-performing bond funds had annual returns exceeding 60 percent.
The best-performing fund was the Dean Witter High Yield Fund, with a 67.21 percent return, followed by the Liberty High Income Bond Fund, which returned 60.5 percent.


Study Points to Increase In Tolerance of Ethnicity
Tolerance of ethnicity seems to be rising and anti-Semitism dropping, according to a study of polls conducted over several years by seven national polling organizations in which people were asked to describe or rank different ethnic groups.
The study was made public yesterday.
The new analysis of existing polling data, sponsored by the American Jewish Committee, provides intriguing glimpses of the images, social standing and conflicts that different ethnic groups are generally perceived to have.


Miller Tinkering With Lite Spots
The Miller Brewing Company is tinkering with the much-talked-about advertising campaign for Miller Lite, adding a jingle to television commercials.
Since the campaign, which carries the theme "It's it and that's that," was introduced in July, opinion has been sharply divided over its creativity and effectiveness.
Miller executives continue to express satisfaction with the campaign, which was created by the Leo Burnett Company after Lite's longtime agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., was dismissed.

U.N.'s Yugoslavia Envoy Says Rising War-Weariness Led to the Cease-Fire
Cyrus R. Vance, the special United Nations envoy for Yugoslavia, said yesterday that he believed that general war weariness was the primary factor leading to the cease-fire accord that took hold there under his supervision last Friday evening.
In an interview in New York, he said that while he was dismayed by the incident yesterday in which a Yugoslav Air Force jet shot down a helicopter, killing five European monitors, he did not think this could cause hostilities to resume between Serbs and Croats.

JAPAN ANNOUNCES A HOST OF STEPS TO AID U.S. TRADE
Seeking to demonstrate its willingness to take concrete steps to reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the Japanese Government late on Tuesday announced a host of incentives to make it easier for American companies to export their goods.
The move came on the first day of President Bush's visit here.
Some measures had been announced earlier, while some merely expanded on existing programs.


Blackout in Capital Is Linked To an Irregular Power Burst
The Potomac Electric Power Company said today that much of the nation's capital lost electricity on Monday evening because of an irregular burst of power between two high-voltage cables and the resulting automatic shutdown of both the cables and a nearby power plant.

5 European Observers Are Killed As Yugoslav Troops Down Copter
Five European Community military observers were killed today when their helicopter was rocketed by a Yugoslav Army MIG fighter over a rural area about 30 miles north of Croatia's capital, Zagreb, Croatian officials said.
Some seven hours after the incident, the most flagrant violation of the four-day-old United Nations inspired cease-fire, the Serbian authorities in Belgrade admitted that the helicopter had been brought down by a plane from the pro-Serbian Yugoslav Army and promised to punish those involved.


U.S. Auditors Are Criticized on Use of Contractors
Federal watchdog agencies are delegating too much of their work to private contractors, resulting in conflicts of interest and compromising Government accountability and efficiency, according to a Senate subcommittee staff report.
The report, by the majority staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Federal Services, Post Office and Civil Service, says that inspectors general, the independent offices in Government agencies assigned to monitor activities, use contractors for many jobs they ought to do themselves.


Cut in Rates Gives Banks a Windfall
To the Editor:
The financial and news media sounded the Dec. 20 lowering of the discount rate from 4.5 percent to 3.5 percent and a moving of the prime rate from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent (front page, Dec. 21).
You report that this full-point cut in the rate charged on loans to banks brings the discount rate to its lowest in 27 years.
But you did not report that 27 years ago the
prime
rate was 4.5 percent: banks now enjoy a 200 percent increase in their margin over the discount rate.


Serving Workers on the Road With Data to Go
Just as cellular telephone technology vaulted car telephones from rare curiosities to mass-market products, a new generation of nationwide data networks is making it possible for both large and small companies to extend their office computer systems to employees on the road.
Mastercard International plans to use such a network for wireless credit-card verification terminals at county fairs or merchants' sidewalk kiosks.
Otis Elevator uses a mobile data network to dispatch repair technicians around the country from a single office in Connecticut and to receive back their reports.
Another emerging group of converts to the mobile office: insurance claims adjusters, who shuttle between the scenes of accidents and disasters, trying to estimate the costs of repairing a car or replacing a roof.


B. &amp; W. Tobacco Cuts an Agency
The Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation has unexpectedly dismissed one of its three advertising agencies, Geer, DuBois Inc., which had an estimated $30 million in billings.
The dismissal, effective immediately, involves creative work on the company's Capri, Raleigh and Raleigh Extra brands, as well as the media-buying services that the agency had provided in the United States for all B. &amp; W. brands, which include Kool, Viceroy and Bel Air.

The Raychem Corporation said the Taliq Corporation, a unit based in Sunnyvale, Calif., that manufactures special windows using liquid crystal technology, would be closed.
The move is expected to occur over the next few months and will affect all of Taliq's 95 employees.
Raychem's fiscal second-quarter results are expected to include a $8 million charge to discontinue Taliq's operations, Raychem said.
"Although the technology is promising, Taliq failed to achieve profitability in its basic product lines," said Raymond J. Sims, the vice president and treasurer.

Kurt H. Weil, a figure in early German aviation history and professor emeritus at Stevens Institute of Technology, died last Thursday at his home in Montclair, N.J.
He was 96 years old.

There he worked, among other things, on the transport Ju-52, the all-metal, multi-engine aircraft incorporating the design concept of the modern, economical airliner.


Quotation of the Day
"These are the parks of the future because suburbanization is the future.

Surgery for Gaston
The Toronto Blue Jays manager, CITO GASTON, who missed 33 games during the 1991 season with a back injury, underwent successful surgery on his lower spine yesterday.
Gaston, 47, who had suffered from a compressed nerve root at the fifth lumbar, had the compression relieved and "will be ready to function fully in time for the opening of spring training" in seven weeks time, according to a statement from the doctors.
The surgery was performed at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto by Dr.

ARABS SAY TALKS ON MIDEAST PEACE CAN NOW RESUME
Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian and Palestinian negotiators indicated today that they were prepared to resume peace talks with Israel in Washington now that the United Nations had condemned the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for its planned deportation of 12 Palestinians.
Israel, for its part, bitterly criticized the United States for voting in favor of the Security Council resolution, which the Arab delegations had in effect made a condition for the resumption of negotiations.

Creating a Pleasant Stop On the Journey to Death
For the last four years, the designers of the Bailey-Boushay House have been wondering precisely how to create a large home in which somebody was going to die about every 30 hours.
Of course, it would need emergency equipment and the tools of hospitals and hospices, as well as places to cry and to say goodbye.
But the designers wanted something more.

An article on the Media Business page on Monday about magazine audio cassettes referred incorrectly in some editions to a radio program being produced by Newsweek and The Associated Press.

Brooklyn Slaying May Be 6th In Mob Families' 2-Month Feud
One man was gunned down and another wounded yesterday in Brooklyn in what New York City law-enforcement officials described as the continuation of a feud between two organized-crime families.
The police identified the dead man as Nicholas P. Grancio, 62 years old, of 1756 East 23d Street in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
A law-enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Mr.
Grancio was shot in the head as he sat in a car at the intersection of McDonald Avenue and Avenue U in Gravesend.
He was also known as Nicky Black, and was believed to be a captain in the Colombo crime family, the official said.


DAHMER CHANGES HIS PLEA TO GUILTY
Defense lawyers for Jeffrey L. Dahmer, who is charged with killing and dismembering 15 boys and young men in his apartment, plan to change his plea from not guilty to guilty, a move that would still allow a jury to find he was insane and have him hospitalized rather than imprisoned.
Mr.
Dahmer's chief defense lawyer, Gerald P. Boyle, sent a letter last week to Judge Laurence C. Gram Jr. of Milwaukee County Criminal Court stating his intention to enter a new plea of guilt by reason of insanity.


Air Force Joins Protest Of Contract
The Air Force, in effect acknowledging that it was too hasty in awarding a billion-dollar computer contract last month, is joining with protesters in asking that the award be canceled and reopened for bidding, an official of one of the original winners said today.
Judy Bitterli, director of corporate sales for the Compuadd Corporation of Austin, said a joint motion to dismiss the award is expected to be signed Wednesday by an administrative judge with the General Service Administration Board of Contract Appeals in Washington.


Teen-Agers Charged in Attack Released for a Lack of Evidence
Saying they lacked sufficient evidence to file charges, the authorities yesterday released 12 of 23 Brooklyn teen-agers who had been accused in a gang attack on three young men in lower Manhattan on Sunday evening.
Four youths accused of leading the attack were arraigned yesterday in Manhattan Criminal Court on robbery and attempted-robbery charges, said Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office.
Seven others were sent to Family Court to face charges.

THE PARKS OF THE FUTURE

Joe Sapora, 87, Wrestling Standout And College Coach
Joe Sapora, the wiry collegiate wrestling champion who coached the sport at City College from 1932 to 1968 and helped steer Henry Wittenberg to the heavyweight gold medal in the 1948 Olympics, died Monday at Ormond Beach Memorial Hospital in Florida.
He was 87 years old and lived in Daytona Beach.
His wife, Marguerite, said he died of pneumonia.
During his 36 years at City College, Mr.
Sapora, who was a professor of physical education, turned out his share of champions.
Although Mr.
Wittenberg was undoubtedly the best, Mr.
Sapora's greatest accomplishment as a coach may have been when Jacob Twersky, a blind wrestler, made it to the collegiate finals in 1942.


Broncos' Mecklenburg Hasn't Given an Inch
Perhaps it's just the slow passage of time, but it sometimes seems as if Karl Mecklenburg has been playing professional football for decades, enduring one game after another, one season after another, always at the center of the Denver Broncos' defense and always rising for one more play.
He's been around since leather helmets, hasn't he?

Some Tips on Leadership for Coleman
Some day, perhaps when Derrick Coleman is authoring his autobiography, a la Charles Barkley, he will be asked to look back at his early, turbulent days under Coach Bill Fitch.
The chapter will no doubt be titled: "It Was All His Fault."
When Fitch is gone from the Nets, he will be remembered by Coleman as his first pro coach and one he couldn't wait to get rid of.
The two don't mix, and haven't since Coleman arrived last season.
But Coleman should not for a second delude himself into thinking that Fitch is his only problem, or his biggest.
With enormous talent, competitive fire plus a rare and special ability to make everyone around him better players, Coleman has a chance to be an N.B.A. franchise player in the truest sense.
With that role will come responsibility and leverage.


New Study Strongly Links Passive Smoking and Cancer
A THREE-YEAR study of nonsmoking women in five metropolitan areas has fortified earlier conclusions that secondhand smoke increases a spouse's risk of lung cancer.
Taking into account other possible influences on a woman's cancer risk, the study, the largest of its kind, found a 30 percent higher risk of lung cancer if the women's husbands smoked, a risk that rose with the number of cigarettes and years of exposure.

The Lark Quartet was just over Newfoundland en route to St.
Petersburg for the Shostakovich International String Quartet Competition when EVA GRUESSER, the first violinist, discovered that she had left her scores at home.
What to do?
"I was in a spasm of horror and anxiety," Ms.
Gruesser said yesterday by telephone from a rehearsal in Manhattan.
"A musician without music is not worth much." Her husband, ROHAN SMITH, also a violinist, found her scores, all Shostakovich and Beethoven quartets, sitting on a music stand at their home in New York, and tried to send them to Russia by fax.

Better Than Perfect: Wines That 'Excite'
IT'S list-making time.
The 10 most interesting people of 1991, the one most interesting person of 1991 (Man of the Year, naturally), the 10 best athletes of 1991, the 10 most interesting news stories of the year and, who knows, probably, somewhere, the 10 dullest stories of the year.
Wine, which thrives on lists, has its own year-end compilation: The Wine Spectator's top 100.
Lists like this one fill in the time between the arrival of the Beaujolais nouveaux in November and the announcement of the opening prices of the latest Bordeaux vintage in the early spring.
They are, one might say, the hot stove league of wine.


Public &amp; Private; Women In Combat
Videotape confers a peculiar kind of immortality.
The parents of Maj.
Marie Rossi can watch their daughter, alive as anything, tell the world how she feels about what she does.
In a jaunty camouflage hat, she stands in the desert and tells the cameras what some of us were saying in print: that national defense is sex-blind.
"What I am doing is no greater or less than the man who is flying next to me," she said, as pundits were opining the same on the home front.
But we were only operating word processors while Major Rossi was flying a Chinook chopper for the Army, and the day after the cease-fire the chopper crashed.
She was buried in Arlington Cemetery, where a memorial to women in America's wars is planned.
Rewind.
Play.
"We thought it was pretty neat that three women were going to be across the border before the rest of the battalion," Major Rossi tells CNN, forever upbeat.


National Is Pledged 2,000-Work Collection
Two New York collectors who live modestly and have spent virtually all of their money on Minimalist, Conceptual and post-1960's art have pledged the more than 2,000 paintings, sculptures and drawings they have acquired over three decades to the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
"We liked the idea of giving art to our nation," said Herbert Vogel, 69 years old, a retired postal clerk.
His wife, Dorothy, 56 years old, a retired reference librarian for the Brooklyn Public Library, added, "We spent our honeymoon in Washington, and I got my first art lesson at the National Gallery."


Bristol-Myers's Drug Prices Are Cut for Health Programs
Acting at a time when Congressional drug-industry critics are demanding Government regulation of pharmaceutical prices, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company announced yesterday that it was reducing its prices by $20 million to Federal programs for veterans, the military and the Public Health Service, and by $60 million for the Federal-state Medicaid program for the poor.
Bristol-Myers Squibb said it was the first drug company to make reductions for the Federal programs that were as low as, or lower than, rebates that all drug companies are now required to give to state-run Medicaid programs.


Georgia's Democracy, Hijacked Again
Democracy has now suffered a double blow in the republic of Georgia.
No sooner had Zviad Gamsakhurdia been elected President than he began acting like a dictator.
Now he has been driven from his bunker by a bloody palace coup.
For democracy to recover, it's essential for Georgia's new leaders to hold genuinely free elections, and soon.
Then will come the harder steps: tolerating opponents, including supporters of Mr.
Gamsakhurdia . . . fostering a free press . . . protecting the rights of non-Georgians . . . obeying the law and enforcing it fairly.


Ferraro's Four Goals Put Icing on the Day
When Ray Ferraro of the Islanders was named to the Wales Conference All-Star team this afternoon, it seemed like a routine, minor honor.
Every team has to have at least one representative, and Ferraro is a respectable and respected veteran.
He is one of the better players on a struggling team and he has no previous All-Star experience.
So it seemed like a nice gesture.


The Steinbrenner Ban Resembles a Farce
On the eve of what George Steinbrenner hopes will be his greatest triumph of all -- winning the right to run the Yankees again -- it seems inconceivable that the Yankee owner would flirt with disaster.
So the question must be asked: Why would Steinbrenner and his allies in the Yankees' hierarchy begin scattering clues galore that the owner, in defiance of an agreement that bars his activities in the day-to-day operations of the team, was operating as if it were June 1990 and he was back wheeling and dealing.
And if the signs are true, if Steinbrenner is indeed back in business without ever having had to wait for a pardon, what will Commissioner Fay Vincent do about it?


Calcutta Journal; On Meanest of Streets, Salvaging Useful Lives
As night dissolves, the sidewalks and gutters of this decayed city stir with life.
From hovels of burlap and cardboard emerge naked children trailing their mothers, who wrap their soiled saris more snuggly against the morning chill.

Two Assistant Coaches Dismissed by Giants
When the Giants' disappointing season ended almost three weeks ago, Coach Ray Handley intimated he would shake up his staff.
The shake-up started yesterday when the Giants released Ron Erhardt and Mike Pope, two longtime assistants on offense, and Handley left the door open for more changes.
Erhardt had been a Giant coach for 10 seasons, Pope for nine.
Each had a year remaining on a two-year contract.


Right-Hand Ford Model Set for Japan
The Ford Motor Company, in a move intended to increase the appeal of its vehicles to the Japanese, said today that it would begin building right-hand-drive Ford Probe sporty coupes for export to Japan and Britain.
This will be Ford's first model adapted specifically for sale in Japan.
It will take the company 20 months to re-engineer the car, which will be produced at the Mazda Motor Corporation's Flat Rock, Mich. plant, said Alex J. Trotman, executive vice president in charge of North American operations.
Ford owns 25 percent of Mazda.

From "The Joy of Cooking" to "The Exotic Foods of Mauritius," tomes fill this narrow shop off Portobello Road in west London.
The owner, Heidi Lascelles, said she has one of the largest selection of cookbooks for sale in the world.
She certainly is in the running for most per square foot.

Japan's Consumers Are Proud to Buy Japanese; Showroom Showdown
To the Editor:
There in our driveway sits a testament to unpatriotism.
Gleaming garnet color, moon roof, leather, compact disk player.
Everything about it says "made in Japan." We set out to buy another Ford.
We had two last week.
We really do hate the trade deficit.
We really do want to buy American (and did so three years ago with the Fords after years of Volvos, Volkswagens, even some beaten up but great old Jaguars).

Moving to Notre Dame
RICK MINTER, the architect of Ball State's highly respected defense, was named defensive football coordinator at Notre Dame yesterday.
Minter, 37 years old, will replace GARY DARNELL, who left the Irish after two seasons to become assistant head coach at Texas under the new coach, JOHN MACKOVIC.


Obession Over Witt
He is a 47-year-old man who lives with his mother.
She thinks he's mentally ill, as did a psychiatrist who once examined him and decided he was a paranoid schizophrenic.
Indeed, HARRY VELTMAN seems to have developed a full-blown obsession with the former Olympic champion KATARINA WITT, so much so that he was arrested in California last month and charged with sending her obscene and threatening letters.
Federal agents said they made the arrest at the time because they were afraid Weltman would harm Witt at an ice show the next day.


Trenton Tax-Bill Holdout Threatens Assembly Plan
Assembly Democrats have scheduled a final vote on Wednesday on their $2.8-billion tax rollback, but the outlook for its passage is clouded by a Paterson Democrat who refuses to back any rollback unless his own, competing package is also approved.
The Paterson legislator, Assemblyman William J. Pascrell Jr., may hold the critical 41st vote the Democrats will need to pass the rollback, and he is using it to hold the legislation hostage until he gets his way.


Sears Cuts Jobs In Modernizing
In a continuing effort to cut costs, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company said yesterday that it was spending $60 million for 28,000 computerized cash registers.
The move would eliminate 1,000 full-time non-sales jobs and 5,900 part-time clerical jobs by the end of the first quarter in March, Sears said.
The job cuts will reduce operating expenses by about $50 million a year beginning in 1992, Sears said.


Health-Food Supermarkets? Why, Yes. It's Only Natural.
WHEN Fresh Fields opened its first "healthy food supermarket" in a Washington suburb last summer, the tight-knit natural foods industry was aghast.
What interlopers dared enter a business that had, until that moment, been peopled exclusively by a health-food counterculture?
Who were these mainstream entrepreneurs -- Leo Kahn, the former owner of a chain of conventional supermarkets, Mark Ordan, an investment banker, and Jack Murphy, who had worked in the supermarket industry -- with the chutzpah to treat the selling of organic food, natural sugars, whole grains, pure water, and the concepts of saving the dolphins, saving the whales, saving the planet as a pure business opportunity?
The industry is still abuzz as the company plans to open stores No. 3 and No. 4 this year.


An American Express Plan
The American Express Publishing Corporation has reorganized its magazines, the company announced Monday.
Travel &amp; Leisure, the company's most widely circulated magazine, will stand alone, while the other five -- Atlanta, D, Departures, Food &amp; Wine and L.A.
Style -- will be grouped together.
New York Woman, a five-year-old magazine that has been hit particularly hard by declining advertising revenues, has been for sale since November and is not included in the reorganization.


Manhattan Assemblyman Wins Ways and Means Chairmanship
Capping a brief but intense power struggle within the Democratic-led State Assembly, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan has been chosen by Speaker Saul Weprin for the powerful position of Ways and Means Committee chairman, legislative officials said tonight.
The chairmanship, which involves a major role in negotiations over the state's budget, had been held by Mr.
Weprin, a Queens Democrat who rose last month to the Speaker's chair after the conviction of the chamber's leader, Mel Miller, on Federal fraud charges.

Yankees Stay Active by Acquiring Gallego
The Yankees continued reaching into their wallets, shuffling their lineup and refining their approach to rebuilding yesterday when they signed a free-agent infielder, Mike Gallego, to a guaranteed three-year, $5.1 million contract.
After months of disarray in the front office and promises that the club would proceed with its young players, the Yankees, who signed Danny Tartabull on Monday, have done an about-face and signed two free agents for $30 million in two days.


Fury and Protests Erupt in Russia As Price Rises Strain Consumers
The first expressions of angry protest were reported today among the battered consumers of Russia as they tried to cope with drastically rising food prices.
The incidents seemed more the exception than the rule thus far, as Russia and its neighbors adjusted warily but peacefully to the unpredictable situation.
Price controls on most basic goods were ended last week in the hope of engendering free-market forces of supply and demand, but the effects thus far have proved uncertain at best.

"The Steamtown Steamroller" (Topics of The Times, Dec. 17) and a Nov. 23 news article on the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pa., which is transforming an abandoned railroad yard into a tourist attraction, ignore knowledgeable sources who would give quite a different picture from your reports.


ARABS SAY TALKS ON MIDEAST PEACE CAN NOW RESUME
Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian and Palestinian negotiators indicated today that they were prepared to resume peace talks with Israel in Washington now that the United Nations had condemned the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for its planned deportation of 12 Palestinians.
Israel, for its part, bitterly criticized the United States for voting in favor of the Security Council resolution, which the Arab delegations had in effect made a condition for the resumption of negotiations.


Bias Thrives In a Vacuum
Some people have a definite opinion about Wisian-Americans.
The trouble is: Wisians are a fictitious group, added by poll takers to a list of ethnic groups in order to test the respondents in a study of ethnic images in the United States.


Microwave Cooking
AFTER the holidays, I feel like a beached whale -- overweight and lethargic, not very interested in cooking.
Enter rapidly prepared fish dishes from the microwave.
They are good for the health and diet, take a minimum of time to prepare and are interesting enough to serve at an informal meal for friends.
The Chinese-style fish fillets use a lot of ingredients, but since they're all thrown together at the same time, the preparation is easy.
Tuna with tomatoes is a truly minimal recipe and would go nicely with spaghettini.
Scrod with clams Livornese takes advantage of the fact that in a microwave oven, the inner portion of the pan cooks more rapidly than the outer portion.
The scrod will still be moist when the clams that surround it open.
The fish with vegetables also benefits from this unevenness.

Those quaint things you were supposed to count, and by eliminating 3,500, lose a pound?
In the last few years, toting up calories has fallen out of favor.
These days, the word is fat.
Eliminate it or sharply reduce it, the thinking goes, and you will lose weight.
By the new orthodoxy, there is no need even to think about calories.


For Pet Lovers, a Tragedy Relived
Sylvia Strauss sat in a Brooklyn courtroom yesterday and fretted for her husband and son, who are charged with turning a Long Island pet cemetery into a hellish site of mass graves, broken-down equipment and moldering animal corpses.
Try as she might, she couldn't avoid the low mutters and pointed stares of the clutch of angry pet owners across the aisle, who have done their best to make life miserable for her family since their arrests last spring.


Cleared to Play, Coleman Practices
Derrick Coleman was back from the doctors and apparently out of Bill Fitch's doghouse today.
Coleman, the Nets' 6-foot-10-inch power forward, was fined and benched Monday for missing an appointment Sunday to have X-rays on his left ankle and missing a Monday shoot-around before the game with the Clippers.


China Expels Three Canadians on Rights Mission
Three Canadian members of Parliament who came to China to investigate human rights gained first-hand insight into the issue today when the Government detained them, jostled them and put them on the first flight out of the country.
The legislators had planned to go to Tiananmen Square, reporters in tow, to honor the victims of the 1989 military crackdown on the democracy movement.
They had also intended to go to the gate of a Beijing prison to request permission to visit dissidents who are known to be inside.


Mary Louise Hafford, Violinist, 89, Is Dead

Judge Suspends Deportation of Irish Alien
A Federal immigration judge in Manhattan suspended the deportation of an illegal alien from Northern Ireland and granted political asylum to his family yesterday on the ground that their return would expose them to danger.
Lawyers for the man, Sean Mackin, 33 years old, said the ruling by Judge Annette S. Elstein was the first to extend political asylum to refugees from the political violence that has taken thousands of lives in Northern Ireland.


College Official Says He Pleaded With Police for Help With Crush
A City College administrator said yesterday that he pleaded with a police captain for help at a crucial moment around the time that a human crush ultimately killed nine people at a celebrity basketball game, but the captain, instead of responding promptly, reproached him for an agonizing five to seven minutes about the college's mistakes before finally calling for an ambulance.
The union that represents police captains yesterday denied the official's account.


Man, 71, Slain in Flushing
The superintendent of a Queens apartment building was found bludgeoned to death on his kitchen floor yesterday, killed during an apparent robbery Monday night, the police said.
William Nelson, 71 years old, the superintendent of a 14-story building at 133-36 41st Road in Flushing, had been beaten with an unidentified blunt object, the police said.


Wise Timeout on Breast Implants
Between one and two million American women have undergone breast implant surgery -- some to correct a deformity or replace a breast lost to cancer, the vast majority for purely cosmetic reasons.
Many of them, citing no ill effects, will say they made the right decision.
Sadly, however, none can say it was a truly informed decision.
As the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has only just discovered, at least one manufacturer withheld safety information and at least one of its employees lied in telling plastic surgeons that safety studies were under way.
The F.D.A., then, is absolutely right to ask for a voluntary moratorium on silicone breast implants (saline implants are unaffected) until safety concerns are answered.

A Change of Fortune
It is raining gold at Arte Publico Press in Houston.

PCB Concerns Endanger Research at New Paltz
David B. Straus knows a lot about toxic substances.
An associate professor of biochemistry, he conducts experiments on the effects of harmful chemicals on DNA.
But now, much of that research may have been destroyed in a real toxic disaster.
Officials at the State University of New York's College in New Paltz said yesterday that the science building where Dr.
Straus works, as well as a theater, would probably be closed for the entire spring semester because of PCB contamination.
On Dec. 29, transformers containing PCB's in those buildings and three dormitories overheated after a car struck a utility pole, causing a power surge.


For Rangers' All-Stars, Three Just Isn't Enough
The Rangers take themselves so seriously this season that there was considerable grumbling today when the National Hockey League announced that center Mark Messier, defenseman Brian Leetch and goaltender Mike Richter were among the 15 players added to the Wales Conference team for the National Hockey League All-Star Game in Philadelphia on Jan. 18
Although this marked the first time since 1977 that the Rangers will dress as many as three players for the game, the players wondered aloud after practice why there could not be more.
Why not four, or five?

Smith Gives UConn 37 Reasons to Win
Jim Calhoun gets paid a lot of money for a lot of things as the basketball coach at the University of Connecticut, but gushing is not one of them.
So when Chris Smith scored a career-high 33 points at Illinois last Saturday, and Calhoun did not start heaping praise, the coach had a mini-controversy on his hands.
Smith made Calhoun's job much easier tonight.
He scored 37 points to lead the undefeated Huskies (11-0) to an 85-76 victory over St.
John's amid the happy noise of Gampel Pavilion.
The senior guard made open jumpers, off-balance jumpers, drives off steals, floaters off fast breaks and an improbable high-rise flip after he stumbled past St.
John's guard David Cain.


A Drink of Premium Wine Is a Twist of the Wrist Away
GLEN ELLEN, California's ninth largest producer of table wines, is experimenting with putting a metal screw cap on a standard-sized bottle of premium red wine that sells for $10.
Such caps have long been found on low-cost jug wines and small bottles, but replacing the cork on expensive wines with caps has been taboo.
"It's a good idea," said Louis P. Martini, a longtime Napa Valley wine producer.
"I was talking with some vintners recently. They said they had no objection to the soda-pop crown seal or screw cap. But the question was, who wants to be first in the general market?"


Personal Health
BEFORE puberty, migraine headaches afflict boys and girls in equal numbers.
But once the adolescent flow of sex hormones begins, migraines start to affect more girls than boys.
By adulthood, at least twice as many women as men are plagued with these life-disrupting headaches, which make them feel sick all over.
For decades, people have tried to account for this difference.
Many lay people and professionals alike mistakenly attributed it to traits like perfectionism or nervous anxiety, to sexual conflicts or to deep-seated emotional problems that they believed were more characteristic of women than of men.
But in recent years as the neurochemistry of sex hormones and migraines has come to be better understood, a rather clear-cut biological explanation for this all-too-common affliction of women has emerged.


A Chilly but Inviting Day


A National Curriculum: Seeking Fairness for All
The 11-year-olds in Richard Nokes's history class are not having an easy time.
They are trying to figure out how ancient Roman roads were built, and their only sources are translations of descriptions by writers of the time.
It is a sophisticated lesson in how to read primary documents, a skill expected of every child now that Britain has a required national curriculum.


Zale, Under Pressure, Revamps Management
The Zale Corporation, a Dallas-based jewelry retailer whose creditors are seeking to force it into bankruptcy, has announced a new management arrangement aimed at making the troubled chain more responsive to its customers.
Irving R. Gerstein, the company's chairman, also said yesterday that Zale was meeting with its banks and bondholders "to discuss the company's business plans." Several large bondholders have already sought to force the company into bankruptcy court, but Zale has not yet indicated if it will seek to resist that process in court.

Knicks Look Ahead and Fall Behind
Sooner or later, it had to happen to the Knicks.
They have made a habit this season of falling behind early, only to come back dramatically in the final minutes.
But last night, the Knicks fell behind and it cost them.
There was no miracle 3-point shot, no Hollywood-type finish and no fourth-quarter collapse by the Atlanta Hawks.
Suffering its third home-court loss of the season, New York was beaten by Atlanta, 109-94, before 17,442 fans at Madison Square Garden.


Court Upholds New York Ban On Double Subsidy for Heat Cost
A Federal appeals court panel yesterday upheld New York State's ban on providing home heating allowances for poor people living in Government-subsidized housing where heating costs are already paid for as part of the rent.
In reversing a lower court ruling, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that to force the state to pay the heating costs of poor people whose monthly rent already covers such costs would be a strain on an already overburdened system.

Brooklyn Man Slain for Coat, Police Say
A 19-year-old Brooklyn man on his way to buy cigarettes for his mother was shot to death early yesterday near his home during a mugging in which a leather coat he had received for Christmas was stolen, the police said.
The victim, Louis R. Carvajal, was going to buy cigarettes for his mother, Tomasa Lopez, at a grocery at 1136 Flatbush Avenue about 2:30 A.M. when he was shot three times in the head near a gas station at 1142 Flatbush Avenue in East Flatbush, said Sgt.

He lived in Manasquan, N.J., until he was confined four years ago to a nursing home.


Alcoa Plans to Take A $217 Million Charge
Alcoa said yesterday that it was taking a $217 million after-tax charge against its earnings for the fourth quarter, primarily to cover the cost of environmental cleanup activities at several operating sites.
Analysts said the charge was certain to result in a quarterly loss for the nation's largest aluminum producer.
Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, said $160 million of the charge was for environmental matters at a number of plants around the world.
But the largest provision was for the company's smelting and aluminum fabricating plant in Massena, N.Y.


Review/Television; Loss of a Job Summons The Specter of Poverty
Tonight Bill Moyers focuses on people who do not have the luxury of seeing the big picture when it comes to global economics.
For these workers in Milwaukee, the flight of factories to other countries has meant unemployment or jobs that do not pay enough to support a family.
"Minimum Wages," at 9 on Channels 13 and 49, captures anxieties that are spreading across America.
This sober report notes that although 85,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Milwaukee in the last few years, the city's unemployment rate remains relatively low.
But the sorts of jobs available do not pay enough to keep up installments on the house or the car or to plan ahead.
Since many of them do not offer health benefits, a serious illness can be devastating.


Marino Says Reform Needed
Following are excerpts of Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino's response to Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's State of the State Address, as recorded by The New York Times.
. . .
New York State is in trouble, and we are at a crossroads.
It is the opinion of Republicans that we cannot continue on the same track.
The time to change direction is now.
Since 1982, state spending has virtually doubled while our population has grown by only 3 percent.
Spending growth has outpaced inflation by 56 percent.
. . .
New York's economic problems, fueled by taxes, spending, regulatory controls and fiscal mismanagement, spiraled out of control. . . .
Today, it is the virtually automatic growth of New York's Medicaid and welfare programs that is the chief cause of our budget problems at both the state and local level.


Homeless Man Hurt in Fire
A homeless man, apparently asleep in the entranceway of an East Side apartment building, was severely burned last night when a fire broke out in the hallway around him, the police said.
He was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he was listed in critical condition, with third-degree burns over a large part of his body, a hospital spokesman said.
His name was not released pending a search for relatives; a neighbor said he was known as Richie.
The fire, at 438 Third Avenue, was quickly brought under control.

He is continuing to teach there at the architecture school as a professor emeritus in fall semesters.


Review/Television; New Detective With a Private Side
"Mystery" confronts a puzzle: Can a detective whose most prominent characteristic is that he has no prominent characteristics make the always-treacherous jump from printed page to television drama?
Can the rather colorless Chief Inspector Roderick (Rory) Alleyn find a series niche for himself among such established eccentrics as Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot and Inspector Morse?
"Artists in Crime," a two-parter starting tonight at 9 on Channel 13, offers tantalizing but inconclusive answers.
Alleyn is the creation of Ngaio Marsh, a New Zealander who settled in London in the late 1920's with an eye toward an acting and directing career, especially in anything having to do with Shakespeare.
She wrote her first mystery novel, "A Man Lay Dead," in 1931.
Some 30 more would follow before her death in 1982 at age 83.
No doubt because the character of Alleyn tended to be so distantly proper, Marsh often wickedly dumped him into bizarre plots, stuffed with enough red herrings to suggest an underlying practical joke.

PRESIDENT'S PLANS FOR MEDICAL CARE OUTLINED TO A.M.A.
President Bush's election-year prescription for the nation's health-care system is likely to include new incentives for people to enroll in prepaid group health plans, tax credits for the purchase of medical insurance and restrictions on medical malpractice lawsuits, the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, told doctors this week.
Mr.

Celtics Have Knicks All Shook Up
Throughout the fourth quarter tonight, the Boston Garden was shaking.
And the Knicks' knees were shaking, too.
To say the Knicks collapsed somewhat tonight would be like saying the stock market collapsed somewhat in 1929.
During the first 9 minutes of the fourth quarter, New York scored 3 points.
Forget about making a shot.
Most of the Knicks were too tentative to even take a shot.


Review/Piano; Hearing A Talented Also-Ran
It is not usual to bill a pianist as a "distinguished loser," as William Wolfram was at the 92d Street Y on Tuesday night.
But Mr.
Wolfram actually is a distinguished loser.
Though he has come close to winning nearly every major piano competition -- the Chopin, the Cliburn, the Leeds, the Tchaikovsky, the Naumburg and the Queen Elisabeth -- he has managed to lose them all.
He is also being presented as part of a series, titled "Goldfingers," featuring three such "failed" pianists (Alexander Shtarkman and Pedro Burmester will be presented later this season, in their New York debuts).
Losing a competition, the series suggests, may be a credential as significant as winning one.
The writer Joseph Horowitz, who organized the series, argues in program notes and in his recent critical book on the Van Cliburn contest, "The Ivory Trade," that the piano competition is a "flawed method for identifying and rewarding young musical talent." The pianists' failures, in fact, may be partly due to their virtues.

Dinkins Offers New Plan To Raise Emergency Cash
A week before it is to present its four-year plan for keeping New York City's budget balanced, the Dinkins administration has proposed a new way to raise $1 billion in emergency cash, and is weighing new ways of using that money to shrink the city work force, increase productivity and satisfy fiscal monitors.
Senior mayoral aides say they hope the new plan will help break the political and financial logjams that have stymied earlier proposals for borrowing money to help ease the city's fiscal problems because it will not require the direct approval of the State Legislature or the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
Because the money would be raised in stages, officials said, fiscal monitors would be able to block the effort at any time if the city failed to follow through on its pledges to cut spending.


Asian Flu
"Nothing extraordinary has occurred," Marlin Fitzwater told reporters after President Bush vomited and collapsed in his chair at a state dinner in Tokyo.
In one sense he was right: millions of people suffer from the flu that apparently felled Mr.
Bush.
But in another sense Mr.
Fitzwater had it wrong: when Presidents get sick, however ordinary the illness, the world experiences far-from-ordinary intimations of mortality.
Television flashes frightening images of a man in distress.
Markets shudder.
Potentates wire condolences.
Pundits ruminate on Mr.
Bush's fitness to campaign and Dan Quayle's fitness to succeed him.
What for most people is a moment of private disorientation becomes an occasion for public discussion.

Accord Reported to End Haiti Crisis
Diplomats seeking a negotiated settlement of Haiti's three-month political crisis say that the country's deposed President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has endorsed the nomination of a leading political rival as Prime Minister in a compromise arrangement that would eventually bring about his return from exile.
Officials from the Organization of American States, which has sponsored negotiations for Father Aristide's return, said today that after two days of discussions with Haitian parliamentary leaders in Venezuela, the deposed President had accepted the nomination of Rene Theodore, one of two names put forward by the legislators, to be his Prime Minister.


Broke Comptroller
As the head of an accounting firm here that bears his name, Michael J. Maunsell made it his business to oversee the financial affairs of others.
His clients included individuals and more complicated accounts, like that of the neighboring town of Southbury.
Those were the credentials that swept the political newcomer to victory last November when he ran for city comptroller on the Democratic ticket, a ticket that pledged fiscal responsibility for this onetime manufacturing center, which has stumbled badly under the combined effects of municipal scandal and the recession.


Ukraine Seizes Moscow's Army Communications
The central military command said today that its primary communications control over 300,000 troops of the former Soviet Army in Ukraine had been lost to Kiev military officials intent on nationalizing Soviet units in the republic.
The number represents about one-fourth of the former Soviet units in Ukraine.
The unilateral action deepened the political struggle between Ukraine and Russia over control of the military remnants of the defunct Soviet Union.

Snow From Hollywood Hits Manhattan


Abroad at Home; 'J.F.K.'
Oliver Stone's "J.F.K." may well move a generation to believe that a conspiracy lay behind the assassination of President Kennedy.
That is its message, and a film that hits the emotions as skillfully as this one does can have a profound impact.
It is right, therefore, to take the movie seriously.
Its charges could hardly be more serious.
It suggests that Earl Warren, the revered Chief Justice, was party to covering up a murderous conspiracy.
It tells us that our Government cannot be trusted even to give an honest account of a President's assassination.


North Carolina Is Told to Improve Safety Role
Labor Secretary Lynn Martin today gave the State of North Carolina 90 days to beef up its enforcement of job safety and health regulations or, she said, the Federal Government will take it over.
Twenty-five workers died Sept. 3 in a fire at a chicken-processing plant in Hamlet, N.C., in one of the nation's worst industrial accidents.
State officials later said the state had never inspected the plant over the 11 years it operated.
Federal Department of Agriculture investigators had checked the site almost daily for flies and vermin.


Hot-Wiring Overseas Telephone Calls
International Discount Telecommunications, based in a former funeral parlor in the Bronx, is a tiny start-up company that hopes it has a very big idea: allowing callers abroad to telephone the United States at the same low rates Americans pay to call overseas.
The company's 35-year-old founder, Howard Jonas, is as straightforward as the company's name.
An energetic entrepreneur who also runs a larger company that publishes brochures for hotels, Mr.
Jonas believes he has stumbled upon a kind of telecommunications jujitsu, using the weight and strength of the phone giants against them.


Aid, at Last, for the Republics
The republics of the former Soviet Union are struggling to turn decrepit Communism into vibrant capitalism.
Even if successful, the transition will be traumatic.
Ossified factories will close, throwing millions out of work; controls will be lifted, sending prices soaring.
The entire fabric of society will have to be created anew.
The republics will need all the help they can get.
So it is welcome news that the Bush Administration has finally endorsed membership for Russia and five other republics in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Membership allows the two institutions to provide billions of dollars of aid to support economic reform.

Steinbrenner Insists He's Not Behind Moves
George Steinbrenner reacted angrily yesterday to speculation that he is again controlling the Yankees and said the team's $30 million plunge into the free-agent market was orchestrated by the partnership, not him, as a way of remaining competitive with the Mets.
In a telephone interview yesterday from his Tampa, Fla., office, Steinbrenner scoffed at reports that suggested that he had been holding back the organization's cash until recently and said it was a partnership decision to remain frugal because the club lost money in 1990 and 1991.

Russian Actor Tells Of Chaotic Freedom In Russian Theater
There are easier things than being an actor in Russia these days, even if you're one of the country's superstars.
Russian film makers go begging for financing.
Theater companies can't locate the essentials for costumes and props.
Finding even a loaf of bread can be difficult.
Audiences dwindle as citizens become increasingly distracted by the hunt for necessities.
And some of the best playwrights, shell-shocked by political and social upheaval, won't write new works until they regain their artistic bearings.
"But there is one wonderful thing -- we are free," said Vitaly Mefodiyevich Solomin, a Russian stage and film star who will perform at the Circle in the Square Theater on Broadway on Saturday night.
"All the constraints and hardships have forced us to be more creative. And at the end of all of this, I think we will have reinvented our theater."

Cuomo Offers Plan to Stimulate Recovery in New York Economy
In a State of the State address that mixed exhortation and confrontation, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo pledged today to help lift New York out of the grim hold of the recession and challenged lawmakers to undertake major improvements in the way the state manages its own finances.
The centerpiece of the Governor's recovery program was his call for an $800 million bond act that he said would spur construction projects across the state and create thousands of jobs.
The proposal would not go before the voters until November, a fact bemoaned by some lawmakers today even as they praised the concept.


Review/City Ballet; Balanchine's Laconic Titles and Eloquent Dances
George Balanchine wanted movement to speak more eloquently than words.
No wonder that he was verbally reticent about his choreographic intentions.
His disdain of fancy language even affected his choice of titles.
Take "Symphony in C," which the New York City Ballet presented on Tuesday night at the New York State Theater as part of its first repertory program since "The Nutcracker." When "Symphony in C" received its world premiere by the Paris Opera Ballet in 1947, it was called "Le Palais de Cristal." A year later, however, when Ballet Society, the City Ballet's predecessor, introduced it to New York, its title was changed to that of its score by Bizet.


Teen-Agers' Inner Sanctums, Where Many Worlds Collide
A COUPLE of years ago, a photographer named Adrienne Salinger began studying the faces of teen-agers in shopping malls, movie lines and fast-food restaurants around Syracuse.
"I'd approach interesting-looking kids and ask if I could photograph them in their bedrooms," she said.
"But they had to promise not to clean the rooms."
Funny, said the teen-agers, we were just about to clean our rooms.
Oh well, anything for art.


Graduates March Down Aisle Into Job Nightmare
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 8 --
Lauren Bolfango, a recent law school graduate, works 37 1/2 hours a week researching cases, writing pleas and motions and doing other standard tasks of a new associate in a small law firm here.
What sets her apart is that she does the work without charge, after losing hope that her search for employment would ever produce a real job and deciding that volunteering in her chosen profession was better than being unemployed.


Bush Collapses at State Dinner With the Japanese
President Bush fell suddenly ill and collapsed at a state dinner being given for him Wednesday night at the home of the Japanese Prime Minister.Today, Mr.
Bush appeared for photographers, looking tired but cheerful, and apologized for the alarm his collapse had caused.
Mr.
Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said on Wednesday night, after the attack, that Mr.
Bush had the kind of gastroenteritis commonly known as intestinal flu, but insisted nonetheless that he was "feeling fine." Under questioning, he acknowledged that Mr.
Bush had thrown up at his seat just before collapsing and had been in what he called "a faint condition."

American Airlines' New Class
In an effort to extend a concept long familiar on international flights, American Airlines said yesterday that on Feb. 4 it would begin offering business-class service on flights between New York and Los Angeles.
It appeared that the move was made at least partly to make more room in first class and that it would come at the expense of passengers with frequent-flier miles who wished to upgrade their tickets.


PARENT &amp; CHILD
SHE had never felt that close to her father, had never really felt accepted by him.
The last time she visited him in the hospital where he lay dying, he asked her for a drink of water.
When she brought it, he whispered his thanks.
"She feels that the 'thank you' wasn't just for that cup of water," said Dr.
Andrew E. Scharlach, a professor of aging at the University of California at Berkeley who has been studying several hundred middle-aged people, including this woman, who have experienced the death of one or both parents.


Christmas Tree's Fate: Helping Life as Mulch
Tossing out old Christmas trees on garbage day is a waste of potentially rich, fragrant mulch for the garden.
For the last three years, the New York City Department of Sanitation has chipped Christmas trees, but lack of funds canceled this year's program.
The Green Guerillas, a nonprofit group that helps urban gardeners, is helping to fill the void.


In Setback for Administration, Japan Gives No Aid on Supercollider
President Bush will return to the United States this week with no financial commitment from Japan for the giant $8.4 billion superconducting supercollider in Texas, raising new doubts about the project's future.
Obtaining a billion dollars or more for the 52-mile-long particle accelerator, one of the United States' largest and most expensive science experiments, was among the Bush Administration's top priorities for the trip.
The project is designed to hurl protons together at far greater energies than have ever been achieved to answer basic questions about the forces of nature.


McCann Is Awarded Account by Safeway
After a six-month review, Safeway Inc., Oakland, Calif., yesterday awarded its $35 million advertising accounts to McCann-Erickson Worldwide, San Francisco and New York.

L.I. Man Who Fled Chain Gang Is Told to Go Back to Alabama
A Suffolk County man who fled from an Alabama chain gang 28 years ago will have to return to Alabama and serve the last 19 years of his 21-year sentence for robbery, a New York State judge has ruled.
The lawyer for James Harris, who has been living in Brentwood, L.I., since his escape from Alabama, said he would appeal the ruling as far as he had to.
"This case has an absolute right to be carried to the Supreme Court," said the lawyer, John Ray.
Mr.
Harris is free pending the appeal.

Democracy Is a System, Not a Man
A sad comedy of role reversals is being played out in Georgia, illustrating how difficult it is going to be to create working democracies in the former Soviet republics, especially with leaders whose pasts give little clue as to whether they will turn out to be democrats or tyrants.


Welcome, Democracy
Finally, 11 years after the New York Civil Liberties Union went to court to force democracy on New York's form of city government, the new City Council is making its debut.
When it met for the first time yesterday it had 51 members instead of 35, more power, more responsibility, more diversity, more independence.
That doesn't mean it will also be more competent.
The Council's record suggests it is far from prepared to play its revised role effectively.


Evidence Grows Stronger for Planets Orbiting an Exploded Star
Astronomers have found what they think will prove to be the first definitive evidence of planets orbiting a star other than the Sun.
By the precise timing of fluctuations in natural radio signals, the American astronomers have inferred that two and possibly three objects are circling the dense spinning remnant of an exploded star, known as a neutron star or pulsar.
Each of the objects appears to have three times the mass of Earth, to be similar in density and composition to Earth or Venus and to be closer to the star than Earth is to the Sun.


Woolworth Cuts Back On Stores
Facing a persistently weak economy, the Woolworth Corporation said yesterday that it planned to close, sell or reformat 900 of its 6,500 stores in the United States during the next 18 months.
Woolworth, which over its 113 years turned to selling clothes, shoes and sporting equipment after starting out as a simple variety store, said that half the closed stores would be reopened as faster-growing types of Woolworth stores.
The company said that less than half of the 10,000 workers at the stores would lose their jobs.

Mr. Cuomo's Sobering Speech
Even Gov.
Mario Cuomo's soaring rhetorical skills were not enough to lift his State of the State address above the depths of a national recession.
The New York Governor complained about weak national policies, restated his commitment to the needy and proposed limited programs to help the state.
With the economy sagging and a state budget gap that could reach $4.5 billion in the next fiscal year, the speech was inevitably sobering.
Mr.
Cuomo must fill in the blanks when he presents his budget later this month.
He says he will cut Medicaid and welfare by $1 billion.
How?
He also wants to create jobs through an $800 million bond issue for construction.
Would that add too much debt to deficit-ridden New York?


Market Place; S.E.C.'s Analysis Of Nov. 15 Plunge
THE Securities and Exchange Commission, in a preliminary report, has concluded that varieties of program trading played a large role in the abrupt decline of the stock market on Nov. 15, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 120 points.
The report said a number of Wall Street firms, which were not identified, had in essence bet on higher stock prices, and were forced to scramble for cover when prices began to fall.
In effect, the report pointed the finger at a strategy similar to portfolio insurance, which was a leading factor in worsening the Oct. 19, 1987, market crash, when the Dow fell 508 points.


CHRONICLE
One way to take the temperature of the times is to chart the career of ADRIANA MNUCHIN.
In the 1970's, she established the store Tennis Lady, which became a chain of 21 tennis-fashion stores in the United States and Canada.
In the 1980's, she established Cashmere-Cashmere, a group of four stores that sell cashmere designs.
In March, she and her husband, ROBERT MNUCHIN, will open an inn in Washington, Conn.


Vote Is Stalled On Auto Race
A final vote by New York City on plans for an Indy-car race on the streets of lower Manhattan was delayed yesterday over unresolved details.
The Franchise and Concession Review Committee, meeting at City Hall, delayed a vote because of financial and sponsorship issues.
Of the two, the former appears less troublesome.


At Feel-Good Event, Most Felt Rotten BYL&gt;By CALVIN SIMS
State of the State speeches are usually occasions when legislators smile, shake hands, applaud the Governor wildly or politely depending on their party and otherwise take a bath of good feelings, whether they feel good or not.
But it is a measure of the frayed mood of officials here that the pretense this year not only faded but gave way about 40 minutes into Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's speech to a shouting match between Mr.
Cuomo and an Assemblyman from his own party and hometown.


Snow at Your Fingertips, No Mittens Required
SNOW globes -- souvenirs filled with water and falling "snow" -- seem to be gaining new status as collectibles.
In 1990 they were the subject of "Snowdomes," written by Nancy McMichael and published by Abbeville Press.
Now they're in a show.
"Snowbound: The Enduring Magic of Snow Globes" is an exhibition of 66 old globes and 23 new ones by eight American artists.
It is at the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wis., through Feb. 2.


Grants Open Doors for Nuclear Waste
Lured by lucrative grants, seven communities around the country have notified the Government that they are interested in becoming the site of a multibillion-dollar warehouse to store thousands of tons of high-level nuclear wastes, the Department of Energy said today.
But the notifications by the communities, among them five Indian tribes, have also stirred political dissension and raised questions about whether the Government is taking advantage of hard economic times and rural poverty to gain a site for some of the nation's most dangerous industrial wastes.

Institutions Inject Cash Into Money Funds
The inflow of cash into tax-exempt and taxable money market funds in the last week was huge, IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report said yesterday.
Walter S. Frank, the publication's chief economist, said the amount of money flowing into the taxables was the highest been since the money funds were begun in the 1970's.


To Skate or Not to Skate Is Question for Eldredge
Todd Eldredge, the leading American male figure skater for the last two years, has been advised by his doctor to withdraw from the national championships this week because of an injury in his lower back.
But in a telephone conversation he had today with Eldredge, his parents and his coach, Dr.
Arthur Pappas of Worcester, Mass., also told the skater that with proper rest, he would probably be sound enough to perform successfully in the Albertville Olympics next month.


For Young Readers, Picasso Not Bunnies
Call me Max.
Max the dreamer.
Max the poet.
Max the dog.
My dream is to live in Paris.
To live in Paris and be a poet . . .
But do you think it is easy for a dog to pack a small brown suitcase, put on a beret, and hop on a plane?
Ha!
Plane tickets cost money.
Mazuma, shekels, semolians.
I have none.
Because no one wants to buy my book.
I'm flat broke.
Bone dry.
But someday, fat families and skinny families around the world will be reading my poems.
And laughing, and crying.
I feel it in my bones.
I want to say, before anything, that dreams are very important. -- "Max Makes a Million," Viking, 1990

Planned Parenthood Chief Resigns to Be TV Host
Faye Wattleton, who moved Planned Parenthood squarely into the center of the abortion debate in her 14 years as president, announced yesterday that she was resigning from the group to become host of a television show.
Ms.
Wattleton, 48 years old, whose impassioned commitment to reproductive freedoms made her the nation's best-known advocate for abortion rights during her 14 years as president of Planned Parenthood, said she planned to be the host of a daytime television talk show dealing with women's issues.


New Crop Of Books For Sundry Obsessions
WITH the outdoor garden now quiet, there's time to fill the indoor bookshelf.
And there are more than enough new volumes to feed nearly every horticultural obsession.
Consider the passion for perennials.

This two-volume set, with 5,000 color photographs, is part of a series by Roger Phillips and Martyn Rix, two Englishmen determined to show more species than any gardener can hope to encounter in a lifetime.

Lest Terror Be Forgotten
THREE hundred years ago in Salem, Mass., 14 women and 6 men, accused of being witches, were tried, convicted and executed.
Nineteen were hanged.
One was crushed by stones.
Last summer, the Salem Witch Trials Tercentenary Committee sponsored a design competition for a memorial to the 20 that would serve as a cautionary reminder of the hysteria that led to their deaths.
The site is the Charter Street Cemetery in Salem, where some of the judges who presided over the trials are buried, but none of the victims.

Inspiration Is Only a Room Away
FOUR times a year, the fashion designer Donna Karan dispatches her models down the runway wearing jewelry designed by Robert Lee Morris.
The belts and bracelets they wear -- indeed many belts and bracelets that Jodie Foster, Cher, Sonia Braga, Madonna and Axl Rose wear -- are largely inspired by the hinges and handles and sinewy vases in Mr.
Morris's Manhattan home.

She died of a stroke, said her sister Margaret, of Manhattan.


I.B.M. Cuts Some P.C. Prices
I.B.M. announced price reductions yesterday of from 10 to 16 percent on some of its most advanced personal computers.

Victim of Bias Attack, 14, Wrestles With His Anger
In the basement apartment of a beige stucco house in the Bronx, a 14-year-old boy has been cloistered away for three days, wrestling with the fear and anger left by four young white men who attacked him and his sister, squirting them with white paint and yelling racial epithets.
The fear is the least of his worries.
He can cope with that, the shy but proud youth said yesterday.
But what weighs in his heart the heaviest, in spite of what his mother and his own mind tell him, is a wave of anger he says he feels toward an entire race of people since the Monday morning attack.

Panthers' Morningstar Wows Syracuse Now
Five years ago, Bernie Fine, the Syracuse assistant coach, received a homemade videotape of a tall, semi-awkward player from the state of Washington who wanted to become an Orangeman.
But Syracuse was recruiting the Billy Owenses and Derrick Colemans of the basketball world and figured that if it hadn't heard of Darren Morningstar, it probably didn't need him.
"I was a naive young man and my dad was crazy too," Morningstar recalled this evening.
"He had me as the next coming of Larry Bird. Bernie Fine wrote me a nice friendly letter back saying they didn't think they could use me in their program."

More Corporate Issues Are Offered
New corporate debt securities continued to stream into the credit markets yesterday, with more than $4.5 billion worth of new issues priced.
The heavy volume came just a day after $2.5 billion worth of corporate bonds were priced, and prompted some traders and investment bankers to predict that $10 billion in new issues would be sold this week.


Saints Who Helped Out At Home
IN 19th-century Puerto Rico, folk artists called santeros carved religious images from wood.
An exhibition of 175 of the carvings, "Santos de Palo: The Household Saints of Puerto Rico," opened on Tuesday at the Museum of American Folk Art/ Eva and Morris Feld Gallery at Lincoln Square.
Santos, blessed by priests, were used mainly in rural areas, where there were few churches.
"If they weren't blessed, they couldn't be used to make miracles," said Alan Moss Reveron, a Manhattan dealer of 20th-century decorative arts whose santos make up the show.
He has more than 1,200 of them.

Review/Television; Reporting That Follows in Many Footsteps
Despite the presence of Ed Bradley, "Street Stories," the latest entry from CBS News, shows none of the ambition and little of the punch of "60 Minutes." It is closer to "48 Hours," which inspired it, but the new program does not try for the many-sided reporting of "48 Hours" at its occasional best.
This judgment, based on the first of four specials, to be shown tonight at 9 on Channel 2, may be premature, but for now that's all there is.
Three of the opening program's four segments were available for review, and all have to do with crime: drunken driving in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., gay-bashing in Houston, and the performance of a tough judge in Chattanooga, Tenn.
If you feel you've been here before, you've been watching too much television.
The reporters are Bernard Goldberg and Harold Dow, "48 Hours" regulars, and Bob McKeown.
Mr.
Bradley's come-on role of host is as undemanding as Dan Rather's on "48 Hours."

Saved by the Grace of Barbara Bush
The 25th Amendment to the Constitution specifies that the Vice President shall assume the duties of the President whenever the Chief Executive is unable to carry out his duties.
Of course, that was written before Barbara Bush came to the White House.

Bush moved in typically unruffled fashion when her husband, George, fell ill on Wednesday night, and took up his ceremonial duties at a dinner being held in the President's honor by Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.


N.C.A.A. Adopts Tougher Academic Standards for Eligibility
Delegates to the annual National Collegiate Athletic Association Convention continued adopting stronger academic standards on the aging heels of Proposition 48, including a significant and predictably controversial change today that will require incoming athletes to have a higher grade-point average in core academic classes.
Other changes include a toughened requirement that athletes make progress toward a degree and an increase in the number of core-course credits taken by high school students from 11 to 13.
The additional subjects must be in English, mathematics or natural or physical science.


Watchdog Group for Children's TV to Disband
Action for Children's Television, the national watchdog group that promotes quality television programming for children, will disband this year to allow organizations with larger memberships to carry on the cause, the group's president said today.

The group was created in 1968 by three Newton, Mass., housewives.

The ideas were contributed by some of the nation's largest advertisers, and an advance copy was made available by the consulting firm's president, Jack Myers.


Chief Warns of Corruption In Drug Unit
Citing two recent cases in which narcotics officers were accused of lying to strengthen cases and to obtain arrest warrants, the New York City Police Department's chief corruption fighter warned yesterday that "there are very serious problems" in a special narcotics bureau.
In an unsolicited report to Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown last month, the Chief of Inspectional Services, Daniel F. Sullivan, urged the Commissioner to tighten supervision at the bureau and to shake up how the bureau supervised drug cases and deters corruption and misconduct.

The Freshman Is Home. Bi-zarre!
THE way Miryom Kass describes her life these days, her house has suddenly turned into a gigantic refrigerator, and her mission is to shovel food into it as fast as she can.
It is a sure sign that her son, the Freshman, is home for semester break.
"The food," Mrs.
Kass said with a deep sigh.
"And the dishes. You would think he was starving the whole semester."
Nothing unusual is going on in the Kass household in Brooklyn; just the upheaval that accompanies a college student's first extended visit home.
Many have been home since mid-December and are going back to school this week and next.


Presidential Wars Behind Him, Cuomo Attacks His Legislative Foes
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo used his 10th State of the State address today to declare to both the Legislature and the state that he is no longer the political hostage of his Presidential ambitions.
Liberated of any need to position himself toward the right or to coax the Legislature into consensus, Mr.
Cuomo cast himself as a strong protector of the social services safety net and as a populist crusader against legislative intransigence.


Pop and Jazz in Review
David Staller The Algonquin Hotel 59 West 44th Street Through Feb. 15
David Staller belongs to a nearly vanished tradition of American male stage performers who model themselves more on English gentlemen than on American frontiersmen.
But the dandified rogue image he cultivates, which recalls certain roles played by Laurence Olivier and Michael York, fits perfectly the spirit of his ambitious cabaret show, "Noel and Cole." The celebration of the songs of Noel Coward and Cole Porter opened a five-week engagement at the Algonquin Hotel's Oak Room on Tuesday evening.


Making a Wish List, Cutting It Twice
JANUARY for gardeners is, of course, catalogue time.
As postal carriers trudge up to the mailbox daily to unburden themselves of the new crop from mail-order nurseries across the land, people who are yearning for another growing season begin to sharpen their pencils and start making out lists.
The lists generally have to be shortened drastically, as they exceed the capacity of most checking accounts and most gardens.
Here's part of my own list, based not on glowing descriptions in catalogues but on plants that caught my eye last year.

Quayle Opens Battle of New Hampshire
Bumping along in a bus called Victory II, Vice President Dan Quayle stumped through New Hampshire today as point man in the White House's battle to stop the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan from doing well enough in the first Presidential primary to embarrass President Bush.
At shopping malls, factories, schools and civic centers in the first set of 13 cities and towns that he is touring today and Thursday, part of the Vice President's mission was clearly to try to dispel a question that is being weighed by this state's voters and vexing the President's re-election team: who is the true Republican conservative, Mr.
Bush or Mr.
Buchanan?

30's Styles for 90's Walls
IN the mid-1930's, Adelaide Brandt was a student at the Chicago Art Institute, sketching fashion designs.
In November, her drawings were transformed into "Haute Couture," a hand-printed wallpaper by Schumacher, a New York company that makes fabrics and wallpaper.
The sketches had hung for decades in an office at Brandt's, a Phoenix wallpaper company founded by Mrs.
Brandt's family.
In 1985, they caught the eye of John Quilter, a Schumacher vice president paying a sales call.


F.B.I. to Shift From Cold War to Crime War
In a personnel shake-up that reflects the end of the cold war, the Federal Bureau of Investigation plans to reassign several hundred agents from internal security investigations to combat serious crime and gang violence, officials in the Bush Administration said today.
Although the move is expected to involved fewer than 300 agents in a force of about 10,000, the shift is symbolically dramatic, representing a downgrading of counter-espionage efforts in favor of a more intensive attack on violent crime, particularly gang violence.
"Call it a peace dividend," one official said.

One major example is the rule that requires the visiting team in the championship game to be in the home team's city for two nights before the game.
As a result the Lions must arrive in Washington on Friday for Sunday's game against the favored Redskins at R.F.K.
Stadium.


Holyfield-Foreman II: Tyson Is a Snag
Never mind that it's a new year.
For boxing, it's business as usual.
In other words, more confounding organizational politics.
The plans of the promoter, Dan Duva, to have Evander Holyfield defend his undisputed heavyweight title against George Foreman on March 20 at Caesars Palace have hit a snag.

Brothers Held In Man's Death In Brooklyn
A sticker reading "We Go to Sunday School" adorns the scuffed metal door of the housing project apartment where Daniel Velasquez, 13 years old, and his brother Carlos, 15, live with their family.
But last Sunday, according to the police, the teen-age brothers were far from their Bronx home at 2 in the morning.
In fact, the police said, they were in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, robbing a Soviet immigrant couple before firing a single shot to the husband's head that left him dead on the pavement.

If Unborn Have Rights, Those Must Be Equal; Pro- and Anti-Choice
To the Editor:
The problem I have with "The Looming Abortion Showdown" (editorial, Dec. 18) is your use of the term "pro-life."


Lie Detector for Howe
STEVE HOWE, the Yankee relief pitcher who was arrested on cocaine-related charges last month, took a lie-detector test at his own request from a Federal drug agent in Helena, Mont.

Sports of The Times; The Hall's Mr. Highest Percentage
Tom Seaver was up on a small platform at the New York Sheraton, talking about what the Baseball Hall of Fame meant to him.
"My children," he said, "will be able to take their children to the Hall of Fame and say: 'There's your grandfather. In his time, he was pretty good at what he did.' "


Many Electronics Makers Avoid Recession's Brunt
As the consumer electronics industry meets today at a mammoth semiannual show here, the nation's purveyors of color television sets, videocassette recorders, car stereos and cellular telephones can look back at 1991 as a year in which they escaped the worst effects of the recession.
Sales actually rose.
Figures released this week by the Electronic Industries Association, the consumer electronics trade group, show that factory sales totaled a record $33.9 billion, up 2.9 percent from the year before.
Since electronics prices were virtually unchanged, or in some cases lower than a year earlier, inflation-adjusted sales rose by more than 3 percent.


Police Captain Under Inquiry in Crush
An internal New York City Police Department investigation has been opened into the conduct of the police captain at the fatal City College basketball game after a college administrator said the captain had resisted his appeals for help for more than five minutes before finally calling an ambulance.
Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown announced the investigation by the internal affairs division, which handles charges of misconduct by individual officers, at a news conference yesterday.
He also said he had seen no evidence that the police had acted improperly in not calling the Fire Department for help, as some Fire Department officials have asserted.


If Unborn Have Rights, Those Must Be Equal
To the Editor:
With regard to President Bush and his desire to see the Supreme Court overturn Roe v.
Wade, what is truly amazing about "The Looming Abortion Showdown" (editorial, Dec. 18) is that the President's opposition has not yet exposed the untenable ideology that underlies his position.
I agree with you that women should not wait until Roe is reversed before they "vindicate their rights through the political process." But more important, Mr.
Bush's political fence straddling on this issue should be shown for what it is.


Florio's Education Panel Offers Many Changes, at a Hefty Price
An educational study commission appointed by Gov.
Jim Florio recommended a host of costly changes in the state's school system today, including adding 40 days to the school year and providing preschool to every 3- and 4-year-old in the state.
But the panel offered no suggestions about how to pay for them.
The co-chairmen of the Governor's Quality Education Commission conceded that political and economic realities would make such changes extremely difficult, but dismissed suggestions that the recommendations were too visionary to come to pass.


Politics Reign at Spotted Owl Hearing
For only the third time in history the Cabinet-level committee known as the "God squad" began deliberations today on whether certain economic activities of man are more important than the potential extinction of an animal species.
But the hearings here by the panel, the Endangered Species Committee, concerning the northern spotted owl were only a few minutes old when it became dominated by internal conflicts of the Bush Administration over environmental policies.


Barkley Charges Filed
Philadelphia 76ers forward CHARLES BARKLEY was charged yesterday with misdemeanor battery and disorderly conduct for breaking a Milwaukee man's nose outside a bar last month.
Barkley, who met on Tuesday with MICHAEL STEINHAFEL, a Milwaukee County assistant District Attorney, said he was provoked on Dec. 22 into punching JAMES R. McCARTHY, who needed seven stitches. (AP)


Contributions To Neediest Aid Homeless
"The other day as our 4-year-old was festooning the living room, he suddenly stopped to ask, 'Do homeless people have any Christmas decorations?' " Anna Mayer of Dobbs Ferry wrote in a note with her family's $100 contribution to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"When I told him I thought most homeless people didn't, he thought for a minute. Then he ran to the hallway where he had hung his favorite, most colorful ornament. 'Let's send them this one,' he said. He put it gently into a shoe box. Back in the living room he picked up another ornament to put into the shoe box. 'Maybe they would like to have two,' he said. Our family's donation is in honor of Daniel and his spirit of giving."


Algerian Officials Debating Cancellation of Vote
A heated debate is going on among senior members of the Government over whether President Chadli Benjedid should interrupt the democratic process that has led to a triumph of Islamic fundamentalists in the first free elections for Parliament in this country.
Senior Government officials and some foreign diplomats say debate is taking place just as the Islamic Salvation Front, the main opposition party, reported today that Algerian Army and security forces were being deployed across the country.
The move raised fears of army interference that could prevent fundamentalists from winning a majority of in Parliament in run-off elections scheduled for Jan. 16.

Energy Company Executive To Head JWP's Operations
David L. Sokol has been named president and chief operating officer of JWP Inc., the one-time water utility that has developed into a multinational technical services company.
He will report to Andrew T. Dwyer, who relinquishes the title of president but remains chairman and chief executive.
Mr.
Sokol, 35, had been chief executive of the California Energy Company, a San Francisco-based developer and operator of geothermal electric energy projects.
Before that he was chief executive of Ogden Projects, a subsidiary of the Ogden Corporation.


Sympathy for the Outsider
Pete Rose, who wasn't on the official ballot, was not ignored in the election for the Baseball Hall of Fame, garnering 41 write-in votes and provoking three blank protest ballots from members of the Baseball Writers Association of America.
And not surprisingly, he was the subject of some discussion at yesterday's news conference introducing Tom Seaver and Rollie Fingers.
"How I feel about Pete Rose and the Hall of Fame depends on which side of the bed I got out of that morning," said Seaver.
"It's that kind of issue. But we live in a country in which we forgive and forget. He's one of the all-time greats, and I hope one day he'll be in Cooperstown, in the spirit of forgiveness."

'71 Attica Prison Riot Recalled as Jury Prepares to Decide Suit
The 1971 rampage that made the name Attica synonymous with prison violence was vividly recalled today as closing arguments were presented in a landmark case to determine whether state officials were legally responsible for the deaths and injuries.
"The people who were in authority have to be held accountable when things went awry," said Elizabeth Fink, the principal lawyer for 1,281 inmates who filed a civil-liability suit 17 years ago against four New York State officials.
"Throughout the assault, there was a wanton disregard for the rights of the hostages and the prisoners, and the result was that 39 people died and at least 60 others were shot."


Sampras's New Coach
PETE SAMPRAS, the 1990 United States Open champion who is now ranked sixth in the world, has hired TIM GULLIKSON as his full-time coach for 1992.
Sampras split with JOE BRANDI, his coach for the last two years, after his quarterfinal elimination at the 1991 United States Open and originally sought out Gullikson's twin brother, TOM, as Brandi's replacement.
But complications created by Tom Gullikson's coaching contract with the United States Tennis Association precluded an arrangement with Sampras.


Dow falls 0.89 on a Day of Broad Advances
Most stock indexes kept relentlessly setting records yesterday, but blue chips sat this one out, as the Dow Jones industrial average fell a fraction short of Tuesday's high.
The broad rise, in exceptionally heavy trading, came despite weaknesses in some overseas markets and concern over President Bush's health.
The Dow, after trading higher in the afternoon, slipped 0.89 point to finish the session at 3,203.94.

Hats Are Off to Blues' Hull As He Extends Scoring Streak
His shots did not seem to travel.
They simply arrived, way ahead of schedule once again, in the rear of the Ranger net.
Brett Hull, the human with an extraterrestrial slap shot, performed his light-speed stick work last night while transporting St.
Louis to a 5-3 victory over the Rangers.
Two slaps and a flick of the wrist meant three Blues' goals, and a Ranger defeat that kept New York locked in a first-place tie with Washington in the Patrick Division.


Critic of Patriot Missile Says It Was 'Almost Total Failure' in War
The most thorough presentation to date of criticism of the Patriot antimissile system's performance in the Persian Gulf war concludes that the system appears to have experienced "an almost total failure to intercept quite primitive attacking missiles."
The charge was immediately and vigorously disputed by Patriot's maker, which said the missile had worked well and cited Army praise of the interceptor's performance.
The Army says the success rate of the Patriot's intercepts was over 80 percent in Saudi Arabia and 50 percent in Israel.


Paine Given $900,000 Fine By Big Board
Paine Webber Inc. was ordered yesterday by the New York Stock Exchange to pay $900,000 in fines for numerous sales and trading violations over several years that led to hundreds of customer complaints and millions of dollars in legal settlements.
Paine Webber, the nation's sixth-largest securities firm, was also censured and asked to complete a thorough review of its sales policies.
The fine was the second largest in the exchange's history, after a $1.3 million penalty against Salomon Brothers last year for diverting customers' funds.


Grammy Short List: Many For a Few
The 34th annual Grammy Awards are shaping up as a battle between Bryan Adams, R.E.M., Bonnie Raitt, Amy Grant and Natalie Cole.
Each was nominated for record of the year and a single, and received between 3 and 6 other nominations in the 78 categories covered by this year's Grammy Awards.
The winners will be named on Feb. 25 during a national CBS telecast.
The nominations were announced yesterday by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in a news conference at the Apollo Theater.
R.E.M., the band from Athens, Ga., that brought collegiate or alternative rock into the Top 10, received 7 nominations for its 8th album, "Out of Time," and the single "Losing My Religion." The group had never previously been nominated.


Killer Gets Maximum in Death of Gay Man
Standing before the judge's bench in a Queens courtroom yesterday, his shaved head glinting beneath the courtroom lights, Daniel Doyle spoke of the sorrow and regret he said he now felt for stabbing a man to death because he was gay.
But moments later, the brother of Julio Rivera, the 29-year-old Jackson Heights man who was killed by Mr.
Doyle in July 1990, told the judge about to sentence the killer that while he understood Mr.
Doyle's distress, he had no sympathy for him.


At Feel-Good Event, Most Felt Rotten
State of the State speeches are usually occasions when legislators smile, shake hands, applaud the Governor wildly or politely depending on their party and otherwise take a bath of good feelings, whether they feel good or not.
But it is a measure of the frayed mood of officials here that the pretense this year not only faded but gave way about 40 minutes into Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's speech to a shouting match between Mr.
Cuomo and an Assemblyman from his own party and hometown.

A Guest at an Unusual Hotel


Richard Hunt; Puppeteer, 40

He was 40 years old.
He died of H.I.V. complications, his family said.


Lie Detector for Howe
STEVE HOWE, the Yankee relief pitcher who was arrested on cocaine-related charges last month, took a lie-detector test at his own request from a Federal drug agent in Helena, Mont.
"It's a way of helping everyone in the Government understand who he is," said STEVE NARDI, one of Howe's attorneys.
"He's showing his good-faith effort."


Finally, Bucs Rule Out Parcells as No. 1 Man
In a terse statement that sounded like a spanking, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced yesterday that Bill Parcells would not be their new coach.
Parcells, who two weeks ago rejected a five-year, $6.5 million offer to coach the Bucs and run their football operation, apparently changed his mind this week, only to have the Bucs reject him.
The statement, saying that Parcells was no longer a candidate for the job, ended, at least for now, the confusing, back-and-forth flirtation Parcells has had in the last few weeks over his coaching future.


Meldrum to Merge With Hesselbart
Meldrum &amp; Fewsmith Inc. of Cleveland announced yesterday that it would acquire another northeastern Ohio advertising company, Hesselbart &amp; Mitten/Arocom of Fairlawn, and combine operations.
Each firm has about $65 million in billings and 100 employees.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
"I'm excited not so much for what it means immediately, but what it translates into in terms of future potential," said Chris N. Perry, Meldrum's chairman and chief executive.
He will become chairman and chief executive of a new holding company, Meldrum &amp; Fewsmith Communications Inc., as well as chairman and chief executive of the merged ad agencies, which will operate under the name Meldrum &amp; Fewsmith Advertising.


Benign, but Sometimes Scary, Illness
Gastroenteritis, or "intestinal flu," the ailment that the White House said led to President Bush's collapse at a dinner in his honor in Tokyo yesterday, often causes sudden and violent upsets of the stomach and intestines.
Intestinal flu is not influenza, or the respiratory flu that Federal health officials say has spread in many areas of the United States in recent weeks.
Unlike influenza, for which a vaccine offers protection, there is no immunization to protect against the many forms of gastroenteritis.
It is not known if Mr.
Bush had a flu shot.


Boise Cascade Files for Shares
The Boise Cascade Corporation, the large Idaho-based forest products company, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for seven million depository shares.

Yugoslav Defense Chief Quits; Monitoring Halted
Yugoslavia's Defense Minister, who helped negotiate the present United Nations cease-fire, unexpectedly resigned today and was temporarily replaced by a more outspoken advocate of the Serbian cause.
The resignation of the Gen.
Veljko Kadijevic, in a letter delivered to the Yugoslav leadership in Belgrade, came a day after a MIG fighter belonging to the Serbian-led Yugoslav Army shot down a European Community helicopter over Novi Marof, Croatia, killing the five truce observers aboard.

HOUSEHOLD electrical emergencies can occur at any time, but they are most likely during winter and summer, when circuits are heavily used.
The most common problem is a tripped circuit breaker or a blown fuse, which shuts off power to one circuit.
Such an event is usually a blessing in disguise.
Circuit breakers and fuses -- safety devices that interrupt power when circuits malfunction -- help prevent electrical fires.


G.P.U.'s Chief Started At the Ground Level
James R. Leva became president and chief executive of the General Public Utlities Corporation yesterday, 40 years after starting there as a ground hand digging holes for utility poles.
Mr.
Leva, 59 years old, had been president and chief operating officer of Jersey Central Power and Light, a subsidiary company based in Morristown, N.J., since 1986.
In taking the helm at the holding company, he succeeds William G. Kuhns, who was brought out of retirement last May to replace Standley H. Hoch.
Mr.
Hoch resigned because of a controversy over his personal relationship with a woman who was then G.P.U.'s vice president for corporate communications.

Angels' Harvey Gets Rich Pact
Bryan Harvey, who has played only three full seasons in the major leagues, yesterday became the highest-paid relief pitcher ever.
Eligible for salary arbitration, Harvey instead negotiated a four-year contract with the California Angels for $15.5 million.
Harvey, a 28-year-old right-hander, led the American League last season with a career-high 46 saves, giving him 96 saves in his three full seasons.
He also had a career-low 1.60 earned run average in 67 games.


Stunned Japanese Offer Sympathy As Some Are Struck by Symbolism
President Bush's sudden illness shook Japanese leaders today and spread shock and sympathy throughout a country that had been following his visit with great interest all week.
Television footage of Mr.
Bush's collapse at the banquet at the official residence of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was played over and over, sidelining the details of the agreements on economic cooperation and mutual security steps that were the focus of attention earlier.


Home Video
In 1991, the small suddenly got big in video stores.
After several years of steady but unspectacular growth, the laser disk broke out to become a significant part of the industry.
"All year we saw new records for disk releases," said John Thrasher, a vice president of Tower Records/Tower Video, which has 65 record and video stores across the country.
"First 'Ghost' sold 100,000 units, then it was over 150,000 for 'Terminator 2,' then over 200,000 for 'Fantasia.' " In 1991, Mr.
Thrasher said, laser disks accounted for 28 percent of Tower's video sales.
Analysts say that the disk will never overtake videotape (currently disk represents roughly 3 percent of video revenues nationwide), but that it is the fastest-growing sector of the business.
Industry figures for 1991 show almost 850,000 disk players in use, up from about 650,000 in 1990.
The number of movies and other titles available on disk has climbed to nearly 7,000.
Because operations are still relatively small, disks usually can't be rented, but they are now sold in some 2,600 stores.


Got to Break Plates To Build Tables
SOME people collect art. For 15 years, Holly Lueders has hoarded shards.
The shards date from the mid-1970's, when Ms.
Lueders was making reproductions of antique majolica in Italy for export to the United States.
In each shipment that arrived in New York, some dishes had been broken.
She stuffed the pieces into bags and boxes and carted them along as she moved from apartment to apartment for more than a decade.

From her imitation of Louis Armstrong's voice to her fluegelhorn solos, Alcione is a samba singer who doesn't limit herself to the samba.
At the Ballroom on Tuesday night, she sang ballads, bossa novas, rock-influenced tropicalia songs and a Stevie Wonder tune.
But it was in the sambas, and the pop songs closest to sambas, where she and her band stopped working at cross-purposes.


This Hostelry Charges Elephants $150 a Night
When a flight is canceled or delayed, human passengers end up in the airport hotel.
But what about eight African oryxes on the way to Oman, or a 500-pound brown bear headed for California or a plain old horse, dog or cat?
At Kennedy International Airport, such stranded animals are kept at Animalport, the largest airport animal hotel in the country.
Run by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the port is set on one-and-a-quarter acres just minutes from the passenger and cargo terminals.
There are 24 stalls, 60 kennels, an indoor corral, plenty of bird cages and a special kitchen.


Coleman Suffers Concussion, But Nets Knock Out Wolves
The Nets lost Derrick Coleman 52 seconds into the second half with a concussion tonight, but they managed to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves anyway, 103-97, at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
It was an ugly victory, but Nets Coach Bill Fitch didn't mind the description one bit, especially against the Timberwolves.
They are 5-26 this season, but they battled back from 16-point deficits three times in the third quarter and managed to pull within 4 three times in the final 2 minutes.

Wilder Ends Race for Presidency, Citing Virginia's Fiscal Troubles
Unable to come up with a message or an organization that promised success in the 1992 Presidential race, Gov.
L.
Douglas Wilder of Virginia came up tonight with the biggest surprise of the youthful campaign: he pulled out of the contest.
Mr.
Wilder, the first black ever elected governor of an American state, said he did not have the time to seek the Democratic nomination for President and also to run the state of Virginia, which faces its worst budget crisis in half a century because of the current recession.


ACCORD ANNOUNCED BY U.S. AND JAPAN TO SPUR ECONOMIES
In the first agreement to emerge from the summit meeting here between President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, the United States and Japan announced a broad commitment on Wednesday to try to lift the world economy from a looming slowdown by adopting budgetary and interest-rate policies that would promote faster growth.
The aim is to focus the domestic policies of the world's two largest economies clearly on expansion rather than on fighting inflation, with the hope that Europe's leading industrial economies will follow suit and create momentum for a period of healthier growth after an anemic 1991.


Rising Segregation Is Found for Hispanic Students
Segregation of Hispanic students in the nation's public schools has grown over the last two decades while gains in desegregation among blacks in the South have remained largely stable, a study released today has found.
"Hispanics in California and Texas are more segregated than blacks in Alabama or Mississippi in terms of educational experiences," said Dr.
Gary Orfield, an author of "Status of School Desegregation: The Next Generation." The study, which analyzed 20 years of school enrollment data collected by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, was sponsored by the National School Boards Association.


A 1930's Visionary Who Looked Back And Saw Santa Fe
BEFORE the Range Rovers, the howling coyote sculptures and Santa Fe (the fragrance), there was an architect named John Gaw Meem, whose wildly romantic Spanish Pueblo revival houses, built primarily in the 1930's, set the stage for it all.
Mr.
Meem arrived in this luminous landscape of pinon and juniper in 1920.
From 1924 until his death in 1983, he designed houses and churches, municipal and university buildings that married the spirit of native pueblo architecture with the necessities of the modern world.


Excerpts from Address: A Plan to Fix the State
Following are excerpts from Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's State of the State Address to the Legislature yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times.
. . .
New York State, like other states, is struggling with a powerful force it cannot control, a national recession.
As a result of a decade of excesses and omissions and bad choices, the nation has lost its grip on the world economy and that is hurting us in the most fundamental ways.
Businesses are closing.
Millions of Americans have lost their jobs.
. . .
Reviving the Economy
Together, the projects in that new New York plan will generate more than 100,000 jobs, more than $9 billion in economic opportunity for the state by the new millenium.


Yeltsin Goes on the Defensive


CHEMICAL A FACTOR IN MALE IMPOTENCE
Researchers say they have found the physiological explanation for the vast majority of cases of male impotence, a failure to produce a simple chemical that controls a wide variety of biological functions.
The chemical, nitric oxide, initiates a series of events that cause the penis to become engorged with blood and remain erect, said Dr.
Jacob Rajfer, a professor of urology at the University of California at Los Angeles who made the discovery.


Talking Deals; Small Companies Try a Partnership
WHEN science-rich but cash-poor biotechnology companies go looking for a savior with deep pockets, they usually turn to one of the giant drug concerns.
Cortex Pharmaceuticals Inc., a start-up company focusing on products for treating brain diseases, tried that route at first, but found a better match with a company its own size.
This week Cortex, based in Irvine, Calif., announced a collaborative agreement with Alkermes Inc., a four-year-old company in Cambridge, Mass., that is developing technology to enable drugs to enter the brain more easily.
The two companies will co-develop compounds that Cortex is now working on that are believed to counteract the destruction of nerve cells that accompanies strokes.
Alkermes will also make a series of investments in Cortex, which could ultimately total as much as $26.5 million.

Quotation Of The Day
"The doctors are certain that there is no other illness or any other problems related to this, that it's a simple case of the flu. The President is human; he gets sick." -- MARLIN FITZWATER, President Bush's spokesman.  [ A1:4. ]


U.S. Will Not Seek Retrial In Securities-Scandal Case
The United States Attorney in Manhattan said yesterday that he would not seek to retry several defendants whose convictions on Federal racketeering charges in the Wall Street insider-trading scandals of the 1980's were overturned.
The decision, by Roger S. Hayes, the Acting United States Attorney, was quickly approved by Federal Judge Robert L. Carter.
The move ended one of the secondary chapters in the Wall Street scandals that involved Michael R. Milken, head of the junk bond department at Drexel Burnam Lambert Inc., and Ivan F. Boesky, a former arbitrager.


A Coach Shows How Not to Win Friends
If his work with Paul Wylie pays off this week at the national figure skating championships, Evy Scotvold will have earned himself a trip to the Albertville Olympics next month as Wylie's coach.
But he might not find himself entirely welcome by his French hosts.
In a dramatic break from the long-standing figure skating tradition of never saying anything derogatory in public about anyone else, Scotvold today criticized the ability of the leading French skater, Surya Bonaly.


Chill Persists Between U.S. Car Makers and Japan
As trade negotiators argued all day and then froze for a moment after President Bush's collapse, the heads of America's three largest auto makers came face to face for the first time Wednesday with the commitment from Japan for the giant $8.4 billion superconducting supercollider in Texas, raising neand the Japanese agree on virtually nothing -- certainly not on how the American auto industry was driven to the brink, or on whose responsibility it is to fix it.
As the auto executives simmered, however, negotiators for the United States and Japanese Governments appeared close to an agreement on Japanese purchases of American-made autos and auto parts.
While the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced at midday today that a basic agreement had been reached, American officials were not yet confirming that.
There was still considerable contention over the wording of the final agreement, and many key details have not yet been disclosed.
Unimpressed Executives
The auto executives who accompanied Mr.
Bush have been unimpressed by a blitz of concessions and new import-purchase plans announced in recent days and they spent much of Wednesday warning the Japanese that failing to lower the trade deficit quickly would bring a hail of protectionist legislation from Congress.


METRO DIGEST
STATE OF THE STATE  RESCUING NEW YORK: THE CUOMO PLAN


NBC and Fox Offer Their Visions of the Future
In the space of 24 hours, 2 national television networks -- Fox Broadcasting and NBC -- offered conflicting visions of the future for reporters assembled at a hotel here for a semiannual series of interview sessions on the television industry.
The message from Fox, which came across in everything from programmers bragging about increased ratings to uniformed public-relations aides swarming over the hotel communicating through a network of walkie-talkies to a party thrown on the 20th Century Fox lot complete with volleyball games and test-your-speed pitching machines, was: "Look at us: we're growing."


Vallone Asserts Control as Expanded Council Convenes
Speaker Peter F. Vallone left little doubt who was in control of the newly expanded City Council at its first meeting yesterday as he overwhelmingly won re-election as Speaker and nipped in the bud an insurgent attempt to curb his influence through rules changes.
On a day of pomp, adulatory speeches, cheers, mutual back-slapping and frequent applause for 21 new Council members, Mr.
Vallone delivered a 25-minute speech outlining ambitious proposals to speed the letting of city contracts and to earmark residential property taxes for the city school system.
He also urged dramatic cuts in the size of government.


A Pledge of Homes For the Mentally Ill
After his administration had given mixed signals on whether it would fulfill its promise to open new group homes for the mentally ill in New York City, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo yesterday promised that he would follow through on his personal pledge to the city to develop 1,616 more apartments for the mentally ill.
But his ability to fulfill that commitment will still depend on the outcome of budget negotiations with Senate Republicans, whose majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, strongly favors a moratorium on opening new homes for the mentally ill over the next year to help close the state's $5 billion budget gap.

Lie Dectector for Howe
STEVE HOWE, the Yankee relief pitcher who was arrested on cocaine-related charges last month, took a lie-detector test at his own request from a Federal drug agent in Helena, Mont.
"It's a way of helping everyone in the Government understand who he is," said STEVE NARDI, one of Howe's attorneys.
"He's showing his good-faith effort."


Bridge
Among the most popular and hotly contested events in the New York metropolitan area are the Double Knockout Team Championships.
There are five of them -- in New York City, Nassau-Suffolk, Westchester and northern and southern New Jersey -- and they normally take between 9 and 12 months to complete.
Winning back-to-back titles is very rare, and winning three straight is virtually unknown.
But this record has just been set in Nassau-Suffolk, with the honors going to Peter Bisgeier and Robert Gordon, both of Northport, L.I., Bob Sherman of Dix Hills, L.I., and Jim Beery of Huntington, L.I.
In the final, played Monday at the New 110 Club in Farmingdale, L.I., they won by the convincing margin of 51 imps against a strong foursome headed by Mitchell Pollenz of Wantagh, L.I.


Seaver Marvels at His Latest Stat: 98.8
Tom Seaver said he thought he was past the point where statistics could take his breath away.
As a pitcher, after all, he had compiled some fairly incredible numbers of his own.
As a student of baseball, he had researched all the relevant and remarkable numbers posted by others.
As a television broadcaster, he had kept current with the stupefying salary figures awarded players in recent seasons.
Still, when the number 98.8 was spoken to him over the telephone line on Tuesday night, Seaver lost his breath and his bearings.


Fast Food Fills Menu For Many Hotel Chains
Guests who feel the urge for pizza at many Marriott hotels now find their call for room service answered with a Pizza Hut pizza, made in the Marriott kitchen.
At the Day's Inn in downtown Atlanta, guests can satisfy their craving for a hamburger merely by stepping through a lobby door into the adjoining Wendy's.


Essay; 'Strongly Condemn'
At 11:30 A.M. on Friday, Jan. 3, in the State Department office of Assistant Secretary Edward Djerejian, at the instigation of Director of Policy Planning Dennis Ross and with the concurrence of Richard Haass, a national security aide, the decision was made to unload on Israel as never before.
P.L.O. hit men had murdered four Israeli settlers in the past 10 weeks, provoking Israel to expel a dozen Palestinian inciters to violence -- a measured and bloodless retaliation to deter further killing.
Now Yasir Arafat was sending word that Arabs would boycott the peace talks unless the U.S. voted in the U.N. to "strongly deplore" the deportations.


Democrats In Trenton Call Recess
Speaker Joseph V. Doria Jr. huddled with Assembly Democrats for a second straight day today, trying to cajole them into supporting a long-shot bid to roll back the $2.8 billion in taxes they voted in 19 months ago.
But after a two-hour Democratic caucus, Mr.
Doria returned to the floor and called for a recess until Thursday, when he said he would try again to bring the tax plan up for a vote.


Intel Moves To Cut Price Of 386 Chip
The Intel Corporation said today that it would cut the price of its 386 microprocessors by up to 35 percent starting in April, a move that could intensify its bitter microprocessor battle with Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
Intel officials said a 386-DX chip operating at a frequency of 25 megahertz, or millions of cycles a second, would drop to $99, from $152, and a 386-SX, operating at 20 megahertz, would drop to $59, from $82.50.

Knox to Coach Rams
What goes around comes around these days in the National Football League.
CHUCK KNOX, the once and former head coach of the Los Angeles Rams, yesterday returned to the Rams as head coach and vice president, and BILL WALSH is almost certain to go back to the San Franciso 49ers, not as the head coach but as a consultant.
Knox returned to the Rams yesterday, nearly 20 years after the club named him to his first N.F.L. head-coaching job.
According to published reports, Knox, 59 years old, agreed to a four-year contract with the Rams worth between $2.4 million and $2.8 million.


Despite U.S. Export Rules, Israel Buys Supercomputers
After failing in its effort to buy an American supercomputer because of stiff United States Government export controls, Israel's leading scientific university has purchased two supercomputers from a British manufacturer.
The machines are at the lower end of the supercomputer speed scale, but the deal marks the first time that such machines have been sold for export without the tight restrictions on their use that the United States and Japan require for supercomputer sales.


Don't Blame Ukraine for Sins of Others
To the Editor:
"Gory Anti-Semitism Fills Ukraine's History" (letter, Dec. 20), Bradford Trebach's recitation of pogroms, is highly prejudicial and lacks historical objectivity.


The Art Market
Assets and Debts
For months now, art dealers have been talking about Christie's negotiations with the Frederick Roos estate over the sale of his extensive holdings of contemporary art.
Mr.
Roos, a Swedish businessman and art collector, who died last May at the age of 40, left behind about 2,000 works of contemporary art, along with debts that are believed to amount to as much as $20 million.


Sports of The Times; Ted Turner: A Prophet Is Honored
Guffaws have emanated from the sports pages ever since Ted Turner was named Time magazine's Man of the Year.
That drunken sailor, lurching around the America's Cup?
That buffoon of a baseball owner, out-braying Finley, out-bullying Steinbrenner?
That maximum leader of the TBS sports network, whose staff members would caution, sotto voce, that, ahem, it is always a good idea to reach Ted before noon?


Nintendo Cuts Retail Prices
Nintendo of America Inc. said today that it would reduce prices and start an aggressive marketing campaign aimed at increasing sales by 39 percent in 1992, to about $4.8 billion.
Nintendo has come under increasing pressure this year from Sega Enterprises Ltd., whose Genesis video game system, at $150, has been priced $50 lower than Nintendo's competing system, Super Nintendo.


Safeway to Take $71 Million Charge
Safeway Inc., a supermarket chain based in Oakland, Calif., said it would take an after-tax charge of about $71 million on its 1991 earnings to recognize estimated lease liabilities associated with its former Houston division.
While the charge will have a material effect on Safeway's earnings, it will not have a significant effect on the company's cash flow or financial position, the company said.


Economic Scene; Potential Tragedy Of a Global Slump
THE agreement between President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan to try to accelerate world economic growth gives flesh to Mr.
Bush's assertion that his mission to Japan was really about "jobs, jobs, jobs."
This bilateral macroeconomic commitment, if Germany and the rest of Europe can be brought aboard, makes far more sense than efforts by the President and his entourage of business executives to squeeze orders out of Japan for more American autos, auto parts, computers, glass, paper, financial services and other goods.


Stunned, Georgians Reckon the Cost of Independence
Thousands of Georgians converged on Rustaveli Prospekt from early morning today, some to begin clearing the tangled debris of their two-week civil war, most simply to gaze in hushed awe at the charred ruin of their most cherished boulevard.
Bands of students gathered up shattered trees and twisted metal from the square in front of the monumental Government house where President Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia holed up until forced to flee by opposition forces on Monday.
The building stood blackened and battered, two of its massive columns reduced to twisted reinforcing rods.


Art in Review
Michael Chandler  Salvatore Ala Gallery 560 Broadway (at Prince Street) SoHo Through Feb. 1
Michael Chandler's art is becoming more assured and persuasive.
The latest abstractions by this American painter are rendered in the somber, sometimes murky palette he favors, but many of them are shot through with flashes of vivid color.
Broad, looping, widely spaced brushstrokes, which recall the very different styles of Willem de Kooning and Gerhard Richter, crisscross the canvases.
They often evoke thick grasses through which a viewer peers at ground level.
Landscapes of one kind or another are implicit in almost all of the 15 works in the show.


BUSH IN JAPAN: Bush's Painful Trip; Japanese Feel the Talks Will Not Help U.S. Economy or Rapport With Tokyo
As President Bush's grueling trade mission in Asia ended this morning on a note of confusion and discord, perhaps the reason was that without realizing it, the participants in Japan had given birth to the first summit meeting between rival superpowers in the post-cold-war era.
All the old trappings of past confrontations between the Soviet Union and the United States were in Tokyo this week -- talks that churned past midnight, fact sheets, briefing sessions, dueling news conferences and a chorus of angry assertions and counterassertions of deception and bad faith.


Critic's Notebook; Political Premonitions Born of 30's Despair
THE Archangel Gabriel is said to have foretold the birth of John the Baptist and, a little later, to have made the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary.
It is the gospel according to Gregory LaCava, in his astonishing 1933 film, "Gabriel Over the White House," that, a couple of milleniums later, Gabriel takes command of the United States during the darkest months of the Great Depression.
The conceit of this woozily prescient neo-fascist Hollywood movie is that God, funneling His wishes through an off-screen Gabriel, transforms the fictitious Judd Hammond (Walter Huston), the party hack just elected President, into an iron-fisted if benevolent dictator who saves America from the worst economic crisis in its history.


Art in Review
'From the Studio: Artists in Residence 1990-1991'  Studio Museum in Harlem 144 West 125th Street Through March 1
In this annual show -- the 22d of its kind at the Studio Museum -- two of the three artists in residence favor a crafts-based esthetic.
Eve Sandler's unstretched paintings and wall hangings use a rich set of ingredients, including ground glass, powdered metals and glitter on muslin, to create a crackled, iridescent skin.
The titles imply that some of these hangings are meant to represent empty garments: shrouds in one case, regal attire in another.
The results have a certain material splendor, although the work relies a little too heavily on gorgeousness for its effect.


Review/Art; Abstraction: A Trend That May Be Coming Back
The art world does not move in mysterious ways; its attention jumps predictably from one trend to the next.
It should surprise no one that, after several years in which sculpture, installation art and various forms of political art have dominated the contemporary scene, a supposed resurgence of abstract painting has become a fashionable notion in this sluggish art season.
A genuinely new painting movement would be a great thing right now, giving to the scene a focus and maybe even perking up the market, although it is curious that contemporary painting is forever being described as either dying or undergoing a revival.
Its persistence is rarely acknowledged, even though thousands of artists pursue the medium year in and year out.


In Florida Courts, 'Rebates' Can Follow Acquittals
One month after William K. Smith was acquitted of rape charges, officials of Palm Beach County, Fla., are waiting for his lawyers to send them a bill for some of his defense costs.
That would not happen if Mr.
Smith had been tried in some other state.
Only Florida, apparently, allows defendants who have been acquitted to apply for recovery of expenses like the hiring of expert witnesses.
Such a right of reimbursement has existed there since 1846, the year after Florida entered the Union.


Barring Gangs From Park Raises Some Legal Issues
The young woman took her two children for a quick stroll through Las Palmas Park today, an act that, not long ago, would have been unthinkable, she said.
She looked about nervously, as if fearing the imminent return of the gangs and their turf war.
She also refused to give her full name, explaining that while the gangs had abandoned the park, they had not left town.


Tourists, the Peacetime Target Of a Shipful of Military Magic
PERHAPS the most comical sight at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum is the people lined up in front of a ring about three times the size of a toilet seat.
Some stand and stare at the ring as if it were Mike Tyson wearing light gloves and a sneer.
The task before them is to wriggle through it.
If they succeed -- and even most chubbies seem to -- they will be admitted to what is billed as "the world's only guided missile submarine open to the public." Inside, there will be hatches of roughly the same size to squirm through.


How to Buy 20 Tokens
To the Editor:
In "Let Bridge Commuters Buy 20 Tokens at a Time" (letter, Dec. 20), Josh Stern laments not being able to buy a 20-pack of tokens at a Triborough Bridge Authority crossing.
He tells of a $2.10 "penalty" for buying two rolls of nine tokens each.


Judge's Racial Remarks Leave Town in Turmoil
Inflammatory remarks by the top state judge here have provoked racial tensions that local officials and community leaders are trying to ease, with only limited success so far.
Demonstrators opposing Chief Judge John E. Santora Jr. of the Fourth Judicial Circuit, with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson at their head last weekend, have taken to the streets and are picketing daily outside the Duval County Courthouse.
So are those who say the judge was merely exercising his constitutional right of free speech.
Civic organizations and the local government have developed internal splits over how best to handle the matter.


U.S. Fills Post on Missing From Vietnam War
The Bush Administration today named the nation's first Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for P.O.W.-M.I.A.
Affairs, according to a Congressional announcement.
The nominee, Alan C. Ptak, is deputy staff director of a Senate Select Committee set up last year to reopen investigations into the issue of Americans missing since the Vietnam War.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced the creation of the Pentagon post in September, citing new information becoming available to help resolve the fate of the 2,267 Americans still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.
For more than a year, there has been rising public pressure to re-examine the issue, on which progress must be made before the Administration will lift an economic embargo on Vietnam and move toward the establishment of diplomatic relations.


Eavesdropping: A Sly, Secret Sport in a Wide Open City
HE ordered carrot cake and a cappuccino.
He asked for a small pot of tea.
They squabbled briefly over who would call the baby sitter.
By the time he got back to their table -- two, at most three, feet from mine -- she had already begun to cry.
"You are not going to do this, David," she said softly, more as a question than an edict.
"The girls need a father. You need to grow up."


Lost in Tokyo
Personal diplomacy is one of George Bush's great strengths as President.
Car salesmanship obviously is not.
His three-and-a-half-day visit to Japan, interrupted by a frightening bout of stomach flu, was a fiasco.
For domestic political reasons, Mr.
Bush recast the goals of this trip from designing a new "global partnership" to demanding that the Japanese quickly lower import barriers to bring America "jobs, jobs, jobs."


CHRONICLE
His creditors have lined up against him and his social life has attracted a good deal of publicity in recent months, but DONALD J. TRUMP'S luck changed for the better yesterday.
A Manhattan judge ordered some well-known tenants to pay him $751,000 in back rent at Trump Tower.
Not only did Mr.
Trump win the back rent, but his lawyer, Richard Golub, said he would now seek to force the tenants, MESHULAM RIKLIS, a businessman, and his wife, PIA ZADORA, the entertainer, to pay the remaining money Mr.
Trump said was owed on the $9 million lease for two luxurious floors which have views of Central Park.
They vacated the premises last year.


Apple's Chief Sees Future In Electronics
Apple Computer Inc. plans a big entry into the consumer electronics business over the next two years, selling inexpensive Macintosh computers and other tiny gadgets called "personal digital assistants" through audio and video stores and other mass merchandisers, John Sculley, the chairman and chief executive, said today.
Apple has long indicated its desire to move into consumer electronics.
But, in a speech opening the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., today, the text of which was made available here, Mr.
Sculley added details about the products and timetables.


'J.F.K.' Is Only Latest History a la Hollywood
To the Editor:
In "Hollywood: History by Default" (Editorial Notebook, Dec. 25), Brent Staples disparages Oliver Stone for his ahistorical representation of John F. Kennedy's assassination in the movie "J.F.K." Mr.
Staples is concerned about what he decries as a trend to present film as history.
He cites Alan Parker's "Mississippi Burning," as well as other films by Mr.
Stone, as evidence of the threat to our understanding of events when "Hollywood becomes the culture's historian by default."


Newspaper Union Under Investigation
Law enforcement agencies are investigating the activities of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity, an investigator said yesterday.
The investigation, first reported in New York Newsday yesterday, concerns abuses including selling union cards and the theft of thousands of papers each day, the newspaper reported.
The union delivers papers for The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and a number of retailers.


Poll Shows Price Bush Pays For Tough Economic Times
Eight of 10 Americans say the economy is in bad shape, and President Bush is paying a clear political price for their discontent, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
But voters know little about the Democrats who would challenge him.
The telephone survey, conducted Monday through Wednesday, shows an unpredictable terrain at the start of this election year: The President's approval rating is down to 48 percent, and voters are evenly divided when offered a choice between re-electing Mr.
Bush or replacing him with a unspecified Democrat.
But the real Democratic field has barely penetrated their consciousness, according to the telephone survey of 1,376 adults.


'Oz' Author Never Championed Populism
To the Editor:
In "No Mysticism in Oz, Just the Populist Credo" (letter, Dec. 20), Saul Rosen states that "The Wizard of Oz" is no more than "a secular political tract firmly based in history and ideology." In researching my biography of L. Frank Baum, I found no evidence that Baum's story is in any way a Populist allegory.


COMPANY BRIEFS
*
Enserch Corp., Dallas, a diversified energy concern, and Tejas Gas Corp., a unit of Hamilton Oil Corp., said that effective Jan. 1, Enserch conveyed all of the assets and business activities of its wholly owned natural gas pipeline subsidiary, Enserch Gas Transmission Company, to a new general partnership formed with Tejas. *
International Paper Co., Purchase, N.Y., said its French subsidiary, Aussedat Ray, had acquired from Stora Feldmuehle the 40 percent share it did not already own in Iridium, a joint venture between the two companies.

Review/Film; Help Wanted: A Nanny, Duplicity &amp; Malice Req'd
The title of Curtis Hanson's "Hand That Rocks the Cradle" evokes memories of Lillian Gish and "Intolerance," while the movie itself aspires to a tradition of cinema thrills even older than D. W. Griffith's mad 1916 masterpiece.
"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" is meant to scare audiences more or less in the way that the patrons of the early nickelodeons were frightened when they saw the image of a train rushing at them.
Audiences aren't asked to think, only to react.
"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" proves again that not thinking isn't especially easy even today.


J.P. Morgan Earnings Rise 41%
J.
P.
Morgan &amp; Company, one of the nation's most prosperous banking companies, reported yesterday that its quarterly profits had risen 41 percent from the period a year earlier.
The newly merged Chemical Banking Corporation also reported earnings yesterday, showing a loss for the fourth quarter but a profit for the year.
The figures reflected the fourth-quarter merger of Chemical with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, which resulted in a fourth-quarter restructuring charge of $625 million.


Georgians Face the Cost of Their Civil War


TV Weekend; A Mother Is Dying, With Her Daughter to Help
Suffering from ovarian cancer, the 76-year-old woman decides that there is no point in dying slowly -- none -- and she asks her daughter to help her "end this." The subject is suicide, a subject that has been leaping out of headlines and best-seller lists in recent years as the national right-to-die debate intensifies.
"Last Wish," Sunday's television movie on ABC at 9 P.M., supports that right, offering an impassioned and dignified argument based on fact and made all the more persuasive by the powerful performances of Maureen Stapleton and Patty Duke as the mother and daughter.
"Last Wish" was adapted by Jerome Kass ("Queen of the Stardust Ballroom") from the book of the same name by Betty Rollin, the television journalist.
At 74, her mother, Ida, is an active, vibrant widow, attending exercise classes, watching her diet and everyone else's and even being courted by a new boyfriend seven years younger.
Suddenly, stomach pains develop, and Ida must undergo surgery.


City College Takes Action On Official
In the first punishment stemming from the nine deaths at a City College basketball game, the administrator responsible for overseeing the students staging the event has been stripped of such authority.
Charles DeCicco, a spokesman for the college, confirmed the action, but would not otherwise comment.


A Trade Mission Ends in Tension As the 'Big Eight' of Autos Meet
President Bush's hopes of returning home with what he called an "action plan" to help Detroit began to unwind late this afternoon, in one of the most unlikely business meetings in the history of Japanese-American industrial rivalries.
The chief executives of the world's eight largest auto makers -- three American, five Japanese -- gathered face to face in a hotel room in downtown Tokyo, with everyone in the room clearly understanding, and no one saying, that the American industry will probably never gain back the ground it has lost to Japanese imports and to Japanese cars made in American plants.
A Tense Hour
It was apparently the first time executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met directly with their counterparts at Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, which together now control more than a third of the American auto market.
After a tense hour, during which the Japanese told their guests that American industry needed to transform itself radically, and the Americans warned that the time was long past when "mere declarations of intent" to open markets would suffice, Lee A. Iacocca, the fiery head of the ailing Chrysler Corporation, finally spoke up.


Ex-Premier Advances in French Race
Just eight months after Michel Rocard lost his job as France's Prime Minister, a shake-up today in the governing Socialist Party has suddenly turned him into the front-runner in the race for the party's nomination to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in 1995.
Mr.
Rocard was not officially affected by the party leadership's election of Laurent Fabius, the President of the National Assembly, to succeed Pierre Mauroy as the party's powerful first secretary.


Advanced Micro's Silicon Cash Cow
Saying it has experienced a "virtual stampede of customers," Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported today that it had captured more than 30 percent of the market for the 386 microprocessor in the fourth quarter of 1991, leading to record quarterly revenues and its highest profit margins since 1984.
The semiconductor company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it had sold more than $145 million in 386 processors, many more than under the company's most optimistic projections.
The sales signal that the monopoly the Intel Corporation has enjoyed on this silicon cash cow, the central chip in millions of personal computers, has been shattered.


Big Exchange Withdraws From Joint Futures Project
The board of the New York Mercantile Exchange has withdrawn from a plan to build a joint headquarters with four other futures exchanges, a decision that has stunted the project and may kill it.
As a result, the city is reassessing its commitment to the project, while officials for the consortium of exchanges say they plan to proceed with a smaller building on the same site in TriBeCa.


Charisma Gets Bumped Into Boards
On Fun Day this week, Joe Kocur, the New York Rangers' designated hitter, wheedled a coach into letting him take extra practice throws at a garbage can with a little rubber football, and during the hand-eye contests on a flickering light board, he turned the room dark to give his teammates better contrast.
In this Platinum Age of Sport, there was something fetching about a so-called "goon" working so hard to cut corners for bragging rights and a $50 cash prize.
Was this standard hard-core jock competitiveness, or something special to this not quite mainstream game?
Five hundred years after Columbus discovered America, Lipsyte sets out to discover ice hockey.
All great explorers are presumptuous.
And the historical parallels will eventually be seen: Both were funded by pre-eminent, expansionist institutions and both were lured by the promise of an underdeveloped frontier.
Lipsyte is convinced that ice hockey is not only the most interesting major sport played within walking distance of his home, but the sport that will also define the end of the American century as surely as pro basketball defined the 1980's, pro football the 70's and baseball the dreamy past.
Ice hockey will offer final closure to the conflict with the Evil Empire because it will be about white Americans and Russians.


Reporter's Notebook; Uncommon Effort Aids Quayle's Common Touch
He ate milk and cookies by the fire.
He dropped his suit coat for a green high school varsity jacket.
He ate breakfast at a diner.
He shook hands with what seemed like every schoolchild between Littleton and Laconia.
Just in case anyone missed the point after two days of trying to make it, he even dropped into a restaurant called The Common Man this afternoon.


Prodigy Picks Successor To Retiring President
Theodore C. Papes Jr., 64 years old, the founding president of the Prodigy Services Company, the nation's largest information and home-shopping service for personal computer users, plans to retire in March.
He will be succeeded by Ross S. Glatzer, 45, Prodigy's executive vice president of operations, the company said yesterday.
Offering everything from banking services to restaurant tips by telephone to personal computers, Prodigy is a partnership of the International Business Machines Corporation and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, two giants that are currently slimming down.
Some analysts say Prodigy, which they estimate lost more than $60 million last year, should follow the example of its corporate parents.


EXECUTIVE CHANGES
*
Computerland Corp., Pleasanton, Calif., a computer retailer, named Richard F. Vitkus senior vice president, general counsel and director of development. *
Frito Lay Inc., Plano, Tex., a Pepsico subsidiary, named Ron Tidmore senior vice president for national sales and channel marketing.


Bowman Takes Center Stage Off the Ice
The United States Figure Skating Association grew so disturbed over recent reports about Christopher Bowman's personal life that senior association officials confronted Bowman last month in an attempt to separate fact from fiction, then today issued a statement of support.
In a sport routinely drenched with gossip and innuendo, these are highly unusual actions.
Today, as the national championships continued, the association president, Franklin Nelson, distributed a statement, saying that discussions with Bowman produced no evidence that would prevent the skater from competing in the championships, which determine the 1992 Albertville Olympic team.


Quake Jolts New Jersey and Staten Island
Residents of central New Jersey and parts of Staten Island were jolted awake early this morning by an earthquake that caused a loud boom and lots of shaking but no reports of damage or injury.
Lights went on all over Middlesex and Monmouth Counties shortly before 4 A.M., and police switchboards were flooded with calls.
But by daybreak it was clear that whatever had gone bump in the night had cleared out fast and left seismic fingerprints visible only to someone like Dr.
William Menke.


Cable Company Adds Hidden Cost to the Bill
To the Editor:
As of Dec. 1, Manhattan Cable Television increased its standard service by $2, bringing the cost to $20.95.
The increase was supposedly justified by adding scrambled channels, which can be unscrambled by installation of an "addressable channel selector," provided free by Manhattan Cable.


Why Governor Wilder Failed
The withdrawal by Gov.
Douglas Wilder of Virginia from the Presidential campaign has elicited the standard responses.
The other Democratic hopefuls express admiration for their departed colleague even as they angle to rake in his constituency.
But this failed campaign will be only a preview of difficult times ahead for these same Democrats unless they absorb its chief lesson.
Mr.
Wilder's campaign failed because he spoke more in slogans than in substance and never articulated a vision that voters could grasp.
That could continue to happen unless the Democratic candidates develop clearer themes than they have so far sounded.


Moody's Is Reviewing Sears's Rating
Moody's Investors Service said yesterday that it was reviewing the credit rating of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company for a possible downgrade.
Moody's said the review had been "prompted by the company's ongoing difficulty in improving the returns in its merchandising group, by continued concerns about Sears's increased use of leverage, and longer-term trends which may potentially result in declines in earnings from the company's credit-card portfolio and its Allstate insurance business."
Moody's said that $11.2 billion worth of Sears securities and $15 billion worth of commercial paper would be affected by the review.


December Producer Prices Fell
Prices received by American producers fell two-tenths of 1 percent in December, another sign that the economy remained weak, Labor Department figures showed today.
Prices also eased, although by the slenderest of margins -- one-tenth of 1 percent -- for 1991 as a whole, the first full-year decline in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods since 1986, when oil prices collapsed.


Test Hints at Cystic Fibrosis Therapy
Advancing smoothly and swiftly toward human gene therapy for cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal genetic disease, scientists have delivered healthy copies of the gene whose defect causes the disease into the lungs of experimental animals, where they blazed to life and stayed robust for six weeks.
Should the new method prove safe in further tests, the scientists said they could begin human trials within the next 12 to 18 months, thus offering cystic fibrosis patients the most promising treatment yet for their disorder.

Citicorp Sells Portion Of Stake in Saudi Bank
Citicorp said yesterday that it had sold 10 percent of the highly profitable Saudi American Bank, in a move that helps strengthen Citicorp's financial condition.
The deal, which reduces Citicorp's stake in the bank to 30 percent, is one of a dozen or more sales that Citicorp officials have said they are arranging, without identifying the specific companies involved.


Health Care Battle Flares, Now Over a Disputed Study
Two members of President Bush's Cabinet held a news conference today intended to show conclusively, with a major new study, that Democratic efforts to revamp the nation's health care system would increase taxes and unemployment and saddle employers with huge new costs.
But the chief author of the study, which was performed under Government contract, accused the Secretary of Labor, Lynn Martin, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, of misrepresenting the results of her research.


Review/Art; The Video Collage as a Commentator on Its Time
Given video art's family ties to television, it's no surprise that collage has become one of the most popular forms for artists working in the medium.
The zippy editing and bizarre juxtapositions of images that are standard fare on television, whether encountered in commercials or in random channel-flipping, fit neatly with the esthetic concerns of a generation that grew up on the disjunctive montages of Stan Brakhage, Bruce Conner and Robert Rauschenberg.
In a show now at the Jack Shainman Gallery in SoHo, the German artist Marcel Odenbach makes good use of video collage in works that provide smart and timely commentaries on Germany since the collapse of Communism.
In "Vicious Dogs" (1991), the central work here, Mr.
Odenbach sets up an imagined scene of judgment and retribution.
On one monitor, a neatly dressed man is seen being interviewed and then, suddenly, breaking down and weeping into a handkerchief.
The man, Werner Lotze, is a former terrorist leader in West Germany who fled to the East, only to be arrested after reunification; the tape of him is taken from a television appearance in which he apologized for his actions and renounced his past.


'J.F.K.' Is Only Latest History a la Hollywood; Recoil From Bullet
To the Editor:
Oliver Stone, director of "J.F.K.," and other advocates of conspiracy in the assassination of President Kennedy rely on a flawed and discredited interpretation of the laws of physics.
The basic idea, first published by Mark Lane in 1966, asserts that the backward recoil of Kennedy's head, as recorded in the Zapruder film, is positive proof, according to armchair physics buffs, that a gunman must have fired from the front, hence someone other than Lee Harvey Oswald.
This faulty physics is used to make the grassy knoll plot credible.


Devils Stop Hull's Streak to Beat Blues
Craig Billington's goaltending and Claude Lemieux's shadowing helped the Devils bring Brett Hull's goal-scoring streak to an end and keep New Jersey's winning streak going tonight.
The St.
Louis Blues rarely come out winners when Hull fails to score a goal and they didn't tonight as the Devils made it four straight victories with a 4-3 triumph at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
Hull was stopped after getting goals in 10 straight games.


Art in Review
'Artists of Conscience: 16 Years of Social and Political Commentary'  Alternative Museum 594 Broadway (near Houston treet) SoHo Through Jan. 25
This crowded, rambunctious exhibition inaugurates the Alternative Museum's new SoHo quarters while celebrating its 16th anniversary.
Functioning as something of a parade of greatest hits, it includes works by more than 70 artists, all of whom have figured in previous exhibitions at the Alternative Museum, which is well known for its focus on political art.


Islanders Become Futility's Children
After 41 games of the 80-game season, the Islanders are near the bottom of the 22-team National Hockey League.
Barely holding fifth place in the Patrick Division, they are 12 points behind the Devils, who hold the fourth and final playoff berth.
The Islanders are 3 points better than they were last season at this time, but most of the teams in their division have improved much more.
With injuries to several key performers on the forward lines, on the defense and in goal, the Islanders have a plausible excuse for their lowly status.
Few teams have more medical problems and only six teams had fewer than their 36 points after last night's 2-1 victory over Hartford.


Islanders' Victory Doesn't Go By Book
In the final period, when the Islanders stopped playing textbook defense, it was Steve Weeks, a goaltender who has never been accused of having textbook form, who saved the night.
"The main thing is stopping the puck, and as long as he does that, I don't care what style he uses," said Coach Al Arbour after Weeks and his teammates squeaked out a 2-1 victory over the Hartford Whalers at Nassau Coliseum.


On Stage, and Off
Big Deal for Nichols
Whenever Mike Nichols is back in town working on a show, all anyone can talk about is his paycheck.
Superstar directors are rare commodities in the theater, especially in the non-musical theater.
No star is bigger than Mr.
Nichols, and no deal is sweeter than his.
He is now directing "Death and the Maiden," a new play by Ariel Dorfman, starring Glenn Close, Gene Hackman and Richard Dreyfuss, which is to open in late March.
And the deal helps to explain the ticket price of $50, the premium for non-musicals on Broadway.


New U.S.-Israel Dispute on Eve of Talks
Palestinian and Jordanian negotiators finally arrived in Washington today for the next round of Middle East peace talks.
At the same time, the Bush Administration sought to defuse a dispute brewing over its recent backing of a United Nations resolution that appeared to support Palestinian claims to the West Bank and Jerusalem.
Israeli negotiators, who have been in Washington since Sunday, say they are ready to resume the negotiations immediately because they intend to leave Washington by Jan. 15.
Arab delegates have been saying that they don't expect to begin before Sunday.


Conoco Tanker
ConocoDu Pont+ Inc. has christened its first double-hulled oil tanker, the Patriot, as part of the company's plan, announced in April 1990, to replace all four of its tankers with double-hulled ships.
The other three will follow by the end of 1993, the company said.


Money Fund Assets Up
The assets of the nation's 588 money market mutual funds increased by $31.02 billion, to $490.12 billion, for the week that ended on Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.
Assets of the 219 institutional funds increased by $24.67 billion, to $169 billion.
Assets of the 280 general-purpose funds were up by $2.48 billion, to $176.29 billion.
The 89 broker-dealer funds increased by $3.87 billion, to $144.83 billion, the institute said.


No Gaps or Static From These Cordless Phones
For people who find cordless telephones appealing in theory but appalling in practice, new models being shown here at the Consumer Electronics Show, the industry's mammoth semiannual trade show, offer hope.
A new generation of cordless telephones has extended ranges of up to half a mile, not only beyond most consumers' backyards, but beyond those of their neighbors down the block.
Users now are often frustrated when the signal dies out in the bathroom or the bedroom.


Chamber Symphony
The New York Chamber Symphony is to present two concerts this weekend, tomorrow at 8 and Sunday at 3 P.M., at the 92d Street Y, at Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.
Hans Vonk is to conduct Mozart's "Impresario" Overture and Piano Concerto No. 19 with the soloist Jeffrey Siegel, and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 14 with the soprano Elizabeth Knighton Printy and the bass-baritone Terry Cook.
Tickets are $25 and $30.
Information: (212) 415-5440.


GOLF HEADLINE&gt;McCallister Brushes Off Cobwebs and Takes Lead
Blaine McCallister came out of a self-imposed hibernation to shoot the best round of the first official day of the golf season today at the Infiniti Tournament of Champions.
McCallister shot a 65 over a wet and generally difficult La Costa Course.
He had seven birdies, no bogeys and four saves from sand traps.
His closest pursuers were Tom Purtzer, who shot a 66, and Paul Azinger at 67.


Herschel Walker Considering C.F.L.
He has played with three teams in two leagues and now HERSCHEL WALKER may have an opportunity to take his pro career to Canada.
The Vikings' running back, who is reportedly unhappy in Minnesota, has been added to the negotiation list of the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League.
To get the 29-year-old Walker, who becomes a free agent this spring, Ottawa would presumably have to make an offer in the range of the reported $1.3 million he made this season.
Although DAN RAMBO, the Ottawa general manager, is trying to cut his payroll by $800,000 to get the team back under a $3 million salary ceiling, C.F.L. rules allow each team to have one player under a personal services contract exempt from the ceiling. (AP)


Building a Consumer Economy Amid Communism's Ruins

One Contract and Plenty of Ifs
Unless Bill Parcells accepts an offer to coach Boris Yeltsin's Russian biathlon team, he will replace Bill Walsh as the lead analyst for NBC's National Football League coverage.
Well, probably.


Bills Look At Playoff Without Fanfare
Maybe it's because they practically waltzed through the season with a 14-2 record or perhaps because they were in the Super Bowl last year, but the atmosphere around the Bills' locker room leading to Sunday's American Football Conference championship game against Denver is decidedly ho-hum.
The usual buzz that surrounds a team going into a championship game is missing.
There's little loud chatter among the players, who are taking a low-key, businesslike approach to the game.


Lebanon Demands Party Militias Yield Broadcast Stations
After stripping them of their fire power, the Government embarked on a plan today to muzzle the private militias by taking away their radio and television stations.
The Cabinet met in a special session to review new measures intended to check an unparalleled burst of new broadcasting stations that Omar Karami, the Prime Minister, described as "a weapon that can be more lethal than a machine gun and a serious threat to our morals and social fiber."


Mayor Gets Court Order Over Ouster
A Superior Court judge today ordered Mayor Gerald McCann of Jersey City to appear before him on Feb. 7 to show why he should not be removed from office following his conviction last month on Federal fraud and tax-evasion charges.
Judge Arthur N. D'Italia signed the order at the request of Robert J. Del Tufo, the State Attorney General, who said that because Mr.
McCann was convicted of a crime of dishonesty, "forfeit of the office is mandated."


NETWORKS TO SAVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
The three major television networks and CNN have agreed on a money-saving innovation for covering the New Hampshire Presidential primary.
Starting Jan. 27, each of them will start sharing some of its videotape with the rest.
"Each of us will donate a crew each day to contribute material to the pool," said Tom Hannon, the political director of CNN.
"It's an experiment we're trying for the first time in a primary, although it's not any sort of radical departure. It's the same sort of pool arrangement that we routinely use for covering hearings and other events in Washington."


Teacher Shot In Crossfire In the Bronx
A 53-year-old New York City public school teacher was shot and critically wounded by the stray bullets of two gunmen yesterday when she stopped her car for a red light at a Bronx intersection and was caught in the blazing crossfire of a shootout, the police said.
As the gunfire erupted on East Mount Eden Avenue near Walton Avenue in the Morris Heights section just before 3 P.M., bullets crashed through both sides of the car, and the victim, Audrey Chasen, of 445 East 86th Street in Manhattan, slumped in the driver's seat, shot in the right cheek and the left side of the neck.


Europeans Ready to Protest if Trade Accord Leaves Them Out
European officials and auto executives here reacted with concern to a Japanese agreement to increase sharply purchases of American-made autos and auto parts, saying that the accord was unacceptable if it did not open the way for the purchase of more European-made products, too.
If the trade deal hammered out in a week of tough trade talks merely opens Japanese markets to all by removing barriers to imports, European officials said, they would then welcome the measures as an opportunity to compete on equal terms.


Editors' Note
An article on Tuesday about Germany's new assertiveness in its policy toward Croatia placed great stress on an assertion by an unidentified State Department official that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had used the German word "Sieg," instead of "Erfolg," to mean "success." As the article explained, the word "Sieg" has come to be associated with declarations of the Nazi Government.


Books of The Times; Just Why Do People Like to Feel Good?
The Pursuit of Pleasure By Lionel Tiger 330 pages. Little, Brown &amp; Company. $22.95.
Pleasure -- the subject of the latest book by the anthropologist and social critic Lionel Tiger -- is one of those huge, sprawling topics that can easily elude systematic examination.
Indeed, "The Pursuit of Pleasure" bounces erratically around the map of human experience like a ball in a pinball machine, touching, fleetingly, on such varied phenomena as sex, food, drugs, art, music, sports, conversation and the enjoyment people get from gardening, pets, cooking and travel.
"I have tried to find a link," writes Mr.
Tiger, "between campfires, Judy Garland, the Place Vendome, playing patty-cake with a baby, the scent of gardenias, kisses and a good read. I've sought a law of pleasure that might unite such an array of phenomena and more besides."


Fraud Case Bail Is Set
A judge today set bail at $600,000 for Steven D. Wymer, the investment adviser accused of bilking public agencies out of more than $100 million, and Mr.
Wymer is now expected to be released Friday.
Federal District Judge Richard A. Gadbois granted bail over the objections of Federal prosecutors, who argued that Mr.
Wymer might flee.
Mr.
Wymer's assets were seized by the Government on Wednesday, and his lawyers said today that some of his relatives would use their homes to secure a bond.
Mr.
Wymer, of Newport Beach, Calif., has been in jail since his arrest on Dec. 17.
He was indicted last week on 30 counts of mail fraud, securities fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators.

Bailout Agency Gets New Chief
The Resolution Trust Corporation said today that its new head, Albert V. Casey, was given a recess appointment by President Bush.
Under a law passed in November that provides $25 billion for the savings and loan bailout, Mr.
Casey was required to be confirmed by the Senate before assuming the new position of chairman and chief executive of the trust corporation.


On My Mind; 10 Choices, 10 Errors
One year ago next week George Bush took one of the most important, risk-filled and courageous steps ever ventured by a President of the United States -- to do battle against an aggressor who had not directly attacked the United States.
In the last half-century two other Presidents had gone to war against marauding dictatorships -- President Roosevelt against Japan and President Truman against North Korea.
But in both cases American armed forces or a dependent ally had already been attacked.
And at the time there were few who mounted protest.


Donations To Neediest Are for Life
Scores of donations to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund come in not the usual round numbers of $10, $50 or $100, but in multiples of 18 for chai, the Hebrew word for "life."
"Last year I celebrated six young members of a new generation in our family by multiplying the symbolic chai (for life) -- that's 18 times 6 -- and contributing $108 to your fund," wrote Marcia Nasatir of Los Angeles.
"The six are all well and thriving, as are all the aunts, uncles, parents and grandparents. It's been a good year for us, and so I found it possible to double last year's contribution with the hope that it makes a better year for those not so lucky."


Officer's Trial Will Test Teaneck's Racial Healing
The marches and strident voices that gripped Teaneck for weeks after a white police officer fatally shot a black teen-ager in April 1990 are gone, dissipated by months of work for racial healing and renewed harmony.
Now, on the eve of the officer's trial on manslaughter charges in neighboring Hackensack, Teaneck's mood is marked by wariness, by a yearning for a friendlier time and by an uneasy confidence that the rebuilding process will prevent new unrest and survive the trial.


Fed by More Than Slump, Welfare Caseload Soars
After showing little growth for almost two decades, the nation's welfare rolls now surge to record levels with each passing month.
The initial hope was that the increase in the number of welfare recipients was merely a byproduct of the recession that would disappear when the economy improved.
But analysts increasingly suspect that other factors, more enduring than the current economic slump, are adding to the sharp increase.


Corrections
Because of an editing error, the Talking Deals column in Business Day yesterday, about a partnership between biotechnology companies, misstated the Wednesday stock performance of Alkermes Inc. in some editions.
The stock closed up $4.75, to $27 a share, in over-the-counter trading.
The column also ended with an incomplete sentence in some editions.
It should have read: " 'The check that we write today is very, very manageable, given our balance sheet,' Mr. Pops said, noting that Alkermes has about $56 million in cash."


Murray Shiff, 74, Dies; Construction Manager
Murray J. Shiff, a retired construction manager for Tishman Realty and Construction of Manhattan who worked on several major building projects, died on Dec. 31 at his home in Healdsburg, Calif.
He was 74 years old.
He had been hospitalized for heart illness and apparently died of natural causes, but a specific diagnosis was not released, his family said.


Gabor Csordas, 71, of Hungarian Church
The Rev.
Gabor Csordas, a retired leader of Hungarian Protestants in America and a spokesman for Hungarian religious and political causes, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan with a second home in New City, N.Y.
He died of heart failure, his family said.


Review/Film; A Party Is Crashed By a Stranger
Jiri Menzel's satirical comedy "The End of Old Times" offers some of the more sumptuous images of wining and dining to be found in a film in recent years.
Set on a sprawling estate in southern Bohemia shortly after the 1918 Communist revolution in Czechoslovakia, it follows the skirmishes and intrigues of a lavish weekend hunting party given by Josef Stoklasa (Marian Labuda), a wealthy boor who has been appointed the property's official caretaker.
Stoklasa is desperate to buy the estate, but has been thwarted by political rules that he hopes can be bent.
One purpose of his bash is to impress the condescending neighborhood gentry.
No sooner has the celebration begun than it is crashed by an elegant bearded stranger with twinkling eyes (Josef Abrham) who claims to be an aristocrat.
At once grandiose and impudent, he patronizes the men, seduces the women and wins over the children by sliding down banisters with them.
Suspicious of his lineage and envious of his charm, the men band against him and force him into a climactic duel.

The chief executives of the world's eight largest auto makers gathered face to face, all clearly understanding that the American industry is likely never to gain back lost ground.  [ A1. ]


Injured Coleman Misses Practice
DERRICK COLEMAN missed his second shoot-around of the week yesterday at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, but this time it didn't cost the 6-foot-10 New Jersey Nets forward a $250 fine.
That was what he paid for missing an appointment for an ankle X-ray on Sunday and for being absent from Monday's practice.
Yesterday's absence, stemmed from a concussion he suffered Wednesday night after being elbowed in the eye by Minnesota's TONY CAMPBELL in the Nets' 103-97 victory over the Timberwolves.
"I'm going to play it by eye," said Nets Coach BILL FITCH, when asked about Coleman's status for tonight's home game against the Milwaukee Bucks.


METRO DIGEST
QUESTION OF CASH
It is common in the business world for people to talk about profits and the infamous "bottom line." But slowly and with little fanfare, as customers fail to pay their bills on time, many small and medium-sized businesses in the New York City area are being strangled by a simple lack of cash, raising the prospect that still more companies could succumb to bankruptcy before this recession is over.

Cone Is Likely to Hit Jackpot in Mets' New Proposal
For the Mets, the negotiations lack the drama that surrounded last spring's dealings on a contract extension for Dwight Gooden.
The negotiations also lack the mutual mistrust that characterized last spring's bargaining with Frank Viola.
The negotiations on a long-term deal for David Cone, though, won't lack for impact or dollars.
The Mets, eager and determined to sign the right-hander to a multiyear contract and thus avoid the chance of losing him to free agency at the end of the 1992 season, will extend Cone a formal contract proposal early next week.
The offer in all probability will be for three years and is expected to approach $12 million.


In the New York Area, Businesses Are Stifled by Cash-Flow Worries
Slowly and with little fanfare, many businesses in the New York City area are being strangled by a lack of cash, raising the prospect that still more companies could succumb to bankruptcy before this recession is over.
Although it is common in the business world for people to talk about profits and the infamous "bottom line," it is cash that dictates the fortunes of many small and medium-sized businesses.
Ripple Effect
Companies can die for lack of sufficient demand for their services, as many in the New York area have discovered during this lengthy and painful recession.
But even those that still have a reasonable amount of business can also expire if their customers do not pay promptly and they get caught in a cash stranglehold from which they cannot escape.
That appears to be the more common problem now.


New York City Irish Group Loses Parade Permit
City Hall has taken away the permit to run the St.
Patrick's Day Parade from the Manhattan group that has sponsored the grand march up Fifth Avenue for the past 150 years but has barred a gay Irish contingent from participating.
The permit has been turned over to the group's statewide parent organization.
But the city's decision does not guarantee that the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization will be invited to participate in the 231st parade on March 17.


Campbell Is Given New Cigarette Work
The Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation has named Campbell-Mithun-Esty, New York, to replace Geer, DuBois Inc., New York, on an estimated $30 million worth of business that the cigarette marketer unexpectedly withdrew from Geer, DuBois on Tuesday.


Another Marbury Hits Nothing but Net
Oh, how Dexter Wooten wanted to rip the cast from his right arm, slip quickly into a red Lafayette uniform and take a shot at the baby-faced kid with the hop in his feet and the rhythm to his dribble.
If only he could magically heal for this one afternoon, for this trip to the lair of the best team in New York City.
"Let me at him," Wooten said, figdeting on the bench, his eyes fixed on Lincoln's 14-year-old Stephon Marbury, already being hailed as the next Kenny Anderson.
"I could stop him."


Coalition Rule in Ethiopia Is Facing Growing Fears of Collapse
Six months after winning control of this war-weary, impoverished nation, the new Ethiopian Government is struggling to keep its people together despite ethnic conflicts, a rock-bottom economy and a dispirited bureaucracy.
There is growing apprehension here in the capital that an experiment to dismantle the traditionally autocratic central government into self-governing regions based on ethnicity will result in the disintegration of the country.
This danger is accentuated, Ethiopians and Western donors say, as President Meles Zenawi refuses to shed the Marxist economic ideas of his insurgency movement and pushes the peasants and urban dwellers into even deeper poverty.


Bronx School Board Yields to Chancellor's Orders
A defiant Bronx community school board has backed down in a confrontation with the city's Schools Chancellor and agreed to stay the appointment of six elementary and middle school principals pending an investigation of charges of anti-Semitism and other irregularities in the selection of candidates.
Facing possible full suspension in the confrontation, the board of Community School District 12, which had been partly superceded by the Chancellor last month, also agreed Wednesday night to withdraw tenure it had granted to four supervisors who had not completed probation, as required by union contracts.


Talks on Yugoslavia Resume With New Cooperative Tone
The European Community peace conference on Yugoslavia resumed here today after a two-month hiatus, and the participants displayed a new spirit of grudging conciliation.
Lord Carrington, chairman of the conference, said after today's one-hour meeting with the leaders of Yugoslavia's six republics that he had perceived a "more constructive" attitude.
The former British Foreign Secretary, who has seen more than a dozen of his cease-fires between Serbs and Croats broken moments after they were announced, said the present cease-fire arranged by Cyrus R. Vance, the former United States Secretary of State, under United Nations auspices, had made it possible for the peace conference to resume.


Borough Park Woman Is Sentenced in the Fatal Beating of Her Son, 8
In a calm, unemotional voice, Shulamis Riegler admitted yesterday in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn that she killed her 8-year-old mentally retarded son Yaakov, twisting his leg so violently that she heard the bone crack.
She then pleaded guilty to manslaughter for his fatal beating.
Mrs.
Riegler and Assistant District Attorney Sheryl Hirsh agreed to a prison sentence of 7 1/2 to 15 years for a killing that raised troubling questions about the city's system of protecting abused children.
Judge Francis X. Egitto, who accepted Mrs.
Riegler's guilty plea, will formally impose the sentence on Feb. 6.
She is free on $250,000 bond.
Her three other children are in foster care.


When the Law and Music Clash, Uproar Follows
A uniformed police officer walked into the Records 'N Such store here two days ago and, delivering a letter signed by the Police Chief, told Donna M. Smith that a number of the records she sold might get her into trouble with the law.
The letter, also sent to two other record stores here, warned against the "illegal selling" of recordings marked with "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" labels, citing New York's laws on obscenity.


Yelstin, in Rebuff to Ukraine, Lays Claim to Black Sea Fleet
In the latest twist in the dispute over the future of the Soviet military, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia flatly declared today that the Black Sea fleet belongs to Russia, not Ukraine.
Disposition of the fleet is a crucial issue because it is one of the most valuable assets of the disintegrating Soviet military.
Mr.
Yeltsin's assertion underscores Russian sensitivity about the legendary fleet, which was the core of the Russian Imperial Navy beginning in the 18th century, and about its home port, Sevastopol, a historically Russian city that was besieged by the Turks and their allies in the Crimean War in the 19th century.
The Crimea was made part of the Ukrainian republic less than 40 years ago.


A Look at the City; Call Me Juror
Two thousand two hundred twenty-four potential jurors trudged into the courthouses of lower Manhattan on Monday.
I, armed with bagel and low expectations, was one of them.
There was no disappointment for those who expected filth in every room (part of the city's master plan to cut working hours without reducing costs), three armed guards dozing in each courtroom (part of the state's employment plan), and endless hours of waiting (a specialty of all governments).


At the Movies
Exploring Class Tensions
What Jonathan Kaplan found interesting about "Fatal Attraction" was that "the Glenn Close character, though clearly off her rocker, gave voice to a certain rage that women felt." Similarly, he said, his new film expresses "a genuine, palpable tension between the classes."


U.S. Sees Months of Talks Needed for World Trade Pact
The Bush Administration said today that weeks or months of negotiations would be required before it could accept a proposed GATT agreement to pull down international trade barriers.
With the European Community already unhappy about reductions in agricultural subsidies called for by the proposal, the Administration reaction today insured that the five-year-old talks known as the Uruguay Round, for the country in which they began, will drag into the spring on a wide range of issues.
There are 108 countries in the negotiations, which seek to reduce obstacles to trade and broaden the authority of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization that sets rules for international trade.


Sadness and Shame in the Bronx
I feel a certain way about white people right now. . . .
I don't want to feel this way, but that's how I feel: angry, angry that this had to happen. . . .
The words were spoken earlier this week by a 14-year-old black youth.
They convey confusion, despair, bitterness.
Little wonder; he and his 12-year-old sister were the victims of a particularly cruel and unforgivable racial attack.


Transamerica Taking Charges
The Transamerica Corporation said today that it would take special charges totaling $180 million after tax, which will result in a fourth-quarter loss of about $80 million.
The charges are related to a change in accounting standards and to a decision to discontinue some operations.
The company said the Trans america Commercial Finance Corporation, a Chicago-based subsidiary, would substantially reduce its lending to certain industries and types of businesses and liquidate the receivables remaining from previously sold businesses.
Accordingly, it will take a special charge of $130 million after tax, which will result in a fourth-quarter after-tax operating loss of about $150 million for the unit.


Review/Film; Chinese Boy Under a Spell
"Life on a String" was shown as part of the 1991 New York Film Festival.
Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 29.
The film, in Chinese with English subtitles, opens today at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street in Manhattan.
In the imposingly beautiful but slow and cryptic Chinese film "Life on a String," a young boy is enveloped by his tutor in a magical spell.
The boy is instructed to devote his life to music and told that he will be blind until the 1,000th string on his banjo breaks, an event that does not occur until the boy is a very old man.


Report Finds X-Ray Machines Behind Schedule in Inspections
The New York City Comptroller charged yesterday that the city's X-ray machines were not being inspected according to a state-mandated schedule, but the city and state said that the Comptroller's report was based on an outdated schedule.
According to the report by the Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, nearly 40 percent of the city's X-ray machines were not being inspected, with some machines not being checked in more than a decade.
While the report did not document any injuries caused by the inadequate inspections, it did raise concerns over possible injuries to patients.


Israel M. Labovitz, 84, Retired Budget Official
Israel M. Labovitz, a retired Federal budget official and expert on aid to state and local governments, died on Jan. 1 at George Washington University Hospital.
He was 84 years old and lived in Mitchellville, Md.
He died of heart failure, his family said.

'Working'  Artists Space 223 West Broadway (near White Street) TriBeCa Through tomorrow
This exhibition of seven installation pieces on the subject of labor is long on sobering social documentary and statistics and a bit short on art.
But virtue has its own rewards, up to a point, and these pieces are always informative, often disturbing and sometimes rather moving.
The best parts are when ordinary people speak, usually on video.

Trenton Democrats Delay Vote on Tax Repeal Again
After a day of negotiations that stretched late into the night, Assembly Speaker Joseph V. Doria Jr. postponed for a third time a vote on repealing the Democratic tax package, after it became clear that he was still short of the 41 Democratic votes needed for the repeal.
Mr.
Doria had promised a "go-for-broke" vote on a five-bill package that would allow the entire $2.8 billion tax package, which was passed in 1990 at the behest of Gov.
Jim Florio, to lapse.


In Fair Weather or Foul
Ricky Ervins was describing his slippery but solid running on the rain-soaked field against the Atlanta Falcons last Saturday.
Ervins just as easily might have been summarizing much of his football past and his entire rookie season, one in which he vaulted from obscurity to provide the Redskins' versatile offense with another wicked weapon.
"There were a lot of times where I slipped," Ervins said of his 104 rushing yards in the playoff victory against the Falcons, "but luckily I stayed up."


Sounds Around Town
The Parker Legacy
Jesse Davis, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Manhattan, (212) 228-6440.
Jesse Davis is a burning, intense alto saxophonist who has completely absorbed the message of Charlie Parker.
What Mr.
Davis really flaunts is Parker's phrasing, liquid and relaxed at all tempos.
Mr.
Davis is one of the finest young musicians to arrive in jazz recently, and Bradley's is a good place to hear him stretch out.
Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M.
There is a $12 cover, plus an $8 minimum.
Jazz's Jester
Sun Ra, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, Manhattan, (212) 219-3055.
Sun Ra, the court jester of jazz, has a seemingly endless supply of material with which to send an audience on an intergalactic trip.
Tunes by Fletcher Henderson mix with free improvisation, rhythm-and-blues backbeats and just about anything else.
Hearing Sun Ra's Arkestra, disheveled and loose, is one of jazz's great experiences.
Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and midnight.
Tickets are $9 in advance or $11 at the door.
Coleman Plus 3
George Coleman, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7902.
Half of George Coleman's regular working band is playing with the trumpeter Danny Moore at the Village Vanguard this week, so this show is an opportunity to hear one of jazz's more brutal and prolix players in the company of other musicians.
Mr.
Coleman will be joined by the young pianist Benny Green, the bassist David Williams and the drummer Lewis Nash.
Mr.
Coleman never has an off night, but a different group just might push him further in the direction in which he's already going, which is brilliance.
Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 8 P.M., 10 P.M. and midnight; there is no third set on Sunday.
The cover is $15, and the minimum is $7.50.

Autopsy Is Said to Show Maxwell Was Bruised
The French weekly Paris Match reported today that the second and final autopsy on the body of Robert Maxwell showed numerous bruises, indicating that the British publisher was probably beaten before his death.
But that conclusion was disputed by one of the pathologists who conducted the autopsy in Israel.


Critic's Choice/Music; Back With the Brooklyn
The Brooklyn Philharmonic played exceptionally well in its final seasons with Lukas Foss.
This year, Dennis Russell Davies has taken over as the orchestra's music director and is starting to make his own mark.
But Mr.
Foss is keeping up his ties with the ensemble as its conductor laureate.
Tonight and tomorrow at 8, and on Sunday at 3 P.M., Mr.
Foss is appearing with his old orchestra as composer, conductor, arranger and pianist at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, in the Fort Greene section.
The centerpiece of the program is the New York premiere of Mr.
Foss's Clarinet Concerto, actually an arrangement of an attractive four-movement chamber work, called "Tashi" after the ensemble for which it was composed.
That group's clarinetist, Richard Stoltzman, is to be the soloist in the Brooklyn performance.
Like many of Mr.
Foss's other works, "Tashi" ranges freely across stylistic barriers, with moments of mysterious angularity butting up against Minimalist references, eerie sustained tones and sections in sliding pitches.
And the work's clarinet line -- particularly the series of fleet cadenzas in its third movement -- is tailor-made to Mr.
Stoltzman's colorful style.


Excerpts From Bush-Miyazawa Remarks: 'Promoting Prosperity' in Pacific
Following are excerpts from the text of the joint declaration released yesterday by President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan, provided by The Associated Press, and excerpts from their joint news conference, provided by Reuters: Cooperation to Promote World Peace and Prosperity
The U.S.-Japan alliance provides the foundation for our global partnership.
Together both nations pledge to: work together to maintain world peace and security, promote development of the world economy, support the worldwide trend toward democratization and market-oriented economies and meet new transnational challenges.
To achieve these goals, the two countries will cooperate to strengthen the GATT multilateral trading system, reinvigorate the U.N. organization, advance arms control and the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, assist the developing world to promote growth and stability, and protect and improve the global environment.


I.R.S. Rules on Estate Of Stolen Treasures
The heirs of Joe Tom Meador, the United States Army lieutenant who stole a collection of medieval treasures from Quedlinburg in central Germany in the final days of World War II, must pay estate tax on the objects they acquired at his death in 1980, according to a memorandum of the Internal Revenue Service just made public.
The next step in the case will be for the I.R.S. to determine the value of the gold, silver and jewel-encrusted artworks as of 1980, a sum which art experts have said may exceed $100 million.


CHRONICLE
ROBERT F. WAGNER JR. and LOUIS HARRIS have joined forces in a new public-opinion and market-research concern, LH Research, which is to open on Monday.
"I always wanted to own my own firm, and in 1956 I achieved that," Mr.
Harris said yesterday as he bid farewell to his colleagues at Louis Harris &amp; Associates, which is now owned by the Gannett Company but which will continue to bear the Harris name.


U.S. SETS OFF BLAST IN ANTARCTIC DUMP
Technicians at America's McMurdo Station in Antarctica have set off a powerful explosion to destroy a chemical dump, and the conservation organization Greenpeace yesterday accused the United States of endangering the Antarctic environment.
The blast, in which some 400 pounds of explosives were used to destroy a stockpile of discarded chemicals, took place on Ross Island near McMurdo Station on Dec. 30.
The explosion left a crater about 40 feet wide and 10 feet deep and was felt up to 10 miles away.


Art in Review

The 1950's, from which most of the work in these shows dates, were personally difficult years for Milton Avery, though his painting never looked more relaxed.
The watercolors at Snyder have forest, marsh and sea as their subjects, and the whole show seems soaked in a plangent turquoise-green.


Restaurants
Maxim's
Since it opened in late 1985, Maxim's has been a baffling place, with jarring chef changes, style revisions and more ups and downs than a Wall Street commodities trader.
The current script is among the best in a long time, perhaps ever.
With its crack service team and compelling food by David Ruggerio, the chef, Maxim's is riding high.

N.B.A.  Another Cavalier Victory


Pop/Jazz; From Chicago, Authentic Blues Guitar
At 9 o'clock on a weeknight, all is quiet at Chicago Blues.
The speaker system pipes in electric blues at whisper volume; the sudden laughter of a bartender can be heard all the way from the back of the club.
The ceiling fans aren't even turning.
Only a dozen or so people have shown up for the opening night of Lefty Dizz, a 56-year-old Chicago blues guitarist.
Mr.
Dizz stands at the back of the bar.
He wears a shiny silver suit and a white hat with a feather in it.
He throws back a shot of Wild Turkey and snubs out a Pall Mall.
"Well," he says, "here goes nothing."
Unlike some of his guitar-playing contemporaries -- Buddy Guy, Son Seals, Otis Rush -- Mr.
Dizz has never advanced beyond relative obscurity in Chicago into the blues mainstream.
Although he has been leading his own bands on and off since 1965, he has never had a solo recording contract in the United States.
Over the years, he has backed blues giants like Muddy Waters, Jimmy Reed, Johnny Shines and Sonny Boy Williamson; yet he has never managed to translate his sideman status into name recognition.
He didn't invent the duckwalk or the Bo Diddley beat.
He is seldom mentioned in blues reference books, even under his real name, Walter Williams.


Pepitone in Scuffle at Hotel Lounge
He hasn't played a major league game since he retired 19 years ago, but JOE PEPITONE still has his pride, and, perhaps, a bit of a temper.
The way the police in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y., are telling it, the 51-year-old former Yankee first baseman was talking with a friend in a Catskills hotel lounge when five men, including 21-year-old JOHN CAPURSO, began pestering Pepitone.
The confrontation remained at the verbal level, the police said, until Capurso mentioned that Pepitone was a "has-been." During the ensuing scuffle, everybody but Pepitone suffered minor cuts and bruises, according to the police, who charged Pepitone with misdemeanor assault and lodged various assault and disorderly conduct charges against Capurso and his companions.
Pepitone was released after posting $75 bail. (AP)

Denver Airport Rating Raised
Standard &amp; Poor's has upgraded Denver's airport revenue bonds and lifted them from its review list.
The bonds, which had been under review since Dec. 12, 1990, are now rated BBB, up from BBB-.
The rating service said the action reflected ratification of two agreements with United Airlines, which accounts for about 45 percent of the traffic at the existing airport.
The city has been building a new airport to meet growing demand.
S.&amp; P. called the agreement with United "a major stabilizing credit factor."

Shaken and Rattled, Knicks Need to Roll
Having time to regroup before tomorrow night's rematch against the Boston Celtics may be a blessing for the Knicks.
In an 82-game season, it is dangerous to draw too many conclusions from one game.
But the Knicks' fourth-quarter collapse during Wednesday's 99-95 loss to the Celtics at Boston Garden raises some interesting questions as New York continues its first season in the Pat Riley era.

BUSH REACHES PACT WITH JAPAN, BUT AUTO MAKERS DENOUNCE IT
President Bush left for home today with a Japanese agreement to buy more American cars and $10 billion more in auto parts, but the car makers he brought with him denounced the Japanese pledges as woefully inadequate.
Even Bush Administration officials were saying the arrangements, worked out in the long and often bitter negotiations, fell far short of meeting the goals set by the White House for improving American exports to Japan and thus creating more jobs in the United States.


For Children
'Botch: Adventures in the Land Below'  Tada Theater 120 West 28th Street Manhattan (212) 627-1732 Recommended ages: 3 and up Through Jan. 19
Any child who has ever traveled on New York City subways has probably wondered what's lurking in the long black tunnels at night, long after everyone's gone home.
The newest production of Tada, the children's theater ensemble, provides a few subway scenarios, enough to confirm a child's most vivid imaginings.
The hourlong musical, which is spun together with a wonderful collection of songs and heartfelt acting, is written by Jon Agee, the author of, among other books, "The Incredible Painting of Felix Clousseau." Beginning with a mysterious and evocative song (and accompanied by a felicitous jazz ensemble), this modern play introduces two young, well-off Upper East Siders; a trio of young Buffalo tourists, and a pair of young streetwise but friendly New Yorkers.
The most interesting character to watch is Madeline, the Upper East Sider whose Bergdorf Goodman shopping bag and way of walking spell supercilious.
She also has the best lines, like "We'll sit up in first class" on the train.
All the children become lost (it's never quite clear why), and in their meanderings come upon a rat who paints soulful still lifes of cheeses; mummies from Egypt who tap dance, and an organization, run by children, called Botch, the Bureau of Turmoil, Chaos and Headaches.
The bureau is responsible for disasters like floods and power failures; for example, the sassy dispatcher takes a call to short-circuit a water main.
All in a day's work.

Three pictures in the Metro Section yesterday appeared without captions in some copies.
The picture of a monkey on page B1 was about Kennedy International Airport's Animalport, a cross reference to the "J.F.K. Journal" article on page B3.
The picture at the top of page B3 in some editions showed Ted Rivera talking to reporters about the gay-bashing attack that resulted 18 months ago in the death of his brother, Julio.
The caption should have said that Daniel Doyle, who had pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the attack, was sentenced to 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison.


Borg-Warner Names New Chief Executive
The Borg-Warner Corporation has named Donald C. Trauscht as its chief executive, the company said yesterday.

In Florida Courts, 'Rebates' Can Follow Acquittals
One month after William K. Smith was acquitted of rape charges, officials of Palm Beach County, Fla., are waiting for his lawyers to send them a bill for some of his defense costs.
That would not happen if Mr.
Smith had been tried in some other state.
Only Florida, apparently, allows defendants who have been acquitted to apply for recovery of expenses like the hiring of expert witnesses.
Such a right of reimbursement has existed there since 1846, the year after Florida entered the Union.


At the Bar
It has been a difficult few months for Edward M. Ricci, a personal-injury lawyer in West Palm Beach, Fla.
First his wife, Judge Mary E. Lupo, presided over the hyper-publicized rape trial of William K. Smith.
Now Mr.
Ricci, along with four other prominent local lawyers, has been sanctioned by the Florida Bar for improperly hawking their services.
Their ordeal marks but the latest chapter in the bar's agonizing entry into advertising.
It is also among the most bizarre, since what these lawyers set out to do, they say, is be a light unto the nations -- to show there are better ways for lawyers to sell themselves than by painting their names on park benches or plastering them on billboards.


Royall Victor, 75, Retired Law Partner of Cravath, Swaine
Royall Victor Jr., the retired presiding partner of a prominent Manhattan law firm, died Wednesday at Concord Hospital in Concord, N.H.
He was 75 years old and lived in Hopkinton, N.H., and Webster, N.H., and previously was a longtime resident of Glen Head, L.I.
He died of complications from pneumonia and kidney failure, his family said.

A picture caption on Wednesday about a protest against the absence of a homeless person on Mayor David N. Dinkins's Commission on the Homeless described the situation incompletely.
In fact, unknown to the protesters, a homeless man had been appointed and was taking part in the hearing at which the protest took place.


New Ratings For Insurers Are Disputed
A.
M.
Best, the nation's leading insurance-rating agency, has loosened its disclosure policy to no longer require life insurance companies to report the negative footnotes that Best often attaches to its safety ratings.
Best has been criticized recently by consumer advocates and by policyholders of failed insurance companies, who say the company is too lenient in its grading of insurers.
The change on disclosures, which took effect last summer but is only now becoming widely known, has brought new criticism of Best.


Daqiuzhuang Journal; A Chinese Village Discovers the Road to Riches
Yang Yanru, a middle-aged woman who keeps her 11-room house spotless, could have been standing on a typical street in an affluent American suburb, bidding her guests goodbye after a luncheon.
Except for her crooked teeth, and a collar that suggested her man-tailored shirt was made in the 1960's, there was little to suggest that Ms.
Yang was once a peasant who got her eggs from the chicken coop in the backyard.
Now she is one of China's new rich, a woman who says she doesn't have to hold down a job because her husband makes so much money.
She can spend her afternoons entertaining visitors, she said, or playing mah-jongg with friends.


Dow Up 5.59; Small Issues Set the Pace
Stocks rose in choppy trading yesterday, with a number of indexes repeating their almost daily feat of reaching new highs.
Shrinking interest rates still leave investors with few alternatives to shifting money into equities.l
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.59 points, to a new closing high of 3,209.53.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange remained heavy at 292.4 million shares, up from 290.8 million on Wednesday.


Yankees, in Whispers, Replay Who's-on-3d Act
The Yankees introduced Danny Tartabull and Mike Gallego to the news media at Yankee Stadium yesterday, but the attention quickly swayed from the newest Yankees to speculation over who might follow them as even newer Yankees.
Even though the Yankees lavished a total of $30.6 million on free agents Tartabull and Gallego in the last few days and displayed them before dozens of cameras and notebooks, the name Charlie Hayes was being whispered in corners of the Stadium Club because he appears to be the most recent answer to New York's problem at third base.

Dykstra Accepted into Offender Program
LENNY DYKSTRA of the Philadelphia Phillies has been admitted to a first-time offender program that could erase a drunken-driving arrest from his record, Delaware (Pa.) County's chief prosecutor said Thursday.
District Attorney WILLIAM RYAN said Dykstra would be formally accepted into the program at a hearing next month.
Dykstra will not be required to admit or deny guilt, Ryan said, but a judge will suspend Dykstra's driver's license for three months and order him to attend a 12-hour safe driving course.


Official Admits Impropriety in Use of White House Stationery
Former Gov.
Bob Martinez of Florida, director of the Federal Office of National Drug Control Policy, acknowledged today that he improperly used White House stationery to solicit refunds owed his unsuccessful 1990 re-election campaign and made the money available for the Bush-Quayle re-election effort in Florida.
The Governor routed more than $63,000 to the Florida Republican Party for the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign, The Washington Post said today.
The account reported Mr.
Martinez's use of White House stationery, as well as telephone calls made by Graham R. Gillette, his special assistant, soliciting the refunds from television stations that had overcharged him for campaign advertising.


Mara and Guy Among 15 Hall Prospects
With as few as four and as many as seven niches to be filled in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, a list of 66 nominees has been pared to 15 prospects, four of them first-time finalists, including the Giants' owner, WELLINGTON MARA, and the former Raiders punter RAY GUY.
If they pass muster of 31 media selectors who meet the day before the Super Bowl, Guy would be the first full-time punter selected for the Hall of Fame, and Mara, whose father, TIM MARA, was a charter inductee in 1963, would complete the first father-son combination.
The other first-time finalists are the former 49ers coach BILL WALSH and CHARLIE JOINER, a wide receiver.


Diner's Journal
From Theater to Club
One of the more popular new dining and dancing spots in Manhattan during the holiday season was the Supper Club, in the Edison Hotel, at 240 West 47th Street.
This cavernous space, in a former Broadway theater, is the brainchild of Jean de Noyer, the owner of Le Comptoir, and Wayne Nish, the chef and owner of March, both in Manhattan.


CHRONICLE
ABE LEBEWOHL, owner of the Second Avenue Kosher Deli, wanted to express his gratitude to MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, so he commissioned an eight-foot-high statue of the former President of the Soviet Union and yesterday had it placed atop the canopy of the deli, which is at Second Avenue and 10th Street.
The wooden sculpture by Robert Grossman, who once fashioned a nude in chopped liver for Mr.
Lebewohl, is not an exact likeness of the former leader.
It has two faces, one looking north on Second Avenue, the other south, so it can be seen from either approach.
On the bottom is a sign reading, "Thank you, Mr. Gorbachev."


Ukraine Woos Soviet Troops' Loyalty
In an open meeting in the marble columned Parliament building, President Leonid M. Kravchuk debated for four hours today with top former Soviet military officers on the future of Ukraine's armed forces.

Kravchuk what was bothering them, as commanders of the 1.3 million troops of the former Soviet Union who now found themselves in Ukraine, an independent country of 52 million.

F.B.I. Says Los Angeles Gang Has Drug Cartel Ties
A two-year Federal investigation has led to the breakup of a cocaine distribution ring and established for the first time that the Crips, one of this city's major street gangs, has direct ties to the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation says.
Seven people, including two Colombian nationals, have been charged with importing about 50 tons of cocaine from the cartel over a 10-year period and distributing it to dealer networks here and in Anchorage, Detroit, Dallas, Houston, Seattle and Honolulu, officials said.
According to the bureau, the ringleaders were two members of the Crips street gang, Stacey Harper, 33 years old, and Ernest Bronson, 27 years old.

After several name changes since it was started in 1986, the Joyce Theater's mini-festival of modern-dance choreographers has settled on the umbrella title of Altogether Different.

Like Mr.
Warshaw, the six other choreographers who have been invited to present their work are not unknown to followers of the experimental dance scene.


Serbs Proclaim Autonomy In Another Yugoslav Region
Leaders of the Serbian minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina proclaimed their autonomy over a part of the republic today, adding another voice to a Serbian nationalist debate that is threatening the quest for a peaceful resolution to Yugoslavia's violent unraveling.
The decision brought the formation of another center of Serbian politics beyond Serbia itself and Krajina, the region of Croatia where Serb forces have established control.


Internal Battle at News on Union Adviser
An internal struggle among the leaders of the 10 unions representing workers at The Daily News could be the first crisis in the effort to save the bankrupt paper.

A Lonely Table for America's Cup
Few yachtsmen have better reason than Dennis Conner's Stars &amp; Stripes team to see the America's Cup trial races begin.
It has been a lonely ocean out there for Conner's crew, which has been training without a sailing partner for more than a year.
"I can't wait," said John Barnitt, the team's 30-year-old mastman during a practice sail on Tuesday in the ocean off San Diego Bay.
"We have seven days until we tee off. We're pretty enthusiastic. You can practice and practice forever. But you really don't know how things will go until you see someone one on one."


To Clean Air, California Curbs Personal Products
Taking aim at ever-smaller sources of pollution, a California agency yesterday adopted regulations controlling the ingredients in household adhesives, laundry starch, perfumes, dusting aids and other types of consumer products.
The action by the agency, Air Resources Board, applies only to California, but historically other states with air pollution problems have adopted California's regulations.


Narcotics Supervision Tightened After Report Warns of Problems
Supervision of a special narcotics unit is being tightened after a report has warned of "serious problems," New York City Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown said yesterday.
But he added that there was no evidence of systemic corruption in the unit.
Mr.
Brown said he had also received a proposal to team uniformed beat officers with undercover narcotics officers from the unit in question, the Organized Crime Control Bureau.
The effort would be to bring drug enforcement under his community policing philosophy.

Art in Review
Rob Pruitt and Jack Early 'Red, Black, Green, Red, White and Blue'  Leo Castelli Gallery 420 West Broadway (near Prince Street) Through Jan. 25
Whatever Rob Pruitt and Jack Early may have intended by this installation, they have concocted something at the least muddled and at the worst degrading.
In a room covered in gold foil and splattered with paint, a la Jackson Pollock, these two young white artists display posters of the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., Queen Latifah, Action Jackson, Michael Jordan and other prominent American blacks, mounted on obelisk-shaped posts either hung on, or propped against, the walls.
Some of the posters are the sort of psychedelic images of naked women sold in the 1960's.
Music blares from a stereo.


Bridge Authority Makes a Habit of Chaos
To the Editor:
It is not the failure of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority to sell 20-trip tokens, as Josh Stern writes (letter, Dec. 20), that causes tie-ups, but the authority's refusal to separate automatic exact change and token lanes from slower-moving attended lanes.


Women at Work
Much as they might wish the best for Faye Wattleton in her new job as host of a television talk show, many women will wish she were staying in her old one.
As president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Ms.

As the Supreme Court appears to be moving ever closer to reconsidering those rights, so the need for battlers with her passion and commitment becomes ever clearer.


Market Place; Rival Stock Indexes Set for Biotechnology
Biotechnology stocks have caught the imagination of both individual and institutional investors, allowing dozens of companies to go public and see their share prices soar on little more than dim hopes for new drugs.
Now two exchanges are engaged in a battle to see which one can come up with a biotech industry option contract that can win it a share of the excitement.
The first salvos were fired this week when both the American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange announced proposed contracts.
The Amex got the first press release out, but the Chicago exchange was the first one to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to trade the options.
S.E.C.
Approval Seen
It appears likely that the S.E.C. will approve them simultaneously, probably in two or three months, setting up a battle over market share in a market that may not be big enough to support even one index.
Some options contracts intended to match the performance of the entire stock market have been big successes, but those on individual industries, among them computers and precious metals, have been moderate successes at most.


Reviews/Film; Heartthrob Learning Maturity
Sometimes the best thing a movie maker can do is just go ahead and let Christian Slater smirk.
Millions of teen-age girls will feel they're in heaven, and the rest of us at least won't be bored; he does smirk well.
But "Kuffs" carries this to a desperate extreme.
Every now and then Mr.
Slater turns away from the story in this comic police-action movie and talks directly into the camera.
It's no joke to say that this is the most engaging part of the film.
It takes about two seconds to figure out the target audience.
At the start Mr.
Slater and Milla Jovovich (last seen in "Return to the Blue Lagoon") dance around their living room to a bouncy rock-and-roll hit of a few years back, "The Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades." He is wearing only sweat pants, and she is in stylish bright-colored underwear.
"By the way, my name is George Kuffs," Mr.
Slater tells the camera, asking that we not be too hard on him when he dumps her because she is (quite inconspicuously) pregnant.


Yanks, Continued: Sax Is Dealt for Melido Perez
The Yankees, dormant for most of the off season, capped a stunning week of activity yesterday by finally trading second baseman Steve Sax to the Chicago White Sox for pitcher Melido Perez and two minor league pitchers.
The Yankees agreed to pay $1.6 million of Sax's four-year, $10.9 million contract as part of the trade.
Unlike the free-agent signings of Danny Tartabull early Monday and Mike Gallego on Tuesday and the apparent acquisition of Charlie Hayes from the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday, the Sax-for-Perez deal is one transaction that may take years to produce dividends for the Yankees.


RUSSIA BARS EXIT OF ITS BASIC GOODS
Protecting its shaky first step toward the free market, Russia introduced border embargoes on most basic consumer goods today to prevent a raid on its limited retail supplies by neighboring republics.
From now on, a full array of products from meat, butter and vodka to televisions and samovars will not be permitted to move from the republic, and travelers are to be scrutinized to prevent them from leaving with anything more than subsistence rations.

Olympia &amp; York Puts Off Plans for Moscow Building
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., the troubled real estate company owned by the Reichmann brothers, has deferred plans to build what was to be the tallest structure in Moscow, a 60-story office and hotel complex, and has announced a more modest project that would change the skyline of Budapest.
The giant Toronto-based company in a statement made no reference to the squeeze on its resources from depressed real estate values, but noted that its activities in Europe and North America reflected a "diverse, cautious market."


Tax-Repeal Effort by New Jersey Democrats Fails
A nine-week campaign by Democratic Assembly members to repeal a $2.8 billion tax package that they passed 19 months ago at Gov.

Kohl Seeks to Fend Off Criticism Of His Assertive German Policies
Chancellor Helmut Kohl sought today to defuse accusations of a fresh assertiveness on the part of reunited Germany, arguing that Germany is now a nation of 80 million in the heart of Europe and its leading economic power, and has had to shoulder fresh responsibilities, particularly toward its neighbors in Eastern Europe.
He also dismissed suggestions that Bonn would seek changes in the United Nations structure allowing it a permanent Security Council seat.


Japan Pact Computer Gains Seen
A trade agreement reached during President Bush's Asian trip could result in as much as $2 billion a year in extra sales of American computers in Japan, computer executives said today.
The agreement between Japan and the United States, overshadowed by a confrontation over automobiles, aims to increase sales of non-Japanese computers to Japanese Government agencies and state-owned companies.
The agreement for the computer industry stands in contrast to the outcome of the talks over autos, which are widely viewed as having disappointed the American companies.


The Chief at Ratners Resigns as Chairman
Gerald I. Ratner, who built Ratners Group P.L.C. into the largest jewelry retailer in Britain and No. 2 in the United States, resigned yesterday as chairman but remained chief executive.
The new chairman is James McAdam, 61 years old, who retired in June as deputy chairman and chief operating officer of Coats Viyella P.L.C., a textile and apparel manufacturer and retailer.
Described by one banker as "a down-to-earth Scot," Mr.

Angered by the Oliver Stone film suggesting a coverup in the killing of President John F. Kennedy, the Congressman who headed the House inquiry into the assassination says he is now willing to consider recommending that the panel's secret files be opened.
In an interview on Thursday, the lawmaker, Representative Louis Stokes, said the movie, "J.F.K.," had attacked the integrity of House investigators and thereby offended him.


Carroll Staying With Jets
Jets defensive coordinator Pete Carroll is now 0-2 against Dennis Green in head-to-head competition for coaching jobs.
Green, who was named head coach of the Minnesota Vikings yesterday, and Carroll were both candidates for the coaching job at Stanford two years ago and Green won the job.
Earlier this week, Carroll and Green were the two top candidates for the Minnesota job, before it was given to Green.
"I don't want this to be a two-out-of-three deal; I want to go four out of seven with this guy," Carroll quipped.


Selection of Communist Stirs Confusion in Haiti
When diplomats announced an agreement Wednesday between the deposed President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and legislators over the choice of a Prime Minister who would form a new government and pave the way for the President's return, many who supported the deal described the man chosen, Rene Theodore, a longtime Communist, as a level-headed moderate.
But for many others from the conservative elite to rank-and-file soldiers who have been steeped in the cold war, a greater sense of confusion rather than conclusion hung in the air over Haiti's three-month-old political crisis.


New Arts School for Bard

Music in Review
Song in Music Merkin Concert Hall
As concert series titles go, Song in Music is one of the more peculiar, if not downright awkward.
Its point is that Zaidee Parkinson, the pianist who started the series in 1980, has an abiding interest in the vocal literature and likes to present programs that include songs side by side with instrumental works in which the singing impulse is strong.


Bill Naughton, 81, a British Playwright Who Created 'Alfie'

Surgery for Conacher
PAT CONACHER of the Devils underwent surgery for a hernia in Montreal on Thursday and he will be out for at least a month.
Conacher's ailment was originally diagnosed as a groin injury and later as a torn muscle in his stomach.
The hernia was discovered after he was sent to a stomach specialist in Montreal.


High Court to Weigh Trial Of Suspect Abducted to U.S.
In a case fraught with implications for international relations as well as criminal law, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the Federal Government may put on trial a suspect kidnapped from a foreign country in violation of an extradition treaty.
The Court agreed to hear an appeal by the Bush Administration in the case of Dr.
Humberto Alvarez Machain, a Mexian gynecologist who is a suspect in the 1985 murder of an American drug agent in Guadalajara, Mexico.


A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, but Maybe Not for Long
They hide acorns from squirrels.
They plant spindly little tulip trees next to Norway maples (and later cut the maples down).
They chain saw groves of ailanthus trees of "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" fame and eradicate jungles of porcelainberry and oriental bittersweet.
It looks like destruction, but it's restoration.
Over the years, New York City's forests -- yes, 5,000 acres still exist -- have become home to exotic species that in many cases have overwhelmed the native ones.
City foresters are now trying to bring the native ones back.


Sparkling Performance Puts Bowman in First
Skating as if he were insulated from the world and impervious to the suggestions of problems in his personal life, Christopher Bowman delivered a typically radiant performance today to finish first in the men's original program at the national figure skating championships.
Later, the same three who swept the medals at the 1991 nationals and world championships led the women's competition, although the order was slightly -- and surprisingly -- different.
Kristi Yamaguchi, who won the world title last year after Tonya Harding beat her at the nationals, held the lead on the strength of an elegant performance not at all unexpected.
But Nancy Kerrigan, who was third in both the nationals and worlds, held second as Harding managed only third after injuring her ankle earlier in the day and botching a triple-axel jump she normally lands.

The "Imperfect Pitch" (Topics item, Dec. 26) attributed to The (London) Observer because of its 1791 obituary notice calling Mozart a "German composer" was more in tune with reality than its 1991 editors (who now call him an "Austrian composer") seem to realize.
This is because Salzburg did not become part of Austria until years after Mozart's death, and the city had been bound by historical and ecclesiastical connections to Bavaria (in what we now call Germany) since the ninth century.


2 Girls Are Target of Bias Attack, the Police Say
In an incident the police said was bias-related, two 14-year-old girls, one black and the other white, were attacked yesterday by a group of as many 30 black youths in Brooklyn.
And in the Bronx last night, the police charged a 15-year-old black girl with participating in two bias attacks last Wednesday.

Dow Off by 10.07 for Day and 2.02 in Week
Stock prices fell moderately across the market yesterday, canceling out the small gains that had nudged blue chips to two records this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 10.07 points, to 3,199.46, ending the week 2.02 short of where it began.
The drop followed a stronger-than-expected rise in the non-farm payroll numbers for last month.
This was seen by investors as bad for the market, because it dimmed hopes of further interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
Low rates have done much to fuel the recent rally, because they give investors few good alternatives to putting their cash into equities.


Dinkins Postpones Presentation of Preliminary Budget for City
The Dinkins administration will postpone presenting New York City's preliminary budget for the coming fiscal year until Jan. 30, from next Thursday, in order to have more time to craft details and better judge the effects of the state budget to be proposed on Jan. 21.
Besides outlining the deep spending cuts needed to balance the budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1, the Mayor's plan will also show how he proposes to close projected gaps between revenues and expenses of at least $7 billion over the next four years, and has been eagerly awaited by fiscal monitors and community groups.


BUSINESS DIGEST
The Economy
The U.S. unemployment rate climbed to a 5 1/2-year high of 7.1 percent in December, with the bulk of the rise among people discharged from their latest job with little prospect of recall, the Labor Dept. said.
Long-term unemployment also rose substantially as the ranks of those out of work swelled by 289,000, to 8.9 million, the highest in nearly eight years.
As discouraging as much of the report was, many private analysts said it did not point to significant fresh deterioration in the economy last month, but mainly reflected a continued lack of growth.  [ Page 1. ]

Link Economic Aid to Military Limits
When some 60 countries meet here later this month to discuss aid for the former Soviet republics, they should link long-term economic and technical assistance to progress in shifting priorities from the military to economic development.
This demand would not be unprecedented: lenders to some third-world countries have started to put such conditions on their aid.
Although 11 of the new republics agreed last month as members of the Commonwealth of Independent States to a unified nuclear command and a timetable for destroying or removing nuclear weapons from Belarus (the former Byelorussia) and Ukraine, substantial uncertainties remain.


Prison Said to Transfer Barry After a Hearing
Marion S. Barry Jr., the former Washington Mayor, was transferred tonight from a minimum-security prison after a hearing into accusations that a female visitor performed a sex act on him, his lawyer said.
The lawyer, Sa'Ad El-Amin, said the transfer, which took place shortly after 9 p.m., indicated prison officials had found a basis for the accusations.
Officials at the Federal Bureau of Prisons could not be reached for comment.


N.F.L. Gets 2d Black Head Coach
Dennis Green of Stanford, a football coach with a flair for inspiring his teams to play over their heads, was named head coach of the Minnesota Vikings yesterday, replacing the retiring Jerry Burns and becoming only the second black head coach in the National Football League.
Other teams also moved to fill coaching vacancies: Sam Wyche, the recently departed Cincinnati Bengals coach, was named head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Green Bay officials continued negotiations to obtain the 49ers' offensive coordinator, Mike Holmgren, as the Packers' head coach.
And the Indianapolis Colts were reportedly on the verge of naming Buddy Ryan, former head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, to replace Rick Venturi.

Appeals Court Eases Rules on Genetic Evidence
A Federal appeals court in Manhattan yesterday made it easier to admit evidence based on human genetic material in criminal trials, holding that more restrictive rules on the use of such evidence imposed by other state and Federal courts were not necessary.
The unanimous ruling by three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was described by some legal experts as the first clear-cut guidance from the Federal appellate bench on the use of DNA "fingerprinting," as the new procedure is called.


Proposed Arts Complex Gets $2.5 Million
The New Jersey Performing Arts Center has received a $2.5 million donation for its proposed arts complex in Newark.
The gift, from the Victoria Foundation of Montclair, N.J., is the largest single commitment ever made by the foundation.
The donation, which the center announced on Thursday, is the sixth of $1 million or more the project has received.
Among the other donors have been the Samuel I.

Yes, Christmas, Hanukkah and Sun God Myths Are Connected; Why These Symbols?
To the Editor:
Simon Schama's "Whose Tree Is It Anyway? (Op-Ed, Dec. 24) is a comforting Christmas carol, but in no way an accurate account of Christmas symbolism. Professor Schama would have us believe that the tree and lights are a "stubborn survival through the millennia of pagan rituals of winter light and rebirth," that they "stem essentially from the same eternal craving for the pyramid of light to herald the return of the sun" as has forever moved humankind.


'Moynihan Report' Sounded a Call for Help
To the Editor:
Most of us who read the so-called "Moynihan Report," which is discussed in "A Misogynist Work" (letter, Dec. 26), when it was issued saw in it a call for society to show both compassion and self-interest, by addressing the needs of a growing segment of black society.


Teacher Near Death as School Surveys the Violence Around It
As a Bronx teacher wounded in a city gunfight tottered perilously close to death yesterday, her students and colleagues at Junior High School 22 appeared shocked and angry that the violence that surrounds them had claimed one of their most stubborn advocates.
Audrey Chasen, the 53-year-old teacher who was caught in the crossfire between two men who had been arguing over a woman, was surviving on a life support system, said Dr.
William Stahl, the chief of surgery at Lincoln Hospital, who had operated on Ms.
Chasen.


Venezuela in Step to Raise Oil Price
Reacting to the recent tumble in oil prices, Venezuela cut its production by about 2 percent yesterday and said it hoped others would follow.
The move pushed the price of oil up slightly on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but analysts said that the price in coming weeks would depend on two bigger factors: the outcome of negotiations between the United Nations and Iraq on conditions for Iraq to resume exports, and the position of Saudi Arabia at a meeting next month of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.


Ad Drop Forces Closing of New York Woman
New York Woman, a lively life-style magazine for young urban sophisticates, ceased publication yesterday, a victim of the decline in local retail advertising.
"It breaks my heart," said Thomas Ryder, president of the American Express Publishing Corporation, the magazine's parent.
"It's one of the best magazines I have ever been associated with."


How to Learn From the Best
Bob Beattie has been watching top-level ski racers for more than 30 years, first at the collegiate level, then as coach of the United States team and, most recently, as a sports commentator for ABC-TV and ESPN.
He certainly knows what good ski racing looks like, but when asked what recreational skiers could learn from watching elite-level racers on television, he was skeptical.
"From downhill you won't learn much," he said.
"Those guys are doing something very different from recreational skiing. It's thrilling to watch, but I wouldn't do it. Besides, many recreational skiers are already going too fast. They can't stop or turn and they are dangerous to themselves and others on the slopes."

U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASES TO 7.1%, WORST IN 5 1/2 YEARS
The nation's unemployment rate climbed to a five-and-a-half-year high of 7.1 percent in December, with the bulk of the rise occurring among people discharged from their latest job with little prospect of recall, the Labor Department reported today.
Long-term unemployment also rose substantially as the ranks of those out of work swelled by 289,000, to 8.9 million, the highest in nearly eight years.


Corrections
An article by The Associated Press on Jan. 1 about a lawsuit against New Jersey's Chief Justice, Robert Wilentz, referred incorrectly to a Federal appeals court ruling.
The suit, which contended that Justice Wilentz violated the First Amendment by barring the filming of a scene from "The Bonfire of the Vanities" in the Essex County courthouse in Newark, was dismissed on procedural grounds.
There was no finding on whether Justice Wilentz had acted properly.


Give the City's Riders a Break
The choice the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board faced on Dec. 31 -- to raise subway and bus fares from $1.15 to $1.25 or risk serious financial and operating difficulties for the Transit Authority -- highlights the need for long-term changes in how our mass-transit system is financed.
The Transit Authority's continuing financial difficulties can be substantially solved by a more equitable distribution of the surplus toll revenues of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which, like the Transit Authority, is a division of the M.T.A.
The Triborough Authority operates seven toll bridges and two tunnels in New York City, and a portion of the toll revenues from them have supported mass transit since 1967.

An almost palpable sense of expectation and weariness has gripped the courtroom here where one of the final chapters in the story of the 1971 Attica prison insurrection is being played out.
Many of the major legal players have spent most of their professional lives involved with this case, which went to the jury on Thursday and which will determine whether four New York State officials are liable for deaths and injuries that occurred during and after the uprising.


AIDS Crisis Prompts Gifts to Neediest

"On this rainy day, I remember him by practicing the piano and with this check in the hope that his presence in the world will not be forgotten.
"Mark lived a generous and loving life," she wrote.
"The last words he ever said to me were 'I promise you that I won't die.' I look for ways, this donation among them, to make sure that he never will."

Exposure to Agent Orange, the defoliant used in the war, is a particular culprit.


Leadership: Issue Faced By 9 Unions
A meeting of newspaper union leaders on Tuesday is expected to be a showdown in what is taking shape as a struggle over leadership of the unions during the struggle to save -- and probably sell -- The Daily News.
A union leader who spoke on condition of anonymity said on Thursday that leaders of the three largest unions -- the pressmen, the drivers and the Newspaper Guild -- are seeking to remove Theodore W. Kheel, a lawyer who has served as the longtime unpaid adviser to the unions, representing them on a reorganization committee to rebuild the bankrupt Daily News.

Pierre Page, coach and general manager of the Nordiques, said today that he had several conversations about Lindros this week with Neil Smith, general manager of the Rangers, when the two were in Florida for league meetings.
Page said the Rangers made an offer that Page considered inadequate.
Their two teams are to play here Saturday night, although Smith isn't expected to make the trip.

Review/Dance; In Solo to 'Sacre,' Pain, Guilt and a Stripped-Down Finale
Because of its complexity, Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps" usually inspires dances for large casts.
Yet a few choreographers have taken what could be called a minimalist approach to this music.
In 1988, Molissa Fenley created a solo to "Sacre." And on Thursday night at the Dia Center for the Arts in SoHo, Javier De Frutos used the score for his own new solo, "Consecration."

Sunday afternoon, Fontes will be on the sideline at R.F.K.

For his effort, Fontes was voted N.F.L. coach of the year by writers who cover professional football.


Bonn Urges Russia to Restore Land for Its Ethnic Germans
Germany is pressing Russia for the restoration of an autonomous republic for two million ethnic Germans in an apparent effort to forestall any migration to Germany by descendants of people who first came to Russia more than 200 years ago.
German officials said a joint Russian-German commission would meet in Moscow this month, after Bonn demanded that restoration of the republic in the "traditional settlement regions of the Germans" be "brought forward at an accelerated pace."

American Abdication in Europe
Given the collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington is right to withdraw most of its military might from Western Europe.
But Washington is wrong to walk away from its political and economic role in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.
The U.S. is largely conceding the urgent responsibility of Eastern European economic reconstruction to Germany.
That's a mistake.
It allows a fear of German domination to spread among anxious neighbors.
And even the robust German economy will not be able to meet the vast development needs.
Washington needs to provide more economic assistance and spur greater private investment, in cooperation with Germany.


Cleaning Up the Sanitation Contract
The Dinkins administration has an opportunity to right an expensive wrong that will get more costly as time goes on.
The city is obligated, under its labor contract, to pay sanitation workers full salaries for working partial days.
Some collection workers put in as little as three to four hours -- though they are paid for eight -- and the average worker finishes 90 minutes early.
Now that the contract is in negotiation, Deputy Mayor Milton Mollen, who oversees the labor talks, has an obligation to insist on a change.
The problem could have been confronted in 1989, when the city was about to introduce recycling.
Because the Koch administration wanted to get the program under way, it began recycling without getting changes in work rules that define a crew's work by its route: once a crew finishes a route, it has done a day's work even if that takes only a few hours.


Blunt Talk by Iacocca, Just Back From Japan
Lee A. Iacocca, the outspoken chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, in an address before Detroit's business elite, unleashed his most vitriolic attack yet on Japan yesterday, predicting that President Bush's trade mission would not budge the trade deficit or salve the auto industry's wounds.
Other executives said yesterday that while the President's trip might eventually help narrow the trade deficit, Mr.
Bush focused too much attention on the conflict between Japan and America's auto makers, who, they said, have only themselves to blame for their woes.


Russia Cuts Gas Deliveries to Poland in Half
Just as Poland faces token strikes to protest an increase in energy prices that will double the cost of home heating, Russia has cut its daily deliveries of natural gas to Poland in half, less than two weeks after it agreed in a barter deal to increase supplies in 1992.
Mieczyslaw Ratajewicz, an official in the Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday that Moscow had told him that the Russian Government had failed to inform the state gas exporting firm about the new deal.
Mr.
Ratajewicz said Moscow had promised to resume full deliveries in accordance with terms of the new deal soon.


U.S. Cool to China Proposal; Dispute on Piracy Continues
A Chinese negotiating team made a new proposal today as a final round of bilateral talks began here on patents, copyrights and trademarks, but a senior United States trade official said the proposal did not go far enough toward meeting American concerns.
The confrontation with China, over what the United States contends is piracy of American inventions, represents the Bush Administration's first big trade case since the President returned today from a 10-day trip to Asia that emphasized international commerce.
The two sides have exchanged threats to impose trade sanctions totaling up to $2.7 billion starting on Thursday.

Lions Claim an Emotional Advantage
The Redskins are 13 1/2-point favorites over the Detroit Lions here Sunday, and some football people say the game will be more one-sided that that.

"We're an emotional football team," Fontes said at a news conference shortly after the Lions flew here.
"People said it was a love thing. I think it is. A lot of people thought this team would fold, but it has character. We're playing on great emotion."

Review/Theater; A Journey Into a Dreamlike World
While other theatrical experimentalists have allowed themselves to be subjected to the vagaries of change and fashion, Richard Foreman has remained dedicated to first Foreman principles for more than 20 years.
His plays continue to be personal to the point of being idiosyncratic.
They are documentations in words, deeds and images of his own innermost thought processes and obsessions with time, communication and the irrationality of presumed reality.
Because of their abstraction, his works are not entirely intelligible to the audience, which is asked to accept meaning at least partly on faith.
The reward, as in his new play, "The Mind King," is a voyage that is simultaneously mysterious and enticing.
Come with me, invites Mr.
Foreman as playwright, director and designer, into a world of dream pictures.

No More Cold Sweats
Cold weather can turn the most vigorous of outdoor exercisers into a hermit.
But the proper clothing can make workouts comfortable.
Runners, hikers and bicyclists are wearing lighter weatherproof fabrics, with reflectors, for greater visibility on dark days and at night.
Never start a workout program without consulting a doctor, and if you are planning to exercise outdoors for the first time, be sure the doctor knows that.
Here is some expert advice on what to wear and how to layer it for various activities in cold weather.
Runners: T-shirt, long-sleeve shirt, windbreaker or sweatshirt.
Insulated leggings or sweat pants.
Headband, hat or scarf.
Hikers: T-shirt or long underwear, flannel or wool shirt, lightweight sweater, windbreaker, down-filled jacket.
Wool pants or jeans.
Two pairs of socks.
Bicyclists: Insulated leggings and long-sleeve shirt.
Windbreaker and cap. (Source: New York Road Runners Club)

U.N. Urged to Press Libya On Suspects in 2 Bombings
The United States, France and Britain today circulated a draft resolution asking the world to press Libya to hand over for trial agents accused of blowing up two passenger airliners and to pay compensation for those terrorist acts.
In what is likely to prove a difficult political operation, the three countries want the Security Council to approve a text that "strongly deplores the fact that Libya has not yet responded effectively" to requests made in connection with the blowing up of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988 and the destruction of a French Union de Transports Aeriens airliner over the Sahara in September 1989.


Bush Returns, Hailing Gains in Japan Agreement

"We were hestitant about everything because things were changing back and forth so rapidly," Mr.

"We asked guests to wear Russian red. Someone said, 'Now wait a minute, red is not the color of Russia anymore.' "


Chilean Arms Shipment to Croatia Stirs Tensions
The interception of a shipment of Chilean weapons bound for Croatia in violation of a United Nations ban on such arms sales has caused a scandal that Government officials say could involve some of Chile's highest-ranking military officers.
Four investigations are currently under way to determine how Chile's state-run weapons manufacturer, Famae, managed to ship 11 tons of small arms, mortars, rifles, bullets and light antitank rockets to intermediaries representing Croatian forces.
The 11-ton shipment was intercepted in Budapest, Hungary, last month.

Paris Journal; Paris and Prostitutes: Withering Love
Henri Toulouse-Lautrec's oils captured the raucous friendliness of turn-of-the-century brothels, Emile Zola wrote warmly about a big-hearted prostitute in "Nana" and as recently as the 1950's, life on the sidewalks of Montmartre was set to music in "Irma La Douce."
The prostitutes of Paris, it seems, always had artists on their side.
And together, for the best part of a century, they helped shape the city's image as a haven of love, romance and sensuality for inhibited -- though hardly puritan -- northern Europeans in search of carnal thrills and spills.

A method of using electromagnetic fields to help plants grow has been patented by three university researchers.
The invention is based on the theory that the activities of plant and animal cells can be fine-tuned by electromagnetic fields that fluctuate at particular frequencies.
The researchers contend that the magnetic flux can be used to speed up a cell's intake of calcium ions, which play a central role throughout a cell's chemical machinery.


2d Defection At Sematech
Micron Technology Inc., a computer memory chip manufacturer in Boise, Idaho, confirmed today that it would leave Sematech in July, becoming the second company to announce its departure from the semiconductor industry consortium this week.
LSI Logic, a customized chip manufacturer in Milpitas, Calif., announced Monday that it was dropping out.
The Harris Corporation, a diversified electronics manufacturer in Melbourne, Fla., has said it is considering withdrawing.
The defections come as Sematech, which is based in Austin, Tex., is trying to win new commitments for an additional five years of Government financing after its initial five-year charter expires in September.


Yes, Christmas, Hanukkah and Sun God Myths Are Connected

I.R.A. BOMB SET OFF IN CENTRAL LONDON
An Irish Republican Army bomb, the latest in a wave that has undermined public confidence in the effectiveness of anti-terrorist measures in England and Northern Ireland, blew up in the heart of the British Government quarter today, disrupting traffic but causing no injuries.
The explosion caused outrage, in part because it exposed the Government's inability, even in central London, to suppress the I.R.A. after more than 20 years of military and police measures that have cost billions of dollars.


New Jersey Fair-Housing Plan Goes Awry
A bright idea flashed through this woodsy suburb in the Watchung Mountains four years ago, promising significant relief from the state-imposed obligation to provide affordable housing for low- and moderate-income people.
With the prospect of being forced to rezone a 50-acre tract for such housing, leaders of the Township Committee approached the property owner, a well-known developer in Union County, with what seemed to be a mutually beneficial deal.
Exporting Fair Housing
The Township Committee would approve an office park with two 10-story towers, two five-story parking garages and a helicopter pad, changing the zoning to allow the larger project.
In return, the developer would pick up the cost of half the township's obligation under the Mount Laurel housing doctrine: $3.8 million for 129 units.
The money would be paid to Berkeley Heights, then transferred to Newark under a legal but much criticized arrangement that permits suburbs to export part of their "fair share" housing mandate to depressed urban areas.


James E. Hair, 76, Naval Officer Whose Unit Broke Color Bar, Dies
James E. Hair, one of 13 blacks who broke the Navy's color barrier by tutoring each other and winning record scores to become officers in World War II, died on Jan. 3 at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan.
He was 76 years old and lived in Queens.
The apparent cause of death was heart disease, relatives said.


Supreme Court to Review Soliciting at 3 Big Airports
In a free speech case that could determine whether airports and other public buildings around the country can exclude people who want to raise money and distribute literature for a variety of causes, the Supreme Court agreed today to review the Port Authority's policy of forbidding such activities at La Guardia, John F. Kennedy, and Newark International airports.
A Federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled last year, in a lawsuit brought by the Hare Krishna group, that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey could bar fund-raisers but must permit the distribution of literature.

Boy Beaver Foils Experts
Embarrassed wildlife experts in a Denver suburb have postponed an attempt to reduce their beaver population with the long-acting contraceptive Norplant after finding that their first specimen was a male.
Television cameras were on hand Thursday to record the first operation to implant the birth-control device in beavers, which have become a nuisance in the suburban town Wheat Ridge, where they gnaw trees and burrow under paths.


Corrections
The "Pulse" chart in The Metro Section on Thursday, about budget deficits in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, misstated New York's projected budget and deficit for the 1992-93 fiscal year.
The budget is $30 billion; the deficit is $4 billion, 13 percent of the total.


Bridge
Some deceptive plays by the declarer are totally automatic: they must be made in order to give the defense a problem.
A simple example is the heart situation in the diagramed deal, noted by Alfred Sheinwold, the veteran journalist.
In four spades, South has four "obvious" losers, two in each major suit.
He will survive if the defenders lead a minor suit, but unfortunately West has an automatic lead of a top heart.
If the defenders take both their heart tricks South is doomed, since he must lose two trump tricks.


Queens Hospital Seeking Minority Medical School
Eager to see an affiliation between Queens Hospital Center and a minority medical school, New York City hospital officials have contacted several out-of-state medical schools, one as far away as Puerto Rico.
The search for a successor to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, which is ending its affiliation with the hospital, is in its earliest stages.
But officials of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation and a spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins say a minority institution would fulfill a long-standing goal to provide doctors who reflect the ethnic and cultural makeup of the hospitals where they work.


To the Presidential Hopefuls, The Middle Class Is Royalty
The vast group of voters known as "middle-class America" is about to be courted with a vengeance as the 1992 Presidential campaign gets under way.
Both parties are trying to calibrate their language, their policy proposals and their messages to show their concern for the middle-income American with a family, a house in the suburbs, a sense of economic alarm and a feeling that the politicians don't care.


Charles Mulberger, Theater Dresser, 42

Boston Police Partly Cleared Over Racial Tension
A report by a private investigative agency, made public by the city on Wednesday, found that the Boston police were not directly responsible for giving information to reporters that identified a black man as the chief suspect in the 1989 killing of Carol Stuart, a pregnant woman whose husband later became the prime suspect in her murder.
The report was commissioned by Mayor Raymond L. Flynn after the identification of the man, William Bennett, inflamed racial tensions in Boston.
Blacks in the city charged that the police had improperly arrested Mr.
Bennett, who had a lengthy criminal record, and had given his name to the press.


Review/Dance; Reveling In 'Seasons' Seriously
George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins knew what ballet could do best, which was to elevate the spirit and entertain at the same time.
Back in high gear in a new repertory season, the New York City Ballet drove this point home almost casually with Thursday night's program at the New York State Theater.
"The Four Seasons," choreographed by Mr.
Robbins in 1979 to ballet music from three operas by Verdi, may look like more of a crowd pleaser than a work of profundity.
But with the kind of first-rate performances it is now receiving from its principals -- especially Kyra Nichols, Darci Kistler and Damian Woetzel -- Mr.
Robbins's gloss on 19th-century allegorical conventions can take on a higher artistic dimension.


Patents; Yeast and Fungus For Fresher Clothes
Unilever Group, the diversified consumer products company that owns Lever Brothers, has patented a fabric softener for laundry in which a fresh-smelling perfume is encapsulated in cells of yeast or fungus.
According to the patent, most perfumes tend to wash away during a washing machine's rinse cycle.
In the new fabric softener, the perfume-stuffed microrganisms would cling to clothing and release the fragrance as the clothing dries and as it is ironed.
In one of several recipes decribed for such a softener, dried baker's yeast is mixed with perfume in a flask and then stirred in a centrifuge.
The resulting slurry was dried and mixed with the softener.


An Upheaval in Ice Dancing
After three consecutive years as runners-up, April Sargent-Thomas and Russ Witherby won their first national title in ice dancing tonight.
Rachel Mayer and Peter Breen, who were sixth last year, finished second to join the champions on the 1992 Olympic team.
The defending champions, Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow, finished third and did not qualify for the Olympics.
The United States only sends two ice-dancing entrants to Albertville, France.

Savings Depositors to Be Paid More Interest (and Attention)
Millions of consumers who put their savings in commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations are expected to benefit from a provision that was part of the bank bailout bill passed by Congress late last year.
The overall measure increased the borrowing power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by about $70 billion.
Under the law's "truth in savings" section, financial institutions will be required to provide a great deal more information to their depositors.
Among other things, the measure calls for these moves by banks:


Slovenian Yacht Withdraws
The struggle to wage an America's Cup campaign in the midst of civil war has finally proved to be too much for yachtsmen from Croatia and Slovenia.
Sailors from the Yacoma Challenge of Slovenia today withdrew their bid to challenge for the cup.
The team built its 75-foot mahogany yacht in the middle of a vineyard in the mountainous region of northern Slovenia.
When war broke out last summer, the sailors sneaked out the giant sloop through the war zone to Venice with the help of a sympathetic Italian yachtsman and businessman, Marco Cantoni.
The yacht was supposed to be shipped here no later than Jan. 15.
But time ran out.


Views of Bush's Trip From Corner Offices
American executives from many areas of industry were asked yesterday what they thought President Bush's trip to Asia would accomplish.
Following are excerpts from their interviews and statements:
Dexter F. Baker
Chairman and chief executive, Air Products and Chemicals, an industrial-gas producer in Allentown, Pa., and one of the executives accompanying the President on the trip.
We didn't just go to Japan.
The Pacific Basin is very important to America.
It's our largest trading relationship, with two-way trade of about $300 billion.
We are pretty close to balance or slightly positive with most of the countries.
The economies in that part of the world, outside of Australia, are booming.
It's a very strategically important part of the American economic scene.
Some market-opening initiatives were achieved.
I think it was a very positive trip.
This wasn't tokenism on the President's part.
I think he performed magnificently.
The key thing is that the President has created a really positive environment for American investment and trade to flow to Japan.
I'm convinced they genuinely want to improve the commercial relationships with the U.S.
We talked about the tremendous opportunity to work together in dealing with markets opening up in Central and Eastern Europe.
Now, American industry has got to get off its duff and start investing in those parts of the world.
The President has done his job.
The American business community now has to go to work to tranform that to the bottom line and jobs.
Fred W. Lyons Jr.
President and chief executive, Marion Merrell Dow Inc., a pharmaceutical company in Kansas City, Mo.
We're a little different from the auto industry.
We're very pleased with the relationship we have with the Japanese.
We introduced our Seldane antihistamine over there a year and a half ago and we did $100 million of business in 1991.
We go through a similar process in terms of drug registration in any country and the same kinds of marketing challenges.
The problems we deal with are not unique to Japan.
We are very strongly in favor of free trade. Wilfred J. Corrigan
Chairman and chief executive, LSI Logic Corporation, a semiconductor manufacturer in Milpitas, Calif:
I can see how they reached the conclusion that they should take predominantly the automobile guys, but I don't approve of it.
Either the President should have gone on his own, or, if he was making it into a trade mission, I think there should have been more businesses represented.
The message that gives to Japan is "Aha! What America is concerned about is automobiles." As far as the Japanese are concerned the automobile battle is over.
It's just a mopping-up operation.
Their concern is more on the industries of the future.
Electronics is going to be the manufacturing industry of the 21st century.
There should have been significant representation from the computer industry and the semiconductor industry, and I'm sure there's a dozen other strategic industries.
The message to give is: "We're really interested in the strategic-industry balance of trade." George Hatsopoulos
Chairman and chief executive, Thermo Electron Corporation, a high-technology and industrial-products company in Waltham, Mass.
I think the trip was ill conceived.
Looking at the trade deficit as a bilateral problem with Japan is inconsistent with a healthy world economy.
They may need a surplus from us in cars if they buy oil from other countries that buy things from us.
We have an overall trade deficit, but the problem is primarily economic policy in the U.S.
We do have problems with high-tech products, communications, and certain financial services in Japan.
President Bush focused on the wrong industry.
Focusing on autos is taking on Japan where they have a good story to tell.
I think the White House knows better.
Outside of politics, the only justification for looking at things bilaterally is to put pressure on them to remove invisible barriers.
James S. Davis
Chairman and chief Executive, New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. of Boston.
Japan is our strongest trading partner so it was important for the President to go to maintain good political and personal relations.
It's good for chief executives to get to know each other because we are so interdependent.
Greater understanding comes from sitting down face to face.
We just wanted to remind everybody with our ad thatyou can still compete effectively in foreign markets.
I have got to feel that there were other people there who are doing reasonably well.
We just didn't hear about it because it's not controversial.
Don L. Gevirtz
Chairman and chief executive, the Foothill Group, a financial-services company in Agoura Hills, Calif.
As a Democrat, I think the handling of the Japan trip provides the first glimmer that someone like Bill Clinton could defeat Bush.
Bush is focusing on dying industries rather than focusing on newer entrepreneurial industries that are creating most of the new jobs and many of the new innovations.
It was a disastrous trip to Japan in terms of where our emphasis should be.
The major problem we have is that industries like autos have become completely non-competitive and at the same time we have a banking industry that is illiquid and not able to provide credit to smaller companies that are still growing.
Reginald Lewis
Chairman and chief executive, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., a food company based in New York.
I don't think it was the wrong thing to do.
The trade imbalance with the Japanese can't be ignored.
The auto industry wanted his help, and he can't be criticized for trying to give it.
The American consumer is now more aware of the impact on the general economy of selecting a Japanese product over the American product.
It might encourage them to examine whether there is a real difference rather than a perceived difference.
Some of the strident aspects of the dialogue might be unfortunate.
The negatives probably couldn't be avoided because it was a media event.
Some of these problems have been with us for a long time and defy easy solution.
James Koontz
President and chief executive, Kingsbury Machine Tool Company of Keene, N.H., and chairman of the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences in Ann Arbor, Mich.
I think the trip created recognition that there is a problem.
The fact that we focused on the Japanese trade problem may have gotten some of the Japanese transplants to realize that they have to work more with American vendors.
Our company has been promised several orders in the near future.
On the other hand, our problems are not really with the Japanese.
They are at home.
The major companies and unions have to sit down and agree to make our plants more flexible and productive.
The whole trip was a bit of an embarrassment.
The Japanese are 90 percent right in saying our problems are here.
Richard B. Madden
Chairman and chief executive, Potlatch Corporation, a forest-products company in San Francisco:
I believe he should have made the trip.
The President and Prime Minister Miyazawa agreed the two nations would reach an agreement by the end of March that would substantially increase access to the Japanese paper market.
I don't know if this would have been achieved in anywhere near that time frame if the President hadn't made the trip.
Potlatch is a major exporter of bleached paper board to Japan but we have been trying to break into the fine- coated paper market for some time and have had many difficulties.
There are structural barriers.


Go Gentle on Giving That Special Ancestor a Face Lift
For 40 years, the portrait of great-great Aunt Agatha has hung over Grandmother's mantle.
But now the reputed family beauty looks dreadful.
Her skin is yellowish and little lines crosshatch her not-so-rosy cheeks.
Clearly, her face needs washing: not a do-it-yourself job.
It requires the services of a fine arts conservator.

In Spite of Hardship, I.M.F. Urges Russia To Raise Price of Oil
After a week of rising consumer prices and sporadic protests from angry shoppers, a team from the International Monetary Fund, acting with the endorsement of the United States, is pressing Russia for drastic additional steps, chief among them a sharp increase in oil prices.
The I.M.F. wants President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, where most of the commonwealth's oil is produced, to raise petroleum prices to 10 to 15 times their present level, and they have already quadrupled in the last week.


Evidence Tied to Organist
A Manhattan hotel employee cleaning out the room of a church organist charged with stealing from synagogues and churches found close to 20 religious items hidden in the room, the police said yesterday.
Detective Joseph Lesniak of the Port Authority police said that the items included gold plates inscribed to the memory of deceased loved ones, silver candlesticks and other items.
Oather James Blocker, 45 years old, was arraigned last week on three counts of burglary in the theft of religious items.
But officials of both the Nassau County and Port Authority police said that Mr.
Blocker had confessed to stealing items from as many as 500 churches in the New York metropolitan area and other states in the Northeast.


Casting for Car Thieves, Police Net Murder Suspect
The three-month sting investigation of car-theft rings was winding down here Tuesday afternoon when thieves telephoned the undercover officers, telling them to expect another batch of stolen cars from the Bronx.

2 Get 25 Years to Life in Gay Man's Slaying in Queens
In an emotional scene pierced by the wails of one defendant's grandmother, two young men were sentenced yesterday to the maximum of 25 years to life in prison for helping to kill a gay man in Queens in a case that roused rage among many gay people.
"My God! My God! My God!" the grandmother of Esat Bici screamed in State Supreme Court in Queens after the 20-year-old Mr.
Bici and 21-year-old Erik Brown were sentenced.


End the Horror in Haiti
By ratifying the compromise choice of Rene Theodore as prime minister next week, Haiti's Parliament can halt the country's steep slide into catastrophe.
But it will require many months to repair the brutal damage done to democratic institutions in the three and a half months since soldiers ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Haiti's people cannot afford further delay.
The nomination of Mr.
Theodore, a Communist, is the result of mediation efforts by the Organization of American States in which Washington played a constructive role.
Despite his Communist label, U.S. diplomats see him as a principled moderate.

Push Comes To Shove But Nets Win
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Nets tonight.
They opened the game without starting forward Derrick Coleman.
Trailing by 3 points midway through the third quarter, the outlook wasn't much better after starting center Sam Bowie was lost on a pair of technical fouls.
But the outcome was just the thing the Nets were hoping for, a 104-97 victory over Milwaukee before a crowd of 9,230 at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
The victory snapped the Bucks' four-game winning streak and extended New Jersey's winning streak to three.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOKAfter 17 Years, the Attica Trial Lives
An almost palpable sense of expectation and weariness has gripped the courtroom here where one of the final chapters in the story of the 1971 Attica prison insurrection is being played out.
Many of the major legal players have spent most of their professional lives involved with this case, which went to the jury on Thursday and which will determine whether four New York State officials are liable for deaths and injuries that occurred during and after the uprising.

Greenspan Asks Pause In Stimulus
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress today that he expected the steep cut in interest rates that the Fed ordered last month to be sufficient to get an economic recovery started and that he did not foresee a need for further rate cuts or for budgetary stimulus.
"That is my expectation; that is my best judgment," Mr.
Greenspan said in answer to questions from sharply critical Democratic senators.

A Deficit For First Chicago
In a report that surprised Wall Street, the First Chicago Corporation reported a fourth-quarter loss today of $15.1 million and announced a cut in the company's quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 50 cents.
The company's stock fell $1.25, to $23.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The parent of the First National Bank of Chicago attributed its quarterly deficit to losses from two large loans.
It said one was to the Maxwell Communication Corporation, the media conglomerate, now in bankruptcy, that had been controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.


Your Taxes; Home Buyers Win on Points
The long-clouded issue of deducting the prepaid interest, or points, that borrowers must often pay to obtain a mortgage is becoming clearer -- to the financial benefit of many borrowers -- as a result of a recent, little-publicized ruling by the Internal Revenue Service.
Although home buyers have largely ignored the distinction, the agency until now had held that points deducted at closing must be only those payments clearly identifiable as compensation for the "use or forbearance of money," or interest, and not fees for related services.
This seemed to bar deduction of points paid to a mortgage broker, either directly or through a bank.

Patents; Wristband to Ease Morning Sickness
Robert C. Giarratano, a gynecologist in San Diego, won a patent this week for a wristband to fight morning sickness among pregnant women by using the principles of acupuncture.
Invented in the hope of providing relief without drugs, which pregnant women are advised to avoid, the elastic wristband features a bead that presses against the Neiguan point, a point on the inside of the forearm about an inch above the wrist.
According to the patent, acupuncturists have applied pressure against this spot to relieve discomfort and pain, and most of the pregnant women who were treated with the new band were said to experience significant relief from nausea and vomiting.

Review/Music; Themes of AIDS and Remembrance in Corigliano's Symphony
Portions of the AIDS Memorial Quilt were on display in the lobby of Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night.
Each of the quilt's 14,000 segments was created by a different person and dedicated to the memory of someone who died of the disease.
There was also a table of literature about AIDS in the lobby; members of the New York Philharmonic wore red ribbons, and a note in the program announced that the orchestra's concerts through Tuesday, conducted by Leonard Slatkin, are "dedicated to those who have died of AIDS, those who are living with AIDS and those who help and support them." Finally, just after intermission, Mr.
Slatkin introduced the work that provided the occasion for this focus on AIDS: John Corigliano's Symphony No. 1.
The 40-minute work was generated, the composer writes in the notes, by "feelings of loss, anger and frustration" as friends and colleagues have been felled by AIDS.
In the score, inscribed next to melodic themes, are names of the deceased; one phrase recalls Paul Jacobs, the distinguished pianist for the New York Philharmonic.
The first movement includes quotations from Albeniz's Tango as transcribed for piano by Leopold Godowsky, a favorite of another friend who died; the second recalls a music executive who descended into insanity as the disease progressed; the third movement's cello solos are derived from the instrumental improvisations of yet another victim of AIDS.
The themes associated with these figures reappear in a mournful epilogue.
The symphony is a gallery of the dead.
The composer said he was inspired by the AIDS quilt.


A Public Safety Campaign Falls Short of Its Mark
A 16-month campaign to warn that children could drown in large plastic buckets apparently is not working, and Government and industry officials may be forced to find a new approach.
The industry-sponsored campaign has relied on consumers getting warning labels and putting them on the plastic five-gallon containers they have at home, rather than requiring companies that make or use the containers to put the stickers on or to take other measures.
But thus far, only about 72,000 free stickers have been distributed to consumers.


Patents; A Ball That's Square But Also Bounces
In search of the next novelty fad, Jeff D. Myers of Scottsdale, Ariz., has patented a square ball that bounces as predictably as a round one.
The square ball features a hard rubber core encased in a spongy square.
Thus, when a person bounces the ball, the spongy square gives way to the rubber and the ball rebounds as if the square exterior were not there.
The patent does not describe why this would be useful.


Miami Emerges as Latin Art Center
Aided by a surge of interest in the painting and sculpture of Latin America and by a growing community of artists, galleries and dealers, Miami is rapidly emerging as an important center for the creation, display and marketing of Latin American art.
New galleries specializing in such art are opening and some existing galleries are beginning to display works from the Caribbean and South America.
Latin American artists and collectors are also arriving in increasing numbers, hoping to benefit from their involvement with one of the few bright spots in the depressed international art market.

Yorba Linda Journal; Where J.F.K.'s the Loser and Nixon's Still the One
To visit the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace, with its well-tended rose garden and attractive displays, is to rediscover the sense of combat that surrounded the former President's career in public office.
In elaborate exhibits touching the high and low points of his long career, on the screens of period television sets and on a question-and-answer videotape, Mr.
Nixon is still, in his own words, "in the arena," still fighting for his political life nearly 20 years after resigning the Presidency.


Tech Notes; Recycling the Proliferating Disk
When used with personal computers, compact disks can store vast amounts of information in very little space.
But as more computer software is introduced on CD-ROM (compact disk read-only memory), regular updates of that software are sure to lead to a growing pile of disks that have outlived their usefulness.
Before long, people are likely to be asking if they can recycle their outdated disks.
A fledgling program to recycle compact disks is under way at the Digital Audio Disk Corporation in Terra Haute, Ind., a subsidiary of Sony U.S.A.
Inc. that is the biggest manufacturer of CD's in the United States, supplying about a third of the market.
Right now, Digital Audio is recycling metalized disks rejected at the factory and using some of them to make the trays that compact disks are packaged in.

War in Somalia a Major Test for New U.N. Leader
The continuing bloodshed and anarchy in Somalia will present the new United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Ghali, with his first serious challenge next week and test hopes that the organization can play a more effective peacemaking role in the post-cold-war era, according to many diplomats.
International pressure is building for the Secretary General and the Security Council to intervene in Somalia in an effort to end months of factional fighting that has cost about 20,000 lives.

U.S. Forces Find Work As Angels Of Mercy
FRESH off a triumphant year bracketed by the crushing defeat of Iraq's army and the breakup of its Soviet archrival, the United States military faces a growing role as an international angel of mercy.
In the last 12 months, American-led allied forces provided food, water and shelter to 500,000 Kurds in northern Iraq and Turkey.
Navy hovercraft ferried tons of supplies and medicine to typhoon-ravaged Bangladesh.
An olive-green tent city sprouted at an American naval base in Cuba to house 7,000 Haitians fleeing their country.
Perhaps most emblematic of this changing mission, Air Force cargo planes this winter are flying tons of food, blankets and medical supplies into the former Soviet republics.


Bowman Takes Title With Ease
With a program that dazzled the judges for its theatrics if not its difficulty, Christopher Bowman completed a week filled with his own special brand of craziness to win the men's title of the national figure-skating championships here today and make the United States Olympic team for a second consecutive time.
After leading 18 other skaters through the original program on Friday, Bowman delivered just what he needed in the free-skate phase of competition, a safe but entertaining routine, to earn the highest scores from eight of the nine judges.
While he completed all seven of his triple jumps, none was the most difficult, the axel.


U.N. Ends Protection for Vietnamese at Sea
An anti-piracy program intended to protect Vietnamese refugees from brutal attacks in the Gulf of Thailand has been phased out by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees because the attacks have all but ceased in the last 18 months.
Responsibility for policing the seas where, since 1975, thousands of Vietnamese refugees have been robbed, raped, killed or drowned when their boats were attacked, will now rest with the Thai Navy.


Birds in Prints and Drawings (and Outside at a Feeder)
PRESUMPTUOUS though it may be to say it, Roger Tory Peterson sells purple finches short when he likens them to "sparrows dipped in raspberry juice." After all, the average house sparrow's ankle is a poor thing compared with the exquisitely turned joint of its purple (or red) cousin, and its lines are far less elegant.
The difference can be seen most days at the feeder maintained here by the New Jersey Audubon Society.
On a recent visit, this reviewer was privileged to see, in addition, a slate-colored junco, a downy woodpecker and a horde of corpulent chickadees.
It is a floor show that, at an unfamiliar sound, vanishes into the hedge behind, returning seconds later to resume upstaging the exhibition of bird art inside the society's hilltop house of brick painted white.
The building and its wooded grounds were a bequest to the society by the late Fred Hoffman, of the Hoffman Beverage Company.


Lisa Galluzzi to Wed
Mr. and Mrs.
John M. Galluzzi of Yonkers have announced the engagement of their daughter Lisa Ann Galluzzi to Christopher Vincent Moss, a son of John G. Moss of Portsmouth, R.I., and Patricia Moss-Henderson of St.
Petersburg, Fla.
A July wedding is planned.


Soviet Aftershocks Include a Global Commodities Glut
WHEN your chief competitor goes out of business, that is supposed to be good news for your bottom line.
But when the Soviet Union died, a lot of the commercial victors around the world caught a bad cold at the funeral.
The reason is a flood of exports from the former union that has severely depressed commodity prices.
From over there, the export activity of the last few months probably looked like a desperate effort to keep bread on the table.
But for competitors in uranium, aluminum, platinum, fertilizer and gold, it was an ironic reprise of the cold war threat of Nikita Khrushchev, to "bury you." Bruce L. Kaplan, who owns a precious metals consulting firm in Santa Monica, Calif., called it "dis-hoarding." The effects, which have been felt each year since 1989, have been dramatic, with the major exception to the pattern being oil, which Russia produces in abundance but is difficult to stockpile.


Camera
While electronic imaging may be grabbing the headlines these days, many photographers still prefer old-fashioned view cameras, or they buy new view cameras with updated controls like automatic exposure.
The view camera, one of the oldest cameras, is a big piece of equipment, mounted on a tripod; its lens and film are connected by a bellows.
Because larger-sized film is used, view-camera photography is called large-format photography.


Susan Burns to Marry J. K. Levine
Dr. and Mrs.
Donald T. Burns of Wyomissing, Pa., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Susan Elizabeth Burns, to Jonathan Krasne Levine, a son of Robert P. and Dr.
Betty Krasne Levine of Ardsley, N.Y.
A June wedding is planned.
Ms.
Burns, 28 years old, is a Ph.D. candidate in English and American literature at New York University.
She graduated from Haverford College and received a master's degree in English from the University of Chicago.
Her father is chief of ophthalmology at the Reading (Pa.) Hospital and Medical Center.
Her mother is a registered nurse.


Grand Slam
As a pitcher for the Mets, the Reds, the White Sox and the Red, Tom Seaver was used to amassing some pretty impressive statistics: In his 311 winning games, he was responsible for 3,640 strikeouts and 61 shutouts.
In 1969 he helped the Mets regain their self-respect and win the World Series.
Last week, breaking a record set by Ty Cobb, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by 98.8 percent of the ballots cast by members of the Baseball Writers Association of America.
His reaction was typically understated.
"My children," he said, "will be able to take their children to the Hall of Fame and say: 'There's your grandfather. In his time, he was pretty good at what he did.' " Ron Swoboda, the outfielder who played for the Mets with Seaver, was less reserved.
"He was the consummate pro from Day One," he said.
"And that comes from a guy who clearly wasn't. I and others felt our way along in the majors. But Seaver, he seemed to be walking a golden path."


A Crusade to Save the Soul of Arlington
A master at civic boosterism, Tom Vandergriff lured the Senators baseball team, now the Texas Rangers, away from Washington in 1971 and coaxed millions of dollars from voters for a stadium, a convention center, libraries, schools, lakes and roads.
But no triumph during his 26 years as Mayor here, until 1977, compares with the surprise choice by the General Motors Corporation 41 years ago to pass up Dallas and Fort Worth to build an assembly plant in Arlington, then a small farm town of 7,800 people and four square miles.

No Rush on Germany in Security Council; The Soviet Seat
To the Editor:
"Russia Deserves the Soviet Seat" by Richard N. Gardner and Toby Trister Gati (Op-Ed, Dec. 19) sublimely expresses the opinion that Russia was the Soviet Union.
Why should Russia gain the seat on the Security Council held by the Soviet Union, if the Soviet Constitution said all the republics were equal?


With Return of a Mob War, Prosecutor Presses for Peace
Faced with a deadly end to a holiday truce in New York City's most vicious mob war in 30 years, the Brooklyn District Attorney's office has recruited up to 120 Federal, state and city officers to try to push the battling factions into a new peace, a law-enforcement official said yesterday.
In the last seven months, since the struggle in the Colombo crime family broke into the open, there have been 10 attempted killings of members of two factions, leaving six men dead and seven people wounded, including at least four innocent bystanders.


Sunday Menu; Baba Gannouj With Lentils: Still Tasty but Easier to Cook
If this recipe for baba gannouj seems a bit strange, it is: lentils have replaced the traditional chickpeas and cut the cooking time to a fraction of what it would have otherwise been.


IN THIS CORNER
Michael Specter's article "In This Corner" (Dec. 15) portrayed Lowell Weicker as a tough, independent leader, trying to do the right thing, but it failed to express Connecticut's worst fears -- namely, that Weicker is simply using the state's desperate problems to further his ambition to repackage himself as a leader of national prominence.
Weicker worked hard during his campaign to create the impression that he was against an income tax.
When elected, he used strong-arm tactics on legislators to swing their votes to gain a huge tax increase.
Weicker wants a quick Connecticut miracle that can propel him to renewed national prestige.
It's too late.
The depression and economic collapse that started in New England is spreading, and so is the fury of the middle class, who have nothing left to give.

SKIING Wasmeier Goes Whoosh
Markus Wasmeier of Germany, a late starter on one of his favorite courses, survived a treacherously icy Kandahar run in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, yesterday to win a World Cup downhill.
Wasmeier was 38th out of the gate on a course on which several racers suffered bad crashes.
He was timed in 1 minute 50.58 seconds, edging Patrick Ortlieb of Austria, who was second in 1:50.64.


When 'Macbeth' Shook the World Of Astor Place
Rivalry in the theater is nothing new, but rarely does it lead to a riot causing the death of at least 20
people and the injury of more than 100 others.
That fatal incident serves as the backdrop of "Two Shakespearean Actors" by Richard Nelson, which opens Thursday at the Cort Theater on Broadway.
In the play, Mr.
Nelson examines the lives of the two principals behind what became known as the Astor Place Riot.
In May 1849, the English Shakespearean actor William Macready (played by Brian Bedford) and the American
favorite son Edwin Forrest (Victor Garber) appeared in competing productions of "Macbeth" in Manhattan.
The rivalry between the two, who at one point had been friendly, was fact -- and public: a previous theatrical tour of America by Macready had been hampered by competing bookings of Forrest; in England, Macready followers had insured that Forrest
would be snubbed while on tour by much of literary society.


Marinovich Explains
It was crossed signals, not willful intent, that kept Raiders quarterback TODD MARINOVICH from keeping a court date in Torrance, Calif., last week, according to the the rookie quarterback's lawyer.
Marinovich, who was charged with violating a noise ordinance at a party at his Manhattan Beach home last October, failed to appear for his arraignment on Thursday, prompting the judge to issue a warrant for his arrest.
After entering a plea of not guilty on his client's behalf and paying a $100 fine for Marinovich's missing the court date, his lawyer, GARY POHLSON said it had all been a simple misunderstanding: Marinovich had misread the citation. (AP)


Republican Legislators Emerge as the Victors
THE Republican Party took control of the Board of Legislators last week despite the fact that the Democrats won a majority on the Board last November for the first time in 83 years.
With the support of Suzanne R. Swanson, an enrolled Conservative from Mount Pleasant who was elected to her first political office as a County Legislator on the Democratic line, Republicans had just enough votes to approve Stephen P. Tenore, a Republican-Conservative from Mount Vernon as the Board's new chairman.
Mr.
Tenore defeated Sandra R. Galef, the Democratic leader, by one vote.


Genetic Record to Be Kept on Members of Military
The Defense Department said today that it would establish a repository of genetic information on all American service members as a new way of identifying future casualties of war.
Samples of DNA, the basic material of heredity, will be obtained from blood and oral swabs.
The samples will be added to existing fingerprint, dental and other records to produce a more comprehensive way of identifying the remains of war dead, said the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, which proposed the initiative.


To Repair Door Locks, Try Replacing the Cylinder
PROBLEMS with door locks do not always mean that the entire knob and latch assembly has to be removed or replaced.
Often just removing the lock cylinder, the part containing the keyhole, is necessary.
The cylinder can be taken to a locksmith for repair, replacement or changing the key.
Removing and reinstalling the cylinders of most locks, usually an easy job, require just a few ordinary tools.
But if a cylinder cannot be removed with such tools, the job will require a licensed locksmith.


Quayle Fills Bush's Irregular Regulation Shoes
To the Editor:
I must disagree with a statement in "Mr. Quayle's Irregular Regulation" (editorial, Dec. 15): "The Task Force on Regulatory Relief didn't amount to much when George Bush headed it as Vice President." All of the criticisms made of Vice President Quayle's Council on Competitiveness -- it is a "powerful force for watering down regulation," it operates "in secrecy," and it has a "pro-business slant" -- apply with equal force to Mr.
Bush's task force.

An article on Dec. 29 about efforts to help parents at risk of abusing their children misattributed a description of a letter received by a program director from a grateful client on the same day the director was notified that three siblings on a waiting list for help had been found to have syphilis.

Another Round: Guns vs. Gulls at Kennedy Airport
Federal officials shot down almost 15,000 laughing gulls near Kennedy International Airport last year in an effort to reduce airplane-gull collisions.
They plan to resume the program this spring, a plan that angers conservationists and bird lovers.
In the latest battle of a long war to reduce interference with airplanes, Department of Agriculture biologists, armed with 12-gauge shotguns, killed 14,886 gulls between May 20 and Aug. 8, 1991, according to a report by Richard A. Dolbeer of the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.


Stamps
The first United States stamps of the new year go on sale nationwide tomorrow: a set of five 29-cent stamps to commemorate the Winter Olympic Games in Albertville, France.
And with the first 1992 issue, the United States Postal Service seems to have committed its first gaffe of the new year: the dates given for the Winter Olympics in the margin of the sheet of stamps are Feb. 8-25; in fact, the games are to end Feb. 23.


Search for Sensitivity Means Leaving Jock Label Behind
UNTIL he rolled off the top of the Kensico Dam, Ed Gallagher offered himself to the world as a "meat man," a 6-foot-6-inch, 275-pound former offensive lineman who loved to hit hard, drive drunk and use women like Kleenex.
The mask came off in his suicide note.
He wrote: "The way I lived my life, I think death is deserving of me. I don't know how to handle the pain anymore."


Feldman's Minimalism in Maximal Doses
"By definition minimalism is minimal. It's a ridiculous assumption that any art form can seriously go backwards and survive. All the former Minimalists are hopping off the bandwagon. That's like the Nazis who said they were never Nazis. It makes me so sick."
Thus spake the composer Gunther Schuller in an interview in the October issue of Musician magazine.
Well, maybe Minimalism is dying, but tell that to the eager musicians who are busy performing and recording the music of Morton Feldman.
In the last year and a half, 12 Feldman releases have appeared, four times the entire recorded Feldman output to 1990.


Following A Rough Year, Bankers See An Upswing
IN 1991 a record 20 banks and savings and loan associations failed in Connecticut, and about half the financial institutions still in business are under some type of special regulatory watch.
"I don't think it's ever been this bad in the past," said Barbara S. McGrath, Deputy Commissioner of the State Banking Department.
"We've never closed this many banks before. We've never had this many regulatory orders outstanding. I guess the 1980's were too good to be true. It's not clear all the problems have been recognized yet, either."

David Edwards, 69, Judge and Lawyer In New York City
David H. Edwards Jr., a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan who presided over several notable cases, died on Friday at his home in Queens.
He was 69 years old and died of heart failure, his family said.
Justice Edwards in 1988 ordered that $16 million of the purse from the Michael Spinks-Mike Tyson championship boxing match be divided among Mr.
Tyson and his co-manager and trainer to help settle a dispute between them.
In 1983, following earlier Court of Appeals rulings, he ordered New York City officials to pay the developer Donald J. Trump a multimillion-dollar tax abatement for Trump Tower.


New York to Ban Street Windshield Washers
The New York City Department of Transportation has proposed a rule that would prohibit people from washing windshields or selling flowers, newspapers and other trinkets and gadgets to drivers caught in traffic or waiting for traffic lights.
While violaters would face arrest under the rule, which is to take effect on April 1, the Department of Transportation does not plan "a round-up of people squeegeeing windows," said a spokesman, Joseph De Plasco.

Individualism Was Preserved
To the Editor:
For Bernard Holland to call Sviatoslav Richter's pianism "iron-willed authoritarianism" is offensive.
Here is an artist who not only self-consciously avoids bravura playing, as he himself frequently says, but was a courageous opponent of Stalinism and everything it stood for -- witness his many hours of playing at the funeral of Boris Pasternak.


Let the Parent Beware
To the Editor:
With the recession, many children won't be able to manipulate their parents to get the promotional giveaways that travel agents, airlines and companies have planned for them ("Younger Set Leads the Way on the Road," Dec. 1.) These exotic juvenile vacations depend on adults who use vacations as status symbols.
They perpetuate the same type of vacation with their children and condition them to depend on it for happiness.

Budget London
To the Editor: Solving the budget hotel problem in London is easy ("What's Doing in London," Oct. 6).
Just take the Tube from Heathrow (change at Hammersmith); or the express train from Gatwick direct to Victoria Station, take a cab, a 24 bus, or walk up to Belgrave Road (use your map, or ask) and just check amongst the dozens and dozens of low-cost, clean hotels that line that street and several adjoining streets.
Access is easy: the 24 bus directly connects the neighborhood with Westminster and Trafalgar Square; Victoria Station's trains, shopping mall, Tube and bus stations are a 5-to-10-minute walk, Buy a $:2.30 (about $3.90, based on the rate when I was there of $1.70 to the pound) London Transport day pass every day and use it (it's also good on the Tube to Heathrow, and on the new Docklands Light Railway).


Cures for Sartorial Cabin Fever
The year may be new, but winter is old, and there is no sign yet of spring.
It is the time you get bored with wearing the same clothes month after month and are yearning for something different.
The markdowns in the stores look as tired as what's already hanging in your closet, so they provide scant comfort.
But diligent shopping can turn up some early spring merchandise to perk up your spirits.
One new outfit, or even one new item, can add a touch of freshness to a stale wardrobe.
Perhaps a pair of platform pumps, which are showing signs of making a major comeback, can provide the needed lift.
Saks Fifth Avenue has a sling-back version in black patent by Escada ($315) that is sure to be different from anything you already have.


Matchmaking Over Latkes

Coach for E. Carolina
STEVE LOGAN, who has directed East Carolina's high-powered offense the last two seasons, was named yesterday as the Pirates' football coach.
Logan, 38, succeeds BILL LEWIS, who resigned Jan. 6 to become coach at Georgia Tech.
Logan said he would continue to emphasize the passing game that helped the Pirates gain an 11-1 record and the team's first top 10 ranking.
East Carolina beat North Carolina State, 37-34, in the Peach Bowl.


Michael Showing Legs for the Shopping-Spree Game
His shackles removed, Gene Michael acted like a contestant in a shopping-spree contest.
Racing down the aisles of the department store as if he had a proscribed amount of time, he plucked Danny Tartabull from the run-production department, turned right, sped toward the infield area and snatched Mike Gallego from a rack, then paused at the third-base counter, where he grabbed a gift certificate that he planned to convert into Charlie Hayes.
Finally, scampering to the back of the store, he retrieved Steve Sax from a trash bin and deposited him on a table in the pitching department, scooping up Melido Perez in his place.

500 Years of American History in 7 Acts
THE Shubert Performing Arts Center in New Haven has put together an 11-month series of events under the umbrella title "Celebration of the Americas: 1492-1992." "This extensive program spotlights the variety of performing arts which have developed in the Americas as a result of our multicultural heritage," said the Shubert's executive director, Judith Lisi.
Seven major presentations form the pillars of the celebration.
The opening production, "I Have a Dream," will raise funds for the Dixwell Community House, which provides educational programs and other services for young people in New Haven.
The musical, performed by members of the National Black Touring Circuit, traces the life and death of the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., fusing excerpts from his letters and speeches with almost 30 songs, mostly in the spiritual and gospel traditions.
There is a student preview on Thursday morning at 10 for school groups; the public performance is at 8 P.M. on Friday.


Amtrak Revises Elderly Discount
Amtrak has revised its discount program for elderly travelers, lowering the age qualification from 65 to 62 and at the same time reducing the amount of the discount.
Passengers aged 62 and over can now get a 15 percent discount off the lowest available round-trip coach fare Monday through Thursday.
The program began Jan. 6.
Previously, travelers aged 65 got 25 percent off the highest one-way fare seven days a week.
The lowest round-trip coach fares often sell out quickly, and since the senior discount is computed using the lowest available fare, passengers are advised to reserve well in advance.
Senior citizen fares will not be available on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and Dec. 26, 29, 30 and 31, 1992.


Injured Celtics Send Shaw To the Heat for Douglas
With injuries threatening to ruin their season, the Boston Celtics made a bold trade late Friday night in hopes of strengthening their lineup.

Douglas was to make his Celtics debut last night at Madison Square Garden against the Knicks.

The 42-year-old Bruce Ratner, who has become the chief developer of major projects in Brooklyn, has had some of both.
The ups are to be found at Metrotech, the office center on a 16-acre site adjoining Polytechnic University, which contributed the land and is getting major building and grounds improvements.
With four completed office buildings, a fifth far advanced in construction and two or three more in prospect, Metrotech is easily New York City's leading phased office development project, second in scale only to Olympia &amp; York's World Financial Center at Battery Park City.


County Fights State on Judicial Costs
AT the end of 1991, Essex County Assignment Judge Burell Ives Humphreys decided to pay year-end bonuses to 96 State Superior Court employees out of a surplus in the county clerk's budget.
The Essex County Executive and the Board of Chosen Freeholders, however, citing a potential million-dollar shortfall in next year's budget, declined to issue the bonus checks.
Judge Humphreys ordered the officials to make the payments.
The officials refused.

2 Sliders May Put Luge in Big Leagues
Duncan Kennedy had a searing headache, the flu and a touch of vertigo.
He was being asked to sled down a frozen water slide in 10-degree weather, dropping 93.3 meters at a 30 percent grade, traveling up to 70 miles per hour.
Kennedy took the plunge twice today, without thinking once, even though he had already clinched a spot on the United States Olympic luge team that is going to Albertville, France, next month.
A little shove at the top, and the ailing Duncan became an aerodynamic streak of blue.

What Is The Politics Of 'Tristan'?
In 1984, just before the New York Philharmonic left on an Asian tour, Malaysia objected to one of the works Zubin Mehta was to conduct: Ernest Bloch's "Schelomo: A Hebrew Rhapsody for Cello and Orchestra." The predominantly Islamic country did not allow presentation of any musical work of Jewish origin.
At first, the Philharmonic administration agreed to change the program, sparking an outcry.
This cowardly response was contrasted with Mr.
Mehta's courageous programming of Wagner in Israel three years earlier.
At that time, defying the Israel Philharmonic's 43-year ban on the German composer's music, Mr.
Mehta led music from "Tristan and Isolde" as an encore.
Fistfights broke out in the audience; some musicians left the stage in protest, and an usher bared battle scars before the Love-Death could reach its infinitely postponed cadence; a result was the indefinite postponement of future performances of Wagner.
These two examples of musical discord -- both seeming to involve politics -- are not similar.
Malaysia's objection was connected to its attitude toward Israel; political opposition was turned into racist law.
An American orchestra was asked to accommodate such perversity.
After the uproar, the Philharmonic canceled its concerts in Malaysia.

Conference Championships -- IN A WORD: DEFENSE; Redskins Counting on the Big 'D'
The Washington Redskins' plucky defense will go up against the Detroit Lions' sassy run-and-shoot offense Sunday in the National Conference championship game, and the Redskins' defensive coordinator, Richie Petitbon, says that his defense is pitted against a Babe Ruth.
He also says that he will rely on a few coaching principles of John Wooden and that his players will need Richard Burton's style.

Let's Be Fair In Island Park
I wish to comment on "Honking Ducks or Disco: How Do You Control the Noise?"  [ Dec. 15 ] .
My particular concern deals with the situation in Island Park, as I am the owner of Paddy McGees Restaurant, one of the businesses cited for noise problems.
I don't believe a fair and accurate representation of our neighborhood was presented.
Your descriptions of "rustic Barnum Isle" and "this mostly residential neighborhood" implies that the nightlife of this popular waterfront has suddenly fallen from the sky and landed in our neighbors backyards.
This is the exact opposite of what has happened, and I wish to review this waterfront's history.


Wall Street; A Dubious California Play
As an investment concept, CleanAir Transit is pure California, right up there with wind chimes and chardonnay.
Based in Santa Barbara, this newly hatched company aims to design and sell nonpolluting electric buses to environmentally correct towns and cities everywhere.
No more diesel fumes, just a benign trace or two from the natural-gas generator that runs the air conditioner and heater.
This ahead-of-the-curve idea is outlined in a private placement memorandum now making the rounds among the very wealthy set out West. (The minimum outlay is $25,000, so none but the wealthy need apply.) By privately selling $2 million worth of preferred and common shares, CleanAir Transit hopes to grow enough to sell more shares to the general public in a year or so.

No Guts, No Glory: Short-Selling in a Bull Market
Steven Kibbey of La Jolla, Calif., could be speaking for any number of bearish investors on Wall Street when he described what it has been like in recent weeks to watch the stock market flirt with new highs.
As a person who helps run Centurion Capital's $15 million fund devoted to short-selling stocks and thus an expert at pinpointing overvalued stocks that might be ripe for a corrective decline in price, he watched help lessly as his fund dropped 24 percent last year, versus a 42 percent rise the year before.
Many sure-fire bets "went from being overvalued to wildly overvalued to downright silly," he said.
"And then they doubled," he added, lest anyone mistake what kind of year 1991 was.


Designer Jewelry Fashioned in Cairo
FROM Tutenkhamun to Cleopatra and from the ancient bedouin to the newer rich, Egypt's handcrafted jewelry has a long tradition as a means of accumulating wealth, and displaying it, too.
What is less well known these days is where to find not the beads and baubles of the bazaar, but unusual and exquisite ornaments, fashioned from pure metals and precious stones.
Although the list of jewelers in Cairo's commercial directory runs to 15 pages or so, it does not contain the addresses of the city's most talented -- and exclusive -- designers, who have to be sought out from those in the know.


Political Talk
Regrets, I've Had a Few
Messrs.

Anyone who knows Jose E. Serrano even slightly knows he is an ardent fan of Frank Sinatra.
In fact, Mr.
Serrano learned English from the Sinatra 78's his father brought home when he was growing up in Puerto Rico in the late 1940's, and he entertained childhood dreams of being a nightclub singer.
He never made it, although he seems to have done all right with his voice anyway, since he is now the Congressman from the South Bronx.


CAMPUS LIFE: Iowa State; Research Group Sues 2 Companies Over Fax Patent
In an effort to stop copycats from profiting from its research efforts, the Iowa State University Research Foundation is suing two Japanese-based fascimile machine manufacturers asking tens of millions of dollars in damages for patent infringement.
The companies, Murata Manufacturing and the NEC Corporation, refused to pay a licensing fee on a fax machine process developed by a university researcher and patented by the Iowa State University Research Foundation, according to court documents filed in Federal District Court in Des Moines.

Designs for Laughing
Explaining humor is a tricky business.
It's hard to convey exuberance, surprise and mischief if you're bent on analyzing them at the same time.
GRAPHIC WIT: The Art of Humor in Graphic Design (Watson-Guptill, Paper, $29.95), by Steven Heller, the art director of The Book Review and the author of several books on graphic art, and Gail Anderson, the deputy art director of Rolling Stone magazine, surveys the role of humor in design.
In their anatomy of wit at the service of communication, the authors explain how designers use such elements as scale and type to amuse, engage and persuade us.
The evolution of styles -- Art Deco, New Wave or the current nostalgia craze -- provides a context for discussing subtle corporate logos as well as outlandish advertisements.
Mr.
Heller and Ms.
Anderson, as one might expect, resolve some of the difficulties of explaining humor by the copious use of illustrations.
Interviews with leading practitioners of this difficult art make up the last part of the text, providing an anecdotal perspective that complements the analytic approach of the preceding sections.
The designers surveyed in the book represent a wide range of approaches -- from the elegance of Paul Rand to the boisterous and rollicking work of Push Pin Studios.
Underlying all humorous design is a sense of play and surprise, a skewing of the ordinary.
Not surprisingly, playful design seems more common in shopping bags than in annual reports.
The humor in corporate publications, as one graphic artist points out, is often a matter of getting away with something.
The book's own designers, Louise Fili and Lee Bearson, clearly favor an irreverent -- if not raucous -- style, sometimes at the expense of legibility.
Navigating these crowded and colorful pages, jammed with text and illustrations, is like trying to get a table at a hot eatery in SoHo -- it helps to have been there before, to already know your way around.


A Believer in Liberal Arts Tackles Worker Education
Since 1983, when the Government released a stinging critique of the nation's schools, educational reform has been high on corporate America's list of priorities.
But even before that report, titled "A Nation at Risk," the National Alliance of Business, a coalition of some 3,500 businesses, was intent on raising the quality of the country's work force by improving education and employment opportunities.
Recently, the organization, founded in 1968, appointed Joseph A. Pichler, president and chief executive of the Kroger Company, a Cincinnati-based supermarket chain, as its chairman.

An article on Dec. 29 about migration in Europe misstated an eligibility rule for German citizenship.

Topics of The Times; Wine Tradition Goes Pop
Imagine the sommelier at Lespinasse, the new Old World restaurant at the St.
Regis Hotel, delivering an $80 bottle of 1988 Opus One, a California cabernet sauvignon, to a table.
With a flourish, he unscrews the metal cap and pours an ounce into a thin-stemmed German crystal glass.
Screw cap?
On premium wine?
Well, it certainly won't happen with Opus One.
To Robert Mondavi, who produces Opus One together with Chateau Mouton-Rothschild of Bordeaux, the traditional cork symbolizes the good life and the weight of history.
But Glen Ellen, an innovative Sonoma County producer, has now committed the sacrilege of replacing the cork on a $10 wine with a jug-style metal top.


Style of a Men's Club in a Hotel Setting
WHEN we reviewed the stylish restaurant in the new Hotel Sheraton Stamford in the summer of 1986, it was called Magnificent J's, after a class of sailboats that raced across the Atlantic in the 1930's.
The restaurant featured seafood, prepared with a panache that rated a Very Good, in a setting that resembled a ship's cabin.
Following a trend of the time, the hotel seemed to be making its restaurant a culinary flagship instead of the ordinary and predictable hotel dining room of decades past.
Alas, much that distinguished the small, handsome Stamford restaurant has disappeared, including most of its name, menu and wine cellar.
The new name, J's Bar and Grill, says it all.
The small menu, which is printed daily (though only a small category called "captain's choice" changes), offers several types of steak, a few seafood and chicken dishes and several currently popular appetizers.


CAMPUS LIFE: Chicago; Physics Research: Will Lab Problems Harm A Department?
High-energy physics researchers at the University of Chicago said they were worried about the future of their department.
What is causing their concern, they said, is the possibility that the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in nearby Batavia will not receive the money it needs for improvements.
Since 1967, the department has depended on the laboratory, known as Fermilab, to help attract graduate students and faculty members to the university.
Without a high-performance laboratory, the researchers fear that the quality of the department may decline.

Making Waves
The daughter of a missionary, Faye Wattleton decided long ago to proselytize for the right of women to abort unwanted pregnancies.
As the president of Planned Parenthood for the last 14 years she has seen the organization grow in militancy, size and influence.
But now she is moving to a wider forum.
Last week she said she would leave her $184,000-a-year job in early April and become the host of a daytime television talk show.
Her subject: women's issues.
The Tribune Entertainment Company in Chicago, which also produces and distributes "The Joan Rivers Show" and "Geraldo," said Ms.
Wattleton's show would appear this spring.
"I will continue to be supportive and to speak out," she said, "but I see this move as an opportunity to broaden my role. I was approached more than a year ago with the possibility of doing a serious issues show, and Tribune made a very attractive offer and we worked out a very attractive arrangement, which I am not at liberty to discuss."

San Jose: Vanna the Robot Chooses the Right Letters
IN Silicon Valley, the nation's hotbed of high technology, some of the most successful companies started in garages.
So it is perhaps fitting that a museum devoted to the products and processes of the region should also start out small.
The Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, Calif., which opened a little more than a year ago, is a compact yet imaginative museum whose exhibits fit into one gymnasium-size room.
Indeed, the museum was initially named the Garage, but the name was deemed too confusing to those unaware that high tech entrepreneurs view a garage as more than a place to park a car.
The Tech, as the museum is now generally called, hopes to distinguish itself from other science museums by emphasizing applications of technology, not the basic principles of science.
"Theirs is the 'what' and ours is the 'so what,' " said Robert A. Grimm, a retired Hewlett-Packard executive who heads the museum's exhibits and programs committee.


Nets Turn Bleak Picture Into Winning Work of Art
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Nets on Friday night as they opened the game without starting forward Derrick Coleman.
As they trailed by 3 points midway through the third quarter, the outlook wasn't much better after starting center Sam Bowie was lost on a pair of technical fouls.
But the outcome turned out to be just the thing the Nets were hoping for, a 104-97 victory over Milwaukee before a crowd of 9,230 fans at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
The victory snapped the Bucks' winning streak at four games and extended New Jersey's winning streak to three.

Ninja Turtles Never Swung These Samurai Swords
At age 14, Walter Ames Compton read about Japanese swords in a boy's magazine, and his lifelong interest in this esoteric subject began.
Several years later, while a student at Princeton University in the early 1930's, he bought his first samurai blade for $6 at a laundry in the Chinatown section of New York.
Today, the Compton collection of 1,100 swords and sword fittings is estimated to bring $20 million at a three-part auction at Christie's in New York.
Japanese experts describe the collection as one of the finest privately owned holdings in the West.
Christie's won the right to sell it after months of intense bidding against Sotheby's, which had been storing the swords in its New York warehouse for security reasons.
The first day of sale will be March 31.

A Mozart festival was in progress and we went to a nearby office of Cedok, the Czech National Tourist organization, to purchase opera tickets.
The tickets were inexpensive by New York standards, approximately $25 a pair.
However, when we arrived at the theater, we learned that these same tickets, sold at the box office, would have cost about $4 a pair.


This Week
As the catalogues roll in, treat yourself, depending on your obsession: Is it unusual perennials?
Old roses?
Heirloom vegetables?
Hundreds of companies across the country offer unusual plants and seeds.
The best source book I have ever used is "Gardening by Mail" by Barbara J. Barton.
If you don't have a dogeared copy, get the third edition (Houghton-Mifflin, $16.95).
The book not only cross-references plant and seed sources, professional associations and plant societies, but it also lists garden supplies, from goldfish to gazebos.


Against the Odds, 1992 Holds Hope
Talk about the international balance of payments: As the new year began, Japanese investors were buying two of Florida's three biggest tracks.
Arazi was resting in France before taking the road to the Kentucky Derby and the $5 million Triple Crown bonus.
The Sam-Son Farm of Canada was breaking records for earnings.
The Canadian filly Dance Smartly was bringing home more money than any other horse in the hemisphere.
And the Makhtoum brothers of Dubai were still propping up the American market by buying more race horses than anybody else.
But, in a business beset by mounting competition and dwindling attendance, the year dawned with tremors of change and glimmers of hope on the home front.
And they arose mainly in Florida, the winter home of racing in the East.

Neediest Cases Donors Help Despite Pain of the Recession
The recession and the suffering it is causing are cited by many of the donors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund as their reasons for giving.
What is more surprising, perhaps, is that scores of donations received so far have come from casualties of the economic slump.
"As a victim of the downsizing of one of this country's major corporations, this is not the best of holiday seasons for me," wrote a Manhattan woman who gave $100.
"And yet I am well aware that it is so much worse for so many other New Yorkers. So instead of feeling sorry for myself, I decided it was more important to focus on those who could really benefit from some help."

Under Political Steam, Health-Care Issue Gains Wider Support in Congress
In the last few months health care has jumped to the front of the Presidential race and to the top of the Congressional agenda, with proposals as radical as the creation of a national health insurance plan like Canada's gaining momentum.
Yet for all the commotion, most Congressional leaders expect only modest change this year.
They say the issue is so complex and the differences among members so wide that it will take months of study and hearings to arrive at a consensus.
Stop-gap measures, like an expansion of Medicaid and Medicare benefits for pregnant women and children or tax incentives to expand private health insurance, are picking up strong support, but the leaders say such changes are only the beginning.

Le Pescadou
18 King Street, at Avenue of the Americas, (212) 924-3434 -- The widespread popularity of bistros in New York City, paired with the surging consumption of seafood, made the timing right for Le Pescadou, which opened as an all-seafood bistro early last year.
This smart-looking little spot in SoHo serves a generally fresh and diverse catch at reasonable prices.


A COSMOLOGICAL EVENT
Timothy Ferris's demystification of many of the interpretations of "near death experiences" is long overdue ("A Cosmological Event," Dec. 15).
Science may not be able to solve the ultimate mystery of life and death, but it can certainly clarify some aspects of the issue.
For example, aerospace physiologists have long known that a condition known as hypoxia (lack of oxygen) causes the sensation of tunnel vision (the photoreceptors responsible for peripheral vision are highly sensitive to a lack of oxygen) followed by sensations of intoxication, giddiness and euphoria.
These symptoms are precisely those of near-death reports where people say they see a long tunnel with a light at the end, all associated with a feeling of great joy.

Tokyo Seeks to Punish Network That Taped Bush
In a rare public rift with its semi-official broadcaster, the Japanese Government has threatened to impose sanctions on the television network that broadcast the dramatic scenes of President Bush's collapse at an official dinner here last week, as more explicit footage of the incident became public for the first time.
Government officials here assert that NHK, the country's leading broadcaster, violated strict rules about broadcasting at the official residence of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
Forty minutes after Mr.
Bush fainted because of what the White House described as a stomach flu, NHK beamed footage around the world of an ashen-faced Mr.
Bush being lifted to his feet and then walking out of the dinner.

To Repair Door Locks, Try Replacing the Cylinder
PROBLEMS with door locks do not always mean that the entire knob and latch assembly has to be removed or replaced.
Often just removing the lock cylinder, the part containing the keyhole, is necessary.
The cylinder can be taken to a locksmith for repair, replacement or changing the key.
Removing and reinstalling the cylinders of most locks, usually an easy job, require just a few ordinary tools.
But if a cylinder cannot be removed with such tools, the job will require a licensed locksmith.


A COSMOLOGICAL EVENT
If Ferris intends to discredit near-death reports as an experience of "the great beyond," of having "caught sight of heaven," then he fails brilliantly.
There is, in fact, nothing remotely removed from a religious understanding of death in Ferris's description of death as a cosmological event.
His beautiful, profound and poetic incantation of the mystery of moving through death into cosmic harmony experienced as "a kind of major chord played on the nervous system by the plectrum of stress, a final note that bespeaks our resonance with the outer world" serves no less -- and, I think, far better -- in conjuring notions of eternal life and paradise, than many figures drawn from religious doctrine.

A Cast Changes And, Suddenly, A Play Is Reborn
Since the push is on for accuracy in labeling these days, it occurs to me that theater criticism ought to come with a cautionary warning.
Somewhere in the notices -- rapturous or otherwise -- shouldn't it be recorded, "Perishable contents" or "Invalid after June 1"?
We like to think -- we who produce it, especially -- that criticism is timeless.
But its shelf life is probably not significantly longer than that, say, of a carton of yogurt.
The reason is plain.
Critics bear witness to a singular event, destined by the conditions of its making never to be the same again.
The theatergoer rarely sees what the critics see, and by that I don't mean what the critics
perceive
. (That's another, thornier, issue.) I mean what they actually, physically, see.


Packers Get Holmgren, But the 49ers Gain, Too
They reportedly had to settle an old score with the 49ers to do it, but the Green Bay Packers finally got a new coach.
They signed MIKE HOLMGREN, the 49ers' offensive coordinator, to a five-year contract that will bring him an estimated $2.5 million.
The 43-year-old Holmgren, who spent six seasons with the 49ers after four years as the Brigham Young quarterbacks coach, replaces LINDY INFANTE, who was dismissed by the Packers after four seasons.


Stolen Statue Found in Brooklyn


Review/Jazz; Dizzy Gillespie Opens in the Company of Musical Peers
The opening show of Dizzy Gillespie's monthlong stand at the Blue Note was almost strange in the amount of invention it displayed.
Most bands working at this level feature a leader with a few younger players learning what to do; Mr.
Gillespie brought in an entire group of musicians who are roughly his equals.
The trumpet master was convening a group he ran in the early to mid-1960's, including the saxophonist James Moody and the pianist Kenny Barron.
They were there on Tuesday night along with a new rhythm section, Bob Cranshaw on bass and Elvin Jones on drums, and two ringers, Jimmy Heath on saxophone and Slide Hampton on trombone.
The result was a show by a company of musical peers who are all leaders in their own right and who were on their best behavior.


Cuomo Opens a Session With Barbs and a Gambit
IF the Governor's State of the State address sets the tone for the year, then last week's appearance by Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo in the ornate Assembly chamber certainly seemed to forecast continued sarcasm, getting heavy at times, with occasional snarling.
A Democratic Assemblyman from his home borough of Queens heckled Mr.
Cuomo about his proposal to dock lawmakers' pay when the budget is late, which it has been for the last seven years.
"You don't show up for work, you don't get paid," the Governor shot back testily.
An upstate Republican Senator groused something about his party wanting "structural reform" of the budget.
"Someday we're going to reform your structure, Senator," Mr.
Cuomo replied with a half-grin.


Boston: Walk-Through Computer
THE mark of a good museum, according to Oliver Strimpel, executive director of the Computer Museum in Boston, is that it leaves its visitors with a larger-than-life experience -- a lasting impression that changes the way they view their world.
At what may be the world's only museum devoted exclusively to computing, Dr.
Strimpel has been able to transform his vision into an array of interactive exhibits set around the museum's centerpiece -- a giant two-story walk-through computer.
It is a working model of a desktop computer blown up 50 times complete with a 25-foot-wide working keyboard and a six-foot-tall floppy disk.
To demonstrate a typical computer application visitors can roll a giant 9 by 6 feet trackball to move a screen pointer to starting and destination points from among 300 major world cities.
The computer will then find the shortest route between the two points and offer a slide show on its huge monitor of the sights along the way.


Prices You Can Swallow
BURGUNDY IS A DIFFICULT WINE region to understand.
The names of the towns, the wines, the producers, the vineyards and even the grapes combine to form an almost impenetrable barrier to the casual wine drinker.
And then there are the prices.
Here are a few 1988 vintages recently advertised in newspapers and wine-shop catalogues and fliers: Corton-Charlemagne, $170 a bottle; Richebourg, $375; La Tache, $400; Clos de la Roche, $215, and a Musigny for $132.
The 1988 vintage was a very fine one; even so, such prices are difficult for all but the wealthiest buyers to accept -- within memory, many of these wines sold for $25 or less.
It's a case of chronically small supply and constantly growing demand.
Though American Burgundy-style wines are getting better, there is still no substitute for genuine Burgundy -- at least for the time being.
But what about those impossible prices?
I asked Al Hotchkin, owner of the Burgundy Wine Company at 323 West 11th Street in Manhattan and one of the few wine merchants in America who concentrates almost exclusively on the wines of Burgundy.


Miss Murkland Plans to Marry
Mrs.
John Cromwell Murkland of Greenwich, Conn., has announced the engagement of her daughter Lindsey Austen Murkland to Peter Kincaid Hoffman, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
J.
Brooks Hoffman of Greenwich, Conn.
A June wedding is planned.
Miss Murkland is also a daughter of the late Mr.
Murkland.
She teaches first grade at the Nightingale-Bamford School in New York.
She graduated from Wheaton College and has a master's degree in early childhood and elementary education from the Bank Street College of Education.


HAITIAN COMMUNIST SPEAKS OF HEALING
Playing down his longtime Communist affiliation, a compromise candidate for the post of Prime Minister has begun efforts to reassure a torn society that his primary task, if he is ratified for the job, will be to tap talent from across the political spectrum and to heal the country's wounds.
In his first interview since his nomination was approved Wednesday in diplomat-brokered negotiations with the deposed President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Rene Theodore, Haiti's Communist Party leader, described a political evolution that he said had led him to favor "modern capitalism." He promised that any government he formed would be one of true national reconciliation.


Children's Books; Artists as Models
AS a child, happily daubing my way through painting classes in school, I never thought of art as something
grown-ups
did.
And small wonder.
Although my practical-minded parents had heard of Rembrandt, van Gogh, Picasso, and even took me to museums to see their work, they certainly didn't consider them role models.
There were no artists among their friends and acquaintances, nor did they know of anyone who made a living at art.
They didn't mind my mucking about with crayons, but take up art as a career?
Uh-
uh.
The low prestige of artists in those days probably accounts for the fact that there were few children's biographies of them.
The lives I read dealt not with cultural figures, but with men and women of action -- explorers, inventors, nurses, Presidents and sports figures.
In fact, artists were rarely celebrated even in books for adults (unless the artists were crazy, as in "The Moon and Sixpence" and "Lust for Life").
Interestingly enough, the first Pulitzer Prize for a biography whose subject was an artist was awarded only last year, to Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith for "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga."


Maria C. Flynn Plans to Wed
Dulce Cardoso de Almeida Flynn of Rio de Janeiro and Joseph Flynn of Naples, Fla., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Maria Christina Flynn, to Mark Kenwill Schmidt, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

A March wedding is planned.
Ms.
Flynn, 33 years old, is the beauty editor of Seventeen magazine.
She graduated from Wheaton College.
Her father retired as a pilot for Pan Am.


CAMPUS LIFE: Lehigh; Fraternity Joins In To Help Restore 18th-Century Mill
When Albert Werner decided about three years ago that he and his fellow members of the Hellertown Historical Society should restore the Colonial-era gristmill outside the society's headquarters, he didn't realize how big the project would be.
The mill, at the south end of this small eastern Pennsylvania borough near Bethlehem, had been a tavern until the 1940's, and was then used for light storage.
Years of neglect, however, had left all but the stone exterior walls structurally unsound.
"We never knew what we had here," said Mr.
Werner, vice president of the historical society.
"It was in sad shape."


Getting About by Computer: Step-by-Step Programs
IF you are 62 or over and fly a lot, this is a good day to assess the airlines' discount-fare coupon books for seniors, some with recently changed rules.
If your situation matches the rules, it may be worthwhile to move rapidly because the prices of two books are going up this Wednesday.
Two programs allow you to buy seats for travel companions younger than 62; a third allows grandchildren if they are 2 to 11 years old.
One program, Continental's Freedom Passport, is being sold to people as young as 55, but only until Wednesday.
These programs, although not the only airline senior discounts, are still the best deal for older people who travel steadily.
The airlines set the price low because they get the money in advance and then limit the number of coupon seats on each flight; in return, travelers can fly from one coast to the other for around $100.
Those who get full value from these offers have flexible schedules and are not bound by a Monday-Friday workweek.
Blackout days may apply.


JUST ADD WATER
ALEXANDRE DUMAS, PERE, THE 19TH-CENTURY French writer and epicurean, reputedly drank only water.
He claimed that "never has the Grand-Laffite or Chambertin provided me with the delight that a glass of water from a fresh spring could."
Not many Frenchmen would trade their wine for water at the table, but the importance of this essentially free and abundant resource in the kitchen should not be overlooked.
Perhaps more than any other single ingredient, water enhances the natural taste of food, doing its job and then disappearing afterward.


If Russians Now Elect Their President, Why Can't Americans?; No Winner Take All
To the Editor:
Every fourth year, Tom Wicker goes on a snipe hunt against the Electoral College, alleging it is undemocratic.
The division of votes in the Electoral College is a matter of state law.
There is no winner-take-all provision in the Constitution.
Maine has already provided that two of its votes go to the winner statewide, and the other two follow the decisions of the two Congressional districts.


76ers Defeat Clippers, 102-90


A SEARCH YIELDS A SNIPER SUSPECT
A four-hour search for a sniper who sprayed a group of housing police officers with gunfire ended early yesterday morning with the arrest of a man in the 12th floor of his high-rise apartment building in Coney Island, the police said.
The man, Anthony Rodriguez, hit four of five police cruisers with at least eight bullets when the cars, responding to a report of shots being fired, pulled up outside the building shortly after 11 P.M.
Friday night, the police said.


Cynthia Hewitt Plans to Marry
Mr. and Mrs.
Robert A. Hewitt Jr. of Pebble Beach, Calif., have announced the engagement of their daughter Cynthia Diane Hewitt to Nicholas Worthington Philip, the son of Cynthia O. Philip of New York and the late Nicholas W. Philip.

Miss Hewitt, 30 years old, graduated from Smith College and has an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan.
She is a corporate finance associate at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.
Her father is president of Hewitt &amp; Associates, a financial planning firm in Carmel, Calif.


More Worries About Breast Implants
WHEN an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration recommended in November that silicone breast implants be allowed to stay on the market, awaiting more data on their safety, it was hard to tell who was more relieved: the companies who make the devices, the surgeons who insert them, or the estimated two million women hoping for a sign that their decision to have the operation hadn't been a dangerous mistake.
But the issue was far from resolved.
Reports quickly surfaced that a manufacturer, Dow Corning, had withheld memos from its staff questioning the safety of its implants.
And the F.D.A. reprimanded the company for giving out misleading information on its telephone hotline.

Sculpture Show Fills the Housatonic Museum's New Gallery
AT a time when most cultural institutions are becalmed, the Housatonic Museum of Art has taken a step forward.
It is still housed in Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, but its collection, born in 1967 under the administration of Burt Chernow and now more than 4,000 works strong, has a space to call its own -- a spanking new gallery on the third floor.
At 1,100 square feet, this is not the Louvre, but it is an area where excerpts like the present one of sculpture can be concentrated, instead of strung out through the college's corridors, communal areas and offices.
Not that the former arrangement was altogether unsatisfactory, since it meant that everyone -- students, faculty members and other college personnel -- was exposed to the art daily, which was Professor Chernow's principal intention.
Still, familiarity can breed indifference, and few of these 90 sculptures could have been displayed under the previous conditions.


Arizona's 71-Game Home Streak Ends
One of the coolest coaches in college basketball lost his temper this afternoon, and it contributed mightily to ending the longest home-court winning streak in the country.
Behind Don MacLean's 38 points and Darrick Martin's running 12-footer with three-tenths of a second left, and with help from a technical foul assessed to the usually mild-mannered Arizona coach, Lute Olson, second-ranked U.C.L.A. edged sixth-ranked Arizona, 89-87.


At Work With Sheet Metal and Wire, Embellished by Gemstones
VICKI EISENFELD'S meticulously fabricated jewelry takes its coloration from combinations of high-karat gold in yellow, rose, green and white, with the occasional use of gemstones for accent.
The bold ornaments created by Judith Kaufman, on the other hand, are characterized by lavish use of spectacularly colored semi-precious stones set in 22-karat gold.
Both Connecticut goldsmiths are represented in a recently published book, "Contemporary Jewelry Design," by Ettagale Blauer (Van Nostrand Reinhold), which chronicles the 50-year history of the American studio goldsmith movement.
And their work was included in a recent exhibition at the Artium gallery in Manhattan that was organized to illustrate the techniques featured in the book.

Honoring the New


A Man's Eye View of the Long Skirt
IN THE STORY "PENGUIN ISLAND" BY ANATOLE FRANCE, there is a society of intelligent penguins who, as penguins are wont to do, waddle around stark naked in perfectly chilly bliss.
Then one day a single female, a not particularly attractive one, is made to wear clothes.
Soon she has a large retinue of lusting males who follow her wherever she goes.
Soon, too, all the other females begin wearing clothes.
The moral, as old as the idea of fashion: Sometimes, it's not what you show but what you don't show that is the most alluring.
Long skirts are like a secret waiting to be unraveled.
Among the things that men love: the sensual rustle of fabric against leg, the romance and sophistication of a lengthened silhouette, the mystery of what's beneath.
The more modern versions are all about danger.
Most of the new designs are slit, up the sides, back or front, and there is always the shifting drama of these openings.
While a short skirt emphasizes the lower leg, a long skirt gives you a sense of a woman's thighs, and there is a beautiful line to the hips.


Editors' Notes
An article on page 29 of the Arts and Leisure section today about the television producers Joshua Brand and John Falsey discusses their series "I'll Fly Away." After the section went to press, NBC rescheduled the series.
It will not be shown again until Feb. 28, when it will begin appearing regularly on Fridays at 9 P.M.
The article also refers incorrectly to "The White Shadow," a CBS series.
It was about a high school basketball coach.


What Mayor Dinkins Said
Leland Jones, the press secretary to New York City's Mayor, David Dinkins, has a valid complaint.
An editorial last Sunday said Mayor Dinkins "sometimes claims he is being held to a higher standard because he is black." The Mayor has made no such public statement and it was wrong of us to put those words in his mouth.
Mr.
Dinkins has from time to time said that he thinks he is being held to a different standard than previous mayors.
For instance, of the press's early interest in his devotion to tennis, he said perhaps people "would react differently if I shot basketball hoops." Discussing criticism of his fondness for elegant attire, he said, "I suppose some folks are so used to seeing us in dungarees and overalls -- you know, out on the plantation or something."


A Dizzily Romantic Staging of 'My One and Only'
NOTE to the management of the Downtown Cabaret Theater in Bridgeport: To close "My One and Only" just six days before Valentine's Day is to miss the point.
The "new Gershwin musical," as it was advertised for the 1983 Broadway production, is dizzily romantic.
It is also airborne and bubbly, as befits a story about an ace flyer (Capt. Billy Buck Chandler) who falls in love with an aquatic star (Edythe Herbert).


A Professional Whom Age Turned Into a Poet
Art historians can readily list a number of artists, like Titian, Rembrandt, Monet and Matisse, who broke new ground and reached new emotional levels as they grew older.
The careers of such painters should be taught in fitness classes and nursing homes to inspire a certain esteem for human potential in advanced age.
Monet, who had cataracts, at one point could only be certain of the colors he was using by checking the label on the tube.
Matisse's great cutouts were made when he was bedridden and had to draw with a piece of charcoal attached to a long pole.
The "old-age style" is quite rare among photographers (who, after all, have not had as many innings in history as painters have), but it is clearly identifiable in the work of Eugene Atget (1857-1927).
"Atget's Magical Analysis: Photographs, 1915-1927," recently at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, was the first museum exhibition devoted to this aspect of his work.
Thirty pictures by no means exhaust the accomplishments of his later years, but they do give a satisfying glimpse into the mind of a man as he contemplated eternity on his ground glass. (A smaller show of Atget's work from all periods is at the Zabriskie Gallery in Manhattan, through Feb. 15.)

Her father is the president of Investors Security Services in Short Hills.


Syrian Warplane Deal With Russia Reported
A Lebanese newspaper reported today that Syria was negotiating a $2 billion arms deal with Russia involving advanced jet fighters and bombers and long-range surface-to-air missiles.
The daily, Al Hayat, citing Russian informants in London, said the deal was about to be closed after the Syrians had agreed to pay cash in hard currency, as the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin demanded.


Art's Sake
The satisfaction of buying a work of art, something unique in all the world, is a privilege usually afforded only to the rich.
But Herbert and Dorothy Vogel seem to look upon collecting not as a luxury but a necessity.
Mr.
Vogel, a 69-year-old retired postal clerk, and Mrs.
Vogel, a 56-year-old retired reference librarian for the Brooklyn Public Library, share a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with 8 pedigreed cats, 20 turtles and 19 fish as well as some 2,000 late 20th-century paintings, sculptures and drawings that they have acquired over the last three decades.
"We've never been able to save," Mrs.
Vogel said.
"We've always spent our money on art. Now we live on my pension, and Herbie spends his on art." Last week it was announced that the Vogels have pledged their collection, which includes works by John Cage, Christo and Donald Judd, to the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
"We liked the idea of giving art to our nation," Mr.
Vogel said.


Sunday Outing; For Teddy Roosevelt, East 20th St. Was Home
Theodore Roosevelt was an author, explorer, rancher, public servant, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and the inspiration for the Teddy Bear.
He was also the only President of the United States to be born in New York City.
The narrow Manhattan brownstone just west of Gramercy Park where the 26th President was born, in 1858, has been faithfully replicated at the Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site on East 20th Street in Manhattan, between Park Avenue South and Broadway.

Israel Parliament Proves Point of Its Reform Plan
Israel's fractured, contentious Parliament, an institution that it is safe to say inspires few fond thoughts among Israelis, found itself the butt of ridicule this week as the gang that couldn't vote straight.
It might have been laughable, press commentators said, if the subject was not so important: the proposed overhaul of a sclerotic electoral system that in the view of its many critics makes the prime minister a hostage of tiny fringe parties and political extortionists.

Waiting for the Capital Gains Shoe to Drop
Nothing, it is wrongly said, is certain except death and taxes.
In reality, taxes are not a sure thing, and in that fact may lie a partial explanation for the soaring stock market.
Just now, chances seem better that the Government's desperate effort to revive the economy will produce a cut in the capital gains tax rate, a move that would be a boon to shareholders.


Layne Pomerleau Engaged to Wed
Mr. and Mrs.

An Ethnic Road to Riches: The Immigrant Job Specialty
When Parmjit Singh left his job as a mechanic on a Greek ship in 1981, he settled in New York City, instead of returning to the family farm in India.
After working three years as a busboy and cook in a Greek restaurant, Mr.
Singh met a fellow Punjabi who owned a gas station in the city.
"He taught me how to run a station," the 32-year-old Indian recalled.
"It's very hard work but it's easy to run -- to order gas, to clean, to keep the books."

New Yorkers, etc.
A is for appointment books.
A is for address books.
Above all, A is for angst, which is what you get when your appointment/address book is lost/misplaced.
It is a condition most often likened to having one's analyst, internist and periodontist retire on the same day.
Consider the story of Susan Woelzl, who, in the hubbub of the holiday season, inadvertently slipped her appointment book down the chute of a mailbox along with her bill payments.

The Executive Computer; Reports With Sound Effects and Video
Quicktime, one of Apple Computer Inc.'s most exciting recent innovations, holds the promise of making video, animation and sound almost as easy to use in computer programs as text and graphics.
A flood of products designed to take advantage of Quicktime will be demonstrated at the Macworld Expo trade show, which begins today in San Francisco.
Quicktime, which is invisible to the average user, is essentially a set of standards and tools for software developers who are expected to use it to make spreadsheets, data bases, graphics programs, word processors and other applications capable of working with sound and video along with text and standard graphics.
It was sent to software developers last month as an extension of the Macintosh operating system.


Working-Class Pair Now Reigns in Skating
The marinated chicken sandwiches are waiting for Calla Urbanski back at Kid Shelleen's restaurant in Delaware.

"Those little legs can move fast."

How to Sell More U.S. Cars: Japanese Drivers Offer Hints
The very moment that President Bush and American automobile executives were calling on Japan to buy more American cars this week, Tomio Sakamoto was looking over a shiny black Cadillac Seville in a showroom on the Ginza, where it was selling for a pricey $60,000.
"Of course I might buy an American car," said Mr.
Sakamoto, a 43-year-old graphic designer.
"But I remember that my friend had a Pontiac, and it breaks down very often. The brake gets loose and the blinker lever dropped. It's unbelievable it was so badly made."

A Vision of Hollywood Along the Hudson River
PASSING by the County Medical Center in February 1988, people saw a giant crane spraying white foam on the pine trees there.
It wasn't being done for environmental reasons: an office in the Psychiatric Institute was being used in the filming of the movie "Working Girl."
The film crew transformed the office so that it resembled a posh Vermont hospital room, complete with a view of snow-covered trees outside the frosted windows.
The Medical Center received $3,500 for renting the property for a day and a half, and the children hospitalized in the institute received a surprise visit from Sigourney Weaver, who starred in the movie.


PANEL FROM C.I.A. URGES CURTAILING OF AGENCY SECRECY
A panel established by Director Robert M. Gates to explore ways to lift the veil of secrecy at the Central Intelligence Agency has recommended declassifying vast quantities of older documents and making agency officials more accessible to the public.
Intelligence officials say the internal panel has sent Mr.
Gates a list of options that also includes more on-the-record interviews, public speeches and public testimony to Congress by senior agency officials, as well as the release of new material to complement the current publication of maps, world fact books and economic reports.


... and a New Home for a Pioneering Theater
IT'S a success story that could be attributed to impeccable timing, terrific luck and slick marketing.
But it took more than that to move the nonprofit Crossroads Theater Company from its modest beginnings 13 years ago on the second floor of a rickety factory in a depressed area to a new $4 million building in a revitalized district of New Brunswick.
It took the persistence, vision and understated power of Ricardo Khan, who has been instrumental in gaining for Crossroads the artistic credibility and high visibility that affirm its place in the forefront of black theater in America.
All this at a time when the fortunes of the arts in general and professional black theater in particular are withering.


Commercial Property: New Hotels; Staying the Course, Despite the Gloom of Recession
THE FUTURE envisioned by the builders of the Regent New York Hotel at 57 East 57th Street is one that stretches well into the coming decades.
It is the coming months that may pose the greatest challenge.
The 54-story, limestone-clad hotel -- soaring over the neighboring Fuller Building -- is being finished at a time when the real-estate empire of its developer, Harunori Takahashi, is being restructured by Japanese banks.


Miss Thomas to Wed
Mr. and Mrs.
John W. Thomas of Sebring, Fla., have announced June wedding plans for their daughter, Patricia Elaine Thomas, and David W. C. Riatti, a son of Dr.
Pierluigi Riatti of Rye, N.Y., and the late Doris O'Donnell Riatti.
Miss Thomas, 28 years old, is an account executive at the Axcess Marketing Group in Los Angeles.
Mr.
Riatti, 32, is the company's chief operating officer.


Teaching a Good Life, Singing the Bad One
Mercedes Moore leads a double life.
By day she is a no-nonsense teacher who tries to drill discipline and self-confidence into her students at a junior high school on the Lower East Side.
By night she is a frisky, hip-swinging blues singer who incites her audiences to applause and cheers at Manhattan jazz clubs.
The lanky Miss Moore, who has a cascade of dark curls, pulls her audiences into the saucy lyrics of songs she delivers in a voice that can be heard almost to Hoboken.


Justice Put on Hold
There may be as much as $2.8 billion at stake, but to the Federal judge presiding over a lawsuit in Buffalo brought against New York State officials by former inmates of Attica prison, there are more important things to do today than to weigh evidence in the suit.
It charges that the state's violent assault on the prison to end an inmate takeover in 1971 violated prisoners' rights.
The jury began deliberations late last week, but Judge JOHN ELFVIN announced on Friday that there would be no deliberations today, which, not coincidentally, is when the Bills play the Denver Broncos for the American Football Conference championship.


Kariene Koury To Wed in April
Mrs.
Frederick G. Koury of Westport, Conn., has announced the engagement of her daughter Kariene Noelle Koury to Thomas Joseph Maloney 3d, the son of Lois Cavanaugh Maloney of West Hartford, Conn., and the late Thomas J. Maloney Jr.
An April wedding is planned.
Miss Koury, 28 years old, works in institutional sales at Lehman Brothers in New York.
She graduated from Smith College.
Her late father, Frederick G. Koury, was the president of F.G.K.
Associates in Westport, a management consulting firm.
Her mother is a realtor with Prudential Connecticut Realty Company in Westport.


The Drama of the Solemn Child
They stand hunched in doorways, hesitant, their arms crossed.
They have almost no friends and are missing one or both parents.
Their lives are emotionally and often physically distant from adults, who can't seem to see the children standing before them.
These kids are not cheek-pinchingly cute -- the wounded look in their eyes is often their only memorable feature -- and they don't say the darndest things.
Television, theater and particularly dramatic films are increasingly representing childhood as a charged, difficult time, its sunniness mottled by shadows.
And the new crop of young actors chosen to portray these children look as if they know what it's like to be afraid of the dark.
Their ears may stick out, their hair is a nondescript shade, they're gawky or saddled with lingering baby fat.
Complex children's roles have been important elements in such theatrical productions as "The Secret Garden" and "The Good Times Are Killing Me," such films as "Rambling Rose," "Regarding Henry," "Hook," "Grand Canyon" and "Little Man Tate" and the forthcoming "This Is My Life," and such television series as "I'll Fly Away," "Brooklyn Bridge" and "The Simpsons."


Publisher of The News Charts a Tough Course
When he was growing up in the 1950's, James P. Willse, the publisher of The Daily News since Jan. 1, watched his father, a New York police officer, go through a ritual each morning as he read The News, the only paper allowed in the house.
"He would give it a shake," said Mr.
Willse, demonstrating the technique in his office just off the paper's newsroom, "and say, 'Well, let's see who got caught in whose bedroom!' "


Property Taxes
To the Editor:
The article "Homeowners Hit by Local Tax Increases"  [ Dec. 15 ]  about the rise in Long Island property taxes missed a crucial point.
The commercial tax base is eroding because growth companies are leaving the region, furious with the years of business bashing practiced by local government and civic groups.
The resulting tax burden created by the revenue vacuum is being placed on the homeowner.


Radisson Triples Air-Miles Bonus
Radisson Hotels, which normally gives 500 bonus miles to guests who stay at one of the group's hotels after flying with Air Canada, Northwest Airlines or USAir, is tripling the offer to 1,500 miles through March 31.
Travelers have to belong to one of the three airlines' frequent flier programs.
The airlines add the 1,500-mile bonus to a passenger's record on notification from Radisson.
The hotel group has more than 200 hotels at home and abroad.


Bobsledders Get a 2d Chance
An arbitrator ruled today that three members of the United States bobsled team were entitled to a second chance to qualify for the Olympic team.
The arbitrator, Ross Hart, ruled that Edwin Moses, Willie Gault and Greg Harrell, who said they were not properly informed of rule changes by the United States Bobsled Federation, should be allowed to participate in new pushoffs to determine the two four-man bobsled teams that will compete in the Olympics at Albertville, France, next month.

Israeli Settlers See Shift By Arabs to Firearms

Talking: Annuities; It Can Pay To Donate, Not Vacate
FOR the final 10 years of her life, a widow in Newport Beach, Calif., received a $10,000 check each month from nearby Hoag Memorial Hospital.
This was part of an arrangement under which she had agreed to donate her oceanfront estate to the hospital if she could stay there as long as feasible.
She needed the cash to maintain her large home and pay its taxes.
The hospital agreed, realizing it was probably the only way to get the property.
When the woman died in 1989, Hoag got the house and sold it for $6.6 million.


The First Hints That Spring Will Return
THE catalogues are starting to arrive.
The days are getting longer.
These two signs always gladden an impatient gardener's heart.
They are positive hints that spring will indeed get here.
Nursery and seed catalogues are fine winter reading.
They are written in such glowing terms and illustrated with such enticing pictures, it is tempting to select one of everything.
Before long the wish list fills the order page and then some.
When the seed packets and plants arrive, gardeners wonder where everything will go.


A 'No Sale' Sign on Soviet Arms
Italian investigators seize Soviet plutonium bound for parts unknown . . .
Libya reportedly tries to recruit Soviet scientists . . .
Ukraine holds up the removal of nuclear arms from its soil.
These are the latest incidents to sound an alarm about the potential spread of Soviet nuclear arms, material and experts to nuclear have-nots.
The danger has become increasingly clear in recent weeks.
But Washington has reasonable remedies -- if it acts with dispatch.


It's Fun Time for Kerr, Who Gets Set for Return
Tim Kerr, out with a shoulder injury since the fifth game of the season, was scheduled to be in the lineup tonight for the Rangers when they played the Nordiques at the Colisee.

"I'll keep my shifts short and go as hard as I can."


Activist Heads Campaign To Halt Deal With Taiwan
In his 26 years as a production worker at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation's Douglas Aircraft plant in Long Beach, Calif., Bob Gamboa has seen the company endure constant questions about its viability.
But now McDonnell Douglas is planning to sell 40 percent of its commercial aircraft business to Taiwan, and Mr.
Gamboa, who is the political director for the United Aerospace Workers local, fears that the future may be bleak for tens of thousands of aerospace workers in California.
Worried that McDonnell Douglas will phase out production at Long Beach and move jobs to Asia and other sites in the United States, Mr.
Gamboa began an effort last week to rally political pressure to delay the company's planned deal with Taiwan Aerospace.
Backed by California's aerospace workers' unions, Mr.
Gamboa said he wanted to find a "patriotic alternative," like an investment in McDonnell Douglas by companies in the United States or by the unions' own pension funds.


Portland Has Rights, Too
To the Sports Editor:
Robert Lipsyte's column on the women's basketball coach Rene Portland ("Penn State Coach Will Abide by Lesbian Policy, but Won't Discuss It," The Times, Dec. 20), criticizes her for not passing his sexual orientation litmus test.
It is not sufficient that she agree to follow the university policy.
She must also don the hair shirt, apologize for ever having acted differently, and promise not to have any of those politically incorrect thoughts any longer.
That is not the essence of a free society.


Diana Gershon To Wed in May
Mr. and Mrs.
Gerald S. Gershon of Newton, Mass., have announced the engagement of their daughter Diana Gershon to David Erani, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

A May wedding in planned.
Miss Gershon, 23 years old, graduated cum laude from Boston University.
She is an investigator in the New York office of the General Accounting Office.
Her father is the director of quality management at Sky Computers in Chelmsford, Mass.
Her mother, Brenda E. Gershon, is an admissions officer at Boston University.


Taiwan Becomes a Tiger With an Identity Crisis
LIKE a compulsive overachiever who impresses everybody but himself, Taiwan has enjoyed stunning successes in recent years but is gripped by an identity crisis.
Despite having engineered an economic rise that makes Japan look like a slowpoke, and despite having introduced free speech and free elections, Taiwan still seems full of anxiety about itself and uncertainty about what it is.
Until five years ago, when four decades of martial law gave way to a sometimes tempestuous political free-for-all, the answer was clear: Taiwan was an inseparable part of China.
The Nationalist Government here claimed to be the ruler of all China, and in school children spoke Mandarin Chinese rather than the Taiwan dialect and learned about the history of mainland China rather than Taiwan.


Community Offers a Home Away From Home for Homework
ERIN PIKOR, 12 years old, was sitting in a large room in the Wallingford municipal building on a recent afternoon, working on her homework assignment, an English essay.
Several other sixth and seventh graders were busy with their own lessons.
"It's better than the library, because you can talk," Miss Pikor said of the Homework Place, as the room is called.
"And I don't want to go home, because my sister's there. She's 10, and she can be a pain."


Filming Life, He Found His Own
"Thirty-five Up," the latest installment in the documentary series about the lives of 14 Britons, is the culmination of 28 years' work, and as far as I know is the longest-running project in the history of film.
It started in 1964 with "7 Up," a documentary produced by Granada Television that looked at Britain through the eyes of these individuals as 7-year-olds.
I was 22, had just left Cambridge University with a law degree and had been hired to find the children from as diverse backgrounds as possible and, with the director Paul Almond, to get their opinions on money, love, God, sex, race, school and one another.
We also wanted to know what they had in mind for their futures.
These were the politicians, managers, union leaders and parents of the year 2000, so what kind of England could we look forward to?
We used the Jesuit idea "give me a child until he is 7 and I will show you the man," but, frankly, our underlying concept was political.
Granada was a left-wing company, and in the heady days of 1964 when England was the pop-cultural center of the world, we wanted to see whether the dynamics that gave fame and fortune to the Beatles, the Stones and other icons had permeated our class system.
Did everybody have a fair chance, or did the accident of birth bring power, wealth and success?
Were children made into winners or losers by class divisions, or was the old order changing forever?


Review/Opera; Taking Full Advantage Of the Met's Resources
There are times in the life of the Metropolitan Opera when a particular work fits the house's grand dimensions, when the depths and boundaries of the Met's technical resources match the opera at hand instead of swallowing it up.
Two years ago, August Everding and Hans Schavernoch created a production of "Der Fliegende Hollander" that not only occupies this big stage, but also uses its size for expressive purposes.
Wagner's opera -- perhaps the point at which he turned from his Italianate apprenticeship toward a new German art -- returned to the Met on Thursday evening with a particularly strong and suitable cast.
There are seven more performances coming up, and believers in this particular piece should have a look.

A la Carte: An Irish Gem Sparkles in St. James
THE Dublin Delights Cafe in St.
James is a tiny sparkling shamrock of a place.
Behind its multipaned cottage windows are just six tables and a small bar.
Inside the bright, cheery, clean cafe, diners in sweaters, plaid shirts and jeans eat Irish- and English-style pub food considerably superior to that usually found in Dublin or London.
The leprechaun-size charmer comes complete with a clover-shaped clock, a cow-shaped blackboard, green-bordered wallpaper and wonderful posters of Irish pubs, castles, writers, family names and Dublin doors.


A Better Mousetrap
To the Editor:
I have to disagree with David Richards's comment about musicals in regional theater  [ "Is There Life Beyond Broadway? Yes and No," Dec. 8 ] .
"The ambition," Mr.
Richards writes, "is to build a better mousetrap, which, in the theater, has come to mean concocting the next big Broadway musical."


Rosslyn Castle
To the Editor: I was delighted to read the excellent article by Andrew Sinclair on those two Scottish architectural jewels, Rosslyn Chapel and Rosslyn Castle ("Secrets of Scotland's Rosslyn Chapel," Sept. 22).
I know the area well: for two years I was resident as administrator of Rosslyn's sister castle, Hawthornden, home to a retreat for writers.
Mr.
Sinclair captures well the enchantment and startling beauty of one of the last unspoilt glens in Scotland.
Any traveler to Edinburgh should set aside a morning for Roslin, only 20 minutes by taxi from the city.
Once there, you are guaranteed a warm welcome from the curator of the chapel, Judy Fisken, and her volunteers.
A guided tour (often available on request) is essential for picking out the carvings and inscriptions.
Although there can never be a substitute for the original, tourists in London can still admire the beauty of Rosslyn Chapel via a plaster cast of a section of the interior, including the legendary Apprentice Pillar, in the Victoria and Albert Museum.


A Cast Changes And, Suddenly, A Play Is Reborn
Since the push is on for accuracy in labeling these days, it occurs to me that theater criticism ought to come with a cautionary warning.
Somewhere in the notices -- rapturous or otherwise -- shouldn't it be recorded, "Perishable contents" or "Invalid after June 1"?
We like to think -- we who produce it, especially -- that criticism is timeless.
But its shelf life is probably not significantly longer than that, say, of a carton of yogurt.
The reason is plain.
Critics bear witness to a singular event, destined by the conditions of its making never to be the same again.
The theatergoer rarely sees what the critics see, and by that I don't mean what the critics
perceive
. (That's another, thornier, issue.) I mean what they actually, physically, see.


Review/Dance; Athletes and Plexiglass Share Stage in 'Impact'
The best came last in a performance by the Elizabeth Streb Ringside company on Thursday night in the Altogether Different festival at the Joyce Theater.
Just as it began to seem as if there would be nothing to the evening but brutal belly flops and collisions, Ms.
Streb presented "Impact," a magical dance for six athletic performers, a Plexiglas panel and a frame hanging high over the stage, all bathed in gleaming white and yellow light.
An assault on heaven, the piece had welcome moments of gentleness and wit that made it clear that these were not just bionic bodies, but fallible human beings.
The work had a decent quotient of extraordinary physical feats.
A man slowly straightens from a squat, a woman balancing perilously on his shoulders as he rises.
But then, after a measured walk back toward the panel, he flips up and she vaults to the other side and crashes against the glass, knocking the man flat as if by seismic repercussion.
The sequence, a chain reaction of sorts, is breathtaking in its complexity, fluency and sly allusion to the knockabout physicality that is at the heart of Ms.
Streb's work.


An Ethnic Road to Riches: The Immigrant Job Specialty
When Parmjit Singh left his job as a mechanic on a Greek ship in 1981, he settled in New York City, instead of returning to the family farm in India.
After working three years as a busboy and cook in a Greek restaurant, Mr.
Singh met a fellow Punjabi who owned a gas station in the city.
"He taught me how to run a station," the 32-year-old Indian recalled.
"It's very hard work but it's easy to run -- to order gas, to clean, to keep the books."


CAMPUS LIFE: North Carolina; Future M.D.'s Show a Dramatic Flair
The question, "Is there a doctor in the house?" can easily empty the stage at the University of North Carolina, where the medical students are as likely to be reciting their lines for the U.N.C.
Staged Readings Company as they are to be tucked into their classrooms reciting their lessons.
The company has been performing through the fall semester as part of the North Carolina Medicine in Society Reader's Repertory Theater, whose members -- medical school students and faculty members -- perform and discuss stories about common problems in doctor-patient relationships.

Her father retired as president of Pinefield Drug, a drug store in Framingham.


All About/Tax Preparers; Doing Taxes for the Lazy, the Nervous and the Rich
Almost half of the 114 million individuals who filed Federal income tax returns in 1991 used a paid professional to help them.
But the industry that has sprung up to prepare those returns is diffuse, unstructured and virtually unregulated.
Though no one keeps track of its size, the individual-tax preparation industry generates billions of dollars in fees a year.
Minimal rules governing the practice of preparers have been established by the Internal Revenue Service.
They include requirements like signing every return prepared, providing a Social Security number, retaining a completed copy of the return and furnishing a copy to the taxpayer.


Topics of The Times; In a Lacquered Zoo
The latest addition to the many menageries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art is on the ground floor.
Go left at the entrance, past the head of the angry Aurelius, then right after the Roman frescoes into rooms inhabited by beasts and birds that have been carved and inlaid into the lacquered surfaces of ancient cabinets, bowls and trays.
Half a dozen dappled deer with mother-of-pearl antlers chatter at each other on a 17th-century stationery box.
Gilded crabs sit on golden sea grass, a black cricket hops across a pale moon and coiled dragons gnash their pearly teeth.
The exhibition of the Florence and Herbert Irving collection of East Asian lacquer encompasses work done from the 12th century to the 18th century in China, Japan, Korea and Okinawa, a region where the lacquer tree grows.
Its sap, refined and colored, is applied layer after layer to wood or metal, then endlessly rubbed.
The patient rubbing and the passage of time have given the lacquerware its special tactile quality: your fingertips seem to feel what your eyes are seeing.

CONGRESSMAN SAYS GIRL WAS CREDIBLE
The co-chairman of a Congressional panel has defended his decision to conceal the identity of a teen-age Kuwaiti girl whose account of Iraqi atrocities helped to stir American opinion in favor of the Persian Gulf war, arguing that the fact that her father was the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States did not alter her credibility.
An article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times on Monday asserted that it was irresponsible for the Congressional Human Rights Caucus to propagate the accusation that Iraqi soldiers had removed scores of babies from Kuwaiti hospital incubators and left them to die without identifying the young woman beyond her first name, Nayirah.

Reading Hemingway Without Guilt
IT is not fashionable these days to praise the work of Ernest Hemingway.
His women too often seem to be projections of male needfulness.
There are too many examples of his lifelong anti-Semitism, his affection for denigrating black people in just too many forums private and public.
And he was violent: he loved the bullfights, he wrote of them with zeal, explaining away the cruelty to bulls and horses by celebrating how the matador danced with death.
And he was just plain mean.
As we reread "A Moveable Feast," we experience Hemingway's ingratitude, his viciousness to Ford Madox Ford, to F. Scott Fitzgerald, to Gertrude Stein; and when we consider his treatment of Stein, we have to recall Hemingway's defamation of homosexuals.


The Middle Class Feels Betrayed, But Maybe Not Enough to Rebel
IF the 150-or-so million people who are loosely called the middle class are so steamed up about stagnant wages and big debts, about rising taxes and medical bills, about the bosses of floundering corporations who collect multimillion-dollar salaries while firing thousands of workers, will they take it any more?
Indeed they might.

Simon Tackles Farce in Slick Staging of 'Rumors'
BY now, everyone knows that Neil Simon isn't only kidding.
He's been as facile at baring emotional scars, exploiting neuroses and unearthing animosities and other unpleasantries -- at hurting while laughing, to spin off one of his own titles -- as he was at simply jesting in his earliest works.
In "Rumors," his 23d play and 1988 contribution to the Broadway coffers, the American theater's most consistent generator of hits suddenly reverted to wisecracking for its own sake.


The Rules Change, the Problems Don't
IN last year's State of the City speech, Mayor David N. Dinkins promised "a new beginning." This year he invoked the poet Georgia Douglas Johnson as he wistfully envisioned a city government that would allow New Yorkers "to call our dreams." Instead, his beleaguered constituents seem more likely to get a jarring wake-up call shortly, as escalating financial and political pressures converge.
Next week, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo is scheduled to unveil a $52 billion state budget, in which he promised no new taxes.
He held out no such hope regarding new pain, which the recession is likely to inflict on consumers of state services and on recipients of state aid -- including New York City.
Mr.
Dinkins's own financial plan was due this week, but he asked the City Council for a delay until Jan. 30 so he can factor the precise dimensions of that pain in projecting the city's own budget deficit.


Bahamas Lifts Duty on Items For Consumers
The Bahamas has abolished customs duty on jewelry, perfume and other goods to put the country in line with other duty-free centers in the Caribbean like St.
Martin and St.
Thomas.
On Jan. 1 the Government scrapped the duty on certain imported goods to reduce prices and thus encourage cruise passengers and other visitors to spend more on shopping.
The items freed from duty also include watches, china, linen, liquor and crystal.
The amounts of duty that merchants had to pay and passed on to consumers were, for china and glass, 15 percent of value; leather goods, 20 percent; perfume, colognes and toilet water, 25 percent; photographic equipment, 5 percent; jewelry, 25 percent; clocks and watches, 10 percent; sweaters, 5 percent; linens and table linens, 15 percent, and liquor, $12 to $18 a gallon.

TILL DEBT DO US PART
Your article unwittingly reveals the secret of what makes a great divorce lawyer.
During the years I practiced law in New York before moving to California, I learned that there are no kinder or more generous lawyers than the members of the New York matrimonial bar.
Their ability to look beyond Alvin Ashley's obvious vulgarity demonstrates the ability to believe the best, to cast aside dark doubts about human nature and to embrace the complex organism we call a human being.
It is this ability to accept people nonjudgmentally that makes them such excellent divorce lawyers for their clients.

World Markets; The Year of the Foreign Bond
Bonds were generally more friendly than stocks for Americans investing abroad last year.
High interest rates in some countries, like Italy, and strong capital gains combined with high interest rates in others, like Australia, all helped to outpace average foreign stock returns by more than six percentage points.
Overall, bonds in the 11 foreign markets included in the J. P. Morgan government bond index were up 15.9 percent for 1991, compared to a 9.4 percent return for the stock markets in the same countries, according to the Financial Times index of world markets.
The 1991 return for foreign bonds matched that of 1990, when bond markets far outpaced stock markets, which tumbled because of the threat of the Persian Gulf war.

White House Memo; Doubt Is Spoiler in Bid to Be Vice Presidential
Vice President Dan Quayle went to New Hampshire this week to bury Patrick J. Buchanan, but found instead that the conservative challenger to President Bush came to the Vice President's defense after Mr.
Bush collapsed in Japan.

Buchanan told a New Hampshire radio audience, "but he's been a pretty good Vice President. He's knowledgeable. I don't think people should be unduly alarmed at the prospect that he would be President."


Chess
Vasily Ivanchuk, who many believe will become a challenger for Gary Kasparov's world title one of these years, defeated the Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman in the traditional Katholieke Radio Omroep exhibition match.
Ivanchuk, a 21-year-old Ukrainian grandmaster, scored 3 1/2-2 1/2 in the 10th running of the six-game contest staged Dec. 16-23 at KRO's broadcasting studios in Hilversum, the Netherlands.
That was not as close as the score might indicate.
Ivanchuk already had achieved the winning tally of 3 1/2 points after the fifth game and lost only the rump sixth game, which was played solely for the enjoyment of the spectators and the television and radio audiences.
Ivanchuk won the first two games and won the decisive half points by drawing the third, fourth and fifth games.

Q.
Can I get information on dude ranches in the Northeast? -- Edward Solomon, Westbury, L.I.
A.
There are several resorts, mainly in upstate New York, that offer horseback riding as their main focus.
Rates include all meals, riding and other activities, unless stated otherwise.


Bible Giveaway Is a Rural Ritual to Some, an Offense to Others
For as long as anybody can remember in this country town on the Iroquois River, autumn was the time when the hickory leaves turned bright yellow, farmers hauled in their corn and soybeans, and churchmen from up the road came to school to pass out Gideon Bibles to every fifth grader.
It was a ritual as certain and as ordinary as the first frost and measles shots, and is still a tightly held tradition in many rural public schools from the Carolinas to Idaho.


Corrections
A picture on Dec. 29 with a report about the engagement of Kathleen O'Connell and Raymond James Peloso was published in error.
It showed Beth Ann Mooney, who is engaged to Jeffrey Longcope.
A report of their engagement appeared the same day.


Devils Find the Loss Of Crowder Is a Gain
The contributions of Dave Barr and Randy McKay to the Devils' success so far this season have made New Jersey a winner in its loss of the free agent Troy Crowder to Detroit last summer.
Because Crowder was the Devils' most effective enforcer last season, the Devils asked that the Red Wings provide Bob Probert, one of the most feared fighters in the National Hockey League, as compensation.
But the arbitrator in the matter, Judge Edward Houston of Ottawa, chose Detroit's proposal, Barr and McKay.

Power Struggle
AS THE GREAT WHALE River rises east out of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada, its broad sandy shores quickly give way to a carpet of light-green lichen studded with granite outcroppings.
Beyond the banks lies a vast expanse of black spruce and tamarack, great coniferous forests broken here and there by lakes and bogs and kettle ponds.
In winter, the taiga can be harsh and remorseless, a region racked by "wind, snow and natural violence of every sort," as an adventurer described it a half-century ago.
But it is also a landscape that teems with life in fall and spring, when enormous herds of caribous stomp across the earth and millions of migratory birds tarry in the estuaries of James and Hudson Bays, some stopping to double their weight as they feast on eelgrass and coastal shrimp before flying as far south as Tierra del Fuego.
It is quiet in summer: on an August evening there is utter silence in the northern Quebec bush, save for the rippling of the river or the honking of a pair of geese overhead in a salmon-colored sky.
This subarctic wilderness is, in any season, an unlikely subject of an international controversy.
But that is precisely what it has become hundreds of miles away, in southern Quebec and in New York State's capital, Albany, where the central question about the Great Whale River basin is this: Should large parts of it be underwater?
Hydro-Quebec, a utility owned by the province of Quebec, envisions flooding the Great Whale as the second of three phases in a planned hydroelectric power system of colossal proportions.
To harness the kinetic energy in 20 wild rivers, Hydro-Quebec plans to erect three dozen huge dams and hundreds of dikes across the taiga, ultimately redrawing terrain in an area the size of France.


The 2:07 Waltz
To the Sports Editor:
There are times when sports fans must give thanks.
Like last Saturday when John Elway, writhing through an onslaught of pursuing bodies, coming from behind as he has so many times before, brought the Denver Broncos downfield, 87 yards in 1 minute 51 seconds, to set up Jeff Treadwell's game-winning field goal.

Salads in Wintertime Require Freshness, and Some Ingenuity
IN cold weather, salad making calls for some creative thinking on the part of the cook.
Tender lettuces are usually expensive and may not be in the best condition, having suffered damage from frost on the way to market.
Other classic salad ingredients, like tomatoes, are typically inedible.
Decent off-season ones are costly -- as much as $3 a pound -- and even at that price may not have the flavor of summer's crop.
Similarly, small, heavily waxed and often frost-bitten cucumbers may not be worth the money.


CAMPUS LIFE: Yeshiva; Estonians Learn Jewish Tradition By U.S. Instruction
After teaching Jewish children in Estonia for a year, students from Yeshiva University and an organization they founded are preparing to help the Estonians teach themselves.
Since last January, two university students have been sent for monthlong stays at the Jewish day school in Tallinn, Estonia, where they teach Jewish law and tradition to the school's 240 pupils.
At night, the visitors teach adult education classes.


Conference Championships -- IN A WORD: DEFENSE; How Do You Stop This Guy?
Denver quarterback John Elway has inspired equal parts admiration and determination among the Buffalo Bills' defenders.
For the most part, the Bills are amazed at the things that he does.
But they have resolved not to let him do those things to them Sunday afternoon when Buffalo and Denver play in the American Football Conference championship game here at Rich Stadium.


Lions' Bandwagon May as Well Be an Import
Four seasons ago, when he was an impressionable rookie linebacker for the Detroit Lions, Chris Spielman discovered the emotional bond between the team and its fans at the Silverdome.
"It was discouraging to have fans throw beer and pop on you," Spielman recalled.
"It was discouraging to get booed as you left the field."


Fighting Back Against TV
To the Editor:
"A Conservative Look in Newsprint" (Forum, Dec. 29) took the troubling position of saying America's newspapers face the future with slight hope of maintaining media prominence given the constancy of newspaper closings.


New &amp; Noteworthy
THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE, by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. (Bantam Spectra, $5.99.) What if the computer -- powered by steam instead of electricity -- had been developed in England in the 1820's?
In this novel "the historical, cultural and scientific repercussions are enormous, as they have been in our own time, and the resulting counter-Victorian era is elaborated with a Dickensian density of imaginative detail," Thomas M. Disch said here last year.
BEYOND LOVE, by Dominique Lapierre.


Symphonic Niche for Young and Old
THE Fine Arts Symphony came into being two seasons ago, partly to compensate for the loss of the Chappaqua Symphony.
The latter orchestra, reduced to chamber proportions, has just come back to life (its opening concert was last night), but the Fine Arts has gone on to carve out its own niche in North Tarrytown and Bronxville, where the season continues next weekend under the music director, Louis Simon.
The repertory is standard but sure-fire: the Fourth Brandenburg Concerto of Bach, Brahms's First Symphony and the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto, with Benjamin Hudson as guest soloist.
Mr.
Hudson's recent CD recording of that work was praised by one critic as "utterly convincing and highly recommended." Starting times are 8 P.M.
Saturday at Sleepy Hollow High School and 3 P.M. next Sunday in the Bronxville School on Pondfield Road.


Bedford School Plans Program on Parenting
BLAME the recession or the stresses felt by working couples.
Whatever the reason, parenting seems to have hit hard times.
"People have forgotten how to enjoy their children," a psychologist was overheard saying at a recent holiday party in Scarsdale.
A local school administrator agreed.
"Parents today feel a lot of insecurity," she said.
In a recent report stating that many American 5-year-olds were not ready for kindergarten, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recommended parent-education programs as one way to help get families on track.
The Rippowam Cisqua School, an independent day school here for prekindergarten through ninth grade, was ahead of the game in planning just such a program to help celebrate its 75th anniversary.


Dropping Athlete Title
After a season and a half as a scholar-athlete, Penn sophomore WILL McALLISTER has decided to try just scholarship without the hyphen for a while.
Coach FRAN DUNPHY said that McAllister, the Ivy League's rookie of the year last season, would skip basketball during the spring semester to concentrate on his course work. (AP)


Kristin A. Rae To Wed in May
Mr. and Mrs.
James M. Rae of New Canaan, Conn., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Kristin Ann Rae, to Charles Edward Gray Allen, a son of Mrs.
Duncan Allen of London and the late Mr.
Allen.
A May wedding is planned.
Miss Rae, 25 years old, is a program development assistant at the Children's Television Workshop in New York.
She graduated from Northwestern University.
Her father is a lawyer in New York.
Her mother, Ann Rae, is an artist's representative in New Canaan.


Italian or Mexican: A Matter of Choice
THE opening of another pasta-pizza restaurant on Long Island is not news.
The appearance of a cafe offering both Italian and Mexican food is.
Viva Loco in Bellmore unites two cuisines that have nothing in common geographically, historically or culturally.
Yet, the partnership is serendipitous.
Pizzettas, big bowls of pasta, nachos, tacos and enchiladas are all casual dishes and easy on hard-hit recessionary budgets.


Casa Blanca Reopens in San Juan
The restored Casa Blanca in San Juan, built in 1521 as the residence of the first governor of Puerto Rico and believed to be the oldest continuously occupied residence in the Western Hemisphere, is now open to the public.
The building is furnished with 16th- and 17th-century pieces and houses two museums, the Juan Ponce de Leon Museum and the Taino Indian Ethno-Historic Museum.
The house stands on land given by the Spanish Crown to Ponce de Leon.
The explorer died the year the house was built, but it remained in his family for 250 years.
It is the oldest of about 800 Spanish Colonial buildings in Old San Juan, a National Historic Zone.


TILL DEBT DO US PART
Margolick is inaccurate when he says that lawyers who did matrimonial work years ago, like me, were known as the garbage men of the profession.
Margolick should have pointed out that the "progressive" state of New York, until recently, permitted divorce
only
on the grounds of adultery, evidence of which was rarely found in a library, a church or in any place other than an apartment.
Lawyers who involved themselves in raiding apartments did so because that's where the evidence was, not because they were garbage men.

POSTINGS: A Happy Landlord; Reviving the Goelet's Glory
A 15-year effort to recapture the vibrant elegance of the Goelet Building -- an overlooked masterpiece by McKim, Mead &amp; White -- is to take a big step forward soon.
The Bombay Company, a furniture and furnishings store, plans to recreate much of the bold, curving arcade that wraps around Broadway and 20th Street.
An intrusive modern storefront, which obliterated the corner entrance, is to be removed.
And window bays that had been sealed are to be reopened.
The architect is Roy Euker of Manhattan and the designer is Ruth Mellergaard of the International Design Group's New York office.
Jeffrey J. Justin, whose family has owned the building since 1977, said he has been "trying to bring it back as close to the original as I can." His efforts have included an ambitious restoration of the lobby.
When Bombay decided to take the 5,000-square-foot space
and
restore the facade, he said, "It made me the happiest artistic landlord in New York."


Transit Police Reach Accord With New York on Contract
After working 18 months without a contract, the transit police union reached a tentative settlement with New York City that for the first time would provide pension benefits equal to those received by New York City Police Department officers.
The contract, modeled after an arbitration panel's decision on the city police contract in November, includes a number of concessions from the union, mostly in pay for new officers.


Washington: Interactive Multimedia for the 2000's
BY any measure, computers and television represent advances in the presentation and storage of information every bit as powerful as the development of the alphabet and the printing press.
In downtown Washington, a new permanent exposition now offers visitors an incomparable glimpse of the next great breakthrough in information technology: a joining of video images, computer processing, sound and text that has come to be known as interactive multimedia.
In its most elementary application, interactive multimedia is already a fixture in millions of American homes in the form of Nintendo and other video games.
But the Tech 2000 Exposition, situated midway between the White House and the Capitol, goes much further in offering more than 60 other hands-on applications of the multimedia format.
In effect, an airy hall has been turned into an electronic playhouse and a compelling vision of what's coming to schools, businesses and homes in the 21st century.
Plan on spending a few hours because the exposition is the computer-age equivalent of a carnival midway.

NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Portsmouth, R.I.; A Boys Town For the Future
AS part of a nationwide effort to expand its care of troubled children, Boys Town U.S.A. is building a residential center in this town of 16,800 residents five miles north of Newport.
It will serve as New England headquarters.
Founded in 1917 in Omaha by the Rev.
Edward J. Flanagan, the nonprofit organization plans to build five ranch-style homes on 20 acres here.
Each will have 6 children, age 10 to 16, supervised by a married couple.
Three will be for boys and two for girls, who were first admitted to the Omaha community in 1979.

On the Street; Giving Legs a Satiny Glitter and Gleam
New satin-finish stockings that gleam in the daylight and glitter in the sun are being seen around town these winter days.
They are favored by women who wear above-the-knee hemlines and high-heel pumps.
This feminine look has nothing to do with trousers, boots, sneakers and moccasins.
The legs have a lacquered look, as if they had just been painted in inky black or in rare instances, a vibrant color.


Tainted Data
For years David B. Straus, a professor of biochemistry at the State University of New York's College at New Paltz, has been studying the effect of toxic chemicals on DNA.
But a recent experiment, involving PCB carcinogens, was entirely unintentional.
His laboratory was exposed to the chemicals late last month when a car hit a utility pole, setting off a power surge that caused transformers in five campus buildings to overheat.
The manufacture of PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, was banned in the late 1970's, but some older transformers still use them as a coolant.
The science building, where his laboratory is, a theater and three dormitories will be closed until contaminated material can be destroyed.
Professor Straus is afraid that the casualties will include seven years' worth of research notebooks and files.
"That's your professional life's work, and you don't want to lose it," he said.
"But if the contamination is serious and widespread, you can't risk it."


Beth McCabe and Dean Bornstein Are to Wed

Noted With Pleasure
Passing the Gift On
We may imagine the most humane elements of our nature originate with us.
In fact, they are an inheritance preserved and passed down by each generation, according to a character in the story "The Cardinal's Third Tale," included in "Last Tales" by Isak Dinesen (Vintage, paper).
There are many things in life which a human being . . . may attain by personal endeavor.
But there exists a true humanity, which will ever remain a gift, and which is to be accepted by one human being as it is given to him by a fellow human.
The one who gives has himself been a receiver.
In this way, link by link, a chain is made from land to land and from generation to generation.
Rank, wealth and nationality in this matter all go for nothing.
The poor and downtrodden can hand over the gift to kings, and kings will pass it on to their favorites at Court or to an itinerant dancer in their city. . . .
Strange and wonderful is it to consider how in such community we are bound to foreigners whom we have never seen and to dead men and women whose names we have never heard and shall never hear, more closely even than if we were all holding hands.
Art's True Purpose
It isn't art's business to show us the world, Oscar Wilde asserted in an 1889 essay on Shakespeare: its true purpose is to hold up a mirror to our souls.
This is from "The Fireworks of Oscar Wilde," edited by Owen Dudley Edwards (Barrie &amp; Jenkins/Trafalgar Square, paper).
We become lovers when we see Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet makes us students.
The blood of Duncan is upon our hands, with Timon we rage against the world, and when Lear wanders out upon the heath the terror of madness touches us.
Ours is the white sinlessness of Desdemona, and ours, also, the sin of Iago.
Art, even the art of fullest scope and widest vision, can never really show us the external world.
All that it shows us is our own soul, the one world of which we have any real cognizance. . . .
It is Art, and Art only, that reveals us to ourselves.
Touching the Past
It is in the study of our local history, the artifacts and buildings of our immediate surroundings, that we come closest to an encounter with the past.
This is from a 1927 essay by Lewis Mumford, included in "Hudson Valley Lives," edited by Bon nie Marranca (Overlook).
The things that we can see and touch are those that awaken our imagination. . . .
Nothing has ever made me, for one, feel the might of the Roman Empire more keenly than stumbling across the tiles and foundations of a Roman villa in the midst of a quiet English field.
Local history touches off these things that have happened on the spot; and the facts of local history become parts of a person's own life to an extent which is rare with scenes and incidents one has taken out of books and secondhand accounts. . . .
Every old part of the country is filled with the memorials of our past: tombstones and cottages and churches, names and legends, old roads and trails and abandoned mines, as well as the things we built and used yesterday.
All these memorials bring us closer to the past and, so doing, they bring us closer to our own present; for we are living history as well as recording it; and our memories are as necessary as our anticipations.
Our Home in the Desert
We may never have traveled to a desert, but the idea of that landscape as a place of stark clarity, and of struggle, haunts our imaginations, according to Charles Bowden in his memoir "De sierto: Memories of the Future" (Norton).
Deserts can be very specific places for a botanist or a zoologist.
But not for most of us.
We tend to see deserts as a quality more than a place.
To go off into the desert in our language means not to visit a locale, but a state of mind.
And so if we consider a very specific desert, the Sonoran, and a very specific place, El Camino del Diablo, we still cannot really contain ourselves with bundles of the specifics -- checklists of plants, and animals, weather reports of startling June days and cold January nights.
That is why when we read the . . .
Bible, a very early collection of desert writings, we feel an eerie kinship with the wandering Hebrews.
Not in the promised land.
Not in Egypt.
Not in Babylon.
But in the Sinai.
Every one of us, regardless of where we are sitting on this planet, no matter what the birds are trilling in the green forest outside our window, every one of us snaps alert with a clear sense of the ground when the Hebrews enter Sinai and begin their long trial by God in the desert.
Fragrant, Delicious Words
Language and food are so intertwined, it is now hard to imagine one without the other.
This is from "The Secret Life of Food: A Feast of Food and Drink History, Folklore and Fact" by Martin Elkort (Tarcher, paper).
The English language is marinated in food words; words that describe food and its qualities and also serve as reliable metaphors and similes when other words fail.
How many breathless poets and tongue-tied lovers have compared the lips of their beloved to cherries, their cheeks to peaches?
How many call their beloved honey, or sugar, to express tenderness or curry favor?
How many babies are the apple of their parents' eyes, who regularly bring home the bacon, to provide a nest egg for their brood?
How many people feel sheepish if they do something wrong, and have to eat humble pie in atonement? . . .
From the time the first caveman grunted in appreciation as he came upon a berry-laden bush, we have been searching for the right word to describe and classify each fruit, each vegetable and each food animal.
The search for food builds a strong appetite for words to describe them, and the words themselves become capable of stimulating the appetite by bringing forth fragrant, delicious images.


Barkley Demonstrates He Is Not Past His Prime
When Iran Barkley came into the ring at the Paramount at Madison Square Garden on Friday night, it was clear he was spoiling for a fight.
In a hooded robe, his face was a visage of bad intentions.
So wrought-up was the fighter from the South Bronx that he had to be restrained by his trainer, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, from getting physical with his opponent, Darrin Van Horn, the International Boxing Federation supermiddleweight champion, even before the opening bell.


Q and A
Refinancing a Mortgage Question: My home was financed by First Northern Mortgage Corporation.
After two months, First Northern sold my mortgage to Midlantic Home Mortgage Corporation.
I decided to refinance the loan.
At closing I was told I had to pay a state mortgage tax, which I had paid the first time.
Do I have to pay this tax again? . . .
Gurunath Pasumarty, Rego Park, Queens Answer: Maybe.
According to Carl Felsen, a spokesman for the State Department of Taxation and Finance, your liability for the tax payment depends on whether the refinanced loan is a new mortgage or just a modification of the original agreement.


Democrats Fail to Kill the Tax Rise That Doomed Them
FOLKLORE has it that just about every seven years the Jersey Devil reappears to rampage through the state, setting blood boiling and stirring the locals into fits of hysteria.
The Devil is said to be kin to Bigfoot and to the Fouke monster of Arkansas, and statehouse legend holds that the scowling carving on the clerk's podium in the General Assembly is its very image.


Fire Roars Through a Chemical Plant in Newark
A spectacular explosion and fire visible for miles around roared through a chemical plant in Newark late Friday night.
One worker suffered critical burns over much of his body, and 13 other people -- workers, firefighters and police officers -- were injured in the blaze, which heavily damaged the plant.
Newark fire officials said a vat of plastic resin used in the manufacture of paint pigments apparently exploded shortly before 11:30 P.M. on the top floor of the five-story Reichhold Chemical Company plant in an industrial section lined with chemical and manufacturing plants.


To Repair Door Locks, Try Replacing the Cylinder
PROBLEMS with door locks do not always mean that the entire knob and latch assembly has to be removed or replaced.
Often just removing the lock cylinder, the part containing the keyhole, is necessary.
The cylinder can be taken to a locksmith for repair, replacement or changing the key.
Removing and reinstalling the cylinders of most locks, usually an easy job, require just a few ordinary tools.
But if a cylinder cannot be removed with such tools, the job will require a licensed locksmith.


Father Time Need Not Be A Dancer's Enemy
Old dancers seldom fade away.
They simply tend to disappear, often dropping precipitously out of sight, then bobbing up later as caterers, masseurs or teachers.
But a few remain on stage, dancing well past their theoretical prime.
Some offer transcendent lessons on the art of dance.
Performances by Dudley Williams, Beverly Blossom and Anthony Dowell, all veterans in their late 40's and beyond, have been among the most illuminating of the year just ended.
There was a world of vivid information about the stage and the heart, for example, in the eloquently placed yet seemingly effortless stretch of Mr.
Williams's arms and legs in performances last month with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
A solo performer, Ms.
Blossom has a way of standing center stage, turbulently still, and filling that stage with a sense of memory and wry humor beyond the ken of most youthful purveyors of multiple pirouettes or resilient falls.


Salads in Wintertime Require Freshness, and Some Ingenuity
IN cold weather, salad making calls for some creative thinking on the part of the cook.
Tender lettuces are usually expensive and may not be in the best condition, having suffered damage from frost on the way to market.
Other classic salad ingredients, like tomatoes, are typically inedible.
Decent off-season ones are costly -- as much as $3 a pound -- and even at that price may not have the flavor of summer's crop.
Similarly, small, heavily waxed and often frost-bitten cucumbers may not be worth the money.


What Can Candidates Expect to Keep Private?
PSYCHOANALYSIS was never meant to be practiced from the back of a campaign plane by a press corps with problems of its own.
But in four weeks, Americans will begin voting on a field of Democratic Presidential contenders who, by and large, are unknown outside their home states.
The voters will be looking for some quick sense of the men, in the middle of the rocket ride of a late-starting campaign.
They will get it from television commercials and the news media.
The search for the candidates' character -- what these wary, packaged, public men are
really
like -- has begun.


The State of the Art of Travel
IN "Dodsworth," Sinclair Lewis's novel about a retired automobile magnate, Samuel Dodsworth sails to Europe for a Grand Tour and is dazzled by the ship.
It is state of the art, for the late 1920's, with a swimming pool, a wireless room and "ventilators like giant saxophones."
"I love this ship," Dodsworth tells his wife.
"It's so -- Man certainly has put it over Nature for once!"


Tours to Visit Dutch Floriade
Several European tour packages this year include a visit to the Netherlands and the world's largest horticultural exhibition, Floriade, which is held every 10 years.
Hundreds of acres of flowers, plants, trees, bulbs, fruits and vegetables will be on display outdoors and in pavilions at the exhibition site at Zoetermeer, near The Hague, and a 45-minute drive from Amsterdam, from April 10 until Oct. 11.
Floriade '92 will have exhibits from 20 countries, including the United States, competing for 3,000 prizes.
The Dutch expect about three million visitors.

Good News For Snackers And Venture
The announcement this month that Eagle Snacks Inc. has begun selling Cape Cod potato chips made with a canola oil low in saturated fats was good news for Richard Laster.
He heads the Intermountain Canola Company of Cinnaminson, N.J., a joint venture of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company and the DNA Plant Technology Corporation, a biotechnology concern that is also led by the 68-year-old Mr.
Laster.
The company has been long on promising projects and short on commercial success.

She graduated from Central Connecticut State University, as did her fiance.
Her father is a plant maintenance manager for Textron Lycoming, a gas turbine engine manufacturer in Stratford.


NOW Reasserts Its Role as Outsider
The National Organization for Women celebrated its 25th anniversary here this weekend by embracing its status as a militant outsider in politics at home while reaching out to other countries in an attempt to create a movement of "global feminism."
Harking back to her days as an airline stewardess, NOW's new president, Patricia Ireland, told the group's plenary session on Friday that her job usually consisted of "walking up and down aisles, taking people's garbage, and saying 'thank you, thank you.' " For too long, she added, "women in Washington and other capitals of the world have been taking other people's garbage and saying 'thank you.' "


Miss Otruba to Wed

Mr.
Gleason is an associate with Reed, Smith, Shaw &amp; McClay.
He graduated cum laude from Hobart College and has a law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law .
He is a son of George and Gloria Gleason of Boonton, N.J.


LOST KEYS
Philip Caputo's article "Lost Keys" (Dec. 15) moved me.
He isn't the first to lament the tragic and unnecessary decline of the Florida Keys.
Before the current plague of condos and shopping centers, Jimmy Buffet sang of earlier woes in his song "Migration": "Now those mobile homes are smothering my Keys. . . ."
I first visited the Keys in the 70's, and often thereafter, as a college student in Miami.
I guess I just caught the tail end of what the Keys used to be, but I saw enough to know how special it was.
I, too, remember driving on Looe Key and seeing rays, octopuses, nurse sharks and a multitude of colorful fish.
Judging from Caputo's article, I dread the thought of what I would see today.


The First Hints That Spring Will Return
THE catalogues are starting to arrive.
The days are getting longer.
These two signs always gladden an impatient gardener's heart.
They are positive hints that spring will indeed get here.
Nursery and seed catalogues are fine winter reading.
They are written in such glowing terms and illustrated with such enticing pictures, it is tempting to select one of everything.
Before long the wish list fills the order page and then some.
When the seed packets and plants arrive, gardeners wonder where everything will go.


Technology; Experimenting With an Unbreachable Electronic Cipher
In the next phase of the Information Age, when business and scientific documents, photographic images and personal correspondence are all stored in computers as strings of 1's and 0's, digital forgery may become a significant threat.
Because of that threat, a number of techniques are being developed by cryptographers trying to make it impossible to forge computer-based documents.
For example, engineers are close to insuring that scientific laboratory data or digitized photographs can be stored in tamperproof form.
Some researchers have even begun to discuss the possibility of digital money and computer networks that automatically protect privacy.


Almodovar, Adrift In Sexism
In the annals of mother-daughter reunions, this one should hold a special place.
Becky Del Paramo, a onetime pop star, returns to Spain after 15 years abroad.
She hasn't seen her daughter, Rebecca, since the girl was 12, but recently Rebecca has found a mother substitute.
She stands before a poster depicting a female impersonator named Lethal, whose act is modeled on Becky at the height of her sequined and miniskirted fame.
"Whenever I missed you," the grown daughter tells her mother with evident affection, "I'd go see his show." Other film makers would have given Rebecca a stepmother or puppy or at least a Barbie doll; only Pedro Almodovar would have concocted this hilarious, unsentimental surrogate parent.
Mr.
Almodovar sustains his wry irreverence until the strained, mawkish end of "High Heels." As the story begins, Rebecca has married one of her mother's former lovers, and when the husband is murdered both women are suspects.
"High Heels" is very much an Almodovar blend: a murder mystery about mother-daughter competition and sexual ambiguity, laced with scathing touches of pop-culture insanity.


Elkington In Lead
The players at the top of the leader board after today's third round of the Infiniti Tournament of Champions might be less than famous, but by virtue of even being in the season opener, they know how to win.
Heading the unheralded, but highly respectable, list is Steve Elkington, who shot a bogey-less 67 today for a 54-hole total of nine-under par 207.
It gave the Australian-born Elkington a two-stroke lead over a trio of first-timers to the tournament -- Billy Andrade, Brad Faxon and Rocco Mediate.


It's Not Just Some Cars, It's the Future
NOBORU HATAKEYAMA, Japan's vice minister for international trade and industry, emerged from the bruising negotiations over auto imports that dominated President Bush's visit last week in an uncharacteristically reflective mood.
Now that the President had finally followed Japan's example and put economics at the top of his international agenda, Mr.
Hatakeyama admitted to a certain ambivalence.
A United States focused on competing economically with Japan as vigorously as it once waged the cold war is not a prospect the Japanese relish.
On the other hand, a weak United States could be just as troublesome.
And what ails America, Mr.
Hatakeyama said, is not too few Jeep Cherokees in Japanese showrooms or even the recession, but America's industrial future.


Big Shelters Hold Terrors for the Mentally Ill
New York City's huge shelters for men are intimidating places for the homeless generally, but they can be truly terrifying for the mentally ill.
After the lights go down at night at the Fort Washington Armory in upper Manhattan, paranoid schizophrenics lie nervously next to ex-convicts they rightfully fear.


Miss Spindell To Wed in June
Dr. and Mrs.
Lloyd Spindell of Livingston, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Stephanie Spindell to Dr.
Ira Jay Bleiweiss, the son of Rita Bleiweiss of Brooklyn and the late Paul Bleiweiss.
A June wedding is planned.
Miss Spindell, 33 years old, is a vice president of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company in New York.
She graduated from Connecticut College and received an M.B.A. degree from New York University.
Her father is on the staff of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center and is a clinical associate professor of radiology at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.


POSTINGS: Tax Challenge; 421-a Benefits in Condos
Any day now, New York City homeowners will be getting their tax bills for 1992, but there is a new complication this year for condominium owners.
A Manhattan condo's successful court challenge to the way the city figures taxes on buildings getting Section 421-a tax benefits may spur tax-bill protests by other owners.
In the suit on behalf of 51 owners in the condominium at 108 Fifth Avenue, at 16th Street, lawyers held that residents were overcharged about 10 percent because the Department of Finance misapplied the formula for taxing 421-a properties.
Last month, Justice Stanley Parness of State Supreme Court found for the condominium owners.
"The ruling does not extend to other 421-a properties," said Jay Gordon Seiden, a partner in Seiden, Stempel, Bennett &amp; D'Agostino, the firm that brought the suit.
"But there will be future challenges to Finance's methods. Owners of 421-a units need to protect their interests by protesting their bills."


Environmentally Sensitive Construction
IN the SoHo section of Manhattan, the floor of a recently renovated loft is coated with juniper-berry juice, rosemary and beeswax rather than the usual gloss of polyurethane.
In West Redding, Conn., the doors and beams of a new home will come not from standard cut timber but from trees that are nonthreatened species or were felled naturally by a hurricane.


The Doctor Won't See You Now
In the confusion, hypocrisy and animosity generated by the AIDS epidemic, finally we hear a voice of
sanity
-- and from the medical profession at that.
Thirty percent of doctors surveyed by the American Medical Association in November said they felt no ethical responsibility to treat AIDS patients.
And why should they?
For too long, this country has faced rising medical costs and malpractice mania caused in large part by the mistaken notion that doctors are supposed to treat any slob who comes to them.
This involves dealing with old people who are on the way out anyway, with all sorts of nasty sores and tumors, and now with AIDS patients, most of whom got sick because of some sort of disgusting behavior.
Except, of course, hemophiliacs, the
good
AIDS patients.


Streetscapes: The Office of the Astor Estate; A 'Frankly Modern' Addition
ONCE the administrative center for the greatest of New York's family fortunes, the jewel-like, two-story Office of the Astor Estate at 21 West 26th Street is not a landmark and is ignored by guidebooks and New York histories.
Miraculously, the exterior of the Victorian Gothic building has survived unchanged since 1881 -- but now construction is proceeding on a "frankly modern" rooftop addition.


Booking With a Computer
THESE days, a journey of a thousand miles can begin with a single tap of the computer keyboard.
The best way to get somewhere, some travelers assert, is through the personal computer.
Using a computer and a modem, which allows two computers to exchange data over telephone lines, travelers can scan flight schedules and fares, check the weather at the destination, research restaurant reviews, uncover unadvertised bargains and in general tap into the knowledge of most of the world's travel providers and many veteran travelers.


Brenda Bocina to Wed T. J. Curnin
Mr. and Mrs.
Casper Bocina of Short Hills, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Brenda Ann Bocina, to Thomas Johnson Curnin, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Curnin of Larchmont, N.Y.
An April wedding is planned.
Ms.
Bocina is the president of Rustic Ridge Financial Planning Inc., a financial consulting firm in Rockaway Township, N.J.
She graduated from Gettysburg College and has an M.B.A. from Duke University.
Her father is a real-estate developer in Short Hills.

A Chief Undone by Freeing Algeria's Politics
The Algerian President, Chadli Benjedid, who resigned unexpectedly tonight, dismantled almost three decades of one-party rule and pledged to lead his nation toward democracy, but he has now been swept away by the results of his political liberalization.
He stepped down in a dramatic television appearance just 17 days after his party, the National Liberation Front, suffered a humiliating electoral defeat and only four days before the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front seemed poised to win an overwhelming parliamentary majority in a second-round vote.


Bidding in the Dark Amid the Free Agent Market
Mike Gallego's defection to the Yankees produced an unusually severe reaction in the Oakland Athletics' organization and raised an interesting question of ethics and business practices for general managers and agents: Should a free agent's former club be entitled to know what other clubs the player is dealing with and what offers those clubs have made?
This has nothing to do with collusion, that illegal practice the owners clumsily but effectively engaged in for three years as they hindered the movement and bargaining power of free agents.
This is a matter of what courtesy, if any, a player and his agent owe an organization that has nurtured the player and brought him to the point where he can earn millions.


New Bias Attacks Occur; Bronx Girl Faces Charges
Investigators in the Bronx and Brooklyn continued searching for suspects in a spate of bias attacks among youths, incidents that neighbors of two of the latest victims attribute to tensions churned up by last week's paint attack on two black children.
Each of the attacks, including two on Friday and one yesterday morning, has provoked anger and frustration among residents of the communities involved.
Each has raised questions of whether the attacks are related -- actually or symbolically.


CAMPUS LIFE: California, Santa Cruz; Redwood Haven Inspires Battle Over an Elfland
Students past and present call it Elfland, a wooded refuge on the University of California, Santa Cruz campus that is revered as a sanctuary and spiritual haven.
Since the 1960's, students have erected totems, altars and "fairy rings" -- circles of branches -- among the towering redwoods.
In one small altar, a hand-lettered scroll reads: "Lord of the gnomes and earth elements, let your kingdom of little people surround this area, forming a cordon to protect and defend it from interlopers, developers, realtors, construction, vandalism, ruin and assassination."


No Immunity for Coffin Nails
The Supreme Court is having trouble deciding whether Congress, when it required health warnings on cigarette packs, excused the tobacco companies from all civil liability based on state law.
While Congress undoubtedly has that power under the Constitution's Federal supremacy clause, the Court should have no difficulty ruling against the tobacco companies in this case.
The Court has been vigilant of late about states' rights, never lightly assuming that any given Federal law has in fact displaced the laws of 50 states.
The Court heard arguments in the case, Cipollone v.
Liggett Group, in October but with only eight justices; it soon called for a reargument, which is scheduled for tomorrow.
The assumption based on past experience is that the newest Justice, Clarence Thomas, is needed to help break a 4-to-4 deadlock.

Would You Buy a Used Car From This Family
THE TAX INSPECTOR
By Peter Carey. 279 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $21.


Nynex and Its Customers
To the Editor:
While "The Local Call Goes Up for Grabs" (Dec. 29) illustrated the intense competition for large business customers in Manhattan, a comment from an officer of the Teleport Communications Group seemed to question Nynex's commitment to serving its local customers elsewhere, namely in Brooklyn and Queens.


Public &amp; Private; The Stomach Thing
Historians will analyze for years to come the causes and effects of the President's recent intestinal flu, or what Mr.
Bush has begun to call "the stomach thing." Some have blamed fatigue, others jet lag, and a few have even posited that Mr.
Bush intentionally fell ill to win sympathy from the Japanese, a kind of Bush-bugged-himself scenario that, if true, failed.
Americans considering protectionism, free trade and sushi watched the President keel over on the dais and shouted, "Lose the sea urchin, George." They were unaware that the Japanese had feted the President with the sort of country club cuisine that reached its zenith during the Administration of Gerald Ford: to wit, cold salmon, clear soup and the ubiquitous medallions of beef -- a dinner as much like a traditional Japanese banquet as cars made in Detroit are like what American consumers want to buy.


Quick, Henry, the Fix
QUICK FIX STILL LIKELY to tempt Bush, Congress," headlined The Washington Times, despite the advice of sobersided pundits that went, "Don't just do something, stand there."
Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of Bear, Stearns &amp; Company, argued that "the wrong tax cut is a temporary quick fix that puts money into people's pockets."


Gabrielle Ballin Is Wed on L.I.
Gabrielle Janow Ballin, an assistant vice president for Chemical Bank, and Dean Stewart Benjamin, a lawyer, both in New York, were married last evening at the Harrison House in Glen Cove, L.I.

Yugoslav Army Chief Pledges Support for U.N. Plan
Yugoslavia's new acting Defense Minister pledged the Serbian-led army's continued support today for the Unlited Nations peace plan to halt the Yugoslav civil war.
Gen.
Blagoje Adzic, the Yugoslav Army chief of staff and regarded as a hard-liner among the army's top commanders, denied reports that the resignation of Gen.
Veljko Kadijevic as Defense Minister signaled an end to the Sebian-led army's support for the United Nations plan.

She graduated from Dickinson College.
Her father is the manager of treasury operations at the Xerox Corporation in Stamford, Conn.


TILL DEBT DO US PART
David Margolick's article "Till Debt Do Us Part" (Dec. 15), on the scandal in the matrimonial bar, is a superficial report on a situation that should be given the most serious attention.
The incestuous relationships of many matrimonial lawyers and judges in the conduct of business translates into conflict-of-interest influence peddling and corruption of the worst order.
The money squandered is often that which should pay for college, food and rent -- blood money squeezed from families made vulnerable by emotional upheaval.
This serious subject deserves in-depth reporting.

Her father was the treasurer of Rockefeller Family &amp; Associates in New York.


TEACHER PROGRAM IS GIVEN A BOOST
For much of its two-and-one-half-year history, Teach for America, a national not-for-profit teacher training and placement organization, has managed to exist by balancing its members' youthful energy and idealism against a shoestring budget.
All the while, the organization searched for some of America's most promising college graduates, many of whom never considered working in education, to teach in some of the least promising corners and crossroads in the country.


Opportune Time For Borrowing
To the Editor:
In his essay "May Russia End the War at the Piano"  [ Dec. 8 ] , Bernard Holland discussed the dismantling the awesome machinery of the Soviet school of pianism.
He observed that the Soviet system has produced a significant number of virtuoso pianists with not much to say musically and with a certain cultural limitation, as well as a limited repertory, which created a stereotyped image of the "virtuoso Soviet pianist." It is true that a totalitarian political and social system has often had a peculiar way of affecting the product of such professional schools.


Mutual Funds; Goodbye to the 'Cold Call'
One thing that is difficult about being a stockbroker is that income is prone to fluctuate as stock market activity waxes and wanes.
But for brokers who sell mutual funds, this volatility is being tempered somewhat by the increased use of "trail commissions" created by 12b-1 plans, which permit funds to use a fixed percentage of their assets each year to pay certain marketing expenses, and "wrap accounts," in which one annual fee covers all investment expenses.


An Ethnic Road to Riches: The Immigrant Job Specialty
When Parmjit Singh left his job as a mechanic on a Greek ship in 1981, he settled in New York City, instead of returning to the family farm in India.
After working three years as a busboy and cook in a Greek restaurant, Mr.
Singh met a fellow Punjabi who owned a gas station in the city.
"He taught me how to run a station," the 32-year-old Indian recalled.
"It's very hard work but it's easy to run -- to order gas, to clean, to keep the books."

Her father is the president of the Harry Levitz Company in Rockville Centre, L.I., the home-furnishings chain.


Art and a 50th Birthday
TUESDAY -- The Robert Miller Gallery on East 57th Street gave a reception for three of its artists, Robert Graham, a sculptor, and David McDermott and Peter McGough, photographers.
At the preview Mr.
Graham's admirers included Anjelica Huston and Lauren Bacall.
In an adjoining gallery, Mr.
McDermott and Mr.
McGough, devotees of Victorian style, showed 39 of their new prints.
The pair drew a large, colorfully dressed group who reflect the downtown art scene.
WEDNESDAY -- Thomas J. Hubbard, a lawyer and the new chairman of the New York Botanical Garden, was introduced to 400 guests and members of the garden by Enid A. Haupt and the garden's senior vice chairwoman, Beth B. Straus, at a cocktail reception at the Knickerbocker Club, a private club on East 62d Street.


North Korea and Cambodia Cited
American travelers are warned by the State Department against signing up for tour groups bound for North Korea without first checking with the United States Treasury Department.
The warning, which points out that financial transactions by Americans in North Korea are restricted by the United States Government, follows the signing last month of a nonaggression pact by North Korea and South Korea.
The agreement, providing for economic exchanges, was the first step toward a full peace treaty since the Korean armistice was signed 38 years ago.
American passports are valid for travel to North Korea, a travel advisory from the department said, but United States regulations prohibit the use of credit and other charges there, even for traveling expenses.
Visitors also need a North Korean visa.
The advisory pointed out that United States companies are prohibited from arranging tours to North Korea unless specifically licensed by the Treasury for groups involved in academic, sports, cultural or family reunions.


One Building That Knows What It's About
Henry James wrote eloquently about New York, but he missed the point of its architecture.
On a 1904 visit, the novelist railed against the city's first skyscrapers; it pained him to see "those monsters of the mere market" towering over the spire of Trinity Church.
Why didn't he recognize that the skyscraper, too, elevates spirit over matter?
A prolific writer, James was no stranger to the work ethic.
Skyscrapers are the work esthetic, monuments to work as the moral victory of energy over inertia.
The new 23-story office building at 101 Avenue of the Americas, designed by Bruce Fowle of the New York firm Fox &amp; Fowle, doesn't stretch the art of architecture to giddy new heights.
But it is a finely wrought homage to a heroic age in the history of the New York work place.
Designed as a headquarters for Local 32B-32J, the union of building services employees, 101 Avenue of the Americas is notable for the remarkable context to which it pays its respects.


FROM VICE TO NICE
We were delighted to see an article on Las Vegas that talks about the other side of that very glamorous, and as Trip Gabriel discovered, very "nice" city (From "Vice to Nice," Dec. 1).
While we're not displeased with the Las Vegas that people often characterize as "the entertainment capital of the world," we are especially proud of the Las Vegas that is populated by hard-working, family-oriented citizens.


Red Wings' Talent Runs Wild
Some teams worry about not having enough talent, but the Detroit Red Wings were concerned about having too much.
Going into last night's home game against the Edmonton Oilers, they led the National Hockey League in overall winning percentage.


If Russians Now Elect Their President, Why Can't Americans?
To the Editor:
Gerard J. Fitzpatrick, advocating retention of the Electoral College (letter, Dec. 25), in response to a Tom Wicker column, has his facts right, but his conclusions wrong.


Will Russia Find Lessons In Poland's Shock Therapy?
TO appreciate the magnitude of the task facing economic reformers in Russia, consider Poland.
The Poles began their version of economic shock therapy two years ago with a number of things working for them: private farms, an adequate harvest, a decade of initial experimentation within the Communist system, a semi-functioning system for food distribution, prosperous emigres eager to send dollars home, and a $1 billion fund provided by Western governments to prop up a currency that could for the first time be exchanged for dollars.


Toulouse-Lautrec, Stripped of the Cliches
His is one of the most familiar biographies in the history of art.
He was born in 1864 into an aristocratic family that could trace its ancestry to the Crusades and whose tendency to intermarry probably caused the congenital disease that turned him into a dwarfish, misshapen figure.
From his father, who enjoyed lunching in a tutu and having himself photographed in exotic costumes, he may also have inherited a taste for the bizarre, theatrical and socially marginal.
The alcoholism and other illnesses that hastened his death at the age of 36 were byproducts of a career spent largely among the prostitutes, nightclub performers and hangers-on in the seamier quarters of Belle Epoque Paris.
No wonder the life of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec became fodder for Hollywood.
The name of the artist still summons memories of "Moulin Rouge," John Huston's overblown 1952 movie with Jose Ferrer as the lustful Lautrec opposite Zsa Zsa Gabor.
That film, combined with the enduring appeal of the sardonic posters Lautrec designed to advertise the cabarets of Montmartre and the Champs-Elysees, has helped to insure for the artist a level of fame demonstrated at the Hayward Gallery here by the more than 20,000 visitors who stream each week through the latest retrospective of his work.
The show, which runs through next Sunday before traveling to Paris, is the largest presentation of Lautrec's art since the 1964 exhibition in Paris celebrating the centenary of his birth.

Contract for Worrell
The Cardinals, avoiding arbitration, came to terms with its ailing reliever, TODD WORRELL, on a one-year contract.
Terms were not disclosed, but the 32-year-old Worrell, who has been out with elbow and shoulder problems since September 1989, was paid $660,000 last season. (AP)


By the Way, Whose Money Is It?
ONE reason our economy is in its present condition is provided in Jerry Sterner's play "Other People's Money," at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale.
The play, which won awards Off Broadway and became a recent movie, is a wry examination of the back-room corporate politics leading up to the 73d shareholders' meeting of the New England Wire and Cable Company.
In a sense, it provides the flesh-and-blood excitement behind the profit-and-loss columns of a standard annual report.


Popular Opinion Is the Bottom Line
To the Editor:
In his article "TV Creators Face a New Caution"  [ Dec. 8 ] , Jeff Silverman writes about what is perceived in the television world as the reluctance of advertisers to have their products associated with controversial topics such as abortion, homosexual life styles and teen-age suicides.
This is viewed, he says, as "censorship" based not "on perceptions of morality but almost purely on economics."


Stephen B. Judelson, 'Junk Bond' Pioneer And Trader, Was 56
Stephen B. Judelson, a retired Wall Street executive and a pioneer in the high-yield "junk bond" business, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan.
Mr.
Judelson, who was 56 years old and had a second residence in Quogue, L.I., died of cancer, his family said.


Wall Street; A Very Bad Year for the Dividend Dependent
Some people buy stocks in the hope that prices will go up.
For those people, 1991 was a terrific year.
But other people buy stocks in the hope that they will collect ever-increasing dividends.
And for that crowd, 1991 was simply horrible.
According to Standard &amp; Poor's Outlook newsletter, only 1,086 companies increased dividends last year, the lowest number in 20 years.
What is worse, 437 companies either reduced or eliminated dividend payments last year, the highest number in nine years.


Wagner, Nazis and the Israeli Soul
Symbols are where you find them.
As a benign example, Kurt Masur, a German, led the Israel Philharmonic last week in a recording of "Elijah," by the Jewish-born composer Felix Mendelssohn, whose works were banned for a time in Nazi Germany.
Meanwhile, controversy continued to rage in Israel as to whether Richard Wagner, whose music was appropriated by the Nazis, should be restored to the Philharmonic repertory.
The orchestra has not given a scheduled performance of Wagner's music since 1938, when, as the Palestine Symphony, it played a Wagner program under Arturo Toscanini.
What sparked the latest fracas -- the most heated since Zubin Mehta added a Wagner encore to a Philharmonic program a decade ago -- was the announced intention of the conductor Daniel Barenboim to present a Wagner concert with the orchestra late last month.
After protests from some of the country's 300,000 concentration-camp survivors and others, the concert was postponed to allow for a poll of the Philharmonic's subscribers.
The concert is not now scheduled, and many observers believe that no such event will ever take place, at least until the last Holocaust survivors have passed.


On the Road With Oldsmobile's Tourer
I REMEMBER, once, trying to rent a summer place in Nantasket, Mass.
This was in the mid-60's, and the prospective landlord was a nasty guy.
But I wanted the place, and my family was counting on me, no matter that this grouch thought us too inferior to spend a week in his rental house.
He didn't like my name.
Didn't like that I had two little kids.
But, most of all, I remember that in the middle of my stammering interview, he asked imperiously what kind of car I drove "over the road." It was a test.


Salads in Wintertime Require Freshness, and Some Ingenuity
IN cold weather, salad making calls for some creative thinking on the part of the cook.
Tender lettuces are usually expensive and may not be in the best condition, having suffered damage from frost on the way to market.
Other classic salad ingredients, like tomatoes, are typically inedible.
Decent off-season ones are costly -- as much as $3 a pound -- and even at that price may not have the flavor of summer's crop.
Similarly, small, heavily waxed and often frost-bitten cucumbers may not be worth the money.


Style Makers; Brenda Lynn, Milliner
With two hat collections to her credit and two more in progress, Brenda Lynn, 24 years old, probably ranks as one of the most prolific young milliners around.
Ms.
Lynn ventured into the field after a stint designing budget outerwear.
Hats appealed to her, she said, because she believes the back-to-hat movement is still so young that it needs visionaries.
"Some people still think there's such a thing as a head that can't wear hats," Ms.
Lynn said.
"But something can always be done."


The Car: Now You See It, Now You Don't
TO law-enforcement officials and insurance companies, the scenarios are all too familiar.
The car was left running while its driver ran into a store to pick up a package.
The car was parked overnight on the street with an activated alarm system; or it was in a parking lot or a public garage.
But it was not there when the driver returned.


Bronx Man Charged With Killing Child Over TV
A Bronx man who threw an 18-month-old girl head first into a wall when she blocked his view by crawling in front of his television was charged yesterday with killing her, the police said.
The girl, Adriana Rodriguez, died Friday night at Montefiore Medical Center.
A spokesman for Montefiore, Fred Yeager, said she had suffered a fractured skull and severe brain damage.


A New U.S. Problem: Freely Elected Tyrants
NORMALLY, Washington gets rather exercised about the toppling of freely elected presidents.
But when the freely elected, yet brutish, Government of President Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia was ousted by rebels in the former Soviet republic of Georgia last week, the Bush Administration was silent.
It did not know quite what to say, so it said nothing.
It will soon have to get its script together, though, because the case of Georgia is no anomaly.
It is at the core of the next major debate on American foreign policy.
In the post-cold war era, Washington is going to have to wrestle with the complexities of a world governed increasingly by its own values, or at least imitations of its own values.
In such a world, America will increasingly have to acknowledge that elected tyrants -- like Mr.
Gamsakhurdia -- are scarcely better than unelected ones, and it will have to choose its allies not by choosing between dictators and democrats, or between friends and foes in a cold war, but between so-called democrats and genuine democrats.


Echoes of Debate


Abroad at Home; 'On His Word Alone'
"The Constitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrates, that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has accordingly, with studied care, vested the question of war in the legislature." -- James Madison
A year ago this week the United States went to war against Iraq.
How much the war achieved, at how great a price in human devastation, remains a matter of debate.
But one thing is not in doubt.
The way we went to war marked a new high in the unilateral power of the President of the United States.


Booking With a Computer
THESE days, a journey of a thousand miles can begin with a single tap of the computer keyboard.
The best way to get somewhere, some travelers assert, is through the personal computer.
Using a computer and a modem, which allows two computers to exchange data over telephone lines, travelers can scan flight schedules and fares, check the weather at the destination, research restaurant reviews, uncover unadvertised bargains and in general tap into the knowledge of most of the world's travel providers and many veteran travelers.


Mining Unhappiness in a Changed New Hampshire
Facing their first primary election in a state that is home to some of the nation's most economically alienated voters, this year's candidates for President have begun a battle to define themselves that could set the course of the 1992 election.
For the Democrats as well as the Republicans campaigning in New Hampshire, it is no longer enough to politely introduce themselves to voters at house parties and coffee shops.
The compressed campaign season leading to the Feb. 18 primary, coupled with a recession that has tripled the number of unemployed New Hampshire residents since 1988, has forced a different approach this year.


That Fish Was How Big?
To the Sports Editor:
In "Believe It: Fishermen Lie, Lie, Lie" (The Times, Jan. 4), Peter Bodo perpetuates the myth that fishermen are inveterate liars.
He should have remembered the adage that runs "Fishermen are not liars; they merely have a distorted recollection of what probably began as the truth." CLIFFORD P. ALBERTSON Suffern, N.Y.


Miss Kennedy to Wed J.B. Duke 2d
Joan Friedman Martin of Virginia Beach, Va., and Jackson W. T. Kennedy of Toms River, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Elizabeth Jackson Kennedy to James Buchanan Duke 2d, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
James B. Duke of Durham, N.C.
A May wedding is planned.
Miss Kennedy, 26 years old, graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania, and is pursuing an M.B.A. from Harvard University.
Her father is a project manager for Coastal Group, a real-estate developer in Colts Neck, N.J.
Her mother is a partner in the law firm of Williams Kelly &amp; Greer in Norfolk, Va.


Responding to Academic Achievers as School Budgets Tighten
IN a classroom decorated with children's self-portraits and essays -- along with globes, games and boxes labeled with different mathematical processes -- about a dozen third graders are intently engaged in proofreading logic puzzles before binding them into books.
All is conducted under the watchful eye of their teacher, Judi Sternberg.
If it is difficult to determine exactly where these activities fit into a third-grade curriculum, that is because these students are not in an ordinary classroom.
They are participating in Highview Elementary School's High and Wide program, one of the Greenburgh Central 7 District's answers to the special needs of academically able students in grades two through six.


Kelley Reagan To Wed in April
Mr. and Mrs.
Ogden Mills Phipps of Old Westbury, L.I., have announced the engagement of her daughter Kelley Reagan to William Stamps Farish Jr., the son of Mr. and Mrs.
William S. Farish of Versailles, Ky.
An April wedding is planned.
Miss Reagan, 24 years old, graduated from Rollins College and is a research associate at the American Horse Council in Washington.
She is a daughter of the late Joseph A. Reagan.

FASHION
LIKE THEM OR LEAVE them.
That's the attitude most women have already taken about the longer skirts that have resurfaced as bona fide spring style.
But any woman with fashion acumen owes it to herself to try one on.
If she hates it, she can be happy that the prevailing length remains just above the knee.
On the other hand, just one outfit in this new longer length might add a provocative element to an existing wardrobe.


Quotation of the Day
"Now we feel very sorry for him. He's got so much pressure on his shoulders because of these economic problems. But my question is: why don't the American people work harder and try to fit what they do into what other countries want to see?" -- KEIKO SHIMIZU, a teacher browsing an automobile showroom in Tokyo, on President Bush.  [ 6:5. ]


Downtown Cabaret's 'One and Only'
NOTE to the management of the Downtown Cabaret Theater in Bridgeport: To close "My One and Only" just six days before Valentine's Day is to miss the point.
The "new Gershwin musical," as it was advertised for the 1983 Broadway production, is dizzily romantic.
It is also airborne and bubbly, as befits a story about an ace flyer (Capt. Billy Buck Chandler) who falls in love with an aquatic star (Edythe Herbert).

Big Hopes for a Billion-Dollar Building
On Tuesday, the first Jeep Grand Cherokee utility vehicle will roll off the line at the Chrysler Corporation's new $1 billion Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit.
From that moment on, Dennis K. Pawley, Chrysler's executive vice president of manufacturing, and the workers under his command will be feeling the heat to build as many Grand Cherokees as possible as quickly as possible.
About 2,100 hourly employees will be working at the plant when it reaches full production later in the year.

WHEN she learned that the winner of a contest for the most outlandish stunt involving the Bills would receive two tickets to today's American Conference championship game, Marie Brandt never hesitated.
She promised to sleep with a buffalo.
In a barn at the Fort Rickey game farm near Utica, this 36-year-old mother of three, wearing her Bills sweat pants and other warm layers, snuggled into a sleeping bag Thursday evening next to the pen of an 800-pound buffalo named Bill.
She emerged Friday morning with her picture on the front page of The Utica Observer-Dispatch and two tickets.

Russia and Ukraine Try to Settle Military Dispute
Russian and Ukrainian delegations, meeting today in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, moved to defuse a tense standoff between the two former Soviet republics over the status of the Black Sea fleet.
They pledged to avoid taking further unilateral steps.
The two sides issued a joint statement tonight that provided a framework for negotiations by experts later this month.
These specialists will discuss dividing the fleet into strategic and conventional components.


No Rush on Germany in Security Council; The Soviet Seat
To the Editor:
"Russia Deserves the Soviet Seat" by Richard N. Gardner and Toby Trister Gati (Op-Ed, Dec. 19) sublimely expresses the opinion that Russia was the Soviet Union.
Why should Russia gain the seat on the Security Council held by the Soviet Union, if the Soviet Constitution said all the republics were equal?


Grand Jury Won't Indict Officers
A Brooklyn grand jury has voted not to indict the plainclothes police officers involved in the killing of a restaurant owner but recommended an overhaul of their anti-crime unit.
The report, released Thursday, called the training of officers for the anti-crime units "grossly inadequate." It said that the police typically received no formal training for plainclothes duty and that their superiors measured their success largely by the number of arrests that they made.


To Repair Door Locks, Try Replacing the Cylinder
PROBLEMS with door locks do not always mean that the entire knob and latch assembly has to be removed or replaced.
Often just removing the lock cylinder, the part containing the keyhole, is necessary.
The cylinder can be taken to a locksmith for repair, replacement or changing the key.
Removing and reinstalling the cylinders of most locks, usually an easy job, require just a few ordinary tools.
But if a cylinder cannot be removed with such tools, the job will require a licensed locksmith.


Mutual Funds; An Old-Timer Suddenly a Star
William M. B. Berger, a Denver money manager with a superb five-year record, was discovered by investors in 1991, and his biggest fund's assets increased more than tenfold.
What is more, he believes the good times are just beginning for growth stocks.
But Mr.
Berger does not work cheaply, and his year-to-year returns can fluctuate widely.
Mr.
Berger is a confirmed growth investor, who says "the value system really doesn't exist." According to him, "In the long run, earnings is what makes an investment work, not one's cleverness in picking stocks." Growth investors look for companies whose earnings will outpace the average; value investors look for stocks that are cheap relative to a company's probable worth.


Bridge
One would expect bridge to be a popular and beneficial recreation in prisons, and indeed 10 prisons have clubs affiliated with the American Contract Bridge League.
The most famous of them is at Leavenworth, the Federal prison in Kansas, which has had a program for more than 30 years.
Others could probably be developed if local players took the trouble to encourage them.
It is sometimes possible for local players to take part in a prison duplicate, and this has happened in the United States and England when inmates have been allowed to circulate with some freedom.
Those in more restricted situations may be lucky to assemble four players.
Such efforts tend to depend on the enthusiasm of one inmate, and if he departs, the effort may collapse.


POSTINGS: 15 Units in Yonkers; Town Houses for the Homeless
Construction will start next month in Yonkers on a unusual compact town-house rental complex for homeless families that maximizes space to maintain a high degree of separation for its 15 units.
Each unit will have its own outdoor entrance.
There will be no common walls, and the tallest of the houses, which will be built on a slope, will be four stories.
"It is a town-house development turned sideways," said the architect, Duo Dickinson, of Madison, Conn.


Influx of U.S. Aid Before Primary Draws Fire
An influx of Federal aid into New Hampshire in the weeks before the Presidential primary there has provoked the ire of Patrick J. Buchanan, the main Republican challenger to President Bush, and Democrats in nearby states.
In rapid succession last month, Federal and state officials announced three Federal initiatives that would create 400 jobs and pump more than $274 million in financial aid and loan guarantees into New Hampshire.


Review/Television; Fondas Come to Terms With the Past
Dad was a legend.
That made life difficult.
But there were some great moments.
That's more or less the thrust of "Fonda on Fonda," tonight's hourlong documentary on TNT at 8, with a repeat at midnight.
Dad is, of course, Henry Fonda, and although there are other Fondas on hand -- his son, Peter, and his widow, Shirlee -- the one given star billing in the title is his daughter Jane.
She serves as host and, as it happens, is also the new wife of Ted Turner, Mr.
TNT himself.
The producers and writers of "Fonda on Fonda" are Joan Kramer and David Heeley, the team whose credits, singly or together, over the last decade have included such outstanding performer profiles as "Fred Astaire: Puttin' on His Top Hat," "Starring Katharine Hepburn," "Bacall on Bogart" and "The Fred Astaire Songbook." Their shrewd technique is to combine clips of well-known movie scenes with original material in the form of interviews or personal reminiscences and artifacts.
In this instance the comments of Jane Fonda and the others are skillfully combined with family home movies and excerpts from Henry Fonda's letters.


Now Let's Learn Self-Help From the Japanese; Logic and Ethics
To the Editor:
"Taming Japan's Trade Surplus" (Op-Ed, Dec. 28) by C. Fred Bergsten demonstrates what happens when alleged free market proponents confront market forces not to their liking.
Mr.
Bergsten suggested that President Bush should "work out an agreement" in Japan to strengthen the "grossly undervalued" yen and "seek a Japanese commitment to restore domestic expansion."


BUSINESS DIGEST
Companies
Dow Corning scientists urged company officials for years to conduct critical safety studies of its silicone gel breast implants, but the tests were put off for more than a decade, a review of hundreds of company documents shows.
The documents also suggest that the studies that were done were inadequate.  [ Page A1. ]


Trade Proposal Draws A Lukewarm Response
A proposal to pull down world trade barriers has received a lukewarm response from many countries because of its provisions on farm products, forcing negotiators to focus more on opening world markets for other goods, American and European trade officials said today.
In the last three weeks, the European Community, the United States and Japan have all declined to endorse strongly a proposal made on Dec. 20 by Arthur Dunkel, the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
All three trading partners have expressed concerns about exposing their farmers to international competition.


Sports of The Times; Utley's Spirit and Bowl of Chips
At the beginning of the fourth period, with nighttime having fallen on Washington, and the Redskins having very much fallen on the Lions -- it was 27-10 Redskins and they were looming ever larger.
Despite this the team from Detroit raised up its thumbs in a display of optimism, of O.K. guys, let's get 'em, and, something else.
It was, "Hi Mike," a signal to a guy watching the game in Craig Hospital in Denver, watching it, as he had said on Friday, on the big screen and "like everyone else, with chips at my side."
Unlike most others, however, Mike Utley would be lying and watching with a steel halo around his neck and head and he would be paralyzed from the chest down.


Dance in Review
Dendy Dance Joyce Theater
The plague of AIDS has hit dance in a particularly difficult way.
The short career span means that most dancers are very young, and there is an intense physical camaraderie to the work of dance.
So mortality, or even illness, are painful in a special way.
Mark Dendy's ambitious new "Back Back," a world premiere presented by Dendy Dance on Wednesday night in the Joyce Theater's Altogether Different festival, suggests that pain.
But though AIDS calls for a degree of maturity few of us possess, Mr.
Dendy's piece was, to put it most charitably, immature.


Coopers Partners Bristle at Raise
Many chief executives are under fire for collecting large paychecks in the face of poor corporate performance.
Now, partners at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, one of the nation's largest accounting firms, are questioning the size of the pay raises pushed through for its top partners after profits hit a five-year low.
The issue leapt to the fore last month when Coopers's executive committee sought to raise its share of the firm's profits by an average of 9.9 percent.
The increases ranged from the 4.8 percent requested by Vincent M. O'Reilly, a deputy chairman who made $649,350 last year, to the 22.6 percent sought by Eugene M. Freedman, the firm's new chairman.

Critic's Notebook; Why Met's 'Ghosts' Will Be Disembodied Until 1994-95 Season
The success of "The Ghosts of Versailles" must be both gratifying and frustrating for the Metropolitan Opera.
After a quarter-century in which the notion of commissioned work reminded Met administrators of the emblematic failure of Samuel Barber's "Antony and Cleopatra" and the lukewarm reception of Marvin David Levy's "Mourning Becomes Electra," the company overcame its fears and presented a newly commissioned opera.
That meant reconfiguring the production process to contend with the wishes of a living composer and librettist.
But having the authors on hand turned out to be a two-way equation: John Corigliano, the composer, and William M. Hoffman, the librettist, made changes in their text to reflect the wishes of the singers and the production team.
By all accounts, the company found the experience an invigorating reminder that opera can be a living, flexible art.


U.S. COURT BLOCKS I.R.A. EXTRADITION
A Federal appeals court has blocked the extradition of a former member of the Irish Republican Army on the ground that a new treaty with Britain specifically aimed at I.R.A. guerrillas in the United States unlawfully singled him out for punishment.
But the ruling last week by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit may have the unintended effect of putting the former I.R.A. member, Peter McMullen, 44 years old, at greater risk.

Outdoor Memorial Service Becomes Emotional Rally
An outdoor memorial service for the nine victims of the City College stampede turned into a heated rally yesterday, with organizers denouncing college administrators and city officials before rushing the guarded doors of a student center in protest.
The lone bereaved family who attended the memorial service, the parents of 24-year-old Yul Clayton Dargan, did not see the commotion or hear the chants of "Whose school? Our school!" as organizers demanded to be allowed into the North Academic Center on the City College campus.


Corrections
Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 31 about Chinese Government surveillance of foreigners omitted a passage describing what appeared to be official efforts to keep a Chinese dissident from talking to an American reporter.
Telephone service for the dissident, Zhang Wei, was interrupted for six weeks, presumably to prevent the correspondent from reaching him.


Volunteers to Help Ex-Soviet Lands
Richard Garnitz, a 70-year-old former furniture store owner, is considering leaving his two-bedroom apartment overlooking the third fairway in a suburban retirement community to enter a two-year life of uncertainty where he may find himself in long lines just to buy eggs and milk and fretting over a scarcity of fuel to heat his living quarters.
Mr.
Garnitz, a former Commerce Department employee, Foreign Service officer and international trade expert, may join the Peace Corps to become a part of its first group ever to enter and assist what was once the Soviet Union.

Anger Lingers After Leak at Atomic Site
The scare is over, but in the "Prince of Tides" setting of golden coastal marshes, moss-draped live oaks and seaside resort communities, the questions linger after a leak of radioactive water from the Savannah River Site raised new questions about the safety of the nuclear weapons plant there.
At recent public hearings in Beaufort (pronounced BYOO-fort) and on nearby Hilton Head Island, residents demanded a halt to plans to restart the aging reactor that caused the leak about 150 miles from the coast.
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins and other officials said that Federal monitoring and notification procedures should have been better but that there was no risk to public health in the incident


Sports of The Times; Bailey's First Touchdown, Ever
THE man of the moment, Carlton Bailey, the right inside linebacker who had scored the Buffalo Bills' only touchdown in their 10-7 victory over the Denver Broncos, had already stripped down to his white T-shirt as a Bills official, Scott Berchtold, approached him in the locker room.
"Television wants you right now," Berchtold said.

Contradictory Signals Cloud Outlook on Bonds
It has been a wonderful six months for credit market participants, as weak economic data and an increasingly concerned Federal Reserve Board allowed interest rates to move in a predictable downward direction.
The economy remains weak, but some credit market analysts suggest that the buying and selling of fixed-income securities is going to be a bit more complex over the next weeks and months.
Movements in market interest rates will probably become less predictable for a number of reasons, these analysts said.
Chief among these is the still-resonant message sent by the Fed on Dec. 20, when it cut the discount rate by a full point and lowered its target for the overnight Federal funds rate by half a point.


MAKER OF IMPLANTS BALKED AT TESTING, ITS RECORDS SHOW
Scientists within the Dow Corning Corporation urged company officials for years to conduct critical safety studies of its silicone gel breast implants, but the tests were put off for more than a decade, a review of hundreds of company documents shows.
The documents, made available to The New York Times from several sources, also suggest that the studies that had been done were inadequate.
They describe insertion of implants into women before they had been tested in animals, and suggest that Dow Corning Wright breast implants may have been tested in animals but not in animal breast tissue.


Knicks Hit a Slump, but Stay at the Top
During the last three weeks, the Knicks have not played liked a first-place team.
Yet, they have remained in first place in the Atlantic Division.
That fact allowed New York to remain optimistic after its latest lukewarm performance: a 100-96 victory Saturday night over the injury-riddled Boston Celtics.


Lower Rates May Bring Back Perils for Banks and S.&amp; L.'s
The lower interest rates that are benefiting homeowners and other borrowers are a mixed blessing for banks and savings and loan associations and may even be pushing them into a riskier position.
In the short term, the tidal wave of homeowners seeking to take advantage of the lowest lending rates in nearly 20 years by refinancing their mortgages has provided the banks a much-needed increase in income from fees on the new loans.
The lower rates have also widened the spread between the interest rates the banks pay depositors and what they charge borrowers.


Smuggling and Use of Illicit Drugs Are Growing, U.N. Survey Finds
In an annual survey of drug trafficking and abuse around the world, a United Nations agency painted a bleak picture yesterday of expanding drug crops, increased smuggling and greater consumption.
While the International Narcotics Control Board noted that cocaine use appeared to be diminishing in the United States, it described worsening conditions in many countries including those of Eastern Europe, the former republics of the Soviet Union and China.


Race and Crime: Let's Talk Sense
Crime has become -- for conservatives and liberals -- a marker for race.
If America were a racially homogenous country, the crime problem would not be a significant factor in Presidential elections.
For most of this century, crime was not an issue in national elections, and certainly was not the problem for liberals it has since become.
Then came the 1960's, when the growth of violent crime in the cities and active, vigorous civil disobedience by antiwar protesters helped cement the impression that liberals supported the disturbers of the peace.


Reporter's Notebook; The Latest Challenge For Indiana Jones: TV
George Lucas, the film maker responsible for the two most lucrative trilogies in the history of American film -- the "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" movies -- has given his latest project to television, and he calls it "the best work I've done."
"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles," an hourlong ABC series to begin in late February or in early March, surely does not stint on ambition.
The series is Mr.
Lucas's attempt to retell 20th-century history as television entertainment.


Treasury Auction Schedule
This week, the Treasury plans to hold only today's regular auction of three- and six-month bills.
Late Friday, the three-month bills were bid at 3.82 percent and the six-month bills at 3.86.


Dial-a-Hearing for Capitol Watchers
Lobbyists sometimes line the darkened hallways of the Capitol in the early morning hours, hoping for a chance to sit in on a Congressional hearing scheduled to begin hours later.
In the past, if C-Span or the Cable News Network was not broadcasting the hearing, this was their only chance to witness who said what about the subjects that preoccupy their lives.


No Recession for Firearms Industry
Other businesses may feel the gloom of recession.
But at the Shooting, Hunting Outdoor Trade Show, the annual meeting of the firearms manufacturing industry, the glow of prosperity was in the air.
The 1,200 companies that took part in this year's SHOT Show, as those in the gun industry call the four-day gathering, needed 15 percent more space than last year to show their wares, from high-tech rifles and pistols to scopes, decoys and "Bee-A-Tree" camouflage.
Most of the 15,000 manufacturers, gun shop owners and weapons buffs attending the meeting, which ended today, had little to complain about.


Government Service Gets Nasty
When the Comptroller of New York State, Edward V. Regan, announced last week that "there are no philosophical differences or partisan differences" between Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature over the state budget, he drew this snarling response from John E. McArdle, the spokesman for the Senate majority leader and a fellow Republican.
"What is he -- on drugs?"
Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the Connecticut Governor whose high-handed manner almost undermined his crusade to impose the state's first income tax, was asked recently if he had learned any lessons from his heated, ugly fights with the Legislature.
"No," Mr.
Weicker snapped.


Conner and His Merry Band of Sailors
Can the man who lost the America's Cup at the expense of a 100-year winning streak worry anymore about failing?
"No," said DENNIS CONNER, the yachtsman who sailed into a year of oblivion after the 1983 cup loss to Australia.
"I've already survived the worst."


The Line? Ask the Lions
The Detroit Lions should have a good idea of what might happen two weeks from today in Super Bowl XXVI.
They played Washington and Buffalo this season, losing by 45-0 and 41-10 to the Redskins and beating the Bills, 17-14, in overtime.
"Based on today's performance," said Erik Kramer, the Lions' quarterback, "I'd have to say the Redskins. But we played the Bills when they didn't play a lot of their key players. I don't think it's going to be a blowout."


Only the Sports-Minded Need Attend
In one hotel on the same day, sports commissioners, sports agents, sports medicine experts and sports officials will meet, mingle and talk.
It is the annual Sports Summit at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan.
For $595, anyone can attend the two-day session, which starts tomorrow.


Rypien Savors A Special Moment
The spotlight was shining brilliantly on Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien once again, and this time, after playing a superb game and again establishing himself on the same plateau as Buffalo's Jim Kelly as the most accurate deep passers in pro football this season, Rypien was able to smile and accept his place amid the hoopla in his team's locker room.
Rypien, you see, shys away from nearly any and all attention.


Incumbent Leads Bulgaria's Presidential Vote
President Zhelyu Zhelev appeared to be leading in Bulgaria's first direct presidential vote today but short of a majority, projections based on partial returns indicated.
The projections estimated that Mr.
Zhelev received about 45 percent of the vote, followed by Velko Valkanov, a nominally independent candidate backed by the former Communists, with about 31 percent, said the Bulgarian Association for Fair Elections and Civil Rights.
The group is a nongovernmental organization that conducts separate tabulations of vote results.


Miscellany
*
A television station in Manchester, N.H., has turned down a paid commercial in which Act Up, the AIDS advocacy and protest group, was to present a message aimed at the 1992 Presidential candidates..
WMUR-TV had initially agreed to run the 30-second spot, but subsequently rejected it over its "visual content." On screen during the spot was a series of pictures depicting homosexual, lesbian and interracial heterosexual couples kissing.
Larry Gilpin, WMUR's vice president and general manager, said that while the ad's message, which urged the candidates to speak out about AIDS, was acceptable, he deemed its "blatant portrayal of sexuality" to be inappropriate.


Closing L.I. Poison Center Is a Poor Economy
To the Editor:
As a result of elimination of the county subsidy to Nassau County Medical Center (news article, Dec. 24), the Long Island Poison Control Center may cease operations.
Closing the poison control center is not in the public interest and will cost taxpayers millions more than any short term dollars saved.


China Cracks Down Harder on Christian Activities Outside Official Church
Just before church began one recent Sunday, nearly a dozen plainclothes security policemen swarmed around the courtyard, scrutinizing the churchgoers and eavesdropping on conversations.
"Don't create trouble!" an elderly minister whispered sternly to a young religious leader who had held illegal Bible-study sessions in his home.
"They're all around."


Lalibala Journal; In Ethiopia, Islam's Tide Laps at the Rock of Ages
In the cool dawn air of the Ethiopian highlands, hundreds of priests in white and red robes, their heads swathed in turbans, emerged from one of the 11 churches here to sing psalms and give thanks to the medieval king under whose rule the churches, carved from solid rock, were built 800 years ago.
It was Christmas, which in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church is celebrated according to the Julian calendar, and this year's service was the first held in peace for nearly 20 years.


Absolut Ads Salute States
TBWA Advertising Inc. is working Absolut into a state -- all 50 of them, actually, and the District of Columbia, too.
Beginning Friday, the agency's largest single campaign for the imported Swedish vodka, called "Absolut Statehood," will be introduced in USA Today.
Every other week through December 1993, a full-page advertisement, featuring an artist's salute to his or her home state, will appear in the domestic and international editions of that newspaper.
The 51 ads, which will cost more than $3.5 million, will present the states in alphabetical order.

Karen Elise Horowitz, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Siegfried Horowitz of New York, was married yesterday to Seth Lee Starr, the son of Rivoli Starr of Woodmere, L.I., and the late Jack Starr.
Rabbi Michael Strassfeld officiated at Temple B'nai Sholom in Rockville Centre, L.I.
The bride, 32 years old, is the New York district sales manager for the Progress Software Corporation.
She graduated cum laude from Barnard College and received a master's degree in computer science from Columbia University.
Her father is a retired chemical engineer.


2 Weeks After City College Deaths, Many Questions Remain
By 7 P.M., there had already been the Clockwork Orange horror of tired, angry fans shouting "one, two, three, push" and shoving themselves along in a human wave.
The crowd that had been churning for hours on the sidewalk outside a City College gymnasium was heading toward a nightmare.
Before it was over on Dec. 28, nine people were tangled in a fatal crush at the bottom of the gymnasium stairwell, and at least 34 were injured.
What was supposed to have been a charity basketball game pitting teams of rap music stars against one another had turned into a catastrophe.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; Frito-Lay and Fox Attempt To Outflank the Super Bowl
EVERY year during the telecast of the Super Bowl advertisers seek to score more points than both teams put together.
Because it is always the most-watched television event of the year, the game has become a showcase for new advertising campaigns.
Now, even making fun of the Super Bowl has become a marketing opportunity.


Russian Scientists to Detail Plans For a Fast Nuclear Space Rocket
Scientists from Russia say they have made important strides over the decades in perfecting nuclear-propelled rockets, enhancing the prospects for faster space travel, and they plan to detail their achievements this week for the first time.
They will also propose a joint venture with the United States to build, test and use nuclear engines for sending humans to Mars, a feat whose distances and dangers might be beyond the powers of conventional chemical rockets.


Lions Tip Their Helmets to Redskins
The Redskins played so well today that the Detroit Lions acted more like appreciative theatergoers than victims.
Only a few minutes earlier, the Redskins had finished off a 41-10 rout of the Lions that gave the hometown heroes the National Football Conference championship and put them in Super Bowl XXVI against the Buffalo Bills.
But when the Lions' locker room was opened to the news media, heads were high.


Dance in Review
K2 Dance and Arts Company Merce Cunningham Studio
K2 Dance and Arts Company celebrated its 10th anniversary with a mixed-media program on Friday night.
But the media never mixed harmoniously.
Kay Nishikawa, the troupe's choreographer, kept allowing dancers to be consistently overshadowed by other aspects of the productions.


Books of The Times; Dr. Delaware to the Rescue, Again
Private Eyes By Jonathan Kellerman 475 pages. Bantam Books. $21.50.
At the opening of Jonathan Kellerman's latest Alex Delaware novel, "Private Eyes," the child psychologist turned detective receives a phone call from a young heiress named Melissa Dickinson from the exclusive San Labrador section of Los Angeles.
Alex immediately recalls how, a decade earlier, he treated Melissa as a fear-ridden 9-year-old particularly haunted by fantasies of a man named Joel McCloskey, who, for reasons never determined, had thrown the contents of a bottle of acid in her mother's face before Melissa was born.


Now Let's Learn Self-Help From the Japanese
To the Editor:
In "Don't Look for Jobs in Japan" (editorial, Jan. 6), you assert that "the number of employed Americans is unrelated to the size of the trade deficit" and invoke the experience of the 1980's, when full employment accompanied the huge trade deficits.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY A FREE RIDE THAT COSTS A LOT
Fare beating has long plagued the New York City subways, but in the last 18 months it has reached epic dimensions.
Despite stepped-up police efforts, parts of the city have become virtual no-fare zones.
One recent day, 11 people entered the 135th Street station in a 15-minute period.
Two paid the fare.
A1.


Essay; The April Surprise
Last week, approaching the first anniversary of Desert Storm, George Bush again called on the Iraqi people to "take matters into their own hands and get  [ Saddam Hussein ]  out of there . . ."
That caused much wincing among the Kurds and Shiites who rose up in the aftermath of our stop-short victory last winter.


PRO FOOTBALL It's a Date: Redskins and Bills to Meet in Super Bowl; No Huddle. No Offense. No Matter. Buffalo Is In.
The Buffalo Bills had relied upon their high-powered, high-scoring no-huddle offense to light their path to victory most of the season, while the Denver Broncos were accustomed to depending upon the scrambling high jinks of quarterback John Elway for their triumphs.
So when the Broncos' defense threw a blanket over Bills quarterback Jim Kelly and receivers James Lofton and Andre Reed and then shuttered running back Thurman Thomas this afternoon in the American Football Conference championship game here at Rich Stadium, Buffalo's offense was left stumbling in the dark.
And when Elway, who eventually left the game with a thigh bruise, was corralled, the Broncos' offense floundered.


Egyptian Sentenced for Novel Called Blasphemous to Islam
Three years after publishing his newest novel, Alla Hamed has been hounded from his job, forced to move out of his apartment because of death threats, and may soon go to prison, along with his publisher and a book distributor.
A special court, hearing charges that Mr.
Hamed's novel, titled "The Distance in a Man's Mind," is blasphemous to Islam, found it to be "a threat to national unity and social peace" and sentenced the author, publisher and distributor to eight years in prison.


Man Is Shot in the Subway
A 19-year-old suspected fare beater was shot and wounded Saturday night by a Transit Police officer who was arresting him at a subway station in Mott Haven in the Bronx, the police said yesterday.
The shooting occurred about 11:10 P.M. in the Brook Avenue station on the No. 6 line.
The man, Anthony Perez, of 600 East 137th Street in Mott Haven, who the police say was unarmed, was reported in good condition yesterday at Lincoln Hospital.


Why So Slow on Mr. D'Amato?
Senator Alfonse D'Amato was engaging in wishful thinking last August when he wrote three million of his New York constituents that a Senate Ethics Committee investigation had found that he "did nothing wrong."
In fact, the committee left one set of allegations unresolved because of continuing criminal investigations.
Moreover, even the notoriously lenient committee rebuked Senator D'Amato for allowing his brother to use his Senate office to lobby the Pentagon on behalf of a military contractor.


Review/Opera; Handel's 'Radamisto,' With Good Guys and Bad
Before beginning to conduct Handel's "Radamisto" at Mannes College of Music on Friday night, Will Crutchfield introduced this rarely heard 1720 work by summarizing critical evaluations of the composer's operas.
There are dozens of such compositions, which were extraordinary popular successes during the first half of the 18th century.
But none were performed for 175 years, the very years in which our musical culture matured.
So they have been transported to our era without a long tradition of interpretation and without any clear critical consensus about their importance.
One view, Mr.
Crutchfield noted, was that these are insignificant showpieces for vocal canaries; another is that these are dramas so awkwardly and primitively constructed that there is no point in even trying to play them straight.
And finally, there is the view that these are remarkable compositions, worthy of being placed beside the best works of the operatic tradition.


Consumers and Pros Pick Same Commercials as Tops
WHENEVER advertising executives gather to bestow honors on one another's campaigns -- in other words, every week or so -- they always ask this question: What do consumers, at whom those award-winning ads are aimed, think of them?
One awards organization was curious enough to seek an answer.
The New York Festivals, which annually presents awards to international television commercials, has inaugurated a Consumers' Choice Award.
At its initial presentation, at the organization's 34th annual awards banquet in Manhattan on Friday, the winner was a humorous spot for DHL Worldwide Courier, created by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising in Sydney, Australia.


Uncertainty and Recession Prevail at Electronics Show
The future of television, stereos and video games was on view here at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, which concluded on Sunday.
But like the direction of the national economy, the course of the industry seemed sluggish and tentative.
That was due, in part, to uncertainty over the shape and cost of new technologies like high-definition television, mini-disks and digital compact cassettes, and compact diskread only memory, which could drastically change the video-game business.


Dance in Review
New York City Ballet New York State Theater
The New York City Ballet treated itself and its audience to a sumptuous performance of George Balanchine's "Jewels" on Friday night.
There was a welcome air of proud self-celebration on stage, and it was infectious.


3 Would-Be Heroes Fall Just a Bit Short
With only 1 minute 43 seconds left to play in the American Conference championship game here today, there was still time for Denver's David Treadwell, Gary Kubiak and Steve Sewell to walk out of Rich Stadium as heroes.
This was just after Kubiak, in to relieve injured quarterback John Elway, had just fallen backward into the end zone with a 3-yard touchdown and Treadwell, the Broncos' place-kicker, had booted the extra point that cut the Buffalo lead to 10-7.


Looking for the Democratic Vision
NEW York's 1992 Democratic presidential primary campaign formally begins this week with two factors, besides Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, missing.
So far, this year's abbreviated campaign in New York has been dominated by electoral mechanics rather than by ideological jousting.
No gut issue like the war in Vietnam or the vivid symbolism of a vigorous black candidate divides Democrats.
Hungry after 12 years out of the White House, most want to win.


Paris Is Closing Part of Bois
Interior Minister Philippe Marchand announced today that he was closing part of the Bois de Boulogne park to combat prostitution.
"Certain roads in the woods will be closed to traffic at night," he said in a radio interview.
"I have on my desk a map of the Bois de Boulogne, and it is horrifying the number of prostitutes, men and women, who are there -- more than 500. This can no longer be tolerated." Critics say the closing will merely drive the prostitutes elsewhere.


Memorial Service Is Held for the Victims of the City College Stampede


Connecticut's Tax Agency Is Facing Chaos in Its First Collections
In the shabby, overcrowded building that houses Connecticut's Department of Revenue Services, optimism reigns: The 1.6 million blank tax returns that went out last week under the new income tax
will
be filed in timely fashion by April 15, officials insist. Refund checks, they say,
will
be processed just as smartly.
But some ominous portents say otherwise.


An Increase in Stranded Seals Raises Concerns on Pollution
The grayish-green harbor seal, known only as NY-870, lay all but still on a bed of plywood planks, its whiskers askew, its breathing labored, its eyes unfocused, part of a mystery that is confounding marine biologists.
Samuel S. Sadove, the research director of the Okeanos Ocean Research Foundation in Hampton Bays, L.I., wearing a metal mesh glove to protect his right hand, leaned over NY-870 last week, searching for some sign that a regime of antibiotics, vitamins and intravenous feedings over five frantic days had begun to take hold.


Only Ito Can Stop A Sweep
The 1992 United States Olympic figure-skating team strongly resembles the 1988 team in that its strength is the singles skaters and more women than men are likely to win medals.
While it would be unrealistic to expect Kristi Yamaguchi, Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan to occupy the victory stand next month in Albertville, France, as they did last March at the world championships in Munich and the national championships that ended here Saturday night, they await the Winter Games in much the same way that Debi Thomas, Jill Trenary and Caryn Kadavy did the Calgary Olympics four years ago:


McDaniel Has New Strategy
Xavier McDaniel of the Knicks is expected to exercise the $500,000 buyout clause in his contract, which would make him an unrestricted free agent after this season.
McDaniel and his lawyer, David Falk, have both said that the veteran small forward wants to remain with the Knicks, but that exercising the buyout clause by the deadline Wednesday would give McDaniel more leverage in negotiating a contract in the future.


Fare Beating Is Up and So Is Ire of Paying Riders
Two young men dressed in blue jeans and down jackets jog down the steps and head toward the turnstiles at the 135th Street subway station.
No other passengers are on the uptown platform of the quiet station, a local stop on the B and C lines in Harlem.
Without a glance back at the clerk in the token booth, the men open an exit gate and saunter into the subway.
Over the next 15 minutes, nine other people enter the station -- seven of them also going through the gate to avoid paying the fare.
Most are men, some young and some middle-aged.
But there is also a trio of teen-agers, two of them girls, and a well-dressed woman in her 20's.


Emigre and Son Shot to Death in Brooklyn
A 49-year-old Russian emigre, believed to be connected to Russian organized crime, and his 26-year-old son were shot to death in a hallway outside their apartment in Brooklyn early yesterday, the police said.
Each man had a handgun in his possession when he died but apparently never got a chance to use it as they were shot in a hail of more than 20 bullets shortly after 1:30 A.M. in Brighton Beach, said Lieut.
James Luongo, commander of the 60th Precinct Detective Squad.


Pat Buchanan's Small World
Patrick Buchanan's bid for the Republican Presidential nomination has begun shakily.
William F. Buckley, his philosophical hero, has sadly found him to be guilty of anti-Semitism.
His campaign against President Bush is underfinanced.
His quest may not survive the Feb. 18 New Hampshire primary election.
But there is this to be said for Mr.
Buchanan's odd crusade: He is asking some very good questions.
What is America's proper role in the world, post-cold war?
And what should America be doing to improve the lives of its own people?


Ballet Theater to Mexico
American Ballet Theater is to begin a five-day engagement in Mexico City on Jan. 22, the first time in more than 25 years that the company has appeared in that city.
Among the pieces to be performed are "Giselle," "Raymonda," "Swan Lake," "Sinfonietta" and "The Firebird." The company will first perform at the Palace of Fine Arts and then finish its engagement on Jan. 25 and 26 at the Auditorium Theater.


From a Russian Team to Rangers?
Although NEIL SMITH, the Rangers' general manager, is trying hard to play down the delicate diplomatic situation, scuttlebutt out of the recent world junior ice hockey championships in Germany was that first-round pick ALEKSEI KOVALEV could very easily end up with the Rangers before the start of this season's Stanley Cup playoffs.
Kovalev, who was the only player from the victorious Commonwealth of Independent States in the junior tournament named to the all-star team, is currently trying out for the Russian Olympic team.
After the Winter Games in Albertville, France, the fleet forward will complete the Russian league regular season with Dynamo of Moscow.
At that point, in March, he could receive the O.K. to play for a month or two with the Rangers.


For Kansas and Arizona, Home Became Less Sweet
Kentucky once set a record for winning 129 home basketball games in a row.
But that was from 1943-55, and most good teams today play more balanced schedules, as Arizona and Kansas found out Saturday.
Arizona pitted a 71-game home winning streak against U.C.L.A., not having lost at McKale Center in Tucson since 1987, when Texas-El Paso beat the Wildcats.
And in what was one of the most exciting games ever played at McKale, the Bruins defeated Arizona, 89-87, as Darrick Martin hit a 15-footer with one second left.


Bridge
When players desperately need swings, because a strong stretch drive is needed to snatch a victory, they pray to the gods of the game for wild distribution.
The gods are rarely listening, but they were on the diagramed deal from the Tri-State Regional Open Swiss Teams played on Thursday in Port Chester, N.Y.
Those praying were Roy Welland, Christal Henner, Uday Ivatury and David Feldman, and the gods gave South an 8-5-0-0 hand.
This occurs once in 33,000 deals and produces situations in which science gives way to guesswork.
It is nearly always right to select the eight-card suit as trump, to avoid losing control, but that was not true here.


Bill Paying Is Delayed By Macy's
R.
H.
Macy &amp; Company, which has been sorting through the aftermath of a disappointing holiday season, has told its suppliers that it will be late making its January payments, sending a shudder of concern through the retailing community and again calling into question the ability of the department store company to navigate through the difficult retailing climate.
In explaining the delay, Macy cited restrictions in agreements with several banks that require it to reduce its borrowing for a 30-day period ending Jan. 25.
The company said it would resume regular payments after that.


Stephen B. Judelson; 'Junk Bond' Pioneer And Trader Was 56
Stephen B. Judelson, a retired Wall Street executive and a pioneer in the high-yield "junk bond" business, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan.
Mr.
Judelson, who was 56 years old and had a second residence in Quogue, L.I., died of cancer, his family said.


For Detroit, Time to Buckle Down
With token concessions and little relief from President Bush's mission to Japan, the nation's auto industry enters a new and critical phase in which it must seek its own strategies to keep from being overwhelmed by competitors and a floundering economy.
The negotiations last week over America's access to the Japanese automotive market were mostly a sideshow to the American auto industry's overriding concern: how to fix its operations in this country, which are steadily losing ground to Japanese competition.
To make matters worse, the industry also suffered a public relations black eye last week as it was cast as a supplicant seeking help from the Japanese Government to sell its wares, an image that could repel even more customers.


New Machines by Hewlett
Striking a blow at the dominance of Sun Microsystems Inc., the Hewlett-Packard Company will announce two new work stations on Monday that offer significantly higher performance at lower prices.
Hewlett-Packard said its new model 705, priced at $4,990, outperformed even much higher-priced machines from Sun or the Digital Equipment Corporation, and had twice the performance of Sun's comparably priced model.


Quotation of the Day
"Fare beating is the graffiti of the 90's. It suggests things are not quite in control." -- PETER STANGL, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  [ A1:3 ] .


Market Place; Options Soar With Surge In Stocks
Options, the financial instruments that feed on Wall Street excitement, are booming.
Volatility in the stock market is always good for the options business, and the surge in stock prices in recent weeks has been steep enough to make options traders smile broadly.
The daily volume of options contracts traded on the nation's five options exchanges has begun to pierce the one million level regularly, and the daily average so far this month, 980,000, is the highest monthly rate in a year.
It is also one of the highest monthly levels since the options market peaked -- and crashed -- in 1987.


Iowans to Caucus Without Suspense
What always fascinated the country about the Iowa political caucuses was their predilection for underdogs, like George McGovern in 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Gary Hart in 1984 and Pat Robertson in 1988.
But this year, the underdogs have been shut out.
The powers that be have construed the rules in such a way that the Presidential long shots are concentrating on New Hampshire.
When Iowa speaks on Feb. 10, few people elsewhere will listen, because everyone knows precisely what will happen.


A Slide on Wild Side Gets Pipkins in Games
When Robert Pipkins was 4 years old, he would sled down Silver Lake hill in Staten Island on his red plastic toboggan.
Even then, the little boy from Bailey Place was the only child who would dare to jump a narrow creek at the bottom.
"The sled would stick at the edge, and I would keep flying across," Pipkins said.
"I always loved exciting things."


Imports by Rail Cut in Half Amount of Cargo Arriving at Region Docks
The "K" Line's big new container terminal lies right on the Elizabeth seaport shipping channel, yet the last time the thousands of bright red cargo containers moving through it were on a ship, they were approaching the ports at Los Angeles, Oakland or Tacoma, 3,000 miles to the west.
In a trend that threatens to push the New York metropolitan region's maritime industry further onto the sidelines of international trade, half or more of the imports destined for the East Coast arrive not on the great merchant fleets that once crowded the docks of New York and New Jersey, but stacked two deep on high-tech railroad flat cars, hauled by trains often a mile in length that dash in from the West Coast in three days.


Rulers Taking Power in Algeria Halt Elections to the Parliament
The military and civilian leaders who have taken the reins of Algeria's Government put an end to elections today, wiping out voting that had placed an Islamic fundamentalist party on the verge of taking control of the country's Parliament.
The Government of Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali acted under strong pressure from the Algerian Army, which forced President Chadli Benjedid to resign on Saturday in an attempt to prevent the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front from scoring further gains in a second round of voting that had been set for Thursday.


Powerful Technology Riding Gentle Breezes
Yachtsmen who grew up sailing with a chilly Atlantic Ocean spray in their face tend to scoff at the idea of an America's Cup series held in the soft, forgiving breezes of sunny California.
Behind the smugness is the belief that competition for yachting's most prestigious prize deserves more demanding conditions.
But Eastern purists have yet to see the thrilling, frightening power of the new class of boats under sail.
The sloops are built to be powerful, and at 75 feet, they can also be unruly.
When the 110-foot mast breaks, the spar snaps like a matchstick and falls like a pillar.
A collision between two of the heavily canvassed yachts can have the impact of a locomotive running into a boxcar.


Communist Supporters in Moscow Demand Resignation of Government


Retail Chains Move Accounts
Two large retail chains have moved their advertising accounts.
Office Max Inc. in Beachwood, Ohio, an office-products retailer owned by the K Mart Corporation, has named the Ross Roy Group in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., as its new agency of record, replacing Sharp Advertising Inc. in Cleveland.


The Shakeout Begins In French TV Stations
As soon as President Francois Mitterrand approved the creation of France's first independent television stations in the mid-1980's, media groups hurriedly sought entry into a business that Britain's Lord Thomson of Fleet once described as "a license to print money."
Now, six years later, La Cinq -- Channel Five -- has become the first of the new television stations to collapse.
With accumulated losses of $550 million, it declared itself bankrupt on New Year's Eve and surrendered control to a court-appointed administrator who will decide its fate.


What You Can Keep Though Bankrupt
To the Editor:
You may have caused some readers to infer that losing one's home and car is a necessary result of insolvency through "New England's Siren Call of the 80's Becomes Echo of Depression" (front page, Dec. 15).
The article does bring home the chilling reality of the economic cycle.


Robert Hess, 59, Historian, Dies; Was Brooklyn College President
Robert L. Hess, who assumed the presidency of Brooklyn College amid campus turmoil and decline in the 1970's and led the era of its resurgence as a top-ranked school, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.
He was 59 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
He died of lymphoma, a college spokesman said.
The illness had limited his work since last June.


Worldwatch Report Calls 1990's Decisive Decade for Environment
Two years ago, the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute warned that the world had about 40 years in which to reverse environmental deterioration or face a long decline into economic and social ruin.
But in its latest annual report, the institute asserts that the 1990's are the "decisive decade" for environmental change, declaring that nothing short of an "environmental revolution" will save the planet.


Washington Talk; F.B.I. Shifts Its Course After Cold War Thaw
On the surface, the redeployment of 300 counterintelligence agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation to combat street gangs represented a small but concrete example of what the collapse of the Soviet bloc can mean at home.
But within Federal law-enforcement circles, the shift announced last week by Attorney General William P. Barr came as a stunning break with the past.
It represented the first substantial contraction of the F.B.I.'s counterespionage operations in 50 years and is the largest single reallocation of resources in the bureau's history.


CHRONICLE
In a sense, the fate of the planet is a continuing drama.
What will happen to the ozone layer, to the rain forests, to air and water quality?
Tune in during the next century for some clues.
So it does not seem too incongruous that the folks who specialize in cliff-hangers of a different sort -- soap operas -- should have some interest in the environment.


E. C. Anderberg, 76, Retired Bank President
Edward C. Anderberg, the retired president and chief administrative officer of Green Point Savings Bank, died Thursday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I.
He was 76 years old and lived in Laurel Hollow, L.I.
He died of cancer, his family said.


Karen Schwarz, Writer, Is Wed
Karen Schwarz, a writer in Alexandria, Va., and Jeffrey Mark Peisch, a vice president of Time-Life Video and Television there, were married yesterday at the Rainbow Room in New York.
Rabbi Charles Lippman officiated.
Ms.
Schwarz, 34 years old, will keep her name.
She is the author of "What You Can Do for Your Country: An Oral History of the Peace Corps," published in July by William Morrow &amp; Company.
A graduate of Skidmore College, she is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph M. Schwarz of New York.
Her father is the president of Pathway Optical Products Inc., which makes eyeglasses in Long Island City, Queens.


Poetry Finds a New Forum: the Videocassette
In the age of "Yo!" and the nutritionless sound bite, poetry is fighting back with new technology.
Riding a surge of interest in live poetry readings, Norman Rose, a New York City actor and poet, has created Off the Page, the first poetry magazine on videocassette.
The first issue is to go on sale Friday at Brentano's bookstore, 597 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, which will celebrate with an after-hours party.
Monitors will allow guests to watch 72 minutes of readings by poets like Richard Wilbur, Robert Pinsky, Carolyn Forche and Amy Clampitt, as well as a performance of Willa Cather poems set to music and four short plays by the poet Kenneth Koch.


Lasker Rink Ice Hockey Revives Harlem Meer
To the Editor:
I live near the north end of New York City's Central Park and have used this part of the park for strolling and jogging for 25 years.
In recent years the low level of park use in the area of the Harlem Meer has caused me concern.
Especially during renovation of the Meer, drug dealing has replaced more legitimate park uses at the Lenox Avenue-110th Street entrance to the park.


Despite Grief, Thinking of Neediest
People find many reasons to contribute to The New York Times Neediest Cases, but among the most touching are those that move people to give despite their own difficulties.
"With my marriage falling apart and my work very stressful because of the economic difficulties," wrote a Manhattan man, who gave $1,000, "I am thankful I have a job and a place to live. This contribution is the beginning of my efforts to give back more to the world this year."


Paul Simon Begins South Africa Concerts
Paul Simon brought the driving rhythms of his acclaimed "Graceland" album home to South Africa Saturday night, beginning a controversial series of concerts that effectively ends a long era of cultural isolation.
The American singer's visit drew protests from a small but vociferous minority of radical black groups, who contended that apartheid was not sufficiently dismantled to justify lifting the boycott on tours by foreign artists, as the United Nations decided last month.


Avoiding Confrontations In Wake of Racial Attack
The day after her two children were attacked by four young white men who squirted them with a white liquid in what the police say was a bias assault, Nellie Wilson was deluged with telephone calls.
Mayor David N. Dinkins wanted to know if the two black children, a 14-year-old boy and his 12-year-old sister, needed the aid of city counselors.
The Rev.
Al Sharpton wanted to know if he could call on the family.


Rangers Aren't Bad; LaFontaine Is Better
In the past six months, Pat LaFontaine has endured a contract dispute, a bitter holdout, a major trade, a broken jawbone and a cut artery.
To protect his healing face, LaFontaine wears a helmet and shield that make him look like one of the early astronauts of the Mercury space program.
Despite the setbacks and the extra headgear, LaFontaine is rocketing up the league scoring chart, and his Buffalo Sabres are in orbit behind him.
He scored twice and set up another goal tonight to lead the Sabres to a 6-3 victory over the Rangers at Memorial Auditorium.

U.S. SEEKS REFUNDS OF RESEARCH COSTS
Federal auditors have found that 14 research universities inappropriately billed the Government several million dollars for housing, personal expenses, travel, entertainment, fund raising and other activities unrelated to research.
A report on the auditors' findings, for the Department of Health and Human Services, provides the first detailed indication of how widespread such overcharges are among universities conducting research for the Government.
The audits, undertaken after last year's disclosures of overcharges at Stanford University, surveyed 14 research universities and found overcharges or questionable charges at all of them, though on a smaller scale than those reported at Stanford.


New Season Will Probably Be a Spinoff of '91
On the court and off, tennis took a tumultuous turn in 1991, where breakthroughs, break-ups and breakdowns were circuit staples.
Jimmy Connors, a United States Open semifinalist, and Henri Leconte, the ringer on France's championship Davis Cup team, were resurrected from tennis' terminal unit.
Martina Navratilova tied Chris Evert's record of 157 career titles, but failed to defend her record ninth Wimbledon title and found herself on trial for real in Texas.
Monica Seles made state-of-the-art money but made people mad with anti-establishment escapades.
France stole away the United States' Davis Cup in a rollicking final.
Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg were slowed to a standstill by injuries when the endless tennis season finally ended.


Elkington Wins a Sudden End to Infiniti
Smooth-swinging Steve Elkington rebounded from some erratic ball striking and a botched putt to seize the Infiniti Tournament of Champions in a sudden-death playoff with Brad Faxon.
Elkington, who missed an eight-foot birdie putt that would have given him a victory on the 72d hole, drained a 10-footer on the first playoff hole for a winning birdie.
He shot a final-round even-par 72 over a tough La Costa course for a 72-hole total of nine-under-par 279.

A Familiar Team May Be Out
The careers of two of the most familiar and successful advertising characters of the 1980's, Frank Bartles and Ed Jaymes, seem at an end.
David Rufkahr, an Oregon rancher who played Bartles, the talkative pitchman for Bartles &amp; Jaymes wine coolers, told The Associated Press last week that contracts for him and for his partner, Dick Maugg, a California contractor who played the silent Jaymes, expired and were not renewed.


Florio Is Expected to Sign Fiber Optic Legislation
Legislation that would allow New Jersey Bell to install a fiber optic network and provide a video billboard service statewide is expected to be signed by Gov.
Jim Florio, possibly as early as this week.
The legislation, which was passed by the Legislature last week, was staunchly opposed by newspaper and cable television executives, who said that it would give the telephone company an unfair competitive advantage.

Nassau County Officials Feuding Over Cutbacks
As Nassau County Republicans feud over recent election losses and budget woes, Democratic leaders are flexing their newly won strength and are closely monitoring the impact of 3,000 county layoffs and painful cuts in services.
All sides agree that the county is faced with a grave financial crisis because of the recession, and that old approaches, like raising taxes, are no longer politically acceptable.
But they remain at odds over how to deal with the execution and aftermath of the fiscal blood-letting.

Mann Turns Kramer and Game Around
Although the game wouldn't turn in Washington's favor until the third quarter, the Redskins' defense sent an ominous message to Detroit before the contest was even 50 seconds old.
The message, delivered by Charles Mann, the Redskins' veteran defensive end, planted seeds of doubt that would sprout into misgivings and finally into shattered confidence by the third quarter.

PROTEST IN RUSSIA OVER PRICE RISES
About 10,000 Communist supporters took to the streets today to angrily protest rising prices and demand the resignation of the Russian Government.
The rally, held under a wet snow on the same square outside the Kremlin where anti-Communist forces used to gather for mass demonstrations, also heard protests from military officers against the fragmentation of the army.





A Credible Search for M.I.A.'s
The Bush Administration may have buried the "Vietnam syndrome" in Kuwait, but another legacy of the Vietnam War keeps corroding public confidence in government: the M.I.A.'s.
There is little responsible support for the idea that Americans missing in action are still being held against their will in Indochina.
Yet polls show that a majority of Americans thinks they are.
That popular view is now being reinforced by sensational allegations from Gen.
Oleg Kalugin, a former top K.G.B. official.
General Kalugin claims that U.S. prisoners of war were interrogated by K.G.B. agents inside the Soviet Union years after Hanoi supposedly returned all living prisoners to the United States.
He'll meet with Administration officials this week.

Social Security Tax

Ron Greenberg (letter, Dec. 29) wants to reduce the Social Security tax on employers and employees alike to 3.1 percent and increase the amount subject to the tax to $106,800.
Halving the tax rate and doubling the amount subject to the tax will free dollars for employers and employees alike, but why stop at a number like $106,800 for the tax base?


PRO FOOTBALL It's a Date: Redskins and Bills to Meet in Super Bowl; Washington Passes Send Lions Packing
The Washington Redskins found their running game snuffed much of the afternoon and their special teams not particularly special.
So, to make the most of a big-play defense that sparkled and shut out the Detroit Lions in the second half, the Redskins turned to a deep passing game that burned the Lions as quickly as a torch applied to a kerosene-laden wick.
Mark Rypien heaved second-half touchdown passes of 45 yards to Gary Clark and 21 yards to Art Monk to spark the Redskins to a 41-10 rout of the Lions in the National Football Conference championship game before 55,585 fans at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.
Washington, with the league's best record of 16-2, earned a trip to Super Bowl XXVI on Jan. 26 in Minneapolis where the Redskins will meet the A.F.C. champion Buffalo Bills.

Pastor Aids in Suspect's Arrest
The pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem knew his part-time handyman as a young man from a fine churchgoing family.
But one day last week, the police told him that the man, Joseph Wigfall, was wanted in a robbery that left an ice-cream store manager shot in the head.
Two New York City detectives asked for the pastor's help in arresting the man.
And yesterday, Mr.
Wigfall turned himself in to the pastor, the Rev.
Calvin O. Butts 3d, telling him that he was ready to surrender.

Saying that New York and a handful of other states were bearing too much of the cost of incarcerating foreign-born criminals and illegal aliens, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato yesterday proposed that the Federal Government hold these prisoners in unused military bases.
At a news conference outside the Immigration and Naturalization Service Detention Center at 201 Varick Street, Senator D'Amato said he would introduce a bill allowing for the conversion of three closed military bases into correctional centers.
He did not say which bases could be used.

BOSTON TRIAL SET ON KING'S PAPERS
A state judge ruled today that Boston University and the widow of the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. must go to trial to determine who has lawful right to more than 83,000 documents that the slain civil rights leader left to the university in his lifetime.
His widow, Coretta Scott King, sued Boston University in 1987 demanding the return of the papers, which include about a third of all Dr.
King's letters, manuscripts and other papers and form the centerpiece of the university's collection of personal archives.
She said the papers belong with other archival material of Dr.
King's at the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, in Atlanta.

ISRAELIS IN ACCORD WITH PALESTINIANS ON BASIS FOR TALKS
Israel and the Palestinians began face-to-face talks today after ending a monthlong procedural dispute.
The talks, the first substantive negotiations ever between the two sides, are considered the first, still-tentative step toward devising a plan for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories.
After reaching agreement this morning on a negotiating formula that would accommodate both the Israeli demand that the Palestinians be considered part of a joint delegation with Jordan, and the Palestinian preference for a separate status and agenda, all three delegations met together this evening for about half an hour.

The 'Logic' in I.R.A. Zealotry
The bomb that exploded in central London last week was not meant to kill but to serve as a calling card for the Irish Republican Army.
The blast near the Defense Ministry followed weeks of incendiary bombing in Britain and Northern Ireland designed to cause maximum disruption with minimum loss of life.
The relative lack of bloodshed is a minimal concession to public relations for which minimal thanks are owed.
But the real aim of the attacks is malign: to provoke reprisals that will undermine attempts to deal rationally with one of Europe's most intractable quarrels.


Mallette to Give Devils a Rough Edge
The trade of Dave Maley to Edmonton for Troy Mallette, the resurgence of Chris Terreri and the promotion of Aleksandr Semak made the Devils a better team this morning than a day earlier.
The 21-year-old Mallette will provide the physical presence the Devils lacked on the left side of their attack, a role that Maley filled in his first four years with the Devils but failed miserably in this season.

Big Denver Cattle Show Reflects Sunset on West
Al Rose, a tall, craggy 66-year-old rancher, leaned an elbow against a fence post and watched a handsome Hereford strut past the reviewing stand at the National Western Stock Show.
"Used to be, almost everyone I knew was a rancher," he said, tipping back his Stetson.
"But there just aren't many of us left out in the country anymore."
But even as so many cowboys fade from the range, this most powerful of American myths only grows stronger.
To many urbanites who rope their paychecks from behind computer terminals and glass-covered desks, the ranch has become the nation's most exotic place.

Israel Is Said to Expect Less In Loan Aid for Immigrants
Israel's leaders are increasingly resigned to the likelihood that they will have to settle for far less than the $10 billion in United States loan guarantees that they are seeking to resettle new immigrants, Government officials and representatives of American Jewish groups say.
Although the Israelis are formally pressing ahead with their request -- $2 billion worth of annual loan guarantees spread over the next five years -- "they are accepting the inevitable," an official of one Jewish group said.

The new ones feature olive oil laced with garlic essence, champagne mustard packaged in handsome ceramic pots and blue corn tortilla chips with sesame seeds.
They are likely to be called President's Choice, Sensational or World Classic.


U.S. Ship to Investigate Damage From Oil Pollution in Persian Gulf
A YEAR after immense oil spills fouled the waters of the Persian Gulf during the war against Iraq, the United States this week is dispatching an oceanographic research vessel for the most comprehensive look so far at the damage to the marine environment there.
Dozens of scientists from several countries, including Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other gulf states, as well as the United States and Europe, will take part in studies for about 100 days as the Mount Mitchell, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, investigates the oily wounds of the shallow gulf.
Most of the oil was spilled when Iraq sabotaged oil facilities, although shelling and bombing by both sides contributed to the pollution.

Unless We All Speak Up for Salman Rushdie
To the Editor:
Leslie H. Gelb, purporting to defend Salman Rushdie in "Rushdie's Death Foretold" (column, Dec. 29), makes the astonishing assertion that he was offended by what "The Satanic Verses," the novel for which Mr.
Rushdie is under death threat from the mullahs of Iran, had to say about Islam.
It strains credibility that those who have supported Mr.
Rushdie all along have to say again that the supposedly offensive passages represent the thoughts of a fictional character, not just any fictional character, but one who is clearly identified as mentally ill, on medication, hallucinating freely, and that these passages are not just his thoughts, but his dreams.

Profit Off 30% at Chase as Loan-Loss Reserve Is Built Up
The Chase Manhattan Corporation reported a 30 percent drop in earnings in the fourth quarter, but returned to profitability for the full year.
Analysts said attempts by the bank to reduce costs and improve the quality of its loans appeared to be slowly working.
And the PNC Financial Corporation of Pittsburgh reported a profit for the quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier.
In the fourth quarter, Chase, the nation's sixth-largest bank holding company, earned $135 million, or 80 cents a share.
This compares with $193 million, or $1.32 a share in the previous fourth quarter.
The 1990 fourth quarter, however, included a one-time gain of $51 million, or 39 cents a share.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
For many mega-marketers, the Super Bowl still provides a glitzy backdrop for extravagant advertisements and promotions.
But others that once thought the game as super for them as for the football teams that play in it intend to sit out Super Sunday this year.
The game's diminution, which began after several ho-hum matches in the late 1980's, has accelerated for three reasons: the relentless rise in the cost of a commercial, to more than $28,300 a second; the sluggish economy, and a sense that Super Bowl hyperbole might be just another example of the excesses of the 80's.

Castro Cracking Down As the Hardships Grow
With Cuba's economy spiraling sharply downward, leading ever-larger numbers of citizens toward desperate efforts to flee the island, the Government of President Fidel Castro has stepped up efforts to crush internal opposition.
At the same time, it is seeking to forge greater unity by raising the specter of invasion by the United States.
After a year in which more than 2,000 Cubans escaped the island on makeshift rafts, the largest number of refugees since the Mariel boatlift in 1981, the New Year began with a spate of spectacular new efforts by its citizens to flee a life where annoying shortages have given way to grinding hardship in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The New York State Investigation Commission said today that it had found no criminal wrongdoing in the publicly financed purchase of Roosevelt Raceway by private investors in 1984 or in Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's efforts to secure Federal tax relief for the raceway.
The commission's report, issued after an 18-month inquiry, was another victory for Senator D'Amato, who was cleared last August by the Senate Ethics Committee after accusations that he had violated Senate rules and Federal laws to help campaign contributors and political associates.

Button labeled Bowman's calculatedly stodgy program "ordinary, boring, slow, conservative and sedate" -- the kind of analysis that doubles as provocation for those disinclined to agree.

Cloth Diaper Closings Set By Gerber
Citing declining consumer belief in the environmental benefits of cloth diapers, as well as foreign competition, the Gerber Products Company said yesterday that it would close three cloth-weaving operations.
The move will result in 900 layoffs and a $16 million charge against earnings in the company's third quarter, which ended on Dec. 31.
Gerber said its cloth diaper sales were likely to be about $30 million in the year ending on March 31, off about 40 percent from the previous year.
The company, by far the largest supplier of cloth diapers, said declining sales had forced it to buy cloth from low-cost domestic and foreign textile weavers.


Attica Jury Is Still Out
As the jury in the trial to determine four New York State officials' liability in the 1971 Attica prison insurrection completed its third day of deliberations today, a verdict seemed ever less imminent.
The nine-member panel again viewed videotapes of the retaking of the prison on Sept. 13, 1971, and asked to rehear more than 40 hours of taped testimony by New York State troopers who were involved in quelling the five-day siege at the maximum-security prison 30 miles east of here.
Meanwhile, the judge, John T. Elfvin, is scheduled to leave on Wednesday for a three-week vacation in Barbados, though court officials said the judge would turn the case over to a magistrate and follow proceedings from the Caribbean.
Lawyers for the 1,281 inmates filed the civil-liability suit against the state officials in 1974.

Marion Merrell Chief Braces for Patent Fight
Fred W. Lyons Jr., Marion Merrell Dow Inc.'s new chief executive, calls the company's achievements in preparing for the future more important than its formidable 20 percent earnings gain in 1991.
Mr.
Lyons, 56 years old, was promoted on Jan. 1, succeeding Joseph G. Temple Jr., 62, who is staying on as chairman.
Mr.
Lyons is girding for a tough challenge as patent protection for Marion Merrell Dow's two main drugs expires.
The expiration this month for Cardizem, a blood-pressure drug with annual sales of $900 million, threatens a product that accounts for 36 percent of the company's total sales, which were $2.5 billion last year.
And Seldane, a non-sedative antihistamine that had $700 million in worldwide sales, faces the loss of patent protection in April 1994.

Dow Off 13.86, to 3,185.60, on Heavy Volume
Blue-chip stock prices fell yesterday, while secondary issues held onto gains in choppy but heavy trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 13.86 points, to 3,185.60.
Traders said the market consolidation that began late last week was aided by several factors, including soft bond prices, a sharp overnight decline in the Tokyo market and growing investor concern that the Fed will not lower interest rates any time soon.


Careers; For M.B.A.'s, Dim Outlook This Spring
MORE than 70,000 M.B.A.'s will be awarded this spring, but many proud holders of those degrees will find slim pickings in the job market.
Recession has stripped away whole layers of middle management, and even companies that are hiring aggressively, like financial firms, are taking experienced people who have been laid off elsewhere.
Those who are lucky enough to find jobs will have to settle for less than the $60,000 to $70,000 typically offered by many large companies in the New York area.
And many will end up with small- to mid-sized companies.
William E. Mayer, dean of the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Rochester, suggested one possible outcome of this fierce competition for jobs.
"We see many fewer graduate business schools in the future," he said, citing about 900 currently, which might eventually evolve into 75 or so.
"Only the best ones will survive."

Picked Up by Buffalo And Enjoying the Ride
Earlier this week Bills cornerback Kirby Jackson didn't speak with bitterness when he discussed being drafted and then cut by the New York Jets in 1987.
He wanted to concentrate on his tenure with Buffalo, which will be making its second consecutive trip to the Super Bowl after defeating Denver, 10-7, on Sunday.


Hispanic Boy Attacked By 3 Whites in the Bronx
Three white teen-agers attacked a 12-year-old Hispanic boy on his way to school in the Bronx yesterday morning, punching him and smearing white makeup on his face in what the police said was a copycat crime.
The attack occurred on a grassy strip along Pelham Parkway South near White Plains Road, south of the Williamsbridge neighborhood where a black brother and sister were beaten up in a bias attack last week by a group of youths who claimed to belong to a gang calling itself "A.B.I.," for Albanian Boys Inc.

Candidate With U.S. Citizenship Blocks Clear Victory in Bulgaria
The surprising third-place finish of a dark horse candidate who holds United States as well as Bulgarian citizenship was being credited today with siphoning off votes that would have given President Zhelyu Zhelev a clear victory in this country's first direct presidential elections on Sunday.
In tallies reported today Mr.
Zhelev, the candidate of the Union of Democratic Forces, received almost 45 percent of the vote.
Velko Valkanov, the candidate of the Socialist Party, which evolved from the former ruling Communist Party, received 30.6 percent of the vote for a strong showing in a field of 21 contenders.
Mr.
Zhelev and Mr.
Valkanov will now face off in a second round, since neither won a majority.

How to Curb Campus Alcohol Abuse
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 31 front-page article on abusive campus drinking mentions that more and more institutions ban the serving of alcohol on campus.
This tempting extreme risks pushing drinking underground or into off-campus sites, from which students often drive away inebriated.
Another approach, evolving in the last five years at places like Connecticut College, bears consideration.

Nassau Board Democrats Call Hearings, and G.O.P. Cries Foul
The Republican majority on the Nassau County Board of Supervisors today accused the Democratic minority of "using the worst kind of political smoke and mirrors" as a "veiled prelude for a call for higher taxes."
The Democrats quickly fired back, accusing the Republicans of "insensitivity to the voters" and "playing politics at the expense of county employees who will be laid off" because of budget cuts.


Doctor With Revoked License Is Arrested in Abortion Case
A Queens gynecologist whose medical license was revoked after state health officials found he had performed abortions in a "grossly incompetent manner" was arrested yesterday preparing to perform another abortion, law-enforcement authorities said.
The doctor, Ming Kow Hah, lost his license in August for cases that included leaving the head of one fetus inside his patient.
He was arrested yesterday after he agreed to perform an abortion on an undercover investigator, the authorities said.


Snows of Yesteryear
To the Editor:
If every mom had been persuaded not to trash all those comic books, now worth thousands of dollars, that you lament in "Wow! Zap! Ugh!" (editorial, Dec. 23), there would be no market for them today, and attics and garages would be overrun with comic books of no value.
I never collected them, so I don't care much.


Long Gone, Largely Forgotten, and Yet Such a Memorable Life
DOES Brando do TV?
Because the life of this dead guy from New Rochelle would make a fantastic mini-series.

On Tuesday, he falls in with a revolutionary underground plotting against the king -- secret midnight meetings, etc., O.K.?
On Wednesday, he crosses the Atlantic, finds the revolution flagging.
It's winter, Valley Forge, that whole bit.
What?
Right, the times that try men's souls, very good.

FOOTBALL: The N.F.L.'s Ideal Couple Prepares for Battle; One Objective Left for Buffalo: Super Bowl Title
All year long, the Bills kept a tight reign on their emotions and a sharp eye on their goals.
They maintained a businesslike approach to each game, never getting too high or too low after victories or defeats.
That attitude helped them reach their goals of winning the American Football Conference Eastern Division and the A.F.C. championship.
In the wake of Sunday's 10-7 victory over Denver, the Bills are hoping that same attitude will help them accomplish the last objective on their list, which is winning the Super Bowl.
And they will get their chance when they play Washington in Super Bowl XXVI at Minneapolis on Jan. 26.

Jets Hire a Coach for Their Quarterbacks -- Make That Nagle
Bruce Coslet finally let the other shoe drop yesterday in his plans to prepare Browning Nagle to take over the Jets' quarterbacking job next season.
The Jets announced the hiring of Walt Harris, head coach at the University of the Pacific, as Coslet's new quarterbacks coach.
Only a week ago the Jets announced they would not renew the contract of Joe Daniels, who had been the quarterback coach for the first two years of the Coslet regime.


Surgical Scorecards: Can Doctors Be Rated Just Like Ballplayers?
For patients facing a heart operation, a crucial question is: how good is my surgeon?
Until recent weeks, there was no objective way to answer that with statistics giving a surgical batting average.
But now the questions are taking on new importance following the New York State Health Department's reluctant disclosure of death statistics for each heart surgeon.
A New York State Supreme Court order resulting from Newsday's request under the freedom of information law forced health officials to release data they had been collecting over recent years.
They revealed wide variations between hospitals and among surgeons within the same institution.

Russian Is Sky-High in U.S.
A year ago, when Maksim Tarasov came to the United States from Russia to pole-vault, he stayed for a month with the family of Eugene Dall, the track coach at North Rockland High School in Thiels, N.Y.
Dall's son, Bryan, learned enough from his father and their house guest to vault 14 feet, a New York State record for a sophomore.
Tarasov is staying with the family again for five weeks.
At age 21, he is the world's third-ranking vaulter, with a career best of 19 feet 2 1/4 inches.


Bank Ruling Is Let Stand
The Supreme Court let stand today a ruling allowing state-chartered units of banks to sell insurance if allowed under state law.
The move dealt a blow to insurers' efforts to keep banks out of their business.
The Court, without comment, denied an appeal by a number of insurance groups of a ruling last June by a Federal appeals court in New York.
The ruling and its affirmation were expected to encourage banks to move into insurance nationwide.

Sports of The Times; A Mountain Out of A Super Hill
ONLY 12 more shopping days until the Super Bowl.
Only 12 more days to buy your Redskin headdresses, or war paint, or hog snouts ("hogs" being the nickname within the nickname for the team's offensive linemen).
Only 12 more days to buy your buffaloes, Bill, and hoofs and horns and other beasty accessories in order to highlight your affection for one of the participating teams in this great corporate enterprise.
Now in its 26th year, the Super Bowl has become something beyond a game.
It is a national institution, a cash-flow operation like the Treasury Department; and a national momument, like Grant's Tomb or Mount Rushmore, or at least Disneyland.


G.M. Announces Recall To Repair V6 Engines
The General Motors Corporation confirmed today that it was recalling about 1.5 million cars to repair defective V6 engines.

Mr. Bush, Still Abusing Legal Services
President Bush has once again deviously resorted to a device known as the recess appointment to weaken the Legal Services Corporation -- a valued Federal agency that provides legal help to poor people who have no other means of defending their rights.
On Friday, with Congress out of session, Mr.
Bush renamed 10 board members whose previous recess appointments had expired.
The 11th member, appointed during last summer's recess, continues to sit.
Few of the 11 support a vigorous poverty law program and some have worked to kill it.


A Preliminary Gun Sounds Today for America's Cup 1992
On Sunday night, the San Diego Yacht Club threw a pep rally that looked more like a Desert Storm send-off than a prelude to Tuesday's start of elimination races for its two America's Cup defense teams.
Young children of yachtsmen wearing red, white and blue uniforms waved red, white and blue flags as if their little arms would fall off.
But the enthusiasm did little to disguise the fact that the two teams are America's Cup underdogs.

T.W.A. to Lure Business Class With Fare Cuts and Rebates
In a challenge to American Airlines, which recently announced business-class service on domestic flights, Trans World Airlines this week will begin offering round-trip business-class fares of $1,100 on its coast-to-coast flights.
In addition, T.W.A. will rebate at least 12 percent of the fares, in the form of credits that can be exchanged for cash.
The new, unrestricted fares are almost $900 lower than the $1,976 round-trip fare between New York and Los Angeles that American said it might charge when it introduces business-class service on that route next month, and $300 less than T.W.A.'s current lowest unrestricted business-class fares on transcontinental flights.


Jury Change Sought
Lawyers for MIKE TYSON asked a judge in Indianapolis yestserday to broaden the pool of potential jurors for his Jan. 27 rape trial, contending that the Marion County system drew too few members of minority groups to jury duty.
The lawyers representing the 25-year-old former heavyweight champion filed a motion asking Marion Superior Court Judge PATRICIA GIFFORD to add names from utility customer lists, motor vehicle licensing files or telephone directories.
Potential jurors in Marion County are drawn from voter registration lists.


If the Need Is to Knot
After designing custom clothes for a few seasons, Gene Meyer turned his attention a year ago to scarfs.
His designs proved so original and his colors so cheerful that stores suggested that he try his hand at men's ties, whose sales were booming. (They were one of the few fashion areas that saw increases in the recent holiday selling period.)
But there was a wrinkle: Stores began asking for ties to sell to women.

Or consider it the counterpoint to the underwear-as-outerwear, skin-baring, hauntingly-low-neckline styles that are flourishing for spring.
Shirts and shirtdresses offer a neat, tailored alternative to flouncy, transparent, obviously seductive clothes.

Trenton Democrats Go Home Kicking
After a raucous two-year term that produced a record $2.8 billion tax increase, revolutionized the way the state finances secondary education, changed the way its drivers are insured and established one of the nation's toughest bans on assault weapons, the 204th session of the New Jersey Legislature ended today.
And with it died Democratic legislative control.
The 205th Legislature convenes at 12:01 P.M. on Tuesday, when Republican majorities take over in both the Assembly and the Senate.
In a frenzied final burst of activity, the outgoing Legislature completed its official business today, racing through 156 bills.


Market Place; Making a Case For U S Sprint
IF MCI is David to A.T.&amp;T.'s Goliath, then U S Sprint is David's smaller brother.
As 1991 ended, Robert B. Morris of Goldman, Sachs estimates, U S Sprint had 9.8 percent of the market for long-distance calls, based on minutes of use, up slightly from 9.5 percent the year before.
That is about half of MCI's 19 percent, which was up from the 18.4 percent a year earlier.
He estimates A.T.&amp;T. had 67 percent, down from 68.2 percent in 1990.


Alamo Limiting Car Rentals
Alamo Rent-a-Car Inc. said yesterday that because of excessive damage by people who rent in their hometowns, such local renters in some cities would have to apply in advance for a "safe driver" card.
Applicants would pay $10 and have their driver's license records examined; those with a moving violation in the last 24 months would be rejected.

Reversing earlier indications that it would await diplomatic cover from European governments, the Vatican formally recognized the independence of Croatia and Slovenia today, underscoring Pope John Paul II's desire to show strong support for the predominantly Roman Catholic republics.
In recent days, Vatican officials said behind the scenes that the Catholic Church would delay its symbolically important recognition of the two separatist states until Jan. 15, the European Community deadline for replying to requests for recognition from the component parts of the crumbling Yugoslav federation.

Business Scene; Getting the Most From Each Ruble
MINDFUL of Russia's destructively high inflation, the Savings Bank of Russia announced higher interest rates last week for the millions of people who keep their savings in the bank's numerous branches.
Rates on passbook accounts went to 3 percent from 2 percent, while the returns on certificates of deposit now range as high as 15 percent for a five-year certificate, up suddenly from 9 percent.
That is not much help when the annual inflation rate is more than 300 percent and a 15,000-ruble account -- for many middle-class Russians a once-handsome sum that two years ago could buy a country dacha -- is now barely enough to keep a family in food and other necessities for a few months.

Line Is Forming for Title Shot
Things change.
Just recently, Evander Holyfield seemed so close to signing for a March 20 heavyweight title rematch with George Foreman at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev.
But suddenly, Riddick Bowe has moved center stage in the backroom maneuvers that have arisen in response to the the position taken by Jose Sulaiman, the president of the World Boxing Council.
Late last week, Sulaiman said that Mike Tyson and only Mike Tyson would get the next shot at Holyfield's title.
Sulaiman said he had spoken to Tyson, who had assured him that he would be training before, during and after his Jan. 27 rape trial in Indianapolis.


TV Guide to Cut Rate Base Again
TV Guide will cut its rate base, the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, for the second time in eight months.
The weekly magazine will also raise its cover price and reduce its advertising rates.
Effective with the March 7 issue, the rate base will drop by 7.9 percent, to 14 million from 15.2 million.
The cover price, now 79 cents, will rise to 85 cents or 89 cents, depending upon the outcome of tests in local markets, TV Guide said.
Ad rates will be reduced by 4 percent; a four-color ad page, for example, will drop to $112,700 from $117,350.

Review/Dance; Mazowsze in Selection of Polish Regional Works
The costumes were exquisite, the performers were charming and the dances and musical interludes were nicely balanced between the lilting and the vigorous when Mazowsze, the Polish State Ensemble of Folk Song and Dance, performed on Sunday afternoon at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College.
But the greatest -- and much rarer -- virtue of the program was its integrity.
Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska, the director of the 44-year-old troupe, knows how to put together a fast-paced and entertaining program.
But with one shameless though enjoyable exception -- a suite of American traditional songs -- there seemed to be little thought of enticing the audience with unwarranted glitter and razzle-dazzle.
Some amount of theatricalization is necessary to bring any folk art to the stage.
But here were dances and songs from most of the regions of Poland, alluding to most of the important ceremonies of Polish life and culture, and one felt free to take from them what one would.


Digital Back in PC Market With Bold Mail-Order Plans
Nearly 10 years after the first of several forays into the personal computer market, the Digital Equipment Corporation is starting a major campaign to sell the desktop machines -- this time, through mail-order channels.
Digital is slashing the prices of its current PC line by up to 50 percent, going head to head with companies like Dell Computer Inc. and Gateway 2000 for a slice of the nearly $1.5 billion mail-order market for personal computers.
According to the International Data Corporation, the mail-order business makes up 5 percent of the $26.9 billion market.

Facing Strikes, Walesa Laughs at History's Joke
With the Polish Government facing threats of a national strike from the increasingly assertive Solidarity trade union, President Lech Walesa, who founded the union, grinned puckishly today as he reflected on how history had heaped paradox upon paradox.
Mr.
Walesa, the only chief of state in the recently post-Communist world to have begun his career as a worker among what were once called the masses, said that "only after the revolutions in Moscow, Prague and Budapest," were the working-class ideals cited by the previous rulers gaining real force.


As Redskins Progress, Gibbs Stays a Constant Amid the Transitions
The Redskins are headed for their fourth Super Bowl in nine seasons.
They have achieved that with three quarterbacks -- Joe Theismann in the 1982 and 1983 seasons, Doug Williams in 1987 and Mark Rypien now -- and, except for the offensive line, other interchangeable parts.
One constant has been the coach, 51-year-old Joe Gibbs.
In his 11 years, the Redskins have the National Football League's best playoff record (14-4) and the second best overall record (127-57 to the San Francisco 49ers' 136-50-1).

At the same time, it fertilizes the lawn.


More Drilling Set in Colombia Oilfield
In its most direct confirmation to date of a huge oilfield discovery in Colombia, the British Petroleum Company said today that it would sharply increase drilling activity this year in the Cusiana field, about 100 miles east of Bogota.
Many analysts say the Cusiana field holds more than three billion barrels of recoverable crude, which would make it the largest discovery in the Western Hemisphere since Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, with 10 billion barrels, was recorded in 1968.


The Talk of Hollywood; 'Europa' Surfaces In Oscar Angling
As Academy Award fever seizes this town, the angriest and most emotional controversy is not over Oliver Stone's "J. F. K," but instead over a foreign film called "Europa, Europa." And the ramifications reach far beyond Hollywood.
The startling and highly acclaimed movie is based on the autobiography of Solomon Perel, now 65 years old and living in Israel, who survived World War II by hiding his Jewish identity in Poland, slipping into the German Army invading Russia and finally attending an elite school for Hitler's youth.
Terrified of being revealed as a Jew, the boy encounters, on a nightmare journey that is sometimes darkly funny, a German Army officer and a woman who learn his identity but protect him.

Florio Sees Jobs in $418 Million Bond Measure
Gov.
Jim Florio signed legislation today authorizing the state to issue $418 million in bonds to revise the debt of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, to build a new convention center in Atlantic City and to expand Rutgers University's football stadium.
"This bill is about jobs and it's about investing in our state's future," Mr.
Florio said.


Market Place; Making a Case For U S Sprint
IF MCI is David to A.T.&amp;T.'s Goliath, then U S Sprint is David's smaller brother.
As 1991 ended, Robert B. Morris of Goldman, Sachs estimates, U S Sprint had 9.8 percent of the market for long-distance calls, based on minutes of use, up slightly from 9.5 percent the year before.
That is about half of MCI's 19 percent, which was up from the 18.4 percent a year earlier.
He estimates A.T.&amp;T. had 67 percent, down from 68.2 percent in 1990.


By Design; For Hiking Cement Trails
These boots were made for hiking in the country, but this winter they have become a big-city hit.
Usually with uppers of brown waterproof leather or suede, and made with sturdy corrugated soles, they lace snugly up to just above the ankle.
The boots give a new proportion to above-the-knee swingy coats or thick tights, leggings or trim-line stirrup pants.
They can be worn with an extra pair of socks poking out over the top, but they look most elegant when the pants or other leg coverings tuck cleanly into them.

It May Be Elusive but Moth With 15-Inch Tongue Should Be Out There
IT may never have been seen by human eyes, and it certainly has never been described in the scientific literature, but somewhere in the dense tropical highlands of Madagascar there must flutter a moth with a tongue that measures 15 inches in length, a scientist says.
Speaking recently at an entomology meeting in Reno, Nev., Dr.
Gene Kritsky of the College of Mount St.
Joseph in Ohio said that there was no alternative but to posit the existence of a giant moth with a six-inch wingspan and a longer proboscis than any yet seen on an insect.
He made his prediction based on the existence of a rare orchid in Madagascar, a flower that could only be pollinated by a moth able to stick its tongue way down a tube where a pool of tempting nectar is hidden.


Chess
The recession is having its effect on Swiss-system open tournaments in the United States.
Entries are down, and since entry fees are almost always the source of financing for this type of competition, so are the prizes.
The American Open at the Marriott LAX Hotel in Los Angeles at Thanksgiving was typical: only 320 players turned out when 500 were needed to sustain the hoped-for prize list.
Thus, the winner, Joel Benjamin, was awarded $1,800 instead of the intended $3,000.
Benjamin, a New York grandmaster, had scored 7-1 in the eight-round event to finish a half-point ahead of the grandmaster Patrick Wolff and the international master Douglas Root, who tied for second place.


Help in Making a Point
MANY people would like to prepare an occasional business presentation, perhaps a series of color slides or overhead transparencies, without learning the ins and outs of one of the leading graphics programs.
Harvard Graphics and Freelance Graphics, the feature-packed and expensive leaders, may be just too powerful for someone who does a handful of presentations a year, or whose responsibilities rule out spending much time on them.
Express Presenter, from Power Up Software of San Mateo, Calif., is meant to fill that person's needs.
Type in the data, and it makes the charts in a consistent style that gives the presentation a professional, planned look.
The difference is that the planning is largely built into the program, and the user will remember how to make another presentation a month or two later.


Prisoner Exchange Expected Soon Between Israel and Muslim Groups
Efforts by the United Nations to arrange an exchange of prisoners between Israel and Shiite Muslim factions in Lebanon have made significant headway and a trade could soon take place, Shiite informants and reports published here today said.

And an Israeli spokesman reiterated that his Government was willing to free all the Lebanese prisoners it was holding in return for its own men or their remains.

Ex-Backer of Yeltsin Now Attacks Him
With the harsh fact of price rises sinking in across the nation, the Speaker of the Russian Parliament called today for the resignation of the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin for having enacted "uncontrolled, anarchic" economic reforms.
The call by the Speaker, Ruslan Khasbulatov, was quickly rejected by a spokesman for the Russian Government, which denied as well that Mr.
Yeltsin might resign his second job as Prime Minister in reaction to the growing political protest over price rises.
Mr.
Khasbulatov is a popular politician who had made it clear lately that he was breaking away from Mr.
Yeltsin.

Senate Sends Florio Welfare Bill That Limits Benefits for Mothers
The New Jersey Senate approved and sent to the Governor tonight a package of welfare revisions that would cut off additional benefits to welfare mothers who have more children and cut or eliminate payments to those who refuse to train for work or go to school.
Gov.
Jim Florio is said to favor the basic intent of the legislation, to reduce welfare dependency, but he has not said whether he will sign it.
If he does, and the Federal Government approves, New Jersey will become the first state in the nation to ban welfare benefits for additional children.
At least two other states are considering such a policy.
Strong Opposition
Even with Governor Florio's signature, the sweeping welfare revision, which contains incentives as well as punitive measures, cannot take effect without waivers of some Federal regulations.
Among the provisions that would require waivers are the end of benefits for additional children born to welfare mothers and modifications in grant formulas for married couples or women who marry while in the welfare program.


Debate on Buildings: To Scrub Or Not
FOR the next three to five years, the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials in Washington, those soaring marble arias to democracy and inspiration for thousands of tourists each week, will be partly obscured by decidedly unpoetic girdles of scaffolding, fences and thick green nets, as workers struggle to shore up the crumbling monuments and restore a bit of their dimming grandeur.
The monuments are suffering, not so much because they have been battered by grit, grime and acid rain or even because pigeons shamelessly roost on the heads of the Presidential statues within, but because in the half century since the monuments were built they have been kept so meticulously clean.
To help assure the appearance of unsullied timelessness at the monuments, the National Park Service hoses down the entire structures twice a year and swabs off the Lincoln statue with detergent and water every other day.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Labor; Big Labor Seeks Ways to Regain Campaign Clout
The major labor unions, seeking to recapture some of the influence they lost in the Presidential elections of the 1980's, are avoiding endorsements in the primaries and telling their state and local affiliates to pick their own candidates.
The unions, which have historically supported Democrats, are important not only because they influence members' votes, but also because they can deliver organizational help to their favored candidates: telephone banks, voter registration drives and campaign mailings.

2d Wall St. Agency Downgrades Bond Rating for New York State
Going beyond the censure issued last week by another Wall Street credit monitor, Standard &amp; Poor's today lowered its rating on a wide range of New York State securities, including the bonds regarded as the state's safest investment.
The downgrading will force a state that is struggling to close multibillion-dollar budget gaps to pay millions of dollars in additional interest costs on the sale of new bonds.
Just as damaging, it may also affect the creditworthiness of bonds sold by dozens of school districts from East Islip to Niagara Falls.


Review/Dance; Designs in Space Turning Into Embraces
Although the Peter Pucci Plus Dancers kept reveling in bright ideas on Saturday night at the Joyce Theater, the program -- an attraction of the Altogether Different series -- was most satisfying when Mr.

Mr.
Pucci was particularly eloquent in his new "Love Duets," a work performed in silence by all four members of the troupe: Miguel Aviles, Maureen Mansfield, Ellen Sirot and Mr.
Pucci.
They kept pairing off for choreographically similar duets in which, when the dancers were apart, their poses were impressive for their sculptural beauty.
But as they drew near, their designs in space turned into embraces.


Officer Hurt In a Shooting In Brooklyn
A police officer responding to a landlord-tenant dispute was shot in the head and critically wounded at a house in Brooklyn last night by an enraged tenant who holed up in his attic apartment.
The gunman held off a cordon of police firepower for more than two hours, the police said, then shot himself to death.
Shortly after the 33-year-old officer was shot just above the left eye at 6:45 P.M., police cars swarmed into the Bath Beach neighborhood and heavily armed officers surrounded the house at 181 Bay 31st Street, between Cropsey and Bath Avenues.
The wounded officer was then pulled out and taken to a hospital.

Alberta's Chief Fans Language Fight
Officials in Ottawa are sensitive to the language struggles that have been almost a constant since the British victory over the French at Quebec in 1759.
So in its latest proposal for a new constitutional arrangement to keep Quebec in Canada, Ottawa has put forward a plan that deals with other strains within the confederation but leaves existing language rights untouched.
But if many of the country's politicians seemed prepared to set the issue aside this time, they had not counted on Premier Donald Getty of Alberta.
Mr.
Getty, facing restiveness among Alberta's mainly English-speaking voters, made a speech in Edmonton last week describing official bilingualism -- the policy guaranteeing the equality of English and French as languages of the federal Government -- as one of the "irritants" vexing Canadians and urging that laws enforcing it be scrapped.

Treasuries Down 3d Day in a Row
Prices of intermediate- to long-term Treasury securities posted big declines yesterday in moderately active trading.
Traders attributed the downturn, the market's third in a row, partly to a continued reaction to Friday's Congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan.
And new rumors that the Treasury intends to pare the size of its quarterly bond auctions and make up the difference by selling seven-year and ten-year notes on a monthly basis battered prices of all long-term issues.


Big Bank Set To Increase Divestitures
The BankAmerica Corporation, bowing to antitrust concerns expressed by state and Federal regulators, said today that it would sharply increase the amount of deposits to be divested after it completes its proposed acquisition of the Security Pacific Corporation.
The San Francisco banking giant says it will sell branches with $7 billion of deposits in communities where the combined operations of BankAmerica and Security Pacific would have a market share so large as to be a potential limit to competition.
Until now, the bank had been proposing to divest $4 billion of deposits.
BankAmerica said the revised divestiture plan would not alter the terms of the acquisition.

Review/Television; 'Today' Celebrates Itself, at Night Yet
The 40th anniversary of NBC's "Today" show warrants acknowledgement.
The mix of news, interviews, chatter and stunts first seen at 7 A.M. on Jan. 14, 1952, was the prototype for what soon became an American institution.
The format was adjusted over the years, especially after ABC and CBS entered the flakes stakes, but "Today" was the first and for a long time the most popular breakfast show in the land.
It is not too grand a claim to say that it changed the way families got through the morning.
"Today at 40," the birthday party at 10 tonight on NBC, should tickle nostalgics as it briskly recalls the early black-and-white shows, presided over by Dave Garroway with the help of the talented chimpanzee J. Fred Muggs.
These shows were much more spontaneous, not to say erratic, than the elaborate productions that followed, but the pictures here of early risers watching in diners, barns and factories as well as in kitchens confirm the program's continuing appeal.

Gunmen Seize Van and Hold Up a Bank
Four armed men hijacked a telephone company van in Brooklyn yesterday, drove to Queens and, posing as telephone repairmen, stole more than $100,000 from a bank in Rosedale, the police said.

They then drove to the Home Federal Savings Bank, at 145-15 243d Street in Queens, and entered wearing phone company work belts.

You don't have to tell Ralph Wilson that winning the Super Bowl is a neat trick.
He is the owner of the Buffalo Bills, and he saw them lose to the New York Giants last January by one point.
Now the Bills are back for a second attempt. and people are telling Wilson that Buffalo figures to lose this time to the Washington Redskins by 6.
But in a world of frequently forbidding odds, Ralph Wilson reaches for the stars with the best of them.
He not only was the architect of the Bills but also was the breeder of the race horse Arazi, who already ranks as the favorite to win the Kentucky Derby, three months after the Bills try to upset the odds in the Super Bowl.
So, Wilson is standing on the brink of distinction in both sports.

What Algeria chose is not Islam, but a fanatic and authoritarian strain in the Islamic world that thrives on the failure of the secular governing elites and the unfair treatment meted out to the Muslim world by the West.

Nonstate Plants in China at Risk in U.S. Talks

The workers, mostly young women hunched over assembly lines, earn about $74 a month -- dazzling salaries in China -- and the ethos here is capitalism rather than Communism.
The factory is financed by Taiwan, which lies just across the Taiwan Strait from this city in Fujian Province, and there are no political study classes as there are in most Chinese companies.

Neediest Cases Helps Wage Depression War
Roberta Newman clearly remembers her first step on the road to recovery from major depression: It was on an early morning in July 1990, when her oldest son arrived at her doorstep with two orderlies from New York Hospital.
"He asked me to sign myself in voluntarily or they would carry me in," she said.
"I said O.K."
Today, with the help of the Westchester Jewish Community Services and The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Ms.
Newman, who likes to be called Bobbie, is receiving treatment and therapy that has helped turn her life around.


4th-Quarter Loss Seen By Citicorp
Citicorp, at the midpoint of a two-year plan to restore its financial equilibrium, said yesterday that it would report a loss of $125 million to $150 million for the fourth quarter of 1991, mostly because of bad real estate loans, but would earn a profit this year.
There is little Citicorp can do immediately to cure its problems with bad loans, but the company said it was making good progress in reducing expenses in its far-flung network of corporate and consumer banking businesses.

McDaniel's Decision Won't Be a Surprise to Knicks
They got him to fill a position that has been spiritually vacant since Bernard King blew out a knee.
They got him to take a scoring load off Patrick Ewing, to give themselves another go-to guy down the stretch of a close game.
"We did not trade for X to have him go to another team," the Knicks' president, David Checketts, said yesterday of Xavier McDaniel.


Johnson Is Determined To Play in Olympics
MAGIC JOHNSON reiterated yesterday that he intends to play for the United States Olympic team at the Barcelona Games this summer.
Johnson was picked for the team before he announced on Nov. 7 that he had tested positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and retired from the Los Angeles Lakers.


Books of The Times; Through a Microscope, the Customs of the Rich
FALSE GODS By Louis Auchincloss 214 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $21.


The Excuse Maker
Why, it's all Japan's fault, barks Chrysler's chairman, Lee Iacocca.
Fresh from President Bush's dismal trip to Tokyo, he insists that "We do not have idiots running General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, or our suppliers. And our workers are not lazy and stupid." Detroit has declined, he says, because of unfair Japanese trade practices and "insidious Japanese economic and political power within the United States."
These accusations are worse than wrong.
They're reckless.
For someone so well known to make them is to incite chauvinism, even xenophobia.
Something
is
wrong in Detroit, and for Mr.
Iacocca to blast Japan is to dodge his, and his industry's, shortcomings.


City of Lost Illusions
Stunned by three murders on two Sunday mornings in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, Leonid M. Ruben yesterday glumly compared Brooklyn with its violence to the Ukraine he left behind and found himself almost longing for a Soviet-style strong hand.
"America with these problems is like there. It's bad there and it's bad here," the 76-year-old emigre said in Russian, as he sought help from a block association to read a notice in English about food stamps.
"You need death to answer death."


Market Place; Making a Case For U S Sprint
IF MCI is David to A.T.&amp;T.'s Goliath, then U S Sprint is David's smaller brother.
As 1991 ended, Robert B. Morris of Goldman, Sachs estimates, U S Sprint had 9.8 percent of the market for long-distance calls, based on minutes of use, up slightly from 9.5 percent the year before.
That is about half of MCI's 19 percent, which was up from the 18.4 percent a year earlier.
He estimates A.T.&amp;T. had 67 percent, down from 68.2 percent in 1990.


Meade Alcorn Jr., 84, G.O.P. National Chief
Hugh Meade Alcorn Jr., the Republican national chairman from 1957 to 1959 during the Eisenhower Administration, died yesterday at his home in Suffield, Conn.
He was 84 years old.
The cause of his death was a stroke, his daughter said.


Departure at Treasury
Robert R. Glauber, a senior Tresury official who was an architect of the Administration's banking and savings and loan proposals, said today that he would leave Government this week to return to teaching at Harvard University.
Mr.
Glauber, 52 years old, has been a Treasury Under Secretary since May 1989 and helped write the law to bail out hundreds of savings associations.
He also crafted the Administration's plan to reorganize the nation's banking system by lifting restrictions that limited banks' expansion across state lines and into the securities and insurance businesses.
The proposal was rejected by Congress two months ago.


U.S. Reviewing Ways to Prevent Flipping of Cars
The Federal highway safety agency has begun reviewing how to prevent thousands of the most dangerous automobile accidents, those in which a vehicle tumbles out of control and rolls over.
The review could lead to mandatory design changes in many small cars, pickup trucks and sporty off-road vehicles.
Depending on what changes are required, prices of these vehicles, including some of Detroit's hottest sellers in recent years, could increase by hundreds of dollars.
Some models might even be discontinued if they could not be made safer.

Edwin W. Edwards was inaugurated today for a fourth term as Louisiana Governor, but doubts remained about whether he had turned over the new leaf he promised during the bitter campaign against David Duke last fall.

The General Motors Corporation has hired consultants to determine the value of its Allison Transmission division, which produces automatic transmissions for trucks, Allison's general manager, Robert Clark, said.
"Our boss, Bob Stempel, told the whole world that General Motors would divest itself of its non-core businesses," Mr.
Clark noted.
"And you don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to know we're not part of the core business of making automobiles."


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week; If Clinton Leads Pack, Teeth Are at His Heels
If the buzz inside the Capital Beltway can be believed, the Democrats may well have a candidate before they ever have a real campaign.
Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, by virtue of his early strength in organizing and fund raising, not to mention message-making and pundit-stroking, has become the hot candidate of the post-Cuomo period.
Some of the more cautious Democrats note that at this point in 1984, Walter F. Mondale was a much more prohibitive front-runner and former Senator Gary Hart barely showed a pulse, yet Mr.
Hart proceeded to win New Hampshire and nearly destroy Mr.
Mondale's campaign.

Pirates Freeze at Line And Lose in Overtime
Villanova won the battle at the free-throw line tonight at Byrne Meadowlands Arena and went on to upset Seton Hall, 73-68, in overtime.
The Pirates shot poorly all evening, connecting on just 19 of 37 free-throw attempts and 23 of 61 field-goal attempts.
Nevertheless, Seton Hall led by 11 points after Terry Dehere made a pair of free throws with 2 minutes 20 seconds left in the game.


Central Park Bandshell Has Become Irrelevant
To the Editor:
The Naumburg Bandshell in New York City's Central Park has seen its day (news article, Dec. 20).
It was designed for the band concerts popular in the 1920's and 30's.
Its heavy shell-like shape reflected and amplified their rich tones.
Now we have other musical groups playing at more spacious park sites, using a portable stage and electronic amplification.
The bandshell has become irrelevant and intrusive.
In its time, it gave audiences much pleasure and wonderful memories.
But now it is outmoded and in the way for recreational and landscaping purposes.

Shearson executives said yesterday that Mitchell Meisler, head of over-the-counter sales and marketing, and Michael Dobin, the department's chief operations official, had been told to "go on vacation," with pay, until the firm could determine their status.
No Formal Accusations
One Shearson official said the suspensions were related to poor work performance, not any violation of policy.

Algeria: Democracy Betrayed
Algeria's army did its best on Saturday to destroy democracy in the name of saving it, forcibly intervening to interrupt an election that an Islamic fundamentalist party appeared certain to win.
Western Governments, the Bush Administration included, have been shamefully reluctant to condemn an illegitimate and unwise move sure to heighten political tension.
The Islamic Salvation Front, cheated of the decisive electoral triumph its strong first round showing seemed to assure, has now called on Algerians to rise up and defy the army's decrees.


Mets Find a Place for Harrelson as a Scout
When the Mets dismissed a beleaguered Bud Harrelson as manager last September, the organization termed it an act of basic decency.
Yesterday, the Mets named Harrelson a special scout, and the club described it as an act of basic intelligence.
"I don't believe you can ever have enough quality people," Al Harazin, the general manager, said in a statement announcing Harrelson's appointment.

Argentine Homosexual Gets Refugee Status in Canada
For the first time in Canada, a homosexual fearing persecution in his homeland because of sexual preference has been granted refugee status, under a Government decision that could have broad ramifications in North America.
The case, involving a 28-year-old Argentine named Jorge Alberto Inaudi, was decided by a panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board, an independent, quasi-judicial agency under the Minister of Immigration.
Its rulings are usually final, although they can be appealed to federal courts.

He says his Swedish is better than his Chinese.
Actually, he speaks neither.
What the playwright meant was that, unlike his experience in Beijing, he will be dealing mostly with people who can speak English.


Afghan Musician Heals Wounds of Exile
He is tall, balding and scholarly looking and his name, Nashenas, means "unknown" in Persian.
But on Saturday night, when Nashenas gave his second major public concert of his 40-year singing career and his first in New York, the 2,000 Afghans and Pakistanis in the audience knew exactly what his presence meant.
Men sat ramrod-straight and cried silently.
Despite the heavy security in the Queens College auditorium in Flushing, others tried to dance in the aisles.
The crowd roared approval and screamed out song requests.
Video cameras and tape recorders were neatly camouflaged under coats.

City officials warned today that industry was coming to a standstill throughout the Russian capital as the national economy unraveled and raw materials were no longer being supplied from the other republics.
Most industrial enterprises have supplies for only two or three more weeks of work while the makers of the city's prefabricated concrete housing may stop work in the next five or six days, according to Boris Nikolsky, first deputy premier of the Moscow city government.

Chile in Quandary Over Protecting Honecker
Erich Honecker, the former East German Communist leader, is now in his second month holed up in the Chilean Embassy in Moscow.
But his desire for protection from German prosecutors has touched off an intense debate here and has raised concerns for Chile's relations with Germany, perhaps its closest ally in the industrialized world.
"This is a major problem for the President," said Juan Enrique Vega, assistant director of the Legislative Assistance Program, a research center closely associated with President Patricio Aylwin's Christian Democratic Party.
"He has some of his most senior ministers saying we should give Honecker asylum. And I think so far Aylwin has vacillated."


Cuomo Attacked on Pay Offered for Health Chief
Republican senators used a confirmation hearing today to mount an angry attack on Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo for circumventing the Legislature in offering his nominee for state health commissioner a salary of $160,000 a year, the highest ever offered a commissioner.
Dr.
Mark R. Chassin, a California businessman, health researcher and emergency-room physician, spent nearly 45 minutes before the Senate Health Committee fielding questions about the appropriateness of his proposed salary.
Only after the committee's Republican members made their case on the salary issue did they ask Dr.
Chassin for his views on the state's health policy.

"Accepting the Harsh Truth of a Blue-Collar Recession" (front page, Dec. 25), on the loss of more than one million blue-collar jobs in the current recession, correctly points out that not all of those jobs will return after the recession is over.
While some have been lost because of increased efficiency, many are non- and low-skill manufacturing jobs.
Where have those jobs gone?

COLUMBIA GAS SYSTEM INC. has had its share of problems.

Even in yesterday's market surge, it lost 25 cents, to $16.50.
Still, some analysts say that the company is fundamentally sound and that once its problems are worked out, the stock price will rise.

New York (22-11) won its second consective game and snapped a losing streak in Orlando Arena at two games, defeating the Magic, 115-111.


Review/Dance; Men in the Forefront In City Ballet Cast Shifts
Debuts and cast changes are already studding the New York City Ballet's current repertory season.
Interestingly, all the dancers stepping into new roles over the weekend were men.
On Sunday afternoon at the New York State Theater, Peter Boal was seen as the lone man in the feminine world of George Balanchine's "Raymonda Variations." Inspired by Marius Petipa's 1898 "Raymonda," Balanchine used excerpts from Glazunov's ballet score (conducted here with fine verve by Maurice Kaplow) to hark back to the Russian classical tradition of his boyhood.
The purity of Mr.
Boal's classical style made him, as might be expected, a natural for Balanchine's reworking of Petipa.
In his first solo, Mr.
Boal offered a contrast between the sharpness of his larger leaps and the cascade of small leg beats, especially those known as brises voles.
A greater, even brasher assertiveness would compensate for the throwaway modesty that crept into this variation.
In his second solo, however, Mr.
Boal picked up markedly, ending his turns with a flourish.

Vehicle Sales, Weak in '91, Keep Falling
Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks remained at recessionary levels in early January, declining 4.1 percent from a dismal period a year earlier, the auto makers reported today.
The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for the period was 5.3 million -- among the lowest figures reported in 1991 -- reinforcing a bleak outlook for the industry.


Personal Health
MAGNESIUM, an essential mineral in the human diet, has been all but ignored by nutrition enthusiasts who tout an alphabet-soup of supplements to correct purported deficiencies, to counter various ailments and to enhance overall health.
Unlike calcium, which few Americans get enough of to sustain healthy bones throughout life, or selenium, which may help to prevent cancer, magnesium was not considered to play a major role in nutritional problems nor was it regarded as a "sexy" nutrient.
But recent research may soon change magnesium's image and thrust it into the nutritional limelight.
The findings indicate that magnesium deficiencies can play an important role in several major health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, as well as some less-threatening problems like premenstrual disturbances and chronic fatigue syndrome.


Man Charged in Prostitute Slayings in California
A county worker paroled after serving nearly 10 years in prison for killing his infant daughter was charged today with the murder of two women, the police announced in the first major break in the serial slayings of 19 prostitutes.

On Teaching History When It Changes Every Day
With the sudden collapse of Soviet Communism and the union of states that practiced it for more than 70 years, teachers in the United States find that the ever-shifting face of that part of the world has brought new opportunities and challenges to the classroom.
"It's great when a history lesson becomes so closely related to what is happening now," said Ruth Wattenberg, coordinator for the Education for Democracy Project, a partnership of the American Federation of Teachers, Freedom House and the Educational Excellence Network.
The project was formed last spring to help teachers understand and convey information about the major changes that have swept through Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania in the last few years.


Boston's New Mayor Faces Painful Task on Police Chief
Raymond L. Flynn, one of the most popular mayors in the city's history, was placed in an agonizing position today when a special panel advised him against retaining the police commissioner, who is a boyhood friend of the Mayor and one of his closest associates.
The special commission, which was appointed by the Mayor himself to look into Police Department procedures, recommended that the commissioner, Francis M. Roache, be replaced when his term expires in April.
The panel also sharply criticized the handling of civilian complaints by the police.


Musical America Ceases Publication
Musical America, the oldest magazine in the United States devoted to classical music, ceased publication yesterday, just hours after its annual awards party.
The January-February issue is to be the bimonthly magazine's last.
Gerry M. Ritterman, the magazine's owner, said yesterday that Musical America had lost $700,000 in 1991, and that he decided to close it when he realized that advertising income was not likely to pick up this year.
Mr.
Ritterman said that the annual Musical America International Directory of the Performing Arts would continue to be published.

Conner Starts Off By Losing
Today was just the first day of the 1992 America's Cup defense trials, but there has already been a startling turn of events: Dennis Conner, the kingpin of America's Cup racing, looked down the stern of another boat for virtually an entire race.
Conner's yacht, Stars &amp; Stripes, lost to Defiant, skippered by Buddy Melges, by 1 minute 34 seconds.
And although Conner, the defending America's Cup champion skipper, has plenty of time to turn the tide, given a trials schedule spread over the next three months, William Koch's America 3 syndicate had reason for jubilation this afternoon.

Children Learn to Share With Gifts to Neediest
Every Friday the 17 members of the Bunny Rabbit class at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan drop coins into the tzedakah box.
Understanding the meaning of tzedakah, the Hebrew word for charity, is part of the 4- and 5-year-olds' curriculum, said Lenore Memeth, a teacher at the nursery school.
A letter attached to a $10 contribution to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund suggests that the youngsters have learned their lesson well.
"We put coins in it as a way of saying thank you for what we have and sharing it with others," they wrote in a class letter.


CUOMO SEEKS DELAY IN 5-YEAR PROGRAM FOR TRANSIT FUNDS
Faced with chronic budget problems, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo has decided that New York State cannot now afford to commit itself to pay for another five-year program to overhaul subways, buses and commuter rail lines, his aides said yesterday.
The decision signaled a major change in the approach to upgrading mass transit, with the Governor withdrawing the state's commitment, maintained over all of the last decade, to finance long-term capital plans to buy subway cars and buses, rebuild tracks, fix signals and improve all the elements of mass transit.

But while the N.F.L. isn't kicking up its heels this year, it has brought football back to the game.

UConn Defeats Pittsburgh
Chris Smith, Connecticut's basketball treasure, once again showed the Huskies the way tonight.
Whenever Pittsburgh closed in on UConn during a turbulent second half at the Civic Center, the cool senior guard found the right shot, made the right pass.
He was the game's scoring leader with 28 points and its catalyst in an 87-77 Big East victory for Connecticut that was closer than that.
The defeat was the first for the Panthers in conference play, the fifth in 16 games.
The triumph was Connecticut's 12th in 13 games, its third in four conference contests.


DEMOCRATS BEGIN HEALTH OFFENSIVE
House Democrats held meetings with their constituents at 285 sites around the country today to publicize their proposals for sweeping changes in medical insurance and to underscore what they describe as a slow response from President Bush.
The events highlighted the emergence of health care as a potent Presidential campaign issue, one that Democrats say they are well-positioned to exploit.
In his State of the Union Message on Jan. 28, Mr.
Bush is expected to propose new tax incentives to extend private health insurance.
But Democratic strategists contend voters will not be satisfied until the Government controls escalating medical costs and expands coverage to the unemployed and all women and children.

Eating Well
One child who was asked to describe cholesterol said, "It's a condition that makes you eat salad."
When Benjamin Kessler, 6 years old, was asked by his father, Dr.
David A. Kessler, the Commissioner of the Federal Food and Drug Administration, to define fat, he said, "Fat is fat." The Commissioner's 9-year-old daughter, Elise, added that children could eat fat but should cut down on it by the time they are 12.


Detroit's Real Competitors Are Ohio, Illinois . . .
Ford, G.M. and Chrysler would have us believe that their main problem is lack of access to the Japanese market.
As last week's debacle in Japan helped demonstrate, no one seriously believes that the Big Three can sell more than a handful of cars there under any rules.
Even Honda has to scramble to hold on to a 10 percent market share in Japan.
The real problem is that the Big Three can't compete in the U.S. against cars produced by Japanese-owned plants in Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.
These plants sprang up in part because of quotas on Japanese imports that the Big Three requested in the early 1980's.


Car Rentals Hide Welcome Mat
In a market too competitive to permit higher rates or an easy increase in market share, two car rental companies have been driven to extremes in trying to improve profitability: turning away the customers most likely to cost them money.
Alamo Rent a Car Inc. says people who rent cars in their hometowns have a far higher rate of accidents and loss than those who rent while traveling.
That is because business customers on the road are generally safer, and because people who rent a car with the intention of selling it or sub-renting it for profit usually do so locally.

Wounded Police Officer Was Symbol of Department's New Approach
The officer who was shot in a Brooklyn home Monday night was a literal symbol of the new way the New York City Police Department is trying to fight crime, a "poster boy" chosen for an advertisement promoting community policing.
But Officer Richard DeGaetano was critically wounded while responding to the old-fashioned type of dangerous situation that police officers have always faced.
And after a second operation yesterday at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, surgeons said the 33-year-old officer's chances of survival were good, but that he would probably lose an eye.

After three weeks of negotiations, the Government of El Salvador and rebel leaders agreed early today on the final details of an accord to end the 12-year civil war.

IRAQ ADMITS BUYING GERMAN MATERIALS TO MAKE A-BOMBS
In a new disclosure about President Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons program, Iraq has admitted buying large quantities of German components for a previously unknown uranium enrichment complex that could have produced enough explosive for four or five weapons a year, officials said today.
The admission was made in Baghdad on Monday to a team of United Nations nuclear inspectors assembled by the International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, the United Nations officials said.
The inspectors had flown to Baghdad on Saturday after learning that German companies had sold Mr.
Hussein some of the parts needed to build up to 10,000 uranium gas centrifuge enrichment plants and after receiving a tip-off about where those parts might be concealed.
Special Magnets
The United Nations team drew a blank when they raided the suspected site just north of the Baghdad area on Sunday, officials say.
But Iraqi nuclear officials later admitted under questioning, the team reported, that they had bought enough special magnets and housings from German companies before the Persian Gulf war to build up to 10,000 centrifuges, although they asserted that these were all destroyed immediately after the cease-fire.

Swindon Journal; In Tory Bastion, Discontent Grows
In the 1980's this aging, blue-collar town emerged as one of Britain's fastest growing cities, a booming outpost of high-tech industry, modern British enterprise and nascent Conservative political sympathies.
The sudden rush of white-collar workers to the county of Wiltshire, west of London, not only stretched the population to more than 175,000, but also helped give a new shape to a political landscape long dominated by the Labor Party.
In 1983 voters sent a Conservative to Parliament for only the second time since World War II.
Four years later they returned him to office, with a slightly larger margin.


Juilliard School to Receive A $10 Million Endowment

Mrs.
Diamond, who is 81 years old, gave the school the first $5 million on Monday.
The other $5 million is to be left to Juilliard in her will.


Where Blame Lies in the City College Tragedy
To the Editor:
The City College crowd disaster is no mystery from the traffic engineering viewpoint.
A single door has a movement capacity of 60 people per minute under normal circumstances.
If tickets are checked at the door, or "stop and frisk" procedures are used, the capacity is much less.
A 12-foot-wide stair has a movement capacity of 240 people per minute in the down direction.
Simple arithmetic shows that critical crowding can occur quickly at a single door under these conditions.
Inadequate door capacity has caused loss of life in many crowd incidents and fire emergencies.

GAINS SEEN IN FIGHT TO CUT DRUG TRADE
Marking moderate progress in the fight against drugs, security forces in Central and South America seized 143 tons of cocaine in 1991, about 15 percent of world production, the region's top American military official says.

George A. Joulwan of the Army, said in an interview here on Friday.

Advertising and promotional spending by the nation's cigarette makers rose 10 percent in 1989 from 1988, to $3.6 billion, the Federal Trade Commission reported, as domestic sales dropped 6.3 percent.
For each carton of cigarettes sold in 1989, the latest year for which figures were available, tobacco companies spent an average of $1.37 on ads and promotions, which the commission said was more than double the amount spent in 1980, about 58 cents a carton, when adjusted for inflation.


China's Premier Plans Visit to United Nations
Prime Minister Li Peng is scheduled to visit the United Nations in New York at the end of this month, Western diplomats and the official New China News Agency said today.

Mr.

U.S. Told to Ban Tuna Imports to Protect Dolphins
A Federal judge has ruled that the Commerce Department must ban much of the nation's tuna imports to protect dolphins, a move that could result in higher canned tuna prices for American consumers.
The ban will cover $266 million worth of imports from about 30 countries, or slightly more than half of the 266,000 metric tons of tuna imported each year by the United States, Roddy Moscoso, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, said today.
The ban applies only to imports that include yellowfin tuna, sold as "chunk light tuna" in grocery stores.


City College Is Said to Miss Danger Signs
City College officials responsible for the celebrity basketball game at which nine people were killed should have known from a similar event the week before that the game would feature rap stars and draw a large crowd, but the officials nevertheless failed to take sufficient precautions, a report by a City University investigator has concluded.
City College officials have said that for several years now they have had an informal policy prohibiting rap performers in campus events because of a fear that college security guards would be overwhelmed by large crowds.

All Is Scarce in Trenton Except Republicans
A jubilant Republican majority took control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature today, bent on undoing much of what Gov.
Jim Florio and the Democrats accomplished over the last two years, including cutting at least part of their $2.8-billion tax increase.
But behind the Republican euphoria lies a sobering fiscal reality: The new Legislature will probably have to find about $2 billion in new money just to keep the budget at this year's level, and the problem could get much worse.
The bleak fiscal outlook emerges from three factors: The economy is stagnant or declining, and the prospects for an upturn are bleak; politically, the Republicans are locked into a tax cut of at least $590 million, and $550 million in "one-shot" revenues that were in this year's budget won't be available again next year.

U.S. Underestimated Soviet Force In Cuba During '62 Missile Crisis
The Soviet Union had 43,000 troops in Cuba during the 1962 missile crisis, not 10,000 as reported by the Central Intelligence Agency, Robert S. McNamara said today upon returning from Havana and the final meeting of an American-Russian-Cuban series of conferences on the crisis.
Mr.
McNamara, who was Secretary of Defense from 1961 to 1967 under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, said in an interview that Soviet officials also disclosed that they had sent Havana short-range nuclear weapons and that Soviet commanders there were authorized to use them in the event of an American invasion.
The initial report appeared today in The Washington Post.
The short-range nuclear weapons were in addition to medium-range nuclear weapons that would have required authorization from Moscow to use.


DIALOGUE: Should Congress Investigate the 'October Surprise'?; Don't Waste Time On This Wild Tale
For 10 years, arms smugglers, convicted felons, frauds and fugitives from justice have unsuccessfully peddled allegations of a so-called October surprise to the Iran-contra independent counsel, Iran-contra Congressional investigating committees, Senate Intelligence Committee and the public.
After hearing detailed testimony from Gary Sick, the Senate properly rejected a bill to spend $600,000 to pursue charges that he is now selling in a book.
Some will argue an investigation should be conducted just to lay the issue to rest.
But what would a new investigation do, on top of the ones already undertaken?
There will always be one more conspiracy-minded partisan who will come up with another titillating date, detail or account of events, particularly in an election year.


The Surge In Stocks Resumes
After a two-day breather, stock prices resumed their advance with feeling yesterday, with many indexes again bounding to new highs.
In heavy trading, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had set 8 records in the previous 12 trading days, repeated the feat, rising 60.60 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 3,246.20.
A chief factor cited by analysts for the market's surge was the weak retail sales report for December, which was disturbing but not unexpected.
The reason such bad news appeared to please investors is that it raised hopes of yet another move by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which in the long run could help to lift corporate earnings.

Ugly Ideas, and Democracy
Bradley Smith is a Californian who acknowledges that the Nazis were cruel to Jews but who denies that the Holocaust ever happened.
He has tried to expound his views in a 4,000-word essay submitted as an advertisement to several college newspapers -- giving headaches and heartaches to student editors.
In the process he gives the public some valuable, if unintended, lessons in the workings of a free press.
Many readers would blanch if they came upon Mr.
Smith's pseudo-scholarly tract.
Yes, he concedes, Jews were mistreated by the Nazis, and "many tragically perished in the maelstrom." But the idea that Nazi Germany exterminated six million Jews, Mr.
Smith contends, is an irresponsible exaggeration.
Gas chambers?
A myth.
Those actually were "life-saving" fumigation shelters to delouse clothing and prevent disease.

Nation's Retail Sales Take Fall, But Investors Push Dow to High
Retail sales in 1991 were the flattest in 30 years, finishing with three straight monthly declines, the Commerce Department reported today.
But the gloomy economic news raised expectations of further cuts in interest rates, an outlook that sent the stock market to a new high.
Retail sales fell four-tenths of 1 percent in December, the Commerce Department reported, adding that what had been an advance in November had been revised to a decline.

It was only the third-best scoring effort of the night as Derek Harper and Rolando Blackman paced the Mavericks with 28 and 24 points, respectively, but Coleman's output was enough to help the Nets improve to 15-21 on the season and boost them over the .500 mark at home at 11-0.

Food Notes
Thinking Green
At this time of year when fragile lettuces and herbs are costly and in short supply, it's good to know that a wholesale company that specializes in these items for restaurants will ship relatively small quantities to retail customers.
Fines Herbes (pronounced Feen-ZAIRB) in TriBeCa offers fresh baby lettuces, frilly loose salad greens in sweet and spicy flavors plus fragrant herbs and edible flowers.
Among the items are 13 different lettuces like baby Romaine, baby red Boston and frisee that are $4.75 a half-pound (from 6 to 12 heads, depending on the variety).
Assortments of salad greens, $3.75 a quarter pound (three to four servings), include sharp mustard greens, pungent cress, spicy Asian greens like tat soi and mizuna, and mesclun containing 18 varieties of leaves.
There are 23 kinds of fresh herbs, from dill and parsley to herbs like chervil and thyme that are harder to find to exotics like epazote for Mexican cooking and lemon grass for Thai and Vietnamese dishes.
Fines Herbes also has purple opal basil, lemon thyme and long branches of rosemary to use as skewers for grilling.
The herbs are sold in one-ounce lots for $1.50 to $3, a nice sized bunch.

Chili: A Global View
"The Great Chile Book" by Mark Miller with John Harrisson (Ten Speed Press, 1991, $14.95) is a colorful directory to 90 kinds of fresh and dried chilies, both sweet and hot.
It is the most concise, comprehensive guide to chilies to appear in print.
Unlike many books that concentrate on Mexico and the Southwest, it does not ignore European, Asian and Caribbean varieties.
Each type of chili (the authors prefer the Spanish spelling) is shown in a color photograph along with a description of its size, flavor and uses.
The chilies are also rated for hotness, using Mr.
Miller's own scale of 1 to 10.
A history of chilies, some recipes and listings of chili sources are included.

GORGING FOR GOOD CAUSE
DOUGHNUTS will be consumed for a cause next Wednesday at Fisher &amp; Levy, 875 Third Avenue (52d Street).
The food shop and caterer, which began making homey cake-style doughnuts last fall, is holding a doughnut-eating contest from 7:45 to 8:45 A.M. and will contribute a dollar for every doughnut consumed to City Harvest, a charity that provides food for the homeless.

City Harvest will also receive a dollar for every doughnut sold during the day.
The doughnuts are 45 cents each, $4.95 a dozen.


ALGERIAN LEADERS FORM NEW COUNCIL

The Wheel of Fortune: 149 Seek Arbitration
Barry Bonds, a two-time loser, and Doug Drabek, a two-time winner and the recipient of the largest salary ever awarded in a hearing, were among 149 players who filed for salary arbitration yesterday, the final day of the filing period.
No one had filed previously.
Eligible players have waited, in recent years, until the final day because they then have extra time before they have to submit their salary bids.
Players and clubs will exchange figures on Friday, an act that is certain to establish records for highest salaries submitted by a player and a club.

Grievance Withdrawn
The Major League Baseball Players Association yesterday withdrew a grievance over a conflict with the Republican National Convention at the Astrodome this summer that is forcing the Houston Astros to make a four-week road trip.
The 28-day, 26-game trip is needed to give work crews enough time to prepare the Astrodome for the convention, scheduled for Aug. 17-20.
The league's agreement with the players says trips of more than 19 days will not be scheduled without the permission of the union.
Neither the league nor the Astros consulted the union before making the agreement with the Republican Party.


McDonald's Executive Named Vice Chairman
A number of McDonald's employees are fond of saying that Jack M. Greenberg spent the last 18 months "getting ketchup in his veins" -- flipping hamburgers, scooping french fries and serving up extra-thick milkshakes.
Now, having learned firsthand what it is like to be a McDonald's operator and regional supervisor, Mr.
Greenberg has been named to the second-biggest job in the company.
The McDonald's Corporation said yesterday that Mr.
Greenberg, who was chief financial officer, had been promoted to the new position of vice chairman at the company, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill.

Public &amp; Private; The Great White Myth
In a college classroom, a young white man rises and asks about the future.
What, he wants to know, can it possibly hold for him when most of the jobs, most of the good positions, most of the spots in professional schools are being given to women and, most especially, to blacks?
The temptation to be short, sarcastic, incredulous in reply is powerful.
But you have to remember that kids learn their lessons from adults.
That's what the mother of two black children who were sprayed with white paint in the Bronx said last week about the assailants, teen-agers who called her son and daughter "nigger" and vowed they would turn them white.
"Can you imagine what they are being taught at home?" she asked.


Student Drowns; 2d Is Missing
A 24-year-old Manhattan man drowned and a 19-year-old woman was missing yesterday, after their rowboat capsized in the choppy waters of Gardiners Bay, about 400 feet from shore, said the police in East Hampton, L.I.
Responding to a call from a shoreline resident at about 9:30 A.M., police and Coast Guard rescuers found the man, Jan Hecht, of 820 West End Avenue, floating beneath the 12-foot aluminum boat with his leg tangled in an anchor line.
Mr.
Hecht was taken to Southampton Hospital, where, the police said, he was pronounced dead on arrival at 1:45 P.M.

DIALOGUE: Should Congress Investigate the 'October Surprise'?; An Official Inquiry Might Crack the Case
Will we ever know what happened during the so-called October surprise in the 1980 Presidential elections?
Or is this story fated to become a permanent mystery?
Congress may soon be in a position to answer that question.
Last August, House and Senate leaders announced their intention to investigate charges that members of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980 met secretly with Iranians to manipulate the timing of the release of the 52 U.S. hostages held in Iran.
President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan said they would welcome a bipartisan investigation.

Daily News Unions Resolve Power Struggle
Leaders of nine unions representing workers at The Daily News have resolved, at least temporarily, an internal struggle that had threatened to undermine union solidarity in the effort to save the bankrupt newspaper.
George E. McDonald, head of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the union coalition, apparently turned back a challenge to his leadership from the umbrella group's three largest unions at a meeting yesterday.


Albany's Leadership Void
The experts had predicted it.
But somehow this week's downgrading of New York State's safest bonds hit like a punch in the stomach.
The downgrading will not only cost the taxpayers millions of dollars in added interest costs.
It is the loudest signal yet that New York's political leaders are intolerably ineffective in resolving the state's worsening fiscal crisis.
There is a desperate need for leadership on all sides in Albany.
Not the same old partisan politics -- not Republicans versus Democrats, or upstate versus downstate, or the cities versus the suburbs -- but broad and unselfish leadership that puts the public's well-being ahead of narrow political gain.


H.I.V.-Infected Man Accused of Sodomy In Attack on Boy, 11
An 11-year-old boy was abducted yesterday as he walked to school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, taken to a fourth-floor apartment and sodomized, the police said.
The police arrested a suspect who, they said later, was infected with the virus that causes AIDS.

Rabies and Raccoons' Sorry Image
For years people regarded raccoons as cute and furry black-masked creatures that roved by moonlight across suburbia's lawns and wooded hills.
Their greatest offense was ripping into bags of trash.
Now, as rabies outbreaks sweep the metropolitan region, raccoons have replaced pit bulls as four-legged objects of public fear.


G.O.P. Vows Change in Trenton As It Takes Over the Legislature
The 205th New Jersey Legislature convened today, ushering in a new Republican majority and tough talk from party leaders who pledged to make sweeping changes in state government.
In a direct challenge to Gov.
Jim Florio and his Democratic administration, the new Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said he intended to use the investigatory powers of Senate committees "to oversee government operations" and would not hesitate to subpoena uncooperative administration officials.

Book Notes; Kitty Kelley Draws a Bead on the Royal Family
The House of Windsor is in for what the Queen herself might call a bit of bother.
Kitty Kelley, who has written best-selling unauthorized exposes of the American royals Frank Sinatra, Nancy Reagan and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, has agreed to write a book about the British royal family, which Warner Books plans to publish in 1995.
Flush with money from the success of "Scarlett," the record-breaking best-selling sequel to "Gone With the Wind," Warner was looking for an equally dazzling book to bolster its nonfiction reputation.
When Simon &amp; Schuster, which published Ms.
Kelley's most recent book, "Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography," did not come up with as much money as the author and her agents at International Creative Management thought she deserved, Warner did.


Bias Attack Sends Police to the Bronx Seeking Help
The day after a 12-year-old Hispanic boy was punched and then smeared with white makeup in the Bronx, police officers toured the neighborhood in sound trucks asking witnesses to come forward.
At the boy's school, administrators reached out to students, who said they were starting to despair over the growing number of racial attacks.

Review/Television; Gamblers Who Face Loaded Dice
The unstartling message of tonight's report from "48 Hours" is that the compulsive gambler is a sure-fire loser.
"Gambling Fever," at 10 P.M. on Channel 2, focuses on several dire examples of the species.
Jim Howard is interviewed in a Federal prison, where he wound up in 1990 after kidnapping a neighbor's 16-year-old son in hopes that the ransom would replenish the life savings he had left in Atlantic City.
At 2:30 A.M. in a Deadwood, S.D., casino, Bernard Goldberg, one of tonight's reporters, comes on a teary 29-year-old man named Tim who has just gone through his last $350, which he raised on a bad check.
Erin Moriarty interviews a mother of four at a rehabilitation center; she managed to pour the family's savings into video keno, 5 cents at a time.

Country Music Is Hot and Television Is Serving It Up


Country Music Is Hot and Television Is Serving It Up
Call it a long overdue reaction to the noise of heavy metal or the monotony of rap.
Call it an inevitable cyclical return to the musical lure of melody and narrative.
For that matter, call it shrewd marketing.
But one thing is certain: country music is simmering again these days and television is scrambling to get into the lucrative act.
Among the more prominent current efforts are these:
*"Emmylou at the Ryman" (tonight at 8 and 11 o'clock on TNN, the Nashville Network).
Emmylou Harris and her new acoustic backup band, the Nash Ramblers, play the old Nashville auditorium that was home to the Grand Ole Opry from 1943 to 1974.
*"This Is Garth Brooks" (Friday at 9 on NBC).
The new superstar, taped at the Reunion Arena in Dallas, zestfully shows why he has sold more than 14 million albums in the last 2 years.


The Pop Life
Hall of Fame
The seventh annual Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame awards lands in town tonight at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and it's bringing lots of guitars with it.
"We've got a lineup of guitar players that's mind-blowing," said Ahmet Ertegun, a co-chairman of Atlantic Records and the chairman of the Rock-and-Roll Hall of fame.
"B. B. King, he's presenting an award to Bobby (Blue) Bland. Neil Young is expected to be there, and so will Steve Cropper, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Carlos Santana and Keith Richards. The Edge will be there, and we hope that Phil Spector will play rhythm guitar. It's going to be fun."

Favorite Son Elects to Fly With a Favorite Neighbor
To Andy Tovrea, the pilot who shuttles Senator Tom Harkin from town to town in a twin-engine puddle jumper, the Iowa Democrat is not just another customer.
And that is not because Mr.

Mr.
Tovrea grew up in the small town of Norwalk, Iowa, four miles from the even smaller town of Cumming, where Mr.
Harkin was reared.
Although the 40-year-old Mr.
Tovrea is 12 years younger than Mr.
Harkin, they both remember the early days, when politics was on no one's mind.


In a Belt-Tightening Age, a $5.2 Million Restaurant Is Born
While the rest of the United States has been battening down the hatches, Terry Peay and Mark Miller have been spending money like sailors on shore leave.
In this age of austerity, their new $5.2 million restaurant, Red Sage, stands out.
Not since Warner LeRoy opened the $10 million Potomac in the heady mid-80's has Washington seen such a fantasy.
The difference is that the LeRoy enterprise looked like fin de siecle bordello and served bordello quality food.
The Red Sage has been done with panache, and Mark Miller, considered among the country's most imaginative chefs, knows how to cook.
The restaurant opened on Monday, and it's already heavily booked.
Dinner will be about $30.

Observatory's First Findings Hold Surprises
An awesome panorama of cosmic violence, previously undetected and largely unimagined, is coming into focus with the first discoveries of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the large spacecraft that has been orbiting Earth since April.
In reports today at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, scientists described the detection of strong gamma ray emissions from such exotic celestial objects as quasars and pulsars and a veritable fireworks of gamma ray bursts apparently occurring at random, perhaps in the outermost regions of the universe.


U.N. Guards Can Help Contain Civil Conflict; Violate Sovereignty?
To the Editor:
Brian Urquhart, in "Who Can Stop Civil Wars?" (Op-Ed, Dec. 29), explores the options for an expanded role of the United Nations peacekeeping mechanism.
Although his analysis is well intentioned, the practicality of his approach and conclusion are not convincing.
Reality does not mesh well with Mr.
Urquhart's erstwhile moral suggestion.


Re-enactment Tape Is Allowed in Officer's Trial
The judge in the manslaughter trial of a white Teaneck police officer accused of killing a black teen-ager in 1990 today accepted into evidence an unusual videotaped re-enactment that indicates that the victim's arms had been raised above his head at the moment the fatal shot was fired.
The hourlong film provides the prosecution with a graphic, full-color tool to support at least three eyewitnesses who are expected to testify that the youth had his hands up when he was shot in the back.

Fitzpatrick Triumphs Over Illness and Wings
Under ordinary circumstances, it would have been fitting to dwell on how unlikely it was for the lowly Islanders to defeat the high-powered Detroit Red Wings for the second time in eight days.
But the Islanders' 6-2 victory tonight had a more compelling subplot: the first victory of the season for Mark Fitzpatrick, a goalie for the Islanders who is attempting a comeback after having endured two seasons with a rare blood disorder.

If one listed the numbers of living world champions by city, New York would be an easy winner.
In the women's division alone there are nine, and two of these were successful as teammates in the Flight A Swiss Teams at the Tri-State Regional Championships in Port Chester, N.Y., on Sunday.
One was Kitty Bethe, who was a Venice Trophy winner in Perth, Australia, in 1989, and now gives instruction at the Culbertson Club, 24 Fifth Avenue.
The other was Sue Picus, who won the same world title two years later in Yokohama, Japan, and sat South on the diagramed deal in Port Chester.


Rescue of Insurer Advances
California insurance regulators said today that they had removed one of the last hurdles to their plan to rescue the failed Executive Life Insurance Company by settling a tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.
The I.R.S. had filed a claim against Executive Life last year for $643 million in a dispute over the insurer's taxes for 1981 through 1983.
It left open the possibility that it might file further claims for subsequent years.
But John Garamendi, the California Insurance Commissioner, said at a news conference here that the I.R.S. had agreed to settle the case for $73 million and that the settlement covered all years from 1981 through 1990.

P.L.O. Ties to Lebanon Are Formally Renewed
The Palestine Liberation Organization is re-establishing formal links with the Lebanese Government, and has sent a representative to Beirut to reopen the organization's office, which has been closed since Israel invaded the country in 1982.
The P.L.O. representative, Chafik al-Hout, met with President Elias Hrawi on Monday, and said he delivered a message from Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman.
The contents were not made public, but the P.L.O. representative said it stressed the need for Palestinian-Lebanese coordination at the Middle East peace talks.
Both the Palestinians and Lebanon are taking part in face-to-face negotiations with the Israelis in Washington this week.

Under the Wing of Japan Inc., A Fledgling Enterprise Soared
As made-in-Japan stories of corporate success go, this one is a classic.
A company in a fledgling market was protected for years from competition by Japan's powerful bureaucracy.
It grew rapidly and piled up profits.
Today, it is a powerhouse, rich and entrenched, so dominant that outsiders have little chance of cracking into its lucrative bailiwick.
It is also a story that illustrates the very system that American executives, like those accompanying President Bush last week, have long complained makes Japan a closed market.
But there is a wrinkle.
The company in question is American -- Aflac Inc. of Columbus, Ga., which until very recently was named the American Family Corporation.


Corrections
A brief report by Bloomberg Business News in Business Day yesterday about Ames Department Stores Inc. referred incorrectly to the company's debt reorganization plan submitted to the United States Bankruptcy Court on Monday.

Magazine Ad Pages Off 8.7% Last Year
The Publishers Information Bureau yesterday reported the third-largest decline in total annual advertising pages for magazines since the association began tracking those figures in 1950.
The bureau, which is based in New York, said that in 1991, total pages fell 8.7 percent, to 156,650, from 171,536 in 1990.
Only in 1961 and 1958, with declines of 8.9 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively, were the declines larger.
In 1990, ad pages fell 3.7 percent from 1989.

I remember first spooning the cocoa powder into a cup from a decorative paper box with a wax paper lining, then adding some sugar and mixing the two.


U.S.-Japan Exchanges Spurred by Bush Trip
While most people were counting the automobiles and auto parts to come from President Bush's talks in Tokyo last week, some Americans and Japanese welcomed promises of increased cultural exchanges and specifically the promotion of Japanese language studies in this country.
American interest in Japanese has soared in the last five years as Japanese investment in, and trade with the United States have increased.
In 1991, though, the growth in Japanese studies leveled off, mainly because of a national shortage of good teachers and of funds, according to a Japanese official in New York.


Tests Show Graf Must Get Some Rest
Tests have shown that the skin rash that caused Steffi Graf to pull out of the Australian Open just before her first-round match is related to a nonspecific viral infection that is medically untreatable and requires at least 10 days of rest.
Graf's agent, Phil dePicciotto, said Graf underwent a series of blood tests after a dermatologist was unable to diagnose the source of a rash that began to plague her after a practice session in Melbourne, Australia.
Doctors did not say whether the virus is linked to the ear infection that precipitated Graf's withdrawal from Hopman Cup competition two weeks ago.


A.T.&amp;T. to Provide Ukraine's Phone Links
A.T.&amp; T. announced today that it would team up with the Ukrainian Government and the Dutch telephone company to build and operate a new long-distance telephone service in the newly independent republic.
The deal marks one of the first big business agreements between an American company and a former Soviet republic since the official dismemberment of the Soviet Union last month.
It is also the first time that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company will own part of a long-distance network in a foreign country.


Review/Opera; Some Friends Get Together for 'Boheme'
"La Boheme" at the Metropolitan Opera House: it is a standard event that when well stocked with stars, as Sunday night's benefit for the Pension Fund was, can command high prices and loyal attendance.
For more frequent followers of the form, pace Luciano Pavarotti, pace Mirella Freni, the evening promised business as usual, just at a slightly more fevered pitch.
Yet what emerged was something much finer.
Given all the ills suffered by opera houses from economic pressures, erratic taste, scheduling difficulties, temperaments and accidents; given the fact that singers are now around each other hardly long enough to catch a cold; given that familiarity breeds routine: given all that, the Metropolitan Opera showed for one night what it was like to present a repertory opera as if it were a company and not a house.


Polish Aircraft Workers Strike
About 50,000 workers in Poland's 14 aircraft factories staged a one-day strike today to demand Government support for the industry, a spokesman for the strikers said.
The Government has refused to finance restructuring of the industry, which is troubled by the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union and a decline in orders from the Polish Air Force.
The walkout followed a one-hour strike on Monday by workers in up to 80 percent of Poland's factories to protest energy price rises.


Ohio State Puts a Scare Into Indiana
As if the rivalry needed some spice, the first meeting this season between Indiana and Ohio State produced something new in the high-intensity matchup that could eventually determine a Big Ten conference champion: a villain.
The terms of Hoosier hospitality were rewritten for the return of Ohio State's Lawrence Funderburke, Indiana's big man off campus, who returned to Assembly Hall tonight.

Washington: It Isn't Wall Street
The main thing he learned in Washington, said Robert R. Glauber, who is resigning Friday as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Finance and returning to academic life, is that there is no clean mechanism here to resolve conflicts.
On Wall Street, his academic specialty, "the markets force issues to a resolution," he said.


Deception on Capitol Hill
It's plainly wrong for a member of Congress to collaborate with a public relations firm to produce knowingly deceptive testimony on an important issue.
Yet Representative Tom Lantos of California has been caught doing exactly that.
His behavior warrants a searching inquiry by the House Ethics Committee.
Mr.
Lantos is co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus.
An article last week on The Times's Op-Ed page by John MacArthur, the publisher of Harper's magazine, revealed the identity of a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl who told the caucus that Iraqi soldiers had removed scores of babies from incubators and left them to die.


DIALOGUE: Should Congress Investigate the 'October Surprise'?; An Official Inquiry Might Crack the Case
Will we ever know what happened during the so-called October surprise in the 1980 Presidential elections?
Or is this story fated to become a permanent mystery?
Congress may soon be in a position to answer that question.
Last August, House and Senate leaders announced their intention to investigate charges that members of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980 met secretly with Iranians to manipulate the timing of the release of the 52 U.S. hostages held in Iran.
President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan said they would welcome a bipartisan investigation.


Harlem Hospital Doctor Faces 'Dumping' Charges
The Harlem Hospital doctor who hospital officials said turned away a woman in labor, forcing her to give birth in the hospital's waiting room, is to be charged today with a criminal misdemeanor, making him the first doctor to be prosecuted under a nine-year-old state law that bars hospitals from turning patients away in emergencies.
When the baby, Jeffrey Brown, was born last fall on a stretcher outside the hospital emergency room and wrapped in paper examination gowns because no blankets were available, the case sent waves of outrage throughout the medical community.

Little Oversight for Big Tax Breaks, Albany Panel Is Told
New York State and its local governments grant as much as $500 million a year in tax breaks to businesses with strikingly little oversight to insure that such actions create jobs, the Republican State Comptroller and a Democratic State Senator charged today.
Their comments came at a hearing on the state's approximately 150 industrial development agencies, which under state law are granted broad authority to issue tax-free bonds and forgive state and local taxes to attract development.

To the Editor:
I was appalled by the disturbing "New Years" (editorial, Jan. 1): ". . . he was lucky. . . .He hadn't needed open-heart surgery . . . Her triple bypass operation, though successful, could wear out in a few years." I have had a heart attack, angioplasty (two occasions) and triple bypass surgery (almost five years ago).
I am 71, female, vital, exuberant, active, interested -- and hope to continue into the 21st century.
Let me reassure anyone who has had (or expects to have) angioplasty or open-heart surgery: it is worth it!

Clinton Seizes on Asia Trip To Depict Bush as Beatable
Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who was helped by encouraging early polls in New Hampshire and a spate of good press notices, is seizing on President Bush's flawed Japan foreign trade mission as evidence that the Republicans are beatable this year and that he is the one to do it.
In recent days, the Presidential contender has begun attacking the Bush Administration with new vigor, casting himself as the change-oriented candidate and -- as the chief beneficiary of the early political handicapping -- sparing little attention for his Democratic opponents.


Richardson, Bobsled Chief, Is Suspended by Federation
The turmoil that has engulfed the United States Bobsled Federation for several years continued yesterday when the federation board of directors suspended its chairman, Neil Richardson.
By a vote of 9-3, Richardson was forced to step aside because of his role in the recent dispute between the federation and four athletes -- Edwin Moses, Willie Gault, Greg Harrell and Brian Shimer -- who had filed a grievance asserting they had been denied a fair chance to make the Albertville Olympics as a four-man team.

After a Disaster, Experts Say, Rescue Work Can Take a Toll
WHEN an engine fell off American Airlines flight 191 near O'Hare International Airport in 1979, the resulting crash killed 273 people.
Apart from the death toll, there was a more subtle emotional toll.
Some of the greatest suffering was among the police officers who sifted through the wreckage to gather pieces of mutilated bodies.

Florio Urges a New Fund for Economic Recovery
In a speech that focused largely on New Jersey's economic recovery and the plight of the middle class, Gov.
Jim Florio asked the Legislature today to back a series of plans to create more than 100,000 new jobs and to make it easier for middle-income residents to buy homes and to send their children to college.
"People need help, and they need hope," Mr.
Florio said in his annual State of the State message.
"Not next year. Not somewhere down the road. They need it now." 7 Points by Florio
He outlined these seven major initiatives that he said his administration would pursue during the remaining two years of his term:

Girl Is Raped In Bias Case, Police Report
In what the police have classified as a bias-related incident, a 15-year-old high school girl was abducted from a bus stop in the Flatbush-Flatlands section of Brooklyn yesterday morning, had her eyes taped shut and was driven to another location and raped, the police said.
The case was deemed bias-related because ethnic remarks were used by the two abductors, the police said.
The victim is white and the abductors are black.


U.S.-North Korea Talks Planned On State of Nuclear Development
The Bush Administration, concerned about North Korea's nuclear program but encouraged by Pyongyang's recent assertions that it would agree to international inspections and safeguards, is planning the first high-level official meeting to discuss the issue with North Koreans, the State Department indicated today.
The approach to North Korea comes at a time when American experts on nuclear proliferation are voicing doubts about Pyongyang's intentions in signing arms control agreements with South Korea, including a pledge of a nuclear-free peninsula.
They are also skeptical of assurances by Kim Il Sung, an increasingly isolated leader in a vanishing Communist world, that he will open all nuclear plants to international inspection, nearly seven years after signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.


Implant Maker Is Said to Resist Design Changes
The Dow Corning Corporation, the leading maker of silicone gel breast implants, has rejected efforts to develop alternatives without the problems of silicone, according to designers of the other implants.
Critics of the company, which is a joint venture of the Dow Chemical Company and the Corning Corporation, say it did not want to incur the costs of developing substitutes and did not want to create the impression that there was any reason to question the use of silicone.
The critics say silicone gel implants can lead to serious auto-immune disease and other problems.

It even came with a surprise ending, with upstart Miami hitting 11 free throws and a 3-point shot by a freshman, Ochiel Swaby, in the final 6 minutes 41 seconds to upset the Redmen, 45-42, before 4,843 fans at the Miami Arena.

Review/Film; That '7 Up' Group Is 35 Years Old Now, And Drooping a Bit
Michael Apted's landmark "7 Up" series, which began as an attempt to document the long-range effects of social and economic disparities among English schoolchildren of "startlingly different backgrounds," has become much, much more.
These transfixing films, the latest of which is "35 Up," reveal a reality that cannot be found in nature.
The series' ambitious time-lapse method, whereby subjects are revisited at regular seven-year intervals, makes possible an astonishingly intensive view of their lives and evolution.
At 35, not surprisingly, many of Mr.
Apted's former 7-year-olds have begun to squirm under the burden of such scrutiny.
"35 Up," which opens today at the Film Forum, finds this series growing increasingly rueful with age.
Some of the participants have realized early goals, but many others see their dreams receding.
Married, settled, noticeably bulkier, some sit surrounded by kitchen gadgets and family snapshots, speaking wistfully about their annual vacations.
Many talk tearfully about losing their parents, as does the otherwise hardboiled Tony (participants have been identified only by their first names throughout the series), who calls his mother's death "the worst moment of my life." His mother, he says, "was and still is the best girl in the world."


Motorola Net Up 15.5%
Motorola Inc.'s earnings rose 15.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Profits totaled $126 million, or 96 cents a share, compared with $109 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales were up nearly 4 percent to $3.04 billion from $2.93 billion.
For the year, earnings were down 9 percent to $454 million, or $3.44 a share, from $499 million, or $3.80 a share, in 1990.
Sales increased 4 percent to $11.34 billion from $10.89 billion.
The company's semiconductor, paging and cellular subscriber businesses did well in the final quarter.
Motorola stock gained 37.5 cents today, closing at $70.625 on the Big Board.

Former Top Official In H.U.D. Is Indicted On Charges of Fraud
A Federal grand jury today indicted a former top official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development on charges of fraud, conspiracy and false statements.
It was the first indictment of a senior H.U.D. employee in an investigation of charges of widespread mismanagement in the department under the Reagan Administration.
The official, Lance H. Wilson, was charged with wrongdoing in a 24-count indictment after a two-year inquiry by Arlin M. Adams, the independent prosecutor who has been investigating the H.U.D. affair.
Accusation on Letters
The charges center on Mr.
Wilson's activities after he left the agency in 1984 and became a senior vice president at Paine Webber, the brokerage firm in New York.
Mr.
Wilson left Paine Webber last June and is now self-employed.


Portable Registers To the Rescue of Red-Hot Spenders
Two retail technology companies are planning to introduce hand-held portable cash registers that would allow roving clerks to handle customers waiting in checkout lines or anywhere else in a store.
During sales or holiday periods, the devices could help relieve the crush of customers at retailers lucky enough to have crowds.
The devices are also being marketed as a way to provide exclusive service to big spenders, instead of subjecting them to the indignity of waiting their turns at checkout counters.


C.D. Yields Keep Dropping
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit continued to decline for the week ended yesterday, according to figures released by The Bank Rate Monitor.
The lowering of interest rates this year to help stimulate the economy continues to hurt some consumers, especially those who rely on savings accounts and other relatively low-risk interest-paying investments.
Banks have not been reducing interest charged on loans as fast as they have cut the interest they offer depositors.


Publishing Venture
Two former colleagues at Adweek magazine have formed Sponsored Publications Inc. in New York, which will produce magazines that corporations can offer to consumers by subscription or as premiums with product purchases.
Kenneth Fadner, who was president and chief executive of A/S/M Communications, Adweek's parent, is chairman, and Larry Dobrow, formerly an Adweek senior editor, is president.
The company has also opened an office in Chicago, headed by Gordon H. Rosberg Jr., a longtime specialty-publishing executive.


Louis Harris Forms New Polling Company
If President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia wanted to find out whether this week's scattered protests indicate how the broad public feels about his radical economic changes, he could call in a team from LH Research in New York.

"We want to put a lot of emphasis on a whole new kind of international polling," Mr.
Harris said.
"We want to find out things like 'What are the limits of consent by the governed?' "

Topics of The Times; Waiting for Broadway
It's good news of a sort when Broadway theaters draw long lines at the box office for current hits like "Dancing at Lughnasa" and anticipated hits like "Death and the Maiden." But the lines themselves are an outrage.
There's no excuse for forcing customers to wait two and three hours on a cold sidewalk for a few minutes at the ticket booth where they can pay up to $50 a seat for a performance months hence.
The Brooks Atkinson Theater, where the Ariel Dorfman play "Death and the Maiden" will open in March, put several hundred customers through those hoops this week.
For these hardy fans, the alternative is to order blindly over the telephone, trusting a computer to pick their seats.
That's more like a lottery than buying tickets for a play, and there's a surcharge besides.

Celebrating by Donating to Neediest
The birth of a baby or a grandmother's birthday are times that bring people close to their families and friends.
For many contributors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, they are also occasions to reach out to others about whom all they know is that they are hungry, cold or sick.
"We have just had a healthy new baby, and he seems to love life and be thriving," Richard Solomon of Westfield, N.J., wrote in a letter with $100.
"Like most people, we tend to take our situation for granted, but sometimes, lately more often than not, but particularly at this time of year, we realize how much we have to be thankful for."


Study Reports Dyslexia Is Not Unalterable, as Experts Have Been Assuming
A large study of Connecticut schoolchildren has found that dyslexia, a reading problem in children, is not an unalterable disability, as many psychologists, educators and parents had assumed.
Instead, the study found, most of the children who were considered dyslexic in the first grade were no longer dyslexic a few years later.


Young Bias-Attack Victim Tries to Laugh Off the Pain
Bryan Figueroa and his best friend, Ahmed Babar, laughed and elbowed each other as they huddled over a hand-held video game yesterday afternoon.
As the sun peeked through the mini-blinds in Bryan's bedroom, decorated with baseball caps and posters of athletic and movie star idols, they could have been any two youths sharing a laugh after school.
Except that one of them, Bryan, 12 years old, is a young symbol of a recent series of bias attacks, ranging from humiliation to violence, that have hit the city, perplexing city officials and the police.
Bryan's incident was eerily like that of a brother and sister who live not far away in Williamsbridge, the Bronx, who were attacked on Jan. 6 by four young men who splattered sneaker whitener on their faces and clothing.


Sea Bright Is Still Reeling from Halloween Storm
It's a sight that Sgt.
Steve Spahr says he'll never forget: A steel dumpster floating down Ocean Avenue, the main thoroughfare here, as floodwaters and flotsam from the normally benign Shrewsbury River crept toward the steps of police headquarters.
"That was a long night," he said, recalling Halloween, when local volunteers and National Guardsmen in 2 1/2-ton trucks helped evacuate nearly a dozen families from this Monmouth County shore community after a storm that caused some $72 million in damage along the New Jersey coastline.
"And the worst of it," said Sergeant Spahr, the borough's emergency management coordinator, "is that I think we're in for a few more long nights."  U.S.
Decision Attacked
Traditionally, Atlantic Coastal storms with high-velocity winds and tides that surge two to three feet above normal besiege this region from late January through early March.
The October storm and a similar but milder one that passed through here on Jan. 4 were unexpected, and many longtime residents view them as a preview of what's to come.

Port Charlotte Journal; When a Fresh Beginning Disturbs a Peaceful End
The idea of Florida is perfectly clear in the string of Gulf Coast towns from Bradenton through Venice, where the air smells of oleander and orchid tree, modest homes raise hopes of an easier life and a typical cafe serves iced cappuccino even in January.
Southeast of Venice, though, the idea disappears in a vast thicket of palmetto and pine that is sparsely populated and crisscrossed by streets without street lights and avenues cracked by sprouting weeds.
In this real estate development gone sour, the winter stars are bright and clear, as they were after midnight on Dec. 19 when six people, including three children, died in fits of violence.

Great-Grandpa Is Now a Great Dane
MANY of the later portraits of Winston Churchill made him look more than a little like a bulldog.
When Thierry Poncelet paints a bulldog , the animal looks alarmingly like Winston Churchill -- perhaps because it is posing in a high collar, necktie and waistcoat.
Some call it "anthropomorphic art," but another way to describe Mr.
Poncelet's curious painting is Alice in Ralphlaurenland.
Mr.
Poncelet painstakingly restores gilt-framed 18th- and 19th-century ancestral portraits, the kind of dour oil paintings usually found lining the staircases of England's statelier homes, inside men's private clubs and, in America, in shops that cater to aspiring Windsors.

Why Shops' Names Say 'Just:' Because.
IN Manhattan, a city where the range of specialty stores can be mind-boggling, there is something refreshingly direct about places that publicly proclaim their uniqueness.
In the 1991-1992 Manhattan Business directory, there are 70-plus listings for stores beginning with the word "just." Out of context, it is hard to know whether to take "just" as a compliment or a slam, though it is certainly a more melodic nomenclature than "Nothing but" or "Only."


Market Place; Ralston Purina: Profitable but . . .
THE Ralston Purina Company is solidly profitable, with a roster of famous product names like Purina dog food, Chex cereals, Wonder bread, Beech-Nut baby foods and Eveready batteries.

Ralston's shares rose by just 10 percent, compared with more than 40 percent for its main competitors and 26.3 percent for the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks.
Nor will William P. Stiritz, the publicity-shy chairman and chief executive of the St.

A Summit, or a Pseudo-Event?
Does anybody really benefit from carnival-like meetings of heads of government at the United Nations?
The question is freshly raised by a British bid to bring together by month's end the leaders of all 15 members of the Security Council.
Though formal invitations have yet to be sent, the idea has been welcomed by President Bush.
Those likely to attend include Boris Yeltsin of Russia, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Prime Minister Li Peng of China.
Doubtless this promises an impressive photo opportunity, as well as a useful chance for a new Big Five to meet face to face.
An agenda is said to be in the works that would focus on nuclear proliferation and U.N. peacekeeping.
But only serious preparations for achievable results can dispel suspicions that such a meeting would be mainly a spectacle to impress folks back home.


Bridge
It quite often happens that a declarer fails because his high cards are divided perversely between the two hands.
"If I could have traded the queen of hearts for the jack," he realizes in the post-mortem, "I would have succeeded." The same verdict is not unlikely when intermediate cards are involved, but it is very rare with small spots.
On the diagramed deal played Saturday in the Flight A Open Pairs in Port Chester, N.Y., South was frustrated by the location of a five and a four.
East and West were Peter Bisgeier of Northport, L.I., and Al Levy of Stony Brook, L.I., who were en route to victory in the event.
They were able to set problems for South and defeat a game that was made at almost all other tables.
West chose the heart nine as the opening lead, which proved to be right; in other circumstances a low heart would be the effective choice.
South allowed the nine to win, and ducked again when a heart was led to the queen.


Review/Film; 'Daughters Of the Dust': The Demise Of a Tradition
Julie Dash's "Daughters of the Dust" is a film of spellbinding visual beauty about the Gullah people living on the Sea Islands off the South Carolina-Georgia coast at the turn of the century.
More than any other group of Americans descended from West Africans, the Gullahs, through their isolation, were able to maintain African customs and rituals.
Cut off from the mainland, except by boat, they had their own patois: predominantly English but with a strong West African intonation.
Most of the film's dialogue is spoken in that dialect, called Geechee, with occasional subtitles in English.

The lengthy merger talks between the Bank of Boston and Shawmut National have ended, Shawmut said yesterday, as the two banking companies failed to agree on terms.

Giant Staff Is Shifted To Suit Handley
The Giants made major changes in their coaching staff yesterday when Al Groh left, Rod Rust replaced him as defensive coordinator and Jim Fassel was promoted to offensive coordinator.
Groh will join the Cleveland Browns as a "defensive assistant."
The changes were not surprising.
They did not stem so much from last season's disappointing 8-8 record.
Instead, they reflected Ray Handley's desire to shape the staff in his image.

Accountants Change a Rule
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants said yesterday that its members had voted to allow accountants to incorporate, which could make it harder to sue accountants for wrongdoing.
For the rule change to have much impact, most states would have to relax rules that prohibit professionals from using corporations to shield themselves from lawsuits.
Almost all states would have to accept the change before the big national firms could take advantage of it.


Justices Make It Easier for State Officials to Alter Court Pacts
The Supreme Court today made it easier for state and local officials to obtain changes in the Federal court decrees that now govern the operations of prisons, hospitals and many other public institutions.
But the Court's 6-to-2 ruling, in a long-running lawsuit over conditions in a county jail in Boston, stopped well short of the states' rights ruling for which Massachusetts and dozens of other states had argued in a case that appeared to hold the potential for sweeping change in an important and politically sensitive area of law.

Snow Makers Compensate For Nature's Balmy Days
Snow may be the stuff of skier's dreams: giant flakes that Nature supplies to assure deep, powdery landscapes and a white Christmas.
To many of these dreamers who live in the Northeast's major metropolitan areas, this winter's warm temperatures, rain and lack of snow have meant a ski-less nightmare.
But to ski area operators -- and skiers -- who know snow can be stuff shot from guns and blown from jet engines, the truth is, there has been plenty of machine-made snow and plenty of skiing, even at marginal temperatures, all season.
"This year, more areas opened in November and had good snow cover over Christmas than last year," said Morrie Trumble, who has been reporting snow conditions in the Northeast since 1972.
"Warmer temperatures and rain have been a problem in the past couple of weeks, but the mountains had cold weather for snow making in December."


For Some Gardeners, Sartorial Weeds Just Won't Do
IT'S January and you're in your garden, picking the most fragrant sweet pea from Thompson &amp; Morgan, digging up the oldest, bluest potato from Seeds Blum, squeezing the sweetest French Charentais melon from Shepherd's Garden Seeds.

Just Boys Being Boys, or Vicious Gangs?
Sekret Kukaj's epitaph is emblazoned on a sprawling mural covering an entire wall, with "Rest in Peace" written flamboyantly on one side and a blood-red Albanian flag flanking the other.
By themselves, the words and images speak to ethnic pride and perhaps hint at the nation's struggle against Communism.
But Sekret died at the age of 15.
This wall is not in Eastern Europe, but in the central Bronx.
And its message for some is as much a declaration of turf as a tribute to a fallen friend.
Avoiding Hangouts
Sekret's memorial -- on the corner of Lydig and Barnes Avenues -- also bears the name of the Albanian Boys, a group that until two recent bias attacks on Bronx schoolchildren held no significance for most New Yorkers.
In both attacks, the police said, the assailants said they were members of the Albanian Boys Inc. or the Albanian Bad Boys, loose-knit groups of teen-agers who often gathered by the mural or at a pizzeria in the Williamsbridge neighborhood to the north.

Review/Music; Pianistic Reflections Of Russia
Now that the Soviet Union is broken apart, it will be interesting to see what art will emerge from the pieces.
Who will sort out for the senses and the soul the chaos of emerging capitalism and ethnic competition?
Will the yearning for material comforts set off a new hedonism?
Will folk music take the form of political badges, as advertisements for opposing cultures?
Will some unanimity of purpose rise up and found a new and monolithic school?
One theory says that, for the moment at least, Russians and their immediate neighbors are too busy with day-to-day survival to think about esthetics.
But then there are composers like Aleksandr Mosolov and Nikolai Roslavets to remind us that in an equally chaotic time three-quarters of a century ago people kept writing, painting and composing, and used their work to speak to this part of the world about its own time.

Study of Retail Fish Markets Finds Wide Contamination and Mislabeling
In a study of the safety of food in retail fish markets in New York City and Chicago, Consumers Union has found widespread contamination and mislabeling of seafood.
The study was based on 113 samples of fish and clams that were purchased in 40 randomly selected supermarkets and specialty fish shops.
The group found that 34 samples were spoiled, 50 were contaminated with fecal coliforms, and 8 of 20 samples of swordfish had more than the permissible level of mercury.
What's more, one-third of the samples, taken from a number of different stores, were misidentified, usually as a more expensive variety.

Giants Sign James
The San Francisco Giants signed outfielder CHRIS JAMES, a free agent, to a one-year contract yesterday.
James hit .238 in 115 games with the Cleveland Indians last season, including 5 home runs and 41 runs batted in.
In 1990, he hit a career-high .299, ninth in the American League. . . .
Pitchers LES LANCASTER and AL LEITER and catcher DAMON BERRYHILL avoided salary arbitration yesterday by agreeing to one-year contracts.
Lancaster, 9-7 with a 3.52 earned run average for Chicago, will receive $1.1 million from the Cubs in 1992.
Berryhill, traded by the Cubs to Atlanta, agreed to a deal for $325,000.

Fatal Crush: Cause Still a Mystery
After dozens of interviews and three weeks of investigation, a mystery remains at the heart of the city's report into the deaths at City College: what precisely set off the fatal surge down a narrow gymnasium staircase?
But the report released yesterday prepared by Deputy Mayor Milton Mollen suggests that the crush began when the organizers of the celebrity basketball game, afraid they would lose the game's proceeds to the increasingly unruly crowd, retreated into the gym, while bewildered fans pushed forward to get in before the doors closed for good.


New Sanitation Chief Hopes To Push Recycling Business
Emily Lloyd, who will become New York City's Sanitation Commissioner next month, said yesterday that she hoped to develop new recycling markets that would attract new businesses and jobs to New York City and to encourage communities and businesses to share in keeping the city's streets and sidewalks clean.
Ms.
Lloyd, the chief business strategist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, will be inheriting an agency racked by budget cuts that have savaged the city's recycling, street cleaning and dumping enforcement programs.
But Ms.
Lloyd, 46 years old, who is also an expert on transportation and environmental issues, expressed optimism yesterday that the sanitation agency would find new ways to manage the city's mounting waste problems in the wake of growing fiscal restraints.


BAKER INTERVENES AT MIDEAST TALKS
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, breaking his detachment from the Arab-Israeli peace talks, urged all sides today to be more conciliatory.
But his limited effort appeared to have had no effect on the rapidly disintegrating negotiations.
After another bitter and futile day of talks, Israeli negotiators told their Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian and Jordanian counterparts that they planned to leave Thursday afternoon.
As Israel's Ambassador to Washington, Zalman Shoval, put it, "There's just so much time we can spend here." Departure Delayed
The Israelis had been planning to leave tonight, but decided to stay for another round of talks with the Jordanian-Palestinian team, apparently to soften the appearance that they were leaving prematurely.
Nevertheless, The Israeli departure will bring this second round of negotiations in Washington to a close with no progress having been achieved and with no understanding between the parties as to where or when to meet again.

After saying in November and December that they would introduce a new subway and bus token when the fare went up this month, New York City transit officials said yesterday that they had changed their minds.
The current token will remain in use for the foreseeable future.
During the public debate over the last two months on how much the fare would increase, officials of the Transit Authority, which operates the city's subway and buses, often said they would put a new token into use when the new fare went into effect on Jan. 1.
They said they had spent $9 million for 60 million new tokens, which they said were needed in part to help curb the use of counterfeit slugs.

Faded Glory: Looking Back at the Gulf War -- A Special Report Year After Gulf War, Joy Is a Ghost; The Grief: Broken Hearts Left Behind
In the 10 months since he buried his son not far from here, Norman Madison has waged a personal war against depression, anger and disillusionment with flag and country.
It is a war that the 54-year-old former marine fears he will have to fight until he goes to his own grave.
Mr.
Madison's son, Anthony, 27, was one of 13 Army reservists from this proud, hard-luck region of Western Pennsylvania who was killed in a Scud missile attack in Saudi Arabia in the final days of the war.
"My son's death has changed my whole life," Mr.
Madison said here the other day as he held his son's Purple Heart.
"I'm altogether different than what I was. I don't know how to describe it."
"Emptiness?" his wife, Darla, suggested.
"Yeah," Mr. Madison agreed, "and I can't fill it up."
Twenty-eight reservists were killed that night in the desert but no other patch of America had to bury so many of its sons and daughters, so many of its dreams of grandchildren and fishing trips.
And nowhere else in America were so many broken hearts left behind, scattered across the hilly countryside of small cities and towns like the leafless trees that now sway in the winter wind.
For much of the last year, Diane Radocaj has tried to help ease the suffering as head of a family support group in Greensburg, where the reservists were based.
"From what I've seen there is a variety of emotions," she said.
"Some are bitter and they always will be. Others have accepted it. But the emotion that dominates is just a sense of loss."
In Rochester Mills, a town with one street, where Specialist Christine L. Mayes grew up and was buried at age 22, her father said he and his family were "getting as close to normal as you can get."
"I could be bitter and cynical but I'm not," Franklin Mayes said.
"You can dwell on this until it drives you crazy. You have to let it go. Enough is enough." Mr.
Mayes's daughter was one of two women from the reserve unit, the 14th Quartermaster Detachment, to be killed in the attack.
On the anniversary, Feb. 25, a stone monument will be dedicated to the reservists, both living and dead.
Fund for Children of Dead
The $250,000 monument will sit near the entrance of the reserve center in Greensburg and will be surrounded by 13 newly planted trees.
Most of the construction, labor and material have been donated.
A $20,000 scholarship fund has been established for the 10 children of the dead.
But most people here have closed the door on the war, said the Roman Catholic Bishop of Greensburg, the Rev.
Anthony Bosco.
"People are back to their own problems," he said.
"The people who have the empty chair at the dinner table are the ones who feel it. That's not cruel. That's life."
Bishop Bosco said the recession had hit the area hard.
Tomorrow, he said, is what most people here now worry about.
"I think the proof that Desert Storm is history is in George Bush's popularity polls," the Bishop said.
"His popularity here is not good because of the economy." 'My Boy Died for Oil'
In Mr. Madison's hilltop home, President Bush is an especially bitter subject.
"What really burns me up is that nothing has changed over there," Mr.
Madison said.
"Hussein is still in control. Our President sits around waving his flag like he did something. He didn't do anything. Nothing. My son is dead. What did he die for?"
Last February as he waited for his son's body, Mr.
Madison said he believed the war was necessary.
But today, after months of grief and reflection, he said he no longer had faith in the Government.
"They lie and lie and lie and it never ends," Mr.
Madison said.
"The war was about oil. My boy died for oil."
As he talked, tears welling in his eyes, his wife, who was Anthony Madison's stepmother, touched his shoulder and said, "It'll be a year ago next month that Tony died, but it seems like yesterday."


Devils Go on a Tear With Sabres Close By
Spectators who brought scorecards to tonight's game between Buffalo and New Jersey probably wished they had taken along calculators instead.

With the Government and guerrillas set to sign a formal peace accord in Mexico on Thursday, ending a dozen years of civil war, Salvadorans are looking to the future with a mixture of great optimism and fears about random violence and the economy.
Leaders from President Alfredo Cristiani and politicians across the board to the guerrilla and army chieftains have painted a rosy picture of the political peace and economic growth that they say will follow the cease-fire scheduled to begin on Feb. 1.


Yes, the Giants Do Know the Way to San Jose
In the years since the Giants joined the Los Angeles-bound Dodgers in perfidy and abandoned New York in 1958, the move to San Francisco has not gone unpunished: an open-ended sentence for the Giants to play in the ill-conceived and decidedly misnamed Candlestick Park, where, as virtually any shivering outfielder or fan can attest, no flame can flicker long amid the incessantly swirling winds.
Yesterday, for the fourth time since he bought the team from Horace Stoneham in 1975, Bob Lurie announced yet another plan to move out of the cramped 62,000-seat stadium, which opened in 1960.


COMPANY NEWS;
The AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, yesterday reported a net loss of $124.9 million for the fourth quarter.
But the figure represented a significant improvement over the loss of $215.1 million for the quarter a year earlier, and analysts said it was smaller than they had expected.
AMR's chairman, Robert L. Crandall, attributed the loss at the nation's largest airline to economic conditions, compounded by the impact of the Persian Gulf war and fare cutting in the airline industry.
"The best thing you can say about last year is that it's over," he said.

With political power in New Jersey now split between a Democratic Governor and veto-proof Republican majorities in the legislature, both parties face a daunting challenge to make government work.

Scientists Find Gene That Causes Rare Form of High Blood Pressure
Scientists have discovered the gene behind a rare and severe form of high blood pressure that strikes early in life, often during childhood.
Although doctors have long observed that high blood pressure can run in families, the research is the first to identify a gene that causes hypertension, a potentially lethal condition that afflicts more than 60 million Americans.

We Are the World; We Are the Crayons
TEACHERS and children from the Montgomery County school district in Maryland, just north of Washington, were tired of seeing the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. being drawn with a black crayon.
The problem was Crayola packed its flesh-colored crayons (hues from apricot to mahogany) only in its 64-pack, which was too big for the pupils' small hands.
Heeding the call for a new age of multiculturalism (and marketing), Binney &amp; Smith, the Easton, Pa., company that makes Crayolas, slipped the existing skin-tone crayons into their own box.

Anti-Fundamentalist Writer Slain in Beirut
A Shiite Muslim writer who had sharply criticized fundamentalists and Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was assassinated here today, security officials said.

No Felony Drug Charge
The United States Attorney's office will not pursue felony criminal drug charges against Yankee relief pitcher STEVE HOWE, assistant United States Attorney KRIS McLEAN said in an interview published yesterday in the Independent Record of Helena, Mont.
"After consulting with the appropriate investigative agencies and reviewing the evidence," there is not enough evidence to indict Howe on federal felony drug charges, McLean was quoted as saying.
"It doesn't mean the misdemeanor case is weaker. It just means we didn't have the evidence to charge a felony."

Hoping to speed the development of new mobile communications, from cheap and tiny wireless telephones to electronic notebooks that send and receive data over the air, the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday will propose opening up a big swath of radio frequencies for "emerging technologies."
In its proposal, which is certain to create controversy, the F.C.C. will recommend reallocating frequencies now used by railroads, electric utilities, police and fire departments for microwave communications.

Boy Is Raped and Neighbors Ponder the Horror
In all the fear and confusion felt by parents and neighbors who learned that an 11-year-old boy was abducted and raped at 8 A.M. on Tuesday on West 77th Street and that a man with H.I.V. had been charged, there were really only two gut reactions.
Some people tried to reassure themselves that so horrible a crime in their quiet gentrified neighborhood was aberrational.
Others talked of moving out of town.
All agreed that the incident was any parent's worst nightmare.
"What is the magic age at which you can envision letting your child go to school by himself?" said Allan Ripp, whose 6-year-old attends Public School 87, next to Intermediate School 44, the victim's school on West 77th Street.
"God, this isn't about our schools, this is about what is happening in this city."


Barkley Over Line Once Too Often
In a recent game against the Clippers in Los Angeles, the Philadelphia 76ers were leading by 5 points in the fourth quarter and Charles Barkley decided that it was time to rub a little salt into this very minor wound.
Isolating against Charles Smith, the Clippers' 6-foot-10-inch forward, Barkley mocked his opponent's defensive intentions, laughing as he waved the ball in Smith's face and dared him to steal the ball.
Promptly, Smith obliged, and off he went to dunk the ball uncontested, as Barkley's boastful smile disintegrated into one embarrassed smirk.

Faded Glory: Looking Back at the Gulf War -- Inside: 4 special reports.; A Year After Victory, Joy Is a Ghost
The yellow ribbons, now frayed and faded, are still wrapped around the oak trees near the Hunter Army Air Field here where horn-honking, flag-waving crowds lined the streets in the early morning hours last March to greet the first troops returning from the Persian Gulf war.
But here as elsewhere, the war seems like something from another era these days, and the talk is of other things: the sluggish economy, the dreary stretch of empty buildings on Broughton Street downtown, the record-breaking local murder rate.

Supreme Court Ruling Clears Way For Deportation of an I.R.A. Man
The Supreme Court today cleared away what would appear to be the last legal obstacle to the deportation of Joe Doherty, a former Irish Republican Army guerrilla who has been in Federal custody for more than eight years.
The case has become a rallying point for opposition in this country to British rule in Northern Ireland.
In a unusual, divided ruling that overturned a 1990 decision by the Federal appeals court in New York, the Court ruled that Mr.
Doherty, who fled a British prison during his trial for murder, was not entitled to a new hearing in his prolonged legal struggle to avoid deportation.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the 5-to-3 decision.

Russia's Harvard Tutor Defends Reform
The Russian Government's chief foreign tutor in the ways of free-market economics offered the nation a supplementary lesson today in hard-nose politics.
Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist being viewed here amid the ashes of Communism as both dark wizard and enlightened missionary, demonstrated to his patrons that one way to deal with the rising criticism of President Boris N. Yeltsin's price rise program was to attack Russia's central bank and Parliament as the real culprits in wasting rubles.

But scientists said the retraction of the first discovery did not invalidate the second discovery of planets around a neutron star reported last week by other astronomers.

Southwestern Bell's Moves Pay Off
When the "Baby Bells" were created by the breakup of A.T.&amp; T., Southwestern Bell won few friends on Wall Street by saying that it planned to stick to its knitting.
Analysts favored the glowing talk of the other Baby Bells about opportunities in unregulated businesses.
In the following years, several of the seven Baby Bells stumbled badly in ventures ranging from real estate to computer retailing.
Southwestern, meanwhile, demonstrated a knack for moving occasionally but boldly into more closely related businesses, like cellular telephones, paging and investments in overseas phone companies.
Now, even though Baby Bell shares have risen handsomely, the former wallflower, Southwestern Bell, trades at an earnings multiple several points above the average for the group.


Supreme Court in Trenton Voids 32d Death Sentence Since 1982
The New Jersey Supreme Court today overturned the death sentence of a Camden County man who was convicted of fatally stabbing his drug supplier.

The court has upheld one death sentence, but has scheduled a hearing on its fairness for next week.


Property Values Stay Flat But New York Taxes Rise
The real-estate market in New York City is still losing value, but the pace of that decline is slowing considerably, according to the city's Department of Finance, which released its tentative tax roll yesterday for the fiscal year beginning on July 1.
The total amount by which all properties are assessed for tax purposes fell by just 0.47 percent this fiscal year, compared with a drop of 8.6 percent in the prior period, said the Finance Commissioner, Carol O'Cleireacain.


Year After Bombing, General Is at Ease
A year ago Gen.

Today, retired from the military, he is living with his wife and their three daughters near a golf course in Cheval, Fla., a suburb of Tampa, where he is working on his autobiography with the help of a writer, Peter Petre.
General Schwarzkopf's agent, Marvin Josephson, who usually talks to him every day, said yesterday that the general was not participating in any public commemoration of the start of the Persian Gulf war.


HOME IMPROVEMENT
KEEPING cutting tools sharp is a key to using them skillfully and safely.
Chisels, planes and knives are relatively easy to sharpen; other tools, like saws, scissors and drill bits, should be sharpened professionally.
Sharpening involves grinding a thick, dull edge against a harder surface, like a sharpening stone.
Despite the variety of stones and sharpening implements available, the simplest and least expensive for an amateur remains the old-fashioned combination oilstone.


Lion and Lamb Lie Down in the Bronx
IN the beginning, Christina Schlesinger, a Manhattan artist, endured a hail of bottles thrown from the elevated subway tracks at the East Tremont Avenue station when she drew the grid for "Peaceable Kingdom," her mural on a brick wall in the South Bronx.
But when she fleshed out the mural with cotton-candy pink clouds and forest greens, she attracted a more appreciative audience.
"One guy stood in front of it for a long time," she said.
"He said I had something wrong." It seemed to him that the lion and the lamb couldn't possibly coexist.

Bad Loans Easing Grip On Banks
It is too early to dance on banks' doorsteps, but recent earnings reports by several large banks suggest that the recession is loosening its grip on the Northeast.
While many banks in the region have been able to recover more quickly than the economy by sharply reducing interest rates paid on deposits and squeezing out other costs, they are also reporting fewer troubled loans, or at least a sharp slowdown in the growth of them.
Troubled loans, those that are far behind in payments or are not expected to be repaid in full, doubled and tripled at many banks as the economy turned downward in 1990 and 1991.

Records kept coming yesterday in the stock market in a rush of trading that made the session one of Wall Street's busiest ever.
A day after a 60-point surge, the Dow Jones industrial average plowed ahead, gaining 12.30 points more, to 3,258.50, its ninth record in 13 days.
And other indexes kept rewriting their records as well.
The engine driving this heady advance apparently remains the same, and remains potent: a combination of low interest rates and a strong belief that the economy is recovering.

AN INQUIRY SPREADS BLAME FOR DEATHS AT A NEW YORK GYM
The Dinkins administration's official review of the deadly crush at a City College gymnasium last month blames virtually all the parties that arranged and oversaw the celebrity basketball game -- reproaching student organizers, college officials, a rap promoter, the police and the spectators themselves.
The death of nine young men and women at what they expected to be a spirited contest between two teams of rap stars is the second-deadliest episode of crowd-control failure in recent memory in the United States, ranking after the Who concert in Cincinnati in 1979 in which 11 people died.
The tragedy stunned New Yorkers and led Mayor David N. Dinkins to assign his Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, Milton Mollen, to conduct the investigation that led to the report released last night. 'Inescapable Conclusion'
Portraying a cascading failure of responsibility, it concluded: "A review of all the events leading up to the fateful tragedy at the C.C.N.Y. gymnasium on Dec. 28, 1991, leads to the inescapable conclusion that almost all of the individuals involved in the event demonstrated a lack of responsibility."


Treasuries Down in Hectic Trading

German interest rates are high relative to American rates, and with Germany appearing to be heading toward recession, money managers are expecting a rally in the German bond market.

BBDO Toronto Unit In Deal With McKim
BBDO Worldwide announced yesterday that it planned to create the largest advertising agency in Canada by merging its Baker Lovick/BBDO unit with McKim Advertising, both in Toronto.
The new agency, to be called McKim Baker Lovick/BBDO, would have billings in excess of $320 million.
The merger, which is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies, follows a decision by BBDO to purchase all of the outstanding shares of McKim.
About 45 percent of those shares became available when their owner, Ayer Inc. in New York, decided not to exercise its option to buy the remaining shares.
Instead, an Ayer spokeswoman said, Ayer chose to sell its stake in McKim because of potential client conflicts.

The Dow Corning Corporation suffered new trouble yesterday from a Government moratorium on breast implants as the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation lowered its rating for the company's debt and said more reductions were possible.
Standard &amp; Poor's said its major concern was the possibility of a large number of costly lawsuits against the company and Dow Corning Wright, its wholly owned medical devices subsidiary, by thousands of women claiming they had been harmed by silicone leaking from the implants or other hazards asssociated with them.
The credit agency said the shutdown of production operations for the breast implants and the $25 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings announced Tuesday by Dow Corning would have minimal impact on its financial condition.

Home Video
How about Danny Glover as a lion?
And Tracey Ullman as a cat?
When Rabbit Ears Productions or Lightyear Entertainment, two producers of children's videos, tape their animated stories, they hire movie actors to narrate.
While that approach may not dislodge Disney, it has helped earn a following in video stores.
For example, Lightyear's "Beauty and the Beast," part of its "Stories to Remember" series and narrated by Mia Farrow, is especially popular now because Disney's animated film "Beauty and the Beast" is in movie theaters.
Rabbit Ears videos scheduled for this year include "The Monkey People," with Raul Julia; "Rip Van Winkle," with Anjelica Huston; "Koi and the Kola Nuts," with Whoopi Goldberg; a lively, French-accented "Puss in Boots" with Ms.
Ullman, and "Brer Rabbit and Boss Lion," with Mr.
Glover.
The actors don't appear on camera.
Their job is to tell stories chosen from children's literature and similar sources, accompanied by illustrations and musical scores by well-known artists and musicians.
For instance, "The Tiger and the Brahman" from Rabbit Ears, told by Ben Kingsley, has a score composed and performed by Ravi Shankar.
Videos from the two companies, which are not connected, are about a half-hour long and sell for less than $10 in book and record stores as well as video stores.
Rabbit Ears productions are semi-animated, with about 200 drawings moving in sequence, sometimes rapidly enough to produce character movement.
Stories to Remember videos are more fully animated.
"Beauty and the Beast," for instance, has about 1,000 drawings.
"It's not how many drawings you have, but what you do with them," said Joshua Greene, the producer of Stories to Remember.
"A picture book is a very intimate experience for a child. You have to project that onto the screen."
Rabbit Ears began producing its stories in 1985.
"I wanted people who could tell them like my mother," said Mark Sottnick, the executive producer.
Professional storytellers were often too theatrical for his taste, so he turned to actors, most of whom, Mr.
Sottnick said, read similar stories to their own children or were struck by them as works of literature.
"I love the stories," said Mr.
Glover, who has narrated three videos for Rabbit Ears.
"Kids see that it's not only me in 'Lethal Weapon,' but this is the guy who tells them stories."
Rabbit Ears actors, who have included Jack Nicholson and Jodie Foster, are paid for what is usually about a half-day's work.
Mr.
Sottnick wouldn't say how much, but he said the amount was comparable to what the narrator might earn for a half-day on a film set.
Mr.
Greene, who has been creating "Stories to Remember" since 1987, said he paid a good wage.
Often he goes far afield for illustrators.
Two stories now in production, both to be narrated by Sigourney Weaver, are being illustrated by a studio in Moscow.
"We have to send them paper, pencils, erasers and paints," he said.

At the core of Spike Lee's film is the doomed affair between Flipper (Wesley Snipes), a young black architect, and Angie (Annabella Sciorra), his white secretary.
From there the story moves out to record the reactions of family and friends.
There are Flipper's angry wife (Lonette McKee), his befuddled parents (Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee), his cavalier brother, a crack addict (Samuel L. Jackson) and his reflective best friend (Mr. Lee).
On the other side, behind aluminum storm doors in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, are Angie's outraged father (Frank Vincent), her robustly bigoted brothers (David Dundara and Michael Imperioli) and her detached neighborhood boyfriend (John Turturro).
Mr.
Lee's anger complements his competence as a film maker, resulting in a "splendid, serious social comedy" (Vincent Canby).

The wisdom that comes with age has taught John McEnroe lessons about hindsight and about making the most of the future.
After maneuvering his way past Andrei Cherkasov, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, in the second round of the Australian Open, McEnroe paused to reflect on his past.
"It's hard to smell the roses when you're No. 1," McEnroe said.
"You're always looking over your shoulder because the second you let down there are these young guys ready to pounce on you."


Nets March In and Bury the Wounded in Boston
Larry Bird was out with a sore back.
Robert Parish was sidelined with a sprained left ankle.
And five minutes before tonight's game with New Jersey, Boston announced that Kevin McHale would be placed on the injured list and miss the next five games.
Showing no mercy, the Nets raced back from a 14-point third-quarter deficit, overtook the depleted Celtics and beat them, 130-120, to the dismay of the 516th consecutive sellout in Boston Garden.


Intel Profits Are Strong for Period and Year
The Intel Corporation today reported record revenues and earnings for 1991 and fourth-quarter results at the high end of analysts' expectations.
Its strong showing came despite the recession and the emergence of a competing producer of its core microprocessor products.
Analysts attributed Intel's gains partly to increased sales of the company's products with high profit margins.
These include the 486 microprocessor, which forms the heart of the most powerful personal computers, and the 386SL, a version of the 386 chip that consumes less electrical current.

NEW YORK CITY QUESTIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY
A mayoral report that offers the first authoritative assessment of the deadly crush at a City College gymnasium last month paints a picture of a cascading failure of responsibility and blames virtually all parties that arranged and oversaw the celebrity basketball game -- reproaching student organizers, college officials, a rap promoter, the police and the spectators themselves.

As an expanded force, including extra police patrols and human rights counselors, appealed for calm in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn yesterday, an intensive search continued for two men who detectives say abducted and raped a 15-year-old girl on Tuesday morning as she waited for a bus to school.
At a news conference at Police Headquarters yesterday, the Police Commissioner, Lee P. Brown, released a sketch of one of the men in the attack and said the city had enlisted extra help because the attack involved both rape and bias.

With Subway and Bus Fares at $1.25, the M.T.A.'s Got to Give
To the Editor:
Since it will now cost a family of four $5 to take a subway or bus ride for an outing, then another $5 to return, it may well be that many families will switch to taxis rather than support a sagging public transportation system.
Since poor families are hardest hit by increases in subway and bus fares, many families of four or more may have to think twice about investing $10 just to take public transportation to a museum, sporting event, show or whatever.

Without endorsing Mr.
Stone's conspiracy theories, the Kennedy family and a growing number of public officials are giving welcome encouragement to a fuller historical account of a national tragedy.
They need to press the case for wider disclosure -- without illusions that new data will appease the insatiable conspiracy theorists.

Four leaders of the insurgent group, the United Liberation Front of Assam, attended the two-hour meeting, which was held on Sunday.
The four had been freed from prison and flown by special aircraft to New Delhi for the talks.

Yields Are Down Sharply for Money Funds
The money funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report continued to show lower yields yesterday for both tax-exempt and taxable funds.
"Now we are seeing the full effect of the Federal Reserve's recent easing of interest rates showing up in money fund yields," said Walter Frank, economist for the organization.
"Earlier this year, the effects were masked somewhat by year-end influences. We will see some further decline in money fund yields. But until we get some further action from the Federal Reserve, the bulk of the decline in short-term yields is behind us."

It also offered a chance to get to know influential legislators.


Chevron to Cut Back At Big Texas Refinery
Hurt by weak demand and low prices for natural gas and gasoline and rising costs for environmental regulations, the Chevron Corporation today announced a program to cut costs, including a plan to reduce or possibly end output at the Chevron refinery in Port Arthur, Tex. -- the company's biggest.
The decision follows moves last year by other large refiners like Shell and Amoco to sell or close refineries and suggests that the nation's gasoline refining capacity will fall by approximately 100,000 barrels a day, or about 4 percent, in coming years.

Rock-and-Roll Honors Those at Its Roots
Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones lovingly, if a bit irreverently, spoke of the contribution that Leo Fender made to popular music to the audience assembled for the seventh annual Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel last night.
"He gave us the weapons," Mr.
Richards said to the crowd of 950 about the man who invented the Fender electric guitar.
Mr.
Richards's parting shot to the crowd was what he called the "guitar players' prayer": "Caress it. Don't squeeze it." Mr.
Fender, who died in March, was among the hodgepodge of pop-music legends inducted into the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame last night.
The diversity offered raucous, soulful and mellow testimony that rock defies easy definition.
A planned I. M. Pei-designed building in Cleveland to house the music's history, meanwhile, continues to defy construction.

Gates's testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, on the eve of the first anniversary of the start of the Persian Gulf war, may have been coincidental.
But the message was clear: Despite allied success in damaging Iraq's special weapons programs, the country, he said, "is still a great challenge" to nations and organizations that have attempted to disarm it.

So the Baby's Food Can Find Its Target
ADAM STRAUS, an industrial designer, had only the physical and play needs of babies in mind when he designed his silver spoons, shown at left.
The wide, animalesque, tactile handles are meant to be gripped overhand, the way a baby grips: tightly, ungingerly.
Underneath, the handles are cut in relief so small hands won't slip.
Mr.
Straus, who has a 1-year-old niece, also studied nurseries for design themes.
Animals, not suprisingly, popped up most frequently.
His three stylized animal handles -- depicting a rabbit, a bear and a fish -- are meant to look as if they are in motion; the fish spoon, for example, seems to float along, bubbling.

But while Slovenia looks forward to a relatively secure future as a comparatively prosperous Alpine republic, the joy in Croatia was tempered by uncertainty.


Review/Music; Mozart and Something New
The Mozart bicentennial binge seems scarcely to have abated with the passing of the anniversary of the composer's death.
The Brooklyn Philharmonic and its conductor laureate, Lukas Foss, offered motley Mozart for the first half of their program last weekend at the Brooklyn Academy of Music: the "Don Giovanni" Overture, the Andante in C for Clarinet and Strings (K. 315) and the Trio in E flat for Viola, Clarinet and Piano (K. 498).
The overture was something more, actually: a Foss confection called "Music for Three Orchestras." Bands in front of the stage and in two side balconies played the little dances from the opera's party scene, and the large orchestra onstage played the overture.
The dances proved a harmless fillip at the start, but they returned to intrude on the overture's conclusion.


To Say Kitschy, Kitschy Without Having to Coo
WENDY BACKER, the sole owner of Thinga-ma-bib, a San Francisco company, decided it was high time that babies and kitsch -- vintage post cards, plastic dinosaurs, tiny dolls in Hawaiian skirts, tinier ants -- got together at mealtime.
So she put the kitsch in her bibs.
"I was so disgusted with the pink-and-blue-duck stuff that I decided to make my own," she said.
The vinyl bibs have seven themes, including "The Suburban Dream" (fake money attached to a picture of a house) and "La Bamba" (babies and electric guitars), below.


U.S. Oil Output Drops; Consumption Also Falls
Domestic oil production "has begun a precipitous decline," the American Petroleum Institute said yesterday.
In a report summing up last year, it also found that consumption fell, so imports also declined, and that oil's slice of the national energy pie dropped to a 40-year low of 41 percent.
The institute, which is the industry's main trade group, said that producers kept up their output in the early part of 1991 because of the Persian Gulf war, but that fourth-quarter crude production was the lowest for that quarter in 30 years, and outside Alaska it was the lowest since 1950.
The number of operational drilling rigs, fewer than 800 in the last five months, is the lowest in nearly 50 years.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media; Candidates Are on Call for Small TV Station
Jack Heath, the 31-year-old news director of a small television station here, did not have to hang up on anyone at the White House this week or threaten to cancel an interview with the President.
He had used that tactic -- with great success -- before his interview in December, but this time the problems were resolved more smoothly.
The only real difficulty came on the eve of President Bush's arrival in New Hampshire, when the White House called to say that Mr.
Bush would find time during today's visit to tape an interview with the station, WMUR-TV.
"They said we'd be the only media to get an interview," Mr.
Heath said Tuesday, but he was still not satisfied.
He wanted the President on live at the start of the 6 o'clock news.


Review/Theater; The 'Near Future' of 1970 Arrives in a Revival
In "The Philanthropist," Christopher Hampton turned "The Misanthrope" inside out by creating a title character who likes everyone and apologizes for everything, even when it is someone else's fault.
Because of the accuracy of the playwright's perceptions, the play is far more than a case of reverse Moliere.
It is a highly literate comedy of manners, with sobering undertones.
The subjects are academic insularity and artistic arrogance, the assumption that words are more relevant than actions or emotions.
Although the play was first presented in 1970, it seems not to have aged at all, as demonstrated in Gordon Edelstein's vibrant new production at the Long Wharf Theater.
This bourgeois comedy was originally set in the "near future." That future is now, and also tomorrow, whenever and wherever people forcibly detach themselves from the problems of the world around them and seclude themselves in a hothouse.
In this university environment, the characters suffer from severe myopia.
They are unmoved by suicide and even mass murder, as long as it happens to other people.


PARENT &amp; CHILD
SOON after her mother broke up with the man she had been dating, 9-year-old Jane asked to sleep in her mother's bed.
"She wanted to comfort me," said Barbara S., a recently divorced psychologist in Westchester County who spoke on the condition that her full name not be used.
"She told me, 'He wasn't good for us, Mom. Besides, you have me.' "
Children of single parents have a tremendous emotional investment in the parent's dating.
Yet their feelings can be ambivalent or even contradictory.
The person their parent is involved with can be both a potential savior and a threat, a provider of love and a rival for it.

Bryan Adams  The Ritz
When Bryan Adams's single "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You," from the film "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," became a hit last summer, it was as though a voice from rock-and-roll's near past had suddenly crashed into the present.
Known for such hits of the mid-80's as "Cuts Like a Knife," "Run to You" and "Summer of '69," Mr.
Adams wasn't exactly making a comeback; his last album was released in 1987.
But in those four years between hits, he was rather easy to forget.
There was something disposable about his songs, something generic.
At the Ritz on Friday night, Mr.
Adams made "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You," which is the second-best-selling single of all time, the obvious centerpiece of his set.
The lights came down low; the singer mumbled something about a "happy accident"; the keyboardist, Tommy Mandel, struck a few fat notes on his synthesizer, and women in the sold-out crowd began shrieking as one.
The show was carefully paced around the ballads.
Mr.
Adams opened with a string of uptempo rock tunes -- "Can't Stop This Thing We Started" and "Hey Honey -- I'm Packin' You In!" from his latest album, "Waking Up the Neighbors," a version of the rhythm-and-blues classic "I Hear You Knocking" -- that sounded enough like the Rolling Stones in the "Sticky Fingers" era to be a bit spooky.
The only difference was that the relatively clean-cut Mr.
Adams and his lead guitarist, Keith Scott, are too polished to miss notes the way the Stones do.
Pounding out tracks like these, wearing a no-frills gray T-shirt streaked with sweat and new-looking blue jeans with the cuffs rolled up, Mr.
Adams strove to fit the most basic archetype of a rock-and-roller: unpretentious, hard-working, sincere.
Even the title of his new album seems to suggest that he's just a good old boy who wants to have fun.
But what kept his rocker act from being convincing were the ballads.
Their unapologetic mushiness and glossy pop production are the antithesis of rock-and-roll.
"Everything I Do" and "Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven" could easily have been hits for Michael Bolton or Whitney Houston, and the raunchy chords and stomping rhythms can't disguise the fact that hits like "Somebody" and "Run to You" are hollow at the core.
Mr.
Adams is all form and no content.
His songs are catchy and shallow, like pop.
They're neat.

And as it has been in past so-called off seasons, baseball has found a way to push into the territory once reserved almost exclusively for winter sports.
But the big news during baseball's second season is no longer dominated by such feel-good stories about M.V.P. and Cy Young winners and the coronation of the latest inductees into the Hall of Fame.

Europe, Backing Germans, Accepts Yugoslav Breakup
In a triumph for German foreign policy, all 12 members of the European Community, as well as Austria and Switzerland, recognized the independence of the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia today.
In a series of separate statements, various European governments asserted that the Belgrade Government no longer had a right to rule the two republics.


Gadgets Fall Back With the Times
From the purple-carpeted lounges that looked out over the International Housewares Show at McCormick Place here you could see an ocean of wicker and neon.
There were mirrored renditions of Malcolm X, Elvis and puppies.
There were inflatable clocks, flashlight-shaped "personal alarms," cloth sacks made specifically for kittens to play in, miniature teak furniture, contraptions that bake waffles in the shape of Bugs Bunny, electric wands that dehumidify closets, and companies with names like Mr.
Ice Bucket, Warp Brothers and Love Mug Inc.
When it comes to churning out gadgets and novelties, there is nothing more prolific than the housewares industry.
For the last 53 years, marketers of ergonomic cheese cutters, flashing dog collars and the like have gravitated to this show to display their goods.
It is all the more curious, then, that at this year's exhibition age-old products and Depression-era designs were touted as the industry's cutting edge.

Attica Judge Alters Decision on Verdicts
The judge presiding over a trial to determine the liability of four New York State officials in the 1971 Attica prison uprising said today that a verdict could be announced while he was away on vacation, reversing a decision he made on Tuesday.
Judge John T. Elfvin -- who has overseen this landmark case since 1975 and had said that any verdict reached by the jury would be sealed until he returned from Barbados on Feb. 10 -- announced just before leaving for the Caribbean today that the jury could deliver its verdicts to a magistrate who will preside in his absence.
The judge's about-face followed objections from lawyers for the 1,281 former inmates who filed a civil-liability suit against New York State officials and lawyers representing the four defendants.


Pop and Jazz in Review
'The Fabulous Bud E. Luv Show'  Jewel Box Theater 321 West 44th Street Through Jan. 26
Who is the world's greatest entertainer?
According to an announcement at the Jewel Box Theater, it is none other than Bud E. Luv (Robert Vickers), the quintessential Las Vegas lounge lizard and a star with an ego as big as all outdoors.
In "The Fabulous Bud E. Luv Show," the singer, clad in a red smoking jacket decorated with images of dice and martini glasses, runs through many of the songs you never wanted to hear again, from "Mack the Knife" to "Danke Schon," in a style that suggests a distillation of Sonny Bono, Tony Orlando and Dean Martin.
Wearing the fixed grin of a sleazy used-car salesman, Mr.
Luv, who was christened Bud Euripides Luvalopolis Jr., chats about a typical day's activities (golf with Joey Bishop, lunch with Charro, big winnings at the gaming tables) and oozes endlessly about the "chicks" in his life.
Amid those songs you never wanted to hear again, he performs such originals as "The Ballad of Sheila Cornucopia," the story of his failed marriage to his "fifth and seventh wife," set to the tune of "El Paso," and "Talent," a name-dropping list song of stupefying fatuity.
The star, who claims to have been on the scene in just about every place where pop history has been made in the last three decades, pays tribute to the "Woodchuck" generation in a medley that includes fragments of Santana's "Black Magic Woman" (re-christened "Black Magic Marker") and the Who's "Pinball Wizard" ("Crap Game Wizard").
The show reaches a hilarious nadir with a Las Vegas-style disco medley, which begins with "The Hustle" and includes fragments of "Boogie Oogie Oogie," "Kung Fu Fighting" and "YMCA."
The kind of entertainer epitomized by Bud E. Luv is, of course, an easy target for spoof.
What makes Mr.
Vickers's performance special is the deadpan accuracy of his impersonation.
His tributes to Sammy Davis Jr. and Tom Jones reveal that technically he is almost as good a singer as those he mimics.
As withering as his parody may be, it is also obviously driven by a deep affection for the Bud E. Luvs of this world and their oleaginous ways.

Protectionism Not Root of Wheat Loss
To the Editor:
On his recent trip President Bush told the Australians that a 30 percent loss in United States wheat production last year was related to trade barriers created by European farm subsidies.
In fact, the sharp decline in our wheat production was due to drought and excessive temperatures in much of the country's grain belt.

Fewer Names Are Changed
The number of corporate name changes in 1991 fell for the third consecutive year, according to the 21st annual name-change survey by Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc., a New York corporate-identity consulting firm.
Anspach Grossman reported that 1,069 name changes were recorded last year, down 19.1 percent from 1,321 in 1990 and down 33.2 percent from 1,600 in 1989.
The 1991 figure also marked a decline of 42.7 percent from the record number of name changes, 1,864, in 1988.


Politics Sidetracks Contraceptive Research
To the Editor:
I recently presided over Congressional hearings that examined both the state of contraceptive research in this country and the potential usefulness of the French abortifacient RU-486.
At one hearing, Dr.
David Grimes, a researcher and professor of gynecology at the University of Southern California, told my subcommittee that "today, women in Dhaka, Bangladesh, have contraceptive choices that are not available to a woman in Washington, D.C." Of course, Dr.
Grimes could have named any city in the United States.


When the President Talks
President Bush long ago made himself famous for his tin ear in speech.
Once, he told reporters that "I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism," prompting Gov.
Mario Cuomo of New York to express relief that the President hadn't gone on to offend Italians, too, by saying he was antipasto.


At the Bar
Judges manques enjoy serving on bar association ethics committees, where they get to pronounce on the mores of the legal profession.
For the most part, though, what they ponder are not crowd pleasers but less-than-scintillating technical matters like questions about client confidences or conflicts of interest.
The ethics committee of the New York County Lawyers' Association, however, recently received a cri de coeur from a Manhattan law firm that raised what the panel's chairman called "needlesome" questions about fashion, popular culture and sexual politics: Is it acceptable for female lawyers to wear pants suits in court?


Britain Is Accused on Iraqi 'Supergun'
New questions have been raised about what the British Government knew of Iraq's abortive efforts in the late 1980's to build a long-range cannon, after testimony before Parliament by a man who helped design the so-called supergun.
In an appearance before a House of Commons committee Wednesday, Christopher Cowley, who managed plans to build the launcher, said some British intelligence and defense officials had been aware of the project at least two years before customs officials seized British-made components for the weapon in 1990 because they violated export laws governing the sale of military equipment to Iraq.


Francis O'Neill, 83, U.S. Mediator Who Helped Settle Labor Disputes
Francis A. O'Neill Jr., who played a leading role in settling major airline and railroad strikes as a longtime member and chairman of the National Mediation Board, died Tuesday at Martin Memorial Hospital in Stuart, Fla., where he was visiting.
He was 83 years old and lived in Manasquan, N.J.
He died of natural causes, the funeral home said.


Carolco Reaches an Accord On Its Plan for Revamping
Carolco Pictures Inc. said today that it had reached a tentative agreement with its biggest foreign shareholders and its banks on a plan that would give the struggling Hollywood production company some financial breathing room.
The plan would provide Carolco with $45 million in new money, delay the repayment of existing bank loans and other obligations, and possibly allow additional bank loans.
Analysts said the package should permit Carolco to complete and release its next several movies, including "Basic Instinct," a thriller starring Michael Douglas.
But they said that unless these movies performed well, Carolco would once again face a financial crisis.


Salvadorans Sign Treaty to End the War
The Government of El Salvador and its guerrilla foes signed a comprehensive peace treaty here today, formally ending a 12-year civil war that turned their tiny Central American nation into the most violent theater of East-West conflict in the hemisphere.
Under the watch of world leaders whose presence reflected the shifting forces that helped bring years of negotiations to a close, the two sides pledged an end not only to the fighting that has left about 75,000 people dead, but also to the hatred that has fed its sometimes unspeakable brutality.

THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media; Democrats Press TV Campaigns to Reach New Hampshire Voters
The Democratic candidates are stepping up their campaigns to woo the voters of New Hampshire, battling it out on the airwaves with advertisements that hammer at the Republicans' management of the economy.
Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas continued his theme of help for the "forgotten middle class" with a second commercial that began appearing on television in New Hampshire today.


Volunteers or Not, Tennessee Lawyers Help Poor
So many natives signed up for the War of 1812 and the Alamo that Tennessee became known as "The Volunteer State." But at the Knox County courthouse these days, the proud tradition of Tennessee voluntarism is being sorely tried.
With the court docket clogged, the public defender's office swamped and the state's treasury depleted, every lawyer in the county has been ordered to represent the poor at no charge.
The notion of mandatory public service for lawyers has been bitterly debated by bar groups throughout the country and, some courts have ruled, is of dubious constitutionality.
But in Tennessee, a state so strapped for cash that it has grounded fleets of school buses, the judges are assigning first and asking questions later.


As Computers Track Drugs, Fears of Abuse Arise
In Oklahoma, every druggist who fills a prescription for Demerol, codeine or any of a dozen other potentially addictive drugs must punch it into a state computer network that keeps track of patients' and doctors' names.
The intention is to crack down on illegal trafficking in such drugs.
But the year-old law has set off a national debate over doctor-patient privacy and has prompted worries that the prescription data collected under the program could be used by employers, insurers and others to withhold health benefits or to make hiring decisions.


Witness Says Victim Had Hands in Air
Moments before he was fatally shot, 16-year-old Phillip Pannell was standing in a yard with his hands raised, a Teaneck resident testified today in the manslaughter trial of the Teaneck police officer accused of killing him.
The witness, Dorothy Robinson, a nurse's aide, said she heard the first of two shots fired at Mr.
Pannell as she left her home near the scene to visit a neighbor.

Lynne Cohen  P.P.O.W. Gallery 532 Broadway (near Spring Street) SoHo Through Feb. 8
The empty classrooms and government testing facilities that Lynne Cohen photographs are for the most past so bland or ugly, or simply utilitarian, that they tend to sink below notice.
But by presenting them in straightforward black-and-white prints, Ms.
Cohen functions as a kind of contemporary archeologist, uncovering the day-to-day life of a hidden civilization.
Judging from the architecture and decor of these rooms, the civilization is a strange one indeed.
Ms.
Cohen pays special attention to the ways in which these rooms and the objects in them are used to simulate real situations, whether in the hulking shapes of a flight simulator or the lined-up rows of test dummies in an automobile safety lab.
More than a few of these pictures are creepy and ironic at the same time.
Covering the walls of one classroom are wall charts, now obsolete, showing how to distinguish the uniforms of East German and Soviet soldiers.
In a photograph of a firing range, the viewer is confronted by two equally unappetizing figures, one a gunman, the other a door-to-door salesman.
Despite such flashes of deadpan humor, the work here seems stale, with too many pictures resembling warmed-over versions of Ms.
Cohen's own previous hits.


TV Weekend; 2 Dramas About Drugs, One Fact, One Fiction
On prime time, it's still the white hats against the black hats, only these days the cowboylike heroes are likely to be agents working for the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The villains, most of them dark skinned, are greedy and murderous foreigners.
This is the playing field of the United States' war on drugs, and it figures prominently in two television "entertainments" this weekend.
One is a factual documentary: "Undercover Eddie," the first installment in a six-part "D.E.A." series starting tonight at 9 (repeated at 1 A.M.) on the Arts &amp; Entertainment network.
The other is a four-hour movie mixing fact and fiction: "Drug Wars: The Cocaine Cartel," being broadcast on NBC Sunday and Monday night at 9.


ELECTION PROSPECT GROWING IN ISRAEL
Prospects for early Israeli elections increased today with the imminent departure of two right-wing parties from the governing coalition, but Government officials insisted that the political turmoil would have no effect on Israel's participation in Middle East peace talks.
"The peace process has to continue even after the crisis," Foreign Minister David Levy told reporters.
Aides to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir took pains to argue that the political uncertainty would have no effect on Mr.
Shamir's commitment to continue peace negotiations with the Arabs.


Review/Art; Alfredo Jaar's Work: 'Us' and 'Them'
Alfredo Jaar's art seems to be aimed at a big audience beyond the art world, an audience well versed in sophisticated materials, dramatic images and flawless execution and with little time for contemplation.
His efficient combinations of sleek Minimalist forms and big color photographs of beleaguered inhabitants of the third world are as glamorous as they are politically committed, and the experience they create is often fleeting and lightweight, too easily digested.
Mr.
Jaar, who was born in Chile in 1956 and has lived in New York since 1982, wants to make his viewers more conscious of the ties that bind the first world to the third, to show, as he has said, that the "widening gap between Us and Them" is "only a mental one." He also wants to distinguish among different third-world populations and predicaments.
The title of his exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, "1 Plus 1 Plus 1," refers to Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The 10 new pieces on view take the vistor to Brazil, to Lagos and to the barbed-wire gates of a Vietnamese refugee camp in Hong Kong.


Police Account Offers Details of Critical Moments
While exonerating the officers at the scene of the fatal City College crush, the Police Department's preliminary report was far harsher on the organizers of the event than a review by the Dinkins administration.
The police report included witnesses' assertions that the fatal stampede was triggered by two ticket-takers who fled their posts and that one of them later brandished a gun.
In a nine-page letter to Milton Mollen, the city's Deputy Mayor for Public Safety who prepared the administration's report, Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown provided a summary of the department's own investigation.
The letter, dated Jan. 10 and made public yesterday, included a detailed chronology, almost minute by minute, of the events leading up to and immediately after the deaths.


Luxe on the Menu: Softening Hard Times
LIFTON FADIMAN, the writer and editor, once remarked that when you have little money it is best to spend that little "on the unnecessary, the emotional dividends being higher." Certainly not the kind of advice your accountant would offer, but it carries a grain of logic.
More to the point, if you are scrimping in other parts of your life -- foregoing a vacation, a new car, home improvement -- a dining splurge can be a potent spiritual anodyne.


Stretch Run for the Neediest Aided by Large Contributions
The note scribbled on the sheet of yellow paper read like many others attached to contributions to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund: "I find I have extra to give away so I am sending you this additional check."
The difference was that this anonymous donor had previously given $50,000 and the "extra" was $100,000.
Together, they equal the largest gift received during the 80th annual appeal.
The Starr Foundation, a New York-based philanthropy, also gave $150,000.
Newman's Own, the food company owned by the actor Paul Newman, gave $100,000.


S.E.C. Sets $5 Million In Penalties
Completing the first leg of its sprawling investigation arising from the scandal at Salomon Brothers Inc., the Securities and Exchange Commission imposed fines today on 98 banks and Wall Street houses.
The move came after the institutions acknowledged that they had submitted scores of inflated bids in the debt markets of five Government-created organizations that raise money to lend to home buyers, students, farms and banks.
In bringing this part of the investigation to a prompt conclusion, the S.E.C. fined the banks and brokerages only about $5 million, or an average of $52,000.
The roster included many of the world's largest and most powerful financial companies, including all the nation's top banks and most of the key firms on Wall Street, as well as leading European and Japanese firms.
Salomon, which has undergone a tumultuous reorganization, remains under investigation by both the S.E.C. and the Justice Department and was not part of today's settlement.


Sounds Around Town
The Aquanettas
The Aquanettas and Jonathan Gregg and the Lonesome Debonaires, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, Manhattan, (212) 982-4052.
The Aquanettas are a kind of female Replacements: a sassy, sometimes sloppy four-piece group that writes fearless post-punk songs about smashing beer bottles on beach jetties and how it feels to walk into a party and see your least favorite ex-boyfriend standing in the corner.
Their lack of finesse is in direct proportion to their rock-and-roll passion -- they can bash out a three-chord anthem as though their souls depended on it.
Jonathan Gregg and the Lonesome Debonaires' debut album, "Blue on Blonde" (Jag Disc), is a catalogue of clever, countrified guitar-pop songs about being intellectual and lovelorn.
Tomorrow night at around 10:30.
Admission is $8.


There's Kleinman, Still Blocking the Plate
For all of his flamboyance and theatrics as the owner of the Yankees, George Steinbrenner has been unable to mimic Monty Hall and make the one deal that would begin discussions about his reinstatement to baseball.
He cannot persuade a longtime friend, Leonard Kleinman, to drop a $30 million lawsuit against Commissioner Fay Vincent and major league baseball.
Steinbrenner is thirsty to return to baseball, but Kleinman's lawsuit has been a mighty obstacle and the Yankees' chief operating officer is reluctant to drop it.


Art in Review
Glenn Goldberg  M. Knoedler &amp; Company 19 East 70th Street Through Jan. 30
If Paul Klee had designed video games, they would probably look something like Glenn Goldberg's work.
More than half of these oil-and-enamel-on-wood paintings are less than a foot high.
All have solid black or white grounds against which are isolated a few abstract forms made of dots and dashes of lively color and a good deal of decorative stippling.
The forms suggest many things -- watchful eyes, Christmas tree bulbs, funky little space stations chugging away through the void -- without relinquishing their own enigmatic identities.
Both because of its small size and the associations its images conjure up, the work might drop into preciousness if it got too pretty (a claylike elegance in this context would probably spell disaster), and the painter seems to know it.
He keeps his black surfaces bone dry, his white surfaces slightly scuffed, and the colored forms have a myopic, labor-intensive appearance, as if they had been painted flat on a kitchen table during late-night sittings.
The resulting intimacy shading into obsession provides the tension, and Mr.
Goldberg's vision of abstract painting as a game involving recombinations of bright cosmic bric-a-brac is an attractive proposition.


Defiant Breezes In Yacht Trials
The yacht Jayhawk appeared to be no match today for its younger sibling, Defiant, as the two met for the first time in the America's Cup defense trial races.
Both yachts, owned by William Koch's America 3 syndicate, crossed the start line on starboard tack, bow to bow.
But after nearly three hours of racing in 6- to 12-knot winds, Defiant crossed the finish ahead by 3 minutes 47 seconds.


Third Round of Mideast Talks Closes With Scant Progress
Israeli negotiators left Washington today, bringing to a close the third round of Arab-Israeli peace talks, where there was scant progress on substance and no agreement between the parties as to where or when to meet again.
In the last four days of talks in Washington, Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians finally overcame all of their procedural disputes over the shape of the table for their negotiations, but they failed to agree on an agenda for future discussions.
There was no movement at all in the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese talks, which continued to wander aimlessly.


Bobsled Trials Held Up For Appeals Court Ruling
The final trials to determine the United States Olympic team in bobsled, which were scheduled to begin today in Alternberg, Germany, were postponed yesterday, pending an appellate court's ruling that would establish who is eligible to compete.
The delay was imposed by the United States Bobsled Federation after a long day of legal maneuvers, starting with a ruling by a judge in the Supreme Court of New York State that effectively ended the chances of Willie Gault and Greg Harrell to make the team.


School Reform Should Begin With Society and the Family
To the Editor:
I very much enjoyed reading "Which Students Are Worst at Science?" (Science Times, Dec. 24) and felt many interesting and noteworthy issues were brought up.
One issue in particular was that of American society's role in education.


Astronomers Say Proof of Black Hole Theory Is Almost Within Their Grasp
Astronomers believe they are a measurement away from definitive proof of the existence of black holes, those central regions of some galaxies where matter would be so dense and the pull of gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, could escape from them.
Einstein's theory predicted black holes, and current astrophysical theory assumes that they exist, but the hunt for proof of their existence has been going on for two decades without clear success.


Hunting 2 Outlaws, They Find Skeletons
A team of forensic experts and historians has exhumed a pair of skeletons in Bolivia that may be those of two famous American outlaws, Butch Cassidy and "the Sundance Kid."
One of the expedition's members, Dan Buck of Washington, said a trail of documentary clues discovered in various parts of South America led the group last month to a cemetery in San Vicente, Bolivia, a remote mining village where the outlaws supposedly died in a 1907 gun battle.


Apple's Net Is Up 10.3% In Quarter
Spurred by sales of its new products, Apple Computer Inc. said today that net income for its first fiscal quarter increased 10.3 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
The Cupertino, Calif., personal computer company said net income for the three months ended Dec. 27 reached $166.0 million, or $1.36 a share, compared with $150.5 million, or $1.28 a share.
Revenues grew 10.7 percent, to $1.86 billion from $1.68 billion.


Critic's Choice/Film; Hellish Visions In High Style

A Festival of New Voices From a Changing Israel
New York City has seen a good many festivals of Israeli performing arts in the last few decades.
But "Israel: The Next Generation," which opens on Sunday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with a "Salute to Freedom" concert, is truly a festival with a difference.
Some of the theater, music and dance being presented in the next two weeks does refer to the past and to the kinds of folk traditions New Yorkers associate with previous Israeli festivals.
But the work has been filtered through very different contemporary sensibilities: those of second-generation Israelis, Arabs and immigrants from the former Soviet Union and from Ethiopa.
Performances will be given in five languages: English, Hebrew, Russian, Arabic and Amaharic, the language of Ethiopian Jews.


Manila Journal; Wow, It's 'Eee-mel-da!' Now Shopping for Votes
To some people, her name may be synonymous with greed and plunder and excess, but Imelda Marcos -- the new candidate for President of the Philippines, who calls herself "mother of the nation" -- is being greeted on stretches of the Philippine campaign trail as a resurrected hero.
It seems as if no one remembers, or cares, about all those shoes.


Angel Penna, 68, Race-Horse Trainer In U.S. and France
Angel Penna Sr., trainer of thoroughbred horses that won more than 250 stakes races in his 50-year career, died of cancer Wednesday at his home in Garden City, L.I.
He was 68 years old.
Mr.
Penna, born in Buenos Aires, was the eldest son of one of Argentina's leading trainers.
He saddled his first winner there in 1945.


Reins, but No Horses, for Civil Justice System

Reins, but No Horses, for Civil Justice System; Insurance Milkmen
To the Editor:
The suggestions for cheaper, faster civil justice set forth by Whitney North Seymour Jr. (Op-Ed, Jan. 7) overlook the obvious.
So long as insurance companies, who make up the overwhelming majority of litigants in New York State, are not required to pay pre-judgment interest, it will be to their advantage to litigate.
The lengthier the litigation becomes, the longer the period of time the insurance company has to float and invest money.
Their single greatest incentive is to delay the inevitable.


A Departure At Salomon
Thomas H. Hanley, one of Wall Street's leading bank stock analysts, said yesterday that he had left Salomon Brothers to join one of its top competitors, the First Boston Corporation.
The move came as the new Salomon Brothers management, led by Deryck Maughan, is cutting its research and trading in corporate stocks, a part of the company where profits were weak.
Mr.
Hanley, who is 47 years old, spent 24 years at Salomon.

Review/Dance; Doug Varone, At Home And at Sea
Doug Varone opened his program on Tuesday night in the Altogether Different festival at the Joyce Theater with a superb solo called "Nocturne." It was the sort of introduction to an artist's work that every audience should have.
Moving along a diffuse path of light to music by Chopin, Mr.
Varone seemed to be working out a dance in his head and on his body.
He would walk a few steps, then break into a lush little spiral or stretch his arms out and up in a knottily dramatic gesture.
His finger would move to his lips as he paused, deep in thought.
Then he would surge into a moment's jazzy lunge or pivot.
Dressed in a worn-looking sweat shirt, a hole visible under one arm, and sweat pants, his hair rumpled, he was at home, yet utterly lost.
Thought and gutsy, imaginative movement came together and were one with Mr.
Varone's clearly expressed theme.


Move Over, Messier: Broten Is Leading the Way
Paul Broten's usefulness had never been questioned by the Rangers this season: Crafty, careful, and dedicated to transforming himself into a small thorn in every opponent's side, he had always been an asset, albeit not a flamboyant goal-scorer.
That's why Broten was the first to laugh at the prospect of being allowed to zoom in unimpeded on Mike Vernon and take a penalty shot with 13 seconds left to play in the second period last night at Madison Square Garden.

Chief of Transit Officers Resigns After 21 Months
William J. Bratton, who as chief of the New York City Transit Police for the last 21 months had earned high marks as a manager and motivator, resigned yesterday to take the No. 2 position in the Boston Police Department.
New York police and transit officials said Chief Bratton had engineered a remarkable turnaround in the New York Transit Police during his brief tenure.
They credited him with increasing the department's morale, reducing the level of serious crimes in the subway and providing officers with new equipment and new strategies for policing the city's vast transit system.


Art in Review
Jack Pierson  Tom Cugliani Gallery 40 Wooster Street SoHo Through Feb. 29
Jack Pierson's first solo exhibition has a feeling of fresh, yet slightly jaded vulnerability, like a new talent in a B movie.
Casually installed, it offers washed-out color photographs pinned to the wall (a highway disappearing into the distance, a deserted beach, a dressing table in a cheap hotel room) and illegible scraps of black and white photographs (these a bit adolescent), also pinned to the wall.
Also on hand are three works that use found plastic letters from store signs to spell out extra-poignant words haphazardly.
In one piece, the letters of "Hopeless" and "Helpless" intersect; another says "Sexlessness" and a third simply pleads "Stay."
Effective as some of these pieces are, their primary function is to set the stage for Mr.
Pierson's many drawings, the best part of the exhibition.
These drawings center for the most part on fragmentary words and phrases written in blunt, angry print, in a suave cursive or in tiny letters that suggest set type.
Sometimes smudged and smeared, they speak repeatedly of longing, loneliness and failed love.
One resentfully announces "You went to Hollywood. I WENT TO HELL." In another the letters of "you" and "me," written repeatedly on top of each other, stack up in violent clusters.
They bring to mind both David Hockney and Jean Michel Basquiat, but their condensed and suggestive narratives seem to be very much Mr.
Pierson's own.

Dow Rally Ends With 8.95 Decline
Stock prices pulled back yesterday from their record levels in active, but choppy, trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 8.95 points to close at 3,249.55.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange grew to 336.2 million, from 312.8 million on Wednesday, making it the eighth-most-active day ever.
Trading was at its highest since Oct. 16, 1989, when volume totaled 416.3 million shares.


2 Convicted of Mail Fraud In Pet Burials
In a case that provoked impassioned outcries from pet lovers, the owners of a Long Island pet cemetery were convicted of mail fraud yesterday for dumping thousands of dead dogs and cats in mass graves and bilking thousands of people who had paid for dignified burials for their pets.
The cemetery owners, Samuel J. Strauss, 71 years old, and his son, Alan J., 36, were each found guilty of 45 counts of mail fraud, and are expected under Federal sentencing guidelines to be sentenced to at least six and a half years in prison, said Andrew J. Maloney, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.


Tests Halted on AIDS Drug Compared With AZT
A new drug being tested to treat people with AIDS is less effective than the standard one for many patients, the drug's manufacturer announced yesterday.
The company, Hoffmann-La Roche of Nutley, N.J., said it was halting its one-year study comparing its drug, dideoxycytidine, or DDC, to AZT, or azidothymidine, in patients who had not previously used AZT or had used it for fewer than three months.
There were fewer deaths among those who received AZT in the study, the company said.


Sounds Around Town
Dizzy's Horn
Dizzy Gillespie, Dizzy's United Nation, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Manhattan, (212) 475-8592.
The band is filled out by five Americans including the drummer Charli Persip and the trombonists Doug Purviance and Steve Turre.
United Nation, formed in 1988, has toured widely overseas during the past four years.
Mr.
Gillespie and the band play tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 9 and 11:30.
There is a $35 music charge and a $5 minimum at tables or $20 admission to the bar.
Davern Quartet
Kenny Davern Quartet, the Church of the Heavenly Rest, Fifth Avenue at 90th Street, Manhattan, (212) 752-1428.
The clarinetist Kenny Davern has carved out an unusual niche for himself in jazz.
From the often stereotyped world of Dixieland, he has developed an approach that acknowledges that background and even reflects one of its great individualists, PeeWee Russell, but has a powerful and original cast of its own.
On Sunday at 5 P.M., Mr.
Davern will lead a quartet that includes the versatile guitarist Howard Alden, with Frank Tate on bass and Tony De Nicola on drums, in a concert that is part of the Heavenly Jazz series.
Tickets are $10 ($7 for students and seniors).


The Art Market
Paintings by Australians
Behind-the-scenes maneuvering for major works of art has always been a way of life for auction houses and dealers.
But in this bleak season, when so few good collections are up for grabs, the competition is especially heated.
This week, three plum collections -- one of a celebrated collector, featuring works by Australian artists, another of Old Master paintings and decorative objects, and a third comprised of contemporary art -- have caused quite a scramble.
By far the juiciest is the group of paintings and sculptures belonging to Alan Bond, the bankrupt Australian industrialist who became a famous figure in the art world five years ago when he borrowed $27 million from Sotheby's to buy van Gogh's "Irises" for $53.9 million, at that point the largest amount ever paid for a painting. (The painting has since been bought by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.)


A New Battle Is Ahead for Powell: The Budget
As Gen.
Colin L. Powell revises American military policy to fit a world without the Soviet Union, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is running into strong Congressional pressure to cut deeper and faster into the Pentagon budget than he would like.
Democratic leaders in Congress have already made clear that reducing money for a few weapons systems while leaving the basic Pentagon budget intact in the 1993 fiscal year will not be acceptable.
But so far that appears to be the kind of effort General Powell has in mind for the budget that Congress will start considering next month and that will become effective on Oct. 1.


Pop/Jazz; Lou Barlow Opts for Quiet After Dinosaur's Hullabaloo
Lou Barlow didn't mean to start a band called Sebadoh, the group that is to perform tonight at CBGB.
As he tells it, "it just turned out that we had to be a band after a while."
In 1985, Mr.
Barlow was already in a band, Dinosaur Jr., that was a major draw on the American college circuit and was worshiped in England for its combination of introverted lyrics and hard-rock laced with screaming guitar solos.
But when he wasn't playing bass with Dinosaur Jr., Mr.
Barlow was trading homemade tapes with Eric Gaffney.
The two collaborated on quiet songs that were far removed from Dinosaur's sonic barrage, blending the confessional candor of songwriters like Joni Mitchell with the self-protective irony of collegiate rock.
Mr.
Barlow played most of his songs on a guitar with two strings removed, which is still his main instrument.


Musical Humor
The Gregg Smith Singers will give a concert of music with humorous texts tomorrow at 8 P.M. at St.
Peter's Church, on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street in Manhattan.
On the program are the world premiere of Jack Beeson's "Magicke Pieces," the New York premieres of Gian Carlo Menotti's "Moans, Groans, Cries and Sighs" and Dennis Riley's "Beastly Conceits," and works by Mozart, Schoenberg, Bernstein, Rick Sowash and Mr.
Smith.
Tickets are $15.
Information: (212) 874-2990.


For Children
'Harmony Castle' The Puppet Company Metro Lounge, Metropolis Cafe 31 Union Square West, at 16th Street Manhattan (212) 741-1646 Recommended ages: 2 to 8 Through April 26


Seeking Voter Reward, Bush Still Predicts Fall of Hussein
Facing criticism of a Persian Gulf policy that President Bush hopes will help catapult him to re-election, the White House today offered new predictions of President Saddam Hussein's downfall and proclaimed the war a "tremendous victory."
"We can all take pride in the results of that effort," Mr.
Bush said in a written statement marking the passage of one year since he ordered the bombing against Iraqi forces in Kuwait.


Elkington and Lancaster Share a One-Shot Lead
Steve Elkington has never been accused of being the most ambitious player on the PGA Tour, but after winning the year's first event, he has decided to get greedy this week at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
Elkington, who won the Tournament of Champions in a playoff with Brad Faxon last Sunday, shot a six-under-par 66 at Indian Wells Country Club today and shared the 36-hole lead with a journeyman, Neal Lancaster, at 11-under-par 133.


A Magazine On Selling
Selling magazine, a publication for salespeople, will start in the spring, it was announced yesterday by Whittle Communications L.P. and Jim Martay and Marjorie Weiss, co-founders of In Heath magazine.
Selling, which will publish 10 times a year, will be sold to corporations to distribute among their sales staffs.
It will be aimed at the 15 million people who sell for a living.


Texas G.O.P. Wins on Redistricting
The United States Supreme Court refused today to block a redistricting plan for the Texas Legislature, giving Republicans their best chance in more than a century to win control of the State Senate.
The decision means that the state's primary elections will go forward March 10 under a redistricting plan drawn by a panel of three Federal judges appointed by a Republican President rather than under a map approved by the Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, said Texas Attorney General Dan Morales.


Richard G. Denzer, Ex-Prosecutor And New York Judge, Dies at 80
Richard G. Denzer, a longtime prosecutor who helped rewrite New York State's penal laws, died on Wednesday while on a family visit in Kensington, Md.
He was 80 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Boca Raton, Fla.
He died of cancer, his family said.


Top New York Court Overturns Pay Deferral for State Workers
New York State's highest court ruled yesterday that Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature acted unconstitutionally when they required employees of the state's court system to defer part of their wages two years ago.
The unanimous decision by the Court of Appeals in Albany applied only to court workers, but groups representing state employees immediately asserted that the same reasoning would ultimately apply to their lawsuit against a much larger wage deferral, known as a lag payroll, that the Governor and lawmakers imposed on nearly all state workers last year.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo; Quintessential Insiders Put on Airs of Outsiders
Caveat New Hampshire.
There are two Republicans wandering around your state claiming that they disdain everything Washington stands for, that they are fed up with everyone who runs the city and that they would like to boot out all those colluding, golf-playing, inside-the-Beltway bums.


Winter's Armoryful Of Antiques
FOR some, winter's blasts inspire thoughts of warm beaches.
For others, they inspire thoughts of antiques, particularly of the annual mammoth Winter Antiques Show (actually, it's more a spectacle) at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan.
This year's show has drums and a doorway, folk art and photographs, mechanical banks and Apostle spoons, just about anything a lover of old things, especially old and odd things, could want.
A report by Rita Reif is on page C26.


The Squabbling Resumes Over Roosevelt Raceway
Once the nation's premier harness racing track, Roosevelt Raceway stands vacant now, the paint on its bleachers cracking, its turf in disarray, a decaying symbol of a developer's ambition and what state investigators called government mismanagement.
But now that a state inquiry into the publicly financed sale of the raceway has ended, the same government officials and developers are at war over the future of the 172-acre site, the largest stretch of undeveloped land in Nassau County.


From The Publisher
It has been four generations since Adolph S. Ochs laid down the precepts that have successfully guided The New York Times for 96 years.
Those principles have been carried forward with distinction by my grandfather, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; my uncle, Orvil E. Dryfoos, and my father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.
Each of these men, in their message upon being named Publisher, quoted the pledge Mr.
Ochs made when he took the helm of The Times:
To give the news impartially, without  fear or favor, regardless of any party,  sect or interest involved.


The Larger Crime
In recent days, New Yorkers have been disgusted by several particularly repulsive crimes.
A black brother and sister were attacked by four young white men and squirted with a white liquid.
A 15-year-old white girl was raped by a black man.
An 11-year-old boy was abducted and raped by a man who says he has the AIDS virus.
Each crime cries out for rapid police response and public condemnation.
But one thing these crimes are not is connected.
They are not all racial crimes, sex crimes, ethnic crimes.
To weave them, as some New Yorkers do, into a sort of tapestry of terror is not only wrong but perverse.
That commits a larger crime of fomenting exaggerated fears.


China, in Shift, Accepts U.S. Shipping Concerns
China agreed today to allow two American companies to compete directly with Chinese rivals in shipping the nation's cargo, resolving a longstanding dispute over market access.
The Chinese concession, which comes at a time of mounting trade frictions between Washington and Beijing, is expected to facilitate trade with China and perhaps reduce transportation costs.
It also is the first time that foreign companies will operate wholly owned subsidiaries in China's transportation business and directly compete with Chinese rivals.


University of Bridgeport Plans Takeover by Sacred Heart
The University of Bridgeport said today that it has decided on a plan to have all its programs, including its law school, taken over by Sacred Heart University in Fairfield.
But the announcement set up a confrontation between the financially troubled University of Bridgeport and its law school that could undermine not only the agreement with Sacred Heart, but also the law school's own accreditation.

Car Linked to Rape Is Found in Brooklyn
The stolen rental car that the police said two men used to abduct and rape a 15-year-old girl on Tuesday was found yesterday in Bushwick, a largely residential, high-crime area in north Brooklyn.
Two officers who were handing out sketches of the suspects found the four-door white Toyota Camry just before noon, parked on Bushwick Avenue between Furman and Granite Streets, said a police spokesman, Sgt.
Peter Berry.
The car and its license plate number, ZNY143, matched the description that the victim had given to the police.


War of Hams Where the Stage Is All
HAM actors may be a horror, but fine actors playing ham actors are almost always a joy.
Brian Bedford, cast as the 19th-century British tragedian William Charles Macready in Richard Nelson's new play, "Two Shakespearean Actors," is no exception.
Very grand, often pickled and prone to forgetting the end of any sentence well before he has made it to the verb, Mr.
Bedford's puffed-up Macready would be right at home in the hapless theatrical companies of "Nicholas Nickleby," "The Dresser" and "Noises Off." Even his version of the actor's nightmare is egomaniacal: when Macready dreams this dream, he does not forget his lines but instead plays all the parts at once.
Mr.
Bedford, a British actor who has been a mainstay of Broadway and Stratford, Ontario, over a 30-odd-year stage career, pours a lifetime of both classical and boulevard-comedy experience into this role.
In Mr.
Nelson's play, Macready is a tired, fading figure who arrives to perform "Macbeth" in the New York City of 1849 only to find his supremacy challenged by a younger local upstart, the first great American Shakespearean, Edwin Forrest (Victor Garber), who is performing his own "Macbeth" elsewhere in town.
It's an ugly situation.
A symbolic target for enraged nationalistic forces beyond his comprehension, Macready suffers the indignity of less-than-full houses, a pelting with stones and, finally, a full-scale Anglophobic riot that leaves more than a score dead outside the Astor Place Opera House.


Money Fund Assets Up
The assets of the nation's 588 money market mutual funds increased by $9.19 billion, to $499.32 billion, in the week that ended on Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.
The assets of the 218 institutional funds increased by $5.33 billion, to $174.33 billion; the assets of the 281 general-purpose funds were up by $1.77 billion, to $178.07 billion, and the 89 broker-dealer funds increased by $2.08 billion, to $146.92 billion, the institute said.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Almanac; New Hampshire Profile

Tickets may be purchased at the door.


Economic Scene; A Time of Peril For World Trade
PRESIDENT BUSH took a beating on his trade mission to Japan, and Japan got off lightly.
Instead of conveying the picture of a determined leader fighting to safeguard an open world economy, Mr.
Bush appeared to be pleading for Japanese mercy -- especially for the suffering American auto industry.
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa responded by saying Japan would show "compassion."
Japan agreed to double imports of American auto parts from $7 billion last year to $15 billion in 1994, and to import 20,000 American cars, although it appeared that most of these cars would come from Japanese manufacturers in the United States.


Macy's Again Avoids the 'B' Word
By delaying payments this month to its 20,000 suppliers in deference to its bankers, R. H. Macy &amp; Company once again crossed a tightrope that many financial and retailing experts see suspended above bankruptcy court.
The venerable New York retail company certainly satisfied its lenders by not tapping its credit lines to send on-time payments to those who make its dresses, suits and housewares.
But the move also shed a new, unfavorable light on just how much of a financial bind Macy appears to be in as the year unfolds.
If nothing else, the two-week payment delay brought into sharper focus Macy's need to borrow for some routine operations.


50 Candles for Ali: Let Them Glow Awhile
Muhammad Ali is 50 years old today, which surprises me.
I never thought he would become middle-aged, certainly not fat and slow and patronized, adored in the way elderly former pin-up girls are adored for evoking a time when we had the hot blood to want to be them or have them.
In that dazzling time when his beauty, his skill, his outrageousness, made Ali worshiped and feared, I thought that if he survived the controversies he illuminated, he would become a major actor of our times, an elder, a peacemaker.
I remember the moment I first began to have such grand thoughts.
The photograph helps.
It was Feb. 26, 1964, the morning after he won the heavyweight championship.
His name was still Cassius Clay, although Malcolm X's presence in Miami Beach made credible the rumors that he had joined the Lost-Found Nation of Islam and would soon change his name.
He had already brought African-American style back into the world sports arena.
But at this morning-after press conference, he was subdued, modest, almost, incredibly, boring.
In the picture, many sportswriters are already looking toward the right, where the beaten Sonny Liston was being incredibly amiable.


P.R. Firm Had No Reason to Question Kuwaiti's Testimony
To the Editor:
In "Remember Nayirah, Witness for Kuwait?" (Op-Ed, Jan. 6), John R. MacArthur disingenuously attacks Congressional testimony given by an eyewitness to Iraqi brutality in Kuwait and suggests that Hill and Knowlton concealed her identity to mislead the American public.


Prices Down, Optimism Up for Antiques Show
"Welcome to my fantasy garden," said Thomas K. Woodard, a folk-art dealer, standing by a weathered 10-foot-high doorway dominating his booth at the Winter Antiques Show in the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan.
The archway, as intricately carved and pierced with scrolls and leaves as a giant paper doily, is a century-old frame for the front door of a New England house, he said.
On either side of this doorway, Mr.
Woodard placed two English 19th-century garden urns of fired clay and filled them with freeze-dried strawberries, artichokes and gardenias.
"I'm a hopeless romantic -- or a hopeful romantic when it comes to gardens," he said.


No Headline
Television and radio news, listings and advertising appear on pages B14-15.


Islanders Bar Patrick's Cellar Door
It was their last game before the All-Star break, a battle to stay out of the basement between the last-place Philadelphia Flyers and the Islanders, who hold fifth place in the Patrick Division.
When it ended in a 4-3 victory for the home team at Nassau Coliseum, the Islanders had increased their lead over Philadelphia to 3 points and had provided another showcase for two of their recent heroes.


Corrections

Two Sides in Conflict Celebrate Separately In Downtown Plaza
The church bells of El Salvador rang out around the country today to herald the end to civil war, but the two sides celebrated separately in downtown plazas of the capital.
Liberty Plaza was decorated in banners of blue and white, the national colors, to await the triumphal nighttime return of President Alfredo Cristiani from the signing of peace accords in Mexico City.


4 Executives Are Given New Posts at Bechtel
Bechtel Group Inc., the big San Francisco construction company, yesterday named three executives, including a member of the founding family, to head three of its main operating companies.
It also said it would transfer a senior executive to Europe in an effort to drum up new business there.
Gary Bechtel, 41, was appointed president of the Bechtel Civil Company, which works on transportation, water resources projects, buildings and other civil engineering projects.
He replaces Bob Polvi, who is retiring.


Diner's Journal
Grappino
In the garment district of midtown Manhattan, just south of 42d Street, good lunch spots are harder to find than Nehru jackets.
So when an attractive Italian restaurant on West 39th Street was recommended recently, I scooted down for lunch.
The four-year-old Grappino has a clean, generic northern-Italian-restaurant look, with pale yellow walls that appear pinkish under colored ceiling lights, long banquettes and tightly packed tables.
At a recent lunch, the dining room was crowded and so noisy that waiters had to bend over to communicate with diners.
A starter of grilled shrimp, fennel and tomato sprinkled with balsamic vinegar was fresh and tasty ($8).
So was a grilled vegetable plate holding tiny sweet carrots, zucchini, eggplant, cauliflower, mushrooms and goat cheese ($6.50).
Entrees include pastas, grilled chicken, seafood and steak.
The penne with radicchio, broccoli, mild sausage, roasted peppers and olive oil ($15) was well balanced and skillfully cooked.
Grilled swordfish was pleasing, too, with a garnish of orange sections, pine nuts, fennel and basil ($18).
Other entrees include grilled breast of chicken with arugula, tomato and pesto mayonnaise ($8); cavitelli with eggplant, hot peppers and tomato ($8), and sirloin steak with tomato, black olives and Tuscan-style bread ($15).
Recommended for dessert are the moist, minimally sweet mascarpone cheesecake ($5) and an apple crostade, a strudel-like apple tart ($6).
Grappino, at 38 West 39th Street, is open Monday through Friday, serving lunch from noon to 3 P.M. and dinner from 5 to 9 P.M.
American Express is accepted.
Telephone: (212) 398-0350.
The Changing Scene
CLOSED: Auntie Yuan, the elegant Chinese restaurant at 1191A First Avenue, near 64th Street, Manhattan.
David Keh, the owner, said a drop in business forced the closing of the restaurant, which he had turned over to a managing partner seven months ago.
"These are not the times to have a restaurant like Auntie Yuan," he said.
At the same time, Mr.
Keh said he has secured the lease to the former Fortune Garden Pavilion at 209 East 49th Street, Manhattan, where he plans to open a Chinese noodle restaurant in mid-March.
OPEN: May We, a Mediterranean-style restaurant at 1022 Lexington Avenue, at 73d Street, (212) 249-0200. . . .
C III, a casual American restaurant in the Washington Square Hotel, 103 Waverly Place, Manhattan, (212) 254-1200.
The chef is Daniel Kobin, formerly of Dano in Greenwich Village. . . .
Country Club, a supper club featuring American cuisine and big-band music, at 210 East 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 879-8400.
NEW CHEF: Richard Krause, the former chef of Rose Cafe on Fifth Avenue at 16th Street in Manhattan, is the new chef at Rex, the restaurant and nightclub at 579 Avenue of the Americas, at 16th Street, Manhattan.
Telephone: (212) 741-0080.


Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Passes Times Publisher's Post to Son
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive officer of The New York Times Company and for 29 years publisher of The New York Times, relinquished the publisher's title yesterday to his son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.
As publisher, Mr.
Sulzberger Jr. will oversee all aspects of the newspaper, including its editorial-page policy.
He will report to the elder Mr.
Sulzberger, 65 years old, who intends to continue active participation in the overall company day to day as chairman and chief executive.


Gibbs Is Gearing Up for Game and Race
While most of the Washington Redskins are immersed in preparations for Super Bowl XXV, their coach, Joe Gibbs, has the Daytona D on his mind as well.
Gibbs took time off in Washington yesterday to meet with reporters on the Charlotte Motor Speedway Media Tour in a satellite hookup to the track in Charlotte, N.C.

Shift in Rockefellers At Family Enterprise
Rockefeller Financial Services Inc., the main corporate entity in the Rockefeller family's business empire, announced yesterday that David Rockefeller Jr. had been elected to replace his father as chairman of the company.
The move is another significant step in the Rockefeller family's efforts to pull together its various enterprises and ventures under one corporate roof.
With the extended family now having about 100 members, some leading members have been concerned that until recently there was no formal plan for managing and preserving the multibillion-dollar fortune.


Cambridge Loses
The N.C.A.A.
Eligibility Committee denied a second appeal by suspended Texas basketball player DEXTER CAMBRIDGE on Thursday, possibly ending the senior forward's college career.
Cambridge played in Texas' first four games while under a temporary restraining order and hasn't played since.
He was suspended in November for accepting a $7,000 check from a Lon Morris Junior College booster in 1990.
It was alleged that Cambridge, who transferred to the University of Texas last season, received the money as a reward for being named a junior college All-American.

At the Mike: Harwell
The Detroit Tigers may have figured that 73 was too old and 32 years was long enough, but CBS Radio apparently uses a different formula.
The network announced yesterday that ERNIE HARWELL, the deposed Tigers broadcaster, had been hired as the lead announcer for one of its two weekly Saturday games of the week.
Harwell, who will turn 74 next Saturday, will work with a rotation of sidekicks while calling 26 night games during the season.

Reins, but No Horses, for Civil Justice System; Client Self-Protection
To the Editor:
Here is a true story that confirms the wisdom of the first of Whitney North Seymour Jr.'s recommendations for improving justice in New York ("Cheaper, Faster Civil Justice," Op-Ed, Jan. 7).
Mr.
Seymour urges the courts to adopt rules that encourage early settlement.


3 Lawmakers Press to Keep Weapons Reactor Shut
Democratic and Republican members of the South Carolina Congressional delegation urged Energy Secretary James D. Watkins today to keep an old reactor at the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant shut down until new safety measures are taken and the Energy Department prepares a study justifying a need to start it.
The call to slow the Energy Department's aggressive program for restarting the 37-year-old reactor, near Aiken, S.C., came today in a letter to Mr.
Watkins that was signed by three of South Carolina's eight members of Congress: Senator Ernest F. Hollings and Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrats who are members, respectively, of the Senate and House Armed Services Committee, and Representative Arthur Ravenel Jr., a Republican.

BUSH WOULD TRIM TAX FOR FAMILIES OVER $50,000 LEVEL
The income-tax cut President Bush plans to propose this month would make families with incomes of more than about $50,000 the biggest winners, drawing a new line in his election year battle with the Democrats over who can develop the more attractive tax breaks for the middle class.
The Democrats, in Congress and on the Presidential campaign trail, have not found a tax policy they can all support, but most of their proposals aim lower on the income ladder than the President's.


On Stage, and Off
A Move for 'Grand Hotel'
For weeks now, theater people have been waiting for the final showdown between Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, and the co-producers of "Grand Hotel: The Musical." The stakes are high.
Jujamcyn owns the Martin Beck, where the long-running Tommy Tune show is playing.
It wanted to book Jerry Zaks's much-anticipated revival of "Guys and Dolls" into the Beck for an April opening, but "Grand Hotel" just kept on running.
It still will, moving to the Gershwin Theater on Feb. 3 after playing its final performance at the Beck on Jan. 27.
Which means "Guys and Dolls," at long last, will have a home.
One reason "Grand Hotel" has lasted so long is that until recently "Grand Hotel" and Jujamcyn had never negotiated what is known as a stop clause, a standard practice on Broadway.
It means that if a show makes less money than a mutually agreed-on figure for two weeks in a row, the theater owner has the right to evict the show.
But in this economy, most theater owners are flexible.
Martin Richards, a co-producer of "Grand Hotel," says: "We never had a stop clause because Rocco Landesman offered us everything but the ownership of the theater to get our booking. He never wanted to discuss a stop clause until 'Guys and Dolls' wanted our house." Mr.
Richards says the ensuing negotiations were heated, and he maintains that during the talks Jujamcyn stopped printing tickets for the show at the box office, violating an agreement that tickets remain on sale for 13 weeks in advance.
"Rocco said that 'Grand Hotel' might run another year but 'Guys and Dolls' could run three years," Mr.
Richards recalls.
"How does he know that? Does he have a crystal ball?"
Mr.
Richards also says Mr.
Landesman promised to contribute $100,000 toward the $300,000 cost of moving the show, "but now he seems to have amnesia." James Nederlander, the owner of the Gershwin, will pay $200,000 toward the move and Mr.
Richards will pay the rest.
Mr.
Nederlander says he plans to mount a London production of "Grand Hotel" and tour it through Europe.
Mr.
Landesman refused to address any of Mr.
Richards's charges.
"I've been at Jujamcyn for four and a half years, and my integrity will have to stand on its own," he says.
"I wish them the best of luck at the Gershwin." Economizing on Tony Tickets
When Tony Randall envisioned a National Actors Theater, it seems that nothing so crass and commercial as a Tony Award was part of the picture.
His company is presenting its second show of the season, Georges Feydeau's "Little Hotel on the Side," at the Belasco Theater, a Broadway house, but, as with "The Crucible," the 700 Tony voters are not invited.
That means that none of the company's productions can be nominated for best revival, although the actors and designers are still eligible, says Harvey Sabinson, the executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, which sets the Tony rules with the American Theater Wing.
But what good are nominations in any category if no one has seen the performances to vote on them?
Any nonprofit company, especially a brand-new one, needs to raise money strenuously in these times.
Even if it is not interested in the commercial benefits that a Tony Award brings to other Broadway shows, wouldn't a Tony go a long way toward impressing potential donors?
Manny Kladitis, the general manager of the National Actors Theater, says that because subscribers hold 51 percent of the tickets for each show's seven-week run, the company cannot afford to give each Tony voter the customary pair of free tickets.
But Todd Haimes, the managing director of the Roundabout Theater, the other nonprofit company reviving classics in a Tony-eligible house, says his theater does invite voters.
He has found room for them in his seven-week runs, which are 80 percent subscribed in a theater roughly half the size of the Belasco.
One producer who spoke on condition of anonymity says other Broadway managements resent Mr.
Randall's brand of economizing.
The perception is that he has used Broadway's cachet for all his publicity without extending to the Tony voters the basic courtesies that other shows do.
A spokesman for the National Actors Theater says Mr.
Randall's comment was that the company cannot afford to make Tony seats available.
Just Two Sisters?
No Performance
The 1,100 people who showed up to see the star-studded cast of "The Three Sisters" at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., on Sunday had quite a surprise at 2 P.M., when the curtain was to go up.
The show's director, Emily Mann, went onstage to announce that the performance was being canceled.
Mary Stuart Masterson, the actress playing the third sister, Irina, had the flu.
She does not have an understudy, and neither do her co-stars, Linda Hunt, Frances McDormand, Laura San Giacomo and Edward Herrmann.
Since most of the other performances were already sold out, this audience was offered the chance to reschedule for 10:30 A.M.
Thursday or the evening of Super Bowl Sunday.
You can imagine the reaction.
"Most regional theaters don't have understudies," says David Mayhew, the director of marketing for the McCarter.
"The expense involved for runs of only a few weeks is too high. Once a show opens here, we only have 15 performances left. Up until opening night, we only have time to rehearse the main cast, so even if we had had the understudies, they wouldn't have been rehearsed."
Mr.
Mayhew says Ms.
Masterson returned for the next scheduled show on Wednesday night.
Dedications to Papp
With the opening last night of Richard Nelson's "Two Shakespearean Actors" at the Cort Theater, at least three dedications to the late producer Joseph Papp are now to be found in Playbills around town.
" 'Two Shakespearean Actors' is dedicated to the memory of Joseph Papp, who, for 35 years, served Shakespeare, the theater and New York in full and generous measure," it reads.


A New Loss At Security Pacific Seen
The Security Pacific Corporation said today that it expected to lose about $400 million in the fourth quarter, its second consecutive hefty loss.
Officials at the BankAmerica Corporation said the new loss would not deter it from going ahead with its acquisition of Security Pacific.
"That was all in line with our expectations," Frank N. Newman, BankAmerica's vice chairman and chief financial officer, said at a news briefing here today.
BankAmerica reported its own earnings for the fourth quarter of $285 million, roughly equal to the $287 million reported a year earlier.


U.S. and China Reach Accord on Copying
The United States and China struck a deal this evening intended to provide greater protection for American pharmaceuticals, computer software, books and music recordings against illegal copying in China.
China essentially agreed to adopt most international standards for foreign inventions, and will enact laws that extend the duration and scope of patent, copyright and trade-secret protections.

Movies Don't Cause Crime
Time was, when a crime was committed the victim wanted the criminal punished.
Now victims may be given an opportunity to see how profitable their pain can be.
Take the Pornography Victims' Compensation Act, under consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
It would allow a rape victim to sue -- not the rapist -- but the producers and distributors of "obscene" videos that the rapist had viewed.
The committee has heard expert testimony on the bill, and may vote on it next month.
It is sponsored by Republican Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Charles Grassley of Iowa.


30-Year Bond Off More Than Point
Long-term interest rates rose for the sixth straight session yesterday, as credit market participants sold Treasury bonds and long-term notes despite additional evidence that inflationary pressures are very tame.
Prices were off sharply, with the benchmark 30-year bond down more than a point.
That pushed its yield up to 7.66 percent, compared with 7.57 percent late on Wednesday.


Art in Review
Mel Chin Queens Museum of Art Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Through Feb. 2
The 17 works in Mel Chin's show (organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis) include paintings, installations and works on paper, but it is the sculpture that proves of interest.
Generally speaking, the simpler it is the better.
In "Forgetting Tiananmen, Kent State, Tlatelolco," reeds of dried flowers have been embedded in slabs of cast stone and then chipped free as if exhumed.
The work honors specific individuals, but it is also a metaphor for suppressed history brought to light.
"The Sigh of the Cross" is more complicated.
It consists of an enormous upright sickle with a jagged blade, a rope stretched down its length and a box with a faded scarlet cross punctured by the tip of the sickle.
A wall text reveals in great detail that it symbolizes the expulsion of the Red Cross from drought-stricken Ethiopia by the Mengistu Haile Mariam Government in 1988.
This explanation has the effect of changing the piece almost instantly from an esthetic object to a didactic puzzle in which every material component assumes a precise and predetermined role.
Whether this calculated perceptual shift expands or narrows the often overt programmed works in the show is debatable.
In the case of "The Sigh of the Cross," vitality drains away from the sculpture in direct proportion to the intricacy of the scenario imposed upon it.
The issue raised here -- how sculpture and political content can coexist -- is one with which artists in the 1990's will continue to struggle.
Mr.
Chin's is an honorable attempt at an answer, but it leaves the question open.


Will the Real Bills' Defense Stand Up in the Super Bowl?
The Buffalo Bills' defense has spent the last eight weeks apologizing for the statistics posted in the first eight weeks of the regular season.
And no matter how often the Bills point to crucial injuries as the reason, they find themselves heading for the Super Bowl still trying to explain the numbers.
Even after a convincing defensive performance in a 10-7 victory over Denver in the American Football Conference title game, in which Bills linebacker Carlton Bailey scored the team's only touchdown on an 11-yard interception return, Buffalo's defense is still haunted by its statistics.
The legacy of the early failings resulted in Buffalo's defense finishing the season ranked next to last in the National Football League in total defense, yielding an average 341.1 yards per game.


Art in Review
Peter Greenaway  Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery 51 Greene Street SoHo Through Jan. 25
Peter Greenaway, the British film director, has found what to do with his old scripts: he turns them into art.
For the works here, Mr.
Greenaway took pages from a first draft of a script that, he writes in a wall label, might be the basis for a sequel to his current film, "Prospero's Books." Each page describes one of the creatures that Prospero found or created on his magic island, from juggler to simpleton to pedant to pimp.
Many of the typed pages have been scribbled over with notes, presumably added before they were relegated to the status of drawing paper.
Mr.
Greenaway has subsequently applied postal stickers, scraps of photographs, items cut out of newspapers, daubs of paint and stenciled letters and numbers, among other things, to the pages.
The resulting collages are as smart, arcane and occasionally cryptic as his films.
On the page devoted to a minotaur he has drawn a maze, at the center of which is a torn snapshot of a Roman inscription.
The entry for a "cartographical clerk" features a grid of pink, yellow and white brush strokes that suggests a map, while a small mirror is pasted onto the page that describes an exhibitionist.
As in his films, Mr.
Greenaway sets up playful games of meaning in these collages, producing works in which words, images and found elements mesh in strongly evocative combinations.


Restaurants
Il Nido has the self-assurance of an institution that has been around forever, even though it is just 12 years old.
The reason could be the traditional Tuscan decor, the seasoned waiters or even the menu, which offers a long roster of Italian standards.
Dining at Il Nido is like listening to a beloved grandfather tell the same stories over and over again: the stories themselves may cease to be exhilarating, but they are told with such elan that they are still arresting.
One goes to Il Nido for comfort, pampering and refinement, all of which come at a price.
The soothing setting includes plaster walls crisscrossed by timber beams, brown leather banquettes and well-appointed tables.
The noise is muted even when the two main dining rooms are full.
Adi Giovannetti, the kinetic owner and wine aficionado, adds a personal touch while buzzing around the restaurant as if he were on roller skates.


Blue Cross Asks 26% Rise for Some Customers
Warning that it might run out of money by the middle of this year, New York State's largest health insurer has asked the State Insurance Department for permission to raise by an average of 26 percent the rates it charges to more than one million customers.
The increase requested yesterday by Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield would affect the 1.2 million customers who are insured under what are called small group major medical plans and those with individual insurance policies, including Medicare supplemental policies.
The increase would not affect the company's 7.1 million customers whose insurance plans cover 50 people or more.


Shot! Savor. Davidson's Day Never Ends.
It's Hockey Night in John Davidson's Armonk house.
The National Hockey League All-Star Game is only days away.
But the MSG Network's Rangers analyst is a bit down.
Only four games are scheduled.
Only four games to watch.
There's nothing like a good hockey game after a good hockey game for the former Rangers goalie.
"I came home last night after the Rangers-Sabres game, and watched the San Jose-Los Angeles game," he says.


BUSINESS DIGEST
Companies
The S.E.C. fined 98 banks and Wall Street houses after they acknowledged that they had submitted inflated bids in the debt markets of five government-created organizations that raise money to lend to home buyers, students, farms and banks.  [ Page D1. ]


Mets Want Magadan to Take Pay Cut
The Mets, who have signed one free agent after another to generous and even historic contracts during the off season, got off to a more controversial start yesterday in the delicate business of salary arbitration.
They requested that Dave Magadan take a pay cut from his 1991 salary, something clubs have done infrequently in arbitration.
The Mets had filed early for arbitration with Magadan and their offer of $1,187,500 yesterday represents a 5 percent cut for the infielder, who got $1.25 million last season.
Magadan, whose average fell from .328 in 1990 to .258 in 1991 before his season was cut short by surgery to repair cartilage damage in both shoulders, submitted a salary request of $1.6 million.


Racing to Learn to Speak English
It is a universal complaint of children that their parents don't speak their language.
That may never be more true than it is for the children of immigrants.
And that is why learning English is a race for Rita Limanto, who arrived in New York two years ago from Indonesia.
Her two children are far ahead, and while she is proud of their success, she is anxious that she may fall too far behind.
In an essay for her English class, she wrote: "Two more years, my children are going to forget their original language. They are going to be fluent in English."


Greek Ex-Premier Not Guilty in Bank Scandal
A special Greek court acquitted former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today of criminal charges in a banking scandal that contributed to his administration's defeat in 1989.
Mr.
Papandreou, who led a Socialist Government for eight years and is now the main opposition leader, was found not guilty of all four counts.


Premieres, Debuts, Etc. For the Met Next Season
For the second consecutive season the Metropolitan Opera is to present the world premiere of an opera by an American composer.
"The Voyage," by Philip Glass, is to have its first performance on Oct. 12.
The Met also plans new productions of three standard-repertory works in the 1992-93 season, which opens on Sept. 21 with a revival of Offenbach's "Contes d'Hoffmann," starring Carol Vaness, Samuel Ramey and Placido Domingo and conducted by James Levine.
Also notable on next season's schedule are the Met conducting debut of Seiji Ozawa, and three performances of the company's staging of the Wagner "Ring" cycle.
The season will last 32 weeks.


Cuomo and Chief Judge Settle Court Budget Fight
Ending what a Federal judge once called "an unseemly conflict," Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo and Chief Judge Sol Wachtler announced an agreement today to settle their four-month legal battle over the state's judiciary budget.
Judge Wachtler said he had agreed to drop his lawsuit against Mr.
Cuomo in State Supreme Court in exchange for a commitment from the Governor and the State Legislature to provide enough money in the next fiscal year to restore the state courts to their former strength.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats; Harkin Emphasizes Steadiness but Looks for Lift
In a calm aside from his regular verbal assaults on his Democratic rivals and President Bush, Senator Tom Harkin offers his own assessment of his quest for the Presidency: "Unlike the other campaigns, I haven't had any big highs, I haven't had any lows. Just steady as she goes."
This is Mr.
Harkins's effort to get his audience to ignore early polls and some pundits' predictions by making a virtue of his own perserverance as Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have enjoyed more of the highs so far.


On My Mind; Skewing the Primaries

Sometimes we do it so rapidly that the recipient hasn't had time to unwrap the gift before, zip, he is staring at empty hands.

Maybe It's Time to See If This Marriage Works
Well, it's beginning to look like the marriage of Louis Moro and Mary Fekete may last, after all.
These days some people change spouses like jewelry.
So there was considerable concern, you know, after their whirlwind romance, what with his being older and society's values changing.
The pair met in a park.
She was sitting with girlfriends.
He was hanging around with buddies that autumn afternoon.
Not coincidentally, the boys happened past the girls, who, not surprisingly, didn't seem to notice.
But they got to talking, which was no accident, either.


Review/Television; Reining In Presidential Candidates
"Campaigning for the Presidency," tonight at 9 on Channels 13 and 49, really gets going when John Chancellor, the evening's ringmaster, stops treating his eight assembled campaign managers as if they were political scientists and descends to the details of their efforts in behalf of Presidential candidates from Richard M. Nixon to Michael S. Dukakis.
Not all have been as successful as Stuart Spencer and Edward Rollins, who served Ronald Reagan.
Richard Kleindienst was Barry M. Goldwater's first campaign manager in 1964; Gary Hart worked for George S. McGovern, and Susan Estrich advised not only Mr.
Dukakis but also the team of Walter F. Mondale and Geraldine A. Ferraro.
Still, all have been in the trenches.


Nanny Pleads Not Guilty in Death of Baby
The Swiss nanny accused of setting several fires that killed a Westchester couple's baby was indicted today on murder charges and pleaded not guilty.
The nanny, 20-year-old Olivia Riner, was indicted by the grand jury on four counts of second-degree murder and one count of arson.

To Counter Bias Attacks, Dinkins Is Spreading Message of Tolerance
Striving to see beyond a recent spate of racially motivated attacks, Mayor David N. Dinkins spent yesterday spotlighting the pain of hate and demanding tolerance, orchestrating meetings with the Governor, state legislators and religious and community leaders to rouse New Yorkers.
The effort culminated 10 days of restless motion in which the Mayor has swept to the side of victims from Brooklyn to the Bronx with his top aides in tow.
It seemed aimed at gathering the full powers of municipal government to raise the public debate above the cruel string of individual incidents and onto the way to understanding. 'A Loud Wake-Up Call'
"I have come to the conclusion that one of the most important things I can do for our children is to issue a loud wake-up call to the adults of our city, pointing out the unprecedented need for our involvement, our leadership and our guidance," the Mayor said amid a flurry of official statements urging remedies from tougher penalities for hate crimes to "teach-ins" on tolerance in schools and churches.


JAPANESE PREMIER BEGINS SEOUL VISIT
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan arrived here today on his first overseas trip since taking office, flying into a storm of indignation over the Japanese Army's role in forcing Korean women to have sex with Japanese soldiers during World War II.
The main items on Mr.
Miyazawa's agenda in talks with President Roh Tae Woo were Japan's trade surplus with Seoul and their joint approach to ending the confrontation between North and South Korea.


Review/Film; Too Much to Prove, and No Reason to Prove It
Juice: it means power, nerve, street-smart bravado, and according to Ernest R. Dickerson's new film it can definitely be had in oversupply.
"Juice" is the story of how four young friends from Harlem are caught up in a murderous spree after one of them decides to test the limits of his machismo.
The idea may be familiar, but the execution is much better than that, thanks to natural, affecting performances from the principals and a very sharp visual style.
Mr.
Dickerson, whose cinematography has been the reason Spike Lee's films look so good, has a terrific eye and some juice of his own.
"Juice" begins with the innocent spectacle of Q (Omar Epps), Raheem (Khalil Kain), Steel (Jermaine Hopkins) and Bishop (Tupac Shakur) rolling out of their respective beds and heading off for school, which is a place they almost never see.
Instead, they roam amiably through their neighborhood, engaging in such relatively innocent activities as shoplifting records and trading insults with rivals.
Throughout this easygoing portion of the film, Mr.
Dickerson (and his cinematographer, Larry Banks) gives the Harlem streets a rare crispness and clarity, and manages to position the camera in uncannily apt ways.
The film's look is handsome but also claustrophobic, creating a caged feeling even in some of its outdoor scenes.

It's Back to Stanford As Walsh Leaves NBC
Bill Walsh stepped out of the press box and back into college football today, saying that his decision to return to Stanford University as its football coach was spurred by a love for teaching and coaching.
Walsh, who coached the San Francisco 49ers to three Super Bowl titles before joining NBC as its top pro football analyst in 1989, agreed to a five-year contract that will reportedly pay him $350,000 a year.


Foreign Affairs; Bush's Ultimatum to Shamir
George Bush has a mega-jolt in store for Yitzhak Shamir.
The President seems ready to let the Prime Minister know that Israel will have to make a choice: between more Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and U.S.-backed multibillion-dollar loan guarantees, between pleasing thousands of right-wing settlers and helping resettle hundreds of thousands of Soviet immigrants, between bad and good relations with the White House.
Mr.
Bush is taking a gamble.
Unless he frames his position with great skill, Mr.
Shamir will turn it to hard-line advantage in soon-to-come Israeli elections.


Knicks Trying To Free Ewing
The recent fourth-quarter frustrations have not become intolerable for Patrick Ewing, yet.
The Knicks are still 10 games over .500, they lead the Atlantic Division by two games, and by all accounts are one of the National Basketball Association's most-improved teams.
All that pleases Ewing, making him a much happier player than he was last season.
But for New York to become a contender, the Knicks need to make their opponents pay for double- and triple-teaming Ewing, and Ewing must make the most of the scoring opportunities he gets.


Slovenes Are in No Mood to Celebrate
With most of Europe supporting its independence, Slovenia has become one of the world's youngest states, midway through a Balkan winter that has mixed hope with hardship and the sense that freedom brings no quick fixes.
Since Wednesday -- the European Community's deadline for recognition of Slovenia and Croatia, two former republics of Yugoslavia -- some 30 nations had by tonight pledged to raise their pennants at embassies here and in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.
But the transformation from the rebelliousness of secession from Yugoslavia to the respectability of acknowledged nationhood drew little passion: not a bang or even a whimper -- rather, just a shrug.


He Came. He Soared. And He's Conquering.
Five months after he broke the 23-year-old long jump record, MIKE POWELL is still flying.
Yesterday, he claimed another high honor.
He was named the recipient of the Jesse Owens International Trophy as the athlete who best personifies excellence in athletic achievement and promotes sincere understanding among people of all nations.
Powell, whose leap of 29 feet 4 1/2 inches won the world championship in Tokyo last August, will receive the trophy at a dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria on Feb. 4.


Quotation of the Day
"What we do is write a statute book. In New York, you don't have to say that much in a contract because the obligations are clear in laws and in precedent, but here you have to spell out everything." -- A. JAMES REDWAY, an American lawyer in Moscow.  [ A1:3. ]


Review/Theater; Career Choice: Crime
Faced with two choices, going on the dole or being a petty thief, the protagonist of Tony Kavanagh's "Down the Flats" decides the second is the more remunerative and even the more self-respecting option.
"P.C.'s, professional criminals, that's our trade," this ex-convict says with pride to his street crony.
There is, of course, a third possibility, to leave Dublin and emigrate to the United States, a course eventually taken by the playwright.
The substance of "Down the Flats" (at the Irish Arts Center) has been frequently encountered in theater and in life.
Mr.
Kavanagh's distinction, like that of Miguel Pinero, is that he himself exchanged a career in crime for one as a playwright, and in his first play seems to have a natural affinity for the theater and an instinct for writing dialogue.

Criticized Police Captain Disputes City Hall's Report on Crush
The police commander who was criticized in the Dinkins administration's official review of the deadly crush at a City College gymnasium defended himself yesterday, as Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown released a preliminary report of his own that found that the 66 officers on duty at the time had acted properly.
Both the commander, Capt.
Daniel P. Carlin, and the Brown report differed from the Dinkins administration's report, which concluded that the police had been slow in responding to the incident, in which nine people died.


Correction


Gibson Hospitalized
ALTHEA GIBSON collapsed while giving a speech in East Orange, N.J., Tuesday night and has been hospitalized in Newark for unspecified treatment.
The 64-year-old Gibson, whose 56 major championships over a 23-year career include two singles and two doubles championships at Wimbledon, was giving an address at a Boy Scout dinner when she slumped into her chair.
She did not lose consciousness but was unable to continue, dinner officials said.
She was taken to University Hospital in Newark, where a hospital spokesman said yesterday that she had asked that no information about her condition be released.


Hewlett and Prime Forming Alliance
Prime Computer Inc. and the Hewlett-Packard Company formed an alliance under which Prime will buy $400 million worth of Hewlett-Packard servers and work stations over the next three and a half years.
Prime also agreed to make its specialized software compatible with Hewlett products.


Sports of The Times; What About the Other $386 Million?
Whenever people say, "Isn't it awful how much money the athletes make?" my standard answer is, "I'd rather see Don Mattingly have the money than George Steinbrenner." The ball players, after all, can throw and run and hit a curveball, and do many other socially redeeming acts.
The owners, on the other hand, merely own.
Pardon my class identification -- my parents were union members when it was dangerous -- but I've always believed in sharing the wealth.
Whenever I see an athlete signing for $3 million a year, I figure some of the owner's money is going to trickle down to the player's relatives and friends, balancing things out a little.


Bear Stearns Earnings Jumped in 4th Quarter
Swept along by Wall Street's gush of new stock offerings and trading activity, the Bear Stearns Companies yesterday announced earnings of $77.4 million for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, up sharply from $16.9 million in the corresponding quarter of 1990.
It was the best quarter on record for the firm, surpassing its previous high of $63 million in the final quarter of 1988.
Revenue in the most recent quarter, the second in the firm's fiscal year, totaled $698 million, compared with $587 million a year earlier.


Neighbors of Rape Suspect Say He Taunted Children
Troy A. Rivera, the man accused of abducting and raping an 11-year-old boy on West 77th Street on Tuesday, used to taunt children with obscene jeers as they walked to school in the morning and later mingle with other children at a playground across the street, his neighbors said.
Yesterday, those neighbors wondered openly whether they should have warned the authorities more forcefully of their concerns about Mr.
Rivera's behavior.


James Is No. 1
DON JAMES didn't have to share anything with DENNIS ERICKSON last night.
James, who led the University of Washington to a 12-0 record and a share of the national championship with Miami, received the Bear Bryant Award in Houston as the college coach of the year.
James beat out Erickson and two other finalists, Georgia Tech's BILL LEWIS and Florida's STEVE SPURRIER.


Herminio Portell Vila, A Cuban Historian, 90
Herminio Portell Vila, a Cuban historian of Cuban-United States relations who taught Fidel Castro, gave him some unheeded advice and left Cuba after the rebel leader seized power, died on Monday at his home in Miami.
He was 90 years old.
The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.


Yale Panel Proposes Deep Cuts in Faculty And in Departments
In what would represent the most substantial changes to Yale University in 40 years, a faculty committee has recommended the elimination or consolidation of several academic departments and a 10.7 percent reduction in faculty positions.
While most major universities are struggling to cut costs, Yale's proposed reductions would be among the most stringent.
The departments of linguistics and of operations research, a mathematics discipline, will be closed outright if the recommendations are accepted by the Yale Corporation, the university's governing body, next month.
The sociology department's faculty would be cut by almost 40 percent, three separate engineering departments would be consolidated into one, and the departments of physics and applied physics would be scaled back and then merged.


Magic and Mr. Bush, One on One
Magic Johnson's visit to the White House this week left the impression that the basketball superstar is more Presidential than the President when it comes to fighting the spread of AIDS.
Mr.
Johnson, the newest member of the National Commission on AIDS, gave Mr.
Bush some cogent suggestions for improving AIDS treatment, prevention and research.
And he was right on the mark when he criticized the President for hanging back in the battle against this deadly disease.


Quarterly Profit Up by 20% At Bristol-Myers Squibb
The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company said yesterday that profits increased 20 percent in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Both the quarter and the entire year set records in profits and sales, the company said.
Analysts said the earnings reports consolidated the company's standing as one of the three or four strongest pharmaceutical concerns.


TV With Viewer Interaction Gets Go-Ahead From F.C.C.
The Federal Communications Commission today set aside a special radio fre quency for interactive over-the-air television services, which could soon make it possible for viewers to order pizzas, pay credit card bills or call up sports scores by pressing buttons on pistol-shaped remote-control devices.
Also, as expected, the commission voted 4 to 0 to propose opening up a large swath of frequencies for use by emerging communication technologies, from tiny cellular telephones to satellite messaging systems and digital radio that offers sound as clear as that from compact disks.


Warning on Sale of Music Is Canceled by the Police
The Police Chief of Guilderland, N.Y., issued a retraction yesterday of his letter warning three local music stores that they could face felony or misdemeanor obscenity charges for selling recordings that contained sexually explicit lyrics.
The letter, sent by Chief James R. Murley on Jan. 7, created a maelstrom of controversy in the small suburb of Albany and sent a chill through the stores' managers and owners.
While he did not specifically threaten arrest, the Chief had put the sale of any recordings with the label "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" under the specter of prosecution for obscenity.


Yeltsin Warning Those Who Obstruct Reforms
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, fresh from encounters with angry shoppers during a tour of the country, vowed today to continue his painful economic reform despite vocal opposition, and to crack down hard against the "mafia-type structures" that are trying to drag it off course.
In a report to the Russian Parliament, Mr.
Yeltsin praised Russians for their patience and faith as they adjust to prices that have tripled and more since Jan. 2.
But he warned, "The reform is still not irreversible, and is easily interrupted."


The Art of a Russian Deal: Ad-Libbing Contract Law
Although there are not yet laws to govern the free market quickly emerging in the Commonwealth of Independent States, contracts are being signed for all sorts of deals as lawyers make up their own rules to cover what is not on the statute books.
The free market, in effect, is not waiting for a legal system.
Deals march on, although the contracts that are bringing new ventures to life might be difficult to enforce.
That is particularly true of provisions that assign to a new private company such things as machinery, aircraft or buildings still technically owned by the state.  'Goods Have to Move'
"Russian businessmen have gone ahead of the law, but goods have to move," said Armen Kazaryan, a 38-year-old broker whose company trades such items as timber, cotton, oil and tires on Russia's not-yet-legal commodity exchanges.
And in that spirit, Russians are signing thousands of contracts, from short-form agreements for the sale of Mr.
Kazaryan's commodities to elaborate documents specifying the terms of joint ventures between Russians and Americans.


Serbs Denounce Breakup of Yugoslavia
Leaders of Serbia and the Serb-controlled Yugoslav Government today denounced as illegal and dangerous the formal recognition of Croatia and Slovenia by the European Community, which effectively closed the book on Yugoslavia as it had existed since the end of World War II.
"The presidency considers this an intentional breakup of Yugoslavia and stresses that it does not solve the Yugoslav crisis but only worsens it," a statement by the Serb-controlled Yugoslav presidency said.
The statement said recognition of Croatia and Slovenia violated the United Nations Charter and other international accords.


Algeria's Military Appoints A 5-Member Ruling Council
A new five-member High State Council was sworn into office today by the military-backed Government that seized power in Algeria after bringing about the resignation of President Chadli Benjedid last weekend.
The council, which is to act as a collegial presidency, is headed by Mohammad Boudiafe, a 74-year-old politician who returned today after living in exile in Morocco for 27 years.
He is a founder of the Algerian revolutionary group that began a war of liberation against France that led to independence in 1962.
But the strongman in the new High State Council is widely believed to be the Algerian Defense Minister, Gen.
Khalid Nizar.


For Anderson, Bench Is No Joy Ride
The clock showed 8 minutes 58 seconds left in the game before Nets Coach Bill Fitch inserted Kenny Anderson against the Celtics in Boston on Wednesday night.
Why did Fitch wait so long?
The coach's answer was almost the same as the one he gave for taking out Mookie Blaylock, his starting point guard, with 7 minutes 50 seconds left in the third quarter.


Ousted Chief Returns to Georgia, Raising Fear of Renewed Fighting
The ousted President of Georgia, Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia, returned to his stronghold in western Georgia today, raising the specter of renewed warfare in the tumultuous Caucasus republic.
Tass reported that Mr.
Gamsakhurdia and his followers flew into Sukhumi, a city on the Black Sea, in the early morning, and from there drove to Zugdidi, center of the region from which Mr.
Gamsakhurdia comes and where he has his strongest support.


Chang's In, but McEnroe's Out
John McEnroe is off the Olympic list and Michael Chang is on it.
The United States Tennis Association has completed the selection process for the men's and women's tennis teams that will compete in the Barcelona Games this summer, provided that the United States Olympic Committee likes what it sees and submits that list to the International Tennis Federation by the deadline tomorrow.


Art in Review
Rachel Whiteread  Luhring Augustine 130 Prince Street SoHo Through Feb. 8
Rachel Whiteread, a promising young English sculptor, is making her New York debut with a group of works that combine the simplicity of early 1970's Process art with psychological overtones of a more contemporary sort.
The artist works primarily by casting fairly familiar objects in inappropriate materials and letting the suggestions proceed from there.
Most of the pieces in this exhibition are casts of mattresses, so the suggestions tend toward bodies, sex and dreams and also childhood.
Several are cast in foam so dense they appear to be immovable, with their leaning, propped and bent positions echoing the early soft lead sculptures of Richard Serra.
The most evocative work in the show is a pair of child's mattresses cast in the slightly soft sand-colored cement that dentists (especially orthodontists) use to make molds of teeth (especially children's).
In another work what seems to be an old mattress, its springs making nipple-like protrusions in its surface, has been cast in a dense foam whose faint translucence and pale rust color suggest both flesh and blood.
It sags against a wall like a discarded body, while its color and physical density impart a fresh and defiant air.
Ms.
Whiteread is not nearly so successful when she leaves the bedroom and departs from pliant materials.
A work that consists of a rounded slab of marble with a raised rounded edge looks like a monumental version of a small, chic cutting board such as one might find on a wet bar.
All it needs is a knife with a matching handle.


War of Hams Where the Stage Is All
HAM actors may be a horror, but fine actors playing ham actors are almost always a joy.
Brian Bedford, cast as the 19th-century British tragedian William Charles Macready in Richard Nelson's new play, "Two Shakespearean Actors," is no exception.
Very grand, often pickled and prone to forgetting the end of any sentence well before he has made it to the verb, Mr.
Bedford's puffed-up Macready would be right at home in the hapless theatrical companies of "Nicholas Nickleby," "The Dresser" and "Noises Off." Even his version of the actor's nightmare is egomaniacal: when Macready dreams this dream, he does not forget his lines but instead plays all the parts at once.
Mr.
Bedford, a British actor who has been a mainstay of Broadway and Stratford, Ontario, over a 30-odd-year stage career, pours a lifetime of both classical and boulevard-comedy experience into this role.
In Mr.
Nelson's play, Macready is a tired, fading figure who arrives to perform "Macbeth" in the New York City of 1849 only to find his supremacy challenged by a younger local upstart, the first great American Shakespearean, Edwin Forrest (Victor Garber),who is performing his own "Macbeth" elsewhere in town.
It's an ugly situation.
A symbolic target for enraged nationalistic forces beyond his comprehension, Macready suffers the indignity of less-than-full houses, a pelting with stones and, finally, a full-scale Anglophobic riot that leaves more than a score dead outside the Astor Place Opera House.

Appointment Will Not Alter Family Control
The appointment of a new publisher at The New York Times yesterday entailed no change in the ownership structure of the newspaper or its parent New York Times Company.
Since the purchase of The Times by Adolph S. Ochs in 1896, control of the newspaper and related properties has rested with his family.
In February 1990, on the death of Mr.
Ochs's daughter, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, control passed to her four children through the automatic termination of a trust established by her father.


Art in Review
Alexis Rockman  Jay Gorney Modern Art 100 Greene Street SoHo Through Feb. 1
Alexis Rockman is painting himself into a corner as visually rich as it is reactionary.
His new paintings (eight small and six medium-size) describe in greater and more macabre detail than ever an irrational Bosch-like world of bizarre biological mutation and inter-species violence, while playing down the jewel-like transparent colors that were previously the artist's trademark.
In "Barnyard Scene," a raccoon appears to be raping a rooster, while "Eastern Woodland Scene" features a raccoon with a duck's bill for a mouth, a bird claw for a paw and a worm appended to its bushy tail that is eating a multi-eyed fish.
Whereas Mr.
Rockman's creatures used to waver between abstraction and representation, his new protagonists are conventionally realistic.
The artist has relegated his painterly flourishes to the backgrounds, where crackling, scumbled surfaces conflate Color Field abstraction with primal ooze and decay and suggest that each canvas starts out as a kind of abstract tabula rasa.
See, for example, the thick-thin layers of pinks, lavender and white that occupy the lower portion of "The Larder," a painting whose bird-on-limb motif brings to mind the tropical paintings of the 19th-century Luminist Martin Johnson Heade. (Until, that is, you spot the lizard skewered on a giant thorn.)
These images are in many ways riveting: the eye devours their freaks and dramas, their colors and details as surely as Mr.
Rockman's creatures devour one another.
But the experience can also leave an aftertaste not unlike that brought on by watching a bad horror movie.
Perhaps Mr.
Rockman is becoming more and more the genuinely eccentric artist that he seems singularly equipped to be.
Still, as with so much Neo-Romantic landscape painting to which his work tangentially relates, it frequently appears that age-old narrative and pictorial devices have been brought out, dusted off, recombined in dizzying complexities and presented as something new.
A final note: the exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue that contains one of the best essays of the season.
Written by Douglas Blau, it is simply a lengthy index that might accompany a book about Mr.
Rockman's work; the references cited run the absolute gamut of art, science, literature and popular culture, including, of course, horror movies.
This fantastic effort, in both senses, is a fitting codicil to the paintings and also conjures the writer's eternal dream of doing the research without having to write the book.
But the index also inadvertently reduces Mr.
Rockman's images to the sum of their myriad references and affinities.

Islanders Want Malakhov
The Islanders have never employed a player from the former Soviet Union but that could soon change.
When General Manager Bill Torrey travels to France next month for the Winter Olympic Games, he hopes to sign Vladimir Malakhov, a 23-year-old defenseman drafted in the 12th round by the Islanders in 1989.
"I've told him I want my hands on him as soon as I can get my hands on him," Torrey said.
"We've negotiated, on again and off again, for five months."


Senate Counsel to Subpoena 2 Over Reports on Thomas
A special counsel hired by the Senate to investigate the disclosure of Prof.
Anita F. Hill's sexual-harassment accusations against Judge Clarence Thomas is preparing to subpoena the two journalists who first reported those accusations.
The move raises the possibility of an eventual constitutional confrontation.
Peter E. Fleming, a New York lawyer who is in charge of the Senate's inquiry, has told lawyers for the reporters, Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio and Timothy Phelps of Newsday, that he will probably subpoena them to appear before him on Feb. 5.
They are expected to be asked then to identify those who helped them obtain copies of Professor Hill's statements, which had been given to the Senate Judiciary Committee but not made public.


One China, and the Moment of Truth
We are slowly approaching a moment of truth in the more than 40-year saga of Taiwan's status.
Beijing, Taipei and Washington agree on the unity of China.
In the National Assembly election last month, the people of Taiwan voted for the status quo, for prudence and prosperity -- for not alienating Beijing but not embracing it either.
Flawed or not, that election -- 75 percent voted for the ruling Nationalist Party -- was a skirmish, not the end of the affair.
Events in Taiwan, China and elsewhere may well undermine the "unity of China," although we should not underestimate the ability of the Chinese to devise an arrangement between the two parties.


Teamster Officials Forced To Surrender Their Posts
The officers of a teamsters' local in Hempstead, L.I., who were defeated in an election last month but had refused to relinquish their posts, left their offices last night after a Federal judge threatened them with fines and contempt citations.
The defeated slate left the union hall last night through a rear door a few moments after a 5:30 deadline as the newly elected slate of insurgents walked in the front.


New York Takes Hertz To Court Over Surcharge
New York City and New York State sued Hertz yesterday over its two-week-old surcharge for renters from four New York City boroughs, calling it illegal discrimination.
At a City Hall news conference announcing the suit, Robert Abrams, the Attorney General, said the Hertz Corporation "can charge whatever rate it wants." But he added, "What it cannot do is charge different people different rates based on where they live."


UAL Sees Loss
The UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, said it expected its fourth-quarter net loss to be the largest quarterly loss in its history and would "substantially" exceed the previous largest quarterly net loss, of $157 million recorded in the first quarter of 1991.
The fourth-quarter loss will include a significant amount of nonrecurring expenses, it said.
UAL, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., expects to release its earnings for the quarter and all of 1991 on Jan. 30.


Hertz's Unfair Liability
The suit filed yesterday by New York City and State against the Hertz Corporation may be technically correct in its main thrust: The surcharges Hertz has imposed on car rental customers who live in the city appear to be illegal under state law.
But the ultimate villain is not Hertz.
The surcharges result from an archaic liability law that inflates the cost of doing business in New York by tens of millions of dollars a year.


Trade Deficit Narrows To Smallest in 9 Years
Plunging demand for imports and a slight increase in exports shrank the nation's trade deficit in November to $3.57 billion, the smallest level in almost nine years, the Commerce Department said today.
October's trade deficit was also revised downward, to $6.32 billion from an initial estimate of $6.73 billion, further impressing economists, who look at the average of a string of monthly trade deficits rather than a single month's total.
The deficit in November 1990 was $9.54 billion.

"Three Roses and a Sacred Cow" certainly wasn't dull.
The plot kept taking peculiar twists in this dance drama presented by Byron Suber on Sunday afternoon at the Kitchen.
Lisa Heijn portrayed a woman the program called a dominatrix.
Wearing a leather mask and brandishing a whip, she pushed three naked, blubbering people onstage from the wings.
Cast as these hapless figures, Juliet Burrows, Patrick Rawlins and Mr.
Suber resembled big babies.


Teacher Found Dead On Burning Mattress
A New York City schoolteacher was found dead on a burning mattress in a bedroom of her Brooklyn home on Thursday, in a blaze that the Fire Marshal's office has labeled suspicious.
The cause of death of the teacher, Cherril McPherson, 45 years old, of 660 Belmont Avenue in East New York, has not been determined.
The Medical Examiner's Office had not completed an autopsy yesterday.

Her father, the late William B. Ewers, was a Washington lawyer.


Jets Hire Haley
On the theory, perhaps, that the road to the Super Bowl begins with the college draft, the Jets have hired a director of player personnel who has made the trip four times.
He is DICK HALEY, who spent 22 years as the player personnel director of the Pittsburgh Steelers before his resignation last week.
He replaces RON WOLF, who left the Jets to be general manager of the Packers.


All-Star Coach Clinches
Coach PHIL JACKSON of the Chicago Bulls has clinched the head coaching job for the Eastern Conference All-Star team more than a week before the cutoff date for determining the post.
The Bulls have a six-and-a-half-game lead over Cleveland in the race for the best record in the conference, too large a margin for the Cavaliers to make up by Jan. 26.
The coaches of the teams with the best records in each conference after games of that date will be the head coaches for the All-Star Game at Orlando, Fla., on Feb. 9. (AP)


BUSNIESS DIGEST
Companies
I.B.M. said it lost $1.38 billion in the quarter, resulting in its first yearly deficit ever.
And revenues were off 6.1 percent for the year, the first time in 45 years that growth had faltered.
Calling the year disappointing, the company blamed a declining world economy, increased competition and the difficulties associated with introducing new product lines.  [ Page 37. ]


Westinghouse Reports a Profit for 4th Quarter
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation said yesterday that it had returned to profitability in the fourth quarter after losses in several earlier periods.
It has been working to shrink its troubled financial services subsidiary, which was heavily invested in real estate, junk bonds and leveraged buyout securities, and had taken big write-offs in previous quarters to reflect the lower market value of the assets.
The company reported earnings of $171 million, or 51 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $449 million in the 1990 period.
For the year, though, it reported a loss of $1.08 billion because of the write-offs.

Courthouse Arrest Throws Teaneck Trial Into Turmoil
The trial of a policeman charged with shooting a teen-ager was thrown into turmoil today when a prosecution witness was arrested in the courthouse lobby after testifying.
The incident prompted prosecutors to charge that the Bergen County Sheriff's office was attempting to undermine the trial.
The arrest further strained the uneasy relations between the New Jersey Attorney General's office and the sheriff's office over the case of Gary Spath, the white Teaneck officer charged in the fatal shooting of a black teen-ager, Phillip Pannell, in April 1990.


Corrections
An article in Business Day on Jan. 9 about activity in the credit markets referred incorrectly to the rating status of a $2 billion offering of Tennessee Valley Authority debt securities.
The securities are not rated by either Moody's Investors Service or the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation.





Taking Life in Stride, With Baby
Holding a baby in one's arms for hours at a stretch is beneficial for parent and newborn.
Bonding is much greater and babies, comforted by another heartbeat after developing alongside such sounds in the womb, are less likely to cry in complaint.
Still, carrying a baby is not always convenient or comfortable.
The adult's arms tire; the neck and back start to ache, and there are always chores to be done with the hands, like laundry, cooking and writing thank-you notes for baby gifts.


Hitler's War Didn't Start With Dresden Raid
To the Editor:
It is surprising to read that the proposed erection of a statue in central London of Sir Arthur Harris, the late commander of the British Royal Air Force during World War II, "has deeply disturbed some German officials" (news article, Jan. 6).


Shots Fired at High School
A 15-year-old boy was charged with firing shots into the air outside a Manhattan high school yesterday afternoon after a crowd watching a fight between two girls in the school cafeteria spilled out into the street, the police said.
No one was injured in the incident, which occurred outside Norman Thomas High School, at 33d Street and Park Avenue, said a police spokesman, Officer Andrew McInnis.
The 15-year-old, whom the police did not identify, was charged with reckless endangerment.


Your Money; Some Cautions On Stock Funds
Distressed by the current low yields of money market funds and short-term bond funds, many mutual fund investors are seeking to reposition their assets for a greater return.
Last year's stunning 35.57 percent average gain among general equity funds and a 14.5 percent total return on intermediate-term Government bond funds make them more alluring.
But A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, which compiles the statistics on fund performance, as well as managing accounts for fund investors, is sounding a note of caution.


Hitler's War Didn't Start With Dresden Raid; Berlin Bombings
To the Editor:
With regard to your Jan. 6 news article, I lived through Sir Arthur Harris's daily saturation bombings while growing up in Berlin.
I was in the isolation ward of a (clearly marked) children's hospital in a rural area some 50 miles outside the city, 7 years old and ill with scarlet fever, when the hospital was bombed to bits and pieces by Harris's jolly group.


California Governor Tells of Suffering, But Question Now Is Whose Was It
In his State of the State Message last week, did Gov.
Pete Wilson invent a cast of brave California characters struggling with the recession?
Even his press office did not seem to be sure today.
In a portion of the speech that he wrote, Mr.
Wilson gave a detailed account of a farm worker, a businessman and a carpenter who had impressed him with their suffering and determination.
But when reporters tried to track them down, his press office said they did not exist but were composites.

Strange History of Silicone Held Many Warning Signs
For decades, doctors and scientists have thought it unlikely anything as inert as silicon could cause significant health problems.
Besides breast implants, silicone plastics made from silicon have been used in valves, tubes and artificial parts in the body.
They seemed benign.


JAPAN APOLOGIZES ON KOREA SEX ISSUE
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan made a formal public apology here today for Japan's actions in forcing tens of thousands of Korean women to have sex with Japanese soldiers during World War II.
In a speech to South Korea's National Assembly, Mr.
Miyazawa said: "Recently, the issue of 'comfort women' in the service of the Imperial Japanese Army has come into light. I cannot help feeling acutely distressed over this, and I express my sincerest apology."


Guidepost
Off to School Safely
Some 9,000 children are injured and about 35 are killed each year in accidents related to school buses.
Most occur while the children are waiting for a bus or getting on or off it.
In many of the deaths, the child is struck by the school bus, not by other traffic.
Safety is taught at many schools but parents should remind their children of safety rules regularly.
Here are some tips from school and safety experts.
The Danger Zone
There is a blind spot of 10 feet around a school bus where the driver may not be able to see a child.
Children should learn to move away from the bus quickly after getting off and not to circle close to the bus before boarding.
A child should never enter this blind spot to pick up a dropped book or other object, but should wait until the bus has left and traffic is clear in all directions.
Waiting for the Bus
Children should get to the bus stop a few minutes early.
Adults should accompany small children or have a volunteer at the stop.
Clothing
Clothing should be securely fastened so as not to catch on anything when a child is boarding or getting off the bus.
Books and papers should be carried in a roomy book bag or backpack; anything more bulky should be in a shopping bag.
Hats and mittens should have designated pockets.
Information
Booklets offering safety tips are available from National School Bus Safety Week, P.O.
Box 2639, Springfield, Va. 22152, and from the National Association for Pupil Transportation, P.O.
Box 745, East Moline, Ill. 61244.


For 2 U.S. Divisions in Germany, Taps
Two United States Army divisions that landed at Normandy 48 years ago and later defended American interests in the cold war marked their last day in Europe today as they were officially disbanded.
As flags came down, the commander of the Third Armored Division, Maj.
Gen.
Jerry R. Rutherford, said: "The cold war is over. Our mission is accomplished. It's time to go home."


Donations to the Neediest Cases Fund Are Road Map of Generosity
From the pioneer days to the days of Jack Kerouac to today, Americans have charted journeys across the country following every imaginable route.
But there is no evidence that anyone has ever traced a route using contributions to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund as signposts.
Start in Hanover, N.H., home of Wendy Lamb, who gave $200.
"Although we have moved away from New York, we still feel connected to the city," she wrote.
"Right now we hope that life will improve -- somehow -- for people in need."


Quotation of the Day
"How dare we celebrate when more than 40 million Americans are without health care? How dare we celebrate in the midst of a recession, when nobody is sure whether their jobs are secure?" -- THE REV.

Sports of The Times; Barefoot Down the Bobsled Run
What seemed at first to be a harmless controversy has escalated into an international embarrassment for the troubled United States Bobsled Federation and the United States Olympic Committee.
At one level, the issue, which centers on procedure, involves questionable maneuverings in the federation's process for selecting an Olympic team and a low tolerance for outsiders.
More important, the case underscores the U.S.O.C.'s failure to mediate a deteriorating marriage between professional and amateur athletics in this country.


Arthur Karasz, 84, World Bank Official
Arthur Karasz, who headed the World Bank's European office from 1968 until his retirement in 1973, died on Wednesday at his home in Paris.
He was 84 years old.
His family said he died of respiratory failure.


Police Study on City College May Set Stage for Conflict
Two days after a mayoral report sharply criticized a New York City police commander's handling of an unruly crowd that crushed nine people to death at City College, the police have yet to accept the report's conclusions or decide whether to reprimand the officers involved.
Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown has reacted coolly to the report, saying he would await the outcome of his own department's internal inquiry before deciding what to do.
His reaction has set the stage for a potential confrontation between City Hall and Police Headquarters, especially should the department's investigation determine that the police were not at fault.


Comsat President Adds Title of Chief Executive
Bruce L. Crockett, president of the Communications Satellite Corporation, the provider of satellite telecommunications, added the title of chief executive yesterday.
Comsat, as the Washington, D.C., company is known, also named Melvin R. Laird, 69, Defense Secretary during the Nixon Administration, as chairman of the 15-member Comsat board.


Fielder Clears the Roof In Salary Arbitration
Cecil Fielder, the most productive hitter in the major leagues for the last two seasons, established one salary-arbitration record and helped create another yesterday, notifying the Detroit Tigers he wants a $5.4 million salary for the 1992 season.
Barry Bonds of Pittsburgh and Ruben Sierra of Texas joined Fielder in breaking arbitration's $5 million barrier, each submitting $5 million as his desired salary.
Fielder's number is the highest submitted in the 16-year history of the procedure, eclipsing Glenn Davis's $3.65 million entry a year ago.
The Tigers simultaneously submitted a $3.2 million salary, creating a $2.2 million gap, the largest ever.
The previous widest gulf between player and club was the $1.3 million established last year by Mark McGwire and Oakland, and Jose Rijo and Cincinnati.


Hooper Wins Eclipse
FRED W. HOOPER, 94 years old, was named yesterday as the recipient of the 1991 Eclipse Award of Merit.
Hooper's career has been full of achievement, including victory in the 1945 Kentucky Derby with his namesake, Hoop Jr.
Hooper, who operates Hooper Farm in Ocala, Fla., is credited with introducing the influx of riders from Panama, including BRAULIO BAEZA, LAFFIT PINCAY JR. and JORGE VELASQUEZ. (AP)


Friendship (Not Match) Made Near the Ring
Nobody's taking potshots at their friendship, but put it this way: It's a good thing EVANDER HOLYFIELD, MELDRICK TAYLOR and PERNELL WHITAKER aren't the same size.
The three have been close friends since the 1984 Olympics when Holyfield was the only one who didn't win a gold medal, while Taylor was winning as a featherweight and Whitaker as a lightweight.


MISS MILLS Wed To James Byrne
Melissa Ohlandt Mills, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Bradford F. Mills of Greenwich, Conn., was married yesterday to James Peter Byrne, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Mark F. Byrne of Hartsdale, N.Y., and Boca Raton, Fla.
The Rev.
Stuart Brush performed the ceremony at the North Greenwich Congregational Church, with Msgr.
Patrick Barry attending.
Mrs.
Byrne, 31 years old, is a private-label manager at Lord &amp; Taylor in New York.
She graduated from Skidmore College.
Her father is a partner in Decolam, a maker of building products in Orangeburg, S.C.


Passing Buck, Not Puck
The way Coach MIKE KEENAN of the Chicago Blackhawks sees it, it was all the officials' fault: they simply lost control of the Blackhawks' game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday night.
The way the officials saw it, the only thing that was out of control was Blackhawks wing STU GRISSOM.
When a fight broke out in the last period of the 4-0 Chicago victory, Grissom left the bench, breaking away from Keenan after being ordered back to the bench and being tackled by Referee DAN MAROUELLI.


Review/Rock; Sound and Fury Aside, Dancing Is the Point
A new format has been turning up at dance clubs in the early 1990's.
Disk jockeys combine industrial rock (brutal mechanical rhythms and agonized vocals), techno (crisp electronic rhythm tracks, largely instrumental) and some alternative rock (edgy guitars and synthesizers behind ambiguous lyrics).
It's a post-punk, suburban reaction to the urban dance rhythms of house music and hip-hop.
The Palladium, the Macy's of New York clubs, inaugurated its new weekly Hype Alternative Radical Dance, or Hard, nights on Wednesday, reflecting the popularity of similar nights at Limelight, the Building and other clubs.
Like the Limelight, the Palladium will present live bands along with recorded music.
Its first Wednesday featured three bands: Cop Shoot Cop, the Unsane and Foetus Inc.
With free admission before 11 P.M., the club was well attended but not packed.


F.B.I. and Russian Agency Thwart a Kidnapping
As if elements of the novel "Gorky Park" had sprung to life, the F.B.I. and Russian security police teamed this week to crack a $1.6 million kidnapping-and-ransom scheme that threatened the lives of two foreigners in Moscow.
The kidnapping ended Thursday morning, when agents of the newly formed Russian Agency for Federal Security, one of the successors of the K.G.B., which has been abolished, swooped down on a hotel on a busy highway outside Moscow and freed Daniel Weinstock, an Australian computer-company executive who had been taken hostage on Jan. 8.


AIDS Drug Found Less Effective Than AZT and Maker Halts Tests
A new drug being tested to treat people with AIDS is less effective than the standard one for many patients, the drug's manufacturer announced Thursday.
The company, Hoffmann-La Roche of Nutley, N.J., said it was halting its one-year study comparing its drug, dideoxycytidine, or DDC, to AZT, or azidothymidine, in patients who had not previosuly used AZT or had used it for fewer than three months.
There were fewer deaths among those who received AZT in the study, the company said.


Yes, Stay Strong. What's Strong?
Former Soviet technicians are offering to sell their science to the West; it's the latest evidence of the Red Menace crumbling before our eyes.
But that raises a new question.
If the Soviet threat is no longer a yardstick for measuring America's strength, how is that strength to be measured?
It's idle to speculate about potential enemies.
Military planners take a more practical, quantitative approach.
They examine how much of a threat future situations might pose.
And wherever they look, the threats they see are far smaller and more diffuse than those so long posed by the Soviet Union.


Italian President Visits Croatia and Slovenia
President Francesco Cossiga of Italy today became the first European head of state to visit Croatia and Slovenia since the European Community recognized their independence from Yugoslavia two days ago.
Mr.
Cossiga met with President Franjo Tudjman in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, as officials signed an agreement setting up diplomatic relations.
He later met President Milan Kucan in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, to oversee a similar ceremony.
The visit, in a high-speed armed convoy of vehicles across the border from northern Italy, was depicted by Italian officials as a show of resistance to strong German influence in an area where Italy has historical interests, including commerical links, an Italian-speaking minority and what some Italians still call regard as lost territory.

Governing New York: Simplify, Simplify
New York City's approach to the fiscal crisis is deeply flawed.
Mayor David Dinkins' incremental budget cuts will ultimately fail because they ignore the root of the problem: New York City is badly managed.
Let me offer three

examples from my nine years in city government.
Though based largely on my experiences in the Department of Transportation, they are typical of all the city's agencies.


New Lottery Game Begins
A new lottery game began yesterday in New York, replacing the Cash 40 game.
The new game, Take Five, will be played on Fridays and costs $1.
Lottery officials will draw five numbers, from 1 to 39.
For the top prize, players must match all five; lesser prizes are awarded for matching four, three or two numbers.
Lottery officials expect the prize pool for the new game to be about $200,000 a week, to be split among the winners.
The last Cash 40 game was played on Monday.


Consumer Report Shows Spirits Have Yet to Revive
The nation's spirits have yet to revive from last fall's recessionary levels, according to the closely watched University of Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment.
"Sentiment has remained largely unchanged" from December, its report to subcribers said.
The sentiment index edged down from 68.2 in December to 67.1 in January, but a decline of a point or so is not statistically significant.

Cavaliers Close In on the Elite
The Coliseum was filled to its private boxes at the top, jammed with people who had come across a frozen landscape south of Cleveland to create a feeling of spring.
Their Cavaliers had the second-best record in the National Basketball Assocation, and the defending champion Chicago Bulls were in town, and the flashbulbs and the noise were generating a playoff kind of heat.
And even after the Bulls had led the Cavaliers into a series of uncharacteristic failures, thoughts of springtime did not leave the home dressing room.
To the Cavaliers, Cleveland's recent 11-game winning streak says more about the future than their recent past.


National Westminster Appoints an American
The National Westminster Bank P.L.C., one of Britain's most profitable banks, has named an American, Richard Karl Goeltz, to be director and group chief financial officer, effective March 1.
He succeeds John Burns, 56 years old, who is leaving after 40 years to become finance director of the TSB Group P.L.C., a British banking and financial services group, which earlier this week reported its first-ever yearly loss.


Makers of Small Planes Wait for Brighter Skies
Domestic makers of small airplanes sold fewer last year than at any time since World War II.
One major manufacturer, Piper, is in bankruptcy; another, Cessna, is up for sale.
But like flying the rickety little machines that gave rise to the modern aviation industry, making small planes today has some long-term promise to compensate for the immediate perils.
The industry is developing many new products, with exports and sales of business jets growing.


Dinkins's Role In Sanitation Is Faulted
The departing Sanitation Commissioner of New York City is faulting the Dinkins administration for failing to acknowledge the fact that it is running out of ways to get rid of its garbage.
The Commissioner, Steven M. Polan, said that while Mayor David N. Dinkins has offered "tepid" support for new incinerators, he has failed to move forward in building them.
The Mayor has also failed to fully support recycling, Mr.
Polan said.


I.B.M. Loss In Quarter And Year
Closing the books on its most difficult year in decades, I.B.M. said yesterday that it lost $1.38 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting in its first yearly deficit ever.

Black Burial Ground Deserves More Than Just a Bronze Plaque
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 26 news article on the Negroes Burial Ground recently uncovered in lower Manhattan recalls the painful existence of black New Yorkers pressed into slavery in the 1700's, but it does not say what will happen to this plot after the archeologists have finished their work.
Will the graveyard return to anonymity?


Fans Will Not Be Left in the Cold
The sun was shining on Minneapolis yesterday, nine days from Super Bowl XXVI.
But the Super Bowl Task Force isn't fooled.

Croatia Assures Rights of Ethnic Minorities
To the Editor:
"No War. No Peace. No Yugoslavia" (editorial, Jan. 4) contains some assertions that do not square with facts.
The Croatian territory now occupied by the (once) federal Army and "Serbian ethnic militias" still belongs to the Republic of Croatia.


Orchha Journal; See the Ruins (Before They Vanish)
More than 400 years ago, the majestic battlements, parapets and palaces of this small village in central India rang to the thunder of battle as Hindu chieftains fought invading Mogul armies and one another.
These days the battle is quieter but even more remorseless, as Orchha and many other ancient towns and villages across India struggle against the ravages of time, weather, vandalism, greed and official neglect.

CAR THEFT, 90'S STYLE
Spurred by a foreign clientele willing to pay up to double the value of a luxury automobile, armed thieves have been hijacking cars on highways, in parking lots and on the streets of New York City and its suburbs, the police say.
In one case, the thieves, dubbed "car pirates," cut off a man driving along Grand Central Parkway in Queens, pulled a gun on him and ordered the man and his passengers out of the car.
In another, three young men accosted a woman at a Long Island shopping center, dragged her out of her car by the hair and drove off.

Observer; The Middle Riddle
It is typical of the mental gimcrackery that passes for a public philosophy these days that our rulers are suddenly frantic to grant boons to the middle class.
And what is it, this middle class, which all statesmen from President to Congressional doorkeeper now yearn to pelt with blessings?
It is an abstraction, a fragment of a campaign slogan, a piety on a demagogue's tongue, an insoluble calculus problem for demographers, a verbal crutch for economists and political writers required by the cruel nature of their trades to sound eloquent while waiting for an idea to pull into the station.

Classical Music in Review
David Geringas Cellist The Frick Collection
David Geringas played the cello on Sunday afternoon with big gestures and passionate bear hugs that were more than a little reminiscent of his teacher and now colleague, Mstislav Rostropovich.
Bach's C-major solo Suite sounded like a major excavation managed by powerful digging equipment.
Phrases were marked by wide separations; tempos were telescoped, a few notes were even dropped, all in pursuit of a continuous and hot-breathed musical momentum.


Knicks Hit the Road, and The Rim
It was a different town and a different opponent, but a familiar scenario for the Knicks.
Instead of making shots when it counted, the Knicks made mistakes.
Their defense was outstanding.
But at times, their offense was outrageous.


Friends Face the Mystical World of Words
Harvey Robinson and Robert Best are best friends, which makes sense as they have so much in common.
Both are sons of North Carolina sharecroppers and each have 12 brothers and sisters.
Both came to New York City, raised families, pursued successful careers and are now semi-retired.
Mr.
Robinson, who is 60 years old and taciturn, is chairman of the board of trustees of the New Canaan Baptist Church in Brooklyn.
Mr.
Best, 50 and garrulous, is the church's Minister of Music.


Jewelry: Admire Glitter, but Count Karats
This Valentine's Day, jewelry may e a more practical gift than usual.
The sales that began before Thanksgiving and Christmas are continuing, and the prices of gold and silver jewelry have been further reduced at many stores.
But how does a customer know that the pieces on display are, indeed, gold and silver?
There are important marks to look for.


Deeper Consumer Gloom Lifts Bond Prices
The credit markets stabilized somewhat yesterday, as buying of Treasury securities was enough to push prices of notes and bonds higher for the first time in a week.
The better tone was established in overnight trading in Asia, after results of the University of Michigan's midmonth snapshot of consumer attitudes became known.


Fundamentalists in Algeria Ask Followers to Stay Calm
Algerian fundamentalist leaders appealed to their Muslim followers today to avoid provoking the country's security forces as troops were deployed in strength across the capital on this holy day of prayer.
The Friday prayer services were the first since President Chadli Benjedid resigned last weekend and the Government canceled a second round of elections that were expected to give the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front control of the Algerian Parliament.


A High, Hard One: Cone Wants $4.25M
The Mets, with a multiyear, multimillion dollar contract proposal for David Cone on the negotiating table, yesterday filed a salary-arbitration figure of $3 million for the right-hander.
For his part, Cone, who is likely to reject the club's long-term offer as it is now constructed, registered a request for $4.25 million for the 1992 season.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters; HARKIN COURTING DISABLED VOTERS
Don Anderson has never worked for a Presidential candidate before.
But this year, Mr.
Anderson, who is paralyzed from the chest down and has only partial use of his arms, is enthusiastically supporting Senator Tom Harkin's drive for the Presidency.
For Mr.
Anderson, a 38-year-old resident of Lansing, Mich., what makes the Iowa Democrat stand out from the pack is his stand on the disabled.


U.S. LATIN POLICY YIELDS SOME GAINS
As the Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was preparing for today's first visit to Nicaragua by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Sandinista leader and former President, was clamoring for a meeting with Mr.
Baker in Mexico before his arrival here.
Mr.
Ortega's request was denied, and he had to content himself with seeking out the Secretary of State at an official lunch in Mexico City on Thursday.
However, Mr.
Baker was drawn into conversation not with Mr.
Ortega, the Secretary of State told reporters later, but with the Cuban Foreign Minister, Isidoro Malmierca, who was at his table.

Police Say Brooklyn Man Faked Bias-Attack Story for Attention
A black man claimed yesterday that he was beaten by five white men in Brooklyn in retaliation for a previous bias incident, but later confessed that he made up the story to get attention, the police said late last night.
The initial report quickly led to a high-priority police investigation and a harsh statement from Mayor David N. Dinkins condemning the attack.

Slovenia And Croatia Are Invited
The International Olympic Committee yesterday invited Slovenia and Croatia, states of Yugoslavia that gained independence earlier this week, to send separate teams to the Winter Olympics next month in France.
In so doing, the I.O.C. granted the new republics provisional recognition, a status that is expected to become formal when the full I.O.C. membership meets Feb. 5-6 in Courcheval, France.
The Games begin Feb. 8.


Patents; New Cereal: Popped Seed of Amaranth
Cereals made from popped grains and seeds from Quaker Puffed Rice to the puffed wheat in Post Sugar Golden Crisp -- have been a staple of American breakfast tables.
But a farmer and entrepreneur in Minnesota is hoping to sell consumers on a new one: popped amaranth seeds.
Amaranth is a tall and willowy plant that produces thousands of hard yellow seeds that are a bit smaller than poppy seeds.
The seeds are inedible in their raw form, but can be ground into flour or popped like popcorn by placing them on a hot griddle.
Rich in vitamin E and other proteins, amaranth is consumed in various forms in Mexico, Peru and India and is believed to have been a big part of the diet of ancient Aztecs in Central America.


Classical Music in Review
St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble Weill Recital Hall
Born two years before the 20th century and the subject of some severe cultural dislocations, Vittorio Rieti has always written music admirable for its equilibrium.
Italian in background, with beginnings in Egypt, for many years French by adoption and now with 50 years in the United States, Mr.
Rieti long ago found a musical voice that suited him no matter where he was.

The most cosmopolitan of the small tournaments played around the world is no doubt the contest in St.
Moritz, high in the Swiss Alps, which began yesterday.
Zenkel and Andersen, who live in Chicago, may be the world's most-traveled bridge partnership.
In the past nine months they have been in Prague; Killarney, Ireland, and Yokohama, Japan.
Their current trip to St.
Moritz will be followed by a visit to Hungary and Austria in April.
The diagramed deal was played in a knockout championship in Reno last month.


Despite Protests, Florio Is Expected to Sign Bills to Revise Welfare
Turning aside protests and threats of lawsuits from civil rights, church and women's groups, Gov.
Jim Florio is expected to sign a sweeping welfare revision package on Tuesday.
The package would deny extra benefits to welfare mothers who have additional children and reduce or eliminate payments for recipients who refuse to train for work or go to school.
A broad coalition of social welfare and civil rights organizations, led by the New Jersey Council of Churches, today implored the Governor to veto the six-bill package, which was approved by the lame-duck Democratic Legislature on the next-to-last day of the session.
But an aide to the Governor who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Mr.
Florio was inclined to sign it.


Hitler's War Didn't Start With Dresden Raid; Prior Arguments
To the Editor:
Your discussion of the "British and American firebomb attacks of Feb. 13-14, 1945" (news article, Jan. 6) was informative, but did not mention the prior arguments among the military leaders.
Though little known, they were made public many years ago.

Start Nuclear Prevention in North Korea
To the Editor:
If the International Atomic Energy Agency inspects North Korea's nuclear facilities and finds that they were actually designed for reprocessing power plant fuel, those facilities could actually be safeguarded against nuclear weapons proliferation ("North Korea Opens Up," editorial, Jan. 7).


Mr. Bland Goes to Trenton, and Takes Over the Senate
Donald T. DiFrancesco likes to recall that when he met his wife, Diane, while they were students at Pennsylvania State University in the 1960's, she was entranced with President John F. Kennedy and Camelot.
Now, said Mr.

A Pre-Election Israel: Focus on Talks With Arabs
With his governing coalition about to implode, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir seems to be preparing for imminent parliamentary elections by casting himself as Israel's best peace candidate, one flexible enough to talk with the Arabs but sturdy enough to protect vital national interests.
Not that Mr.
Shamir has suddenly become a born-again dove.
His position, restated more times than an electronic calculator can register, is that if peace means giving back even one square inch of Israeli-held territories to the Palestinians and Arab countries, forget it.


Another Dow High: 3,264.98, Up 15.43
Blue-chip stocks rose modestly yesterday, again in busy trading, aided by the expiration of stock and index options and major market index futures.
While smaller stocks showed weakness, the Dow Jones industrial average clicked off yet another record, ending at 3,264.98, up 15.43 points for the day and 65.52 for the week.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 287.4 million shares traded, but down from 336.2 million on Thursday.
Gaining issues were ahead of losers by a margin of 922 to 831.


When a Reservation Doesn't Get You a Car
After a long flight, you walk up to the car rental counter at the airport with a confirmed reservation.
But that appears to make little difference, because the agent behind the counter tells you there are no cars available.
During the recent holiday travel period, some of the major car rental agencies overbooked reservations.
If your reservation is not honored, what are your options?
That depends on the rental company and whether you know its policy.


A Fugitive, the Police and the Media
Real life seemed to have turned into a bad movie here today as this quiet community was ruffled by an intensive manhunt for a transvestite convicted killer and escaped convict who slipped away on Thursday from the F.B.I. as a fellow escapee was captured.
All Thursday night and today, hundreds of officers -- followed by teams of reporters -- crossed and recrossed this area of Rockland County, knocking on the doors of frightened residents and shopkeepers.
They were looking for Frank Vandever, 37 years old, who terrified residents of Somers, Conn., by escaping from a maximum-security prison there on New Year's Eve.

Dunbar Defeats St. Raymond's
Donta Bright scored 30 points and Michael Lloyd added 18 as Dunbar, the nation's top-ranked high school basketball team, defeated St.
Raymond's of the Bronx, 93-82, in the semifinals of the first Charm City Classic tournament.
Bright, a 6-foot-6-inch senior, grabbed 14 rebounds and blocked 2 shots as the unbeaten Poets improved to 15-0.
Dana Dingle scored 30 points for St.
Raymond's (12-3).


The Finger Points at City College
An official report from City Hall casts blame on nearly everyone connected with the celebrity basketball game last month at New York's City College that led to nine deaths: disorganized student sponsors, inattentive college officials, lazy police, even the unruly crowd itself.
So broad an indictment diffuses responsibility and blurs accountability.
There were clearly two main culprits: City College (and its parent, City University) and, to a lesser extent, the police.
Both are now obliged to review and revise their procedures and punish those responsible.


New Philip Morris Cigarette Emphasizes Less Nicotine
In the tobacco industry's latest marketing wrinkle, the Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest cigarette company, introduced a major cigarette brand yesterday with 90 percent less nicotine than standard brands.
Philip Morris's low-nicotine cigarette is an attempt to appeal to smokers who want a seemingly healthier cigarette, but with more taste than other brands making similar claims.
The industry's first such innovation, low-tar cigarettes, has now won a majority of sales.


A Feast Of Wit? Not Quite. Bile Flows.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Put Dennis Potter and Steven Bochco, Britain's and America's foremost television writers, on the same stage.
Then let one of their most ardent champions, the critic James Wolcott, fire away with questions.
The ensuing "cross-cultural dialogue," as the Museum of Television and Radio billed its seminar on Wednesday, would provide a feast of wit and imagination.
As it turned out, the bile flowed like champagne and the main dish was spleen.
Mr.
Wolcott, who writes the Mixed Media column for Vanity Fair, began gracefully with some introductory observations on the national differences between the work of Mr.
Potter, best known for two mini-series, "The Singing Detective" and "Pennies From Heaven," and Mr.
Bochco, the producer of "Hill Street Blues," "L.A. Law," "Civil Wars" and the ill-fated police musical "Cop Rock."


Sauers and Elkington Soar With 2 Eagles Each
Everyone knows you have to make bushels of birdies to have a chance to win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, but Gene Sauers and Steve Elkington flew to the top of the leader board after the third round today by making eagles.
Both Sauers and Elkington made eagle 3's on the par-5 6th and 11th holes at La Quinta Country Club in the third round.
Sauers shot an eight-under-par 64 that gave him a 54-hole total of 18-under-par 198, while Elkington shot a 66 that left him one shot back.


Review/Film; Scurrying Back in Time In Search of a Healthy Body
One of the few interesting notions in "Freejack" is the thought that body snatchers of the future will be forced backward in time.
In the year 2009, when most of this overlong and unsightly film takes place, mind transfers are available to the rich and ailing, but pollution has made healthy bodies hard to find.
So donors-to-be, like the brash young race-car driver Alex Furlong (Emilio Estevez), are rounded up from the past under the supervision of Vacendak (Mick Jagger), a bounty hunter in search of tender young flesh.
Mr.
Jagger, managing to combine a sneer and a monotone, and revealing only the occasional flash of humor, is fun to watch but lucky to have other employment.
Anthony Hopkins appears only briefly (in the thankless role of the mastermind who must explain the plot's machinations) and seems to be the only real actor in the cast.
Mr.
Estevez and Rene Russo, who were supposedly ardent lovers in 1991 and are dramatically reunited in 2009, never set off the slightest spark.
Amanda Plummer, as a gun-toting nun, delivers some unexpectedly lively lines and slugs one of the villains, but mostly seems to have wandered in from some other film.


Massachusetts Governor Seeks Tax Cuts
At a time when other governors are being forced by soaring deficits to make unpopular tax increases, Governor William F. Weld introduced a package of tax cut proposals today that would reduce personal and business taxes as part of an effort to reinvigorate the Massachusetts economy.
Mr.
Weld's proposals include lowering the personal income tax rate, cutting the capital gains levy and offering a series of investment credits to businesses that hire new employees, expand their plants or offer job training and child care.


I.R.S. Explains New Sponsorship Rules
The Internal Revenue Service yesterday outlined its guidelines for taxing the income that tax-exempt groups like college-bowl and golf-tournament organizers receive from corporate sponsors.
The guidelines were issued as a result of an I.R.S. ruling last year that organizations running the Cotton Bowl and the John Hancock Bowl had to pay taxes on their sponsorship cash because the money constituted advertising, an activity deemed unrelated to the business of the games.

Richard F. Hixson cites Louis D. Brandeis's concurring decision in Whitney v.

Newmark &amp; Lewis Stores to Close
At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., last week, while other retailing executives roamed the floors searching for hot new gadgets, Ronald Fleisher, president of Newmark &amp; Lewis Inc., raced between meetings in a last-ditch effort to find a buyer for his struggling company.
None materialized.
And Mr.
Fleisher said yesterday that Newmark &amp; Lewis's remaining 26 stores would be closed.
That action makes the 68-year-old electronics chain the latest victim of the lethal retailing pox of overexpansion and anemic sales.


Classical Music in Review

Mystery Remains in Church Theft Case
For the Rev.
Kenneth G. Murphy of the St.
Aloysius Catholic parish in Great Neck, the assorted chalices, candleholders, cups and plates spread on a grimy evidence table today -- all stolen property that twinkled in solid gold and silver -- were bittersweet treasures.
Twenty separate pieces on the table had been taken in the dead of night on Nov. 14 from St.
Aloysius, one of 500 churches and synagogues in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts that the police say may have been burglarized over the last 10 years by a 45-year-old Manhattan church organist and piano teacher who is now in a Nassau County jail awaiting trail.


7 WORKERS KILLED BY BOMB IN ULSTER
A large bomb hidden in a roadside culvert blew apart a van carrying construction workers home tonight in rural County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, killing seven men instantly and wounding seven others, the police said.

In a statement to news organizations, the I.R.A. said the bombing had been carried out by its County Tyrone Brigade.


5,000 Angry Military Men Gather With Complaints in the Kremlin
Unsure whom they serve or for how much longer, some 5,000 officers of the former Soviet military gathered in the Kremlin today to angrily demand that the armed forces remain intact and that troops not be abandoned.
The assembly in the Palace of Congresses was the first such officers' gathering since the Soviet era began.
All through the day and late into the evening, one officer after another rose from the sea of olive-drab uniforms dotted with black-and-gold naval dress to fume at hostile civilians in the Baltic states, murderous weapons raids by armed Georgian bands, a loyalty oath demanded by Ukraine, attempts by various republics to claim portions of the military, shortages of housing, low pay, and the dubious prospects for the future.


2 Athletes Are Upheld By Ruling In Bobsled
A dispute among athletes hoping to make the United States Olympic team as bobsledders ended yesterday when the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York State overturned a lower-court ruling that had effectively blocked two of the athletes from competing.
The court's decision allows Willie Gault, the Los Angeles Raider wide receiver, and Greg Harrell, a former football player, to join 10 others in push competitions today and tomorrow in Altenberg, Germany.
The results will determine the eight positions on the Olympic team for sidemen and brakemen.


Birmingham Mayor Cited for Contempt
Mayor Richard Arrington Jr., the first black Mayor of a city that was at the heart of some of most violent civil rights demonstrations of the 1960's, has been embroiled for much of his three terms in office by Federal corruption investigations that his supporters say have racial overtones.
Today the Mayor was cited by a Federal judge for contempt of court for failing to honor a Federal grand jury subpoena for his appointment logs.
He now faces the prospect of having to run the city from a jail cell for some time if he does not produce the documents by Thursday.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats; DEMOCRATS VYING IN '92 RACE OFFER PAINLESS RECOVERY
Taking their cue from the successful scripts of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the Democratic candidates for President this year offer voters mostly painless solutions to the nation's economic problems.
Day after day in their campaigns, the candidates say the economy is the pivotal issue, and they repeat a common theme about ending a recession caused by the Bush Administration and launching a period of sustained economic growth.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans; PRESIDENT JOINS KING OBSERVANCE
President Bush came to the resting place of the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. today, locked arms with his widow and sang "We Shall Overcome" in a trip clearly aimed at smoothing the edges of the Presidential image on race.
But before Mr.
Bush left the stage of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Nonviolent Social Change, he heard an angry benediction from one of Dr.
King's daughters, the Rev.
Bernice King.
In her prayer, she said the problems of racism, poverty and violence that her father had fought against remained a blight on the land, although she did not link their persistence directly to Mr.
Bush.


Papandreou, Unfazed, Plans Return
For many Greeks, Andreas Papandreou might still be the nation's most artful demagogue and unpredictable power broker.
But after his acquittal on corruption charges early today, it is clear that the former Prime Minister is aiming to return to government.
Even at 4 o'clock this morning, just minutes after the high court's final verdict, he lost no time in declaring that he was vindicated and demanded elections immediately.
The late hour and his age -- he is now 72 -- appeared to have stemmed none of his past vigor.


16 Hours Ahead, McEnroe Turns Back Clock
For at least one brief shining moment, John McEnroe was once again John McEnroe.
Camelot for the tennis legend came tonight on the Australian Open's center court, where he produced sheer magic to outclass the defending champion, Boris Becker, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5, in a third-round match.
McEnroe was exuberant over the result; he pumped his fists in the air and grinned proudly as the crowd cheered wildly.


U.S. Output Down 0.2% Last Month
Industrial output sagged two-tenths of 1 percent in December, the third modest decline in a row, the Federal Reserve reported today.
This pushed production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities to the lowest point since June, when it appeared that the industrial sector -- about 30 percent of the overall economy -- had begun to lead the economy out of recession.


Review/Dance; In Jodhpurs, He and She, She a Scold, a Martinet He
Sally Silvers's choreography is dominated by an antic streak and a lot of it does not go a long way.
In theory, choreographers should do whatever they please.

Ex-Soviet, Ex-Oddity
In the old days, under the old ways, this winter would have been orderly and predictable for Sergei Fedorov and Aleksandr Mogilny.
In the red uniforms of the hockey team of the Soviet Union, they would have played in France next month in the Olympic Winter Games, defending the gold medal the U.S.S.R. won in 1988.
Afterward, they would have returned home, not to be seen again in the West until the next major international tournament.
But so much has changed since the last Olympics.
Today, as a team representing the Commonwealth of Independent States prepares for the Winter Games, Fedorov and Mogilny will be in Philadelphia, appearing in the National Hockey League All-Star Game, the first players from the former Soviet Union so honored in the world's best professional hockey league.


F.D.A. Panel Supports Cancer Drug by Cetus
After more than a year's delay, an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration unanimously recommended today that interleukin-2, the Cetus Corporation's flagship drug, be approved for use.
Cetus, one of the earliest biotech companies, was acquired by the Chiron Corporation last year.


Review/Music; Summoning Up Ghostly Images, in the Manner of Haiku
In describing the composition "Shadows": Four Dirge-Nocturnes for Orchestra by Claude Baker, which received its New York premiere in Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night, I risk critical cliche.
For the work consists of impressionistic evocations of ghostly images, huge orchestral exclamations and misty quotations of music suggesting nostalgia or loss.
This musical style, combining exotic sound effects, tonal cadences and recollected melodies, may now be the most dominant one of our time.
It can be extraordinarily effective (as in some of David del Tredici's or Alfred Schnittke's music) or almost formulaic in impact, as Mr.
Baker's work seemed in this performance by the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Slatkin.
"Shadows" (1990) is, in the composer's words, "nonverbal commentary on four haiku texts of macabre imagery." The music is meant to illustrate the images, which in these cases are of moonlight, grave mounds, autumn winds and bitter tears, and amplify them with additional associations.
The movements are also meant to suggest haiku style in their structure.


Bronx Man Held in Deaths of 4 in Mott Haven Shooting
A 21-year-old Bronx man whom the police describe as an enforcer for a drug gang was arrested and charged yesterday in a shooting spree last month that left four people dead and one critically wounded.
The shooting, in which gunmen sprayed a street in Mott Haven with at least 60 rounds from 9-millimeter semiautomatic weapons, was a result of a rivalry between two drug outfits, the police said yesterday.
But some of the wounded were bystanders struck by stray shots, officers said.


Undeserving 'Grandfathers'
It's shameful enough that members of Congress are allowed to fill huge campaign war chests with contributions from special interests.
But the House compounds that shame.
A grandfather clause will allow senior members retiring this year to transfer these funds to their personal bank accounts.
When Congress outlawed personal use of surplus campaign funds in 1979, the House added small print exempting the incumbents who approved the reform -- that is, members elected before 1980.
The House repealed that loophole in a new ethics bill 10 years later.
True to form, however, it created
another
grandfather clause benefiting members who retire or lose an election by January 1993.

Philharmonic to Play During Talks
The latest extension of the New York Philharmonic's contract with its musicians expired yesterday, but spokeswomen for both management and the players' union, the American Federation of Musicians, Local 802, said the musicians would continue to perform while the discussions continued.
The Philharmonic's last three-year contract with its players expired on Sept. 20, and the musicians agreed then to continue performing during the negotiations.
On Oct. 30, the players authorized their negotiating committee to call a strike if they felt that progress was not being made.
Since then, there have been several contract extensions.


Patents; Fingerprinting To Deter Fraud
Hoping to give companies a way to deter fraud, an inventor in Springfield, Ill., has patented a "fingerprint mirror" that can obtain and preserve a person's fingerprint without the need for any messy inks and powders.
Invented by David C. Reardon, an electrical engineer, the mirror looks like a patch of highly reflective adhesive tape, with a transparent plastic cover, that can be easily attached to a document.
Mr.
Reardon said his idea was that a car rental company, for example, could take a customer's fingerprint and have it available if the car disappeared.
It might also be attached to traveler's checks, employment applications and other documents.


CHRONICLE
A lot of literati showed up for a party on Thursday night in honor of the New Press, the latest publishing venture of ANDRE SCHIFFRIN.
Mr.

The celebration in the Trustee's Room of the New York Public Library grouped more than 200 people from the literary world, including Studs Terkel, Calvin Trillin, Barry Commoner, Barbara Ehrenreich, Peter Mayer, Robert Bernstein, Victor Navasky and Gordon Lish.

Building Leg Muscles, Side to Side
A speed skater derives power from strong leg muscles that propel the athlete forward in sweeping strokes.
A company in Gresham, Ore., is now selling a fitness device inspired by Olympic-caliber speed skaters.
The product, called the Kneedspeed, was designed three years ago by Jeff Markland, a former football player with the Miami Dolphins.
Mr.
Markland injured his knee during a game in 1988, and was looking for ways to rehabilitate the weakened joint.
He heard about a homemade training board used by Eric Heiden, the 1980 Olympic gold medal speed skater, and decided to build one for himself.


U.S. Sues Over Dismissal for Accent
Citing a rarely used Federal law, the Bush Administration has for the first time charged a company with discriminating against an employee because he speaks English with an accent.

Rabbi Arthur Schneier might be called the James A. Baker 3d of religious freedom.

Rabbi Schneier, born in Vienna, has been promoting religious liberty around the world since 1965 through the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, which he founded.
Like many other people, Rabbi Schneier, senior rabbi of Manhattan's Park East Synagogue, fears that the freedom of belief newly won in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union will only be a pause between persecutions, this time not of all religious beliefs by the government but of minority faiths by dominant ones.

Unless it eventually wants its Hall of Fame to be better known as the Dead Players Society, the L.P.G.A. should stop requiring that inductees have at least 30 career victories.
But in the case of Pat Bradley, who was officially inducted as only the 12th member of that ultraselect club at a gala ceremony in Boston last night, hard-to-attain hard numbers are the cleanest evidence of one of the greatest, and most overlooked, careers in the history of women's golf.

Keeping the Burning Fireplace Smokeless
FIXING a smoky fireplace is usually not too difficult.
Arrangement of the logs and how they are tended are often responsible.
Always arrange the logs on andirons or on a raised grate set as far back into the fireplace as possible.
Raising the logs lets air to enter from underneath, enhancing combustion.
Raising the logs also raises the height of the flames, so that smoke is less likely to waft forward before being channeled upward by the fireplace's overhanging upper edge, the chimney breast.

Review/Dance; Works by a Trio of Choreographers
Live music, spoken texts and sculptural props adorned the ambitious dance program that Laura Pettibone, Susan Cherniak and Phyllis Rose presented Friday night at the Evolving Arts Theater in Lower Manhattan.
The trappings were welcome, but it was the skill -- or lack of it -- with which the choreographers handled content that determined the strengths and weaknesses of their works.
Ms.
Rose's "Oh Anita," the evening's most unusual offering, was not really a dance but rather a choreographed play with a text derived from the Senate confirmation hearings of Judge Clarence Thomas.
Tony Palmieri was sometimes needlessly smirky as a senator and Tanya Cummingham and Ms.
Rose occasionally overplayed their roles as spectators.

Her father is the chairman of the radiology department at the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia.


The Historical Jesus
To the Editor:
Martin Goodman unfairly attacks John P. Meier's book "A Marginal Jew," which is certain to become a classic in the study of the historical Jesus.
Although he does not use the term "anti-Semitic," Mr.
Goodman in substance insinuates that that is what Father Meier's book is.
Father Meier's fault, apparently, is his assertion that Jesus was a marginal rather than a mainstream first-century Jew who antagonized not only the Romans but also significant elements of the Jewish power structure in Palestine.
That, however, seems to me to be an irrefutable conclusion; Jesus' clashes with Herodians, Pharisees and Sadducees are simply too deeply rooted in the traditions about Him to be wholesale creations of the early church.
As for the specific question of what role, if any, these groups played in Jesus' death, why doesn't Mr.
Goodman wait and see what Father Meier actually
says
about that subject in Volume Two?
Many Christian scholars have been guilty of an anti-Semitic bias in their depiction of the Jewish world out of which Jesus sprang.
John Meier is not one of them.

The Lean Season
THE ARDENT RESOLVE TO EAT LEANER AND healthier in 1992 is already fading to a whimper.
Life is once again a meal-by-meal battle between nefarious fatty temptations and the best intentions.
Diet professionals have borrowed the term "seasonal affective disorder" for this annual cycle.
The first week of the year is boom time in the weight-loss industry; yet the first month of the year has one of the highest rates of diet failure.
Extreme resolutions have a way of drifting back to the middle.
Chefs at luxury spas also see a preponderance of grand resolutions in the weeks following the holidays.


After 10 Years, an All-New Montero
ACCORDING to conventional wisdom, the Japanese like to copy things American, but that is not always so.
They take good ideas where they find them, and this time the nice notion comes from England.
The vehicle in question is Mitsubishi's Montero, a fancy sport-utility wagon that looks like nothing so much as the British Range Rover and that carries the upscale effort to nearly the same extreme.


Getting Blacks and Whites Together Under One Cultural Roof
THE yearly spotlight on the achievements of black Americans will shine in the county tomorrow, the official observance of the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, and will beam throughout what the county has designated as African-American History Month next month.
As in past years, the county's cultural calendar is filled with lectures, films and exhibitions planned by public and private organizations to pay tribute to the two national celebrations.
But who in the county will attend these events?
Will black and white people share equally in their American heritage or will audiences be mostly black, as they have been in the past?

Will Jay Property Case Ever Come to an End?
I am concerned about the failure of Westchester County officials to bring the case of the Jay property in Rye to a close  [ "County May Give Up State Grant for Jay Property," Dec. 22 ] .
The full parcel of property adjacent to the Marshlands Conservancy must be saved if the marshland is to remain a healthy wetland area.
The fact that it has taken over 10 years to accomplish this is troubling.
Any development of land near the Marshlands Conservancy, the only viable marshland on Long Island Sound between New York City and Westport, Conn., would be detrimental to the natural habitat and would rob the Sound of a natural pollution filter.
Failure to preserve the Jay mansion would be a loss of New York's heritage, as John Jay was a founding father of our nation and a native New Yorker.


Town Hall Really a Scar?
A perhaps casual comment in an article would not normally call for a response.
But there can be an exception.
I was sorry to see Philip Johnson's citation of the Salisbury Town Hall, designed by Kliment &amp; Halsband (Dec. 8).
Despite what Philip Johnson said, I know of no one else who thinks that it fits into the town.
It is almost the only scar in the otherwise lovely village.
Having known him in years past, I assume that he had not actually seen it.
As a Salisbury resident, I know that, without exception, the town's residents loathe the building.
I have heard not one favorable comment on it.
It is the worst building of its kind that I have seen in over 40 years as an architect.
It is overbearing and awkward, if not ugly, in appearance.
It lacks either grace or power.
And, it functions very poorly.


Gen. Vernon E. Megee, 91, Dies; Was Pioneer in Combat Aviation
Vernon E. Megee, a pioneer in combat aviation for the Marine Corps and the only person in that service to rise from private to the service's highest rank, four-star general, died Tuesday at the St.
Francis Gardens nursing home in Albuquerque, N.M.
General Megee, who was 91 years old, was a resident of Albuquerque the past three years and previously lived in Austin, Tex.
He died of pneumonia after a long illness, his family said.

Rooms in Prague
To the Editor: Before leaving on a recent trip to Prague, we had heard about private accommodations offered to tourists.
We had also read in the Times Travel section ("A Touch of Home on Dlouha Street," July 14) about apartments or rooms available through two agencies.
Hotel space was reportedly scarce.
At the main train station in Prague (Hlavni Nadrzi), we saw two "private accommodations" offices with computerized lists and rooms for $30 a night.
The government hotel service told us that at Pension Tesla at the end of one of the subway lines we could have an apartment with shared shower, bathroom and kitchen for $15 a night.

Keeping the Burning Fireplace Smokeless
FIXING a smoky fireplace is usually not too difficult.
Arrangement of the logs and how they are tended are often responsible.
Always arrange the logs on andirons or on a raised grate set as far back into the fireplace as possible.
Raising the logs lets air to enter from underneath, enhancing combustion.
Raising the logs also raises the height of the flames, so that smoke is less likely to waft forward before being channeled upward by the fireplace's overhanging upper edge, the chimney breast.


High-Rising Terminal Declarative, Eh?
To the Editor:
I was interested on a recent visit to New York to read comments in your pages about the tendency some (especially young) speakers of American English have to finish declarative statements with a rising intonation pattern (letters, Dec. 28).


The Historical Jesus
To the Editor:
John P. Meier's book "A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus" makes a better case than Martin Goodman suggests (Dec. 22).
To deny Jesus was a marginal Jew, Mr.
Goodman has to maintain there was no Judaism, only Judaisms.
No doubt -- but no Judaism known to us maintains its founder superior to the Torah's teaching, as Jesus does in His own words ("You have heard it said . . . but I say. . . ."), and none declares, as does Jesus in His own words, that Israel should deny at least two of the Ten Commandments (the Sabbath, honor of parents).
Mr.
Goodman trivializes an important argument and ignores the plain sense of all four Gospels; his historical Jesus is a fabrication of mere apologetics.  (Rabbi) JACOB NEUSNER Tampa, Fla.


Leonard L. Osten, Advertising Executive, 87

Killum Suffers Stroke

A spokesman for the school, Steve Fenk, said that Killum, 20 years old, was undergoing tests and that there had been no change in his condition since he was stricken.


Walker Gets Off To Fastest Pushoff
Herschel Walker, the Minnesota Vikings running back, burst out of the block and blasted down the 50-meter indoor ice track to register the fastest time today in the bobsled pushoff competition by which a United States Olympic team is being selected.
The top four finishers today were guaranteed spots on either the two two-man or the two four-man Olympic squads to compete for the United States next month in Albertville, France.


Focus: Los Angeles; Despite the Doldrums, Downtown Bustles
WHILE construction of new office buildings approaches a standstill in this city's downtown, the center city remains abuzz with new public works and developer-government collaborations.
Among projects in contruction or planning are a subway system and stations, a concert hall, a convention center, museums and public amenities.
Planning for most of them has been going on for years and their arrival seems unrelated to the current softness in the real estate market.

Frann E. Ziskin Marries on L.I.
Frann Ellen Ziskin, the daughter of Philip F. and Edis Ziskin of Floral Park, Queens, was married last evening to Steven Denis Greif, a son of Miriam Greif of East Falmouth, Mass., and the late Charles K. Greif.
Rabbi Haskell Bernat performed the ceremony at the Harrison Conference Center in Glen Cove, L.I.
Ms.
Ziskin, 40 years old, is keeping her name.
A cum laude graduate of the State University of New York at Buffalo, she is the president of the Weather Store and the secretary-treasurer of the American Umbrella Company, both in New York.
Her father is American Umbrella's president.
Her mother is an interior designer in New York.


2d Chance for Dempsey
He was released after the end of last season by the Milwaukee Brewers, perhaps because the Brewers couldn't remember just how valuable a catcher he could be.
Now 42-year-old RICK DEMPSEY is getting another chance.
He has been invited to spring training by the Baltimore Orioles as a non-roster player.
The Orioles do remember.
Dempsey, they recall, was the most valuable player when the Orioles beat Philadelphia in the 1983 World Series. (AP)


There's This Dentist. And He Writes Routines for Comedians. Seriously.
Hunched over a patient in his dental office and armed with a whirring drill, Dr.
Jeffrey L. Gurian might appear to be a character in a madcap comedy.
Indeed, Dr.
Gurian has the countenance of a deranged futon: hair disheveled and clothing askew.
He not only looks the part of a comedy turn, but Dr.
Gurian's alter ego actually writes gags.
Woody Allen and his entourage gave the cosmetic dentist his start as a serious writer of funny lines just after he finished dental school at Temple University in 1975.


Legal System Is Assailed on AIDS Crisis
Eleven years into an epidemic that has claimed more than 130,000 lives, AIDS-related cases fill the courts and governmental agencies of America, and in many instances, the courts seem guided more by stereotypes and misperceptions than by scientific evidence, a study released yesterday says.
The survey, the most comprehensive to date on legal actions arising out of the AIDS crisis, examined 372 of the more than 1,000 AIDS-related cases in courts and governmental agencies throughout the country.
These cases raise a panoply of legal issues, including transfusions of contaminated blood, discrimination against people with AIDS in education, employment, housing and insurance coverage to state regulation of bathhouses to the power of local governments and the military to quarantine those carrying the virus.

As Silicone Issue Grows, Women Take Agony and Anger to Court
Brenda Toole, an Atlanta school librarian, was 31 years old when she got silicone implants to make her breasts larger, and for seven years she was happy with her implants.
But in 1988, hard, painful capsules of scar tissue formed around the implants.
Her doctor tried to break them up by what was then a widely used treatment: squeezing and twisting the hard masses.
But instead of breaking up the scar tissue, the pressure ruptured both implants, spilling silicone gel inside Mrs.
Toole's chest.
She later had surgery four times to remove lumps of silicone in her breasts and armpits, and now has immune system disorders that she attributes to the silicone.
A $5.4 Million Award
Mrs.
Toole sued the Baxter Healthcare Corporation, the successor to the implant manufacturer, the Heyer-Schulte Corporation, for marketing a defective product and for negligence.
Last July a Federal District Court jury in Dothan, Ala., awarded her $5.4 million, which the judge later reduced to $2.27 million.
The case is now on appeal.

Bonilla's Stance Makes Sense
To the Sports Editor:
When Bobby Bonilla, a 1981 graduate of Herbert Lehman High School, became the highest paid athlete in professional team sports by signing a $29 million contract with the Mets, he expressed his eagerness to give something back to his old neighborhood in the Bronx, but not to his alma mater ("Millions for Bobby Bonilla, but None for His Old School," The Times, Dec. 5).

Stew: Old-Fashioned Winter Warmth
ON a cold winter day, forget grilled fish with salsa.
Nothing beats an old-fashioned stew.
In England recently, on a particularly bone-chilling day, a friend made a beef stew with dumplings, a dish I hadn't had for years.
The dumplings were light and airy, the stew rich and dark, filled with potatoes, carrots and green beans along with chunks of meat.
The dumplings contained an ingredient more familiar in the British kitchen than in America: suet.

1992 Campaign: Players; In Brash Profession, Modest Organizer for Kerrey Stands Out
Perhaps there is something about living on take-out food and sleeping on an air mattress that keeps a man looking young.

For the better part of 20 years, Mr.
Johnson has been living the life of an itinerant campaign worker.
A native of Minnesota, he has labored on behalf of almost a dozen candidates, all of them challengers, in half a dozen states.
Now he is running Senator Bob Kerrey's New Hampshire campaign from a folding table in Manchester, while his furniture sits in storage in South Dakota.

1992 Campaign: Republicans; Bush Campaign Scrambles to Put Forth a More Caring Candidate
Racing to overcome a late start and an unexpected primary challenge, the Bush re-election forces have sent the President forth in a burst of appearances intended to show that he cares about the home front and understands the suffering of the recession.
The strategy seems intended to reap maximum political advantage from the State of the Union Message on Jan. 28, when the President will lay out his program for easing the problems he now so openly acknowledges.
Indeed, some Republicans are already worrying that the White House has raised expectations for the State of the Union that it will be unable to meet.


Trips to Watch Newborn Seals
For decades the birth of thousands of harp seals in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence attracted hunters with clubs.
Now the process is greeted with tourists who take their cameras on Sealwatch tours to the gulf's Magdalen Islands in eastern Canada every March.
This year there are five trips on which travelers on one day or another -- depending on the weather -- will see mother harp seals and their fluffy whitecoat babies on the ice floes.
The tours originate in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and each is led by expert guides.
Dr.
Gary Miller, a University of New Mexico lecturer in biology, who will talk about his work in Antarctica and studies of North American wildlife, is the guest lecturer on all the tours.
The Sealwatch departures from Halifax on Feb. 29 and March 4 and 8 are six-day programs priced at $1,595 a person, in double occupancy.
A five-day trip leaves March 12 and costs $1,495; the last tour, departing March 15, which gives travelers the opportunity to visit the nurseries of both harp and hood seals, is for six days and costs $1,995.

The Esthetic Pleasure of Trees in Winter
WINTER walks are wonderful to take.
Just being outdoors is a pleasure, and walking is one sure way to see the architecture of trees.
The leaves are gone, and their barks are exposed.
One of the trees that really stands out at this time of year is the sycamore.
It can be seen for quite some distance, because the glorious bark is never as clearly visible as it is now.
Without leaves the outline is truly spectacular.
The massive tree has exfoliating bark.
That is a fancy botanist's term to describe bark that flakes off in irregular patterns to reveal what is underneath.
This pattern is what makes the sycamore worth a second look.
Some may want to describe the massive trunk as having a jigsawlike pattern.
Others may say the tree's bark appears mottled.

Despite Protests, Panel Approves Razing of Central Park Band Shell
Over the protest of the donor's descendants and numerous neighbors and preservationists, the New York City Art Commission has authorized demolition of the 69-year-old Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park.

Connecticut Has High Hopes For New Casino
Tourists in southeastern Connecticut usually head for Mystic Seaport or the Coast Guard Academy in New London, but starting next month they will also be able to gamble in a casino.
State tourism officials say the Foxwoods Casino at Ledyard on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation, seven miles from Mystic, may well prove to be the state's No. 1 attraction for 1992.
As of last week the opening date had not been set.
An official of the reservation said poker, blackjack, roulette, baccarat and craps would be available, although there would be no slot machines.
There will also be a Big 6 money wheel.
Reservation officials hope the casino will attract between 5,000 and 10,000 people a day.
The reservation has been conducting giant bingo sessions, with up to 2,000 people a game, for five years.
The official added that the casino would try to present itself as a family destination with entertainment.

Boston Mayor to Keep Embattled Police Head
With the appointment this week of William J. Bratton, the chief of the New York City transit police, as the No. 2 official in Boston's Police Department, Mayor Raymond L.

SAUDIS PRESS U.S. FOR HELP IN OUSTER OF IRAQ'S LEADER
Saudi Arabia is pressing the Bush Administration to organize a large covert action campaign in Iraq aimed at dividing Iraq's army and toppling Saddam Hussein, United States and allied officials say.
The Saudi initiative seeks an allied effort to supply arms and intelligence to Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, Shiite Muslim fighters in the south and Sunni Muslim opposition forces in central Iraq.
The aim is to draw out and divide Mr.
Hussein's last Republican Guard divisions protecting his strongholds around Baghdad and subject them to allied air assaults.

When Little Things Mean a Lot, It's Chekhov
Anton Chekhov's "Three Sisters" is a profoundly ridiculous play, and I mean that as a compliment.
His characters are bumblers and daydreamers, mired in a dull, provincial town that might as well be built on quicksand.
Their lives are foolish and aimless and amount to nothing.
If their emotions ran less deep, you could almost mistake them for those mismatched creatures in a Feydeau farce who are always slamming into closed doors or embarking on illicit affairs that end up under the bed, not on it.

U.S. Cites Risks In Philippines
Americans face security risks in the Philippines, but short-term tourists and business visitors with no visible connection to the United States Government face substantially less risk than Government officials and military personnel, says a travel advisory from the State Department.
It reports that continuing dangers to residents with official connections will remain during the withdrawal of United States forces from the Subic Naval Base.
Travel to Northern and Southern Luzon should be avoided, the advisory adds, because of the presence of the New People's Army and armed bandits, and visiting some areas of the Visayas and Mindanao Islands is not advised because of crime and insurgency.
Visitors are urged to check with the American Embassy in Manila or the consulate in Cebu about conditions in areas they plan to visit.
The department also warns about mud flows that can inundate low-lying areas and wash away bridges.

In her 35 years of living in her Bronx neighborhood, she had never seen anything quite like this: 34 motorcycle police officers in the middle of the street, dozens of other officers climbing out of buses and a police helicopter hovering overhead.

Christmas Bird Count Lifts Hopes
AS the results of the 1991 Christmas Bird Count in Westchester are being tabulated, new sightings and several promising trends are being reported by birders and ornithologists.
Most notably, the bald eagle, not seen in the county since the 1960's, appears to be making a comeback, primarily the result of a State Department of Environmental Conservation effort to reintroduce the species.
Members of the Bronx-Westchester Christmas Bird Count team spotted a young bald eagle at the Edith G. Read Natural Park and Wildlife Sanctuary in Rye on Dec. 22, the first time the species had been counted in 40 years.


Rail Europe
To the Editor: In March we too had a problem with Rail Europe, and felt we should warn about trying to purchase French Rail tickets for the overnight train from Venice to Paris.
We were informed that we had to make our train reservations for the T-2 sleeper by telephone to White Plains.
After numerous attempts with the always-busy telephone lines, we contacted a travel agent with American Express to get reservations for early June.


Mexicans Come to Work, but Find Dead Ends
Bordered by factories and docks, the Magnolia Park neighborhood has long been a beacon for generations of Mexican immigrants seeking sturdy homes and steady wages.
Over time, most found jobs, assimilated and moved on to a better life.
But that is much less the case nowadays.
The neighborhood is as much a place to stay poor as it is to start poor.
Upward mobility among the 14 million people of Mexican descent in the United States -- the nation's fastest-growing major ethnic group -- is faltering, and on Magnolia Park's shady streets the signs of trouble are everywhere: high-school dropouts, teen-age mothers, families doubled and tripled up in bungalows, and day-laborers who gather at street corners hoping to sell their services.

Her father is the chairman of the First National Bank of North Tarrytown, N.Y.


Many Depressions Are Chemically Based
"Detecting Depression in the Elderly"  [ Dec. 8 ]  brought up the subject of using medication to treat depression, but only in passing.
Medium to major forms of depression are always biochemically based, and antidepressant medication has been proven to be an effective treatment in all populations, including the elderly.
Yet the stigma attached to any form of "mental illness" is so great that patients do not seek the help they need.
If someone required medication to treat diabetes, you can bet they would see a doctor and get it.

Headliners; . . . Now You Don't
It was a fairly abrupt disappearance for a planet 10 times as massive as Earth.
But Dr.
Andrew G. Lyne, who reported in July that he had discovered the first planet outside this solar system, confessed last week that he had discovered something new: the body supposedly orbiting pulsar PSR 1829-10 was instead a figment of his miscalculation.
Dr.
Lyne and his colleagues at the University of Manchester in England study radio signals emanating from the spinning core of a collapsed star 30,000 light-years away.
They found fluctations every six months and assumed they were caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet.
But they had apparently failed to compensate for variations in Earth's orbit around the sun.
Once this was taken into account, Dr.
Lyne said, the "planet just evaporated." Other scientists said Dr.
Lyne retained his reputation as a careful researcher and, recalling past science scandals, praised the straightforward way he had corrected his work.

At Longwood Gallery, Selections Both Natural and Otherwise
EDGAR BUONAGURIO'S show is in the right space here at the Longwood Arts Gallery: a dazzling white room lighted by a window so large that on a sunny day visitors need dark glasses.
His display is titled "Selections: The Archeological Find Series," but in this setting it looks more like a harbinger of spring.
At a distance, the eight pieces on the walls pass for manhole covers made, unaccountably, of flower petals.
But in reality they are mandalas cut from thick plywood -- circles with edges smooth and serrated, an open- work star -- which are smoothly primed and painted.
Having applied his pigment in small puddles, side by side and one on top of another, Mr.
Buonagurio then takes an industrial sander and other more conventional tools to the surface so that the burnished results resemble inlay, marbling, even Islamic ornament seen through water.

U.S. Human Rights Office Grows in Influence
Patricia M. Derian, the first Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, has vivid memories of her early days in office.
She recalls that she was often resented, ridiculed or ignored, and certainly not taken very seriously.
"After I had been there awhile, I invited all the other assistant secretaries to a meeting so that I could tell them what it was that I was there to do," she recalls.
"It was one of those times when you're talking and people look away, extremely embarrassed at this naive display. They thought, this is going to be some little creampuff here."


The Silly Putty Story
To the Editor:
The full story of Silly Putty's origins ("Silly Putty, Now a Classic," All About/Silicone Products, Dec. 29) is one of the zaniest chapters in the history of the General Electric Research Laboratory, and offered some welcome relief from the feverish activity of World War II.
I was not a participant but I was privy to the details because of my work in the lab's pilot plant.

Tense Encounter
The British interviewer David Frost likes to give the impression of relaxation when interrogating world leaders on television.
Yet in his most recent annual chat with President Bush, the key word was
tense
.
"Do you sometimes wish," Mr.
Frost wondered as if innocently, "that as a condition of the cease-fire you had asked for Saddam Hussein to be handed over?"


Keep 'Big Brother' Out of Newspaper Sales
To the Editor:
As someone with no satisfactory conservative alternative to The New York Times, I can sympathize with Stephen R. Barnett's frustration at the growing concentration of power in the newspaper industry ("A Conservative Look in Newsprint," Forum, Dec. 29).
Faced with rising costs, falling circulation and competition from other media, many newspapers are in financial trouble.
It's understandably tempting to look to the government to "do something" as Professor Barnett advocates.
But market forces cannot be permanently suppressed and it is counterproductive to attempt to hold them back.

Gourmet Or Gourmand?
To the Editor:
I read with interest the article "Bob Ross, the Frugal Gourmet of Painting"  [ Dec. 22 ] .
As an arts educator, I am dismayed that anyone thinks of Mr.
Ross as either an artist or art teacher.
Making art is saying something, taking a risk and solving a problem.
Mr.
Ross does none of these.
He paints the same trite composition over and over.

Sunday Outing; A Winter Retreat, Only 90 Miles From New York
From the tower at Sky Top, the highest point along the hiking trails in and around the Mohonk Preserve here, the 360-degree view is a spectacular introduction to the winter landscape of the Shawangunk Mountains and beyond.
On a clear day, visitors who climb up an interior stairway to the top of a 50-foot-high stone tower at Sky Top, which is 1,500 feet above sea level, can see six states -- New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont.
Below, visitors will see a network of trails that open up the rugged terrain of the Shawangunk range to hikers, horseback riders, bird watchers and cross-country skiers.


Transcending The Ordinary
To the Editor:
Edward Rothstein misses the point entirely, using overanalysis and opaque logic, in his essay on John Corigliano's new opera, "The Ghosts of Versailles"  [ "At the Met, Ghosts Come to Applaud 'Ghosts,' " Jan. 5 ] .
Mr.
Corigliano's opera should cause us to remember what draws us to opera in the first place: to transcend the ordinary through a unique art form, as well as to be entertained by the best the lyric stage has to offer.


The Executive Computer; New Ways to 'Paste' a Photo Into Your Documents
Logitech Inc.'s new Fotoman camera is designed expressly to capture images for the personal computer, bypassing conventional film in favor of memory chip.
And using it is a snap.
While the quality of Fotoman's images leaves a lot to be desired, Fotoman is an interesting harbinger of the future of photography.
The digital Fotoman camera, which sells on average for under $600, is but one of several types of unconventional cameras that are emerging in the computer and video age.
The computer offers new ways to capture, store, manipulate and use photographs -- eliminating film processing and other production chores.

The Rev.

The bride's previous marriage ended in divorce.
Mr.

CLOSED BEACH TIED TO MAN ON BARGE
Because a New Jersey man has a back problem, a major New York City beach was shut down for part of last Labor Day weekend, law-enforcement authorities say.
The beach, at Jacob Riis Park on the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, was closed after 150 used hypodermic needles and empty drug bottles washed up.
It was the first major dumping of medical trash discovered in the metropolitan region's waters since the summer of 1988.
That year, such debris and other pollutants drove away vacationgoers on beaches from Montauk Point, L.I., to Cape May, N.J., and reduced income from tourists.

Slaughter of Wild Birds Should Be Discouraged
A longstanding member of the National Audubon Society, I was saddened and stunned by the article entitled "Matching Wits With Ducks and Geese," which appeared Dec. 29.
In this age of "environmental enlightenment" it seems contradictory, indeed, that such questionable practices as the wholesale slaughter of wild birds continue to be encouraged with impunity despite the drastic decline in the numbers of existing waterfowl in recent years.
The most chilling aspect of your informative commentary is the photograph of a child cheerfully clasping a gun.
Is this a preview of our future "age of enlightenment" or will the year 2000 usher in yet another century of indifference to the survival of wildlife?

By Any Name, Lviv Has Hard Times
The people of this handsome but weary 700-year-old city, once the heart of western Ukrainian culture, seem too busy in the first weeks of national independence to enjoy the less tangible benefits of freedom from Russia.
They are busy, like the rest of the country, trying to find food at reasonable prices, worrying if their salaries will go up, wondering if independence might mean a bigger apartment.
And they wonder what the Government of President Leonid M. Kravchuk, 300 miles to the east in Kiev, is going to do for them.


In the Mafia, Too, a Decline in Standards
ON the surface, the struggle for dominance between two factions of the Colombo crime family that has claimed the lives of five gangsters and an innocent bystander in Brooklyn in the last two months flaunts the power and ruthlessness of the Mafia in the New York region.
But many organized-crime experts believe the gunfire signals the decay, not the strength, of the New York City area's five Mafia families.
The Colombo family civil war, the experts maintain, is solid evidence of a widespread phenomenon: the breakdown of autocratic leadership and dissension in the lower ranks.


Americans Are Daring To Dream on the Slopes
The little upstate New York community of Lake Placid has always been a place for American optimism.
After all, it's where the hockey team captured the 1980 gold medal and draped itself in the flag.
But rarely have this country's followers -- yes, they're out there -- of the Nordic combined and ski-jumping events been so optimistic as they are about the Olympic teams that will be selected on the man-made snow at Lake Placid starting Wednesday.
These young Americans might not be good enough to win.
No American has ever taken a medal in the Nordic combined (ski-jumping coupled with cross-country skiing), and it has been 68 years since an American won this country's one and only medal -- a bronze -- in ski jumping.
But they are good enough to inspire dreams.


POSTINGS: Teeing Off on Randalls Island; Mostly for Golfers
Construction will begin this spring on a 25-acre private sports complex on Randalls Island that will include a golf driving range, two 18-hole, illuminated miniature golf courses, a batting-cage complex with 18 batting stations and a clubhouse.
The $2.5 million project, which is being financed by the American Golf Corporation of Santa Monica, Calif., is scheduled to open in the spring of next year on land leased from the Department of Parks.
The company will pay the city a minimum of $500,000 a year as part of the lease agreement.


CRIME
Part police procedural, part Big Boys' Adventure Book, THE BLACK ECHO (Little, Brown, $19.95), a first novel by Michael Connelly, a Los Angeles Times reporter, is one of those books you read with your knuckles -- just hanging on until it's over.
The story burrows into dangerous foreign territory for a procedural -- the Vietnam background alone yields a tortuous subplot about war profiteering -- but the force of the narrative keeps shooting it around these tricky bends.
Even at their most implausible moments, Mr.
Connelly's claustrophobic scenes of robberies and manhunts in airless underground chambers are good and thrilling.


Judith Germeroth, a Teacher, Is to Marry in July
Mr. and Mrs.
Robert M. Germeroth of Nesconset, L.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter Judith Anne Germeroth to Philip John Conner, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Gerald Conner of Amherst, N.Y.
A July wedding is planned.
Miss Germeroth, 25 years old, is a special-education teacher at the Niagara Street School in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
She graduated from the State University College of New York at Geneseo, as did her fiance.
Mr.
Conner, 26, is a landscaper.


The Genius of Jaisalmer
DESERTS and their mirages have long inspired poets: the pitiless sun reflected by the burning sand, the golden city shimmering on a hill are compelling images, as are the long lines of swaying camels.
Occasionally, however, the fantasy proves to be real: that is the case of Jaisalmer, once a major stop for the caravans that crossed the Indian state of Rajasthan, and now a magically beautiful survivor of the past.
Even the approach to Jaisalmer takes the traveler into a fairy-tale world: hire a car and driver at Jodhpur, and you will find yourself crossing a semi-desert of gently rolling tawny hills inhabited by troops of camels, gatherings of deer and large congregations of free-roaming peacocks.
Then, about two-thirds of the way, the sand takes over.
For a while, there is nothing much to see except the changing light; and then, in the distance, crowning a hill, a silhouette appears.


Amy Schulman Is to Be Married
Mr. and Mrs.
Leonard Schulman of Harrison, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Amy Elizabeth Schulman, to David Lawrence Nagler, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

An August wedding is planned.
Miss Schulman, 24 years old, graduated from Johns Hopkins University and is a law student at Yeshiva University.
Her father, a lawyer, owns an accounting business in New York.
Her mother, Loretta Schulman, teaches in the public school system in Rye, N.Y.


Topics of The Times; Mother Nature vs. Hollywood
On the street at the southeast corner of New York City's Central Park Thursday morning, a sturdy red fire engine from Windsor, Vt., was noisily pumping water from a city hydrant into a hose that snaked into the park.
At the nozzle end, beside the duck pond, it sprayed the trees and paths with mist, making snow for a scene in Hollywood's "Home Alone II." Another hose, high on a crane, sprayed nearby.
It was all very pretty -- and unnatural.

Englewood Considers A Longer School Year
WHILE most discussion about a longer school day and year remains in the abstract, Englewood schools are on their way to making the concept a reality.
This month the district convened a committee of community and school representatives to investigate whether to extend the school year to a minimum of 200 days.
As in most school districts in New Jersey, Englewood's public schools are currently in session 180 days.
The proposal would also lengthen the school day to at least seven hours from six and a quarter hours.


An Artist Infuses Niches and Walls With Light and Life
MARINA RASINI loves to bring the outdoors inside.
Her trompe l'oeil lemon trees bear ripe fruit in foyers, and her porpoises leap exuberantly on screens.
And always, there is sunlight.
"I try to achieve light," said the 36-year-old artist as she sipped tea in the living room of her home in Darien.
Drawing on the Mediterranean light of her native Italy, Mrs.
Rasini's landscapes bask in the sun.
She is frequently called to paint Old World-style scenes in dark or small entrance halls.
"Lemon trees I use a lot," she said.
"They are happy, very colorful and nice. I love the big pots of clay."


Mutual Funds; Closed-End Gains for 1991
As a group, closed-end stock funds rocketed in 1991, gaining an average of 41 percent for the year, compared with a rise of 30.5 percent in Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
Prices for closed-end funds, which trade on exchanges like common stock, are set by supply and demand so fund shares can trade at a premium or discount to the value of the securities in their portfolios.
Their 1991 performance showed how the leverage built into closed-end funds works: because the stock market was so strong, the shares held by the funds rose.
And because the funds did well, investors clamored for them, pushing up prices of the closed-end-fund shares themselves, said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment adviser.


Mr. Bush's Momentum for Peace
President Bush, who needs a lift, deserves high praise for skillful promotion and deft nurturing of the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
For the first time in 43 years, old adversaries have actually engaged in direct negotiations -- and what appears to be falling is not the heavens but an Israeli Government whose divisions have been an obstacle to peace.
For all the gloomy day-to-day tidings about deadlocked talks, political rows in Jerusalem and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli settlers, the underlying news may be hopeful indeed.


Anne Swinton Plans Wedding
Dr. and Mrs.
Neil W. Swinton Jr. of Newton, Mass., have announced the engagement of their daughter Anne Bradley Swinton to Rudy Lamont Ruggles 3d, a son of Rudy L. Ruggles Jr. of Ridgefield, Conn., and the late Nancy O. Meeker.
An August wedding is planned.
Ms.
Swinton, 25 years old, graduated from Princeton University and until recently taught at the Obirin High School in Machida, Japan.
Her father, a cardiologist, is the assistant chief of the medical division of the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass.
Her mother, Elizabeth de Sabato Swinton, is the curator of Asian art at the Worcester (Mass.) Art Museum.


Sunday Menu; A Hearty One-Dish Dinner
Rather than turning up one's nose at all things frozen, it is more profitable to pick and choose judiciously.
There are three frozen vegetables worth keeping in the freezer: corn niblets, peas and lima beans.
With that in mind, a trip to the store for this meal would entail only the purchase of some low-fat sausages, like those made by Bruce Aidells, and a few mushrooms.
The Aidells sausages are sold at many fancy-food markets.

The Man Who Dreamed of Fairyland
How fine it would be if one were able to wander the Irish countryside accompanied by an erudite friend capable of spouting precisely appropriate lines by William Butler Yeats at the proper moments.

YEATS: Images of Ireland (Macmillan, $35) captures well the Ireland that Yeats knew and loved and wrote about, "where all outward things were the image of an inward life." Alain Le Garsmeur's reserved yet knowing photographs, in both color and black and white, are untainted by any nostalgic glow.
They are accompanied by the scholar Bernard McCabe's useful and informative chronology and introductory essay, and paired with exceedingly well-chosen extracts from Yeats's poetry, memoirs, essays and plays.
The photographs illuminate the text, while the text adds depth and meaning to the pictures.
This elegant volume makes accessible the subtle passions and simplicities of the mental and physical Irish landscapes.


At Home With a Zebra Table And a Skeleton Chair
William McCartyCooper used two kinds of period furnishings in the interiors he designed -- conservative (for his clients) and eccentric (for himself).
Among the exotic objects in his Los Angeles home were chairs carved in the shape of an elephant and a human skeleton, plus a table with stuffed zebra legs.
On Saturday, these witty, some might say weird, items will be auctioned, along with 300 other furnishings from the McCarty-Cooper estate, at Christie's in New York in a sale estimated to bring as much as $3 million.

Some Comic Anarchy From Joe Orton
"YOU can't be rational in an irrational world. It's not rational." Such a blast of irrefutable logic could have sprung up in the wonderland of Lewis Carroll.
But what about an exchange like this?
"We must tell the truth!" "That's a thoroughly defeatist attitude." Is this not stylistically worthy of Oscar Wilde?
How about the observation that "the high reaches of the civil service are recruited entirely from corpses or madmen"?


1992 Campaign: Political Memo; Using Ads to Cast Star of White House Series
Thanks to the Presidential advertising campaigns that began this week, television viewers here have been learning day and night about some tough yet compassionate men who can swim the butterfly, shake hands with construction workers, defend a hockey net and still find time to personally provide health care and a job to everyone in America, including the middle class.
Faced with such frequent messages from such caring individuals, many citizens here have done their best to forget the entire experience.
It is still easy to find serious television viewers who cannot recall the name of a single Democratic candidate.
Some people even claim they have not seen any of the advertisements.


Signs of Hope For a Cultural City In Fiscal Distress
Yes, New York is in trouble.
Yes, the city's spirit is down in the dumps.
And yes, it's getting almost tiresome to hear everyone point to the city's cultural richness as one of the very few reasons to have any hope about New York's future.
After all, since there's no money, the cultural institutions that make New York what it is can hardly be getting any better, right?
By now it's a commonplace to observe that some museums and theater companies are struggling just to pay the electric bill.
True enough.
But somehow in this time of recession, three of the city's greatest cultural institutions -- the Brooklyn Museum, Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall -- have managed to expand their reach and their range with superb new construction that enriches the city considerably.
All three projects represent skillful mergings of private philanthropy and public funds, and if the seeds for them were sown in the prosperous 80's, the benefits are ours to reap in the troubled 90's.


Headliners; In Limbo
"Who am I?" the book begins.
"A name on a waiting list. A Muslim by heredity. If I were born in an atheist mold, I would have been one." For those and other sentiments offensive to Islamic fundamentalists in "The Distance in a Man's Mind," Alla Hamed, an Egyptian government clerk who writes novels in his spare time, finds himself in a frightening limbo these days.
Last month a judge found the book to be "a threat to national unity and social peace" and sentenced the author, along with the book's publisher and distributor, to eight years in prison.
International writers' organizations are protesting the sentence, which is being appealed to the Prime Minister's office.
Meanwhile, Mr.
Hamed has stopped going to work because his colleagues ostracize him and has left his apartment because of death threats.
"I never thought it would result in this," he said.
"I thought maybe it would be banned, but not see us all go to prison."


Frosty Aqueduct Draws 11,988 'Franchise Players'
On the frostiest weekend of the winter, 60 horses ran in 9 races without complaining yesterday at Aqueduct while their riders pulled on thicker gloves, woolen headbands and longsleeved cotton undershirts and said, in effect, the show must go on.
And the show did go on before an audience of 11,988, with the temperature struggling to stay in the 20's while the whipping wind made it seem more like 6 below.
Most of the stars of the business, horses and trainers and jockeys alike, were doing their January thing at Gulfstream Park in Florida or at Santa Anita in California, warming up for the main events of the racing year.
But back in arctic New York, the rest of the cast was still staging nine races a day, six days a week.


Hoya Guard Drops Out
Sophomore guard CHARLES HARRISON, Georgetown's second-leading scorer this season, has dropped out of school, Coach JOHN THOMPSON said yesterday.
"Charlie has decided that attending a junior college would permit him to step away from basketball and enable him to strengthen his g.p.a.," Thompson said, referring to the player's grade point average.
"Charles and I will make a decision at a later date as to whether he will return to Georgetown."

Noted With Pleasure
How to Create a Cuisine
Reflecting on the qualities necessary for the creation of a uniquely American cuisine, the writer and gourmet ("buongustaio") Angelo Pellegrini suggests that the crucial element is our attitude toward life.
This is from "Vintage Pellegrini: The Collected Wisdom of an American Buongustaio," edited by Schuyler Ingle (Sasquatch Books).
The American, lacking the spur of necessity and engrossed in the exploitation of resources with which no other nation has been blessed in anything like the same degree, has been understandably satisfied to feed on plain meat and potatoes.
His curiosity about culinary matters, of relatively recent origin, is an encouraging sign.
If he would proceed wisely, however, he must remember that the evolution of a traditional cuisine requires time.
His immediate concern should be a willingness to experiment, an insistence upon quality, a purging of his mind of all culinary prejudice, and the development of a humane attitude toward the dinner hour.
These, and not a slavish imitation of foreign recipes and esoteric menus, are the bases upon which a sound American cuisine may be eventually developed.
The Writer as Worker
Our image of writing as a magical act obscures the reality of the hard work that writers do and the true nature of a writer's life, according to the novelist Valerie Miner.
This is from "Rumors From the Cauldron: Selected Essays, Reviews and Reportage" (University of Michigan, paper).
Tensions arise between audience and author when we confuse the writing with the writer herself.
Most Americans romanticize art as magic.
We perceive literature as the result of "creativity" rather than "creative labor," forgetting that writers are workers.
We invest the writer with special powers, in part because we want to experience the romance vicariously. . . .
When we confuse the writing with the writer, we often expect her to be a stronger or more sensitive or more developed human being. . . .
Acknowledging writing as work might have pervasive consequences.
It might result in a less neurotic relationship between writers and readers.
It might encourage better wages and working conditions for artists.
It might inspire a clearer portrayal of working-class people in our books.
It might open a light on how art can emerge from and contribute to an impulse for social change.
Doing Without the Gods
Cultures define themselves in the stories of their beginnings, and for that purpose, the scholar Dudley Young suggests, mythology has often been a more efficient tool than science.
This is from "Origins of the Sacred: The Ecstasies of Love and War" (St. Martin's).
Science, to put it bluntly, is uneasy with beginnings.
Mythology, on the contrary, is concerned above all with what happened "in the beginning." . . .
Its signature is "Once upon a time," and its characteristic way of bridging the gap between nonbeing and being is to imagine gods and goddesses to step over it.
But it differs most importantly from science in that its explanatory account of how we began is also a prescriptive account of how subsequent beginnings (which renew the cosmos) should proceed; the Last Supper, for example, tells us not only how the Christian era began but how its energies can be periodically renewed in a communion meal that commemorates and recalls its inception.
Modern poets such as Wallace Stevens have inherited from the myth makers of old the disposition to supply the perennial human need for once-upon-a-time stories that also inform our own beginnings, but they realize that such stories must on the whole do without the gods and goddesses of old, about whom we have become skeptical.
Our Restless Species
Humans, the biologist John Janovy Jr. observes, are among the most footloose of species, relying in part on travel to help us define ourselves.
This is from "Vermilion Sea: A Naturalist's Journey in Baja California" (Houghton Mifflin).
Pilgrimages seem to be almost instinctive, or at least derived from behaviors now so ingrained in our species that it's difficult to distinguish between genetic and social origins.
Of all the animals that migrate, we are surely among the most restless.
But humans retain the influence of the geophysical habitat in which they pass their formative years.
And often, it seems, we are drawn back to our childhood homes -- if not physically, then mentally; if not out of love, then out of curiosity; if not by necessity, then by desire.
Through such returnings we find out who we are.
The Decline of Artful Swearing
We tend to believe that we live in the most enlightened of times, a view not borne out -- at least in the arena of frank language -- by a close study of history, as Geoffrey Hughes notes in "Swearing: A Social History of Foul Language, Oaths and Profanity in English" (Blackwell).
Although the view that there has been considerable liberation in modern times has much truth in it, the interpretation of a steady advance to enlightenment is simplistic.
Such a view would hold that the constraints of medieval times were overthrown in the Renaissance, that there was a steady liberalization through the Enlightenment, a Puritanical regression in Victorian times, and a final throwing off of the shackles in the postwar era.
Curiously, nearly all of these generalizations are inaccurate.
Chaucer and many medieval writers had more freedom than their Renaissance successors; the Enlightenment saw a steady clamping down on strong or risque language, while the Victorian era showed a remarkable efflorescence of strong and foul language, in some ways surpassing that of modern times.
However, it took place out of earshot of "polite society."

David Gelernter's Romance With Linda
Last fall, computer scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California unplugged a Cray supercomputer and replaced it with 14 I.B.M.
RS/6000 work stations, each the size of an orange crate, and wired them together.
When the scientists turned on the new network, which cost about $1 million, they discovered that it was just as powerful as the old Cray X/MP, which had cost $20 million several years before.
And the scientists believe that for solving some types of scientific problems, the network can easily be made as powerful as the latest-model Cray, the Y/MP C-90, which costs $20 million to $30 million.


Assailing Iran, Algeria Recalls Its Envoy
Reflecting the deterioration of what used to be warm relations, Algeria recalled its Ambassador to Iran today and asked the Iranian Ambassador here to leave the country.
The moves were a reaction to Teheran's unabashed support of Algeria's Islamic fundamentalist opposition, which was in the process of winning a majority in the new Algerian Parliament before the Government canceled the vote.
A senior Algerian foreign affairs official said tonight that Algeria had demanded a "clear and public" reversal of the criticism of the Algiers Government that has appeared in the official Iranian press in the week since the cancellation.

Cuttings; So the Seeds of the Past Can Give Future Delight
Saving species doesn't have to mean sending money to the Amazon rain forest.
You can save some in your own backyard by planting seeds that will produce the same kinds of grain, beans or flowers that were grown for thousands of years by Native Americans or farmers in Eurasia.
By doing so, you will help protect the gene pool, which has been seriously depleted by hundreds of years of hybridization.
When tomatoes, for example, are bred for high production, good looks and the kind of rubbery skin that can survive shipping, the genes that carry flavor or resistance to pests and disease are often lost forever.

Review/Dance; A Minimalist Segment Of 'Nixon In China'

A program that offered everything from a chorus line in Chinese pajamas to expressions of existential angst and a display of good manners by dancers in tutus, made the company's artistic profile something of a blur.
Yet even here one could ferret out a common idea rooted in the City Ballet's esthetic, which is the use of music as a springboard.

Arab-Israeli Chasm; After Third Round of Talks in Washington, The Old Adversaries Are Still Far Apart
There have been three rounds now of direct talks between Israelis and Arabs since the dramatic Madrid peace conference, and it is still hard to succinctly summarize exactly where the negotiations stand.
They have clearly not achieved the high expectations raised at the formal opening in Madrid last October of the regional peace conference, but they have not broken down either.
After much procedural wrangling, the old adversaries are finally talking substance, but their talks only show how far apart they really are.

... And Some Call for a Voice
When one young actor landed his first speaking role, in Brian De Palma's "Untouchables," he was understandably thrilled.
But when he took his girlfriend to see him perform what he considered to be five particularly meaty lines, his reaction was less enthusiastic.
There he was on screen, but when his mouth opened, the voice that emerged belonged to some other actor.
Perhaps he shouldn't have been so surprised.
As anyone familiar with the plot of the 1952 classic "Singin' in the Rain" knows, silent-screen stars with less-than-perfect voices made the leap into talkies by having their lines spoken by unknowns with more mellifluous tones.
Ever since, the movie industry has been using voice doubles -- performers hired to sing or speak for actors on screen, who may be less talented vocally, unavailable or even dead.

These shoes and boots, which come in bright colors, are either water resistant or molded without seams to be completely waterproof.

The Man Who Dreamed of Fairyland
How fine it would be if one were able to wander the Irish countryside accompanied by an erudite friend capable of spouting precisely appropriate lines by William Butler Yeats at the proper moments.

YEATS: Images of Ireland (Macmillan, $35) captures well the Ireland that Yeats knew and loved and wrote about, "where all outward things were the image of an inward life." Alain Le Garsmeur's reserved yet knowing photographs, in both color and black and white, are untainted by any nostalgic glow.
They are accompanied by the scholar Bernard McCabe's useful and informative chronology and introductory essay, and paired with exceedingly well-chosen extracts from Yeats's poetry, memoirs, essays and plays.
The photographs illuminate the text, while the text adds depth and meaning to the pictures.
This elegant volume makes accessible the subtle passions and simplicities of the mental and physical Irish landscapes.

In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester; Little Relief Seen for Connecticut Hotels
THE new year is not expected to bring much relief to Connecticut's beleaguered hotels.
Since 1989, the industry has been battered by the loss or contraction of corporations within the state, by a general cutback in business travel, a decline in tourism and the brute force of the recession in New England.
"In most cases Connecticut hotels are doing as poorly as last year or worse," said Ronald Balmer, director of the Connecticut Hotel-Motel Association in Hartford.
"They are hunkering down and cutting back. General managers are doing middle level-tasks. Some properties are closing entire floors and some are in the hands of lenders."

For Actors, TV Can Upstage Broadway
This past Fall, when The Fox comedy series "Roc" had its premiere, the sitcom was regarded as something of a first for network television.
Almost the entire cast, beginning with the star, Charles Dutton, had been hired from the 1990 Broadway production of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama "The Piano Lesson."
But "Roc" is only one of several series employing stage actors as regulars.
While television and the New York theater have often borrowed each other's players, lately there seem to be more stage-trained actors than ever on television.
Among those appearing on network shows are such theater veterans as Sam Waterston ("I'll Fly Away" on NBC), Angela Lansbury ("Murder, She Wrote" on CBS), Patti LuPone ("Life Goes On" on ABC), Swoosie Kurtz ("Sisters" on NBC), Barnard Hughes ("Blossom" on NBC) and the comedian and performance artist Ann Magnuson ("Anything but Love" on ABC).

Technology; Immune-Cell Modification Outside the Body
If you cannot deliver a drug to a cell, take the cell to the drug.
That is the premise behind Applied Immune Sciences Inc.'s Cellector, a novel biotechnology device for treating disease by manipulating immune system cells outside the body.
The company's ultimate goal: restarting a patient's own immune system.
For all their promise in the laboratory, many potential biotechnology drugs have proved disappointing in the human body.
One reason is that it is difficult to deliver them to the disease site in sufficient concentration without side effects.
Indeed, several biotech companies are primarily seeking to develop targeting mechanisms that could turn these drugs into "magic bullets" that could home in on diseased cells while bypassing healthy organs.

Topics of The Times; Jury's Out. So's the Judge.
While a Federal jury in Buffalo weighs the liability of New York officials in the bloody 1971 Attica prison uprising, the judge is vacationing in Barbados.
Such outrageous judicial indifference risks the reputation of the entire Federal bench.
It also risks legal error that could prolong litigation that has taken two decades and a three-month trial to reach this juncture.
Judge John Elfvin is an otherwise productive semi-retired judge who, at age 74, helps his colleagues by handling a reduced caseload for the Western District of New York.
But he has acted irresponsibly in going through with his long-planned vacation with the jury out.
He has left the case to a magistrate with instructions to call him if the jury returns with any "substantive question" about evidence or the judge's instructions.

The defenders for the America's Cup laid their cards on the table last week in four races conducted under the watchful eye of international challengers.
But like the card shark who hides his ace under the table, Dennis Conner is perceived by others as holding back.
Top challenge skippers acknowledge that William Koch's America 3 effort could beat Conner in the defense trials.
But several maintain that the only way Koch can do it is with better technology.

A Leaner A.T.&amp;T. Returns to Lower Manhattan
After nine years in mid-Manhattan, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company is returning downtown -- much smaller than when it left -- to a tower in TriBeCa that it built six decades ago.
Employees have already begun to leave the current headquarters at 550 Madison Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets, the company said last week.
Most will move to a 27-story building at 32 Avenue of the Americas, between Walker and Lispenard Streets.
That structure, known as the Long Distance Building when it opened in 1932, will become A.T.&amp;T. headquarters on March 1.


Perverted Love vs. Revenge
The world's richest woman brings her sedan chair back to Broadway on Thursday when Jane Alexander opens in "The Visit" by Friedrich Durrenmatt, with the Roundabout Theater Company at the Criterion Center.
The mordant tragicomedy about money and a town's willingness to literally kill for it was directed by Peter Brook in 1958 to great success in New York and on the road.
The play's stars were the Lunts, making their final appearance, though not without some changes first.
Maurice Valency, the adapter, calls them softenings.
Robert Whitehead, one of the original producers, says adjustments.
In "The Fabulous Lunts," the biographer Jared Brown says that Mr.
Brook, Mr.
Valency and the Lunts wanted to make revisions "calculated to appeal to American audiences by eliminating some of the grotesque elements and emphasizing the love-hate relationship of the major characters." (Lynn Fontanne was the billionairess Claire Zachanassian and Alfred Lunt the betrayer Anton Schill, who pays the ultimate price. Harris Yulin plays that role in the current production.)

Review/Rock; John Mellencamp's Carnival
For John Mellencamp, it's not only rock-and-roll.
Before his show at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on Thursday night, a classical string quartet recording was piped in over the speaker system.
Mr.
Mellencamp's warm-up act was a juggler, and a clown on stilts roamed the audience.
Behind a bright red stage that looked like a circus podium was a backdrop of a painting by the German Expressionist artist Max Beckmann; strands of bright lights hung from the ceiling in the outline of a giant tent.
It is seldom that an arena stage set so drastically affects the tone of a performance, but the dark carnival aura remained throughout the entire first half of the show.
Like a post- modern drum roll, a pre-recorded- tape of a synthesized dance beat ushered the band onto the stage, and the concert began with "Love and Happiness," the opening track from Mr.
Mellencamp's 10th and latest album, "Whenever We Wanted" (Mercury).
From there Mr.
Mellencamp constructed a loose and shadowy fable of Americana, made up mostly of songs from his three previous albums: "Big Daddy" (1989), "The Lonesome Jubilee" (1987) and "Scarecrow" (1985).

Stew: Old-Fashioned Winter Warmth
ON a cold winter day, forget grilled fish with salsa.
Nothing beats an old-fashioned stew.
In England recently, on a particularly bone-chilling day, a friend made a beef stew with dumplings, a dish I hadn't had for years.
The dumplings were light and airy, the stew rich and dark, filled with potatoes, carrots and green beans along with chunks of meat.
The dumplings contained an ingredient more familiar in the British kitchen than in America: suet.


Out of Sync With the 40's
To the Editor:
A bas "Bugsy"!
All three Times film critics include "Bugsy" in their reports on "the good news" of the year past  [ Dec. 29 ] .
Is there no one to say how falsely and contemptuously "Bugsy" treats its period?

Review/Jazz; Dizzy Gillespie &amp; Company
It didn't take long for Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation orchestra to get warmed up and hopping on Tuesday night.
A minute or two into the first tune, "Manteca," the horns started shouting together, the percussionists found the beat, and the band was off.
Mr.
Gillespie, in his second week at the Blue Note with a small orchestra featuring musicians familiar with both the Afro-Cuban and jazz traditions, was in his element.
In this case, his element included leading the band.
Mr.
Gillespie didn't play much trumpet, but he cued the other musicians, making adjustments in the rhythm section and calling on soloists to improvise.
When he did play -- on a swerving, bent solo during "Night in Tunisia," -- he sounded fine, with his accents placed irregularly, falling at odd places in phrases, making them jump with surprise.


Schubert: Eternally Feminine?
According to a recent "Great Composers" biography for children, Franz Schubert "fell in and out of love as frequently as any healthy young man" but was chronically poor and shy.
He was so much in awe of Beethoven that "he was petrified and ran out of the room when the great man asked him a question."
According to recent scholarship, Schubert was a member of a stigmatized and clandestine homosexual subculture.
His bohemian marginality signified not reticence but stubborn independence: freedom from familial constraint and social convention.

On Videophones and 'Talkies' . . .  . . . And Wishing A.T.&amp; T. Luck
To the Editor:
"Videophone: A Flop That Won't Die" is unfair to A.T.&amp; .T.
What happened in the 1960's with Picturephone is irrelevant to the 1990's Videophone.
In the 1960's, you needed special phone lines costing hundreds of dollars a month and you could only talk to the handful of others with those lines.
Not so today.
A.T.&amp; .T.'s Videophone works on normal phone lines.


The Executive Life CENTRAL CITY, Colo.; Charming His Way To a Second Gold Rush
Less than an hour's drive from the big city of Denver, this picturesque Victorian hamlet is so folksy that the nearest coffee shop -- a good 10 miles down the interstate -- keeps the mugs of its regulars conveniently hanging on one wall.
You'll find no shopping malls here.
You can't even buy milk or bread.
But you might pick up some nice Gold Rush memorabilia at the Lost Gold Mine, where tourists can root around the hollows of a closed-down shaft.
This is not exactly the kind of boom town where a flashy Hawaiian developer might be prone to plant his next project.
Yet it is here that Christopher Hemmeter expects to extract his next million -- mustering all his country-boy charms to convince the 336 year-round residents that his dreams of glittery casinos are their dreams, too.
"I'm not an interloper," he says.


Lisa Litt Engaged to Michael Knopf
Dr. and Mrs.
Irwin Litt of Princeton, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Lisa Caren Litt to Michael Stuart Knopf, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Harold Knopf of Stamford, Conn.
A June wedding is planned.
Ms.
Litt, 27 years old, is a magna cum laude graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and is a graduate student in psychology at Adelphi University.
Her father is a radiologist in New Brunswick, N.J.
Her mother is a special-education teacher in Princeton.


'Separation,' a Tale Of Trans-Atlantic Calls
"SEPARATION," a series of nine trans-Atlantic conversations, offset by two brief encounters, between a disabled American actress and an agoraphobic English playwright could exert a certain fascination for the concerned eavesdropper.
Tom Kempinski's play, which is having its American stage premiere at the George Street Playhouse, is otherwise a faltering two-character exercise, reminiscent of "Duet for One," the playwright's 1981 Broadway failure about a paralyzed cellist and her psychiatrist.


Headliners; Exoneration
When Greece's voters threw Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his Socialists out of power in 1989, the coalition of Conservatives and Communists who succeeded them quickly had Parliament prosecute the old leadership on corruption charges, focusing on accusations that they had plotted to skim millions of dollars in interest on state funds deposited in the troubled Bank of Crete.
Mr.
Papandreou called it a political vendetta, refused to testify in court, and boycotted his trial.
Last week, a 13-judge tribunal acquitted him of four charges that together could have put him into prison for life.
But two former Cabinet ministers were found guilty of related charges, and on the most serious count against Mr.
Papandreou the vote for acquittal was only 7-6, with the dissenting judges saying he must have known of the illegal activities.
Mr.
Papandreou also still faces further prosecution, on wiretapping charges, but a date for a trial has not been set.

Keeping the Burning Fireplace Smokeless
FIXING a smoky fireplace is usually not too difficult.
Arrangement of the logs and how they are tended are often responsible.
Always arrange the logs on andirons or on a raised grate set as far back into the fireplace as possible.
Raising the logs lets air to enter from underneath, enhancing combustion.
Raising the logs also raises the height of the flames, so that smoke is less likely to waft forward before being channeled upward by the fireplace's overhanging upper edge, the chimney breast.

Laurie Cunningham Plans to Marry
Mr. and Mrs.
James Cunningham of Suffern, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Laurie Elizabeth Cunningham, to Russell Joseph Wilson, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Lee Wilson of Suffern.
An August wedding is planned.
Miss Cunningham, 20 years old, is a physical therapy major at Boston University.
Her father is a vice president of the Lehigh Fluid Power Corporation, a maker of industrial machinery in Lambertville, N.J.
Her mother, Anne Cunningham, is a special-education teaching assistant at the Viola School in Suffern.

An Eye for Danger
Long Island Sound is glassy this morning, the breeze a steady whisper, and Bruce Kirby's two-masted, 26-foot coastal cruiser is cutting the waters just off Rowayton, Conn.
Kirby, who helped design Canadian challengers for the America's Cup, is out on the Sound for no other reason than simple pleasure on a pretty fall day.
On board with him is the novelist Robert Stone.
Stone, who lives in nearby Westport, has just completed a new book, "Outerbridge Reach," which takes as its central plot a solo sailor's attempt to circumnavigate the globe, and Kirby was an early reader of the manuscript, an adviser on technical matters.
Fittingly then, the two men are trading sea stories.


N.Y. Court Finds Agency Liable
The New York State Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court finding that a travel agent has an obligation to report to a client any information that might adversely affect the client's travel plans.
The ruling grows out of a case in which Zenith Travel, of New York City, is being sued for purportedly failing to inform two clients, Samuel and Renee Marcus, of reports that a tour operator was having financial difficulties.
Mr. and Mrs.
Marcus, who bought a tour to China through Zenith, say they were stranded in Japan after the tour operator, Hemphill Harris, ceased operations in October 1989.
The Marcuses' attorney, Thomas A. Dickerson, said the agency's personnel had read in the travel trade press that Hemphill Harris was having financial problems but did not pass on the information.
The case, in which Mr.
Marcus is suing for $50,000, is likely to go to trial soon.
Zenith denies negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.


In a Courthouse, Co-ops on the Block
ON most Fridays, usually around noon, a small knot of people gathers around a scuffed, steel-gray office table in the rotunda of the New York State Supreme Court Building on Foley Square for what has become a fast-booming sideshow to the region's depressed real estate market: co-op foreclosure auctions.
The auctions should not be confused with foreclosures on troubled co-op sponsors, those developers who have converted apartment buildings into co-ops and are now, because of the weakness of the market, drowning in debt.

USAir Discovers There Is Life After a Messy Merger
Since taking over USAir last year, Seth E. Schofield has won high marks for making the best of a bad hand.
But it is still far from clear that the troubled carrier, the country's fourth-largest airline, will wind up a winner.
When Mr.
Schofield was promoted to chief executive, replacing Edwin I. Colodny, USAir was hemorrhaging.
A pair of ambitious mergers in the late 80's, with Pacific Southwest Airlines and Piedmont Aviation, produced a raft of problems.
The carrier had also been battered, along with the rest of the industry, by the effects of the recession and the Persian Gulf war.


Romeo and Juliet, Divorced From Romance
Paris in the Springtime is not Paris in the winter, when a patch of blue in a gray sky is at a premium.
Even Angelin Preljocaj's "Romeo and Juliet," in the intriguing version of the Prokofiev score that I saw recently at the Theatre de la Ville, was unusually grim.
When the familiar music from the balcony scene begins in this production for the Lyons Opera Ballet, the balcony turns out to be a catwalk near a watchtower, patrolled by a guard with a flashlight and, later, a German shepherd.


Education Adviser Defends Duke, Raising Concern
An appointee to a national education panel has written newspaper columns supporting the message of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and a Republican Presidential candidate, but Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has no plans to remove him, a Government spokeswoman said today.

Duke's message last November in two columns for the paper.
Mr.
Alexander appointed Mr.
Hirschfeld to the National Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility in October.

Making a Difference; The Tantalus of Trade Talks
Like the condemned Tantalus of Greek mythology, forever reaching up to pluck fruit from a branch that recedes from his grasp, the United States negotiator seeking a global trade pact in Geneva has been thwarted repeatedly by a tangle of seemingly insolvable agricultural problems.
Rufus H. Yerxa, the deputy United States trade representative and ambassador to the talks in Geneva, began reaching again for an agreement last Monday as negotiators from the 108-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade met to start reviewing a nearly comprehensive draft text.
But the European Community, followed by Japan and Mexico, objected that the proposal went too far in curbing government assistance to farmers.


Chess
English grandmasters are currently among the strongest in the world.
The English team, having won two silver medals and one bronze in the last three Chess Olympiads, ranks second only to what used to be the Soviet team.
Still, the English championship, held Dec. 10-19 and sponsored by Duncan Lawrie, was technically the first.
Previously, there was the British championship, but it included the Scots and Welsh, who have their own Olympiad teams.
As a model for this event, the English organizers copied the two-game knockout system used in the last two United States championships.
The final was a four-game match.
The winner was Nigel Short, the top-ranking player in the world outside the former Soviet Union.
He defeated, in succession, Grandmasters Murray Chandler (formerly of New Zealand), Julian Hodgson and Michael Adams.
In the final, Short broke even at 2-2 but then won both of the two 15-minutes-per-player tiebreak games to defeat Adams.
Here is the second game of the series.

Her smile, her even tone in conversing, her gestures all suggest a woman in control of her life.


World Markets; A Cross-Atlantic Rate Play
This is an unusual time for the United States bond market.
Short-term interest rates are near 20-year lows, while rates abroad are much higher.
That's an environment in which nimble risk takers might make a profit on the spread.
But it's also an environment that many corporte treasurers, who want to preserve capital while putting idle money to work, are not used to.
Given these circumstances, Robert N. Gordon, president of the Twenty-First Securities Corporation in New York, is seeking an opportunity for his American corporate customers with millions of dollars in cash on hand.
Paribas Asset Management, the investment subsidary of the French bank, is looking for entree to more American customers.
And both want to act quickly because the interest rate opportunity they see is not going to last long.

The New Shapes Of Sounds to Come
Now that 1991 is all over (except for the hangover of last year's releases on the charts), it's time to look ahead.
In popular music, that means seeking out the undercurrents and subcultures that will sooner or later shake up the Top 10.
Behind the blockbusters and upstarts of 1991 were hints of new pop paradigms.
Where the 1980's offered the ascendancy of the image, and last-ditch battles over authenticity and misappropriation, the 1990's -- well, maybe we'll figure it out before the century ends.
For the moment, let's note some subtle stirrings:  Bye-Bye Boomers
Well into the 1980's, pop and rock were framed by the expectations of the baby-boom generation.
Guitar-slinging songwriters became the icons of rock authenticity and boomers with careers in radio, the recording business and, for that matter, rock criticism, continued as gatekeepers and tastemakers.


Wall Street; What's Behind the Sagging Utilities Prices?
The basic Wall Street catechism holds that utility stocks go up when interest rates seem to be heading down.
But while the broader stock market has soared on a firm belief in low rates, the utility stocks have staggered downward in recent weeks -- traditionally a signal that investors fear rates are heading back up.
Indeed, long-term rates
have
jerked up a bit since mid-December, as the plummeting Dow Jones utility index would suggest.
But there may be more to the move than that, said Kathleen Lally, a utility analyst with the County NatWest Securities Corporation.
"Electric utilities got very overvalued in late 1991 as portfolio managers shifted funds into electrics to hedge their market gains," she said.
When the Federal Reserve made its latest discount-rate cut, she added, "that money came out of utilities, and now the stocks have gone to extremes on the other side."


2d Terminal Set For Narita
A second passenger terminal building to accommodate 10 million passengers a year is scheduled to open next December at Narita Airport, outside Tokyo, Japan's largest international gateway.
The additional terminal is expected to ease congestion, Japanese tourist officials say, but will still not be large enough to deal with anticipated traffic.
Narita, which handled 19.5 million passengers in 1989, is ranked seventh worldwide in annual passengers by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

What Hollywood Got for Christmas
It was the moment of truth in Hollywood.
Nervous in the best of times, film makers and producers watched as more than two dozen movies sailed into theaters like giant ships (a handful of them Titanics) during the Thanksgiving-Christmas-New Year season, when moviegoing across the nation reaches a peak.
Virtually all studios acknowledge that, in the face of recession and in the shadow of big-name, big-budget flops like "Hudson Hawk" and "Billy Bathgate," marketing conferences before the holidays were unusually intense, involving secretive debates over strategy and timing that probably resembled the Allied planning for D-Day.
Not only were the multimillion-dollar investments in the films at risk; so, too, was the money committed for marketing -- $15 million for the average film and perhaps as much as $25 million for a movie like Steven Spielberg's "Hook."

Review/Music; 3 Premieres, and Debut Of a 29-Year-Old Work
In 1989, Michel Roux, a liquor importer, sponsored the first Absolut Concerto, a program of commissioned works named after the Swedish vodka his firm imports.
A second concert was offered last year, and on Wednesday evening, Mr.
Roux's company, Carillon Importers Ltd., presented the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Hugh Wolff, in a third installment at Avery Fisher Hall.
This year's program included three newly commissioned works and the New York premiere of a 29-year old piece by David Diamond.
The most ambitious of the new works was Aaron Jay Kernis's Symphony No. 2.
Mr.
Kernis, who is 32 years old, has had several works performed in New York City in recent years.
His style is eclectic, with Romantic leanings, and much of his music has a magic and originality that has made him a composer to watch.

Headliners; I.R.A. Man Loses
The protesters met at Joe Doherty Corner in lower Manhattan -- a measure of how unusual the case has become, since Joe Doherty is a convicted murderer who has been jailed in the United States for eight years while Britain seeks his extradition.
Mayor David N. Dinkins allowed the corner of Pearl and Park Streets to be named after the former Irish Republican Army guerrilla in 1990 because he became a symbol of opposition to British rule of Northern Ireland while in the Federal prison at that corner.
But the protesters had gathered to raise what may be one of their last outcries: Mr.
Doherty had reached the end of the road in his efforts to keep from being deported.
The United States Supreme Court ruled 5 to 3 last week that he was not entitled to a new hearing.
Mr.
Doherty escaped from a British prison while on trial in the killing of a British soldier in Belfast in 1980.
He was captured in 1983 tending bar at Clancy's on Third Avenue in Manhattan.


Sunday Dinner; All Yours for the Savoring: 3 Tastes of the Middle East
One of the best bets for budget dining in New York City is Middle Eastern restaurants.
The savory roasts, cumin-scented casseroles and vegetarian fritters can be had in a full-course dinner for as little as $20.
Here are three good choices.
Istanbul Kebap
303 East 80th Street (212) 517-6880 -- This compact family-run Turkish spot is a clean and well-organized place, with carnations adorning the paper-draped tables, Turkish rugs on the walls, copper lanterns and hanging plants.
Lamb is the foundation of Anatolian cooking: dishes include adana kebab, minced lamb seasoned with peppers and grilled on skewers; sis kebab, cubed marinated leg of lamb grilled on skewers; etli bamya, okra, lamb, tomato and onions, and yogurtlu kebab, a hearty casserole of pita triangles, chopped lamb, onions, yogurt, paprika and tomato.
For appetizers there are under coban, a mixed chopped salad combining tomatoes, onions and kirby (similar to cucumber); cubes of sauteed liver served with chopped onions; and stuffed grape leaves.
Appetizers range from $3.25 to $3.50; main courses $8.95 to $11.50.
Sunday service is from noon to midnight. (Diner's Journal, Nov. 3, 1989).
The Magic Carpet
54 Carmine Street (212) 627-9019 -- This is one of those inconspicuous Middle Eastern restaurants in Greenwich Village that rarely get attention outside their immediate neighborhood.
But Magic Carpet certainly gets plenty there.
And for good reason.
The food is tasty, inexpensive and copious.
The staff is cheerful and accommodating.
Excellent hummus, falafel or baba gannouj are a fine way to begin.
Among entrees are ouzi, which is puffed phyllo nearly the size of a rugby ball holding an aromatic assembly of rice, peas, raisins, almonds, chickpeas and cashews.
Of course, couscous is served, vegetable, chicken, lamb or beef.
Appetizers range from $3.95 to $4.25; main courses are $8.25 to $10.50.
Sunday hours are from 2 P.M. to 11 P.M. (Diner's Journal, May 17, 1991).
Sido Abu Salim
81 Lexington Avenue at 26th Street, 212-686-2031 -- Middle Eastern food has great appeal with its cooling vegetable purees, lemony salads and aromatic grilled meats.
This little spot, run by a Palestinian family, has always been one of the more reliable spots in town for this kind of cooking, and a real bargain.
The setting is spare and clean, with tile floors, wood wainscoting, white walls with botanical prints, and glass-topped tables.
You might start with a sampling of sprightly tabbouleh combining minced parsley, wheat germ, onions and tomato; excellent hummus, chickpea and sesame oil puree; the sesame spread tahini, and a wonderfully smoky rendition of baba gannouj, the roasted eggplant puree.
A mean-looking hot sauce set out on the table can send you screeching out the door in search of an open fire hydrant.
Other dishes include cumin-scented falafel, made with chickpea flour, ground lamb-and-onion-filled croquettes called kibbee; chicken, beef or vegetable couscous; and lamb or beef kebab.
Appetizers range from $1.60 to $2.95; main courses $8 to$14.
Sunday hours are 1 P.M. to 11 P.M. (Diner's Journal, May 20, 1991).
This listing is compiled by Bryan Miller from his restaurant visits, his reviews and articles in The Times, and entries in his Diner's Journal column.

The Region; Learning to Be Vicious Can Begin at Home
AFTER 10 days of almost daily reports of racially motivated attacks on children throughout the city by other young people, Mayor David N. Dinkins had nearly exhausted his supply of adjectives to describe the disgust and anger he felt.
Finally on Wednesday, on the occasion of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, the Mayor asked an audience at the Waldorf-Astoria, "Who taught our children to hate so thoroughly and so mercilessly?"


When Auto Renting Companies Prefer Not to
BACK in the days of "Let Hertz put you in the driver's seat," the "you" who floated into the convertible was usually a man in business clothes, necktie flying.
But a lot has happened since that ad campaign ended 31 years ago.
These days all kinds of people rent, but the car rental companies say democracy has not necessarily been a boon for business.
Hertz, the market leader in this country as well as the world, recently started applying big surcharges to rentals by residents of Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Manhattan.
For Bronx residents the charge is $56 a day, added to an average rental cost of $53 a day.

Greene Out of Running
Count MEAN JOE GREENE out of the running to succeed CHUCK NOLL as coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
The former tackle, who has been the team's defensive line coach and who was one of four finalists for the job, was told on Friday by the team president, DAN ROONEY, that he had been eliminated from the competition.
That leaves DAVE WANNSTEDT, the defensive coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys, and BILL COWHER, the defensive coordinator of the Kansas City Chiefs, as the front runners, with KEVIN GILBRIDE, the offensive coordinator of the Houston Oilers, as the third finalist.
Greene had no comment after his meeting with Rooney.
He was the only one of the four finalists who had not worked as a coordinator.


Connecticut Killer Seized Outside a New Jersey Mall
The strange prison-escape saga of the stockbroker murderer who frightened Connecticut and New York residents and set off a massive manhunt ended this afternoon in New Jersey, when the police captured the escaped convict, Frank Vandever, at a mall in Paramus.
After searching for him in Rockland County just north of the New Jersey border, Mr.
Vandever, a transvestite who was convicted of murdering a client, was arrested as he walked toward a car that was stolen this morning from the very motel here where he had slipped away from F.B.I. agents two days earlier.

A Worthy War
The historical revisionists are already at work.
Last year's triumph in the war against Iraq, they claim, has turned to ashes.
We won the war only to lose the peace.
But the naysayers who make this argument too cavalierly dismiss the strategic and diplomatic benefits produced by Operation Desert Storm.
To be sure, the fact that Saddam Hussein remains in power is deeply disturbing.
But this hardly constitutes an argument against the war, particularly since he would still be comfortably ensconced in Iraq and Kuwait if we had not moved against him.


Bach Cello Suites

What Is Human About Furs?
Listening to animal-rights activists is less important than listening to one's conscience.
If one has no qualms about buying a coat made from beavers caught in underwater traps who took 20 minutes to drown or from ranch-raised minks who were anally electrocuted, the arguments of animal rights advocates probably won't make any difference.
However, if one feels the slightest bit uneasy about paying someone to take another's life just to make a fashion statement, then an ear to one's conscience must supersede both an animal defender's debate and the pretty recitations of struggling furriers.

Biotechnology Companies Find a Home In the State
THE biotechnology industry has found New Jersey.
From bags of bugs to designer drugs, from cloned chrysanthemums to a substitute for human blood, an increasing number of New Jersey companies are creating and developing innovative products, using the sophisticated technology born of the biotechnology revolution.
State officials and industry experts say that after a somewhat slow start, New Jersey is now emerging as a major site for biotechnology businesses -- a multibillion-dollar industry that holds out the promise of solving some of mankind's most pressing environmental and medical problems.
In addition, they say, the state's enhanced presence in the biotechnology market will aid the state's economy by creating new industry and jobs.
"We feel that New Jersey is becoming a leader in the biotech industry," said Brooke Hern, a spokesman for the State Department of Commerce and Economic Development.
Mr.
Hern said an informal survey of listings of biotechnology companies nationwide by the department had shown New Jersey to have 193 biotechnology companies -- second only to California with 365, and just ahead of Massachusetts with 183.


Texas Governor Proves Adept in Her First Year
The day after Ann W. Richards was elected Governor of Texas in November 1990, she described politics in Texas as "a contact sport" and "not for the weak or the lily-livered."
While no one would accuse her of being docile in her year in office, Governor Richards has behaved more like a chess player than a linebacker.

Small, Lighthearted Works
THE 46 small works making up the "Annual Metro Show" at City Without Walls here are
small

A few images measure as little as 2 inches by 3 inches, and none exceed 12 inches in any dimension.
As a result, the show, the 10th of its kind, studs the gallery rather than fills it.
This year's jurors were two critics, Gary Azon and Patty Harris, together with one dealer, Penny Pilkington, and what they have culled from 366 entries is on the whole lighthearted and good.


Tenore Reorganizes County Board
A FRESHLY minted Board of Legislators began work last week under a new chairman, with an agenda and revamped committee system that some members predicted would be more responsive to an increasingly impatient electorate.
There also seemed to be a new interest in focusing on the county's urban problems.
The chairman, Stephen P. Tenore, a Republican, moved quickly to soothe at least some of the political injuries suffered by the Democrats, who felt they had been robbed of a majority gained at the polls through the defection of one member, Suzanne R. Swanson, a Conservative elected as a Democrat.

Algerians, Angry With the Past, Divide Over Their Future
THERE was considerable relief in the salons of the middle classes last weekend when the Algerian Army, hiding behind a civilian administration, put an end to a democratic process that was leading militant Islamic fundamentalists straight to power here.
But the battle for Algeria is not over and this country may yet become the Middle East's third Islamic republic, joining Iran and the Sudan.
Having won big in the first free elections in the Arab world last month, Algeria's Muslim fundamentalists have kept to the high moral ground, eschewing violence for the moment as the old guard flails about in desperation, trying to justify reneging on its promise to abide by the verdict of the ballot box.
It was the Army and Government officials, after all -- not the fundamentalists -- who a week ago forced President Chadli Benjedid out of power and cut short the democratic process Mr.
Benjedid launched in 1988.


Making a Difference; Moving Up at Citicorp
When Pei-yuan Chia came to Citicorp in 1974, the consumer banking business was widely regarded as a resting place for second-rate bankers whose primary job was to raise deposits so that the first-rate bankers could make loans to corporations.
Things are different now.
The corporate lending side of the bank has been hurt in recent years by intense competition and heavy loan losses.
Meanwhile, the consumer bank, where Mr.
Chia has spent all of his time at Citicorp, has emerged as the most profitable and rapidly growing part of the company.
And within the consumer bank, Citicorp's operations in three dozen foreign countries, headed by Mr.
Chia the last four years, have emerged as stellar performers, with profits rising 25 percent annually to more than $300 million last year.


Results Plus; Heinzer Repeats Franz Heinzer of Switzerland won his second downhill in two days yesterday at Kitzbuhel, Austria, establishing himself as king of the most fearsome hill on the World Cup circuit. The defending downhill champion raced down the twisting, 3,200-meter-long Streif course in a record 1 minute 56.04 seconds, bettering his time on the same track Friday by 64 one-hundredths of a second. A. J. Kitt of Rochester was second in 1:56.39. Patrick Ortlieb of Austria delighted the partisan crowd of 30,000 by finishing third in 1:56.63. Heinzer's victory solidified his grip atop the overall downhill World Cup standing. He has 411 points, followed by Kitt with 297 and Ortlieb with 272. (AP)

Brain Drain Continues And 49ers Feel Pain
With Bill Walsh, a former 49ers head coach, just a few miles to the south as the new coach at Stanford; Mike Holmgren, the former 49ers offensive coordinator, now head coach at Green Bay, and Sam Wyche, a former 49ers assistant, the new head coach at Tampa Bay -- and all of them on the prowl for assistant coaches -- San Francisco could be in for a big brain drain.
"It's a compliment to the 49ers organization and a testament to Coach Bill Walsh and George Seifert that we have several former assistants who have moved on to become head coaches or who are attractive to other teams," said Carmen A. Policy, president of the 49ers.
"But it does make it more difficult for us. Two key members of our staff have been offered positions with Mike Holmgren. It doesn't allow us to settle down after the season and begin the work of preparing for the next season."

Hospitals Selection: Different Lessons
As "Meeting the New Head of County Hospitals" (Dec. 29) made clear, the County Medical Center's recent history taught different lessons to different players.
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Board of Legislators, Mack L. Carter Jr., Carol Farkas (then chairwoman of the Hospital Advisory Board) and the physicians represented by Dr.
George E. Reed have offered diverse and interesting interpretations of what occurred before the proceedings to confirm Mr.
Carter as Commissioner of Hospitals.
The disparities are so great as to suggest that either the players live in different worlds from each other or that none of their statements can be believed without reservation.


P. D. Q. Bach: The Big Joke May Be on Us
Invitations to laughter in music should be accepted graciously and without second thoughts.
But lately it has been getting harder to tell jokes from jeremiads; parody has begun to seem like the real thing.
So one often doesn't know whether to laugh or -- write a column.
An innocent pioneer of contemporary musical humor isPeter Schickele, who recently performed P. D. Q. Bach's "Fantasieshtick" for piano and orchestra at Carnegie Hall.
In this composition from the "Sturm und Dreck" period of the late but unmourned composer, there was Olympic virtuosity (a somersault landing Mr. Schickele at the keyboard was instantly followed by numerical ratings from the orchestra); there was an improvised cadenza (taking off from "Heart and Soul"); there was even a part for continuo (rap rhythms piped through a speaker).


Far From Verdi And Puccini
To the Editor:
After 12 years of torrential blather and hoopla over "The Ghosts of Versailles," most critics were weighted in its favor because it was a good cause: a native American opera at the Met!
But it was stillborn from the start.
To begin with, the subject matter is hardly timely or consequential.
There is no spontaneous outburst that compels one to sing -- it's all sterile, manufactured, ground out like so much sausage.
Skill, but no operatic feel; craft, but no inspiration.

Those who operate a home-based business or profession, for instance, will have to disclose far more when calculating allowable office expenses on a new form being tied to Schedule C.

Saudi Arabia is pressing the Bush Administration to organize a large covert action campaign in Iraq aimed at dividing Iraq's army and toppling Saddam Hussein, United States and allied officials say.

The aim is to draw out and divide Mr.
Hussein's last Republican Guard divisions protecting his strongholds around Baghdad and subject them to allied air assaults.

The Man Who Dreamed of Faeryland
How fine it would be if one were able to wander the Irish countryside accompanied by an erudite friend capable of spouting precisely appropriate lines by William Butler Yeats at the proper moments.
In Sligo, in the shadows of Ben Bulben, or in Galway, at Coole Park, the words of the man who dreamed of Faeryland still echo.

YEATS: Images of Ireland (Macmillan, $35) captures well the Ireland that Yeats knew and loved and wrote about, "where all outward things were the image of an inward life." Alain Le Garsmeur's reserved yet knowing photographs, in both color and black and white, are untainted by any nostalgic glow.
They are accompanied by the scholar Bernard McCabe's useful and informative chronology and introductory essay, and paired with exceedingly well-chosen extracts from Yeats's poetry, memoirs, essays and plays.
The photographs illuminate the text, while the text adds depth and meaning to the pictures.
This elegant volume makes accessible the subtle passions and simplicities of the mental and physical Irish landscapes.

Salvador Warily Prepares for War's Aftermath
AS though the civil war in El Salvador were dying a human death, faces from the whole course of the conflict seemed to flash before Government and rebel leaders as they made their ceremonious peace here last week.
A Catholic Church human rights advocate sat at the treaty signing not far from a conservative businessman whose family was reputed to have financed paramilitary death squads.
A few feet away, a retired Army colonel who has become one of the country's more garrulous right-wing politicians could look over at one of the guerrilla commanders whom he had once fought.
Across the ideological spectrum, no one save a few bewildered young guerrillas and a few more military officers acted as though there might have been anything they had lost.
Dr.
Charles Clements, an American physician who spent a year tending to rebel wounded on a strategic Salvadoran volcano, had a pleasant chat with one Salvadoran Army general; Jennifer Jean Casolo, an American religious worker who was once jailed by the Salvadoran security forces on charges of stockpiling weapons for the guerrillas, shook hands with another.
The United States Ambassador to El Salvador, William G. Walker, wrapped an arm around Joaquin Villalobos, the guerrilla commander whom American officials had most despised, and talked about having lunch back in San Salvador one day soon.

The area, once a lively entertainment and shopping center, has been declining for years, with more and more vacant storefronts.

It was a shot from the blue, like a patient with a chronic heart condition who suddenly falls and breaks a leg.

Mutual Funds; What the Readers Are Asking
Here are answers to some recent questions from readers of this column.
Question: Not long ago you wrote about funds that invest in the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average.
The funds mentioned are all sold with sales charges.
I have received a mail solicitation for an investment newsletter that, as a bonus for subscribing, promises to tell me the name of a no-load fund that follows the same strategy.
Could you tell me which fund this is?
Answer: Sorry, no luck.
Analysts at Morningstar Inc., a mutual-funds research group in Chicago, screened 1,080 stock funds for funds holding 12 or fewer stocks.
Of the 29 that came up, "none fit the bill," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds.
The data base excludes funds less than six months old, very small funds with less than $25,000 in assets and fewer than 1,000 shareholders and funds from which Morningstar could not obtain information, a rarity.
While it is not a perfect match, Mr.
Rekenthaler suggests the T. Rowe Price Equity-Income Fund, a no-load fund that buys large high-yielding stocks, mostly in the industrial sector.
Q: I am puzzled by your recent discussion of Individual Retirement Account rollovers.
Dreyfus prepared an example showing that an account worth $245,285 would yield monthly annuity checks of $529, or a 2.59 percent "dividend" rate on the value of the account, whereas an account worth $334,348 would yield monthly annuity checks of $2,075, a 7.44 percent "dividend" rate.
Why the huge difference?
And since good stock mutual funds earn 10 percent or more annually, why not simply reinvest I.R.A. money in a fund instead of taking annuity payments?
A: Trying to calculate a "dividend" rate is a natural urge but difficult to accomplish.
The computer model used by Dreyfus includes many variables, including an inflation factor.
As a result, future I.R.A. distributions are stated in terms of today's dollars.
In the Dreyfus example, the $2,075 payment was figured for a 55-year-old worker scheduled to begin receiving payments in seven years, so inflation played a much smaller role than it did with the second worker, a 35-year-old whose payments would not begin for 25 years.
The second person's payments might be thousands of dollars a month in 2017, but worth only $529 in 1991 dollars.
As for your second question, you are correct in stating that stock funds return about 10 percent annually.
But this is true only over the long term; funds may lose money in some periods.
Retirees who rely on investment income to cover living expenses cannot afford to keep the bulk of their portfolios in stocks.
Furthermore, many stock funds do not provide regular income because their goal is capital appreciation.
Q: A recent column discussing fees omitted the commission expenses incurred when fund managers buy and sell stocks.
The higher a fund's turnover, the higher its expenses.
Why aren't commission costs, which can be significant, disclosed in a fund's prospectus?
A: Although commission costs are not disclosed in a fund's prospectus, they are covered in its Statement of Additional Information, or S.A.I.
This report was developed to let funds pare the information required in prospectuses, which were becoming unwieldy.
Starting in 1983, the Securities and Exchange Commission let funds disclose some information in S.A.I.'s.
These data include detailed investment policies and restrictions, portfolio transaction costs (including commissions) and information about trustees and management contracts.
Unlike prospectuses, S.A.I.'s are not sent routinely to investors, but they are available upon request.
One last point: Commission costs are subtracted in figuring a fund's total return.
Q: In a column about figuring a fund's return, you said the price of the Fidelity Magellan Fund was $44.29 on Dec. 31, 1985, and $53.93 on Dec. 31, 1990, and then concluded that the five-year return equaled 99 percent.
But I get 121.7 percent when I divide the beginning and ending share prices.
Please explain.
A: For starters, you calculated the rate of increase incorrectly.
To get a fund's return on principal, you should divide the difference between the beginning and ending share prices by the beginning price.
Here, the principal-only return is 21.7 percent (your result minus 100 percent, the initial investment), substantially lower than the fund's 99 percent "total return." As the chart shows, total return can be much higher than principal-only return because it includes dividends and capital distributions paid by the fund in addition to the changes in principal value.

Harbor International can be reached at (419) 247-2477; Financial Strategic Health Sciences, (800) 525-8085, and Pimit Total Return, (800) 443-6915.

Crime Visits New York's Children, And Dread Haunts Many Parents
Dominick Masullo allows his 13-year-old son to go by himself to the store, about a block from their home in the northeast Bronx -- but not without specific instructions about what to do if a stranger approaches or he senses some other danger.
"He knows how to look around and how to run," Mr.
Masullo said.
"If there's a big problem, you run into a store and call a parent. If the storekeeper tells you to leave, you hug the cash register. What's the thing the storekeeper cares most about? His money. You don't touch the money. But he's going to call the police, and they're going to come, which is what you want."


Rail Europe
To the Editor: You have carried letters twice recently (July 21 and Oct. 13) concerning problems with the new Rail Europe operations in White Plains.
My experience has found them incompetent and uncooperative.
It should have been a warning when they sent timetables expiring in September after I wrote asking about travel in October.
My wife and I did buy second-class French rail-and-drive passes from them, along with reservations for a trip shortly after our arrival in Paris.
These cost a $10 surcharge in addition to the $16 reservation fee.
Later it turned out that Rail Europe had made reservations in first class, useless with our passes.
JOHN T. YOKE Corvallis, Ore.
Dagobert M. Scher, executive vice president of Rail Europe, responds:
The material we send out is from the railroads.
Since schedules change at the end of September and we receive the new timetables from Europe in mid-November, we continue to distribute what we have until the new ones arrive so travelers may at least get an idea of the time a trip trakes.
While we regret the inconvenience on the reservations, we include a notice with every order that documents should be examined immediately.
We would gladly have rectified the error if they had notified us before they left.


Baseball Plans A Fall League
Major league baseball announced on Friday that it would form a six-team fall league to start play in Arizona later this year.

Plans call for a 54-game season to run from Oct. 5 through Dec. 6, with a playoff series at the end.


CAMPUS LIFE: Cornell; Trustee Comes To the Defense Of His Fraternity
Angry about the way disciplinary proceedings against his fraternity have been handled, John S. Dyson, a Cornell University trustee, said last week that he would take the unusual step of bringing the fraternity's case to the board of trustees at a meeting on Friday in New York City.
Mr.
Dyson, who ran for the United States Senate in New York in 1986 and has held several prominent positions in state government, graduated from Cornell in 1965 and was a member of Alpha Delta Phi.
In a telephone interview from his home in Millbrook, N.Y., Mr.
Dyson said that he was concerned that "Greek organizations are singled out as compared to other similar organizations, like the chess club and the football team or anyone else who decides to have a party with alcohol."

India Alters Fees For Visas Again
The Indian Government, under a storm of protest from its own travel industry and tour operators abroad, has revised its tourist visa fees for a second time in as many months, reducing some of them substantially.
According to the Indian Embassy in Washington, visitors will pay $5 instead of $25 for a transit visa, which is necessary for even a brief stopover in India.


The Nation; The Nation's Schools Learn A 4th R: Resegregation
THIRTY-EIGHT years after Chief Justice Earl Warren warned that the South's system of dividing schools by race gave black children "a feeling of inferiority," segregated schools are on the rise again in many parts of the country.
The notable exception is the South, where the vigilance of court-mandated desegregation was centered.
Now, according to a study sponsored by the National School Boards Association and released this month, it is in the North's urban centers and suburbs and in the West that minority youngsters find themselves increasingly in separate and unequal schools.
Indeed, a black family that moves to Georgia or Tennessee is more likely to see its child grow up in integrated schools than if it remains in Michigan or New Jersey.
New York, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and California are among the top five states in which minority youngsters are most likely to go to schools that are 50 to 100 percent minority students.

Sports of The Times; Civility Breaks Out in Hockey
THE strangest sight of the National Hockey League All-Star Game weekend was Ed Hospodar scoring a goal to win the old-timers' game Friday night.
This is a man who generally used his hands for other purposes, such as pushing in the noses and crumpling the ears of his enemies, of whom there were legions.
But that's what happens when they temporarily suspend the pugnacious ethos of hockey and allow skating and shooting to take a weekend gambol.
Even the Ed Hospodars of the world become goal-scoring heroes.

All About/Packaging; Learning to Wrap Products in Less -- or Nothing at All
Packaging, that ubiquitous staple of modern life, is big business, adding as much as $70 billion a year to the nation's economy.
It protects goods from being tampered with and from being battered during the journey from factory to store.
It preserves food and helps sell the products within.
It also represents a new way for financially strapped local governments, which bear the cost of disposing of garbage, to cut their costs.
A variety of state legislative initiatives would force manufacturers to be accountable for a package after it was sold and thereby cut down on what is the fastest-growing component of the garbage crisis, accounting for more than 30 percent of the nation's municipal solid waste.


Beauty: Fitness; Revival of the Fittest
Day 1: Liberation!
I've finally broken off my relationship with the Stairmaster and landed in paradise.
Goodbye to stuffy gyms and chlorinated pools.
It's time to test myself against nature instead of the Nautilus. (Looks like the gods have built the ultimate spa right here on the island of Kauai.) Talk about connecting with nature: Today I climbed a tree!
Later showered under a waterfall -- the water pressure beats the trickle in my 10th-floor apartment back home.
Day 2: Postcard from the edge (of a volcano).
Explored the crater on Mount Waialeale.
Expected to see something like a giant lava lamp, but the bottom of the caldera is a primeval swamp!
With 450 inches of rain a year, the fires went out a long time ago.

'On the Altar of Freedom'
To the Editor:
In the Dec. 22 Letters column, two readers took me to task for writing that "On the Altar of Freedom," a collection of Civil War letters by Cpl.
James Henry Gooding, was "the only sustained contemporaneous account of life in a black regiment I've ever seen." In the overall context of the review, I meant Gooding's was the only account of regimental life
by a black soldier
of which I was aware.
There may well be another such volume, but neither of the books your correspondents suggest fills that bill.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson's "Army Life in a Black Regiment" is a classic of Civil War literature, but its author was a white officer, not a black soldier, while the author of "Thomas Morris Chester, Black Civil War Correspondent" was a civilian.

Topics of The Times; Frankly, It's an Abuse
Challenging an incumbent in 1990, freshman Representative Wayne Gilchrest, Republican of Maryland, assailed widespread abuse of the Congressional free mailing privilege, known as franking.
This year, he is among the abusers.
Mr.
Gilchrest, running for re-election in a district reshaped by reapportionment, is one of many House members who are blanketing areas picked up in redistricting with taxpayer-financed mail.
Members who send unsolicited mass mailings outside their present districts are not breaking the law.
But by exploiting every last advantage of incumbency, they are cheating democracy.
Fortunately, a bill before the House gives members a chance to remedy the abuse when they return to work this week.

Feasting on Focaccia, Crisp and Unadorned
TWENTY-SOME years of searching for anything approximating the flour tortillas I grew up eating in a Mexican neighborhood in Arizona should have taught me how rarely good breads travel.
But I was still surprised to find that the focaccia baked everywhere in northern Italy was not even a distant cousin of the stuff turning up on the trendiest tables around New York these days.
Just as commercial tortillas are inevitably dry and brittle and lacking in the lard my old neighbors loved, emigrant focaccia is too often airy and oily and overdressed with peppers and olives compared with the real thing.
For 10 days in and around the northwestern province of Liguria last spring I ate the traditional flat bread every chance I got, from a truck stop to fancy restaurants, before realizing just what made it so much better than any I had had back home: Like tortillas, great focaccia is baked fresh every day.
It was never intended to have the shelf life of a Twinkie.


3 Officers Injured in Scuffle With Robbery Suspect
A Brooklyn man shot at an off-duty New York City police officer during an apparent robbery attempt yesterday and then scuffled with officers while being held at a precinct station house.
The off-duty officer and two other officers were slightly injured in the station house fracas.
The suspect, Michael Robinson, 24 years old, of 1002 Hancock Street in Bushwick, was charged with one count of attempted murder, one count of reckless endangerment, one count of criminal possession of a weapon, and three counts of assault.


A Worthy War
The historical revisionists are already at work.
Last year's triumph in the war against Iraq, they claim, has turned to ashes.
We won the war only to lose the peace.
But the naysayers who make this argument too cavalierly dismiss the strategic and diplomatic benefits produced by Operation Desert Storm.
To be sure, the fact that Saddam Hussein remains in power is deeply disturbing.
But this hardly constitutes an argument against the war, particularly since he would still be comfortably ensconced in Iraq and Kuwait if we had not moved against him.

Nevertheless, there still are hundreds of "scalped" buildings left in the older parts of New York City -- a painful display of architectural mutilation.

How to End the Abortion War
THE VEINS IN HIS forehead bulged so prominently they might have been blue worms that had worked their way under the surface of his skin.
His eyes bulged, too, capillaries zigzagging from the pupils in all directions.
His face was pulled tight about the jaw, which thrust forward like a snowplow attachment on the grille of a truck.
From the flattened O of his mouth, the word "murderer" erupted in a regular rhythm, the repetition of the r's giving the word the sound of an outboard motor that failed to catch.
She, for her part, paced up and down directly in front of him, saying nothing.
Instead, she held high a large cardboard sign on a stick, showing the cartoonish drawing of a bloody coat hanger over the caption, "Never again." Like his, her face was taut with fury, her lips pressed together so tightly they folded under and vanished.
Whenever she drew close to him, she would deliberately lower the sign and turn it toward him, so that he would be yelling his "murderer" at the picture of the coat hanger.

Frankly, I could do with a little less of Bonnie Blue Butler, Scarlett and Rhett's whiny child.
But I don't have an unusually short attention span.
So when I started re-editing movies in my head this holiday season -- cutting out an extra scene here, snipping at a long speech there, wondering why Tom Berenger seemed to say everything three times during the three hours of "At Play in the Fields of the Lord" -- it didn't come from some frustrated urge to be a film editor or a barber or to be watching MTV.
Right now there are a dozen major movies that run more than two hours each, and most feel like it.

Gioconda Crivelli does not care much for what she terms "big rocks," and that bias shows in the jewelry she designs.

Another favorite piece is a gold elephant pin with blue enameled ears and emerald eyes, a tribute to her great-uncle, President William Howard Taft.

Acts of Kindness And Generosity
The article "Charities Say Tough Times Soften Hearts of Donors" (Dec. 15) describes a previous non-contributor who made a $1,000 donation to the Salvation Army.
The gentleman's charity was motivated because, on the checkout line in a supermarket, he had just witnessed a woman returning her Christmas turkey to the freezer; she said she did not have enough money to pay for all of her groceries.
I applaud this gentleman for his act of kindness and generosity, but there is one question I wish I could ask of him: why didn't you give money directly to the woman, so she could have the turkey?
Too many of us use anonymity as a vehicle for our kindness and contributions when personal contact and direct involvement, in appropriate circumstances, may have a more lasting result.
Whether this is through volunteer work at a hospital, school or homeless shelter, or just helping one family that needs the support of another member of the community, each of us, individually, is able to make a contribution to make this world better for everyone.
We need only choose to do so.

Review/Film; Irish Tenor Is Focus Of Intrigue and Blarney
The luck of the Irish is readily apparent in "Hear My Song," both in front of the camera and behind the scenes.
This winning first feature by the Irish writer and director Peter Chelsom has the kind of blithe, fanciful magic that can't be achieved through skill alone.
Adrian Dunbar, Mr.
Chelsom's co-screenwriter, stars in "Hear My Song" as the charming rascal Micky O'Neill, who is just barely running a nightclub in an unnamed English city.
The place is on the brink of bankruptcy, and Micky's efforts to sweet-talk his landlords aren't coming to much.
"There are those who find a kind of giving in their taking; that's me," he says hopefully, causing the kindly looking old ladies who own the place to curse him.
Desperate measures are called for, but in this film's scheme of things, desperation and enchantment go hand in hand.

THE Democratic candidates for President, anxious to woo back the disaffected middle class, have all but abandoned their traditional role as champions of the disenfranchised.
It is almost an oversight, this eerie silence on the campaign trail about issues that affect the poor.
But it is a telling omission for the party that had traditionally spoken for the disadvantaged, especially during a battle over whether states should cut entitlement programs to balance strained budgets.

Shade Tree Commissions Now Have Teeth Like Chainsaws
BY just about everybody's account, the 150-year-old birch that once stood in a quiet neighborhood of Summit, N.J., had the girth, the height and the expanse of limbs to be justifiably called stately.
"It was one of the oldest trees in Summit," said Alfred Mickens, foreman of the city's parks and trees unit.
"It was really rare and one of the most important species."

Tech Notes; Dish With a Difference
Is that a dish or a daisy?
A radio antenna designed at the Georgia Institute of Technology has characteristics of both.
The satellite dish's edges are serrated to look like flower petals.
Radar, telecommunications and satellite dishes operate best when sidelobe radiation -- energy scattered from the edge of the dishes -- is diminished.
This reduces the chance that signals will be sent in undesired directions or interfere with one another.
In recent years, scientists have attempted to reduce sidelobe radiation by placing absorbing materials on the edges of dishes.

Making a Difference; Hertz to New York: Pay More
When he founded the first rent-a-car company in 1927, John Hertz thought he could control the business from top to bottom by building the cars himself, and came up with a model called the "Drive-Ur-Self," complete with running boards and a windshield that opened for ventilation.
But he eventually decided that buying the standard models built by other manufacturers was more practical.
Now, 65 years later, the current chairman of the Hertz Corporation, Frank A. Olson, is also trying to keep control, in his case over the company's losses in New York City.
Mr.
Olson's solution -- imposing charges that would shoo away Hertz's riskiest customers -- may last longer than the Drive-Ur-Self, but it is already taking him down a rough road.


Palaces More Real Than Royal
IT wasn't very long ago that staying in a palace hotel in Rajasthan was supposed to make you feel like Hollywood's version of royalty, surrounded by luxury in a romantic desert world of maharajahs and maharanis.
Truth was, the real Rajasthani princes now tell you over a cup of tea on the porch, a lot of what passed for the royal life and Rajasthani culture was fantasy created by hotel chains and travel agents.
In the last few years, the scions of warrior Rajput families, long stripped of their titles and princely purses by democratic India, have begun a kind of palace revolution to reclaim their heritage.
They are opening many smaller family homes and spectacular hilltop forts to draw visitors into the real daily life of India's most dramatic state.
In different cases, near-ruins are being bought by urban Indians, expertly restored and filled with antiques.
Either way, palaces with worn rugs and mended chairs are still palaces, rooted in the hamlets and towns they tower above.

HONG KONG WANTS VOICE ON GOVERNOR
Legislators will vote next week on a motion calling for the colonial Government here to convey to London the views of Hong Kong people on who should be appointed the next Governor.
While the motion seems polite, reasonable and even innocuous, having Hong Kong people ask for a say in the appointment of their Governor is an audacious proposal, one never made before in the 150-year history of the British colony.

The Esthetic Pleasure of Trees in Winter
WINTER walks are wonderful to take.
Just being outdoors is a pleasure, and walking is one sure way to see the architecture of trees.
The leaves are gone, and their barks are exposed.
One of the trees that really stands out at this time of year is the sycamore.
It can be seen for quite some distance, because the glorious bark is never as clearly visible as it is now.
Without leaves the outline is truly spectacular.
The massive tree has exfoliating bark.
That is a fancy botanist's term to describe bark that flakes off in irregular patterns to reveal what is underneath.
This pattern is what makes the sycamore worth a second look.
Some may want to describe the massive trunk as having a jigsawlike pattern.
Others may say the tree's bark appears mottled.


Skipping Bail: Another View
As a social scientist who has studied bail on a national scale and the New Jersey criminal courts for the last 10 years, I was greatly surprised by the shocking findings in the article "Defendants Increasingly Skip Bail" (Dec. 22).
The conclusion that approximately half the pending cases in the state's county courts involve fugitives and an explanation that this unprecedented statistic is most likely caused by overreliance on the 10 percent bail option fly in the face of both common sense and national trends.
The article generally reads more like a propaganda piece for the bail bonding industry, which has had its business significantly reduced as a result of the 10 percent bail option alternative.


Walking Sticks
To the Editor: The lovely picture of climbers on Fox Glacier in New Zealand ("New Zealand Wilderness," Oct. 27) showed all seven followers using improper technique by holding their walking sticks on the downhill side of the slope they were traversing.
Having climbed Mount Washington in winter, I have learned that anyone putting weight on a downhill stick that happens to sink in unexpectedly is in danger of falling downhill.
Hikers using sticks or alpenstocks must take care to switch them from hand to hand in order to keep them on the uphill side.

ULSTER'S WARFARE TAKES VARIED TOLL
Down the block from Bedford Street, where 800 pounds of explosives blew a three-foot crater in the middle of the downtown area this month, a white-tie dinner and dance was held this week beneath the copper-covered dome of City Hall.
The Queen and the Princess of Romania were invited, along with the Lord Mayor of Belfast and a number of American businessmen.
Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration and now publisher of Forbes magazine, was the guest of honor.
And after a dinner of poached Irish salmon and roast beef, Eddie Haughey, a businessman who organized the affair, rose to say he had gathered them all together to "foster the good name of Northern Ireland."

Coins
For some people, coin collecting is a love, and for others it is a legacy.
Often, a coin collection cherished by the original owner is passed on to heirs who have neither the interest nor the expertise to know what to do with all those old nickels and quarters.
The first thing to do is to figure out which of three different types of collections you've inherited.
There's the true collection, one for which the collector spent hours poring through catalogues and browsing in coin shops, carefully selecting the best pieces he could afford.
Such a collection can take years to build and is usually handsomely packaged and meticulously catalogued.
It probably includes sales records for coins bought and sold and a list of each coin in the collection.


Curtain to Rise on a Revival, the John Gotti Trial
On the evening of Dec. 16, 1985, a team of gunmen shot and killed Paul Castellano, the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family, as he stepped from his black Cadillac in front of Sparks Steak House in midtown Manhattan.
In a Brooklyn courtroom on Tuesday morning, John Gotti goes on trial in a Federal racketeering case that includes charges that he murdered Mr.
Castellano to become the boss of the Gambinos, the most powerful Mafia group in the country.


Summer of '92: Simplicity Is All
The key to the summer collections that designers began unveiling on Seventh Avenue last week is simplicity.
The clothes are pared down, functional, easy.
Black, white and gray are dominant; sometimes there's a touch of red, but infrequently.
Despite this minimalist approach, or perhaps because of it, the clothes have style.
They are not the kind that make a woman fret about how the panel falls or how the bow is tied, because there aren't many panels or bows.


Detroit Goes Distance
To the Editor:
"Don't Brake for Detroit" (Op-Ed, Jan. 7) by James Bovard tells us that United States cars are "of relatively low quality." We hear this Detroit-bashing rather constantly.
Yet on the front page of the same paper  [ some editions ]  a news article mentions a woman in California who has 300,000 miles on her Jeep.
Meanwhile, in Mexico we see American autos still going 20 to 30 years later.
Poorer quality?

POSTINGS: Landlords' Forum; Face-to-Face With Policy Makers
Landlords.
Tenants see them as personifications of power.
But landlords see themselves as pawns of public officials, and many of them have been longing for an opportunity to take their problems directly to the state and city officials who make policy for rental housing.
On Tuesday they will get their chance at an all-day forum sponsored by the Rent Stabilization Association, the trade association representing residential building owners.
Among the officials expected to attend and respond to questions are Felice Michetti, Commissioner of the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development; Carol O'Cleireacain, Commissioner of the Department of Finance, and Angelo Aponte, Commissioner of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.


What the Architect Said
To the Editor:
In my review of recent books on Louis I. Kahn (Dec. 29), the omission of two "becauses" during telephonic revision spoiled one of his most revealing remarks.
It should have read: "Paestum is beautiful to me because it is less beautiful than the Parthenon . . . because from it the Parthenon came." Also, in mentioning others who worked in a curatorial capacity on the exhibition that called David B. Brownlee and David G. De Long's "Louis I. Kahn" into being, I neglected to include Sherri Geldin and Elizabeth A. T. Smith of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.

New Yugoslav Clashes Threaten to Keep U.N. Out
New clashes between Croatian and Serbian military units today signaled a possibly dangerous erosion of the most successful cease-fire to date in the seven-month Yugoslav war.
Though apparently limited to local outbursts, the upturn in fighting could lessen the prospect for a deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces.


Judith Berman Has Wedding
The Greentree Country Club in New Rochelle, N.Y., was the setting last evening for the wedding of Judith Lynn Berman, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward M. Berman of Bedford, N.Y., to Howard Jay Kaplan, a son of Louis Kaplan of St.
Cloud, Fla., and the late Rebecca Kaplan.
Rabbi Norton D. Shargel officiated.
Mrs.
Kaplan, 31 years old, graduated from American University and is the office manager for the New York law firm of Johnston &amp; McShane.
Her father is a partner in the New York law firm of Singer Netter &amp; Dowd and her mother, Barbara Berman, is a sales manager for American Telephone and Telephone in White Plains.
The bride's first marriage ended in divorce.


CAMPUS LIFE: Washington and Lee; New Fraternity Houses Bring New Rules, Too
A $13 million renovation of the fraternities at Washington and Lee University is changing not only the physical structures of the houses, but also their rules of conduct.
The university is halfway through its Fraternity Renaissance program, which began in 1990 and which requires that the 16 fraternities adopt the school's behavior codes when their houses are rebuilt.
The rules, called the Standards for Fraternities, require the houses to have adult live-in resident managers or house mothers.


Court Strikes Down New York City Garbage Rates
In a ruling that could cost New York City businesses thousands of dollars, a state appeals court last week struck down the city's decision to lower the maximum rate private garbage haulers may charge commercial customers.
The city's Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates the hauling industry, reduced the rate by 7.5 percent on Aug. 1, announcing with fanfare that the reduction would ease steep garbage collection bills.

POSTINGS: Doing Business in Budapest; Roth Returns To His Roots
In New York, it would probably not even make the papers.
But in 1994, when Budapest's Danube Financial Centre is scheduled to open for business, eyebrows are likely to rise all over town.
Emery Roth &amp; Sons, which designed the center, calls it the largest -- and smartest -- office complex contemplated in Central Europe.
Computers will control the air-conditioning, security and lighting.
It is wired for tenants' computers and microwave communications, too -- a particularly vital capability in a country where telephone service cannot always be taken for granted.

Carnival is flying to the islands on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, leaving Miami International Airport at 1:30 P.M.
The flight is to Providenciales and then on to Grand Turk.
On the return flight the plane leaves Grand Turk at 4:45 P.M., calls at Providenciales and arrives in Miami at 6:30 P.M..

Commercial Property: 1585 Broadway; Tracing the Path From Leasing Coup to Bankruptcy
EVEN before 1585 Broadway began to rise over Duffy Square, its developer, David S. Solomon, had signed a major Park Avenue law firm to a 20-year lease for 365,000 square feet.
A notable achievement at any time, the deal was a milestone in a market where a growing number of new buildings were competing heavily for a shrinking number of tenants.
The first triumph, however, was the last.


Russians Take a Flier on Oil In Capitalism for the Masses
The line to buy a piece of the action in the People's Oil Industrial Investment Euro-Asian Corporation, with its unlikely sales office in an empty hall of the Museum of the History of Moscow, is a good measure of Russians' growing panic about the vanishing value of the ruble.
"Here we are taking a risk, of course," said Nikolai Khanchenkov, a 41-year-old scientific researcher, as he stood on the museum's drafty stairwell recently.
He was waiting his turn to plunk down 1,000 rubles, roughly $10 at the current exchange rate, for a share in the brand-new company.
"On the other hand, if we hold on to our money, we will certainly lose it," he said.
"It is that simple." Snow Stays, Money Goes
With inflation running at an estimated annual rate of 300 percent, Russians are at a loss to know what to do with their savings.
Some money is being siphoned off to pay for the recent big jump in food prices, but with faith in the future at a low point, many people now prefer to eat less and put their rubles into something more durable.

Here, for that future biography and for the record, is one example that has not yet seen print.


HOSPITALS MAY GET ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON MEDICARE BILLS
In an effort to discourage unnecessary health services and control costs, the Bush Administration plans to require hospitals to play a central role in arranging and billing for Medicare services, even when the services are performed outside a hospital.
A confidential memorandum summarizing new rules to be issued soon by the Government has been circulated at the Department of Health and Human Services.
It says the rules will require hospitals to "assume financial responsibility" for many of the medical goods and services that elderly people receive as outpatients after leaving the hospital.
The new requirement applies to laboratory work, X-rays, CAT scans, magnetic resonance imaging, scores of tests and the rental and purchase of medical equipment like wheelchairs.


BULGARIA STUDIES BOGUS COMPANIES
The Bulgarian Government will investigate companies that it believes siphoned millions of dollars from state funds and spirited them abroad, a high-ranking Bulgarian official says.

Howard A. Rusk, the founder of the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University and a columnist and contributing editor of The New York Times.


PAST DUE
My parents were fortunate to live well into their 80's, and though they were what one must consider lower middle class, and at times even poor, they took enormous pride in paying their bills promptly.
Every time I wrote a check for their bills following their death, I felt a sense of pride, in that I was perpetuating their good name, as they would have wanted me to do.
Larson seems to feel cheated that he should have to pay for his mother's care because she could not be cured of the metastatic cancer from which she appears to have suffered.
I am sorry that he finds the bills "dispassionate," but insurance carriers do insist on codes.
Dr.
S. may have spent a scant 10 minutes with Larson's mother, for which the author states she was charged $90, but I am sure he spent a good deal more time outside of her room, reviewing X-rays and laboratory reports, conferring with the other treating physicians and writing charts.

New American Cooking in a Colonial Setting
EIGHT years ago Standish House in Wethersfield first opened as a restaurant.
The town-owned house was sublet to the proprietors, Gian and Valerie Marchesan, by the Wethersfield Historical Society.
The town is a real tourist magnet, full of vintage historic houses to visit, and visitors need an attractive place to dine after sightseeing forays.
Until Standish House opened, the town had no such place.
Fortunately, Standish House fills the bill beautifully.
The center-hall, double-chimney clapboard house in Georgian and Federal style dates to 1787.
The two dining rooms, to the left and right of the center hall, look much as they may have in their 18th-century prime, each with a fireplace, graceful chandelier, Chippendale and Queen Anne chairs and inside shutters.

Missing Baby Is Back Home

Officers said the sitter, Tianya Varra, 17 years old, and the child's mother, Kim McIver, had misunderstood each other on arrangements for the child.


IN FROM THE COLD
As Stephen Budiansky explains in his article "Out of the Cold" (Dec. 22), domestication can be a two-way bargain of mutual advantage and not just a one-way exercise in exploitation.
Blair Drawson's superb illustration, with the tiny cave man leading an enormous bull by a slender rope, displays this bargain with great art.
I am reminded of the relationship between man and animal every time I go out into an open field to bring in a trained horse to be saddled and bridled.
That's often a tricky ritual.
The cup of grain the rider holds in one hand, while he holds the rope behind his back with the other, is more a token than a bribe, when both horse and rider are standing knee-deep in sweet grass.
Last summer, a princely thoroughbred kept me dancing after him for almost an hour in a 10-acre field -- then ran past me into the barnyard and stood like a statue while I fitted him out with bit, belts and buckles for a splendid day in the forest.


The Minibus From Loneliness
"What would I do in Florida?" The answer Julia has in mind is plain: nothing.
Since her parents emigrated from Poland in 1910, she has lived in Brooklyn.
It is where she went to school, got her first job sewing ($3 a week), where she married, raised a family and bought her daughter a home.
Julia, 90 years old and widowed, is mentally sharp and too vigorous to sit home all day, but she can no longer go out walking in the winter or at night.
Julia hates to ask her grandchildren on Long Island for favors, and her daughter is now 70 and blind.
So every weekday, a minibus operated by the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged provides her with round-trip transportation to the Williamsburg Senior Center, where she enjoys a hot lunch, planned activities and the company of friends.
The minibus, which serves senior citizens of all races and creeds, is just one of many programs for the elderly supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.


A Family Gets Back on Track With Help From the Neediest
Time was, the Rosas had enough -- not a lot, but enough.
Maria Rosa, 26 years old, remembers when she and her family could afford fresh vegetables and meat.
That was more than a year ago.
"My son is anemic. He is used to fresh food and we eat out of cans now." she said, glancing sadly at her husband.
Until early last year, her husband, Richard, worked regularly for various delivery companies, providing him with enough income to support his family.
But he was laid off last February and was unable to find another job.
Even though both had gone to night school and were certified building superintendents, they still had trouble finding steady work.

All-Stars Shoot, Score and Shoot More
The National Hockey League All-Star Game is the one hockey game of the year after which the losing players don't grouse and mutter and answer questions, heads down, with one or two words and cliches.
And this afternoon, it didn't matter that the Campbell Conference had defeated the Wales Conference here at the Spectrum by 10-6: Bryan Trottier was happy to have been a part of it and to have scored a goal.
"I played my first All-Star Game here in Philadelphia," said Trottier, a former Islander and current Pittsburgh Penguin who played in his first All-Star Game in 1976 and was added to this season's game under the senior category established last season.
"I played my 1,000th game here, too, and the fans gave me a standing ovation. I have a few special memories here."

NEITHER uptown, nor downtown, and too far south to be midtown, the Kips Bay area stretches like a street bazaar, with no clearcut identity, from the East River to Lexington Avenue, between 23d and 34th Streets.
A hodgepodge of town houses, tenements, luxury high-rises, subsidized housing, shelters for the homeless, hospitals, Chinese take-outs and expensive restaurants, it never developed the neighborhood feel of, say, nearby Gramercy Park or Murray Hill.


Ideas &amp; Trends; Obscenity Laws Exist, But What Breaks Them?
WHEN the Police Chief of Guilderland, N.Y., warned three local record stores this month that they could face obscenity charges for selling recordings with explicit lyrics, the furor he provoked reflected a telling fact: the state's obscenity laws have become virtually unenforceable.
"At one time -- and this is going back at least 10 years -- there were prosecutions and convictions on all kinds of obscene material, obscene movies, obscene books," said Howard R. Relin, the District Attorney of Monroe County.
"There are much fewer now."

An Unapologetic Man About Town
To the Editor:
Judging from the manner in which Evelyn Toynton chose to quote Peter Schjeldahl against himself in her review of "The Hydrogen Jukebox" (In Short, Dec. 8), she has neither an ear for irony nor a basic sense of humor.
These lacks pretty well disqualify her from assessing a writer whose work depends on both.
Poet, freelancer and streetwise
flaneur,
Mr.
Schjeldahl has affinities with his near contemporaries James Schuyler and John Ashbery as well as notable antecedents in Frank O'Hara, Apollinaire and, of course, the master-source, Baudelaire.

Hokusai: From High Drama to the Human Comedy
Installed to maximum advantage in new galleries designed by the British architect Norman Foster, the exhibition of prints and drawings by Hokusai (1760-1849) at the Royal Academy in London is a glorious experience. (It is a sign of the times that four major American museums from coast to coast coveted the show but had to withdraw for lack of money.)
Hokusai was not "a printmaker" in the present-day sense of someone who oversees every phase of the production.
He was a print designer whose sketches were worked over, cut into wood blocks and finally printed, with each step performed by three successive groups of master craftsmen.


CAMPUS LIFE: Purdue; Condom Machines Are Installed In 3 Dormitories
A group of Purdue University students has devised a few simple measures to help prevent AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases and moved them to where classmates live -- the university's residence halls.
The first step was completed before the start of this semester when condom-vending machines were installed on a one-year trial basis in the restrooms of three residence halls.
At year's end, the university along with the management of the participating halls, counselors and student organizations will decide whether the vending machines should be installed in all 16 residences.

Bush to Propose $500 Million Rise In Budget for Head Start Program
President Bush will propose an increase of more than 23 percent in Federal spending for preschool children in the Head Start program, and he will expand it to combat illiteracy and unemployment among parents of children enrolled in the program, Administration officials said today.
In his new budget request, to be submitted to Congress in 10 days, Mr.
Bush will seek an increase of more than $500 million for the popular program, which now serves 621,000 children at a cost of $2.2 billion this year, the officials said.

A Worthy War
The historical revisionists are already at work.
Last year's triumph in the war against Iraq, they claim, has turned to ashes.
We won the war only to lose the peace.
But the naysayers who make this argument too cavalierly dismiss the strategic and diplomatic benefits produced by Operation Desert Storm.
To be sure, the fact that Saddam Hussein remains in power is deeply disturbing.
But this hardly constitutes an argument against the war, particularly since he would still be comfortably ensconced in Iraq
and
Kuwait if we had not moved against him.

Dinkins Adviser Resigns Over Bank Withdrawals
The finance chairman of Mayor David N. Dinkins's re-election campaign committee stepped down on Friday after it was discovered that he had made unauthorized withdrawals of about $158,000 from the campaign's bank account, the counsel to the campaign said yesterday.
The former campaign official, Arnold Biegen, a Manhattan lawyer who has been a longtime election adviser to the Mayor, wrote 29 checks to himself from the campaign account between August and December, said Harold Ickes, the counsel to the Committee for David Dinkins II.


The Esthetic Pleasure of Trees in Winter
WINTER walks are wonderful to take.
Just being outdoors is a pleasure, and walking is one sure way to see the architecture of trees.
The leaves are gone, and their barks are exposed.
One of the trees that really stands out at this time of year is the sycamore.
It can be seen for quite some distance, because the glorious bark is never as clearly visible as it is now.
Without leaves the outline is truly spectacular.
The massive tree has exfoliating bark.
That is a fancy botanist's term to describe bark that flakes off in irregular patterns to reveal what is underneath.
This pattern is what makes the sycamore worth a second look.
Some may want to describe the massive trunk as having a jigsawlike pattern.
Others may say the tree's bark appears mottled.

Catholic Education In a Quandary
Reading the Dec. 1 article "Catholic Schools Face Financial Strain" saddened me as a former teacher at Good Counsel High School about the quandary that Catholic education is in.
Through no real fault of their own, Good Counsel schools have now reached an impasse regarding their future.
I can sympathize with the teachers who are employed here since my teaching career also began under less than ideal circumstances during the latter part of the 60's, when the average salary was less than $4,000 a year with an average class of close to 40 students.
Through trying times then as well as now, one thing prevailed as brought out by the article: education and learning still endure.


Keeping the Burning Fireplace Smokeless
FIXING a smoky fireplace is usually not too difficult.
Arrangement of the logs and how they are tended are often responsible.
Always arrange the logs on andirons or on a raised grate set as far back into the fireplace as possible.
Raising the logs lets air to enter from underneath, enhancing combustion.
Raising the logs also raises the height of the flames, so that smoke is less likely to waft forward before being channeled upward by the fireplace's overhanging upper edge, the chimney breast.

New Yorkers, etc.
There are probably a few mothers somewhere in the world who don't dispense bromides, homilies and pithy nuggets of advice to their offspring.
Where these women are, goodness only knows, because there is scarcely an adult around today who doesn't remember a childhood of hearing favorite words of wisdom constantly repeated.
Very often, this advice was a truism of grand triteness, on the order of "a penny saved, a penny earned" or "a rolling stone gathers no moss." But many mothers chose platitudes not quite so mundane, and some even came up with strange and occasionally funny counseling of their own (fathers generally were, and are, also-rans in this area).
Still, no matter how the advice was phrased, reactions on the part of the young listener didn't vary to any great degree.

At Home Abroad; Bush's Crucial Decision
Nothing else President Bush does this year is likely to matter as much, in human terms, as how he answers Israel's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees.
He will be deciding on the chance for peace in the Middle East.
The critical question is whether the President ties any guarantees to an end of Israel's massive current settlement drive in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
If he does not, Palestinians will see his decision as a signal that Israel can and will go on taking what they consider to be their land.

The Township Council recently voted unanimously to approve a law requiring that youths 14 years of age and under wear safety helmets while riding.
It is believed to be the first municipal law of its kind in the state and has been hailed by many parents, law-enforcement officers and children here.

Communities Told to Improve Water Purity
NEW Federal and state standards for water quality are forcing local officials in Westchester to step up plans for expensive filtration plants or to search for alternative supplies.
The mandates are also increasing demands for a regional approach to water management.
Westchester relies on the vast New York City reservoir system for 85 percent of its drinking water.
Earlier this month, 11 municipalities in the county learned from state health authorities that their current treatment programs are inadequate and that new proposals to meet strict new standards of water purity must be submitted by March 31.

Can Gooden Work Off the Cuff?
Dwight Gooden, if he is given the baseball and told to take the mound for the Mets in 1992, will be a diminished pitcher as a result of the surgery that repaired a significantly damaged right shoulder last September.
He will tire faster.
His fastball will lack its full ferocity.
He will face a consuming struggle with fears about his present vulnerability and long-term future.
It's a prognosis that front-office executives with the Mets have fought against in their hearts from the morning of Sept. 7, 1991, when the 27-year-old Gooden had a partial tear of his rotator cuff and a tear of the glenoid labrum corrected by an hour's worth of arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan.

Stew: Old-Fashioned Winter Warmth
ON a cold winter day, forget grilled fish with salsa.
Nothing beats an old-fashioned stew.
In England recently, on a particularly bone-chilling day, a friend made a beef stew with dumplings, a dish I hadn't had for years.
The dumplings were light and airy, the stew rich and dark, filled with potatoes, carrots and green beans along with chunks of meat.
The dumplings contained an ingredient more familiar in the British kitchen than in America: suet.

Putting himself into an unusual rift with Mayor David N. Dinkins, the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, has come out in opposition to a move that would delay this spring's elections for city school boards by one year.
The State Legislature passed a bill earlier this week to impose the delay, which the Mayor and other city officials have sought in the hope that it would spur the lawmakers to act this year on a major redrawing of district lines and other changes sought by some groups trying to increase public involvement in the schools.

Bobby Rahal, a race driver more accustomed to selling cars than buying them, found himself on the other end of an irresistible deal a couple of months ago.
Rahal, the 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner, had left the Galles-Kraco Indy-car team for Patrick Racing soon after the end of the 1991 season.
He had felt too confined by the push of the owner, Rick Galles, for a three-year contract, and Rahal also knew that Al Unser Jr., his teammate, had the kind of long-term relationship with Galles, a fellow New Mexican, that would always give Unser an intangible edge on the team.

A TRAIL OF HEART'S BLOOD WHEREVER WE GO, by Robert Olmstead. (Avon, $11.) A Vietnam veteran who has become the undertaker in a small New England town learns some surprising lessons about the way people die.
The result is "a kind of prose 'Spoon River Anthology' " notable for "the intelligence and humaneness of the voice, the grace and clarity of the prose," Michael Malone said here in 1990.
BAGHDAD WITHOUT A MAP: And Other Misadventures in Arabia, by Tony Horwitz. (Plume, $10.) Tony Horwitz knew he was adrift in an unfathomable land when, at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's funeral, a man who had been chanting "Death to America" confessed that his dream had always been to visit Disneyland and take his children on the teacup ride.
From his "wacky, often hair-raising, experiences,  [ the author ]  has fashioned 'Baghdad Without a Map,' a very funny and frequently insightful look at the world's most combustible region," Barry Gewen said here last year.
"Fearlessness is a valuable quality in a travel writer, and Mr. Horwitz, who is now a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, seems as intrepid as they come."

What Is Human About Furs?
"Long Island Q&amp;A: Maria Cattallanotti, Buying a Fur Coat in an Age of Animal-Rights Protesters"  [ Dec. 22 ]  was both insulting and offensive.
Ms.
Cattallanotti stated "that the raising of the animals for coats is done as efficiently and humanely as possible." Ms.
Cattallanotti failed to elaborate on exactly what this "humane" treatment entails.
Perhaps Ms.
Cattallanotti would like us to believe beavers, raccoons and minks live the good life on an idyllic farm until their time comes.
In fact minks and foxes (animals mostly farmed) spend their man-altered short lives jammed into tiny filthy wire-mesh cages where they suffer from poor diets, inadequate water, contagious diseases and severe stress.
As to her efficiency point, because pelts and profits -- not the animals' welfare -- is what most concerns the furrier, the animals are killed by cheap but agonizing methods such as anal electrocution, poisoning, decompression and suffocation.
Those who don't die outright are simply skinned alive.

Bridge
It is safe to assume, and the reader may be relieved to learn, that the auction shown in the diagram is both the longest and the most incomprehensible that will appear in this column this year.
It is an example of a relay auction, and it makes as much sense to an average player, or even to an uninitiated expert, as computer language does to someone whose only language is English.
Relay systems are rarely encountered in North America but are popular among some experts on other continents.
The idea was introduced by Pierre Ghestem and Rene Bacherich of France four decades ago, and they used it to good effect as members of a French team that won world team titles in 1956 and 1960.
It was revived in a more comprehensive form 20 years ago by David L. Cliff of Basking Ridge, N.J.
He persuaded several young experts to try his ideas, and they had many successes.
Other relay languages, based on the same principle, have been developed in New Zealand, Australia and parts of Europe.

Revolutions, at least since the French set the paradigm, have depended heavily on images -- symbols, pageants, paintings -- to promote the cause of radical change.
The Soviet Union after 1917 outdid all previous attempts to draft the visual arts into service.
The arts themselves were in revolution -- said the painter Kasimir Malevich, "May the overthrow of the old world of art be penciled on your palms" -- and vanguard artists eagerly sought to communicate the benefits of Bolshevism to the illiterate masses.
The new langagues of art promised a new society, a new way of looking at it, a new human potential.
Artists decorated streets, buildings, buses, trolleys and the trains and boats that traveled through the countryside spreading the message of revolution.
In 1920, Malevich and his supporters painted the streets and walls of Vitebsk white, then added colorful circles and squares -- an entire town re-envisioned.

The World; What Kind of Economy Would a Palestine Have?
ISSA ABUAITAH and his 200 employees at the Jordan Plastics Company make mattresses, housewares and industrial containers in this village, a 10-minute drive from Jerusalem.
The factory, wedged between stone houses, is no high-tech wonder: machines mixing polyurethane foam and quilting mattress covers get a lot of help from human hands.
But Jordan Plastics competes successfully in Israeli markets because its products are well made and its labor costs are low.
And just such enterprises, analysts have begun to say, represent the main chance for prosperity in an autonomous or independent Palestine.
The current negotiations over the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are still at only the earliest stage.
Last week, announcements that two right-wing parties would leave Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's coalition in outrage that the Israeli leader would even consider autonomy, underscored how tentative the talks are.
But if autonomy ever appeared likely, economic factors would soar in importance.
Already, experts are looking at the possibilities, and many agree on one principle: The viability of an autonomous Palestinian economy would depend on keeping it open to the world in general, and to Israel in particular.

The Esthetic Pleasure of Trees in Winter
WINTER walks are wonderful to take.
Just being outdoors is a pleasure, and walking is one sure way to see the architecture of trees.
The leaves are gone, and their barks are exposed.
One of the trees that really stands out at this time of year is the sycamore.
It can be seen for quite some distance, because the glorious bark is never as clearly visible as it is now.
Without leaves the outline is truly spectacular.
The massive tree has exfoliating bark.
That is a fancy botanist's term to describe bark that flakes off in irregular patterns to reveal what is underneath.
This pattern is what makes the sycamore worth a second look.
Some may want to describe the massive trunk as having a jigsawlike pattern.
Others may say the tree's bark appears mottled.

Now, he said, "the time has come for a new mission."


According to Lou Reed, Life Is a Fatal Journey
Most of the songs on Lou Reed's brave new album, "Magic and Loss," look squarely at death and dying, a subject that -- except for trite melodramas about teen-age suicide and car crashes, or the Halloween shock imagery of some heavy-metal lyrics -- has traditionally been anathema to rock.
In "Magic and Loss," a suite of 13 songs, one of them repeated in a second version, there are no teen angels beckoning from the other side.
Nor have the departed been reunited to play for eternity in a cozy rock-and-roll heaven.
The suite's dying protagonist is not a sexy young motorcy clist who goes up in a ball of flame, but an unnamed middle-age man wasted away by illness.
"I saw a great man turn into a little child/ The cancer reduce him to dust," intones Mr.
Reed in "The Power and the Glory." "I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs." And in "Dreamin'," he recalls, "They say in the end the pain was so bad that you were screaming/ Now you were no saint but you deserved better than that."

Hunting Interests Dominated Deer Panel
The White-Tailed Deer Study Committee mentioned in the Dec. 8 article "Hunting Season Revives the Debate Over Deer" was supposed to be balanced and representative of all views -- a blue-ribbon panel.
In actuality, the committee was top heavy with pro-hunting advocates.
Blue-ribbon used as an adjective means: of the highest quality; carefully selected.
Well, the group that was appointed was evidently very carefully selected.


An Exciting Match For Millrose Games
Ever since the venerable Millrose Games, long the Wanamaker Millrose Games and briefly the Panasonic Millrose Games, became the Snickers Millrose Games last year, the meet director, HOWARD SCHMERTZ, has done his best to mouth the name with a straight face.
After all, nobody knows better than he that whether they run department stores, manufacture television sets or make candy bars, sponsors -- and sponsor-paid appearance fees -- are crucial to the success of an indoor meet.
Now, for the 85th games, at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 7, the nomenclature has become a bit easier to swallow.
That's because LEROY BURRELL, the 60-meter world indoor record-holder and the world's top-ranked 100-meter man, has entered the 60-meter event, challenging last year's Snickers winner and the world indoor champion, ANDRE CASON.

NBC Thinks Being No. 1 Is Too Costly
NBC has no interest in losing tens of millions of dollars on sporting events to remain the highest-rated network, Robert C. Wright, the network's president, told a group of investment counselors on Friday.
Changes in the television business climate -- including the high cost of sports rights fees and the advertising slump -- will make it very unprofitable to be the No. 1 network through 1993, Mr.
Wright said in a speech to the Private Placement Conference in New York.
NBC had been the highest-rated network for six straight years.

Beijing Journal; Crime Is Up in China, and So Is the Public's Rage
Chinese prisons tend to be short of food and long on lice, beatings, and coffin-sized punishment cells.
Felons can be executed immediately after the most perfunctory of trials, even for nonviolent offenses like embezzlement, and criminals' families are sometimes billed a few cents for the cost of the bullet used to execute their loved ones.
In China many people have strong feelings about these conditions.
They complain that the authorities coddle criminals.

A Chicken/Egg Debate Over Bolstering Ruble
In the belief that a free market in Russia requires a convertible currency as quickly as possible, President Boris N. Yeltsin's financial advisers are pushing to achieve this goal in the next few weeks -- over the objections of the Russian central bank and the doubts of the Bush Administration.
The battle over convertible currency, which would greatly increase the country's attractiveness to foreign investors, is the most visible aspect of a larger struggle between those who want the Yeltsin Government to end numerous subsidies and payments to the people as quickly as possible, and those who favor a slower phasing out of Government supports.

President Aristide, a populist priest who won Haiti's first genuinely democratic election 13 months ago with more than two-thirds of the vote, was also guarded in accepting the view of the Organization of American States that naming a new Prime Minister would constitute a political solution to the Haitian crisis.

NEW YORK CITY BABY'S DEATH RAISES QUESTIONS
A 5-month-old Harlem boy who had been badly burned more than a month ago died early Friday at New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center.
The case has become the focus of an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney and the New York City Medical Examiner, who said that the child was abused and that they were also looking into the possibility that mistreatment at the hospital contributed to the child's death.
A spokesman from the medical examiner's office said the autopsy showed that a feeding tube had been misplaced in the boy, puncturing his heart.

Review/Theater; Olden Days In Minsk, 3 Years Ago
"Bella, Belle of Byelorussia" at the WPA Theater, a delirious new comedy with music about neogeopolitics, might have been conceived by the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Karl).
The play was written by Jeffrey Essmann, the music by Michael John La Chiusa.
Although the show is brief, it is packed with shaggy commentary about everything from gulags to glasnost.
The title character is a young woman out of step with her time.
She is as wide-eyed as Judy Garland in an M-G-M backstage musical.
The year is 1989 and the Soviet Union is on the verge of collapse, but the backward-looking Bella, a tractor-factory worker in Minsk, wants nothing more than to be enrolled as a member of the Communist Party.
In contrast, her pragmatic family and friends are scrambling aboard the leaky ship of capitalism.

Unlikely Family Outing Addresses Peer Pressure
The youngsters watching the Sunday matinee of "Juice," the latest film to stir fears of teen-age violence, were not the usual crowd.
Many of them, for example, had their mittens safety-pinned to their sleeves.
And few of them could not have even gotten into the R-rated film without the parents who brought them.
Certainly, the film whose poster says: "Power. Respect. Juice. How far would you go to get it?" seems unlikely fare for a Sunday family outing.
But for many parents in the half-filled theater at 84th Street and Broadway yesterday, "Juice" was one way to address the daily violence and peer pressure their children will probably confront, if they haven't already.

Confirmations of more than two dozen Federal judges have been stalled because of the sharp limits placed on Congressional access to investigative reports on Presidential nominees, Administration and Congressional officials said.
Members of both parties have told the White House that the restrictive new rules imposed in the aftermath of the Clarence Thomas hearings are impractical.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democrat of Delaware and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has told the Administration that it will be all but impossible for his panel to consider any of the 28 judicial nominees submitted under the new procedures, several Congressional aides said.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; Networks Tuning Out Pilots As a Way to Develop Shows
LIKE many other traditions from network television's past, the process of beginning a new prime-time series with a highly produced, carefully polished pilot episode is doing a slow fade-out.
Programming executives from each of the three big networks say they will make fewer pilots than ever this coming spring, looking instead to alternative -- and less expensive -- methods of developing new shows.


It Still Pays to Be Penny-Wise
To the Editor:
I'll tell you one thing pennies can buy ("The Penny Plague," Dec. 31): They buy a slightly lesser sales tax.
It's naive to suppose if pennies were abolished that all the six-, seven- and eight-cent sales taxes would go back to a nickel.
They would leap to 10 cents on the dollar.
Why give governments an excuse to rake in more taxes which they would promptly spend, and oversoak the average and even the poor citizens?
We should keep our pennies and spend them ourselves.
MICHAEL DRURY Newport, R.I., Jan. 9, 1992


CHRONICLE
Such widely divergent recipients as Secretary of State JAMES BAKER, the former heavyweight boxing champion MUHAMMAD ALI and the film director OLIVER STONE will be honored tonight in the Martin Luther King commemorations at the Sheraton Center in Manhattan.

California Leader Explains Speech Mix-Up
Gov.
Pete Wilson blamed himself and his press office today for the confusion surrounding the existence and identity of three men he referred to in his State of the State Message.
In a rare Sunday news conference, the Republican Governor introduced three men he said were the people he used in his Jan. 8 speech as examples of Californians who had been harmed by the recession.
The introductions came days after published reports in which Wilson staff members said the three workers did not actually exist but were composites.


1992 CAMPAIGN: Congress; With Ingredients for Revolt, Illinois May Lead Way in Anti-Incumbent Vote
If the American public's general unhappiness with Congress is going to cost individual lawmakers their jobs, the March 17 primary in once insurgent-proof Illinois will be the first place it shows.
The national anti-incumbent mood has already compelled unaccustomed campaigning by veterans here.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, chafes at hiring "handlers" who remind him to boast of accomplishments like getting money for expressway repairs.
But he takes the advice, adding grimly, "When I decided to run, I decided to win."

Tunisia Cracks Down Harder on Muslim Militants
The Tunisian Government, in an effort to eradicate the outlawed Islamic fundamentalist movement from the political landscape, has stepped up measures including censorship, frequent detention of suspected movement members and harassment of those who have beards or wear veils.
The moves have crippled the Islamic movement, which has seen its leaders and hundreds of followers flee into exile, land in prison or go into hiding.
It has swelled the confidence of the Tunisian authorities, who once tried a policy of reluctant accommodation of the fundamentalists.
It has brought a collective sigh of relief among Egyptian, Moroccan and Algerian officials, who are struggling to contain their own Islamic movements.


Dr. Cooke Weds Capt. William Foos
Dr.
Colleen Doris Cooke and Capt.
William Fredrick Foos were married yesterday at the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.
Chaplain Robert Geehan performed the United Church of Christ ceremony at the Cadet Chapel.
Dr.
Cooke, 27, an Army captain, is a resident in obstetrics and gynecology at the Madigan Army Medical Center, Fort Lewis, Wash.
She is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
William J. Cooke of Bergenfield, N.J.
She graduated from the College of William and Mary, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.
Her father is the engineer and director of public works for Ridgewood, N.J.
Her mother, Adele Cooke, teaches English in the Westwood, N.J., school system.


Reds' Larkin Scoops Up A $25.6 Million Contract
Conceding uncharacteristically to the realities of baseball life, Marge Schott yesterday took the boldest step of her controversial seven-year tenure as operator of the Cincinnati Reds.
She signed Barry Larkin, the Reds' All-Star shortstop, to a five-year contract worth $25.6 million.
Schott, who has cut costs wherever possible, and often where almost impossible, particularly at the scouting level, made Larkin one of the half-dozen richest players in the game.
More important, from the Reds' standpoint, she prevented him from becoming a free agent after the 1992 season.

Charge Against Mayor Strikes Chord in Birmingham
As Mayor Richard Arrington was resisting a Federal grand jury's investigation of corruption charges here this week, and being cited for contempt in the process he used the confrontation to try once again to attract national attention to his view that the Justice Department unfairly singles out black officials.
Letters went out from the Mayor's office to a host of local and national organizations inviting them to participate in a hearing here next month into "the selective prosecution and harassment of black leadership."


Japanese Stocks Fall
After losing a total of 1,201.62 points last week, Japan's leading stock index slipped below the 21,000 level today.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 407.55 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 20,913.82.
On Friday, the index lost 290.82 points.


Review/Critic's Notebook; Television's Many Women in Trouble, Real Trouble
Price, the son of a former Texas governor, marries Vickie, a frisky blond waitress whose favorite outfit is a halter and mini-mini-skirt.
She already has two children by her last husband and she and Price produce two more.
But the marriage begins crumbling as Price turns out to be an abuser of both alcohol and women and very likely a closet homosexual.
Vickie finally grabs a rifle.
A killing and a sensational trial ensue.
And television presents the nation with still another movie conveying an unmistakable message: For women these days life is perilous, if not worse.
There is nothing, it seems, like a little fear and paranoia to grease the ratings machine.


Apathy Is Seen Greeting Agony Of the Homeless
A decade after homeless and destitute people began flooding city streets, religious leaders say they fear that Americans are beginning to turn away from the outstretched hands, numbed by the severity of the problem and confused about how to respond.
The compassion that in the 1980's led to shelters, soup kitchens and other private efforts to help the victims of bad economic times has not disappeared, they say, but some fear that it is in danger of being overwhelmed.


It Is Executives' Privilege
It said something about sports and economics these days when only three athletes made the latest listing of The Sporting News's "100 Most Powerful People in Sports."
Of course, it's a subjective undertaking.
But the first athlete doesn't appear in until 31st (Magic Johnson).
Then you have to wait until No. 50 (Michael Jordan) for the next star, and then up to No. 81 for Jack Nicklaus.


Micron to Aid Maker Of Flat-Panel Screens
Micron Technology Inc., one of the few American semiconductor companies trying to compete with the Japanese in computer memory chips, is moving to compete in another arena where few American companies dare to tread: flat-panel display screens.
Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, announced on Friday that it was providing financing to a tiny Silicon Valley company that is developing flat screens using a technology that some experts say offers potential advantages over the liquid-crystal displays now commonly used in notebook computers.


Coleman Pushes Limit For Last Bobsled Spot
Chris Coleman was hyperventilating from the pressure at the finish line of the 50-meter ice track.
Tom Allen was weeping at the start.
And except for the 9-thousandths of a second that separated them, it was impossible to tell which man had won.
"This was the last thing I expected," said Coleman, who on his last push today edged out Allen to earn the eighth and final pushing spot on the United States bobsled team that will compete in the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, next month.
"I've never experienced anything so difficult in my life. I'm just glad that it's over."


Maker of Sleeping Pill Hid Data On Side Effects, Researchers Say
For two decades, critics contend, the drug company that makes Halcion, the world's best-selling sleeping pill, concealed data from the Food and Drug Administration showing that it caused significant numbers of serious psychiatric side effects.
The critics, who include drug and psychiatric experts who have analyzed company records produced in a recent court case, say the data showed the pill was more dangerous than other sleeping pills and was more likely to cause symptoms like amnesia, paranoia, depression and hallucinations.
The assertions have prompted the Food and Drug Administration to begin an investigation of the manufacturer, the Upjohn Company, and persuaded Britain to ban the drug outright in October.


Oliver Grace, Businessman, Dies; Investment Firm Founder Was 82
Oliver R. Grace, a philanthropist and co-founder of a major private investment company, died on Thursday while vacationing at the Everglades Club in Palm Beach, Fla.
He was 82 years old and was a resident of Oyster Bay, L.I.
He died of a heart attack, his family said.


Market Place; Was Japan's Trading Rigged? A Quiet Yes.
Little-noticed legal decrees handed down last month by Japan's Fair Trade Commission may have finally offered a partial answer to the most persistent, unresolved question from last year's securities scandals: Is the Japanese stock market rigged?
The decrees show how Japan's leading securities houses created bogus trades at will to generate profitable stock trades for selected clients, largely in an effort to win their highly lucrative securities underwriting business.
Well over $1 billion in such improper profits was created from this trading over a period of at least four years.

It Still Pays to Be Penny-Wise
To the Editor:
"Penny Plague" (news article, Dec. 31) was wonderful.
It mentioned many aspects of our smallest coin but did not cover what might be (at least for savvy New Yorkers) the most common attitude.
If one has to pay a bill for, say, $1.76, there is a canonical way to do this.
A sophisticate plunks down two one-dollar bills and adds a penny.
Thus we see the rule: pennies are used most often to avoid geting more pennies!
HARRISON ROTH New York, Jan. 2, 1992


CHRONICLE
After becoming ill with what appears to have been food poisoning on a return flight from India, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was discharged from New York Hospital yesterday at 1 P.M.
"and is doing fine," said Andrew Banoff, a hospital administrator.
Lawrence O'Donnell, senior adviser to Mr.
Moynihan, said, "the Senator feels absolutely great, aside from being beat after a two-week trip around India." He said he did not know what food had caused the Senator to become ill, and added that they were awaiting results from tests of a sample of fish served on the airline.


U.S. Investigators Sent to Chicago To Find Cause of Gas Explosion
Federal investigators have arrived here to determine the cause of a natural gas explosion that killed at least three people and devastated a 16-square-block residential area.
Faulty equipment is being blamed for the blast, which caused 21 fires and forced dozens of people from their homes Friday, one of the coldest nights this winter.


Recession Puts a Harsh Spotlight On Hefty Pay of Top Executives
The heft of an executive's pay packet used to be a matter of only passing interest outside the corporate community.
The highest-paid executives, ranked in business magazines each spring, were seasonal celebrities at best, envied by their peers, attacked by corporate gadflies.
Yet, suddenly, executive pay has become a national issue.
The slumping economy, layoffs, an election year and President Bush's decision to take a retinue of highly paid executives on his recent trip to Japan, where company chiefs are paid far less, have focused a harsh spotlight on corporate pay.


How Kennedy Viewed the Vietnam Conflict
To the Editor:
The theme of the Oliver Stone film "J.F.K." is that President John F. Kennedy planned to withdraw from Vietnam and that to prevent this, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and possibly people close to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson conspired to assassinate him.
Most of this is palpable nonsense, but as Kennedy's Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, the officer responsible for Vietnam, I can testify that the first point is essentially true and correct.
On numerous occasions President Kennedy told me that he was determined not to let Vietnam become an American war.
He agreed to have Americans serve as advisers, and he also authorized American pilots training Vietnamese to fly T-28's to do the actual flying -- covertly -- in bombing missions inside South Vietnam.
But he refused every suggestion to send American combat forces.


How Congress Can Help Hong Kong
If Hong Kong were an independent country, the interests of its people could be defended under international law.
But despite its vibrant economy and singular life style, Hong Kong is not independent.
In just five years, it will switch from being a British colony to being a "Special Autonomous Region" of the People's Republic of China.
Will Beijing abide by its promises to respect personal liberties and Hong Kong's capitalist way of life?
Americans can hope so.
But they can do more than hope.


Airlines Want No Role as Host To Detainees
Saying they are being forced to run what amounts to private jails in airport motels, an organization representing the major United States airlines with overseas routes is seeking to end a policy that requires them to house foreign detainees.
As a result of the policy, established by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, hundreds of aliens have been held for months at a time at the expense of the airlines that brought them here, while they are awaiting for their asylum applications to be processed.


ISRAELI PROPOSES ANNEXATION PLAN
Ariel Sharon, the hawkish Housing Minister and would-be national leader, said today that if Israel agreed to Palestinian autonomy in its occupied territories, it would have to annex areas where Jewish settlers live, declaring them to be part of Israel.
Mr.
Sharon's proposal envisions creating several Palestinian enclaves in the West Bank, centered in major towns like Nablus, Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jenin.
None of those zones would be contiguous.
The much larger land area surrounding them, where there are now at least 140 settlements and 110,000 Israelis, would fall fully under Israeli jurisdiction and law.

Declaring A War Of Nerves
Based on a tip from an intelligence source, a passing reference in a Jim Hoagland column and a quick run of the traps, I wrote here last week about the coming "April Surprise" -- covert stimulation of an uprising against Saddam Hussein, with backing this time from U.S. airpower.
Now comes some solid reporting by Patrick E. Tyler, a Plan B free-agent star enticed from The Washington Post by The New York Times in a move comparable to the Giants snatching Gary Clark from the Redskins.

1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats; Harkin Assails Competition In New Hampshire Debate
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa attacked several of his rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination tonight in an attempt to give fresh impetus to his faltering campaign.
In a two-hour debate on WMUR, the state's only network affiliate, and on the cable network C-Span, Mr.
Harkin accused Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas of imposing unfair taxes on "the little guy" and asserted that Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska had failed to protect American manufacturing jobs.
New Hampshire's primary, the first in the nation, takes place Feb. 18, and all five of the principal Democratic candidates joined the debate.


Cook Chips His Way to Playoff Victory
Getting hot when it mattered most, John Cook scored dramatic consecutive chip-ins on the last two holes of a four-hole, sudden-death playoff today to win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
After three of the original five players in the playoff were eliminated on the first two overtime holes, Cook chipped in from 20 feet for a birdie on the third extra hole to survive against Gene Sauers, and then made a 75-foot chip for an eagle-3 on the fourth sudden-death hole for the victory.


MacLean Is Not Perfect, but U.C.L.A. Is
U.C.L.A.'s Don MacLean is high (6 feet 10 inches), high scoring (he is on the verge of breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's school career-scoring record) and highly intelligent (a strong B student).
He is also high-strung.
Stories abound about MacLean's temperament.
He has alienated opponents in various ways, by throwing balls at them, for instance.
And a fight once left him with a fractured cheekbone.

Aristide Insists on Overhaul of the Haitian Army
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, whose elected Government was overthrown in a coup on Sept. 30, insisted today that there could be no settlement of the Haitian political crisis without the removal of the army chief and a thorough reorganization of the military.
President Aristide, a populist priest who won Haiti's first genuinely democratic election 13 months ago with more than two-thirds of the vote, was also guarded in accepting the view of the Organization of American States that naming a new Prime Minister would constitute a political solution to the Haitian crisis.

Watching Bubbles Rise In Caldron of Diversity
WHETHER Peter Minuit cheated the Indians or an enterprising tribe sold him an island it didn't own, their historic transaction may have been the first ethnic or racial conflict recorded in New York -- by whites, anyway.
For nearly four centuries since, New Yorkers have been obsessed by real estate and by race.
Ethnic and racial violence continues to strike an even more visceral chord as the threshold of indignation rises with each horrific crime.
The historic resonance of these conflicts may be comforting to some people because, after all, the city survived earlier episodes when verbal abuse gave way to violence.


6,800 Miles From Tokyo, East Meets West at a Shopping Mall
About once a month, when the selection at the local Stop and Shop in Warwick, R.I., just won't do, Masatomo Kobayashi gets into the car with his 9-year-old son and drives nearly four hours to Edgewater and the Yaohan Plaza.
There he first buys the cooperation of his son, Keiichiro, with a couple of plastic Japanese toy robots.
Then he goes about filling his shopping cart with enough soba noodles, daikon radishes and the like to save his family from falling back on hamburgers.


Bridge
Those who play regularly in clubs and tournaments will find many good things in a new book by Dr.

It is "More Tips for Tops", a wide-ranging discussion of important aspects of bidding, play and defense, and it is available for $12.95, including mailing, from Baron-Barclay Bridge Supplies, by calling (800) 274-2221.
One of the many useful tips for the player who wants a top concerns play from sequences in defense.
The normal play in third position is the lower of touching cards, but this routine move should be abandoned when the information it gives is more likely to help declarer than the other defender.


How to Aid Russians Is Debated
The breakup of the Soviet Union and Russia's swift embrace of radical economic reform have shifted the debate from whether the West should aid the former Soviet republics to how and on what terms.
At issue, according to some of the nation's leading economists, is finding the best way to bring vanquished cold war enemies into the camp of peaceful, prosperous capitalist democracies and avoiding anarchy, an authoritarian backlash and mass emigration.

American Film Magazine Sees the End
American Film magazine, which once aspired to gain a broad audience with serious, gossip-free articles about movies and television, has ceased publication after failing to reverse a decline in circulation.
Last week, the bimonthly's list of about 58,000 subscribers and other assets were sold to Entertainment Weekly, a more mass-appeal competitor of American Film's, for an undisclosed sum.


Leader of Bulgaria Wins Election Over Ex-Communists' Candidate
President Zhelyu Zhelev won the country's first direct presidential election on Sunday, defeating a lawyer backed by former Communists, unofficial results indicated.

For Relief, Try Thatcher
Nasty business is going on between the United States and Western Europe, and it could seriously damage this week's multi-nation conference in Washington on relief aid to the republics of the former Soviet Union.
What Euro-American parties need is a bold idea to overcome mutual suspicions about burden- and power-sharing and political credit-grabbing.
They need someone of international stature such as a Margaret Thatcher or Helmut Schmidt to coordinate emergency efforts all believe essential.
At a minimum, the conference should set up a high-powered executive committee to do the job.


Coming Back; Get Creative on Corrections
New York City officials are looking for a strong leader for the city's jails after last month's resignation of Correction Commissioner Allyn Sielaff.
The vacancy invites dramatic reorganization as well.
Merging the jail system with the Probation Department could make better use of funds spent on corrections, particularly to impose more meaningful sanctions for petty crimes that have become a routine irritant of city life.
New York City's jail system employs 14,000 people to incarcerate about 21,000 prisoners awaiting trial or serving short terms for minor crimes; Probation's 1,565 employees keep track of 60,000 adult and juvenile offenders released to the community under court supervision.


Death Sentence Reaffirmed For Cuban Exile, Report Says
Cuba's governing State Council has upheld a death sentence against one of three Cuban exiles convicted of planning terrorist attacks on the island, state-run Radio Reloj reported today.
Eduardo Diaz Betancourt, 38 years old, who was captured with two other men on Dec. 29 when they landed on Cuba's northern coast, faces the firing squad now that the Council headed by President Fidel Castro has declined to reduce his sentence, the radio said.


Review/Pop; Big Helpings of Punk-Rock Energy
A bright-eyed, collegiate audience was crammed into CBGB on Friday night for a bill that included Superchunk (from North Carolina), Luna (from New York) and Sebadoh (from Massachusetts).
All three are guitar-driven bands, steeped in punk-rock and seeking their own amalgams of candor, self-consciousness, irony, melody and noise.
Jumping all over the stage of CBGB, shouting about cynicism and alienation, strumming guitars and clobbering drums at top speed, the members of Superchunk wholeheartedly summon punk-rock's barrage of energy, as carried forward by bands like the Replacements and Husker Du.


It Still Pays to Be Penny-wise
To the Editor:
I found Richard E. Mooney's Editorial Notebook (Jan. 5) "Penny Wisdom" fascinating.
To date, since 1980, I have found a total of $120.34 including a copper penny from 1896.
I cash in coins to make dollars and dollars to create larger bills.
Tokens are used upon finding, and all foreign coins are left behind for tourists.
Tip: taxi seats have proved to be most lucrative; however, you must look before you sit down, otherwise change or, if lucky, bills, will slip behind the seat.
Curbs have also proved to be a good spot.
The hunt continues.

Scholarships for Jobless Engineers
In 1961, in the heady aftermath of Sputnik, in the age of the missile gap, some of the region's largest military contractors banded together to set up a school on the edge of an airfield here to train a new generation of engineers and scientists.
But three decades later, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and cuts in American defense spending, thousands of engineers who designed the planes, and missiles and electronic systems of modern warfare have been thrown out of work.


Magazine Focuses On Men Having Fun
A trade advertising campaign for a new men's magazine that will focus on travel and adventure contradicts singer Cyndi Lauper, claiming that it is guys, not girls, who just want to have fun.
The campaign, which begins today, presents Men's Journal as the magazine for men when their thoughts turn from the workaday world.
The initial print ad, to appear in the trade publications Advertising Age and Inside Media, shows a single photograph of a man skiing amid 39 identical photographs of a man waiting for a commuter train.
Future ads will repeat the device, contrasting hailing a cab with kayaking, and mowing a lawn with hiking.


Police Arrest 3 People In Hostage Situations
Police officers in Brooklyn and the Bronx defused two potentially dangerous hostage situations over the weekend, freeing the hostages without injury and arresting the suspects.
In Gravesend, Brooklyn, the police received a phone call about 7:40 A.M. yesterday from Gloria Gurspan, 38 years old, reporting that her husband, Theodore, 40, was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and that he was threatening her with a shotgun, said Capt.
Joseph Valente, duty captain for the Brooklyn South command.
The man later fired a blast at his apartment door toward officers who were in the hallway.
After Mrs.
Guspan managed to flee the apartment, the police entered to find her husband in a stupor and arrested him on a charge of attempted murder.


St. Anthony Streak Ended By Top-Ranked Dunbar
Rodrick Rhodes may be the toast of Jersey City, but the 6-foot-7-inch senior for St.

Rhodes scored 22 points, but so did Donta Bright of Dunbar of East Baltimore.
Bright, a 6-6 forward who shadowed Rhodes all evening, scored 22 points and converted a pair of free throws with 19 seconds left as Dunbar, the nation's top-ranked high school team, snapped St.
Anthony's winning streak at 40 games with a 50-49 victory.

U.S. Says Iran Paid Captors $1 Million for Each Release
Iran paid the captors of Western hostages held in Lebanon about $1 million for each of the 10 hostages released since early August, a senior Bush Administration official said today.
The payments, which were first reported today in The Washington Post, were in addition to regular financing that the Administration said Teheran had provided for years to shadowy Shiite Muslim fundamentalist groups holding hostages in Lebanon.

A 5-month-old Harlem boy who had been badly burned more than a month ago died early Friday at New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center, the police said yesterday.
The case has become the focus of an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney and the New York City Medical Examiner, who said that the child was abused and that they were also looking into the possibility that mistreatment at the hospital contributed to the child's death.

To many lawyers and bankers, Richard A. Gitlin was a surprising choice to be the United States examiner in the bankruptcy of the Maxwell Communication Corporation.
Although Mr.

A Chicken/Egg Debate Over Bolstering Ruble
In the belief that a free market in Russia requires a convertible currency as quickly as possible, President Boris N. Yeltsin's financial advisers are pushing to achieve this goal in the next few weeks -- over the objections of the Russian central bank and the doubts of the Bush Administration.
The battle over convertible currency, which would greatly increase the country's attractiveness to foreign investors, is the most visible aspect of a larger struggle between those who want the Yeltsin Government to end numerous subsidies and payments to the people as quickly as possible, and those who favor a slower phasing out of Government supports.


Finding a Bad Night's Sleep With Halcion
Although many people take Halcion without incident and although it is impossible to ascribe cause and effect to isolated case reports, many who took the sleeping pill swear it made them crazy.
William Styron, the author, became severely depressed in the summer of 1985, while he was using Halcion.
In his book, "Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness," published in 1990 by Random House, he wrote that he had amnesia and suicidal thoughts, forcing him to enter a hospital.
There, he said, the doctor took away his Halcion, his obsession with suicide vanished, and his depression lifted.
He concluded that the drug was "responsible for at least exaggerating to an intolerable point the suicidal ideas that had possessd me."


Shizuo Takano, 68, an Engineer Who Developed VHS Recorders

Takano's former employer, the Victor Company of Japan, known as JVC.


Review/Opera; Weill's Rendering of an African Tragedy
For more than four decades, Kurt Weill's last musical, "Lost in the Stars," has drifted in and out of theaters and opera houses, always with the hope that it would finally prove a classic.
In 1949, this adaptation of Alan Paton's novel "Cry, the Beloved Country" was a success, playing on Broadway for 273 performances.
Maxwell Anderson, who wrote the book and lyrics, gave the drama theatrical cachet, and Weill's songs promised classy melodies.
The New York City Opera presented the work in 1958; other revivals were mounted in 1972, 1986 and 1989.
A film version was released in 1974.


Rob Lowe Braves Farce
It was open season on Rob Lowe -- yes, that Rob Lowe -- as soon as the usual suspects realized the actor was making his Broadway debut in "A Little Hotel on the Side," the second offering of the National Actors Theater.
"A National Scandal," punned the headline on the People page of The Daily News when it ran pictures of Mr.
Lowe.
And Cindy Adams reminded her readers in The New York Post that Mr.
Lowe "personally staged a now famous production a while back in some little hotel on the side in Atlanta," referring to the actor's naughty videotape at the 1988 Democratic National Convention.
But Mr.
Lowe insists he's having the last laugh.
After all, he plays the ridiculously virginal Maxime, the earnest philosophy student, in the restaging of an 1894 farce by Georges Feydeau.
It is in previews at the Belasco Theater preparing for its opening on Sunday.


Russia's Cup Entry Appears Grounded
Russia's first attempt to compete for the America's Cup, characterized by bizarre circumstances, appears to have reached a bitter conclusion.
The Red Star '92 syndicate, the only one of two Russian groups authorized by San Diego race officials to compete in cup competition, acknowledged today that it has given up trying to transport by air its 75-foot racing yacht here from Estonia.


From Pulpits, Talk to Calm Racial Tensions
From the majestic pulpit of Riverside Church, the Rev.
Dr.
James A. Forbes Jr. scanned the diverse faces that showed his congregation to be one of the city's most racially mixed.
He urged them to look at one another.
"We are not integrated because we are shoulder-to-shoulder," he declared to the hundreds of worshipers.
"We are integrated because we are heart-to-heart."

It's One for All And Millions for One
Do baseball players resent it when a newcomer to their team makes a lot more money than anyone else?
BOBBY BONILLA will be playing his first season as a Met while earning $5.8 million a year, twice what any current Met earned last year.
Will dissension compromise the Mets' ability to win this season?
"In baseball, teams seem to do better when they have unequal salaries," said Prof.
JOSEPH W. HARDER of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
The conclusion is that the clubs that go for the expensive free agents do better.


ENVIRONMENT LAWS FACE A STIFF TEST FROM LANDOWNERS
Angry about regulations that control the use of their land, mining and timber companies, developers, farmers and other rural landowners have organized a movement that represents the strongest challenge to date to the nation's principal environmental laws.
In the most successful tactic they have discovered so far, the movement's lawyers have been filing lawsuits for the last two years in a little-known Federal court in Washington, the United States Claims Court.
Arguing that the rapid increase of environmental regulations in the last 20 years has restricted their right to use their own property, the landowners say such restrictions are tantamount to a "taking" of land.
They argue that just like landowners whose property is seized for roads, bridges, parks or other public purposes, they are entitled to just compensation as provided by the Fifth Amendment.
Backing in Congress
The Supreme Court is considering one such case from South Carolina, and a proposal to require the Government to compensate landowners affected by environmental regulations was approved by the Senate last summer and is pending in the House.
That proposal has vigorous support in the White House, which has also proposed legislation to make Federal agencies pay judgments in such cases from their own budgets, making officials accountable for the effect of the regulations.

Road to Minneapolis On 615 Miles of Film
It's back to football this year for STEVE SABOL.
"I've noticed recently there's a tendency by commentators to over-intellectualize," said Sabol, president of N.F.L.

"But to me, football's a visceral sport."


After Hiding, Killer Leaves Road Map
The escaped murderer who was captured on Saturday told the police that he eluded a widespread search in Rockland County, N.Y., by sleeping in the woods near the center of the police activity, dropping pepper to distract police dogs, using "survivalist" techniques and eating at fast-food restaurants on busy Route 59 in Spring Valley.
Officials said they were not sure they believed that account from Frank Vandever, who was captured on Saturday.
But they now believe that Mr.
Vandever and Ronald Rutan, who escaped with Mr.
Vandever from a Connecticut maximum-security prison on Dec. 31, robbed four 7-Eleven convenience stores in Bergen County, N.J., during the 10 days they were staying at an Econo Lodge motel in Spring Valley.


New Magazine By Times Co.
The New York Times Company Women's Magazines is starting Fitness, a sports and health magazine for women that will be published four times a year, starting in February.
The magazine has been published once or twice a year since 1987 as a spinoff of Family Circle magazine under the title Family Circle's Fitness Now!
Its success on the newsstand encouraged the company to redesign and reposition the magazine as a stand-alone publication.


Track Record Polishes Golden Globes' Gleam
Barbra and Bette showed up.
So did Warren and Annette.
And Dustin and Kevin and Arnold and Michelle and Robin and Anjelica and Jodie and just about every other major star and powerbroker in town crammed into a hotel ballroom on Saturday night for an old-fashioned Hollywood event that was, by all accounts, the glitziest and most curious awards ceremonies of the year.
The occasion was the 49th annual Golden Globe gala, a Hollywood tradition that is now taken with considerable seriousness -- tempered by plenty of private amusement and even derision -- in the movie world.
"Everyone is in on the joke and we're all dressed up sitting there and, like, in the middle of the dinner you always say, 'Can you believe we're all here?" said one prominent movie executive who, like numerous others, would only speak on condition of anonymity because the Golden Globes have emerged as increasingly influential on the Academy Awards.

Book Theft at St. Patrick's
A large religious book was stolen early yesterday from an altar in St.
Patrick's Cathedral, the police said.
The Book of the Gospels, on display in the Sacred Heart Altar, was taken between 6 and 7 A.M., before the first Mass at the cathedral on Fifth Avenue at 50th Street.

Pepsi Widens 'Generation' With New Pitch to All Ages
WHEN Coca-Cola introduced a completely new marketing campaign for its Pepsi-like "new" Coke in 1985, exultant Pepsi-Cola executives boasted that "the other guy blinked." Now, as Pepsi readies a revamped marketing campaign, it is Coke's turn to make the same taunt.
The new campaign for the Pepsi-Cola brand, to be introduced during the CBS telecast of the Super Bowl next Sunday, replaces the eight-year-old theme "The choice of a new generation" with a broader appeal, "Gotta have it." The campaign's initial three television commercials play down Pepsi's longtime yen for the young -- the so-called "Pepsi generation," which made its debut in 1962 -- in favor of inviting consumers of all ages to pick Pepsi over Coke.


Explaining the Reason for Today's Holiday


Despite Polls, Mulroney Bid Seems Likely
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has turned setback into advantage before.
In 1984, when he first sought to become Prime Minister of Canada, his Progressive Conservative Party was 14 percentage points behind the Liberals in opinion polls.
In 1988, six months before his second-term victory, the Tories were 25 points behind.
Canada's next elections are not likely before the fall of 1993.
Still, the Tories today are supported by only 16 percent of those surveyed, the lowest voter-approval rating for any governing party in this country.

Nat Holman Finds Life Still Bears His Name
Suddenly in the last few weeks the name Nat Holman has been in the news again on a daily basis, on the front page of newspapers, in the lead stories on television newscasts.
It had been 40 years since people had heard and read the name so often, when the man and not just the name was in the news.
The reason for the re-emergence was because the Nat Holman Gymnasium on the campus of the City College of New York was where the recent stampede of a crowd attending a basketball game of rap music celebrities resulted in nine deaths.
"It destroyed me, made me very unhappy," said a 95-year-old man sitting in his room, holding his cane, in the Hebrew Home for the Aged in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
"All these things are shockers. I'm sorry for those involved."

Review/Jazz; Deflating Pretensions In Celebrating a Genre
Because music used to be strictly divided into either of two categories -- serious and nonserious -- the popular notion of stirring together jazz, pop and classical styles, often in a single piece, still carries some overtones of an impish avant-gardism.
And on Friday evening at the second concert of Town Hall's Not Just Jazz series, four ensembles offered fresh, sometimes humorous perspectives on generic musical division.
In their various ways, the Turtle Island String Quartet, the California Guitar Trio, Nancy King and Glen Moore, and Lenny Pickett and the Borneo Horns deflated highbrow pretensions while celebrating the pleasure principles of pop and jazz.
The Turtle Island String Quartet, from Oakland, Calif., has been struggling for years to create a fluid, swinging ensemble style that can comfortably embrace everything from Beethoven to Miles Davis.
Its biggest obstacle has been a rhythmically anemic bottom end.
But on Friday evening, the group played with a robust verve that didn't detract from the music's textural outlines.


In Albany, a Long-Term Budget Is Best
To the Editor:
As a general rule, finger-pointing is rarely productive, especially when misdirected as in "The Republican Obligation in Albany" (editorial, Dec. 27).
The obligation in Albany to reach an agreement that will close New York State's budget deficit is neither Republican nor Democratic.
It is incumbent on all the parties to talk, negotiate and ultimately to make a difficult decision.
To lay blame at the feet of Senate Republicans is to unfairly burden them with the sole responsibility of forging consensus.
Criticize some of the specifics in the Senate plan if you will, or some of the plan's omissions.
But don't criticize its focus.
Any real long-term solution to the state's fiscal problems will have to include major restructuring of our explosively expensive Medicaid and welfare programs.


A Chicken/Egg Debate Over Bolstering Ruble
In the belief that a free market in Russia requires a convertible currency as quickly as possible, President Boris N. Yeltsin's financial advisers are pushing to achieve this goal in the next few weeks -- over the objections of the Russian central bank and the doubts of the Bush Administration.
The battle over convertible currency, which would greatly increase the country's attractiveness to foreign investors, is the most visible aspect of a larger struggle between those who want the Yeltsin Government to end numerous subsidies and payments to the people as quickly as possible, and those who favor a slower phasing out of Government supports.


A March Evening in Alabama
Thinking back to a soft spring evening in Alabama many years ago, he realized why critics of the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. seem so ignorant.
For years, officials somewhere have been quick to belittle Dr.
King as a lothario, a plagiarist, someone who consorted with people of
Communist
proclivities, and therefore undeserving of a national holiday.
The problem with the criticisms is not that they are petty or nasty.
It's that they are irrelevant.
For as Americans today take note of the murdered leader, they also recognize the millions who marched behind him, and do so still.


'Great Writ' Not at Issue in Habeas Debate
To the Editor:
In criticizing Chief Justice Rehnquist's proposal to restrict Federal habeas corpus review of state criminal convictions ("The High Court v. Habeas Corpus," editorial, Jan. 4), you condemn it as an assault on the "Great Writ of habeas corpus."
The "Great Writ" of history is the right of an arrested person to compel justification for his arrest before an independent magistrate or judge.
Though the Constitution only labels it a "privilege," the writ serves as an essential element of the separation of powers; for if the executive may also judge, it "might behave with all the violence of an oppressor" (Montesquieu, "Spirit of the Laws," XI 6).
We tend to take the "Great Writ" for granted, since our prosecutors and police forces are trained to bring those they hold before judges -- though we have always argued about how quickly that should occur.

How Kennedy Viewed the Vietnam Conflict; Further Evidence
To the Editor:
Historians and pundits criticize the movie "J.F.K." on the grounds that it plays loose with the facts.
On the subject at the very heart of the debate -- John F. Kennedy's Vietnam policy -- they play loosely with the facts themselves.
They claim that because Kennedy appointees like Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara and others advised Lyndon Johnson to send combat troops to Vietnam, that Kennedy, had he lived, would have sent them in too.
Sound convincing?
Perhaps, but it is so far from the truth.
Those same men also advised Kennedy to send in the combat troops, but that was something Kennedy always refused to do.
Kennedy turned down combat troops, not when the decision was clouded by ambiguities and contradictions in reports from the battlefield, but when the battle was unequivocally desperate, when all concerned agreed that Vietnam's fate hung in the balance, and when his principal advisers told him that vital U.S. interests were at stake.

The award was established last year by the Vatel Club, a national organization of chefs, and Frederick Wildman &amp; Sons, wine importers.
What distinguishes Mr.

K.G.B. Telltale Is Tattling, But Is He Telling U.S. All?
A spy who came in from the cold is suddenly hot.
Oleg Danilovich Kalugin, the former senior K.G.B. official who burst into public view in mid-1990 by denouncing the Soviet intelligence service that employed him for 32 years, is barnstorming America.
Appearing nonstop on radio and television talk shows from Los Angeles to New York, Mr.
Kalugin is helping Cable News Network promote its book on the collapse of the Soviet Union.
He is also addressing foreign policy groups, trying to find a publisher for his memoirs, arranging television and movie projects and talking to officials in Washington about his assertion that the Soviets interrogated American prisoners of war in Vietnam long after such prisoners were reportedly released.


Dark Tale of Keels And Potted Plants
Security is tight along San Diego's waterfront now that the America's Cup yachts are in place.
High-wire fences, alarm systems, guards and steel gates are as common as radar is in the military.
Almost everyone is trying to keep keel designs safe from the roving eyes of competing yachtsmen.
The boats, which are pulled by crane from the water each day, are draped with cloth to hide their undersides.
Access to the compounds is blocked by land, but divers in past cup campaigns have tried to spy from the water.
The skulduggery has prompted caution at the docks.

Germany Marks Place Where Horror Began
Fifty years after Nazi bureaucrats met at an idyllic lakeside villa here to plan the destruction of European Jews, the villa has been turned into Germany's first permanent memorial to the six million Jews who were put to death.
"In this house, on Jan. 20, 1942, a barrier of civilization was broken and the abyss of barbarism was opened," Heinz Galinski, an Auschwitz survivor who now heads Germany's largest Jewish organization, said at the opening ceremony today.

"To have 10 years of fun," Mara told him with a smile, "you'll have to stay in 30 years."


1992 CAMPAIGN: TV Critic's Notebook; Sound Bites Are Tuned Out, And Clearer Images Emerge
The producers of last night's two-hour get-together of contending Democrats on C-Span evidently learned something from NBC's 90-minute sound-bite festival last month.
Instead of trying to squeeze a few words from all the suspects on every subject in the world, Cokie Roberts, presiding, focused on three big domestic matters: the economy, education and crime.
She pressed the candidates politely if not always successfully for direct answers without trying to upstage them.
Although viewers may have been left with only a fuzzy notion of the specific proposals to which most laid claim, differences of message and of personality did come through.
To be sure, the candidates were united in their put-downs of President Bush for getting the country into its present predicament, three of them spoke of their young daughters and all celebrated their superior compassion.
But along the way they began to turn themselves into distinctive figures.

Amgen Inc., which won a long patent battle over its first drug, now appears to be getting ready for a battle over its second one.
The biotechnology leader, which is based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said it had asked in Federal District Court in Washington late Friday to declare that Amgen's new drug for stimulating the production of white blood cells did not infringe patents held by the Chugai Pharmaceutical Company of Japan.
Amgen also asked the court to declare the two Chugai patents invalid.


Police Look For Gay Bias In Car Death
A United States Customs inspector was run off the road in Nassau County because his assailant believed he was gay, the police said yesterday after charging a man with manslaughter in the inspector's death.
The Nassau County Police Department has not officially classified the death of 26-year-old Henry Marquez on Dec. 28 as a bias-related homicide.
A special unit of the police force will make that determination on Tuesday, said Detective Sgt.
William Cocks, who supervised the investigation.


Review/Opera; From China, Echoes of Puccini
A lot of bogus Puccini is being written these days by European and American composers with no evident stylistic convictions of their own, eager to capitalize on proven musical and dramatic formulas.
"Savage Land," a four-act opera from 1987 by the Chinese composer Jin Xiang, which was given its American stage premiere here by the Washington Opera on Saturday evening, is something else: a highly individual creation that -- though it nearly matches Puccini on his own terms, with slightly updated orchestral effects and far more convincing Orientalisms -- is invested with great conviction by a composer for whom turn-of-the-century European styles remain fresh and vital.
By his own account, Mr.
Jin, who is 56 years old, became enamored of both Western classical music and Chinese folk music in childhood and began a long march toward a career in composition.
But no sooner had he completed studies at the Central Conservatory in Beijing than he was sent to a remote forced-labor settlement because of "rightist" political leanings.
Finally, in 1979, he was released and allowed to compose.
But, Mr.
Jin has said, "my original foundation had been badly eroded, and I was unfamiliar with the new techniques." He had to retrain himself, and through these varied experiences he evolved a distinctive esthetic, which, in his description, combines Western technique and Chinese tradition with his own feelings and ideas.
The libretto of "Savage Land" was drawn from a well-known Chinese play, Cau Yu's "Wilderness," by Mr.
Cau's daughter, Wan Fang.
The story, set in northern China in the 1920's but similar in its themes to many an Italian opera plot, undoubtedly carried special resonance for the composer.
It centers on Zhou Hu, a young man wrongfully imprisoned for eight years, who escapes and wreaks vengeance on the family of the evil landlord responsible for his arrest and the destruction of his family, only to destroy himself in the process.
Mr.
Jin's vivid score quotes more or less directly from Stravinsky, Ravel and Prokofiev.
But the overriding sensibility is Puccinian, manifest in arias of arching lyricism.
Such a wholehearted adoption and eclectic mix of dated Western gestures by an Easterner might have been considered naive two decades ago.
But remarkably, Mr.
Jin's tortuous career path has landed him squarely in the current American mainstream, dominated by New Romanticism.
And he wields these varied styles and weds them to one another and to his native idiom with wondrous skill and subtlety.
Still, for a listener who has serious misgivings about the New Romanticism to begin with, this opera proves doubly disconcerting in some respects.
One of the notable achievements of the modern age has been the international dissemination of the products of the world's great civilizations, but with it has come a homogenizing tendency that now threatens the existence of certain cultural strains.
Though Mr.
Jin should not be made to bear undue responsibility, the very success of his cross-cultural enterprise further suggests a future in which the most salient features of all cultures are blended at the expense of the refinements of each.
This suggestion is only enhanced by the extent to which Mr.
Jin's long-breathed, soaring melodies obliterate the quicksilver pitch inflections of Chinese speech, so ingeniously mirrored in traditional Chinese opera.
The production is sung in Chinese, with English supertitles, and the six-member cast consists entirely of young Chinese singers trained in Western vocal style.
Sun You, who created the role of Zhou Hu in Beijing in 1987, acted and sang the part here with appropriate bluster, but also managed moments of tenderness, scaling his baritone down to an affecting thread of half-voice.
Ye Ying sang the role of his beloved, Jin Zi, with agility and clarity; an occasional hard edge to her soprano, rather than contradicting the vulnerability of her characterization, suggested an underlying strength.
But the most impressive performance of the evening was Jianyi Zhang's as Da Xing, the weak-willed son of the landlord.
Though Mr.
Zhang's forceful tenor, with ringing high notes and excellent evenness throughout its range, perhaps gave his character too much grandeur, in strictly vocal terms it was a joy.
Completing the fine cast were Yun Deng, as the landlord's blind widow, and Yuxin Li and Haojiang Tian, in lesser roles.
The conductor was Paulette Haupt, who was primarily responsible for bringing Mr.
Jin's opera to this country.
Having heard a rehearsal of the work in 1987 in China, she presented it a year later in piano readings at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., of which she is artistic director.
Though it was good to see the company's orchestra back in the pit after a protracted lockout earlier in the season, string ensemble was scrappy, and attacks, both instrumental and vocal, were often tentative.
The austerely beautiful production, directed by Leon Major, with sets by Andrew Jackness and costumes by Martha Mann, will run at the Eisenhower Theater in the Kennedy Center through Feb. 9.

Generational Chasm Leads to Cultural Turmoil for Young Mexicans in U.S.
Imelda H.'s temper flares when she talks about her upbringing in Magnolia Park, the oldest Mexican neighborhood in Houston and a place rife with confused identities.

"My mother would give me these silly dresses to wear to school, not jeans. No jewelry. No makeup. And they'd always say, 'Stick with the Mexican kids. Don't talk to the Anglos. They'll boss you.' "

The seduction began with a flower, one perfect red silk rose.
Then there were telephone calls, lots of telephone calls, and sweet notes.
Chocolates followed, expensive, delicious chocolates, dragees dipped in gold flakes and luscious truffles.
There were invitations to fancy parties, spur-of-the-moment visits and glossy you-can-trust-me photos.
All that you would expect in a storybook courtship can be found in the way that Eileen Goudge and her publisher, Viking, have been trying to romance reviewers, bookstore managers and readers to turn her into a commercial fiction writer with the stature and sales of Danielle Steel.

700 Burmese Muslims Said to Die in Detention
At least 700 Burmese Muslims died of suffocation in crowded warehouses in their homeland where they were detained by soldiers, a newspaper reported today.
The victims were among about 2,800 Muslims the soldiers detained in northern Arakan Province a month ago, the independent Bangladeshi daily Sangbad said.
The deaths occurred in the last week, the paper said.


Two Wounded in Shooting
Two people were shot last night on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the police said.
Robert Vargas, 22 years old, of 59 West 87th Street, was shot in the right leg by one of several men he was arguing with at Columbus Avenue and West 88th Street.
A 15-year-old youth, who was not involved in the dispute, was hit in the right shoulder.
Both victims were reported in stable condition.


So What's in the Cage? Excitement With Ears
THE excitement had built all week in the preschool class at the Wilton Family Y. The animal lady was coming, and she might bring real live animals.
Now kids know instinctively that no sane adult, especially teachers like Marcia Shushan and Maggie Schluntz, is ever going to suggest the exciting possibility of live animals unless they know darned well the creatures are coming.
No one, even after nap time, invites the volatile disappointment of a platoon of short people whose lifetime perspective is measured in months.
So the excitement of these 3- and 4-year-olds focused on exactly which animals were coming.
The teachers fanned all the flames of imagination -- well, almost all.
One boy's ominous suggestion about bears was squelched.
What animals this time?
The teachers feigned ignorance.
Could they touch them?
The teachers were certain.

Star Clusters Astonish Astronomers
PEERING deep into the heart of a distant galaxy, the Hubble Space Telescope has astonished astronomers by revealing a scattering of dense clusters of young blue stars.
They appear to be clues to the cataclysmic collisions of galaxies eons ago.
Astronomers were surprised by the discovery of such young examples of the celestial structures known as globular clusters, long supposed to be among the oldest features in any galaxy.


Washington Talk; Trying to Turn a Deficit Into a Political Asset
The problem for President Bush's budget planners this year was how to meet his election-year political needs without seeming to ignore the enormous Federal deficit.
They resolved the problem in the tried and true method inaugurated by Ronald Reagan when deficits first began to mushroom, and employed annually in the last few years by Mr.
Bush and his budget director, Richard G. Darman.
It involves proposing, with considerable fanfare, popular tax and spending measures and offsetting their cost on the balance sheet with accounting gimmicks and putative spending reductions that might be good policy but that the President has no intention of going to the mat for.
That lets him take credit for measures the voters like and blame Congress for the rising deficit.
This year, the President plans to propose a tax reduction of a few hundred dollars a year for the middle class, a tax credit of a few thousand dollars for first-time home buyers, tax writeoffs for medical insurance premiums, new depreciation rules to make investments in plants and machinery more attractive, tax breaks for the real estate industry that were scrapped six years ago and a little more money for Head Start, one of the few programs Democrats and Republicans alike favor.
These proposals were written to appeal to particular voters or contributors like middle-class taxpayers, manufacturers, builders, realtors and investors.
But they would cost money.
So how would he pay for them?In part, with some proposals that would make some voters tighten their belts:
*Deep cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals, stiff increases in the premiums affluent elderly people are charged for Medicare insurance against doctors' bills and the imposition of the Medicare payroll tax on state and local government workers.
*The abolition of some entrenched Government programs like operating subsidies for mass transit and education grants to communities with military bases.
Do not expect to hear much about these items after the budget is made public Jan. 29.
They have all been offered before and were rejected by Congress out of hand.
Mr.
Bush has never expended an ounce of energy on their behalf.
The budget will also show increased revenue from proposals that cause little if any pain to anyone: a modest reduction in military spending; a cut in the capital gains tax that the Administration calculates would actually raise revenue; a new kind of savings account that would raise a few billion in additional revenue for the Government at first but cost billions more years down the road; bookkeeping changes in the way deposit insurance and pension guarantees are accounted for.
These Mr. Bush will talk about on in his campaign.
Unlike government budgets in parliamentary democracies, Presidents' budgets are not blueprints for the policies to be followed.
Here, Congress controls the purse strings.
The President can use his veto power to prevent the lawmakers from moving in directions he opposes.
But he can win acceptance of his own proposals only if he throws his weight around, and on his most controversial budget items, he has rarely done so.
If he had given the same kind of attention last year to persuading Congress to limit benefit payments to the affluent that he devoted, say, to blocking civil rights legislation or to winning confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, he might have carried the day and cut the deficit by billions of dollars.
As the election year wears on, Mr.
Bush will doubtless try to get off the hook with voters concerned about high taxes, bad schools and unaffordable medical insurance by pointing to his budget proposals and blaming Congress for inaction.
But the Democratic Presidential candidates can hardly complain.
They are free to make outlandish proposals.
And they do not have to present the other side of the ledger.


Review/Rock; Sound and Style of the 60's
An MTV-era musician whose values vastly predate the video age, Chris Whitley is a welcome anachronism.
Tonight at Maxwell's here, this New York-based singer and guitarist gave the kind of performance that might have seemed less unusual 20 or 25 years ago.
Wearing a scant white tank top that defied the winter cold, switching back and forth between an array of gorgeous antique guitars, Mr.
Whitley played a set that had much less to do with showmanship than with music itself.
Like some of the late-1960's British invasion guitarists who took their cues from Delta blues, Mr.
Whitley's rugged acoustic-slide style is derived from such proto-rock legends as Elmore James; like Neil Young or Keith Richards, he was completely absorbed in his playing, to the point that he seemed oblivious to the devoted capacity crowd urging him on.


Review/Television; Sun Myung Moon Changes Robes
If you've been wondering what the Rev.
Sun Myung Moon is up to these days, tonight's edition of "Frontline" offers a suspicion or two.
"The Resurrection of Reverend Moon," at 9 on Channels 13 and 49, produces evidence that since serving 13 months in Federal prison for conspiracy and false tax returns in the early 1980's, the head of the Unification Church has become a behind-the-scenes political force.
After a reminder of his celebrity or notoriety some years ago, when young Moonies were peddling flowers at airports and marrying en masse, the program focuses on operations like The Washington Times and the American Freedom Coalition, which it strongly implies are run to the right-wing specifications of the Unification Church.

Prague Has to Drive Fast in Economic Mud
To the Editor:
Valtr Komarek's attack on Czechoslovak reform ("Shock Therapy and Its Victims," Op-Ed, Jan. 5) misstates a few facts.
But the real mistakes are in the analysis.
First, Mr.
Komarek wrongly blames the bulk of Czechoslovakia's economic woes on the Government's reform program.
True, the Czechoslovak economy, like that of its neighbors, suffered in 1991.
But a major contributing cause was external shock, not just domestic therapy.

Broader Use Of Macintosh Software Set
A Silicon Valley company plans to announce a program on Wednesday that permits users and developers to run programs designed for Apple Computer's Macintosh on Sun, I.B.M. and Silicon Graphics work stations.
It will be the first significant attempt to use software designed for the Macintosh on other computers.
The company, Quorum Software Systems, said that it had shown the software to Apple executives and that the companies were discussing possible licensing or other arrangements.


Review/Theater; Looking Inward and Finding Emptiness
In a theatrical space as intimate as the Manhattan Theater Club Stage 2, you can tell when a play has gripped its audience, for no one seems to breathe, let alone shift in his seat.
The phenomenon can be observed first-hand these nights at "Sight Unseen," a smart and sad new comedy by Donald Margulies that has all sorts of unpleasant things to say about the 1980's art scene, the loss of love and the price of assimilation, both ethnic and intellectual, in an America where authenticity often has little to do with an artist's -- or anyone else's -- rise to the top.
The scene that reduces the house to a dead hush is an Act II encounter set in a sleek London art gallery where a provocative American painter named Jonathan Waxman (Dennis Boutsikaris) is being honored with a retrospective.
Jonathan, an intense, fashionably dressed young man who wears a pony tail and may or may not resemble Eric Fischl or Julian Schnabel, has been the subject of adulatory profiles in Vanity Fair and The New York Times.
He has a long waiting list of patrons who have commissioned his future pictures, sight unseen, at outrageous prices.
But to maintain his marketability, he must suffer through tedious interviews, like the one he is now giving to Grete (Laura Linney), a leggy blonde German woman who is a ferocious student of his work and tends to ask long, multi-clause questions in impeccable, if strongly accented, English.


Aggrieved British Car Owners Toast Notable Man of Action
Ever since John Thompson tried to dump the parking worker into Torquay harbor, people won't let him pay for his own beer.
Mr.
Thompson, a businessman in southwest England, recently became a kind of national hero for doing what thousands of motorists have probably wanted to do themselves.
After discovering that an employee's parked car had been immobilized by a wheel clamp, he took a forklift truck, hoisted a van carrying a worker from a private car clamping company, and tried to dump the van into the harbor.

2 Revlon Brands Sold; Executives Also Move
In what is emerging as a strategy to focus on its core business, Revlon Inc. has sold two more of its brands, and several of its top international executives went along with the businesses, the company said yesterday.
The company said four unidentified Saudi brothers bought Halston, a troubled fragrance and licensing business.
They also bought Princess Marcella Borghese, a solid high-priced line of cosmetics and skin-care products sold mainly through department and specialty stores.
Revlon did not say how much the two businesses had fetched.


Treasury Market Study Said to Seek New Policy
The Government report done in the wake of the Salomon Brothers trading scandal will propose that the Treasury Department sell extra bonds or notes when the department determines that there is a squeeze in the government securities market, according to people who have seen part of the study.
This move, aimed at relieving the pressure on investors who are forced to pay higher prices because of an illegal or legal shortage of securities, will represent a significant policy change for the Treasury.
It has traditionally kept its hand out of the $2 trillion market, where the Government borrows the money it needs to cover the growing budget deficit.


Separating Margarita From Foster Parents Was Grave Injustice
To the Editor:
In "A Warning From Margarita" (editorial, Jan. 3) you focus, as you should, on the child's well-being by asking, "Does it make sense for a child who has lived with  [ the same ]  foster parents for seven years, almost her entire life, to be returned to her natural mother?" But your answer, "Perhaps not," is wrong.
You should have said: "Absolutely not."
Instead, you shift focus from Margarita's plight to the injustice done to her natural mother by the private and New York City agencies that had failed, as the law required, to encourage and help her establish a relationship with Margarita.
Your comment that "this case has no happy solution" obscures the fact that for Margarita there could and should have been a less detrimental outcome.


Sports of The Times; The Perils Of Life in Minneapolis
THEY have signs on some of the larger streets here that inform drivers that these are "Snow Emergency Routes." The signs draw a glance from the Super Bowl crowd beginning to stream in for next Sunday's game.
The signs in fact are not taken down even in summer.
I remember asking someone about this when I moved here in 1965.
"Remove them?" she said.
"For three days?"
This was kind of a joke, but you never know when it's going to snow in Minneapolis.
Last Halloween, just a couple of days after the World Series here, 28 inches fell.
So the people are prepared: like the hotel doorman who greets you in a raccoon hat and a raccoon coat; like those residents who sought to make the snowplow the offical pace car for the Super Bowl.


In Chill of the Night, the Homeless Change Habits
His bare feet jammed into high-top sneakers, James Murray stumbled out of his shack and into the 14-degree weather late Sunday night.
He would not have gone out at all, but charity workers were serving pea soup at his shantytown, an encampment on the Lower East Side built around a 20-foot canvas tepee.
Like others there -- and many of the city's homeless people -- he had only a few frosty words for the weather, the coldest in New York City this winter.


A Spiral Galaxy
Scientists say they have found the strongest evidence yet for a distant spiral galaxy in which one arm points in the opposite direction from the others.
The wrong-way "leading arm" extends counterclockwise from near the center, pointing in the presumed direction of the galaxy's rotation, while two "trailing" arms reach out clockwise, said Dr.
Ronald Buta, an author of the study.


Czechs by Millions Invest $35 in Big State Sale
Czechoslovakia has been swept up in a frenzy that can perhaps be described as gold fever.
Government offices across the country have been swamped as the deadline approaches for signing up for a virtual giveaway of a large chunk of the state-owned economy.
Under the program, known as "coupon privatization," the Government is about to divide ownership of roughly 40 percent of the economy among all citizens over 18 who register.
The cost of entry is 1,035 crowns, or about $35, a little more than a week's average wage in Czechoslovakia.


Mets and Magadan Meet Halfway
Feelings may still need to be mended, but the Mets and Dave Magadan yesterday did manage to end one significant difference of opinion when they agreed on a one-year contract for a figure that fell midway between their salary arbitration filings of last week.
Magadan, who was the Mets' first baseman for the last several seasons but lost his regular job to Eddie Murray during the off season, signed a deal for $1,393,750.
That represents a slight raise from his $1.25 million salary of last season.

Dibble, whose 31 saves were second in the National League last year, nearly tripled his $500,000 salary.
He will receive $1.4 million, halfway between the $1.8 million salary he sought and the $1 million the Reds submitted.


1992 CAMPAIGN: Endorsements; Elaborate Ritual Mates Candidates and Backers
Once every four years, people like Louis L. Goldstein, Joseph E. Gardner and Don Fraser migrate to the center of the political universe.
Governors call them at home.
Presidential candidates visit them at work.
Rich and powerful friends take them out to expensive meals.
All three have modest profiles on the national scene but considerable regional fame and popularity.
In a Presidential season, that makes them choice quarry for candidates hunting endorsements.


Chess
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign triumphed in the 1991 Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Championship, held at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago from Dec. 27 to 30.
The Illinois team scored 5 1/2- 1/2 to surpass 33 teams from Canada, Central America and the United States in the six-round, Swiss-system tournament.
The toughest hurdle the University of Illinois had to overcome was Brooklyn College, which took second place with a 5-1 score and which had the United States champion, Gata Kamsky, playing first board.
But Vivek Rao, Board 1 for Illinois, a graduate student in physics who starred for Harvard in its winning 1988-90 years, came through to upset his illustrious opponent.

The Children's Hour
In truth, it was not an hour but two, during which five would-be Presidents debated and polished their personas Sunday night on C-SPAN.
Under Cokie Roberts's courteous prodding, three of them -- Kerrey, Tsongas and Harkin -- were sharper than on a previous outing with Tom Brokaw.
Two of them -- Brown and Clinton -- gave warmth to previously sketchy impressions.
But for all five Democrats, it was the children's hour.
Maybe they're powered by a genuine desire to improve the lot of the most vulnerable of all Americans.
Maybe they're moved by pragmatism.
Either way, it's a hopeful change in politics that they, like President Bush, consider children high on the list of campaign issues.


Jailed Drug Cartel Chief Still Feared in Colombia
Seven months after Pablo Escobar, Colombia's most notorious drug trafficker, entered a luxury jail here, his word still inspires terror across the land.
One recent morning, Ariel Otero, a prominent leader of rightist death squads that killed suspected leftists, told reporters that Mr.

In revenge, Mr.
Otero said he planned to give the police documents and cassette tapes implicating the Medellin cocaine trafficker in a series of murders.

Critic's Notebook; Robert Shaw Magic: It's Based on Sweat
Sometimes a musical project proves so interesting and valuable that it survives its original purpose.
In November 1990, Carnegie Hall sponsored its first Professional Training Workshop as part of its centennial celebration.
Robert Shaw, the pre-eminent American choral conductor, was invited to lead the program, and more than 200 choral conductors, singers and music administrators came from all over the United States for five days of intensive work on Brahms's German Requiem, and a performance with the Orchestra of St.
Luke's.
It was evident both from the performance and from the videotapes of the training sessions that something special had happened.
Mr.
Shaw had taken a disparate group and transformed it almost overnight into a chorus disciplined and flexible enough to give a moving, persuasive performance of a towering work of the choral repertory.


Business and Health; Efforts to Reduce Retiree Costs
PUSHED by a new accounting rule, most large employers are examining ways to reduce the enormous future costs of medical benefits they have promised to retirees.
Benefits consultants say some executives view the benefits as a "gratuity" rather than a permanent obligation, when they are not detailed in an employment contract.
But most employers say they are committed to continuing the programs, albeit often with reduced benefits, despite rapid growth in both medical costs and the numbers of retirees.
Under an accounting rule that takes effect in 1993, corporations with at least 500 employees must calculate future retiree medical obligations and charge off the costs against income -- either all at once, or spread over 20 years.
The rule does not require setting aside cash for the future costs.


Bills Fans Overheat Buffalo (in January)
Cathy Jo Woloszyn spent a lonely 1991 Super Bowl on Manhattan's Upper East Side, desperately looking for a bar populated with Buffalo Bills fans.
Instead, the Buffalo native recalled, she found swarms of New York Giants fans, who cheered their team to victory over the Bills.
This year, she will be safely ensconced at the Buffalo Sports Garden, a sprawling warehouse-like bar and restaurant where 1,500 fans watched the American Football Conference championship game on more than two dozen 27-inch televisions (including several in the rest rooms) and three gargantuan screens as large as 23 feet.

Careers; Some Views On Job Loss By an Expert
WITH so many thousands of middle managers losing their jobs, the outplacement business should be booming.
But while business is good, it is not booming because companies dismissing large numbers of middle and top managers do not want to pay the costs.
Often they pay only for group sessions and other short-term guidance.
This means that older, higher-paid employees tend to be the ones these days whose companies provide full outplacement.


FOR SOUTH AFRICA, ONE STEP FORWARD
Negotiations on South Africa's future took a small but significant step forward today as representatives of 19 political parties and groups gathered to work out the first practical details for formal talks leading to a non-racist constitution.

Review/Dance; Stories Told in Movement and Talk
Irene Hultman is one of the best dancers around.
Her way of moving is a miraculous mix of simplicity and juiciness, of robustness and delicacy.
There is a blunt good humor to the way she presents herself and her resilient body to her audience, her round elf's face brimming with teasing, impudent cheer.
But there is also a miracle flow to her dancing, and a gift for deft and telling inflection as subtle as any music.
There was a good deal of Trisha Brown's slippery, continuous motion to what she danced on Saturday night at St.
Mark's Danspace, unsurprisingly, since Ms.
Hultman performed with Ms.
Brown for five years.
But Ms.
Hultman, who is Swedish, has made Ms.
Brown's style her own.
She began to speak to the audience as she moved through her 1988 "Solo Untitled," a piece without accompaniment that seems simultaneously both the raveling and unraveling of a dance.
"Yes, I should talk here," she said.
"But for some reason it feels inappropriate." She continued, however, the end of the dance coming when she announced that she had decided to stop talking.
By then, the casual, amiable monologue had begun to sound a little cute.
It didn't add much to the solo.
But there was the promise of Ms.
Hultman's dancing in the balance of the program.
And one could go on watching such a dancer with pleasure forever.

1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week; Debate Is Mere Tuneup On Democrats' Journey
Everybody had an angle in Sunday night's debate among the Democratic Presidential candidates.
Stirring political theater it certainly was not, but it gave some clues about what each of the five will be trying to do in the weeks ahead.
Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas portrayed himself as the tribune of the middle class.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts said his economic program was more highly regarded by experts than those of his rivals.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska talked a lot about health insurance.
Former Gov.
Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California rolled out a whole new tax plan.
And Senator Tom Harkin worked hard to justify his claim to be "the only real Democrat" in the lot.

Steinbrenner Helped to Pay for Lawsuit
Prohibited by agreement from suing the baseball commissioner himself, George Steinbrenner financially backed Leonard Kleinman's lawsuit against Fay Vincent by establishing a $250,000 escrow account for Kleinman's legal fees.
But Steinbrenner subsequently terminated the account, although not his financial support, because the lawyers threatened to sue him after he disputed their bills and refused to pay them.
Details of the $250,000 legal fund and the dispute with Kleinman's lawyers, including their threat to sue Steinbrenner for nonpayment, are included among 67 exhibits Vincent's lawyers filed in United States District Court in Manhattan last week as part of their effort to shortcircuit Kleinman's suit.

During his recent, botched flirtations with a return to coaching, Parcells was said to have three years left on his NBC contract to return as the analyst on "The N.F.L. Live" or step up to No. 1 game analyst.
The latter option appeared to gain immediacy last week when Bill Walsh, the top analyst, left NBC to coach the Stanford University football team.

Leslie H. Gelb is right ("Call Me Juror," A Look at the City, column, Jan. 10): the jury system does work, and jury service is often ennobling.
But his ridicule of the jury-selection process is wide of the mark.
Lawyers who know what they are doing can, through intelligent questions to individual prospective jurors, expose pernicious biases of which even the jurors themselves are unaware.
Too bad that Mr.
Gelb found voir dire tedious: it is often the most important stage in a trial.


U.S. Aide Rejects View From Japan on Illiteracy
A Department of Education official today denied the assertion of a senior Japanese politician that nearly a third of American workers cauld not read.
The official, Diane Ravitch, Assistant Secretary for the Office for Educational Research and Improvement, said that Yoshio Sakurauchi, the Speaker of Japan's lower house of Parliament, was not speaking from facts.


And We Call Ourselves Democrats?
Last summer, before I announced my candidacy for the Democratic Presidential nomination, it never occurred to me to worry whether the chairman of the Democratic National Committee in Washington or network executives in New York would like my message.
Instead, I worried whether millions of Americans would respond to a campaign calling for immediate measures to cut the military budget in half and use the funds to rebuild our country.
Fortunately, they did.
After several of my appearances on national television, positive reactions came in from every part of the country.
It seemed that a former mayor -- a liberal Democrat, from conservative Orange County, Calif., no less --
could
run for President.
This long-shot possibility was confirmed when my name appeared in several early polls, including a Gallup Poll in September.


New Show Spurs Debate On Old Issue
A TELEVISION program being offered to local stations around the country would combine elements of traditional talk shows with the buy-it-now sales pitches of home-shopping channels.
If it enters production this fall, the program would be the latest in a spate of new media ventures that blur the line between editorial content and advertising.
The hourlong daytime program, called "Day-to-Day Live," is being presented to station programmers this week in New Orleans, at the 29th annual convention of the National Association of Television Programming Executives.
Besides carrying conventional commercials, 12 minutes during each hour, as many as four of the seven segments in each show would feature guests who laced their interviews with pitches for merchandise like books, clothing or cosmetics.
Toll-free telephone numbers for ordering would flash onto the screen.


G.M.'s Gone, but This City's Alive
On Nov. 6, 1986, General Motors delivered a body blow to this city of 24,000.
To cut costs, the auto maker said it would close its 64-year-old plant here that assembled Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds.
Residents feared that G.M.'s departure would mean the end to life as Norwood had known it for generations.
G.M.'s taxes afforded this small city its independence from neighboring Cincinnati and spawned a wealth of services, including free paramedic services, and generous budgets that had allowed the city to buy a $750,000 incinerator and a $110,000 fire truck, both for cash.

Prudential Payment Ordered
The New York Stock Exchange has ordered Prudential Securities Inc. to pay more than $686,000 in damages to Anglo-American Financial, a private partnership that accused Prudential of fraud, breach of contract and misrepresentation in a 1988 transaction.
According to a document provided by the exchange yesterday, Anglo-American, which is based in New York, asserted that it was sold mortgage-related securities by Prudential, whose dealers failed to inform the buyer that the underlying mortgages were already in default.

So What's in the Cage? Excitement With Ears
THE excitement had built all week in the preschool class at the Wilton Family Y. The animal lady was coming, and she might bring real live animals.
Now kids know instinctively that no sane adult, especially teachers like Marcia Shushan and Maggie Schluntz, is ever going to suggest the exciting possibility of live animals unless they know darned well the creatures are coming.
No one, even after nap time, invites the volatile disappointment of a platoon of short people whose lifetime perspective is measured in months.
So the excitement of these 3- and 4-year-olds focused on exactly which animals were coming.
The teachers fanned all the flames of imagination -- well, almost all.
One boy's ominous suggestion about bears was squelched.
What animals this time?
The teachers feigned ignorance.
Could they touch them?
The teachers were certain.
Importantly, what were their names?
The teachers professed no knowledge.


Scientists Suggest Global Warming Could Hasten the Next Ice Age
IF global warming proceeds as forecast, it could cause the Northern Hemisphere's ice sheets to expand much as they did at the start of the last Ice Age, when the world's climate was slightly warmer than it is today, American and Canadian scientists say.
That possibility may seem to go against common sense.
But the scientists say the conditions that led to the last great glaciation could materialize again if the global climate warms significantly in the next few decades.

Environmental Hazards to Poor Gain New Focus at E.P.A.
An Environmental Protection Agency scientist in Chicago is putting the final touches on a computer program that can identify neighborhoods where childhood exposure to lead is likely to be rampant.
Corrective measures would be concentrated there -- most likely focusing the benefits on black children, who are known to suffer disproportionately from lead poisoning.
In California, the Federal agency sampled drinking water supplies at migrant labor camps last year and found 191 violations in water systems serving 8,500 farm workers in 20 counties.
Now the agency is working on enforcement actions, hoping to clean up the water without closing the camps and displacing the predominantly Hispanic workers.

Prague Has to Drive Fast in Economic Mud; Lustration Is Necessary
To the Editor:
"The Perils of 'Lustration' " (editorial, Jan. 7), criticizing the lustration process in Czechoslovakia where former Communist Party officials are banned from employment in high posts for five years, misreads the situation in my country.
You have assumed a stable country with a normal market economy, but neither of these conditions hold.
At all levels and in all sectors of society, former members of the Communist Party are employed, many of whom acted as agents of the notorious secret police.
In the current situation in Czechoslovakia, where the economy is dominated by state enterprises, they have enormous power.


Congress Returns Today To Fight Over Economy
Congressional leaders are predicting that they will kick out of the starting block when they return to work Tuesday, trying to overcome election-year partisanship and act quickly on a number of measures intended to stimulate the economy, like a tax cut for the middle class and an extension of unemployment benefits for the jobless.
The political discord of Presidential election years usually shackles Congressional action, but leaders say this year could be different, at least on tax policy, because the recession demands efforts to stimulate the economy.


George Carlin, Small but Amusing
All actors hunger for a role that allows them to stretch.
George Carlin landed one that requires him to shrink, all the way down to 18 inches.
As the magical Mr.
Conductor, he appears out of thin air to advise, amuse and tell stories about Thomas the Tank Engine to the children of "Shining Time Station," the children's series on PBS.
Mr.
Conductor's appearance is more surpising than young viewers could guess.
This is the same Mr.
Carlin whose most recent comedy album, "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics," offers the following notice: "This recording contains no backtracking or subliminal suggestions. All messages from the Devil are recorded clearly and audibly in standard American English."


Dispute Over a Dam on the Scenic Yangtze
THE Three Gorges Dam would be far from the highest ever built, but it certainly would be among the most controversial water projects in the world.
Vigorously criticized by environmental groups from as far away as Canada, the dam would submerge one of the Yangtze River's most scenic spots and it would require a huge expenditure that some argue could be better used elsewhere.
For backers, the primary argument for the project is not so much that it would generate electricity sorely needed for economic growth, but that it would aid in flood control.


Caracas Journal; Venezuela's Two-Faced Boom: Riches and Riots
High in a tinted glass office tower that rises from this city's valley floor, Venezuela's Planning Minister recently listed the statistical mileposts of his country's economic resurgence: a treasury brimming with foreign reserves, inflation at its lowest level in five years and an economy growing at the fastest rate in the Americas, 9.2 percent in 1991.
Seven miles up the valley, in the raw brick shantytown of Petare, two student leaders cited a different set of official statistics to describe the three-year-old presidency of Carlos Andres Perez: 5,000 street protests, with 2,068 ending in violence.

2 East German Guards Convicted Of Killing Man as He Fled to West
In a case that raised far-reaching political and moral questions, two former East German border guards were convicted today of having shot and killed a fleeing refugee in February 1989.
The verdict set a legal precedent, establishing that officials from what was once the Communist state of East Germany could be punished for actions that were not only legal under East German law, but which were compulsory for them to carry out.


Black Box: Out of Sight but Crucial
THE hard disk drive may be the most important component of a personal computer system, yet because it is usually out of sight it is often out of mind.
The little black (or silver) box seems pretty simple, but it holds nearly everything dear to the computer owner: all the important business reports and love letters and phone numbers and customer invoices and other data that make the world go round.
When the hard disk stops going round, or loses its memory, the rest of the computer is temporarily incapacitated.
In worst cases, hours, days or even years of work can be lost.


In Move to Spur Economy, Bush Is Urged to Order 90-Day Ban on New Federal Rules
President Bush's senior advisers have recommended that he stop all Government agencies from issuing new rules for three months as part of a broad campaign to revive the economy by reducing the burden of Federal regulation, White House officials said today.
The recommendation, most likely to be included in Mr.
Bush's State of the Union Message on Jan. 28, comes from Vice President Dan Quayle and other officials, including C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel; Richard G. Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.


New Cancer Clue: How Cells Talk To Each Other
SEVERAL times each day, a normal cell in the body mutates into a cancerous one but is knocked out by the body's defense mechanisms.
Occasionally, however, the mutant cells take hold and grow uncontrollably into a malignant tumor.
Uncontrolled growth is distinguishes cancerous cells from normal ones.
But precisely what goes awry in the cell and the defenses to permit the cancerous cells to take over is one of the great mysteries of science.


AID TO EX-SOVIETS IS BEING HINDERED
Two months after Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan announced a $165 million program to send free American food to what was then the Soviet Union, no food has been delivered and only one contract, worth $15 million, has been awarded.
And that contract, providing for deliveries of mostly butter to Armenia, will not be carried out until Feb. 20 because shipping companies refused to lease refrigerated air-freight containers for fear they would be stolen, said the Rev.
Yeznig Balian, who is supervising the delivery for the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, which is based in New York.


LIBYA IS EXPECTED TO GET U.N. DEMAND ON BOMB SUSPECTS
The United Nations Security Council is expected to serve Libya on Tuesday with a virtual demand that it hand over agents accused of blowing up Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988 or face the threat of economic sanctions.
The resolution also calls on Libya to cooperate with an investigation into the destruction of a French airliner over West Africa in 1989.

Home Health-Care Employees Reach Pact on Wage Increases
In a labor agreement likely to set the pace for publicly financed home health-care services in New York City, the union representing about 20,000 nurses' aides announced a tentative agreement yesterday with 28 private agencies on a 5 percent wage increase, from $5.90 to $6.20 an hour.
The agreement affects about a third of the 60,000 workers in New York City who are paid under the Medicaid program to care for elderly and disabled patients who are stable enough to be discharged from a hospital.
The number of home health-care workers has swelled in recent years as government agencies have tried to cut costs by moving people out of the hospitals and nursing homes.
Lump-Sum Payments
Union officials say the workers, many of them middle-aged women with much less clinical training than registered nurses or therapists, are among the lowest-paid employees in the health-care industry.


Books of The Times; Wanted: A Father, and a Cure for Love and Loss
The Lost Father  By Mona Simpson  506 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $22.
With her stunning first novel, "Anywhere but Here" (1987), Mona Simpson not only tackled some of the essential American myths -- a belief in the endless possibilities of progress and freedom, a belief in people's ability to reinvent themselves, tabula rasa -- but she also created a compelling family chronicle of love and hate, devotion and resentment.
Indeed, the mother and daughter in that story emerged as one of the most fiercely memorable such pairs to come along in years: Adele, the consummate con woman, vain, selfish, possessive and determined to subjugate all to her dreams; and her teen-age daughter, Ann, a strangely observant girl who emulates her mother's survival skills even as she yearns to escape her shabby world of self-delusion.

Northeast Gas Pipeline Ready But Critics Still Doubt Need
After a decade of planning and construction that has provoked fierce opposition from environmentalists, homeowners and oil executives, a major natural gas pipeline from Canada is to begin operation here this month, providing the largest single new source of energy to the New York region since the 1950's.
The pipeline, the Iroquois Gas Transmission System, has been the region's most contentious energy project since the failed Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, which is being dismantled 30 miles east of here.
The Iroquois pipeline, along with projects under way to expand pipelines from domestic oil and gas fields, would increase the capacity to pump natural gas to New York, New Jersey and New England by more than 50 percent.
Marketing Campaigns
With the Iroquois pipeline nearing completion, experts in the energy industry say it may lead to a historic shift in a region that is far more dependent on oil from the Middle East to heat its homes and fuel its power plants than other sections of the nation are.


Some Gifts to the Neediest Are in the Spirit of Protest
Most letters attached to contributions to the The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund recount personal experiences or insights that prompted the impulse to give.
But a few contributors are moved by larger forces, making donations in celebration of great political events or in protest of government policies.
"Times are hard, but you know priorities are skewed when we can somehow afford to fight useless wars in Panama and the Persian Gulf but cannot help 100,000 homeless people in New York and countless others in cities and towns across the U.S.," Katherine Manning of Manhattan wrote in a letter attached to her $300 contribution.
"Why doesn't the Government have a Neediest Cases fund?  It's not the answer, but right now private charity seems to be the only way to do the job the Government should be doing: helping the weakest among us so that we can say with pride that this is a country which takes care of its own."


Andrew Stein's Interests
City Council President Andrew Stein can't seem to keep his reasoning straight.
Originally he said he wouldn't participate in New York City's system of public campaign financing, designed to limit the influence of monied interests, because he couldn't justify spending taxpayer dollars on politics.
Now, set to challenge Mayor David Dinkins in 1993, Mr.
Stein adds, "I don't see why I should have one hand tied behind my back running against an incumbent."
In other words, Mr.
Stein wants all the money he can get for next year, and that could be quite a bundle.
Tickets to his fund-raising extravaganza tonight are between $1,500 and $5,000 each, and about 1,400 people are expected to join Frank Sinatra and other celebrities.
A single donor can sponsor a $50,000 table.
So Mr.
Stein will certainly raise lots of money.
He will also lose a chance to show moral leadership.

He has successfully calmed a worried Congress, and his personal ties to President Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady have brought him into the Administration's inner circle.

Many of the world's best partnerships were contending in the Netherlands during the weekend, but only two of them were in contention at the finish.

With one match remaining they led by two imps over the star Dutch pair, Enri Leufkens and Berry Westra.
They held on to win by exactly that margin, but the places would have been reversed if a good slam contract reached by the Dutch pair had succeeded.

Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
The endorsements, which were announced at a news conference in midtown Manhattan, gave Mr.
Clinton a political toehold in New York.
He plans to use this as a blueprint for assembling what he described as a broad-based effort to win mainstream and minority support in the April 7 New York primary.

Paris Showcase of Ukrainian Performing Arts
In his film "Meeting Venus," the Hungarian director Istvan Szabo used a Paris production of Wagner's "Tannhauser" as a metaphor for the quarreling cacophony of the new Europe.
"Ukraine in Paris," a five-month showcase of the performing arts from that newly independent country, which began here on Friday night, seems a kind of real-life echo of Mr.
Szabo's film, exposing the mixture of privation and pride, confusion and purpose that defines the Ukrainian intelligentsia in these unsure times.
The showcase, planned before independence but given a new weight by it, will consist of two opera productions this month by the Kiev Opera, several ballet programs by the Opera Ballet in February, performances by the National Ballet of Ukraine in March and April and by the Kiev branch of the Red Army Chorus (billed on some posters as the Ex-Red Army Chorus) in May.

Prosecutors Ask Removal Of Another Gotti Lawyer
On the eve of jury selection, the judge presiding over John Gotti's racketeering case in Brooklyn is considering a prosecution request to knock another defense lawyer out of the trial of the reputed Mafia leader and a defense countermove to disqualify a prosecutor.
The prosecutors have urged the judge to remove George L. Santangelo as a lawyer for Mr.
Gotti's co-defendant, Frank Locascio, contending there was evidence that he served as one of Mr.
Gotti's "house counsel" for the Gambino crime family.
Last July, prosecutors succeeded in removing three defense lawyers including Bruce Cutler, Mr.
Gotti's longtime lawyer.


Irradiated Food Coming, But Not Without Protest
After years of scientific debate and commercial hesitation, the first food irradiation plant in the nation now stands ready for service and could begin shipping specially treated fruit as early as next week.
Many scientists at universities and Federal agencies regard irradiation of food as a safe and efficient way to retard spoilage and kill organisms that cause illnesses like salmonellosis and diarrhea.
Investors in the plant hope that an initial scheduled shipment of irradiated strawberries will soon be followed by other fruits and vegetables and, eventually, poultry and seafood.

The railroad had raised the ire of people and political leaders in Long Island City by proposing to use the yard -- in the heart of a neighborhood where major commercial and residential redevelopment is planned -- to load up to 1,000 tons of trash into boxcars nightly.
The cars were to carry the garbage to landfills in the Midwest.

There is no job-placement office at the United States Military Academy at West Point, so leaders of the West Point Society, an alumni association in the New York area, decided last year that it was time to promote a little networking to help graduates with their job searches.

A Top Japanese Politician Calls U.S. Work Force Lazy
One of Japan's most senior politicians said over the weekend that America's economic troubles were rooted in a work force "too lazy" to compete with Japan, and argued that one of the biggest problems of the United States was that nearly a third of its workers "cannot even read."
The harshly worded assessment by Yoshio Sakurauchi, the 79-year-old Speaker of Japan's powerful lower house of Parliament, seemed bound to fuel the trans-Pacific arguments over the causes of America's trade and competitiveness difficulties with Japan.
Though Japanese politicians rarely speak publicly in such direct and confrontational terms about the United States, Mr.
Sakurauchi's comments seemed to amplify themes that have appeared in the Japanese press and on television since President Bush and his entourage of business executives left Japan 10 days ago.


China and Belarus Set Up Ties
China and Belarus have established diplomatic relations after the first visit to Beijing by a leader from the Commonwealth of Independent States, , the official Chinese newspaper reported today.
China Daily said that Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and Belarus Foreign Minister P. Kravchenko also agreed late Monday on a pact to promote trade and economic ties.
China now has diplomatic relations with eight of the 15 former Soviet republics: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.

Galapagos Mystery Solved: Fauna Evolved on Vanished Isle
TO biologists, the Galapagos Islands are very special places, not least because their distinctive wildlife prompted Darwin to hit upon the theory of evolution.
But the islands, off the coast of Ecuador, have long posed a troublesome evolutionary mystery: geologically, they are far too young for evolution, operating at its usual pace, to have produced the many unique life forms that now inhabit the islands.
A team of oceanographers and geologists has now happily resolved the mystery.
They have found evidence that the first plants and animals to colonize the Galapagos chain probably landed on ancient islands that are no longer visible because they long ago sank beneath the waves.
Their inhabitants were presumably forced to move on to the younger islands that exist today.


Winter Dreams
"It must be wonderful to be in New York now, with the snow falling and children sledding in Central Park," a young Australian said last month to a visitor from America.
"Yes, it is," the visitor replied.
Who was she to shatter his illusions?
The young man has never seen New York.
In truth, he's never seen much besides Sydney.
But he believes, because books and movies have told him so, that New York in winter is a place where blizzards rage and sleigh bells ring and sleepers are wakened by the scrape of snow shovels. .

Nationsbank Posts Loss After Merger
Nationsbank, the new name for the country's fourth-largest banking company, created by the year-end merger of the NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., and the C&amp;S/Sovran Corporation of Atlanta, said it had a $243.8 million loss in the fourth quarter and a profit of $201.8 million, or 76 cents a share, for all of 1991.
The loss, the bank said, was a result of its previously announced plans to lump various merger expenses into the final quarter of last year.
Nationsbank also said it expected to cut costs by $450 million annually as a result of a closer study of the merger plans, rather than $350 million as it had previously forecast.
The bank first, however, had to charge off $314 million of expenses in the fourth quarter for costs that included closing offices, combining computer systems and making severance payments to employees.

Heard of call-waiting?
Get ready for call-nagging.
The Southwestern Bell Corporation is testing a service in which an operator tries to deliver a recorded message every 30 minutes over a six-hour period to any telephone number that has a busy signal or does not answer after five rings.
The message can be up to three minutes long and the customer who records it can designate the best hours to try to deliver the message and when to stop trying.
The service, which costs $1.50 a message, is being tested in Oklahoma in the 405 area code.


Knicks Hold Off Pacers to Regain Peace of Mind
It was not pretty, nor was it particularly exciting.
But their victory yesterday was something the Knicks sorely needed.
Ending a losing streak at three games, New York (23-14) held the Indiana Pacers to 6 points and just one field goal during the final 6 minutes and pulled out a 105-97 victory in a Martin Luther King Day matinee at Madison Square Garden.


Prague Has to Drive Fast in Economic Mud; Ban Proven Agents
To the Editor:
"The Perils of 'Lustration' " (editorial, Jan. 7) finds fault with the process of lustration that citizens of Czechoslovakia are obliged to undergo as a condition of holding public office, because the process allegedly violates the legal principles of presumption of innocence and of individual, rather than group, responsibility.
The principle of presumed innocence does not apply, because the lustrations are not criminal processes but rather efforts to determine the fitness of individuals to hold public office, much like our confirmation hearings.
In any society, those who expect to hold positions of public trust are required to conform to a higher set of standards than is applied to the population at large.

Can a Symbol of Fiscal Aplomb Ever Retire?
In 1975, Felix G. Rohatyn was recruited from the lofty confines of investment banking to help rescue the city from its own excesses.
Mr.
Rohatyn quickly emerged as a household name.
Today, Mr.
Rohatyn is a frustrated gray eminence, an economic statesman whose vision is largely unfettered by a green eye shade and who understands the liabilities of a budget that meets legal definitions of balance but breaches the social contract.
His advice as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation is valued by an eclectic following that includes Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, congressmen, chairmen of multinational corporations and, among others, the Government of Kazakhstan.


Review/Fashion; Real Clothes Designed for Real Women
Adolfo opened his show at the Plaza last week with festive short black lace dresses embroidered with white braid and embedded with rhinestones.
Then he tied a long taffeta skirt in pastel colors or black over each dress.
It was clear that in his spring and summer show, he would be concerned with hemlines.
And so he was, but never in a banal way.
Following his success with calf-length culottes last season, he presented new warm-weather versions of the divided skirt.


Lebanese Says Israel Widens Its Army Zone
A prominent Shiite Muslim leader charged today that Israel had expanded the area it calls its security zone in southern Lebanon by adding a town to the zone.
"I can assert that the Israel Army has widened its occupation of southern Lebanon by adding the town of Rashaf to the security zone," Nabih Berri, a Minister Without Portfolio in the Lebanese Cabinet and leader of the mainline Shiite movement Amal, said at a news conference.
"This has happened despite the fact that the Lebanese Government has been engaged in peace negotiations with the Jewish state."

This Time, The Bills And Levy Are Ready
Last year, in his team's first appearance in the Super Bowl, Bills Coach Marv Levy skipped media day, one of the first mass press gatherings of the week, choosing to work on his game plan instead.
He was fined by the National Football League for that break with protocol.
Shortly after the team's plane arrived here tonight in advance of this Sunday's game against the Redskins, Levy did not make the same mistake.
Another year wiser, and with an additional week to work on the game plan this year, Levy showed up for the team's first news conference, kicking off a week of megahype that culminates with the game itself.


Net Up 9.9% At Raytheon
The Raytheon Company today reported a 9.9 percent increase in quarterly earnings, saying its diversity helped shield the company from a weak economy and military cuts.
Raytheon, a leading Government contractor, reported earnings of $157.8 million, or $2.37 a share, for the last three months of 1991.
That compared with profits of $143.6 million, or $2.20 a share, in the 1990 quarter.


A Graphics Program That Isn't Child's Play
DELTA Drawing Today is deceptively simple on the surface, a graphics program for children from preschool through third grade.
With it, a teacher or parent can help a child learn or discover simple and essential concepts, like right and left; fundamental shapes, like squares, rectangles, triangles and circles, as well as the rudiments of reading and writing and even the logic of programming.
And it's fun.
It was only the day before yesterday that it seemed anyone who wanted to be computer-literate would have to learn to program the machine.
That day is gone; commercial software is available for just about any task.
But programming, like plane geometry, teaches valuable lessons in itself, and these lessons have been part of education since the abacus was the only mechanical computer.
A book read long ago, and otherwise forgotten, called the computer "an abacus on amphetamines."


Oregon St. Player Who Had Stroke Dies
Earnest Killum, who decided to play basketball for Oregon State despite a blood-clotting disorder, died today, three days after suffering his second stroke in six months.

Dow Drops 10.95 in Quiet Holiday Trading
Stock prices pulled back a bit yesterday from last week's surge to a record, remaining in a fairly narrow range throughout the session.
Because of the holiday honoring the birthday of the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., trading was far quieter than last week's hectic pace.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 10.95 points to finish at 3,254.03.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 180.9 million shares, compared with 287.4 million on Friday, as losing issues outpaced those that gained by 947 to 759.
The Big Board's composite index was down 1.22 points, winding up at 229.67.

SHAMIR IS VOWING NEW SETTLEMENTS
In a direct challenge to Bush Administration calls for his Government to stop building settlements in occupied lands, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir declared defiantly today that "this construction will continue and no power in the world will prevent this construction."
His Finance Minister went a step further by saying that if the United States insisted on a settlement freeze as the price for $10 billion in American loan guarantees that Israel says it needs to absorb new Jewish immigrants, he would rather forgo the assistance, no matter what the economic consequences.


Chief's Woes Are a Trial for Detroit, Too
While this hard-luck city descended into the quicksand of crack and violence, Federal prosecutors say, the police Chief was stealing from a fund set up to fight drugs, funneling the money to phony corporations and setting up his mistress in an apartment in the suburbs.
The scandal will be laid bare and the city's wounds reopened in Federal District Court over the next few months as William L. Hart, the city's first black police chief, goes on trial on charges of embezzlement, conspiracy and obstruction of justice.
Opening arguments begin on Tuesday.

Watch Out for the Widening Ozone Hole
To the Editor:
It almost seemed like a cruel joke when I read "Broad Effort Under Way to Track Ozone Hole's Effects" (Science Times, Jan. 7).
You quote unnamed scientists as saying the dangers of intense ultraviolet radiation exposure are now under control but that the hazard is expected to increase sharply and that experts have begun the most comprehensive monitoring study of its kind.
It seems like a bitter joke because, faced as we are with a catastrophic change in a system that has been evolving for more than 3.5 billion years, there is no ground-based ultraviolet radiation monitoring system on earth!
There are a few scattered instruments that measure ultraviolet and they are located mostly where nothing much lives, like the South Pole.

Free Care for the Poor and Pregnant Comes on Wheels
It has been just over a year since a large white van began lumbering into some of the poorest sections of this city, offering free medical care to pregnant women who seldom see a doctor except on television and who see far more of their babies die than other American women.
With a death rate of 20.2 per 1,000 births, New Haven has the highest infant mortality rate of any city in the nation, according to the most recent calculations by the Children's Defense Fund, based on 1987 statistics.
New Haven's rate is twice that of the nation as a whole.


Cuomo Wants to Increase Tuition And Cut State Jobs and Medicaid
To close the gap of nearly $5 billion in next year's $31 billion budget, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo proposes authorizing sharp tuition increases at SUNY campuses, eliminating more than 5,000 state jobs, cutting Medicaid spending by about $1 billion and deferring more than $1 billion in tax cuts.
Most of the biggest elements of the plan, which the Democratic Governor is to present to the Legislature on Tuesday in his annual budget message, have been discussed for some time.
The tuition increases, of $200 at some campuses and up to $800 at others, were disclosed today by Cuomo administration aides.
If they are enacted, the cost of attending some State University schools will have doubled over the last two years.
Major Stumbling Block
In addition, the new budget would eliminate between 5,000 and 10,000 state jobs on top of the 20,000 cut in the last year.
It would also pay for about $500 million in borrowing that the state will likely have to undertake this spring because of the failure of the Governor and the Legislature to agree on any plan for closing the gap in budget for the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31.

SCIENTISTS have discovered the nasty tricks used by a virus that causes genital warts, and largely because of these discoveries the virus has emerged as the primary suspect in nearly all cervical cancer.

Giant Meteorite Blast Gouged a 30-Mile Trail
THE explosion of a giant meteorite as it grazed Earth less than 10,000 years ago gouged a 30-mile chain of elongated depressions in the Argentine pampas, scientists say.
The energy released by the meteorite, which was 500 to 1,000 feet in diameter, appears to have been equivalent to the explosion of 350 million tons of TNT.
This is 30 times larger than the energy believed to have been released in 1908 when a mysterious object exploded over Tunguska in Siberia with worldwide effects.


Flak Jackets Available For New York Jockeys
Flak jackets to protect jockeys in spills will be furnished to riders at New York's tracks, the New York Racing Association announced yesterday.
But the jackets, which are mandatory in England, will be optional with riders here and will count against the weight limit stipulated for each horse.
The jackets, sleeveless garmets worn under the rider's silk shirt, are already worn by some jockeys.
They cost between $150 and $200 and weigh about 1 1/2 pounds.
They will be made available in each rider's size at Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga, and extra jackets will be stocked in various sizes for visiting jockeys.
No Connection With Spill
The decision to purchase jackets was announced eight days after Angel Cordero Jr. was seriously injured in a four-horse spill at Aqueduct.
Cordero, 49 years old and the senior star at New York's tracks, suffered a broken arm, several cracked ribs and the loss of his spleen.
He is not expected to ride again for perhaps two months.

GAS PIPELINE SET TO OPEN
After a decade of planning and construction that has provoked fierce opposition from environmentalists, homeowners and oil executives, the Iroquois natural gas pipeline from Canada is to begin operation this month, providing the largest single new source of energy to the New York region since the 1950's.
With the pipeline nearing completion, experts in the energy industry say it may lead to a historic shift in a region that is far more dependent on oil from the Middle East to heat its homes and fuel its power plants than other sections of the nation are.

By Design; All-Weather Fabrics
This winter's weather has proved that "miracle" fibers are magic.
Last week, when one day was a balmy 62 degrees and the next was in the teens, a microfiber coat was the ideal solution.
Microfiber is the name for fabrics woven of polyester and nylon threads.
The finest weave feels like silky velvet, is lightweight and yet wears like iron.
A coat made of this is water repellent and warm as toast, yet porous enough to allow the garment to "breathe" when the thermometer climbs.

Daniel Saidenberg Faculty Recital Series
Juilliard Theater
Admirers of Rudolf Serkin's piano playing will be interested to know that the dogged forward logic that made his performances so deeply reputable was also invested in his early attempts at composition.
As a young man, Serkin not only played Schoenberg's music, but also studied theory with its composer.
Program notes for Thursday's faculty recital at the Juilliard School report that some of the late pianist's music was actually performed in Vienna in the 1920's, but that in ensuing years he destroyed what he thought was all of it.

Henry Stommel, 71, Theoretician Influential in Ocean Current Study
Henry M. Stommel, a leading theoretician on ocean currents, died Friday at the age of 71 at the New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.
His wife, Elizabeth Stommel, said he died of a heart attack after surgery for a liver tumor.
He lived in Woods Hole, Mass.
Although he never earned an advanced degree, Mr.
Stommel was considered one of the most influential oceanographers of his time.
He became known worldwide in the 1950's for his speculation on circulation in the Atlantic.
He recognized the role of the earth's rotation in pushing the Gulf Stream westward along the coast of North America and also proposed that its northward flow must be balanced by a deep, southward flow beneath it.
He proposed a global circulation in which surface water sinks in the far north, feeding the deep, south-flowing current, whereas water rises in the Antarctic, supplying a northward flow along the entire east coast of the Americas.


The Tiananmen in East Timor
What President Bush has called "the tragedy in East Timor" is finally eliciting more than ritual sympathy.
The former Portuguese colony was forcibly seized by Indonesia in 1975, an act comparable to Iraq's devouring Kuwait.
This was largely ignored until last Nov. 12, when Indonesian troops killed 50 Timorese at a wreath-laying ceremony for a slain youth, an act reminiscent of China's 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square.
Unable to ignore protests, Jakarta's military rulers ordered an inquiry.
They now acknowledge the 50 deaths, but say they resulted from a "spontaneous reaction by soldiers" provoked by mourners waving "anti-Indonesian" banners.
Numerous witnesses, including two American journalists, say the troops acted with cool deliberation.

After more than a year of study of the abundant record, William F. Buckley Jr., columnist, novelist, television host, lecturer and distinguished sailor, finally has delivered the judgment that Patrick Buchanan, Republican candidate for the Presidency, really has said "things about Jews" that are anti-Semitic.
For this discovery, part of a voyage for which he felt it his duty to skipper first his intellectual ship and now the readers of his magazine through 40,000 words, Mr.
Buckley is receiving the applause of those editorial writers, columnists and friends who had worried about him while he was pitching so far out at sea.


Ban on Muslim Political Party Expected in Algeria
The Algerian Government appears to be moving toward an official ban of the Islamic fundamentalist party as well as significant changes in the multiparty system that it has permitted since 1989, senior Algerian officials said today.

Market Place; Nasdaq at Night: Risky Trades in the Dark
The overnight trading of American stocks on Nasdaq began yesterday with a clear warning to brokers of the risks of global trading, as one trader apparently managed to sell shares in a small American company at an unrealistically high price.
While the losses to an unidentified market maker from that trade were small in total dollars, they served to highlight one risk of global trading, that of foreigners being blind-sided by local traders who often learn important information before overseas traders do.

Gov.
Jim Florio signed a legislative package today that mandates sweeping revisions in the welfare system, among other things making New Jersey the only state in the nation to deny additional payments to welfare mothers who have more children.
If they are approved by the Federal Government, the changes would remove any possible financial incentive for a welfare mother to have additional children.
They would also encourage family stability by allowing welfare mothers to marry without losing their benefits and reward employment by allowing them to earn as much as 50 percent of their total welfare payment without having their benefits cut.


Dinkins Bid to Put Gay Irish In Parade Spurned by Sponsor
An attempt by Mayor David N. Dinkins to assure a gay organization a place in the St.

Leaders of the New York State chapter of the Ancient Order of Hibernians said that they would follow the precedent set last year by the Manhattan chapter, the parade's traditional organizers, in barring the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization.
The national, state and Manhattan chapters all cited what theycharged was the group's outrageous behavior during the parade last year.
Assertions Are Denied
The state group's decision put the Mayor in the awkward position of having to deal again with the controversy.
It also raised the possibility that he had been outmaneuvered in his attempts to find a solution that would please the gay groups that are an important part of his political base without alienating Irish-American voters.
Mr.
Dinkins declined to say yesterday if he was surprised by the decision of the state Hibernians.
"We are still hopeful; we are still discussing things" was all he would say.


RESULTS PLUS
FIGURE SKATING  Russians Take Lead Yelena Bechke and Denis Petrov edged the defending champions, Natasha Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriev, in the original program to take the lead in the pairs competition yesterday as the European figure skating championships began at Lausanne, Switzerland.
The couples, both from St.
Petersburg, Russia, performed for the Commonwealth of Independent States, a name decided on after last-minute talks with international skating authorities.
Bechke and Petrov, runners-up last year, earned marks in the 5.6-5.8 range.
The maximum is 6.0.
The original program is worth one-third of the total mark.
The free skating takes place today and is worth the remainder.
At the competition draw Monday night, the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were officially welcomed back into the International Skating Union, 53 years after they were absorbed into the Soviet Union.

Defiant trailed by five seconds at the start, equivalent to about a boat length.
But the newer of the two America 3 yachts went on to win the sixth race of the series by 2 minutes 36 seconds. (AP)

New York Announces Plans For Executive Life Bailout
Insurance regulators in New York announced a rescue plan yesterday for the Executive Life Insurance Company of New York that should pay 100 cents on the dollar to the insurer's 118,000 customers.
But insurance professionals said the plan would make it impossible for customers to cash in their policies without incurring substantial penalties, known as surrender charges.
The professionals said that under the plan, which requires the approval of a New York State court, some customers would earn significantly lower interest on their policies and annuities than they had before Executive Life of New York and its sister company in California were seized by the respective state regulators last spring.
Both were units of the bankrupt First Executive Corporation of Los Angeles.


Economic Scene; The Economy Is In/Out of Woods
FORECASTING, the economic wits say, is difficult especially about the future.
But these days you can't even put much faith in descriptions of the present.
Depending on which professional is doing the appraisal, the American economy is now: A) Grinding slowly ahead for the third straight quarter but carrying such heavy regulatory and other burdens that the recovery is glacial; B) Turning down again after an aborted, post-Iraq recovery; C) Still gripped by a recession that is now the longest since World War II.


Shortage of Professors Is Envisioned
The nation could run short of researchers and college professors in the arts and sciences in the next several years unless graduate programs at American universities are strengthened by new financing and greater attention to students, according to a study on graduate education.
The heart of the problem is that the number of recipients of doctorates in the six areas covered by the study -- economics, English, history, mathematics, physics and political science -- has sharply declined in the last decade.
The doctoral degree is almost always a requirement for appointment as a professor or researcher.


New on the Laser Menu: Potato Skins, Well Done
A research lab in Ohio is using sophisticated laser technology in the service of one of the most mundane culinary tasks: peeling potatoes.

"You just see a little puff of vapor, and there is a naked potato," said Dr.
William McComis, Battelle's projects manager for food science and engineering.
"It's a fascinating thing to watch."


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY  IRISH GROUP BARS GAY MARCHERS
The state Irish group given responsibility by the Dinkins administration to take over the St.
Patrick's Day Parade has announced that it, too, will bar a gay Irish group from marching.
The move by the national and state boards of the Ancient Order of Hibernians comes two weeks after City Hall took away the parade permit from the Manhattan chapter and gave it to the state board -- an action that many had hoped would end the bitter two-year controversy over the presence of a gay group in the parade.

After months of fruitless bids to forge a unique long-term solution to New York State's chronic fiscal ills, Governor Cuomo reverted to the old way.

'Falsettos' Headed For Broadway, Not the Beaumont
"March of the Falsettos" and "Falsettoland" are coming to Broadway this spring, but it won't be the production everyone was expecting.
In a move that has taken much of the theater industry by surprise, Barry and Fran Weissler announced yesterday that they would produce the two William Finn one-act musicals, directed by James Lapine in late April, probably at the Golden Theater.
Andre Bishop, the new artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, had previously announced that he would be bringing the Hartford Stage production of "Falsettos," directed by Graciela Daniele, to the Vivian Beaumont Theater on April 27.

Recession Prompts First-Time Gifts as Neediest Cases Lead '91 Pace
"I have not donated money to the Neediest Cases fund before," Deborah Dorfman of Princeton, N.J., wrote, "but the need seems so great this year."
That simple note goes a long way toward explaining the remarkable success of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund this year.
The appeal, which continues through Feb. 29, has managed to surge $476,000 ahead of last year's pace in part because of a large increase in the number of first-time contributors like Ms.
Dorfman, who gave $50.
So far, almost 13,000 donors have contributed almost $4.4 million.

Orchestra Reaches Pact With Musicians
The New York Philharmonic and negotiators for its musicians reached a tentative agreement on Monday for a four-year contract.
The agreement provides for salary increases, an extension of the orchestra's current health benefits at a reduced cost to the players and a new arrangement to give the players a voice in running the orchestra.
It was presented to the musicians yesterday and they will vote on it today, spokesmen for both sides said.
The musicians' lawyer, I. Philip Sipser, described the proposal as "the best settlement I have seen in the 24 years I've been representing symphonic musicians." The Philharmonic's managing director, Deborah Borda, characterized the agreement as the kind that allows both sides to claim victory.

Texaco's Profit Down 16.5% in 4th Quarter
Texaco Inc., the first big oil company to announce fourth-quarter earnings, said yesterday that net income fell 16.5 percent because of lower prices for crude oil and natural gas and weak demand for gasoline, chemicals and other refined products.
Net income was $324 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with $388 million, or $1.40 a share, in the corresponding period a year ago.
Revenues for the company, based in White Plains, fell 24.9 percent, to $9.76 billion from $12.99 billion.

The Clinton strategy has produced early results in party organizations, bringing him endorsements from moderates like Gov.

He has also been endorsed by Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights pioneer, and Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi, the first black Congressman from that state since Reconstruction.

Improved Play of Blaylock Keeps Anderson on the Bench
When looking for reasons why Kenny Anderson, the team's No. 1 draft choice, is not getting more playing time with the Nets this season, those wondering point to Anderson's size, his age, his lack of National Basketball Association experience or some grudge between him and Coach Bill Fitch.

Los Angeles on Verge Of Ending Japanese Pact
Smoldering American resentment against Japanese economic competition has flared into a political firestorm in California, and Los Angeles County officials appeared today to be on the verge of canceling a $122 million contract they awarded just a month ago to a Japanese company to build rail cars for a new mass transit line here.
Instead, they proposed today to build a new factory to build the cars in Los Angeles County, providing jobs for a region deeply mired in recession and putting the county in direct competition with the Japanese.

Old Is New in the Treatment of Hypertension
To the Editor:
Your article on the role of dietary salt and other mineral elements in hypertension (Science Times, Dec. 31) goes a long way toward dispelling the misconceptions about salt that have plagued public perception, and in broadening our vision to include other mineral elements like calcium and magnesium.
Three other points deserve attention as well:
(1) As is so often true, we've really just rediscovered the wheel.
A Toronto physician, W. L. T. Addison, in articles written between 1924 and 1928, first documented the antihypertensive actions of both calcium and potassium supplementation in patients suffering from essential hypertension.
He further suggested that these minerals worked by offsetting the effects of salt.
His work was forgotten for more than 50 years, but his insights deserve to be remembered.

An Epidemic of Genital Warts Raises Concern but Not Alarm
ALTHOUGH 20 to 30 percent of sexually active Americans are infected with the virus that causes genital warts and though it is found in 85 percent or more of cancers of the cervix, doctors say the wart epidemic is cause for concern but not alarm.
Most abnormalities tied to the warts can be detected by routine Pap smears and removed, researchers say, and they are learning more and more about risk factors for developing cervical cancer and how to avoid them.

Book Notes
Endowing Free Speech
Thomas J. Peters, the author of three best-selling books about business, and his wife, Catherine S. Abbe, have donated a million dollars to the American Civil Liberties Union, to establish a fellowship to study and support the First Amendment.
The gift, which people in publishing and First Amendment advocacy said was one of the largest donations in support of the right to free speech, will be announced tonight at a reception at the Harvard Club in Manhattan.
The fellowship is named after William J. Brennan, the former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, because, said Mr.
Peters in a telephone interview, "No one in my lifetime has protected the precious and often precarious right to free speech in this country as vigorously as Justice Brennan."
In December, at a dinner given by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to honor Justice Brennan's commitment to the First Amendment, Salman Rushdie made an unannounced appearance, the first time he had traveled abroad or given a public speech since the Ayatollah Khomeini called his book "The Satanic Verses" blasphemous to Islam and ordered the writer's assassination.
The experience of Mr.
Rushdie, and the numerous attempts to suppress free speech that Mr.
Peters says he has seen in his travels around the world, which include stays in Argentina and China, prompted him and his wife to establish the million-dollar fellowship.
"It made me very aware of a right we so often take for granted, the right to speak and write freely, and that all the textbook reading doesn't bring home," said Mr.
Peters, who had previously donated 5 percent of the royalties from his most recent book, "Thriving on Chaos" (Alfred A. Knopf), to the A.C.L.U. for First Amendment projects.
He is also co-author of "In Search of Excellence" (Harper &amp; Row) and "Passion for Excellence" (Random House).
Tonight's reception is being jointly sponsored by Ira Glasser, executive director of the A.C.L.U.; Alberto Vitale, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Random House, and Sonny Mehta, president and editor in chief of Knopf.
Mr.
Peters acknowledged that books like his, about business and organization, do not usually test people's tolerance.
But he said he thought the fellowship was needed because "free speech is only innocent when we zealously protect not only stuff that is not controversial but stuff we may find offensive." The Power of the Airwaves
It looked like the season was almost over for Brendan Boyd, whose first novel, "Blue Ruin," was published in September by W. W. Norton.
The book, a fictitious account of the motivations behind the actual fixing of the 1919 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and the Cincinnati Reds, had done modestly at the book stores.
It's your first time at bat, the publisher told the writer.
It's a solid single.
You'll do better next time.
Then Mr.
Boyd did an interview on National Public Radio's "Morning Edition," and suddenly the game wasn't quite over.
Sales of the book started picking up across the country.
Bookstore owners started calling wholesale distributors for refills and the book popped onto the best-seller lists of Ingram and of Baker &amp; Taylor, two of the biggest wholesalers in the country.
NPR has apparently become a priceless promotional opportunity for authors.
An interview or a review on any of the three main programs -- "Morning Edition," "All Things Considered" and "Weekend Edition" -- practically assures a rise in sales.
Mr.
Boyd was interviewed and given a rave review by Bill Littlefield, a sports commentator, on "Morning Edition" on Dec. 19, "and within two days, the book was zooming, after it had basically been doing modestly until then," said Bill Rusin, director of sales and marketing for Norton.
"That interview pretty much doubled the rate of sales."
John Cunningham, Baker &amp; Taylor's director of merchandising for juvenile and trade books, said "Blue Ruin" was registering quiet sales, many of them to libraries, when "suddenly it went berserk," going from unranked to the No. 7 fiction best seller.
"No doubt about it, NPR has become a real force for selling books," Mr.
Cunningham said.
"We see it all the time. They have the demographics in their audience and they have serious book buyers who listen to them."
People who work for the three shows say that given the deluge of books they receive each day, the power of the shows is obviously no longer an inside secret shared by few.
The decision to interview an author or review a book is made mostly by the various hosts and commentators, whose tastes are described by members of their staff as "wildly eclectic."
"I can't say there are particular criteria for getting a book on," said Brigid McCarthy, editorial assistant for "Morning Edition." "It's whatever seems to give an added dimension to a news event, or something completely off the news, or a new writer, or an established writer. There's no way to know what will get chosen."
An author who can't get on NPR, however, need not despair.
Mr.
Cunningham of Baker &amp; Taylor said there was one other show that he had seen push sales of a book: the morning television program "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee."

Chrysler Raises Prices by 0.6%

The four-wheel-drive Grand Cherokee's base price of $19,857, plus a $485 destination charge, reflects a two-tier pricing strategy aimed at luring customers away from the Ford Motor Company's popular Explorer utility vehicle, which starts at $19,395, plus a $485 destination charge.

Will Women Runners Overtake Men?
To the Editor:
The recent study by University of California researcher predicting that female runners may one day run faster than the best male runners ("2 Experts Say Women Who Run May Overtake Men," Science Times, Jan. 7) is limited by its reliance on linear extrapolation in the prediction of future performance.
While the rate of improvement in women's performance has exceeded that of men since the 1920's, little evidence suggests that this trend would continue to the point where women overtake men.
Taken alone, linear extrapolation of past trends can give unrealistic results.
For example, based on an extrapolation of its population growth from 1940 to 1990, California would in the year 2040 have a population comparable to present-day France.


Stronger Family Tie Seen in Suicide
ONE out of every four people who attempt suicide has a family member who also tried to commit suicide, a study sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health has found.
The number is higher than previous estimates.

The new study involved 2,304 Los Angeles residents; the earlier estimates were based on interviews with mental patients and their families.

A Drama That Will Rival the Ring When Tyson Faces His Accuser
No fighter since the days of Muhammad Ali has been dissected and inspected quite the way Mike Tyson has.
At age 25 he has been one of those public figures who fascinate the masses and command constant attention.
While some of that has had to do with the primal aggression Tyson showed in becoming the youngest heavyweight champion ever, as much curiosity has focused on Tyson's personal life and problems outside the ring.
There, as his own worst enemy, Tyson has sometimes seemed on the verge of short-circuiting that glorious career as a fighter.


Japan Tries Damage Control
The Government today raced to contain the damage in the United States after one of Japan's top politicians called American workers illiterate and lazy, saying the Government did not share his views and then contending that he had been misinterpreted.
The effort to counteract the comments by Yoshio Sakurauchi, the Speaker of the lower house of Parliament, came amid growing Japanese fears of a backlash in the American Congress.
Several officials said Mr.
Sakurauchi's comments could not have come at a worse time, adding to the arguments over access to Japanese markets and the causes of America's industrial woes.

U.S. IS CRITICIZED ON AID TO RUSSIA
The 47-nation conference on coordinating aid to the former Soviet Union opens at the State Department on Wednesday, with a host of tensions between the United States and its allies bubbling just beneath the surface over how best to help Russia and the other republics, officials and experts involved say.
At issue are both clashing egos and clashing policies.
Many European officials, who were not consulted about the conference before it was announced, say they resent the leadership role being taken by the United States, which some of them argue is an effort to disguise how little Washington is actually doing.
No longer feeling the need for Washington's security umbrella after the demise of the Soviet Union, the Europeans are increasingly speaking their mind.


Riley Fined For Comments On Officiating
Knicks Coach Pat Riley has been fined $2,500 for criticizing the officiating after last Saturday night's game, the National Basketball Association announced yesterday.
After New York's 108-106 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Riley was very angry about the officiating, not only in that game but also in Knicks' games during the last three weeks as well.


Review/Music; Bilson and Bylsma In a Lighthearted Mood
Before beginning to play a sonata with the cellist Anner Bylsma at Merkin Concert Hall on Monday night, Malcolm Bilson spoke briefly about his instrument, a fortepiano built by Alois Graff in Vienna in 1825.
It had six pedals.
Three were unremarkable: one raised the dampers, allowing sustained tones; one resembled the una corda pedal on the modern piano, allowing a softer sound and different timbre; another inserted a piece of cloth between hammer and strings, muting the impact.
The others, Mr.
Bilson explained, were "noisemakers." He pressed one: it sounded as if a drum were being struck with a great stick, accompanied by the jangling of strings.
"I have not yet found a piece," he commented, "in which it is particularly appropriate."


An Epidemic of Genital Warts Raises Concern but Not Alarm
ALTHOUGH 20 to 30 percent of sexually active Americans are infected with the virus that causes genital warts and though it is found in 85 percent or more of cancers of the cervix, doctors say the wart epidemic is cause for concern but not alarm.
Most abnormalities tied to the warts can be detected by routine Pap smears and removed, researchers say, and they are learning more and more about risk factors for developing cervical cancer and how to avoid them.


Whites Defy Pretoria's 'White' Draft
The repeal last year of South Africa's bedrock laws enforcing apartheid has left the Government with a quandary bedeviling its armed forces.
Military conscription has long been compulsory for young white men, who under the Defense Act must serve a year on active duty followed by reserve call-ups.
President F. W. de Klerk cut the initial tour in half, from two years, in December 1989.


Japanese Trade Surplus Surged Last Year
Japan's trade surplus has reversed course after a three-year decline, surging by 50 percent in 1991, the Government said today.
The announcement is likely to fan increasing resentment in the United States and other nations upset because the surplus, they say, stems from Japan's adherence to unfair trade policies.
The Finance Ministry said that for the year, Japan sold $78.23 billion more goods overseas than it imported, compared with a $52.15 billion surplus in 1990.
These preliminary figures were for what is called the customs-cleared trade surplus.
The Government will later announce broader figures that include a variety of other costs of conducting trade, like transportation and insurance.
Those inclusive figures are generally cited by economists when they discuss trade imbalances.

Files to Be Opened, From Lenin to Gorbachev
The first batch of millions of secret documents culled from the Communist Party's archives in Moscow are to be released this fall, beginning with the files collected by the party on major leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution, a British publishing company said today.
Among the reams of material, to be made available on microfilm, are personal correspondence, police reports and biographical details meticulously collected by party archivists on Leon Trotsky, Vyacheslav M. Molotov, Andrei A. Zhdanov and other key members of Lenin's inner circle, said officials of Chadwyck-Healey of Cambridge, England, a publisher of university and research databases.


G.E. Net Up by 2% In Quarter
Helped by continued strength in financial services, the General Electric Company said yesterday that profits in the last three months of 1991 edged up 2 percent, to more than $1.26 billion.
It also cited growth in businesses where products are ordered many months or even years in advance, like medical equipment, power systems and aircraft engines.
The double-digit profits in these businesses compensated for sharp declines at the company's NBC broadcasting subsidiary and in the economically sensitive materials group, which supplies products like plastics to a wide range of industries.


Riley Says Things Will Get Better
Asked today if the Knicks had overachieved in winning 17 of their first 27 games, Pat Riley did not evade the question.
"We probably were overachieving," the Knicks' coach said.
"We were winning on a lot on emotion and hard work. Now the freshness has worn off and the routine sets in, so you have to deal with that.

Uncovered Short Sales Decline 0.7% on Big Board
The New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short and not yet covered fell for monthlong period ended Jan. 15 by 55 million, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 729.4 million.
The new total is equal to about seven-tenths of 1 percent of all shares listed on the Big Board.
The decline reversed December's slight increase in uncovered short positions.

Review/Television; Some Loners Struggle With Love and Survival
The small circle of truly significant American film makers, among them Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen, may be gearing up to admit some new members.
One candidate is Gus Van Zant ("Drugstore Cowboy").
Another is Hal Hartley, whose "Surviving Desire," his first work done expressly for television, is being broadcast tonight on "American Playhouse" (Channel 13 at 9).
As an independent director and writer, the 31-year-old Mr.
Hartley has been steadily refining his distinctive imprint, most notably in the feature films "The Unbelievable Truth" (1989) and "Trust" (1991).
Coming out of Lindenhurst, L. I., he is a graduate of the State University College at Purchase, where he developed a mania for reading movie scripts.
The urge to write and film his own became only a matter of time.

1992 CAMPAIGN: Washington Memo; Senate Jousting Is a Lesson in 'Bipartisan' Debate
The 1992 election campaign arrived on Capitol Hill today, as senators called for bipartisan efforts to solve national problems and then split on party lines over education legislation.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said, "The needs of the nation are not partisan." Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said Americans would reject "the same old partisan posturing, political games and Congressional gridlock."

CHRONICLE
You
can
go home again if you are a Supreme Court justice.
THURGOOD MARSHALL, the 83-year-old former Associate Justice, returned yesterday to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, where he had served in the 1960's.
Along with Judge JON O. NEWMAN and Judge AMALYA L. KEARSE, Justice Marshall heard arguments in four cases.
He is expected to sit on the court again tomorrow, when a case involving the Rev.
AL SHARPTON is on the docket.
Why is the Justice serving on the appeals court?
He refused to say, and no one else seemed to know.
"I'm not sure I know how this happened," said Judge Newman, who welcomed Justice Marshall back "from extended service elsewhere." Justice Marshall served 24 years on the Supreme Court after his appointment in 1967.
He said that New York had gone "straight down the hill," but defended Mayor DAVID N. DINKINS with the observation that "every city is in trouble and nobody's got any answers yet."


Personal Health
THE side effects of chemotherapy have become a fact of life for millions of Americans as cancer researchers continue to demonstrate the life-saving potential of an ever-growing list of cell-killing drugs.
For many cancer patients who feel relatively well at the time their disease is discovered, the nausea and vomiting, hair loss, fatigue and other debilitating symptoms often associated with chemotherapy can make the treatment seem far worse than the disease, at least in cancer's early stages.
For some, the side effects of cancer-fighting drugs are so distressing that they abandon the therapy and, in doing so, often sacrifice their only chance for a lasting cure.


Women's Liberty, on the Line
"Has the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, holding that a woman's right to choose abortion is a fundamental right protected by the United States Constitution?" Abortion rights advocates put that question to the Court in seeking review of Pennsylvania's anti-abortion laws.
In granting review yesterday, the justices rephrased the question in less dramatic terms, but the liberty of women is on the line just the same.
The Court has agreed to consider whether states may force a woman, on pain of prosecution for lying, to sign a statement that she has notified her husband of her decision to seek an abortion.
And whether states may require doctors to issue discouraging warnings to women considering abortion, force them to undergo special waiting periods and require minors to obtain a parent's consent or a court order before terminating a pregnancy.


Wisconsin District to Assign Pupils On Basis of Income to Disperse Poor
Amid much debate, the La Crosse school district next fall will become the first in the nation to use family income as the criterion for assigning elementary students to schools.
The plan is designed to break up a large concentration of poor students in just two of the district's nine elementary schools.
By dispersing both poor and affluent students more evenly, administrators said they hoped to address several issues, including reducing the stress of teachers who work primarily with the poor, enhancing the education of poor children and exposing all students to a greater cross section of classmates.

Real Estate; Girl Scouts Come to Aid Of Developer
BEATEN UP and scarred, in the words of its own consultant, the Hammerson Property Investment and Development Corporation was on the verge of quitting New York City when it was rescued by the Girl Scouts.
On Dec. 31, the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. paid $24 million for a 171,000-square-foot office condominium and a 3,800-square-foot retail condominium in Hammerson's 420 Fifth Avenue tower, between 37th and 38th Streets.
This is to become the national headquarters of the Girl Scouts by July.


Here's a Way To Fight Japan
The Congress will soon be asked to cut taxes to combat the recession.
Cuts for the middle class would be fair and might encourage more consumer spending.
But the economy needs more than a quick fix -- an extra $300 in every middle class family's bank account.
It needs a large-scale, aggressive, long-term Government-business partnership for growth.
People worry that the recession is not just another cyclical slide from which we will bounce back.
They fear, correctly, that unless America takes fundamental action, we will never improve our living standard.
We will keep slipping because of our social and economic weaknesses and the strengths of our European and Asian competitors.

Metropolitan Diary
DEAR Diary:
Some of the most remarkable comments on life as it is lived in New York, I have found, can be tuned in on subway station elevators.
Consider the conversation overheard while ascending to the IRT line at the Park Place station one recent Monday morning.
My brain still not unclogged from the weekend, I heard a young man and woman sharing their experiences of chatty "morning" people.
It was obvious that, along with me, they dislike those who wake up with hearts and voices aflutter.
So I had to smile when the fellow said: "You know, I really
am
lucky. I'm terribly sullen in the morning and my wife is very sullen, too."


Broad Outline Described For a Milken Settlement

If successful, the negotiations would settle billions of dollars of claims filed against Mr.
Milken and his former colleagues by savings and loan regulatory agencies, by some states and by many institutional and individual investors.

Review/Film; Spoofing the Horror Genre
Mike (Craig Peck), the main character in Rolfe Kanefsky's "There's Nothing Out There," which opens today at the Eighth Street Playhouse, has seen too many horror movies.
He's seen so many that he can barely go on a weekend trip to a remote house in a lonely wooded setting without getting very, very nervous.
Vacationing with three nubile young couples (among whom skinnydipping is the sport of choice), Mike complains constantly about the sheer "Friday the 13th"-ness of the whole enterprise.
"I have rented out every single horror film on videotape, and what we've just gone through is called a warning stage," he insists, when the group finds an abandoned car in the woods.

HIGH COURT TAKES PENNSYLVANIA CASE ON ABORTION RIGHT
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether a Pennsylvania law that restricts access to abortion is constitutional, an action that virtually insures a ruling on the politically explosive abortion issue by early summer of this Presidential election year.
It is by no means certain that the Justices will use the case as a vehicle for overruling Roe v.
Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
That step is among several options available to the Court, whose support for Roe v.
Wade was already paper thin even before President Bush's two Supreme Court appointees replaced two of the Court's strongest supporters of abortion rights.
One More Worry for Bush
Leaders of abortion rights groups had sought an early ruling from the Court in the belief that the case could prove a political liability for Mr.
Bush.
The prospect of a decision this term does provide one more worrisome variable for the President's re-election campaign.  [ News analysis, page A17. ]
"The Court has helped us today by intensifying the threat and making the issue real for people," said Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
"There's no question that abortion will be a major issue in the election."
Several Republican strategists agreed privately today that the case handed the Bush Administration a political problem.
One said a Supreme Court ruling cutting back on the right to abortion would insure a divisive fight at the Republican National Convention over the party platform, which now has a strong anti-abortion plank. 19th Anniversary of Ruling
Publicly, Republican advisers sought to minimize the impact of the case.
Abortion "is never going to be a decisive issue in a Presidential campaign," said Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign.
The Court's action came on the eve of the 19th anniversary of the Roe v.
Wade decision, and events outside the Court underscored the ferocity of the emotions the decision still engenders.
More than 350 anti-abortion protesters were arrested in Washington today for trying to block patients' access to two downtown abortion clinics.
On Wednesday, the actual anniversary, abortion opponents will hold their annual march, and advocates of the right to choose abortion will hold a rally.
The Pennsylvania case presents a constitutional challenge to a state law that, while not prohibiting abortion, seeks to limit access to the procedure through a variety of regulations.
These include a 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that married women notify their husbands if they are planning to have an abortion.
The Court is likely to uphold some or all of the regulations, several of which are nearly identical to those the Court has struck down in other cases in the last decade.
The result of such a ruling would be to leave Roe v.
Wade substantially weakened, and would give states increased latitude to regulate abortions in ways that make the procedure difficult to obtain for women lacking in financial or emotional resources.
But the decision, which is expected by late June or early July, will not necessarily indicate how the Court would rule on a law that makes abortion a crime.
Legal challenges to abortion prohibitions recently enacted in Louisiana, Utah and the territory of Guam are now in the lower Federal courts, and will probably reach the Supreme Court within the next year.
Because the Pennsylvania case appeared likely to reach the Supreme Court first, it has been closely monitored by all sides in the abortion debate.
The state regulations, adopted in 1988 and 1989, were challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America on behalf of several abortion clinics in the state.
Federal District Judge Daniel H. Huyett 3d, who was named to the bench by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970, declared the regulations unconstitutional in a 1990 opinion that was largely overturned last Oct. 21 by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia.
The appellate court upheld most of the regulations, including an "informed consent" provision that requires doctors to wait 24 hours before performing abortions on women, to whom they must first provide information intended to discourage them from going through with the procedure.
Although the Supreme Court has twice struck down a similar regulation, the appellate court interpreted more recent High Court rulings, specifically the 1989 decision in a Missouri case, Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services, as a substantial retreat from the searching scrutiny to which the Court had previously subjected all abortion regulations.
In the Webster case, the Court upheld state regulations that included a ban on abortions in public hospitals.
But the appellate court struck down a provision of the Pennsylvania law requiring married women to notify their husbands of their decision to get an abortion.
Under the law, women who falsely certify that they have provided the required notice face a penalty of up to a year in jail.
The appeals court ruled that this provision was the type of "undue burden" on the right to abortion that the Webster decision indicated the Supreme Court would find unacceptable.
Even if the Third Circuit's interpretation of the Webster decision was correct, that decision may no longer reflect the Supreme Court's view.
The Webster ruling was a split decision in which four Justices -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy -- indicated they were prepared to overturn Roe v.
Wade.
Four others -- Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun -- indicated their strong continued support for Roe v.
Wade.
In the middle was Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who put forward her own analysis calling for abortion regulations to be scrutinized on a kind of sliding scale, depending on the degree of burden they placed on access to abortion.
Only those regulations creating an "undue burden" would be subject to the strictest constitutional scrutiny, requiring the state to justify them by demonstrating a "compelling state interest."  New Faces on the Court
In its decision last October the Third Circuit declared that Justice O'Connor's analysis was "the law of the land." Since the Webster decision, however, Justices Brennan and Marshall have retired and the balance may well have shifted.
Neither of their replacements, Justices David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas, has yet voted in an abortion case.
The vote of either could determine the outcome in this case.
Both sides in the case sought a quick Supreme Court review of the Third Circuit's decision.
There was little doubt that the Court would agree to hear the case; the only question was whether they would do so on a schedule that permitted a decision before the Presidential election next November.
That result is highly likely.
The case will be argued in April.
Only in the event that the Court reaches a deadlock and needs to hear further argument next fall would the Justices not decide the case by the time the current term ends in late June or early July.
Lawyers for the abortion rights groups who appealed the Pennsylvania case to the Supreme Court have sought to use the case as ammunition in a wider political war.
Expecting to lose in the Court in any event, the abortion rights groups want to use a defeat to mobilize public support for passage of Federal legislation that would guarantee the right to abortion and prohibit the states from imposing restrictions.
Hundreds Cross Police Lines
The Supreme Court's announcement that it would hear the Pennsylvania case came as hundreds of chanting, hymn-singing anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested after crossing police barriers that cordoned off the entrances to the Washington Surgi-Clinic and the nearby Capitol Women's Center in downtown Washington.
At each clinic, hundreds of abortion rights advocates linked arms in a counterprotest, forming a human chain to prevent anti-abortion demonstrators from approaching the building.
Randall A. Terry, who led the Operation Rescue blockades in Wichita, Kan., last summer, said in a telephone interview that he was pleased with today's results.
"We were able to close down the abortion facilities for several hours," he said, "and hopefully, we saved some childrens' lives."
Leaders of the Washington Area Clinic Defense Task Force, which organized the counterprotest, also declared their actions successful.
"As far as I know, no patients were turned away," said Gina Roccanova, a spokeswoman for the the group.


3 Students Are Stabbed In Brooklyn
Three students were stabbed yesterday outside their Brooklyn high school, leaving one of them in critical condition, the police said.
The stabbings occurred as students were leaving Thomas Jefferson High School in the East New York section about 2:35 yesterday afternoon.
A "large group, not a gang," comprising "a couple dozen" youths who did not attend the school, had gathered near the main entrance at 400 Pennsylvania Avenue, said Lieut.
Kevin Perham, commander of the 75th Precinct Detective Squad.


Review/Television; About Canada, 5 Programs' Worth
Given the standard American attitude toward Canada, something between indifference and unconsciousness, it is an act of daring for "Firing Line" to devote five programs to the country.
The first two offerings of "Canada on the Firing Line" -- one on the environment and one on the condition of women -- have already demonstrated their relevance to concerns south of the Canadian border.
And tonight, at 10 on Channel 31, and Saturday at 10 A.M. on Channel 13, William F. Buckley Jr., conservative, takes on Bob Rae, the socialist Premier of Ontario, in an amiable debate.
Pressed by Mr.
Buckley to explain how the Canadian version of socialism differs from other brands, Mr.
Rae emphasizes what he calls communitarian values and a commitment to democracy.
Mr.
Buckley, in a twitting mood, observes that the explanation seems like "more Raeism than socialism."


SPENDING CUTBACKS OUTLINED BY CUOMO TO BALANCE BUDGET
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, rebuffed in bids to forge a long-term solution to New York State's chronic fiscal ills, presented the Legislature today with a more traditional approach that would pare spending on nearly all local-aid and state programs in his 1992-93 state budget.
He pleaded with lawmakers to pass the budget by April 1, the statutory deadline that he and they have failed to meet in each of the last seven years.


A Drama That Will Rival the Ring When Tyson Faces His Accuser
No fighter since the days of Muhammad Ali has been dissected and inspected quite the way Mike Tyson has.
At age 25 he has been one of those public figures who fascinate the masses and command constant attention.
While some of that has had to do with the primal aggression Tyson showed in becoming the youngest heavyweight champion ever, as much curiosity has focused on Tyson's personal life and problems outside the ring.
There, as his own worst enemy, Tyson has sometimes seemed on the verge of short-circuiting that glorious career as a fighter.


Cuomo Budget Cuts May Open New Gaps for Municipalities
New York City officials said today that the cuts Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo proposed in his budget would create a city budget shortfall of between $100 million and $120 million in 1992, costing the city hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to schools, health care and other social services over the next two years.
The city has already closed a $210 million gap in the fiscal 1992 budget of $29 billion.
For the 1993 fiscal year, which begins this July, the state cuts would increase the city's budget gap, already estimated at $1.6 billion, by between $300 million and $350 million, city officials said.

I.R.S. Drops LYON Case
The Internal Revenue Service has abandoned its effort to block companies from using the tax advantages of a popular financing tool, zero-coupon convertible bonds, which companies have used to raise more than $11.5 billion in capital.
The I.R.S. challenge to the tax status of the securities, most commonly known as liquid-yield option notes, or LYON's, became public in late November when Tate &amp; Lyle P.L.C. filed an appeal in the Tax Court.
The I.R.S. claimed that because companies might never pay the interest on such notes in cash, they could not deduct the interest expense from taxes until it was actually paid.


No Time to Be Stingy With Russia
Western Foreign Ministers gathering today in Washington need to concentrate on one urgent task: arranging a substantial transfusion of aid to Russia and a beleaguered Boris Yeltsin.
Europeans, especially Germany, have been quick to act.
The U.S. by contrast has been slow and stingy, in part because foreign aid is politically unpopular.
But without more aid, Russia could slip back into autocracy.

Sports of The Times; Old Vikings Remember The 4 Losses
THERE is a school of thought that the Giants won their two Super Bowls and the Jets won their only Super Bowl out of a cynical insight into the unforgiving and unforgetting mind of New York football fans, who boo the first time their team goes third-and-long.
The Giants and the Jets did not dare lose.
By the same token, the polite stoicism of the Upper Midwest, where people understand they will pay for a few days of sunshine with a month of harsh weather, helped people deal with the Vikings losing all four of their Super Bowls.


Ruling Favors Taxes In Indian Properties
New York State won a victory in the Supreme Court today in its long-running effort to collect taxes on cigarettes and other goods sold on Indian reservations to non-Indian customers.
In a unanimous order, the Justices set aside a state appellate court decision invalidating a state plan to collect cigarette taxes from the non-Indian wholesalers who provide cigarettes to the Indian retailers.
While the state court could reinstate its ruling after the reconsideration that the Justices ordered today, that result is unlikely.

Attica Judge to Trim Vacation
The judge in the Attica trial yesterday bowed to the wishes of his judicial superior and agreed to cut short his Caribbean vacation to preside over jury deliberations in Buffalo.
The judge, John T. Elfvin, had said last Wednesday before flying to Barbados that the nine-member jury could deliver its verdicts to a magistrate presiding in his absence.
But yesterday he agreed to return to his Buffalo courtroom two and a half weeks early after several conversations with Michael A. Telesca, the Chief Judge for the Western District of New York, Judge Telesca said.


Incentives for Research On Drugs Are Debated
A proposal to limit Federal incentives for companies to develop drugs for people with rare disorders touched off intense debate today among patients and drug companies at a Congressional hearing.
Under the proposal, drug manufacturers would lose exclusive marketing rights they now hold under the Orphan Drug Act, once sales of the drugs surpassed $200 million.
Proponents of change said big drug companies were charging high prices and reaping unjustified profits for drugs they sold under provisions of a law intended to encourage development of drugs with little commercial value.
Defenders of the system set up under the law said that without it dozens of pharmaceutical breakthroughs would never have occurred and that the companies would be discouraged from conducting important research if the law were rewritten.


Howard To Leave Michigan For Pros
Desmond Howard ran his first predictable reverse yesterday.
After maneuvering through weeks of questions as if he were running through a punt-coverage team, Howard, the Heisman Award winner from the University of Michigan, said he would give up his one remaining year of eligibility to enter the National Football League draft.


Teacher Going on Trial Again in Love-Triangle Murder
The love-triangle murder trial that turned the image of the quiet, colorless suburbs on its ear with tales of infidelity, conspiracy, romantic obsession and the shadowy world of private detectives is about to start all over again.
Carolyn Warmus, a 28-year-old Westchester teacher, is being retried on charges of killing her former lover's wife.
Her first trial ended in April in a hung jury, and jurors said later that they were deadlocked 8 to 4 in favor of conviction.

New Worry for Bush; Possibility of Supreme Court Decision On Abortion Poses Campaign Risk
The Supreme Court's action today on abortion activates an extraordinarily divisive issue in the 1992 Presidential election and becomes one more worrisome variable for President Bush's re-election campaign.
Since the Supreme Court began restricting abortion rights, most notably in 1989, Democrats have grown increasingly convinced that their support for the constitutional right to choose abortion is a major political plus.


Behind Deadly Rush at City College
It was a ghastly scene on the stairwell.
People crying out, gasping for air and fainting, a fearful sense of being under water, arms pinned and fighting for life.
Three weeks after nine young people were crushed to death by the crowd at a heavily promoted basketball game featuring rap stars and other celebrities, the Dinkins administration has faulted the police, medical and security personnel, college officials, a rap promoter and spectators.
But it has not determined what caused the deadly surge in a stairwell at Nat Holman Gymnasium.

Review/Music; Melodies of Jerome Kern
As the production of new Broadway musicals slows to a trickle, increasingly the only way to enjoy the musical theater is by rummaging through its past.
That is exactly what the 92d Street Y's Lyrics and Lyricists series has been doing ever since it exhausted the supply of eminent living songwriters willing to talk about their work.
Since 1988, the series, which is written and directed by Maurice Levine, has devoted a season each to the careers of Irving Berlin, the Gershwins, Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers.
This year, the series, which opened its 22d season on Sunday, is devoting all five of its programs to Jerome Kern.
After Rodgers, Kern, who died in 1945 at the age of 60, may well be the most consistent melodist to have written for the stage during Broadway's golden age.
Appropriately, Sunday evening's program opened with Ann Hampton Callaway's glowing interpretation of "All the Things You Are," a composition that Arthur Schwartz once pronounced to be "the perfect song."


Dow Chemical To Report a Loss
The Dow Chemical Company said it would report a loss for the fourth quarter of 1991 because of a $370 million pretax charge against earnings, related to plant closings.
Enrique C. Falla, Dow's chief financial officer, said earnings from continuing operations in the quarter would exceed 35 cents a share, as many analysts have predicted.
The results will be announced Jan. 30.


From Cruel to Cool, Singer Recalls Roots of Hate
THERE is a snapshot of the singer Garland Jeffreys that grabs you like a summer afternoon and won't let go.
He is 4 or 5 years old and going to his first baseball game.
Behind him is the late, great Ebbets Field.
He wears a Dodgers uniform, high black shoes, a Jackie Robinson button.
His open face holds no secrets.
"This kid's ready," said the man the boy became.
"He's not afraid."


Stocks Rise in Japan
Stock prices surged in Tokyo today after four days of losses, with a rally heating up in the afternoon.
The Nikkei index of 225 shares finished up 675.82 points, or 3.24 percent, to end the trading session at 21,534.12.
The Nikkei lost 55.52 points on Tuesday.


Saudis Say They'll Trim Oil Output
Yielding to increasing pressure from other OPEC members, Saudi Arabia said today that it would cut oil production by about 100,000 barrels a day.
The reduction by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of crude, amounts to a modest 1.2 percent of its daily output, but some analysts said that in coming months, in cooperation with other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the Saudis could make further cuts.


Art Gallery At Yale Gets
The Yale University Art Gallery has received $10 million from Teresa Heinz in memory of her husband, Senator John Heinz 3d of Pennsylvania.
It is the largest gift in the gallery's 160-year history.
Senator Heinz graduated from Yale College in 1960 and was a member of the gallery's governing board before his death last April in a plane crash.
His father, Henry J. Heinz 2d, a member of the Class of 1931 and longtime chairman of the H. J. Heinz Corporation, permanently endowed the directorship of the gallery in 1982.


In Russia, Long Lines for Plentiful Bread
Few bread stores anywhere are as well-equipped as the Australia Shop on Piatnitskaya Street in downtown Moscow.
Automated equipment, a recent gift from Australia, mixes dough and bakes bread 18 hours a day, and as fresh loaves come out of the stainless-steel ovens, they are stacked in wire-mesh trays, waiting to be sold.
But despite this abundance, anxious customers form a line half a block long outside the shop.
Lines like these, televised abroad, give the impression of a bread shortage in Moscow, an impression that by all accounts is erroneous.
Bread sales have risen to record levels in recent months, as people substitute bread for meat, cheese, milk and eggs, all of which have grown much too expensive for many consumers.


Fannie Mae Payment
The Federal National Mortgage Association said today that its former chairman, David Maxwell, had relinquished his right to a final retirement payment of $5.5 million.


U.S. Agents Say Libya Is Adding And Hiding Chemical Weapons
Libya is expanding its chemical weapons program, and is dispersing chemical stockpiles to avoid detection, United States intelligence officials say.

Muammar el-Qaddafi has trucked large quantities of chemicals from its chemical weapons complex at Rabta to isolated sites throughout the country.

I.B.M. Introduces Low-End Work Station
I.B.M. introduced its least expensive work station and other new products yesterday in an effort to move more aggressively into the rapidly growing market for network computing systems for scientific and commercial users.
With its new Powerstation 220 machine, the world's largest computer maker is playing catch-up at the low end of the work station market, analysts said.
The low-cost, single-chip version of the RS/6000 work station family had been delayed for technical reasons and is still more expensive than similar machines from Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard.
Indeed, a black-and-white version of the machine without a disk drive is priced starting at $6,345.
Similar low-end machines from Sun, Digital and Hewlett-Packard cost less than $5,000.


Executive Stock Rule Considered
The group that makes most of the nation's accounting rules is about to revive a long-dormant project that would require companies to deduct from their income the cost of granting stock options to their top executives.
The group, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, seems eager to correct a situation that has allowed corporations to play down their executive pay and to protect their earnings.
With the issue of executive compensation heating up nationally, the board apparently feels it can no longer afford to ignore the situation.
That is especially so now that the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the board, has shown an increasingly keen interest in improving financial reporting.
A Possible Showdown
But at the same time, the group is aware it is hurtling toward a big showdown with the executives whose companies are among its biggest financial backers.


Soviet Myths Die Hard: Bolsheviks Didn't Overthrow the Czar
To the Editor:
Just when the Russian people themselves have at last seen through the false claims of Bolshevism, have removed the portraits and statues of Lenin, and have restored St.
Petersburg to its historic name, up pops Mary Ann Curtis to repeat some Soviet myths as facts ("Wait Until the Soviet People Have Spoken," letter, Jan. 8).
Let us in the first place address Ms.
Curtis's first so-called fact: that the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 threw off the Czar.

Review/Rap; Big Biceps, Bare Chest, No Blushing
Marky Mark, leading an outfit called the Funky Bunch, kept his pants on at the Ritz on Friday night, but barely.
A soft-core rapper and brother of Donnie Wahlberg of New Kids on the Block, Marky Mark has all the requisites for being a teen-age idol: a handsome face, bulging biceps and a shameless attitude.
Bare-chested, wearing baggy boxer shorts over briefs, he strutted back and forth across the stage while the almost exclusively female teen-age audience threw flowers, stuffed animals and condoms at him.
He was a rapping Atlas, a few steps shy of a Chippendales dancer.
He was an R-rated New Kid.
In between his preening and mugging, he performed most of the songs from his debut album, "Music for the People," on Interscope Records (the label responsible for another rapping pectoral wonder, Gerardo).
Marky Mark is not a bad rapper, and he is less obnoxiously egomaniacal than Vanilla Ice.
"Good Vibrations," the album's first and biggest single, is a catchy, melodic blend of house-style keyboards with Marky Mark's dry faux-Bronx accented vocals; "Wildside" is a well-intentioned remake of Lou Reed's 1973 hit "Walk on the Wild Side," updated to include crack addicts and gangland victims.


2d Suspect Arrested In Teacher Shooting
A man wanted in connection with the shooting of New York City schoolteacher left critically wounded when her car was caught in the midst of a gun battle in the Bronx was arrested by the San Diego police on Jan. 18 and brought back to New York City last night, a New York City police spokesman said.
The teacher, Audrey Chassen, was shot on Jan. 9 and remains hospitalized in critical condition.


Saatchi Advertising Tightens Command
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, New York, is tightening its chain of command, almost six months after an elaborate restructuring left some doubts as to who was in charge.
Saatchi announced yesterday that Richard Humphreys, who had been appointed president in August, would be leaving the agency.
Mr.
Humphreys had also been serving in a four-person office of the chief executive, which is being disbanded upon his departure.


Supreme Court in Trenton Considers Death Sentence
The New Jersey Supreme Court, which has upheld the death sentence given Robert O. Marshall for ordering his wife's murder, began deliberating today over whether carrying it out would be fair.
Under state law, each death sentence must be compared with the sentences in other similar cases to make sure a defendant is not executed for a crime that is usually punished with a prison sentence.


Elderly Can Get Help With Their Utility Bills
To the Editor:
"The Difference a Few Blocks Can Make" (Metropolitan News, Jan. 6) accurately points out that in New York City people are often reluctant to go to a different neighborhood even to apply for a helpful benefit such as the Home Energy Assistance Program.
However, the real problem is that low-income people who need this grant to pay for their fuel and utility bills will be deprived of it because the Federal Government has allocated less money for HEAP, made the eligibility requirements tougher, and thus gives less money to fewer people.
The Department for the Aging is making it simple for the needy elderly to apply.
Recognizing that applying in person may be especially difficult, the department does not require them to do that.
New Yorkers age 60 and older may mail their applications to the department; they may also pick up an application at many neighborhood senior centers or call the department at 212-577-0276.


No Barcelona Hotel Crush
After months of talk about a severe housing shortage for the 1992 Summer Olympics, it now appears there could be a housing surplus as organizers here have canceled 400 first-class hotel reservations, many of which were set aside for use by corporate sponsors.
Pedro Fontana, director eneral of the Barcelona Olympic Organizing Committee, blamed high prices and a worldwide recession for the cancellations.
Fontana said further cuts in room reservations may be forthcoming if sponsors continue to scale back their Olympic plans.


Some Neighborhood Haunts Go Back 120 Years, Some Only 40
THEY are harbors of serenity in the feverish metropolis.
You won't find them in the trend-tracking urban magazines, nor will their chefs be lionized in lists of up-and-coming stars.
And the chances of spotting Warren Beatty or Michelle Pfeiffer chewing the fat at the bar are about equal to encountering Saddam Hussein on the IRT.
These are the original neighborhood haunts.
They are steady, family- owned, economical pub-style restaurants.
The clientele is so loyal that if someone does not show up at the appointed hour, the owner calls to see if anything is wrong.

In Letter, Khrushchev Tells Of Mockery Over Cuba Crisis
Among the most embarrassing aspects of the conclusion of the 1962 missile crisis for Nikita S. Khrushchev was the mockery it exposed him to from China and other Communist countries, according to a document made public today.
In a rambling letter dated Jan. 31, 1963, to Fidel Castro explaining why he had backed down in the face of United States pressure and withdrawn nuclear missiles from Cuba, the Soviet leader complained of "representatives of some Socialist states" who were "distorting," and "criticizing" his actions.


Critic's Notebook; Making a Movie Take the Rap For the Violence That It Attracts
The type of individual who would brandish a semi-automatic weapon at a movie theater where Ernest Dickerson's "Juice" is playing (as someone did in Commack, L.I., the other evening) is the best argument for the reasonableness of what Mr.
Dickerson has to say.
His film addresses the peer pressures at work on a group of Harlem high school students, one of whom eventually develops a taste for murderous mayhem and viciously attacks his friends.
The irrational bravado and macho posturing displayed by Bishop (Tupac Shakur), the film's bad-boy character, are undoubtedly shared by those gun-toting, knife-wielding moviegoers who have put "Juice" in the news.
In the wake of similar violent outbreaks surrounding the openings of Mario Van Peebles's "New Jack City" and John Singleton's "Boyz N the Hood," it's not surprising to find this happening again.
All these films address the frustration faced by young urban black men, and all have become lightning rods for that frustration.
So bad news is being delivered, both in the lobby and on the screen.


1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans; Bush Urges Head Start Increase, And Debate on Its Impact Follows
President Bush flew to Baltimore today to announce his proposal for a vast increase in Federal spending for Head Start, the program for preschool children from low-income families.
The President's trip was largely intended to help right his listing re-election campaign after a string of ill-fated appearances.
But his announcement quickly became caught up in differences between the Administration and outside experts over whether, as the White House repeatedly asserted today, the increase would insure that the widely praised program is available to every 4-year-old eligible for it.


A Drama That Will Rival the Ring When Tyson Faces His Accuser
No fighter since the days of Muhammad Ali has been dissected and inspected quite the way Mike Tyson has.
At age 25 he has been one of those public figures who fascinate the masses and command constant attention.
While some of that has had to do with the primal aggression Tyson showed in becoming the youngest heavyweight champion ever, as much curiosity has focused on Tyson's personal life and problems outside the ring.
There, as his own worst enemy, Tyson has sometimes seemed on the verge of short-circuiting that glorious career as a fighter.


Georgia Redistrict Plan Rejected; Black-White Battle Seen as Likely
The United States Justice Department today rejected as racially discriminatory a redistricting plan approved last year by the Georgia Legislature.
The move raised the possibility of a battle between black and white legislators over how to draft a new plan.
Today's decision was hailed by black legislators who had criticized the earlier plan, which redrew Congressional and state legislative districts to take account of the 1990 census.

Judge Wraps Jury in Secrecy and Bars a Lawyer as Gotti Trial Opens
Wrapping prospective jurors in extraordinary secrecy and security, the judge conducting John Gotti's latest trial yesterday began a process of picking people who will remain nameless, who will be hidden in a hotel and whose faces cannot even be drawn by sketch artists in the courtroom.
The judge, I. Leo Glasser, also disqualified the main lawyer for Mr.
Gotti's co-defendant, the fourth lawyer he has rejected from the defense team.
"That's the American flag there -- not a swastika!" the irate defendant, Frank Locascio, said, gesturing at the flag behind the judge's bench.

CHRONICLE
The switchboard at the offices of the National Abortion Rights Action League was deluged with calls yesterday from supporters of abortion rights who wanted reservations for the organzation's fund-raising dinner, to be held tonight in Washington.
KATE MICHELMAN, executive director of the organization, said she did not know if she could accommodate everyone who asked at the last minute to attend the event in the Mayflower Hotel.
"We already had 600 signed up, but so many people told us, 'I need to come, need to be there,' that I decided we will just put up extra chairs," she said.


Massachusetts Acts on Workers' Comp Fraud
To the Editor:
It was with great interest that I read your news articles regarding the terrible problem of workers' compensation fraud across the country (front page, Dec. 29; Business Day, Dec. 30).
On Dec. 23, 1991, I signed into law a reform of the Massachusetts workers' compensation system.
The elimination of fraud received the highest priority in the reform package.
The new Massachusetts legislation creates a privately operated and financed insurance fraud bureau that will conduct fraud surveillance and investigations.
The insurance fraud bureau is entirely financed through an assessment on all insurance companies writing workers' compensation business in Massachusetts and is overseen by the Massachusetts Division of Insurance, which has the authority to affect insurers' rates if the fraud bureau does not substantially reduce fraudulent workers' compensation costs.
The insurance fraud bureau is thereby free of the bureaucratic entanglements associated with a state-operated fraud unit, and has significant financial incentives for effective performance.


Benjamin Gilbert, 84, Private Investor, Dies

Champion Jack Dupree, Jazz Pianist, 82
Champion Jack Dupree, a New Orleans-born jazz pianist whose barrelhouse style influenced rock musicians like Eric Clapton and John Mayall, died of cancer on Tuesday at his home in Hanover, Germany.
He was 82 years old and had lived in Hanover since 1975.
He had been living in Europe since 1958, said Karsten Jahnke, his agent.
He often performed in clubs in Britain, where Mr.
Clapton and other young musicians learned from his rollicking blues styling.

Pittsburgh Mayor Seeks New Image: From Grandmother to Tough Leader
Mayor Sophie Masloff was in her elegantly appointed office talking to a reporter when her chief of staff stepped up to her desk and interrupted.
"Sophie," he said, "I popped a button off my jacket and I was looking for you to sew it on for me."
The aide, Joseph Sabino Mistick, was poking fun at the image of Pittsburgh's first female Mayor as a soft and nurturing grandmother.
It is an image she encouraged at first, often calling herself "an old Jewish grandmother" and saying she wanted to be known as Sophie to everyone in this city of 370,000 people, which has a large elderly population and about 80 ethnic neighborhoods.

Remember Red-Meat Orgies In the Cave? Your Taste Buds Do
Talk about nostalgia for old-fashioned food.
While some people nurse memories of grandma's cooking, the anthropologist Lionel Tiger's fixation is caveman food -- Upper Paleolithic caveman food that is, from 10,000 or so years ago, the dawn of civilization.
And like it or not, he says it's what we long for, too.
We are drawn to the campfire and tempted by the "newly traditional barbecue, with its particular primordial attention to the taste of smoke -- always surrounded by the magnetic aroma of charring fat," he insists in his new book, "The Pursuit of Pleasure" (Little Brown; $22.95).

Bank Fund, C.D. Yields Down Again
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit dropped for the week that ended yesterday, but the pace of the decline slowed, according to figures released yesterday by The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication that follows bank rates.
The explanation, however, does not give much solace to savers hoping for an end to the rate declines.
Robert K. Heady, The Monitor's publisher, explained: "The modest decline in savings yield for the most recent week was caused partly by the Monday bank holiday" observing the birthday of the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.
Some institutions that normally change rates effective on Wednesday, he said, will cut them on Thursday of this week instead.


Ernest Pendrell Dead; TV Producer Was 78
Ernest Pendrell, a producer of television documentaries and a playwright in television's early years, died yesterday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.
He was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
He died of throat cancer, said his wife, Dorothy.


Our Man in Nirvana
In the first week of August 1974, when I was a speechwriter for President Richard Nixon, I walked into the office of the White House physician, next door to the White House.
As I asked for some allergy medicine, I noticed a surgical-steel tray laden with filled syringes, their needles dripping.
Next to them was a vial of a potent chlorpromazine tranquilizer.
I knew the corpsman who was loading the tray and I asked him what it was all about.
He said it was for someone "over there," jerking his thumb toward the White House.
He would not tell me who was getting shots of tranquilizers in those final days of the Administration.
He said only that it was "someone who needs to have his head clear, and won't."


A Man Who Wants Respect For Lintas New York's Work
WHAT agency created "The Magic of Macy's" campaign?
If enough people in the advertising community can guess correctly, then F. Stone Roberts will have less work to do in his new post as president of Lintas New York.
But Mr.
Roberts suspects that he has a substantial task before him to publicize his agency's skills.
"My first obvious priority is to raise the company's profile," said the agency's 47-year-old chief operating officer, who was given the additional title of president yesterday.
"I believe that our product is much better today than it is perceived."


Assembly Plant For Ford Exports
The Ford Motor Company said it planned to export to Europe 6,000 Explorer utility vehicles assembled at its plant here, beginning next year.

America-Bashing, Not All False
First came President Bush's clumsy, embarrassing effort to bully the Japanese into buying unwanted autos and parts.
Now Yoshio Sakurauchi, Speaker of Japan's lower house, gratuitously and falsely berates U.S. workers as lazy and illiterate.
As apologetic Japanese officials realize, these views could not have spewed out at a worse time, with overtones of trade war already audible in the Presidential campaign. 'Sneak Attack!' yesterday's New York Post shouted, voicing the offense many Americans are apt to feel.
Both countries have an urgent interest in halting such bilateral blame-mongering quickly.
And it is in Americans' particular interest to recognize why Speaker Sakurauchi's comments sting.
However coarse, they come close to some truth.


Citicorp and 2 Other Banks Post Losses as Loans Sour
The decline in the California real estate market has caught up with some of the state's largest banks, and yesterday Wells Fargo &amp; Company and the Security Pacific Corporation announced large fourth-quarter losses as a result.
And Citicorp, as expected, posted losses for the fourth quarter and the year.
Wells and Security Pacific had also said earlier that they expected losses in the quarter that were close to the shortfalls announced yesterday of $231 million at Wells and $409.2 million at Security Pacific.
They also warned that severe problems could continue as long as the state's economy remained weak.


Bills Say Their Loss Could Be Colts' Gain
Win or lose on Sunday, the Buffalo Bills players feel certain that they will lose their offensive coordinator, Ted Marchibroda, after the Super Bowl game against Washington.
Marchibroda is among the leading candidates to become the Indianapolis Colts' head coach.
Fullback Caldwell Gardner said that although the Bills were leery of the offensive masterminding by Coach Joe Gibbs of the Redskins, Marchibroda, with the Bills' no-huddle offense, could match Gibbs in ingenuity.

For the last quarter of a century, this quiet farming and university town high in the Dakota plains stood sentry at the front gates of the cold war.
Just outside of town, spread over an area the size of New Jersey, underground silos storing 150 long-range nuclear missiles puncture the wheat, potato and sugar beet fields, their deadly tips pointed north toward the former Soviet Union.
No one needs reminding that in a nuclear war, Grand Forks would be a bull's-eye at the top of Moscow's hit list.

The Pop Life
Heavy Metal Founder
Satanism, debauchery, cruelty to animals and general bad manners: If the subject is heavy metal, many of these ingredients come from the English singer Ozzie Osborne.
Mr.
Osborne, who with his band Black Sabbath helped found heavy metal over 20 years, is coming to town for a concert on Friday night.
He's 43 years old.
His fans are mostly teen-agers, and they've been listening to second-, third- and fourth-generation Black Sabbath rip-offs for years.
The genesis of the flamboyant genre is surprisingly prosaic.
"Me and my mates were living in Birmingham and we were going to a rehearsal and we saw a horror film playing at a cinema and we figured out that people were willing to pay for being scared," Mr.
Osborne said in an interview.
"At the time, 1969, we were four working-class guys in a polluted, gray, dismal city. We didn't have any dough or any hope, so we decided that we'd do a kind of horror show with dark satanic images. Looking back, it was all bull. But in a way it wasn't a joke, it was the way of life: no money, generation after generation of factory workers with no education, where the thing to do was go to the pub every Friday night and then die."


Massachusetts Acts on Workers' Comp Control; Employers Gain Control
To the Editor:
Certainly the lack of ethics behind fraudulent workers' compensation claims is alarming ("Vast Amounts of Fraud Discovered in Workers' Compensation System," front page, Dec. 29).
However, since widespread reform of the workers' compensation system is unlikely in the short term, what must be addressed are ways that employers can gain a measure of control rather quickly.
Workers' compensation programs have historically been exempt from significant cost-containment measures, resulting in compensation claims that at times vastly exceed the cost of identical procedures that are submitted as health benefits claims.


SUPER BOWL XXVI: Sports of The Times; The Kick Norwood Just Can't Forget
SCOTT NORWOOD remembers it
feels
it -- more than anyone else, surely, his 47-yard field-goal attempt with four seconds to go in the Super Bowl last year, a kick that sailed wide right by about six feet, and resulted in the Giants beating Buffalo, 20-19.
In the locker room afterward, stunned and shocked and deeply disappointed, Norwood was talking with a crush of reporters when Ralph Wilson, the owner of the Bills, broke through and grabbed his hand.
"It wasn't you, Scott, remember, you didn't lose the game," said an insistent Wilson.
"We had a lot of chances to win it."


Eating Well
IS it panic time in the fish department?
Sort of.
Sales are off, say some owners, but not the way they have been with past scares about fish or seafood.
This drop in sales followed the release of a Consumers Union study that found chemical contamination in fish and a lot of spoiled fish in markets throughout the Chicago and New York City areas.

Victim Had Gun in Parka, Expert Tells Teaneck Jury
The converted starter's pistol found in Phillip Pannell's parka pocket after he was fatally shot by a Teaneck police officer in April 1990 had been there for "some time," a retired state police chemist testified today.
The chemist, George W. Neighbor, told the chief prosecutor, Glenn D. Goldberg, that he was unable to establish in his tests on the parka and the pistol exactly how long the weapon had been in the pocket.
But in response to Mr.
Goldberg's questions, Mr.
Neighbor said: "At one time this gun had spent some time in that pocket."  Matching Fibers and Coat
His tests on the weapon, Mr.
Neighbor said, turned up red fibers matching those in the coat.
He said the fibers were lodged beneath the grips of the pistol.
In addition, he said, he found in the parka pocket flakes of nickle identical to the plating on the gun and particles of zinc that matched the zinc in the weapon's barrel and cyclinder.


A MOVE TO UNSEAL THE KENNEDY FILES
The chairman of a Congressional committee that investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy said today that he would ask Congress to order the release of all Government documents on the slaying.
He said such a move would serve to relieve public suspicions that the Government had been involved in a conspiracy to kill the President.
But the chairman, Representative Louis Stokes, an Ohio Democrat, said the release of intelligence agency files and other documents could strengthen evidence that organized crime figures were involved in the assassination.


60-Minute Gourmet
THE combination of chicken and rice has always seemed especially soothing to me.
Perhaps it is something inherent in the textures and flavors of the two ingredients, or, more likely, it is my memory at work, recreating happy meals of my youth.
In traditional French cuisine there are several recipes based on chicken and rice.
One is poularde au riz sauce supreme, in which a trussed chicken is cooked in a white stock and combined with cooked rice.
A supreme sauce is essentially a white roux combined with reduced chicken stock and cream.


Packing Cable With Programs
Cable television companies and their equipment suppliers are on the verge of installing new technology that will pack many more channels into cable networks, creating a potential programming revolution with implications for broadcasters, telephone companies and the consumer electronics industry.
Some cable programmers are getting ready to take advantage of the technique, known as digital compression.
Home Box Office began market tests last year in which it is offering three programs at once.
Currently, this requires transmission on three separate channels, but with compression, all three programs could be transmitted in the future over a single channel.
MTV, the music video channel, has also announced that it will offer three separate programs, specializing in different types of music, starting next year.

Shuffle of Economists: Dean Witter Lands One
At a time when the stock market is bubbly and the economy is flat, chief economists at some of the nation's biggest banks and brokerages have been involved in a giant job shuffle.
The latest job hopper is Joseph G. Carson, 39, who will be chief economist at the Dean Witter Financial Services Group, a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company.
Until recently Chemical Bank's top forecaster, Mr.
Carson lost that post to Irwin Kellner, his counterpart at Manufacturers Hanover, after the two banks merged.


Treasuries Move Up in Price Again
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher and interest rates fell again yesterday, as the recovery from the sharp selloff of the last two weeks continued.
"Underwriting all the corporate paper issued during the early part of January made Treasuries cheap," one government securities trader said, since dealers had to sell Treasury issues to cover positions in unsold corporate issues.


Public &amp; Private; The $64 Question
It's hard to imagine, looking over New Jersey's new welfare legislation, that the people who designed it sought information or help from those who will be most affected by it.
Have they talked to the people who have pumped themselves up with job training programs and then been blindsided by the reality of the job market?
Have they talked to the women on welfare who fear that if they go to work they will lose their children's health care coverage?
Have they talked to those who have stayed on public assistance rather than take minimum wage jobs because they had no place to put their kids while they worked?


A Stick-to-the-Ribs Meal With a Light Exotic Touch
IN cold weather, I always long for something hearty and earthy -- substantial stick-to-the-ribs fare.
This menu satisfies this yearning, with three robust dishes seasoned in an Oriental way.
I serve my bread and onion pancakes as a first course, although they would be equally good as a main course for brunch or breakfast, or as a light lunch with a salad.
They are simple, delicious and filling, as well as thrifty, since you make them with leftover bread.


Ready for Prime Time in Moscow
For the first time, tens of millions of Russian television viewers will spend a week watching "Murphy Brown," "Life Goes On" and an array of American prime-time programs and movies dubbed in their language.
Michael Jay Solomon, president of Warner Brothers International Television Distribution, said today that the company would announce the move with Russian television officials next Monday at the United Nations.


Fed to Relax a Bank Rule
The Federal Reserve said yesterday that it would phase out by June 30 the requirement that banks disclose in their financial statements the total amount of loans to highly indebted leveraged companies.
The 7-to-0 decision eliminates the definition of certain loans now called highly leveraged transactions, which banks issued in the 1980's.

In fact, the 12-year veteran knows more than he can tell and can't tell all he knows.

It's Time to Come Home, Now: Those Little Local Spots Are Back
ROLL out the red-checked tablecloths.
The little place around the corner is back.
The neighborhood restaurant that isn't too fancy, isn't too expensive and isn't too far away.
There has never been a shortage of these places in New York City.
In 1925, George S. Chappell noted in "The Restaurants of New York" that every side street "bristles with small restaurants, neighborhood places which care for their particular section." Their mellow, side-street glow is eclipsed by the dazzle along the avenues whenever cash flows freely in the city and big restaurants boom.
But when the glitz dims, the local joints remain.
Or, they are reinvented.


Vietnam Admits K.G.B. Interrogated American
The Government of Vietnam has confirmed that it allowed at least one American prisoner of war to be questioned by the K.G.B.
In a radio announcement in Hanoi on Monday and a statement today by Vietnam's United Nations Mission in New York, the Vietnamese said the interrogation took place in January 1973.


Scents of 60's Wafting Again (No, Not That One. Musk.)
FOR the last few years, the 1960's have been rediscovered, re-invented and regurgitated.
Miniskirts and false eyelashes, LSD and the Grateful Dead have all enjoyed revisionist status.
It seems the only unexplored territory of that overworked decade is its smells: musk oil, patchouli and sandalwood.
And guess what?
They too are back.
Twenty-five years ago, certain fragrances -- like rock and roll -- represented yet another gesture of rebellion.
Mothers wore Chanel No. 5, an artificial aldehyde scent; their sons and daughters wore patchouli essence, plucked almost directly from the plant.
Now, a new generation, too young to remember the decade, has nevertheless embraced those same scents, perhaps taking its cue from a few pop-culture icons.

Prosecutors Describe Kremlin Coup Plot
The men who organized the unsuccessful hard-line coup in Moscow last August had counted on the prospect that Mikhail S. Gorbachev would eventually join their conspiracy to put the country back under authoritarian rule, Russian prosecutors said today.
But after a four-and-a-half-month investigation, Deputy Chief Prosecutor Yevgeny Lisov said at a news conference, there was no evidence that Mr.
Gorbachev had done anything to encourage the conspirators in this belief.


Stein Starts Mayoral Bid With a Bash
New York City's 1993 mayoral campaign began haltingly 15 months ago when Andrew J. Stein and, a few months later, Rudolph W. Giuliani all but declared their candidacies -- then just as abruptly dismissed their candor as premature and retreated from the starting line.
With the election only a year away, the campaign has begun again.
It looms as long, costly and acrimonious.

CHRONICLE
The National Arts Club will present its 93d annual Gold Medal of Honor tonight to CHRISTO, the Bulgarian- born artist, for his wrapping of the Pont Neuf in Paris in fabric and, later, several islands in Biscayne Bay in Florida.
His latest work, an installation of 1,760 huge yellow umbrellas in California and 1,340 umbrellas in Japan, was ended abruptly in October after a gust of wind uprooted an umbrella near Los Angeles and killed a spectator.
A worker dismantling the exhibit in Japan died when the crane he was operating touched a power line.


An Ad in Defense Of the Ad Deduction
Proposals to cut the Federal deficit by lowering the deductions on advertising as a business expense have not made much progress over the last five years.
But as President Bush's State of the Union address nears, the American Advertising Federation is not taking any chances.
In a pre-emptive strike against such a measure's inclusion in this year's budget package, the group has created an ad in the form of a letter to the President.
It describes advertising as an "engine of economic growth" and goes on to say: "Like you, Mr. President, we want to help get America's economy started again. Incentives to advertise are incentives for growth."


Libya Unyielding Despite U.N. Demand
The Security Council voted unanimously today to demand that Libya turn over for trial the agents accused of blowing up two civilian passenger aircraft and killing 440 people, but Libya indicated no willingness to comply.
The Council's resolution in effect tells Libya to cooperate with the investigation that Britain, France and the United States are conducting into the two bombings by surrendering two Libyans indicted for these acts.
Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 and U.T.A. flight 772 over Niger, in Africa, a year later. 'Satisfaction' Among Families


Who Should Liberate Iraq?
Should America encourage Iraqis to overthrow Saddam Hussein?
Yes.
Should it advertise that any new Iraqi government could expect an early easing of the international economic embargo and generous reconstruction aid?
Yes again.
But should the U.S. commit itself in advance to give armed support to any group that challenges the Iraqi dictator, as Saudi Arabia now urges?
Under present circumstances, the best answer is no.
The world has every right to hold Saddam Hussein accountable to international law.
But replacing even the most obnoxious regimes, provided their cruelties are confined to their own territories, is best left to the people directly concerned.

Super Bowl Tasting Menu
A typical menu for television viewers of the big game between Washington and Buffalo on Sunday consists of beer, chips and sandwiches.

Bridge
If one conducted a survey of bridge teachers around the world and asked them to estimate how many people have taken their lessons, a safe prediction is that the estimate by Bill Root of Boca Raton, Fla., would be far greater than any other, perhaps double the next number.
He is well into his fourth decade of teaching large groups, often 100 students or more, although he has abandoned his native New York and now confines himself to teaching in Florida.
For those who cannot attend his classes but would like the benefit of the bridge wisdom that has brought Root many national titles, the next-best thing is to hear him on videotape.

Dow Loses 30.64 as Nasdaq Loses Track
Stock prices pulled back yesterday for the second day in a row, with investors apparently sounding a note of caution after a giddy ride in recent weeks.
Also weighing on the market was a computer problem that prevented the main Nasdaq indexes from being calculated for most of the day.
Traders knew there was weakness in smaller stocks -- it was determined late in the day that the Nasdaq composite dropped a hefty 14.51 points, or 2.3 percent, to 604.87 -- but the uncertainty was compounded by the absence of firm numbers.
Analysts said this added to the drop in other indexes, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 30.64, or nearly 1 percent, to 3,223.39.
Trades Were Still Executed
A software problem that developed around 10:30 A.M. prevented the Nasdaq from calculating and posting changes on the composite, industrial and 100-stock indexes.


Economy Likely To Revive Soon, Congress Is Told
At the start of a Presidential election year in which the economy is a central issue, the Congressional Budget Office predicted today that the economy would begin a weak recovery by the middle of 1992 and warned lawmakers not to endanger the recovery by resorting to radical changes in economic policy before the November election.
In a report to Congress, the budget office said the recession was likely to end within six months.
But it offered no guidance as to whether Mr.
Bush and Congress would be able to withstand the mounting political pressure for steps to stimulate the economy.


Thieves Rob Police Officers In Queens
Two New York City police officers, one on duty, were robbed at gunpoint early yesterday morning in separate incidents by what the police believe was the same band of thieves in Queens.
In both cases, the suspects approached in the same stolen car and threatened the officers with the same silver gun, the police said.
One victim was an undercover officer wearing civilian clothes, while the uniform of the on-duty officer was hidden by his topcoat.


Optimism on Scott
St.
John's officials were more optimistic yesterday that SHAWNELLE SCOTT, the injured sophomore forward, would be able to play Saturday afternoon against Syracuse.
The team's trainer, RON LINFONTE, said that the strained tendon in Scott's right foot was responding to treatment and he listed Scott as a 50-50 possibility to play.
The availability of Scott, who was injured with 1 minute 30 seconds to go in the first half of the 75-60 loss to Seton Hall on Monday, is even more important with ROBERT WERDANN, the senior center, out for at least two more weeks with a sprained muscle in his right calf.


McEachern to Penguins
SHAWN McEACHERN, the leading scorer on Team USA, signed a multiyear contract yesterday with the Pittsburgh Penguins and will join them after the Winter Olympics next month.
McEachern, a left wing who played at Boston University for three seasons, was the Penguins' sixth-round draft choice in 1987.
He was a first-team all-American and the leading scorer on Boston University's team last season with 34 goals and 48 assists. (AP)

Cuba Announces Crackdown On Dissident Organizations
The Cuban Government put dissidents on notice today that they faced an all-out security and political crackdown.
The warning came the day after the execution of a right-wing Cuban exile convicted of sabotage and terrorism.
A front-page editorial in the official Communist Party newspaper Granma defending the execution by firing squad of Eduardo Diaz Betancourt included a clear message to illegal dissident groups that they could expect no tolerance for their activities and no room for their opinions.

United Technologies To Cut 13,900 Jobs; Blow to Connecticut
The United Technologies Corporation, the largest private employer in Connecticut, announced a series of plant closings and cutbacks yesterday that would eliminate 13,900 jobs, including 6,412 in the state, by 1995.
The cuts represent 7 percent of the 193,000 workers employed worldwide by the sprawling company, whose businesses include Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators.
The largest job losses will be at the Pratt &amp; Whitney division, based in East Hartford, Conn., and are a result of declining military spending, company officials said.
But virtually all parts of the company will be affected.

14 on Council Propose Removing Review Board From Police Dept.
Guaranteeing attention for an old, sensitive issue, 14 New York City Council members, most of them newly elected, declared support yesterday for legislation to make the Civilian Complaint Review Board independent of the Police Department.
The board, which investigates most complaints by civilians against police officers, has six civilians appointed by the Mayor and six civilian employees of the Police Department appointed by the Police Commissioner.
The proposal calls for eight members appointed by the Mayor, four by the City Council President and four by the Comptroller.
No Police Department employee could be on the board; former employees could be appointed.

To the Editor:
In your front-page news article of Jan. 6, you correctly laud the efforts of increasing numbers of American volunteers.
But the article misses a beat: lasting solutions to our country's problems can only be found through actions that combine service provision with advocacy efforts.
Advocacy means influencing the way society understands an issue, and affecting how our public and private institutions -- schools, corporations or the government -- respond to it.

Japan Seeks Ways to Tame Stock Market
Financial industry executives and officials, alarmed about the Japanese stock markets entering its its third year of a deep slump, are contemplating emergency measures that could reverse several years of liberalization and make it harder for foreign brokers to do business in Japan.
The measures under discussion range from introducing new restrictions on trading in stock index futures -- the principal source of profits for many foreign brokers in Japan -- to forming a huge fund with contributions from banks and securities houses to inflate share prices with concerted buying, a method last attempted tried here in the 1960's.

Could it be that the son of James Bond is a coward?
Certainly not, a jury in London ruled on Monday, awarding JASON CONNERY, son of SEAN CONNERY and the actress DIANE CILENTO, $:35,000 (about $63,000) in a libel suit he had brought against The Sun, a London tabloid, for branding him a coward.
An article in the newspaper that was published on the actor's 28th birthday, Jan. 11, 1991, shortly before the Persian Gulf war, quoted Mr.
Connery as having said: "I would sooner bury myself alive than go to war for my country. I'm a bit of a wimp on the quiet, and this whole gulf situation scares me absolutely to death."

The far-reaching changes outlined today for the vast Treasury securities market have reignited debate over how to police this crucial marketplace, which is where the Government finances its debt and where investors around the world transact billions of dollars of business each day.
One influential lawmaker denounced the regulators' revisions as inadequate, and called for tougher measures.
Many of those who participate in the market expressed intense concern that the changes, if put in place clumsily, could backfire and drive up the Government's borrowing costs.


Longer Savings Rescue Plan Sought
Albert V. Casey, chief executive of the Resolution Trust Corporation, told Congress today that more time would be needed than Congress has allowed for the savings and loan rescue, and he asked the lawmakers to extend the deadline by which the agency must spend or forfeit the $25 billion approved by Congress last fall.
Mr.
Casey said that unless the agency was given until October to use the latest installment of taxpayer money appropriated for the bailout, instead of April, as the lawmakers stipulated, the Government would spend between $3 million and $4 million a day needlessly, holding onto assets of failed institutions that could otherwise be disposed of.

Bridge
The past two decades have seen a revolution in the attitude of tournament players and organizers toward smoking.
In earlier years a majority of bridge players smoked cigarettes, cigars or pipes, and the nonsmokers were a neglected minority.
But the realization that smoking can be highly hazardous to the smoker and to a lesser extent a danger to those around him has changed that.
In nearly all American competititions today, whether in tournaments or clubs, smoking is banned in playing areas.
This is largely because the nonsmoking majority resents the discomfort of smoke and the health danger it represents but there is an altruistic component: By making smoking difficult, there is a chance that some smokers will abandon their habit.

Some of the cuts, most likely in American land-based multiple-warhead missiles, would be made without conditions, while others would hinge on the response of the four former Soviet republics with long-range nuclear weapons.
These republics, which operate under a unified command, are Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

At the Sundance Film Festival, Art and Commerce Square Off
High-stakes Hollywood games have been played here at the Sundance Film Festival since Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies and Videotape" went straight from Park City to win the grand prize at the Cannes International Film Festival three years ago.
Now art and commerce battle each other here as if they were good and evil twins in a B movie.
The good twin wants a happy truce, maybe some money.
The bad twin wants to sell its soul and perhaps still be an artist.
For film makers and others with business to do, Sundance can be nerve-racking.
But for a critic, this is partly avant-garde heaven, partly a voyeuristic peek into Hollywood deal-making.
This festival of independent films, which began last Thursday, will end on Saturday with the announcement of awards for dramatic and documentary films (they must be American and are usually by unknown directors).
Foreign films and those by better-known directors are shown out of competition, and they are some of the most startling.
Peter Sellars's brilliant and relentlessly uncommercial silent movie, "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez," is a reworked version of a film that was universally loathed when it was shown at Cannes last spring.


Israel Said to Step Up Construction of Settlements
Three new studies issued recently, based on both official documents and unofficial estimates, confirm that over the last year Israel has built housing for Jewish settlers in the occupied territories on a scale that far outstrips previous construction programs.
Statistics vary among these reports, making it difficult to extract from them a single figure for settlement-building that qualifies as definitive.


Mixed Response for Troupe's Snub to Tony Voters
The recent decision of the National Actors Theater not to invite Tony Award voters to its productions has drawn both sympathy and criticism from those in the theater world.
Traditionally, two tickets to every Broadway production are provided free to each of the 700 Tony voters.
"We have a deficit of $3 million, and we can't afford to give away seats," said Manny Kladitis, general manager of the National Actors Theater, in explaining the decision.
The repertory company, founded by the actor Tony Randall, made its debut on Dec. 10 with a production of "The Crucible." Its second production, "A Little Hotel on the Side" by Georges Feydeau is in previews and opens Sunday afternoon.

Bowe Bout Is Off
RIDDICK BOWE's Feb. 1 fight against JOSE RIBALTA at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., is off.
Bowe suffered an eye injury during a sparring session against KING IPITAN on Monday.
"The right eye is bruised," said ROCK NEWMAN, Bowe's manager, "and there is a hairline fracture of a little bone that separates the sinus membrane from the eye socket. It absolutely does not jeopardize a fight against EVANDER HOLYFIELD." Bowe was said to be the next in line to fight Holyfield, the undisputed heavyweight champion, in a bout that is targeted for April 24 in Las Vegas. . . .
The former champions GREG HAUGEN and RAY MANCINI, both 30 years old, will fight in Reno on April 3 in a scheduled 12-round outing, the fighters said yesterday.


With Some Misgivings, East Europe Snaps Up German Money
Germany's entrepreneurs and industrial giants are moving into Eastern Europe, spreading prosperity but stirring unease in a region that well remembers the horrors of World War II.
From this dilapidated town 200 miles southwest of Warsaw to Czechoslovakia to Hungary to the newly born nations of the former Soviet Union, the capital-hungry orphans of the Communist system are eagerly competing for investment from their nearest and largest Western neighbor.


Caning the Old and New
Yorkville Caning  31-04 60th Street (near Northern Boulevard), Woodside, Queens 11377; (718) 274-6464.
"Cane loves to be used," said David Feuer, president of Yorkville Caning.
But caned seats, backs and table tops are easily misused.
Owners stand on them, animals claw them and children love to poke things through them.
Cane also disintegrates and dries with age, becoming brittle and breakable.
But there are a variety of choices -- and price ranges -- when recaning is needed.


Knicks Are Pounded So Hard That They Fall Out of First
Once the Philadelphia 76ers got the Knicks down tonight, they never let them back up.
Charles Barkley, who scored a season-high 37 points, attacked the Knicks like a shark smelling blood.
As if that were not enough, Hersey Hawkins (23 points) and Armon Gilliam (24 points) made sure Barkley was not a one-man act.


Late Buying Pushes Dow Up by 32.42
Stock prices posted crisp gains in active trading yesterday, as investor confidence returned after two days of losses.
With low interest rates continuing to be a driving force, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 32.42 points, to 3,255.81.
The surge appeared suddenly late in the afternoon, aided by waves of computer-program buying, said Philip H. Smyth, an analyst with Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading.
He said the firm detected heavy program buying from about 3:18 P.M. to near the close, and the combined effect of the programs added 20.79 points to the Dow.

Hasidic Public School District Is Unconstitutional, Judge Rules
A special public school district in a Hasidic community in Orange County was established in violation of the constitutional separation of church and state, a State Supreme Court judge ruled today.
The school district, which provides bilingual classes in English and Yiddish for 138 severely disabled children in the Hasidic enclave of Kiryas Joel, was formed in 1989 after many parents in the community refused to send their children to local public schools.

CHRONICLE
PAUL McCARTNEY has been awarded the first Polar Music Prize by the Swedish Academy of Music.
The Academy says the prize, about $200,000, is "without comparison in the world of music." It will be presented in Stockholm in May.
The prize was awarded to Mr.
McCartney for creativity as a composer and performer, and for helping to revitalize popular music in the past 30 years.
The stipend was made possible by a large donation made to the academy by Stig Anderson, who managed the Swedish pop group, Abba, some two decades ago.


47th STREET JOURNAL; A Bankrupt but Still Popular Mecca
The leafleters were on the street corners, making that crisp snapping sound as they handed out their blue and yellow fliers as always.
The elbow-to-elbow crowd at the counter was pointing and shooting point-and-shoot cameras and aiming extremely powerful binoculars at the farthest thing that they could find, which in this case was the cashier.
The day after 47th Street Photo filed for bankruptcy protection, the main store looked like business as usual.
But business as usual at 47th Street Photo has never been quite like business as usual anywhere else.


Revco Has New Plan To Block a Takeover
Revco D.S. today renewed its battle to remain independent, two weeks after the retail pharmacy chain appeared ready to accept a $1 billion takeover bid by the Jack Eckerd Corporation.
Revco, operating under Federal bankruptcy court protection, said it had filed a revised reorganization plan that would pay creditors more than $100 million in cash plus secured debt and equity.
The company valued the new plan at about $925 million.


Judge Spurns 'Caller ID'
An administrative law judge with the California Public Utilities Commission has recommended that a "Caller ID" telephone service proposed by Pacific Bell, GTE-California and Contel not be approved.
Pacific Bell said it would challenge the recommendation.
The proposed service would display the number of the caller on a small box attached to the telephone.
The companies would allow customers to prevent their numbers from appearing on a recipient's Caller ID box in a process called "blocking."

Pop and Jazz in Review
Kenny Kirkland
Fat Tuesday's 190 Third Avenue (at 17th Street) Manhattan Through Sunday
The pianist Kenny Kirkland's first set at Fat Tuesday's on Tuesday night bumped along like a car with a flat tire.
Almost everything was going against it, including the club's sound system, which turned the music into an indistinct blare.
Jeff Watts, the group's drummer, played as if he were in Madison Square Garden instead of in a small club, drowning out much of what the band played.
And Mr.
Kirkland has a sentimental streak that turned a handful of ballads into excursions to a land where trite prettiness is passed off as emotion.
But two things saved the set: the brute force of the band and the addition of the percussionist Milton Cardona two-thirds of the way through the show.


Review/Theater; 'Virginia Woolf,' With Marlo Thomas
The Broadway opening of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" sent a seismic shock through the American theater.
In common with "Look Back in Anger" in England, the Edward Albee play was something new and bracing in an art that was trapped by tradition.
With surgical precision, "Virginia Woolf" revealed the psychological truths within a disastrous, festering marriage.
The play awakened a dormant theater at the same time it offended the Pulitzer Prize committee, which rejected its justified nomination as the finest drama of its season.
Still, 1962 was very much Mr.
Albee's year.
Coming after his Off Broadway one-acts, the play confirmed his artistry and its success opened doors for writers like Sam Shepard, Lanford Wilson and David Mamet who followed him in replenishing the theater.
Thirty years later, "Virginia Woolf," in revival at the Hartford Stage Company, retains its natural ferocity and brilliance.
This is in spite of a production that is crucially marred in one of its two principal roles.


Airlines File Lawsuit Over Alien Detention
Refusing the role of jailers of aliens seeking political asylum, a group of major American airlines filed suit yesterday to challenge a policy by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that holds them responsible for detaining undocumented passengers and stowaways when their planes stop over in the United States.
In the suit filed in Federal District Court in Washington, the air carriers, represented by the Air Transport Association of America, charged that the policy violated Federal law setting a fee system to cover detention costs of undocumented foreigners.

Home Video
It's not every day that adults storm video stores to buy films with dancing mushrooms and Mickey Mouse.
In November when Disney released the animated classic "Fantasia" on tape for the first time, strange things began to happen.
"It wasn't the kids coming up with the parents saying 'I want that, Mommy or Daddy,' says Ron Castell, the senior vice president of Blockbuster, the country's largest video chain. "It was the parents who came in looking for it specifically."
Like Blockbuster, other stores report that "Fantasia," a rather stately and often abstract animated film with a classical sound track released in 1940, is being bought by parents as much for themselves as for their children.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media; Sound Bites Become Smaller Mouthfuls
Tom Brokaw of NBC News recently bemoaned "the cancer of the sound bite" afflicting Presidential campaigning, a description that accurately summarized the prevailing contempt toward those snippets of speech on the evening news.
But it may not have been the best metaphor.
Cancer tumors are invidious because they keep growing.
Sound bites seem only to shrink.
In 1968, which was about when television producers began using the term "sound bite," a Presidential candidate spoke for 43 uninterrupted seconds in the average appearance on the evening news.
With each subsequent campaign the bites got shorter, and by 1988 the average was a mere 9 seconds.

The board rejected a proposal to become the first district in the nation to make condoms available to junior high school students.
The 4-to-3 vote followed six tumultuous hours of public comment and board debate before a deeply divided audience of more than 200 people.
The meeting was interrupted several times by shouted insults and obscenities, and the police removed a few hecklers from the audience.

South Korea's rush toward first world economic status has dazzled admiring outsiders.

Poor Children in Tough Times
Gov.
Mario Cuomo concedes that his new New York State budget isn't good news but says it's not "a doomsday budget" either.
Put more directly, it is a bad news budget, filled with sobering cuts in everything from Medicaid to the state work force.
No sector is immune from pain, but in a trying time Mr.
Cuomo at least makes an effort to maintain his commitment to children.
Many of the details are still missing but it is clear that the Governor's budget inevitably calls for cuts in programs and services that benefit children.
Children use Medicaid, go to hospitals and schools, live in cities, towns and counties that will suffer from reductions in state aid.

The announcement came during a speech at the Nextworld computer show here, at which Next introduced several new products, including a version of its Nextstep operating system for personal computers using the Intel Corporation's 486 microprocessor.
The product, designed to broaden the appeal of Next's software, will be available in the third quarter for $995, the company said.


MCI, Grown Big, Looks Abroad
At the MCI Communications Corporation, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, they figure that this year is 8 A.D., or eight years after the formal divestiture of A.T.&amp; T. The dark time before that is known as B.C. -- before competition.

Astronauts From 3 Countries Ride Shuttle Into Orbit
Seven astronauts from three countries sailed flawlessly into orbit today aboard the space shuttle Discovery and began a busy week of medical and scientific experiments.

The flight was delayed for an hour because of concerns about weather, an errant warning about a problem with a fuel cell and remote sensor readings indicating a potential problem with lightning.


English Bathrooms: Out of the Closet
The term water closet may sound like a quaint euphemism, but over the years it has also come to be a pretty fair description of the typical British bathroom.
As often as not, it is a cramped, airless cubicle, a kind of architectural afterthought crouched at the end of a creaky hallway or hidden beneath the stairs of a 19th-century terrace house.
But in the last few years, the British bathroom has begun to come into its own.
Not only are new houses equipped with larger and more luxurious bathrooms, but there is a growing trend to remodel and update old bathrooms, often using florid antique or reproduction fixtures that evoke the look and feel of Victorian manor houses.

The evening's events will include screenings of "The Pip From Pittsburgh," a 1931 Charlie Chase comedy, and "Helpmates," a 1932 Laurel and Hardy classic.
Along with birthday cake and champagne, Mr.
Roach will be presented with the James Smithson Medal, the Smithsonian's highest award, given "in recognition of exceptional contributions to art, science, history, education and technology."

Mercantile Buying Maison Blanche
The Mercantile Stores Companyhas agreed to buy Maison Blanche Inc., a chain of 16 department stores in Louisiana and Florida, for an undisclosed amount.

It will operate Maison Blanche's eight Louisiana stores under the Maison Blanche name and the chain's eight Florida stores as Gayfer's, a Mercantile division based in Mobile, Ala.


Israelis Try, Again, to Limit Access to Scrolls

It applies to the distribution of the two-volume "Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls," which was published in November, in "any fashion, in Israel or elsewhere."

Budgetary Brinkmanship; Dire Threats to Cut Essential Services Are Often Just a Ploy
As tax receipts slip and budgets come under the knife in statehouses, city halls and private institutions, the region is witnessing the flowering of a kind of brinkmanship in which officials seek to protect their budgets by threatening to cut where the pain will be worst.
The object of this exercise is not usually to perform the dire amputations that are threatened, budget experts say, but to arouse support for an agency's strongest suit, usually the area in which it comes in contact with the public, and to deflect budget-cutting attention from more vulnerable, back-office operations with no public constituency.

Market Place; High-Flier May Be Airworthy Again
A LITTLE over a year ago, Sequent Computer Systems Inc. hit the invisible wall that seems to lie in wait for high-flying high-technology companies.
Sequent, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., and makes superminicomputers, missed its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter of 1990 and spent the first three quarters of 1991 mired in red ink.
Sequent's troubles began with a significant decline its original equipment manufacturing business, in which Sequent computers are resold by the Unisys Corporation.
That arrangement, coupled with the recession and some internal difficulties, left the company in a position where it "couldn't peel expenses fast enough," said Casey Powell, Sequent's chairman and chief executive.

New Chief Is Named At Crum &amp; Forster
The Xerox Corporation said yesterday that Joseph W. Brown Jr. had been named president and chief executive of its Crum &amp; Forster Inc. insurance subsidiary, replacing Robert J. Vairo, who is retiring at the age of 61.
Mr.
Vairo has been with the company for 17 years, the last three as chief executive.
Xerox moved quickly after the highly regarded Mr.
Brown unexpectedly resigned just over a month ago from his position as president and chief executive of the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company.
Mr.
Brown, who is 43 and is known as Jay, said at the time that he and his wife wanted to be closer to relatives on the East Coast.
But insurance industry executives assumed that the major reason was disagreements with executives at Allianz A.G.
Holding, the German insurance giant that acquired Fireman's Fund, which is based in Novato, Calif., in 1989.

McEnroe String Snapped
What began as a series of breathtaking Australian Open victories over top-ranked opponents finally ended today as John McEnroe was unable to overcome the powerful and precise strokes of Wayne Ferreira.
The 46th-ranked Ferreira was virtually flawless in his 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 dissection of the 28th-ranked McEnroe.
And the McEnroe who was so stunning against Boris Becker and Emilio Sanchez early in the Open was now at a loss with this little-known player.

2.6% Gain In Starts Of Housing
In a report pointing to economic recovery, Commerce Department figures showed today that builders broke ground for new homes in December at the fastest pace in more than a year and that permits for future construction did even better.
Housing starts ran at an annual rate of 1,103,000 last month, or 2.6 percent above the November rate, with all regions but the West posting gains.
Permits rose 5.8 percent, to 1,051,000.


Brophy Drops Zito as Trainer
Giles Brophy, one of the three feuding owners of Strike the Gold, winner of the Kentucky Derby last year, removed Nick Zito as trainer of his race horses yesterday.
But Zito will remain as the trainer of Strike the Gold, also owned by Bill Condren and Joe Cornaccia, who have said repeatedly that Zito would train their star colt despite the owners' legal battle over control of the horse.
Brophy, a broker in Government securities, said that Phil Johnson would take over as trainer of his personal stable of four horses in training at Gulfstream Park in Florida and would pick up five juveniles in the spring and take them to New York.

Husker Enters the Draft
Tight end JOHN MITCHELL has decided to shed Nebraska red for what he hopes will be National Football League green.
Motivated by a desire to help his family -- especially his grandparents in Mississippi -- the 6-foot-3-inch, 250-pound sophomore said he would enter the N.F.L. draft.
Last month, Mitchell said he would stay with the Cornhuskers for the 1992 season.
A third-team all-American, Mitchell had a team-leading 31 catches for 534 yards and 5 touchdowns. . . .
MAZIO ROYSTER, who became only the third Southern Cal sophomore to surpass the 1,000-yard mark in rushing when he gained 1,168 yards in 1990, announced he would skip his final year of eligibility to enter the N.F.L. draft. (AP)

PARENT &amp; CHILD
PARENTS treasure their children's verbal skills -- until the children use those skills to talk back.
"You can't make me!" and "Big deal!" figure largely in this combative lexicon.
Child psychologists and psychiatrists warn that parents are often too quick to interpret this behavior as disrespectful, when it may simply be a reflection of the child's normal development.
In fact, a child who never talks back may be at higher risk for getting into serious trouble later on.


Tax-Free and Taxable Funds See Sharp Decline in Yields
Yields on tax-exempt money funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report dropped sharply for the week ended yesterday, and yields of taxable funds also dropped significantly.
Walter Frank, economist for the organization, attributed the sharp decline in yields on the tax-exempt funds to a "lack of supply of municipal bonds early in the year, as well as the easing by the Federal Reserve late in December." Another factor, Mr.
Frank added, was an inflow that took assets of the tax-exempts to a record level.

Health Insurance Bill Is Approved by Senate Panel
In a party-line vote that reflected the intensifying partisanship of the Presidential campaign season, a Senate committee today approved an overhaul of the nation's health insurance system to cover all Americans.
The bill faces an uncertain future on the floor of the Senate, where Republicans and a handful of conservative Democrats are preparing to argue that its requirement that businesses provide health insurance for employees will unfairly hurt small companies.
But whatever its prospects for passage, the bill will sharpen an issue that Democrats feel is a point of vulnerability for President Bush, who is expected to propose more modest adjustments to the current insurance system in the State of the Union Message next week.

The Rangers couldn't hold a 2-0 lead in the first period, but there was no reason to blame goaltender Mike Richter, who made every kind of save imaginable and finished with 28.

Essay; Baker's Big Bash
America's $33-billion-a-year intelligence industry doesn't know what to tell President Bush about the central question facing three score foreign affairs bigwigs gathered in our capital this week: whether or not to pump serious money into embryonic Slavic capitalism.
The C.I.A. has just renamed its Soviet division to catch up with the times. (The first name suggested was Commonwealth of Independent States Office, but that led to the acronym "Kissoff," so it is called the Slavic and Eurasian office.) The spooks at Slav-Eu, headed by George Kolt, have long been high on Boris Yeltsin and his free-market reformers, and think that money to bolster the new states would be well invested.

Mr.

When Ambitious Students Search for a Higher Level
It happens to almost all skiers: the discouraging intermediate plateau.

"There's no challenge and no more excitement. They want to get on a learning curve to improve."


Skepticism On 'Green' Ads

And 51 percent said that they would sacrifice some quality to buy a product that would cause less damage to the environment.

NEW ELECTION PLAN IN ALBANY CREATES MINORITY DISTRICTS
A joint legislative committee today unveiled a redistricting plan that would create several new seats in the State Legislature for black and Hispanic office-seekers while protecting the Republican lock on the State Senate.
The plan, a result of intense backstage politicking in the Capitol, would set new lines for the 61 State Senate districts and 150 Assembly seats that are all up for election this fall.
The redrawing is required once a decade because of population shifts charted in the United States Census.


Leyland and Pirates Agree on New Contract

It should look green: The Pirates tore up the remaining two years on Leyland's old contract and gave him a new deal expected to make him one of the National League's highest-paid managers.
He made $300,000 last season.

Mayoral aides were scrambling to find a way to put political pressure on the state chapter of the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
The Mayor chose the state group to sponsor the parade this year over the Manhattan chapter, which had sponsored it for 150 years.

Nothing comes easy in the Big East as the Connecticut Huskies found out again tonight at the Civic Center.

Anglo-Irish Accord's Empty Promises
To the Editor:
"The 'Logic' in I.R.A. Zealotry" (editorial, Jan. 14) refers to "the landmark Anglo-Irish Agreement." But what has the Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed in 1985, achieved?
It is impossible to point to one concrete way in which the agreement has eased the plight of Catholics in Northern Ireland.


Review/Theater; Weird Epic Of History And Myth
People who know nothing about the Baltic nations and Central Europe in the Middle Ages should not try to find out anything before seeing "When Lithuania Ruled the World, Part 3" by Kestutis Nakas at the Courthouse Theater of the Anthology Film Archives.
It is enough to know that the history of that region is saturated with myth, romance and continuing ferocious controversy.
Besides, Mr.
Nakas is a very clever subverter of all versions of history; mere knowledge won't keep anyone a step ahead of him.
The medieval world Mr.
Nakas goes on creating (Parts 1 and 2 of this weird epic appeared in the 1980's; Part 4 is soon to be a film) is populated by good Lithuanian kings and rotten princes, Byzantine and Russian patriarchs, porcine and idiotic Teutonic knights, a saintly but stupid Good King Wenceslaus, a Russian czar with yeti feet, a splendidly barbaric Mongolian warlord, an underground god with horns and tail, wolves, wraiths and a monster with a bull's head wearing a cowbell.


Dinkins Wants Former Chicago Bank Chief in Top Economic Post
Barry F. Sullivan, a longtime banker and the retired head of the First Chicago Corporation, is the Dinkins administration's top choice to be New York City's new Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, and is to tell Mayor David N. Dinkins as soon as today whether he wants the job, mayoral aides said yesterday.
Mr.
Sullivan, who was born in the Bronx and spent 23 years at the Chase Manhattan Bank before leaving to head First Chicago in 1980, made a strong impression in an interview with Mr.
Dinkins at City Hall last week, the aides said.
He would replace Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, who has said she wants to spend more time with her children by shifting to a less demanding post.


Victim's Left Arm Raised, Expert Tells Teaneck Jury
Michael Baden, a former Chief Medical Examiner of New York City, testified today that Phillip Pannell's upper left arm was raised when he was shot in the back by a Teaneck policeman in April 1990.
"It had to be upward and not downward at the time the bullet struck Mr. Pannell's back," Dr.
Baden said of the left arm closest to the shoulder.
He testified that he did not know exactly how high the arm was raised, but it was above a plane parallel to the ground.


Prices of Treasury Securities Fall
Interest rates rose and prices of Treasury securities fell in light trading yesterday, as market participants continued to grapple with conflicting signals about the economy and to cope with additional new corporate debt securities.

Review/Television; Feminism Invades London Police In New Three-Part 'Mystery' Tale
Public television's "Mystery" goes into a change-of-pace mode tonight with "Prime Suspect," a four-hour British production from Granada Television.
Tonight's special two-hour installment is on Channels 13 and 49 at 9 and Channel 21 at 10.
There are no mildly eccentric detectives snooping around quaint English villages in this one.
The scene is contemporary London.
The problem is a sadistic serial killer.
The upshot is a thumpingly powerful police drama, on a par with the best of the commercial kind done by Americans, who excel in this particular genre.
The police identify a dead woman as Della Mornay, a prostitute.
The murder is grisly: hands bound, whole body bruised and sexually assaulted.
Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren), promoted to detective chief inspector 18 months earlier, wants the case, explaining that she is tired of being "sidestepped." But her boss (John Benfield) warns her that "now is not the time to thrust your women's rights down our throat" and besides, Detective Chief Inspector John Shefford (John Forgeham) and his partner, Sgt.
Bill Otley (Tom Bell), have already rushed in to take over.

At Home Abroad; 'It Is Our Only Hope'
Dov Frohman is one of Israel's high-technology business stars, a vice president of the California microcomputer company Intel and general manager of Intel Israel.

Frohman invented the Eprom chip, a breakthrough that helped start Intel's phenomenal growth.
He took a year off in Africa, teaching in Ghana and going up the Congo River in Zaire.
Then he persuaded Intel, with much difficulty, to start operations in Israel.
They have been a great success.

Has Clinton Said Enough?; A Yes or No Will Do
"Have you ever had an extramarital affair, Governor?" a New Hampshire television reporter asked Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic presidential nominee.
As he has before, Mr.
Clinton sidestepped the question.
"Well," he said, "if I had, I wouldn't tell you."
We think Mr.
Clinton should give New Hampshire Democrats -- and the American electorate -- a simple yes or no.
The answer would reveal much about his character and electability.

Catering to Consumers' Ethnic Needs
In California, where waves of diverse and fast-growing immigrant groups have swept away any lingering notion of consumers as a homogeneous mass market, many companies have been forced to abandon their old approaches to selling their products and services.
And in their search for new strategies in the last few years, companies ranging from banks to television stations have learned one clear lesson: building business among a sometimes bewildering array of ethnic markets takes a lot more than just dubbing a few television commercials in Spanish or sponsoring a float in the local Chinese New Year's parade.


Merger of New York's Transit and City Police Is Still a Bad Idea; Better Subsidy Deal
To the Editor:
New York City Deputy Mayor Barbara J. Fife's "Give the City's Riders a Break" (Op-Ed, Jan. 11) illustrates the inequities of subsidy distribution between the commuter railroads and the Transit Authority with admirable clarity.
She points out that 90 percent of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's passengers rode Transit Authority subways and buses, and that farebox receipts support more than 60 percent of the Transit Authority's operating costs.

Preparing for a campaign in which abortion could become a powerful issue, President Bush today delivered a speech that showed no sign of flexibility in his position, and the Republican Party named a strong anti-abortion advocate as chairman of its platform committee.
One day after the Supreme Court agreed to hear a Pennsylvania case that could propel the abortion issue into the center of the Presidential campaign, Mr.
Bush addressed thousands of anti-abortion demonstrators by telephone from the Oval Office and commended efforts to overturn the Supreme Court decision, Roe v.
Wade, that made abortion a constitutional right 19 years ago today.

The Seattle-based Boeing, which paid $155 million for de Havilland in 1986 and has experienced losses totaling nearly $1 billion, will walk away with $100 million.

G.O.P. Leader to Back Benefits Extension
In the first test of the politics of the recession of the new Congressional session, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, is expected to testify Thursday in favor of another extension of unemployment insurance benefits.
But Mr.
Michel, who played a major role two months ago in getting the White House to compromise with Democrats on extensions of up to 20 weeks of benefits for people already out of work for at least half a year, is expected to tell a subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee that ways must be found to pay for the additional benefits instead of declaring a budget emergency that would permit them simply to increase the Federal deficit.


Steinbrenner In Suit Accord
George Steinbrenner is accustomed to doing things on a grand scale, but his effort to meet with Commissioner Fay Vincent is advancing inch by inch.

But, he added, no agreement has been signed and no stipulation has been filed in court.
He said he had expected the papers to be filed yesterday, but they were not.

In short, Joshua was a normal child.

After two hours of driving along desert roads, trekking through vaulting canyons and climbing rock embankments, Antonio Cubillo and his group of seven narcotics agents came to a small emerald-green valley.
On one side, almost out of view, was a crude hut with walls made of mud blocks.
A grimy sheepskin lay on the dirt floor.
Greasy pots and pans were stacked under a piece of tin, evidence of recent use.
The team confirmed that this was a stopping point for Bolivian Indians transporting cocaine to Chile, just the most recent sign of a disturbing trend in this northern border town.

The Treasury will intervene in the Government securities market whenever prices are distorted by a shortage of securities, whether a result of market forces or market manipulation, the three agencies that regulate the market said today.
The new policy for the $2.2 trillion market, where the Government borrows the money for its operations, is the most drastic item in a package of new rules, procedures and legislative changes put together by the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve in the wake of the illegal bidding scandal involving Salomon Brothers that was disclosed in August.

Boy Scouts Don't Qualify as Private Group
To the Editor:
In his Op-Ed article, "God and Boy in the Scouts" (Jan. 9), George H. Smith errs in thinking of the Boy Scouts of America as a purely private organization immune from legal challenge to its policy of religious discrimination.
In the Chicago Federal court challenge to the Scouts' discrimination against a nontheistic child, Welsh v.
Boy Scouts of America, to which Mr.
Smith did not refer and which is expected to be decided any day, the plaintiffs have made a very solid case that Boy Scouts of America is a "public accommodation" and thus not legally allowed to discriminate along religious lines.

There may be drugs and alcohol here, but drugs are scarce and treatment is available, so this is a good place to dry out.

But there is no fuel to fly the planes or to run the police cars, or to heat much of the city.
Estonians who long dreamed of resuming the independence interrupted by the Soviets a half-century ago are finding along with their Baltic neighbors in Lithuania and Latvia that their triumphs carry higher costs than generally anticipated..

In 1985, the conservative French food establishment in New York City went into a swivet when La Caravelle, that fortress of classical French cuisine, took on an American chef, Michael Romano.
It was the first time in memory that a non-Frenchman had run the kitchen of an old-line Gallic institution in the city, something like having a Pakistani as grand marshal of the St.

Only when the young Yankee vastly upgraded the menu did eyebrows lower.
Last year, La Caravelle's owner, Andre Jammet, took a giant step further from tradition by hiring a Japanese chef, Tadashi Ono.
Sushi on the gueridon?
Rice replacing pommes soufflee?
No such thing.

2 Fiery Personas, but No Sparks, in Courtroom
As an occasion to anticipate, it had the juicy appeal of a dinner party where two fiery invitees are to meet for the first time.
But in the end, it seemed to be a normal day at the office for both guests of honor, the Rev.
Al Sharpton and former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.
The two encountered each other across a crowded Manhattan courtroom yesterday as Mr.
Sharpton tried to head off a trial for income-tax evasion and Justice Marshall sat in judgment of his appeal.
The courtroom overflowed with admirers of both, some clearly and vocally present in support of Mr.
Sharpton, some in simple reverence for Justice Marshall and some more than likely just curious about what it would be like to have the two of them in the same air space.

Chief Executive Is Named At Municipal Bond Insurer
The Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, the subsidiary of the GE Capital Corporation that insures securities, principally municipal bonds, has named Ann C. Stern president and chief executive.
Ms.
Stern replaces Stephen Berger, who has been appointed executive vice president of GE Capital, a diversified financial services company based in Stamford, Conn., that is a division of the General Electric Company.
Before joining Financial Guaranty, Mr.
Berger spent five years as the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and before that was an investment banker with Odyssey Partners.


BUSH TO ASK MORE FOR BASE CLEANUPS
The Bush Administration has sharply increased its estimate of the cost of cleaning up pollution on military bases, and plans to ask Congress for an immediate increase of $1 billion for this purpose beyond the $2.7 billion already included in this year's military budget.
The Administration's request for funds to clean up the environment at military bases in the fiscal year 1993, which begins Oct. 1, has also been raised about $1 billion, to $3.7 billion, according to budget documents made public today.

Austin Named to Hall
TRACY AUSTIN's first reaction when she heard that she had been elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame at the age of 29 was to laugh.
"It came so out of the blue," Austin said at a Hall of Fame press luncheon yesterday in New York.
"A lot of athletes make their retirement, then after five years talk starts about the Hall of Fame. I never felt like I retired."
Injuries to her back and shoulder effectively retired Austin at age 21.
Austin, who was the youngest player to win the United States Open (16 years 9 months in 1979) is now the youngest to join 158 others already in the Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.

Moody's Review Of Upjohn's Debt
The Upjohn Company's $520 million in debt is under review for a possible downgrade, Moody's Investors Service said yesterday.
Some of the debt now bears an AA-2 rating.
Moody's said it would take a look at the pharmaceutical company's new products and evaluate how they would help offset expected sales declines of some major drugs whose patents expire next year.
Also under study will be the impact of some adverse developments reported about the company's Halcion sedative.
The rating service said Upjohn's commercial paper, rated Prime-1, was not under review.

Surprise! Surprise! One or Two Might Turn Up at the Metrodome
That line about not changing what brought you to the dance at first glance applies to both Washington and Buffalo in Super Bowl XXVI on Sunday.
The Redskins still want to run to set up their deep-strike passing game and on defense they begin and end with the principle of constantly applying pressure on the quarterback.
The Bills remain enamored of the no-huddle attack and defensively remain focused on preventing big plays and forcing mistakes on long drives.


Critic's Notebook; Toward a More Modern Modern
BIT by bit and month by month, the Museum of Modern Art has been undergoing a quiet transformation.
The change has been taking place at the heart of the institution -- in the second- and third-floor galleries of painting and sculpture, which for years have depicted modern art as an evolution beginning with Cezanne and culminating heroically in Abstract Expressionism.
That seamless interpretation, initiated by Alfred H. Barr Jr., founding director of the museum, and cultivated by William S. Rubin, former head of the department of painting and sculpture, unfolded as something authoritative and final.
Pop artists, Minimalists and all those who worked in the 1960's and later tended to be relegated to temporary quarters in the galleries of contemporary art.
Now Kirk Varnedoe, Mr.
Rubin's successor, is beginning to put his judicious imprint on the permanent collection.
He is extending it chronologically: for the first time, artists like Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol have a prominence equal to that given Abstract Expressionists like Willem de Kooning and Barnett Newman.


Bills Say They Get No Respect At All
Bruce Smith is angry that the Redskins don't respect the Bills' defense.
Thurman Thomas, the consensus selection for most valuable player this season, doesn't believe he gets enough respect or recognition and has resigned himself that he "will have to live with the title of best all-around back."
The Bills, a team with an inferiority complex so large they could rent out space, began constructing their us-against-the-world attitude today in preparation for Sunday's Super Bowl showdown with the Washington Redskins.
Buffalo has been installed as a 7-point underdog.

Senate Rejects Bush Plan to Aid The Poor Who Use Private Schools
The Senate dealt President Bush's education program a major defeat today by voting down a proposal to provide Federal aid for disadvantaged families that choose to send their children to parochial and other private schools.
Although the plan to spend $30 million in six regions would have had only a marginal effect on the nation's schools, it reopened the old debate over the separation of church and state.

CHRONICLE
It's not easy for television correspondents to find the time to socialize, so CONNIE COLLINS found her WNBC-TV colleagues more than willing to go to Sag Harbor, L.I., this weekend to help her with a school benefit.
"We're all so busy as reporters that it's rare we get together, even for retirement parties," she said the other day as she explained the "Meet the Media" weekend she had organized to aid the Waterfront School, where her two children are students.
The private school, which has 100 pupils age 3 to 10, lost its director and 40 pupils last year and faces a deficit that could reach $100,000 this year.


Drug Makers To Subsidize Prescriptions
In the face of Congressional attacks on high drug prices, one drug maker announced a program yesterday to provide free prescription drugs to poor and elderly patients who are unable to pay for them, while another drug company introduced a rebate plan.
The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company said it would donate 17 heart, blood-pressure and cholesterol-lowering drugs for use by patients whose doctors certified that they had no insurance or other means of paying.

For five hours the council had been holding a public hearing on a proposal to end its ban on the hiring of homosexuals as police officers, a prohibition that was left unchanged.

Unlike subway and bus passengers, cab users won't be paying more for their rides -- at least not right away.
The chairman of New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission said yesterday that he would not propose a taxi fare increase.
As he made the statement, more than 300 cabs drove through downtown and midtown Manhattan to protest even the possibility of an increase.


Corrections
A sampling of quotations yesterday, proposed by political strategists, satirists and others as sound bites likely to make the evening news in 1992, misstated the title of a book by P. J. O'Rourke.
It is "Republican Party Reptile." In some copies the sampling also referred erroneously, on second mention, to the contributor of one proposed sound bite.
The contribution -- "While George Bush putts, America goes down the hole" -- was from David Axelrod, a media consultant with the Clinton campaign, not a "Mr. Stone."


Market Place; Edgell May Show the Way To Heal Buyout Casualties
Edgell Communications was in many ways a prototypical leveraged buyout of the 1980's, forced by a raider into assuming so much debt that it soon collapsed.
Now Edgell is emerging from bankruptcy with a deal that may set a pattern for the 1990's.
The reorganization plan for Edgell, a magazine publisher, actively discriminates against the financiers who got Edgell into the mess in the first place, and, contrary to the wishes of some bondholders, it is forming a company with little debt that is likely to survive, if not prosper, even if the advertising recession persists for years.


Arms Makers Criticize Plan That Puts Focus on Research
The Bush Administration's proposal to shift the Pentagon's focus from building costly weapons to an approach revolving around laboratory research would be the most radical change in the military-industrial relationship since the birth of the modern arms business that mushroomed after World War II.
Military contractors said today that they had no firsthand knowledge of what the Administration was proposing, and even within the Pentagon it remained unclear which programs and companies might be most affected by the shift in policy.
But the contractors disputed the notion that the Pentagon could retain a vibrant arms industry without actually producing weapons, and they said the proposal could harm national security by leaving the nation unprepared to build sophisticated weapons in case of war.

The New Buy-American Auto Sweepstakes
Maybe it was President Bush's mixed success in Japan, or the Japanese official who said that American auto workers were lazy and illiterate.
Maybe it is the deep slump in Detroit.
But all of a sudden, companies around the United States are saying it would be good for America to be good to G.M., and they are offering inducements to their employees to buy from General Motors, Chrysler or Ford.
Some, groping to define just what constitutes an American car, are authorizing employees to buy autos made at the Honda plant in Marysville, Ohio, or Nissan's factory in Smyrna, Tenn.
But other companies have ruled out cars carrying American nameplates if they are manufactured in Canada or Japan.


Bush Weighs Health Benefits Tax And Cap on Medicaid Payments
As part of President Bush's effort to curb spending on health care, Administration officials want to limit how much Federal Medicaid payments can grow each year, and they want to impose a new tax on high-income people with health insurance purchased by employers.
Administration officials outlined their ideas at a meeting today with Republican senators and at a meeting on Tuesday with lobbyists for hospitals and health insurance companies.
Both proposals are subject to approval by Congress.

Vans Vie Illegally for New York Bus Riders
One every two minutes, the unmarked vans scoot into city bus stops along Flatbush Avenue, scooping up clumps of waiting commuters.
Sometimes, the vans simply cut the buses off in a brazen race to the curb.
As soon as one is pulled over by the police -- and they often are -- its passengers slip out and around the corner, where another idles out of sight of the law.
A shadow bus system has taken hold along many of the busiest immigrant avenues of Brooklyn and Queens.
Run by Caribbean immigrants, largely for Caribbean immigrants, the unlicensed vans are winning growing numbers of converts from the city's buses.
They are cheaper -- $1 to the new $1.25 official transit fare.
Their riders also swear that they are faster and more comfortable, never mind the legal inconveniences.


2 Greenwich Youths Die In a Murder-Suicide

Train Nonviolent Offenders at Former Bases; Treat Drug Convicts
To the Editor:
As the New York State budget deficit continues to grow, so does the state's prison population.
Correction Commissioner Thomas Coughlin has informed the Governor and the State Legislature that he needs the equivalent of eight 750-bed prisons next year.
Those prisons will ultimately cost the taxpayers of this state about a billion dollars.
But they don't have to be built.
The prison population in New York doesn't have to continue to skyrocket as it has during the last eight years, doubling to 58,000 now.
In recent years we have not been incarcerating primarily violent offenders but drug offenders, for whom treatment is more appropriate, more effective and far less costly.
In 1980 less than 1,000 drug offenders were sent to state prison, 11 percent of the total commitments.
By 1990 the number of drug offenders sent to state prison had grown to almost 11,000, 46 percent of the total commitments.


Review/Dance; Candle-Lit Renaissance To the Electric Present
The New York City Ballet's two varied programs on Sunday at the New York State Theater called attention to some of the many sources upon which choreographers can draw.
George Balanchine's "Monumentum Pro Gesualdo" acknowledges ballet's Renaissance origins.
Along with "Movements for Piano Orchestra," it is one of two ballets to music by Stravinsky that are almost always paired together.


12 Indicted On Violence In Drug Ring
Twelve people described as members of the "Supreme Team," which Federal authorities call a drug ring that terrorized southeastern Queens during the 1980's, were indicted yesterday in a string of violence that included at least nine murders.
Law-enforcement officials said the indictments involve one of the drug rings that, with organizations once led by Lorenzo (Fat Cat) Nichols and Howard (Pappy) Mason, have dominated crack distribution in southeastern Queens in the last decade.


Critics' Choices/Music; Chance to Be Daredevils
One sure-fire way to get new music performed is to dangle it in front of music students.
Although some are content to concentrate on Beethoven and Brahms, many are attracted both by the technical challenges that new music offers, and not least by the opportunity to play daredevil in public.
Though perceived by many as a bastion of musical conservatism, the Juilliard School actually fares quite well on the new-music front.
Its students play in the Museum of Modern Art's 20th-century Summergarden concerts every summer.
And the school's Focus week -- a series of free concerts started in 1985 as an outgrowth of Juilliard's Festival of Contemporary Music -- has become a highlight of the winter new-music calendar.


Train Nonviolent Offenders at Former Bases
To the Editor:
"Mr. Gingrich's Flawed Prison Math" (editorial, Jan. 7) criticizes Representative Newt Gingrich's proposal to build prisons on sites of former military bases because of the cost.
But it fails to explore a variation that could be accomplished with relatively limited expenditure.
Recently I suggested to Douglas Hansen, Federal director of base closure and utilization, that the conversion of military bases into low-security facilities for those convicted of less serious, nonviolent crimes could be effected quickly and at minimum cost.

On Stage, and Off
'Mad Forest,' Mad Theater
It is surely a sign of the times that a play can open in a small New York theater, get unanimous rave reviews, sell out its limited run and possibly disappear without even one producer making a call to move it.
Caryl Churchill's "Mad Forest" is the 11-character play about life in Romania after the fall of the Ceausescus.
It opened at New York Theater Workshop's Perry Street Theater on Dec. 4 and has become the sold-out equivalent Off Broadway of "The Phantom of the Opera."


Telephone Earnings Depressed
A.T.&amp; T., as well as three of the regional companies known as Baby Bells, posted depressed fourth-quarter and full-year earnings yesterday.
Their reports generally reflected furious competitive pressures to cut costs and employees, plus a slowdown in the growth of telephone calls attributed to the persistent economic recession.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the most widely held stock in the country, said its earnings dropped 21.5 percent in the fourth quarter and 83 percent for all of 1991.


TV Weekend; Mailer Plugs Himself Instead of His Book
You don't have to be as fascinated with Norman Mailer as Norman Mailer always has been or as David Frost seems to be to enjoy their conversation tonight.
Mr.
Mailer gives good talk.
There is a high intelligence operating along with a sometimes original perspective; at his most engaging, he manages to be off the wall and on the mark at the same time.
And his language has a way of rescuing his thoughts from drifting out into space.
"Talking With David Frost," at 9 P.M. on Channels 13 and 49, scarcely touches on the author as author.
You will hear no plug for his latest novel, "Harlot's Ghost." Instead, Mr.
Frost draws him out on some of the more notorious episodes of his eventful life, including the time he stabbed his wife and the part he played in the parole of Jack Henry Abbott, the criminal turned writer who murdered a young man soon after his release.
Mr.
Mailer is rueful.
As his 69th birthday approaches, he also seems somewhat chastened about other onetime enthusiasms, like promiscuous sex, violence, alcohol and marijuana.


Sounds Around Town
Pain and Heartbreak
Jimmy (Fastfingers) Dawkins, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, at 13th Street, Manhattan, (212) 255-7373.
Jimmy (Fastfingers) Dawkins is among the finest Chicago blues guitarists working: elemental and raw and intense.
He's also serious.
Instead of the standard good-time Saturday-night-party functionalism, he delivers pain and heartbreak.
His band, also from Chicago, finds the pleasure groove and stays there.
Shows tonight and tomorrow night start at 9; tickets are $12, and there is an $8 minimum at the tables.
Jazz Improvisation
Reunion Legacy Band, Condon's, 117 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 254-0960.
Featuring the saxophonist Gary Bartz, the trumpeter Charles Tolliver and the trombonist Grachan Moncur 3d in the front line, and a rhythm section of John Hicks, Mickey Bass and Victor Lewis, the Reunion Legacy Band brings together some of the better players who arrived in the late 1960's and early 70's.
Mr.
Bartz has been one of New York's consistently exciting improvisers for years, and his recent appearances have had him burning through material, mixing be-bop with Coltrane-esque phrases and more.
Mr.
Lewis is one of jazz's best drummers.
There is a $15 cover and a two-drink minimum; shows today through Sunday are at 9:30 P.M., 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.
There is no third set on Sunday.
To a Haitian Beat
Rara Machine, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, Manhattan, (212) 243-4940.
One of the next wave of Haitian bands in New York, Rara Machine does its best to mix older guitar-driven Haitian compas style with more modern, keyboard-driven sounds of zouk from Guadeloupe.
The band members also throw in American pop.
But the best music the band plays, oddly, is the older Haitian style, which is pure dance music, unadulterated by all the various pulls and tugs of the star system.
And like many of the younger bands, Rara Machine is interested in roots; it is not afraid to use carnival and voodoo rhythms in the music.
The show starts at 11 tonight; the cover charge is $17.

I Tried to Buy a U.S. Car (Sigh)
Before entering the car market in the spring for the first time in 15 years, I resolved to buy American -- a four-door Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.
After a broker and I expressed contempt for Americans who buy imports, I specified the features: antilock brakes, front-wheel drive, console gear shift, lumbar seats.
I asked about an airbag.
Not possible, he replied.
He told me that I would have to go to a larger car but that I didn't want an airbag: they pop open for no reason, causing horrible accidents, and it costs $1,000 each time to restuff them.
He would call the next day, he said, and I could be driving my new car by the weekend.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media; Brown Finds Political Calendar Full of Radio Days
It was 10 past the hour on a recent Wednesday morning in Manhattan, and Edmund G. Brown Jr., former Governor of California and contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination, was already into his second radio talk show of the day.
Mr.

A Military Revolt Fails To Oust Rulers in Zaire
The streets of the capital were deserted and tanks guarded the national broadcast center today after a group of rebel soldiers tried but failed to overthrow President Mobutu Sese Seko.
Two people were killed in the coup attempt, the Zairian military said.
The rebel soldiers seized the 20-story radio and television building late Wednesday and broadcast appeals for the ouster of Mr.
Mobutu, who has governed this central African country for 27 years.
The rebels also called for the resignation of Prime Minister Nguza Karl-i-Bond and the resumption of a pro-democracy conference that was canceled by Mr.
Nguza on Sunday.


Art in Review
Clyde Connell  Arthur Roger Gallery 136 Prince Street SoHo Through Feb. 1
Clyde Connell began making art when she was almost 50 years old -- she is now 91 -- and the contemporaries who most influenced her span several generations.
Adolph Gottlieb's paintings, new when she saw them, stirred her interest in pictographic forms; the example of Eva Hesse's work a few decades later encouraged her pursuit of sculpture in low-art materials.
In addition, Miss Connell points to the impact of black culture on her life, which she encountered as a plantation owner's daughter in Louisiana and as a civil rights advocate in the late 1950's.

Factors That Drive Up Detroit's Costs
To the Editor:
"The Excuse Maker" (editorial, Jan. 14), blaming Detroit's decline on poor product and high prices, is no longer justified.
Detroit has virtually caught up in quality and sells comparably equipped cars for less than the Japanese even though American car makers have substantially higher health care and pension costs because of an older work force.
Chrysler, for example, had 88,675 retired employees receiving benefits in 1990 compared with only 79,123 active employees.
Transplanted auto makers manufacture almost as many vehicles as Chrysler, with fewer than 1,000 retirees.


Review/Theater; A Physical Approach For an Israeli 'Hamlet'
To kill or not to kill, that is the question in Rina Yerushalmi's provocative adaptation of "Hamlet" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
In reassessing Shakespeare's text from her contemporary Israeli point of view, the director offers a Hamlet as a man of moral conviction.
From her perspective, no killing is justified even if the motive is revenge for fratricide or, for that matter, crimes against the state.
The Cameri Theater production, performed in Hebrew (retranslated into English over headsets) is running through Sunday as part of a festival entitled Israel: the Next Generation.
Miss Yerushalmi's theorizing permeates her staging, but for theatergoers the primary reason for sitting through this long and demanding "Hamlet" is the director's stylistic approach, which accents the physical over the oral.

Deadly Strain of Tuberculosis Is Spreading Fast, U.S. Finds
Particularly dangerous forms of tuberculosis have struck in 16 states, and the spread of the disease is out of control, Federal health officials said today.
Strains of the bacterium that are resistant to the standard anti-tuberculosis drugs have caused deadly outbreaks in 5 states and at least one case in 11 other states.
The more common form of the infection that responds to drug treatment is also spreading rapidly in many states.

Hess Loses $51.6 Million
The Amerada Hess Corporation said today that it had lost $51.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year, as lower crude prices and a big loss in refining hampered operations.
In the comparable period in 1990, net income totaled $234.2 million, or $2.90 a share.
Hess's revenues declined 33.3 percent, to $1.62 billion, from $2.43 billion in the 1990 period.
The nation's 16th-largest energy company, Hess supplies gasoline, jet fuel and other refined products along the East Coast from refineries in New Jersey and St.
Croix in the United States Virgin Islands.


2 Prison Escapees Charged in Robberies
Two recaptured escapees from a Connecticut prison were charged today with robbing a jewerly store and a food store in Bergen County while they were fugitives and staying at a motel in Spring Valley, in Rockland County, N.Y.
The men, Frank Vandever, 37 years old, and Ronald Rutan, 34, are accused of taking about $300 from a 7-Eleven convenience store in Montvale, N.J., just across the state line from Rockland County, shortly before midnight on Jan. 7, the Bergen County Prosecutor, John J. Fahy, said.
About seven hours earlier, the two entered a jewelry store in Rutherford, near the Meadowlands Sports Complex, with weapons and announced a holdup, Mr.
Fahy said.
But they fled empty-handed when they saw the owner push a silent alarm.
Mr.
Vandever, a transvestite and former stockbroker serving a 40-year prison term for killing a client who discovered he was stealing from his account, was caught Saturday afternoon at a shopping mall in Paramus.


U.S. Said to Give Deadline to North Korea
The United States has given North Korea a deadline for allowing inspections of its nuclear sites and will propose that an American air base be opened simultaneously for inspections, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported today.
The message was delivered in New York on Wednesday at the first high-level talks between the nations in four decades, the agency said.
There was no independent confirmation of the report.


3 Are Killed In Car Wreck In Queens
Two automobile accidents on rain-slick streets in Queens and Brooklyn left 3 people dead and 11 injured yesterday, the police said.
One of the dead and six of the injured were children.
In the more serious accident, which occurred at 12:30 P.M. in Middle Village, Queens, a young woman, her stepfather and her 3-year-old son were killed when the car the man was driving went out of control and skidded into oncoming traffic on Metropolitan Avenue at 80th Street, said a police spokeswoman, Officer Kim Royster.


CHRONICLE
After 39 consecutive years on radio and television, HOWARD COSELL is signing off the air.
He will retire next Friday from the two radio programs he does for ABC Radio: "Speaking of Sports," a two-minute program broadcast daily on about 200 stations nationwide, and "Speaking of Everything," a weekly half-hour program on about 100 stations.
Mr.
Cosell appeared on "Monday Night Football" on television from 1969 to 1983, and was a commentator on baseball and boxing.
He gave up all work that required traveling in 1985, three years after he stopped doing boxing commentary because of what he called "the hypocrisy and sleaziness of the boxing scene."


Rypien Sustains An Ankle Sprain
The Redskins got a scare at practice today when quarterback Mark Rypien sprained his right ankle a few minutes before the end of their two-hour practice.
The sprain isn't serious enough to keep Rypien out of practice Friday and he's expected to be fine for Sunday's game.
According to a pool report of the Redskins practice, Rypien injured the ankle when he dropped back to pass and the pocket collapsed around him and several players fell on him.
The quarterback limped out of the pile and threw down his helmet in disgust.
The ankle was taped and Rypien did not return.

Moscow Needs More Than a Gesture
The emergency food and medicine that 47 of the world's wealthiest nations have now promised to send to the former Soviet Union amount to a pittance.
But the gesture is important.
The citizens of the republics, terrified by the collapse of their economies, have at least been told that the West is in their corner.
Yet it would be tragic if the West stopped with yesterday's announcement.
The republics are engaged in a historic trek toward democracy and freer markets.
A successful traverse is not only vital to them but crucial to Western security.

Springsteen to Release 2 Albums at Once
If Guns 'n' Roses can release two albums at once, so can Bruce Springsteen.
In early spring, Mr.
Springsteen will release "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town," his first new albums since "Tunnel of Love" in 1987.
"I'm excited about being finished and am looking forward to getting out on the road," Mr.
Springsteen said in a statement.
"Human Touch," designated Mr.
Springsteen's 10th album, was recorded for Columbia largely in 1989-90 in Los Angeles studios with a band that includes Roy Bittan (formerly of the E Street Band, Mr. Springsteen's longtime backup group) on keyboards, Randy Jackson on bass and Jeff Porcaro on drums, along with guest singers including Bobby Hatfield of the Righteous Brothers and Sam Moore of Sam and Dave.
"Lucky Town," his 11th album, was recorded after most of human touch was complete in Mr.
Springsteen's home studio, also in Los Angeles.
Patti Scialfa, Mr.
Springsteen's wife, appears on both albums, as do Mr.
Bittan and Mr.
Jackson.

Mets and O'Brien Agree
The Mets reached agreement yesterday with catcher CHARLIE O'BRIEN on a one-year contract.
O'Brien, who had been seeking $450,000, avoided arbitration by settling for $370,000.
The 30-year-old catcher, who is expected to be a veteran backup for the rookie TODD HUNDLEY this season, hit .185 in 69 games for the Mets in 1991 and has not hit above .200 since 1989.
The Mets had filed an arbitration figure of $285,000, down from O'Brien's 1991 salary of $300,000.
GREG MADDUX also averted arbitration with the Cubs.
Maddux, a 15-game winner last season, accepted a $4.2 million salary, only $200,000 less than he had sought.
The Cubs had submitted $3.65 million for arbitration.
Maddux got $2,425,000 last year.


5 Hindu Militants Slain on Kashmir Trip
Gunmen disguised as police officers opened fire with AK-47's just north of here this afternoon on several busloads of political workers, killing 5 people and wounding 40, news agencies reported.
The buses were part of a caravan, led by the leader of India's right-wing opposition party, that was headed for the strife-torn Vale of Kashmir.
The caravan, led by Murli Manohar Joshi, president of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, left southern India on Dec. 11 for Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir.
There, Mr.
Joshi has said, he plans to unfurl the Indian flag on Sunday, India's national day, to demonstrate the unity of the country.


Foreign Affairs; Ousting Saddam or Trapping Bush
President Bush could be trapping himself into a lose-lose strategy of overthrowing Saddam Hussein in much the same way he cornered himself with the "jobs, jobs, jobs" strategy on his recent trip to Japan.
By insisting on jobs Japanese leaders could not give him, Mr.
Bush forced himself to bash and bow and ended up looking weak and failing.


Centel Says It's Studying Possible Sale
The Centel Corporation, one of the country's largest non-Bell telephone companies and one of the few large cellular telephone properties not owned by a giant phone company, said yesterday that because of increasing industry consolidation, it might put itself on the auction block.
As recently as Wednesday, the stock market valued Centel at just over $3 billion.
But yesterday, reacting to the news, the market bid up the company's share price by $9, to $46, raising Centel's value to nearly $4 billion.

Books of The Times; Why Transvestites Make Other People Nervous
Vested Interests  Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety  By Marjorie Garber  443 pages.
Illustrated.
Routledge. $35.
As the scholar Marjorie Garber points out in her fascinating new book, gender-bending images have proliferated throughout contemporary culture.
In the film "Tootsie," Dustin Hoffman tries to pass as a woman; in "Yentl," Barbra Streisand pretends to be a boy, and in "Victor/Victoria," Julie Andrews masquerades as a male transvestite.
"Dressed to Kill" and "The Silence of the Lambs" revolve around psychopathic killers, with a penchant for cross-dressing.
"The Sheltering Sky" shows Debra Winger, playing an American tourist, disguised as a young Arab boy.
And even "Bull Durham" features a rookie pitcher who wears a garter belt under his uniform.


On Any Given Sunday, Try Reading a Book
I don't care what the President said, there are at least 10 good reasons for not banning football, all of them on display this weekend.
1.
CIVIC PRIDE: Buffalo, we are told, is gripped by a Bills Bedlam as invigorating as the Mets Mania of 1969, which convinced New Yorkers that their health, educational and safety services would improve as dramatically as did their team.
If the Bills win, Buffalo will be saved, as was New York City.
It's a lot of pressure, especially for two players: Scott Norwood, the kicker, who should take the blame for plunging Buffalo into economic recession last year by missing a Super Bowl field goal that would have beaten the Giants; and Bruce Smith, the defensive end, who might have incited riots this week by threatening to leave town because of racist mail from fans who accused him of malingering after a knee injury.

Ex-Officer Found Guilty of $17,000 Bank Fraud
After deliberating for less than an hour, a Federal jury today found Robert C. Fioretti, a former New York City police officer, guilty of stealing $17,000 from his first wife's savings account in 1986, two months after she vanished.
Mr.
Fioretti, who is still the major suspect in the disappearance, sat motionless and stared blankly at the jury as the foreman read the guilty verdict.


Court Refuses Grand Jury Records
An appeals court yesterday rejected the Brooklyn District Attorney's request to release the secret grand jury minutes and records concerning the death of a 7-year-old black child in an automobile accident last year in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.
District Attorney Charles J. Hynes had sought the release of the material after a grand jury found no basis for criminal charges against Yosef Lifsh, a Hasidic man whose car struck and killed the child, Gavin Cato, on Aug. 19.
The incident touched off several days of violence in Crown Heights.

Clinton when she was working as a reporter for a television station in Little Rock.


Reviews/Art; William Wegman's Versatile Humor Survives Man Ray
For people who believe art and humor are strange bedfellows, a visit to the 20-year retrospective of William Wegman at the Whitney Museum of American Art may make them think again.
Mr.
Wegman, a Conceptual artist turned painter, is the art world's most amusing heavyweight lightweight -- and its premier dog photographer.
He is perhaps best known for turning a cooperative Weimaraner named Man Ray into a virtual art icon, something on the order of a canine Andy Warhol.


Implants and Halcion: the Shadow
The U.S. system for regulating and prescribing drugs and medical devices turns on trust that leading manufacturers will diligently test the safety of their products and honestly report the results.
That trust has now been shaken by disturbing evidence and accusations in recent liability suits against two major companies.
The suits challenged the safety of silicone gel breast implants, used to augment the breasts as a post-mastectomy or purely cosmetic procedure, and of Halcion, the world's most popular sleeping pill.
Of even broader importance, the suits charged that the companies withheld vital safety information or even misrepresented test results to make their products look safer than they were.
The suits have cast a shadow over the public's trust in not only these two health products but the entire corporate, regulatory and medical system that sanctioned their use.

Austria Offers Legislation to Make It Easier to Prosecute Neo-Nazis
The Austrian Government said today that it would propose creating a new law and amending an old one to make it easier to prosecute crimes such as advocating Nazi ideas or denying the Holocaust.
The proposals, which would substantially alter the law on Nazi activities for the first time since its enactment in 1945, comes after several months of increased neo-Nazi activity in Austria and the arrests in the last two weeks of nine suspected right-wing militants in four different incidents.


Coca-Cola Begins 24-Hour Campaign
Beginning at 6 this morning, Eastern time, the Coca-Cola Company will sell around the clock, in its first 24-hour global television advertising bombardment.

One commercial will run per hour, through 6 A.M. tomorrow, Eastern time, on both cable networks.


Officials Defend Policies To Protect Bond Market
Government officials who oversee the Treasury securities market asserted at a Senate committee hearing today that the changes they mandated on Wednesday would not disrupt trading and that they would move slowly before imposing the more contentious proposals.
A key goal of the regulators was to preserve the $2.2 trillion Treasury market as a place where speculators and investors can easily and quickly trade hundreds of millions of dollars of securities without causing a ripple effect on prices.


Let Pay of Absent Legislators Be Docked
To the Editor:
In his State of the State address, New York's Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo suggested that elected officials forfeit a day's pay for each day the budget is late (news article, Jan. 9).
In a different vein, during the Presidency of James Madison, the 14th session of Congress in 1815 passed an act for "this and every future Congress" mandating monetary penalties on absent members.
The text read "that in case any senator, representative or delegate shall not attend in his place at the day on which Congress shall convene, or shall absent himself before the close of the session, a deduction shall be made from the sum which would otherwise be allowed to him, in proportion to the time of his absence. . . ." Considering its absentee rate, this might not be a bad idea for New York's Legislature.
JAMES MARTIN Great Neck, L.I., Jan. 11, 1992


Ontario Is Placed On Credit Watch
The Province of Ontario and its state-owned utility, Ontario Hydro, have been placed on credit watch with negative implications by Standard &amp; Poor's Inc.
The long-term debt of the province and the power company now bears an AA+ rating.
The rating agency said statements from top government officials hadindicated the province might not follow a medium-term plan for fiscal adjustment that was outlined last year.
A weakened economy and financial pressures have hurt the ability of the province to cut its deficit.


Long-Term U.S. Issues Off Steeply
Treasury bond prices fell sharply and long-term interest rates rose further yesterday, as anxiety mounted among credit market participants about the coming battle in Washington over fiscal policy.

Attica Judge Issues Order; Jury Rebels
The judge in the long-running Attica trial, who left for a Caribbean vacation in the middle of deliberations last week, returned against his will today to find the jurors in rebellion.
In a highly unusual letter, the jurors accused the judge, John T. Elfvin, of pressuring them to rush to a verdict by ordering them to deliberate from 9 A.M. until 10 P.M. on weekdays and for seven hours a day on weekends.

With 700 Supporters Rallying Round, Birmingham Mayor Goes to Prison
After leading hundreds of his supporters, some of them draped in chains, from the 16th Street Baptist Church to the Federal courthouse in a scene evocative of the civil rights marches of the 1960's, Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. surrendered to United States marshals today under a contempt of court citation.
Mr.
Arrington, the first black Mayor of this city, submitted himself to the order of a Federal court after an emotional send-off by more than 700 of his supporters that started at the church.
It was where a bomb exploded on Sept. 15, 1963, taking the lives of four black children attending Sunday school.


Corrections
An article in The Living Section on Wednesday about new interest in fragrances that were popular in the 1960's misstated sales figures for musk oil at Kiehl's Since 1851, a pharmacy and natural cosmetics store in Manhattan.
Musk oil accounts for 60 percent of the store's sales of scented oils.


Drifter Is Chief Suspect In Florida Church Fires
A drifter who has been jailed for two months on loitering and trespassing charges is now the leading suspect in at least 12 church fires in Gainesville and Tennessee last year, the authorities say.
The 41-year-old suspect, Patrick Lee Frank, was seized on Nov. 13 in Ocala, 50 miles south of here, by a task force of local, state and Federal officers that is investigating about 30 suspicious fires at Florida churches, most of them in the north-central part of the state.

An S.&amp; L. Is Going Back to Basics
The savings and loan industry may be putting its notorious past behind it, but the legacy of its headlong rush into deregulation a decade ago continues to haunt some of the nation's largest savings institutions as they scramble to adapt to new regulations and cope with a weak economy.
Nowhere is that scrambling more evident than at GlenFed Inc., the parent of the nation's fourth-largest savings and loan.
Considered by many analysts and industry executives to be among the biggest question marks hanging over regulators, GlenFed is virtually reinventing itself in an effort to assure its survival.


MILITARY PROPOSES TO END PRODUCTION OF MOST NEW ARMS
In a shift that could save billions of dollars in future military spending, the Pentagon plans to suspend production of most new weapons after developing test models, senior Defense Department officials said today.
The production phase is by far the most expensive stage in buying a new weapons, consuming 35 to 45 percent of the total cost, while the research, design and development of test models, or prototypes, usually represents 20 to 25 percent.

At the Bar; Two Comedy Writers Aren't Laughing After Laurel and Hardy Routine Is a Flop in Court.
"Legal humor" may or may not be an oxymoron.
But attempts at it can prove costly, as two comedy writers thrust into the generally unfunny world of litigation recently learned.
For nearly four years now, E. J. Novak and Debra Studer, a husband-and-wife comedy-writing team, have been fighting NBC in court.
They assert that in six skits on "Saturday Night Live" -- involving, among others, Attila the Hun, Frankenstein and Lucky Luciano -- the program pirated material they had written years earlier.


Japanese Bid for Seattle Team Gets Baseball's Cold Shoulder
Reaching to Japan in an effort to keep the American national pastime alive in Seattle, this city's leaders announced today that a group led by Japanese investors had made an offer to buy the Seattle Mariners baseball team for $100 million.
The offer, by the family that founded Nintendo, the world's biggest video game company, is the first time that a potential buyer outside of North America has tried to buy a controlling interest in a major league baseball team.
The offer was presented here as the best chance to keep Jeff Smulyan, the team's current owner, from moving the club out of town.
As proposed, the Mariners would stay in Seattle and be under the control of a local board of directors; they could play some exhibition games in Japan, as well as develop a television following overseas.


Police Join Spectators At Fellow Officer's Trial
In a rare twist for a criminal trial, police officers are turning out strong here each morning to show their support for a defendant.
One of their own, Gary Spath, a white officer from Teaneck, is on trial, charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a black teen-ager, Phillip Pannell, in 1990.


Review/Photography; 4 Shows That Borrow From the Past in Technique and Treatment
Ever since photography was invented, artists have tried to bend it to their will, to impose their own stamp upon the seemingly neutral transcriptions of visual information that it provides.
By far the most popular way has been to try to make photographs look like something else, usually something with a greater cachet as art, whether oil paintings, watercolors or charcoal drawings.
But there's no such thing as an innocent process, as is demonstrated by four current shows, all of which by coincidence feature photographs by contemporary artists who use historical techniques.
Photographic methods, particularly those practiced widely in an earlier time, bring with them the ghosts of the periods they come from.
While the artists featured in the current shows -- the team of David McDermott and Peter McGough, at the Robert Miller Gallery; Sheila Metzner, at the International Center of Photography and at the James Danziger Gallery, and the French artist Gerard Traquandi, at the Zabriskie Gallery -- use a variety of processes to achieve different ends, they all exploit the links to the past that their techniques provide.


New York Asks U.S. Help In Tracking New TB Cases
Federal health officials are investigating a spate of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases among patients at a city hospital in Queens between late 1990 and June 1991.
Hospital officials said they had asked the Centers for Disease Control to investigate whether the cases had resulted from the patients' stays at the hospital, the City Hospital Center in Elmhurst.


Plan Offered By Holtzman For M.A.C.
New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman proposed yesterday that the city use $200 million from the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation to pay for streamlining the city government through technological changes and early-retirement programs.
In the Comptroller's annual speech to the City Council, she suggested that the corporation's funds "be used to create an efficiency bank" that would "finance programs that require an initial investment but can produce savings by making the city more efficient." Possible uses would be computerizing the city's welfare operations and installing two-way video systems for routine court appearances, she said.


Peruvian Rebels Assert Role In Downing of a U.S. Copter
Peruvian rebels claimed responsibility today for the downing of an American helicopter this month in a coca-producing region.
Three Americans aboard the helicopter were killed.
The Shining Path guerrilla movement said in a report in its underground newspaper that it used surface-to-air missiles to down the helicopter on Jan. 12.
The helicopter crashed as it was providing illumination for another helicopter that had made an emergency landing for repairs.


Approval of Japanese Bid to Buy Mariners Unlikely
Last year two of the Yankees' limited partners were looking to sell their shares of the club and were approached by some Japanese businessmen.
"They inquired with our office what our policy was on non-North American ownership," Steve Greenberg, baseball's deputy commissioner, said.
"They were told what the policy was and that's the last I heard of it."


Olden Tunes By Fiddlers With the Lilt Of the Celts
Back in the early days of this century, an Irish fiddle player named Michael Coleman left his home in County Sligo and came to America.
Coleman was revered in Sligo as one of the best fiddlers the county had ever produced; he was famous for jigs and reels, and his name was synonymous with a kind of local pride.
When Coleman arrived in New York, he was exposed to all kinds of ethnic music through the city's vast immigrant population: German polkas, Italian love songs, Harlem jazz.
These new forms must have had subtle influences on his playing.
Coleman became one of the first Irish musicians to make recordings.
His disks found their way back to County Sligo, where he was celebrated yet again for bringing Irish music to the land of opportunity.
Kevin Burke, a Celtic fiddle player celebrated in our own day for his work with the Bothy Band in the 1970's and the group Patrick Street in the late 80's, remembers hearing Michael Coleman while he was growing up.
Mr.
Burke's family hailed from County Sligo, and his father owned several of Coleman's records.
Tomorrow night, in a concert at Symphony Space with another traditional fiddler, Johnny Cunningham, Mr.
Burke will pay tribute to Coleman by playing one of his tunes.
"There's a piece of music that he recorded that I've always liked," Mr.
Burke said recently in a telephone interview from Portland, Ore., where he is now based.
"I've been dabbling with it for a long time. It's a very simple piece of music, a kind of hornpipe. I've put it on a new record I'm making, with a clarinet line underneath, so there's a slight jazz influence."


Art in Review
Carl Goldhagen  Rosa Esman Gallery 575 Broadway (at Prince Street) SoHo Through Feb. 8
By printing his photographs on sheets of lead wrapped around wood panels, Carl Goldhagen would seem to be trying to give his images a weighty presence.
What's curious, though, is how insubstantial many of the works here appear to be.
The tones of the black-and-white images are close to those of the lead itself, and Mr.
Goldhagen coats each piece with a shiny protective lacquer.
As a result, the images occupy a strangely ambiguous space, above the lead background but beneath the surface.
Occasionally, Mr.
Goldhagen will apply patches of gold leaf to the lead to highlight certain areas of an image.
In a photograph of a field of felled trees, for example, he uses an oval of gold to pick out a stump in the foreground.

Chinese Wait for Deaths of Their Leaders, Who Just Get Older
With China's octogenarian leaders now at least as fragile as they are powerful, the whispers in Beijing these days are of tracheotomies and cancer and eventually funerals.
There are signs that mortality may finally be catching up with some of those who run the country.
Of the eight or 10 powerful leaders who still exercise ultimate control over China, only one -- President Yang Shangkun, who is 85 years old -- still regularly appears in public and seems vigorous and alert.
The others are hardly ever seen these days even on television, and by most accounts they are very frail, and several may be near death.


Review/Film; Vintage Visconti, at Full Length
"Rocco and His Brothers" was shown as part of the 1991 New York Film Festival.
Following are excerpts from Vincent Canby's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 21.
The film, in Italian with English subtitles, opens today at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street in Manhattan.
Luchino Visconti's 1960 Italian epic, "Rocco and His Brothers," is a reminder of where films have come from and of how small and safe and self-addressed most contemporary movies are.
"Rocco" is not perfect, but even when it goes over the top in its theatricality, it excites the imagination with the kind of boldness that is the only hope of the future.

Sounds Around Town
Music and Comedy
Wiseguys, Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 758-2272.
The musical-comedy trio, originally from Dallas and made up of Jim Caruso, Fred Wells and Campbell Martin, is an impeccably smooth harmony ensemble whose wide grasp of musical style is matched by a sly humor.
The repertory of the Wiseguys runs from pop standards like "The Very Thought of You" to Maltby and Shire's comic ode to fitness fanaticism, "There's Nothing Like It," which the trio has expanded into an amusing theatrical set piece.
Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 9:15 and 11:15.
There is a $20 cover charge and a two-drink minimum. 2 Elegant Fellows
David Staller in "Noel and Cole," the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-6800.
David Staller, a baritone, identifies deeply with Noel Coward and Cole Porter, whose work he performs with hearty gusto in his one-man tribute to these two pillars of traditional songwriting elegance.
Sprinkled between the selections are biographical tidbits and astute reflections on the similarities and differences between the two and the ways in which they mirrored their times.
Shows are today and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M.; there is a $25 cover charge and a $10 beverage minimum.
New-Wave Songs
Marshall Crenshaw, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Manhattan, (212) 228-6300.
Marshall Crenshaw, whose finely honed new-wave songs brought the sensibility of Buddy Holly and the middle-period Beatles into the post-punk era, has yet to demonstrate mass appeal, and the reason is a mystery.
His songs are tuneful and smart, his output prolific, his sense of pop form masterly, his stage presence appealing.
Shows are at 8 and 11 tonight and tomorrow night, and tickets are $15.


CBS's Success in Super Bowl
CBS said yesterday that it had sold all but one of the 56 commercials that the network plans to run during its telecast of Super Bowl XXVI on Sunday.
"We've come this far in the last few days," said George Schweitzer, senior vice president of marketing and communications, referring to the five or six spots that were unsold earlier this week.
The game will be sold out by the time it goes on the air, he added.


Congressional Democrats Mount Offensive on Unemployment Pay
Democrats went on the offensive today over another extension of unemployment benefits and dared Republicans to delay the measure by objecting to its financing.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, appeared as a witness before a subcommittee of the panel and said that another 13 weeks of benefits for the long-term unemployed were essential now while the jobless waited for the economy to recover.

Freddie Bartholomew, a Hollywood child star whose name became synonymous with the proper, curly-haired little English boys he played in "David Copperfield" and "Little Lord Fauntleroy," died yesterday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla.
His age was variously reported as 69 and 70.
He lived in Bradenton, Fla.
Mr. Bartholomew died of emphysema, said his stepdaughter, Celia Paul of Manhattan.

President Bush and heads of government from the other 14 members of the United Nations Security Council will be asked at a meeting on Jan. 31 to commit themselves to reverse acts of aggression and affirm that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq must comply fully with their terms for ending the Persian Gulf war.
A draft of the declaration they plan to issue after the first ever summit meeting of the Council reaffirms its central role in maintaining world peace and says the world today has "the best chance for peace, security and development since the foundation of the United Nations" 47 years ago.

Running Hard for Office At Great Neck's Library
While we all eagerly await the momentarily meaningful results in New Hampshire's presidential primaries, there's another election campaign under way.
It too has a four-year term.
It pits a younger opponent against an incumbent.
The candidates call for change or continuity.
They point with pride or derision.
They acknowledge tough times, vowing fiscal responsibility.
Both profess an inability to understand why the other is running.
Both predict victory.
Both want to be a trustee of the Great Neck Library.
Now, helping to govern a library on Long Island's leafy North Shore is not a position guaranteeing national television exposure or a halftime interview during Sunday's Super Bowl.
In return for attending ill-attended public meetings each month, poring over boring budgets and occasionally encountering grumpy users unable to park by the door, a library trustee receives no pay.


Ashland Oil Shows Profit
Ashland Oil Inc. today reported earnings of $29.5 million, or 50 cents a share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, saying a good performance by its coal and motor oil operations helped it bounce back from an $10.8 million loss for the comparable period a year earlier.

Add to the list: "In the Heat of Passion."
It's about Lee (Ms. Kirkland), a sexually insatiable psychiatrist, and Charlie (Nick Corri), a good-looking young would-be actor whom she picks up at a gas station.
Lee becomes something of an obsession to Charlie.

Tale of Briton's Hanging May Get Epilogue
In 1968, 15 years after Derek Bentley was hanged for the slaying of a police officer, his family won permission to move his remains to a cemetery from the yard of the prison where he was executed and buried.
Anticipating the reburial, his father, William, had the words "Victim of British Justice" chiseled on a tombstone.
Twenty-four years later Iris Bentley, Derek's sister, continues to call her brother -- who at the time of the crime was a 19-year-old epileptic with an I.Q. of 66 -- a victim of the British justice system.
And she is joined by Members of Parliament, legal experts and many in the arts, who contend that the conviction, for having urged a friend to shoot the officer, was a mistake.
The Bentley case was one of several that led to the abolition of capital punishment in Britain in 1965.

In the work shown here, Jed Devine brings the lyrical style he has used to photograph odd scenes in the streets of New York City to what are essentially exercises in form.
Mr.
Devine sets up arrangements of classic still-life elements -- pears, teacups, bowls and the like -- and photographs them with a large-format camera.
The resulting images, printed in the soft black-and-white tones of the palladium process, have a delicate, contemplative beauty.


Dow Down By 29.07, To 3,226.74
Blue-chip stocks fell sharply yesterday in heavy trading, almost erasing Wednesday's gains, while the broader market was mixed.
Investors grew cautious, analysts said, as many earnings reports failed to justify the market's current lofty levels, and a weak bond market failed to offer support.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.07 points, to 3,226.74, as New York Stock Exchange volume reached 234.6 million shares traded, up from 228.1 million on Wednesday.
Losing issues outpaced gainers by 939 to 798, as the Big Board composite index slipped 1.30, to 228.89.

The premise is that they, and millions of other immigrants, are viewed with hostility and even fear mainly because they are Muslims.
The proposed solution is to create a European form of Islam that can coexist comfortably with Western societies shaped by Christian traditions.

Sports of The Times; Some Teams Succeed On Turmoil
Thurman Thomas is visibly seething because he feels undervalued.
Bruce Smith is also seething because some creeps have written him ugly letters.
They both look as if they would like to hit somebody.
In their line of work, this is not such a bad state of mind.
Even Joe Gibbs, the soft-spoken coach of Washington, acknowledges that this is a game in which "guys hit people in the mouth." It could be a grave mistake to label the Redskins as some harmonious band of colleagues, praying and playing together, while the other team is once again tagged as the Bickering Bills.


Johnson Is All-Star Amid More Questions
Hours after a medical officer with the Australian Olympic Committee said he would recommend that his team not play if Magic Johnson was on the court, the former Los Angeles Laker star, who has tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS, was selected as a starter for the National Basketball Association All-Star Game next month.
Johnson's election to the N.B.A.'s Western Conference team was certified yesterday when the league announced he was the fourth-leading vote-getter among Western Conference players and seventh over all in fan balloting.
He has said he intends to play.


Critics' Choices/Music; Sauve Enough to Slide
In "The Fabulous Bud E. Luv Show," an amusing tongue-in-cheek impersonation of the quintessential Las Vegas lounge singer, Robert Vickers, a mustachioed performer from San Francisco, portrays Bud Euripides Luvalopolis Jr., a fictional star who suggests a hybrid of Sonny Bono, Tony Orlando and Robert Goulet.
Wearing a phony smile, Bud E. runs through a repertory that ranges from lounge classics like "Mack the Knife" and "(You're) Having My Baby" to originals like "The Ballad of Sheila Cornucopia," the sleazy saga of his fifth marriage, to a former Miss Idaho.
Bud E. Luv ludicrously claims to have been on the scene wherever pop history has been made in the last 30 years.
His tribute to the "Woodchuck" festival includes a medley of Woodstock favorites, among them "Black Magic Marker" by "Suntana." Then there is his disco medley, which features "Kung Fu Fighting," "Boogie Oogie Oogie" and other monstrosities from the disco era.
Swiveling into the audience, he croons "Whole Lotta Love," by "Mr. Led Zeppelin," to a woman at ringside.


Review/Art; Masterpieces of the Pen, Including 2 Rembrandts
The current exhibition of "17th-Century Dutch Drawings" at the Pierpont Morgan Library comes from a single private collection for which "must see" is now the adjective of everyday use.
It burns small, and it burns slowly.
But in the memory, it blazes up.
The collection in question has been formed over the last 30 years by Maida and George Abrams.
That some of the drawings in it are "important" is evident at first sight.
Among them are two landscapes by Rembrandt that came up at Christie's in London in 1987 as part of a historic sale of drawings from Chatsworth, the home of the Dukes of Devonshire.
On that occasion, people who could hardly tell the front of an Old Master drawing from the back were fighting to get inside the door.


Redistricting Is Big Test for New Speaker

CIVIC PRIDE: Buffalo, we are told, is gripped by a Bills Bedlam as invigorating as the Mets Mania of 1969, which convinced New Yorkers that their health, educational and safety services would improve as dramatically as did their team.
If the Bills win, Buffalo will be saved, as was New York City.
It's a lot of pressure, especially for two players: Scott Norwood, the kicker, who should take the blame for plunging Buffalo into economic recession last year by missing a Super Bowl field goal that would have beaten the Giants; and Bruce Smith, the defensive end, who might have incited riots this week by threatening to leave town because of racist mail from fans who accused him of malingering after a knee injury.

After apologizing for the state of the economy and assuring Americans that he cares, President Bush this week has moved to a new phase of his re-election campaign in which he is trying to use the power of his incumbency to demonstrate that he is doing something about the nation's problems.
But underscoring the difficulties he faces in selling his policies to the entire country, the President is still struggling to gather members of his own party behind the economic growth package that he will present in the State of the Union Message next Tuesday.

Sol LeWitt  John Weber Gallery 142 Greene Street SoHo Through tomorrow
Sol LeWitt has derived a lot of mileage from geometry.
During the 1980's, he translated his earlier open-work cubic structures into frescolike wall paintings, and the 100 gouache-on-paper "drawings" in this show recall that work.
Each has a single cube form painted in the colors Mr.
LeWitt favors: darkened tones of blue, violet, yellow and red.
Although individually framed, the gouaches hanging together on the wall create the impression of a larger crystalline form, and as a group they have the lightness that has always given Mr.
LeWitt's rigorous images a measure of poetry.


Michael's Tenure With Yankees Grows Shakier
Yankee General Manager Gene Michael had what was described as a major argument this week with Daniel McCarthy, the club's managing partner, over Michael's signing of catcher Matt Nokes to a new contract, a person close to the Yankees said yesterday.
The dispute follows several instances in which George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, has harshly criticized Michael's decisions and raises new questions about Michael's job security.
McCarthy was upset over not being consulted Monday when Nokes was signed to a three-year $7.5 million contract and had wanted to fire the general manager, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
McCarthy had recently written a letter to Michael, the person said, and had informed him that every move the team made needed his approval, but Michael apparently defied the order in signing Nokes.

Review/Theater: The Visit; Revenge and Common Greed As the Root of Much Evil
NO one need go to the theater to learn that people will do anything for money.
So why does "The Visit," Friedrich Durrenmatt's drama about a town that sells its soul for a fortune, still exert a chilling grip nearly 35 years after it shook up genteel Eisenhower-era audiences who had been drawn to it by the star power of Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne?
The answers are there to be found in the Roundabout Theater Company's revival at the Criterion Center.
As directed by Edwin Sherin without benefit of star power but with lots of intelligence and a fiercely conceived lead performance by Jane Alexander, "The Visit" stands revealed as a small masterpiece of misanthropy, a play whose cynicism is so thickly layered that the greed driving the plot at its surface seems almost the least of its characters' sins.
For Durrenmatt, people, not money, are the root of all evil.

Economic Scene; Conservative Plea To Aid Ex-Soviets
AID to the former Soviet republics has become an ideological issue in this country, pitting those who say the United States and its partners should move rapidly and generously to provide assistance against those who would wait for them to collapse.
Favoring large-scale aid, according to the oversimplified version, are liberals, pragmatists and internationalists, and on the side opposing aid, at least until authoritarian structures are destroyed, root and branch, are conservatives, supply-siders and America Firsters.
But Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German Bundesbank, celebrated as a conservative and anti-inflationist around the world, strongly supports Western aid for the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Calling the Commonwealth a "fragile construction," Dr.
Schlesinger said last week that "the Western part of the world must help to stabilize these young states economically, with the goal of stabilizing them politically as well." He said "huge transfers of capital and know-how" would be necessary.

Israeli Military Panel Cancels Order to Deport a Palestinian
An army panel today recommended the canceling of an order to deport a Palestinian suspected of terrorist activities in the occupied territories, revoking one of 12 expulsions ordered this month by the Government.
The decision represents the first cancellation of a deportation order by the military since 1979.
A military spokesman said that the panel, which reviewed deportation orders against five Palestinians from the West Bank, recommended that Eyad Hani Abdul Raouf Joudeh be allowed to stay and that the decision was accepted by the area commander.

New York Sets Out on Legal Path To Allow Gay Irish Unit in Parade
Seeking to force the sponsors of New York City's St.
Patrick's Day Parade to admit a gay Irish group, the Dinkins administration yesterday charged the organizers with illegal discrimination and asked to have a city hearing officer oversee admission of marchers in a "non-discriminatory" way.
The complaint filed by the city's Human Rights Commission orders the local, state and national chapters of the Ancient Order of Hibernians before a commission hearing officer to answer charges that they broke the city's civil rights laws when the Manhattan chapter refused to allow the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization to march under its own banner last year.

U.S. Weighing Aid for Russian Nuclear Scientists
The Bush Administration is considering several plans to provide assistance to Russian nuclear scientists to keep them from accepting offers to work in developing nations trying to build weapons, the State Department said today.
Congressional leaders and private organizations concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons are pressing the Bush Administration to act quickly to provide assistance not only to prevent a brain drain but also to speed up the process of dismantling weapons in the former Soviet Union, a process that the scientists could assist.

Bush to Seek More Money for Major Space Missions
Telling an enthusiastic group of young people that even in hard times the public must invest in the future, President Bush said today that he would seek additional money for the space station, robot missions to the moon and other aerospace projects.
Mr.
Bush, surrounded by 23 space shuttle astronauts who were visiting Washington, told more than 100 cheering school children and their advisers, "America's destiny must include manned exploration" of space.


De Klerk Vows Black Vote on Reform
President F. W. de Klerk promised today to include South Africa's disfranchised black majority in any referendum on political change, but at the same time he reiterated that the white minority would have an opportunity to veto the terms of transition to a new nonracist constitution.
Mr. de Klerk appeared to suggest that while all South African would be permitted to vote in the referendum, a separate tally would be kept of the white votes, and that passage would require a majority of both these ballots and the overall total.


Review/Pop; Grand Gestures, Played Big
The composer Henry Threadgill, who is performing at the New Music Cafe, 380 Canal Street, through tonight, has etched out a particular world for himself.
More than anything, it's a theatrical world, obsessed with the grand gesture of passion, played big so as not to be missed in the bleacher seats.
His band, the Very Very Circus, features two tubas and two guitars, a French horn and drums along with Mr.
Threadgill's saxophone and flute; with the group, Mr.
Threadgill dives deep into extremity, where tango rhythms and histrionic melodies mesh with wild polyphony and dirges that seem to take days to work themselves out.
And the improvisations, keyed to the material, seem as if they were being chased by death itself, they're so concerned with the expression of deeply felt emotions.

Dow Gains 6, but Drops 32 for Week
Stock prices rose slightly yesterday, again showing resiliency after a hefty pullback on Thursday.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 3,232.78, up 6.04 points for the day but off 32.20 for the week.
Peter Labe, chief investment strategist for Josepthal, Lyon &amp; Ross, saw yesterday's market as biding its time.
"The current consolidation and pullback is good," he said, "but the market would like to see what the President has to say on Jan. 28, when he gives the State of the Union Message, and what the budget looks like on the 29th when it is submitted. Until then, the market is likely to mill around waiting for fresh information."  Volume Is Heavy
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 214.6 million shares, down from 234.6 million on Thursday, as the number of stocks up on the day outpaced declining issues by 908 to 813.
The Big Board composite was up 0.28, to 229.17.

Company Settles Lawsuit Over Exposure to Dioxin
The Diamond Shamrock Company, which for years has fought claims that it recklessly endangered the health of workers and residents near a former herbicide plant by exposing them to dioxin, has agreed to a $1 million settlement.
The settlement came unexpectedly Thursday during the seventh week of a trial before Judge Leo Yanoff of Superior Court.
Lawyers for the company and for 72 plaintiffs, including residents of the area, families of former workers and contractors who worked at the site, said they were satisfied with the settlement, even though the case fell short of proving a link between dioxin and health problems among the workers.

United Nations officials presided over talks between the six guerrillas and Salvadoran military and Government leaders about the logistics of the guerrillas' emergence from clandestine life under the terms of an amnesty adopted unanimously by the Legislative Assembly just before midnight Thursday.

The Government has compiled a list of four decades of accidents at the Hanford nuclear bomb plant that presents the most detailed overview yet of personnel errors, management failures and inattention to detail at the huge complex in Washington State.
Although the Department of Energy, which released the report late Thursday, said it contained "absolutely no new information," an environmental group said that many of the accidents had not been disclosed before.
They include fires, explosions, fuel melting, safety system failures, and various incidents that exposed workers to radiation and dangerous chemicals.

Washington and Redskins: What More Perfect Union?
Washington is a city that takes itself ever so seriously, never more than when it is being seriously silly.
For the past two weeks, the capital of the free world has taken on the trappings of a raucous oversized high school, and the colors of patriotism are no longer red, white and blue, but burgundy and gold.
The Washington Redskins (a Mann, a Monk and some hogs) face the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl on Sunday.
And the suits are getting ready to take off their pinstripes, put on their pig snouts and party.
Stripping and Singing
Like absolutely everything else that happens in Washington, this is important.
Why?
Because winning is considered an art form here, and that means winners are artists, and, hey, where else would someone express his devotion to art by offering to sing "Hail to the Redskins" upside down with his head in a toilet while two women in cheerleader outfits strip down to their Redskins underwear?

Parading Bigotry
The Irish of New York were the victims of discrimination for centuries.
That makes it all the more deplorable that organizers of the St.
Patrick's Day Parade, the Ancient Order of the Hibernians, persist in preventing a gay Irish organization from marching as a unit in the celebration on March 17.
Their obstinate bias insults a proud history and a proud city.
But what should the city government do about it?
Mayor David Dinkins hoped to get the gay group included by authorizing the state chapter of the Hibernians to sponsor the parade instead of the traditional Manhattan chapter.
But the state chapter proved as bigoted as the local.
So now the city Human Rights Commission has filed a complaint charging that the sponsors of last year's parade discriminated by banning the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization.
The commission may also seek an injunction ordering inclusion of the gay organization pending resolution of its complaint.


8 Embark on Quest for Challenger's Slot
It is the eve of racing for eight international sailing teams that have challenged the San Diego Yacht Club for the America's Cup.
On Saturday they will begin a three-month series of trial races to determine which will win the Louis Vuitton Cup for the right to challenge the United States in the America's Cup final in May.
For many of them, just getting here was a victory.
In the last month, attrition claimed two teams, the Slovenians and the Russians.
Over the last four years, plans for a dozen other cup efforts collapsed under the burden of costs that are approaching $100 million for a campaign.


Your Taxes; Mail-Order Rule Likely to Change
If the Justices' questioning during oral arguments is any guide to their ultimate decision, the Supreme Court seems likely to overturn a landmark 1967 ruling and decide this spring that a state may levy sales taxes on mail-order merchandise from outside its borders.
The Court seemed quite unsympathetic on Wednesday to the position of the Quill Corporation, an Illinois-based marketer of office supplies.
Its sales in North Dakota have produced a high-stakes challenge to the principle that states could not make tax collectors of companies with no physical presence within their borders.

THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House; BUSH CAMP RENEWS STRATEGY DEBATE
The Bush campaign today made public a television commercial apologizing to New Hampshire voters for their economic pain, but at the White House a renewed debate broke out over the general tone of President Bush's re-election campaign.
The discussion of whether Mr.
Bush should be conciliatory or combative in his State of the Union Message next Tuesday began Thursday night when his two top political aides, Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, and Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman, summoned about 20 Republicans to a strategy session.
No Change in Program
Bush aides have been saying all week that the address to Congress would kick off the election effort by offering Mr.
Bush's plan to fix the economy.
But Mr.
Skinner and Mr.
Teeter found themselves bombarded with demands that Mr.
Bush also use his speech to declare war on the Democrats in Congress.

The Government had issued an edict on banning political speeches at Friday prayers.

But tonight, the talk from the coach apparently worked in remarkable fashion as the Devils ambushed the Capitals from the outset and skated off with a 5-2 triumph.


Prudential Rating Cut By Moody's
Moody's downgraded its rating by a notch yesterday on the Prudential Insurance Company of America's financial strength, in an expression of concern over the insurer's holdings in commercial real estate and junk bonds.
Moody's Investors Service, in downgrading Prudential from Aaa, or "exceptional," to Aa1, or the best of the service's "excellent" ratings, stressed the continued stability and strength of the mutual insurance giant.
With more than $169 billion in assets, it is the nation's largest life insurer.
And one leading consumer advocate said the rating change should not cause policyholders undue worry.


6th Quarterly Loss in Row for Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments Inc. today reported its sixth consecutive quarterly loss, but analysts said cost-cutting moves taken last year by the giant chip maker appeared to be working.
The company trimmed 6,000 jobs through voluntary retirement, layoffs, attrition and assets sales during 1991 for a one-time charge of $240 million, leading to a loss of $85 million.
But the $220 million in yearly savings projected today by Jerry R. Junkins, chairman and chief executive, contributed to a small operating profit of $12 million in the fourth quarter.


Head of National Gallery Is Retiring
J.
Carter Brown, who oversaw the transformation of the National Gallery of Art in Washington from a specialized museum into one of the largest art institutions in the country, announced yesterday that he would retire as its director by the end of the year.
Only the third director in the National Gallery's 50-year history, he has held the position for 22 years.
"I've spent over half my life at the National Gallery," said Mr.
Brown, who joined the gallery as assistant director in 1961 and is now 57 years old.
"I only started thinking about retirement a month ago. The time just seemed right." The museum has just come to the end of a yearlong celebration of its 50th anniversary and has also just concluded "Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration," one of the largest of the lavish exhibitions for which Mr.
Brown's tenure was known.

Jerusalem Judge Orders Mosque to Lower Voice
The enduring conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has had many battlegrounds over the decades, and it shifted this week to still a new one: decibel levels.
To an Israeli court, the loudspeakers on the minaret of a Jerusalem mosque blare too much.
When the muezzin there calls the faithful to prayer five times a day, a judge ruled on Thursday, he unduly disturbs the peace of Jews living nearby.

From Russia with Hope: In America to Stay - A special report; Seeking Shelter in U.S. After the Soviet Storm
The scene is familiar.
Immigrants are crowded onto cots in the back rooms of a church in Los Angeles.
But these are not Latin Americans escaping poverty and civil war.
They are penniless Russians, members of a new wave of underground immigrants to the United States.
Sheltered under the gold domes of the Protection of the Holy Virgin, a Russian Orthodox church in Hollywood, are what might pass for a cross section of Russian society: a jeweler, an actress, a merchant seaman, a would-be fashion model, a Soviet Army deserter and a mother who fled with her three children from an outbreak of ethnic violence.

"It's his way of pumping himself up for the game."

With the American economy continuing to languish, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is expected to enlist France and some other industrial countries to call on Germany's central bank to reduce its interest rates.


Quarterback to Keep His Irish Up
Quarterback RICK MIRER announced yesterday that he would return to Notre Dame for his senior season.
Mirer, who had been considering giving up his final year of eligibility to enter the National Football League draft, said there were "a lot of things" that went into his decision.
"Most importantly, I just wanted to be happy, and I think I could be happy here another year," Mirer said.
"I've got another shot at helping us try to win a national championship, and that's something I've thought about since I was being recruited back in 1988 when Notre Dame won it all," he said.


Patents; Aggressive Defender Branches Out
Depending on one's perspective, Texas Instruments Inc. has achieved either fame or notoriety for the aggressive way it pursues its intellectual property rights.
By demanding unusually high royalty payments from companies it contends are using its patented technologies, and suing those that fail to comply, the company has turned its patents into a profit center.
Now, Melvin Sharp, who devised and executed Texas Instruments' patent program, hopes to spread his gospel to other high-tech corporations both in the United States and abroad.
Texas Instruments' highest-ranking patent lawyer until taking early retirement in October, Mr.
Sharp last week announced the formation of a consulting service to help companies wishing to take greater advantage of their intellectual property portfolios.

Unfriendly Skies for Libya
For too long, terrorism in the air has been a crime without punishment for outlaw states that shelter wanted suspects.
This week, for the first time, the United Nations held Libya directly accountable for its involvement in "deeply disturbing" terrorist acts.
It is a salutary precedent that can hasten the end of a dirty business.
A unanimous Security Council has ordered Libya to surrender for trial two agents accused of planting the bomb that blew up Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
If Col.
Muammar al-Qaddafi refuses to comply, he risks a painful follow-up: the severing of international air links to Libya and a U.N. embargo on sales of aircraft and spare parts.

Policeman Charged in Gun Sale
During a nine-month undercover operation, the police say they bought pistols and automatic weapons from the manager and an employee of a Brooklyn shoe store.

P.O.W.'s Questioned by K.G.B. in Vietnam
To the Editor:
I was bewildered on reading your Jan. 13 editorial on the continuing question of U.S. servicemen missing in action in Vietnam.
At no time in the United States or anywhere else did I say, as you assert, that American prisoners of war were interrogated by K.G.B. agents
inside
the Soviet Union years after the war was over.
The public record shows that all my statements on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue related to a handful of American servicemen who were interviewed by Soviet intelligence officers in Vietnam, not in the Soviet Union.


Just Who Can Raise the Shades and Peek Into Private Matters?
Louis Brandeis once said that "privacy is the most comprehensive of all rights."
Now the issue of privacy is inspiring new and heated debate.
On the one hand, credit bureaus and others who gather personal data about consumers say that they must have it to provide lenders and employers with information they need to do business.
On the other are those who say that too much private information about the way people live, spend and save is becoming available to industry and government without the knowledge of the individuals involved.
This, they say, infringes people's rights.

Tisch Proposal to Rescue Macy Falls Through as Creditor Balks
Laurence A. Tisch's proposal to rescue R. H. Macy &amp; Company from its crushing debt load at the expense of its creditors fell through late yesterday when a major creditor refused to agree to his terms.
In a statement issued last evening, the Loews Corporation, of which Mr.
Tisch is chairman and chief executive, said it had ended its discussions to buy Macy.
"The Loews proposal was conditioned upon the cooperation of various other parties," the statement said, "but was rejected by a major creditor of Macy's this afternoon."


Feud Threatens Yankee Deal
There were signs yesterday that the argument earlier this week between General Manager Gene Michael and Daniel McCarthy, the managing general partner, may be sending the Yankees back into another period of stagnation.
The Yankees recently offered a one-year contract to Eric King, a free agent right-hander.
That was before McCarthy had a disagreement with Michael about not being consulted when Matt Nokes was signed to a three-year, $7.5 million deal Monday.
McCarthy had earlier written Michael a letter telling him he had to approve every move the team made and Michael apparently defied the order in signing Nokes.

Making a Puzzle of the Political Pie
Come take a bird's-eye view of the proposed new boundaries for the 11th State Senate District in Queens, which a bird could certainly traverse far more easily than any legislator could.
The bird would gaze down on a district essentially chopped into three separate pieces.
Now legally, the legislative mapmakers cannot chop a district into three pieces.
So the Republicans, who created this district, have connected the parts with a tiny strip of sand under the Throgs Neck Bridge, some beach front along the East River and a concrete shoulder of the Cross-Island Parkway, where nobody actually lives.
The Republicans who drew the map have thus satisfied, it would appear, the technical requirement that all the land in the district be contiguous.

How Do You Stop Coleman? Nights Like This, You Don't
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Jan. 24 --
Although he played for 29 minutes in the Nets' 123-117 victory over the Miami Heat, Nets center Sam Bowie was having a lot more fun doing what most of the 11,415 fans who paid their way into Byrne Meadowlands Arena were doing tonight -- watching Derrick Coleman and Mookie Blaylock.
Coleman, last year's National Basketball Association rookie of the year, put on a masterful show, scoring a game-high 38 points and showing some nifty moves in the paint -- despite being double- and triple-teamed by the Heat.
The forward from Syracuse hit on his first 11 shots, not missing until the waning moments of the third period as he finished with 14 baskets in 18 attempts.
Coleman was also 10 of 12 from the free-throw line.

Police Say 2 Connecticut Youths Made Suicide Tape Before Dying
Two teen-agers found shot to death Wednesday in a park here recorded a tape shortly before they died saying they were depressed and had decided to kill themselves, the police said today.
The tape, found in a portable tape player next to the bodies, included about 40 minutes of commentary from David F. Lippmann and Alan P. Ritch Jr., the 17-year-old Greenwich High School seniors whose deaths have been declared a murder-suicide by investigators.
The deaths have jolted this Fairfield County suburb, where violence is rare.


Review/Music; A Tribute as Personal as the Singer
In the best of all possible worlds, great artists would receive tributes according to their accomplishments.
Egotistical divas would be given hosannas by claques of fans.
Self-important virtuoso pianists would be hailed in cascades of octaves and vigorous ovations.
And a singer like Jan DeGaetani -- well, a singer like Jan DeGaetani would receive a musical tribute like the one offered on Thursday night at the Kathryn Bache Miller Theater at Columbia University.
In this first of three scheduled concerts dedicated to the memory of the beloved mezzo-soprano, who died of leukemia in 1989 at the age of 56, the tribute seemed an extension of DeGaetani's musical gifts.
Her repertory ranged from Bach to Stephen Foster, from Elizabethan love songs to Elliott Carter.
She was so devoted to her craft that she spent a year of study before performing Schoenberg's "Pierrot Lunaire" in 1959.


Motorists and Neighborhoods Brace for Gowanus Rebuilding
Motorists who use the Gowanus Expressway and residents of the western Brooklyn neighborhoods it cuts through could get their first sour taste this weekend of an effort to rebuild a four-mile elevated stretch of the busy and battered highway over the next 10 years.
The project is expected to cause traffic chaos, especially after 1993, as large segments of the expressway are shut down and traffic is diverted to local streets from Bay Ridge to Brooklyn Heights.

Call by Victims' Gang Helps End Kidnapping
The notorious Ghost Shadows gang, which has long terrorized Chinatown with extortion, murder and skulduggery and has never had a soft spot for the law, called the police when two of its members were kidnapped in a $98,000 drug deal that went awry -- and was rewarded with a swift, efficient rescue, the police said yesterday.
Investigators said the strange episode occurred in Queens Thursday night when three Ghost Shadows tried to sell bogus heroin to six Dominican men in an apartment in Jackson Heights.
One Ghost Shadow was allowed to leave with some of the money, but before the two others could get away, the ruse was discovered and the two Ghost Shadows were seized at gunpoint, the police said.


Cases of Tuberculosis Surge, But Risk of Contagion Is Low
Although Federal health officials say tuberculosis is out of control in the United States, they take some comfort in the fact that the disease is not particularly contagious.
Certainly the spread of tuberculosis is not comparable to that of influenza, which can strike in explosive epidemics.
Nor is it like outbreaks of measles and chicken pox, in which sick people can infect nearly everyone they meet who has not already had the disease.

Scientist Rebuts Officer on Teaneck Youth's Last Actions
A forensic scientist testified today that Phillip Pannell was facing Officer Gary Spath of the Teaneck police, and not turning toward him, when the policeman's first shot pierced the lower left corner of the youth's parka.
The scientist, Lucien C. Haag, was the only witness today in Officer Spath's manslaughter trial in Superior Court here, and he testified about his chemical, laser-beam and other tests concerning the first shot.
Self-Defense Is Claimed
His work, including a videotaped simulation of Mr.
Pannell's movements just before he was killed, are major elements in the state's efforts to prove that the 16-year-old was trying to surrender, with his left arm or both arms raised, when Officer Spath shot him in April 1990.

The meeting between Mr.

An Internal Revenue Service ruling that corporate contributions will be considered taxable income if they serve as advertising sent shock waves through the art world when it was made public last month.
Many arts organizations, which have increasingly relied on corporate grants to help make up for the loss of government support in recent years, expressed fears that if the new rules were applied to their sponsored events, they could lose up to 34 percent of the grants in taxes.

After months of Congressionally imposed delays, the Bush Administration is preparing to release $10 million in military aid to Peru as the first stage of a new policy to help the Peruvian military fight drug traffickers and Maoist guerrillas involved in the cocaine trade.
The program marks a change after more than two decades of limited relations between Washington and the Peruvian military, which had long retained close ties to the Soviet Union and which had recently been criticized by Administration officials for its dismal record on human rights.

Possibility of Orion Bid
The Turner Broadcasting System is considering a bid for the Orion Pictures Corporation, according to several movie industry executives.
But a spokesman for Turner declined to comment yesterday.
Turner's chairman, Ted Turner, had previously considered bidding for Orion as well as MGM/UA Entertainment.
Warner Brothers, the film division of Time Warner Inc., is also looking at Orion, but only to see if there are any assets that the movie studio might want to buy.
One entertainment industry analyst who declined to be named said that a deal in which Turner would buy Orion and then strike a deal for Orion's pictures to be distributed theatrically by Warner would make a certain amount of sense since it would allow Turner to cut Orion's overhead.
A Time Warner spokesman declined to comment.

Cars That Sell Themselves? Indeed
In an industry suffering from a severe slump, the Swanson Chrysler Plymouth car dealership here has found that the best way to improve sales is to get rid of the sales staff, cut the prices and let car buyers shop in peace.
No haggling.
No pressure.
Just a yellow sign on each car's windshield, with a take-it-or-leave-it price.
The strategy, introduced at the start of the year, has yielded 71 sales this month, as of today, compared with 72 for all of January last year.
George A. Fischell, the general manager, expects Swanson to sell more than 100 cars this month, the best performance in more than a year but about the volume a midsize dealership like this one normally expects.
With expenses down, the month's profits on vehicle sales will be three times those of January 1991.

Seedlings are 6 to 18 inches tall and are packaged in small or large numbers, for the suburban gardener or the big landowner.
How to Order Call the municipal or county office of environmental conservation.
Ask for seedling sales information, where to obtain an order form and the nearest pickup points.
The forestry offices in state capitals and cooperative extension services at colleges also have information.
Not all programs are state-run.

Buying Almost-New Cars With a Past
When car dealers started selling current-model cars used by rental companies like Hertz and Avis at sharp discounts, many consumers found attractive deals.
But those deals are about to become less attractive.
Why?
Because car manufacturers, hurt by poor new-car sales, are requiring the rental companies to keep the cars longer before they buy them back for resale.
Under this system, instituted by manufacturers a few years ago to move excess stock by boosting fleet sales, the car makers sell the repurchased rental cars at auction to dealers, who in turn offer them to the public as used cars.

CAROL THATCHER, the 38-year-old daughter of MARGARET THATCHER, the former Prime Minister of Britain, has said she has no desire to have children and that watching her mother juggle career and family probably had something to do with her decision.
Ms.
Thatcher, who is single, made her comments on a British television program called "The Truth About Women," which was broadcast on Thursday morning.
She was one of several women who discussed their choice of career over children.
Margaret Thatcher was elected to Parliament when her children, twins Carol and Mark, were 6 years old.
"It was an erratic life," said Ms.
Thatcher, who is a freelance journalist.
"She was in the constituency on weekends and often in the House of Commmons in the evenings, so it wasn't a sort of 9 to 5 working mum."

Profits Drop for Exxon, Mobil and Chevron
Three of the nation's biggest oil companies reported lower earnings today for the fourth quarter, as world crude prices slumped and the recession slowed sales of gasoline and other refined products.
Exxon said net income fell 28.2 percent.
Mobil reported an earnings decline of 38.5 percent.
And Chevron, which took a one-time charge against earnings of $244 million, said net income plunged 93.8 percent.


Uproar Over Mariners Creates Bad Feeling in Japan
Government officials and businessmen in Japan reacted with indignation and puzzlement today over reports that American baseball officials were opposed to the offer by a Japanese company to help buy the Seattle Mariners.
Hiroshi Yamauchi, president of the Nintendo Company, which has teamed up with a group of businessmen in Washington State to bid for the Mariners, held a news conference today to explain the offer.
He said he might be forced to withdraw the bid if the public reaction was negative.
Although the reception in Seattle was favorable, the baseball commissioner, Fay Vincent, said it was unlikely the bid would be approved.

To Keep Memories, Keep Ellis Island Buildings; For Conference Center
To the Editor:
The most important thing to realize when considering the plan to restore and convert the old hospital buildings on Ellis Island into a conference center is that a decision has been made to let these buildings rot and decay.
The proposal to restore the principal hospital buildings, and to introduce a completely new use for them, means changing this decision.


Nynex Settles On Payments
The Federal Communications Commission, the nation's chief regulator of telephone companies, said yesterday that it had reached a consent decree with the Nynex Corporation, involving a $500,000 penalty for Nynex's disputed payment into a fund to help telephone companies in mostly rural areas.
The commission said Nynex's main units, New York Telephone and New England Telephone and Telegraph, had paid too much into a fund run by the National Exchange Carrier Association, which helps stabilize local rates by subsidizing generally rural carriers.


Two Shows Will Lower Some Prices
The producers of "The Will Rogers Follies," the musical that won the Tony Award last year, announced yesterday that they were lowering the price of some seats to $20.
There will also be a new low ticket price of $7.50 -- the cost of many Manhattan movie admissions -- for "Grand Hotel" when the musical moves from the Martin Beck Theater to the Gershwin Theater on Feb. 4.
The recession was cited for both moves.

Woman Gets $7 Million in Airline Discrimination Suit
A woman who was passed over for promotion to the job of general manager of American Airlines' LaGuardia Airport office has won $7.1 million in compensatory and punitive damages for sex, age and disability discrimination.
The woman, Barbara L. Sogg, said yesterday that she hoped the verdict would help shatter the glass ceiling that has kept women from many of the top jobs in large corporations.


Critic's Notebook; A Play That Improves as It Travels From Place to Place
Caryl Churchill's "Mad Forest" is a rare case of a play that has been strengthened in its travels from theater to theater.
Despite that fact and the enthusiasm of the audience, which has filled the Perry Street Theater ever since the work opened in December, "Mad Forest" is scheduled to end its brief run next weekend.
Producers have apparently been unable to arrange for a move to another, equally hospitable theater.
But the premature closing should not detract from the process that brought the play to this highly creative point.
With a quick response to a volatile political situation, Miss Churchill used her playwright's art to clarify the chaos of the Romanian uprising.
Several months after the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was executed for crimes against the state, Miss Churchill, the director Mark Wing-Davey and a group of students from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London went on a fact-finding mission to Romania.
On location, they explored the roots and the effects of the revolution that toppled the Ceausescu Government from power.
By the summer of 1990, Miss Churchill had completed "Mad Forest," and the students performed it in London for a limited run.


Death, Life and the Presidency
It's no surprise that three of the five Democratic candidates for President now say they support the death penalty as heartily as any law-and-order Republican.
Their positions are misguided, and there is good reason to wonder if they have spoken too soon.
With large popular majorities angry about crime and perceiving execution as an appropriate response, Bill Clinton, Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas find it easy to embrace the death penalty.
Mr.
Clinton goes out of his way to point out that, as Governor of Arkansas, he has presided over two executions.
Yesterday he left the campaign trail to preside over a third, a man given a lethal injection for murdering a police officer, though brain damage suffered when the man shot himself during capture raised questions about his competence to stand trial.


Crossland Is Seized By the U.S.
The slumping New York real estate market claimed another victim yesterday afternoon when Federal banking regulators closed Crossland Savings, the city's largest savings bank.
One hour and $1.2 billion later, they opened the new Crossland Federal Savings Bank, with new management and Federal ownership.
The seizure has no immediate effect on the bank's 400,000 customers.
Depositors at Crossland, which is based in Brooklyn and has 44 branches in the New York area, continue to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for up to $100,000 an account.
Interest rates on certificates of deposit will not be changed until the deposits mature.
Notes Taped to the Doors
Notices taped to the doors of all Crossland branches at 3 P.M. told customers of the change, and said branches that normally stayed open late on Fridays would reopen at 4 P.M.
About a dozen branches in Nassau County that are open on Saturdays will also be open today for business as usual.


Review/Ballet; What Jerome Robbins Heard in Bach
Jerome Robbins's "Goldberg Variations" is a contemporary experimental work, not in spite of its celebrated Bach score but because of it.
The choreography, performed by the New York City Ballet on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater, continued to reveal its richness of detail.
Twenty years after its premiere, the ballet has been unavoidably affected by several generations of cast changes; the duets among the principals, most notably, now have a more emotional resonance.
But the work as a whole continues to operate on several levels of meaning.
At heart, it is Mr.
Robbins's response to the music.
Essentially, he hears music in unexpected ways, preferring the surprising dramatic image to a strict visual counterpart to the score's structure.


Cuba Rally Scheduled Despite Security Concerns
A rally by a group calling for improved ties with Cuba, canceled by the Jacob Javits Convention Center because of fears of possible violence and overcrowding, will go on as scheduled today.
At a hearing yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, convention center officials came to an agreement with the group on security measures to avoid clashes with anti-Castro protesters and possible crowd control problems.

Australian Boycott 'Completely False'
An Australian official has discredited a doctor who suggested that the Australian team should boycott Olympic basketball games next summer against the United States if MAGIC JOHNSON plays.
Dr.
BRIAN SANDO, the senior medical director of the Australian Olympic Federation's basketball program, said on Wednesday that Johnson, who has tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS, presented a realistic threat of passing on the infection.
He recommended that the Australian team not play against Johnson.


Dinkins Aide Fails to Repay $158,000
Mayor David N. Dinkins's campaign finance chairman, who resigned last week after it was discovered that he took $158,000 from a campaign bank account, has not yet returned the money, as he promised to do, because the Internal Revenue Service has placed a lien on his bank account for unpaid taxes, campaign officials said yesterday.
Harold Ickes, counsel to the Committee for David Dinkins II, said that Arnold Biegen, the finance chairman, wrote the campaign a personal check for the missing money last week but that the check has not cleared Bank Leumi because the I.R.S. has frozen Mr.
Biegen's account, seeking $300,000 in back taxes for 1979, 1980 and 1981.

Finks Hospitalized Because of Chest Pain
JIM FINKS, the New Orleans Saints' general manager, was hospitalized in Minneapolis yesterday after experiencing chest pains.
Finks, 64 years old, was listed in serious, but stable condition at Abbott Northwestern Hospital's cardiac intensive unit, said GLORIA O'CONNELL, a hospital spokeswoman.
Finks was playing indoor tennis with JERRY BURNS, the former Minnesota Vikings coach; JAYE DYER, the Vikings' senior vice president, and WILL McDONOUGH, an NBC-TV analyst.
About 40 minutes into the game, Finks began experiencing chest pains.
He was expected to undergo an angiogram last night to determine the condition of his arteries and heart. (AP)

New Russian Budget Is Strong Medicine
Under attack from all sides for policies that have let prices soar, the Russian Government won reluctant approval today for the next phase of its painful economic reforms: a budget that it says is virtually deficit-free but calls for deep spending cuts and higher taxes.
As Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of the reforms, explained to Parliament today, a balanced budget and a tight monetary policy are necessary if Russia is to keep hyperinflation at bay and pull itself toward a market economy.


Bills Think the Carpet Could Be Magic
Buffalo has been designated the home team for Super Bowl XXVI.
And while the Bills might not have the most fans at the game, they will probably have a true home-field advantage over the Redskins Sunday because they are more accustomed to artificial turf.
The Bills play on artificial turf at Rich Stadium in Buffalo, and have compiled a 11-2 record, including playoff games, on the surface this season and a 4-1 record on grass.
The Redskins play on grass at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington and compiled a 12-1 record on grass and a 4-1 record on turf, including playoff games.

If a runner with six inches left to complete a mile race produced a 100-yard sprint, everyone would laugh at him.
But bridge players sometimes do something comparable and draw cheers.
Dick Goldman of Franklin Square, L.I., reached a stage last year at which he needed 6/100 of a master point to reach life master rank.
He then won a Regional Stratified Pairs in Cambridge, Mass., earning 39.6 points, or 660 times as many as he needed.
He was playing with his wife, Flo Goldman, and they were partners again on the diagramed deal.
It was played at the Grand Club in Franklin Square, and gave him a chance, with the East cards, to show his defensive skill.

Blast Destroys Kashmir Police Base as Hindu Caravan Stirs Tension
Separatist rebels set off a bomb today inside the police headquarters of Kashmir's capital, Srinagar, wounding at least eight senior police officials and killing a constable, the authorities said.
The explosion occurred as a caravan of Hindus led by a right-wing political leader moved toward Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim region gripped by a guerrilla war against Indian domination.


Bandits Shoot 3 in Queens In Cash Theft
Two armored-car guards delivering money to a crowded check-cashing store in Queens walked into an ambush yesterday morning, as masked gunmen opened fire, killing one of them, critically injuring the other and also wounding a 78-year-old woman walking by, the police said.
The four robbers escaped with $82,000 in a canvas money bag as one guard crumpled to the floor and the other, shot in the face, staggered across the street and collapsed on the sidewalk, the police and witnesses said.

Review/Film; Trying to Set a Trap For a Serial Rapist
The realm of the exploitation thriller is not normally the province of feminist film makers, but in "Love Crimes" Lizzie Borden attempts some subversive inroads.
She tells the story of David Hanover (Patrick Bergin), a sex offender masquerading as a famous fashion photographer, and of the efforts of an Atlanta assistant district attorney named Dana Greenway (Sean Young) to catch him at his own game.
Ordinarily this might mean a little routine voyeurism and a lot of lurid cat-and-mousing.
But Ms.
Borden, director of the militant 1983 "Born in Flames" and the more effective 1987 "Working Girls," tries to frame this seemingly conventional thriller in more thoughtful ways.
It's unusual, when the prosecutor finally confronts the criminal, to find her asking him "Why do you hate women?" It's also unusual to find a female character asking "Do you always have to be so patronizing?" while discussing the case in bed with her boss.


No Salute For Trading Sax
To the Sports Editor:
Let's hear a giant Bronx cheer for the Yankee management for its thoroughly predictable ingratitude in trading away Steve Sax.
The class and loyalty with which he responded to the indignities heaped on him last season made it clear that he was not the Yankees' sort of player.
He didn't run crying to the press when his position was snatched away from him.
He didn't even run away and sulk; he talked graciously and reasonably about an unreasonable situation.
And he simply played harder and let his numbers show who really belonged at second base.

Father Knows Best
MY WIFE AND I MET IN THE MID-60'S ON A SKI slope in the Catskills.
I was a chef in Manhattan during the week, but on winter weekends I worked as a ski instructor at Hunter Mountain.
Gloria, already a good skier and a member of the ski patrol, arranged for a private lesson -- not, as I found out later, to improve her skiing but to meet me.
Always the dedicated teacher, I followed her down the hill, beating on the backs of her legs with my ski poles and calling out: "Bend your knees! Look down the hill!" At the end of the lesson, I left her standing on the hill with instructions to "just go out and practice and learn what I've taught you!" Luckily, she signed up for a second lesson, and we exchanged phone numbers afterward.

U.S. Secretly Gave Aid to Iraq Early in Its War Against Iran
The Reagan Administration secretly decided to provide highly classified intelligence to Iraq in the spring of 1982 -- more than two years earlier than previously disclosed -- while also permitting the sale of American-made arms to Baghdad in a successful effort to help President Saddam Hussein avert imminent defeat in the war with Iran, former intelligence and State Department officials say.
The American decision to lend crucial help to Baghdad so early in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war came after American intelligence agencies warned that Iraq was on the verge of being overrun by Iran, whose army was bolstered the year before by covert shipments of American-made weapons.


Flying as a Courier: Bit Bumpy but the Price Is Right
WHEN you say "courier travel," everyone listens.
In days of tight money and high-priced air tickets, it is a topic of intense interest.
In courier travel, people who are free to go by themselves on a flexible schedule, sometimes with little notice, can get to many places in Europe, South America and Asia for relatively little money -- $250 round trip to Amsterdam or $399 round trip to Singapore, for example -- by acting as escorts for parcels, usually financial documents, that use up their checked baggage allowance.
The qualifications are modest: You must be at least 21 (there is no upper age limit, although you must be physically able) and you need a valid passport, good coping skills and knowledge of how to get around in your departure city.
You must be able to pay for your ticket, any departure taxes, a long-distance phone call or two and possibly also put up a refundable deposit of $100 or $200.
Then you will need to be able to do a lot of phoning to courier companies or brokers to get what you want.
The closer to flight time, the cheaper the flight.
At the last hour, you might get a free trip.
One organization estimates that 25,000 courier flights take off from the United States annually from six big cities, and at least a dozen companies that use or book couriers in the New York area are listed in directories.


Spanish Class At the Source
AFTER several fast-paced trips to Europe, which left me exhausted, spending a vacation studying a language in its native land looked like a welcome change.
For several weeks last July, my clothes could rest peacefully on their hangers as I became not a tourist passing through, but a resident of a small European town with ample time to explore the area.
Best of all, I would be improving my skill in the language of the country, in this case, Spain.
Three years of high school Spanish and several adult education courses had left me with only everyday phrases like "buenos dias" and "adios" and simple sentences using the infinitive or present tense.

Landmark in Westport Adapts to a New Era
SINCE Porky Manero's opened in 1959, generations of Westport residents have grown up on the restaurant's steaks and prime ribs.
But times and tastes change.
Last year the restaurant was sold by the granddaughter of the founder, and the new owners decided to adapt the town landmark to more contemporary fashions in food.
The free-standing building, near the Westport railroad station, looks the same.
But the cavernous main room has been lightened through natural oak wainscoting and upper wall paneling.
Pale pink wallpaper matches the paper place mats that have replaced white tablecloths.
Other changes include a plethora of hanging artificial plants as well as ceiling-fan lights, laminated tabletops edged in oak and booths along the walls.
The high-ceilinged room is lighter and airier now, befitting the current, more casual menu.
The large dining room is the nonsmoking section; the smaller raised area of booths along the right-hand side is reserved for smokers.
A gas fire (unfortunately emitting a gas aroma on our visits) burns in the fieldstone fireplace at the end of the main room.


Performances by County Residents
WESTCHESTER not only provides performing venues for distinguished visitors but also for many other artists -- some of them equally renowned -- who either teach here or have chosen to make the county their home.
Today at 3 P.M. a recital at the Hoff-Barthelson School in Scarsdale finds Gail Isenberg, a faculty pianist and White Plains resident, welcoming two guest musicians, the cellist Eleanor Howells of Croton and the pianist Jody Wise of Weehawken, N.J.
Poulenc's Sonata for Two Pianos is one of the promised pieces; another is the Debussy Cello Sonata.
There will also be shorter works by Bach, Granados, Ravel and Barber.

Her father is a retired member of the New York Stock Exchange.


Seles Pounds Fernandez In Final
Nobody plays tennis tag better than Monica Seles.
She rarely loses because it's rare that anyone can catch her.

Stamps
Collectors interested in postal history tend to focus on the outside of envelopes rather than what is inside.
They study the stamps, which reflect the postal fees in effect at the time; the cancellations and perhaps the address.
They also trace any other markings that indicate, for example, what route the letter traveled, whether it was delayed in an accident or whether it was censored in wartime.
The reason for this focus is a simple reflection of reality: Whatever was once in the envelope was what the recipient was interested in -- a personal letter, business correspondence -- and thus the enclosure did not come onto the philatelic market, nor did it circulate among collectors.

Claude Chabrol had nine; Martin Scorsese, eight.
Now the "Something New" part is on, and the week that started on Wednesday and ends Tuesday is being devoted to just one feature-length film: "There's Nothing Out There," the first commercial release by Rolfe Kanefsky, who wrote it at 18 and filmed it at 20.


B.W.I.A. Takes Birds Out of Air
B.W.I.A.
International Airways, the Caribbean airline, has banned the transportation of parrots and other exotic birds and endangered or threatened wildlife species from all its flights.
The ban is in response to a report from the United States Government Environmental Investigation Agency that says that millions of wild birds destined for the cage-bird business perish because of inadequate care and shock from travel.
The Humane Society of the United States reports that of more than 7 million birds imported into the country during the past decade 1.2 million died in transit or in quarantine. (The Department of Agriculture quarantines birds for 30 days then examines them and returns them to the country of origin if they are not healthy. Some exotic birds carry disease that can infect domestic poultry.)
B.W.I.A., which is the national airline of Trinidad and Tobago, flies to Miami, New York and Toronto and six gateways in Europe as well as islands in the Caribbean.

This homely anecdote convulsed audiences because (a) children do it all too often in real life, and (b) the verb

Layers for Looks and Comfort on Skis
The challenge for the avid skier is to stay warm and have fun.
But today's skiers are much more fashion-conscious than they used to be, so thick, bulky skiwear is taking a back seat to stylish thinner clothing with layered insulation.
"Thickness does not always mean warmth," said Don Schwamb, the executive vice president of Bogner of America in Manhattan.
Mr.
Schwamb said the company's ski jackets rely on layers to create air pockets that keep the cold air from getting in and body heat from getting out.
Such styling gets rid of the old "puffy" look.

At Work; As Seen From a Wheelchair
Like a lot of people, George Biechler takes his physical confidence pretty much for granted.
So when the vice president of the Meridien Bank sat down in a wheelchair recently to get a sense of how it would feel to maneuver through the world from a sitting position, he looked a little tight around the mouth.
Mr.
Biechler pushed clumsily through a swinging door and made it past one orange traffic cone before banking off a wall and onto the rim of a second cone.
Freeing himself, he wheeled with furious inefficiency for the swinging door.
"I haven't felt that uncomfortable since I got my learner's permit when I was 16," he said later, watching another Meridien employee carom between wall and traffic cone.


Dr. Charnley Is to Wed J. L. Humber
Mr. and Mrs.
Bailey W. Brown of Mount Vernon, N.Y., have announced the engagement of her daughter Dr.
Gail Charnley to Jeffrey Lee Humber, a son of John N. Humber and the late Clara G. Humber of Ludlow, Mass.
A May wedding is planned.
Dr.
Charnley, 35 years old, graduated from Wellesley College and has a Ph.D. in toxicology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
She is a consultant in toxicology in the Washington area.
Her stepfather retired as the president of Erkins Studios in New York, a garden ornament firm.
She is a daughter also of the late Louis E. Charnley Jr., a partner in the New York law firm of Reid &amp; Priest.


POWER STRUGGLE
Sam Howe Verhovek's article "Power Struggle" (Jan. 12) reports activists' distortions of the impact of hydropower development in northwestern Quebec.
Such accounts bestow undue status on certain apocryphal stories and flawed analogies that are promoted heavily by opponents of the project.
Writing about them makes good copy; basing decisions on them would make bad public policy.
Hydro-Quebec is committed to sound environmental practices in its hydropower developments.
That is why the company has agreed to participate in five independent environmental-impact analyses to be conducted by the Canadian and Quebec Governments in conjunction with the Crees and the Inuits.
Canada and Quebec have rigorous environmental-impact analysis processes that are equal to or better than any in the world.


Making a Difference; Bombardier Snares de Havilland . . .  . . . While Cessna Goes To Textron
Russell W. Meyer Jr. has spent more than 10,000 hours at the controls of airplanes, and nearly 17 years at the controls of the Cessna Aircraft Company.
Last week, the General Dynamics Corporation sold Cessna to Textron Inc. for $600 million, but Cessna is expected to remain on the same heading, and Mr.
Meyer is expected to remain in the pilot's seat.
Cessna is the world's largest manufacturer of general aviation aircraft.
For most of its 65-year history, the Wichita-based company concentrated on making small piston-driven propeller aircraft.
But since becoming chief executive in 1975, Mr.
Meyer has largely refocused the company on business jets, and Cessna now controls more than half of that market. (Although the company stopped making small piston-engine planes in the early 1980's, it estimates that it built half of all the planes now flying in the Western Hemisphere.)


Texas Remapping Battle Heats Up, Threatening to Singe the Democrats
Historically, the redistricting of the Texas Senate has been a private, gentlemanly affair in which members of that small, powerful chamber looked after their own, but this year it has turned into a raucous political battle that some participants liken to a civil war.
The dispute is increasingly dividing people not just along party lines but also by class and ethnic interests, and it seems likely that the United States Supreme Court will decide the outcome.


A Director Who Pursues the Inner Demons
Volker Schlondorff already had an Oscar-winning movie, "The Tin Drum" (1979), to his credit when he moved to New York, following the trail of many young German directors to the United States.
But by 1987 his career had stalled, his marriage to the film maker Margarethe von Trotta was breaking up, and at the age of 47 he could perhaps identify with a man like Walter Faber.
At this point the idea came to him of filming the tale of Faber, the antihero created in 1959 by the Swiss novelist Max Frisch.
The character is a Swiss engineer who inadvertently falls into a tryst with his own daughter, conceived two decades before, during a love affair with a young Jewish woman in Zurich.
The film, "Voyager," opens in New York on Friday.


Ideas &amp; Trends; 'Just Following Orders': Nuremberg, Now Berlin
NUREMBERG the city is far removed from Berlin -- 230 miles or so from the spot where, nearly two years ago, 20-year-old Chris Geoffroy was riddled with bullets when he ventured onto the "death strip" that once divided the city.
But Nuremberg the legal principle -- the axiom that underlings accused of crimes cannot hide behind claims that they were following the orders of others -- loomed large last week in a Berlin courtroom, where two East German border guards were convicted of killing Mr.
Geoffroy, the last of more than 200 people killed while attempting to flee from East to West.
Judge Theodor Seidel brushed aside arguments that what the guards had done was proper, even required, under the old East German law.
"Not everything that is legal is right," he declared.
"At the end of the 20th century, no one has the right to turn off his conscience when it comes to killing people on the orders of the authorities." He sentenced Ingo Heinrich, the 27-year-old guard who fired the fatal shot, to three and a half years in prison, more than the prosecution had sought.
A second guard received a two-year suspended sentence; two others were acquitted.


GOING BY THE NUMBERS
Devra Lee Davis, a resident scholar at the National Academy of Sciences, points out that the 20- year war on cancer has failed, and her work is attacked as "boring" and "old junk" by some of the scientists who developed strategy for that failed war ("Going by the Numbers," by Karen Wright, Dec. 15).
Perhaps it is time for these experts to step aside to allow a new emphasis on prevention to emerge.
If nothing else, our 20-year search for a cancer cure tells us this: prevention is the only solution we can afford.

A Perfect Match
People like to say that for every woman who wants to marry, there's a man out there who will make the perfect husband.
It follows that for every bride-to-be, there's a dress with her name on it -- and perhaps it will be easier to find than the man.
The dreamy bride will choose a romantic confection of tulle and lace; the no-nonsense bride might opt for a tailored suit.
Whatever her inclination, a bride can spend anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. (Or if she wants to wear her mother's dress, she can get away with the price of a dressmaker.)
Wedding dresses run the gamut, but one thing remains constant: rarely will attention be focused so closely on a woman's appearance as on her wedding day.
It is not only the dress but the details -- a pair of opera-length gloves, a dramatic choker, a whimsical hat -- that make the difference between a beautiful bride and a memorable one.


If You Need a Reason, Now's the Time for Meatloaf
RECESSION, nostalgia and winter invariably add up to meatloaf on the menu.
The traditional meatloaf is made with ground beef or a combination of beef, veal and pork.
But today, it might even mean turkey loaf or chicken loaf as the anti-cholesterol squad keeps careful watch over the diet.
Regardless of the basic material, meatloaves are appealing because they are easy to prepare and to eat.
They can be made in advance and reheated or sliced and used in sandwiches.
What is pate but a sophisticated meatloaf?
Like pates, meatloaf mixtures can be wrapped in pastry or used to stuff vegetables.
Meatloaf mixtures can even be formed into small, individual portions.

Bangkok Delays
To the Editor: We are giving the 1991 award for needlessly long queuing to the immigration officials at Bangkok's International Airport.
Recently, my family and I arrived at Bangkok at midnight after a long flight from Narita Airport in Tokyo.
All the passengers were then assembled, as is usual, in long lines, to pass through immigration.
Perhaps we all resembled the "most wanted" on Interpol's list, or maybe the new junta is wary of travelers, but it was 90 minutes before this planeload of exhausted passengers finally cleared.
Our inspector, I noted over an hour's time, spent a great deal of time leafing through each passport and immigration card, looking up toward the ceiling and checking to his right and left to see how the other inspectors were doing.

But Look Out For a Blizzard From Buffalo
Last year, the worst thing the Buffalo Bills did was destroy the Los Angeles Raiders, 51-3, in the American Football Conference title game.
That gave everyone the idea that they had a monster offense that couldn't be stopped by the Giants in Super Bowl XXV.
This year, Buffalo barely beat Denver, 10-7, in the A.F.C. championship game, with its vaunted offense scoring only three points.
Now, as the Bills prepare to take on the Redskins this evening in Super Bowl XXVI, everyone thinks Buffalo suddenly has a flawed offense that will crumble at the first sign of a blitz.


The 'Village'
To the Editor:
I was delighted to read on Jan. 5 your "Art for Artist's Sake" item in your Gazetteer accompanying your Greenwich Village article on Jan. 5.
The item dealt with Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's activities in the Village, specifically the founding in 1930 of the first museum anywhere dedicated to 20th century American art, the Whitney Museum of American Art.
The buildings at 8, 10, 12 and 14 West Eighth Street, and the buildings which backed on them on MacDougal Alley, comprised the Whitney Museum.

The 1992 Campaign: Republicans; Bush Camp's Primary Fear: A Buchanan Moral Victory
Ron Christian, the tax collector in the town of Peterborough, southwest of here, is a George Bush man.
He voted for Mr.
Bush in the Republican Presidential primary four years ago and thinks he has "done a good job in the White House," especially in the Persian Gulf war.
"But I'd be interested in hearing what George is going to do for the economy in general and for jobs in New England in particular," he said on Friday as he waited for Barbara Bush to arrive for a campaign appearance.
"He let the economy get away from him. It's important for him to come to New Hampshire to talk to us."


Q.&amp; A.: Ralph J. Marino; Where Republicans Stand On Hate-Crime Legislation
THE recent rash of hate crimes in New York City, including a pair of incidents in which black and Hispanic children were smeared with white paint, has revived the debate over the bias-related crime bill first proposed five years ago by Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo.
The bill would create a new classification of crime and specific penalties for any violent or intimidating act committed with the intent of denying civil rights to an individual or group.


Jennifer Medoff To Wed in July
Mr. and Mrs.
Bernard Medoff of Port Washington, L.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Jennifer Ellen Medoff, to Gregory Lawrence Klainberg, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Attacking the Messenger
To the Editor:
As an accountant with more than 20 years of experience in the insurance industry, I read "The Bad Boy of Insurance Ratings" with considerable interest.

Technology Gives the Charts a Fresh Spin
It was an odd mixture of country crooners, rappers and punk revivalists who worked their way to the top of the Billboard charts in 1991.
Garth Brooks, Hammer and Nirvana would appear to have little in common, except for the fact that their success coincided with the use of a new computerized system developed by Soundscan, a Westchester company that supplies its findings to Billboard magazine.
"The new chart shows that there are more and different kinds of artists finding and holding an audience than ever before," says Timothy White, editor-in-chief of Billboard.
"The old chart couldn't begin to touch the democracy of this chart."
Soundscan represents a source of hard data in an industry that has demonstrated a preference for hype.
What Soundscan does is eliminate the influence of record store clerks and managers who, under the old system, were simply asked: "What's selling?"
"There's no question," says Mr.
White, "that our old system was subject to manipulation and that people abused it. Store reporters could be bribed with clock radios and all sorts of amenities and favors." (Billboard dropped stores if improprieties were found.)


Making a Difference; Bombardier Snares de Havilland . . .
LAURENT BEAUDOIN, chairman and chief executive of Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, is a former chartered accountant who apparently knows a bargain when he sees one.
He's also a committed federalist, not at all averse to giving French and English Canada bigger commercial stakes in each other to further the cause of national unity.
These two traits were evident last week when Bombardier, which Mr.
Beaudoin has built into a $3 billion-a-year transportation giant over the past decade and a half, acquired the Boeing Company's ailing de Havilland division, Ontario's largest industrial employer.


Craig Sirianni and Dolores Galdi Plan to Marry
Mr. and Mrs.

Mr.
Sirianni, 29, is an operatic tenor.
He graduated from the State University of New York College at Fredonia.


While Bridge Is Fixed, Businesses Waste Away
Arkady Osnis stood in his small shoe-repair shop in Kew Gardens, Queens, and rued the ruinous impact of the big project outside his door.
"Business is 30 to 40 percent lower," he said, fretting about how much longer he could survive.
Across the street on the torn-up block of Lefferts Boulevard, Ruth and Aleta Vahlsing said that plunging patronage had already driven them to shut their gift and candy shop.
The mother and daughter dolefully de-nuded their shelves and packed up picture frames, ceramics and other gift items.


Corrections
A report on the Business Diary page on Jan. 12 about automobile sales in the United States misstated the decline in sales for Mazda Motor of America during 1991.
It was 1.9 percent, not 19 percent.


Take This Job and Love It
With profits declining and competition on the rise, the International Business Machines Corporation wants to make sure all of its employees are pulling their weight.
So the computer giant is making it easier for its people to get fired.
Under one of the most intricately structured appraisal systems in the nation, 10 percent of Big Blue's vaunted work force will get flunking grades in their annual reviews this year, marking for many the first step toward dismissal.
Another 10 percent, deemed by their bosses to be superstars, could earn bonuses of $50,000 or more.
By contrast, Eastman Kodak's Eastman Chemical Company has stopped grading employees.
To eliminate a tier of managers and push responsibility down the line, Eastman recently did away with the top jobs in marketing, production and product development.
Now, decisions in manufacturing, for instance, and solutions to, say, waste treatment problems, are hammered out in monthly meetings by the heads of the company's three major plants.
Because the new team structure makes it difficult to evaluate individual performance, Eastman Chemical is likely to adopt a system of peer review.


The Nation; Where 'Buy American' Is More Than a Slogan
MOTOWN'S emotions have been rubbed raw by disparagements of American cars and the workers who build them.
But the latest crack by a Japanese politician may have pushed Detroit to a new level of irritation.
A Chevrolet dealer invited shoppers to pound a Japanese-made truck with sledgehammers.
Flag-waving members of the United Automobile Workers picketed Toyota dealerships.
The exhortation to "buy American," increasingly chorused around the nation in recent weeks, has always been part of Detroit's credo and is being sounded here more insistently than ever.


Changing Some Habits Can Help Clivias
ALTHOUGH they may be rather dull looking now, clivias are sure to bloom in a few months, if all goes well, and then their owners will be rewarded.
The house plant is one of the finest known, but it demands patience.
Unlike African violets, which bloom almost continuously even in the darker winter months, clivia has one dramatic moment of glory with a magnificent display of amaryllislike clusters of flowers.
The flowers have a bright orange-red hue that is glorious to see, and the best part is that the flowers last two to three weeks or more.


Candidates Playing to Mood of Protectionism
With New Hampshire's economy on the rocks and few points of disagreement on other emotional issues like crime, race and abortion, the Democratic Presidential candidates are vying over who can deliver the harshest words and strongest promises about giving America a leg up in world economic competition.
What the candidates are offering in their commercials and on the stump is more emotion than logic, more oratory than substance.
But they are exploiting the sense that many voters have that Americans are being treated unfairly in international trade, especially by the Japanese.


Echo of Gould: The Treasury Intervenes
The politicians are again trying to fix the nation's economic problems.
And Wall Street is a bit nervous about the prospect.
Last week share prices gyrated and bond prices fell as investor attention began to focus on just what President Bush will propose Tuesday night in his annual State of the Union Address.

Protesters Try to Block Sales of Irradiated Strawberries


Headliners; Deep in the Heart
Dallas took a hard look at itself last week and decided not to change -- at least on the question of allowing homosexuals to join the police department.
It started with a suit by Mica Englund, an avowed lesbian who was denied a job on the Dallas force.
After failing to agree on terms for settling the suit, the Dallas City Council last week held a raucous debate -- almost 300 citizens turned out to speak -- on the banning of homosexuals.
Councilman Chris Luna, who opposed the ban, said Dallas was the only city in Texas whose police applicants were asked about their sexual orientation.
Nor could an Associated Press poll of 11 major cities outside Texas find one there.
But another testifying Texan warned that lifting the ban would invite "the destruction that God visited on Sodom and Gomorrah." After one councilman noted that there was also the matter of a 112-year-old state statute outlawing sex between people of the same gender, a City Council majority voted to keep the ban.


'A Chinese Odyssey'
To the Editor:
Judith Shapiro is wrong to suggest that Anne F. Thurston wrote "A Chinese Odyssey: The Life and Times of a Chinese Dissident" (Jan. 5) to give Ni Yuxian another opportunity to "clear  [ his ]  name" or to make him a hero central to China's democratic movement.
Ms.
Thurston tells the story, good and bad, of one (not
the
) Chinese dissident. Ms. Shapiro's anger is reminiscent of the fury the Chinese Communist Party displayed when the journalist Liu Binyan told a different story about the same man. What is baffling about Ms. Shapiro is that she plays the Chinese game, seeing the world in black and white, accusing those (Ni Yuxian) she does not like of being "thoroughly unpalatable."


THREE MEN ESCAPE BRIDGEPORT JAIL
Three men, including one charged with a murder in the Bronx, escaped from the Bridgeport Correctional Center here Friday night in what was the second escape at the center in 10 weeks.
The escape, which happened between 9 and 11 P.M., occurred without any apparent damage to windows, bars or 12-foot razor wire fences at the medium security jail, according to prison officials.


Basketball Star Shoots at a Record
AT 5 feet 2 inches and about 125 pounds, Darrin Robinson did not look like much of a basketball prospect when he came out for the basketball team at Central High School in Bridgeport during his sophomore year.
"He was very small and scrawny," said Mark Lauretti, who was then the Central coach and is now the Mayor of Shelton.
"But the reason I cut him was because I didn't think he was as good as the other kids. I also didn't think he was physically capable of going against bigger, stronger players.

With a Bit of Blarney, They Made 'Hear My Song'
Adrian Dunbar, the co-writer and star of the new movie "Hear My Song," has this story about being stuck to a pig.
It was in his hometown, Enniskillen, in Northern Ireland, at a time when he was playing bass in a rock band at night and working in an abattoir by day.
"One morning I was pushing these pigs into the freezers, and I actually fell asleep," he says.
"And my cheek stuck to a pig. There was a thermometer in the pig, and in the office, where they were monitoring the temperature, they saw one of them going up. So they sent somebody in who woke me. They actually had to cut a piece of the pig off around my cheek."

Hartford Stage Company's 'Virginia Woolf'
IN case you're wondering whether "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" retains the power to jolt after 30 years, you'll have to wait.
All the Hartford Stage Company production proves is the play's capacity to annoy.
Since Edward Albee's most famous work is so overtaxed by an air of self-importance, it needs to be validated, or camouflaged, by theatrical force.
Concentrating on the specific dynamics between the hapless George and Martha and their helpless guests, Nick and Honey, can heighten combustability.
Forget what it is all supposed to mean.


Turn Deadly Plutonium to the World's Benefit
To the Editor:
What are we to do with the tons of plutonium now in the 40,000 nuclear warheads spread all over the world, with the tons of plutonium in the weapons complexes in a dozen countries, and with the tons of plutonium mixed in irradiated fuel pieces in temporary storage facilities at all of our present reactor sites worldwide?


Rypien, Thanks to Plenty of Time, Is the Redskins' Man of the Hour
Mark Rypien was the picture of composed confidence on Thursday morning as he held court here for wave after of wave of reporters.
Although Rypien is not known for a sparkling personality, the Redskins' quarterback was upbeat, even humorous, as he described how, before Washington's National Conference championship game against Detroit, he went to a hockey game and went onto the ice to shoot some pucks.


Mutual Funds; Closed-End Rebound Abroad
In 1991, the Herzfeld closed-end single-country fund average, which measures changes in share prices of 20 closed-end funds that invest in stocks of specific foreign areas, rose 28 percent.
Prices for closed-end funds, which trade on exchanges like common stock, are set by supply and demand so fund shares can trade at a premium or discount to the value of the securities they own.
Last year's gain was in sharp contrast to a drop of 32 percent in 1990, though still less than the average 41 percent gain for domestic closed-end funds.
The biggest winners were the funds that invest in Latin America.
The top-performing Latin American Investment Fund almost tripled.

Disappearance of Atomic Official Stirs Beijing
The mystery began when Hua Tianqiang, a senior engineer who had access to secrets about China's nuclear program, disappeared while hiking in a sacred mountainous area, a place that has inspired poets and painters for centuries.
Now, after a three-month search that has apparently turned up no trace of Mr.
Hua, there are suspicions that he either died or was smuggled abroad by a foreign intelligence service.


On the Street; For Putting On and Putting Off
There's no sameness of dress for some young people around town.
Their style is more likely to be derived from their music -- rap, country, heavy metal -- than from fashion magazines.
The results are bold and individual and, yes, loud.
Sometimes the clothes are funky (upper left) and sometimes saucy (upper right).
It's all in the combination of the unexpected and the attitude of the wearer.
Trousers might be cut off or cuffed above the ankle.
The distinctive shoes and boots definitely set the generations apart.
And accessories like the scarf that could pass for an airplane propeller have a life of their own.


Streetscapes: 41 Convent Avenue; Pride as a Landmark Criterion?
THE Landmarks Preservation Commission looks for significance in the past -- but should it also consider the present as well?
That question is raised in the continuing case of 41 Convent Avenue, where community groups seek designation for a building that has middling historical interest but that may have great current importance.
A year ago, when the commission calendared 25 properties in upper Manhattan for designation, it thought it was doing the right thing.
After years of indifference, there has been a resurgence of interest in Harlem and other neighborhoods in protecting historic buildings.


A Little Hollywood, a Little Opera
THURSDAY -- A Hollywood costume party at Planet Hollywood on West 57th Street benefited the Parks Council, a civic group that devotes its energies to New York City's parks.
The event drew about 250 guests.
WEDNESDAY -- Mayor David N. Dinkins and his wife, Joyce, celebrated the 100th telecast of "Live! From Lincoln Center" with a reception at Gracie Mansion.
The guest of honor was Luciano Pavarotti, who will appear on the show on PBS on Feb. 24.


New &amp; Noteworthy
FEMALE PERVERSIONS: The Temptations of Emma Bovary, by Louise J. Kaplan. (Anchor/Doubleday, $14.) Men may have cornered the market on fetishism, pedophilia, transvestism, sadism, masochism, voyeurism and exhibitionism, but women, the author argues, have subtle perversions of their own.
Last year our reviewer, Michael Vincent Miller, said this "fascinating and ambitious new study . . . is filled with provocative new ideas cast up like marine life in a surf of enthusiastic speculative energy."
A SCANNER DARKLY, by Philip K. Dick. (Vintage, $10.) In a novel originally published in 1977, a policeman addicted to a powerful narcotic that slowly splits its users' minds in two gradually discovers that the drug dealer he has been chasing all this time is really himself.
In UBIK ($10), a 1969 novel about the horrors of America in 1992, corporate executives hire psychics and plot to blow one another up.


Tanzania Bans Camping In Crater
Tour companies that operate safaris in East Africa have been informed by the Tanzanian Government that it has decided to end tented camping on the floor of the Ngorongoro Crater, where for years tourists have gone to sleep listening to the calls of distant lion and hyena.
No official statement has been issued by the Tanzanians, except that the ban begins March 31, but tour operators say they assume the reason for the decision is to protect the crater's ecology.
Camping on Ngorongoro's circular floor, which is 2,000 feet below the 7,000-foot-high rim, has been a highlight of some safari tours for many years.
The floor covers about 125 square miles, with a lake and forests, and has a resident animal population that includes elephant, wildebeest, monkeys and hippopotamus.
There are lodges and camping sites on the rim, and visitors will continue to go down into the crater on half-day and day game-viewing trips from these.


Forums Are Seen as Way to Defuse Chaotic Nationalism After Communism
It was Jan. 10 in Brussels, the first meeting of a high-level working group bringing together representatives of eight former Soviet republics, Eastern European countries and members of the NATO alliance.
The Russian delegate, Vladimir F. Petrovsky, a veteran Soviet diplomat, greeted the American and Western European delegates as old friends and, in the opinion of one of the Westerners, rather patronizingly welcomed the other members of the former Soviet Union as junior partners in a new strategic dialogue with the West.


Labor Raises Its Voice On L.I. Sound
THE environmentalists inside the Stouffer Westchester Hotel last weekend called their gathering a citizens summit to clean up Long Island Sound.
The construction workers marching outside called it a conference to ban all building projects along the Sound.
Carrying signs like "Labor Votes. Crabs Don't," about 1,500 steamfitters, carpenters, plumbers and electricians demonstrated for two hours in cold winds.
A balloon floating 40 feet overhead capsulized their message: "A Sound Economy Needs Jobs, Not Sewer Bans."


Corruption and Waste Clog Aid Pipeline to Russia
As the United States and other Western nations get ready to send large amounts of aid to the former Soviet Union, people here are struggling to overcome inexperience and disorganization at both ends of the pipeline, as well as a strong temptation to divert scarce food, clothing and medicine to a hungry black market.
Rushing to stitch together some kind of safety net for the needy and to keep up with the foreign response to their country's growing emergency, Russian Government officials have created a Ministry for Social Protection.


Rose Write-In: Thumbs Down
To the Sports Editor:
Dave Anderson promotes the removal of Pete Rose's name from major league baseball's ineligible list ("Write-In for Rose: 3 Years Are Enough," The Times, Jan. 5).
In lobbying for Rose's reinstatement, Anderson is wide of the mark on several grounds.

N.H.L. 3 Goals for LaFontaine Pat LaFontaine scored three goals and the Buffalo Sabres played short-handed for the last four and a half minutes of their 4-3 road victory over over the Montreal Canadiens yesterday.
Jays Wells took a slashing penalty, forcing Buffalo to play the final 4 minutes 39 seconds a man short.
The Sabres won on the road for only the second time in their last nine games while handing the Canadiens, who were missing five regular forwards, their first home loss in nine games. (AP)


Corrections
An essay on Dec. 29 about train travel misidentified the type of accommodations occupied by a family on a journey from California to St.
Louis; it was a bedroom, compartment or drawing room, not a roomette, which has only one berth.
The essay also misstated the train's power and its route; it is diesel-powered and does not leave from San Francisco.
The essay referred incorrectly to a line on which the Olympian Hiawatha train used to run from Chicago to Seattle; it was the Milwaukee Road.
The essay also referred imprecisely to Cannonball conductors; they were former conductors on the Cannonball train, which was discontinued many years ago.


The Trials Never End For One Marathoner
Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., the leading American female marathoner in 1991, will compete in Sunday's Olympic women's marathon trials with several good luck charms, including a peace ring made by her 10-year-old daughter.
"They may weigh me down," said Jones, "but I need all the luck I can get."
In her latest misfortune, Jones, 33 years old, suffered a severe sprain to her left ankle during a training run in the snow on Dec. 20.
She continued to run but the pain worsened, and on Jan. 3 Jones was told by her doctor to cease running.


The Price of Playing Is a Lasting One, but Worth It
To the Sports Editor:
After reading the "Savage Pleasures of Football," by Ira Berkow (The Times, Nov. 26, 1991), and with the sport's ultimate game, the Super Bowl, being played today, I couldn't help but reflect on my own football experiences.
In fact, I think about them every day as I struggle out of bed desperate for the shower to relieve my chronic aches.
I have had three knee operations and a spinal fusion.
My back is now held together by titanium bolts.
I have a pinched nerve in my neck, the bursa sac in my elbow exploded while I was playing, and I broke four fingers.
I'm arthritic, and doctors say I'll need knee-replacement surgery by the time I'm 50.


How Safe Are the Rails? Depends on Who Is Asked
He already reigned as the king of New York jockeys, but when his mount went down in a four-horse tangle at Aqueduct two weeks ago today, Angel Cordero Jr. became even more: the symbol and even the martyr of the explosive issue of safety at the race track.
"We've been taking it on the chin," said Joe King, superintendent of the New York Racing Association and the main keeper of its three tracks, Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga.
"Our interest in safety is being questioned. But we know it's a dangerous profession, and we care about the rider."


GOING BY THE NUMBERS
I disagree with Davis when she says that there's no constituency for research into cancer prevention.
There's a huge constituency -- one that eventually will be joined by one out of every nine American women.
It's made up of the women who have had breast cancer.
Many of them are mothers who desperately hope that their daughters and granddaughters will not have to go through what they did.
This constituency is easy to find.
There are hundreds of grass-roots organizations across the country made up of breast-cancer survivors.
I belong to one in New York called SHARE.

A la Carte: Having Dinner Delivered
TWO new at-home dining companies are serving the East End, meaning that Long Islanders can have a restaurant meal delivered to them whether they live on the Nassau-Queens border, in Montauk or most places in between.
One service, a la Car of Southampton, delivers meals, food baskets and snacks in the Southampton-to-East Hampton area.
The second new company, Dial-a-Dinner of East Hampton, operates from Westhampton to Montauk.


Unblocking Bathtubs and Toilets
CALLING a plumber to clear a clogged toilet or other drain in an emergency can be a nuisance, but most homeowners and apartment dwellers can usually repair such problems themselves.
To clear a blocked toilet, use a flange-type plumber's plunger.
Its cup has a projecting sleeve that fits snugly into the opening at the bottom of the bowl.
Never use chemical cleaners.
They can cause injury if splashed onto the skin.

Wall Street; Hot Times for a Hybrid
Convertible subordinated debentures.
No other phrase seems to capture quite so perfectly the essence of Wall Street jargon.
Indeed, comedians poking fun at the financial world have long known that they could simply pronounce that term, in slowly rounded tones, and rest their case.
Well, it looks as if Wall Street will get the last laugh.
With yields at rock-bottom levels and with stocks soaring into regions that only an astronaut could love, some savvy investors are taking a fresh look at these obscure securities.
The reason lies in the neat parlor trick they perform: in a soaring stock market, they act like a stock, but when stocks slump, they act like a bond.


Ms. Mewshaw To Wed in June
Mr. and Mrs.
John F. Mewshaw of Las Vegas, Nev., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Robyn Frances Mewshaw, to Ben Aaron Indek, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Syria's Game
At a school in Damascus on a rainy day in early December, a well-dressed young woman stepped up to the ballot box to vote on whether Hafez al-Assad, Syria's sole ruler for 21 years, should be given an unprecedented fourth seven-year term as President.
Smiling broadly, she withdrew a safety pin from her purse, pricked the index finger of her right hand and marked the green circle labeled "Yes" on the ballot in her own blood.
Not all Syrians were as enthusiastic.
At the school that day, two hapless voters filled in the black "No" circle instead of the green, the color of Islam.
But members of the President's ruling Baath Party overseeing the balloting quickly detected the mistakes.
Surely, the officials asked the befuddled pair, they had intended to vote for the President?
Yes, indeed, each rapidly agreed.
The ballots were promptly discarded and replaced by Syria's version of politically correct votes.


GOING BY THE NUMBERS
Your account of Davis's professional experience had a unique impact on the very small group of female scientists from earlier generations.
We read familiar words to describe Davis and her work -- "out for publicity," "she's not that reliable," "unoriginal," "wrong." They were such devastating words for us 30 and 40 years ago.
They seem so trite and inconsequential today, now that we know what those words really mean.

A Scarsdale Collector, at Home With About 2,000 Dolls
JOCELYN ADELAAR was given her first doll by a neighbor when she was 5 years old.
It had ringlets and wore a bonnet and dress, but the little girl wanted a boy doll.
So she cut off its hair and named it Billy and has kept it to this day.
Now Mrs.
Adelaar is a mother with two nearly grown children and almost 2,000 dolls.
She says collecting dolls and their accouterments is an obsession that keeps her sane.
She claims she buys what moves her, but other collectors are struck by her sharp eye and uncanny sense of the rare and valuable.


If You Need a Reason, Now's the Time for Meatloaf
RECESSION, nostalgia and winter invariably add up to meatloaf on the menu.
The traditional meatloaf is made with ground beef or a combination of beef, veal and pork.
But today, it might even mean turkey loaf or chicken loaf as the anti-cholesterol squad keeps careful watch over the diet.
Regardless of the basic material, meatloaves are appealing because they are easy to prepare and to eat.
They can be made in advance and reheated or sliced and used in sandwiches.
What is pate but a sophisticated meatloaf?
Like pates, meatloaf mixtures can be wrapped in pastry or used to stuff vegetables.
Meatloaf mixtures can even be formed into small, individual portions.

Your article on Greenwich Village on Jan. 5 highlights public and private schools in the area, but fails to mention the four Catholic schools, with a total enrollment of nearly 1,000 children.


POWER STRUGGLE
Verhovek's fine article on the Quebec power problem doesn't fully portray the New York Power Authority's aggressive efforts to insure a thorough environmental review of the proposed Great Whale project and to reopen our Hydro-Quebec contract to reflect current economic realities.
Largely at my urging, Hydro-Quebec agreed not to begin construction of roads and other ancillary features until the entire project has undergone review -- a major victory for those who feared that such work would make the project itself inevitable.
I have personally advised Hydro-Quebec that we will not buy a single kilowatt of its power unless environmental and native peoples' concerns receive full scrutiny under Canadian procedures.
To facilitate this process, I negotiated an 11-month extension, through next Nov. 30, in the deadline for a decision on the contract.

At Cold War's End, Whither the Missile Monitors?
Inside a small metal building at the Hercules rocket motor factory here, a handful of Russian missile inspectors post a 24-hour vigil listening for the tune of "Moscow Nights" from a small speaker.
That is their signal that the factory gates are opening, possibly for a missile-bearing truck to be inspected under a 1988 treaty between the United States and the former Soviet Union that bans specific rocket motors used on intermediate-range nuclear missiles.


Tea's Free, Music's Hot: Wouldn't Any Fox Trot?
The time, a recent Saturday afternoon; the place, the spacious lobby of the Park Avenue Plaza building, on 52d Street between Madison and Park Avenues.
There are signs that say No Smoking, No Alcoholic Beverages, No Sleeping.
There are no signs, however, to discourage Dancing.
And 150 or so men and women are doing just that, swirling, genteelly stomping, two-stepping and cheek-to-cheeking it on the marble floor.
The Richard Sudhalter Quintet swings into the likes of "Where or When" and "Have You Met Miss Jones?" Open to the public at no charge, the scene is repeated the third Saturday of each month, free tea included.
After all, what's a tea dance without tea?


Helping Hand, Heavy Foot: Both Are the Real China
THERE is a country in East Asia that imprisons and tortures dissidents, that sells missiles and nuclear technology to unstable third-world regimes, that exports prison-made products, that fires on Buddhist monks who demonstrate to demand freedom for Tibet.
There is also a country in East Asia that has revolutionized its economy along market lines, that provides free prenatal checkups for expectant mothers, that is rapidly extending the web of roads and electricity lines to remote villages, that provides wheelchairs and other help to the disabled, that offers Tibetans and other ethnic minorities preferential university admission -- that, in short, is raising standards of living of most inhabitants about as fast as any society in the world.

Jostling To Catch The Wave
PRESIDENT F. W. de Klerk had little new to say when he addressed Parliament last week, but perhaps it didn't much matter.
The place where the pace of change in South African politics is being decided had already shifted from Parliament to the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, a multiracial forum of political parties that was launched on Dec. 20 and 21 to lay groundwork for a new constitution and a post-apartheid South Africa.
In 1990 and 1991, President de Klerk used the opening of South Africa's Parliament as the theater for dramatic initiatives that enhanced the credibility of his promise to end apartheid.
Two years ago he legalized the African National Congress and other banned organizations and promised the imminent release of Nelson Mandela.
A year ago he announced the repeal of the Population Registration Act, which classified all South Africans by race, and the other basic laws mandating racial segregation.

She graduated from Connecticut College, and received a master's degree in education from Manhattanville College.
Her father is the vice chairman of the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau, a national trade association .


Sports of The Times; Coaches Tango Separately Before Their Teams' Super Tangle
YESTERDAY, the last day of news media interviews before the Super Bowl, the players rested, but the coaches were brought into the ring for one more round of sparring before the Titanic Struggle.
It is commonly believed among Football Experts that teams reflect their head coaches.
So an eye was narrowed in the large room in the Park Inn Hotel to seek Insights into which team will win today based on this performance, concluding a long, long week of interviews that have inspired, if not awe, then certainly ennui.


Technology; Bombproofing the Skies
Since a terrorist bomb weighing less than a pound destroyed Pan American flight 103 over Scotland in 1988 and caused 270 deaths, the Federal Aviation Administration and research firms have been trying to figure out how to make planes immune to such explosives.
One answer might be to harden a plane's removable luggage containers so they could absorb a portion of a blast.
"It appears that this offers the near-term solution," said Paul A. Polski, director of the F.A.A.'s Aviation Security Research and Development Service in Atlantic City.


Figure Skating: Art or Sport?
To the Sports Editor:
George Vecsey's article "Skating's Double Standard" (The Times, Jan. 12) highlights the frustration that competitors naturally feel at the preferential scoring accorded established performers at prestigious competitions.
My problems center more on figure skating's double nature: is it art or sport?


New Yorkers, etc.
In certain situations, there are two types of people: those who bow gracefully to the inevitable, with scarcely a second thought, and those who insist on jousting with the inevitable and accept it only grudgingly.
A good many of these situations are related to weekends, a period of time that, ideally, should be devoted to changing pace, to putting projects and business on hold and to relaxing into into a more leisurely and generally less harried frame of mind.
On some weekends, the ideal actually happens.
On others, the ideal is apt to be short-circuited either before the weekend-proper starts or just as it dawns.

CHIEFS OF MOLDOVA AND ROMANIA MEET
President Ion Iliescu of Romania and President Mircea Snegur of Moldova met in this former Soviet republic today to promote closer economic and cultural ties between their countries, but they issued no call for restoring the political unity that existed between the world wars.
Meeting in the Moldavan border town of Ungheni, the two leaders promised to deepen their countries' economic cooperation, proposing a free trade zone between Ungheni and Iasi, the Romanian town just across the Prut River, as part of a broader agreement on cultural integration and economic partnership scheduled for March.


Bettina L. Chow, Model and Designer, Dies at 41
Bettina Louise Chow, an internationally acclaimed model, restaurateur, jewelry designer, sculptor and fashion collector, died on Friday at her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif.

Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said.
She worked with AIDS organizations and talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission.


Mutual Funds; How to Tote Up Your 1991 Results
By now, many investors know that 1991 was a terrific year for mutual funds.
Stock funds rose an average of 30.7 percent while bond funds gained 18.2 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds.
But investors may not know exactly how their own funds did, and if forced to guess, they tend to overestimate.
"Generally, investors guess high and wrong," said John Markese, director of research for the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago.


Helping Rookies Cope With Unseen Pitfalls
When Tommy Hawkins, a strapping 6-foot-5-inch, two-year all-American out of Notre Dame checked into the National Basketball Association in 1959 with his 23-point, 16-rebound-per-game credentials, he thought he had it made.
But what Hawkins came to realize after joining the Minneapolis Lakers was that all he had for sure was a spot on the end of the bench and sobering obscurity.
He had entered the world of a rookie and was enduring one of the more lonely and mentally grinding rites of passage that existed in sports.


Cannot Tell a Lie: Washington's Great
There are reasons why, in some circles, the Washington Redskins are favored to trash the Buffalo Bills by a couple of touchdowns -- or even more -- in Super Bowl XXVI on Sunday evening here at the Metrodome.
After all, this is the National Football League team with the best record (14-2 in the regular season, plus two playoff victories so far).
Only twice this season have the Redskins been held under 20 points; in three games they posted shutouts, and in 11 others they limited teams to 17 or fewer points.

Law on Disabled
To the Editor: Betsy Wade's article "Hotel Chains Move to Meet New Law on Disabled" (Practical Traveler, Dec. 22) was an encouraging report on the hotel industry's response to the Americans With Disabilities Act.
As a representative of Advocates for Better Communication, I was pleased to see that the article did mention accommodations for the hearing-impaired, but feel it is important for the public to know that hotels are required to provide hearing-impairment aids such as visual alerts, flashing lights for emergencies, caption decoders for televisions, hearing-aid compatible and volume-control telephones, and provision for TDD telephones.

The Preservation Movement Is Making Headway
THE little Catskills town of Hurley, N.Y., in Ulster County, has the largest concentration of antique stone houses in the country.
Built between 1684 and the early 1800's, the 25 houses line both sides of Main Street, leading to the town's 19th-century Dutch Reformed Church.
All were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1963 and last September Hurley rewrote its zoning to create a historic district that encompasses all 25 houses, now privately owned and occupied.
Previously, only about half the houses were within a historic district created in 1967.

Lebanon Troops Replace a United Nations Battalion


Wedded to Details


Sudan Is Seen as Safe Base for Mideast Terror Groups
The United States and other Western Governments are becoming increasingly alarmed by evidence that international terrorist organizations that once operated from Lebanon and Libya are now using the Sudan as a safe haven, foreign diplomats here say.
The Western nations also fear that the Islamic military Government formed here after a coup in 1989 is intent on exporting its brand of fundamentalism, threatening secular Governments in Egypt and other countries in the region, the diplomats say.
The Sudan has been forging an increasingly close alliance with the Islamic Government of Iran.


The Sins Of the Children
To the Editor:
I'm not sure what Edward Rothstein means by Nazism, but his meaning certainly does not accord with mine when he associates it with "Tristan and Isolde's" "endlessly enlarging and engulfing, self-generating and self-involving . . . desire"  [ "What Is the Politics of 'Tristan'?" Jan. 12 ] .
Totalitarianism, it seems to me, is the antithesis of anything self-involving.
The unfulfillable love of Tristan and Isolde, which is embodied not only in the libretto but also so spectacularly in every aspect of the score, is an antitotalitarian love in the most profound sense.


Spanish Police
To the Editor: It might interest your readers, particularly in the year of the Columbus Celebration and the Olympic Games in Barcelona to hear of the hazards we encountered on our fall trip to Spain.
We were arrested by the Guardia Civil in our rental car for an alleged violation on the road northwest from Madrid.
In our opinion there was absolutely no violation involved.
My husband passed a slow-moving truck at legal speed on a straight section of dry road on a clear day with plenty of visibility.


Who Needs $9 Million To Fix a School?
The article on the renovation of Hewlett Elementary School  [ "Should District Renovate '29 School?" Dec. 22 ]  cries out for clarification.
Those of us who have come together in opposition to gutting this 60-year-old building do so not because we are oblivious to the repairs that should be made, necessary alterations that would cost a fraction of the proposed $9 million bond issue, but because nowhere in this planned overhaul is there so much as a hint of the real necessity for Hewlett -- relieving its overcrowding.
It is simply too small to accommodate 540 children.


Loft-Living, Southern Style, Catching On
THANKS to an abundance of old warehouses and the arrival of new residents who have experience with loft living, Georgia has become home to a growing number of loft conversions.
"This is sort of a Southern-fried SoHo," said Bruce Gallman, one of the original developers of this city's Castleberry Hill, which has the state's largest concentration of loft apartments.


Life in the Theater (and What a Life)
"Two Shakespearean actors" may be Richard Nelson's love letter to the theatrical profession, but he has written it with a poison pen and sealed it with a Judas kiss.
What starts out apparently as an affectionate celebration of 19th-century troupers ends up, two and a half hours later, as a rather stinging critique of their irresponsibility.
I'm reminded of those ersatz Victorian valentines that look properly warm and sentimental until you open them and get hit with an insult.
Mr.
Nelson's tactics aren't quite so abrupt.
In fact, his episodic play dawdles terribly in the second act before it comes to the point.
But you can't pretend that the playwright's affections are pure.
There's bile in this tribute, which Lincoln Center Theater has lavishly produced at the Cort Theater on Broadway.


Spies &amp; Thrillers
There is a lot of sorting out to do as the reader gets under way in SANDSTORM by Laurence Gough (Viking, $20).
The action shifts from Egypt to Colombia and elsewhere with no perceptible design.
Are we into drugs?
Espionage?
Adventure?
Then things begin to clear up, kind of.
At the end the travels have been well worth it.
Mr.
Gough is a skillful writer with a fine knack for characterization, even if a couple of his figures are somewhat larger than life.
His two black soldiers of fortune who work for the C.I.A. are out of this world.
They are heroic in physique, quick with witty repartee, fearless, lethal, smart as they come.
They should capture the fantasies of any couch potato who dreams of being the ultimate man's man.


Magic's Image: Changing Index
To the Sports Editor:
Harvey Araton in "Advertisers Shying From Magic's Touch" (The Times, Jan. 1) derides some advertisers' reluctance to use Magic Johnson as a spokesman and speaks of this as "shameful" behavior.
Johnson's squeaky clean image is part of what made him a valued advertising spokesman.
Now, as an admitted promiscuous heterosexual who frequently had unprotected intercourse, Johnson's image is tarnished.
The mistakes that he made in his private life have cost him his valued advertising image, his career and probably his life.
Reluctance to use Johnson as a spokesman is a prudent business practice and in no way reflects an unenlightened advertiser.
An advertiser should be able to express sympathy for the infected Johnson, wish him well in his campaign to inform the public about AIDS, and simultaneously deem that his image is no longer effective in promoting the product -- all without being labeled inhumane by Araton.

The Himalayas As a Crossroads Of Vision and Craft
Although the number of noteworthy shows of Western art has been small of late, this is turning into a good season for anyone interested in Asian art -- especially the art of cultures that look to India for inspiration.
The impressive "Wisdom and Compassion" at the I.B.M.
Galleries has come and gone; "The Lotus Transcendant" continues at the Metropolitan Museum; the Asia Society in New York will build a show around one of its South Indian bronzes in the spring.
The most recent arrival is at the Newark Museum and runs through March 1.
Called "Art of the Himalayas," the exhibition is organized by the American Federation of Arts under the direction of Pratapaditya Pal, senior curator of Asian art at the Los Angeles County Museum.
In it are more than 115 paintings, sculptures and ritual artifacts from Nepal and Tibet, all drawn from an American private collection.


7 Nations Say Drag on Growth Is Dissipating
Seeking to raise consumer and business confidence, the finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations said today that the conditions slowing worldwide economic growth were dissipating and that the seven nations would step up their cooperation to stimulate expansion.
After a seven-hour meeting here, the ministers issued a statement saying that economic output should soon increase because inflationary pressures have eased and long-term interest rates have begun to fall.
In an apparent response to American pressure to put more emphasis on growth, the ministers said they were convinced "that the forces that have been inhibiting economic activity in many countries are dissipating and that the conditions for improved global growth exist."


When Form Exceeds Function
David Hockney's Stage designs have a way of sticking in the mind, which is one reason we can speak so casually of the Hockney "Magic Flute" or the Hockney "Rake's Progress." These productions often capture, in some clever, playful way, a sensibility -- the mock-picaresque irony of Stravinsky, the exuberant innocence of parts of Mozart.
So strong are some of the artist's designs, in fact, that they can dominate a work the way a colored light shining on an object can determine how we see it.
The only problem may be uncertainty about what is being attended to: the object or the imposed sensibility of the designer.
This is not Mr.
Hockney's problem alone; designers and directors have been becoming the stars of their own productions for quite some time.
But Mr.
Hockney's new "Turandot," now at the Chicago Lyric Opera, may shed additional light on this issue.


Companies Find Fresh Ways to Donate to the Neediest
Is Troy Kelley the first Neediest Cases Comedian?
The 23-year-old salesman from New Jersey got his break last month by winning the Corporate Comedy Laugh-Off at a Secaucus nightclub that raised $275 for The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
But in a telephone interview he acknowledged that his material, which centers on picking up women in bars, is a little off color to be repeated here.


Art in San Diego
To the Editor: "What's Doing in San Diego" (Jan. 12) omitted an important cultural event of the America's Cup competition.
The San Diego Museum of Art has organized a major exhibition of marine art taken from the collections of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England,the largest maritime museum in the world.
The show, "The Great Age of Sail: Treasures From the National Maritime Museum," marks the first time this collection of 80 paintings and 20 nautical objects has traveled to the United States.
The exhibition will be at our museum, in Balboa Park, from March 7 through Oct. 11.
The exhibition is then expected to travel to the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Va., and the Peabody Museum in Salem, Mass.

Unpredictable Races, Predictable Finishes
Racing started off at a snail's pace today in the first matches of the America's Cup challengers' trials.
But as the wind picked up, so did a series of wind shifts that turned the tables on two of the early leaders.
The result was an unpredictable set of races with predictable finishes.
The two cup boats that have been the pre-regatta favorites -- the Italian yacht Il Moro di Venezia and New Zealand -- proved to be worthy of their reputations.
Il Moro di Venezia defeated Spirit of Australia by 2 minutes 23 seconds.
And New Zealand beat Ville de Paris of France by 56 seconds.


GOING BY THE NUMBERS
I disagree with Davis when she says that there's no constituency for research into cancer prevention.
There's a huge constituency -- one that eventually will be joined by one out of every nine American women.
It's made up of the women who have had breast cancer.
Many of them are mothers who desperately hope that their daughters and granddaughters will not have to go through what they did.
This constituency is easy to find.
There are hundreds of grass-roots organizations across the country made up of breast-cancer survivors.
I belong to one in New York called SHARE.

Kashmir Caravan by Hindus Is Halted
Faced with the threat of violence from militant Kashmiri separatists, Hindu nationalists today called off plans to drive a large motorcade through the Vale of Kashmir to demonstrate the unity of India.
The procession, which began in December from India's southernmost point, was curtailed in an atmosphere of rising tension a day after Kashmiri militants bombed the regional police chief's office in Srinagar, the Kashmiri summer capital, as he discussed security for the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist party that organized the caravan.
Five senior police officials were seriously wounded.


Tanzania Bans Camping In Crater
Tour companies that operate safaris in East Africa have been informed by the Tanzanian Government that it has decided to end tented camping on the floor of the Ngorongoro Crater, where for years tourists have gone to sleep listening to the calls of distant lion and hyena.
No official statement has been issued by the Tanzanians, except that the ban begins March 31, but tour operators say they assume the reason for the decision is to protect the crater's ecology.
Camping on Ngorongoro's circular floor, which is 2,000 feet below the 7,000-foot-high rim, has been a highlight of some safari tours for many years.
The floor covers about 125 square miles, with a lake and forests, and has a resident animal population that includes elephant, wildebeest, monkeys and hippopotamus.
There are lodges and camping sites on the rim, and visitors will continue to go down into the crater on half-day and day game-viewing trips from these.


Negotiators Expect Macy to File for Bankruptcy Protection Soon
Participants in the negotiations to resuscitate R. H. Macy &amp; Company said yesterday that the retailer was almost certain to file for bankruptcy protection soon, possibly as early as Monday.
One of them said Macy had told some important creditors to expect a bankruptcy filing early next week.


As Zaleski Settles In, the Mayoral Profile Changes in Yonkers
TERENCE M. ZALESKI stood in the original mayor's office in City Hall, his words echoing off the unadorned walls of the empty room.
"This was where the Mayor sat decades ago," he said.
"We're restoring it, hopefully permanently."
Mr.
Zaleski, who became the first executive mayor of Yonkers in 50 years by winning a closely contested three-way race last November, pointed out the architectural details of the room and the magnificent view it afforded.
Then he strode briskly into a cluttered adjacent room, where the work of his first month in office was piled high on chairs, desks and even the floor.


Questions Raised on Ability of F.D.A. to Protect Public
Consumer groups and Federal officials are raising disturbing questions about whether the Food and Drug Administration has adequate powers to protect the public from dangerous drugs and devices.
Recent cases involving silicone breast implants, the sleeping pill Halcion and the sedative Versed suggest that the agency and the public are sometimes the last to learn of reports of dangerous side effects.
The Federal agency does no testing of its own, and in making decisions it must rely entirely on the test results submitted by manufacturers.
Officials of the agency and consumer advocates both say that the F.D.A. lacks the subpoena power, which virtually every other Federal agency has, to obtain drug company documents when suspicions are aroused.


A.M.A. Says Johnson Can Play in Olympics
Two days after an Australian doctor said that MAGIC JOHNSON would pose a realistic threat of passing on the virus that causes AIDS if he plays in the Olympics, the American Medical Association issued a statement castigating that view.
"The controversy over Magic Johnson's participation in the Summer Olympic Games is another example of panic and prejudice toward H.I.V.-infected people," said the statement issued by the organization's senior vice president, M. ROY SCHWARTZ.


Camera
When a picture of the new Nikonos RSAF, the first self-contained single-lens reflex underwater camera, flashed on the screen at the news conference announcing it on Jan. 13, the reporters and editors gathered at Nikon House in Rockefeller Center reacted with surprise.
Usually, the press is prone to say, "If you've seen one, you've seen them all." But here was a camera with a difference.
Twenty years in the making, it looked intelligent and ready for serious action.


Miss Brahs Affianced
Mr. and Mrs.
Stuart J. Brahs of Potomac, Md., have announced the engagement of their daughter Victoria Louise Brahs to Simon Herries Monk, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Dennis H. Monk of Ruskington, Lincolnshire, England.
An August wedding is planned.
Miss Brahs, 23 years old, graduated from Boston University and is in a teaching certification program at Bishop Grosseteste College in Lincoln, Lincolnshire.
Mr.
Monk, 24 years old, graduated from Buckinghamshire College and is a sales analyst at G. W. Padley Ltd., a chicken producer in Sleaford, Lincolnshire.


The Executive Life; Those Giving the Word Also Suffer in Layoffs
Don't call them executioners. They feel bad enough already.
Nothing, of course, can match the shock of losing one's job.
The body blow to self-esteem, as well as financial well-being, that comes with being laid off is nearly always traumatic.
But handing out the pink slips can take a toll, too.


Fugard's Treaty for the Warring Sexes
The war between men and women is often interpreted as a struggle for power.
But to the South African playwright Athol Fugard it is more poignantly about the desire of women to be heard and understood by their men, who, he is convinced, often fail them.
In his 1969 play "Boesman and Lena," Mr.
Fugard presents a man and a woman brutalized as much by their inability to communicate as by the tragedy of apartheid.
Mr.
Fugard is directing a revival of the play at the Manhattan Theater Club, with Keith David as Boesman, Lynne Thigpen as Lena and Tsepo Mokone as Outa, an old Xhosa tribesman who comes to their campfire after their shantytown has been bulldozed by white police.
Once the production, now in previews, opens on Wednesday, Mr.
Fugard will return to South Africa to finish a new play.
He says it is about what South Africans are trying to deal with
now,
and it is scheduled to open in June at the Market Theater in Johannesburg with the actor Zakes Mokae, a longtime friend and collaborator.


The Art Behind Nirvana's Ascent to the Top
Millions of Americans must have been surprised when Nirvana appeared on "Saturday Night Live" recently.
The Seattle trio wore all the vestments of the underground music scene, from which they had so quickly risen.
The lead singer Kurt Cobain's ratty jeans and paper-thin T-shirt looked as if they hadn't been washed in weeks, and his hair was dyed a flaming red usually reserved for high-top sneakers or lumberjack coats.
Dave Grohl, the flagellating drummer, was nearly invisible behind tatters of long hair.
Chris Novoselic, the bassist, was bouncing around the stage as if he were about to jump out of his skin.
These grungy punks showed an astounding lack of musicianship.
At the end of their second song they trashed their equipment -- Mr.
Novoselic actually seemed to bean Mr.
Grohl with a drum stand -- and the cameras hastily cut away to a commercial.

THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats; Candidates Court Jackson Supporters


If You're Thinking of a Commercial Spot . . .
The struggle to fill the Super Bowl broadcast on CBS (from pre-game through post-game) with 30-second commercials ended late Friday when General Motors bought the remaining five spots at the price CBS insisted it was holding fast to: reportedly $850,000 per spot.
General Motors bought two 30-second spots and a 90-second spot, which was sold as the equivalent of three.
Dishing Out the Sound
If you look closely at the sidelines during the Super Bowl today, you will see four people carrying small plastic dishes up and down the field and behind the end zones.
No, they're not beaming the game to another planet.


Kuwaitis Urge U.S. to Press Iraq on P.O.W.'s
A delegation of Kuwaiti human-rights advocates spent the last week in Washington urging the United States to step up efforts to win the release of Kuwaitis still held captive in Iraq, and to determine the fate of other missing Kuwaitis.
The group won a promise from Army Secretary Michael Stone to lend forensic specialists from military laboratories to aid in the identification of bodies buried in Kuwait.


Sunday Outing; Roaming the Wilds of Seaford, L.I.
The Tackapausha Museum and Preserve on the South Shore of Long Island serves as an introduction to the ecology and natural history of the Northeast's coastal woodlands.
Most of the Eastern part of the United States was once covered with forests, which in urban areas has been reduced to a few protected areas.
The Tackapausha (pronounced tack-a-PAW-sha) preserve is a narrow strip about a mile and a half long on Seaford Creek, which divides the Towns of Seaford and Massapequa.
It includes 80 acres of wildlife sanctuary traversed by five miles of nature trails.
There is also a small museum, a welcome warming-up pause in cold weather.


Chile's Army Stands Tall, and Casts a Shadow
HE stepped down as leader of Chile nearly two years ago, but Gen.
Augusto Pinochet has hardly faded away.
In allowing Chile to move from a military dictatorship to an elected government, the general was sure to retain for the military, and thus for himself as commander in chief of the army, a good measure of authority.
Every few months, he likes to demonstrate the point.
The most ominous exercise was in December 1990, when General Pinochet, under pressure to resign, flexed his muscle by calling his troops to barracks, in effect putting them on alert.
Then last March, he rejected findings by a blue ribbon commission on human rights abuses during the 17 years of his regime.
He continues to defy any attempts to prosecute military officers.

A September wedding is planned.
Ms.
Smiley, 25 years old, graduated from Syracuse University, as did her fiance.
She is an account executive at Diane Terman Public Relations in New York, of which her mother, Diane Terman Felenstein, is the president.
Ms.
Smiley is also the daughter of Robert M. Smiley of Scarsdale, a principal in Smiley Associates Inc., insurance consultants in New York.

Vision of Rail and Office Complex Moves Nearer to Reality
STANDING at the window of his fifth-floor office in Rutherford, William E. McCann looks out over an expanse of rooftops and meadow grass to a spot nearly four miles away in Secaucus.
There, amid a jumble of railroad tracks and swaying cattails, he imagines a gleaming oasis of glass and steel rising above the marshlands.
In his mind's eye, Mr.
McCann sees five office towers set atop a sprawling train station that would serve nearly 70,000 commuters a day and create thousands of new jobs for New Jersey residents.


Perspectives: The Owners' Outlook; Sounding the Alarm on Mortgage Loans
THE normally ebullient Bernard H. Mendik seems an unlikely messenger for unpleasant news.
"I try to be upbeat," he says.
He usually is.
But as the new chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, Mr.
Mendik deems it a duty to deliver woeful news to Washington.
This is that owners of investment property are being driven into a corner by the unrealistically harsh standards of banks on mortgage refinancing.
He wants a relaxation of rules that he says are obliging banks to judge value on the basis of current rents only, rather than projected rents after building improvements or market gains.

Making a Difference; Plenty of Pain for the Gain
Robert F. Daniell tried to put an upbeat spin on the announcement last week.
The United Technologies Corporation, he said, was embarking on nothing less than a "sea change" that would produce a "leaner, tougher-minded company" capable of enduring the current recession and seizing opportunities as they arise in the future.
Then came the bad news.
United Technologies plans to eliminate almost 14,000 jobs over the next few years, with the heaviest cuts falling on its Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engine subsidiary -- and its home state of Connecticut.
To pay for the cutbacks and for environmental problems, the Hartford-based company took special charges of $1.53 billion, producing a loss of $1.22 billion in the fourth quarter and $1.02 billion for the year.


SUPER BOWL XXVI


Elizabeth Sweet Has Wedding
Elizabeth Adams Sweet, the daughter of Howard C. Sweet Jr. of Charlestown, R.I., and Melinda Sweet Held of New York, was married yesterday in Sharon, Conn., to Timothy Redmond Dowling, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
John Dowling of Ridgewood, N.J.
The Rev.
James Pilon performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at St.

Mrs.
Dowling, 31 years old, graduated from Skidmore College.
Her father practices law in Charlestown.
Her mother is the associate general counsel of Lever Brothers Inc. in New York.


Candidates Playing to Mood of Protectionism
With New Hampshire's economy on the rocks and few points of disagreement on other emotional issues like crime, race and abortion, the Democratic Presidential candidates are vying over who can deliver the harshest words and strongest promises about giving America a leg up in world economic competition.
What the candidates are offering in their commercials and on the stump is more emotion than logic, more oratory than substance.
But they are exploiting the sense that many voters have that Americans are being treated unfairly in international trade, especially by the Japanese.


Ms. Landman to Wed
Robert E. Landman of Glen Rock, N.J., has announced the engagement of his daughter Julie Kay Landman to Devon Engel, the son of Herbert Engel of Westport, Conn., and Lee Reitman of Atlanta.
A July wedding is planned.
Ms.
Landman, 25 years old, is an accountant and a financial management associate at the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation in Washington.
She graduated from Emory University, as did her fiance.
Mr.
Engel, 25, who received a law degree from George Washington University, is an associate at the Washington law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring.

Harry J. Saal of Palo Alto, Calif., have announced August wedding plans for their daughter, Jessica Lynn Saal, and Jonathan Michael Goldman, the son of Susan Williams of Dix Hills, L.I., and Kenneth Goldman of Smithtown, L.I.
Miss Saal, 22 years old, is a senior at Tufts University, from which Mr.
Goldman, 22, graduated.
He is a manager at the International Center Au Bon Pain in Boston.


The High Costs of Xenophobia
Japan-bashing has suddenly become a frenzy, at a terrible toll to America's best interests.
In one short week: A Japanese offer to help Seattle keep major league baseball was doused with cold water by Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent.
Los Angeles County canceled its order for Japanese mass-transit rail cars.
And the town council of Greece, N.Y., voted not to buy a
used
Japanese dirt mover.
Everyone benefits from free and open international commerce.
But while Japan's cars and electronic gear have been a boon to American consumers, its barriers to foreign products and investment are an endless frustration to Americans who want to do business there.


Pavilion Themes at Expo
Entertainment ranging from Spanish dancing and opera to rock groups as well as exhibits about history and technology have been scheduled for Expo '92 in Seville.
Some 55,000 performances at 16 venues will be staged during the international exposition's six-month run on the island of La Cartuja between two branches of the Guadalquivir River.


The Cold War of Cuba and the Miami Exiles Heats Up
THE cold war may be over in Washington and Moscow, but it rages on in Florida and Cuba.
The execution in Havana by firing squad last week of a Miami man recently captured with two other exiles after landing on the Cuban coast in a dinghy quickly produced angry demonstrations in front of the Bay of Pigs Monument here and defiant rhetoric from Fidel Castro and his increasingly beleaguered Communist regime.
On both sides of the Florida Straits, any relaxation of tensions now seems more remote than ever.
In the past, Mr.
Castro might have dealt less harshly with an infiltration episode.
But with the Soviet Union gone, and billions of dollars in subsidies vanishing with it, the Cuban leader is looking unusually vulnerable.
So Eduardo Diaz Betancourt, a 38-year-old mechanic who confessed to joining a shadowy Miami paramilitary group called Commandos L after fleeing Cuba on a boat last April, was deemed to have betrayed "the fruits of the revolution." He was made an example and executed.

CAMPUS LIFE: Rice; Cheating Case Ignites Debate Over Athletics
When 28 Rice University students were found guilty of cheating on a quiz last October, the incident caused widespread debate on the Texas campus about the efficacy of the university's 75-year-old honor code.
The incident was the largest reported case of cheating in Rice history, and it took on extra significance because of subsequent allegations that many of the students were members of the university's athletics program.
Although university officials, citing the privacy of the honor code, have refused to confirm or deny the allegations, students appeared quite willing to accept reports of athletes' involvement, published in the undergraduate newspaper, The Rice Thresher.
This willingness and pursuant criticism of athletes and the athletics program, some say, has served to drive a further wedge between two social groups on this strongly academic campus: the student athletes and the non-athlete students.


At Home Abroad; The Younger Begin

Begin is the son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and he has the same strong nationalist beliefs.
One of "the young princes of the Likud," as they are called, 48 years old, he has been in the Knesset for just three years but has already declared his candidacy for leader of the party when Prime Minister Shamir retires.


Bush Digs In; Abortion Case Adds an Edge To the Election
POLITICIANS are instinctively drawn to compromise, which helps explain their discomfort with the issue of abortion.
Even a master strategist like the late Lee Atwater had a hard time managing the abortion issue, when he tried to recast the Republican Party for the 1990 elections as a "big tent" where both sides could feel at home.
Last week, the Supreme Court might have guaranteed that the issue will be even hotter in 1992.
The court set the stage for an election-year ruling that could further weaken or even overturn Roe v.
Wade, the 1973 case recognizing a constitutional right to abortion.

On Perception and the C.P.A.
To the Editor:
At long last, someone has stood up in defense of the accounting profession ("Let's Have Fair Play for the C.P.A.," Forum, Dec. 29).
Certainly bad apples exist in any profession or occupation and C.P.A.'s are no exception.
But I challenge any other profession or occupation to demonstrate a level of commitment to quality that is equal to that of C.P.A.'s.
Mandatory quality review (essentially, an audit of the auditor) and continuing education are two of the profession's many requirements instituted to insure a high minimum standard of quality.


Andrea Malkin Plans to Wed

An August wedding is planned.
Ms.
Malkin, 23 years old, is the director of career and leadership development at Mount Vernon College in Washington and the project coordinator of the National Women's Student Leadership Project of the National Association for Women in Education.
She graduated cum laude from Brandeis University and has a master's degree in higher-education administration from Boston College.


As Ugly Feelings Grow, It's Hard To Separate Fact and Friction
IN asserting last weekend that America can't compete because its workers are "lazy" and a third of them "cannot even read," a Japanese legislative leader violated Japan's first rule of engagement with the United States: Never criticize America in any harsher terms than America criticizes itself.
In normal times, such indiscretions by Yoshio Sakurauchi, even with their edge of racial superiority, probably would have been written off as the ramblings of an aging and largely powerless legislator.
But given the level of American anger now directed at Japan, these times are hardly ordinary.
Last week a legion of spin-controllers led by Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe raced to assure the American public that the comments by Mr.
Sakurauchi, the speaker of Japan's lower house of Parliament, do not "reflect the way of thinking of the Japanese people in general."


Give the Information to Customers
To the Editor:
"The Bad Boy of Insurance Ratings" (Jan. 5) seems to implicitly accept the idea that a simple letter grade, if "accurate," gives insurance consumers all they need to know about the financial reliability of a company.


10,000 Marchers Protest Manhattan Rally to Ease Cuba Policy
With Cuban flags fluttering above them, a crowd of 10,000 anti-Castro marchers made their way yesterday from Times Square to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to counter a rally by people calling for improved relations between the United States and Cuba.
Chanting "Cuba si, Castro no," marchers from as far away as Miami and Spain carried signs criticizing President Fidel Castro and his supporters.


Amy Press to Wed
Amy Leigh Press and Allen David Friedman, both recent law school graduates of the State University of New York at Buffalo, are to be married in April.
Ms.
Press, 25 years old, as is her fiance, is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Elliott Press of Rochester.
Mr.
Friedman, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Mark H. Friedman of Valley Stream, L.I., is legal counsel at Towers Airport Business Park in Rochester.


Hype Over, CBS Gears Up for Game
The days of watching practices, viewing films and enduring rehearsals are over.
So are the Schwarzkopf-like briefings (complete with extensive play diagramming) to the CBS crew by John Madden to prepare them for what the Bills and the Redskins will do on the Metrodome's artificially painted artificial turf.
Also gone are the dozens of interviews by Madden and play-by-play man Pat Summerall, and pre-game show stars Terry Bradshaw, Greg Gumbel, Lesley Visser and Pat O'Brien.


All About/Dealer Auto Repairs; Turning a Source of Headaches Into a Source of Profits
For most car owners, there are few events that provoke greater anxiety than a trip to the dealer or local garage for service or repairs.
A phone call from the service manager often means news of unforeseen and costly problems.
Because drivers rely so much on their cars, a less-than-perfect repair can be a significant irritation.
Many service visits are less than perfect.
Almost a third of all trips to the dealer for repairs require a repeat visit, according to J. D. Power &amp; Associates, the automotive consulting firm.
And some auto repairs are never done right.
The Better Business Bureau says poor service for cars consistently rates as one of the top five consumer complaints.


Jane Licciardello, Student, to Wed
Dr. and Mrs.
Thomas Licciardello of Trumbull, Conn., have announced the engagement of their daughter Jane Billings Licciardello to James Andrew McIntyre, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Angus P. McIntyre of Huntington, L.I.
A June wedding is planned.
Ms.
Licciardello, 28 years old, graduated from Harvard University, where she is a graduate student in education.
Her father is a cardiologist in Stratford, Conn.


Too Few Wilkins Votes
He has been named to six National Basketball Association All-Star teams and he's currently the league's second-leading scorer, so what does it tell you when forward DOMINIQUE WILKINS of the Atlanta Hawks doesn't even place among the top 10 players in voting for the 1992 East team?
What it tells the Hawks is that something is amiss.
As a result, the team asked for a review of the computer vote count.


Namath Sues Pro Set
It might be considered an honor having your picture on a "Super Bowl Supermen" series of trading cards, but JOE NAMATH has doesn't see it that way.
He filed suit against Pro Set, charging that the Dallas company used his picture in the 160-card set without his permission.
The suit seeks $15 million in damages.
The company said it had been authorized to produce the cards by the National Football League and had assumed the N.F.L. had received the players' permission.
It said it would consult with N.F.L. lawyers before filing a response to the suit. (AP)


Old Movies Add to the Pleasure of the New
A man runs down narrow, shadowy, cobblestone streets, pursued by other men in long overcoats and wide-brimmed hats.
Those streets are all the more sinister for their ornate, looming buildings, which are elegantly filmed in black and white.
Our hero is investigating the mysterious death of a friend and discovers that the dead man left behind some serious political enemies as well as a beautiful lover.
The hero is clearly enamored of this woman, but nothing happens between them.
At the end, one question remains: Why don't they ever notice that tinkling, gypsy-sounding music in the background?
Is this "Kafka," Steven Soderbergh's mordant new film based on the writer's obsession with sinister bureaucracy and personal alienation?
Or is it "The Third Man," Carol Reed's classic 1949 suspense movie, starring Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles?
It is, of course, both.
And just as Huck Finn once said, "You don't know me without you have read a book called 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,' " so Jeremy Irons as Kafka might say, "You don't know me without you have seen a movie called 'The Third Man.' "


Making a Difference; 100 Cents on the Dollar
Last spring, upon learning that he would be in charge of rehabilitating the troubled Executive Life Insurance Company of New York, Kevin E. Foley was immediately apprehensive.
For one thing, the office Mr.
Foley runs, the New York State Insurance Department's Liquidation Bureau, had never attempted to rehabilitate a life company, only property-and-casualty insurers.
Moreover, when compared with other insurers that had failed, Executive Life was huge; its 118,000 customers reside in 23 states.
"We all felt a tremendous sense of responsibility," Mr.
Foley said in a telephone interview.
Last week, however, the 41-year-old Mr.
Foley announced the details of a plan that should pay every one of Executive Life's customers 100 cents on the dollar.
Holders of deferred annuities and life insurance would turn in their policies in exchange for new policies from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.


Judith Parker Weds
Judith Joanne Parker, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Royal Parker of Gahanna, Ohio, was married yesterday to Daniel Karl Zenowich, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

The Rev.
Charles Amstein performed the ceremony at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York.
Mrs.
Zenowich, 37 years old, is a first vice president of finance at Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York.
She graduated from Grove City College.
Mr.
Zenowich, 36, is a freelance journalist and advertising copywriter in New York.
He graduated from Wesleyan University.


Bridge
Any bridge player would gain substantially if it were possible to look through the backs of the cards or read the mind of one of the other players at the table.
Does that happen?
Probably not, although there are times when something close to extrasensory perception seems to occur without any dishonesty.
More than 40 years ago, John Crawford suspected telepathy when playing against twin brothers in England.
His opponents were Robert and James Sharples, one of the best British pairs of the period.
Robert Sharples made a remarkable lead that was highly successful, and Crawford was not pleased, although he later conceded that the lead was entirely logical.

Unblocking Bathtubs and Toilets
CALLING a plumber to clear a clogged toilet or other drain in an emergency can be a nuisance, but most homeowners and apartment dwellers can usually repair such problems themselves.
To clear a blocked toilet, use a flange-type plumber's plunger.
Its cup has a projecting sleeve that fits snugly into the opening at the bottom of the bowl.
Never use chemical cleaners.
They can cause injury if splashed onto the skin.


Of Voodoo And Animal Sacrifice
Re: "Fighting the Stereotypes of Voodoo," New Jersey Q &amp; A (Jan. 12):
It is disturbing to learn that an individual "enthralled" by voodoo animal sacrifice ceremonies is using Drew University as a bully pulpit to promote what is to most a cruel, bloody and barbaric ritual.


Indignant Indians Seeking Changes
When Washington Redskins' fans crowd the Metrodome here on Sunday, many of the most zealous will be wearing war paint or feathers.
Outside the Super Bowl stadium, real Indians, just as zealous but in ordinary dress, will be marching in protest.
What they want is to get the Redskins and every other sports team with an Indian-related name to find some other identity and thus to put an end to stereotypes that have haunted Indians for generations.
It is part of a cultural reawakening sweeping reservations and Indian community centers, a kind of nationalism that has made many Indians less forgiving of the routine use of their names and symbols for things like automobiles and sports teams.

Recognizing Some Of Psychiatry's Errors
Dr.
Marc Waldman, a resident in psychiatric training, claims that psychiatry is as much a science as any medical specialty  [ Jan. 5 ] , but his letter criticizing Grace Ann Inyard's earlier comments  [ Dec. 8 ]  demonstrates that sometimes it is not.
Science demands recognition and correction of past errors.
Ms.
Inyard emphasized how lobotomies, so perceptively described in "Lingering Effects of Lobotomies of 40's and 50's"  [ Nov. 3 ]  were among psychiatry's worst errors.
Dr.
Waldman responded by erroneously equating intent with effect and then denying harmful psychiatric intent, thus ignoring the harm which psychiatrists had in fact inflicted.

The 1992 Campaign: Democrats; Candidates Court Jackson Supporters
Six Democratic Presidential candidates met with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition today, hoping to tap the grass-roots support that fueled Mr.
Jackson's own 1988 bid for the nomination.
But if any hoped to capture the whole rainbow, he was disappointed, as support was fragmented.
All the candidates had a similar message but spent considerable time trying to demonstrate their differences, and that led to some prickly responses.

How the Japanese Learned to Drink Bourbon
To the Editor:
President Bush's recent trip to Japan is symptomatic of what is wrong with our society.
To take 18 overpaid executives from corporations that are losing billions of dollars is ludicrous as well as insensitive.
I would like to put forward the modest suggestion that next time Mr.
Bush take every top executive in the country who speaks Japanese and who can provide research and a business plan showing how his product or service could be successful in Japan.


Changing Some Habits Can Help Clivias
ALTHOUGH they may be rather dull looking now, clivias are sure to bloom in a few months, if all goes well, and then their owners will be rewarded.
The house plant is one of the finest known, but it demands patience.
Unlike African violets, which bloom almost continuously even in the darker winter months, clivia has one dramatic moment of glory with a magnificent display of amaryllislike clusters of flowers.
The flowers have a bright orange-red hue that is glorious to see, and the best part is that the flowers last two to three weeks or more.


For Health: Healthy Competition
Bill Clinton has a five-point plan to reform health care.
Jerry Brown's plan has four, Tom Harkin's eight.
A lot of points but, on inspection, little substance.
For these candidates, health care reform comes out sounding like politics as usual: Promise anything, but hide the costs.
Two other Democratic candidates are not playing it so safe.
Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas have proposed thoughtful, detailed reforms.
Senator Kerrey backs a form of national health insurance under which Government pays the bills and controls costs by setting fees for physicians and hospital reimbursement.


The Price of a Good Night's Sleep
THE night before her mother's 83d birthday, Ilo Grundberg of Hurricane, Utah, shot her mother eight times and then placed a birthday card in her hand.
Claiming that Halcion, the world's most popular sleeping pill, made her do it, the 57-year-old Mrs.
Grundberg not only escaped prosecution but went on to win an out-of-court settlement against Upjohn, the drug's maker.
As is common in such matters, the amount of the settlement was not disclosed and Upjohn denied that Halcion was to blame.
But the company was less successful in suppressing previously undisclosed data about the drug's side effects, which the company was required to turn over to Mrs.
Grundberg's lawyers as part of the discovery process.


FOCUS: Georgia; Loft-Living Southern Style, Catching On
Thanks to an abundance of old warehouses and the arrival of new residents who have experience with loft living, Georgia has become home to a growing number of loft conversions.
"This is sort of a Southern-fried SoHo," said Bruce Gallman, one of the original developers of this city's Castleberry Hill, which has the state's largest concentration of loft apartments.


Review/Opera; Gwyneth Jones as the Met's Turandot
Much maligned for its ostentation, Franco Zeffirelli's five-year-old production of "Turandot" may actually have dressed Puccini's last opera in the clothes that fit it.
This gaudy, gleaming "Turandot" returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday night.
To say that it got what it deserved may be taken as equal parts of malice and good will.
The story of a homicidal ice princess and her suitor from the ranks depicts an ancient China that only a provincial Italian might have dreamed up.
For Puccini, international success that he was, still viewed the world from within the medieval walls and encircling mulberry trees of his native Lucca.
It was the kind of small-town sophistication that at the end of "Manon Lescaut" could establish -- without tedious recourse to a world atlas -- a desert in the midst of Louisiana's swamps.


Bracha Goldsmith to Wed in August

3 Long Shots Finish 1, 2, 3
The three highest-priced horses on the odds board finished first, second and third this afternoon as the 39-1 shot My Luck Runs North won the $91,680 Hutcheson Stakes, the first of Gulfstream Park's three top races for 3-year-olds.
Less than five weeks out of the claiming races, My Luck Runs North, purchased in 1991 for $5,200, took the $55,008 first place purse by three lengths over Sneaky Solicitor, who was a nose in front of a 154-1 shot, Frosted Spy.


MacPhail Isn't Fazed by the Championship Hype
The last time a championship game was played at the Metrodome in Minneapolis, Andy MacPhail was sitting in the stands with a vested interest.
He became especially ecstatic when Dan Gladden stepped on the plate with the only run in the 10-inning Game 7 of the World Series.
MacPhail, general manager of the Minnesota Twins, plans to be at the Metrodome today, but only as a curious observer.

POSTINGS: New York City Growth Symposium; Planning the Use of Land
You won't be able to attend -- it's already playing to a sellout crowd.
But it's worth noting, in part because the issue is so important, and in part because you can catch it on television some weeks hence.
On Thursday, from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., 16 lawyers, city planners, architects and academics, among them such notables as Peter Salins, an urban affairs professor; Michael Kwartler, an architect, and R. Susan Motley, a former City Planning Commission member, will gather at the New York University School of Law to present -- and debate -- papers about land-use plans and rules for New York City.


Knicks Go to Ewing and Bench And Manage to Get the Job Done
Patrick Ewing was his old dominant self, with 35 points and a season-high 21 rebounds.
The Knicks' defense was solid, holding the Warriors 10 points under their league-leading average.
And for a second consecutive game, Anthony Mason was a big contributor off the New York bench.
All of this added up to a 114-109 victory for the Knicks on Friday night over Golden State, the hottest team in the Western Conference.


Business Diary/January 19-24
COMPANIES Prudential Puts a Stop to Laurence Tisch's Miracle on 34th Street


Cuomo's Budget; Plenty of Pain To Go Around
IN proposing his $30 billion budget for the coming fiscal year, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo said last week that he had designed a financial plan with dual purposes: to preserve his vision of an activist and compassionate New York State government and to generate a quick agreement with the Legislature.
Quick budget agreements have been as rare here as balmy Januarys in recent years.
The state has missed its April 1 budget deadline -- the start of the fiscal year -- for seven consecutive years and has set new records for tardiness in each of the last two.
But there may be some reason for hope this year.
Legislators are eager to get out of Albany as early as possible to begin campaigning for re-election.
Neither the Republican-led Senate nor the Democratic-majority Assembly wants to face the voters after another budget delay.
Dangling Carrots
Mr.
Cuomo used his budget proposal to dangle a few carrots before the Senate Republicans, including an offer to produce more than $1.1 billion in savings from the Medicaid and welfare programs, which holds great election-year appeal.


Queens Man Robbed and Killed Aboard Subway
Minutes before he died on Friday night, a Transit Authority bus dispatcher whispered to paramedics, "I gave them the money and they shot me anyway."
The dispatcher, Arthur Young, 40 years old, was shot as he rode to work aboard a subway train bound for Manhattan from Queens.
He became the first homicide victim in the city's subway system this year.

Buying a Home: Who Works for Whom?
WHILE speaking of the rigors of house hunting, a young woman, whose husband was recently transferred from Dallas to the Westchester home office of his company, said:
"The agent who took me around was terrific. She was so helpful in trying to find us what we wanted and what we could afford. I honestly felt she had our best interests at heart."


Gibsonton Journal; Carny Performers Build a Haven by Tampa Bay
"The World's Only Living Half Girl" was working in a circus sideshow with her soon-to-be-husband, an 8-foot-4 1/2-inch giant, when she first came here in 1936.
The moment Jeanie Tomaini set eyes on what was then a small and isolated fishing settlement, she knew that she had found her home.
"When you work seven months a year in front of the public, you need a little rest and quiet," said Mrs.
Tomaini, who was born without legs and toured for many years with her husband, Al, as part of the "World's Fair Freaks" troupe.
"It was peaceful, and there was good fishing here, so one by one, the word of mouth got out and a lot of us drifted down here in winter and built houses."


A Showy Staging of 'Three Sisters'
IT'S easy to be taken in by Emily Mann's tactile and showy staging of Chekhov's "Three Sisters" at the McCarter Theater.
The look of it brings to the senses the "ambrosial air" of which Thoreau wrote.
Behold the startling contrasts between the white expanse of wheat fields in the first scene and the burnt orange sunset blazing through an oval window in the third.
And listen to the lucid translation by Lanford Wilson, commissioned in 1984 by the Hartford Stage Company.
Like the divergent backdrops (by Michael Yeargan) and the subtle shifts in lighting (by Pat Collins), the language crystallizes the coexistence of the humor and the sadness in Chekhov's words.


Housing for 10,000 Is Urged for New York City Homeless
Accusing New York City of failing to address how budget cuts are affecting the growing problem of homelessness, an advocacy group yesterday proposed housing 10,000 homeless people in new or reconstructed buildings over the next two years.
Peter Smith, the head of the nonprofit Partnership for the Homeless, called on the city to immediately begin an "aggressive purchase of single room occupancy units now available at bargain basement prices" and to follow that with the construction of new permanent units.


Much Talk, Little Action; A Plan for Getting the New Countries Through Winter
PARTLY because nobody knows what shape the republics of the former Soviet Union will be in six months or a year from now, it has been hard to decide just how much assistance, and of what sort, the United States and its partners should offer them.
Last week some halting steps were taken in Washington, but they offered only a tantalizing hint of what the future may hold.
At a conference, 47 nations decided to speed up and coordinate emergency aid designed to help the republics through this winter, and they put forward five "action plans" to enlarge the transfer of food and medicine, as well as assistance in providing shelter and in energy and technical matters.
The Bush Administration also announced it would airlift 54 shipments of food and medical supplies beginning Feb. 10 -- including some 16 million packaged meals left over from the Persian Gulf war.


Well-Dressed Animals Keeping Sales High
SALES of clothing for men and women at the tonier stores may have fizzled this last holiday season, but at the K-Marts, Woolworths and Jamesway stores, sales of sporty sweaters and nappy raincoats for four-legged customers did especially well.
"Even when times are bad, people somehow keep buying for their children and their pets," said Robert Kastner, a manufacturer of dog sweaters, dog T-shirts and dog and cat beds.
"People with pets, especially, find it emotionally satisfying to buy them something for the holidays."

Going to School On Delta Queen
A chance to learn about the South from a team of experts during a cruise on the Mississippi aboard the Delta Queen steamboat is being offered by the University of Mississippi.
The school's Center for the Study of Southern Culture has scheduled its second annual Mississippi Voyage between Memphis and New Orleans from April 9 to 17.
On the trip passengers will study the South and discuss its history and nuances with experts in the fields of literature and music.

Sprinkling largess among diverse constituencies at the start of an election year, President Bush wants to repeal the luxury tax on yachts and will propose a substantial increase in the Federal budget for feeding and vaccinating poor children.
Confidential galley proofs of the budget, to be sent to Congress on Wednesday, show that Mr.
Bush will also propose a doubling of Federal spending to control tuberculosis, as well as a public housing initiative to let tenants oust bad managers.


Beauty and the Broadcast
Is it permissible in this era of exquisite sensitivity for a reviewer to mention that the women featured on television magazine programs are good-looking?
Anyone who watched the recent celebration of the 40th anniversary of NBC's "Today" show must have been struck by the contrast between Jane Pauley, Katie Couric and Faith Daniels on one team and Gene Shalit, Joe Garagiola and Willard Scott on the other.
It was the cuties confronting the clowns.
Yes, I have omitted Bryant Gumbel, the program's head man, who is as handsome as they come.
He is the exception in the morning, and he presents a similar problem for a reviewer: if noticing that the women are generally better-looking than the men opens one to charges of sexism, drawing attention to Mr.
Gumbel's looks might be interpreted as racism.
One could be suspected of saying that just as the women owe their jobs at least in part to their shapes and complexions, so the one black morning anchor owes something to features that are pleasing to white folks.


World Markets; A Long Ride on Tokyo's Turmoil
The dismal performance of the Tokyo stock market -- especially while the rest of the world has rallied -- has been a pesky irritant to those money managers who have been positive on Japan.
It has not been fashionable to be, as it is often put in the industry, "constructive" on Japan, but there are those who are.
"I think about it every day," said Richard H. King, the manager of the Counsellors International Equity mutual fund, which is managed by Warburg, Pincus Counsellors Inc. in New York.
"I look every day and wonder if the policy is right. I read conflicting views and wonder if the policy is right."

UConn Marks 100 Years of Women
A CENTURY ago the president of Storrs Agricultural School, Benjamin Koons, felt so strongly about enrolling a student named I. Lee that he skirted the law and kept the admission secret from the school's trustees.
The student's first name was Ida, but state law prohibited women students at the school.
Mr.
Koons did not accept fees from Miss Lee and could not give her academic credit, but she got her education.
Ida Lee Hale's obituary cited her as the first woman enrolled at the school that grew into the University of Connecticut.
Researchers have found five other women who were also enrolled surreptitiously at the school during the 1891-92 academic year.
The law was changed to allow women to enroll in 1892-93, and Ida Lee was officially accepted as a second-year student.

If You're Thinking of Living in: Freehold Borough
A "HOLE in the doughnut" municipality, the historic Borough of Freehold, is surrounded by the township of the same name.
Settled in the late 17th century by Scots, it was a center for Monmouth County as early as 1715, when the first courthouse was built at what is now the intersection of Main and Court Streets.
A stone's throw away, at Court and Monument Streets, is the Monmouth Battle Memorial, a granite obelisk commemorating the Revolutionary War battle fought in June 1788 in neighboring Freehold Township and nearby Manalapan.


The 1992 Campaign; Clinton Deflects Questions on Personal Life
Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas made campaign appearances before Democratic groups in Washington and Boston today and continued to deflect questions about his personal life.
Asked in Washington whether assertions in the tabloid newspaper Star that he had a 12-year romantic affair would hurt his campaign, Mr.
Clinton responded, "No real voters talk about it."


Political Memo; Sharpton Bidding to Draw Votes as Well as News
In the days since the Rev.
Al Sharpton announced that he was going to "throw his hair into the ring" and enter the Democratic primary for the United States Senate, the reaction -- as always seems to be the case with Mr.
Sharpton -- has been divided.
From the camps of the four previously declared candidates -- all longtime Democratic standard-bearers, none of whom is black -- the public response has not risen above the shrug level.
"As a practical matter, we don't see Sharpton's entering the race as making a difference one way or the other," said John E. Burke, the campaign manager for state Attorney General Robert Abrams, in a typical comment.
"He is a person who is adept at attracting publicity to himself and will do everything to do that, but we don't think he will attract that many votes."


Commercial Property: Retail Space; For Retailers, It's Space-Sale Season Hard-Put Landlords
FILA SPORTS, the high-priced Italian sports clothes company, just opened its first New York boutique, at 831 Madison Avenue near 69th Street, in the heart of designer row.
"We've always wanted to be associated with the likes of Ralph Lauren and Armani, but it took until now to find exactly the space we want," said Christine A. Massetani, advertising and promotions director at the company's American headquarters in Brisbane, Calif.


Chess
A compressed schedule that lets layers save on hotel and meal expenses has become an option available recently in some Swiss-system tournaments.
Here is how it went in the Second Annual North American Open at Bally's Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nev.:
The normal schedule, Jan. 3-5, called for six games played at the rate of two a day with the usual time control of 40 moves in two hours.
But players in a hurry could start on Jan. 4 and play their first three games at a time limit of all moves in one hour per player.
They would then play their fourth game of the day at the usual time control.


A Game Plan for Investors
Having trouble figuring out where the stock market is headed?
Relax.
Don't call your broker.
Forget about Alan Greenspan.
Just sit back and enjoy this evening's Super Bowl, and watch the financial future magically unfold.
If the Washington Redskins win, the market is likely to rise.
If the Buffalo Bills win, the market is likely to fall.
That's what the Super Bowl stock market theory says.
And it's usually right.


Making a Difference; Fighting Back at Lotus
John Landry has been running hard since joining the Lotus Development Corporation late last year.
The software company had been going through a tough time.
The introduction of its long-awaited 1-2-3 spreadsheet package for the popular Windows program had met with mixed reviews and disappointing sales.
And some key executives had left, including Frank King, its highly respected technology chief.


'Is This Guy Nuts?'
To the Editor:
Reconciliation and reorienting do no good to those who survive a layoff ("Help for the Post-Layoff 'Survivors,' " Forum, Jan. 5) if management is as fog-bound as it was before the heads began to roll.


The Royal Sculpture of Benin: Beyond African Folk Art
The profound impact African art had on Picasso and other artists at the turn of the century appealed to modern-art collectors 30 years later.
Among the earliest of these buyers was Klaus G. Perls, a Berlin-born art dealer who came to New York in 1935, opened his gallery two years later and then began acquiring African art because, he said, "I liked to see it with the works of the Picasso generation of artists."
By the mid-1950's, Mr.
Perls and his wife, Amelia, had narrowed their search to metal, wood and ivory objects produced from the 16th to the 19th centuries in the kingdom of Benin, now Southern Nigeria.
Until last winter, these courtly works, depicting medieval-looking warriors, kings, Portuguese merchants, leopards and crocodiles, crowded a room above the Perls Gallery, which is in the couple's Madison Avenue town house.
They were then donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art where they went on view this month in an exhibition, "Royal Art of Benin From the Perls Collection: Treasures From an African Kingdom," remaining through Sept. 13.


Changing Some Habits Can Help Clivias
ALTHOUGH they may be rather dull looking now, clivias are sure to bloom in a few months, if all goes well, and then their owners will be rewarded.
The house plant is one of the finest known, but it demands patience.
Unlike African violets, which bloom almost continuously even in the darker winter months, clivia has one dramatic moment of glory with a magnificent display of amaryllislike clusters of flowers.
The flowers have a bright orange-red hue that is glorious to see, and the best part is that the flowers last two to three weeks or more.


With Tyson's Arrival, A Day of Departures
It looks like a driver's license number: 49G049109CF116245.
But in actuality it is the official designation of what, with very little hyperbole, a local television news anchor described Friday night as "one of the most anticipated rape trials ever."
It is the case of the State of Indiana versus Michael G. Tyson, the former heavyweight champion.

Sports of The Times; Super Bowl's Northern Exposure
BEFORE I tell you who is going to win the Super Bowl today, let me first tell you who came out a winner this last week:
Any northern city not named Detroit with a domed stadium has a very good chance of playing host to a Super Bowl of its very own somewhere around the turn of the century.

Of Mud and Deals and Warmth and Wet
THERE are driving schools, and then there are driving schools.
I've been to a lot of them.
There was racing school in Canada.
Ice school in Steamboat Springs, Colo.
BMW's advanced driving school at Lime Rock, Conn.
And that truly wonderful school, taught by Sandy Stevens up in Vermont, the one that shows state cops how to pursue high-speed miscreants.
But now there is a new possibility for those of us who think that being behind the wheel means more than just getting to work.


Sports of The Times; When Mantle Had to Battle for a Raise
WHILE the nation's economy dwindles, baseball's economy still soars upward.
For hitting 18 homers, driving in 66 runs and batting .259 for the Chicago White Sox last season, Dan Pasqua, once a Yankee outfielder, recently signed a three-year, $6 million contract.
And in the first season of his three-year, $6 million contract, Franklin Stubbs of the Milwaukee Brewers batted .213, hit 11 homers and drove in 38 runs.


Producers As Drama Coaches
To the Editor:
A footnote to Walter Goodman's essay "For $64,000: Who Lost in the Big Fix?"  [ Jan. 5 ]  about the "American Experience" documentary on the quiz-show scandals of the 1950's.
As a junior representative of the sponsors on a number of quiz shows (i.e., an ad agency employee), I was pretty close to what was going on, although not a participant.


This Week: Mail
Many nurseries are now selling quality native seeds and plants, so choose the ones most suitable for your region.
Some accept mail orders; some do not.
Many design gardens in addition to offering valuable advice to do-it-yourselfers.

Ball Is Bouncing Funny as Ex-Soviets Make Effort to Regroup
The Commonwealth of Independent States soccer team that represented the former Soviet Union in a ballyhooed exhibition match tonight at Joe Robbie Stadium against the United States national team is a product of the commonwealth's first attempt at capitalism.
According to Aleksandr Tukmanov, head of the commonwealth's delegation here, some 30 of the former Soviet team's top players have been sold to top professional teams and, he said, about 100 others are playing abroad.

How the Japanese Learned to Drink Bourbon; Corporate Complacency
To the Editor:
The outcome of the recent United States trade mission to Japan and the forceful statements of the American auto industry executives who participated recalls my experiences in the early 1960's at Forbes Inc.


Mount Vernon Law Should Be Changed
As a tax-paying homeowner in the city of Mount Vernon, I go along with the city officials quoted in your article of Jan. 5, "Mount Vernon Challenges Definition of a Family," when they express their eagerness to protect their cities against increased density and other housing evils.
However, as a member of the board of directors of Genesis Housing Corporation, the not-for-profit organization that was denied a building permit for a two-family shared-dwelling unit for seniors, I disagree strongly with their method of attaining their stated goals.
A little history is in order.


Think White (Mostly) for Lying in Sun
If you are one of the lucky few heading for a holiday in a warm corner of the world, you're probably thinking about what to pack.
It's really quite simple.
Unless you're planning to hit the charity ball circuit in some place like Palm Beach, Fla., you're not likely to need anything really dressy.
Besides, the place to go this year is South Miami Beach, which is more funky than fancy.
Anyway, you go to a resort to relax, right? So the watchword is "casual."


The Evolution of Billy Graham
To the Editor:
As a student of American religious history, I found Tom Wicker's review of "A Prophet With Honor" (Dec. 22), William Martin's biography of the Rev.
Billy Graham, altogether unfair.
Mr.
Wicker rehearses Billy Graham's oft-cited sins -- his courting of the powerful, his support of the Vietnam War, his ambivalence toward the civil rights movement, his indifference to the intellectual problems of faith -- and justly faults the evangelist's shortcomings and Mr.
Martin's occasional failure to be more critical of his subject.
But Mr.
Wicker fails to see Mr.
Graham in anything but crudely polemical terms.

Re: "Center Helps Those for Whom Sleep Is an Enemy" (Dec. 29), about sleep disorders and Newark Beth Israel Hospital's Sleep Disorders Center:
Many Americans are unaware of the prevalence and seriousness of sleep disorders, and many are not even aware that they might have a disorder like sleep apnea.


Longevity Thanks to Skiing and Oatmeal
LIKE sentries, skis flanked the doorway in the small foyer of the Great Neck apartment.
Next to the umbrella stand stood his and hers, waxed shiny and ready to go.
Another skiing season awaits Dr.
A.
J.
Snow and his wife, Aida.
They will soon pack their car and be on their way to Canada.
She will drive.
He doesn't anymore.
At 98 years of age, Dr.
Snow has given up some activities.
Skiing is not one of them.


CONNECTICUT GUIDE
HUNGARIAN ENSEMBLE
The Philharmonia Hungarica conducted by Sir Yehudi Menuhin will make a swing through the state this week, performing in New Haven, New London and Storrs.


POSTINGS: Gramercy Park; A Hybrid
The goal was to restore the town house at 145 East 19th Street near Gramercy Park to its authentic appearance.
The question was, which one?
Was it to be Greek Revival, the style in which the house was built in 1843?
Or vaguely Mediterranean, as it was remodeled in 1911 as part of a group of houses known as the "Block Beautiful"?


Corrections
An article last Sunday about the difficulty of obtaining convictions under obscenity laws rendered the name of the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union incorrectly.
He is Norman Siegel.


World Markets; A Long Ride on Tokyo's Turmoil
The dismal performance of the Tokyo stock market -- especially while the rest of the world has rallied -- has been a pesky irritant to those money managers who have been positive on Japan.
It has not been fashionable to be, as it is often put in the industry, "constructive" on Japan, but there are those who are.
"I think about it every day," said Richard H. King, the manager of the Counsellors International Equity mutual fund, which is managed by Warburg, Pincus Counsellors Inc. in New York.
"I look every day and wonder if the policy is right. I read conflicting views and wonder if the policy is right."


Albelin Knows the Value of Numbers
Tommy Albelin's arithmetic has made him accept his situation with the Devils.
The Swedish defenseman looks around the team's dressing room and counts six solid defensemen before he counts himself.
The 27-year-old Albelin, in his fourth season with the Devils, is the seventh defenseman on a team that may very well have the best first six defensemen in the National Hockey League.


Planes and Trains
To the Editor:
As the president of the Air Transport Association, I would like to respond to your review of "Supertrains: Solutions to America's Transportation Gridlock." It failed to mention that the author, Joseph Vranich, is a consultant to the High Speed Rail Association.
That's an important omission, because the review strongly implies that Mr.
Vranich is on to an exciting new idea.
What he's on to is something he has a vested interest in seeing succeed, and which most people believe will succeed only with government subsidy.
That's what bothers the airlines about this growing bandwagon touting high-speed rail.
Its advocates want the use of public money to build these expensive new systems -- so they can compete with unsubsidized airlines.
High-speed rail, while potentially attractive, should pay its own way.
It should rise on its own merits.
If the concept makes sense economically, the private sector will build it.

From the Archives of Gordon Parks: Artifice and Reality
THE photographers Irving Penn and Richard Avedon became famous for their shots of fashion and high society before turning their attention to real life.
But for Gordon Parks, artifice and reality have been intertwining themes from the beginning.
While making his first money as a photographer of fashionable women, in the Chicago of the late 1930's, Mr.
Parks was also at work on a project of his own -- life in the Chicago slums.
It was this project, in fact, that got him his first big break -- a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship and the chance to work for the Farm Security Administration under Roy Stryker.


If You Need a Reason, Now's the Time for Meatloaf
RECESSION, nostalgia and winter invariably add up to meatloaf on the menu.
The traditional meatloaf is made with ground beef or a combination of beef, veal and pork.
But today, it might even mean turkey loaf or chicken loaf as the anti-cholesterol squad keeps careful watch over the diet.
Regardless of the basic material, meatloaves are appealing because they are easy to prepare and to eat.
They can be made in advance and reheated or sliced and used in sandwiches.
What is pate but a sophisticated meatloaf?
Like pates, meatloaf mixtures can be wrapped in pastry or used to stuff vegetables.
Meatloaf mixtures can even be formed into small, individual portions.


Discovery Museum Offers Works by a Storyteller With a Brush
AS far as popularity goes, there is no art like folk art.
A genre that contributed to Modernism and was at the same time legitimized by it, folk art now seems to be the embodiment of political correctness.
But as evidenced by the paintings of Malcah Zeldis, at the Discovery Museum in Bridgeport, the mode can still provide pleasure.
Ms.
Zeldis explains that Malcah is Hebrew for queen, and that she substituted it for her given name, Mildred, when she was a teen-ager living on a kibbutz.
She was born, however, in New York City and raised in Detroit, where her father, a Sunday painter, saw to it that she visited the Detroit Institute of Arts.


When an Emergency Arises, Nets Just Call for a Red Alert
To the outside world, they are known as the scrubs, or more politely as the bench or reserves.
For games they dress in the same uniforms as the Nets' starters: Sam Bowie, the center, the forwards Derrick Coleman and Chris Morris, and guards Mookie Blaylock and Drazen Petrovic.


Fear of a New Terrorist Haven
The United States and other Western governments are worried by evidence that international terrorist organizations that once operated from Lebanon and Libya are now using the Sudan as a safe haven.

Aquino Endorses Ex-Army Chief in Vote
President Corazon C. Aquino announced today that she was endorsing the former Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, a leader of the 1986 uprising that brought Mrs.
Aquino to power, as her choice to succeed her in Philippine elections in May.
The endorsement by Mrs.
Aquino, who is not running for re-election, widened a split among her supporters and appears to increase the chances that the presidential election could be won by a close associate of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos -- perhaps even his widow, Imelda, who declared her candidacy this month.


POSTINGS: N.Y.U. Purchase; Refashioning
The Fairchild building at 7 East 12th Street in Manhattan, once home to such fashion publications as W, Women's Wear Daily and M. Inc., has been sold to New York University, which intends to use it for administrative offices.
The university paid $5.8 million to Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., for the 12-story building and began moving people in this month.
John O'Connor, an N.Y.U. spokesman, said the purchase will help provide additional space for student and faculty activities in other buildings on the university's Greenwich Village campus.
"It is really in the neighborhood because our campus extends from Washington Square to residence halls in Union Square," Mr.
O'Connor said.


VOLVO MERGER SET IN $6 BILLION DEAL
In what would be one of the biggest mergers in Europe, A.B.
Volvo, the Swedish car and truck giant, and Procordia A.B., a Swedish food and drug company, announced today that their boards had agreed to combine the companies through a $6.6 billion deal.
The agreement calls for Volvo shareholders to receive Procordia shares and would create a company that would be called Volvo and would have 105,000 employees and revenues of about $20 billion.
The deal comes at a time when the European car, food and drug industries are consolidating -- a development driven by trends in Europe as well economic forces throughout the world.


Get Ready for a Less-Than-Super Morning After
LIKE spectral blimps, three big heads haunt the Super Bowl.
When the game is over, we will have Iron Mike, the Owner from Hell and Tark the Shark back in our faces.
Mike Tyson's trial begins tomorrow in Indianapolis and the basic beef -- did the 25-year-old former heavyweight champion rape an 18-year-old woman who was a beauty-pageant contestant -- may get lost in the sauce.
Commentators are already loading the plate with discussions about the difficulty of communication between men and women, the entitlement of Powerboys to grab and squeeze, and the danger of greedy girls who kiss and sue.


Naomi Mezey, Student, to Wed
Naomi Jewel Mezey, a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, and Matthew Eric Paul, a graduate student at the University of Virginia, are engaged to be married.
Ms.
Mezey, 26 years old, graduated from Wesleyan University and was until recently a legislative aide to Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California.
She is studying for a master's degree in American studies and plans to enter the Yale University Law School next fall.
She is the daughter of Olivia Simpson Ellis and Robert Mezey, both of Claremont, Calif.
Her father is a poet and an English professor at Pomona College.
Her mother is a learning specialist at Oakmont Elementary School in Claremont.


Manhattan Transplant Makes the Grade
GATHERING, a Chinese restaurant in Wantagh, is a Manhattan transplant.
The original was an inexpensive island in a high-priced sea of restaurants in the Lincoln Center area.
When its rent went through the roof about a year ago, Gathering gathered its gear and headed east.
It has duplicated its big-city sophistication in a strip stopping center on Wantagh Avenue.
Outside, Gathering is emblazoned in red on an impressive awning.
Within, it is track lighting, spare gray walls, brass railings, deep-red ceiling and arresting graphics and posters by the Japanese artist Kozo.


Robin Wolaner Has a Wedding
Robin Peggy Wolaner, the founder and president of Parenting magazine, and Steven Jonathon Castleman, head of the environmental protection unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's office, were married last evening.
Rabbi Jerry Winston officiated at the Flood Mansion in San Francisco.
Ms.
Wolaner, 37 years old, graduated from Cornell University and is a vice president of Time Publishing Ventures Inc., a division of Time Warner in New York.
She is a daughter of Harriet Wolaner of Lenox, Mass., and Boynton Beach, Fla., and the late David H. Wolaner.
Her mother is a retired first-grade teacher at Lakeside Elementary School in Merrick, L.I.
Ms.
Wolaner's previous marriage ended in divorce.


A New Curator Confronts The Legacy of a Legend
Peter Galassi is learning what it's like to follow a legend.
Named director of the Museum of Modern Art's department of photography in October, the 40-year-old Mr.
Galassi has the unenviable task of following the renowned John Szarkowski in a post that has traditionally exerted great influence within the narrow bounds of fine-art photography.
At present, though, Mr.
Galassi is concentrating on getting things in the photography department back to normal.
Mr.
Szarkowski's retirement, and the long process of naming his successor, had put business on hold for the better part of two years.
Mr.
Galassi is now moving quickly to put his own stamp on the museum's photography program and is planning his first show as director.


The American Dream: Back at the Bunkers'
"All in the Family," which ran from 1971 to 1979, is back in reruns Saturday nights at 10:30 on CBS.
In his book "Honey, I'm Home! Sitcoms: Selling the American Dream," to be published next month by Grove Press, Gerard Jones offers this analysis of the appeal of the Norman Lear series:
After a few years "All in the Family" fell prey to its own sentimentality and repetition.
But in its moment of gutsy, self-contradictory glory, it changed American mass culture.
It was the first postcorporate sitcom.
It dared state that the culture of assimilation and consensus wasn't working, that communication -- that most sacred process in the creation of the postwar, postideological commercial utopia -- did not dissolve our differences.
In the Bunker household, communication didn't create Pat Weaver's "cybernetic civilization." It just created a lot of yelling.


Carol Harding To Wed in Fall
Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas J. Harding Jr. of Airmont, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter Carol Ann Harding to Thomas E. Martin, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Matthew T. Martin of Edison, N.J.
An October wedding is planned.
Miss Harding, 28 years old, graduated from Purdue University and is a coordinator in the actuarial department of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New York.
Her father retired as an engineering manager for A.T.&amp;T. in Basking Ridge, N.J.
Her mother, Dorothy Harding, retired as a nurse at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y.


All About/Dealer Auto Repairs; Turning a Source of Headaches Into a Source of Profits
For most car owners, there are few events that provoke greater anxiety than a trip to the dealer or local garage for service or repairs.
A phone call from the service manager often means news of unforeseen and costly problems.
Because drivers rely so much on their cars, a less-than-perfect repair can be a significant irritation.
Many service visits are less than perfect.
Almost a third of all trips to the dealer for repairs require a repeat visit, according to J. D. Power &amp; Associates, the automotive consulting firm.
And some auto repairs are never done right.
The Better Business Bureau says poor service for cars consistently rates as one of the top five consumer complaints.


Walker Is Now Cheaper
His price seems to have gone down a bit since 1989 when HERSCHEL WALKER was traded to the Minnesota Vikings for five players and seven draft picks.
Now the 29-year-old running back is the subject of new trade talks, with the Atlanta Falcons, but the Vikings aren't asking for a whole team.


Japanese Urge Early Booking
Drop-in visitors seeking accommodations through Japan's Welcome Inn Reservation Center offices in Tokyo and Kyoto have sometimes been turned away, says an official of the Japan National Tourist Organization.
Americans planning to stay in the accommodations listed by the center -- set up last spring to provide rooms at no more than $62 a night -- are advised to reserve at least two weeks in advance by mail or fax.
The Tourist Organization says that planning ahead gives travelers a better than 90 percent chance of securing a room through the center, established to serve foreign tourists looking for inexpensive accommodations.
Those in Tokyo and Kyoto are often booked solid.
About 270 accommodations in various cities belong to the center.
They range from Japanese-style inns (ryokan), family-run bed and breakfasts (minshuku) and government-sponsored lodges (kokumin shukusha) to Western-style pensions.
A free directory of Welcome Inns and reservation request form are available from the Japan National Tourist Organization, 630 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2101, New York, N.Y. 10111; (212) 757-5640.


ABOUT NEW JERSEY
WHEN the wrecking ball slammed into the big brick buildings at the river's edge in Hoboken a few years ago, one man stood watching from behind the tall iron gate the German steamship lines had built.
Occasionally, moved by some new angle or suddenly revealed interior space, he snapped a photograph, all the while chewing a worn-down pipe.
His name is Donald Barrett.
He was a longshoreman.
He worked Hoboken for 15 good years until that one black Monday in 1970 when he walked up to River Street and found the gate to the pier padlocked, the shipping company gone without warning.
He recrossed River Street to the Seven Seas, one of a dozen shot-and-beer joints, and toasted destiny.


Robyn Arnberg To Wed in June
Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Arnberg of Dix Hills, L.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter Robyn Beth Arnberg to Richard Lawrence Cotler, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Leslie B. Cotler of New York.
A June wedding is planned.
Miss Arnberg, 24 years old, graduated from the University of Maryland, as did her fiance.
She is a candidate for a master's degree in nutrition at New York University.
Her father is the president of the Hirsch International Corporation, a textile equipment distributor in Hauppauge, L.I.
Her mother, Lynda Arnberg, is the president of Timely Travel Inc., a Hauppage travel agency.


In Options Trading, Volatility Is a Virtue
Richard Witten, who is in charge of foreign exchange sales at Goldman Sachs, is sitting at the computer terminal in his office.
He taps some keys and the screen blossoms with a colored display that reveals the details of a "plain vanilla" option -- in this instance an option to buy American dollars with Canadian dollars next June.
Because Mr.
Witten, or a customer, needs to know more, the computer displays the welter of currency options arcania: the strike price, the premium, the delta and the volatility.


Headliners; Bowing Out
When J. Carter Brown became director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1969, he presided over a small collection of Old Masters that some 1.3 million visitors a year came to see.
Last week, Mr.
Brown announced that by the end of the year he will retire from the gallery, which has grown under his reign into a wide-ranging institution known for its imposing East Wing, designed by I. M. Pei, and its blockbuster exhibitions, like the recent "Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration," which help draw between 5 and 7 million visitors a year.
"I've spent over half my life at the National Gallery," said Mr.
Brown, who came to the museum in 1961 as assistant director.
"I only started thinking about retirement a month ago." Mr.
Brown, who is 57 years old, said he intended to become more involved in Brown University, which his family has long supported.
"I have had no full-time employment offers or plans," he said.
"I already have too many irons in the fire and the minutes are scarce."


Notes With Pleasure
The Lost Connection
The novelist and critic John Berger argues that zoos are an especially poignant reminder of a now-vanished intimacy between humans and animals.
This is from "About Looking" (Vintage International, paper).


Judith Victor, Actress, to Wed
Mr. and Mrs.
Donald Victor of Great Neck, L.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Judith Robin Victor, to Kenneth Raymond Brown, the son of Miriam Sents of Palmyra, Pa., and the grandson of Catherine Livering and the late Raymond Livering of Annville, Pa.
An April wedding is planned.

Her father is a retired lawyer and the acting Village Justice of Russell Gardens, L.I.
Mr.
Brown, a chef, is the president of the Upscale Pedestrian, a catering concern in Los Angeles.


Miss O'Connor Has Wedding
Jeanne O'Connor, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
William J. O'Connor of Southampton, L.I., was married yesterday to Don Grolnick, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Lester Grolnick of Huntington, L.I.
Judge Judith S. Kaye of the New York State Court of Appeals officiated at the Westbury Hotel in New York.
The bride, who is 35 years old and is keeping her name, graduated from Brown University.

Style Makers; Chet Goldstein, T-Shirt Entrepreneur
Laid up for several weeks last spring with a broken ankle, Chet Goldstein spent his time dreaming up new directions for his five-year-old T-shirt company, Campus Collections, in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
He wanted designs with a twist, like the playful mascots on some of his college T-shirts.
And so he came up with an idea to turn the work of Southern folk artists into wearable art.


Correction
A review of "Come From Away" by David Macfarlane on Jan. 12 on the "In Short" page misstated the year and the source for the reward of $:10 given to John Cabot for discovering what later became Newfoundland.
It was 1497, and the donor was the King of England, Henry VII.


For Killy and Old Friend, the Dream Comes True
When the two old friends first joined forces more than a decade ago to try to bring the Winter Olympics to their native Savoy, the fact that one of them was Jean-Claude Killy at least insured they would be noticed, even if they seemed to be dreaming of the impossible.
Now, less than two weeks before the opening of the 1992 Winter Games here, Killy, the 48-year-old former skiing champion, who was a triple gold medalist at the 1968 Olympics, is still drawing the greater share of public attention.
But to those in the know, his partner, Michel Barnier, has played no less a role in organizing the spectacular.

Slumping Redmen Let Another 'Get Away'
With four starters returning from a team that lost to eventual-champion Duke last season in the Midwest Regional final of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, this was supposed to be a banner year for St.
John's.
Numerous preseason polls that had the Redmen ranked among the top-10 teams in the country, a panel of coaches picked St.
John's to finish first in the Big East Conference, and many among the Redmen faithful boasted about a possible trip to the Final Four.


Q and A
Eligibility for Housing Question: My sister and I have applied for an apartment in the Penn South co-op in Manhattan.
Our first choice was for a two-bedroom apartment.
But we were told that we would have a better chance if we accepted a one-bedroom apartment and switched to a two-bedroom apartment once we had moved in.


Tech Notes; Robots to Handle the Random
For robots to operate effectively, they need predictability; the pieces to be moved or welded by the robot must be positioned consistently.
Therefore, picking up parts piled randomly inside a bin has long posed a challenge for robot makers.
But Perceptron of Farmington Hills, Mich., has developed a three-dimensional camera system that combines radar and laser technology to make such complex tasks possible.


The Graduate, Circa 1992
To the Editor:
I'd be curious to know how many liberal arts graduates holding only a B.A. in history, English or philosophy Joseph Pichler, president and chief executive of the Kroger Company, has hired recently. ("A Believer in Liberal Arts Tackles Worker Education," Making a Difference, Jan. 12.)


Travel Expenses of Tenant Group Are Scrutinized
The New York City Housing Authority's Tenants Advisory Council was established to create a stronger voice for tenants and to bring democracy to public housing.
But with more money than it knew what to do with, no clear mission and little oversight, the council became a private reservoir for its members, who spent tens of thousands of dollars on travel, meals, hotels and flowers, according to documents and interviews with housing officials and others.


Scott Bush, an M.B.A. Candidate, To Wed Miss Whitaker, Consultant
Mr. and Mrs.
Albert H. Whitaker of Claremont, Calif., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Lindsay Whitaker, to William Prescott Bush, the son of William H. T. and Patricia Bush of St.
Louis.
A July wedding is planned.
Miss Whitaker, 28 years old, graduated from the University of Southern California.
She is a consultant for Ameritech International Corporation, a telecommunications company in Chicago.
Her father is a vice president and the manager of engineering and technology at Martech International Inc., an engineering and construction management firm in Covina, Calif.


'A Chinese Odyssey'
To the Editor:
If Judith Shapiro gets the impression that Ni Yuxian is "a thoroughly unpalatable character -- abrasive, unfaithful, opportunistic and arrogant, a man who even as a dissident disappoints us," she is not too far off the mark.
In the eyes of most Chinese intellectuals in America, Mr.
Ni is but a self-promoting, opportunistic individual who became someone only because Liu Binyan made him a hero in his essay "A Second Kind of Loyalty."


Changing Some Habits Can Help Clivias
ALTHOUGH they may be rather dull looking now, clivias are sure to bloom in a few months, if all goes well, and then their owners will be rewarded.
The house plant is one of the finest known, but it demands patience.
Unlike African violets, which bloom almost continuously even in the darker winter months, clivia has one dramatic moment of glory with a magnificent display of amaryllislike clusters of flowers.
The flowers have a bright orange-red hue that is glorious to see, and the best part is that the flowers last two to three weeks or more.


Year Later, Hellfighters Feel Forgotten
Like many other Harlem Hellfighters, Sgt.
Joe Bradford has found that, one year later, his service in the Persian Gulf war with the famous New York Army National Guard unit holds little cachet with the public.
Mr.
Bradford was a truck driver in New York before he was mobilized.
His company relocated while he was away, so now he is now unemployed.
Eight months ago he passed the postal exam to become a mail handler, but so far he has not heard a word.


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
MAURER AND DU BOIS
An exhibition of 10 works by Alfred Maurer (1884-1932) and 10 by Guy Pene du Bois (1884-1958) may be seen at the Nardin Fine Arts Gallery in Yellow Monkey Village in Cross River from Tuesday through Feb. 16.


Get Me to the Reef on Time
YOU CAN GET MARRIED UNDERWATER, WHERE THE vows are written out on a slate; on the vertical face of a cliff, which requires the services of a rock-climbing minister; or while sky-diving from an airplane -- a caterer's nightmare.
After swinging in the direction of tradition and formality, the trend appears to be toward action weddings.
The challenges of modern marriage may actually have a lot in common with an Outward Bound experience.
But in most cases, contemporary couples simply are opting for environments that are close to their hearts.
Don Zimmer, a former manager of the Chicago Cubs and a coach of the Boston Red Sox, was married at home plate in a minor-league baseball stadium.
Lisa Lomas, a swimwear designer whose suits have been featured in Sports Illustrated, had a proper diver's wedding on a boat in the Turks and Caicos Islands.
The bride wore a white sequined wet suit.
After exchanging vows, the couple promptly plunged into the blue.


Fly Fishing Soon To Be Reeled Inside
WHAT is billed as the world's largest show for fly fishermen will be at the Garden State Exhibit Center in Somerset, N.J., Feb. 1 and 2.
There is considerable justification for this claim.
The center has an indoor show area the size of two football fields.
Steve Rajeff, holder of national and international fly casting titles will be among the experts demonstrating their skills, and many superb fly tyers will also be present, including Dick Talleur and Poul Jorgensen.


Once Just a Gunner, Kelly Is Now a Thinker
Yes, Jim Kelly threw 33 touchdown passes this season, more than any other quarterback in the National Football League, while operating in the league's most productive offense.
But Boomer Esiason, the Cincinnati Bengals' quarterback, believes the most dangerous things about Kelly can't be detected in statistics.
Esiason says that characteristics he saw Kelly exhibit during the Bills' 35-16 victory over the Bengals last October should be of utmost concern to Washington on Sunday in Super Bowl XXVI.


Political Talk
Spano's Swing Vote
Many politicians take great delight in defending their votes.
Some, like New York State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Yonkers Republican, can get so carried away that they start defending their non-votes.


U.S. Warning On Turkey
The key tourist destinations of western Turkey are relatively safe, but Americans should defer nonessential travel to the southeastern part of the country because of urban terrorist attacks, the Department of State says.
Sporadic attacks against Turkish police and civilians caused injuries and loss of life last year and continue to occur in several southeastern provinces, said a department travel advisory issued Jan. 8.
Three Americans were kidnapped, and held for three weeks, in Bingol province last August, and in Kars province, a group of foreign tourists, including Americans, was attacked by terrorists.
Turkish authorities are working actively to prevent terrorism, the advisory added.


Cuttings; Returning to Wildflowers, but Gradually
Remember a few years back when everybody had to have a wildflower meadow?
That can of seeds with the pretty picture was irresistible.
A lot of us went out and dug up part of the lawn and scattered the seeds over the newly bared earth.
Tra-la-la-la.


With Tyson's Arrival, A Day of Departures
It looks like a driver's license number: 49G049109CF116245.
But in actuality it is the official designation of what, with very little hyperbole, a local television news anchor described Friday night as "one of the most anticipated rape trials ever."
It is the case of the State of Indiana versus Michael G. Tyson, the former heavyweight champion.


The Nightclub Bouncer of the 90's: Evolution of the Grunt by the Door
The skinny guy with the wispy mustache did not look like much, sulking there at 2:15 A.M. at the curb in front of Limelight, the church-turned-thumping-dance-club on West 20th Street.
But Joe Schaefer eyed him with professional concern.
"He says he's going to torch the place," Mr. Schaefer said.

POSTINGS: Down on the Farm; Million-Dollar Mansions Near Princeton
As Kevin Dey watched the region's economy unravel in the late 1980's he wondered about the timing of his family's decision to turn Dey Farm, its 78-acre homestead near Princeton, N.J., into a new community of mansions on large lots.
But since then five residences have been built at a cost of about $1 million each at Dey Farms Estates, where lot sizes average six acres, and construction is to start in March on a sixth..
All but five of the development parcels there have been sold.


A June Wedding For Miss Plante
Dr.
Inge Rudloff Plante of Princeton, N.J., has announced the engagement of her daughter Michele Andre Plante to Eric Richard Kemp, the son of Dr. and Mrs.
Richard A. Kemp of Hartford.
A June wedding is planned.
Miss Plante, 31 years old, is also a daughter of the late Dr.
Marc A. Plante.
A graduate of Middlebury College, as is her fiance, she is a national sales executive for the children's clothing division of Adrienne Vittadini in New York.
Her mother is a psychiatrist in Lawrenceville, N.J.
The prospective bride's father also was a psychiatrist.


3 Couples and Many Clashes
SCOTT says that he makes "a lot of money off women" as the president of Slumbertown, a lingerie company, and that his wife, Stephanie ("my little stress factory"), spends twice as much as that.
When she discovers that he has bought his secretary a pair of mink earmuffs, she flushes them down the toilet.
Scott and Stephanie do not have a good marriage, and they cannot work things out.


The World; Independence From Moscow Comes at a High Price
ALL across the former Soviet empire, new governments are learning to their dismay that purported shortcuts to democracy and prosperity can be riddled with hazards.
In Ukraine and Russia, as in Estonia or Georgia, politicians who rode to power on waves of independence fever and nationalism find themselves cornered or toppled by the very forces and illusions they let loose.
The politicians are learning that breaking away from an empire is like running away from home: It's great fun until the canned pork-and-beans run out.
In every case, incipient democracies have been battered by political infighting or reversion to rule by ukase.


The Region; Plenty of Gas Arrives, But at Shortage Prices
ON Tuesday, a new natural gas pipeline from Canada will come to life as an economic anomaly, a megaproject that was planned when energy shortages were still a fresh memory but completed in an era of energy surplus, declining prices and recession.
The pipeline, the Iroquois Gas Transmission System, is by far the largest single new source of energy for the New York region since the 1950's.
It is capable of pumping enough gas yearly to replace 30 million barrels of oil, and nearly double that amount if additional pumping stations are added in upstate New York.


Poll Respondents Favor Redskins
The Washington Redskins are the American public's choice to win the Super Bowl, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
But the people who don't care or don't have an opinion about the outcome of the game outnumber those who favor the Redskins, as well as those who prefer the Buffalo Bills.
Thirty-one percent of the 945 adults interviewed by telephone said they wanted Washington to win.
Buffalo was the choice of 23 percent.


Talking: Home Buying; Helpful Data From The Seller
A HOME is like a boss or a spouse.
Only when you have known one for a few years do you really get to understand its idiosyncrasies and how to live with it.
Many of today's home buyers, having learned this from their experience with other homes, are demanding lots of information from sellers, and because buyers rule the current market, they are getting what they ask for, everything from appliance manuals to lists of skilled service people to guides for reliable car pools.


Gauguin's Mistress
To the Editor: When I read Ronald Bryden's article "Seaching for Gauguin's Tahiti" (Dec. 22), I was quickly bored with the "achievements" of Gauguin and the physical description of Tahiti.
What left a lasting and searing impression was the 13-year-old child that Gauguin used as his mistress.
What happened to her?
This, I think, is a perfect example of the desperate need for inclusion of women and minorities' histories into Western textbooks.
This child's life was treated as an artifact in the life of the "great" white male, and then entirely dismissed as if she never existed.


With Tyson's Arrival, A Day of Departures
It looks like a driver's license number: 49G049109CF116245.
But in actuality it is the official designation of what, with very little hyperbole, a local television news anchor described Friday night as "one of the most anticipated rape trials ever."
It is the case of the State of Indiana versus Michael G. Tyson, the former heavyweight champion.


Wall Street; Minneapolis Looks for a Super Payoff
The winners of the 1992 Super Bowl are: Minneapolis and Minnesota -- hosts to the game.
The Washington Redskins and the Buffalo Bills must still settle the small matter of football supremacy.
But the event should generate about $120 million worth of fresh economic activity and $7 million in new state and local taxes, according to a University of Minnesota study.
Most of the new revenues will go to the state, courtesy of its 6.5 percent sales tax.
Moreover, the city must bear the cost of policing and cleaning up after the event.
But Michael Forrester and Robert Durante, municipal bond analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's, note that many Super Bowl fans are also executives who can steer new convention business to a host city.
Tampa saw such a gain after hosting the 1991 classic, they said.


Headliners; Lost Life
At the stroke of midnight, just as C. Nicholas Conchas of San Jose, Calif., was ringing in the new year by firing a pistol into the air, the the state Children's Firearm Accident Protection Act of 1991 went into effect, making adults criminally liable if a negligently stored firearm causes the injury or death of a child.
The next day, Mr.
Conchas's 4-year-old grandson, Jesus Valencia, who had received two toy pistols for Christmas, picked up the very real .22-caliber revolver and fired a bullet into his heart, and Mr.
Conchas became the first person to be charged under the law.
Jesus's mother, Eva Conchas, says the horror of losing her child is only compounded by knowing her father could face three years in jail and a $10,000 fine if convicted.
"I don't want any more tragedy," she said.
But David Davies, the assistant district attorney who is prosecuting the case, said it is important to set an example.
"I'm being made out to be the heavy here," he said, "but the child can no longer speak."

Corrections
An article on Jan. 12 about the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey" misstated the flight path of the spaceship whose crew falls victim to HAL, the berserk computer.
The mission in the movie version was headed toward an alien sentinel orbiting Jupiter; in Arthur C. Clarke's novel, the planet was Saturn.


Diane Forese, Student, to Wed
Mr. and Mrs.
James J. Forese of Franklin Lakes, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Diane Edith Forese to Andrew Weldon Page, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
George A. Page Jr. of Marblehead, Mass.
A June wedding is planned.


Honor Asked for Brown
Sure, election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame is a lasting honor, but is it enough?
Not according to DONALD STEINBERG.
He wants to build a museum as a memorial to Paul Brown, the former coach who created both the Browns and the Bengals.
Actually, Steinberg, a retired surgeon who played under Brown at Ohio State in the early 1940's, wants the National Football League to build the museum, or at least to help pay for it by having each of the 28 teams chip in $25,000.
Brown, who died last August at the age of 82, was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1967, but Steinberg says that to insure that his memory and influence is not forgotten, he wants to establish a museum in Massillon, Ohio, where Brown coached powerhouse high school football teams.


Sack the Power Brokers
For fans who aren't trying to figure the spread and who don't live in the cities that claim the teams, the Super Bowl can be a problem: Three hours of not-so-good football (usually) preceded (always) by endless hype.
Deciding which team to support has never been easy.
This year, it will be absurdly simple.
For everyone living outside the Beltway, it is us versus them, baby.
Them being the Redskins, the team from the nation's capital, which, if you didn't already know, is inside the Beltway.
And full of insiders.


Islanders Caught Up Ice by Penguins
In the last minute of a tie game, can there be any sight more unwelcome to a goalie and a defenseman than Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr, barreling down ice for a two-on-one rush?
This was what Mark Fitzpatrick, in goal, and Uwe Krupp, on defense, were faced with late this afternoon as their Islanders were tied, 3-3, with the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins at Nassau Coliseum.
The Penguins scored and went on to win by 5-3.


Law Students Aid Imperiled Tenants
WHEN Sandra Rector was laid off from her job, she fell behind with her rent payments and feared that she would be evicted from her apartment in Huntington.
Unable to afford a lawyer, Ms.
Rector got in touch with Nassau-Suffolk Law Services and was referred to the Housing Rights Project at the Touro Law School's Law Center in Huntington.


The Executive Computer; Small Business, Handy Tools
Will hourly workers soon be "punching in" on the PC?
Replacing a time clock with Timeclock Plus, a new software product, can streamline paperwork and provide managers with a handy tool for analyzing labor costs, which typically are the bulk of a small business's budget.
Timeclock Plus (list price $149.95, with more expensive programs for Unix systems) uses the built-in clock in an I.B.M.
PC-compatible computer.
The simple opening screen asks the worker to type "1" to clock in or "2" to clock out.
It also asks for the employee's indentification number.


Production of a U.S. H-Bomb to End, Official Says
The Bush Administration will not resume production of the thermonuclear weapons carried by submarine-launched Trident II missiles, a Defense Department official said today.
The decision could result in a permanent stop for the Government's nuclear bomb-building industry, which has been on hold since 1989.


Reservations In Mexico
A telephone reservation service has been created for travelers booking hotel rooms in Mexico City.
The service enables travelers to call a toll-free number in the United States and Canada and reserve rooms in any of the 120 hotels that comprise the Mexico City Hotel and Motel Association.
The number, (800) 866-3942, is in operation from 8 A.M. until 4 P.M. (Eastern Time) and an answering service will take messages at other times.


Susanne Rubenstein to Wed in May
Lois B. Goodman of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Fred V. Rubenstein of Washington, Conn., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Susanne Renee Rubenstein, to Jonathan Mordoh, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Maurice Mordoh of Closter, N.J.
A May wedding is planned.
Ms.
Rubenstein, 26 years old, is a producer at Napoleon Videographics, a television commercial company in New York.
She graduated from Lehigh University.
Her father owns Targeted Demographics Networks, a publisher of consumer guides in New York.


Unblocking Bathtubs and Toilets
CALLING a plumber to clear a clogged toilet or other drain in an emergency can be a nuisance, but most homeowners and apartment dwellers can usually repair such problems themselves.
To clear a blocked toilet, use a flange-type plumber's plunger.
Its cup has a projecting sleeve that fits snugly into the opening at the bottom of the bowl.
Never use chemical cleaners.
They can cause injury if splashed onto the skin.


Employee Slain in Robbery At Midtown Clothing Store
The assistant manager of a children's clothing store in midtown Manhattan -- a young woman who graduated from college last spring and moved to New York in the fall -- was bound, gagged and stabbed to death in a ferocious attack with a screwdriver yesterday morning in a $7,000 robbery before the store opened.
Investigators said the 22-year-old victim, Lisa Steinberg, of 215 East 95th Street, was stabbed numerous times in the head and torso and was found dead, her hands bound at her back with duct tape, beside an open safe in an office at The Gap and The Gap Kids, adjoining stores at 250 West 57th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue.


How the Japanese Learned to Drink Bourbon; Buy More Sushi?
To the Editor:
Leslie H. Gelb is on target when he writes that President Bush and his advisers do not "know the first thing about Japan" ("Three Whine Mice . . .," column, Jan. 13).
After just returning from teaching two semesters of American history and culture to Japanese students north of Tokyo, allow me to place the recent Bush visit into the Japanese perspective.

Review/Jazz; Dickerson And Vibes, Ruminatively
Jazz performance is so constrained by the rules of its history that an eccentric show becomes startling.
Walt Dickerson, a vibraphonist who opened a six-day stand at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday night, put on a mildly bizarre set that pointed out exactly how jazz performances work.
Mr.
Dickerson played quietly, letting his mallets scurry over the vibraphone like mice on a tin roof.
At times his music dissolved into silence, only to blossom into lush explosions of shining sound.
Everything Mr.
Dickerson did pointed inward, as if he were the most important person in the room.
His ruminations were played for himself; self-expression dominated.


Board Schedules Vote On Jay Condemnation
SIXTEEN months after the County Board of Legislators tried unsuccessfully to condemn the Jay Property in Rye, it plans to initiate the process again at a meeting tomorrow morning.
Last week 13 legislators signed a resolution of intent to condemn the 23-acre site, sufficient votes to pass the measure.
The Board's new Republican chairman, Stephen P. Tenore, had asked his fellow legislators to direct the county administration to "proceed immediately with whatever it takes to condemn" the property.
The 13 legislators, one more than needed, have agreed to approve whatever funds are necessary to meet the purchase price determined by the courts in a condemnation proceeding.


Style Makers; Thomas Hucker, Furniture Designer
Thomas Hucker wants his furniture to be different.
The tables in what he calls his "ambiental series" are about 44 inches square and 16 inches high; each stimulates touch, smell and hearing in its own way.
"The idea of making the tables basically the same was to throw everyone's attention into the ambiental qualities," the 36-year-old designer said.
Two of the seven tables stress tactility and scent.
The first has an herbal fragrance and a smooth ebony finish.
The other is made of neoprene, with the industrial odor replaced with the smell of leather.

Headliners; Political Partying
New York City Council President Andrew J. Stein invited 1,500 well-off supporters to the Waldorf-Astoria last week to celebrate his nativity -- and his mayoral campaign -- and came away with a birthday take of around $2 million.
The campaign contributions, in chunks of up to $50,000, included many gifts from people who do some business with the city and probably wouldn't mind doing more.
After songs by Frank Sinatra and reincarnation jokes by Shirley MacLaine, Mr.
Stein got down to the business of bashing Mayor David N. Dinkins and the public campaign financing law whose $6,500-per-donor limit Mr.
Dinkins is abiding by.
"There is nobody in this city who thinks public financing, which brought us David Dinkins, has made New York a better place," he said.
But critics including the Mayor said Mr.
Stein's fund-raising strategy was unseemly.
Mr.
Dinkins said, "It will not take a rocket scientist to see a person doesn't contribute $50,000 simply for routine access."


Anne F. Kohn, Travel Agent, 68
Anne Frankenthaler Kohn, a retired educator and travel agent, died on Thursday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.

During World War II she worked as a mathematician at Columbia University's Statistical Research Group, a secret project to aid the military.

'Darling! Listen to Me'
If you ask Julie Kavner to describe the roles she's played during her 18-year career, she sighs and in her honeyed gravel voice says with perfect dispiritedness: "A nice person."
Almost every one of the major roles held by the 41-year-old actress has been a woman who is supportive, sympathetic or self-effacingly funny.
From her first professional acting job playing Brenda, Valerie Harper's younger sister on the sitcom "Rhoda," to her most recent role as the voice of Marge Simpson, the long-suffering mother on the animated comedy series "The Simpsons," Kavner has consistently been the second banana.


Inflation Is One Thing . . .
To the Editor:
Accompanying Frank Rich's article "Previews, That Broadway Malady"  [ Dec. 22 ]  there was a photograph of an ad for "Cabaret" in 1966.
Nearly buried in the small type at the bottom of that ad was one major reason for the collapse of Broadway: ticket prices.


Switzerland's Highest Hotel
MOST visitors to Zermatt stay in the valley and look up at the mountains.
Last summer, we had the opposite experience, staying on a mountain and looking down upon Zermatt and, much more exciting, enjoying a close-up view of the Alpine giants that surround it.
My husband and I were staying at the Kulmhotel Gornergrat, the highest real hotel in Switzerland.
Like the peaks thrusting up around us, we were above the clouds.
In the Alps, an overnight sojourn in the mountains typically means a night at an Alpine Club hut, where thin mattresses are laid side by side on a long wooden shelf and you can count yourself lucky if only one of your neighbors snores.
Rare is the hut with an indoor toilet, and cold water washing is the rule.
Arrival is by foot, usually after a three- or four-hour uphill hike.
The compensation is the scenery, often spectacular.
The glory of the high Alpine landscape, however, can be enjoyed in remarkable comfort at the Kulmhotel, above Zermatt at 10,168 feet.


CAMPUS LIFE: Princeton; Ban on Keg Beer Being Pulled Back But With Limits
Bowing to heavy pressure from students and alumni to alter a semester-old ban on serving keg beer that he himself had termed "silly," Dr.
Harold T. Shapiro, the Princeton University president, has accepted recommendations to allow it at specific university events.
Dr.
Shapiro ratified a unanimous resolution by the Council of the Princeton University Community on Jan. 13 that allows the senior class, graduate students and the alumni council -- the three groups on campus most affected by the keg ban because most of them are above the 21-year-old drinking age -- to begin serving beer from kegs, provided that they limit access to alcoholic beverages somewhat and shift the focus of their parties away from drinking.


U.S. Linked to Iraqi Scud Launchers
America's secret assistance to Iraq may have helped Saddam Hussein carry out one of the biggest surprises of the Persian Gulf war: Using an undetected fleet of mobile launchers to fire dozens of Scud missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Many of these launchers may have been manufactured for Iraq by an American company.

She is a vice president in Seattle in the research department of Dain Bosworth, a brokerage.
Her father is a management analyst with the Defense Department at Bedford, Mass.


Long Island Man Loses His Life While Performing a Good Deed
It must have seemed like a minor good deed to a man who devoted his spare time to fighting fires.
But when John Dell'Olio tried to drag aside a piece of aluminum that was blocking traffic on the Throgs Neck Bridge on Friday afternoon he wound up giving his life.
A large piece of aluminum, about 20 feet by 8 feet, blew off the roof of a tractor-trailer traveling south on the bridge over the East River about 2 P.M.
Friday, the police said.

Heidi Reavis, Lawyer, Weds
Helen Diana Reavis, the daughter of Thetis Reavis of New York, and John W. Reavis Jr. of Santa Fe, N.M., was married last evening to Steven Michael Engel, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Rabbi Joy Levitt officiated at The Americas Society in New York.
Ms.
Reavis, 32 years old, is known as Heidi, and is keeping her name.
She is a lawyer with the firm of Beldock, Levine &amp; Hoffman in New York.
She graduated cum laude from Smith College and received a law degree from the University of Chicago.
Her mother is the vice president for public affairs at the Foreign Policy Association in New York.
Her father, who is retired, was an independent maker of documentary films.


A Radical Look for Hall of Fame
Judging by the difficulty renegades have faced making it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, you might think it was the National Football League owners who make the selections.
Actually, the final choices are made by news 31 media representatives, and if their seeming reluctance to honor otherwise worthy rebels suggests that the football writers and broadcasters have been mere lackeys for the N.F.L. establishment, well, the lackeys declared their independence yesterday.


Quotations of the Day
"We're trying to convince people we're human beings and not mascots. They're making fools of themselves and of us in the process." -- CLYDE BELLECOURT, executive director of the American Indian Movement, on sports names like Washington Redskins.  [ 14:5. ] "In the context of sports, those nicknames are extremely positive. You think of great players and great rivalries." -- PAUL TAGLIABUE, commissioner of the National Football League.  [ 14:5. ]


Get Ready for a Less-Than-Super Morning After
LIKE spectral blimps, three big heads haunt the Super Bowl.
When the game is over, we will have Iron Mike, the Owner from Hell and Tark the Shark back in our faces.
Mike Tyson's trial begins tomorrow in Indianapolis and the basic beef -- did the 25-year-old former heavyweight champion rape an 18-year-old woman who was a beauty-pageant contestant -- may get lost in the sauce.
Commentators are already loading the plate with discussions about the difficulty of communication between men and women, the entitlement of Powerboys to grab and squeeze, and the danger of greedy girls who kiss and sue.


The Smile Button For Tragedy
What does comedy have that farce doesn't need?
A heart.
Especially when the farce is by Georges Feydeau.
Not that the French critic of middle-class misconduct was mean.
But he had no illusions about people, according to John Mortimer, who should know.
Mr.
Mortimer, the retired English barrister, playwright, novelist and creator of the TV series "Rumpole of the Bailey," has long been praised for his Feydeau translations.
One of them, "A Little Hotel on the Side," opens today on Broadway in a production by the National Actors Theater at the Belasco.
The cast of 34 includes Tony Randall and Maryann Plunkett, Lynn Redgrave, Paxton Whitehead, Rob Lowe and Madeleine Potter.
In the introduction to "Three Boulevard Farces," his published Feydeau translations, Mr.
Mortimer writes: "Farce is tragedy played at about 120 revolutions a minute." And what is at stake for the characters, he notes, "is not their lives but their reputations."

Girl in Track Meet Collapses and Dies
In what the police and medical authorities are tentatively calling a freak case of heart failure, a 9-year-old Long Island girl collapsed yesterday while competing in a track meet in Brooklyn and died soon after being taken to a nearby hospital.
The authorities said Jessica Varady, from the Suffolk County village of Selden, collapsed at 10:25 A.M. while running a 55-meter dash at the Colgate Games, a series of women's track meets in the Pratt Institute gymnasium in Clinton Hill.

Of the six players who arrived on the Islanders' roster in the Day of Trades (Oct. 25), the best of the bunch has been Uwe Krupp, a big defenseman who is beginning to show a streak of pride to go with his balanced talents.
Despite the Islanders' 5-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday at Nassau Coliseum, Krupp was eager afterward to stress the positive about a team that lacks a positive self-image in its own building and almost any image at all in the greater metropolitan area.


Key Positions Filled at ABC
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. has filled two important management positions with executives from its sales staff.

The following fixed-income issues are scheduled for this week: TAXABLE  MONDAY


Mille Lacs Lake Journal; Minnesota Winter Puts Fishing on Ice
Atop the frozen surface of this expansive lake, Ruthie Stowowy dropped two fishing lines into holes through nearly three feet of ice.
About 30 minutes later, she pulled in her first catch of the day: a three-pound perch, its yellow scales gleaming as it squirmed in her hand.
"That's a keeper," the 64-year-old retiree said.
She returned to watch her lines, sitting on a small couch in her fish house, a small, gas-heated dwelling that had been pulled three miles out on the lake's frozen surface in December by a combination bulldozer-log skidder.

Tarkanian Anchors Another Rebel Episode
It seems that every week for Jerry Tarkanian is like the old television show "That Was the Week That Was." Last week was no different.
It started with a reported comment by a member of the Board of Regents, Carolyn Sparks, saying that she was tired of hearing about the Nevada-Las Vegas coach recruiting "ghetto kids." The players' response was to tape a photo of the Regent to the back of their shorts in practice.
For Tarkanian, although the topic was different it was still controversy, nothing new in his 19-year tenure at the school.
This school year alone, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has the school on probation, the school president is pushing Tarkanian out of his job while Tarkanian is trying to rebuild after losing the five starters from last season's 29-1 Rebel team.

Bronx Jail Barge to Open, Though the Cost Is Steep
New York City's most expensive jail -- a $161 million, 800-bed prison barge -- will open in the Bronx next month, 18 months behind schedule and $35 million over its original budget.
Officials in the Correction Department, which operates the city's jail system, attributed the high price tag to unanticipated design and construction problems.
An additional $9 million was spent to prepare a dock site, raising the total cost to $170 million.


BBDO to Assist On Doritos Account
Tracy-Locke, which has spent several months working on changing the creative approach of the advertising for Doritos snack chips, has called in an in-house rival, BBDO New York, for assistance.
The agency said it had not determined exactly what help it would need.
The two agencies, both units of the Omnicom Group, crossed paths four months ago when Frito-Lay, the maker of Doritos, reassigned the regional advertising account for another brand, Lay's potato chips, to BBDO from Tracy-Locke in Dallas.


SUPER BOWL XXVI: Sports of The Times; The Bills Just Loked Like Rank Outsiders
IN the Super Bowl, even the gatecrashers arrive in limousines.
One can imagine chief executive officers drinking vintage wine in the leather-lined sanctuaries of their stretches while their corporate vice presidents work the streets looking for tickets.
No, doctor, there are no underdogs at the Super Bowl, even though the American Conference has now lost eight straight times to the more physical National Conference.
In the latest, the Bills self-destructed, 37-24, to Washington for their second straight Super Bowl loss.

Critic's Notebook; For a Change, Popular Films Win Top Prizes at Sundance
Someone must have told the Sundance Film Festival to lighten up.
At the awards ceremony on Saturday night that concluded this festival of independent films -- more noted for their sincerity than their wit -- the major prizes in the drama competition went to two of the most popular and accessible works in competition.
The jury prize, awarded by a panel of four judges, went to "In the Soup," an artsy but crowd-pleasing little black-and-white comedy about a struggling film maker and an aging con man.
The audience award, a better gauge of a film's commercial prospects because it is selected by viewers' ballots, went to "The Waterdance," an autobiographical story of a paraplegic whose tragedy is laced with sharp, engaging humor.
Last year's festival was criticized for being too esoteric.
This year, Sundance came back with a surprising ability to laugh, sometimes at itself.

Question Box
Super Bowl Quarterbacks
Q.
In Phil Simms (1987) and Jeff Hostetler (1991), the New York Giants had two Super Bowl winning quarterbacks as teammates for the entire regular season of
1991. Has any other National Football League team been so fortunate?
A.
Having two such qualified passers on one roster is somewhat of a passing fancy, for only one other team can brag about it in the 24 seasons it has been possible.
When the Miami Dolphins opened the 1973 season as defending Super Bowl champions, their starting quarterback was Bob Griese.
He had called the signals in the Super Bowl VII victory over the Washington Redskins eight months earlier.
Behind Griese was the veteran Earl Morrall.
He was the winning quarterback for the Baltimore Colts against the Dallas Cowboys in the 1971 Super Bowl.

Kuwaiti Gave Consistent Account of Atrocities
To the Editor:
Hold on to your hats.
The grand campaign to rewrite the history of the Persian Gulf war is on.
And the campaign of revisionist history begins with rewriting the causes of that war.
If you thought that the cause of the war was the brutal invasion of Kuwait by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, you are wrong.
If you thought that the cause was Saddam Hussein's reckless and premeditated aggression that gave him control of Kuwait's vast oil resources and imminent domination of the giant Saudi oil fields -- giving him mastery of the energy jugular of the world -- you are wrong.
If you thought the cause of the war was his horrendous human rights violations -- the verified poison-gassing of his own citizens, and verified torture and murder -- you are wrong.
If you thought the cause of the war was Saddam Hussein's growing nuclear capability, his huge stock of biological and chemical weapons and missile capabilities -- you are wrong.


Kuwaiti Gave Consistent Account of Atrocities; Retracted Testimony
To the Editor:
In his effort to buttress the unsupported claim by Nayirah al-Sabah that Iraqi soldiers removed babies from Kuwait City incubators, Thomas E. Eidson, president of Hill and Knowlton, in response to my Jan. 6 Op-Ed article, makes a curious choice for a corroborating witness (letter, Jan. 17).
Mr.
Eidson cites the assertion at a United Nations Security Council hearing by Dr.
Ibraheem Behbehani, head of the Kuwaiti Red Crescent, that he supervised the burial of 120 newborn babies after the Iraqi invasion, and personally buried 40 newborn babies "that had been taken from their incubators by  [ Iraqi ]  soldiers."

Bias Crimes Hold Steady, but Leave Many Scars
Their encounters with hatred came as a mellow May day dissolved into evening.
A young black man and his Hispanic girlfriend were talking amicably in a restaurant in the Baychester section of the Bronx.
According to a police synopsis, two white men began staring malevolently at them.
After a while, one snidely challenged the black man, "What did you say, nigger?" The white man then punched him in the head and shoved his pregnant girlfriend.
Before fleeing, the white men warned the black man that the next time they saw him they would kill him.

U.N.'S FUND CRISIS WORSENS AS ROLE IN SECURITY RISES
At a meeting here on Friday, President Bush and the leaders of the 14 other members of the Security Council are expected to call on the United Nations to play a growing role in preserving peace in trouble spots around the globe.
But the organization finds itself facing a deepening financial crisis because many of these same member nations are not paying their share for the operations.
The United Nations has been called upon to mount 8 new peacekeeping operations since 1988.
In its previous 43 years of existence, since its founding in 1945, there were 13 such operations.
This year it is planning ambitious new operations in Cambodia and Yugoslavia involving a total of some 15,000 troops and police personnel.
Those operations could double the organization's peacekeeping budget to more than $1 billion.

Now that the price of a New York City subway token has risen to $1.25, a further adjustment is in order.
For the rider who buys more than one at a time, how about replacing the 10-pack with something that multiplies to a convenient whole-dollar total?
The Transit Authority introduced the 10-pack in 1983, with good reason.
A 10-pack covered a week's rides back and forth to work.
But as the fare rose to $1.15, people who paid with a $20 bill were often stuck with an unwanted bundle of ones in their $8.50 change.

Zullow, a research fellow in social psychiatry at Columbia University's School of Public Health.

Why Favor Less Sturdy Japanese Cars?
To the Editor:
It would seem to be very easy bashing American-made products, particularly the automobile ("Don't Brake for Detroit," Op-Ed, Jan. 7).
There is, in certain segments of the motoring press, a bias toward Japanese-made cars perhaps directly related to the amount of advertising space taken by specific auto makers.


Reviews/Television; Cybill Shepherd in a Tale Of a Crime Turned Sour
With few exceptions, the quality of made-for-cable movies ranges from modestly successful to disastrous.
Skimpy budgets and tight shooting schedules are not generally conducive to churning out masterpieces.
Gradually, though, the good cable movies are getting better.
Tonight's example on TNT at 8 P.M., 10 P.M. and midnight is "Memphis," in which Cybill Shepherd serves as star, co-executive producer and, with Larry McMurtry and Susan Rhinehart, co-writer.
But also, alas, the clinkers are becoming almost unbearable.
Just peek for a few minutes at tomorrow night's Lifetimepremiere, at 9, of "Notorious," a pointless updating of the 1946 Alfred Hitchcock film.
"Memphis," which is based on the novel "September, September," by Shelby Foote, takes place in September 1957, when the headlines and television news reports were dominated by civil rights protests in the South.
Driving up from the Mississippi Delta, three drifters arrive in Tennessee with what they think is a fail-safe ploy to make some money.
Reeny (Ms. Shepherd), Podjo (J. E. Freeman) and Rufus (John Laughlin) will kidnap the grandson of the wealthiest black businessman in Memphis, a banker named Tio Wiggins (Moses Gunn), who is not likely to get much help from the all-white local police.

Hands Off the Economy
The stock market has lurched into overdrive, betting that the Federal Reserve's shift to low interest rates means that an economic rebound is just months away.
But unlike the speculators who face perhaps 50-50 odds, President Bush in his State of the Union Address tomorrow is expected to make a wager that arguably has a 100 percent chance of being wrong.
Recession year "borrow and stimulate" packages have a habit of missing the present and haunting the future.
And in the present circumstances, the case against the grab bag of stimulants for housing, investment and the middle-class consumer that the President is expected to announce is especially compelling.

Results Plus
SKIING Tomba Clinches Title  Alberto Tomba of Italy clinched the World Cup slalom title for the season yesterday by winning the last slalom before the Winter Olympics in France, where he will be defending the two gold medals he won at the 1988 Olympic Games.
Tomba nailed his seventh victory of the season in Wengen, Switzerland, with a two-heat total of 1 minute 34.34 seconds, which was 62-hundredths of a second ahead of the overall World Cup leader, Paul Accola of Switzerland.
Armin Bittner of Germany was third, 85-hundredths of a second behind.
Tomba, who also leads the season giant slalom standing, showed that almost nothing can stop him.
A gate pole he uprooted fell in front of his skis in the first run.
But he still was second-fastest behind Ole Christian Furuseth of Norway, who fell in his second run.
On Tomba's second run, he nearly fell over backward at the top of a slope and then, near the finish, someone threw a snowball in his right eye.
Tomba won the slalom and the giant slalom at the Calgary Olympics and is the favorite in the events at the Games in the French Alps.
Accola now has 1,270 points in the overall standing, and Tomba 1,060. (AP) Compagnoni Takes Slalom Event: Deborah Compagnoni switched to longer skis and tamed a lightning-fast course in Morzine, France, yesterday to win a supergiant slalom, ending a six-year World Cup drought by Italian women.
A two-time world champion, Ulrike Maier, was second, followed by Norway's Merete Fjeldavli and American Diann Roffe, whose fourth place (1:11.64) was the best supergiant finish by a United States skier this season.
Compagnoni, 21, a giant-slalom specialist who usually prefers technical races to those in which speed is predominant, completed the 1.1-mile course in 1:11.02.
Maier, an Austrian who won supergiant world titles in 1989 and 1991, finished in 1:11.46.
Fjeldavli, whose best previous finish was a tie for ninth earlier this season, was third in 1:11.61.
The women will complete their three-day World Cup series today in Morzine with a giant slalom. (AP) HORSE RACING Thunder Rumble Wins  Thunder Rumble shook off an early challenge from Speaker Phone and ran off to a two-length victory yesterday in Aqueduct's $70,700 Count Fleet Stakes for 3-year-olds.

Lift Taxes? Economists Vote Yes
As President Bush and Congressional Democrats seek to outdo each other in proposing tax cuts to stimulate the economy, many economists say that what the nation needs in the long run is exactly the opposite.
Higher taxes, these economists say, are needed to prevent America's competitiveness from slipping further by providing money for improving schools, beefing up research and development and modernizing highways, railroads and airports.

Market Place; Healthy Growth From Fresh Fruit
THE DOLE FOOD COMPANY was cruising along comfortably last year, with strong demand for its fresh fruits and vegetables helping to push its earnings and stock price sharply higher.
Then came the great banana debacle.
With demand for bananas growing rapidly, Dole entered into costly contracts with independent producers to insure that it would have an adequate supply.
When banana prices declined in the summer after an unexpected price war, however, those contracts suddenly became very bad deals, and the company's profit margins got squashed.
Dole's third-quarter earnings, released in October, were down 41 percent, blindsiding investors who only months earlier had been assured by Dole's chairman, David H. Murdock, that profits for the full year would be substantially higher than in 1990.

With Injuries Behind Him, Bowie Gets Nets Healthy

"I've got 12 screws in my right leg and 35 screws in my left leg," said the 30-year-old Bowie, who has seven years' experience in the National Basketball Associaton but came into this season with more games missed from injury as a pro than played, 305 to 269.
Through it all he's learned not to worry about getting injured anymore.

Can 4 Magazines Stay in Fashion?
Like the shiver of expectation that sweeps through the fashion world at the hint of a new look, Hearst's snapping up of the editor in chief of British Vogue to head Harper's Bazaar has sent a frisson through the fiercely competitive world of fashion magazines.
Not that any of the players have spent much time recently worrying about Harper's Bazaar, once the undisputed leader in the field and now but a pale contestant.
But with advertising pages still plunging for Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar and Mirabella, and newsstand sales not doing much better, the unspoken question in this winter of discontent is whether enough advertising exists to support four fashion magazines.


Russia May Limit West's Oil Profits
Reflecting the caution with which Russia is approaching foreign investment in its oil industry, Viktor Lopukhin, the Fuel and Energy Minister, said today that his Government would push for practices that prevent Western oil companies from earning too big a return on their investments.
One such practice will be the greater use of competitive bidding to win the right to explore for oil or to develop existing fields, Mr.
Lopukhin said in an interview in Tyumen, the capital of Tyumen Province and the center of Russia's huge western Siberian oilfields.
The Russians will also try to avoid exclusive exploration or development rights.
And joint ventures, popular now, might be de-emphasized because they can overvalue the contribution of the foreign partners and undervalue that of the Russian partners.

Lucas, 47 years old, was the creator of the "Star Wars" sagas and an architect of the three Indiana Jones films.
Now he has completed the two-hour premiere of "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles," which was made by Paramount and Lucasfilm and scheduled to be broadcast on ABC in early March.
It is to be followed by about 15 hourlong episodes, possibly more, covering the years 1908 to 1918.


Washington Makes Its Presence Felt
From the day they began preparing for this game, the Washington Redskins wanted to punish the Buffalo Bills: make the runners not want to run, the receivers not want to receive and the quarterback not want to throw.
Tonight, with linebacker Wilber Marshall leading the way, Washington implemented its game plan so thoroughly that the National Football League's most potent offense was not merely shut down but, at a key part of the game, stripped of its desire to score.


Fight Over Florio Budget Plan Heating Up in Hostile Trenton
Facing his biggest fiscal and political challenges since he assumed office two years ago, Gov.
Jim Florio will present a 1992-93 budget plan on Tuesday to the Republican-controlled Legislature that he says will include no new taxes.
But Mr.
Florio's decision to base his reported $15.5 billion budget plan on a 7 percent sales tax has set the stage for the first major clash between the Governor, a Democrat, and the Legislature, where Republicans took control about two weeks ago vowing to reduce the tax to 6 percent.

A Crisis Built on Debt; Despite Its Strong Reputation in Retailing, Macy's Choices in the 80's Left It Crippled
The formidable Herald Square flagship of R. H. Macy &amp; Company is a New York landmark and one of the world's best-known stores.
Yet for all its name recognition and loyal following the 134-year-old retailer has come to the brink of filing for bankruptcy protection.
What went wrong?
The answer has little to do with Macy's stores or merchandise.
Macy's problems -- like those of so many companies now in bankruptcy -- stem from the billions of dollars it borrowed in the 1980's to enable its management to buy the company from its stockholders.
That $3.5 billion leveraged buyout in 1986, led by its chairman and chief executive, Edward S. Finkelstein, erected some high hurdles that the company was never able to clear.


'Buy American': Remedy or Tunnel Vision?
Intended or not, President Bush's trade mission to Japan has now stirred an emotional wave of "buy American" fervor across the recession-pocked land.
But economists and trade experts say the movement is a dubious remedy for the underlying ills of the American economy.
Sentiments reached a peak last Wednesday, when the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, after withering public attack, rescinded the $122 million contract it had issued to a Japanese company for new rail cars for a mass transit system.


Rypien Is Most Thankful About One That Got Away
Mark Rypien, the Redskins' quarterback, who was chosen as the most valuable player of the Super Bowl tonight, figured that maybe the single finest moment in the most important game of his career came not on any of the 18 passes he threw for 292 yards in Washington's victory over the Bills.
Not even on either of the two scoring passes he threw.
It came, he said, on an incomplete pass.
"The big play was when a pass I threw to Gary Clark was batted down," he said.

Woman Is Accused of Trying to Set Fire to Club
A 33-year-old Brooklyn woman who had been ejected from a Manhattan nightclub for fighting with another woman was arrested early yesterday after she returned with a can of gasoline and threatened to burn the club down, the police said.
The suspect, Yvonne Pertha of 309 Patchen Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, was angry because the money she paid to get into the club, Octagon, at 555 West 33d Street, was not returned when she was ejected around midnight Saturday, the police said.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY A PICTURE OF BIAS
When racial and ethnic confrontations occur, who gets hurt and how, and how do the police classify them as bias incidents?
Despite a high number of bias crimes and the public outcry they tend to provoke -- 540 were reported by the police last year -- the number has remained fairly constant for the last four years.
Records were not kept before 1981, but "in all probability, there were more bias crimes 30 or 40 years ago," said Inspector William T. Wallace, commander of the Police Department's Bias Incident Investigating Unit.

AN OVERHAUL FOR THE TAXI INDUSTRY?
The Dinkins administration will propose a fundamental reorganization of New York City's taxi industry with an eye toward improving service outside central Manhattan.
Its proposals include the elimination of the free market in tax medallions, the creation of a new medallion for car services in the outer boroughs and a six-fold increase in enforcement against unlicensed cabs.

THE HIGH COST OF A JAIL BARGE
New York City's most expensive jail, a $161 million 800-bed barge, will open next month in the Bronx, far behind schedule and over budget.
The city's Correction Department attributed the cost overruns to unexpected design and construction delays and charges linked to the preparation of a dock site.
But the chairman of the Board of Correction, an independent body that monitors city prisons, said the shipbuilder should have foreseen the problems.

DO BOND RATINGS MATTER?
When Mayor David N. Dinkins delivered his State of the City address earlier this month, he said the city was being held to a "higher standard" than its bond ratings would imply.
Surprisingly, some bond raters agree, saying bond ratings are put in perspective by issues like public safety, adequate sanitation and education.

Macy Prepares for Bankruptcy
R.
H Macy &amp; Company's retinue of lawyers and investment bankers worked yesterday to assemble a financing package that the retailer will need if it files for bankruptcy protection, as is expected.

They reiterated their belief that a bankruptcy filing is imminent.
Macy's board is expected to meet today to decide whether to proceed with the filing.


Why Favor Less Sturdy Japanese Cars?; A Model American
To the Editor:
Russell Baker acknowledges his error in calling the Duesenberg a car of German make ("That Stands for Car," column, Jan. 11).
The Duesenberg is indeed American.
It was named and built by the Duesenberg brothers, Frederich Samuel and August Samuel.
They were raised on a farm in Iowa, but were born in Lippe, Germany.
They arrived in Rockford, Iowa, in 1885 when only 8 or 9 years old.
They first repaired and sold bicycles, and later designed and built engines and ultimately cars.
Their first car was completed on Feb. 19, 1906, with the financial backing of Edward R. Mason, a Des Moines lawyer.
The factory was called the Mason Motor Company and the car was called a Mason.
Later models carried the Duesenberg name.

She was 41 years old.
Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said.
She had talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission, and even before she knew she would be stricken, she was active in AIDS organizations because of the epidemic's toll on colleagues and friends.

New Portuguese Flavor Irks Church's Old Guard
The street sign in front of St.

It is that contrast -- between the fading Polish-American presence here in the Ironbound area of Newark and the large and growing Portuguese and Brazilian community that is replacing it -- that accounted for the presence of about 50 Polish-speaking parishioners picketing their own church here this morning.


In the Aisles, Shoppers Voice Dismay
Evie Wollman, 76 years old, was in the furniture department on the ninth floor of Macy's Herald Square store yesterday.
"I would like to buy a couple of chairs," she said, adding, in a note of potential impulse that is sweet music to retailers everywhere, "and maybe some sheets."
As newspapers and radio and television stations reported that bankruptcy proceedings to protect R. H. Macy &amp; Company from its creditors were imminent, Mrs.
Wollman -- "nee Bender," she said -- had come from the Bronx to go shopping with her friend, Ida Rubinstein.
And though their trip to 34th Street could not be described as a pilgrimage exactly, both women had memories of the store that recalled better days.

If Frogs Had Wings
President Bush went to New Hampshire the other day to tell voters that he cares about their economic distress.
But when asked whether he would agree to further extend last year's extension of unemployment insurance benefits, he dismissed the question curtly: "If a frog had wings, he wouldn't hit his tail on the ground -- too hypothetical."
There's nothing hypothetical about the determination of Congressional Democrats to add still more weeks to the 13 to 20 extra weeks of insurance payments that were added last fall.
The House Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to vote on a 13-week extension Tuesday, just hours before Mr.
Bush's State of the Union Address.

Review/Rock; Fans Urged to 'Go Crazy' and They Do
Waterproof eyeliner must have been invented for performers like Ozzy Osbourne, who regularly punctuated his concert on Friday night at the Paramount by dipping his head in a bucket of water, then flinging the contents into the front rows.
Mr.
Osbourne is rock's most cheerful ghoul, singing about strange compulsions, unholy desires, mass destruction and Judgment Day.
His concerts, however, are like pep rallies, where Mr.
Osbourne urges his fans to sing along and "go crazy." At the Paramount the audience, overwhelmingly male and mostly wearing black T-shirts, stayed on its feet throughout the set; "I love you all!" Mr.
Osbourne kept shouting.
As the singer for Black Sabbath in the 1970's and on his own during the 1980's, Mr.
Osbourne laid the foundation for speed-metal with songs that bash and pummel heavy-metal riffs while lyrics ponder the pervasiveness of evil, sometimes from the perspective of a killer or a lost soul.
He has a gift for writing ambiguous lyrics; in "No More Tears," the title song of his current album (Epic), it's hard to tell whether the woman he's singing about is alive or dead.

In Pittsburgh, Laid-Off Workers to Cook Up Civic Pride Along With Bread
Here in Steel Town, which lost 100,000 manufacturing jobs over the last decade, the start of a new bakery is being heralded with as much hoopla as a new sports team.
Workers are preparing to brand the city's north side with the bakery's neon sign, 14 feet high, 136 feet long and visible from the moon.
It will say, "City Pride Bakery: The Bakery With a Heart."
Experts say City Pride is the nation's first start-up of a major manufacturing company intended to be owned in full eventually by its employees, almost all of whom are being hired from welfare rolls and long-term unemployment lines.
Many of its workers hadlost their old jobs when the city's last commercial bakery closed in 1989 and organized to obtain government loans and private investments to establish the $9 million company.

The Redskins, and the Roof, Fall on the Bills
This Super Bowl was supposed to be a high-scoring affair. It was.
This Super Bowl was supposed to match the creative wits of teams with strikingly different but, in the end, equal schemes.
It did not.


Essay; Macho Feminism, R.I.P.
A petty annoyance that contributed to Gov.
Bill Clinton's defeat in 1980 was his wife's refusal to adopt his name: it rankled many voters that Hillary Rodham, who met her future husband at Yale Law School, was too ardently feminist to permit herself to be called "Mrs. Clinton."
The Clintons, man and wife, learned plenty from that early slapping-down by the Arkansas electorate.
"You can't lead without listening," the chastened former hotshot told voters the next time out.
Ms.
Rodham joined in this by taking on the traditional style of "Mrs. Clinton"; they've been winners ever since.

French Boat Measures Up To New Zealand's Zip
Marc Pajot, skipper for the French team in the America's Cup trial competition, tends to be a soft-spoken, seldom-boastful yachtsman.
But he could hardly contain his happiness Saturday, despite his team's loss to New Zealand.
Losing wasn't the point.
More important, the French sailboat, Ville de Paris, appeared able to keep up with the New Zealand yacht in speed during their 20.3-mile match.
The French said a tactical mistake cost them the race, which New Zealand won by 56 seconds.


Mayor Seeks Solution To N.Y. Garbage Crisis
To the Editor:
Your Jan. 18 news article on my tenure as New York City's Sanitation Commissioner represents an unfair and misleading account of my views.
The article, without directly quoting me, said I had faulted Mayor David N. Dinkins for failing to acknowledge the city's waste-disposal crisis and for not supporting recycling.
I did say that most elected officials are not willing to confront the difficult issues of building new waste facilities because the consequences of inaction would not be apparent within their terms of office.
However, I specifically exempted the Mayor from this characterization because he has -- to the city's long-term benefit -- been willing to recognize this need.


Travel Industry Is Experiencing A Sudden Surge
After two years of reduced travel, Americans are on the move again, producing an unexpected spurt in bookings for cruise ships, hotels and airlines in recent weeks.
Trans-Atlantic flights are on the rise, travel industry executives say, and tour operators, who just a month ago were bemoaning a slowdown in bookings for Hawaii, now report an upsurge of fresh business.
Airlines that until recently were unsure whether to add flights to Florida and other warm-weather destinations now say they will, and so far this month almost 1,400 flight attendants have been recalled -- the largest number since May 1990.


Washington Leaves Buffalo With the Deficit

Don't Tear Down the Naumburg Bandshell; Strike Up the Band
To the Editor:
"Central Park Bandshell Has Become Irrelevant" (letter, Jan. 14), calling for removal of the "unwieldy" Naumburg Bandshell, was dismaying.
It is one of my, and perhaps millions of others, cherished memories.
Let it be refurbished and used by school bands or by small theater groups.
Renew rather than destroy what was good about our past.
Besides, band music is not dead.
A tour of community parks in the summer would attest to this.
A plaque with the Naumburg family name in brass would be a dead monument to a living tradition.

The director MARTIN SCORSESE will make Troy, N.Y., the primary location for filming "The Age of Innocence," city officials said.
The movie, a love story set in Manhattan in the 1870's, is based on the novel by Edith Wharton and stars Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Location managers told The Associated Press that they picked Troy, just north of Albany, for its architectural wealth.
The City Manager, STEVEN DWORSKY, said the city's streets will be buried in dirt and street lights, signs, storefronts and fire hydrants will be removed or disguised for the movie.
Weather permitting, filming in Troy will start in mid-March.

The first touchdown reversal caused by instant replay in Super Bowl history -- when a replay caught Redskins receiver Art Monk's foot out of bounds in the first quarter -- "will make it awfully hard to say you're not going to use it anymore," said Sandy Grossman, who directed the game's broadcast for CBS.
"You don't necessarily want to be a part of the process, but if you are, you are," Grossman said.
He added that "the process won't go away" if the National Football League eliminates review by replay.
"We'll keep showing what we have to 110 million viewers," he said.

The Best Performer? It's Madden in a Rout
At 6:31 P.M.
Central Standard Time yesterday evening, after a Gerald Riggs touchdown put the Washington Redskins up by 17-0 in the Super Bowl, John Madden gave up on the hapless Buffalo Bills.
He used his TeleStrator to show a blimp equipped with a remote-controlled camera tethered to the Metrodome roof.
"This means nothing," he said, circling the blimp.


The Rise and Fall of MIRV
MIRV.
Probably no word better encapsulates the technology and the terror of the Nuclear Age.
The acronym comes from
multiple, independently targetable, re-entry vehicle,
opaque Latinate language referring to multiple warheads on missiles developed in the late 1960's.
As they near their destination, they fragment into a burst of separate nuclear bombs, each headed for a different target.
Now, suddenly, the end of that destabilizing peril has come into view.
President Bush is now reportedly on the verge of sharply reducing multiple-warhead missiles in the U.S. arsenal, an act that would encourage the Soviet Union's successor states to contain their loose nukes.
There are few steps that could more effectively reduce the nuclear threat.


SWEEPING U.S. LAW TO HELP DISABLED GOES INTO EFFECT
The first major phase of what has been called the most sweeping anti-discrimination law since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 began yesterday, requiring businesses to give equal access to millions of disabled Americans.
The public accommodations provisions of the law, the Americans with Disabilities Act, mean more than merely providing adequate parking spaces or ramps for the handicapped.

Fast Data-Storage Systems Are EMC's Big Opportunity  BYL&gt;By JOHN MARKOFF
For more than a year the computer industry has been eagerly anticipating a ground-breaking new product code-named Iceberg from Storage Technology Inc., the disk-drive maker.
The new system will chain together dozens of small disk drives like a team of huskies pulling a sled, to give them greater speed and more reliability in storing data.
But it is not due out until the second half of this year.
Storage Technology will formally announce the system on Jan. 28.


In New York, State Prisoners Work or Else
New York State's prison system has quietly imposed one of the nation's toughest mandatory work policies, locking inmates who refuse work in their cells for 23 hours a day and then blackballing them when they come up for parole.
The new work policy was put in place over the last year when 1,071 inmates were locked in their cells until they agreed to work and another 267 had their privileges restricted, state correction officials said.

Review/Rock; Slow to Fast and Back
The Meat Puppets basically have two kinds of songs: ones that start out slow, then turn really fast, then slow again, and ones that start out fast, turn slow, and then fast again.
At the Knitting Factory on Friday night, this Arizona trio played both kinds, rotating them one after another in a set that had the pacing of an amusement park ride.
After a while, you wanted to be let off.
At first, the Meat Puppets were pleasurable enough.
Its guitarist and singer Curt Kirkwood has a sweet voice rife with twangy innocence, and his lyrics are often daffy little nonsense rhymes that offer grains of truth.
"In those days there was zero waste, now the waste of time is life," he sings in "This Day," from the band's eighth and most recent album "Forbidden Places" (London).
His accomplished guitar style flickers back and forth between heavy metal riffing and high-velocity country picking.
When the Puppets hit top speed, Mr.
Kirkwood's playing was almost surreal, like an entire hoedown chorus shoved into a single measure.


Show Will Miss A Top Shepherd
When the 2,500 showiest of this country's leading show dogs converge on Madison Square Garden two weeks from today for the Super Bowl of the canine world, the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club show, one of the odds-on favorites to capture the coveted best-in-show honors will be missing.
Ch.
Bramblewood's Custom Made, a 6-year-old German Shepherd owned by JANE FIRESTONE, died unexpectedly last Tuesday following emergency surgery to repair a stomach blockage.
The dog, whose off-duty name was Conan, accumulated 76 all-breed best-in-show victories and six specialty bests.
Conan not only was the nation's top German Shepherd, but one of the top 10 dogs over all.


FREE-FOR-ALL SEEN IN PHILIPPINE VOTE
The first presidential campaign in the Philippines since this nation rose up to topple the Marcos dictatorship in 1986 is developing into a free-for-all in which victory will depend more on traditional political deal-making than on debate over proposals to ease the plight of the country's tens of millions of poor.
The two candidates who top voter opinion surveys -- Senator Joseph Estrada, a grade B movie star who is sometimes described as the Ronald Reagan of the Philippines, and Miriam Defensor Santiago, a former immigration commissioner who is portraying herself as a dogged corruption fighter -- are being written off because they lack the backing of a large political machine.


Corrections
An article on Tuesday about a new natural gas pipeline serving the Northeast included erroneous data from the American Gas Association about the percentages of homes heated by gas.
The correct figures are 56 percent nationally, 36.3 percent in New York, 51 percent in New Jersey and 24.6 percent in Connecticut.


President's Message Expected to Lay Out Plans for a 'New Domestic Order'
In his State of the Union Message, President Bush is expected to challenge Congress to action on the economy without criticizing or directly confronting the Democrats, as well as to seek to define a "new domestic order" to go with his "new world order," Administration officials said today.
As Mr.
Bush worked today on a draft of the address, which he will deliver on Tuesday, the officials and Republican strategists said the White House was still debating philosophy and tactics.


Once Again, Redskins' Victory No Fluke for N.F.C.
Coach Dan Reeves, whose Denver Broncos were trounced by the Redskins in the Super Bowl four years ago, was able to appreciate what Washington did yesterday.
"I've been in this league since I joined Dallas in 1965," Reeves said, "and it'll never change: The team that can run the ball, and plays defense, wins."


Grapefruit Month in Congress
Forget the economy, health care and other weighty issues.
Representatives Andy Ireland and Tom Lewis of Florida are busily buttonholing colleagues to have February declared "National Grapefruit Month." That might please the state's citrus growers, but why does Congress waste its time on empty commemorations?
A new compilation in the Congressional Record shows that nearly one-third of the new laws passed by Congress last year named a day, week, month or decade to celebrate.
Whether the cause is National Mushroom Month or National Country Music Month, each bill requires lining up the co-sponsorship and signatures of a majority of members of both chambers.
That eats up a hefty portion of staff time.
And for what?
A clutter of forgettable occasions, many pandering to special interests.


Sikhs Kill Punjab Candidate
Sikh militants demanding a boycott of elections next month in Punjab State shot a candidate to death today, the police said.
Investigators said Harpal Singh, who would have been the nominee of the Communist Party of India, was killed by two gunmen near the town of Bhatinda in the southern Punjab.


Kazakhs Seek a Level Capitalist Road
Quietly, while the other republics of the fallen Soviet empire are raging with the politics of recrimination, this critical new nation linking Russia and the newly independent Asian states is employing a different drummer in its attempted march to the free market.
He is Dr.
Chan Young Bang, a 55-year-old American economist from the University of San Francisco, who has already achieved notable progress in the privatization of 40 percent of this capital's housing stock while the parliaments of other republics are still mostly agonizing over the alien notion of private ownership.


Communities, Rich and Poor, Scramble to Cope With Albany's School Aid Cuts
At the Bayview Avenue Elementary School, where the red welcome mat says "All Children Can Read," students in the second grade did not get a language arts workbook this year -- at more than $9 a copy they were simply too expensive in this age of budget cutting -- and there were not enough social studies textbooks to go around either.
So the news that Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo has proposed yet another cut in state aid to education has provoked outbursts of rage and fear among parents and teachers at the yellow-brick Bayview Avenue school and at other suburban schools hit hardest by the cuts.


When Charge Is Murder, Men Fare Worse
To the Editor:
The title "A Double Standard for Murder?" (Op-Ed, Jan. 8) is appropriate for the very opposite of what Phyllis Chesler describes.
Serial killers are rare and cannot serve as a basis for generalizations about differential treatment given men and women by the criminal justice system.
Killings between intimates, however, are common.
As a forensic psychiatrist, I have evaluated hundreds of such tragedies over the last 30 years.
Scientific literature, including my own research, has established that women are represented in that category of homicide as often as men.
In these cases it is common for men to be convicted of murder; women usually are charged with manslaughter.
Many women who have killed a husband or lover who was asleep were acquitted on grounds of self-defense.


Clients Demand Flexibility For Their Media Purchases
NOT too many years ago, anyone who suggested that an advertiser would be able to buy a commercial during a Super Bowl as late as two days before the game would have been dismissed as someone who played too much football without a helmet.
Yet for Super Bowl XXVI, which CBS broadcast yesterday, no one was surprised that it took the network until Friday to sell the last of the 56 available 30-second spots.
The difference between then and now is a fundamental change in the ability of advertisers to plan ahead.
As a result of two years of economic uncertainties, no company wants to make commitments as extravagant as a Super Bowl buy -- at $800,000 to $850,000 for each commercial -- as far as several months in advance.
Across a broad range of product categories, like beer, cars, soft drinks, air travel and credit cards, rapidly changing market conditions make flexibility far more highly prized than having an annual media plan locked in by Jan. 1.


Wako Journal; History Scholar in Japan Exposes a Brutal Chapter
When Japan's television networks recently began broadcasting the accounts of Korean women and girls who were kidnapped and forced to serve in battlefront brothels for the Imperial Army, even Japanese who prefer never to think about World War II said they felt shamed by the years of agony the women endured.
But the Japanese Government had the same ready answer it has had for decades: A few words of sympathy for the tens of thousands of victims whose lives were shattered, and a curt dismissal of their demands for Government compensation.
The brothels, Japan's Foreign Ministry said, were run by private entrepreneurs, not the Government.
No one in the Foreign Ministry, though, was ready for Yoshiaki Yoshimi.

Compaq Set To Introduce 2 Computers
The Compaq Computer Corporation on Monday will introduce the first computers of its Eckhard Pfeiffer era -- two notebook models with several new features and retail prices ranging from $2,900 to $4,600.
After Mr.
Pfeiffer took over as chief executive on Oct. 24, he vowed that Compaq would price its machines closer to the thriving clone makers like the Dell Computer Corporation of Austin, Tex.
And the two notebook models appear to blend Compaq's emphasis on new technology with a lower price.
Dell and other rivals gained ground on Compaq last year and forced the company into abrupt and sweeping changes.

She said she believed that a Democrat would not be elected President until the year 2000.

His crafty stick-handling, sudden twists and turns, remarkable balance and quick acceleration have brought gasps from fans and teammates alike.

She graduated cum laude from Syracuse University.
Her father is a lawyer in Brooklyn.
Her mother, Barbara Cantor, is an artist.


Can Trial Of Tyson Be Fair?
The question of whether the former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson can get a fair hearing in the trial that starts here Monday has become a hot speculative issue.
Already, T-shirts, at $12.50 apiece, are being sold that show a blindfolded Tyson holding a scale of justice in both hands with the words "Can Mike Tyson Get a Fair Trial?" underscoring an apparently growing belief among locals that maybe he can't.


Dinkins Plan Would Alter Taxi Industry
The Dinkins administration will propose a fundamental reorganization of New York City's taxi industry, including the elimination of the free market in taxi medallions, the creation of two new medallions for livery cabs and a sixfold increase in enforcement against unlicensed cabs.
The plan, to be released publicly this week, is intended to improve the quality of cab service, particularly in parts of the city outside the central Manhattan business districts.
Details of the proposal were disclosed this weekend by several people involved in drafting it.


New Jewish Magazine Seeks Charity's Help
A new Jewish magazine hopes to get off to a running -- and inexpensive -- start by turning some of the nation's top charitable donors into instant subscribers.
But the plan has drawn complaints of favoritism from competitors and raised concerns about the magazine's editorial independence.

Courier Defeats Edberg To Close In on No. 1
It was Australia Day, a celebration of the nation's birth, but it was an all-American celebration at the Australian Open after Jim Courier won the year's first Grand Slam tournament and stood poised to become the first United States man since John McEnroe in 1985 to be ranked No. 1 in the world.
Courier, currently ranked second, scored a decisive 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Stefan Edberg to leave him trailing the world's No. 1 player by only 20 points on the Association of Tennis Professionals computer.

CHRONICLE
They may constitute a rarefied sample, but users of the Encyclopaedia Britannica's Instant Research Service were more interested in Edgar Allan Poe last year than they were in Jesus, Picasso or Al Capone.
One of the more surprising findings in a ranking of the people who generated the most requests for information from the research service was that Poe ranked fifth in the top 20 individuals.
The service provides information on any 100 topics requested over a 10-year period to purchasers of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
Last year it received more than 162,000 inquiries.
One-fifth of those were sampled for the ranking, said MARGARET MOTTIER, director of the service.


Firms Relatively Quiet on Treasury Proposals
After decades of doing business pretty much on their own, executives and traders at firms that buy and sell Treasury securities seem to have relatively few quarrels with the sweeping market changes proposed last week by the Government.
In part, the subdued reaction stems from a realization that further changes, beyond those announced in the immediate aftermath of the Salomon Brothers bidding scandal, were bound to come.
But many traders say there is also widespread recognition that many of the proposed changes are sound ones.

In arguing it is a maintenance nightmare, attracting the homeless and drug abusers, Commissioner of Parks and Recreation Betsy F. Gotbaum makes as much sense as if proposing to tear down Grand Central Terminal or the New York Public Library, where derelicts abound.

He was a resident of Miami.

Foreign Affairs; Journalistic Cannibals
Journalistic cannibalism is just grand.
Nothing like opening up the garbage pails of politicians' private lives to get the democratic juices running.
The people want a full whiff.
They need to know all.
Perhaps the public's right and need to know should even include investigations of journalists at play to see who among them is chaste and virtuous.
Bill and Hillary Clinton decided they had to expose themselves to such a trial last night.
On the distinguished CBS News program "60 Minutes," they repeated that their marriage had been troubled and reaffirmed that they have worked things out.
That tells us everything we need to know.
More than we need to know.


Powell to Receive Jesse Owens Award at Waldorf
MIKE POWELL, the American long jumper who broke BOB BEAMON's 23-year-old world record at the track and field world championships in Tokyo last August, will receive this year's Jesse Owens International Trophy Award at a dinner Feb. 4 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan.
When Powell steps to the podium, a trio of special peers of the past will best comprehend what is behind the award.
Beamon, RALPH BOSTON and IGOR TER-OVANESYAN are expected to be present.
They, and Powell, are the only ones to have held the world long-jump mark since the late JESSE OWENS set a world record in 1935.


Going Up the Downhill Slope
It was his first World Cup victory of the season, the first after the worst start of his career, a start that prompted many experts to conclude that Marc Girardelli had used up the last of his 99 lives and was on his way to being a former champion.
But there he was, just two hours after winning the supergiant slalom in Val d'Isere, France, on Dec. 8, running slalom gates beneath the watchful eye of Helmut, his ever-present father.


Pedestrian Killed by Train
A man was struck and killed by a shore-bound New Jersey Transit train tonight, a transit official said.

The man was killed instantly when the train hit him at 5:50 P.M. on the North Jersey Coast Line tracks near Fulton Street, just west of the Woodbridge station, said Rosemary Sheridan, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit.
The name of the victim was not immediately available, and it was unclear whether he was crossing or walking along the tracks when he was hit.

Hammer-and-Sickle Falls Out of Fashion in Brazil
Drawing back from a 70-year effort to bring Marx to Brazil's masses, the Brazilian Communist Party has voted to drop the hammer and sickle as its symbol and to change its name to the Popular Socialist Party.
The party, which is stressing democracy and socialism, abandoned its name Sunday night in a raucous congress marked by egg-throwing and name-calling.
Last fall, as a struggle over the party's future deepened, reform leaders took out a 10-year patent on the party's old name to prevent others from using it, and orthodox members retaliated by breaking into party offices and carrying to safety portraits of Marx, Engels and Lenin.

Supreme Court Roundup; Limits Placed on Union Organizers on Employers' Property
The Supreme Court today sharply limited the ability of labor union organizers to go onto an employer's property to distribute literature or urge workers to join the union.

Q&amp;A
Giraffe Hypertension
Q.
Is the blood pressure of a giraffe extremely high to get blood to the head?
Do giraffes get hardening of the arteries and strokes?
A.
In an adult giraffe, the systolic blood pressure, the pressure when the heart contracts to pump blood through the body, is about 200 millimeters of mercury at the level of the heart, about twice that of an adult human being, said Dr.
Paul E. Calle, a veterinarian at the Animal Health Center of the New York Zoological Society.
The center cares for the animals of the Bronx Zoo, the Central Park Zoo and the New York Aquarium at Coney Island.
During exercise, the blood pressure at the level of the giraffe's feet might be double what it is at heart level because of gravity, Dr.
Calle said.
At the head, it is comparable to the blood pressure of a human being.
"Stroke and hardening of the arteries can occur in most mammal species," Dr.
Calle said, "but is not a notable problem with giraffes."
The giraffe's circulatory system has evolved with special adaptations for both high and low pressure, he said.
For example, because the blood pressure in the lower part of the body is so high, the artery walls in the legs are very thick, much thicker than in the neck, to prevent edema, or leakage of fluid out of the vessels, Dr.
Calle said.
The skin and tissue under the skin on the limbs are also very tight to prevent leaks.
In the large veins of the neck, there are valves to restrict the flow of blood so that it does not flow backward and pool in the head when the giraffe puts its head down to drink or eat, Dr.
Calle said.

The goal itself is in jeopardy because the disease has to be controlled before it can be eliminated.

An Australian Novelist With a Full-Tilt Pace And Ferocious Humor
Peter Carey is proof that a bad party can make a good novel.
A few years ago, the Australian writer found himself at a tony social gathering in Sydney, when the subject turned to Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, the archconservative premier of Queensland, who had decided to run for Prime Minister on a tax-cutting policy.
"Everyone agreed how wonderful it would be to have this moron running the country," recalled Mr.
Carey, interviewed recently at his home in lower Manhattan.
"There was no sympathy, no understanding that the wealthy might have an obligation. I left that party angrier than I thought myself capable of being. And I decided it would be a good idea to write a novel with a tax inspector as the hero."


A 'Lab Mouse' of Coral May Be Several Species
A COMMONLY studied species of coral, the "lab mouse" of marine biology, has been found to be three species rather than one, according to a new study.
The finding, reported in the Jan. 17 issue of the journal Science, may compel scientists to review their previous research involving star coral.
The lead investigator, Dr.
Nancy Knowlton, a staff scientist of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, said past research commonly attributed differences in the coral to environmental factors.
But the discrepancies might have actually been based on genetics if the researchers were unknowingly comparing different species, she said.


Making Painful Choices on Deformed Fetuses; For Honest Debate

Five Jurors Chosen as Tyson Trial Begins
In the left corner of Courtroom 4 today, Mike Tyson, former heavyweight champion of the world, watched as two teams of lawyers began the tedious process of choosing the 12 Marion County citizens who will determine his fate.
By the end of the day, the first of what is expected to be at least a two-week trial on rape and related charges, five jurors had been selected.
Potential jurors were questioned about whether they would hold a celebrity to a higher standard of conduct than someone else and whether they believed a woman had the right to say no, and even about their feelings on the recent William Kennedy Smith trial.

Edward S. Finkelstein tried everything to avoid bankruptcy -- catchy advertising, sales, cajoling suppliers, tapping his circle of wealthy friends to stump up more cash.
But in the end, there was nothing the 66-year-old chairman of R. H. Macy &amp; Company, who was once hailed as a marketing miracle worker, could do to keep his debt-laden empire afloat.
A man known as brilliant, thin-skinned and at home with hyperbole, Mr.
Finkelstein (the last syllable is pronounced STEEN) repeatedly made optimistic predictions for Macy -- and repeatedly fell short of those goals.
"Finkelstein really believed his own rhetoric," said one investment banker familiar with the company.

These Tax Cuts Stunt Growth
To judge by advance leaks to reporters, the "growth" tax cuts that President Bush will announce in his State of the Union address tonight and his budget tomorrow will promote precious little growth.
Taken individually, they range from inconsequential to destructive.
Taken together, they would put billions into undeserving pockets -- and wreck the tax code.
Economic recovery cannot be bought with a mishmash of political handouts.
What the economy does need is a swift kick, most easily delivered by a temporary tax cut that doesn't drain away revenues once the economy recovers.
For the long term, the economy needs a tax code that favors saving over consumption.
Perhaps there's more to the Bush plan than has been leaked, but otherwise, it won't do much to hasten recovery or reform.


Profits Fall For ARCO And Phillips
ARCO and the Phillips Petroleum Company reported sharply lower earnings today for the fourth quarter, steeper declines than oil companies with broader international operations like Exxon, Mobil and Texaco have reported.
The Unocal Corporation, which like ARCO and Phillips Petroleum operates primarily in the United States, reported a small loss for the quarter.


In the Retail Desert, Fortunoff Is Planting a Mall on L.I.
Macy's, 47th Street Photo and other big-name retailers are in various stages of bankruptcy, but Alan Fortunoff is undaunted.
He is putting his family's housewares and jewelry business on the line with plans to build a $194 million shopping center here.
Standing in the middle of 69 acres of barren blacktop in the heart of Nassau County, Mr.
Fortunoff envisioned a mall that will employ more than 3,000 people and, by his estimate, pump $352 million annually into the depressed local economy.


On My Mind; The Clinton Couple
The Clinton couple of Arkansas have presented to the American public a gift and a testing opportunity.

Skinner Chavez-Melo, Church Musician, 47
Skinner Chavez-Melo, an organist, conductor and composer who was music director at the St.
Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, died on Saturday at New York Downtown Hospital.
He was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.
He died of spinal cancer, said his brother, Juan Francisco.


Quotation of the Day
"We worked day and night to find a suitable solution and ultimately came to the conclusion that filing for Chapter 11 was best for Macy's future. I am convinced that beginning this rehabilitative process is the best way to protect our valuable franchise." -- EDWARD S. FINKELSTEIN, chairman of Macy's.  [ A1:6. ]


Killing Casts a Rare Light On Gay Life in Suburbia
Nobody at Pal Joey's wanted to talk much about Henry Marquez, the dark-haired Texas dreamer who loved old cars, country music and Hamptons beaches.
At the gay bar, where one would expect outrage at a gay-bashing episode that the police said led to Mr.
Marquez's death, the silence instead ran cold, immutable and deep.
The attack on Mr.
Marquez at a parking lot near Pal Joey's last month has thrown an unwelcome spotlight on gay life in the suburbs, a shadowy world between the pride, bravado and activism of Christopher Street in Manhattan and the exuberant summer retreats on Fire Island and the Hamptons.


How to Use Debt to Save Russian Forests
To the Editor:
The United States has agreed to support Russia's inclusion in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank (front page, Jan. 4), to suspend Russia's debt payments until 1993 and to provide millions of dollars in direct aid.
For little or no additional cost, the United States and the international community can use debt restructuring and foreign aid to help protect Russian forests, vital to offset the greenhouse effect and maintain the world's air quality.


Review/Fashion; In Paris, Diverse Dreams
Three Italian designers kicked off the French haute couture openings for spring and summer over the weekend, enhancing the cosmopolitan quality of this city.
A fourth, Gianfranco Ferre, led the house of Christian Dior into the fashion fray this afternoon.
Nearly half of the accredited couture designers scheduled to show their collections this week have already done so.
So far, even with the help of the Italians, none seem to have had any significant impact on fashion.
The raison d'etre of the couture is to be the laboratory of new ideas.
Until now, each couturier has been pursuing his own dream.


Review/City Ballet; Balanchine Meets Mozart in 'Divertimento No. 15'
George Balanchine meets Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in "Divertimento No. 15," and the audience comes away knowing each a good deal better.
The ballet, presented by the New York City Ballet in a richly satisfying performance on Saturday afternoon, is essentially about the good manners and vital graciousness of the world of Mozart's music.
It is also a prime example of the sensitivity to music that shaped much of Balanchine's choreography.
And almost everyone in the cast gets a chance to shine.
Some of the best dancing came from Robert Lyon and Erlends Zieminch, each seen here in a role debut as the male demi-soloists.
One pleasure of the City Ballet season has been watching finished classical dancing travel through Mr.
Lyon's long body down through his tapering hands and feet.
Mr.
Zieminch proved himself here to be the kind of partner who looks, deceptively, as if all his passion and exaltation flows from his proximity to his ballerina.
He danced with an impressive buoyancy and a quality of attention to style that softened occasional distracting moments of loose light-weightedness.


Montreal Journal; Have the Quebecers Gone Soft? (Just Ask Miami)
From the earliest days of French settlement in the 17th century, Quebec has taken a stubborn pride in its winters.
Even Voltaire, dismissing Quebec as "a few acres of snow" after France lost the territory to British conquest in 1759, inadvertently contributed to the legend Quebecers have built of themselves as a people who have thrived in the face of bitter chills and blizzards.
But if the Quebecer of yore was a climate-hardened backwoodsman, his descendants have changed.

CHRONICLE
Two years ago, a team of Olympic and collegiate women basketball players beat a team of Congressmen by 28 points; last year, the women beat the legislators by seven points.
So it is with a certain degree of optimism that 10 Congressmen face the game they are to play next Wednesday in Washington to kick off the 1992 National Girls and Women in Sports Day sponsored by the Women's Sports Foundation.
This year the celebration, which will also include a Congressional reception on Feb. 6, will mark the 20th anniversary of Title IX of the 1972 amendments to the Education Law.
Title IX, considered a milestone in the fight for women's equality, mandated that schools and colleges receiving Federal funds provide resources for women's sports equal to those available to men.

Sports of The Times; Of Geniuses, Snowshoes And Football
THE question came up in a news conference earlier in the football week about winning The Big One.
In sporting terms, that means, as Humpty Dumpty said, exactly what the speaker chooses it to mean -- neither more nor less.
In sports, though, The Big One has come to symbolize the championship, like, in recent days in Minnesota, the Ice Fishing Tournament at Forest Lake, or the Snowshoe Marathon in Duluth, or the Super Bowl in Minneapolis.


Commercials Offer a Fairly Ho-hum Bowl
Super Bowl XXVI may have turned out super for the Washington Redskins, but as for the commercials, it was a Satisfactory Bowl, maybe merely an Adequate Bowl, at best.
Compared with some Super Sundays of yore, the audacious, attention-at-any-cost creativity seemed noticeably absent from the 27 or so minutes of extravagantly expensive spots that cost a record $850,000 for each 30 seconds.

Advocates of Disabled File Complaint About the Empire State Building
Using a wheelchair because of multiple sclerosis, Daniel Robert has never been able to visit the top of the Empire State Building since it meant climbing two flights of steps from the 86th floor.
Yesterday, Mr.
Robert and other advocates of disability rights took the owners of the famous skyscraper to court.
Invoking a powerful new Federal law called the Americans With Disabilities Act, which went into effect on Sunday, the group filed a complaint with the Department of Justice and urged the Government to demand that the owners remove barriers to people in wheelchairs.

Water-Meter Service Files for Bankruptcy
The Vanguard Meter Service Inc., which dominated New York City's water-meter installation program until it was charged with fraud, filed for bankruptcy reorganization last week, citing $21 million in liabilities against $17 million in assets.
Vanguard, once the nation's biggest water-meter installer, is still in business and will try to come up with a plan to repay its 150 creditors, said a lawyer for the company, Abraham Backenroth.


Land and Health Also Erode in Haiti
The fields are still green here, but they do not mask the ominous signs that the international economic embargo intended to force a return to democratic rule in Haiti is accelerating land and environmental damage, and threatening already precarious food supplies for the hemisphere's poorest people.
Trade sanctions imposed by the Organization of American States have blocked fuel, fertilizer and pesticides to the rice farmers of the Artibonite Valley.
The sanctions were voted early in October in an effort to reverse the Sept. 30 coup in which the elected civilian President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was overthrown.


Haitians Fleeing Again to U.S. Asylum
After a lull of several weeks, hundreds of Haitians have begun fleeing over the last seven days, the Coast Guard said today.
More than 1,100 were pulled from the sea today, a record daily number.
When the sun set tonight, "an unknown number of boats were still on the horizon," a Coast Guard spokesman, Petty Officer Roger Wetherell, said in Miami.
He said that 10 cutters working around-the-clock were overloaded, and that there were fears there will not be enough places at the United States Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to house the refugees.


State of Union On TV Tonight
The State of the Union Message and the Democratic response will be broadcast live on the three major networks and on PBS, CNN and C-Span tonight at 9 o'clock.
CBS News will broadcast a special program immediately after the Democratic response in which as many as 300,000 viewers can call an "800" telephone number and voice their opinions about the state of the country.


Brazil Loan Is Expected
The International Monetary Fund is expected to approve a $2 billion loan for Brazil on Wednesaday and to support President Fernando Collor de Mello's economic program, Government officials and diplomats said.
The loan, which Brazil requested in December, is a vital step toward restoring the country's international financial credibility.


Record Year For Merrill As Net Jumps
As if anyone needed yet another sign of how well Wall Street has been doing, Merrill Lynch &amp; Company yesterday reported quarterly earnings of $170.1 million, raising its yearly profits to a record $696.1 million.
Merrill, Wall Street's biggest brokerage firm, credited its success to controlling costs even as the stock market surged and underwritings of new stock and bond issues multiplied.


Critic's Notebook; The Super Bowl on TV: Too Much Pumping Up?
Over the years, the phenomenon has become unsettlingly familiar: Super Bowl turns out to be Super Bloat.
That certainly was the case on Sunday.
After weeks of publicity hype, the game fizzled to the point where television cameras in the second half were panning to fans in the stands who were either yawning or nodding off.
In hindsight, an omen was offered early on by Harry Connick Jr., whose version of the national anthem was laconically determined to prove that anything you can do he can do slower.
Viewers needing a quicker picker-upper could have turned at half-time to Fox Broadcasting, which, in a characteristically frisky counter-programming ploy, was offering a special live-from-Hollywood edition of "In Living Color," all of the skits and routines with weekly regulars taking pokes at the wide, wide world of football.
Serving as host, Tommy Davidson assured the audience for the "Half-Time Countdown Party" that a special countdown clock would let them know when the second half of the game was starting so they could get right back to CBS and not miss any of the crunching brutality.


Five Jurors Chosen as Tyson Trial Begins
In the left corner of Courtroom 4 today, Mike Tyson, former heavyweight champion of the world, watched as two teams of lawyers began the tedious process of choosing the 12 Marion County citizens who will determine his fate.
By the end of the day, the first of what is expected to be at least a two-week trial on rape and related charges, five jurors had been selected.
Potential jurors were questioned about whether they would hold a celebrity to a higher standard of conduct than someone else and whether they believed a woman had the right to say no, and even about their feelings on the recent William Kennedy Smith trial.

Thomas J. Mackell Is Dead at 77; Former Queens District Attorney
Thomas J. Mackell, who resigned as the Queens District Attorney in 1973 after he was indicted on charges of hindering prosecution in a $4.4 million get-rich-quick scheme, died yesterday at his son's home in Douglaston Manor, Queens.
He was 77 years old and lived in Douglaston Manor.
He died of stomach cancer, his son Terrence said.


Store Manager Was Shot
The New York City medical examiner has determined that the assistant manager of The Gap Kids store in midtown Manhattan died of a gunshot wound to the head as well as multiple stab wounds to the neck.
The 22-year-old victim, Lisa Steinberg, was found bound and gagged Saturday morning in the store at 250 West 57th Street where it was apparent she had been stabbed numerous times with a screwdriver.
But an autopsy on Sunday revealed that she had also been shot once in the head, Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner, said yesterday.


Review/Music; Image of Death Opens Schubertiade Festival
In Hermann Prey's haunting performance of the most famous of Schubert's lieder, "Erlkonig," at the 92d Street Y on Saturday night, accompanied by the pianist Leonard Hokanson, there seemed no separation of the singer from the song.
By carefully shaping his now considerably darkened baritone, Mr.
Prey seemed to change vocal masks from verse to verse.
One moment his singing was a sort of heightened speech in the lowest register, the father assuring the feverish child that his visions of the devilish Erlking are just streaks of mist in the night.
The next moment Mr.
Prey was singing in mock innocence, insinuating, coaxing, seeming to be the voice of the Erlking himself, tempting the child with visions of dance and song and flowers.
Finally, Mr.
Prey was the sick child borne on horseback, crying out in urgency that his father attend to what he sees, that these are not visions of willows gleaming in the night, that the Erlking was about to seize him.
When the Erlking's seductive lines turn demonic, Mr.
Prey's face twisted with the threat.
And when the father, after shuddering at the child's cries, looked down at the child in his arms, the pause before the last words was chilling: Mr.
Prey seemed to be staring into the face of death.
It was an extraordinary enactment.


Two Promotions At Leo Burnett
In a move to consolidate the chain of command at its American and international units, the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago has named two executives to oversee all client-service and business operations.
William T. Lynch, 49 years old, who had been chairman and chief executive of Leo Burnett U.S.A., has been promoted to president and chief client service officer of Burnett and of its international unit, Leo Burnett Worldwide.


Analog Devices In Hewlett Tie
The Hewlett-Packard Company and Analog Devices Inc. said today that they had formed an alliance to jointly develop mixed-signal semiconductors.
Such chips combine digital and analog processing on a single chip, and are increasingly used in automobiles, telecommunications and consumer electronic equipment.
"An alliance with a technology leader like H.P. affords us a unique opportunity to accelerate the development of advanced mixed-signal processes beyond what we could afford to do on our own," Ray Stata, Analog's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.


Security Chief At City College Is Reassigned
The security director of the City College of New York was relieved of his duties yesterday for his role at a celebrity basketball game last month at which nine people were killed in a deadly crush, City University officials said.
The action against the director, Charles Delaney, was made known last night at a session of the university's board of trustees, where the college's president, Dr.
Bernard W. Harleston, also unveiled new procedures for the use of college buildings for student events, CUNY officials said.

Books of The Times; A Telephone Novel Based on an Adult Party Line
Vox By Nicholson Baker 165 pages. Random House. $15.


Around the World With Balloon And Gizmos
FOR more than two centuries aeronauts have dreamed of circumnavigating the world in a balloon, the last great aeronautical challenge remaining to be conquered.
All the adventurers who previously attempted the daunting 22,000-mile voyage have failed, but this week an American balloon ace, a seasoned aeronautical mechanic and a senior Russian astronaut are completing preparations for the launching of Earthwinds, the most complex and advanced balloon ever built.
If all goes well in the next few days here, the huge craft, carrying American and Russian scientific experiments as well as the three crew members, will ascend on Thursday or Friday from its berth at the Loral Defense Systems Air Dock, a gigantic hangar built in 1929 to accommodate the largest dirigibles ever built in America, the ill-fated Akron and Macon.
The Earthwinds balloon is supposed to rise slowly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet, slip into the eastward-flowing jet stream, and complete its trip around the world in something under two weeks.

In May, Sir Michael reaches the company's mandatory retirement age of 62.


Cheap Insurance for Hard Disks
A HARD disk drive is never more than one second away from disaster.
A power fluctuation, a computer virus, a faulty circuit, a corrupted file, a hard knock on the desk, a burglar, an infestation of gremlins; any one of them can render your hard disk as useless as a stone, sending data into oblivion.
Luckily, you have a current backup. You DO have a backup, don't you?


Business Scene; Moonlighting In Moscow
A CARDIOLOGIST sees private patients to supplement his salary from a full-time hospital job, which pays him only 2,000 rubles a month, or $10.
An office worker, who could afford to buy a small car two years ago, now cruises the streets in it, picking up taxi fares -- a growing freelance activity.
And a woman sells plastic bags for 3 rubles apiece to shoppers leaving a high-priced farmer's market with fresh food in their arms.
She had purchased the bags for less than half that price by standing in line at a state store.
Everywhere in the commonwealth, people are hustling for extra income to survive.
"Poverty is the normal state of living in our country today," said Lev Timoteyev, an economist and writer.
But "poverty" has a different, broader meaning here than in the United States.
The word in America suggests slum-living, joblessness, school dropouts and a high crime rate.
Here, poverty is a result of prices that have tripled or more for everyone, while wages have only doubled at best.
It is as if an American family earning $40,000 suddenly had that reduced to $30,000 -- or maybe $25,000.

Instanter Journal; What Water Hid, Drought Reveals

Mr.

Corrections
A brief article on Thursday about protests surrounding the French abortion pill RU-486, and a correction in this space on Friday, referred incorrectly to the target of the protests, the Hoechst Celanese Corporation.

The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had filed for $750 million of a new class C preference stock to be sold here and abroad to help strengthen its balance sheet.
The portion to be sold in the United States will be handled by a group headed by Merrill Lynch &amp; Company and involves 12 million depository shares to be offered at $50 a share.
The international part of the offering will be three million shares offered through a group headed by Merrill Lynch International Ltd., at a similar price.


U.N. Team in Baghdad Jostled as Police Watch
Three members of a United Nations Inspection team in Iraq were confronted by 40 demonstrators in the lobby of the Sheraton Hotel Baghdad today as Iraqi policemen stood by and did not intervene, United Nations officials said.

In Retreat, Supreme Court Limits Scope of '65 Voting Rights Act
In an important ruling on the Federal Voting Rights Act, the Supreme Court today adopted a narrow view of the 1965 law and rejected arguments the Bush Administration had put forward on behalf of black elected officials in two Alabama counties.
The blacks won election to previously all-white county boards, only to find that some budgetary authority over roads that individual commissioners had historically exercised had been stripped from the offices.
The reorganizations were supported by the white incumbents.

Future Ads Expected to Project 'Business as Usual' Image
The decision yesterday by R. H. Macy &amp; Company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection is not expected to alter its marketing efforts significantly, advertising executives said.
But they said they anticipated a tightrope-walking act, in which executives at Macy and its agency must balance the retail chain's short- and long-term needs.
It is not clear whether the bankruptcy filing will affect how much advertising Macy buys.


Worst-Case Scenario: Bills Lose 3 in a Row
All the Buffalo Bills' worst fears turned into reality in Super Bowl XXVI.
The Washington Redskins' 37-24 thumping on Sunday was so complete and so embarrassing for the Bills that they left here with what was for them the worst possible scenario: being compared to the Denver Broncos and the Minnesota Vikings as teams that can be counted on to turn Super Bowls into Super Flops.
That's two straight losses now for Buffalo in the big show, matching Denver and Minnesota as the only teams to suffer such misery.


Chess
The apprentices of the sorcerer, Gary Kasparov, have treated him with less respect in the last 12 months than in the previous nine years, when he won every competition he participated in.
In Linares, Spain, in February, the world champion had to take second place behind the Ukrainian grandmaster Vasily Ivanchuk.
In Amsterdam in May, he tied for third place behind the winners, the grandmasters Valery Salov of Russia and Nigel Short of Britain.
And now, in the Reggio Emilia International Tournament, which ended Jan. 6 in northern Italy, he shared second place with the Russian grandmaster Boris Gelfand behind the 23-year-old Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand.
This was a special plum for Anand because the tournament had been billed by its sponsors, Banco San Geminiano e San Prospero, CartaSi and Ferrarini S.p.A., as the strongest in history, reaching Category 18, the highest on the scale of the International Chess Federation.


A.N.C. Leader Sees a Threat From Rightists

Victorious Knicks Get to Travel Home in First
The Knicks have had their troubles on the road this season, but not this trip.
They have soared and slumped at various times, but suddenly appear unstoppable.
New York earned a significant road victory tonight, routing the Jazz, 97-80, and ending Utah's 17-game winning streak at the Delta Center.
The Knicks also moved back into sole possession of first place in the Atlantic Division, one-half game ahead of idle Boston.


Yankees Are Looking At Alan Anderson
The Yankees have apparently decided that the quickest way to solve their pitching woes is by adding free agents because they expressed interest in Alan Anderson last week after having already made an initial contract offer to Eric King.
Craig Fenech, Anderson's agent, said he spoke with General Manager Gene Michael late last week and would likely call him again today or tomorrow.
The agent said five clubs are talking to him about Anderson, a left-hander who was 5-11 for Minnesota last season but who led the American League in earned run average in 1988.


Treasuries Steady in a Light Day
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in slow trading yesterday, as credit market participants marked time before a number of important events are played out over the next week to 10 days.

This Time, Connecticut's Defense Is Much Too Tough for Villanova
Chris Smith, Connecticut's leading scorer and all-round main man this season, failed to score a field goal tonight, going 0 for 8 from the floor.
It made little difference.
Maybe the lights were too bright at the glitzy Gampel Pavilion because there were plenty of other misses, too.
Or, as the coaches said, the defensive play was too good.

"Hold it right there, fella. I categorically deny ever having had a relationship with a bimbo. What's more, even if I had, under no circumstances would I ever refer to any woman by a viciously sexist word like 'bimbo.'

By Design; Hayride in Paris
Paris is off on a hayride.
Left behind at the spring couture shows are the usual luxurious trimmings of satin ribbons and lace.
Instead, the braids, edgings, fringes and accessories are mostly of straw or raffia.
In the sensitive fingers of couture artisans, these materials have been transformed into gilded objects.
The prevailing whim is to dip the straw into gold paint.
Every designer seems to have at least one pair of gauntlets with straw cuffs.
And at Christian Lacroix's presentation, the big-brimmed farmer-style hats glistened with their lacquer finish.
Even the metal fastenings on his handbags were shaped like wrapped strands of straw.

St. John's Judge Allows Evidence
A New York State judge yesterday denied a defense motion to limit testimony in the trial of a 22-year-old former St.
John's University student accused of sodomy and other charges in a sexual attack on a former female student.
The judge, Justice Kenneth N. Browne of State Supreme Court in Queens, said yesterday that the prosecution could present evidence detailing what happened in a house near the university's campus in Jamaica, Queens, when the defendant, Michael Calandrillo, was not there.


Colombian Blood, U.S. Guns
On Dec. 16, 20 indigenous peasants, including five women and four children, were murdered as they met to discuss a struggle over land rights in the village of El Nilo in southern Colombia.
News reports indicated that the gunmen were drug traffickers who had been seizing land in the region to grow opium poppies to produce heroin.
The truth is much more complex.
In Colombia, drug-related violence continues because it is generally tolerated and often supported by the security forces.
For the most part, the U.S. news media have portrayed the drug terrorists as the only perpetrators of violent crime, ignoring the role of Colombian state agents, whose human rights abuses have been denounced by Amnesty International, Americas Watch and the Washington Office on Latin America.

Donations to Neediest Made in Memory of Others
"Please accept this contribution in memory of my niece, Heather Renee Orthmann, who was killed at the age of 25 in an automobile accident last summer," wrote Nan Orthmann Sharp of Bergenfield, N.J., in a note accompanying a $100 donation to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"Heather loved to help people! She had spent some summers teaching handicapped children to swim and was studying to be an interpreter for the deaf."
Each year people make contributions to the Neediest Cases as memorials to departed loved ones.
Most are tributes to the lessons of generosity and caring handed down by parents who have since died.
But many are remembrances of young people who were also able to leave powerful legacies during their short lives.

Gaseous Envelope
A British astronomer has found that the scattering of radio waves caused by turbulent interstellar electrically charged gases, or plasma, is present in areas of the galaxy where it had not been previously proven to exist.
The findings are considered evidence that the solar system is encapsulated in an envelope of these gases, probably the relic of the explosion of a nearby, massive star tens of millions of years ago.


Review/Theater; 'Crazy He Calls Me': Well Yes, He Does
At first "Crazy He Calls Me," a new two-character play by Abraham Tetenbaum at the Walter Kerr Theater, seems like just another boy-meets-girl, girl-helps-boy-masturbate romantic comedy.
The time is 1948, the place Brooklyn.
Benny (Barry Miller), a young lawyer who still lives with his mother and sister, has fallen for Yvette (Polly Draper), a Polish emigre, nee Yetta, who has a burning mission to raise money for a Hebrew home for the aged.
But no sooner has Benny stopped off for the first time at Yvette's apartment for a nightcap than the audience begins to suspect darker doings.
Not only does Yvette insist on helping her date achieve orgasm while he remains fully dressed in his pin-striped suit but she proudly displays an impressive collection of lipstick-stained napkins kept in a bureau drawer and yells at a possibly imaginary uncle through her parlor floor.


Slim Pickings and Hope at Lafayette High
Insurrection was brewing one recent afternoon in a first-floor corridor at Lafayette High on Benson Avenue on the edge of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn.
Three starting players from Coach Ira Levine's basketball team cornered Kevin Meyers, the assistant coach and academic tutor.
Present were Hardin Desire, Lafayette's best all-round player; Tony Rexha, a streaky long-range shooter, and Kareem Sims, a bruising forward.
On behalf of their teammates, for the sake of team pride, for the good of the school, it was time, once and for all, to take a stand.

G.M. to Close High-Tech Parts Factory
General Motors' "factory of the future" will become part of the auto maker's past in August, when it plans to close the Saginaw, Mich., plant.
The General Motors Corporation said the factory, called Saginaw Vanguard, had fulfilled its goals of developing high-tech solutions to productivity problems.
The project was started in 1982, as part of the campaign by G.M.'s former chairman, Roger B. Smith, to increase productivity through automation.


Practicing Acupuncture Made Easy
Dr.
Doreen Chen first studied acupuncture 40 years ago in rural Chinese villages.
She did not press her first silver needle into a patient's skin until her teachers were satisfied that she understood the philosophies of harmony and equilibrium that guided the needle.
And she did not receive her license in to practice acupuncture on her own until she had completed a long and rigorous apprenticeship.
Now, she says with quiet but obvious outrage that New York State "wants to call someone an acupuncturist after some classes and a test."

Bridge
It is well-known, in theory, that if a partnership has a fit in two suits the one that is divided evenly may be more productive.
A 4-4 fit, for example, may be more desirable than 5-3, or 5-4, or 6-3, or 6-4, because the long suit can provide discards.
But there are many exceptions, and the right time for the 4-4 is hard to spot in practice.
The diagramed example occurred recently in a trial for the selection of the British team in this year's World Team Olympiad, due to take place in Salsomaggiore, Italy, in August.
All but one of the pairs holding the North-South cards landed in six spades, and West had no trouble in leading the diamond king and defeating the slam.
One suspects that a great majority of expert American pairs would suffer the same bidding failure.


Market Place; Win or Lose, Buyouts Do It Big
The bankruptcy filing of R. H. Macy &amp; Company represents yet another leveraged buyout gone bad.
But while the list of leveraged failures is long, the list of leveraged successes is also substantial.
Safeway, the supermarket chain; Duracell, the battery maker; American Medical International, which owns hospitals, and RJR Nabisco, the largest leveraged buyout ever, have succeeded despite the huge debts they took on.
Among the companies that went from buyout to bankruptcy are Federated Department Stores, the parent of Bloomingdale's and Abraham &amp; Straus; Jim Walter, a leading home builder; Southland, the owner of the 7-Eleven stores, and Interco, a shoe and furniture company.
Mitigating Factors
Luck played a part in which group a company ended up in.
It is not Macy's fault that the economy entered a prolonged period of weakness just as the company needed to improve cash flow.
But there is also the matter of timing, and of the rising optimism through much of the 1980's.
In general, leveraged purchases in the last years of the decade were made at much higher prices than those earlier in the decade.
It was not impossible to make a good deal in 1987, but it was highly unlikely.


Late Changes Are Ordered on Health Budget
Top officials at the White House today ordered Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, to pull back and rewrite crucial provisions of the national health-care plan that was to have been sent to Congress this week as part of President Bush's budget package.
The action came at the insistence of Republicans in Congress, who vehemently objected to some of the detailed health-care proposals that Mr.
Darman had drafted for inclusion in Mr.
Bush's budget.


2d Sayville Fire in 8 Days Kills 2 in Business District

The fire, labeled suspicious by the police, occurred eight days after three arson fires destroyed nine stores in the wood-frame Victorian buildings of the old Sayville business district, where some structures date to the 1840's.

Court Shifts California's Political Lines
In a move that alters the political landscape of California, the State Supreme Court today imposed a new redistricting plan that is widely expected to accelerate Republican gains in the largest state.
Political experts say Republicans could take control of the state's huge Congressional delegation this year and possibly both houses of the State Legislature within two to four years.
The plan ignored existing district lines, thereby putting many powerful incumbents in both Congress and the Legislature in the difficult position of either running against other incumbents or moving to less reliable districts.


German Film Makers Express Support for 'Europa'
Many of Germany's leading film makers, citing "the special responsibility the past imposes upon us," have joined a protest against the German Export Film Union's decision not to submit "Europa, Europa" for Academy Award consideration as best foreign film.
The film, about a Jewish youth's surviving the Holocaust, was written and directed by Agnieszka Holland, who was born in Poland and lives in Paris.
It was named best foreign film of 1991 by the New York and Boston film critics and by the National Board of Review, and on Jan. 18 it received the Golden Globe award in that category.
But the decision by a panel of German producers not to nominate the film, which is now playing in New York and about 40 other American cities, has touched off an outcry by its creators, producers and other film makers who say it was not nominated because its subject matter is an embarrassment to contemporary Germany.

Often he opened an umbrella, even though it was not raining.
Although he danced with a woman at various times, he was always left alone again, waiting.

The Senate is scheduled to vote today on a bill that would end these egregious practices.
It deserves enthusiastic support.

Five Jurors Chosen as Tyson Trial Begins
In the left corner of Courtroom 4 today, Mike Tyson, former heavyweight champion of the world, watched as two teams of lawyers began the tedious process of choosing the 12 Marion County citizens who will determine his fate.
By the end of the day, the first of what is expected to be at least a two-week trial on rape and related charges, five jurors had been selected.
Potential jurors were questioned about whether they would hold a celebrity to a higher standard of conduct than someone else and whether they believed a woman had the right to say no, and even about their feelings on the recent William Kennedy Smith trial.
Statements Wednesday?
Jury selection in the Tyson trial is to continue Tuesday morning and, if all goes according to the schedule set by Judge Patricia J. Gifford, lawyers will present their opening statements Wednesday afternoon.

Fox Stole Ratings but Not the Show From CBS
A few final notes on Super Bowl XXVI:
"IN LIVING COLOR" MAY HAVE BEEN AN EMBARRASSMENT BUT IT DID ITS JOB: The Fox Network show fell down on its promise to review the first half of Super Bowl, instead relying on canned sketches.
The "Men on Football" segment, coming on late in the show, fell flat and showed the staff had barely watched the game.
Although the effort was a long tumble into an abyss of limp, humorless taste, the live show still pulled viewers Fox's way.

Careers; Schooling Engineers in Environment
TOMORROW'S engineers -- and today's as well -- must be grounded in environmental science, says Dr.

Two reasons he cited were the growing contamination of the environment and the need for a broader education to assure jobs.
"Our graduates have been getting jobs and with little trouble," he said in an interview last week.
He contrasted that to the situation at many universities whose engineering graduates have difficulty finding jobs in the current market.
He thinks that a requirement since 1984 that every student at the School of Mines take at least one course in environmental science is a helpful start.

Kia, of Korea, Plans to Sell Vehicles in U.S
The Kia Motors Corporation of South Korea said today that it would develop a dealer network in the United States to start selling subcompact cars and small sport-utility vehicles in 1993.
Kia, which is South Korea's No. 2 auto maker, after Hyundai, makes the Festiva subcompact distributed by Ford in the United States.
Kia also announced that W. Gregory Warner, a former Hyundai Motor America executive, would oversee the North American project as chief operating officer.
Mr.
Warner, who is 48 years old, has been a consultant to Kia since November.
Quality Called Imperative
Kia faces many challenges in the American market as it takes aim at sedan buyers whose choices include the acclaimed Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla models.
Hyundai entered the American market in the late 1980's with a very strong start, but sales suffered after quality problems arose.
In contrast, the Festiva made by Kia received a high reliability rating in the Consumer Reports 1991 car guide.

At times, voters can legitimately ask about a political candidate's financial, sexual or other personal conduct; it can bear on one's capacity for public service.

So far at least, Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas and his wife have found a reasonable place to draw a line between the two, responding to the first curiosity while resisting the second.
In a televised interview Sunday night, Mr.
Clinton, an early front-runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination, responded to stories, some of which have burdened his long years in office, alleging extramarital affairs.


Stocks Gain in Tokyo
Stock prices rose in Tokyo today.
At the end of the afternoon trading session, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 383.41 points, or 1.83 percent, to 21,390.52.
On Monday, the index lost 65.04 points.


Dinkins Plans New Taxes And Job Cuts
Mayor David N. Dinkins will propose more big cuts in spending for long-term construction projects, new taxes on gasoline and automobiles, higher income taxes on commuters and a four-year freeze in property tax rates when he presents his preliminary budget for New York City on Thursday, city officials said yesterday.
The Mayor must present a plan for closing a $1.8 billion gap in the $29 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
He must also show how he proposes to keep the budget balanced over the next four years, in hopes of winning support for a $1 billion bond deal with the Municipal Assistance Corporation to ease the pain of spending and service cuts.


Greenstone Roberts To Buy Ackerman
Greenstone Roberts Advertising, the largest advertising agency on Long Island, yesterday announced its fourth acquisition in the last 10 months.
The Melville-based shop has agreed to purchase Ackerman Advertising Communications, Glen Head, L.I., in a move that could add about $10 million in billings to Greenstone's $70 million.
Ackerman's clients include divisions of Avis Car Leasing and King Kullen supermarkets.


Health Costs Up 12.1% Last Year, a Study Says
Employers' health-care costs rose by 12.1 percent nationwide, to $3,605 per employee last year, or about four times as fast as overall living costs, according to a survey released yesterday.
What is more, analysts said the annual increase in 1992 would be higher.
Health costs in 1991 were the highest in the Middle Atlantic States, averaging $4,066 an employee, and were the second highest in New England, at $3,918, followed by $3,659 on the West Coast, $3,546 in the Midwest, $3,412 in the South Atlantic States, and $3,262 in the Mountain States.


New York City Slips in Survey on Why Businesses Leave
On the two issues that most affect business decisions to relocate, New York City's performance is significantly worse than it was five years ago, a survey of city business leaders has found.
When asked to rate 15 considerations that might affect a company's location, 74.9 percent of those interviewed cited the overall cost of conducting business and 60.6 percent cited citywide security as extremely important.
Of those choosing these two issues, more than 80 percent said they thought New York was worse off now than it was five years ago.

New York City Schools Can't Afford Any More Budget Cuts
To the Editor:
I was appointed to the New York City Board of Education on July 1, 1990 -- a little more than 19 months ago.
It was an exciting time for me.
After all, it was a predominantly new board -- five new members out of seven, mostly women, significant Latino representation for the first time in the history of the board, an outspoken Republican member, a Parent-Teacher Association activist and generally a good mix of committed people who wanted to change the school system so that all of our students could succeed

A Brain Cell Surprise: Genes Don't Set Function
YOUNG nerve cells can wander far greater distances across the growing brain than anyone previously imagined, two scientists have found.
And once the neurons have settled into a particular neighborhood, they learn what they are meant to do from signals that surround them, rather than from an innate genetic program, the researchers said.
The new research strongly supports the idea that the cerebral cortex, the most advanced component of the mammalian brain, is extremely supple and responsive to its environment, instead of being fixed early on by a blueprint in the genes, as some scientists had believed.

61 Acts of Bias: One Fuse Lights Many Different Explosions
Since Jan. 6, when a gang of white youths yelling racial epithets squirted white sneaker polish on two black children in the Bronx, bias incidents have rained down hard and heavy in New York City.
Sixty-one cases have been reported so far, ranging from racial slurs hurled from a passing car to subway riders slapped in the face to a 15-year-old honor student raped, her attackers told her, because she was "white and perfect."


The 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week; For the Front-Runners, Crucial Days Are Here
Pace-setters often fade in the stretch.
It happens to horses, and it happens to politicians.
So this week, which should show something about the staying power of the presumed front-runners in the New Hampshire primary, could turn out to be highly significant.
Neither President Bush nor Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas is likely to find the going easy.
Mr.
Bush must somehow manage, in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, to convince the intensely provincial people here that he has a concrete program to pull their state out of recession.
Mr.
Clinton must somehow recover his balance after being staggered by allegations of marital infidelity last week.


Patterns
Badgley Mischka Acquired
The young design team of Badgley Mischka, known for its slinky women's evening clothes, was acquired yesterday by Escada, the large German fashion company.
Badgley Mischka, founded in 1988 by Mark Badgley and James Mischka, had held discussions with several possible investors before entering into the agreement with Escada.
"We've become partners with them," said Mr.
Mischka, who added that Escada would finance all existing production and future collections.
Mr.
Badgley and Mr.
Mischka said they would retain creative control and a financial stake in Badgley Mischka, as it will still be called.
"Their fabric resources and production capabilities open up a whole new world to us," Mr.
Badgley said. 'From T-Shirts to Tuxedos'
Even amid the shock waves of the R. H. Macy earthquake, there is considerable positive energy this week in fashion.
The Paris spring couture shows are up and running.
And it is also men's-wear market week in New York, with top designers exhibiting their wares on the runway.
Some of the heavyweights of women's fashion have lately jumped into the men's-wear arena, including Calvin Klein and Donna Karan.
Mr.
Klein, who dropped out of men's tailored clothing in the late 1980's, showed his comeback fall men's collection in his packed showroom yesterday afternoon.
Very big deal.
Madonna in the front row, along with Hollywood types like David Geffen, Barry Diller and Matthew Modine (whom does
he
write for?). Mr. Klein showed a complete wardrobe for men, from cashmere overcoats to tailored suits, which will cost $800 to $1,200, and lots and lots of underwear, modeled by chiseled men.
Ms.
Karan, whose father was a men's tailor, is into her second season of men's wear.
She said yesterday that her first collection, carried exclusively by Barneys New York, was a sellout.
She shows tomorrow.
Michael Kors, another designer who has made his mark with women's clothes, is showing his men's collection this evening on a balcony at Grand Central Terminal.
"Everything from T-shirts to tuxedos," Mr.
Kors said.
Mr.
Kors plans to show bodysuits for men, with dress shirts attached to underpants.
This will make tucking in the shirt unnecessary, but could incite untold amounts of yanking and hitching.
Star Power
The Council of Fashion Designers of America, which will give its annual awards Monday evening, has nailed down more presenters.
Uma Thurman, the actress, is to present the designer-of-the-year award to Isaac Mizrahi.
Peter Fonda, of "Easy Rider" fame, has been enlisted to present a special award to Harley-Davidson Inc., for popularizing the biker look.
Thierry Mugler is to present a fashion journalism award to Mary Lou Luther of the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, who will wear Mugler.
Tickets for the dinner and awards presentation are still available to the public.
The council's number is (212) 302-1821.
And Charge It
Everyone orders by mail these days, even royals.
Recently, Ann Taylor received an order for a double-breasted jacket in pink wool crepeand black pleated skirt, short.
The instructions were to "bill to Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York," said Geri Savidge, a spokeswoman for Ann Taylor, who added that the order was confirmed by her official dresser.
The Duchess must have seen the outfit in Vogue, Ms.
Savidge said, the only place it was advertised.

Witness in Teaneck Case Disputes Police Account
A major state witness in the manslaughter trial of a Teaneck police officer, Gary Spath, finished two days of testimony today by stating that Phillip Pannell, a black teen-ager, had his hands raised when the officer fatally shot him in the back.
The expert, Lucien C. Haag, said he "rejected" Officer Spath's statement -- made to a Bergen county detective two days after the shooting in April 1990 -- that the teen-ager's arms were down and he was reaching toward a gun in the left pocket of his bulky parka.


U.S.-Japan Auto Parts Rift Grows
In tones reflecting the increasingly combative exchanges between Japan and the United States, the head of a Japanese auto group said today that it was "incomprehensible" that Detroit had not accepted Tokyo's offer to buy $19 billion more in American-made auto parts.
He said top Japanese executives "have no intention" of discussing the issue again with the Big Three.
The comments by Yutaka Kume, the president of Nissan Motor Company and the chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, virtually erased any hopes of continuing discussions among the world's biggest auto makers about how to close the trade gap between the countries.


Elizabeth Walters, 86, An Author of Manuals
Elizabeth Ogg Walters, the author of many public affairs studies, died on Jan. 14 at St.
Luke's Hospital in Manhattan.
She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.
She died of pneumonia, after having been hit on Dec. 1 by a bus near her Fifth Avenue residence, said Arnold Allentuch, her executor and friend.
Mrs.
Walters, who used the pen name, Elizabeth Ogg, wrote nearly 50 pamphlets dealing mainly with mental health and social problems for the Public Affairs Committee, Inc. of New York City.
Her widely cited pamphlets include: "Your Nursing Services Today and Tomorrow," "A New Chapter in Family Planning," "When a Family Faces Stress" and "Good News for Stroke Victims."


President Puts Final Touches On State of Union Message
President Bush today began final preparations for his State of the Union Message to Congress on Tuesday night, reviewing final drafts of the speech and delivering the first of two dress-rehearsal readings to aides in a theater in the East Wing of the White House.
Mr.
Bush's recitation signaled the end of a gantlet through which speechwriters and advisers have alternately dashed and staggered, nights and weekends, for almost a month.

What Courier Must Do To Take the No. 1 Spot
JIM COURIER could overtake STEFAN EDBERG and claim the No. 1 spot in the Association of Tennis Professionals ranking if he gets to the final of the Volvo Tennis tournament in San Francisco next week, according to an A.T.P. spokesman.
Courier, currently No. 2, beat top-ranked Edberg in the final of the Australian Open on Sunday and trails the Swede by only 19 points in the A.T.P. computer.
Edberg currently is not scheduled to play in either the San Francisco or Milan tournaments next week.
If Edberg stays inactive, Courier could overtake him two ways in San Francisco: by either reaching the final or, if he plays highly ranked opponents early in the tournament, by accumulating 15 bonus points and just making it to the semifinals.


First the Fidgeting, Then the Fame
Backstage, the members of the cast are starting to fidget, and for good reason: Final reviews are about to be rendered and championships bestowed for last year's performances, and the curtain is about to rise on the new year's national racing drama.
The stage is being set in Las Vegas, Nev., where the Eclipse Awards will be announced Saturday, crowning winners in 10 divisions from juvenile prodigies to Horse of the Year.


Israeli Government Survives No-Confidence Vote
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Government survived a string of no-confidence votes in Parliament today, overcoming its first such challenge since two small, right-wing parties defected from the governing coalition last week, stripping it of a majority.
Opposition movements brought a total of five motions of no-confidence to protest the Government's handling of social and economic matters.
But the motions were defeated in a single 55-49 vote after several hours of debate.

Chapter Starting at Macy's, Ending at Federated
The bankruptcy filing by R. H. Macy &amp; Company yesterday came just a week before Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Straus, Rich's and other department stores, is expected to emerge from bankruptcy protection after two years.
Federated, the first large department store chain to emerge from bankruptcy, filed for protection on Jan. 15, 1990, after it was swamped by the debts incurred by its parent, the Campeau Corporation, in buying the Federated stores.
Campeau shareholders will vote today on the proposed plan to emerge from bankruptcy.


Experts Say Logging Of Vast Siberian Forest Could Foster Warming
THE forests of the Amazon and other tropical regions have been getting attention for some time, and understandably so.
They are home to a disproportionate share of the world's living species, they absorb huge amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide that would otherwise exert a big heating effect on the earth's climate and they are rapidly being destroyed.
Less well known is the vast stretch of fir, larch, spruce and pine that girdles the continents at far northern latitudes and is known as the taiga.
The word is derived from the Russian, appropriately enough since the Siberian part of the taiga is the largest forest in the world, far larger than the Brazilian Amazon.
At more than two million square miles, it would cover the entire continental United States excepting Alaska.
Like the tropical forests, it is a major absorber of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

In a Speech, President Returns to Religious Themes
Reviving social and religious themes that are seldom heard in his oratory except in election years, President Bush today called for voluntary prayer in schools, pledged to curtail "the decline of the American family" and cited the teachings of Jesus Christ as the moral force behind the Persian Gulf war.
"Obviously no country can claim a special place in God's heart," Mr.
Bush said in an address to the National Religious Broadcasters, a group of Christian radio and television station officials.
"Yet we are better as a people because He has a special place in ours."


Dow Edges Up 7.83 and Closes at 3,240.61
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, with blue chips posting small gains while the broader market was weak.
Many cautious investors moved to the sidelines in anticipation of the President's State of the Union Message tonight.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.83 points to finish at 3,240.61, but all the other leading indexes wound up with losses.


In West Bank Town, Curfew Deepens Resentment
Living every night under military curfew, Saleh Abdel-Jawad says, means that seemingly small decisions can sometimes loom large.
"A few nights ago my daughter was sick and needed to be looked at," said Professor Abdel-Jawad, who teaches political science at Bir Zeit University.
"Fortunately, it was not urgent. If it was urgent, I might have risked the indignities I probably would have faced if the Israeli soldiers stopped me. But I would rather not go through that. I waited until the next day to take her to the doctor."


Investor Takes Over As Head of L.A. Gear
No one expected Stanley P. Gold to be a passive investor when he bought 34 percent of L.A.
Gear Inc. last year for an investment fund he runs for Roy E. Disney.
So it came as no surprise last weekend when Mr.
Gold became the new chairman and chief executive of the financially troubled footwear company, replacing L.A.
Gear's co-founder and chairman, Robert S. Greenberg.
Mr.
Greenberg, whose resignation was announced with Mr.
Gold's appointment Sunday, had built L.A.
Gear into one of the nation's leading athletic shoe companies by concentrating on fashionable sneakers for women, a market largely ignored by Nike Inc. and Reebok International Ltd.
But the company faltered after it expanded into clothing and tried to compete with Nike and Reebok in men's athletic shoes.


Yeltsin, Out of Sight Again, Prompts Anxiety and Rumor
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia made another characteristically abrupt retreat from public life today, this time stirring a sense of mystery and diplomatic risk on the eve of the Middle East conference here of leading nations whose economic aid he has been courting.
Mr.
Yeltsin has canceled all meetings for two days and left Moscow to focus on domestic problems and a coming foreign mission, according to the office of the Russian President, who has previously disappeared on sudden restorative retreats that caused world anxiety about the stability of this troubled nation and its leader.


Florio's Budget Plan Charts Collision Course With G.O.P.
The Florio administration unveiled a budget today that counts on a turnaround in the economy, a substantial reduction in state payments for pensions, and as-yet-unapproved Federal Medicaid payments to bring it into balance.
It also counts on sales tax revenues that the Republicans, who control both houses of the Legislature, have vowed to cut.
The precariously balanced budget is the largest in state history at $15.7 billion -- actually more than $16 billion if an unappropriated buffer of about $300 million is included.
It relies heavily on a new formula that would cut state pension contributions and increase the amount to be paid from the investment income of the pension funds.
No Drop in Sales Tax


N.H.L. Suspends Jagr
JAROMIR JAGR, the Penguins' all-star forward, was suspended by the National Hockey League yesterday for 10 games for skating into Referee RON HOGGARTH in the final minute of Pittsburgh's 6-4 loss to Washington Capitals on Sunday.
Jagr, a left wing, can appeal the suspension to the league.
The ban would last until the Penguins' Feb. 20 game against Quebec.


Gotti Trial Judge Is Urged To Limit Cross-Examining
Prosecutors in John Gotti's racketeering trial urged the judge yesterday to limit the defense's ability to cross-examine three former high-ranking mob figures about murders they had committed.
The mob figures are considered key prosecution witnesses -- Philip Leonetti, a Philadelphia mobster who has admitted taking part in 10 murders; Peter Chiodo, a Genovese crime-family captain who has acknowledged 4 murders, and Salvatore Gravano, a Gambino leader who is expected to testify that he participated in additional slayings.

Disney Earnings Up by 22%
The Walt Disney Company said today that its profits improved 22 percent in the most recent quarter, as several lucrative movies compensated for weak attendance at the company's theme parks.
Disney said earnings for the quarter that ended on Dec. 31 rose to $208.1 million, or $1.56 a share, from $170.4 million, or $1.28 a share, a year earlier.


G.M. Unit Settles Mortgage Escrow Suit
One of the country's largest mortgage lenders settled a Federal lawsuit yesterday by agreeing to refund tens of millions of dollars to hundreds of thousands of homeowners who officials said had been forced to pay excessive amounts into escrow accounts.
The Attorneys General of 12 states, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California, said their settlement with the General Motors Corporation's mortgage unit represented a significant victory against widespread abuse in mortgage lending.
They expressed the hope that the settlement would result in reforms nationwide.


Ground Is Broken for a New Federal Courthouse in Lower Manhattan


Amended Charge for Howe
Federal prosecutors have decided to amend their misdemeanor charge against Steve Howe, the Yankee pitcher who was arrested near here last month for possession of cocaine.
The new charge has come three days before the 33-year-old athlete was to go on trial and will force the trial to be postponed.
Stephen Nardi, one of two local defense attorneys representing Howe, said the United States Attorney's office in Helena informed Howe today that he was being charged with an additional misdemeanor count -- that of "attempted possession" of a dangerous drug.
The original count against Howe, filed by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration Dec. 19, charged Howe only with possession of cocaine.
The pitcher, who was arrested and charged with buying a gram of cocaine from an informant, must be arraigned a second time, said Nardi.


China Reports Freeing 9 Democracy Campaigners
China said today that it had recently released nine people who had been held in connection with the Tiananmen democracy movement of 1989.
The State Council Information Office declined to identify the nine, who apparently had been held for about two and a half years without charge.
But John T. Kamm, an American business executive and human rights advocate who has successfully negotiated the release of dissidents before, said Chinese officials gave him the nine names on Saturday.


Bad News for Bush as Poll Shows National Gloom
In his State of the Union Message tonight, President Bush will address a nation that is gloomier than it has been in 13 years, more disapproving of his Presidency than ever and increasingly willing to try a Democrat in the White House, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
The survey suggests that Mr.
Bush's speech at 9 o'clock tonight may be the most important of his Presidency.
He is facing a discontented and volatile electorate that on a variety of issues is willing to give the opposition party the benefit of the doubt.


Shamans and Scientists Seek Cures in Plants
FOR ages, traditional remedies derived from plants were the primary form of medical care for the world's people, and for three-quarters of the global population they still are.
But in the United States, medical researchers have generally been lukewarm at best about investigating the undeniable curative properties of plants.
This is not just a prejudice in favor of modern medicine; isolating specific plant compounds can be a difficult technical task.


Fined for Roughness
Separate referee-bumping incidents on Saturday night resulted in fines and one-game suspensions imposed yesterday by the National Basketball Association against Nets assistant coach TOM NEWELL and Houston Rockets guard VERNON MAXWELL.
Newell was assessed a $2,000 fine along with the suspension for bumping Referee STEVE JAVIE after being ejected with 7 minutes 48 seconds remaining in the third quarter of the Nets' game at Philadelphia.
Newell will miss tonight's game between the Nets and Kings in Sacramento.


SETBACK AT POLLS FOR MITTERRAND
The governing Socialist Party of President Francois Mitterrand, battered by a weak economy and mired in a leadership crisis, suffered a humiliating defeat in parliamentary and municipal by-elections on Sunday as support for the far-right National Front surged.
The results of the six by-elections, released today, suggest that the popularity of Socialists has fallen to its lowest point since Mr.
Mitterrand took office a decade ago.
They also disclosed an angry French electorate, tired of traditional parties, drawn to the xenophobic platform of the National Front, which proposes sending immigrants back to the countries they came from.


Anatomy of Integrated Program For Macs
PROGRAMS that can do more than one thing are tempting for many computer users, particularly novices, or even veterans whose demands are relatively light.
If you do not need all the features and complications of WordPerfect, dBase and Lotus 1-2-3, but do need to write, keep track of data and manipulate spreadsheets, a so-called integrated program may be just the ticket.
ClarisWorks, for Apple Macintosh computers, is about as integrated as an integrated program can get.
It combines word processing, graphics, database, spreadsheet and communications in one package, and you do not usually have to leave one module to use another.
For instance, while writing a report, you can call on the spreadsheet to make a calculation and later print the report and the spreadsheet as a single document.

A Judge Who Often Aids Debtors
R.
H.
Macy &amp; Company will have its day in court in front of one of the favorite judges of lawyers representing bankrupt clients.
Judge Burton R. Lifland, the 62-year-old chief judge of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, has a reputation for giving debtors the benefit of most doubts.
Perhaps the most obvious indication of Judge Lifland's sympathies is his patience in allowing companies operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to come up with debt-reorganization plans.
The bankruptcy law guarantees a company three months in which it has the exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan.
But a judge may extend that, and in November Judge Lifland -- for the 19th time in five and a half years -- agreed to give the LTV Corporation more time to submit its plan, although he also allowed creditors to file a competing plan.


Tyson Stays Silent; His Supporters Don't
The television lights abruptly fired up and, at 8:54 o'clock here this morning, Mike Tyson came striding through the revolving door of the City-County Building.
Behind the police restraints, the crowd was waiting for him.
There were photographers, cameramen, reporters with note pads and onlookers who either stood silent or shouted encouragement to the former heavyweight champion.


MACY'S ASKS COURT TO PROVIDE SHIELD AGAINST CREDITORS
R.
H.
Macy &amp; Company, the proud retail business whose executives confidently took on billions in debt in the late 1980's, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday, finally admitting defeat in its bruising battle with creditors and the deteriorating economy.
At a brief noontime meeting, the company's board voted unanimously to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
Several board members, including Laurence A. Tisch, whose Loews Corporation had tried to prop up Macy with a $1 billion buyout plan, participated by telephone.


Computers Are Distributed Containing Software Virus
A personal computer manufacturer has notified its dealers that in December the company accidentally shipped as many as 500 personal computers with a potent computer virus.
The company, Leading Edge Products Inc., based in Westboro, Mass., sent a letter to its dealers' service centers on Jan. 14 warning that computers shipped from the company's warehouse between Dec. 10 and Dec. 27 may have been infected with a virus known as Michelangelo.

Friends of Victim Testify In Teaneck Officer Trial
The prosecution rested its case this morning in the manslaughter trial of a Teaneck police officer accused of killing a 16-year-old youth.
The defense then began calling teen-age friends of the slain youth, Phillip Pannell, and police officials in an effort to link Mr.
Pannell to a handgun and to undermine the credibility of a witness to the shooting.


Mutombo Is All-Star
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO, the Denver Nuggets' highly celebrated rookie, will be the only first-year player in the National Basketball Association's All-Star Game Feb. 9 in Orlando, Fla.
The 7-foot-2-inch Mutombo was one of 14 reserves named yesterday by the league's head coaches.


No More Hissing the Ham: Food Is Now a Star
THE Playbills should include menus this season.
In theaters around town, Italian food, Jewish food, French food, junk food and yuppie food are central to the settings and action.
It's not the first time food has been a supporting player on stage, but there is more of it now.
This is not some proper cup of tea in the drawing room or a musical glass of Champagne, but copious quantities of food.
Dinner for the cast and, sometimes during intermission, for the stage crew.
Hunger pangs for the audience.


Bridge
If there were a vote for the best-played hand of all time, there would be many candidates.
But if the field is restricted to deals played by top-ranked players on a major occasion, the choice is more limited and the one shown in the diagram would be one of the favorites.
It was played in 1970 in Winnipeg, Canada, and the hero was Giorgio Belladonna of Italy.
He was playing for the Omar Sharif Circus, which was competing daily in different cities against Ira Corn's Aces.
East-West for the Aces were Bob Goldman and Bill Eisenberg, and the North player, partnering Belladonna, was Claude Delmouly of France.


Ratings Mixed for Super Bowl
The CBS broadcast of Super Bowl XXVI recorded a Nielsen rating of 40.3, with a 61 share, down from the 41.9/63 for last year's Giants-Bills game.
Although the rating fell, CBS said the game drew a total audience of 120 million viewers, the second-highest total since 127 million watched in 1986.
The CBS total figure is the number of viewers who watched some portion of the game.
Nielsen computed that 80 million viewers watched during an average minute.


Dow Corning's Failure In Public Opinion Test
Regardless of whether Dow Corning Inc. ever convinces regulators that its silicone-gel breast implants are safe, the company seems likely to be branded as one of several that have bungled their handling of an accident or product defect, according to public relations and crisis management experts.
Dow Corning's handling of the growing controversy that led to the Food and Drug Administration on Jan. 6 to call for a moratorium on breast implants is increasingly being compared to the Exxon Corporation's response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the Johns Manville Corporation's treatment of its asbestos woes, and A. H. Robins's debacle with its Dalkon Shield birth control device.
Critics say that Dow Corning's mistakes include a lack of public action by Lawrence A. Reed, the company's chief executive; too little sympathy and support for women who say they were harmed, and the failure to get the worst news out quickly.


Prices Rise as Confidence Drops
A surprisingly big drop in consumer confidence and sales of big inventories of corporate bonds helped to lift prices of Treasury securities yesterday.
In addition, an important measure of inflation showed that cost pressures continued to weaken in the fourth quarter, a trend that analysts expect to continue.


American Express's Net Jumps 72.2%
Coming off a year of financial turmoil in its main lines of business, the American Express Company said yesterday that its earnings rose 72.2 percent last quarter, bolstered by record results in its consumer financial and information services business.
But analysts viewed the overall results as poor.
The financial services company said its quarterly profits rose to $237.4 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $137.9 million, or 28 cents a share, in the comparable period of 1990.


Budget Pretense in New Jersey
Gov.
Jim Florio's new budget for New Jersey offers more spending, no new taxes and no more layoffs.
Nice trick if he could pull it off.
But there's a new reality in Trenton.
The Democratic Governor's budget will be filtered through a Republican Legislature this year, and the Republicans are determined to cut both taxes and spending.
At this stage, both he and they are just sparring.
Mr.
Florio's $15.7 billion proposal for the year starting July 1 -- $700 million more than the current year -- rests on uncertain assumptions of increased revenues.
He hopes that an economic recovery will yield higher state tax collections, that Washington will provide a windfall of Medicaid reimbursements and that the Legislature will approve revised accounting for state pension funds.
He also proposes small spending cuts, of less than 1 percent, for most state agencies.


The Other Crime Trial: A Gambino Heir
Thomas Gambino, the son of the late reputed Mafia boss Carlo Gambino, apparently never aspired to inherit the leadership of the organized-crime family that some law-enforcement officials expected his father to bequeath him at his death in 1976.
Instead, the officials said, Mr.
Gambino carved out an exclusive sideline for himself in New York City's garment industry, ultimately placing what they said was an extortionate stranglehold over the industry's trucking business and successfully mediating rival interests of two other Mafia families.

Trees That Yield a Drug For Cancer Are Wasted
Nearly a year after the Government recognized the Pacific yew as the most valuable tree in American forests because it yields a rare cancer-fighting drug, the precious bark is still being burned as scrap and discarded to rot on the forest floor in wasteful logging operations in the Northwest.
Here in the Umpqua National Forest one January day, a crew of Forest Service workers set fire to a huge pile of downed trees, the garbage of a typical logging operation on Government land.
But among the wood smoldering in the pile were several yew trees covered with sections of bark.

Sounds of the 70's
The 1970's keep on intruding, declaring themselves as an important decade.
"Pimps, Players and Private Eyes" (Sire), a compilation of tunes from "blaxploitation" movies, attempts to resuscitate the funk and soul sounds of that decade.
Produced by Jorge Hinojosa and the rapper Ice-T, the album includes tunes by Bobby Womack, Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield.
The movies raided include "Superfly," "The Mack," "Cleopatra Jones," "Shaft," "Shaft in Africa" and "Across 110th Street."

Is Islamic Fundamentalism a New Red Scare?
To the Editor:
What is Islamic fundamentalism?
I consider myself a student of Islamic history and have practiced Islam for 60-odd years, have read and understand the Koran and consider it just like the Bible and the Torah as the word of God.
What is this "march of Islamic fundamentalism" to which you refer (news article, Jan. 1)?
I know of Christian fundamentalist priests, but Islam does not allow any kind of priesthood, fundamental or otherwise.

Bank Problems Lingering on Long Island
Some of the largest banks on Long Island are finding that their problems with bad real estate loans are lingering longer than at many other banks in the Northeast, whose loan problems have begun to subside.
The North Fork Bank in Mattituck, for example, said Friday that it expected its fourth-quarter results -- and those for all of 1991 -- to show a large loss.
"Much of the loss is attributed to the write-down of Long Island real estate values held as collateral for loans," the company said.


Profits Rise 19.8% at Merck; Warner-Lambert Has Loss
In a case of good and not-so-good news in the pharmaceutical industry yesterday, Merck &amp; Company added to its string of double-digit earnings gains in the final quarter of 1991, while the Warner-Lambert Company reported losses because of previously announced restructuring and accounting charges.
Following are details from the companies' reports: Merck
Surpassing the forecasts of some analysts, Merck, the world's largest prescription drug maker, announced a 19.8 percent gain in quarterly profits, to $529.8 million, or $1.37 a share, from $442.2 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier.

Tyson Side Protests a Juror's Dismissal
The racial composition of the jury took center stage in the Mike Tyson rape trial today, as his lawyers accused the prosecution of excluding a man from the jury for the sole reason that the man is black.

Tyson is charged with raping an 18-year-old woman when she visited his hotel room during a beauty pageant here last summer.


Tale of a Chinese Deportee Is Haunting Japan
Five months after deporting a Chinese woman who had fled to Japan to claim political asylum, the Japanese Government reacted with embarrassment and concern today over a new report that she had been arrested and imprisoned in her home province.
At the time of her deportation last August, Japan dismissed the woman's request to be considered a political refugee and forced her onto a plane in the southern city of Fukuoka to Shanghai.
The move was deplored by Amnesty International, Asia Watch and other rights groups.


The Once and Future Intern's Lament
To the Editor:

I am a recent graduate of Catholic University of America, who like many of my fellow graduates, saw graduation as a step toward an exciting and challenging future.
I was under the impression that if I worked hard during college and received good grades, a career, or a job for that matter, would follow.
Well, that impression was surely a farce.


Dinkins Aides Fear Cuts In Construction Spending
Mayor David N. Dinkins's latest proposals for cutting New York City's capital budget for construction took his own city agency heads by surprise when City Hall announced them on Monday, and yesterday many commissioners were still scrambling to figure out what the cuts would mean.
The cuts in capital spending are part of the Mayor's plan for closing at least $8 billion in gaps between projected city revenues and spending over the next four years, and were decided by senior city officials over the weekend, after they reached the limits of their willingess to cut other spending for city services.

I.B.M. to Invest $100 Million in Groupe Bull
I.B.M. will pay about $100 million for a stake in Groupe Bull, France's troubled state-owned computer maker, under a wide-ranging technical and commercial agreement announced today.
The accord, announced by Prime Minister Edith Cresson after a meeting with President Francois Mitterrand, suggests that pragmatism is winning out over political posturing among Europe's troubled computer makers.
As a symbol of French technological independence, Bull had long seen I.B.M., whose stake will be between 5 and 10 percent, as a threat rather than a potential ally.

Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, restored to good humor and some short-term political stability by news of several polls showing that most New Hampshire voters care little about recent accusations of marital infidelity, today returned to criticizing President Bush about the nation's troubled economy.
Even Mr.
Clinton's opponents acknowledge that his organizers in Texas have assembled the most extensive network of endorsements so far this year.
They also say that the assertions of marital infidelity against the Governor do not appear to have cost him any of his early strength in Texas, one of the 11 states whose voters will participate in primaries on March 10.

BUSH VOWS ECONOMIC RELIEF AND PROPOSES MODEST STEPS IN STATE OF THE UNION TALK
Staking his political fortunes on advice that the economy will right itself by summer, President Bush delivered a State of the Union Message tonight that offered modest proposals to ease the immediate pain of middle-class taxpayers and erase any impression that he is insensitive to America's economic burdens.
Mr.
Bush used his own powers to give some quick relief to taxpayers and inject about $20 billion into the economy in the next six months.
He directed that tax-withholding rules be changed immediately, meaning that some money normally given back later in refunds will be left in paychecks so it can be spent quickly.
The change is expected to inject some $2 billion a month into the economy when fully effective.
Mr.
Bush also ordered Federal spending on some programs accelerated.

Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday comparing the R. H. Macy &amp; Company bankruptcy filing with several others misstated the time elapsed since a filing by Revco D.S.

The article also referred incorrectly to the bankruptcy plan of the Campeau Corporation.
That plan has no relationship to the bankruptcy proceedings of Federated Department Stores Inc., and when Federated emerges from bankruptcy it will have no ties to Campeau, its former parent.

Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit dropped slightly for the week ended yesterday, according to figures released by The Bank Rate Monitor, which watches bank rates.

Punishing the Victims in Unwed Births
To the Editor:
In "Stop Favoring Unwed Mothers" (Op-Ed, Jan. 16), Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute argues that impoverished single mothers should be faced with two choices on their child's birth: watch the child die of starvation or give the child up, to newly created state institutions in most cases.
He justifies this "social policy" on the ground that these mothers by definition are incompetent parents whose offspring (especially in inner cities) present grave social problems.

HOW in the world is the city where nobody walks going to cut air pollutants by 85 percent?
Not easily or cheaply: A ballpark estimate by the David Harrison and Albert Nichols of National Economic Research Associates in Cambridge puts the cost of meeting Federal standards at an astonishing $1,200 a year for every resident of the Los Angeles sprawl.
But many economists are convinced that the bill could be reduced sharply if the job of deciding who cuts emissions, and how, were left to markets rather than regulators.
And they are on the verge of convincing the California's South Coast Air Quality Management District to give it a try.

A fire broke out Sunday afternoon in the home of Carmel Cato, the father of Gavin Cato, a 7-year-old Brooklyn boy whose death in a car accident led to several days of racial violence in Crown Heights in August.
"There was heavy damage to the apartment," said Tom Kelley, a Fire Department spokesman.
Fire marshals investigated the blaze and determined it was accidental, he said.
The cause was tentatively believed to be children playing with matches.
At the time, the Fire Department said, there were about 20 people in the apartment, on the first floor of 1611 President Avenue.
The family was relocated by the Red Cross.

Negotiations on a multiyear contract for David Cone have reached a critical stage, and both the Mets and the pitcher's agent have said that a determination on whether an agreement can be reached is expected by the end of this week.

Review/Film; Under Scrutiny: TV Images Of Blacks
"Color Adjustment" is Marlon T. Riggs's cogent and thoughtful survey of black America as represented by American television, from the demeaning stereotypes of "Amos 'n' Andy" to the subtler, more insidious ones of "The Cosby Show." It is Mr.
Riggs's well-supported opinion that today's would-be positive images of prosperous, assimilated characters are every bit as damaging as the buffoonish images of the past.
Mr.
Riggs also documents television's continuing identity crisis as he contrasts the idealized black figures seen on sagas and sitcoms with the harsher, angrier ones provided by the news.
In a straightforward, informative manner, Mr.
Riggs elicits opinions from the stars and producers of landmark shows in black television history, pausing occasionally for a well-chosen observation from James Baldwin's writings.
Each of the shows discussed here emerges as a source of both pain and pride.
Diahann Carroll and Tim Reid, both of whom later starred in television series important to Mr.
Riggs's argument, discuss their changing reactions to "Amos 'n' Andy," the show about which the N.A.A.C.P. said "every character is either a clown or a crook." Ms.
Carroll says her family was adamant about not watching "Amos 'n' Andy," and only later could she see through the show's offensiveness and find its humor.

City College Chief to Seek Removal of Jeffries as Department Head
The president of City College, Dr.
Bernard W. Harleston, has told the trustees of the City University of New York that he will seek to remove Dr.
Leonard Jeffries Jr. as chairman of the college's Afro-American Studies Department by June.
The move reinforces an understanding reached three months ago by the City University board when the board reappointed Dr.
Jeffries to a limited eight-month term, instead of the usual three years.
At the time, Dr.
Harleston said publicly that he did not wish to recommend the removal of Dr.
Jeffries then out of fear of causing turmoil on campus.
Racially Charged Comments
Dr.
Jeffries caused a storm last summer by making racially charged comments at a black cultural festival.


A Fancy Food Store Now Stresses the Food Over the Fancy
LASH back to the old Dean &amp; DeLuca, one of the fanciest food stores in the world.
Fruits and vegetables were works of art.
Piled high in the front of the store, they were exotic, frightfully expensive and, for some people, inspirational.
In the new Dean &amp; DeLuca, fruits and vegetables are
food
.
They look good; they smell good; they are laid out neatly.
Despite the $2.95 pears from Japan and $5 melons from New Zealand, this is mostly food for everyday cooking: celery and potatoes; apples, oranges and pears.

Henry Burkhardt is scheming to ambush the computer industry.
His radically different supercomputer, intended for both scientific and commercial markets, has still not been formally introduced, although a handful of university and government research labs are putting prototypes through the paces of Big Science number crunching.
But in recent weeks, Mr.
Burkhardt's design has fired an emotional debate inside the usually clinically calm community of elite scientists and engineers who build the world's fastest computers.

Knicks Close to Championship Level But They Have a Long Way to Go
It took Dave Checketts one second to respond to this question: Is he happy the Knicks have reached the midway point of the season with a 26-15 record?
"You bet," the Knicks' president said.
"We're talking about a team that won 39 games last year. We knew going into the season that we weren't ready to compete for a championship yet, but this is the first year of a long-term process. I hate to disappoint people by saying that, and in New York expectations will always be high, but that's reality.

They were based on research by Asahi Journal in Tokyo and New Consumer, a nonprofit British organization based in Newcastle.

STATE OF THE UNION: Washington Memo; Darman on Outskirts of Inner Circle

New York Law on Auto Rentals Needs Easing
To the Editor:
The Hertz Corporation's lamentable decision effectively to withdraw from a large part of the New York City car-rental market by imposing steep surcharges (news article, Jan. 3) could have been prevented if the New York State Senate joined the Assembly in approving my bill to make a renter's automobile insurance policy or credit card-related policy primarily responsible for property damage.


Prominent Educators Oppose National Tests
Intensifying the debate over national tests for schoolchildren, more than 50 prominent educators and testing experts have released a statement opposing such examinations just as a major educational advisory panel has endorsed them.
Last Friday the advisory panel, the National Council on Education Standards and Testing, which is composed of both political and educational leaders, made public a final report calling for national curriculum standards and national tests as the best way to insure that all schools improve.
This would be a radical departure from the longstanding American tradition of local control of curriculums that has led to a patchwork of uneven course requirements, tests and school results.

THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Campaign; After Hoopla, a Repositioning, Not a Call to Arms
Billed for weeks by the White House as the kickoff to his re-election campaign, President Bush's State of the Union Message tonight was, by extension, also intended to begin his comeback from an astonishing tumble in the public opinion polls.
Despite the buildup though, there was little revolutionary in the speech.
It was more a careful attempt at repositioning, with Mr.

Market Place; Stock Prices As Measured By Inflation
JUST how high are stock prices?
By one measure, they are nearing, but have not yet reached, the level set more than 23 years ago, back when Richard M. Nixon was winning the Presidency and a subway token was 20 cents.
That measure of stock prices is adjusted for inflation, comparing the prices of stocks with the Consumer Price Index.
Rather than measure stock prices in dollars, as normal indexes do, that calculation measures them in the context of what other things cost.
The Consumer Price Index reflects the cost of a basket of items purchased by consumers; this measurement effectively shows how many such baskets an investor would need to give up to buy a representative sample of American stocks.

A 60-ish Murray Louis Still Dances (and Thinks)
In nearly four decades as a choreographer, Murray Louis has carved a substantial place for himself in American modern dance.
The company he runs with Alwin Nikolais opened a two-week engagement at the Joyce Theater last night.
While Mr.
Nikolais, who describes himself as an abstract expressionist, has enchanted generations of dancegoers as a theater magician of light and shape, Mr.
Louis fills the stage with antic, scribbling motion for himself and others.
A much-admired solo performer, Mr.
Louis has earned a reputation as an outspoken, sometimes controversial observer of the dance scene.
The subject of a new piece he has created for himself, one of four premieres in the season, is dancing itself.
And he finds himself thinking a lot these days about what it means to be a modern dancer in the economically difficult and artistically confusing 1990's.

Is Islamic Fundamentalism a New Red Scare?; The State of the Law

Muslim fundamentalists say no, and you seem to agree, provided the imposition of Islamic law in Algeria proves "wise, merciful and just."

Review/Film; Murderer Whose Chair Is Electric
"Guilty as Charged," which opens today at the Eighth Street Playhouse, tries very hard to satirize moral corruption and succeeds only in being a numbingly eccentric melodrama about lawlessness and disorder.
Kallin (Rod Steiger), a rich meat packer, has taken it upon himself to execute all convicted murderers who, as he sees it, deserve the capital punishment that the state does not allow.
Kallin has his own electric chair in which he dispatches his victims after a lot of sermonizing and a last supper, which may be either a Big Mac, fries and a chocolate shake or Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Now, with his National Islamic Front controlling the military Government here, Mr.
Turabi, as polished and, some would say, as beguiling as ever, is orchestrating a bigger goal: the spread of fundamentalism to the moderate Arab countries and the rest of Africa.

THE rush to create low-fat foods has sent food scientists scurrying to their beakers and Bunsen burners in search of fat substitutes.

Caprenin (pronounced ka-PREE-nin) is the most recent fat substitute to be heralded as the laboratory's answer to the battle of the bulge.
And the patent holders, the Procter &amp; Gamble Company, want you to know that because it is made up of ordinary food components, it is, unquestionably, safe.

Police Union Files Lawsuit Over Funds
The new leadership of the New York City Housing Authority police officers' union yesterday sued the union's former president, charging him with misappropriating $76,000 and with having a secret financial deal with a consultant who managed a $300,000 union welfare fund.
Timothy Nickels, who took over as president of the Housing Patrolmen's Benevolent Association on Jan. 1, made the allegations against his predecessor, Jack M. Jordan, who had been the head of the 1,800-member union for 16 years.


Shedding the C.I.A.'s Cloak
As the K.G.B. emerges from the shadows, the C.I.A. may also be starting to open up.
A task force established by the new Director of Central Intelligence, Robert Gates, recommends that he make officials and files more accessible and declassify long-held secrets.
The question remains, however: Will this be mere window-dressing?
The C.I.A. has always made selective disclosures to burnish its image, and Mr.
Gates has left the unfortunate impression that he intends to do more of the same.
At his confirmation hearings he spoke of "symbolic steps" to suggest a change in the agency's "cold war mentality" and to encourage "the people to have trust that the agency is playing by the rules."

Arcatao Journal; Rebel Villages Weary of War, but Wary of Peace
At first, Arcatao seemed empty or asleep, a setting waiting for the characters in a tropical novel to be introduced.
Then signs of life became evident: women baking bread in the dark interior of an adobe building, four women at sewing machines in another, and in a corner of the plaza a horse tethered to a post with men and boys gathered around.

Officer Shot, Boy Held, But Few Even Notice
The shot shattered Officer David Pitchon's ankle and landed 15-year-old Rasheem Smith in jail.
But perhaps the most remarkable thing about the sniping incident outside a school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn eight days ago was how unremarkable it seemed: an act that would have been unthinkable not too long ago drew barely a flicker of public attention and surprised almost no one, least of all the wounded officer himself.


Citicorp Offers Debentures
Activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted yesterday by new issues from big bank companies, including Citicorp's first public debt sale in the domestic market since November 1989.
The bank holding company offered $150 million worth of 10-year subordinated debentures through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.

Many of the men seemed slightly embarrassed.
The models seemed terrifically abashed.

STATE OF THE UNION: Unemployment; Accord on Extending Jobless Benefits
Agreeing to sidestep a bitter election-year issue, President Bush and House leaders decided today to spend $2.7 billion on another 13 weeks of unemployment benefits for about two million long-term jobless people.
Democrats in the Senate did not commit themselves to the plan immediately, but Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, said he was confident a bill could be sent to Mr.
Bush for signing "by the end of next week."


Sports of The Times; Approve The Seattle Nintendos
For those who think of baseball's 26 owners as the only members of a snobbish country club but could never prove it, proof is now available.
When a Seattle group, including the Japanese son-in-law of the owner of the Nintendo video-game empire, announced its intention to buy the Seattle Mariners in order to prevent the franchise from being relocated to St.
Petersburg, Fla., the baseball hierarchy blanched.


Senate Approves Bill to Improve Schools
After scuttling the heart of President Bush's school program, the Senate today overwhelmingly passed an $850 million Democratic education bill that would channel money to schools in poor communities and schools trying experimental improvements.
Even supporters of the bill say its financing, the equivalent of what it takes to build one B-2 Stealth bomber, is insufficient to improve the performance of most American schools.
But the bill is intended to set new national goals to improve teacher performance, increase graduation rates and expand student access to training in science and mathematics.


BUSINESS DIGEST
The Economy
President Bush staked his political fortunes on predictions that the economy will right itself by summer, delivering a State of the Union Message that offered modest proposals to ease the immediate pain of middle-class taxpayers.  [ Page A1. ]  The President proposed little new to strengthen the economy in the long term, many economists said.  [ A1. ]  Bush and House leaders decided to spend $2.7 billion on 13 more weeks of unemployment benefits for about two million long-term jobless people.  [ A18. ]
Americans became more pessimistic about their financial and job security despite lower interest rates, a survey showed.  [ D6. ]


Europe Venture Plans Nutrasweet Challenge
After years of battling the Nutra sweet Company in Europe and Canada, the Holland Sweetener Company is gearing up to take on Nutrasweet in the United States, the world's largest market for the no-calorie sweetener.
Holland Sweetener, a joint venture of two huge chemical companies -- DSM N.V. of the Netherlands and the Tosoh Corporation of Japan -- announced yesterday that it planned to greatly expand its factory in the Netherlands that makes aspartame, the artificial sweetner, with the aim of exporting to the United States.


Bias Unit Reviewing a Letter to Dinkins
Mayor David N. Dinkins has received a letter that includes racist slurs and threats against him and his family, and the police have classified the correspondence as a bias incident, the police said yesterday.
The bias unit is investigating.
The Mayor has received hundreds of such letters since the beginning of his term.
But the contents of the letter, which was opened at City Hall on Monday morning, demanded special attention, the police said.
The contents of the rambling three-page letter were not made public.


Theater in Review
The Home Show Pieces  Public/Martinson Theater 425 Lafayette Street Manhattan Through Feb. 16  Written and directed by David Greenspan; set by William Kennon; costumes by Elsa Ward; lighting by David Bergstein.
Presented by the New York Shakespeare Festival, Joseph Papp, founder; JoAnne Akalaitis, artistic director; Jason Steven Cohen, producing director; Rosemarie Tichler, associate artistic director.
WITH: Ron Bagden, Tracey Ellis and David Greenspan.
Before he became a director at the New York Shakespeare Festival and began staging his own maladroit deconstructions of classics ("The Way of the World"), David Greenspan was the author of plays like "2 Samuel II, Etc.," a provocative and highly personalized re-evaluation of the story of David and Bathsheba.
In "The Home Show Pieces," a revival of four one-act plays presented several years ago at the Home for Contemporary Theater and Art, Mr.
Greenspan is once again in his autobiographical mode, but with diminished dramatic returns.


Here, Immigrants' Past Is Saved for the Future
No one knew exactly what was inside the four large boxes that had come from Los Angeles, but they were treated like treasures.
Each was a foot high and a foot wide and covered with gray duct tape that had been carefully wound several times around to keep safe the secrets inside.
Opened, the boxes revealed a collection of old books, newspapers and manuscripts from a Ukrainian immigrant community in California.
Such deliveries are made regularly to the small industrial building just off Ellis Avenue here that houses the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota.

Seles Still Hitting Out
MONICA SELES, coming off her victory in the Australian Open last week, responded yesterday to comments that were critical of her game.
MARY JOE FERNANDEZ, whom Seles beat, 6-2, 6-3, for the Australian title, said it was a mistake that the No. 1-ranked Seles was not adding different looks to her powerful baseline game.
Appearing at an autograph-signing session at the opening of a Fila boutique in Manhattan, Seles said, "Definitely, I'm learning to come to the net more often. You've got to keep improving. Everyone wants the the No. 1 spot. You can't sleep on the No. 1 spot."


Man Killed and 15 Hurt in Car-Van Crash
A man was killed and 15 people were injured yesterday when a car hit a van carrying 13 mentally retarded adults in Setauket, L. I.
The van was carrying its passengers from the Anita Smith Day Care Treatment Center to their home at the Family Residence and Essential Enterprises when it made a left turn onto Route 347 and collided with the car, the Suffolk County Police said.
One of the van's occupants was thrown from the vehicle and died of his injuries at University Hospital in Stony Brook, a hospital spokeswoman, Maxine Simpson, said.
Officials did not release the name of the man or the victims injured in the 3:30 P.M. crash.

Dow Climbs by 31.53, to a Record 3,272.14
Blue-chip stocks resumed their record setting in heavy trading yesterday, while the broader market ended the day just about where it began.
The Dow Jones industrial average, after taking an 11-day break following a string of records earlier this month, once again climbed to new heights, gaining 31.53 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 3,272.14.
A large part of the strength came from just 2 of the 30 companies that make up the Dow: Walt Disney and Procter &amp; Gamble.

When CBS's "60 Minutes" talks, people listen.

If You Don't Taste as You Cook, None of the Below Will Help
THE vegetable soup had been cooking for two days, but it was still missing something.
The doorbell was ringing.
People were moving toward the kitchen.
I begged a friend who happens to be a chef to do something.
He tasted, and without hesitation began pouring in balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce.
The soup was suddenly better.
Chefs may run on a mix of instinct, guts, talent and training, but they do know certain tricks: some make the cooking process easier; some result in more sophisticated food.


Study Faults Trade Count
The United States undercounts its exports and the nation may be more competitive globally than Commerce Department trade figures show, according to a study issued today by the National Research Council.
The chairman of the panel that conducted the study, Robert Baldwin, said the official United States trade deficit for 1987 was $148 billion, but research estimated the actual shortfall was $64 billion.

Man and Woman Die in Brooklyn Shootings
A man and a woman were shot to death in separate incidents in Brooklyn last night, the police said.
In both cases, the killers escaped.
In one shooting, the owner of a bodega at Dean and Saratoga Streets in Brownsville was killed by two men who robbed his store of $500 in cash.
The victim, whom police identified as Taher Abdallah of 363 Howard Avenue in Brownsville, had apparently given the robbers the money without resistance.
But as they were walking out of the store, one turned and shot Mr.
Abdallah once in the head, said Officer Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman.


11 Neo-Nazis Arrested in South Africa
The South African police arrested almost the entire leadership of a far-right white organization early today.
Although the 11 officers of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement who were seized in the raids were released on bond after a few hours, their arrest marked the most aggressive action taken against the militant organization that has sought to generate defiance against the Government's efforts to dismantle apartheid and negotiate with blacks on a new Constitutional arrangement.

The new edition is intended to carry a limited amount of advertising, said Laura Morgan, a Times spokeswoman.

U.S., Its Haiti Blockade Failing, Studies Other Means to End Crisis
United States diplomats said today that they were considering a range of new steps to bring stability to Haiti as indications grow that an international embargo is failing to promote a political settlement there and may instead be fueling an exodus of desperate refugees by boat.
Diplomats say that while no action is imminent, some type of military action might be necessary, although force is still seen as a last resort, a step fraught with daunting complications and discouraging historical precedent.


Israel Warned Again on Loans
Leaders of an American Jewish group have stirred controversy among some Israelis by advising Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that he cannot expect housing-loan guarantees from Washington if he continues to settle Jews in the occupied territories.
Their comments have added to an emotional debate here over reported conditions set by the Bush Administration linking its agreement to guarantee $10 billion in loans to a curtailment of settlement-building in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The money is to be used to build homes and expand Israel's job market to cope with the influx of hundreds of thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union.


Yeltsin Makes a Surprise Visit to the Black Sea Fleet
Reappearing in public as abruptly as he disappeared, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia made an unexpected visit to the disputed Black Sea Fleet today, mounting the cruiser Moskva in an evident demonstration of Russia's concern for and claim to the former Soviet Navy.
Mr.
Yeltsin visited the fleet at Novorossisk, Russia's only major port on the Black Sea since the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the Crimea and much of the sea's north shore under Ukrainian jurisdiction, and the eastern shore in Georgia's.


Business Technology; Programmers May Benefit From Thinking the Old Way
Today's conventional single-processor computers generally execute one instruction at a time and can carry out a mathematical operation on only two pieces of data at once.
In contrast, parallel computers can carry out thousands of simultaneous mathematical operations.
Typically, though, massively parallel computers have placed special demands on the people who write programs for them.
Programmers have been forced to think about where each piece of data lies and have frequently needed to make manual adjustments to exploit the power of the machines fully.

To the Editor:
Customers at New York City's Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority facilities are not limited to purchasing a single roll of nine discounted tokens as Josh Stern writes (letter, Dec. 20).
At any of our facilities, you may buy for $42 two nine-pack rolls of tokens, one loose token and the toll passage you are making.
We began selling tokens in smaller rolls when a survey showed more customers would use them.
This increased discount token sales nearly 20 percent.
To respond to Avrum Hyman (letter, Jan. 10), we are always looking for ways to improve traffic flow at our toll plazas.
Our goal is to make toll processing as fast and convenient as possible, especially in the morning and evening commuting periods.


Nationsbank Presses Bank Trade Groups
While many bankers are weary and bruised from last year's unsuccessful effort to revise Federal banking law so that banks could open branches across state lines, Hugh McColl, chairman of Nationsbank, Charlotte, N.C., is itching to renew the battle.
In a sharply worded letter to the 13 bank trade groups to which Nationsbank belongs, Mr.
McColl threatened to drop Nationsbank's membership in those groups that do not unequivacally support Nationsbank's desire to operate branches across state lines.

President Bush is to meet Prime Minister Li Peng of China in New York on Friday, the White House announced today.

Hundreds of others remain in prison.


The Federal Budget: Budget as Bush Campaign Manifesto; Bottom-Line: A Hands-Off Government
The budget that President Bush sent Congress today is essentially his campaign manifesto, and it delineates how starkly his views differ from those of his Democratic opponents, in Congress and on the campaign trail.
With minor exceptions, the new budget underscores Mr.
Bush's intention of maintaining the same course the country has been on for the last dozen years, one in which the Government uses tax and spending policy as little as possible to guide the nation's economic affairs.


California Proposal Would Let Industry Sell Pollution Rights
Southern California's air-quality regulators said today that they planned a radical new approach to controlling air pollution, allowing companies to purchase the right to pollute if they could not or chose not to reduce emissions on their own.
The new approach, which is still subject to formal approval, would supplant the current system of tight company-by-company regulation and would be the largest and most ambitious attempt yet to clean up the air by replacing regulatory fiat with free-market forces.

Willie Dixon, Musician, 76, Dies; Singer and Writer of Classic Blues
Willie Dixon, who wrote blues standards and produced many classic blues albums, died of heart failure yesterday at St.
Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, Calif.
He was 76 years old and lived in southern California.
As a songwriter, producer, arranger and bassist, Mr.
Dixon was a towering figure in the creation of Chicago blues, which was in turn a cornerstone of rock-and-roll.
His songs were performed by leading blues figures, including Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, and picked up by rock bands including the Rolling Stones, Cream and the Doors.
The lusty imagery, laconic humor and hints of mysterious ritual in his best songs made them sound like age-old folk poems.


BRITISH CHIEF SET FOR A CLOSE VOTE
Like President Bush, with whom he will have dinner in New York on Thursday night, Prime Minister John Major of Britain has to face an election this year in almost the worst possible economic circumstances: a recession whose end is not yet in sight.
Times have changed since the Conservatives threw over Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the opposition Labor Party abandoned the radical left-wing policy positions of the early 1980's.
For the first time since then, because of the economic mess, it does not seem like a foregone conclusion that Mr.
Major and his party will win the next election.

Firefighter Plucks Injured Man From Tank
A firefighter who was not too big and not too small, but just right, wriggled through a narrow opening into a fuel oil tank in a Bronx apartment building yesterday morning and rescued an unconscious and slippery man, fire officials said.
The man, Carton Gray, an employee of ABC Tank Cleaning Company in Brooklyn, had climbed into the 3,000-gallon tank in the basement of the building, at 4585 Park Avenue, near 183d Street in the Fordham section, to clean it.
He was overwhelmed by carbon monoxide and fumes given off by sludge at the tank's bottom, fire officials said.


Fishing for Tourists By the Musconetcong
The biggest fish story in New Jersey is not about the apocryphal whopper that got away, but about the big one that has yet to bite.
And while the story still has no ending, its beginning will probably be here in Warren County, in a picturesque trout run called the Musconetcong River.
In its waters just north of this colonial-era village, the State of New Jersey would like to release 300,000 young chinook salmon each year for five years to see if enough of them survive to start a multimillion-dollar sport fishing industry.


In a World of Symbols, One Brings Confusion
WE live in an age of icon overload.
The profusion of symbols is everywhere: in ever-obliging male silhouettes that indicate the location of the nearest trash receptacle, and in magazine articles that end in a flourish with a little square.
Look no further than the local supermarket.
The mere act of buying a soft drink has become a semiotic exercise.
What may interest cryptographers in years to come will be these hieroglyphics: the kosher food symbol, the swirling Nutrasweet symbol, the five rings of the Olympic Games, the revolving-arrow recycling symbols and those little checkout bar codes.


Yugoslav Republic Expects Recognition Soon
For Kiro Gligorov, the President of Macedonia, "it is a matter of time" -- soon, he believes -- until his republic receives broad international recognition.
Formerly a part of the six-member Yugoslav Communist federation, Macedonia was something of an odd man out as civil war swept the northern republics last year.
While it managed to avoid the fighting, Macedonia continued to feel especially vulnerable to external pressures, bordered as it is by Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece and Albania and with a sizable population of minorities.

Triumph to Tragedy In a Year for Penguins
Now that they have dropped to a shaky third place in the six-team Patrick Division and to eighth over all in the 22-team National Hockey League, it is tempting to dismiss the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins as one-year wonders returning to the mediocrity that marked their first quarter-century.
Such a demise would be a shame, especially if history overlooks or under appreciates their saga of the last 12 months.
In that span, this star-studded and star-crossed team has been the most compelling success story in professional sports.
For drama and trauma, pathos and bathos, no other team comes close.
Maybe no team would want to.

Gift of Dymaxion House
IN the late 1940's, 30,000 people wanted to buy R. Buckminster Fuller's round Dymaxion House, which was made of aluminum and Plexiglas, assembled in a factory, weighed only 6,000 pounds and was designed to be disassembled, tucked into a cylinder and air-freighted anywhere in the world.
But only two prototypes were made, and William L. Graham, an entrepreneur from Wichita, Kan., bought both.
Last week, Mr.
Graham's family announced the donation of the prototypes to the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Mich.
Mr.
Graham's family occupied one of the houses (plus an addition) from 1948 to 1972.
It will be disassembled this year and moved to the museum, where it will join the 80 buildings of Greenfield Village.
The other prototype was never assembled but held in reserve for spare parts.

His promotion is part of a management restructuring by the parent company, Pacificorp, to pave a smooth transition for the utility, which is trying to reduce costs and keep power prices low.

Westinghouse Dividend Cut Because of Losses
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation slashed its quarterly dividend to 18 cents a share from 35 cents yesterday and announced accounting changes that were expected to reduce first-quarter earnings by about $300 million, or 88 cents a share.
The dividend cut was widely expected because of the huge losses that Westinghouse suffered last year on real estate and junk-bond investments made by its financial-services subsidiary.
Those investments cost Westinghouse more than $1.68 billion in the third quarter and led to the layoffs of 4,000 workers as top management tried to cut costs.
Losses in the Westinghouse Credit subsidiary caused the parent company to lose $1.09 billion last year.

Unless a second shoe (or bedroom slipper) drops to indicate he's a liar, his national exposure during his troubles has helped establish him more clearly as the Democrats' front-runner and likely nominee.
Now he faces a real challenge: to move beyond poll-driven boiler plate to presentation of a strong, relevant agenda that will genuinely address the country's problems and give voters a real reason to elect him.


Bethlehem Halts Dividends And Plans Cuts After Loss
The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, after reporting a loss of $638.1 million for the fourth quarter, said yesterday that it would cut its work force by 6,500 and stop paying its annual stock dividend.

The reductions will be made over the next two years through layoffs, early retirement programs and sales of parts of the company.


A Miniaturist of the Novel Who Finds Phones Erotic
"Vox" is the sound of two voices rubbing together and generating heat.
Random House, its publisher, is calling it "the breakthrough erotic novel of our time." To drive the point home, the publisher sent out advance copies of the book, a conversation between two strangers on a sex telephone line, in a plain brown wrapper.
Nicholson Baker, the book's mild-mannered, implausible-looking author, reached way out in left field to pull in the precise word for what goes on between his two characters: "interfingering."
"It's a geologic term my wife taught me," he said during a recent interview at his publisher's offices in midtown Manhattan.
"It's what happens when two layers of rock strata come together."

The State Office of Mental Health today proposed shutting down or sharply reducing the number of patients at half of its 22 psychiatric hospitals, a move that would save millions of dollars over the next decade but would shift the burden of caring for the mentally ill to scarce community programs.
The proposals immediately caused an uproar in the districts where the hospitals are located and set the stage for what is sure to be a tense fight over which ones would eventually be closed.
Like Congressmen fighting to save their local military bases from closing, state legislators representing the affected districts said their communities would be shattered by the loss of money and jobs the hospitals provide.

U.S. Oilmen See Russia's Pitfalls
More than 60 American oil industry executives who came here seeking ways to invest in Russia's oil industry ran into a raft of obstacles this week.
An essential obstacle lay in the struggle over control of the republic's crude oil.
Another was the absence of some important people who were supposed to be there.
Yet another was the lack of stable policies to govern foreign investments in oil, which Russian officials acknowledged might be difficult to achieve.

Our Place in the Western Community
To the Editor:
I don't believe you go far enough in "American Abdication in Europe" (editorial, Jan. 11).
It's not merely domination of Europe by Germany we have to worry about, but also our own position in the world.
By the end of the century, Europe will be united.
Even a reluctant Britain will have joined the European Community, which will expand to include the balance of the Western European countries and Eastern Europe as well.
Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, has already asked for admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the World Bank.
In a few years, Russia and the other commonwealth nations will be in both, probably also in the E.C., creating a European market stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with close to a billion bright, industrious people, as inventive as we and richer in natural resources, especially with a developed Russian oil industry.

In the midst of the controversy over the silicone gel-filled breast implant, it is unfortunate that so little mention has been made of a frequently used, harmless and superior alternative -- the saline-filled breast implant.

It is the same solution that is commonly given intravenously.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media; In Manchester, the Charge Is Mellow Journalism
So far this campaign, all the Presidential candidates have resisted the traditional temptation to stand outside The Union Leader building and denounce its publisher as an irresponsible liar.
But the state's largest and most opinionated newspaper has had to confront even more troubling charges.
They were summarized in The Boston Globe's recent headline: "Mellowed Union Leader loses some influence on primary."
At The Union Leader they are not sure which is more repugant -- losing influence or becoming mellow -- and the paper has moved quickly to dispel both notions.
It is running advertisements that compare its circulation with The Globe's in New Hampshire (99,000 versus 61,000 on Sundays, 72,000 versus 30,000 daily) and conclude, "The Globe is right to be worried about influence."

A RENEWED wave of harsh attacks on Japanese cars and trucks is inundating television and newspapers, as sort of the evil twin of the automotive industry's "Buy American" advertising.
Many of these new passionate, possibly xenophobic pitches seem the automotive equivalent of negative political advertising.

His hope was to prove that experts playing natural methods can do just as well as those armed with scientific bidding weapons.

Russian Offers Americans Access to K.G.B. Files
The chairman of the Russian parliamentary commission that oversees the archives of the K.G.B. says he is prepared to invite American historians to search for evidence that could shed light on the fate of Americans taken prisoner during the Vietnam war.
The official, Col.
Gen.
Dmitri Volkogonov, speaking on the eve of President Boris N. Yeltsin's trip to the United States, said the Russian president wanted to assure the United States Senate that he was responding to a request for information on reports that some Americans might have been taken to the Soviet Union.

Rod Stewart  Madison Square Garden
On Monday night, Rod Stewart turned Madison Square Garden into a commercial for his greatest hits.
The setting was a two-tiered spotless white stage with invisible doors through which backing musicians came and left like doctors entering and exiting hospital rooms.
Everything was Conran's white, even the speakers, drums and Mr.
Stewart's cordless microphone.
The costuming was a set of suits in an interior designer's palette of bright hues.
There were backup singers who did Motown synchronized dance moves and horn players who struck silhouette-worthy poses.
There were two giant screens that showed stills from the previous number in between songs, like instant snapshot memories.
There was a corporate sponsor, Miller Genuine Draft.


A Tiny Gain For Economy Last Quarter
The nation's economy all but came to a standstill in the final quarter of 1991 after two quarters of small advances, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
Neither fears of renewed recession nor the Administration's hopes of early recovery were confirmed by the report.
"Economic activity was essentially flat in the fourth quarter," said J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief economist.


Tyson Judge Bars Motion On Evidence
Lawyers for Mike Tyson have charged that important evidence in the fighter's trial here -- the clothing worn by his accuser at the time she says she was raped by him -- has been "materially altered from the condition that it was in on the night in question."
The charge is contained in a motion that was filed under seal, but made public today when Judge Patricia J. Gifford refused to bar the prosecution from showing the clothing to the jury.

Sordid Business Booms in Queens
Roosevelt Avenue by day is a whirl of traffic and shoppers, to the roar and clatter of the I.R.T. passing overhead.
Nightfall brings traffic and trade of another sort.
As steerers walk the avenue openly soliciting clients, men emerge from cars, cabs and the subway and ascend to the low-rent, low-price brothel world that flourishes overhead.
There, women -- many of them undocumented immigrants -- do business in warrens of sordid cubicles behind second-story windows painted black.


Nynex Runs Into The Richmeister
This is how Richard (The Richmeister) Laymer, the annoying guardian of the copying machine on NBC's "Saturday Night Live," might describe his recent contretemps with the advertising industry: "It's the admeisters! The Saatch-skis and their client, the Nynex man! A commercialmundo. Bad scene! Bad scene!"
Translated into English, that means Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, New York, produced a 60-second radio spot for a new client, Nynex Mobile Communications, in a style that many listeners said sounded like the Laymer character, a creation of the comedian Rob Schneider.
After Mr.
Schneider called to complain, the company pulled the spot.


Coverage of Smoking Linked to Tobacco Ads
A new report by researchers at the University of Michigan says that magazines that carry cigarette advertising have consistently restricted or softened coverage of the dangers of smoking, possibly out of fear of economic reprisals by cigarette manufacturers.
The study, which appears in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, examined 99 American magazines published from 1959 to 1986.
Although other reports have offered anecdotal evidence about the relationship between cigarette advertising and the coverage of tobacco as a health issue, the new report is one of the most comprehensive statistical looks at the subject.


Violent Melodrama Of a Sizzling Movie Brings Rating Battle
For the handful of studio executives who have seen it, "Basic Instinct," a violent melodrama starring Michael Douglas that is set to open in March, is "a guaranteed blockbuster," "the steamiest movie of the year" and "hot, hot, hot."
For the Motion Picture Association of America's Classification Board, the movie is, one film executive said, "beyond boundaries" and may receive an unusual and financially risky NC-17 rating (No one under 17 admitted).
For the Carolco Corporation, which is teetering on the edge of collapse, the movie is either a lifeline from drowning or a lead weight that will sink the company.
For the Sony Corporation, whose Tri-Star Pictures is distributing it, the movie is one more potential headache after a year of financial migraines.
And for gay-rights groups the movie is a source of alarm.

Howe Faces Delay
STEVE HOWE, the Yankee relief pitcher arrested last month on charges of possession of cocaine, faces yet another legal delay in being brought to trial.
An arraignment hearing scheduled for Friday in Missoula, Mont., has been rescheduled for Feb. 7.
The 33-year-old Howe, who lives in Whitefish, Mont., with his family during baseball's off season, is being charged with two Federal misdemeanor counts: attempted possession of a gram of cocaine when he was arrested Dec. 19 in nearby Kalispell, and possession of two grams of cocaine in Whitefish sometime between Nov. 23 and Dec. 19.


Judge Gives Maximum Term in Kahane Case
Sharply criticizing a jury's acquittal on murder charges, a Manhattan judge sentenced an Egyptian immigrant to the maximum sentence of 7 1/3 to 22 years in prison yesterday for gun possession, assault and coercion charges arising from the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane.
As hundreds of police officers kept chanting Arabs away from Jewish sympathizers outside the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, State Supreme Court Justice Alvin Schlesinger said the jury's decision to acquit the immigrant, El Sayyid A. Nosair, of murder last month "was against the overwhelming weight of evidence and was devoid of common sense and logic."

BUSH AND YELTSIN PROPOSE DEEP CUTS IN ATOMIC WEAPONS
President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin made new arms control proposals this week that envision slashing American and Russian long-range nuclear arms by well over half and could eliminate the class of missiles considered the biggest threat to peace.
But Mr.
Bush's proposal, outlined in the State of the Union Address on Tuesday, asks Mr.
Yeltsin to take a step that no Soviet leader ever entertained: give up his advantage in one area of nuclear arms competition, land-based missiles, in return for an important concession but not parallel cuts in the area of American advantage, submarine-based missiles.

McDonald's Profit Up 8% In Quarter
The McDonald's Corporation said yesterday that profits increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter as it benefited from discount pricing in the United States and healthy sales overseas.
McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant operator, said fourth-quarter profits increased to a quarterly record for the company of $200 million, compared with $186 million for the corresponding quarter last year.
Earnings per share were 54 cents for the quarter, compared with 51 cents a share a year earlier.
Revenues rose to $1.73 billion from $1.70 billion.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats; Struggling to Be Heard, Kerrey Pounces on Clinton
In most sports, when the front-runner stumbles, his competitors gain a clear opportunity.
In politics, however, it is trickier.
Because when the front-runner stumbles, he takes all the television cameras with him.
This is the awkward situation now facing Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
For the last several days, he has been trying to draw Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas into a public debate on issues like health care and the environment.
But as Mr.
Clinton's campaign suffered under accusations that the Governor had carried on a 12-year extramarital affair, he ignored the gibes, and Mr.
Kerrey's campaign suffered even more -- from lack of exposure.

But both, in a sense, are victims and survivors of sociopaths who have had the humanity stomped out of them, of a society that often sends such confusing messages that morality and ethics, the sense of right and wrong, are the first but not the last casualties.

Deal Maker a Torchbearer? Trump Wants Olympics Here
Donald Trump once rebuilt the skating rink in Central Park in four months.
His latest dream is to bring the Summer Olympics to New York in the year 2004.
But it may be easier to get a casino permit in New Jersey than to convince the United States Olympic Committee that the Big Apple could manage the feat.
The city was turned down for the 1984 Games (awarded to Los Angeles) despite the efforts of a committee headed by a former city official and businessman, Richard Ravitch.


Iran to Sell Draft Exemptions
The Iranian Parliament authorized the Government today to sell draft exemption cards for $5,000 apiece, the Teheran radio said.
Two years of military service is compulsory for Iranian men over 18, and fear of conscription has discouraged thousands abroad from returning home.
The radio report, monitored in Cyprus, did not say how much was expected to be raised by the plan, which was authorized during a debate on a budget bill.
The report said the cards would be temporary but did not make clear how long they would be valid.


For Older Skiers, the More the Merrier on the Slopes
For a number of seasons, ski areas have sold discounted lift tickets to skiers 65 years old and over.
These "junior" tickets usually cost the same as those sold to youngsters 12 and under.

"Last season, we asked senior skiers to fill out questionnaires to find out what they wanted," said Gwen Allard, who is the head of the instructors' educational committee.
"They have different social and physiological needs, so we developed a format to meet those needs."

Next month Paramount will release "Papa's Delicate Condition" (1963), starring Jackie Gleason.
"Dances With Wolves" it isn't, but dealers are moderately enthusiastic.
"There are a lot of Jackie Gleason fans out there," said James Ulsamer, a senior vice president of Baker &amp; Taylor, a distributor in Chicago.
In general, old movies at low prices are getting more attention at Hollywood studios and in many video stores.
"Papa's Delicate Condition," for example, is one of 100 older titles -- from "Black Rain" (1989) with Michael Douglas to "Casanova's Big Night" (1954) with Bob Hope -- that will be released or rereleased this year by Paramount at reduced prices that generally range from $14.95 to $29.95.


Brooklyn Mother Saves Her Son, But Is Killed by a Hail of Bullets
A 36-year-old woman who had just picked up her 6-year-old son at his grandmother's house in Brooklyn was killed Tuesday night in a hail of bullets as she and her child sat in a car, the police said.
The victim, Avanelle Connell, spent her last moments trying to save the child's life as about nine of the more than a dozen bullets fired sprayed against the car moments after she and her son had entered it.


Dow Drops 47.18, to 3,224.96, After Remarks by Greenspan
Stock prices swung in a wide arc yesterday, ending with a sizable drop on fading hopes of further interest-rate cuts.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which posted solid gains earlier in the day, plunged after remarks on the economy by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
The Dow ended the day at 3,224.96, down 47.18 points, or nearly 1.5 percent.
But that was 74 points shy of the day's high, the biggest one-day spread since a 120-point swing on Nov. 15, 1990, when the market unraveled during a period when futures and options were expiring.


Review/Theater: Boesman and Lena; Fugard's Sad Wanderers, With Intimations of Now
Whether or not you get to the Manhattan Theater Club's revival of "Boesman and Lena," you can always see another, informal version of its drama day or night on a Manhattan sidewalk or subway platform or vacant lot.
Athol Fugard's image of an itinerant homeless couple sheltered within their scrap-heap possessions and awaiting the next official eviction is now as common in New York City, among other places, as it was in the South Africa where he set and wrote his play in the late 1960's.
Even at the time of its premiere, "Boesman and Lena" was recognized as a universal work that might speak to audiences long after apartheid had collapsed.
But who would have imagined that the universality would soon prove so uncomfortably literal?
The troublesome thing about the Manhattan Theater Club production, which Mr.
Fugard himself has directed with Keith David and Lynne Thigpen in the title roles, is that it is less searing than the version playing outside the theater.
The problem is not that real life has rendered "Boesman and Lena" redundant, for, as written, Mr.
Fugard's play can never be outstripped by events.
Boesman and Lena, a "colored" couple adrift from both blacks and whites in their own society, are more than a journalistic paradigm of homelessness or of South African racist oppression.
Their shared life, alternately a refuge and a brutal prison, is above all a marriage, observed by the author at a microscopic range Strindberg might have admired and as elemental and timeless as the primitive campsite where the play's single evening of action takes place.

Remembering an Embodiment of Small-Town Life
There is an emptiness lately in this waterside village steeped in its own past, where the trim 18th-century cottages seem plucked from the pages of a storybook and where immortality, at least in the architectural sense, does seem possible.
It is all because of one resident, James L. Grote, who died this month after living here for almost 101 years.
A man blessed with a booming voice and a seemingly unquenchable thirst for public life, Mr.
Grote became a municipal one-man band, holding an array of official and unofficial positions that ranged from fire chief -- a job he retained for almost half a century -- to front-row worshiper at the local Catholic church.


Review/Dance; Twyla Tharp's New Company Makes Debut
Twyla Tharp and Dancers is the name of the ever-surprising Miss Tharp's latest venture.
Not a permanent company by the choreographer's account but a group formed last summer as a current creative outlet, this heterogeneous collection of dancers -- mostly extraordinary -- opened a two-week debut season at the City Center on Tuesday night.
Miss Tharp is nothing if not timely.
Gov.
Bill Clinton's wife, Hillary, had barely apologized to Tammy Wynette for a disparaging reference to the country singer's hit "Stand By Your Man" than the recording was heard that night full blast at the center of "Men's Piece," Miss Tharp's rather more detached treatise on male-female relations.

Sports of The Times; The Return of Knicks' G.O. Card

Half a century ago at the old Garden on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets you showed your G.O. card, slid 25 cents to the ticket seller and hurried up several steep flights of stairs to the side balcony to watch the now legendary Ranger team that had won the Stanley Cup in 1940.


Hoyas Add to Redmen's Misery
The bold red letters on Jason Buchanan's chest had that shiny look of a brand new T-shirt.
MAKE IT HAPPEN, the shirt said.
That was the message St.
John's brought into the Capital Centre tonight, a renewed push against Georgetown with a season waiting to be saved.
But for the Redmen, nearly everything that happened just left them with more questions in an increasingly confusing season.
Their 61-48 loss to Georgetown, the third in three games and fourth in the last five, extended the worst start of a Big East season since the current seniors were freshmen.
With one major difference.
The 1989 season was regarded from its beginning as a transition year.
This St.
John's season began with the hope of a Final Four appearance, a dream that becomes less likely with each passing game. 4-5 in the Big East
St.
John's, 10-7 over all, fell to 4-5 in Big East play for the first time since the 1989 season that ended with a seventh-place finish.
Georgetown, 12-4 and 5-2 in the conference, won its third straight game and the fifth in the last seven.

"The Labor Party asked to approve it tomorrow," she said, "but I would say almost certainly there is agreement."


Florio's Whirlwind Makes Paramus 'Capital for a Day'
Gov.
Jim Florio moved the state capital here for a few hours today in an exercise that was part civics lesson and part political road show.
After declaring the borough New Jersey's first "Capital for a Day," the Governor and members of his cabinet fanned out around to meet with officials and community leaders; visit hospitals, a veterans home, a nutrition center for the elderly and the town jail, watch police officers rappel down a five-story building at the Garden State Plaza and drop off a $110,000 check for local road improvements before meeting with residents at a town meeting.


2 Officers Hurt in Queens
Two police officers were slightly injured late last night while investigating a dispute in Queens that erupted into gunfire, the police said.
A police spokeswoman said the officers were in front of 32-30 30th Street in Long Island City when shots were fired.
One officer was hit in the left foot by a ricochet, and his partner was cut on the right hip.
The police said Juan Velancia, 23 years old, of the 30th Street address, was arrested.
Neither officer was identified.

THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Politial Memo; Clinton Sets Off Spark, And Cuomo Fans Flame
Already troubled by allegations of marital infidelity, Gov.
Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign now faces mounting difficulties in New York -- and perhaps beyond -- because of an ethnic remark he made about Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo.
And, political strategists agree, Mr.
Cuomo has reacted with a bit of hardball politics that seemed designed to extract a heavy political price from the Arkansas Governor.
Mr.
Cuomo, who has a history of political differences with Mr.
Clinton, spent much of Tuesday transforming Mr.
Clinton's comment that Mr.
Cuomo "acts like" a member of the Mafia into an assault on all ethnic minorities.
He was not placated by Mr.
Clinton's apology, and made his displeasure known not only in a news conference in Albany but also in telephone interviews with a number of reporters.


U.S.S. Kentucky Journal; Run Silent, Run Deep, Beat Foes. (Where?)
The cold war is over and the Soviet Union has disintegrated, but Capt.
Mike Riegel and his crew still lurk in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean daily rehearsing a nuclear attack on the former superpower.
As the rest of the world adjusts to momentous changes, it is business as usual underwater for the men on the Navy's newest Trident II ballistic-missile submarine.
The actions and thoughts of the crew, as though suspended in time, remain riveted to a drill -- and a world -- that seems obsolete.
Within 30 minutes of receiving a coded order from the President, their mission would be to launch 24 missiles carrying as many as 192 warheads at preassigned military targets thousands of miles away.


Macy Getting Welcome Cash
With only $200,000 in cash on hand, R. H. Macy &amp; Company received some welcome interim financing yesterday.
The judge overseeing Macy's bankruptcy proceedings yesterday approved $60 million that the retailer will use to pay for merchandise and for daily operations until Feb. 13.


Big Selloff in Treasury Securities
Remarks by the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, took precedence over other important developments yesterday, and a violent selloff in the secondary market for Treasury securities ensued after Mr.
Greenspan said an economic recovery appeared likely in the spring.
Mr.
Greenspan made his forecast in confirmation testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
His remarks wiped out what had been a positive early response in the credit markets to President Bush's State of the Union address and a preliminary report from the Commerce Department showing that the economy expanded only three-tenths of a percent during the final quarter of 1991.

Big Time Sarah  Chicago Blues 73 Eighth Avenue (between 13th and 14th Streets) Through Saturday
There were plenty of men in the audience, but Big Time Sarah's performance at Chicago Blues on Tuesday night really belonged to the women.
Wearing a tight black jumper that celebrated every line in her ample figure, a gold incisor flicking shards of light into the club's farthest depths, this Chicago belter and growler played a set that brought together 70's funk, 60's soul and the raunchy urban blues of 1920's heroines like Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey.
"I'm a hot woman," Sarah announced at the outset, putting her flesh in motion with an original called "Blues All Along."

High Recall Rate For Super Bowl Ads
Some critics complained after Super Bowl XXVI on Sunday that the commercials overwhelmed a dull game.
That might have helped the advertisers who spent $850,000 for each 30-second spot, according to a survey released yesterday.
The fourth annual Super Poll, conducted by Cramer-Krasselt of Chicago and Milwaukee, reported that of 1,000 viewers surveyed, 59 percent remembered commercials they saw.
That compared with an average recall rate of 24 percent for commercials shown during regular prime-time programming.

Previously, Walker had been named the four-man's brakeman, or pusher.
"It takes a great athlete to be a pusher, combining speed and strength," said Hickey, speaking from Innsbruck, Austria, where the team is practicing.
"But you need those attributes particularly in Albertville, where there's a very flat start."

Battle for School Aid
With anger over taxes cooling in the wake of the second state budget in a row that called for no increases, the most volatile issue in New Jersey this year, and perhaps for the next decade, is education: who pays, how much, who benefits and how the money is allocated.
At center stage is Gov.
Jim Florio's showcase Quality Education Act, passed 19 months ago, already revised once and still the focus of intense debate and vows by the Republican majority in the Legislature to revise it yet again.
The Q.E.A., as it is called, was intended to funnel money to poorer districts, inevitably at the expense of wealthier ones, and that alone stirred anger in many of the state's 592 school districts where voters thought they were being shortchanged.
Revisions in March cut the aid sharply, and that frayed tempers further.
While some adroit budget manipulations restored much of the lost money this week, the improvement was obscured by the complexity of the aid distribution formula and the heated debate -- driven by partisan politics -- that surrounds it.
Indeed, with the Republicans now holding overwhelming majorities in the Legislature, the battle over the Quality Education Act may be just beginning.
Confrontation Inevitable
No sooner had the revised aid figures been released Tuesday than the new Republican Majority Leader in the Assembly, Jack Collins, declared "major revisions" in the way aid is allocated among districts to be a top priority of the Republicans, who are strong enough in both houses to override any veto from Governor Florio.
For his part, the Governor has made the Quality Education Act his administration's proudest legislative accomplishment and has vowed to do everything he can to protect it.
A confrontation seems inevitable, and it is certain to be a highly public one.
Today, on the heels of Mr.
Collins's legislative declaration of war, two Republicans, Assemblymen John A. Rocco of Camden, the chairman of the Assembly Education Committee, and Lee A. Solomon of Haddon Heights, took up the sword.
At Issue: What's Fair?
"The Q.E.A. has been a public nightmare since it was hastily passed and signed into law by the Governor," said Mr.
Rocco, who announced a public forum Thursday night in Voorhees to debate the law and its impact on district finances.
His view, and that of most if not all Republicans in both houses, is not likely to be changed by discussion.
The law, he said, has created "fiscal chaos and confusion in many school districts. Mr. Solomon says it is time to create a new system that is "fair to all school districts."
What is "fair" in this case is very much in the eye of the beholder, and what's in a beholder's eye is very much a product of where the beholder happens to live.
Class and Politics
Poor districts, particularly big urban ones with typical urban problems -- such places as Newark and Paterson and Jersey City -- receive a lot of assistance under the aid formula because it tilts heavily toward districts with severe educational problems and little ability to pay.
They tend to favor the the Q.E.A. system, and they get a lot of money under its aegis.
But suburban school districts, which tend to be wealthier and in most cases have comparatively fewer problems, receive less assistance, so they would like to see the formula changed.
Added to this struggle along socioeconomic lines -- a sort of educational class struggle -- is widespread unease over the apparent unpredictability of how the aid formula will play out from year to year, a factor compounded by the complexity of the formula.
That volatility alone can be a political black hole.
Note the case of Gabriel S. Ambrosio of Lyndhurst.
Mr.
Ambrosio was a Democratic Senator in a normally Republican district, but he lost his bid for re-election on Nov. 5 against an almost unknown Republican opponent, John P. Scott.
The reason, Mr.
Ambrosio says, was Q.E.A.  'A Roller Coaster'
"I lost the election by 200 votes in my own hometown of Lyndhurst because of the fact that the commissioner of education sent a letter four days before the election revoking the aid for Lyndhurst. The Q.E.A. was a debacle. They first sent a letter saying Lyndhurst was getting a lot more money, then four days before the election, they sent a letter saying it was all a mistake. It was just a roller coaster, and I got caught on it."
Mr.
Ambrosio was the victim of a mistake, it seems, but even under the best of circumstances, the aid formulations can seem unpredictable.
This week, for example, a new infusion of $341 million, derived from a revision in the way state pension funds are assessed, altered the aid picture in 359 of the state's 592 school districts, and in some cases the change was radical.
The small district of Linwood in Atlantic County, as one extreme example, had been scheduled for $4,600 in the major aid category, called foundation aid, which is intended to give all districts a "basic foundation" of state support to smooth out educational disparities across the state, the major aim of the act.
With the revision, the district is slated to get $680,000.
In Bergen County, 14 districts, of which only two were originally listed for foundation aid totaling $880,000, ended up with $10.6 million.
The state's largest district -- and one of its poorest -- Newark, had been scheduled to receive total assistance of $267 million.
Under the revised plan, itis scheduled for a small increase to $269 million.
On the other hand, Cherry Hill Township, a relatively well-off district, was not originally scheduled for any foundation aid, but it will now get $2.7 million.
Confusion and Dissatisfaction
Judith Savage, the manager of planning and research for the Department of Education's Division of Finance, said the apparent quirks actually resulted from a strict application of the aid formula.
She acknowledged that the revision resulted in increased aid to middle-income districts but insisted that large percentage increases or decreases meant little because they were not "generally big dollar increases."
"A district in Sussex County last year got an increase of $140,000," Ms.
Savage said.
"They had $3,000, so that was 4,000 percent. Camden got $24 million, an increase of 31 percent. Which one is bigger?"
Moreover, she said, "I don't think there was that much confusion at the district level. How much is confusion and how much is just dissatisfaction?"
The projected infusion of money into middle-income districts is expected to quell much of the dissatisfaction.
But it can arise again because the budget on which it is based has not passed the Legislature.
And Republicans have made it clear that they are not satisfied with the aid formula, in any case.

Review/Opera; The First Met 'Fidelio' of the Season
What happens to an opera production as it nears the end of its useful life?
To find out, one need only take a look at "Fidelio," which was given its first performance of the season at the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night.
The problem wasn't that the sets -- bare wood scaffolding and walls that looked like rusted metal collages -- weren't serviceable suggestions of the prison of the evil tyrant Don Pizarro.
It wasn't even that the concept was untenable: this 1970 production by Otto Schenk is relatively traditional in its treatment of character and plot.
The problem was that no one involved seemed to care very much one way or another about anything.
The stage directions of a generation ago have by now become formula.
It is live tradition hardened into rote ritual.

Yankees Sign Anderson For Minors
With no space on their roster but with the opportunity to give a rebounding pitcher a second chance, the Yankees yesterday signed a free agent, Allan Anderson, to a one-year minor league contract that will pay him $500,000 if he makes the major league club.
Anderson, who pitched with the Minnesota Twins for parts of the last six years, becomes the third free agent signed by the Yankees this month.
If Anderson does not make the Yankees, he will earn $60,000 to pitch at Class AAA Columbus.
If the left-hander does make it, he will receive $500,000 and could also earn $300,000 in bonuses for games started and innings pitched.
There is also a provision in the contract that allows Anderson to become a free agent if he is sent to the minors and the Yankees do not call him up by June 1.
Money-Saver on Mound?
Unlike the recent signings of the free agents Danny Tartabull and Mike Gallego, the Yankees may have actually saved money on the 28-year-old Anderson.
Craig Fenech, the player's agent, said that five teams had expressed interest in Anderson, and that the Yankees did not make the highest offer.
Furthermore, Bill Krueger and Eric King, two other free-agent starters New York was seriously considering, each signed more lucrative contracts yesterday with other teams.
Detroit signed King to a $1.2 million deal and Minnesota signed Krueger to a minor league contract that will pay him $550,000 if he makes the Twins with a chance for $450,000 more in incentives.

Even as the Middle East peace talks were getting under way in Moscow, prefabricated homes were being trucked this week to a Jewish settlement 30 miles east of Tel Aviv in the occupied West Bank.
The Israeli army said yesterday that Israel has broken up dozens of Palestinian guerrilla cells in the occupied West Bank and arrested hundreds of their members in recent months. (Associated Press)


Arms Makers Brace for Peace
Even after six years of gradual Pentagon cuts, the Bush Administration's plan to slash military spending by canceling or scaling back a number of high-profile arms programs came as a jolt to weapons builders and to thousands of workers from Connecticut to California who are likely to lose their jobs in coming years.
Virtually every military contractor faces the loss of some business.
The ensuing job losses would affect communities across the country, especially as business cutbacks spread to subcontractors and suppliers.


Transit Authority and Union Reach Tentative Accord on Contract
The Transit Authority and the union representing 32,000 New York City transit workers announced last night that they had reached a tentative agreement on a new contract that calls for a raise of 4.5 percent this year and an additional 2 percent next year.
Subway conductors and motormen, token clerks, bus drivers, maintenance workers and other unionized transit employees have been working without a new contract for nine months.
The agreement is complex; it covers a total of 38 months and is retroactive to May 1991.


The Federal Budget: The Military; Pentagon Offers Some Deep Cuts But Stops There
The Bush Administration's proposed military budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 offers deep cuts in long-range nuclear arms and cancels several major weapons, but stops short of fundamental changes in response to the Soviet Union's collapse, budget and military analysts said today.
The budget request, which will be submitted to Congress next month, includes halting production of the expensive B-2 Stealth bomber at 20 planes, building only one Seawolf attack submarine, delaying the Comanche light helicopter being developed for the Army and eliminating several other programs designed to counter a Soviet threat that no longer exists.


Saudi King Takes On Islamic Militants
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has stepped up a confrontation between militant Muslim fundamentalists and the ruling establishment, warning the fundamentalists of harsher treatment if they persist in challenging Saudi foreign and domestic policies.
The warning came after an attempt by religious fundamentalists and their militant supporters, under the umbrella of a movement called Islamic Awakening, to organize a public demonstration, which would be a grave affront to the conservative Saudi Arabian authorities.


The Tinkerer; Mr. Bush's New War, and Paper Sword
"This will not stand." George Bush's steely challenge to Saddam Hussein remains one of his most memorable expressions.
Tuesday night, mired in recession and fighting for his political life, Mr.
Bush invoked those words again in his State of the Union address.
"I look at hard times and make this vow: This will not stand." This will not fly would be more like it.
When the President resurrects the metaphor of Desert Storm to demonstrate his commitment to economic recovery, he might reasonably be expected to deliver a program to match the threat.
But nowhere did he come close to the economic equivalent of 550,000 troops.
What his speech and new budget offer instead is a laundry list with no main text.
What they disclose is not an anti-recession warrior but a tinkerer.

The Federal Budget: Taxes; Adjustment Brings In Cash, and Risk
Among the more than three dozen tax proposals in the budget request for 1993 that the Bush Administration sent to Congress today, the adjustment of withholding tables for most taxpayers to cut the amount taken out of each paycheck stands alone in needing no Congressional assent.
But while the adjustment will inject more than $2 billion a month in spending into the economy this year, some analysts warned that it would also create a potential trap for the unwary.


House Inquiry Is Expanded Into Research Overcharges
The investigation into universities' overcharging the Federal Government for scientific research that began at Stanford University has widened to include not only dozens of other major research universities but also contractors for two Government agencies and the officials who negotiate the research contracts.
Government officials told the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations today that the universities -- including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California at Berkeley and Harvard Medical School -- had overbilled the Federal Government millions of dollars in inappropriate expenses.


New Nets Look Like Old Nets As Suns Get 33-Point Victory
When the Nets started their western road trip, things were looking better for the franchise than they had in years.
The young team had just rallied to defeat the Phoenix Suns for their fifth consecutive victory and were within two games of uncharted territory: the .500 mark.
Whatever they were doing right, they left the formula at home.
For a second consecutive night, the Nets played virtually no defense, allowed their opponent to score seemingly at will, and exhibited a minimum of emotion.
The result was a third successive loss, 128-95, to the Phoenix Suns.

Mr.

Mr.
Nikolais is at it again here with lights, mirrors and brilliant colors and patterns, a lush world through which dancers move, all noble bone and muscle here in skimpy flesh-colored costumes, appearing and disappearing as if by magic.

Threat of Lawsuit Enforces Product Safety
To the Editor:
Anna Quindlen's poignant statement that the furor over dangerous silicone breast implants is not about breasts (column, Jan. 19) is frighteningly true.
It is about all of us!
"It would be grand," she states, "to know that those who manufacture body parts hold themselves to a higher standard than the makers of acrylic sweaters." It would be grand if the manufacturers and users of asbestos, silica, vinyl chloride, lead, nickel and a whole host of other toxic substances had adequately warned workers and others exposed to their effects.
All have caused a myriad of diseases, including cancer.
Drug and medical device manufacturers that have placed such products as DES and the Dalkon Shield on the market might also have sought a standard higher than the bottom line.


Puerto Rico Gripped by Its Watergate
Nearly 14 years after two young members of a radical pro-independence group were executed by police officers on a remote mountaintop, Puerto Ricans remain gripped by the case and riveted to its latest twist: televised hearings on whether high-level Puerto Rican and Federal Government officials helped plan the killings and cover them up.
The case, known as Cerro Maravilla for the mountain where the killings occurred and already the subject of two books and a movie, is now the focus of hearings by the Judiciary Committee of the Puerto Rico Senate.
An earlier Senate investigation of the killings exposed them as murders and led to the conviction of 10 police officers.


Security Council Is Still Debating Wording of a Summit Declaration

China, India and some of the so-called third world nations on the Council are resisting any ringing endorsement of these goals, arguing that by doing so the Council would be involving itself in the domestic affairs of other countries and that disarmament is outside its sphere of competence.

Why U.S. Grew Less Wheat Last Year
To the Editor:
I share Frederick S. Lightfoot's concern about the deterioration of the world environment in "Protectionism Not Root of Wheat Loss" (letter, Jan. 16).
However, I find him misleading.
The approximately 30 percent reduction in United States wheat production in 1991 against 1990 was due not only to drought and excessive temperatures but also to a more than 10 percent decline in the area planted.
The acreage reduction was determined primarily by Government policy.
The policy was influenced by low United States wheat exports, which were in part a consequence of European farm subsidies.


Ex-Producer Sues Manager of New Kids
The former music director of New Kids on the Block has filed a lawsuit against the group's founder for breach of contract, and has charged that the group was involved in musical fakery.

Mr.
McPherson says in the suit, which was filed last week in Massachusetts Superior Court in Boston, that he should have received 2 percent of what was probably at least $20 million in gross revenues from the group's "Hanging Tough Live" video, but that he has received nothing.

Haiti: Tighten the Embargo
Rampaging military hard-liners have torpedoed a promising Haitian political compromise mediated by the Organization of American States.
As a result more Haitians are dying, more are fleeing for their lives, and the eventual task of reconstruction has been made more difficult.
The hard-liners seem unlikely to permit any settlement unless forced to by a more stringent regional economic embargo.
The embargo was imposed by the O.A.S. in the aftermath of the Sept. 30, 1991, military coup against Haiti's first freely elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Though it applied only to Western Hemisphere countries, the embargo was effective at first.
By late November, critical supplies of gasoline were nearly exhausted.

Keeping Up a Tradition In Giving to the Neediest
An editorial published during the first campaign in 1912 defined the purpose of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund: "not giving, but elevating into self-support and self-respect." As it has achieved that goal, the names of the poor, sick and disabled New Yorkers it benefits have changed from year to year.
But a large measure of the fund's success has been the continuity of those contributors who have made a tradition of pulling up those who have fallen into need.
"This is my 70th straight year of contributing to your wonderful fund," Virginia Miles of Englewood, N.J., wrote in a note with $100.
"I began when I was a small child by contributing my entire holdings, 10 cents."

But questions are again being raised about whether Sun can keep its perch atop the intensely competitive market for work stations, desktop computers that generally offer more power than personal computers.
Work stations are used by engineers, researchers and scientists who need to manipulate large amounts of data and numbers.

Review/Theater; Stoppard In Russian From Israel
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," Tom Stoppard's virtuosic play on "Hamlet," vaults a time and language barrier in the Gesher Theater Company production, performed in Russian, through Sunday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
While retaining its essence as an existential comedy about a pair of classic outsiders caught up in the confusion at Elsinore, the play gains new relevance in this production and in the light of recent political turmoil in the former Soviet Union.
This refreshing, swift-paced version of Mr.
Stoppard's youthful travesty is directed by Yevgeny Arye, leading an Israeli company of emigre Russian actors.
Simultaneous translation back into English is provided over headsets, adding a further Stoppardian twist to the multi-cultural experience.


Household to Cut Back Its Commercial Lending
In an announcement that caught Wall Street off guard, the Household International Inc. said today that because of continued high losses it was shutting down much of its commercial finance operation.
Among the businesses to be eliminated are lending for commercial real estate, leveraged buyouts and higher-risk companies.
Even though Household will be abandoning those businesses to focus on its mainstay consumer finance operation, the company, based in Prospect Heights, Ill., said it expected loan losses to continue to mount.


Are Champagne Prices in Store for Beer?
The local economy may be a mess, crime a constant threat and living costs still ruinous, but one of New York City's consolations has been some of the nation's kinder prices for beer.
Now, the nation's largest beer producer is pitted against the city's independent beer distributors in a battle whose outcome, the distributors and city officials say, could create a wholesaling monopoly and raise prices by a dollar or more a case.
Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc., which supplies more than half of the city's beer, added a dollar a case on Monday to wholesale prices statewide on its most popular brands.
The company will issue rebates only to those retailers who buy all their Budweiser and other company brands directly from the company's four franchised wholesalers.


CHRONICLE
For Judge GUSTIN L. REICHBACH, receiving an award from the New York State Bar Association yesterday was a bittersweet milestone in his career on the city bench.
The David S. Michaels Award for "courageous efforts in promoting integrity in the criminal justice system" was given to him for having distributed condoms and information on AIDS to prostitutes and other people brought before him in Criminal Court in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
But last fall he was transferred to Civil Court in Brooklyn, a move he says was motivated by his efforts to fight AIDS.


Review/Film; A Variation on the Oedipus Theme
European film makers are restless these days.
They are roaming the world in search of something, though exactly what remains unclear.
Possibly financial backing, maybe subject matter, perhaps something to believe in.
Wim Wenders took his cast and crew through seven countries before finally settling down in Australia to conclude his enjoyably peripatetic new-age comedy, "Until the End of the World."
Volker Schlondorff displays the same itch in his "Voyager," which was shot in Mexico, France, Italy, the United States and Greece.
The new film, opening today at the Lincoln Plaza, is no less new age than Mr.
Wenders's, though it considers the world in terms that evoke classic Greek tragedy rather than Jean-Luc Godard.
The multi-national auspices behind these films, and the variety of locations in which they were shot, appear to reflect an increasing rootlessness within the European film industry.
As recent political and economic upheavals are evident in the manner in which the movies are made, the conditions are also manifest in the concerns expressed in the films themselves.
Politics and party lines are to be avoided.
They may be out of date next week.
In some ways, Mr.
Wenders, Mr.
Schlondorff and other European film makers today appear to be as uncertain as the characters within their films.
"Voyager," directed by Mr.
Schlondorff and adapted by Rudy Wurlitzer from the 1957 Max Frisch novel, "Homo Faber," is about nothing less than fate and predestination as they operate in the curious story of Walter Faber (Sam Shepard).
The film is a modern variation on the Oedipus myth, recalled in flashbacks within flashbacks that start in June 1957, at the airport in Athens.
Walter, an engineer who works with the United Nations, is a man who travels light or, as he tells someone: "Three or four days with a woman is the absolute maximum. After that I dissimulate."
He recalls his student days in Switzerland, just before World War II, when he abandoned Hannah (Barbara Sukowa), his pregnant lover, to return to the United States.
He had told himself that he wasn't being a cad.
Hannah had promised to get an abortion and his best friend, a German student named Joachim (August Zirner), had promised to look out for her.
Some years later, in another flashback, he remembers hearing that Joachim and Hannah had married, had a child and divorced.
Still later he remembers taking a ship from New York to France and meeting Sabeth (Julie Delpy), a spectacularly pretty and sweet young student with whom he falls in love, at least in part because she reminds him of Hannah.
What with all of Walter's musing on the soundtrack about probability and coincidence, the audience is alerted to the truth about Sabeth's parentage long before it dawns on Walter.
He only catches on after he and Sabeth have had an idyllic motor tour across the continent, and Walter is about to deliver the young woman to her mother in Greece.
In the film's abrupt and rather brutal conclusion, the gods intervene to punish Walter for his earlier transgression.
The man of technology and science is brought to heel by laws that have nothing to do with his universe.
All of this plays with a lot more intelligence than you might expect.
The English dialogue often sounds as if it had been translated from something else, but there is an engaging leisureliness, almost a lassitude, about the pace that invites contemplation.
Walter, as played by Mr.
Shepard, is seriously eccentric and self-aware.
He's a character of some stature.
So is Sabeth.
Because Miss Delpy is a most attractive actress, the love affair takes on such weight and meaning that the inevitable revelation seems an arbitrary intrusion by a doomily schematic plot.
It also seems to be worlds away from the world in which the film was made.
"Voyager" has been handsomely photographed in all sorts of exotic locations, though it might have been just as effective if shot in two or three fewer countries.
It is well acted by Mr.
Shepard and Miss Delpy, and is full of moments so particular and odd that they invite belief.
Yet its tale of fate and predestination seems, at last, to be not timeless but absurd.
"Voyager," which has been rated PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), deals with incest.

Time to Rethink National Policies on Race; Place of Responsibility
To the Editor:
Bravo, Barney Frank ("Race and Crime: Let's Talk Sense," Op-Ed, Jan. 13), for saying that "people who assault, rape, rob or otherwise terrorize others are bad people from whom the innocent majority must be protected." So often the public has been fed the information he alludes to regarding the social causes of crime, and has been pushed to accept that criminals are victims of their environment and so have no responsibility for their actions.
Few come out and say, these people are bad.
Not only do liberals need to appear less sympathetic to criminals, as Mr.
Frank states, but all those attempting to handle the causes of crime need to recognize to what degree individual responsibility plays a role in creating a criminal.


CHINA SAID TO SELL PARTS FOR MISSILES
American intelligence reports indicate that China is continuing to sell missile technology to Syria and Pakistan despite statements by Chinese leaders that they are willing to curb missile exports, according to senior Administration officials.
Beijing has recently delivered to Syria about 30 tons of chemicals needed to make a solid-fuel missile and plans to deliver an additional 60 tons in March or April, said the officials, who added that the amount was enough to make a "significant" number of intermediate-range missiles.

The Russian Government is chopping away at the status quo with enthusiasm.
Meanwhile, the most stultified legislative bureaucracy since the fall of the Supreme Soviet -- the U.S.
Congress -- is resisting our efforts to launch a historic new war on poverty.


Tyson's Accuser Tells Jury of Assault
The 18-year-old woman who has accused Mike Tyson of raping her last July took the stand today and described what she said was a dream come true that turned into a horrifying assault during which the former heavyweight champion repeatedly warned: "Don't fight me. Don't fight me."
The attack, she said, caused her "excruciating pain," and when she wept "he started laughing like it was a game or something, like it was funny."

Review/Art; Paley's Gift, a Paean To French Masters
THE WILLIAM S. PALEY COLLECTION," which opens Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, places before the public for the first time an extraordinary private collection. Its nearly 80 paintings, drawings and sculpture, the best of them by French modern masters, also constitute the most significant gift the museum has received in recent years.
On the short list of the high points of the Paley gift, which a museum spokeswoman termed "priceless," are Picasso's "Boy Leading a Horse" of 1905-06, a landmark on the artist's path to maturity, as well as paintings by Gauguin and Andre Derain that strengthen the museum's Post-Impressionist and Fauvist holdings.
In addition, a 1927 Matisse portrait becomes the museum's first real masterpiece from the artist's Nice period.

At the first Security Council summit meeting, on Friday, President Bush and other world leaders will ask the new United Nations Secretary General to propose ways of improving the United Nations' peacemaking role, including the possible creation of what would amount to a standing United Nations army.
To reinforce the pledge they will make to give the Security Council prime responsibility for preserving peace in the post-cold-war era, the meeting's participants will ask Secretary General Boutros Ghali to report by July 1 on ways of strengthening the United Nations' capacity for "preventative diplomacy, for peacemaking and for peacekeeping."

Five years from now, historians will scan this week's events and say they snapped into focus, briefly yet sharply, the future of world politics.
That future was barely glimpsed in President Bush's mostly backward-looking State of the Union address.
But it was splashed all over the newspapers.
The news revealed a world where money is talking as perhaps never before.
Money power is dictating not just economic choices but political futures, from Western Europe to China.
Money is on the verge of being used with astonishing creativity to deal with conflicts in the Middle East and nuclear safety in the old Soviet Union.
Money is reshaping battle lines between nations and international corporations in maddeningly unpredictable ways.


Banking Regulation; All of the Oratory in New Hampshire Isn't Likely to Make Borrowing Easier
When President Bush castigated regulators in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday for treating banks too harshly and creating a shortage of credit, he sounded a theme also heard from Democratic Presidential candidates but rejected by the regulators and many bankers.
These latest election-year outbursts are unlikely to loosen the strict standards of the nation's more than 10,000 bank examiners.
Regulators still contend that failing to force banks to admit their mistakes would mislead investors and allow greater problems to fester untreated.

Reviews/Film; Learning to Trust Again As a Holocaust Survivor
In the cloyingly sensitive "Alan and Naomi," a stickball-playing Brooklyn boy is urged by his parents to befriend a strange, troubled young girl who is a Holocaust refugee.
The year is 1944, and Naomi Kirschenbaum (Vanessa Zaoui) has recently arrived from France.
Still suffering the effects of her wartime experiences, Naomi "has to learn to trust again," in the words of one of the film's many meddlesome characters.
So she does nothing but tear scraps of newspaper and clutch her doll, Yvette, until Alan Silverman (Lukas Haas) tries to approach her.
Eventually, she will declare that "Alan makes me laugh when I'm crying inside."
This breakthrough arrives only after a long and laborious courtship stage.
At first, it is only with the aid of a ventriloquist's dummy that Alan is able to engage Yvette in conversation.
But after a while, Naomi is talking, too.
She and Alan develop the kind of tender, budding friendship that places "Alan and Naomi" in the dread coming-of-age-film category, although it devotes equal energy to developing a kind of hothouse Brooklyn atmosphere.
"Eat
dat
with your pickled herring!" goes one line of dialogue.


Facing Life's Biggest Challenge at a Tender Age
At first, they sound just like teen- agers the awkward pauses to insure that they don't say the wrong thing, the almost palpable social discomfort, the exaggerated concern over blending with others, the "awesomes," the "uhms" and the "I mean likes."
But then, in conversations, something doesn't quite ring adolescent.
These young people seem too wise, too weary, too wary.
At a time when they should be concerned with pimples, pencils and passing passions centered on the latest unshaven, shirt-free rock band requiring mass adulation, these boys and girls know far too much about vincristine, Cytoxan, Methotrexate, Adriamycin and Cis-platinum.
They talk with the scarred openness of war-worn veterans twice their age about losing friends, limbs and battles.

Sounds Around Town
Punk and Poetry
Henry Rollins, Wetlands, 161 Hudson Street, Manhattan, (212) 966-4225.
The one-time front man for California's punk-rock magnates Black Flag and the current leader of his own hard-core band, Henry Rollins puts a great deal of his steamroller energy these days into words alone.
His spoken performances are antagonistic and funny, mixing verse with verbose diatribes on all manner of subjects, from feminism to political corruption to David Lee Roth.
He blurs the lines between punk and poetry, reinventing the macho pose with a vulnerable core.
Performance is Sunday at 6 P.M.
Admission is $10.

Each of the bands on this triple bill deals in some way with the female identity filtered through an alternative-rock consciousness.
Boss Hog is led by Cristina, who puts supermodel posturing in an industrial-guitar context.
Bikini Kill screams about being socially disprivileged against a primitive three-chord backdrop; Kitten is the side project of the Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon and the guitarist Julia Cafritz from the band Pussy Galore.
Guitar distortion, structural anarchy and sister power will reign supreme.

THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans; Executives Give Bush a Tepid Greeting
President Bush told jokes about Boris Yeltsin and the Super Bowl.
He denounced "sweet-sounding quick fixes," "empty symbols and slogans" and "feel-good gimmicks." He tried out a new slogan for his economic growth programs: "It will work."
He even appeared before just about the friendliest audience the White House could find, the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, as he took to the road today to begin the campaign to sell his economic proposals outside of Washington.
Polite but Unenthusiastic
But having announced that he would hold his political fire until after the March 20 deadline he set for Congress to pass his programs, Mr.
Bush found himself restricted largely to a textbookish reprise of his State of the Union Message, without the oratorical flourishes of Tuesday night's speech or any of what he likes to call his "red meat" political lines.


Restaurants
Chelsea Central
Larry McIntyre, the owner of Chelsea Central on 10th Avenue, must sometimes feel like the coach of a successful minor-league baseball team: the better his team, the greater the chance his best slugger will be drafted up to the big leagues.
Of course, in the restaurant game the cleanup hitter is the chef, and in the last five years Mr.
McIntyre has seen some prize players come and go.
In 1987, Richard Moonan was recruited to create a refined American menu; he later moved to the River Cafe in Brooklyn.
Then came Tom Valenti, another ace with American cuisine, who left for Alison on Dominick Street in SoHo.
After him came Stephen Meyers from Le Bernardin and the Sign of the Dove.
He stayed until last July, when he was tapped by the Century Cafe in midtown Manhattan.
The current chef, Paul Zweben, who was a sous-chef at the River Cafe, follows an impressive roster of alumni.
Chelsea Central has a turn-of-the-century charm, with its long mahogany bar, stamped tin ceiling, tile floor, stained glass trim, Art Deco posters and cafe tables with bentwood chairs.
Tulip sconces diffuse soft light on the brick walls and white napery.
It's the kind of place you can go wearing anything from blue jeans to a business suit and feel comfortable.
Mr.
Zweben's menu combines traditional American fare and colorful contemporary creations, plus a couple of curve balls like duck confit egg rolls.
These crisp, light cylinders hold rich duck confit, scallions and ginger bound with a chicken mousse, all are moistened with a rice-wine vinaigrette.
Iced Pine Island oysters are an enticing way to start, as is the sweet-tinged onion soup.
Hummus, the Middle Eastern chickpea puree, is prepared here with white beans and garlic.
While the flavor is pleasing, this unnecessary modification leaves the puree mushy like potatoes, rather than faintly grainy as with chickpeas.
Little cornmeal-encrusted crab cakes are all crust and little crab.
But the garnishes -- salsa made of corn, fennel and basil, and basil-tomato oil -- are delicious.
Chelsea Central has a very well-rounded wine selection, with prices that match the food tab.
Among whites, you would do well with the sharp, clean 1989 sauvignon blanc from Silverado Vineyards ($19), or the 1990 Muscadet from Domaine de l'Alouette ($16).
Two of the many reds to consider are a 1989 Dolcetto d'Alba Cantina del Glicine ($20) and the 1988 petite sirah from Guenoc Vineyards ($20).
The restaurant's servers are casual but attentive.
The pace of a meal here is agreeable, too, never rushed or laggard.
Chelsea Central is the sort of pub environment in which you would want to have a steaming shepherd's pie.
My experiences with it were mixed.
On a first sampling, it was a rough, clumsy assembly of lamb chunks and carrots in a lackluster sauce.
A fellow diner ordered it on a second visit, against my advice.
This time it was totally different, with tender slices of lamb and carrots in a rich, well-seasoned lamb stock and sealed with chive-flecked mashed potatoes.
A third sampling (I'm tenacious when it comes to shepherd's pie) also was superior.
Take your chances.
One of the most consistently good dishes is grilled duck breast and buttery confit of the legs, with a cabernet sauvignon sauce.
A meaty sauteed pork chop comes with tasty red-pepper polenta, zucchini and sauteed escarole, while a nicely blackened Black Angus steak that is wonderfully beefy is served with golden-brown spatzle and spinach.
Red snapper is prepared several ways; in one, the fillet is seared until crisp and set over a bright mixture of bok choy, pickled ginger and portobello mushrooms.
Fruitwood-grilled salmon is enhanced with corn, black beans and potato pancakes.
Some desserts sound as if they were ordered for a birthday party at summer camp.
Peanut butter chocolate pie with chocolate sauce is recommended only for those who still have a peanut-butter-and-jelly habit.
Pumpkin ice cream in a chocolate coating is a diverting combination, and cappuccino creme brulee (I've had three at various restaurants in the last month, which makes it as a trend) is harder to swallow conceptually than literally.
The creamy coffee flavor is not bad at all.
Rounding it out are two winners: pear and apple crisp with vanilla ice cream, and a fudgelike flourless chocolate cake with creme anglaise.
One needs a score card to keep track of chefs at Chelsea Central.
But as long as Mr.
Zweben is in control, one can be assured of solid American fare that is thoughtfully conceived and prepared with generosity of spirit.
Indochine
When Indochine was last reviewed, in 1988, I noted that at this Southeast Asian hot spot in Greenwich Village one could expect a colorful downtown crowd, long waits for tables, indifferent service and provocative food.
Recent visits require some modification: few crowds, no wait for tables, languid service and still-invigorating food.
Despite its attitude problem, Indochine remains the best bet for authentic and lightsome Vietnamese and Cambodian cooking.
Like so many restaurants that have had long, successful runs, Indochine has let down its guard.
No one appears to be in charge of the dining room, certainly not the sullen hostess dressed in black who spent most of the evening leaning against the bar.
Servers were only slightly more attentive.
The long rectangular room has a tentative tropical theme, with palm fronds painted on the walls, greenery scattered here and there, dark green banquettes and white tablecloths.
Now that the dining room is not crowded -- at least not on the January evenings I was there -- noise is not a major concern.
Those who have been to Indochine in the last two, four or six years will recognize most dishes on the menu.
It rarely changes, which must be monotonous for repeat customers with inquisitive palates.
One standard that remains compelling is the sweet-and-sour shrimp in a sweet pineapple-and-tomato broth seasoned with tamarind.
This multi-dimensional creation strikes first with the sweetness of the pineapple, then yields to the sour elements, finally leaving the palate with an earthy tamarind sensation.
Another is fillet of gray sole, steamed in a banana leaf with sweet coconut milk and citric lemon grass.
Banh cuon are steamed Vietnamese ravioli, three big ones, stuffed with minced chicken, black mushrooms and bean sprouts, then garnished with more chicken and bean sprouts.
The ravioli are not particularly tasty by themselves, but they come alive when dipped in nuoc cham, the Vietnamese condiment made with salted anchovies and vinegar.
A light, satisfying starter is a simple salad of chopped chicken breast, cabbage and basil with a dressing of fermented fish sauce, sugar, lime juice and sweet pepper.
Everyone at my table attacked the sprightly little shrimp-filled dumplings that are wrapped in mint and lettuce leaves, then dipped in a sweet sauce.
The shrimp have some fire in them that is tamed by the soothing mint.
In contrast, rouleaux de printemps, or spring rolls, are a cool combination of rice paper rolled around vermicelli, bean sprouts, and mint with a peanut sauce for dipping.
A house special for many years has been the deep-fried boned chicken wings stuffed with vermicelli, bean sprouts, carrots, lemon grass, galangal (in the ginger family) and diced chicken.
The texture is delightful, but the stuffing could use more seasoning.
Once again a dipping sauce came to the rescue.
Another special is terrific roast duck, the meat juicy and the skin brittle, in an assertive ginger sauce.
Ginger also brightens cubes of grilled chicken breast sprinkled with sesame seeds.
It was difficult to detect any lemon grass in the sweet little pork spare ribs, but the house rice with it, studded with peas and shrimp, was hard to stop eating.
Indochine has a small, moderately priced wine selection that marries well with this complex food.
Prices are right, too.
The Vietnamese are not big dessert-eaters, although they do make some sweet fruit puddings and soups.
I doubt that one would find lemon tart and hazelnut mousse cake on a Vietnamese table.
Verisimilitude aside, Indochine's lemon tart is better than average, and its mousse cake is outstanding.
Fruit sorbets and ice creams are well made, too.
It is not so easy to recommend Indochine these days.
Those who enjoy a lively and affable setting might well be put off by the somber staff; on the other hand, diners who care primarily about the food might love it.
For now, it gets the benefit of the doubt, and the hope that the service shapes up.

Acting Chief Named for Transit Police
George A. Latimer, the deputy chief of the New York City Transit Police, has been named acting chief of the department, pending the selection of a permanent replacement for the current chief, William J. Bratton, who steps down today, the president of the Transit Authority, Alan F. Kiepper, said yesterday.
Chief Bratton has announced that he would resign from the transit police to take the No. 2 position in the Boston Police Department.

Estate to Release Files of H.I.V.-Infected Dentist
In a decision that could influence the national debate over the risks of the public's exposure to AIDS from health-care workers, a State Supreme Court justice today ordered the estate of a dentist who died of AIDS to turn over records of his practice to the State Health Department.
In granting the request for the records of Dr.
Philip Feldman of Coram, Justice Peter F. Cohalan ruled that the public's right to the information should prevail.
He rejected arguments by Dr.
Feldman's estate that the medical records were protected under doctor-client confidentiality.


N.B.A. Does What It Does Best: Rebounds
As skilled at selling itself as any professional sports league there ever was, the National Basketball Association might market its 1991-92 season with the following slogan: Ya Gotta See It to Believe It.
Just when it seemed to be sailing on calm, crystal blue waters toward next summer's international N.B.A. clinic and shoe-sales convention in Barcelona, storm clouds suddenly appeared and dumped a torrent of controversy on the wildly successful stewardship of Commissioner David Stern.


Mental Hospital Closings Draw Few Cheers
There is a certain purity to the logic of the case being made by state mental health officials that half of the state's 22 psychiatric hospitals should either be mothballed or reduced in size by the end of the decade.
The state has a dire need to expand community services for the mentally ill.
But about 70 percent of its $2.4 billion mental health budget must be spent to maintain anachronistic hospitals that house only 12,500 of the estimated 185,000 New Yorkers with serious mental illnesses.


Leaders Gather in New York to Chart a World Order
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia last night joined a parade of world leaders gathering in New York for today's summit meeting at the United Nations, but diplomats said he was looking beyond a high-profile debut in Big Power politics to crucial talks with President Bush tomorrow on nuclear arms cuts and aid to his troubled homeland.
Three decades after Nikita S. Khrushchev banged his shoe on a desk at the United Nations, creating one of the most enduring images of the cold war, the leaders of 15 nations -- the permanent and temporary members of the United Nations Security Council -- are coming together in a new spirit of cooperation with an avowed purpose of shaping a more humane and peaceful world order.

CHRONICLE
The music of ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER has not always been received with warmth, but rarely have remarks about it been quite so cutting as those made earlier this month by MALCOLM WILLIAMSON, the composer who has been Master of the Queen's Music since 1975.
Mr.
Williamson told a British reporter that "the difference between good music and Andrew Lloyd Webber's is the difference between Michelangelo and a cement mixer."


UJB Fight By Chilmark
Chilmark Capital Partners, a New York investment group, said yesterday that it planned a proxy fight for one or more board seats at the UJB Financial Corporation, a Princeton, N.J., bank-holding company.
Chilmark, which acqured 9.9 percent of UJB late last year, said it had retained Dewe Rogerson Inc., a proxy soliciting firm, to aid in the contest for the April 20 shareholder meeting.


THE FEDERAL BUDGET: Personal Savings; An I.R.A. Plan for Middle-Class Needs
It goes by the name flexible individual retirement account, but what President Bush proposed this week might better be described as a savings program for middle-income people.
"It's a misnomer to call it a retirement plan," said Stephen Corrick, a tax partner at the Washington office of Arthur Andersen.
"But it certainly is flexible and it provides tax-advantaged savings, and there's nothing wrong with that."


A Doff of the Cap to Cosell
The first time I met Howard Cosell he hit me with a tape recorder.
It was no accident.
I was in his way.
This was in 1962, at the New York Mets' first spring training.
Cosell, desperately swinging his 30-pound Nagra, whaled his way through a pack of reporters surrounding Manager Casey Stengel.
Cosell whacked me on the left flank.
He would not have cared if it were my head.
The welt eventually faded, as did my anger, replaced first by disdain for this storky, nasal, pushy radio hack, and later by admiration for his humor and intelligent doggedness in pursuit of a story, and finally by an enormous appreciation for the most important sports journalist of this century, and one of the most influential electronic voices of our time.

On My Mind; The Best in Him
The President gave the State of the Union Message the very best he had in him, and that is the saddest part of all.

He had said so for weeks.


Panel Sues Landlords To Protect SoHo Sites
Only a long view from across Canal Street fully reveals the bizarre anomalies of buildings like No. 375, on the corner of West Broadway.
Built as a home in the early 19th century, the shabby, four-story brick structure retains a charming, sort of Charles Addams-style black mansard roof with attic windows under cast-iron filigree.


Nassau's Bond Rating Is Lowered Over Fiscal Questions
With Nassau County's government locked in a stalemate and its celebrated Rebublican political machine in disarray, Moody's Investor Service yesterday lowered the county's bond rating, citing "substantial uncertainty" about its fiscal stewardship.
The rating, lowered from A1 to A, the fifth of seven investment grade ratings, remained one notch above ratings in neighboring New York City and Suffolk County, areas also hard hit by the recession.
But rating officials warned that the county's rating could be lowered still further.


Philippine Plan for U.S. Bases
The Philippine Senate has approved a law to convert two United States military bases to commercial use after American troops complete their withdrawal.
The measure, approved late Wednesday, will create a free port zone at the Subic Bay naval station and a special economic zone at Clark Air Base.


Review/Film; Sissy Spacek With a Lout For an Ex
"Hard Promises" is a barren little comedy that means to be romantic, set in small-town America where the lady next door bakes cookies, everybody knows everybody else and small children are full of snappy comebacks.
After a 12-year marriage, most of which he's been away, Joey (William Petersen), a good-looking, egocentric drifter, returns home in high dudgeon to stop his wife, Chris (Sissy Spacek), from marrying another man.
Joey didn't know that Chris had divorced him until he received an invitation to the wedding.

Congress Expected to Pass Scaled-Down Energy Plan
Stripped of its most controversial provisions, the National Energy Strategy proposed by President Bush during the Persian Gulf crisis seems likely to pass this year, according to lawmakers, energy company executives and others.
The Senate version of the bill has been introduced again, minus the provisions on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and on stricter gasoline mileage standards for new cars, and may reach the floor as early as Monday.


Topics of The Times; Post Yuppies
Is there a
mot juste
that categorizes the generation following the yuppies?
One writer pushed the term Generation X, without much success.
Now some shrewd New York journalist has come up with an apt tag for Americans coming of age in a country that is post-modern, post-cold-war, post-baby-boom, post-prosperity: posties.
Yuppie is an acronym for the young urban professionals of the affluent 1980's.
The word was a deft variation on Yippies, derived from the Youth International Party of Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman in the yeasty 1960's.


Review/Film; Spoofing Movie Stars And a War
Of the two subjects being lampooned in "Into the Sun" -- the war in the Persian Gulf and vain, self-involved Hollywood movie stars -- only one is funny.
This film's portrait of Tom Slade (Anthony Michael Hall), a visiting celebrity at a military air base in Sicily, is its main comic attraction.
With his moussed hair, dark shades and ultraserious manner, Tom has arrived to study real airmen as he prepares for his latest film role, which only goes to prove that "Hot Shots!" was not the last word in flyboy satire.
When shown fighter planes, Tom says dismissively: "F-14, F-16, whatever. I'm not good with numbers. I've got accountants for numbers."


India Drops a Ban on Foreign Trademarks
In steps aimed at opening the economy further, India's central bank announced today that it was dismantling an 18-year-old law that banned big foreign companies from selling products under their internationally known trademarks.
It also ended an earlier rule that blocked the companies from owning property in India.
The developments came as Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao, who heads a minority Government and is pushing ambitious economic changes, traveled to New York to attend a special United Nations Security Council meeting called by Prime Minister John Major of Britain.


On Stage, and Off
Tickets at Bloomingdale's
A new price war in the theater has begun between the Theater Development Fund, which operates the TKTS half-price ticket booths, and, if you please, Bloomingdale's.
In the store's new partnership with Ticketmaster, America's largest computerized ticket service, customers can now buy seats for certain Broadway and Off Broadway shows at the store for a discount beginning at 10 A.M. rather than waiting until the TKTS booths open at 3 P.M.
The Nederlander Organization, which owns nine Broadway theaters, is participating, along with 13 Off Broadway shows that already use Ticketmaster.
Nederlander is the only one of the three major Broadway theater owners involved in the Bloomingdale's program; the Shubert Organization and Jujamcyn Theaters do not use Ticketmaster.
With what Fred Rosen, the Ticketmaster chairman, calls flexible pricing, customers will be offered discounts ranging from 10 to 75 percent, depending on the kind of full-price sales a show is having on any given day.
And this ticket counter is indoors.
"At Bloomingdale's you can use a credit card to buy tickets at discount," Mr.
Rosen says.
"At TKTS, you have to use cash. And there's more flexibility. If a really hot show is having a slow week and wants to offer only a 10 percent discount, they can. Why not let the producer decide the value of the tickets every day? We're just trying to provide more opportunities to go to the theater. This is about serving the public." It is also about good business.
The service charge will vary from $2 to $4 a ticket, Mr.
Rosen says.
The Theater Development Fund is outraged, even though the Nederlanders will also continue to use TKTS.
In a statement, the fund's president, David D. Holbrook, calls the new counter at Bloomingdale's "a blatant attempt to undermine the mission and good work of Theater Development Fund."
"The theater and the public at large have a stake in preserving the integrity of TKTS against splinter efforts such as this one to market discounted tickets for profit on a piecemeal basis," he says.
Because the nonprofit Theater Development Fund supports many of its programs with the $2 service charge for each ticket sold at TKTS, those programs may now be in jeopardy.
They include low-cost tickets for those who could not ordinarily afford them and the Theater Access Project, which has assisted nearly 90,000 handicapped people.
In the 1990-91 season, the fund accounted for 22 percent of all Broadway admissions and 13 percent of gross revenues.
Henry Guettel, the executive director of Theater Development Fund, says, "This unilateral action by the Nederlander Organization constitutes a real threat to T.D.F.'s programs in support of the theater and the growth of its audiences."
James Nederlander, the president of the company, responds: "It is not our intention to harm T.D.F. We're trying to make it easy for the customer by offering a flexible forum for discounting." Drama Behind 'The Extra Man'
"The Extra Man," a new play by Richard Greenberg, will begin performances at Manhattan Theater Club on April 28.
The play, says Mr.
Greenberg, who also wrote "Eastern Standard," is about an editor at a small publishing house, quietly unhappy in her marriage, who is seduced by one friend into an affair with another friend.
The play landed at Manhattan Theater Club after its tryout last fall at the South Coast Repertory Theater in Costa Mesa, Calif., only after much offstage drama between the playwright, the director, Michael Engler, and the star, Peter Frechette, all of whom contributed to making "Eastern Standard" a hit.
Although "The Extra Man" was well received in Costa Mesa, the playwright and the director had come to a crossroads.
"We were getting too complacent with each other instead of pushing each other the way we used to," Mr.
Engler says.
"Like a marriage, you have to reinvent a collaboration sometimes, say things you haven't said."
While they were saying them, Mr.
Greenberg's agent, Helen Merrill, called Mark Lamos, the artistic director of the Hartford Stage Company, first about the possibility of presenting the play there, then about Mr.
Lamos's directing it himself.
Then the phone calls stopped.
"I'm not sure exactly what happened," Mr.
Lamos says.
"I knew Lynne Meadow wanted it for Manhattan Theater Club. Richard and I had talked about what he needed in order to rethink the production. Next thing I know, I was sharing a cab with Lynne and she was doing it."
Mr.
Greenberg says: "Helen is a fan of having an interim production before a play comes to New York, for prudent, protective reasons. I know Mark wanted to do it, and for a while I leaned toward that, too. But a first production is a director's first draft. Michael and I were reinvigorated about going back and approaching it fresh."
Which, they decided, meant recasting, even Mr.
Frechette's role.
Mr.
Greenberg says all four actors in the cast were sent letters late last week breaking the news.
"It was artistic selfishness to recast," he says.
"No one did anything wrong." Victor Latino, Mr.
Frechette's agent, says he was unaware of the decision and had no comment.
Mr.
Greenberg is also busy with "Pal Joey," the Rodgers and Hart musical, for which he has rewritten the book.
Jujamcyn Theaters will present a reading directed by David Warren on Feb. 13 and 14 with Burke Moses and Judy Blazer.
Singing the Bradys' Praises
The theater could use a few more promoters like Ron Delsener.
The rock impresario, who has presented everyone from Simon and Garfunkel in Central Park to the Rolling Stones at Shea Stadium, is also the executive producer of "The Real Live Brady Bunch" at the Village Gate, in which scripts of the hit television show are presented as theater.
Recent ads have quoted Mr.
Delsener saying, "Absolutely the hippest, most hilarious show I've ever seen." The other person quoted in the ad is one Paula Vasallo, who happens to be Mr.
Delsener's secretary.
"I figure I have good taste, so I can tell people to go," he says.
"The 70's are very in right now. And I don't really care about critics. We did a survey and found that most of the people who come to the show are there through word of mouth. One review called it a bunch of drivel. So I used that in an ad that ran in college newspapers, and it sold. Kids love camp." Mr.
Delsener is betting they will love it in Los Angeles, too.
He and MCA are to co-produce a "Brady" show there in April.


Profits Post 18.1% Rise At Johnson
Buoyed by strong sales gains in pharmaceutical, professional and consumer products, Johnson &amp; Johnson said yesterday that profits in the final quarter of 1991 rose 18.1 percent, to $274 million, or 83 cents a share, on $3.15 billion in worldwide sales.
Net income in the final 1990 quarter was $232 million, or 70 cents a share, on $2.79 billion in sales.
For all of 1991, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the world's largest health-care company, said net earnings were a record $1.46 billion, or $4.39 a share, up from $1.14 billion in 1990, when the company wrote off $125 million, after taxes, on Latin American operations, primarily in Argentina.
Excluding the one-time charge, 1990 profits were $1.27 billion, or $3.81 a share, and the 1991 gain was 15.2 percent.


Time to Rethink National Policies on Race; Created the Problem
To the Editor:
From "Race and Crime: Let's Talk Sense" (Op-Ed, Jan. 13), it appears Barney Frank still doesn't get it.
Average Americans, especially conservatives, condemn liberal Democrats for being soft on crime because they perceive them as having helped create the problem.
Welfare, a liberal concept, has unfortunately helped destroy the black family in the inner city by acting as surrogate father.
There doesn't appear to be any incentive to stop births out of wedlock, which statistically appears to be the single greatest cause of poverty and its consequential criminal behavior.
Some of the solutions are going to be punitive and that, of course, is anathema to liberals.

THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats; Democrats Anxiously Monitor Clinton's Strength
These are jittery days for the Democrats, as they monitor the vital signs of Gov.
Bill Clinton's campaign and watch the horizon for signs of a new candidate.
One Democrat on Capitol Hill described it as "CNN emotions," the unending ripples of political anxiety in the party since a supermarket tabloid leveled accusations that Mr.
Clinton conducted a 12-year affair with a cabaret singer.


H. Gregg Lewis, 77, Theorist in Economics
H.
Gregg Lewis, a leader in modern labor economics, died last Saturday at his home in Chapel Hill, N.C., after a long illness.
He was 77 years old.
For 36 years beginning in 1939, Dr.
Lewis taught at the University of Chicago, where he was long the director of the graduate program in economics.
He was considered a principal member of the monetarist, free-market-oriented Chicago school of economics and was known among other things for his writings on labor supply and the impact of unions.


Reviews/Film; Spying and Strudel As Part of War Effort
In the elaborate wartime drama "Shining Through," Melanie Griffith plays Linda Voss, a secretary-turned-spy who cooks her way into the heart of the Third Reich.
This undoubtedly marks the first time in film history that a spy's career has been advanced by the fact that she makes great strudel.
Actually, Linda is not yet a spy at the time of the strudel incident.
But she is well on her way.
Hired by the formidable lawyer Ed Leland (Michael Douglas), of whom it is said that "he runs through secretaries like a bowling ball through tenpins," Linda quickly makes the right impression by raising questions about the letters Ed dictates.
When he makes reference to "sea birds," Linda has a funny feeling that he means submarines.
"Naturally, it set a girl's mind to wondering," she remarks in voice-over.
So Linda speaks up, expressing her suspicions in the kind of kittenish, bitsy-voiced manner that guarantees she will wind up in bed with Ed.
And, thanks to this film's earnest silliness and its high-gloss Hollywood romanticism, it's also guaranteed that the bedroom scene will feature torrential rain at the window and a blazing fire in the hearth.
Less predictable, perhaps, is the fact that Ed's involvement in American intelligence operations in Germany will induce Linda to try out a secret mission of her own.
The strudel, delivered fervently to Ed's door in the middle of the night, is Linda's way of assuring him that she can pass for a Nazi chef and is ready to be sent to Germany.
"Shining Through," written and directed by David Seltzer, is based on Susan Isaacs's better and much longer novel.
In Ms.
Isaacs's version, a zesty, wisecracking Linda marries her wealthy employer, John, after a torrid affair, while also attracting the eye of Ed Leland, John's partner and former father-in-law.
Only after the marriage fails does Linda gravitate toward Ed and decide to take up spying, partly out of disappointment and partly as a show of real courage.
Unlike the movie's cream-puff heroine, she bothers to get some O.S.S. training before taking on the job.
The film, which eliminates all this background and thus loses much of Linda's motivation, also lacks the snap and wryness of Ms.
Isaacs's story.
Most of its comic moments -- like the point at which Linda, dismissed by one Nazi for her lousy cooking, is immediately hired by another as a nanny -- appear unintentional.
Even when Mr.
Seltzer deliberately invokes Hollywood cliches, as he does with a "Casablanca"-style airport-runway parting between the lovers, his dialogue is a shade too sincere for ironic distance.
"But Ed," wails Linda, "what's a war for if not to hold onto what we love?"
What indeed.
This
war, at least in the film's terms, is for introducing Linda to a number of glamorous Germans and making her so impress them that one declares "Mein Gott, you've got guts!" It's also for embroiling her in intrigue that eventually leaves her making a middle-of-the- night escape in cloak and evening dress, Cinderella style.
The ultimate purpose of her exploits, and the device that frames the film's extended flashback, is becoming so important that she can appear, sporting a dignified hairdo and liver spots, as an honored guest on a television talk show.
Heroism need no longer be its own reward.
"Shining Through" could easily have been more spirited.
But it's still fun, in an extravagant, hopelessly retrograde fashion.
Ms.
Griffith's wispy working girl and Mr.
Douglas's sexy, sourpuss executive both seem derived from other, better films, but they play reasonably well in this setting.
However, Mr.
Seltzer's insistence on recalling other films both through Linda, who is a big movie fan, and through visual allusions almost never works to his advantage.
Brightening up the proceedings in "Shining Through" are John Gielgud as Linda's gruff, supercilious German contact; Joely Richardson as the young German society woman with whom Linda achieves a feeling of instant sisterhood, and Liam Neeson, as the unmarried Nazi officer with the bad judgment to give Linda her second job.
There are also such memorable touches as Linda's effort to leave a secret message inside a fish, her uncanny good luck at negotiating padlocks and locating secret documents, and her startling discovery of Nazi regalia in an acquaintance's closet.
When "Shining Through" has a bombshell to deliver, its touch is seldom light.
"Shining Through" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).
It includes brief nudity as well as some profanity and violence.

U.S. Allowed Some High-Tech Sales to Iran in '90
The Commerce Department approved the sale of $59 million worth of high-technology equipment to Iran during a 13-month period in 1990-91 despite other agencies' concerns about Iran's record of supporting terrorists and developing nuclear weapons.
An internal Commerce Department list of the approvals shows 90 contracts that received export licenses, even though the department has a policy of denying export licenses for the shipment of many of the products to Iran.
The products on the list include scientific measuring gear for electrical and telecommunications equipment, several types of computers, gyroscopes and oscilloscopes for measuring electrical currents.


Gannett's Net Down by 17%
The Gannett Company the nation's biggest newspaper chain and publisher of USA Today, said today that fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for 1991 tumbled, mainly because of slumping advertising revenues.
Fourth-quarter earnings of $97 million, or 68 cents a share, were down 17 percent from the $117.3 million, or 74 cents a share, earned a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter revenue was $901.2 million, down from $904.6 million in the year-earlier period.


Review/Art; Paley's Gift, a Paean To French Masters
"THE WILLIAM S. PALEY COLLECTION," which opens Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, places before the public for the first time an extraordinary private collection.
Its nearly 80 paintings, drawings and sculpture, the best of them by French modern masters, also constitute the most significant gift the museum has received in recent years.
On the short list of the high points of the Paley gift, which a museum spokeswoman termed "priceless," are Picasso's "Boy Leading a Horse" of 1905-06, a landmark on the artist's path to maturity, as well as paintings by Gauguin and Andre Derain that strengthen the museum's Post-Impressionist and Fauvist holdings.
In addition, a 1927 Matisse portrait becomes the museum's first real masterpiece from the artist's Nice period.

U.S. SHIFTS POLICY ON HAITIAN EXILES
In a shift in policy on Haitian exiles, the Bush Administration said today that beginning immediately Haitians will be able to apply for refugee status at the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince for direct resettlement in the United States.
The procedure, being used for the first time in peacetime for a non-Communist country, makes Haitians who believe they are in danger of persecution eligible for a new category of legal immigration.
The United States has similar programs only in Vietnam, Cuba and the former Soviet Union.


At the Bar; New York's Outstanding Young Lawyer Has Been Young and Outstanding For a Long Time
This week, when the New York State Bar Association announced its outstanding young lawyer for 1992, one might have thought some typographical gremlin was at work.
The winner is 63 years old.
The proofreader was not asleep.
Under the association's rules, lawyers are deemed "young" if they are either under the age of 37 or have practiced for fewer than 10 years.
In this sense Ree Adler, a legal aid lawyer in Buffalo who began her legal career in 1983, won with two years to spare.


Review/Photography; The City of Light At Night in the 30's
Ilse Bing's photographs from the 1920's and 30's, now on view in a delightful exhibition at the Houk Friedman Gallery on the Upper East Side, reveal an artist acutely tuned in to the rich European photographic milieu of the period.
Now 92 years old, Ms.
Bing has lived a remarkably full life.
Born and raised in Frankfurt, she studied art history before turning to photography.
In 1929, she bought an early model of the Leica, the miniature camera that revolutionized photojournalism in the next decade, and she was soon photographing for Frankfurter Illustrierte and other magazines.
In 1930, Ms.
Bing moved to Paris and embarked on an extraordinarily prolific career, working for such legendary magazines as Vu and Arts et Metiers Graphiques, while joining in the heady photographic experiments of the Surrealists and others.
She developed the process of solarization independently of Man Ray, the best-known practitioner of the technique, and applied it with striking results to photographs taken at night.
In addition, she regularly undertook fashion assignments for Harper's Bazaar and Schiaparelli.

Shuttle Lands in Desert After Smooth Mission
After eight days spent conducting zero-gravity experiments, the crew of the space shuttle Discovery touched down safely today, completing a mission that officials called one of the smoothest in the history of the shuttle program.
Under clear, windless skies, Col.
Ronald J. Grabe of the Air Force, the mission commander, landed the spacecraft at 8:07 A.M., Pacific standard time, to cheers from a crowd estimated by officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at 18,500.
The flight was the 45th for the shuttle program and the first of eight missions planned for this year.


Economic Scene; The Basic Conflict In Budget Policy
IN his State of the Union Message, President Bush highlighted the key problem facing budget and fiscal policy: that the American economy's short-term needs and long-term requirements are in conflict.
"We must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy," he said.
"And then we need a long-term plan to keep the combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy."


New Michelob Spots Seek Wider Appeal
The night used to belong to Michelob. Now, it is claiming the days.
An advertising campaign created for the struggling Anheuser-Busch brand by its new agency, D'Arcy, Masius, Benton &amp; Bowles in St.
Louis, carries the theme "Some days are better than others."


Hidden Costs in a Military Cutback
President Bush's plans to cut military spending by deferring production of newly designed weapons may result in serious delays and higher costs when they are actually built, manufacturing specialists say.
The "design now, build later" approach that is being proposed by the Defense Department aims to save 35 to 45 percent of the cost of new weapons by designing them and building test models, but delaying production until they are actually needed.
The idea is to keep American weapons technology at the cutting edge without spending billions for unnecessary hardware, Defense Department officials have said.

China said today that it would be willing to discuss reducing its nuclear arsenal only after the United States and Russia had scaled down their stockpiles of nuclear weapons to China's level.
The statement, by a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Duan Jin, seemed to dismiss a call by the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, for France, Britain and China to reduce their stockpiles of weapons in response to disarmament steps by the United States and Russia.

THE FEDERAL BUDGET: Incentives; Businesses Want Broader Measures for Research
President Bush's proposed budget contains several notable incentives to spur research and development and improve the nation's competitiveness, many executives said today.
But it stops short of the full-fledged effort that many business leaders say the nation needs.
The budget would increase Federal research and development expenditures, particularly for nonmilitary research in such areas as computers and biotechnology.
There are also some tax incentives for industrial spending on research and new equipment, but experts say these measures would have only a modest impact.


Time to Sing Plan B Blues: Looked Over and Left Out
Two years ago, Brad Edwards felt the way most National Football League players do when they learn that they have not been protected by their teams under Plan B, the system that attempts to allow more player movement.
"I was shocked," said Edwards, a Minnesota Viking then, a Washington Redskin now.
"I was such a young player and a relatively high draft pick. I knew I had been injured and missed a lot of playing time in Minnesota. I was thinking, 'They don't believe I'm any good. They don't want me.'


Mere Plug at the Wire's End: In England, That's Progress
As Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher set herself the goal of transforming Britain into a consumer society where the customer was king from a producer society where people had to tolerate poor products and service.
Britain may have greatly changed under Mrs.
Thatcher and her successor, John Major.
But as grumbling Britons love to attest, there is still a way to go.
Take electrical products: go into a store to buy an iron, lamp or toy train, and if you're lucky, the sales clerk will ask if you want a plug.
Many electrical products in Britain are still sold without plugs.


THE FEDERAL BUDGET: The Overview; Mood of Compromise Prevails on Election-Year Budget
President Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, went to Capitol Hill today to begin the yearly ritual of negotiating with Congress over the President's tax and spending proposals, amid indications that both sides might be willing to strike some compromises in this election year.
Several Democrats welcomed Mr.
Bush's proposal to impose some type of overall limit on the growth of Federal benefit programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
Mr.
Darman indicated that the Administration would consider some changes in the budget agreement of 1990, which severely restricts the ability of Congress to shift money from one category of spending to another.


EXECUTIVE CHANGES
*
ABC Television Network, New York, promoted Lawrence S. Fried to executive vice president and general sales manager from vice president for news sales; Robert J. Cagliero to executive vice president and national sales manager from vice president for special program sales, and James F. Wasilko to senior vice president for prime-time sales from vice president for sports sales.
All are new positions. *
American Health Properties Inc., Los Angeles, said Robert L. B. Diener, president and chief operating officer, had assumed the additional title of chief executive.
He succeeds Walter J. McNerney, who remains chairman.


Diner's Journal
Lebanese Traditions
Bright, boldly seasoned and salubrious fare -- at bargain prices -- is the appeal of the year-old Al Bustan, a cheerful little Lebanese restaurant on Third Avenue at 50th Street in Manhattan.
The owner, Elias Ghafary, used to manage the Al-Amir on Second Avenue, which closed recently.
When you are seated, the table is set in Lebanese tradition with a head of Romaine lettuce, olives, pickled turnips and other condiments.
Mr.
Ghafary is a most cordial and exuberant host.


Coca-Cola's Earnings and Stock Climb
The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit had risen 22 percent, driven by strong sales overseas and a pickup of sales in the United States, and its stock jumped nearly 8 percent.
The company also said it planned to recommend a 2-for-1 stock split to its board at its February meeting.
The split, if approved, is expected to be effective in April or May.


Haughey Resigns as Irish Prime Minister
Besieged by allegations of scandal, Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey announced his retirement today, ending an era of Irish politics he dominated for more than a decade.
One of the most imposing figures in the 70 years of Ireland's independence, Mr.
Haughey was finally felled by recurrent attacks on him for corruption among his friends and acquaintances and the revival of a 1982 scandal involving government tapping of journalists' telephones.

Fiscal Balancing Act; Dinkins Is Seeking to Keep City Livable And Still Hold Line on Budget Costs
As Mayor David N. Dinkins explained it, his preliminary budget is as remarkable for what it would not do as for what it would do.
It would not cut hospitals, or police officers, or libraries.
It would not raise real estate tax rates, or city workers' wages -- unless there are improvements in productivity.
Gone are the Mayor's dire threats of last year to close the Central Park Zoo, darken street lamps and drain pools.
Gearing up for re-election at the midpoint of his term, Mr.
Dinkins tried a new approach: a sobersided smorgasbord of cost-saving proposals, stretched out over four years, coupled with a pledge that he would only be pushed so far.
Job and Program Cuts
"That's the challenge we face," the Mayor said.
"To make sure our government is not bigger than its checkbook, but maintains and in some cases even expands the core services that make this city a livable, humane place for the eight million people who have the privilege to call it home."


Topics of The Times; A Socially Significant Centennial
One hundred years ago tomorrow, Mrs.
Astor held a ball that lives in legend as the genesis of "the 400" -- the certified upper crust of New York society.
While there were several Mrs.
Astors in that era, married to heirs of John Jacob Astor, Mrs.
William Backhouse Astor Jr.'s calling card said only "MRS . ASTOR ." She was it.
The confection of a specific 400 was the work of one Ward McAllister, a social lion who attached himself to Mrs.
Astor as arranger and chief promoter.
For the ball on Feb. 1, 1892, she asked him to cut her guest list to 400 because, she said, only 400 people would fit comfortably into the ballroom of her Fifth Avenue mansion.


Accord and Discord On the Bush Budget
As the White House began the annual ritual of negotiating with Congress over the President's budget proposals, there were indications that the two sides might be willing to strike some compromises.
But on his tax proposals specifically, Democrats and Republicans were busy firing salvos at each other.
Democrats said their analysis showed that the plan would provide a windfall for the rich, and Republicans offered their counter-analysis.

Daniel Parker, 66; Ex-Parker Pen Chief Led Helicopter Firm
Daniel Parker, a leader in business and government and the former head of his family's Parker Pen Company, died Tuesday at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.
He was 66 years old and lived in Wadmalaw Island, S.C.
Mr.
Parker died of complications during bone surgery, said Gaylan Crowell, a vice president and director of marketing for Omniflight Helicopters, a company founded by Mr.
Parker.
Omniflight, one of the largest helicopter maintenance companies in the country, is based in Charleston.

Time to Rethink National Policies on Race
To the Editor:
In "Race and Crime: Let's Talk Sense" (Op-Ed, Jan. 13), Representative Barney Frank cleverly attempts to deflect criticism of the liberal Democratic record of silence and rationalization on black street crime.
But his argument for candor -- insisting that liberals, like sensible Americans of all races, condemn violent crime by black Americans -- would make of liberal blindness a mere exaggerated politeness.
Mr.
Frank fears that the liberal social agenda of welfare, public housing, job quotas and other set-asides intended to help poor blacks "comes to look like a form of sophisticated bribery," a pay-off against violence.
This disingenuous response reveals the extent of the liberal distortion of race in politics generally.


Creating a New Outlook Through Neediest Cases
In Annette J.'s gloomy apartment, sheets hang from the windows in place of curtains, roaches scurry up and down the wall and the open oven provides much of the heat.
But the Brooklyn woman said: "I am much better off today than I was a couple of years ago. I am also a lot happier."
Life may be hard now, but Annette J. can remember greater deprivations and years of cruelty.
The 21-year-old woman is looking ahead to a better future, in large part because of the help she has begun to receive in recent years from a Brooklyn charity: counseling, emergency food when times are tough and day-care services for her 4-year-old son when she has appointments.


Yeltsin, in Britain, Warns Of Peril of Russian Unrest
At a stopover on his way to the United Nations, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia warned today that his country could collapse into "general unrest" and authoritarian rule if its economic reforms failed, and appealed for continued help from Western countries.
He left with broad promises, but not with much that he could take to the bank, just like the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, last July, after his meeting with leaders of the world's seven most powerful industrial democracies.


Yeltsin's Ambiguity Persists: Democrat Who Rules by Fiat
Seven months since he became President of Russia and seven weeks since he led the dismantling of the Soviet Union, Boris N. Yeltsin remains an ambiguous and complex figure: a democrat who rules by decree, a populist who risks draconian reform, a public politician who defies easy classification.
Making his first visit to America as head of an independent Russia and heir to the atomic weapons of the Kremlin, he still carries traces of the clumsiness and inexperience that marked his first forays abroad.


DuPont Awards Given For Gulf War Coverage
Four separate broadcast news organizations won awards for coverage of the Persian Gulf war in the annual Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University awards in broadcast journalism, which were announced yesterday.
Silver Batons were awarded to Peter Jennings and ABC News for their "Line in the Sand" specials before the gulf war and for a children's special about the war; to Peter Arnett of CNN for his individual reporting during the war; to National Public Radio for its war coverage, and to a Dallas television station, WFAA, for its special war coverage.


Dow Rebounds by 19.90 And Closes at 3,244.86
Stock prices displayed some resilience yesterday, rebounding from the sharp selloff the previous day, but some analysts said the market was showing signs of weakness.
After a 47-point drop on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 19.90 to finish at 3,244.86.
Analysts said the bounce was typical after a big selloff, and some said they expected a pullback, adding that when the Dow set a record on Tuesday other indexes lagged behind.


California Prosecutor Investigates Breast-Implant Maker's Managers
The Los Angeles County District Attorney today opened a criminal investigation of managers at the nation's leading manufacturer of silicone breast implants, the Dow Corning Wright Corporation.
Acting under a year-old California law, investigators will seek to learn if company managers knowingly concealed information about dangers of silicone implants, said District Attorney Ira Reiner.
If found guilty, individual managers could be jailed for up to three years and the company could be fined $1 million, Mr.
Reiner said.

Cairo Journal; A Play Pillories Arabs, Yet the Arabs Applaud
A savage satire of the Middle East, portraying Arabs as hypocritical and unwilling to accept the notion that their governments and mores are bankrupt, has shattered the norms of Arab theater and broken several social taboos.
The production, "In Plain Arabic" by Lenin al-Ramly, ridicules Middle East culture and politics, showing Arabs chanting slogans rather than discussing differences and blaming "Zionist, Western imperialism" for all their problems.

Mayor's Proposal Would Raise Many Fees
Besides cutting services and raising new taxes on gasoline, cars and commuters' incomes, Mayor David N. Dinkins's budget proposal would also depend on new or higher fees for everything from picking up some doctors' trash to testing blood and urine specimens in city laboratories.
For the first time, the city would charge professionals with offices in residential buildings for picking up refuse that is now collected free as part of household trash.
The rates would range from $328 a year for someone dumping one to five bags a week to $1,172 a year for those throwing out 16 to 20 bags a week.
The offices could choose to hire a private trash collector instead of paying the city fees.


Higher-Denomination Coins Match Real Prices in Russia
Russia plans to introduce coins and bills in higher denominations because of the leap in consumer prices, a central bank official was quoted today as saying.
Arnold Voilukov, vice president of Gosbank, the central bank of the former Soviet Union, told the newspaper Trud that Russia planned to introduce 20-ruble coins in April.
The highest-denomination coin now in circulation is one ruble, worth about one cent at the Russian central bank's market rate.


Federal Agents Seize Etchings as Fakes
In one of the largest seizures of counterfeit art, Federal law enforcement agents have taken custody of 75,000 prints that were supposedly produced by Chagall, Dali, Miro and Picasso, it was announced yesterday at a news conference at the General Post Office at 33d Street and Eighth Avenue, Manhattan.
Federal officials also filed a complaint in Federal District Court in Brooklyn charging the owners of the prints, Original Artworks Ltd. of Island Park, L.I., with having sold several million dollars worth of fake limited-edition lithographs, etchings and aquatints to galleries throughout the United States and Europe.


MAYO CLINIC IS SITE OF MURDER-SUICIDE
A psychiatrist visiting from Iowa walked into a friend's hospital room at the Mayo Medical Center complex in Rochester, Minn., early today and apparently shot the man to death as he lay on his bed, the authorities said.
The doctor then put the gun in his mouth and killed himself.
The two men had lived together on the grounds of a public mental hospital in Cherokee, Iowa, where the psychiatrist, Dr.
Ralph D. Laskey, taught, attended to patients and oversaw a 208-bed chemical dependency unit.


Pop/Jazz; A Drummer Rummages In Be-Bop Repertory
Paul Motian's drumming steams ahead only to slow down.
At times it seems as if his musical ideas break apart, falling into non-linear fragments; there's a sense of abstraction there that most drummers working in jazz simply don't have.
His style has aligned Mr.
Motian, who is bringing in a new band at the Knitting Factory tonight, with various avant-gardists over the years, from Bill Evans's legendary and empathetic trio of the late 1950's to groups with the pianist Geri Allen and the bassist Charlie Haden to his own bands with the guitarist Bill Frisell and the saxophonist Joe Lovano.

In Alabama, Blacks Battle For the Authority to Govern
Thanks largely to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Alabama has 706 black elected officials, more than any other state in the nation.
But when two of them, Russell County Commissioners Ed Mack and Nathaniel Gosha, lost an appeal citing that law to the United States Supreme Court this week, it raised a vexing question: Can the law guarantee the right to govern in the same way it protects the right to vote?


Medical Aid for Palestinian Stirs a Brouhaha in France

Andiamo, an Italian restaurant near Lincoln Center, added jazz to its menu at the end of December and the music has proved to be distinctive.
This weekend and all next week, Monday through Saturday, the music will be served up by the saxophonist Bob Kindred and the guitarist Gene Bertoncini, a provocative teaming.
Mr.
Kindred is an exciting summation and extension of the great Swing Era saxophonists, and Mr.

They are supported on bass by Sean Smith tonight and tomorrow.
Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9:15 and 10:30, with an added set at midnight tomorrow.

What Cable TV Is Trying to Do and Why You Should Care
To the Editor:
As Joshua Siderowitz notes in "Cable Company Adds Hidden Cost to the Bill" (letter, Dec. 27), installing individual descrambling cable channel selectors is only the first step in increasing the cost of cable television to the consumer.
This device will eventually permit a cable company to scramble every signal delivered to a consumer.
This will facilitate multiple-tier pricing, with "basic" service consisting only of local broadcasters and extra charges for satellite services ("expanded basic"), traditionally included in "basic" (CNN, ESPN, TBS, Nickelodeon).
Charges for "expanded basic" may then be increased with less scrutiny and resistance than increases in the new "basic" service.

Report to Dinkins Urges Overhaul In Shelter System for the Homeless
A mayoral commission is recommending a sweeping overhaul of New York City's troubled shelter system, including rent subsidies to help the homeless pay for housing.
The rent vouchers, which would allow the city to take advantage of the surplus of rental apartments on the market, would be a significant shift in how government houses the homeless and would be part of a new approach advanced by the commission.


Review/Music; Picking Performances Apart for the Public
It might have seemed to a casual observer just an accumulation of detail.
At a master class conducted by Hermann Prey on Wednesday night as part of this week's Schubertiade at the 92d Street Y, the baritone's corrections to three young singers performing some of Schubert's Goethe songs were often specialized and precise.
"More accent," he would say in his own accented English, or "more bright." In the German word sehe (see), he would suggest "take more time for the S," or "in 'Wasser' make it a long W." "In rhythm!" he would urge, clapping.
Or he would patiently define the precise sound of the German O with an umlaut.
But while searching for the right expressive words, while singing in illustration, while gesturing in air or while approaching the accompanist and coaxing him into a phrase, Mr.
Prey was also revealing something else.
Watching him graciously dissect a performance was as remarkable an experience as listening to him put one together.


Russian Vice President Wants to Redraw Borders
In a nationalist broadside published today in the newspaper Pravda, Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi of Russia said he would take up the cause of Russia's "historical conscience" and seek a redrawing of borders that would reflect a "glorious page" in the nation's past.
Although Mr.
Rutskoi did not mention the Crimean Peninsula directly, his latest statement -- another in a series that have put distance between him and his old running mate, President Boris N. Yeltsin -- threatens to sharpen an emotional issue that lies at the heart of a dispute between Russia and Ukraine.


Big Loss at UAL; $2 Billion in Cuts Planned
The UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, reported a loss for the fourth quarter yesterday that doubled that of the quarter a year earlier, and said it would cut capital spending by $2 billion over three years to strengthen its balance sheet.
United's loss was $252.6 million, compared with a loss of $123.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1990.
But UAL's shares rose $5.125, to $144.50, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, as Wall Street was generally pleased with the planned cuts.


Review/City Ballet; A Premiere Having Fun With Mozart
"DELIGHT OF THE MUSES," the New York City Ballet's long-awaited premiere choreographed by Peter Martins to a commissioned score by Charles Wuorinen, is a joke.
No, not a mistake, although some might disagree.
What Mr.
Wuorinen -- one of the most decorated figures in contemporary American music -- had in mind is a deliberate musical joke, incorporating a presumably serious tribute to Mozart.


Leonard Raver, 65, an Organist For the New York Philharmonic

He died of AIDS, said George Cree, his companion.

Yankees Stand By Howe, Inviting Him to Promotion
Steve Howe, the Yankee relief pitcher who faces a possible permanent suspension from baseball after being arrested last month in Montana on cocaine-possession charges, will join his teammates today at a promotional function in Manhattan that is expected to underline the team's support for the pitcher.
The 33-year-old Howe has been suspended from major league baseball six times for drug and alcohol abuse.
He would be likely to be suspended a seventh and final time if he is found guilty of the two Federal misdemeanor charges brought against him by Montana authorities after the arrest on Dec. 19 in Kalispell, Mont., near Howe's off-season home.
Daily Contact With Official
Howe, who is not permitted to leave Flathead County without permission from Jerrold Cooley of pretrial services, has been allowed to attend the Yankee fan festival at the Javits Center.
But he has been in almost daily contact with Cooley, who serves in the same capacity as a probation officer would for a convicted criminal.


A Better City Spending Plan
Mayor David Dinkins's new financial plan for New York City is a welcome step in the right direction -- toward the kind of lasting reforms that might finally bring the budget into long-term balance.
Even so, it has flaws that need to be addressed if the city is to have a credible fiscal policy to help it through this recession.
What's very right about the plan is its heart.
Despite painful cuts, it doesn't sacrifice day care, infant mortality programs, full-day kindergarten or other efforts aimed at helping those most vulnerable.

Influx From Ex-Soviet Lands Falling, Israel Says
As Israel presses the United States for loan guarantees to cope with a projected huge influx of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, officials here said today that the immigrant flow this month had sunk to its lowest in almost two years and could dwindle even further.
Jewish Agency officials attributed the reduced flow of immigrants to the acute difficulties facing those who have already arrived, cannot find jobs or decent homes and write back to friends and relatives in the former Soviet Union chronicling their tribulations.

TVWeekend; Jessica Lange as Willa Cather Heroine
Taking a cue from Glenn Close's triumph in "Sara, Plain and Tall," Jessica Lange has decided to do her own "Hallmark Hall of Fame" movie, and with the same director, Glenn Jordan.
Her vehicle is Robert W. Lenski's adaptation of Willa Cather's "O Pioneers!" It's on CBS at 9 P.M. on Sunday.
Although under 200 pages, "O Pioneers!" encompasses a sprawling story of immigrants settling in Nebraska in the final decades of the last century.
Cather's own father, of Scottish-Irish stock, moved his family from Virginia to Nebraska in 1883 when she was 9 years old.


Clinton's Private Life Serves as Distraction
To the Editor:
The surge in interest in the personal life of Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who is campaigning for the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination, shows a disturbing trend in American politics.
All too often, the American public seems to identify a politician's competence or suitability for elected office with his or her personal life.
This unfortunate penchant for sensationalism, which much of the news media feed on, denigrates the political process and eclipses the pressing issues.
There is little evidence in history to support the view that with moral piety comes political effectiveness.
Winston Churchill, one of the great statesmen of the 20th century, was certainly no icon of piety.
His taste for liquor was well known.
John F. Kennedy's personal exploits did not prevent his rise to the highest elected office and place in history.


The Word's Turn: Urban Poets Re-emerge
A CREWCUT young woman, wearing only black, intones with a sultry, hypnotizing voice: "You moan with/the insanity of such/raw miraculous movements." The poem she is reading this night -- her own -- proceeds to describe an overwhelming sexual encounter.
The crowd at the nightclub cheers when she finishes, and then 5 audience judges rate her effort: she averages an 8, on a scale of 0 to 10.
A gangly young man prone to arm flails, her competitor in a surreal contest called a Poetry Slam, counters with a string of non sequiturs loosely tied to American malaise: "Zombies do well in an addictive society/. . . The Pope will let you kiss his ring but he won't let you wear his hat." His scores run from a 7.9 to a 10.
As the winner, he receives the $10 grand prize; but not before the contest host makes sure to remind the listeners that "the best poet always loses."


At the Movies
Recalling Dr. Lecter
On the one hand, Ted Tally was listening to a famous Hollywood producer.
On the other, he was thinking of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
"I thought he was crazy," Mr. Tally said. "Not Lecter. The producer."
Mr.
Tally is a screenwriter.
Dr.
Lecter is a homicidal psychopath created by the novelist Thomas Harris.
The topic of the discussion between Mr.
Tally and the producer was Mr.
Harris's novel "The Silence of the Lambs," in which Lecter figures prominently.
The producer had just finished telling Mr.
Tally that the book would never be made into a movie.
Why?
"Because so much of the impact of Lecter in the book is in his mental processes and his thoughts and reflections, which, of course, you can't really dramatize in the movie," Mr.
Tally recalled.
By now everyone knows that "The Silence of the Lambs," directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Anthony Hopkins as Lecter and Jodie Foster as a young F.B.I. trainee named Clarice Starling, not only became a movie, but also one of the major hits of 1991.
Mr.
Tally wrote the screenplay.
Discussing his adaptation of the tense, eerie relationship between Lecter and Starling, who is hunting for a serial killer named Gumb, Mr.
Tally said: "A sort of streamlining always goes on in an adaptation -- eliminating minor characters, creating new transition scenes, changing the scene order, inventing new dialogue. But probably the most important single choice in this adaptation was trying to eliminate the multiple points of view."
"The book goes inside the minds not just of Clarice Starling, but of Lecter, of Gumb, the killer she is pursuing, and of Jack Crawford, her mentor at the F.B.I.," Mr.
Tally said.
"I thought really that the entire story had to concentrate on Clarice, that every scene had to concentrate as much as possible on what she is seeing and what she is feeling and what she is thinking. The heart of the story was between Clarice and Lecter, that strange sexual power struggle, that chess game between this young woman and this man -- this monster."
"The Silence of the Lambs" attracted popular and critical acclaim when it opened early last year.
It also attracted a number of accolades at the year's end, including the New York Film Critics Circle awards for best picture, best director, best actor and best actress.
And the film has left its mark on the career of Mr.
Tally, also a television and stage writer whose film credits also include "White Palace."
"It's been a complete sea change, I guess," he said, reminiscing about "The Silence of the Lambs." "I got more than 100 offers for other projects in the months before it opened and after it opened."
He has completed a script for Orion called "Nice Work," based on a novel by David Lodge that Mr.
Tally describes as "a kind of Tracy-and-Hepburn story for the 90's -- an unlikely sort of love story between a feminist professor and a sort of middle-management industrialist."
And he is starting work on the screenplay of "Before and After," a forthcoming Rosellen Brown novel .
"It's a very intense, powerful family drama," Mr.
Tally said, adding that Barbet Schroeder is to direct.
And there's one other thing.
"In the back of my mind," Mr.
Tally said, "I know that Tom Harris is finishing a sequel to 'The Silence of the Lambs.' "
Is Mr. Tally ready for another session with Dr. Lecter?
"I know everyone connected with this movie," he said of "Silence," "would sign up again tomorrow to do another if given a chance." A Busy Barkin
Ellen Barkin is heading off to Vancouver and romance with Robert De Niro.
We're talking movies here, not real life.
The busy Ms.
Barkin's latest project is the role of Caroline, the mother, in "This Boy's Life."
"It's great material, which I think is all too rare, and also a wonderful woman's role, which is even rarer," Ms.
Barkin said.
" 'This Boy's Life' is taken from the Tobias Wolff book, a memoir of a period of his childhood when he and his mother took a trip cross-country searching for uranium, and she wound up meeting a man from the Seattle area and ultimately married him. Basically, this movie is about this four-year period in his life, and the husband turns out not to be what he seemed."
In the film, to be directed for Warner Brothers by Michael Caton-Jones ("Doc Hollywood") and produced by Art Linson ("The Untouchables"), the husband is played by Mr.
De Niro, and the boy, in his early teens, by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Ms.
Barkin said that when the book was published in 1989, her husband, Gabriel Byrne, who starred in "Miller's Crossing," was reading it when he said, "Someone should make this into a movie, and you'd be great for the mother." Others agreed.
When Mr.
Linson and Mr.
Caton-Jones cast "This Boy's Life," they offered Ms.
Barkin the job.
She'll be in Vancouver three months.
Ms.
Barkin, whose film roles last year included the forthcoming "Into the West" with Mr.
Byrne, "Mac" with John Turturro, and "Man Trouble" with Jack Nicholson, says she knows what's next for her: "A rest." 'The Black New Wave'
Black film making will be the focus of attention at the American Museum of the Moving Image beginning Feb. 8, when a retrospective titled "The Black New Wave" will open with screenings of William Greaves's "Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One" and Charles Burnett's "To Sleep With Anger."
Also in the series, to run through Feb. 23 at the Museum in Astoria, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Queens, are as "Jungle Fever," "Straight Out of Brooklyn," "A Rage in Harlem," "Boyz N the Hood" and "A Dry White Season." Among the film makers scheduled to introduce their films are Mr.
Greaves, Reginald Hudlin, who will introduce "House Party" on Feb. 15, and James Bond 3d, who will introduce "Def by Temptation" on Feb. 23.

THE FEDERAL BUDGET: Real Estate; Developers Are Cheered by Talk of New Tax Rules That Would Offset Income With Losses
Throughout the real estate industry hopes rose this week that Congress would adopt a tax change proposed by President Bush that would aid real estate investment companies and improve market conditions generally.
The Administration's proposal would allow taxpayers active in the real estate business to offset taxable income with losses sustained in operating rental property they developed.
The losses include depreciation as well as cash operating losses.
One Executive's View
"This would help people who are in trouble, who are on the verge of foreclosure," said Stephen Driesler, senior vice president of the National Association of Realtors in Washington.
"If someone is hanging on, this may be all the equity the owner has in the property."


Review/Dance; Lubovitch Vignettes Set to Ives
Lar Lubovitch has assembled a scrapbook of American images in "American Gesture," the new work that Pacific Northwest Ballet offered on Wednesday night at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
Not all of his choreographic snapshots are equally vivid.
Nevertheless, several are witty, a few are poignant and all are pleasant to watch.
Mr.
Lubovitch's choice of music by Charles Ives was shrewd.
Ives blended iconoclasm with nostalgia, and his scores quote popular songs, marches and hymns.
Mr.
Lubovitch is equally eclectic as a choreographer.
His ability to blend genres was evident at the Kennedy Center when Dirk Platzek and Edi Akio Taketa, from his own modern-dance company, filled in for injured members of Pacific Northwest Ballet.
No stylistic discrepancies resulted.


THE FEDERAL BUDGET: The Tax Battle  Divining the Winners; Again, Parties Squabble Over Who Would Benefit From President's Plan
President Bush took pains this week to present his budget as one that would benefit Americans across the income spectrum, but it has set off a war of interpretation over which income classes would gain and by how much.
The budget ink had yet to dry before Democrats, pouncing on an issue that has helped them in the past, were criticizing the plan as another in a long line of Republican proposals that offered unfair windfalls to the rich.

North Korea Signs Accord On Atom-Plant Inspections
After years of promises and false starts, North Korea today signed a nuclear safeguards accord calling for international inspection of its nuclear plants but left it doubtful whether inspectors would gain access to the appropriate installations any time soon.
The long-awaited signing, which took place in the offices in Vienna of the International Atomic Energy Agency, was welcomed in South Korea and elsewhere.
But diplomats and nuclear experts cautioned that there were many problems standing in the way of inspections.

The Art Market
Barnes in Court
The controversial administration of the Barnes Foundation is now being legally challenged.
The assault comes in the form of a suit alleging that the trustees of the foundation, a world-renowned institution in Merion, Pa., that has a priceless collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art, have taken advantage of the foundation's assets.
The suit was filed by the De Mazia Trust, which was established by Violette de Mazia, a protegee and close companion of the founder, Dr.
Albert C. Barnes.
Miss de Mazia, who died four years ago, was a driving force in the institution, which she served as a vice president and the education director.
The Barnes Foundation, established in 1922 by Barnes, a patent-medicine manufacturer, to perpetuate his art collection and his ideas about art education, has always been considered an eccentric, exclusive institution.
Barnes, for example, was well known for refusing to allow important collectors like Walter P. Chrysler Jr. and distinguished scholars like Meyer Schapiro and Kenneth Clark to see any of his estimated 800 paintings and 200 sculptures.
Before his death in 1951, the founder made another unusual decision: he gave Lincoln University -- a small, predominantly black college 45 miles west of Merion with no track record in art education -- the power to nominate the trustees of the Barnes Foundation.
Both the foundation and its trustees made news last May when a lucrative contract was signed with Alfred A. Knopf to publish for the first time color photographs of the foundation's collection.
The holdings include 170 Renoirs, 55 Cezannes and 20 Picassos.
The deal was signed a month after the Newhouse Foundation made a $2 million donation to Lincoln University.
The head of the Newhouse Foundation, and the son of its founder, is S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of the corporation that owns Knopf.
In its petition filed on Jan. 21 in Montgomery County, Pa., the De Mazia Trust charges that the Barnes trustees used the catalogue contract as a lure for the donation to Lincoln University. (Three out of the five trustees of the Barnes Foundation are also on the board of Lincoln University, and the fourth, Richard H. Glanton, the president, is the university's general counsel.) The donation, they say, should have gone directly to the Barnes Foundation, which owns the artwork to be catalogued.
The De Mazia Trust contends that because of the contribution to Lincoln, the Barnes trustees dismissed bids made by other publishers.
They say other publishers would have given the foundation a contribution of several million dollars but that their efforts were ignored.
Mr.
Glanton's response was: "That's not true. We had four serious proposals. We asked each publisher for a minimum of a $500,000 advance and only one publisher met our request." He added that Harry N. Abrams, the New York-based publisher, submitted the "second best" proposal.
But Paul Gottlieb, the president and publisher of Abrams, denies this.
"The Barnes Foundation had no idea what they would have gotten out of us," said Mr.
Gottlieb.
Mr.
Glanton said on Wednesday that Knopf had awarded the Barnes Foundation a $750,000 advance for publishing the collection, a sum Mr.
Gottlieb called "staggering" for an art book.
He added, "I don't really believe that's what the advance is."
According to Susan D. Ralston, the editor of the catalogue at Knopf, "$750,000 is an erroneous figure."
"The real amount is a private matter between the Barnes Foundation and Knopf," Mrs.
Ralston said, adding that the contract was for two books.
The first book, a selection of the Barnes Foundation's great works, is to be in bookstores by the fall of 1993.
While Mrs.
Ralston said that no writer had been decided on, a name that keeps surfacing is that of J. Carter Brown, the director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
Mr.
Brown announced his resignation last week but is to remain in the post through this year.
The second part of the contract is a catalogue raisonne that may be published in more than one volume.
Consulting with the Barnes Foundation on the selection of art are several institutions, including the National Gallery, the French National Museums and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
After the suit concerning the book contract was filed in Montgomery County Orphans' Court by the De Mazia Trust, the Barnes Foundation asked the court to withdraw a petition it made in March to ease visiting-hour restrictions, change investment policies, raise admission fees and allow the building to be used for social functions.
But last week Louis D. Stefan, a Montgomery County judge, refused to let the foundation withdraw its suit.
Instead, the judge asked the trustees to produce the foundation's financial documents as well as minutes of its board meetings.
"The Attorney General also opposed the request to withdraw the petition," said Judge Stefan in a telephone interview.
"He wants to enable the court to look into the allegations raised by the De Mazia Trust and to resolve the serious issues currently being raised." Judge Stefan said that a hearing was tentatively scheduled for March.
Mr.
Glanton called the allegations in the suit "very regrettable," and said the foundation's books and records would be open to the court.
The de Mazia suit is the most explosive challenge to the Glanton-led board of the Barnes Foundation.
It clearly draws the line between the trustees, who want change, and Barnes loyalists, who would like to preserve the status quo.
The De Mazia Trust, along with a group of past and present students, is committed to preserving the 70-year-old foundation's emphasis on art education.
The trustees say they are trying to modernize the foundation and make its outstanding but little-known art collection available to a wider audience.
Meanwhile, the board is considering other options that would go against the very strict indenture set up by the foundation's creator.
Among the prohibitions laid down by the irascible Dr.
Barnes was a stipulation that the collection may never be moved from the present 1926 building that houses the artworks.
But the trustees would like to close the museum for renovations and send the collection on tour to other museums like the National Gallery of Art.
"It is one of the options under consideration," Mr.
Glanton said.
"But I cannot really comment any further."  A Shrinking Whitney
The Whitney Museum of American Art is losing two of its three Manhattan branches.
It has been asked to vacate by August its first-floor gallery in the Equitable Center, at Seventh Avenue and 52d Street, where the museum has been holding exhibitions for the last six years.
By the end of September, the space at 33 Maiden Lane, which has housed the Whitney's downtown gallery since 1988, will be transformed into an I.B.M. marketing and education center.
"It's another sign of the times," said David A. Ross, the director of the Whitney.
"These branches were a way of keeping more of our collection on view." Mr.
Ross also pointed out that the timing for the closings was particularly bad since the museum's expansion plans have been postponed until the economy picks up.
Since their inception, the branches have always been well attended.
During fiscal year 1991, for example, 40,000 people visited the Whitney's downtown branch; about 100,000 passed through the Equitable Center branch.
"The branches fulfilled an important purpose," said Mr.
Ross.
"The Whitney has about 10,000 works of art in its collection and even when the entire third and fourth floors are used, there may only be about 200 artworks in an installation. Without these branches, fewer people will have a chance to see the depth of of our collection."
In financial terms, Mr.
Ross said, these branches were neither a drain nor an income producer.
Admission to all of the Whitney's branches are free and corporations like Equitable Life Assurance, International Business Machines and Park Tower Realty financed their operating costs.
Equitable, as well as I.B.M. and Park Tower Realty, which jointly own the building on Maiden Lane, said each company would continue to give the museum financial support, as they have in the past.
But each corporation had different reasons for closing its branch of the Whitney: at Equitable, Mary Mannarino, the manager of public relations, said the company had decided to "support a wider number of institutions who would benefit from the good location." Ms.
Mannarino also explained that Equitable would not be making any public announcement about future exhibitions until the spring.
At the Whitney's Maiden Lane location, an award-winning space designed by the New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Paul Neuman, a media spokesman for I.B.M., said the decision to close the gallery wasn't an easy one since they were losing a mini-landmark.
"We are downsizing and shrinking our real-estate holdings," he said.
"We simply needed the space." Meanwhile, Park Tower Realty, in an effort to continue its association with the museum, is planning to help the Whitney find a new location.
"We haven't actually begun the search," said Kate Coburn, Park Tower's director of marketing.
"But we will be finding the Whitney a new downtown home."


Police Investigate Death in Custody

But several other witnesses made statements supporting the officers' conduct, a police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said.

Thomas Paine Statue Coming to Capital
To the Editor:
Readers of your Jan. 14 report from New Rochelle, N.Y., on Thomas Paine, a local hero of that Westchester County community, and on the Thomas Paine National Historical Association, should know that the "someday" when Congress may authorize a Paine statue in Washington could be sooner than they think.
One hundred eighty-eight members of the House of Representatives are co-sponsors of H.R. 1628, my bill to authorize placing a Paine statue on Federal property at no cost to the taxpayer.
The bipartisan sponsorship of the bill covers the political spectrum and constitutes a remarkable tribute to the contributions of Thomas Paine.

Shapes that flatter a woman's body and colors that are light and bright; those are the effects he is after.
He is sure that is what women want, especially today, when the idea is not to look ostentatious and when a reasonably complex style at an established couture house costs $10,000 and more.

Judge Lets Gay Partner Adopt Child
A Surrogate Court judge in Manhattan yesterday approved the adoption of a 6-year-old boy by the lesbian partner of the child's natural mother.
The decision is believed to be the first such adoption ever approved in New York State.
It comes at a time of legal attempts to provide nontraditional families greater standing in areas like housing, health insurance and child visitation.


California Closes a Bank
The California Banking Department today closed the Independence Bank of Encino, which had been secretly owned by the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Independence said the decision came as a surprise, particularly since it had received a capital infusion of $5 million under a Dec. 19 plea agreement signed between the liquidators of B.C.C.I. and Federal regulatory agencies.
A spokesman for the state banking department said the bank was closed because it was insolvent.
As of today, the bank had deposits of $530 million and assets of $555 million, the spokesman said.
For the year ended Dec. 31, 1991, Independence lost $44 million, he added.


Wilkins Has Surgery
DOMINIQUE WILKINS, the star forward of the Atlanta Hawks, should be back in action next season, his surgeon said yesterday, after Wilkins underwent surgery for a torn right Achilles' tendon he suffered in a game Tuesday.
"It went fine, looks good and looks like it ought to heal well," said Dr.
JACK HUGHSTON, who performed the one-and-a-half-hour surgery at his Hughston Sports Medicine Hospital in Columbus, Ga.


French Steelmaker Gets A-1 Rating
Usinor Sacilor, the French steelmaker, has won an A-1 rating for 10 billion French francs, about $1.8 billion, in commercial paper from Standard &amp; Poor's.
The company is owned by the French Government.
The rating service cited the steel company's cost-reduction program and above-average operating position in Europe, even though the European steel industry is highly competitive and has excess capacity.
Cash flow have been satisfactory, according to Standard &amp; Poor's.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Executive Moving On . . . and On
ANYONE still unconvinced that top executives at the nation's large advertising agencies are changing jobs at a rate rivaling professional football coaches need only consider yesterday's news about John Hayes.
One month after he was promoted to chief executive of Geer, DuBois Inc., Mr.
Hayes disclosed he would leave that New York shop, where he has been for a total of 19 months, to become president of Lowe &amp; Partners, the American operation of the London-based Lowe Group.


Producer of Costly Wines Ousts Co-Chief in Burgundy
The Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, probably the most famous wine producer in the Burgundy region of France, has ousted one of its co-directors, Lalou Bize-Leroy, in a dispute over apparently unauthorized sales of the Domaine's extraordinarily expensive wines in the "gray market" in the United States and Japan.
Aubert de Villaine, the Domaine's other co-director, said that a separate wine exporting company headed by Mrs.
Bize-Leroy was shipping the Domaine's wines to the United States through a Swiss affiliate even though it was expressly banned from selling them anywhere but in Continental Europe.


THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Journal; Now, Journalists Renege On Election Promises
It is still early in the Presidential campaign, as political analysts have repeatedly determined, but the press coverage is beginning to take a familiar shape.
In fact, this week there were two events on national television that could ultimately qualify as official defining moments.
The first, of course, was when Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas went on "60 Minutes" to make what was probably the most public confession in the history of marriage problems.
The next came Tuesday night when Mr.
Clinton's confession was analyzed -- along with questions on the economy and President Bush's understanding of the middle class -- by what was probably the largest biased sample in the history of instant polling.

Officer Says He Thought Youth Was Going to Shoot
Speaking in a steady and deliberate voice, Officer Gary Spath testified today that he shot and killed 16-year-old Phillip Pannell because he feared the youth would fire at him.
"I shot because this guy was going to shoot me," Officer Spath said.
"I believe he was reaching in -- he
was
reaching -- he went into his pocket and he was going to shoot me."

A Way to Get the Trade Deficit in Balance
To the Editor:
Now that President Bush's trade visit to the Orient has ended in disappointment, it may be time to take stronger measures to eliminate our trade deficit.
Here is a simple mechanism that could balance trade:
Each time we exported something, the buyer would receive a chit that allows the bearer to export goods of the same value to us.
These chits could be freely traded.
All imports to us would have to be accompanied by a chit for equivalent value.
The requirement of equal value would balance exports and imports.

Elizabeth Chase, 77, An Adviser to Javits 1
Elizabeth Coykendall Chase, a former campaign adviser to United States Senator Jacob K. Javits, died on Sunday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut.
She was 77 years old and lived in Stamford.
Mrs.
Chase, a writer and public relations specialist, counseled Mr.
Javits in his first successful race for the House of Representatives in 1946.
She also was public relations adviser to the New York Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization, in the 1950's.


U.N. Peace Plan for Yugoslavia Eroded by New Croatian Demand
A United Nations proposal to send peacekeeping forces to war-ravaged Croatia edged to the brink of collapse tonight after Croatian leaders demanded fundamental changes in the plan, Western diplomats said.
A complete breakdown would certainly jeopardize the flimsy four-week cease-fire that was brokered by United Nations negotiators.


THE FEDERAL BUDGET: Home Buyers; Builders Like President's Plan for Tax Credit to Bolster Housing Sales
Home builders reacted with enthusiasm to President Bush's proposal in the State of the Union address to stimulate housing sales, with the proposed $5,000 tax credit for first-time buyers getting the most applause.
"It's by far the biggest idea for residential construction," said David K. Hill Jr., president of Kimball Hill Inc., a home builder in Rolling Meadows, Ill., north of Chicago.


The U.N.'s Need: Cash for Peace
Ending 20 years of civil war in Cambodia was an extraordinary achievement.
But three months after an agreement was signed with great fanfare in Paris, the cease-fire is fraying and peacekeeping forces are not expected to be deployed before April.
The main reason for delay has been the U.N.'s worsening financial crisis.
That crisis is the most compelling issue facing the leaders gathered for today's Security Council summit meeting.
But they seem more interested in expanding the U.N.'s peacekeeping role than in paying for it.

Saints Get Pinkett
The New Orleans Saints acquired a veteran running back, ALLEN PINKETT, from the Houston Oilers yesterday in return for a fifth-round choice in the 1992 N.F.L. draft.
Pinkett, a third-round Houston draft choice out of Notre Dame in 1986, is expected to fill a need created by the retirement of REUBEN MAYES and injuries which sidelined the starting tandem of DALTON HILLIARD and CRAIG HEYWARD for much of last season.
In six seasons at Houston, Pinkett, 28, carried 567 times for 2,324 yards and rushed for 21 touchdowns.
He also caught 119 passes for 921 yards and 4 touchdowns, and last season returned 26 kickoffs for a 19.5-yard average. (AP)


Money Fund Assets Up
The assets of the nation's 587 money market mutual funds increased by $2.92 billion, to $509.75 billion, in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.
The assets of the 217 institutional funds increased $2.59 billion, to $180.37 billion.
The assets of the 281 general-purpose funds were down $107.2 million, to $180.27 billion.
The 89 broker-dealer funds decreased $437.0 million, to $149.11 billion.


Beat Back the Bloat in Defense
President Bush has adopted three splendid principles for squeezing down $300-billion-a-year defense budgets.
If only he would now follow them.
The first principle is that forces can be substantially reduced now that global threats are vastly diminished.
Second, new weapons can be designed and built -- but need not be put into full production.
Third, cooperative cuts provide a lot more security than arms competition does.
But having professed these principles, the President ignores them in practice.
He wants to retain the force structure that was drawn up before the Soviet threat disappeared.
He lets the Pentagon keep on building needless new weapons.
And he does not extend the principle of reciprocal cuts from nuclear to conventional forces.


Treasuries Lower in Light Trading
Prices of Treasury securities moved lower as interest rates rose further in light, nervous trading yesterday.
Credit market participants said the selling was a continuation of Wednesday's steep price decline, a slide apparently touched off by the suggestion by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the central bank was not likely to ease policy again soon.


Susan Kaplan Has Wedding
Susan Jo Kaplan, a mortgage broker in Carteret, N.J., and Roy J. Konray, a lawyer in Westfield, N.J., were married yesterday at their home in Westfield.
Judge Herbert Charles Kaplan of Municipal Court in East Brunswick, N.J., a brother of the bride, officiated.
Mrs.
Konray, 51 years old is the president of Investors Cooperative Mortgage Company.
She is a graduate of Kean College.
She won a gold medal in the 1976 Maccabean Games in Israel as a member of the United States Judo Team; she now teaches at the Judo Center in Cranford, N.J.
She is the daughter of Samuel and Irene Kaplan of Carteret.
Her father is the senior partner in the Carteret law firm of Kaplan, Feingold &amp; Kaplan.
Her mother is a retired kindergarten teacher.


Carnesecca Has One Wish: One in a Row
Maybe the optimistic, feel-good approach that St.
John's showed after its defeat at Georgetown on Wednesday night will translate into a successful stretch drive and the type of season the Redmen expected.
Perhaps, as Coach Lou Carnesecca has said, his team can create the kind of roll produced by the 1979 Redmen, who very nearly turned a frustrating 9-8 record into a trip to the Final Four.


Tropicana's President Gets Job Permanently
William G. Pietersen, the acting president of the Seagram Company's Tropicana unit, was formally named president of the juice company yesterday.
Mr.
Pietersen, a Seagram executive since 1988, took over at Tropicana Products Inc. in September when Tropicana's president and executive vice president were dismissed after Seagram became aware of cost overruns on several construction projects.
Mr.
Pietersen refused to discusss the incident or say whether he had introduced new financial controls at Tropicana.


Bush Budget Would Hurt Area, Officials Say
By continuing the decadelong trend of shifting the cost of social programs to the cities and states, President Bush's budget proposal would aggravate the increasingly desperate fiscal plight of the New York region, officials from the region said today.
In a rising chorus, the officials complained that the budget would give short shrift to a variety of programs they consider vital to urban areas, from mass transit to health-care costs.
