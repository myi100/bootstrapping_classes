Kelso Depot Journal; Fighting for a Desert Railroad Station
LEAD: Standing under the graceful loggia of the shuttered Union Pacific Railroad depot here, staring into the vast void that fills the desert between the lonely station and the stark Granite Mountains to the southwest, it is difficult to imagine that nearly 2,000 people lived here in World War II, mining iron ore.

The Cost of Glasses, Wrongly Magnified
LEAD: In 49 states, you can buy reading glasses without a prescription.
Why not in New York?

Question Of the Week; Should The Yankees Have Fired Billy Martin?

Because with Billy Martin gone (for now) we fans will have to be fed a steady diet of real baseball news: like hits, runs and errors.

Keith Michael Gottesdiener, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, were married last evening.


Petitioners for the Oppressed Win a Soviet Monument to Their Memory
LEAD: What they wanted was justice, written not just in words but in stone: to build a memorial showing that Stalin's victims did live, suffer and die, and to create from a past bounded by forgetfulness a future guarded by memory.


Correction
LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article about Afghanistan in The Week in review on June 19 described American aid to Pakistan, incorrectly.
Since 1981, the United States had spent or authorized more than $7 billion in aid to Pakistan.
None of it has been covert.


Making Brushes Last
LEAD: PAINTBRUSHES and roller covers (the woolly sleeves that fit onto the roller and spread the paint) seldom receive the care they need.
But even inexpensive brushes and covers will last a long time if they are used properly and cleaned thoroughly after each use, and protected when put away for long periods.


This Newcomer Is Handsome and Businesslike
LEAD: I have in my hand the state-of-the-art in camera technology, in the form of the new Minolta Maxxum 7000i.
It's a pleasant handful, with a softly rounded, streamlined body and an ultra-light, 100-300 millimeter zoom lens.
If not quite warm and lovable, at least it's handsome and businesslike.

Question Of the Week; Should The Yankees Have Fired Billy Martin?
LEAD: No way.
Ever since Billy Martin came to New York he brought a unique style of managing that made the game much more exciting to watch.
Billy Ball consists of suicide squeezes, double steals, and hit and runs just to name a few.
It's a shame he had to be let go because of people second-guessing him and trying to create stories that aren't true.


A Critic's Lot Should Be a Lonely One
LEAD: WHEN WE WERE IN school, well-meaning teachers spent a lot of time denouncing cliches and demanding that we eliminate them from our thinking.
Not only is that impossible, it is probably harmful to mental health.
In a topsy-turvy world (there's one now!), one needs to feel solid ground under foot (another one!).


Young Calls Jackson Realist Who Won't Jeopardize Ballot
LEAD: Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta says the Rev.
Jesse Jackson is a realist and will not press to be the running mate of Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis if it means the Democrats will lose in November.


Jazz Festival; For Brubeck, Old Spirit, New Faces
LEAD: The Dave Brubeck Quartet, which appeared at the Kaufman Concert Hall of the 92d Street Y as part of the JVC Jazz Festival on Thursday evening, was not, of course, the celebrated Brubeck Quartet of the 1950's.
But it was so similar in spirit, style and point of view that one almost felt time had stood still even though all the faces, aside from Mr.

World of 1990's Will Be Far From the 50's; Petrorubles
LEAD: To the Editor:


POSTINGS: Can III Be Far Behind?; Teleport II Takes Off
LEAD: Not so long ago, it seemed the nearby Fresh Kills landfill would fill up quicker than Teleport I. The first speculative office building at the 100-acre Teleport Satellite Communication Center in northwestern Staten Island was only 60 percent occupied in January, a year after opening.
Potential tenants were discouraged by the center's remote location between Victory Boulevard and South Avenue off the West Shore


Who Liked 'Lolita'? How Much?
LEAD: To the Editor:


Corrections

A holder of a regular card may ask the issuing bank for a list of overseas cash machines.


Baseball; Candelaria Stops White Sox on 2-Hitter
LEAD: Late in the afternoon, when the day was done and John Candelaria had begun to pull off his uniform, talk swerved quickly toward the All-Star Game 10 days from now.
First, Candelaria shrugged.
Then, he offered a half-smile. ''Would it mean a lot?'' he said, repeating someone's question. ''Let's see what happens.


A Vanguard Festival Seeks More in Less
LEAD: WHEN THE PEPSICO Summerfare was first conceived back in 1980, there was no Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, no Serious Fun at Lincoln Center, and the First New York International Festival of the Arts was just a gleam in Martin Segal's eye.
Now, as Summerfare prepares to open its ninth season Friday (through July 31) at the State University of New York at Purchase, its director, Christopher


Inside Every Adult Lurks a Child, and We're All Better Off for It
LEAD: To the Editor:


IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester; South Norwalk Seeks Traffic Solutions
LEAD: EVER since the rehabilitation of South Norwalk began six years ago with the conversion of 1890's factories on Washington Street into fashionable condominiums and shops, the anticipated upgrading of surrounding streets has been markedly slow.


Innovative Engineering Produces Gifted Speakers
LEAD: WITH NEARLY 300 brands hoping to catch your ear, loudspeakers are - next to soap - probably the most oversupplied of all consumer goods.
One cause for this absurd plethora is the fact that many speaker manufacturers enter the field impelled by personal passion rather than impersonal analysis of the market.


A Report Card on Secretary Shultz
LEAD: No outsider can offer more than a speculative appraisal of the performance of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, since one can never be sure whether a particular action was taken on his own motion or in response to President Reagan's whim or directive.
Yet, because the consequences of America's diplomatic performance during his six years in office will affect the next


Soviet Union
LEAD: To the Editor: I beg to differ with the assessment of hotels in the Soviet Union.
Traveling two years ago this spring, staying over in seven cities -Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Yalta, Tashkent, Samarkand and Bukhara - I felt spoiled by the superlative quarters providing good-size beds, spruced-up furnishings and, with one exception, clean and up-to-the-minute bathrooms.

From the City Streets, a Poet of the Stage
LEAD: IN 1972 I VISITED THE OSSINING Correctional Facility (Sing Sing) in order to write about theater in prisons.
While I was there, the inmates presented an anthology of their own short plays, monologues and poems.
Twelve of the 20 pieces were written by - and some of them were performed by - one inmate, Miguel

LEAD: ''Someday, I will tell my grandchildren that I was here,'' said Khashbikar Bokov, ''that I was part of the revolution.''


The Where and Ware of Hagi
LEAD: JAPANESE connoisseurs have an old saying: ''One, Raku; two, Hagi; three, Karatsu.'' They have long ranked the most precious ceramic wares made for the tea ceremony in this order.
The charms of Hagi ware's rough clay and rich, pockmarked surfaces, laced with cracks in the glaze, take on character and deeper tones with age and use.


Length of Hair, Breadth of Choices
LEAD: IN THE 60's, hair was a political statement.
You could tell at a glance, even in the days of high school dress codes, where someone's sympathies lay simply by assessing his or her tresses.


Exploring the Secondhand Market
LEAD: RECENTLY, the International Business Machines Corporation announced a trade-in policy for personal computers; bring in your old I.B.M.
PC, XT or AT and get a discount on a new PS/2 computer.
It is a significant move on I.B.M.'s part, one that deserves attention from other computer makers as well, although the trade-in allowances that are offered do not seem to reflect realistic market values.


POLISH DISSIDENT SEEKS END OF EXILE
LEAD: A leader of the Polish underground, Kornel Morawiecki, is hoping that American pressure will persuade the Warsaw authorities, who expelled him two months ago, to let him return to Poland and his family.

MAKING IT BY DOING GOOD
LEAD: UNLIKE SOME TIRELESSLY ambitious women in her field, Mai en in her field, Mai Hallingby wouldn't dream of hiring a public relations consultant.

American pre-eminence in this new field, which includes ceramic products for high-tech structural, chemical, electronic and electrical applications, is under challenge from abroad.


Playing to Win
LEAD: MY DAUGHTER IS an athlete.
Nowadays, this statement won't strike many parents as unusual, but it does me.
Until her freshman year in high school, Ann was only marginally interested in sport of any kind.
When she played, she didn't swing hard, often dropped the ball, and had an annoying habit of tittering on field or court.

David Smyth, Metaphysician
LEAD: DAVID SMYTH was trained at the Art Institute of Chicago but he trails none of the strangeness associated with Chicago art.
His paintings, on view at the Alan Brown Gallery in Hartsdale (210 East Hartsdale Avenue), contain no otherworldly grotesquerie that would link him with artists such as Jim Nutt, Ed Paschke or Ellen Lanyon, to cite a few examples.


Parks That Provide Playtime for Parents, Too
LEAD: AFTER suffering for several decades from a reputation as unsafe, unclean and unsavory, the amusement park was transformed with the opening of Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., in 1955.

LEAD: For the past 14 years, Artpark, a 200-acre space along the Niagara River gorge, has offered the unusual combination of performing arts, painting and sculpture exhibitions and just plain relaxation.

But for more active eyes and ears, there is also the 2,300-seat Artpark Theater, where Wagner's ''Ring of the

Now, after centuries of building canals and causeways, they are trying to undo some of the damage they have wrought.


POSTINGS: Homes in the Hamptons; Moving West to Eastport
LEAD: Eastport is in Southhampton - the Long Island town, that is, not the village - but not quite on the South Fork.
Still, Robert Levitas, the developer of a 98-home project under way there, says that this one-time farming village is directly in the path of the westward expansion of the Hamptons.
Already, he said, Eastport is ''really indistinguishable from Westhampton,'' though some brahmin beachcombers would argue.

Century-Long Battle Over Local Control
LEAD: ''THE poor performance of large numbers of black and Puerto Rican children was the chief cause of criticism of the school system in the 1960's.
It was not providing basic literacy to a sizable proportion of its students; it was not abating crime and poverty; it was not molding good citizens . . .
Reformers did not realize that the same charges had been leveled periodically over the previous 150 years.

Old House in Sea Cliff Is Even Older
LEAD: You had an interesting account of Sea Cliff's Victorian houses  [ ''Sea Cliff Adjusts to Historic Listing,'' June 12 ] .
But I would like to tell you what I told the Landmarks Association.
It is a well-established fact that 112 Sea Cliff Avenue was built in 1884.
The date of 1887 is wrong.
In 1888 the tower wing was added, and of course the tower is the most conspicuous feature of the house.

Museum Staff Urged To Follow Assessment
LEAD: Having read ''Museum Revamping After Years of Conflict'' June 5, I can only hope that the Nassau County Museum of Fine Art's staff of six, who have credentials in the fine arts and were assessed by the American Association of Museums as ''well-trained, excited, caring professionals,'' will be able to function in that capacity and not become discarded pawns in a power struggle that seems to be leaning toward making the museum an elitist club.

Gandhi Is Finding Out Fast How Much He Had to Lose
LEAD: AT the height of his popularity in 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said that ''people's expectations are scary'' and that he could not possibly fulfill everyone's hopes.

The Special Topic Is Patriotism
LEAD: IT'S a grand old flag, and it's been appearing on United States stamps since 1869.
But there was a time, too, when sending patriotic greeting cards on the Fourth of July was much more common than it is today.


Headliners; On the Outs
LEAD: Pope John Paul II has had it with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre.
The generation-long dispute between the Swiss Archbishop and the Vatican began when the Archbishop denounced the church's mid-1960's liberalizations and kept to such Roman Catholic traditions as the Latin mass.
He said the church had been infiltrated by ''wolves and thieves'' and was consumed by the ''cancer of liberalism.


A Visit to the Cemetery: The Past Resonates
LEAD: IT is an annual pilgramage that I take with my mother on the first nice day in spring.
We have been doing it since 1973, when my father died, and I have always felt somewhat ambivalent about going. ''I think I want to visit Daddy,'' my mother would say to me.
And dutifully we would roll across the Whitestone Bridge and exit at the Belmont

He would sell off seven new houses as fast as his construction crews could erect them.


Barbecue From Coast to Coast
LEAD: THE Dreamland Drive Inn Bar-B-Q, on the outskirts of Tuscaloosa, Ala., looks like a good barbecue restaurant ought to look: a smoky, clapboard building with a screen door that slaps shut, a graveled parking lot, tables with chipped Formica tops.
There is just one thing on the menu at the Dreamland, and that is pork ribs, ritually served up with a couple of slabs of white bread on a paper plate.


BECKER STYMIES LENDL
LEAD: Once again he fell short, leaving Wimbledon without the championship that has become an obsession.

In a Vermont School Bus, Educated Ribs
LEAD: BARBECUE is not the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Vermont, a state that eaters more often associate with maple syrup, cheddar cheese and apples.
But barbecue it is, nonetheless, at least in the village of Putney, thanks to the efforts of a no-longer-roving migrant apple picker named Curtis Tuff and a band of local enthusiasts who gather around an old blue-painted school bus on Route 5 each time the rising cloud of smoke signifies that Mr.


Fusion: Concept for the 80's
LEAD: JAZZ LISTENERS CONVERGED on New York this past week to soak up three festivals and stockpile enough information and gossip to last through the slow months.
They're not known as a laconic or inhibited lot, but one word was scarcer than miniskirts in Iran - fusion.


Jasper Johns Shows the Flag in Venice
LEAD: THE STORY OF THE 1988 VENICE Biennale is Jasper Johns - the best known, most influential and probably the most complex American painter in the last 30 years.
No one else in the 43d biennale approaches him in stature, and the show that represents him - and the United States - ''Jasper Johns: Work From 1974-1986,'' has the kind of concentration that encourages an appraisal of his achievement.


Toons and Bushers Fly High
LEAD: MOVIE DISTRIBUTORS APPEAR to assume that, when summer arrives, the minds of their audiences go as soft as abandoned Eskimo Pies.
At least, it looks that way.
Schools are out.

The Voices You Hear Are Inimitably Their Own
LEAD: I JAZZ IT IS A TRUISM THAT A musician, to be respected, has to develop a personal style as an improviser.
Style - the grammar and twitches and shakes differentiating one musician from another - can be innovative in broad ways: think of the effect Miles Davis's airy, space-conscious trumpet playing has had not only on jazz, but on international culture as well.

LEAD: Beth Abraham Hospital, a nursing home in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx, was deluged with applicants when Scheuer Gardens opened in 1983.
Now, as construction begins on Scheuer Plaza, it is braced for more of the same.
A 116-unit, subsidized rental residence for the elderly and disabled, Scheuer Gardens was never meant to have a companion.


Jazz Festival; Sarah Vaughan, at Carnegie, Shows Grace in Adversity
LEAD: Sarah Vaughan was understandably miffed during her Carnegie Hall concert on Thursday evening.
The hall's unreliable sound system made it difficult for the singer to hear the members of her own backup trio.

A Brave Old World in Eastern Europe

Not a Drop to Drink
LEAD: CONSIDER A DROP IN THE ocean.

Elliott, who started 38th in the 42-car field, did not lead until 23 laps from the end of the 400-mile, 160-lap race.

Industry Deals With the Drought
LEAD: THE paper plant that squats on the Pigeon River in Canton, N. C., never stops if it can help it.

Some 44 million gallons of water swish through the plant every day, washing wood, helping to bleach the pulp.


Soviet Union
LEAD: To the Editor: The Beriozkas in Moscow do indeed have a tempting variety of artistic items as Esther Fein said, but visitors should take with them heavy-duty capacious plastic sacks with sturdy handles or all they will bring home will be regrets over the beautiful things left behind because the flimsy paper bags supplied in the dollar shops can't make it to the airport in Moscow, and purchases made in Russia may not be shipped no matter how bulky they might be or how costly.


Canada Catches a Cold War Chill
LEAD: WHEN Pierre Elliott Trudeau stepped down after 15 years as Canada's Prime Minister in 1984, he told a friend that he had not realized before taking the job how limited its powers would turn out to be.

SAVORING BARBECUE
LEAD: BARBECUE MEANS DIFFERENT things to different people.
To someone from the Carolinas, it is shredded pork in a vinegar-based sauce.

LEAD: WITH THE RELEASE OF all Beethoven's piano concertos played on historical instruments (London Oiseau-Lyre 421 408; three CD's, cassettes or LP's), it is clear that some kind of milestone has been reached in the early music movement.

NEW YORKERS, Etc.

In Switzerland, Mountaineering For Everyone
LEAD: TO stand on the roof of the world is an experience that most of us believe we'll never have.
To know what it's like to climb a major mountain and gain an eagle's-eye view, we have to be armchair mountaineers, relying on books or films.
But a cable car line in Zermatt allows a reasonably fit person with no climbing experience to make such a climb, safely accompanied by a licensed mountain guide, and taste the thrill of true mountaineering - a brief membership in one of the world's most exclusive clubs.

Autobiographical stage journeys can be fascinating, and this autobiography focuses on the coming-of-age of a young homosexual in the late 1970's and early 1980's - a time marked by the killing of Harvey Milk, a San Francisco city supervisor who was one of the country's first publicly avowed gay politicans, and by the first awareness of AIDS and its apparent singling out of homosexuals.

A City Budget at Last
LEAD: The $25.2 billion plan adopted Thursday gives New York City a sensible budget in a lean year that could grow leaner.

Fisk have a nice summer.'' The lazy, hazy summer hasn't started yet, but my sophomores are busy taking exams, and I'm running back and forth to the bookroom returning American lit texts and counting ripped covers.
It's that wonderful quiet time between the end of the school year and the beginning of vacation and it's a time of taking inventory both literally and figuratively.

The Battle of the Books
LEAD: As a junior at Yale, majoring in literature, I found James Atlas's article interesting.
The movement to widen the academic canon is not just an effort by junior faculty ''to define themselves and to validate their own identities.'' It is also an attempt by students to establish a curriculum which reflects the variety of cultures in the nation and world we live in.


Go Ahead, Serve the Salad With the Main Dish
LEAD: SALAD is usually served after the main course.

At the fresh produce shop next door, beets, cabbage and a mound of soggy squash were the vegetables of the day.

LEAD: To the Editor:


The Light and Dark Tones Add Drama

The Battle of the Books

Question Of the Week; The Draft: How Did the Knicks and Nets Do?
LEAD: Knick management says that Rod Strickland will save Mark Jackson's career.
Strickland was the best player available when the Knicks picked, and may even prove to have been the best guard in the draft.

Romance Blooms in the Park
LEAD: When The Royal Shakespeare company brought ''Much Ado About Nothing'' to New York four years ago, the elegant British production stressed the brittle hauteur of Shakespeare's recalcitrant lovers, Benedick and Beatrice, who were played by Derek Jacobi and Sinead Cusack.
In the battle of wits between the self-proclaimed eternal bachelor and the aggressively independent lady whose surface disdain masks a suspicious preoccupation with her nemesis, the emphasis was on the intellectual fireworks generated by two formidably matched antagonists rather than on the concealed passion underlying their

A Film Adaptation Of Waugh Tests the Limits Of Moving Books To the Screen
LEAD: Evelyn Waugh's novel ''A Handful of Dust'' is the work of a man who had been deeply wounded by the failure of his first marriage: lurking at the heart of it are a cry of pain and an act of revenge.
It is true that by the time Waugh's feelings reached the printed page, they had been transmuted into comedy - he was far too much of an artist to serve them up raw.


A Working National Security Team
LEAD: Finally, after seven years, President Reagan's foreign policy and defense advisers are pulling together - including in their response to last week's airliner tragedy in the Persian Gulf.
That's no small accomplishment, given the history of incessant warfare among the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and National Security Council adviser.

The story of that fighting, at places with names engraved in the American memory - Red Beach and the Tenaru River, Matanikau, Lunga Point and Bloody Ridge overlooking Henderson Field - was written by a correspondent who slogged the ridge and jungle with men of the First Marine Division.

LEAD: ''The street is a room by agreement,'' the great architect Louis Kahn said many years ago.

LEAD: The simultaneous booking of Vince Giordano's 10-piece band, the Nighthawks, and Frank Vignola's string quartet, the Hot Club of France, for a four-week engagement at Michael's Pub that began on Tuesday, suggests that the restaurant at 211 East 55th Street is offering a double bill.

Show Turns Farm Into Puppet State

LEAD: This year is replete with audio anniversaries.

Festival Report: The Highs, The Lows; MUSIC: A failure that could have been foreseen
LEAD: The first New York International Festival of the Arts - a monthlong array of some 350 events - closes tomorrow.

Go Ahead, Serve the Salad With the Main Dish
LEAD: SALAD is usually served after the main course.

In Massachusetts, (508) From (617) Is . . , Confusion
LEAD: New England Telephone considers the addition of a new area code in Massachusetts a positive reflection of the state's prosperity, and besides, it was unavoidable.
To many of its customers, the change is a nuisance and some of them are fighting it down to the wire.


A Secret Collection Goes Public
LEAD: One of the finest art Deco collections formed in recent years has just come on the market.
The holdings of Michael Chow, the restaurateur, have been bought by Anthony DeLorenzo, a New York dealer who specializes in 20th-century decorative arts.
The sale puts on public view one of the most important collections of Art Deco ever assembled, and one that was put together in almost utter secrecy.


THE REGION: Airport Gridlock; 'Plane City' Grows, With No End in Sight And No Room to Move
LEAD: ''LOTS of times,'' said the veteran airline pilot, ''you push back from the gate at LaGuardia, you look out that cockpit window, and it's full - tails and wings all over.
You don't go anywhere for 20 or 30 minutes because there's nowhere to move.
It's Plane City.
So you haven't started your engines yet, and already you're a half hour late.

The Battle of the Books
LEAD: James Atlas's article stresses canon revision as reapportionment - expansion of the tradition to include writers hitherto ignored or devalued.
But equally important is the reformulation of the canon from inside.
For example, feminist critics and new historicists agree that Shakespeare's work cannot be treated as esthetically autonomous or historically transcendent.


Yorktown Weighs a Day-Care Initiative YORKTOWN
LEAD: IT used to happen rarely, but now, according to Judith A. Reardon, a White Plains lawyer, there is an increasingly familiar scene taking place in the back of many Westchester courtrooms.


Whose Good Deed?
LEAD: SUNDAY IS MY EXERCISE day.
Late in the afternoon, I bumble out in sweatpants and sneakers to catch the final aerobics class of the weekend.
One recent Sunday I didn't make it to the gym.
I was hijacked at the end of my block.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. The ceiling in our upstairs bathroom develops ugly black stains that look like mold.
We keep repainting, but the stains return.
Is there a special kind of paint we can use?


In the Heat Of Summer, Senate Race Hits a Lull
LEAD: FOR United States Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican, and his Democratic challenger, the state Attorney General, Joseph I. Lieberman, these early days of summer on the campaign trail are not filled with high political drama and heavy media exposure.


Journalists Lose Court Ruling
LEAD: California's law protecting journalists from disclosing confidential sources of information does not exempt them from giving eyewitness accounts when called on to testify, a state appeals court has ruled.

GENTLE ITALIANS
LEAD: Delacroix's Algerian harems, Botticelli's pale nymphs, Degas's fragile ballerinas -they were a few of the images evoked by Milanese designers this season in collections that reflect an intensely refined romanticism.


Shultz Seeks Shift on Vietnam Refugees
LEAD: In a frank admission that the decade-long strategy for dealing with Indochinese refugees no longer works, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that sending refugees back voluntarily to Vietnam must be examined as an alternative to resettling all of them in the United States and elsewhere in the West.


Refuting Usual Seafood Cliches
LEAD: CLOSE your eyes.
Think Clam Diggers Restaurant.
What do you see: a rustic fish house, shore dinners, steamers, paper plates?
Now, open your eyes and look at Shelter Island's Clam Diggers Restaurant: a bright yellow Victorian house with hanging baskets of fuchsias and outdoor dining porches.
Inside, it is white lace curtains, tablecloths, cut flowers, candlelight, floral paintings, antiques, towering vases of flowering branches and strains of progressive jazz in the background.


FICTION
LEAD:  PEOPLE LIKE US.
By Dominick Dunne. (Crown, $19.95.) Plunging into this densely populated roman a clef by the author of ''The Two Mrs.
Grenvilles'' is like coming late to a cocktail party where the socially prominent guests are already in full cry.
Although the faces are familiar, there are too many to sort out; at first it's hard to catch the tune, but give it time.


Lecture on Isadora Duncan
LEAD: Annabelle Gamson, a leading interpreter of the work of Isadora Duncan, will explore the evolution of Duncan's choreography in a lecture on July 12 at 1 P.M. at the Fieldston School, Fieldston Road, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.

POSTINGS: On Ancestral Property; 49 Homes for Putnam
LEAD: Harold Salmon's ancestors were ''sooners'' long before anyone heard of Oklahoma and Conestoga wagons.
When land now in eastern Putman County was opened to settlers in 1731 after being trapped for years in a border dispute between New York and Connecticut, the Salmon family established a 200-acre dairy farm.

LEAD: The United States today qualified three of its six men's entries and both its women's single sculler and women's eight-oared crew for Sunday's finals of the Lucerne International Rowing Regatta.


Video-Terminal Law: An Overreaction
LEAD: The Suffolk business community is overreacting  [ ''Businesses Assess Impact of Law on Video Terminals,'' June 19 ] .
As a business executive operating an enterprise that employs more than 100 people, I too am concerned when government mandates an increase in my costs of doing business.
But the fears of many employers are unfounded.


From Portugal, Gifts of Cork But Not Just Bottle Stoppers
LEAD: THE Portuguese offer the following advice: If you plant for yourself, sow a vineyard; if you plant for your son, sow olive trees, and if you are thinking of your grandson, you should plant cork.


The Sauerkraut Dries Up
LEAD: IN the 1970's, 30 percent of the sauerkraut consumed in America -more than 100 million pounds - was from Phelps, N.Y.
No one there complained about the odor that hung over the village, which billed itself as the sauerkraut capital of the world.


Go Ahead, Serve the Salad With the Main Dish
LEAD: SALAD is usually served after the main course.
But in the summer I sometimes like to serve salad and a fish or meat dish together.
This practice is not only convenient, simplifying things when you are entertaining - it is ideal when you want to eat light.


Singapore's 'Goalkeeper' Fends Off Democracy
LEAD: ''MY colleagues and I are well versed in theory and also in practice and we know what can work and what cannot,'' said Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the man who almost singlehandedly has made Singapore a showcase of third-world development.
What Mr.
Lee believes cannot work for his small, ethnically divided country is an


The Battle of the Books
LEAD: I was struck by the portrait of Frank Lentricchia teaching ''The Waste Land'' and ''pointing out the buried allusions to Ovid and Dante, Marvell and Verlaine.'' Mr.
Lentricchia's lecture is undoubtedly at its most effective when his students know Ovid and Dante firsthand and not merely as disembodied references.


The Battle of the Books
LEAD: According to the radical critics, the Western classics help to instill in their readers the values of the ruling class, including ''Eurocentrism and phallocentrism.'' But how, then, can these critics explain the fact that those who have read these books most assiduously became radical feminists and neo-Marxists?


Reviews/Music; Soviet Violinist's U.S. Debut
LEAD: With grim determination, Dmitri Berlinsky dug into the strings from the very first notes of the Ysaye violin sonata that opened his recital at Weill Concert Hall on Thursday evening, and he hardly eased up before the concert was through.
What else could a listener expect?
The young Soviet musician won first prize in the Paganini Competition three years ago at the age of 16.


WHERE THERE'S WATER THERE ARE SNAKES
LEAD:  CAN'T QUIT YOU, BABY  By Ellen Douglas.  256 pp. New York:  Atheneum. $17.95.

Repairing Clapboards
LEAD: DESPITE the popularity of aluminum and vinyl siding and other contemporary varieties, many homes still feature traditional overlapping wood clapboards.


The High Cost of an Arms Scandal
LEAD: MILITARY contractors are certainly no strangers to scandal.
Over the years, they have admitted to falsifying time cards, bribing foreign politicians, even selling the Government $435 hammers.
But industry executives, analysts and other experts believe that the Pentagon fraud and bribery investigation now underway is likely to have far broader - and more ominous - implications for weapons makers than any previous misdeeds.


His Beat Is the City's Pulse
LEAD: SOME call him 'Mr.
Atlantic City,'' others just ''Pinky,'' but no matter where he's spotted in this resort, Seymour Kravitz is as much a legend as a local tradition.


Kemp Assails Dukakis in Atlanta
LEAD: Maureen Reagan, a leader of the Republican National Committee, applauding Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York yesterday at a rally in Atlanta, where the Democratic National Convention opens July 18. ''If you're undertaxed, vote for Dukakis,'' he said. ''If you're overtaxed, we want you in our party.


Idealism to Reality; A Matter of Morals
LEAD: IDEALISM is often an outlook of the young.
As people grow older, they allow themselves to get caught up in making a living and don't pay attention to whether what they do for a living reflects their convictions.


Transactions
LEAD:  BASEBALL


For Faster Car Care, New Specialized Malls
LEAD: A NEW mall serves car owners with maintainence, engine repairs and washing and waxing.


The Battle of the Books
LEAD: Duke University Prof.
Jane Tompkins wants us to read Charles Brockden Brown, a Philadelphian of the early years of the Republic.
Brown's novels are filled with the rigged episodes of melodrama and the turgid prose that passed for elegance among the literary circles in America before Irving and Hawthorne arrived on the scene.


Agnes A. Reiss Married
LEAD: At Our Lady of Mount Carmel Roman Catholic Church in Ridgewood, N.J., Agnes Adele Reiss, a daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs.
William P. Reiss of South Orange, N.J., was married yesterday to James Andrew Zachara, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Francis M. Zachara of Ridgewood.
The Rev.
Eugene P. Heyndricks performed the ceremony.


Correction
LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the slaying of a police officer in East Palo Alto, Calif., gave an incorrect year of that city's incorporation.
It was incorporated in 1983.


Margaret Shivers Engaged to Marry
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Mr. and Mrs.
Frank R. Shivers Jr. of Baltimore and Mount Hope, Pa., of the engagement of their daughter Margaret Littlehales Shivers to Peter Eric Heyward, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
E.
J.
R.
Heyward of Great Neck, L.I., and Paris.


What Does A Museum Owe an Artist?
LEAD: The main question to ask about the Georges Braque exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is not whether it is good or bad but whether it should be taking place at all.
It is something of a retrospective, with around 120 works, 90 of them paintings.
Some are wonderful, and Braque's great series of gueridons, studios and billiard tables are at least represented.


TALKING: Commissions; When Are Oral Pacts Binding?
LEAD: CAN a real estate broker demand a commission from a seller even though the seller has not signed a listing agreement?
What if the two had just had a chat and the seller casually said, ''O.K., go ahead''?
Is that instruction binding?
The answers to those questions are more complex than they first appear.


Question Of the Week; The Draft: How Did the Knicks and Nets Do?
LEAD: The Knicks desperately needed to fill three positions: power forward, shooting forward and backup point guard for Mark Jackson.
The trade for Charles Oakley, combined with the selection of Rod Strickland, provides two of those elements.


Repairing Clapboards
LEAD: DESPITE the popularity of aluminum and vinyl siding and other contemporary varieties, many homes still feature traditional overlapping wood clapboards.


Turning a Tame Game Into a Lively One
LEAD: WOULDN'T it be grand if there were a way to get the benefits of the Ruy Lopez without its accompanying hazards?


The Wait Is Over: No One Is More Feared Than Strawberry
LEAD: Their names dominate the lists of offensive leaders for the first half of the season: Darryl Strawberry, Andres Galarraga, Will Clark, Bobby Bonilla and Andre Dawson in the National League, Dave Winfield, Jose Canseco, Mike Greenwell, Kirby Puckett, George Brett and Joe Carter in the American.


Sports of The Times
LEAD: He's a 23-year-old body-builder.


New Troupe Takes Up 'Fountain Pen'
LEAD: TO the Independence Theater Company, the new professional indoor group in the great outdoors of Fort Lee Historic Park: welcome.
About its philosophy of putting on out-of-the-way plays: bravo.
On the occasion of its first production, ''Today I Am a Fountain Pen!'' by Israel Horovitz: better luck next time.


Correction
LEAD: A polar map of Canada and the Soviet Union in The Week in Review last Sunday carried erroneous shading, misrepresenting the status of the sovereign territory of Finland.
Finland should have been shaded, not left white like the Soviet land mass.


THE NATION: Proposals; A 'Drug Czar,' Testing and More

LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Steven Bruce Rosenberg of Harrison, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Nancy Beth Rosenberg, to Marc Richard Tannenbaum, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Walter L. Tannenbaum of Jericho, L.I.
Miss Rosenberg is the manager of an Ann Taylor store in Richmond.
Her fiance is a member of the class of '89 at the Medical College of Virginia.


Question Of the Week; The Draft: How Did the Knicks and Nets Do?
LEAD: I thought that the Nets and the Knicks both made bad draft picks.
The Nets should have drafted a guard, not a big man up front.
Chris Morris will probably perform well, but who's going to start alongside John Bagley?
They needed someone like Hersey Hawkins or Rex Chapman to pick up the slack.


Richard Harold Bott Wed To Marian Sidney Adams
LEAD: At the Presbyterian Church in Rye, N.Y., Marian Sidney Adams, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Rex K. Adams of Wichita, Kan., was married yesterday to Richard Harold Bott, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Harold C. Bott of Greenwich, Conn.
The Rev.
Vance L. Polley performed the ceremony.


O'Neill House's Journey Into Blight
LEAD: Eugene O'Neill, were he alive today, probably wouldn't be surprised that a few property-owners here want to demolish the quaint waterfront boarding house where he once lived and replace it with something likely to be a little less artful.
A dockominium, perhaps.


3 Officers on Trial in a Black's Death
LEAD: Six months after a black man died of extensive head injuries after being taken to a small East Texas jail, three law officers are on trial in connection with his death.


Corrections
LEAD: A map on March 20 with an article about Alaska misidentified an inlet of the Gulf of Alaska lying east of the Kenai Peninsula.

LEAD: THE display at the Silvermine GGallery in Stamford, ''The Figure in American Art Since Mid-Century'' is open to interpretation.

Festival Report: The Highs, The Lows; DANCE: In several events, festivity in spite of itself
LEAD: The first New York International Festival of the Arts - a monthlong array of some 350 events - closes tomorrow.
To assess the artistic accomplishments of the event, the Arts and Leisure section asked a cross-section of Times critics to evaluate both the individual performances they attended and the quality of the festival as a whole.


From Africa Comes Inspiration
LEAD: The all-star African pop double bill 10 days ago at the Beacon Theater, featuring Youssou N'Dour of Senegal and Salif Keita of Mali, was above all a joyous musical and commual celebration.
Musical, because Mr.
N'Dour and Mr.
Keita have two of the finest voices around, irrespective of genre; and both of them set their singing in ebullient, triumphant, rhythmically enlivening instrumental contexts.

Maps. 468 pp.
New York:  Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. $24.95.


The Battle of the Books
LEAD: I'm sure my colleagues at Duke University are more sensible than Mr.
Atlas portrayed them.
Surely, it is not a matter of choosing between a canonical reading list and writers representing favored ideological positions.
Rather, we face the critical task of adding to our traditional lists.
There is no need to be overly permissive; there are numerous voices that deserve to be heard not only because of their ''message'' but also because of their artistic merits: Olive Schreiner's ''The Story of an African Farm,'' Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man,'' Leslie Silko's ''Ceremony'' and Isabel


Clemens Fans 15; Red Sox Split White Sox

Difficulties in Choosing Diskettes
LEAD: WHICH brand of floppy diskettes do you buy?
The question is not a trivial one, especially for those companies that buy thousands of diskettes a year.
Prices for standard double-density floppy diskettes range from $1 to $5 for a 3.5-inch diskette and 30 cents to $1.50 for a 5.25-inch model.
The price range on other types of diskettes is even wider.


Losing Innocence, Abroad
LEAD: RICHARD W. SIEBRASSE, president of CPC International Inc.'s worldwide consumer foods division, has never worked overseas.
Neither has Colby H. Chandler, chief executive of the Eastman Kodak Company.

THE WORLD: But It's Only Talk; Finally, Soviets and and Israelis Really Are on Speaking Terms
LEAD: THE operator had to make several tries, but she kept at it because sitting next to her at the telephone company's main long distance switchboard was Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.

Finally the call went through, and in Moscow an elderly woman picked up the phone to ask who was calling.


Pop Star in London, He Returns to Roots
LEAD: TEN years ago, Gerard Kenny flew from Sea Cliff to San Tropez to spend a season as what he called ''a one-man, four-piece band.'' This included singing and playing the piano at La Papagallo, a big nightclub there, or, as Mr.

Community College And Commitment
LEAD: In his June 12 essay, David W. Bates accused the Connecticut Community Colleges of not serving the poor and of being ''one of the most decrepit community college systems imaginable.'' (''The Demise of Idealism: Community College,'' Opinion page.) Mr.

LEAD: J. F. O'Connell of Ponte Vedra, Fla., who spends summers here, said Wellfleet has changed since last season and not for the better.


SASSY SPANIARDS

The Town That Created a Color
LEAD: DELFT stands for blue and white pottery; in fact the whole town positively hymns the blues.
Rare is the cafe or home without its casual collector's item - a blue and white vase set off by stately tulips, a fireplace framed with exquisite old tiles, an antique jar offering sanctuary to rusty keys and pencil stubs.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. The ceiling in our upstairs bathroom develops ugly black stains that look like mold.

Sports of The Times; 'Who's That Wearing Dunston's Shirt?'
LEAD: The manager observed his shortstop and thought, ''He doesn't know how to conduct himself on a baseball field.'' The manager saw the shortstop chase foul balls ''that he had no chance for, that were 40 feet into the stands.''

By Jonathan Moor. (Dunne/St. Martin's, $17.95.)

And Now From Japan, the Hot New 'Dry' Beers
LEAD: GIVEN the current social climate, if American marketers proposed increasing the alcohol content of a beer to spur sales, people would probably wonder what they had been drinking - and how much.
After all, the trend has been toward moderation.
Light beer now accounts for 25 percent of United States sales, and this year even Jack Daniel's, that supposed bastion of tradition, lowered the proof of its

SIBERIA TAUGHT HIM A FEW THINGS: AN 'ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE' RETURNS
LEAD: In June 1956, the most senior representatives of the Yugoslav and Soviet Governments -Tito and Khrushchev, accompanied by their chiefs of staff - sit in one of the parlor cars of the special train that shuttles between Moscow and Kiev.
There is no need for an interpreter.
Since their schedule is overburdened (the meeting's purpose is to smooth out the numerous ideological differences that had accumulated during the Yugoslav ''schism''), little time remains for ancillary matters.

Along the Vecht River By Auto or Bike or Foot
LEAD: LESS than an hour's drive south of Amsterdam is a region that seems a microcosm of the Dutch countryside.
Enfolding the River Vecht in its north-south course between Vreeland and Maarssen, the region consists of centuries-old villages, expanses of flat and watery pasture land punctuated by windmills, castles and dozens of mansions built by Amsterdam merchants as weekend retreats during the 17th and 18th centuries.

The Young and the Homeless
LEAD: IF it's difficult for young married couples, single professionals and semiskilled workers to find affordable housing on Long Island, it's even more difficult for young people who finish high school and leave family homes to live on their own.
For many, there is no choice.


The Battle of the Books
LEAD: I can't help but think of one of those ''Great Books'' men, John Stuart Mill, who wrote a seminal defense of women's rights cherished by generations of feminists, and who once shrewdly noted that all parties in a dispute tend to be correct in what they affirm and wrong in what they deny.
Isn't this true of the present conflict?


THE SILVER LINING IN DISASTER
LEAD: Demographers tell us that human fecundity increases in time of war and other catastrophe.
A sort of population thermostat apparently kicks in, as if nature were programmed to counteract the death count.
Some cultural historians have suggested in a similarly mystical vein that artistic creativity tends to decline in relatively calm periods, but to flourish when society is convulsed.

Performing a la Mozart - Whatever That Means
LEAD: New York City enjoys the privilege each summer of reflecting afresh on Mozart.

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL

The Battle of the Books
LEAD: Nobody asks why students would want to have contemporary works taught in class.
Teaching - explanation -has in the past been reserved for less accessible, noncontemporary works.
Why not let students discover the world they live in by themselves?
Are we teachers so desperate to direct them every step of the way?

Drought Calls for More Than Rain
LEAD: AS one of the century's most severe droughts clung last week to the nation's farm belt, agriculture policy experts in Washington were coming to grips with unaccustomed choices about the nation's food supply.
Since the spring's dry weather evolved into the worst drought since the Dust Bowl, the farm policy has been turned upside down.


Reviews/Music; A Trio of Infrequently Played String Quartets
LEAD: The Chilingirian String Quartet drew a slim crowd for its First New York International Festival of the Arts concert Thursday night at the 92d Street Y. But then, this was a pretty rarefied program for any time of the year, and for those who bothered to scale its heights, the rewards proved considerable.


Club Must Admit Woman
LEAD: A gun club must pay a woman $100 in damages for denying her membership application in 1980 and admit her, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.

Reviews/Music; Schwantner Premiere By Slatkin and Ax
LEAD: Joseph Schwantner is one of the more prolific and more successful of the middle generation of American composers.
Now in his mid-40's, he can count the Pulitzer Prize among his many honors, and requests for new works come his way with understandable frequency.
His Piano Concerto, which had its world premiere on Friday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, was commissioned by the First International Festival of the Arts (with support from Chase Manhattan Bank) for Emanuel Ax and the Saint Louis

Mom Says Goodbye to Nursery School
LEAD: The other evening my son and a dozen or so classmates pped up to his teacher and received an official-looking diploma, complete with ribbon.
It was the annual picnic of the cooperative nursery school where Sam had spent two years of his young life and from which he was now graduating.
My husband and I, bleary-eyed and reeling from the round of wholesome family activities that mark the end of every school year, looked on, slightly stunned, feeling as if we were watching a movie.

Don't Make Museum An Elitist Club
LEAD: Having read the June 5 article ''Museum Revamping After Years of Conflict,'' I can only hope that the Nassau County Museum of Fine Art's staff of six, who have credentials in the fine arts and were assessed by the American Association of Museums as ''well-trained, excited, caring professionals,'' will be able to function in that capacity, and not become discarded pawns in a power struggle that seems to be leaning toward making the museum an elitist club.

Truffaut Would Understand
LEAD: It is true, at least in this one respect, that the movies are like life: beautiful women are all over the place.
Beyond that - for me, anyway - the two media begin to diverge, each with its own inevitable vexations, though in the movies women are not among them.
After all, they exist in two dimensions only, and that really uncomplicates everything.


POSTINGS: Developing a Farm; Sweet Smell Of Success
LEAD: Tice Farms (established 1808) is an aromatic survivor.
Among the first family farms in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., Tice's apple orchard and roadside fruit-and-vegetable stand still set the standard.
The large barn-like stand on Chestnut Ridge Road is a mini-mall of produce and trinkets.
The northern Bergen County farm stayed intact as it was surrounded by wealthy suburbs such as Saddle River and Montvale, skirted by the Garden State

The Bunny Hops into History
LEAD: When the first Playboy Club opened in Chicago in 1960, a traveling businessman could ogle a curvy woman in a bunny outfit and believe he was somehow on the frontier of permissiveness.

At the end of this month, the last of Hugh Hefner's U.S.

Ali: Still Magic
LEAD: THE FISTS OF THE THREE-TIME world heavyweight champion, Muhammad Ali, the Greatest himself, were headed straight at my chin.

Numbing as it touched the exposed parts of my body where the mask and hood made imperfect seals.

IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: Decoding Deconstruction; A Whole New Style of Thinking
LEAD: SINCE it is an article of deconstructionist faith that a text has no fixed, single meaning, it probably shouldn't be surprising that books and articles written by deconstructionists are all but impossible for most other people to comprehend.
Deconstruction is not just another philosophy, its champions proclaim, but a whole new style of thinking - and, to the consternation of the uninitiated, a way of using language that is based on the assumption that our words can never really say what we mean.


Menage a Dickinson
LEAD: To the Editor:


Tie Benefits More Closely to Work

Mr.
Cleese, who wrote the script and plays a main role, is, of course, a veteran of British television's most wickedly inventive comic series.

THE PRO ATHLETE: HERO OR HARD HAT?
LEAD: The judge has spoken.
There will be no immediate free agency for some 300 National Football League players, but the cheers or sighs of relief from 28 owners and their commissioner ought not to be too loud.

Audrey Hochberg On Refuse Policy
LEAD: The County Government, which should be encouraging recycling and working to hold down refuse disposal taxes, is doing just the opposite.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  ANATOMY OF A SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY.
By Jeff Goldberg. (Bantam, $17.95.)

Treat the Causes, Not the Symptoms

Horchata
LEAD: To the Editor: One of my best memories of Madrid on a trip in 1971 was the thirst-quenching taste of horchata.
A friend and I used to go almost daily to the little stand in the main park for a glass.
Since I didn't speak Spanish, I thought it was made from coconut milk, but as the article by Penelope Casas (Travel, May 1) explained, it is made from an obscure

LEAD: The drought that has ravaged waterfowl nesting areas in Canada and the United States has produced habitat conditions described by some biologists as the worst they have ever seen.

Captivating Country Cousin
LEAD: MANHATTAN is invading Long Island.
This time it's more than the summer migration to the Hamptons.

As Ever, Democrats Would Prefer a Contest
LEAD: HUBERT H. HUMPHREY never tired of proclaiming Democratic dedication to ''the politics of joy.'' Fellow Democrats of various stripes have long insisted that, win or lose, love feast or fistfight, they have a lot more fun nominating their Presidential candidates than do the Republicans.
More noise, more disorder, more gleeful fratricide.


Who Are The League M.V.P.'s at This Stage?
LEAD: Before giving my midseason picks, let me suggest the Lou Gehrig award, given to the best offensive player in each league.
Then the m.v.p. award would go to those who truly are m.v.p.'s.

Part-Time Study For Graduate Students
LEAD: The article on opportunities in Connecticut for summertime study at the college and graduate level  [ ''New Season for Studying: The Summer,'' June 26 ]  was remiss in failing to take note of Wesleyan University's Graduate Liberal Studies Program.

Grand Slam And Then Some

Hi-Fi Show Ear-Catchers
LEAD: My colleague John Rockwell was actually writing about something else, but what he said aptly describes the state of audio: ''Most of almost anything is not very interesting.
Some of it is downright meretricious; much of it is mediocre or second-rate.
Occasionally something first-rate comes along.''


Atlanta Up Close; A Journey Into Black History
LEAD: REMNANTS of the history of blacks in the South are largely hidden, apart from the well-documented heritage trails in main cities.

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Too Bland a Response to Bias
LEAD: Like chicken soup, Governor Cuomo's new campaign to combat bigotry can't hurt and it may help.

When the State Legislature convenes again, it should put a bias-crime bill at the top of its list.


Steel and Glass Amid Greenery In La Villette
LEAD: LIKE a phoenix from the ashes, the hottest new attraction in Paris has risen on the site of the Fifth Republic's greatest financial scandal.

Throwing Like a Girl
LEAD: To the Editor:


Partnership Study Makes a Case For Low-Rises
LEAD: WHEN government and private groups get together to build low-cost housing, one of the issues they face is what kind of housing makes the most economic sense.

Joyner-Kersee Tops Herself, Again
LEAD: Jackie Joyner-Kersee completed her remarkable assault on another world record today in the heptathlon, finishing with 7,215 points at the United States track and field Olympic trials to become the first athlete to break 7,200 points, for her third world record in two years.


Headliners; At Odds
LEAD: The executive board of the teamsters' union picked William J. McCarthy as their new president last week, but it is uncertain how long Mr.

New Hampshire Ordinance Over Use of a Beach Creates a Privileged Class

It's a small beach for a small town.


Travel Advisory
LEAD:  A Museum On Frontier Life Gives Previews

Jet Lag
LEAD: To the Editor: In response to Practical Traveler of May 22 on jet lag, a phenomenon or myth, depending on one's view: It is the latter in my case.
I have made a fair number of trans-ocean flights and have never experienced it.


Romancing The Soul In the Bois
LEAD: WHEN I was 19 and full of romantic notions, I made the mistake of visiting the Bois de Boulogne in the warm sun of a summer afternoon.
This, I decided then and there, was how life was supposed to be.
This was Culture.
This was Civilization.
To my fevered, innocent eye, the Bois was the perfect embodiment of the dream picture I had painted in my mind of France.

How to Select Stamps and Where to Find Them
LEAD: IT seems perverse, but one of the biggest problems facing a new collector is where to find stamps.


Commuter Calls It Quits
LEAD: LAST year I lost my job at a major corporation in Manhattan.

Who Are The League M.V.P.'s at This Stage?
LEAD: The Mets' Darryl Strawberry has carried his team to its current lead.
When he doesn't hit, the Mets lose.


A Gainsborough Landscape
LEAD: IF John Constable's is the most familiar of all British artists' home territories, Thomas Gainsborough's is among the least.
The comparison would not have been such a pointed one had not these territories, which share a river, overlapped.
The two great painters were born 20 miles and 50 years apart in the Stour Valley, but due to

TAKE A POWDER
LEAD: THE GLITTERY shades of eyeshadow, the scarlet bullets of lipstick, the clouds of pink blusher - all are mere frippery compared to loose powder. ''Powders can make a woman's makeup,'' says Bobbi Brown, a makeup artist. ''I can easily use nothing but different powders on my face.'' But despite the versatility of loose powders, they've been relatively scarce at cosmetics counters.

Hans Holbein: A Great Poet Of Equanimity
LEAD: Some exhibitions are born great and could hardly be improved upon.
One of them is the exhibition of drawings by Hans Holbein the younger that can be seen at the Kunstmuseum in Basel through Sept. 4.

Reviews/Music; Vivaldi and Telemann as They Heard It
LEAD: If one didn't pay close attention, the new Mostly Mozart season's Thursday evening concert went amiably by.
The large friendly audience seemed to like it, though one wonders if its thunderous applause was not as much for Avery Fisher Hall's virtuosic air-conditioners as for the music itself.
The latter was by Vivaldi and Telemann, played by Christopher Hogwood and a small band of local musicians known as Music on Original Instruments.

But with many of the city's arteries clogged most of the time, and with Federal air-quality standards looming that could mandate sharply reduced automobile emissions by the early 1990's, traffic officials are being forced to consider alternatives that could strike at the very heart of the cherished tradition of driving one's own car even in midtown Manhattan.


Cute. Who's Her Agent?
LEAD: WHEN PLANS FOR A NEW STAGE version of Vincente Minnelli's 1944 movie musical ''Meet Me in St.
Louis'' were hatched, some of the people who now want to be in it couldn't yet speak, much less sing.

THE WORLD: Down With the Barriers; Europeans, East and West, Are Indulging in Revival
LEAD: OPTIMISM seems to have changed camps, leaving North America for Europe.
As the Reagan era glides bumpily to an end, America appears to be in an introspective and self-doubting mood, fretting about symptoms of decline.
But the Old Continent, both its capitalist and Communist halves, is palpably gripped by an unusual sense that momentous changes may be just over the horizon.


Defense Spending: Whose Welfare?
LEAD: Regarding your interview with Bruce Llewellyn  [ June 26, ''Helping Blacks Get Ahead'' ] , I must comment on Mr.

Major Patterns in the Festival Tapestry
LEAD: Some of the male and female partners in William Forsythe's ballet ''Love Songs'' - presented by the Frankfurt Ballet at the First New York International Festival of the Arts last month - got no closer to each other than the flashing of dirty looks.

LEAD: Richard Redgrave (1804-1888) was one of the many painters represented in ''Hard Times,'' the survey of Victorian social realism that was recently staged at the Yale Center for British Art.
But he was not the one who most deserved closer inspection.

Evon Z. Vogt Jr. (Travel, April 24), which recently came to my attention: The tendency to refer in English to the Yucatan is perfectly normal and correct.

POSTINGS: $40 Million Whitestone Project; Curtain-Raiser for the Hammerstein House
LEAD: Kiska Developers found a great little waterfront property off the Throgs Neck Bridge in the Whitestone section of Queens.

Christa Ludwig Sings Schubert's 'Winterreise'
LEAD: A cautiously worded paragraph of justification in the program notes for Deutsche Grammophon's new ''Winterreise'' recording (423 366-2) reminds us that in recent decades it has been considered unusual or inappropriate for a female singer to perform this work.

NO LONGER A SLAVE TO J.F.K. AIRPORT
LEAD: Living in proximity to a major city like New York has its advantages, but we ''country cousins'' have to be careful of blindly believing the ''big is better'' measure for competency.

Borge's presence alone sufficient reason to giggle, and for a while he played along happily with the crowd's mood.

At 17 State Street, High Tech Passes Into the Vernacular
LEAD: There is no airplane on the roof of the new office tower at 17 State Street in lower Manhattan, and there are no neon tubes in the lobby, or gigantic clocks, funny benches or umbrellas out front.

MAINSTREAM JAZZ IS ALIVE AND WELL IN TWO SERIES
LEAD: In the days when Be-bop was the new thing in jazz, people who liked traditional jazz used to be called moldy figs.
There's probably another derogatory name now for people who like be-bop, cool, New Orleans or any other mainstream jazz, but if so, it would have to apply to a lot of people.
For, to judge by the number and amount of record sales of older jazz, there are plenty of lovers of mainstream jazz out there.

Excerpts From Jackson's Speech: Pushing Party to Find Common Ground
LEAD: Following are excerpts from the prepared text of the speech by Jesse Jackson to the Democratic Convention last night, as recorded by The New York Times:


Company Logos, Signifying Nothing
LEAD: One of the mysterious compulsions of modern corporate life is the recurrent itch to convert familiar company logotypes into lifeless blobs.
Since the companies are willing to pay upward of six figures for this, they obviously don't do it casually.
But to the untrained eye, the reasoning - and sometimes the results - are hard to grasp.


WINE TALK
LEAD: SHOULD American wine makers emulate the French?


SUMMERTIME BRINGS FRESH RASPBERRIES IN PINTS AND PIES
LEAD: IT'S the season for fresh raspberries.
Half pints are $2.50 at farm stands and green markets in and around New York; fancy groceries sell them for $3.98.


Bastia Journal; In Napoleon's Homeland, a Rare Summer of Peace
LEAD: The violent few who want Corsica to secede from France have laid down their guns for the summer, permitting tourists to splash in the glistening Mediterranean or wander in the craggy mountains without being reminded of political grievances.


Yanks Get Caught In Ranger Deluge
LEAD: The Yankees' only real ally last night was the rain.
But even though it poured for more than two hours -and even though most in the crowd of 27,456 were chased home by the fifth inning - the two separate showers were no help.


Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''Tonight, I salute Governor Michael Dukakis.
He ran a well-managed, dignified campaign.
No matter how tired or how tried, he never stooped to demagoguery.''  - The Rev.
Jesse Jackson.  [ A1:6. ]

Deftly Crashing the Gates of the Rich
''Mr.
North'' is a comic fable about Theophilus North (Anthony Edwards), a clean-cut Yale graduate who has the self-assurance of a crackpot saint.
At the height of the 1926 summer season, Theophilus makes his way through the social maze of Newport, R.I., with the aplomb and springy step of a very young, very American Mr.
Hulot.
He tutors the children of the rich, teaches them tennis, and reads to the elderly in English, French, German, Italian and Hebrew.
He doesn't actually speak Hebrew, but he offers to bone up on it when a client resists his estimate of six weeks to read the Bible in English.
Theophilus says that since Hebrew has no vowels, the reading time could be reduced by one third.

Preventing The 'Brain Drain'
LEAD: Dr.
Norma Foreman Glasgow, the State Commissioner of Higher Education, has called attention to a problem which has begun to worry employers and government and community leaders - the migration of Connecticut college-bound youth.

TO THE FANS, HE'S STILL NO. 1
LEAD: What was that boy's name?
You remember him, Ted, the one the Dodgers picked up in the 22d round in 1965 and we signed the next year.
You didn't even own the Braves then, but we thought he'd put us on the map and rewrite National League history.


GARDENING MEANS WAR
LEAD: Michael Pollan's article ''Gardening Means War'' (June 19) was a direct hit.
I sat reading it, and laughed until I nearly cried, while, outside, a mother woodchuck was training her three youngsters in guerrilla tactics in my garden.
We have put the garden in a new spot this year.
Last year, after we jammed boulders into the gaping holes surrounding our vegetable patch, the resident woodchuck set up new underground quarters - with its main entrance in the middle of the snap beans.


FOCUS: Toronto; Economic Growth Foreseen Into 1990's
LEAD: WITH its reputation as a center of manufacturing and finance as well as its proximity to major United States cities, Toronto has emerged as one of Canada's economic bright spots.

And Then the Grass Grows Some More
LEAD: ''NO, I won't be needing the gardener this year,'' I declared in December, full of resolve.
I pushed up the sleeves of my sweater and anticipated the coming of summer.
Snow covered the ground outside my window as I wrote a note explaining my change of plans to the landscape gardener.


In Lakeville, Comfort of Past Era
LEAD: WAKE ROBIN INN'S current reincarnation may be its finest.

Wacky Comedy in Debut
LEAD: AS he tumbles out of the mouth of an M-G-M lion to a crescendo of lights and action, Charley Bacon roars, ''I don't want any more drama in my life.''

DiMaggio Released
LEAD: Looking as fit as a Hall of Fame center fielder should, Joe DiMaggio was discharged yesterday from the Miami Beach hospital where he underwent surgery 10 days earlier. ''His prognosis is excellent; the reason he recovered so well is that he's in excellent physical condition,'' said Dr.
Manuel Sivina, a vascular surgeon.

MEESE: IMPROPRIETY APPEARS BUT IT'S OPEN TO INTERPRETATION
LEAD: As a legal judgment on the conduct of Edwin Meese 3d while Attorney General, the independent counsel's report last week appears destined to remain ambiguous.

Meese had probably violated some income tax and conflict-of-interest laws, he decided not to prosecute.


A Hard Sell for Audi
LEAD: NEXT month, Audi of America will introduce the Audi 100 and 200, two new models whose success or failure will reach far beyond industry sales charts.
If the cars are a hit, the beleaguered luxury division of Volkswagen of America may be able to restore its image as a producer of refined luxury-performance cars.


Question Of the Week; What Should Righetti's Role Be?
LEAD: Dave Righetti's role should be pitching the ninth for the Mets.
That way they would be in second place, too.

LEAD: In an age of atomic bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles, old-fashioned cannon still pour out of the Watervliet Arsenal, which this month is celebrating its 175th anniversary of producing arms for the United States Army.


Avoiding a Sunburn With Pills and Patches
LEAD: TOO busy to pack sun lotion?
You could wear a pliable plastic bracelet that snaps open to dispense an ounce of waterproof suntan oil.
Called Handy Tan - and available in four colors at some convenience stores and health food outlets - the item can be strapped onto the wrist or ankle or worn in the hair.


Correction
LEAD: The Bridge column in the Pastimes page July 17th had an incorrect bidding with South bidding double.

Italy to Take Back Waste
LEAD: Two Italian ships will be sent to retrieve several tons of unspecified toxic waste left in Koko, a Nigerian port that has been the site of a controversy over the dumping of toxic waste in West Africa, Civil Defense Minister Vito Lattanzio said Friday.
The announcement was expected to ease tensions between Italy and Nigeria and lead to the release of the Italian freighter Piave, which was seized by Nigeria pending a resolution of the waste issue.


Who Is the Enemy in Mexico Drug War?
LEAD: Most of the people of the vast desert state of Sonora have always regarded the Mexican Government's war against the drug trade as something that has little to do with them and their daily lives.

James Dearden: Life After 'Fatal Attraction'

Correction
LEAD: A chart on third world missile deployment in The Week in Review on July 3 was incorrectly labeled.
The headline should have said that the chart listed only ''nuclear capable'' missiles (defined as those with a range of greater than 190 miles and a payload of greater than 1,100 pounds), and the footnote should have said that countries listed with question marks were reported to be seeking the missiles indicated, not that they already had them.

Review/Theater; Guilt and Secret Pain In Australian Drama

Preaching to the Unconverted
LEAD: To hear David Zinman tell it, turning 50 a couple of years ago wasn't all that bad.
For one thing, it gave him the courage of some still-unorthodox Beethovenian convictions - like observing the composer's metronome markings, phrasing in a style closer to Mozart than to Mahler, even adding Baroque-style ornaments in the earlier symphonies.


WESTERN CIV AND ITS CHILDREN
LEAD: There is great controversy today about the character and quality of American education.
A longstanding concern with the nation's schools, elementary and secondary, has in recent years been made even more dramatic by reports of decline at the highest level in America's colleges and universities.

A Summer Dessert of Berries
LEAD: DESSERTS are easy in the summer.
As berries become cheaper they can be made into tarts and pies - and summer pudding, my favorite of all.
This English dessert, made with raspberries, blackberries and red currants, is a beautiful ruby-red dome that tastes as wonderful as it looks.
I rarely let a summer go by without making it.

LEAD: Watching the New York City Opera's handsome production of Sigmund Romberg's ''New Moon'' on Wednesday, it was easy to see how the 1928 operetta came to enjoy two film incarnations within 12 years of its premiere.
Set in New Orleans around the time of the French Revolution, it has everything M-G-M's moguls wanted in a musical: a lightly baked plot, generous doses of romance and idealism (offset by both swashbuckling and comedy) and a frothy, lyrical score packed with hit tunes (''Stouthearted Men,'' ''Lover, Come Back to Me'' and ''One

Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''You'll never hear that 'L' word - liberal - from them.


Make Money. Have Fun. Be Ethical.
LEAD: LATELY I've done a lot of thinking about ethics in business.
This might be because my job is very competitive.
I'm in charge of getting new clients for my firm, a medium-sized advertising agency with a reputation for memorable commercials.
Trying to win an advertising account in a contest with other agencies has to be one of the most intense forms of business competition.


GARDENING MEANS WAR
LEAD: We experienced the woodchuck invasion last summer and we had a fence.
Nothing deterred them.
Wildlife experts advised us to set humane traps, then drive to some distant, wooded area and release them.
Somehow, transporting woodchucks in the back of my new car appealed to me less than giving up my garden-fresh produce.


A Family Defends Its Dynasty
LEAD: IT is one of the great family dynasties in corporate America.
McGraw-Hill Inc., the publishing giant founded in 1909, has had a McGraw at the helm through two world wars, the Depression and into the electronic era.


Barbecue
LEAD: To the Editor: The articles about the debate over barbecue (Travel, July 3) certainly hit home - in fact, two homes.
My North Carolinian husband, after a dozen years in New Jersey, still refuses to call a cookout a barbecue.
It is certainly true that we Jerseyans call the act of cooking any meat on a grill, with or without sauce, a barbecue.


BASEBALL: American League; Red-Hot Red Sox Roll to 10th Straight
LEAD: The Boston Red Sox charged to their 10th consecutive victory today, beating the Chicago White Sox, 11-5.

Fancies Flow in a Quiet Garden As Californians Experiment With Outdoor Chairs
LEAD: What does the word ''chair'' suggest?
Lots of different things, no doubt: anything from a folding chair to a fauteuil, from Chippendale to Charles Eames.
As for ''the chair,'' it can equally well conjure up a symbol of authority - the chair that a chairman takes - and the electric chair.


Anne Williamson Wed to a Lawyer
LEAD: The Community Congregational Church in Short Hills, N.J., was the setting yesterday for the marriage of Anne Campbell Williamson, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

FOCUS: Toronto; Growth Foreseen Into 1990's
LEAD: WITH its reputation as a center of manufacturing and finance as well as its proximity to major United States cities, Toronto has emerged as one of Canada's economic bright spots.
Last year there was record demand for office space, and as a trade agreeement with the United States nears approval, the business community is geared up for continued economic growth in the 1990's.


Talk of Women, Parties and Wives
LEAD: JUST as the New Jersey Democratic Party chairman, Raymond M. Durkin, was about to speak on party unity Monday morning to his state's delegates at the Democratic National Convention, loud cries came from the back of the room.


A 'Tanless Society' by the Year 2000?
LEAD: IN the wake of warnings that sun exposure damages skin, many beachgoers have suddenly turned sun-shy.
A survey last year by the American Academy of Dermatology found that 96 percent of all adults could name at least one negative effect of the sun - and 54 percent singled out skin cancer, the most serious danger.


Are We Getting Value For Education Dollars?
LEAD: Recently you printed some most interesting letters about the social problem of educating the handicapped.


One Convention Rite Lives On

America the Possible
LEAD: ''It's reached a point in this country where Rosa Parks is a heroine to everyone.''


With Friends
LEAD: To the Editor: Betsy Wade's article reminded me of a technique I've used with groups even as small as two.
Each of the possible companions prepares for the others two short lists: Things I Can't Do Without and Things I Can't Stand.
If one party refuses to miss the glories of sunrise and another can't bear to get up before 10, best to know it early on.

The Long and the Short of Museum Loans
LEAD: Woven into the fabric of every major museum there are two kinds of thread.
Both are important.
Both are invisible to the casual eye.
One is the thread of the long loan - the work of art that is by now so much at home in the museum that we forget that it belongs to someone else and can be withdrawn at any time.

LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Arnold L. Windman of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and Hilton Head, S.C., have announced the engagement of Mrs.

Foreign Policy Is the Last Refuge of a Lame-Duck Team
LEAD: Foreign affairs presents a singular opportunity for a lame-duck Administration.
The time has passed for new domestic initiatives, and White House nominees for judgeships are languishing on Capitol Hill, while the political world has shifted much of its focus to the campaign trail.


Young Pirates Bring Out That Old Fan Spirit
LEAD: The most telling sound to come from the confluence of the Ohio, Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers on Friday night was not the succession of roars produced by the big crowd at Three Rivers Stadium.
It was a sound that had more to do with the respect the Pittsburgh Pirates have earned than a celebration of what they have achieved.


Flach-Seguso Wins And U.S. Advances
LEAD: Ken Flach and Robert Seguso defeated Christian Miniussi and Javier Frana of Argentina, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4, today to give the United States an insurmountable 3-0 lead and send the Americans into the group of 16 nations that will compete for the Davis Cup next year.

STREETSCAPES: Bronx Borough Courthouse; For an Abandoned Civic Landmark, a Second Life?

LEAD: Two decades into a national experiment with legalized gambling that has seen 28 states and the District of Columbia adopt lotteries to raise money for education and other services, uneasiness about social consequences is growing.


A Summer Dessert of Berries
LEAD: DESSERTS are easy in the summer.
As berries become cheaper they can be made into tarts and pies - and summer pudding, my favorite of all.
This English dessert, made with raspberries, blackberries and red currants, is a beautiful ruby-red dome that tastes as wonderful as it looks.
I rarely let a summer go by without making it.


Question Of the Week; What Should Righetti's Role Be?
LEAD: Dave Righetti could break the record book in many categories if he became a starting pitcher again, but I know he would go crazy waiting every fifth day to pitch.

Collecting Your Wisdom in a System
LEAD: ''YOU can drive yourself crazy reading through all these annual reports unless you learn a few tricks,'' one of my first bosses cautioned. ''The first thing I do is glance at the accountant's message at the back.
If it's one or two paragraphs long, everything is on the up and up.
If it goes to three paragraphs there may be some hanky-panky going on, so then you turn to the president's picture to see if he's smiling.

Headliners; Sounding Familiar

He did that by publicly apologizing for liberally using, without attribution, another writer's material in a magazine article he had written.

A Teacher's Gift Is Returned In Kind
LEAD: IT'S the last week of school and I want to give my 11th- and 12th-grade students something, something that isn't a reading assignment, essay or vocabulary test.
I'd like to hand out a rosary bead of truth that they can touch in future bad times for wisdom and comfort.
But what would be appropriate?

NEW MODELS OFFER MORE FOR LESS
LEAD: Partly it is the setting that gives the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago a distinctly festive air.
Unique among American cities - and comparable to the famed waterside esplanades of Geneva and Montreux - Chicago has developed much of its lakefront as a vast park dotted with beaches, fountains and statuary.


That Old Sweet Song Lives On
LEAD: Of all the pop styles that flourished in the 60's and early 70's, none seems quainter today than the romantic psychedelia tapped by the Beatles, Beach Boys, the Bee Gees, the Moody Blues and Donovan.
Although the sticky, sugar-frosted sound that characterized songs like ''Strawberry Fields'' and ''Wouldn't It Be Nice'' eventually lost its cachet, pop fans still have a soft spot for the music's heady romanticism.


Travel Advisory; Italy Acts To Reduce Air Congestion
LEAD: In a move to ease summer congestion, the Italian Transport Ministry has opened five former military air spaces to commercial flights, allowing more air traffic from northern Europe.

BREAKING ALL THE RULES

Reviews/Dance; Leads Change in 'Onegin'
LEAD: The National Ballet of Canada gave a polished account of John Cranko's ''Onegin'' on Wednesday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera House.
The dancing was smooth and clear, and the performance revealed that this is a very carefully trained company.

TALKING: Conversions; Rules for Switching Apartments
LEAD: A MODIFIED form of musical chairs is being played more and more often in and around New York City whenever a rental building is converted to a co-op or condominium.

LEAD: Under the title ''The Big Squeeze,'' the Serious Fun festival at Alice Tully Hall assembled a diverse passel of accordionists Friday night.

What Taxpayers and Their Teams Do for Each Other

LEAD: To offer $72,000 co-ops from a total rehabilitation in Yonkers, Kurt Wittek said, it helps to start with an inexpensive shell.

WHAT'S DOING IN: SEOUL
LEAD: The residents of Seoul don't just walk the streets.

Battery Park City Looks Inward For Innovation
LEAD: It is no secret among those who live at Battery Park City, the much-acclaimed complex of condominiums, office towers and commercial space in lower Manhattan, that the quality of the apartments themselves is less than stellar.

Repertorio Espanol Goes on With el Espectaculo
LEAD: Repertorio Espanol is 20 years old this summer, a milestone the company is too busy to observe and one that is unlikely to seize the attention of New York's mainstream theater world.
Repertorio, which remains adamantly Castilian in tongue, tone and tune, is one of the more venerable professional repertory groups in the nation, and offers a profusion of plays, dance and musicals that would, in its native land, be at center stage in the cultural scene.

Into the Mouths of Babes
LEAD: IT IS WELL WITHIN THE REACH of most white-collar criminals to assume an air of irreproachable virtue, especially when they're about to be sentenced.

What Have We Got to Lose?
LEAD: A ''PUBLIC be damned'' monopolist of the last century would scarcely have dared as much: to charge more for less.

THE ORDERLY RISE OF A NEW KIND OF DEMOCRAT
LEAD: On one side stood Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the courtly embodiment of the Democratic Party's conservative wing.
On the other, the Rev.

In the middle was Michael Stanley Dukakis, the nominee of the Democratic National Convention, and he was smiling.


Headliners; Pronouncing Sentence
LEAD: Perhaps the only consolation that the Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas could find at his sentencing in Florida last week was that the judge did not quite throw the book at him.

Comical 'Family Viewing'
''Family Viewing'' was shown as part of the recent ''New Directors/ New Film'' series.
Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 23.
The film opens today at the Bleecker Street Cinema 1, at La Guardia Place.
Video cameras and monitors watch over the characters in Atom Egoyan's ''Family Viewing'' with the patience and passivity of vultures, but without the enthusiasm.

Egoyan's very peculiar black comedy, and it's their listlessness that makes them so funny and sad.

What'd They Say? A-Wop-Bop A-Loo-Bop
LEAD: The other night at the Cat Club, David Thomas of Pere Ubu was introducing ''Final Solution,'' a song about a teen-age wallflower the band recorded a decade ago and had disdained until other groups revived it.

Temporarily Unchilled
LEAD: South Africa has wisely suspended temporarily a proposal that would require some journalists to register or face heavy fines or jail.

WHEN FEMINISM FAILED
LEAD: I don't wish to deny Mary Anne Dolan's experience as the editor of The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, but it doesn't necessarily follow that capable women promoted to positions of power become backstabbers (''When Feminism Failed,'' June 26).
Her attempt to turn her newsroom into a matriarchal family failed because of some fatal errors in concept and execution.


Elizabeth C. Gray Engaged To Marry Leonard J. Buck
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Owen Moore Jr. of Winston-Salem, N.C., have made known the engagement of Mrs.

Venice Inside and Out
LEAD: Inside Venice, for us, was located only two brisk turns behind San Marco, ''the central building of the world,'' in the city that in certain moods looks as if it might still, for coherent beauty, rank as the central city of the world.
In 1987, when we were looking for a pied-a-terre in Venice, we were unexpectedly offered one, gratis, by a learned and charming Bolognese doctor, at that time unknown to us, who happens to agree with Ruskin about San Marco and the esthetic perfections of La Serenissima - the most Serene, an old name for Venezia.

Ellington in Everything but the Name
LEAD: In 1936, Duke Ellington began taking members of his orchestra into the studio to make small-group recordings that appeared under their names, but under his direction.
The pieces he constructed, riff by riff, melody by melody, solo by solo, are some of the most brilliant music America has produced.


Battered Yankees Win to Keep Up
LEAD: The pre-game medical report sounded distinctly like an alarm.
Lou Piniella checked off names and injuries and possible alternatives.

A Drug Problem for All the Americas
LEAD: AS soon as drugs emerged as a big issue in this year's American election campaign, nervous Latin American governments braced themselves for more accusations, aware that vote-seeking politicians in the United States would once again blame the supply of cocaine, heroin and marijuana from the south for the devastating impact of drugs in the north.


'Commissar' Director Is Upset by U.S. Distributor's Cuts
LEAD: Aleksandr Askoldov, the Soviet director of ''Commissar,'' was able to endure Moscow's 21-year suppression of his film by refusing to give up hope for its eventual success, only to find at its screening at the Library of Congress that it had been cut by its American distributor.

Q And A

How can you account for this? -L.
B.
H., Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.

POSTING: N.J. Conversions; Union City Blooms
LEAD: Not so long ago, Union City, N.J., was the only community between the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels that had not seen a great deal of residential construction and conversion.
While nearby cities like Weehawken and Hoboken have sprouted new condominiums and cooperatives whose marketing is directed at New York City across the harbor, landlocked Union City seemed to remain insular, concentrating on its own commercial districts along Bergenline Avenue and Kennedy Boulevard.


Teheran Reports Successes Along the Battlefront

Naval Chief Sees Technology Advancing Fleet
LEAD: In the Navy of the 21st century, submerged submarines will be able to shoot at airplanes, stealth fighters that evade radar will be flown from aircraft carriers and laser beams will protect warships, according to the chief of naval operations, Adm.
Carlisle A. H. Trost.


Where Freshness Is Foremost
LEAD: NOT every restaurant makes its own desserts and salad dressings.
Bruce's in Wainscott does.

THE REGION: La Guardia to Koch; Why New York's Mayors Pursue A Foreign Policy
LEAD: MAYOR KOCH returned home from abroad last week to find a city - his city - where ambulances were breaking down at a fearsome clip, where hypodermic needles and other debris were rolling in with the tides.

Exploring the Effects of Color On the Emotions and the Mind

Taking a Team Approach to Soviet Trade
LEAD: ROBERT J. CARBONELL remembers it all too well.
About 12 years ago, Standard Brands Inc. (now a part of RJR Nabisco Inc.) was talking to a since-disbanded branch of the Soviet Union's agricultural ministry about producing high-fructose corn syrup in Russia.
Soviet officials broached the idea, so presumably they did all they could to ease the company's path.

LEAD: To the Editor:


A Fashion Designer for Whom Consistency Is Key
LEAD: CAROLYNE ROEHM has been going to Southampton since summer 1973, the year she arrived in New York with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Washington University.

Corrections

Practical Traveler; Dial O for Operator, Yes - but Which Operator?
LEAD: While vacationing recently in Vail, Colo., Kirk Bloede, a New York investment banker, decided to phone home.

BASIC BLACK

Reviews/Music;  The Son Seals Band and Jean-Paul Bourelly
LEAD: Jean-Paul Bourelly opened a blues show at the Central Park Band Shell on July 23 with a version of Memphis Slim's ''Mother Earth.'' Mr.
Bourelly, who is one of the most exciting young guitarists in New York, owes a lot to Jimi Hendrix, not so much in his improvising as in his group conception and his singing.


The Playwright as Prosecutor
LEAD: The theater, Federico Garcia Lorca said, is a public tribunal in which mankind ''submits as evidence old or mistaken lessons and explains with living examples the eternal norms of the heart and of human sentiment.'' All over Latin America in recent years, the heirs of the great Spanish playwright and poet have been busy applying his dictum, and it is that spirit that animates the works they bring to the monthlong 12th Festival Latino in New

Going Global
LEAD: To the Editor:


Soviet Union
LEAD: To the Editor: Odessa and Yalta, both Urkranian cities, were identified as Soviet cities.

Headliners; Back to Earth
LEAD: Elegant in the clinging draperies of her period, but looking sturdy enough to have pulled a plow back home on Mount Olympus, a 2,400-year-old goddess believed to be Aphrodite has been causing a stir in the world of classical art.
The J. Paul Getty Museum announced last week that it had acquired the marble-and-limestone statue of the goddess, seven and a half feet tall, for an undisclosed price.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  SKULLDUGGERY, by Peter Marks. (Carroll &amp; Graf, $4.50.) For years amateur historians have tried to discover who perpetrated the hoax of the Piltdown man by planting the bones that tricked anthropologists into believing they had found the missing link.
Last year, our reviewer, Patrick McGrath, said the imaginary solution offered in this novel was unconvincing but that Peter Marks ''displays a masterly grasp of the scientific subtleties  [ and ]  an extensive familiarity with the lives and works of the famous men who grace his pages.


Question Of the Week; Are You Following The Leadup To the Olympics?

I say yes on both counts.


Reviews/Music; Post-Punk Rock 'n' Roll By Australia's Divinyls

Going From Music-Lovers to Mass Market
LEAD: IF there is a silvery glint in the eyes of music sellers and listeners, it is the reflection of millions of compact disks being popped into compact disk players.
About seven million compact disk players have been sold since 1983, the year they were introduced.
Over the past five years they have been selling better than video cassette recorders, of which 1.1 million were sold from 1983 through 1987, according to Link Resources, a New York-based market research group.


On Martha's Vineyard, A Drive Against Mopeds
LEAD: Several times this year a group of residents here on Martha's Vineyard have been driven through town on a flatbed truck, some of them dressed in bandages made to look bloody.

How Our Presidential Candidates Are Tested
LEAD: To the Editor:


A Fan's Ode To Risen Star
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


THE EVERLASTING CONSTRUCTION SITE
LEAD: Offering his own suggestion as to why the third President remained wholly preoccupied with building himself a house for nearly all of his long life, Jack McLaughlin says that the creation of Monticello might have been a form of adult play.
In the light of his entrancing study of the bricks-and-mortar Thomas Jefferson, this is not at all a farfetched conclusion.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. We used our charcoal barbecue grill on the porch and as a result some of the painted siding on the house is blackened.
Can you suggest how I can remove this eyesore?

From the '50's, 'Summer Cooking' Remains Fresh
LEAD: A NEW edition of ''Summer Cooking'' by Elizabeth David has just been published by Penguin ($8.95, paper).
First published in 1955, it remains as fresh as ever. ''A grilled chicken is perhaps one of the nicest foods at any time,'' is a statement that could be written today.


House Gifts, Welcome and Unwelcome
LEAD: A CROQUET set, Lorna R. Cameron thought.
Yes, a croquet set would be an inspired house gift for the weekend she was invited to her friends' new place in the Poconos.
There, she was led to believe, she would find a lovely green ''English-type rolling lawn'' in front of the house.

Page 22.
Texas Rivalry Deepens

Iran and Iraq Sharply Divided in U.N. Talks

The Fight Against Prejudice Must Continue on All Fronts
LEAD: Bias crimes, those having an racial, ethnic or religious component, continue to be the focus of law-enforcement agencies, educational decision makers and other community forces.
Race and racial issues continue to be of concern as well.


American Express Goes High-Tech
LEAD: IN recent months, holders of the American Express card have seen a change in their billing statements.
In the past, the bills came with a bulky packet of paper receipts of purchases.
Today those slips have been supplanted by neat laser-printed sheets containing as many as eight reduced images of the original receipts on a single page.

WESTCHESTER GUIDE
LEAD:  CHAMPIONSHIP SWIM


Sports of The Times; Night Games at Wrigley Field: Some Call It Progress
LEAD: A glossy black-and-white photograph came across the desk showing an aerial view of Wrigley Field in its new nighttime garb.
A longtime Wrigley Field fan and a keeper of the flame for old-time virtues looked at it. ''I hate it,'' he said. ''It looks beautiful.'' Indeed it did.
There was the flush of light on the ball field and this was set against the black velvet background of the surrounding city streets with their own diamond-sprinkle of lights.


In Botswana, A Democracy In Full Voice
LEAD: The dissonance of democracy echoes loudly through this country of seemingly endless desert and bush.


Reviews/Music; Icelandic Sugar Cubes Rock the World
LEAD: The Sugar Cubes, who had been kept from playing here in June by visa problems, finally made it to New York and played their debut performance to a packed audience at the World on Thursday night.
The group, from Iceland, has a good idea: it mixes a touch of punk noise and anarchism with a new-wave, near-folk melodicism.


No More Identity Crisis In Canada
LEAD: What is the National Ballet of Canada?
For nearly three decades it seemed to model itself after Britain's Royal Ballet; then suddenly, a few years ago, it began to resemble American Ballet Theater.
Nowadays, it looks, believe it or not, like the National Ballet of Canada - a company that has finally found its true identity.


Alice Chasan, Editor, Wed To Jeffrey Charles Kanige
LEAD: Alice Chasan, a daughter of the late Harriet and Raymond Chasan of Jersey City, and Jeffrey Charles Kanige, the son of Mr. and Mrs. and Charles Kanige of Center Moriches, L.I., were married yesterday in Princeton, N.J.

Spoonbread, Virginia's Choice
LEAD: In the South, as in many parts of the United States, regional cooking has given way to Chinese, Japanese and Mexican takeout, nouvelle French or what passes for it, and almost anything but what transplanted Virginians and Carolinians will tell you was standard fare in their childhood kitchens or the dining room of the local hotel.


POSTING: Planning Commission; 2 Schools On Agenda
LEAD: Sometimes thought to pass judgment only on the follies of private developers, the New York City Planning Commission will meet Wednesday after a month's break, with schools and housing for the elderly topping the agenda.

Boston:  Houghton Mifflin Company. $17.95


PUSHING CIGARETTES OVERSEAS
LEAD: The thrust of Peter Schmeisser's article on American cigarette exports was predictable from its title, ''Pushing Cigarettes Overseas'' (July 10).
However, whether one likes or dislikes a product is a matter quite apart from whether or not it should be treated equitably in world trade.
Some people think we would be better off without televisions and motorcycles, but the existence of those products worldwide is a matter of everyday reality.


Anne Murtagh Is Married To Gerard Hannon in Rye
LEAD: At the Roman Catholic Church of the Resurrection in Rye, N.Y., Anne Theresa Murtagh, an associate at Brown &amp; Wood, and Gerard V. Hannon, a partner in Coudert Brothers, both Manhattan law firms, were married yesterday by Msgr.
William B. Smith.


Far From the San Marco Crowd
LEAD: Henry James, who on another occasion admitted to a perpetual love affair with Venice, once described the city as a vast museum where the little wicket that admits you is perpetually turning and creaking, a place you march through with a herd of fellow gazers.


IN QUOTES
LEAD: ''In New York the distinction between hostile and friendly takeovers has been very much blurred.'' - Yoshiji Fukushima, executive vice president, Nomura Securities.


Stirrings of Peace
LEAD: Suddenly, a season of peace seems to be warming the world.
The last few months have seen five bitter and protracted conflicts brought suddenly closer to peaceful resolution.
In the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Central America, populations stunned and bleeding by endless regional war look up and hope.


A Chicago Showcase for Chicago Architecture
LEAD: One architect's presence hovers over all of the sprawling exhibition, ''Chicago Architecture 1872-1922: Birth of a Metropolis'' that has just opened at the Art Institute of Chicago.
It is not Louis Sullivan or Daniel Burnham or even Frank Lloyd Wright, prominent though they all are in this show.
None of these great men of history holds a position here quite equal to that of Stanley Tigerman, the


Suppliers Balking at Pentagon Certification Policy
LEAD: A number of military contractors are contending that a new Pentagon policy requiring them to certify that they have not received inside information in the bidding process is overly restrictive and could leave them in a legally untenable position.


The Allure of Mapplethorpe's Photographs
LEAD: If style and its permutations, fashionability and taste, are major topics of late 80s art, then Robert Mapplethorpe is perhaps the most topical artist of the moment.
Less than 20 years since he first decided to make art with a camera, his elegant but often provocative photographs are being heralded as exemplars of the new stylish sensibility.


Shouts and Whispers About Sex
LEAD: America may pride itself as socially advanced, but to read two recent studies from the Alan Guttmacher Institute is to conclude that when it comes to sex and its consequences, this country is downright backward.


Band Playing, Mexico Frees An Oil 'King'
LEAD: As a mariachi band struck up ''The King'' and loyal political supporters waved banners proclaiming him to be ''a man who lost his freedom but not his dignity,'' Jorge Diaz Serrano emerged from prison this morning, five years to the day after he was first jailed on charges of defrauding Mexico's state oil monopoly of $34 million in an elaborate kickback scheme.

LEAD: The marriage of Celeste E. Hynes, a daughter of Mary E. Hynes of Westport, Conn., and the late Edward J. Hynes, to Thomas G. Wolfe, the son of John F. Wolfe of Saratoga, Calif., and the late Beverly Bergman Wolfe, took place yesterday at the Assumption Roman Catholic Church in Westport.

Role for Shoreham: Nuclear Waste Museum
LEAD: The agreement by New York State with Lilco to take over the abandoned plant at Shoreham can have a more hopeful resolution than the dismantling of this $5.3 billion white elephant.

LEAD: To the Editor:


NONFICTION
LEAD:  IMPROVISATION: Music From the Inside Out.
By Mildred Portney Chase. (Creative Arts, Paper, $7.95.) Improvisation, as we are often reminded, is concert music's lost art.
Two hundred years ago, cadenzas in concerto movements served to launch the individual performer's flights of fancy; cadenzas today are simply repetitions of what someone else has already written out.


CIVIC ENVOY: Toshio Nagamura; A Japanese Banker's Bid to Cement U.S.-Japanese Ties
LEAD: IN his dark blue suit, slicked-back black hair and quiet formal manner, Toshio Nagamura might seem at first like the typical Japanese businessman in America, astute but essentially detached from the American environment.


Headliners; Back to Manila?
LEAD: Ferdinand E. Marcos said he is willing to forget the whole thing, support the Philippine President and stay out of politics if he can just go home.
But whatever the offers of ''reconciliation,'' as he put it last week, the Government of Corazon C. Aquino denied that any negotiations were under way.


The Legend of Oliver North

CRIME
LEAD: When Robert B. Parker came out with ''The Godwulf Manuscript'' in 1974, it was immediately apparent that an important contributor to the private-eye genre had appeared.
Mr.
Parker's hero, Spenser, a Boston detective, was big and tough, yet literate - and a gourmet cook to boot.
Some splendid books ensued.

Hospital Gowns: Major Openings on All Fronts
LEAD: BY chance I visited three doctors in one day recently - one for a mammography, one to examine a lump on my first rib, and one to X-ray that lump.
That meant that I had the opportunity to wear three types of hospital gowns in one day, making me realize that no major changes had occurred in gown design in recent years, despite great progress in so many other areas affecting women.


CELEBRATING THE BARD WITH 'TWELFTH NIGHT'
LEAD: NEXT month's ''Twelfth Night'' performances in New Haven represent coincidental celebrations of contrasting scope: the city's 350th anniversary and the fifth year of its free outdoor series, Shakespeare on the Green.
Ironically, the city's costly commemorative festivities almost prevented the show on the green from going on, according to its director, Amy Seham.

A Man Recalls the Boy He Played in 'Commissar'
LEAD: It has been 20 years since an impish-looking boy with dark eyes, curly hair and an infectious grin was chosen from hundreds of Soviet children by the director Alexander Askoldov to play the leading child in his 1967 film, ''Commissar.'' No sooner was the film finished than it was banned by the authorities for its frank treatment of Soviet anti

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


The Defense Speaks for Mark Belanger
LEAD: IT may well be that nothing funny happened to Willie Stargell on his way to induction today into the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, but something passing strange seems to have affected at least a few of the people whose votes helped put him there.
I should know.
I was one of them.


In London This Summer, Masses of Old Masters
LEAD: Old master paintings have been at home in London for close on 400 years, but right now there is what might be called a new nonchalance in the way in which they come into view.
It is not that they are taken for granted - how could they be, when so many of them have been made new for us by recent cleaning?


Question Of the Week; Are You Following The Leadup To the Olympics?
LEAD: Yes.
But for objective media coverage I have to turn to sources other than the home press and television.
The domestic media continue to report on the Olympics with a parochial fervor that borders on arrogance.


Is Modern Recycling Really Progress?
LEAD: As a believer in the conservation of our natural resources, I have always been enthusiastic about the benefits of recycling empty bottles and cans.
So it was a sad day recently when I nearly gave in to the temptation to simply throw away my returns rather than go through what was turning out to be an exasperating procedure for a cleaner environment.


Ethics and Fetal Research: Government Begins to Move
LEAD: FOR years, scientists who wanted to do research involving human embryos and fetuses have found themselves in a Catch-22 situation.
They could do their work with impunity, and receive Federal funds for it, so long as an ethics advisory board approved their proposals.
The catch is that the board does not exist, and has not for nearly a decade.


A Devoted New York City Fireman in Every Way, Save One
LEAD: When the end of World War I was announced, 10-year-old Louis Albert Taube climbed into the driver's seat of a horse-drawn fire engine, pulled the steam whistle and decided he was going to be a fireman.

Upper Maine Youths Go South to New Horizons
LEAD: For the last six weeks, Kerry Pelletier, a high school student from a tiny Maine town on the Canadian border, has seen how the other half lives.


Protecting Benefits After Retirement
LEAD: IN 1984, Fairchild Industries offered early retirement to a group of executives as part of a cost-cutting plan.
Henry H. Henderson, then 61 years old, was one of those who accepted the offer, in part because he thought he had been promised free medical insurance until 65.
Two years later, however, Mr.

How the Spell Was Broken for Bolcom's 'Etudes'
LEAD: William Bolcom began his ''Twelve New Etudes'' for piano - the works that won him this year's Pulitzer Prize for music - in 1977, and almost didn't complete them.

Giving New and Longer Life to Vintage Shows
LEAD: If you were to go to the Museum of Broadcasting this week to watch and listen to all its television and radio programs end to end, without sleeping, you would not finish by the time the museum moves to its new building on West 52d Street, two years from now.
This preposterous suggestion is only meant to hint at the magnitude of the museum's latest undertaking: Tomorrow, to coincide with the construction of the building, the Museum of


At the Kouros in ridgefield, Art Complements Nature
LEAD: THE Kouros Sculpture Center in Ridgefield, is still a work in progress and at 14, the number of artists is pretty much the same as it was when the reviewer visited two years ago.
Three of the names are new, though, and thecollection, seemingly larger, has settled into the hundred rolling acres at its disposal.


Houston vs. Dallas: A Boom, a Bust, Two Cities and One Intense Rivalry
LEAD: At the height of Texas's late great boom, all roads led here to the overheated oil town that defined the state in the 1970's.

Not Moving
LEAD: THE owner of the Seattle Mariners announced that he would not take immediate advantage of an escape clause in his lease with the Kingdome that would allow him to move the team to another city next season.

What Once Was Under Is Now Over
LEAD: THEIR mothers and grandmothers - according to the famous advertisements that ran from the late 1940's into the 60's - dreamed of showing up at the poshest of places clad in their Maidenform bras.
Last Thursday night at a disco party at the Copacabana nightclub, a hundred or so avant-garde denizens of the city's fashion subculture made mom's and grannie's dream come true.


CLASIC bLACK
LEAD: In the contemporary design world, black conjures up images of sleek, high-tech objects and stark spaces.
But countless old-fashioned decorative accessories are black, too.
Indeed, black can be as romantic and alluring as it can be gloomy, perhaps because it is an earth pigment that in the color spectrum expresses violet.


Olympic Athlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee
LEAD: TOWARD THE end of a steamy afternoon at the United States Olympic track and field trials in Indianapolis two weeks ago, Jackie Joyner-Kersee listened intently as her coach and husband, Bob Kersee, talked about the 200-meter sprint, her next task in the seven-event, two-day heptathlon.
Run the curve as if it were the straightaway, her coach told her, and the straightaway will take care of itself.
