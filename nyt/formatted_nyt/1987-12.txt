LEAD: Undefeated Miami hopes to end the regular college football season the way it started and finished the last one, with a victory over South Carolina and a shot at final No. 1 ranking.

LEAD: Harry Carson is 34 years old, the Giants' Pro Bowl inside linebacker, defensive captain and mellow philosopher.

MUSIC: THE SWINGLE SINGERS

Unlike the more vivid funerary masses of Verdi, Berlioz and Mozart, Faure's disdains to summon up distasteful images of apocalyptic violence or hellish horrors.

THE AMBIVALENT AMERICAN BACHELOR

These single men do the heroic deeds that married men cannot.
How could any man be a product of this culture and not be ambivalent about marriage?

ARCHIVES OF BUSINESS: The Toy Industry; Under the Tree, in Christmases Past
LEAD: CHRISTMAS was a lot easier on parents before toys came along.
When children played with wooden spoons or pots, their parents not only didn't have to spend any money but, more important, didn't have to make any choices. (They also didn't have to squirm around under couches and beneath dish washers, days later, rooting for mislaid pieces from the Erector set.) By the late 1800's, the toy business was in full swing.

LEAD: I must say I find all this negativism concerning the advertising business these days quite extraordinary.

Question Of the Week; Is Larry Holmes Too Old To Fight?
LEAD: Larry Holmes, at 38 years of age, is not too old to fight.
Like most older athletes, he can compensate for that lost step, that slower trigger in his reflexes.

However, he is too old - and worse yet, has been inactive too long - to fight a young ogre like Mike Tyson.

THE AMBIVALENT AMERICAN BACHELOR
LEAD: Much was made of the willingness, or lack thereof, of men to commit to marriage.
But to what would they be committing?

SIMON SPIVACK, M.D.
Worcester, Mass.


TV: 'Northanger Abbey,' Austen Satire
LEAD: PUBLIC television's ''Masterpiece Theater'' ventures into predictable territory tonight - on Channel 13 at 9 P.M. - with Jane Austen's ''Northanger Abbey.'' Here, in a one-part, 90-minute adaptation, is still another excuse for a British period piece, exquisitely costumed and expertly acted.
But fans of the series are likely to be perplexed by this particular adaptation.

THE AMBIVALENT AMERICAN BACHELOR
LEAD: I was reading Trip Gabriel's article alone in the kitchen, while my husband (of 29 years) was in the adjacent TV room, watching his sixth hour of football.
I wonder why those bachelors who were interviewed believe they must relinquish their cherished adolescence the moment they say ''I do.'' Any of them in need of reassurance is welcome to spend a Sunday at our house from now until the Super Bowl.


The Stage: 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'
LEAD: WHY mount a stage adaptation of a screen classic that owed its nightmare quality to startling backdrops, ominous lighting and crafty camera angles?
Susan Mosakowski's 50-minute version of ''The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari,'' the 1919 spooker about the malevolent hypnotist and the somnambulist he sends forth from his coffin to murder townsfolk, affords no satisfying explanation.

THE AMBIVALENT AMERICAN BACHELOR
LEAD: The assertion that singles may face greater difficulty and loneliness in later life is more an expression of a fear common to the middle-aged, regardless of marital status, than a reality of old age.
One recent study suggests that singles may, in fact, have an advantage in adjusting to the conditions of aging over those who lose their lifelong mates and are left to develop new personal and social skills on their own.

Question Of the Week; Is Larry Holmes Too Old To Fight?
LEAD: Unfortunately, especially among heavyweights, those who fought one fight too many are numerous.

Lessons for Skiers, Old and New
LEAD: THE advice from seasoned skiers is that lessons are the most important investment skiers can make in their career on the slopes.
Beginners, obviously, need good teaching from trained instructors, but wherever there are ski classes you'll find intermediates and experts trying to smooth out trouble spots, everything from progressing from stem to parallel turns and planting poles correctly to racing.


Opera: 'Fledermaus,' In Old World and New
LEAD: AMERICAN culture bears the burdens of tradition lightly if at all.
It is both our joy and our calamity and a source of constant confusion.
Perhaps it is this kind of rootlessness and free-floating liberty that creates such bewildering events as Friday night's ''Fledermaus'' at the Metropolitan Opera.


Kitty Kennedy Becomes Bride
LEAD: The marriage of Katherine Gertrude Kennedy and Gibbons Gray Cornwell 4th took place yesterday in the Thomas Cochran Chapel on the campus of Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., from which the couple graduated in 1981.

A Proud People Seeks U.S. Respect
LEAD: WHEN visiting Americans tour a Russian factory, farm, school or hospital, they are sure to be politely interrogated about how it stacks up against a comparable facility in the United States.
After this questioning, they may be startled to hear their host declare, contradicting the immediate evidence and the apparent rules of glasnost, ''Yes, we have all that, too.


Rio Rancho's Tangled Legacy
LEAD: IN THE early to mid-70's, residents of New York and other cities were flooded with invitations to free dinners, courtesy of the Amrep Corporation.
Those who went were treated to something else as well: a high-pressure sales pitch about the natural beauty and investment potential of land in Rio Rancho Estates, a sprawling new subdivision that Amrep was developing 15 miles northwest of Albuquerque, N.M.


AT 91 YEARS, HANGING IN FOR THE LONG PULL
LEAD: HISTORY not only repeats itself, but as I head into my 92d year, I am beginning to suffer from acute deja vu.
I have seen Halley's comet twice, lived through two World Wars, and experienced two stock market crashes, one in October 1929, the other October 1987.
The two crashes had much in common.
The advice given by the experts in 1929 is very much like that being given now.

Gershwin: His Music Is in Vogue - Still
LEAD: TO SAY THAT WE ARE IN THE midst of a Gershwin boom is like saying that an American-food fad is in progress: It's not as though ''The Man I Love'' and jambalaya have been out of favor all these years; it's just that the big guns among writers and practitioners are now turning their very conspicuous attention to what always were highly esteemed - and worthy - items.

What the Dollar's Drop Won't Do
LEAD: THESE should be glory days for America's industrial exporters.
Their products bristle with state-of-the-art technology.

THE CONFOUNDING QUEST FOR THE BEST COLLEGE
LEAD: ONE of my daughter's teachers ranks it with a tribal initiation rite, a passageway into adulthood.

A Jazz Label, Complete
LEAD: AMONG THE MOST FAMOUS series of jazz recordings ever made is certainly that overseen by Milt Gabler in the late 1930's and the 40's and 50's, a series that has not lacked for reissues over the years.
Most recently, Book-of-the-Month Records issued a four-LP set (two cassettes or three CD's) and a few years ago CBS issued a clutch of some of the most famous cuts in a series of LP's.


'EVER ET RAW MEAT?' AND OTHER WEIRD QUESTIONS
LEAD: IT seems to me that, in the minds of readers, writers actually exist to serve two purposes, and the more important may not be the writing of books and stories.
The primary function of writers, it seems, is to answer readers' questions.
These fall into three categories.

ART
LEAD: ONE of the paradoxical things about art book publishing is that within a book that is almost too heavy to lift, let alone to carry, a slender pamphlet of exceptional distinction may be hiding.
Equally well, what looks at first sight like a routine enlargement of an exhibition catalogue that dates back to 1976 may turn out to be full of new facts and new insights and in every way an indispensable addition to knowledge.

Here, the planners and the voters, not the real-estate developers, hold the power.

Cable TV
LEAD: No, ''The Color Purple'' which has its cable premiere this week, didn't win a Pulitzer Prize.

THE AMBIVALENT AMERICAN BACHELOR
LEAD: Most of those interviewed seem to be afraid of intimate relationships, with several expressing a fear of being trapped.


The Dance: Pooh Kaye
LEAD: ON the surface, dance by Pooh Kaye often appears anarchistic or even slyly animalistic.
But Ms.
Kaye has the trained eye of an artist and much of her work, though it spills out across the stage with the teeming impulse of life itself, is extremely controlled and self-aware.
And art and artlessness exerted quite a contrary pull in dances performed by Ms.


Old Theater's New Look: Expansion by Excavation
LEAD: If the zoning rules do not permit a taller building, the answer must be to dig deeper for space, and that is what the owners of the old St.
Marks Theater building have done at Second Avenue and St.
Marks Place in Manhattan.


BARE KNUCKLES ON MADISON AVENUE
LEAD: As a former Ted Bates employee, I was interested to read the truth of the whole mess at the agency (''Bare Knuckles on Madison Avenue,'' by Art Kleiner, Nov. 8).
The only people who deserved further mention were those who were not vice presidents or department heads - people who had been with the company 10, 20, even 40 years, and there were many, who had put their lives into Ted Bates Advertising/ New York.


A DAY OUTING, ON A NASTY DAY, INDEED, BECOMES A PIPE DREAM
LEAD: THE dog got sick in the living room.
My husband and son were rushing to catch an early train.
But it was a holiday for me.
I would clean up, I told them, not knowing exactly where to begin. ''Have a good day,'' my son said, averting his glance from the mess. ''You must be kidding!'' I cried. ''Well, have a better day,'' he offered.


IN QUOTES
LEAD: ''It's not responding to good news.

Large Atom Plant Dedicated
LEAD: The largest commercial nuclear power plant in the United States was dedicated Friday by Energy Secretary John S. Herrington.
Construction began in 1976 on the three-unit, 3,810-megawatt plant, and commercial generation began in January 1986.
When the third unit comes on line next year, only the Paluel nuclear power plant in France and a plant near Leningrad in the Soviet Union will be capable of generating more power.

LEAD: The story goes that when Eleanor Blair was about to give birth to her sixth child, her husband dropped her off at the hospital in Cornwall, N.Y., and proceeded to the skating meet where another of their children was competing.


Sacrificing for Team
LEAD: HE scores so many points with such regularity that it's easy to forget that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is a team player.
That was apparent in Milwaukee Friday night when the 40-year-old Los Angeles center accounted for only 7 points in the Lakers' 85-83 loss to the Bucks.
It was the first time in 788 games that Abdul


CRIME
LEAD: And still they come, the 87th Precinct procedurals by Ed McBain, as they have been coming these past 30 years or so.
The latest, his 39th in the series, is TRICKS (Arbor House, $16.95). ''Tricks,'' because the action takes place on Halloween.
And there is plenty of action: a bunch of trick-or-treat kids (or are they kids?) knocking over liquor stores and murdering the owners; a dismembered body; a maniacal sex killer.


FISH, FROM GRAND CENTRAL TO TEXAS COAST
LEAD: ALTHOUGH Texas has a substantial coastline along the Gulf of Mexico, it is not a state that one immediately associates with fish and seafood.
But Ann Clark, owner of a cooking school in Austin, provides considerable sound advice and excellent recipes in her new cookbook, ''Ann Clark's Fabulous Fish'' (New American


If the Turkey Had Been the National Bird
LEAD: To the Editor:


MODERN CONVENIENCES
LEAD: THE MORE EXPENSIVE THE antique, the faster its sale.
Such has been the supply-and-demand rule of home furnishings in recent years.
Indeed, the lust for a set of graceful Regency chairs, a beautifully inlaid cabinet or a breakfront crafted by an 18th-century furniture maker became as much a status symbol as a silver Porsche or a gold-faced Rolex watch.


Practical Traveler; How to Select a Travel Agent
LEAD: YOU would like to have a travel agent help you plan a good vacation.

What are criteria for selection?

As Rock Becomes History, The Past Crowds the Present
LEAD: IN RICHARD STRAUSS'S OPERA ''Die Frau ohne Schatten,'' a mythical emperor turns slowly to stone because his wife can't bear children, a symbol (in Hugo von Hofmannsthal's brilliant, if now rather sexist, libretto) of her inability to love.
Looking at the current state of rock-and-roll, one wonders if something similar isn't happening.


Maine Fight Focuses on School's Role
LEAD: This sleepy town of 975 people on Taunton Bay is embroiled in a bitter dispute over its only elementary school, a four-room white clapboard building that has been the center of social life here for generations.

LEAD: THE city's public schools are in crisis.
The number of dropouts is alarming, but the authorities don't even know what the actual numbers are.


GARDENING
LEAD: THE bad news for those seeking books as gifts for gardeners is that it's not at all hard to find indifferent ones, especially the sleek copycat productions of packagers who overestimate the public's ability to absorb another abundant crop of picture books. (One item this year verges on true atrocity.


Re-Examining a Scholar
LEAD: One of Yale University's brightest lights apparently had some rather dark thoughts as a young man.

Age Is Issue in Dakota Senate Race

Fattoria La Loggia
LEAD: To the Editor: After reading the letters about Fattoria La Loggia, I wish to relate our experience.
We were more fortunate than those who visited in June.

Ms.
Lordan and her fiance graduated last year from Dartmouth College.

Schnabel and Stella: Art, Myth and Ego
LEAD: THE COINCIDENCE THAT LARGE surveys of the art of Frank Stella and Julian Schnabel are taking up a lot of prime exhibition space in New York City at the moment has an air of perfect timing about it.
The exhibitions, Stella's at the Museum of Modern Art, Schnabel's at the Whitney, are both by the enfants terribles of their respective artistic generations, and come toward the end of a tumultuous decade in art.


THREE DECORATIONS TO MAKE
LEAD: Holiday time often brings out creative talents.
With each year, the traditions become more firmly rooted and the family looks forward to to a display of seasonaltrimmings.

Peter Szondi
LEAD: To the Editor:


STAR WARS IS COMING, BUT WHERE IS IT GOING?
LEAD: IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT STAR Wars has become both impossible and inevitable.
The best evidence indicates that, given the current size of the Soviet arsenal of long-range ballistic missiles aimed at the United States, some 10,000 warheads strong, a space-based defense has no chance of working as envisioned by President Reagan.

If the Turkey Had Been the National Bird; Consider the Rattler
LEAD: To the Editor:


From Track to Track in Ireland
LEAD: BY early afternoon, some of the stores on Shop Street, Galway's aptly named main commercial thoroughfare, are starting to close their doors.

Question Of the Week; Is Larry Holmes Too Old To Fight?
LEAD: A great deal of scientific evidence suggests that the normal central nervous system is significantly less functional at 40 than it is at 20.
This dysfunction is perhaps most evident in an area with great implications for a boxer's well being, hand-eye speed and coordination.
Holmes, after an amateur career, 50 professional fights, and countless rounds of sparring, does not possess a normal central nervous system.


THE BIG DIG
LEAD: The underground link between France and England is about to become a reality (Works in Progress: ''The Big Dig,'' Nov. 8).

Dance: 'Nutcracker' Opens Its Annual Run
LEAD: AT least one thing's right with this wicked old world. ''The Nutcracker'' has returned to the New York State Theater.

QUALITY SELLS
LEAD: THE FACT IS, IN SPITE OF ALL THE marketing expertise expended on it, wine drinking is only barely understood as a social phenomenon in this country.

CHOOSING FILES FOR WOOD AND METAL
LEAD: FILES for smoothing and shaping metal and wood are useful and inexpensive additions to any do-it-yourselfer's tool kit.
However, files are categorized by an obscure terminology that can make choosing one perplexing.


COLTS REGAINING THEIR PRIDE
LEAD: THE moment passed quickly more than a month ago, but it remains fresh in Jim Irsay's mind.
A kickoff had not yet taken place, and Eric Dickerson had not yet gained a yard in the name of the Indianapolis Colts.
And yet in the recent, embarrassing era of a once-proud organization, the sight was as significant as the day the moving vans rolled in from


Why the Summit
LEAD: A summit meeting that is more than cosmetic can take place only when each superpower -and its political leader - has a strong interest in seeking accommodation with the other.
That is why Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev are meeting in Washington, and why each can confidently expect to gain something important.


Submarine's Patrol Sets Silent, Random Course
LEAD: ABOARD U.S.S.
HENRY M. JACKSON, in Puget Sound - The sound of the klaxon was grating, but the chief of the watch was crisp: ''Dive, dive.''


Will Trade Follow the Summit Talks?
LEAD: While Soviet-American trade has never been large in volume - it will total only about $2 billion in 1987 - it has been controversial and highly political.
In the early 1970's, during the era of detente, American companies began to move into the Soviet Union in a big way.
In 1971, Mack Truck designed and built a large part of the Soviet Union's $1.4 billion Kama River truck manufacturing plant.

MOVIES
LEAD:  The Tall Men  Starring Clark Gable, Robert Ryan, Jane Russell.
Directed by Raoul Walsh. 1955.
Playhouse Video. 122 minutes. $59.98.
For a tale that pits Clark Gable against Robert Ryan, ''The Tall Men'' makes a mighty mild movie.
The weather is heavier than the plot of this Western, which takes place mostly on a big cattle drive from Texas to Montana - 5,000 head herded by a batch of Mexican hombres from ethnic casting plus a tribe of Sioux to be shot down along the way.


LITERARY FEMINISM COMES OF AGE
LEAD: OUTSIDE THE LEC-ture hall, sunshine falls in dusty beams through the trees.
It is a scene suffused with tradition, a mixture that is two parts dry leaves to one part poetry.

That's one reason the deficit-reduction package that Congress will struggle with this week is a mouse, or worse.


Cubans Give Up in Return for a Long Shot
LEAD: FOR Federal prison officials, it was an unprecedented situation: Inmates rioting not because of overcrowded cells or poor food, but because they did not want to be deported.

LEAD: OVER the last few years, liberals and conservatives have forged a remarkable consensus on the need to help low-income families move from welfare rolls to payrolls, from dependency to productive labor.

For Soviet Jews, Emigration Poses a Divisive Issue
LEAD: It didn't occur to Anatoly Krym, when he was growing up in the western Ukraine in the 1950's and 60's, to dwell on what it meant to be Jewish. ''For me, the question was:


Plugging the Leaks in Your Tax Shelter
LEAD: BEFORE the Tax Reform Act of 1986, many high-bracket investors bought tax shelters.
They could use the losses from these deals to offset earned income, or income from such traditional investments as stocks and bonds.
But the new law imposed tough restrictions on shelters, and did so retroactively.


Hopes Grows for Progress on Long-Range Arms Pact

GIFTS THE MAGI NEVER BROUGHT: A LITERARY QUIZ
LEAD: In everyday life a gift is usually a fairly straightforward thing.

LANDSCAPES SHOW AT U. OF BRIDGEPORT
LEAD: THE mass filling the picture is one of those Southwestern mesas that look like fossilized architecture.
A reproduction of a 1978 black-and-white photograph by Michael Smith, it could be an Abstract Expressionist image, and, in a way, owes its existence to that movement in art. ''Toroweap, Arizona,'' as it's called, is one of the 67 landscapes by 56 photographers that make up ''Views and Visions,'' the present attraction at the Carlson Gallery at the University of Bridgeport.

A Flourishing Of Whirling Dervishes
LEAD: A GLIMPSE of the whirling dervishes of Turkey was virtually obligatory for generations of Western travelers making the Grand Tour of the Orient.

David C. Masket of the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
The couple plan to marry in March.


TRAVEL AND ADVENTURE
LEAD: AT 13, I desperately wanted to be what I then thought was called an adventuress.
It took years to discover the true landscape of that word, with its night-prowling denizens and emotional quicksand.
And further years to understand that I didn't mean adventurer either, but some compound poet-naturalist-explorer whose snares were sentences and whose darts were tipped with the curare of wonder.


WILL SEXY SELL?
LEAD: SPRING 1988 MAY WELL BE ONE of the sexiest seasons in recent times.
Now that the collections for next season have been presented in Milan, Paris and New York, it is clear that most of the design community has become obsessed with promoting overt seductiveness.
In general, skirts are not only short, they are skintight.

FORMS OF FANTASY
LEAD: NANCY GRAVES is rummaging through her things in the makeshift studio she keeps in a corner of the Tallix Foundry in Beacon, N.Y.

Not-So-Great Debates
LEAD: 'Those great debates of the middle and early 1800's, the Clay and Calhoun and Webster debates - some of what they did at least put off the Civil War for another decade, some of what they did opened up the opportunity for new states and new territories to be created. . . .
I have a suspicion that on some of those big and closely fought issues, the debate itself may well have tipped the balance - but you can't tip the balance today if everybody is so heavily positioned before the debate starts that you can't change or modify your position.

VOLCKER ON THE CRASH
LEAD: Attempting to put the ''crash'' in perspective, Paul Volcker states that ''the market went up 30 percent this year and it's gone back down 30 percent, to where it was at the beginning of the year.''

BORIS ARONSON (1900-1980) was an artist who, having chosen set design as his metier, enjoyed the boon of early recognition both in his native Kiev and in New York City.

A Soldier's Plot
LEAD: Corazon C. Aquino, who has had a trying tenure as president of the Philippines, found something to be ''really overjoyed'' about last week.

SHOULD THE METS KEEP MOOKIE WILSON?
LEAD: Of course, the Mets should keep Mookie.
Not only because he's an igniter, a clutch hitter, a class citizen and the Met responsible for The Grounder to Buckner, but, most importantly, because my 3 1/2-year-old son - who frequently calls himself Mookie (his name is Alex) - is too young to learn the harsh realities of the baseball business.


City's Mood Dips From the Celebratory to the Cautionary
LEAD: JUST last spring, New York City was, as its political leaders were delighted to report, wealthy.
It was rolling in money that was going to buy all sorts of things that politicians like to give to the people who elect them: More police officers, more teachers, better schools, cleaner streets.


IT'S TIME FOR TRIMMING
LEAD: BE sure to use approved outdoor wiring when attaching lights to shrubs and trees.
Check coldframe sashes; they should be secure for future windstorms.
The soil of bulbs potted for forcing into bloom after the holidays should be moist, not dry.
Spray anti-desiccants on broadleaved evergreens and young conifers.


WHAT'S NEW IN BUSINESS CELEBRATIONS

Once in Nome, will it be easy to learn when the winner will arrive and get a front-row look? - E. S., New York, N.Y.

Boston's Statue Problem: John Kennedy's Coat Style

Delighting in Katherine Dunham's Sense of Gaity
LEAD: ONE OF THE SEASON'S HIGH-lights is the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater's program in tribute to Katherine Dunham.
What better way to honor this American modern-dance pioneer who introduced so much of the black heritage to the field of concert dance than to restage her choreography?


In the Suburbs: Bringing Back Front Porches, Town Squares
LEAD: The small clapboard house, with its gabled roof and broad front porch, seemed an unlikely place for a discussion about futuristic city planning.
But a group of about 20 architects, developers and planners recently met in Seaside, Fla., in a traditional American-style house on a tree-lined street, at a neighborly intersection, a short walk from a town square, to discuss a vision of future cities modeled after


The Dance: An Evening at Ailey Works at City Center
LEAD: GLITTER, love and pain were the main ingredients in the ''All Ailey Evening'' presented by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater on Friday at City Center.
Mr.
Ailey is an eclectic.
That the evening proved.
But there is a unifying humanity in all his work.
And it was danced here in the penetratingly expressive way that is so distinctive a feature of the Ailey dancers and their repertory.

LEAD: Wagner College established superiority early today and went on to win the Division III football championship by defeating Dayton, 19-3, in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl.


A TRADITIONAL ENGLISH CHRISTMAS FEAST
LEAD: FOR me, Christmas dinner has to be traditional.
That means a serious roast - goose, turkey or suckling pig - and plum pudding brought flaming to the table.
Being British, I am used to dishes that might seem unusual to an American, but they are very much part of our repertoire and date back to long before the Revolution.


THE JUDGE TAKES THE STAND
LEAD:  A VIEW FROM THE BENCH  By Joseph A. Wapner. 249 pp.
New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. $17.95.


WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MARKET?
LEAD: It is curious that when the market experiences a decline, members of the securities industry and the Administration refer to the phenomenon as a ''correction'' (On Language: ''What Happened to the Market?'' by William Safire, Nov. 8).
However, when the market goes up, the term ''correction'' is never applied.

From the Particular to the Sublime
LEAD: THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY rather peculiar about the virtual unanimity with which Anselm Kiefer, now 42, has been accepted in the United States as the most important artist to have emerged from Europe in the last quarter of this century.
Kiefer's work is like nobody else's.
Often daunting in size and undeniably bizarre in its physical structure, it is predicated upon myths and magics, both private and public, that are quite unfamiliar in this country.


Dr. George H. Brown; Led Research at RCA
LEAD: Dr.
George H. Brown, former executive vice president for research and engineering at the RCA Corporation who led the company's development of color television, died Friday at the Princeton (N.J.) Medical Center after a long illness.

Whether the dawn burst of activity is due to climate or just plain vitality, no one has bothered to analyze; it's the

THE PROPER CARE OF CERAMIC TILE
LEAD: CERAMIC tile, used to cover bathroom walls and floors as well as kitchen backsplashes, enjoys a reputation for moisture resistance and durability, not to mention beauty.
It is so hard that it seldom suffers damage from impact.
However, tiles sometimes loosen or develop cracks, and maintenance is necessary to prevent the filler, called grout, between them from deteriorating.


SEDUCED BY THE GLOW OF MEMORY
LEAD: SOME YEARS AGO, AFTER HAVING WRITTEN what must have been an especially effusive review of an Arthur Rubinstein recital, I received a long, remarkably detailed letter of disapproval from a young pianist.
In particular, he wanted to chide me for being so bedazzled by the Rubinstein reputation that I could not recognize what was clearly an ''abominably imprecise, slovenly'' performance of the final movement of Chopin's ''Funeral March'' Sonata.


Leaderless Conservatives Approach '88 in Splinters
LEAD: A WEEK in which the hammer and sickle was flying in front of the White House is not a bad time to contemplate the dismay and disarray that grips much of the American conservative movement.
Leaving aside the arms-control agreement with the Soviet Union - and for many conservatives that's bad enough - the movement is in a decidedly bad humor.


Three Sisters and a Death in the 80's

Directed by Robert Altman. 1986.
New World Video. 93 minutes. $69.95.
This surreal romance is strictly for Robert Altman addicts.
Christopher Durang's play has been Altmanized, which is to say that characters have been transported to the director's alternative universe, making ''Beyond Therapy'' a disorienting experience indeed.


Bush, Fresh From the Summit, Tackles Iowa

A SELLER'S MARKET FOR STORE HELP
LEAD: WHAT is worrying retailers this Christmas season is not so much the number of buyers.

And they are going to great lengths in their pursuit of peace of mind.


The Bosporus
LEAD: To the Editor: Alan Cowell's account of his trip to the Bosporus via zig-zag ferry (Travel, Nov. 8) stirs pleasant memories.

That article directed us to Pier 1 near the Galata Bridge in Istanbul as the launch site.

MUSIC IN CELEBRATION OF CHRISTMAS
LEAD: CONNECTICUT'S abiding love of music is never more evident than during the Christmas holiday, when the largest of concert halls and the smallest of churches put forth their best efforts.


East Berlin
LEAD: To the Editor: I thought that the article on the Weissensee cemetery gave an excellent description of the cemetery and the history surrounding it.
I have been fortunate enough to visit Berlin twice and stay with close friends who live there.
I have also toured extensively in East Germany.
On my most recent visit to East Berlin, I was taken to the Weissensee cemetery one Sunday afternoon.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  MAMA, by Terry McMillan. (Washington Square Press/ Pocket Books, $5.95.)

Cleveland State Can't Stop F.D.U.
LEAD: Last basketball season should have been a great one for Cleveland State.
And when it wasn't - because of the death of one player and injuries to some others - this one was supposed to be.
But it won't.


In and Out of Storyville: Jazz and Fiction
LEAD: ONE morning in New Orleans I went to a jazz funeral.

The Gorbachev Effect: Charming, Very Tough

Sylvia Plath
LEAD: To the Editor:


Correction

Bargains in Closed-End Funds
LEAD: THIS year has brought another deluge of stock offerings in new closed-end investment funds; a total of 34 issues raised about $9 billion, according to one estimate.
But even before the plunge in stock prices in October, investors in many of the equity-oriented funds shared a common experience: They were a bit poorer for having bought at the initial offerings.


ABOUT ALARM SYSTEMS AND THE REAL WORLD
LEAD: I could not read ''Closed Windows, Good Neighbors''  [ Nov. 22 ]  without being grateful that I am not one of Sara Jasper Cook's next-door neighbors.
Does she think that the people who have alarm systems are any happier about them than she is?
We, too, have to listen to them when they go off, have to worry that someone may be breaking into our homes, and feel like we live in a cage.


March Wedding For Ms. Bushkin

ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD: Q. I am having a problem removing nonskid bathtub decals I put down five years ago.
I had taken up the old ones and put new ones in their place without ever getting all the old adhesive off.
Now I would like to remove these decals and the sticky residue left.
I have tried benzine, nail-polish remover and Spray 'N' Wash (which was recommended by the manufacturer of these decals), but I have only been able to remove the top layer, not the adhesive.


CANADIAN FIREBRAND: Mel Hurtig; A Publisher Stirs Passions Against the Trade Pact

LEAD: Harvard University says its endowment dropped 7.2 percent, to $3.85 billion, in October as a result of the stock market collapse, far less than the 21.6 percent drop in the market over all.


A CHRISTMAS FEAST
LEAD: MANY OF US, WHEN WE THINK of Christmas feasting, envision Mrs.
Cratchit's menu in ''A Christmas Carol'': roast goose, gravy, sage-and-onion stuffing, applesauce, mashed potatoes, a pudding ''blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.'' Even if we've never roasted a goose or steamed a pudding, just mention the word Christmas and visions of


CARS IN MY DESPERATION DERBY
LEAD: CARS, not clothes, make the man nowadays, or so I'm told.

Martin Luther King Jr.'s primary legacy -his contribution to the reshaping of a society - is in the public domain.

Last week, Dr.

Disks Marked By Style

LEAD: ONE would almost think that America's moralizing politics had beached up on France's worldly shores.
The fall season had been taken up with a scrappy tennis match in which the right served up a financial or personal scandal at the left only to have the left slam one back; the right won in, let's say, three sets.


Holding Conferences Closer to Home
LEAD: THE meetings industry records revenues of about $40 billion yearly, the principal beneficiaries being hotels and airlines, according to Mr.
Hosansky of Successful Meetings magazine.


Opera: 'The Mikado' By Village Group
LEAD: WHEN Gilbert and Sullivan wrote ''The Mikado,'' the English-speaking world's superficial understanding of Japan came largely from exhibitions like the quaint and pretty one underway at Knightsbridge in 1885.
Our superficial understandings today are likelier to center on businesslike, technological Tokyo -where Peter Sellars set his ''Mikado'' production a few years ago - or perhaps on the look and sound of Kabuki theater, which were imported into the operetta by the Village Light Opera Group in its current production at the Fashion Institute


Bookshelf
LEAD: Additional titles of interest:


NEW JERSEY GUIDE
LEAD:  THE 'TROCKS' AT THE 'Y'


'SOMEONE HAD TO LOSE'
LEAD: LAST month, for the first time in my life, I ran for public office.


Chile Opposition Struggles to Gain TV Time
LEAD: During a recent swing through Chile's desert north, President Augusto Pinochet strongly criticized a prominent Socialist politician and equated him with the President of Nicaragua.


A TRADITIONAL ENGLISH CRISTMAS FEAST
LEAD: FOR me, Christmas dinner has to be traditional.
That means a serious roast - goose, turkey or suckling pig - and plum pudding brought flaming to the table.
Being British, I am used to dishes that might seem unusual to an American, but they are very much part of our repertoire and date back to long before the Revolution.


THE BOSS WAS A HUSTLER OR, HOW I GOT MY BIBLE
LEAD: IN the fall of 1937, I got my first job in New York - a rather odd one, and not at all what I had expected when I started looking.
Life magazine, which had begun publication under the auspices of Time Inc. the year before, was expanding its staff, and I had heard that the chances of editorial employment for a young man with my background were pretty good.


Troy State Reclaims Division II Crown
LEAD: Mike Turk ran for two touchdowns, including a 51-yarder with 1 minute 43 seconds remaining, as Troy State defeated Portland State, 31-17, today to win its second National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II championship in the last four years.

But Tougher Issues Await a New Round
LEAD: IN all of the long and turbulent history of Soviet-American relations, through 17 summit conferences and countless agreements, through blow-ups in Paris and Reykjavik and calmer days in Yalta and Glassboro, there has never been a week quite like the one when Mikhail S. Gorbachev came calling on Ronald Reagan in Washington.


PAYCHECKS BEFORE ART

Baseball Notebook; In Orosco Deal, A's Alderson Was Relay Man in Triple Play
LEAD: IN baseball's version of shuttle diplomacy, Sandy Alderson, the Oakland Athletics' vice president for baseball operations, led his entourage to the 19th floor of the Tower at the Loews Anatole Hotel in Dallas at 11 o'clock Thursday night.
Armed with a tentative agreement on a trade with the Los Angeles Dodgers, they had a meeting with their counterparts with the Mets.


POSTINGS: Inwood Rehab; 90 New Condos
LEAD: A condominium apartment building that is the product of a gut rehabilitation is strange enough in the Inwood section of northern Manhattan, where co-ops, rentals and less dramatic renovations are more common.
But Academy Twins, with an exercise room, exposed-brick hallways and skylights, is different for another reason.


Art
LEAD: Outside the mainstream, contemporary art sometimes seems to be turning into a menagerie.
So many animals have been invented, depicted and unleashed in painting that they almost seem to be taking over.
This need for nature is something of a reaction against the amount of theory in art now.
Animals also make it possible for artists to express an affection for living creatures in a way that the human figure, as problematical as it has been in 20th-century art, does not.


Deborah A. Norville Weds Karl G. Wellner
LEAD: At St.
James's Episcopal Church in New York, Deborah Anne Norville, a daughter of Zachary Samuel Norville of Dalton, Ga., and the late Merle Olson Norville, was married yesterday to Karl Gert Wellner, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Gert Wellner of Stockholm.
The Rev.
J.
Seymour Flinn, the senior associate rector of the church, and the Rev.


Two Artists, One Goal
LEAD: MODERN DANCE HAS been called an art of rugged individualism, and modern-dance choreographers usually go their own creative ways.
In contrast, Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis are two choreographers who for 38 years have worked in harmony together, even though each directs a company with its own esthetic personality: Mr.


MOVIES
LEAD:  Anchors Aweigh  Starring Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Dean Stockwell. 1945.
MGM/UA Home Video. 146 minutes. $29.95.
In ''Anchors Aweigh,'' Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra play two sailors on the loose in Los Angeles.
The breezy duo, who are searching, of course, for a good-looking dame, find instead a precocious lad who wants to join the Navy.


Why Choke Japanese Auto Imports?
LEAD: Curbs on imports of Japanese cars were supposed to be temporary.
Now almost seven years old, their cost to consumers has been staggering and the benefit to American car makers only marginal.
Even so, Detroit has come up with a laughable new argument to make the ceiling lower still.


SHOULD THE METS KEEP MOOKIE WILSON?
LEAD: Yes, the Mets should keep Mookie Wilson.
We fans are asked to be loyal to teams even though management charges a lot for a game, sells expensive concessions, builds ever bigger impersonal stadiums and bombards us with clacky music and commercials.
Then, on top of that, the owners blithely trade players we enjoy - Hubie Brooks, Kevin Mitchell, Jeff Reardon, Ray Knight, Jesse Orosco, Rafael Santana.


ILLUSTRATED BOOKS FOR CHRISTMAS: GIVE THE BIG PICTURE
LEAD:  DANCE AND PHOTOGRAPHY.
By William A. Ewing. (Holt, $50.) William Ewing's primary interest in photographs of dance lies neither in performance preservation nor in star adulation but in something more profound: the craft, sensuality and intelligence framed within each individual image.
The author presents more than 200 full-page exquisitely reproduced images by such artists as Brassai, Genthe, Steichen, Man Ray, Degas, Nadar and Walker Evans, all of them connected by the subject of dance - primitive, avant-garde, spontaneous, classical.

NEW TUNIS CHIEF BEGINS DEMOCRATIC CHANGES
LEAD: Soon after the new Government was installed a month ago, the theology school at the University of Tunisia reclaimed its old Islamic name, Zitouna.


Of Candidates, Conversations and Chimes
LEAD: IS ANYBODY WATCHING, AND IF SO, who cares?
David Brinkley wondered about it last Sunday on ABC.
It's possible, he said, ''there are too many debates - maybe they're becoming a bore.'' Mr.
Brinkley didn't specify, but he perhaps had in mind the two-hour, 12-candidate extravaganza on NBC a few nights before.


New York City Will Restore Parts of Old Insane Asylum
LEAD: New York City has received a grant of $200,000 for a historic preservation project to restore parts of its first insane asylum, opened in 1839 on what is now Roosevelt Island.


'COMMUNIST NO. 1' IS HAILED AT HOME
LEAD: Vladimir Dunayev, the Washington correspondent for Soviet television, was so taken by the strong impression that Mikhail S. Gorbachev made on many Americans in Washington this week that tonight he violated the unspoken etiquette of reporting on Soviet leaders.
He gushed.


Bo Jackson: Baseball in the Long Run
LEAD: HIS instant success as a professional football player, Bo Jackson says, has heightened his determination to excel at baseball.
Motivated by a challenge that he says he doesn't feel so intensely in football, he prefers to make baseball his long-term career.


Seeing San Francisco By the Scenic Route
LEAD: One of the most beautiful drives in California is inside city limits: San Francisco's 49-Mile Scenic Drive.
Yet driving in San Francisco is something many visitors cheerfully forgo, having seen automobiles come to bad ends in movies made there.
Using reasonable caution, however, even wary flat landers should enjoy carefully planned excursions on the 49-Mile


A TRADITIONAL ENGLISH CHRISTMAS FEAST
LEAD: FOR me, Christmas dinner has to be traditional.
That means a serious roast - goose, turkey or suckling pig - and plum pudding brought flaming to the table.
Being British, I am used to dishes that might seem unusual to an American, but they are very much part of our repertoire and date back to long before the Revolution.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  N.B.A.
Nuggets 131, 76ers 121: Jay Vincent scored a season-high 33 points as the Denver Nuggets built a 19-point lead and then held off the 76ers yesterday in Philadelphia.
After trailing by 87-68 early in the third quarter, the 76ers closed the deficit to 120-116 with 2 minutes 9 seconds to play when Gerald Henderson tapped in a missed free throw.


WHERE TO FIND THE ICE FOR SKATING
LEAD: WHEN atmospheric moisture and temperature are just right, a hoarfrost rises like a ghost over the Ebersole Ice Rink in White Plains.
Somehow during this darkest time of the year, this is a warming sight for those who thrive on Arctic cold and boreal sports.

LEAD: Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court says the Justice Department has been so politicized that it is trying ''to undermine the Supreme Court itself.''


Commercial Property: Labeling Buildings; A Name Can Build an Image - or Scare Off Tenants
LEAD: IN 1925 the Postum Cereal Company moved into an office building on Park Avenue bearing its name.
A year later Farmer's Loan and Trust followed suit on Fifth Avenue.
Today one name has become a piece of nostalgia to market aggressively; the other, a burden to shake off.





Battling the Doldrums in Condo Sales
LEAD: CONDOMINIUM developers are turning to clearance sales, low down payments and other marketing techniques to help sell an overload of new condominium apartments in Manhattan.
But sales activity has grown sluggish as the financial trauma on Wall Street intensifies a traditional winter downturn.


Music
LEAD: Only part of Handel's ''Messiah'' is really suited to Advent, but that is when we do it in this country, and at least five varieties are available this week.
My recommendation is a choice between two Baroque-oriented groups.
The elegant ''Music Before 1800'' series at Corpus Christi Church on 121st Street is presenting the Amor Artis Chamber Choir and Baroque Ensemble Sunday at 4 P.M.


John L. Hill Weds Mary McC. Truitt

GURNEY'S 'CHILDREN,' AN UPPER-CLASS DRAMA
LEAD: NO more urgent appeal for the continuation of the financially desperate Long Island Stage Company could be made than its current production of A. R. Gurney Jr.'s ''Children.'' Mr.

No Simple Answers For Victims of Poverty
LEAD: New York is a city of contrasts - home to the very rich and to the very poor.
A city of bright lights and dark corners.
New York is home to corporate giants and home to the unemployed.
For every success story, we hear another story of disaster.


'Knowledge Is a Good Thing'
LEAD: Self-confident and charming.
Defensive and truculent.
The Mikhail Gorbachev we saw was both those men.


Zoning Dispute Extends Olympia's Run
LEAD: AFTER struggling 21 months to obtain a special zoning district, the developers of an apartment building planned on the site of the Olympia Theater on Broadway at West 107th Street say it may still be years before construction begins because a Toronto movie-theater chain has a long-term lease on the theater.


OF JAMS AND A FAMILY
LEAD: With a name like Smucker's, it helps to be male, or so it would seem from Andrew H. Malcolm's article ''Of Jams and a Family'' (Nov. 15). ''Smucker boys absorb the jam business from childhood,'' according to your report.
Apparently, Smucker's perpetuates the myth in American business that men are better suited than women for leadership positions.


Civil Liberties Group in Jersey Aids Bands, and Their Critics
LEAD: Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union rallied behind the British.
Now it is taking up the cause of the Irish.


Trying to Build a Bigger Blimpie

LEAD: 'There is no doubt in my mind that, should we have been choosing our leaders on the basis of their reading experience and not their political programs, there would be much less grief on earth.'


Mexico
LEAD: To the Editor: I recently returned from my first and most certainly my only trip to Mexico.
While several guidebooks that I purchased before the trip implored me to make sure my car was safeguarded regularly and that bribery of officials is a virtual way of life, I felt that my trip would be restful and enjoyable and that those statements could not apply to a resort town like Puerto Vallarta.


New Australian Dining Treat: Fresh Salmon From Tasmania
LEAD: UNTIL the last decade or so, a hefty slab of meat - at lunch, sometimes at breakfast and almost always at dinner - was the staple of the Australian diet.
A meat pie, oozing with tomato sauce, was the closest thing to a national dish.
Even cafes selling fish and chips still boast signs saying, ''Fish and grills,'' as if to say that fish is too light for the hearty


TRANQUIL TIMELESSNESS OF THE PARK
LEAD: THE park has been our refuge for the last three seasons.
From the earliest days of tolerable spring through the warm autumn, my son and I have visited our sanctuary religiously.

Would this Englishman have taken so happily to baseball if Mookie hadn't been there?


THREE-GENERATION PERSPECTIVE OF HUNTING AND KILLING
LEAD: BIG HERB, my father, never lost the thrill of killing.
For him, there was no greater excitement than to be among a covey of quail, on an autumn morning, and to bring down one of their thundering forms with each barrel of his double-barreled Winchester.
Or to stand in a blind at sunset, as the mallards lanced in from the exposed waters of the lake, and send one of their speeding bodies plunging into the marsh.


The Mutual Admiration Of Fashion And Surrealism Over the Years
LEAD: IF YOU ARE PLANNING to eat your hat, the place to go to put yourself in the right mood is the Fashion Institute of Technology at Seventh Avenue and 21st Street.
There, in the exhibition gallery, you will find a hat that looks like a serving of French fries and a hat that looks like a strawberry tart; indeed, a whole array of culinary millinery, spread out like a banquet -headgear got up to resemble a salad, a


Sara E. Weiner Weds John Verneuille on L.I.

A MODERN SCROOGE: 'EBENEZER!'

LIFE AT THE TOP FOR ONE PLAID SUIT
LEAD: WHEN the First Lady wore a brown-and-beige plaid Oscar de la Renta suit Wednesday for her White House tour with Raisa Gorbachev, a lot of well-dressed women must have smiled knowingly.
That's because they own the very same suit.
Mr. de la Renta sold 499 of them, and would undoubtedly have made more had he not run out of the stylish Prince of


Wife of Spy Hospitalized
LEAD: Anne Henderson Pollard, serving a five-year term for pleading guilty to charges related to the sale of state secrets to Israel by her husband, Jonathan Jay Pollard, was transferred Friday from a prison hospital in Kentucky to one affiliated with the Mayo Clinic for treatment of a digestive disorder, Government officials and family members said.

BIG MAN IN THE KITCHEN
LEAD: EVEN IN HIS APRON, Charles Palmer looks like a fullback.
The 28-year-old chef is 6 feet 3 inches, 236 pounds, and is clearly more than a match for the sea bass on the cutting board in front of him.
Palmer runs a meaty left forefinger along the scales, then, with a few strokes of the knife in his right hand, bones the fish and splits it into two fillets.


Navy Helps In Rescue of Crew From Ship Attacked in the Persian Gulf

SHOULD THE METS KEEP MOOKIE WILSON?
LEAD: Mookie's batting and fielding are excellent, and his mere presence offers continuity in a business where managements change players as often as most people change shirts.


THE JARGON OF CAMCORDERS
LEAD: VIDEO camera/recorders, known as camcorders, are the latest fad on upscale gift lists this season.
At around $1,000, camcorders are not exactly bought on a whim, but they are arousing the interest of the same sort of folks who once invested in 8-millimeter movies.


A BACHELOR NEIGHBORHOOD
LEAD: In his article ''A Neighborhood'' (About Men, Nov. 8), George Pollock proudly relates that he is ''chief cook, cleaner and handyman - as well as interior decorator, gardener, washerwoman, shopper (complete with coupons) and bill-payer.'' Evidently, these are roles that his former wife played when she wasn't managing his social life and providing the ''womanly restraints'' that prevented him from ''reverting to the wild state.

ABOUT BOOKS
LEAD: IF IT were not for progress and all it demolishes, many a collection of nostalgia would not be on the bookshelves today.


In the Cities: Replacing the Downtown Mall With Traffic
LEAD: IN the early 1970's, officials in this Chicago suburb closed their two main shopping streets to traffic, planted trees and grass and flowers where there had been concrete, and turned the whole area into a landscaped pedestrian mall.
The hope was to revitalize a fading downtown, and lure back shoppers and retailers from those other malls, the large regional shopping centers that had stolen them away.


The Fawning After
LEAD: Here is the central fact of the recent summit meeting: Mikhail Gorbachev spent only 330 minutes in so-called working sessions with Mr.
Reagan (including lunch) but spent 420 minutes in hard-selling the new Soviet line to awe-struck celebrities, ga-ga politicians and businessmen, tongue-tied media executives and a frustrated press corps.

A HOLLOW RING TO ROTHSTEIN'S DEFENSE
LEAD: Polly Rothstein's defense of the tactics that she and the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion used against me in the recent election for County Legislature have a hollow ring to them.

NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  From Grunt to Grammar  The birth of language may have been the best part of it.

BOOKS FOR THE COLLECTOR AND THE MAKER
LEAD: SEVERAL recent books relevant to craft and culture are available as holiday gifts for artists and collectors.


Aretha Franklin Reaches For Gospel's Higher Ground
LEAD: WITH HER SOARING VOICE and sometimes fiery abandon, Aretha Franklin has had a long, variable but frequently incandescent career.
She's been a queen of soul, she's sung jazz and the blues, but the basis of her style has been gospel music.
Her ''Amazing Grace'' double album of 1972 (now on a double CD set, Atlantic 2-906-2) counts among her finest achievements.

Q AND A
LEAD:  Two Into One


THE GENOME PROJECT
LEAD: IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST, costliest, most provocative biomedical research project in history, and the United States must embark on it immediately.

COOL STORIES, INFLAMED POETS
LEAD: A TRULY capitalist country is one that can afford not one but several annual collections of ''best'' short stories.

LEAD: HAVING heard the St.
Cecilia Chorus and Orchestra's performance of Honegger's ''King David'' on Friday evening at Carnegie Hall, it is not difficult to understand why the work was greeted so favorably at its premiere in 1921.

They Can Make History

LEAD: THE 20th CENTURY HAS RECEIVED the gift of Liszt's piano music with puzzlement.

Divining the Legacy of Jackson Pollock
LEAD: NOW, AS MUCH AS EVER, PEOPLE cannot stop talking about Jackson Pollock.
He and Abstract Expressionism, for which he is a symbol, remain so vivid that he seems to be still alive, still dancing over his canvas, still trying to lead art to places it has never been.

For years, when the Mets were at their most dismal, two things stood out at Shea stadium: the grass and the zeal with which Mookie Wilson played.
And nothing bonded Mets fans, total strangers only moments before, more than yelling ''Mooooooooooo-kie!

A tight schedule necessitated a change that would put the ship into the troughs of 30-foot waves.


A CONFERENCE CENTER TURNS AROUND
LEAD: LAST December, two executives, Wesley A. LaBay and Jeffrey V. Farina, left good jobs to buy a conference center in Ossining.
Their acquisition, the Hudson River Inn and Conference Center, was a property that had consistently lost money for 20 years, under a succession of experienced owners.

Sunday Observer; Dangerous To the Last Drop
LEAD: THE HOUSE IN which we live sits under a coffee-bean tree.

LEAD: THE wonderful new computer system was supposed to be up and running in June.

But if you look up you can still make out the letters ''BPOE'' on the 1911 ''Mother Lodge'' of the Elks, at 108 West 43d Street.
Now the Hotel Diplomat, the building sits on one of the largest assemblages in midtown, and a recent court ruling has removed the last legal obstacle to its demolition.

A CAREER COLORED IN SUCCESS

Hip Graphics
LEAD: THE COMPUTER-GENERATED images above represent a human hip.
Reading left to right, two rows at a time (the white images illustrate bone structure; the surrounding musculature is in red), the hip appears to be rotating on a vertical axis.

Temples and Tortillas On a Mexican Tour

Unfortunately, you are not going to find this out (and even if you are warned, you won't really believe it) until you are standing on top of one.
So there we were at Chichen Itza, and Larry was up on top of the biggest pyramid, and Perri was down at the bottom reading to Benjamin from a favorite book, ''The Cow Who Fell in the Canal,'' and after she had read it through for the seventh time she realized that Larry was not down yet.

Mura Dehn, Dancer, As Subject and Chronicler
FOR many dancegoers, Mura Dehn is known, a little vaguely, as a woman who had something to do with film and black dancers.
But the Film Forum is doing something about that, with a double feature consisting of ''In a Jazz Way,'' a short film on Miss Dehn by Louise Ghertler and Pamela Katz, and a two-hour excerpt from ''The Spirit Moves: A History of Black Social Dance on Film,'' a documentary by Miss Dehn.
The program opens today for a two-week run at Film Forum 1.
''In a Jazz Way,'' shot in 1985, offers a tantalizing look at Miss Dehn.
It has the look of a documentary that originally had more ambitious things on its mind, but Miss Ghertler and Miss Katz do give us an undiluted dose of Miss Dehn, who died in February.

After long years in the kitchen it's hard to resist a little easy money and fame, even if it does tend to look commercial.

Nasty Choices on Nicaragua
LEAD: These are not easy times for those conscientiously seeking a responsible policy on Nicaragua.
How can Congress send more guns to the contra rebels?
That would flagrantly violate the new Central American peace plan, which forbids all foreign aid to insurgents.
Then why not cut off all contra aid?
To do that, before the Sandinistas have complied with the plan, would remove the one pressure point that seems to burden President Daniel


Rock Radio Station Fades Out on L.I.

LEAD: Apple Computer Inc. said it expected record revenues and earnings for its first fiscal quarter, which ends Jan. 1.

Troubadours Carry Forth A Tradition
LEAD: THE troubadour, a wandering poet-musician, has long been a figure swathed in mystery and romance, and not only in Europe.

Mr. Deaver's Arm, Mr. Reagan's Thumb
LEAD: What President Reagan once said in defense of his former deputy chief of staff wholly missed the point.
Michael Deaver, he said, ''never put the arm on me, or sought anything or any influence from me since he has been out of government.'' What Mr.
Deaver did, with unseemly haste after leaving the White House in 1985, was to put the arm on the rest of the Reagan

LEAD: To the Editor:


Hart Misses the Point
LEAD: There is a common thread connecting many strong people who decide to seek psychiatric counsel.
It is the realization that they are acting repeatedly in a way harmful to them, without knowing quite why.

Gamble Awaits Draft
LEAD: In the early years of the National Football League draft, the scouting was rudimentary and the selections often haphazard.

That's a nice-sounding name.'' So Halas drafted Fortmann, who became a Hall of

On Stage
LEAD: 'The Gospel' on Broadway After three and a half years of speculation as to whether it would or it wouldn't ever get to Broadway, the answer is in.

'Eddie Murphy Raw'
At the Embassy 3, where ''Eddie Murphy Raw'' opened yesterday, even the ushers were laughing.
And they, like everyone else in the place, had good reasons not to.
The profanity is persistent, parts of Mr.
Murphy's act are filthier than anything Richard Pryor ever attempted (like his adolescent impression of Mr. Pryor doing bathroom jokes), and when it comes to women and homosexuals, Mr.
Murphy is clearly proud of his prejudices.
Nonetheless, this feature-length concert film is hilarious, putting Mr.
Murphy on a par with Mr.
Pryor at his best.
The generation between the two is readily apparent, both in the routine that has Mr.
Murphy mimicking his idol and in his long, scathing anecdote about a telephone call from Bill Cosby, who complained about the obscenity of Mr.
Murphy's show.
First of all, Mr.
Murphy is a terrific parodist, doing a lethal Cosby imitation complete with long pauses and sententious phrasings.
Second, he caps this brilliantly by reporting his own subsequent call to Mr.
Pryor, who said he himself had receivd a similar dressing down.
Do people like you?
Mr.
Pryor asked.
Do you get paid? ''Well, tell Bill I said have a Coke and a smile and shut up.''

A Crazy Way to Govern America
LEAD: Congress is about to send the President one gigantic, take-it-or-leave-it appropriations bill for fiscal 1988.

ON STEREOTYPES AND WOMEN ARTISTS
LEAD: To the Editor:


A FEAR OF LAWYERS
LEAD: Opinion polls consistently show that Americans not only fear, but despise lawyers -ranking them with used-car salesmen and politicians.
We don't trust lawyers because they have destroyed the nation's sense of right and wrong.
Most Americans are convinced that our courts do not find in favor of the innocent party, but of the better lawyer.


Europe Considers How to Take Up Arms
LEAD: THIS is a watershed moment of promise and peril in a Europe that for four decades has been the most heavily armed corner of this planet and, paradoxically, the most peaceful, too.


IT'S CATALOGUE TIME
LEAD: FILL large pine cones with a mixture of peanut butter and bird seed or use melted suet to hang on trees for the birds' Merry Christmas; fasten cones securely to ends of smaller limbs to discourage heavy squirrels.

'RAMBO' ATTACKS THE SLALOM
LEAD: EVEN before the skier propels himself from the chute, the excitement runs through the crowd.

NEW HAITIAN LAW WILL LET OFFICIALS VIEW ALL BALLOTS
LEAD: The military-dominated Government today published a new election law that bars independent observers but not soldiers from polling stations, and lets the authorities examine every voter's ballot.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  IN LA-LA LAND WE TRUST, by Robert Campbell. (Mysterious Press, $3.95.) La-La Land is Los Angeles, where the discovery of a headless corpse helps a private investigator named Whistler uncover a pornography ring run by a seemingly respectable businessman with a voyeuristic taste for murder.

Its 60 works also provide a mini-survey of Chinese painting from the 12th through the 19th centuries.


JESSE JACKSON AIMS FOR THE MAINSTREAM
LEAD: Jesse Jackson may ''aim for the mainstream,'' but he remains a divisive force in American life, in spite of all his new appeals and continued efforts to paint himself as a ''rainbow'' man.
His being a preacher makes me as uncomfortable with his candidacy as I am with Pat Robertson's.
Their respective backgrounds and activities as adults were both partisan and religiously oriented, and I question whether such personalities would serve the country's best interests.


A TREE FOR REMEMBRANCE
LEAD: EITHER way you look at it, a Christmas tree is an expense.
If a cut tree is chosen and trimmed with colorful trinkets and lights, its days of glory are brief.
All too soon, the tree is tossed on a trash heap to be carted away or cut up to protect a perennial border from spring frosts.


Missiles in Treaty Have More Psychological Than Military Value

Where Simple Miracles Abound
LEAD:  SELECTED SHORT STORIES  By Alexander Grin.
Translated by Nicholas Luker. 184 pp.
Ann Arbor, Mich.: Ardis Publishers. $22.


ARTICLE'S 'ESTHER' WAS REALLY 'RUTH'
LEAD: It came as a shock to read (''Tradition Inspires Illuminator,'' Dec. 6) that Queen Esther, heroine of the Purim story, was ''the only non-Jew revered in Hebraic history.'' If Esther (a descendant of King Saul) is not Jewish, the whole point of the story is lost: She is willing to lay her life on the line by revealing her religion to her husband to save her people.


PANEL BACKS PAY INCREASE
LEAD: PAY raises for the state's top elected officials - including a 35 percent increase for the governor and an 80 percent increase for the treasurer - have been unanimously recommended by a state commission.


In a Cautious Taste of Freedom, Korea Elects Government Candidate
LEAD: ALTHOUGH on the surface it might not seem like it, South Koreans voted for change in last week's presidential election.
True, it was the Government candidate, Roh Tae Woo, who won.
But nearly two-thirds of the 23 million voters supported rival opposition contenders, stark testimony to the unpopularity of the present


Dance: Japanese Legend, 'Himiko,' by Tomonaga
LEAD: AKIMITSU TOMONAGA had a good idea in ''Himiko: A Legendary Fantasy From Japan,'' which was presented on Friday at the Kampo Cultural Center, 31 Bond Street.
The hourlong spectacle told, through a blend of classical and modern techniques, the story of the shamanic Queen Himiko, who unified the Yamatai kingdom of ancient Japan.


Well-Placed Friends and, Eventually, Loose Money
LEAD: THERE is the stuff of high melodrama in the case of Michael Keith Deaver, whose trial ended last Wednesday with a jury verdict of guilty on three of five charges of perjury.


Recital: Ilan Rechtman, Pianist, in Debut at Y
LEAD: ILAN RECHTMAN is a 24-year-old Israeli-born pianist and composer whose New York debut on Thursday evening at the 92d Street Y left one feeling more positive about his playing as the evening progressed.
His recital began with a version of Bach's G-major Partita that included moments of inventive playing - the slow opening to the minuet, for instance, and a buoyant gigue - but that failed to sustain interest over more than short stretches.


THE WORLD: The Slide Steepens; Peru and Mexico Try Devaluation
LEAD: MONEY suddenly was worth substantially less in several parts of the Western Hemisphere last week.
Mexico devalued its currency by 18 percent on Monday.
The same day, Peru went even further, slicing nearly 40 percent from the value of its currency.

ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER SUPERSTAR
LEAD: FAME MAY INEVITABLY breed controversy, but the arguments swirling around Andrew Lloyd Webber - who has composed more hit musicals than anyone else in this decade, and whose ''Phantom of the Opera,'' due next month on Broadway, looks to be his best and biggest hit of all - are especially virulent.


BOTTLE CRUSHER IS A HIT WITH TAVERN OWNERS

Where Blurred Focus Makes Sharp Statements
LEAD: TEN YEARS AGO, PHOTOGRAPHS made to be seen as art were for the most part sharp, clear and descriptive.
While not everyone subscribed to the Modernist notion that it is the nature of the medium to describe the world in exacting detail, most photographers would have agreed that photography's advantage over painting rested with its verisimilitude.


MY SIX YEARS ON THE COUCH
LEAD: DR.
ERNEST LIT ANOTHER cigarette, tilted his head back and blew a stream of smoke toward the ceiling.
He said he thought I was among those few people who could benefit from psychoanalysis.
I took it as a compliment.


In Nicaragua, Economy Is Hobbling Sandinistas
LEAD: By traditional measures, 1987 is the year the Nicaraguan economy essentially collapsed.
And if fundamental changes do not occur, 1988 will see the national currency become worthless, according to diplomats, local economists and trade union leaders.


SHOCK THERAPY
LEAD: Susan Squire deserves congratulations for her clear article on electroconvulsive therapy (''Shock Therapy's Return to Respectability,'' Nov. 22).

JUST A BANK'S CHRISTMAS CARD; COULD IT REALLY MEAN MUCH?
LEAD: PRESIDENT of the Farmingdale National Bank and the Mayor of that rural Monmouth County town for 40 years, E.O.
Murphy handled mortgage closings personally.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: THE NEWSPAPER OF CLAREMONT STREET.
By Elizabeth Jolley. (Viking, $14.95.) In this small, richly peculiar novel, Elizabeth Jolley writes about money the way others write about love - lyrically, longingly, sensually.
Money is the obsession of Margarite Morris, known as ''the Newspaper of Claremont Street'' or ''Weekly'' because of the petty gossip she picks up and passes along on her rounds cleaning houses in a small Australian town.


PEACE PANEL PROPOSED IN NEW HAVEN

Hann, 41 years old, of Warfordsburg, Pa., on probation Wednesday and ordered that she be given medical treatment.


Our Deaver Lessons
LEAD: I was rooting for Mike Deaver to beat the perjury rap.
Not because I approve of the way he threw his weight around in the Reagan White House, manipulated the press, dispensed nest-feathering favors, sold access, lied under oath and ultimately betrayed his ''closest friend'' - but because he was both badly and wrongfully prosecuted.

A Theatrical Vision Endures
LEAD: ''OUR TOWN'' MAY BE the most misunderstood and misinterpreted of American plays.
It is not, as is often assumed, a hymn to small-town life at the turn of the century.

An Ex-A&amp;R Man Reflects On a Not-Quite-Overnight Hit
LEAD: AT ONE TIME OR another, I imagine, every pop critic has entertained fantasies of changing the course of music by going to work for a record company and discovering the next Beatles, Prince or Whitney Houston.
The record executives entrusted with acquiring new talent are known as A&amp;R people (the initials stand for artists and repertoire).


Food; LET THEM EAT PASTRY

The New York Delegation Learns Teamwork Power
LEAD: UPON arriving in Washington in 1975, Representative Thomas J. Downey says, he quickly discovered that there was no issue so simple, so trivial, so innocuous that the New York Congressional delegation would not squabble over it. ''There were factions, there were people who wouldn't talk to each other, it was really unbelievable,'' the Suffolk County

A February wedding is planned.


GOING MY WAY
LEAD: TRAVEL ACCESSORIES APPEAL to the boy in the man, the gadget-loving kid with a perpetual yen for novelty.
They also offer some men the rare chance to pamper themselves.
For, unless they are planning a trip, ''Men don't often treat themselves,'' says Robert K. Ermatinger, executive vice president of the Luggage and Leather Goods Manufacturers of


Passing the Baton
LEAD: Zubin Mehta will be leaving the New York Philharmonic at the end of the 1990-91 season.

First, he announced that 1990-91 would be his last season.


Peace Returns To Giant Fans
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


FINE GALLIC TOUCHES IN GREAT NECK
LEAD: MOST of the great restaurants are chef-owned.
Long Island's are no exception.
Often, it's husband in the kitchen, wife in the dining room and satisfied diners at the tables.
Le Marquis in Great Neck takes the formula one step further: not only is the wife in the dining room, so are the brother-in-law, sister-in-law and mother-in-law.


Theater
LEAD: For more than a decade Penn &amp; Teller, ''two eccentric guys who have learned to do a few cool things,'' as they like to say, have been refining their own curious exhibition of comedy, magic and menace.
Now their show is back in New York - on Broadway no less, in the Ritz Theater at 219 West 48th Street.

SCIENCE FICTION
LEAD: Arthur C. Clarke's ''2061: ODYSSEY THREE'' (Del Rey/Ballantine, $17.95) is a pallid sequel to ''2010: Odyssey Two,'' which was a pallid sequel to Mr.
Clarke's splendid ''2001.'' The new novel has no characters of interest, generates virtually no narrative tension and barely touches on the enigmatic monoliths that figured so prominently in the previous books; rather than resolving anything, the ending is a shameless come-on for ''Odyssey Four.

To the Top of Africa
LEAD: IT began as a pilgrimage, a sentimental voyage to Africa's northernmost cape to complement earlier voyages that had led to another cape, far to the south, at a continent's tip.
But it ended more as uncharted meandering along Tunisia's less beaten tracks, beach and forest and antiquity, a journey freckled with surprise and discovery: how, for instance, to prepare and cook a brik; or how they hunt wild boar in the winter with dogs, beaters and shotguns in the uplands back from the coast.


Moviegoers, in Protest, Pan $7 Ticket Prices

By W. E. B. Griffin. (Putnam, $16.95.) This seventh volume of W. E. B. Griffin's ''Brotherhood of War'' series brings back many of the same characters whose military careers have been delineated in the first six.
The series is in the platoon-movie genre - one of everything.
There is, for example, the Jewish soldier who is both a decorated hero and an intelligence officer so good at his job that he hobnobs with President Johnson in the Oval Office.


Question Of the Week; Can Bo Jackson Succeed in 2 Sports?
LEAD: Does success mean becoming a Hall-of-Fame candidate in both?
Does success mean making the Pro Bowl and the all-star teams?

He can succeed at both baseball and football without being a superman.
MARK D. HERZFELD


JESSE JACKSON AIMS FOR THE MAINSTREAM
LEAD: There are any number of questions to be asked about a Jackson candidacy: the advisability of someone so closely related to a ministry assuming the Presidency, is he or isn't he a racist, and, having had Jimmy Carter, do we really want another ''outsider'' administration?
But Joyce Purnick and Michael Oreskes deliver the usual private appraisals of character - anecdotes from teachers, the circumstances of his birth, etc.

Talking: Loans; Buying Business Space
LEAD: FOR a small-business man, owning rather than renting commercial space has always been a tantalizing option.

Sandinistas, In a Corner, May Make Concessions
LEAD: IT was a bad week for peace prospects in Central America and a pretty poor week for the political standing of Nicaragua's ruling Sandinistas as well.

Question Of the Week; Can Bo Jackson Succeed in 2 Sports?
LEAD: The real question isn't can he do both, but can he play baseball.

CLASHING VIEWS RESHAPE ART HISTORY
LEAD: SOME CALL THEM ''RADICALS,'' ''REVISION-ists'' or simply troublemakers.
But to others -and to themselves - they are challenging the traditional insularity of art history.
Energetic, contentious and often controversial, they are a loose-knit community of scholars in universities throughout the country who use methods derived from outside the field to study the visual arts as more than a purely esthetic phenomenon.

SANTA CLAUS: WHEN BELIEF WAS RESTORED
LEAD: ''ARE you up there, Santa Claus?''


Don't Forget to Dust the House

GIANTS AWAKE AND WIN ONE

Switzerland
LEAD: To the Editor: Re ''On the Fringe of Switzerland'' by Anthony Burgess (Travel, Nov. 22): Does Mr.
Burgess perchance overindulge in sour cherries as a favorite fare?
Why not try a hooker of Kirsch instead (from Basel; the one from Zug is bitter) or even some grappa from Ticino to brighten his dyspeptic overview of the


LEAVING HIS IMPRINT ON BROADWAY
LEAD: I do not question Lloyd Richards's esteemed place in the American theater (''Leaving His Imprint on Broadway,'' by Samuel G. Freedman, Nov. 22).

Moynihan's Pitch: A Man of Action
LEAD: TO hear some New York politicians tell it, only half in jest, one would approach Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan for a history of immigration but go to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato for a passport.
It is part of a perception of Mr.

D'Amato as a shouter and doer.

LEAD: IN most endeavors there exist tests of endurance and fortitude by which to judge a field's very limits.

LONG LIVE BABE'S MOMENTS
LEAD: MORE than half a century after his last home run and nearly four decades after his death, Babe Ruth is still making headlines, still creating debate.
Just as his 714 homers and his 94-46 record with a 2.28 earned run average as a left-handed pitcher certify him as the best player in baseball history, his enduring esteem as a newsmaker is another reason why he remains the most celebrated baseball player in history.


Jets Have Slim Chance

LEAD: Should New York City's next schools chancellor be more an educator or an administrator?

Righetti, and Other Gifts
LEAD: THAT was a nice gesture on the part of Dave Righetti, giving himself to George Steinbrenner for the holidays.

For Rock, Serious Issues and Roots Revivals
LEAD: THE FACE OF ROCK, 1987, WAS the face of U2's lead singer, Bono Vox.
Unglamorous, unsmiling, contorted with emotion, imploring attention for the songs rather than himself, he acts not like an overgrown bad boy or a high-living hedonist but an everyman about to explode with hopes and fears.
It is the face of popular music feeling its power and its global reach, and taking them very seriously.

CABLE FLEXES ITS OPTIONS
LEAD: THIS WAS THE YEAR WHEN THE LONG-heralded promise of more meaningful viewing options for the home audience began coming into clearer focus.

TIME FOR TRUTH
LEAD: American supporters of Israel have made a crucial difference to the Jewish state's safety and development.

LEAD: HARDY is a word often used in defining how well a plant grows, but it is a relative term.
A plant that is considered hardy in a certain area should survive cold weather and not be subject to frost damage.

Going Out in Action
LEAD: WHEN Gary Fencik announced earlier that this would be his final season of professional football, it appeared that the Chicago Bears' 33-year-old safety, a Yale graduate, would be closing an outstanding 12-year career in an unfamilair manner: riding the bench.
But Coach Mike Ditka changed the situation when he announced that, in an effort to shake up the 10-4 Bears, who have lost their last two games, there would be seven new starters for the team's regular-season finale today against the Los Angeles Raiders.

Pop for Grown-Ups Gathers Momentum
LEAD: EVEN IN THE BEST OF artistic climates, the majority of pop music has always been conceived as disposable light commercial entertainment.

FOR MEHTA, THE SABBATICAL WASN'T ALL PLAY
LEAD: SABBATICALS ARE AN IN-grained part of academic life, but they are less common for conductors.
Yet a yearlong sabbatical is just what Zubin Mehta took in 1987, a state of grace from which he returns this week to take up his fulltime duties as music director of the New York Philharmonic.

Stationery on Bond Street
LEAD: LIKE most stores that have reached the century mark (and they're not exactly rare in London), Smythson of Bond Street, which celebrated its 100th birthday in September, has few qualms about trading on its past.

Dance
LEAD: The Joffrey Ballet brings its new production of ''The Nutcracker'' to New York this week, for a week only, opening on Wednesday at City Center (131 West 55th Street).

LEAD: To the Editor:


A New Breed Challenges the Illusion of Realism
LEAD: IS IT TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING, OR a sign of a new mood?
In either case, the acknowledged modern masters of photography failed to command the lion's share of attention in terms of 1987's major exhibitions.
Some have been overexposed to the point that their images have begun to pale.

They make airborne assaults on moun-tains, schussing head down, soaring off a bump intentionally placed to spring them 40 yards into the air, just to test, kind of, their sang-froid - and if everything's O.K., no blown-out knees, they glide home at 80 miles an hour.

IN THE WORK FORCE, A REAGAN EVOLUTION
LEAD: THROUGHOUT his Presidency, Ronald Reagan has sought to shrink Federal Government.

State and local governments were to take over these tasks, and Federal employment was to hold steady as state and municipal hiring grew.


From Euphoria to Glory to Grand Scope
LEAD: WAS IT ALWAYS SO EASY TO find great performers as it is today?
They are all over the landscape, helpfully labeled for us by arts packagers.
Here they come, armies of great singers, great violinists, great pianists, great conductors, great computer programmers.
Others fall into old but strangely new categories marked designer or stage director, whose most celebrated celebrities now invite us to enjoy the odd sensation of experiencing music as primarily a visual art to which aimless sounds are added, generally quite unobtrusively, though occasionally with the wit and subtlety of a laugh track


THE MONUMENTAL UPS AND DOWNS OF LJUBOJEVIC

FICTION
LEAD:  THE FLOOD.
By John Broderick. (Marion Boyars/ Kampmann, $22.95.) Forget about plot.
John Broderick's latest novel, ''The Flood,'' which is set during the 1930's in Bridgeford, Ireland (population 8,767), boasts such a colorful jumble of characters and voices one barely notices that its story is thin and inconsequential.

Pop Music

Photography
LEAD: Humor and art are not always allies, especially when it comes to photographs of dogs.
But William Wegman's new color pictures at Pace/ MacGill Gallery (11 East 57th Street, through Jan. 16) manage to make us laugh and think at the same time.
In ''Hatched,'' for example, we see the artist's new pet Weimaraner, Fay Ray, wrapped in red-faced aluminum foil, looking somewhat like a Christmas gift and somewhat like a half-opened bonbon.


Redskins Stymie Vikings
LEAD: Ali Haji-Sheikh, who missed a 33-yard field goal with 46 seconds left in regulation, kicked a 26-yarder at 2 minutes 9 seconds into overtime today, as the Washington Redskins temporarily prevented the Minnesota Vikings from earning the final National Football Conference wild-card spot with a 27-24 victory.

Headliners; Out of Russia
LEAD: Like many other Jewish scientists in the Soviet Union, Aleksandr Lerner was long denied permission to emigrate because, officials said, he knew too much.

LIKE A HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE
LEAD: THE 1987 razzle-dazzle award goes to Caffe Spasso in Carle Place.
Even at holiday time with the overkill of glitter and glow from nearby Fortunoff and Roosevelt Field, this restaurant stands out.
Saturday night at the pink neon-edged, Art Deco-style building resembles a 1930's Hollywood premiere.
The parking lot is jammed; the crowd is out the door.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: JOHN THEODORACOPULOS, a 22-year-old apprentice with a merchant bank, was talking about New Year's Eve recently with a group of friends and, he said, they all agreed.

When the Tide Turned on Rampant Growth
LEAD: THE EXTRAORDINARY EVENT in architecture in 1987 was surely the building that collapsed before it was ever built: the tower designed by Moshe Safdie for the site of the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle.
What was extraordinary was not the actual design for this building, which was a wretched piece of architecture, but the circumstances surrounding its demise.


EARLY MUSIC AND THE OFFBEAT SET THE PACE
LEAD: EVER SINCE THE ADVENT OF the compact disk, the record companies' release lists have been filling up with reissues of back catalogue.
But their activities heretofore in this regard paled beside the reissue onslaught of 1987.
Not that it's surprising, or even bad: the CD has become the format of choice among classical-music record buyers, and naturally one wants as many valuable recordings as possible from the analogue era to remain readily available.


4 Die in Dutch Fire
LEAD: Two prisoners and two firefighters died in a fire at police headquarters Friday, and officials said today that the fire may have been set by a burglary suspect in his cell.

To Improve Medicaid's Bad Deal

Dervishes
LEAD: To the Editor: I am writing about an oversight in the article entitled ''A Flourishing of Whirling Dervishes'' (Travel, Dec. 6).
My translation of a quatrain by Rumi appeared without crediting the book in which it was originally published and without mentioning my name.
The translation first appeared in the book entitled ''Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi and the Whirling Dervishes'' by Talat Sait Halman and Metin And (published in Istanbul in 1983 by Dost).


A Crowded Schedule in Stamford
LEAD: THE concert season runs from fall through spring and so, naturally enough, do most subscription series.
For some reason, though, the Stamford Center for the Arts decided to crowd all but a handful of its many events into the first five months of 1988, so there's still time to take advantage of reduced subscription rates to five different cycles at the Palace


Candlewood Trims the Fat to Stay Alive

MacPhersn Finds Sugar Bowl Sweet
LEAD: A bowl game is college football's equivalent of a corporate convention, mixing business and pleasure.

The move was expected because FCB/L.K.P. is also the agency for a bunch of Colgate-Palmolive products.
