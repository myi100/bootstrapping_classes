Carnegie Hall was the scene of a concert performance of Janacek's ''Jenufa'' in which Leonie Rysanek's hair-raising portrayal of the murderous Kostelnicka aroused the audience to the kind of thunderous enthusiasm that is seldom heard in opera houses nowadays, and even less often warranted.


Restaurants
LEAD: IT might seem that midtown Manhattan needs another $250-a-day hotel about as much as it needs another T-shirt shop, yet here is the lavishly renovated former Gotham Hotel, a dignified turn-of-the-century landmark on Fifth Avenue, newly rechristened Hotel Maxim's de Paris.
The $100 million face lift includes two restaurants that feature intriguing Mediterranean-style fare, one called Bistro d'Adrienne, the other a more formal setting called simply

NEW YORKERS, ETC.

LEAD: FOR both political parties, it was a week of some turmoil and apprehension, but the reasons for the unease were very different.


Kansas and Oklahoma Are the Final Two; Jayhawks' Defense Stops Duke by 66-59
LEAD: Near the end of a season that had once seemed lost, the Kansas Jayhawks used an overwhelming defensive presence to build an early lead, then overcame exhaustion and a Duke comeback tonight to defeat the Blue Devils, 66-59.
With the victory, they advanced to the championship game of the National Collegiate Athletic


Contras' Future: Crippled as Warriors

ON BEING WRONG: CONVICTED MINIMALIST SPILLS BEANS
LEAD: With all the talk in these and other pages about the new, faulty literature, about things left out and whole tenses turning up bum, not to mention indictments for excessive reticence, moral snorkeling and too much time in the grocery store, a writer hardly has time to put a new word up on the easel, let alone paint it, before somebody's deciding it's the wrong word.


STREETSCAPES: The Knickerbocker Field Club; Fire-Damaged Flatbush Landmark May Be Razed
LEAD: THE Landmarks Preservation Commission has before it a knotty problem involving the Knickerbocker Field Club, a charming clapboard clubhouse built in 1893 that was heavily damaged - but not destroyed - by fire last January.

FICTION
LEAD:  IMAGIO.
By James McClure. (Penzler, $16.95.) Here's a warning for novelists and novel readers alike.
Beware of paragraphs, such as the one on page 9 of James McClure's ''Imago,'' that talk about the ordinariness of facing a midlife crisis - because in all probability they signal an author's unsuccessful attempt at reweaving a threadbare theme.

Rynn Berry of New York and Oyster Bay, L.I., plan to marry May 21, the parents of the bride-to-be, Mr. and Mrs.

Review/Music; Berg Violin Concerto
LEAD: Patches of empty seats dotted the orchestra section of Avery Fisher Hall at the New York Philharmonic's all-Romantic matinee Friday afternoon; perhaps subscribers noted the names of Berg and Webern on the bill and feared something forbidding.
The former's Violin Concerto and the latter's Passacaglia for Orchestra were not played quite as romantically as they might have been - both tended to move bar-by-bar, not in poetic, airborne spans - but their harmonic and timbral richness would surely not prove alienating to such a large part of the orchestra's regular audience.


LOOK QUICKLY, IT'S BIPARTISAN POLICY
LEAD: CAPITOL Hill seemed unusually blessed last week with the appearance, if not the true spirit, of that most elusive of legislative achievements - bipartisan foreign policy.


Not Much Movement In the Winfield Market
LEAD: Another day went by and there was still no trade involving Dave Winfield.
There might never be one.


The Vanishing Lieder Ritual
LEAD: Every concert audience plays a part in a ceremony whose roots lie buried in the primeval ooze, one with sacred rituals ruled over by gifted celebrants who manipulate mass emotions and give dramatic expression to communally held values.
People who grow up attending such events do not so much learn their roles as absorb them unconsciously, by a kind of social osmosis.


A Need to Be Stirred
LEAD: A Greek journalist asked the other day whether the rise of Jesse Jackson meant U.S. politics was swinging ''to the left again.'' It was a reminder of how far the old vocabulary has lagged behind the developing issues of government and politics.

A Gospel Show Marches to a Different Beat
LEAD: Unifying classic Greek tragedy and American gospel music, ''The Gospel at Colonus'' was the revelation of the 1983 Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Review/Opera; DEMBSKA'S 'JUNIPER TREE'
LEAD: Depending on your definition of things operatic, Anna Dembska's ''Juniper Tree'' at the Henry Street Settlement last Sunday night was or was not what it said it was - an opera.
This retelling of the Grimm tale could also be called a dramatic monologue - or a one-woman show with minimal props.
With Carol Emanuel playing the harp and Tim Moran doubling on the flute and saxophone, Miss Dembska's storytelling narrates and illustrates, with choreographed gestures acting out both overt action and inner turmoil.


Jesus Died -- And Then What Happened
LEAD: ''IF Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is in vain.'' Wherever members of the clergy prepare their Easter sermons, those words from St.
Paul's letter to the Corinthians almost certainly echo in their minds.

Mustard Adds a Special Zing to the Flavor of Many Foods
LEAD: NOTHING wakes the palate and perks up the flavor in food like a touch of mustard.
But more often we think of it as something to be spread on a hot dog or added to a salad dressing than to be used for cooking.
I like to mix mustard with oil and brush it lightly over fish fillets before broiling them.


NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Meadville, Pa.; Conversions Bring Hope

'No Regrets'
LEAD: Long after Jean Herman's holdout is forgotten, passersby will wonder why a four-story brownstone protrudes from the side of a 31-story office tower on East 60th Street near Lexington Avenue.

Installing an Outlet For Outdoor Electricity
LEAD: THE most recent revision of the National Electric Code, upon which many local electrical codes are based, requires that all new homes be equipped with at least one outdoor electric outlet.

LEAD: Q. My 65-year-old house has a red brick chimney running up through the center of the house.
About five or six of the bricks in the bottom of this chimney (in the basement) seem to be eroding along their entire length and height, leaving red brick powder on the floor.
Bricks on either side are not affected.


Ewing Outduels Olajuwon as Knicks Hang On
LEAD: The losses and injuries he suffered during his first two seasons are a memory now.
The record may not be great, but the Knicks are in contention for a playoff berth for the first time since Patrick Ewing became their center, and it is bringing out the best in him.
Playing his best game of the season, Ewing scored a season-high 36 points, leading the Knicks to a 104-98 victory against the Houston

LEAD: WITH the death of Representative James J. Howard nine days ago and the announced retirement of Representative Peter W. Rodino, New Jersey has lost its two most powerful Congressmen.

Two Reminders: ... And Add 3/
LEAD: Postal rates increase today, to 25 cents for a one-ounce, first-class letter (20 cents for each additional ounce) and 15 cents for a post card.
The E stamp, worth 25 cents, can be used on domestic mail but not on international mail, for which rates also rose.

Mustard Adds a Special Zing to the Flavor of Many Foods
LEAD: NOTHING wakes the palate and perks up the flavor in food like a touch of mustard.
But more often we think of it as something to be spread on a hot dog or added to a salad dressing than to be used for cooking.
I like to mix mustard with oil and brush it lightly over fish fillets before broiling them.


How Will The Mets And Yanks Do in '88?
LEAD: Yankees 99-63, Mets 97-65, both good for division flags.
Mets over Reds, 4-1.

JEFF MARINER  New Hyde Park, L.I.


Correction
LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article on March 20 about the Indonesian province of East Timor omitted a sentence in a passage on the release of political prisoners.
It should have read: ''The prison on Atauro Island, 20 miles offshore from the East Timorese capital of Dili, has been closed, although about 200 former prisoners elected to stay there or around Dili.


WOMEN LAWYERS
LEAD: Jill Abramson's article (''For Women Lawyers, an Uphill Struggle,'' March 6) was excellent as far as it went, but it offered little perspective on how difficult it was for women lawyers to break into law in the first place.


THEY ONLY COME OUT AT NIGHT
LEAD: I HAVE BEEN ONE acquainted with the night,'' wrote Robert Frost.
Acquainted, sure.
But you aren't really on intimate terms until you've commuted by night.
For five years, I awoke at 3


What Austria Can't Buy for $416
LEAD: Austria has seemed unable to get anything right about its past since Kurt Waldheim acknowledged two years ago that he served Hitler in the Balkans.
But that, he explained, was long ago.
He was a youth doing his duty and besides, he knew little about the killings of Jews, hostages and British prisoners.


A LA LAIQUE
LEAD: Etched dragonflies, bubble patterns and mica flecks, scenes such as a glass polar bear ambling across an arctic-blue lamp shade - these we find in Victor Arwas's magnificently illustrated GLASS: Art Nouveau to Art Deco (Abrams, $65), a breathtaking ode to man's creativity. ''Glass,'' Mr.
Arwas writes, ''is the end product of the fusion of a siliceous matter, such as powdered flint or fine sand, with an alkali, salt or metallic oxide.


Correction
LEAD: An article on March 13 about marketing black colleges gave an incorrect figure for the number of applications to the School of Veterinary Medicine at Tuskegee University.
For the class entering in the fall of 1987, the school had 259 applications for 60 available seats.


Soviet Union's Ethnic Minorities Find Little Room at Top
LEAD: SOMETIME in the next few months, Mikhail S. Gorbachev will convene a plenary meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee to deal with the bedeviling discontents of ethnic minorities.
Arrayed alongside him on the dais in the circular hall of the Kremlin's Council of Ministers building will be an embarrassing symbol of his problem: The top leadership in this country of more than 100 non-Russian minorities resembles a


U.S.-Latin Military Contact Withers
LEAD: A once-promising channel for United States influence in Latin America, the extensive contact between American and Latin American military officers, has withered and become largely ineffective.


Union Organizers' Task Is Uphill at Nissan Plant
LEAD: Clearly he has a bias, but Jerry Benefield, president of Nissan Motor Company's manufacturing plant here, offers this rough calculation of the prospects that the United Automobile Workers will be able to bring his company's 3,200 employees into the union fold: slim and none.


Cheryl Vieser Is Engaged To Donald S. Kleckner Jr.
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Mr. and Mrs.
Richard W. Vieser of Madison, N.J., and Walpole, N.H., of the engagement of their daughter Cheryl Jane Vieser to Donald Street Kleckner Jr., the son of Mrs.
Kleckner of Chatham Township, N.J., and the late Mr.
Kleckner.
The couple plan to marry in June.


Low Prices Won't Induce Customers to Move
LEAD: ''ON the New Jersey Turnpike no one can hear you scream.'' This slogan, from an advertisement for ''Moving,'' the recent Richard Pryor comedy about ''one family's experience with the 'M' word,'' typifies a problem that has plagued the moving and storage industry for years: a poor reputation.


Wedding Planned By Susan Jacobs
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Frederick L. Jacobs of White Plains and New York have announced the engagement of their daughter, Susan Jacobs, to Richard I. Lobel, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Oscar Lobel of Savannah, Ga.

How Will The Mets And Yanks Do in '88?
LEAD: Frank Cashen has put together the best baseball team in the past 50 years.

Giant Lobster Gets Reprieve
LEAD: A 25-pound lobster that nearly became somebody's dinner will be flown by jet plane to Maine on Monday to live out its old age in the Atlantic Ocean.
Publicity forced a seafood company owner, a seafood lover, an animal-rights group and the Maine Department of Marine Resources into an unlikely alliance to save the lobster, whose age is estimated in the range of 40 to 125 years.


The Tip of the Volcano
LEAD: AT 11 DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE and 104 degrees west longitude, about 1,200 miles west of Managua, Nicaragua, there is a 3,350-foot-high active volcano that no one has ever seen.
It's underwater, the summit 7,460 feet below the surface of the Pacific, a depth to which surface light does not penetrate.


A Time and Place for Radios
LEAD: THE assistant vice president was making me wait while he finished working on the document in his typewriter.
Annoyed, I settled back in the armchair.
I was at a branch bank and wanted to open an account.
Then I heard the strains of soft rock.
The song ended, and I heard a car commercial.
A bank officer was supposed to be at work, and he had a radio on.


Sports of The Times; Johnson and Martin: The Subdued Couple
LEAD: Fashion note: Both Dave Johnson and Billy Martin shaved off their mustaches before spring training.
The desperado look is out.
Patience and humility are in.


Higher Rates for Mail To Take Effect Today

Lacking 'Official' Documents, Aliens Use Alternatives to Gain Citizenship
LEAD: George Montoya has been a compulsive pack rat all his life, hanging onto almost every scrap of paper he got.
Now, that collection of paper may help Mr.

Jody Silverbush to Wed
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Kenneth Silverbush of North Providence, R.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter Jody Lynn Silverbush to Dr.
Todd William Auerbach, a son of Leonard Auerbach of Bayside, Queens, and the late Audrey Auerbach.
Miss Silverbush, a special-education teacher in the New York City school system, graduated from Syracuse University and received a master's degree in special education from the College of New Rochelle.


Q and A
LEAD:  The Use of a Deck


Review/Rock; Robyn Hitchcock's Songs
LEAD: Robyn Hitchcock's songs could stand on their lyrics alone - deadpan, off-the-wall, funny-strange phantasmagorias of protoplasm and its discontents, where ordinary life offers no refuge from organic processes or disruptive visions.
In ''Globe of Frogs,'' the title song of his latest album, a disembodied soul, searching for reincarnation, settles on a lonely old woman whose children have been ''certified insane'' -hardly a standard pop-song scenario.


Words and Music, Without Opera
LEAD: Opera stars of the magnitude of Montserrat Caballe, Luciano Pavarotti and Kiri Te Kanawa supplement their fame and fortune with orchestral concerts and song recitals.
And the same audiences that thrill to their performances at the Metropolitan Opera House flock to their recitals at Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall or even -in Mr.


A Sentence the Offender Takes Home
LEAD: On an end table in Ronnie's modest living room sits an unassuming little box that keeps him sober, working and out of jail.

Making Slam With A Backward Finesse
LEAD: AN ambitious international experiment at the American Contract Bridge League's Spring Nationals in Buffalo last month showed considerable promise but will have to overcome some bugs.


Installing an Outlet For Outdoor Electricity
LEAD: THE most recent revision of the National Electric Code, upon which many local electrical codes are based, requires that all new homes be equipped with at least one outdoor electric outlet.
This doesn't mean that if your home is not so equipped, you can expect a visit from the authorities.
But it does recognize a growing need:


Starving Deer Found At Overpopulated Park
LEAD: BLUFF POINT STATE PARK in Groton has been an ideal deer preserve for years, with dense hardwood forests and no hunting permitted.
Now, conservation officials say, it seems the deer have thrived there too well.


Laura Kurjan Engaged To Robert M. Goldman
LEAD: The engagement of Laura Michelle Kurjan to Robert M. Goldman, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Jack Goldman of Rochester, has been announced by the future bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Marvin A. Kurjan of Woodmere, L.I.
A November wedding is planned.


VERIFICATION IS ABOUT TO BECOME EVEN HARDER
LEAD: THE Reagan Administration has said proudly that the agreement recently signed with Moscow banning medium- and shorter-range missiles contains measures for on-site inspection that are both unprecedented and effective.
But if the two superpowers are able to work out a new treaty reducing long-range arms, it will have to include even more far-reaching ways to verify that each side is abiding by the treaty.


INSIDE
LEAD:  Anti-Smoking Experiment


The Seder and Its Message of Freedom
LEAD: I WAS there when it was truly morning in America.
I watched my newly naturalized father pledge allegiance for the first time, to the flag of the country that had adopted him.
He was not an emotional man, but his eyes glistened with joy.
I was 6 years old at the time, but the moment lives in my memory.


Economic Shifts: How Contrctors and Their Towns Are Adjusting
LEAD: THE Grumman Corporation's military contracting business is becoming ''more demanding and unforgiving,'' according to the company's president.
The same could be said for the Bath Shipyards in Bath, Me., the helicopter and jet engine divisions of the United Technologies Corporation in Connecticut, the airframe builders in southern California and many other companies, as military suppliers adapt to flat or declining


Dukakis Leads Jackson in Wisconsin Poll
LEAD: Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis leads The Rev.
Jesse Jackson in support for Tuesday's Wisconsin primary, according to the latest Milwaukee Journal Poll.


Playing a Tasty Italian Tune
LEAD: PICCOLO is a marvelous mixture.
This new restaurant in the space formerly occupied by the Great Dane Restaurant in Huntington's Southdown Shopping Center is more than a neighborhood Italian restaurant without the expense of a special-occasions spot.


Kyra M. Sedgwick And Kevin Bacon, Actors, Engaged
LEAD: Mrs.
Ben Heller of New York and East Hampton, L.I., and Henry D. Sedgwick of New York and Stockbridge, Mass., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Kyra Minturn Sedgwick, to Kevin Bacon, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edmund Bacon of Philadelphia.


Review/Piano; URUGUAY'S ALBERTO REYES
LEAD: What made Alberto Reyes's piano recital at the 92d Street Y on Thursday evening so exciting was the Uruguayan pianist's way of capturing each work's essence - the quality of its nervous energy, its musical fingerprint - and his ability to transform it into something like a living organism.
His technique, while estimable, is by no means flawless, and fleeting as his slips were, they were jarring.


CINDERELLA OF THE TENEMENTS
LEAD:  ANZIA YEZIERSKA  A Writer's Life.
By Louise Levitas Henriksen  with Jo Ann Boydston.
Illustrated. 327 pp.

PERSPECTIVES: Metrotech; Lease Gives Impetus to Brooklyn Project
LEAD: THE milestones along the route to a construction start in what might be called the megaventures in New York City real-estate development usually pass with barely any public notice, despite their significance.
So it was last month when the 4.2 million-square-foot Metrotech office project in downtown Brooklyn took a crucial step toward its groundbreaking - a lease-signing by the Securities Industry Automation Corporation.

LEAD:  SILVER LININGS  By Charles Cohen.  279 pp. New York:  E. P. Dutton. $17.95.

ARAB RAGE INSIDE ISRAEL
LEAD: ON PEACE DAY IN JAFFA, VICTOR Tayar learned something about his neighbors. ''It was a Monday afternoon, about 3 o'clock,'' said the burly Tayar, sipping coffee in the restaurant he owns and recalling the general strike staged by Israel's Arab citizens on Dec. 21, 1987. ''I heard that the Arabs were holding a demonstration and I was curious.


The Book Sleuth of Stockbridge
LEAD: FROM the shelves that line three walls come titles out of yesterday, bridging the years back to the comfort of the nursery or to long summer afternoons spent reading Nancy Drew on the back porch.


Where Bad Teaching Is Being Taught
LEAD: To the Editor:


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: An article March 30 about electrocardiogram screening for high school athletes misidentified the Long Island community in which a young player died suddenly on a football field in 1983.
It is Glen Head, not Glen Cove.
In addition, a picture caption misidentified a nurse administering an electrocardiogram.


Tippett a Patriot
LEAD: There's nothing like a little new blood and a lot of new money to lead a team to change its mind about how much it needs a high-priced free agent.
That appeared to be the case Friday night when the New England Patriots signed the All-Pro Andre Tippett to a six-year contract that presumably rivals the $4.5 million, five-year deal the free-agent linebacker had reportedly been offered by the San


The Importance of Fashoda
LEAD: To the Editor:


SPRING, AND EVERYONE'S FANCY TURN LIGHTLY
LEAD: NOW is the time to keep a weather eye open while keeping fashion in focus, too.
Spring clothes, always unpredictable and surprising, are even more so this year, as if going along with the now-they're-up, now-they're-down temperatures.


'Personals' Goes Public in Metuchen
LEAD: ON FIRST thought, the notion of a musical revue based on personal classified advertisements seems self-limiting.
But, then, the ever-proliferating number of such ''lonely hearts'' solicitations is a phenomenon of the 1980's, and a certain reverse chic has gone a long way to diminish the embarrassment and alleviate the stigma of those sensitive souls with post-office-box numbers who declare, in anonymity, that they are looking to share langorous afternoons and fun-filled evenings with prospective soul mates.


Meese and Reagan: The Anatomy of a Friendship
LEAD: Once again it was apparent that Edwin Meese 3d's political longevity has rested on his relationship with Ronald Reagan.
For more than 20 years Mr.
Meese has shared emotions and experiences with his chief and hero, performing the role of the ''perfect servant bureaucrat,'' as a mutual friend put it.


Wimps Sweeten The Screen
LEAD: Presidential politics isn't the only realm in which the wimp factor plays a role.
It's also a consideration in film, for works like ''The Milagro Beanfield War,'' in which a group of nice New Mexico townsfolk band together to outsmart a crass developer; ''A New Life,'' the Alan Alda divorce comedy that pretends to have a cutting edge but is, in fact, colored by boundless optimism; ''Dominick and Eugene,'' about a handsome young doctor making huge sacrifices to take care of his mentally deficient twin, and ''Stand and


How Will The Mets And Yanks Do in '88?
LEAD: Mets: 103-59, first in the National League East.

LEAD: For the second time in as many days, a freighter has broken anchor in rough seas and run aground just off the beach, the Coast Guard said today.
The 128-foot Honduran freighter Brac Express was reported mired 30 yards offshore.


IN SEARCH OF GEORGE BUSH
LEAD: Mr.
Rothenberg speaks of George Bush's ''innate moderation.'' Nevertheless, Rothenberg reports the following about Bush's entry into Texas Republican politics: Centrists believe ''he too readily accommodates extremists''; when he won the chairmanship of the Harris County Republican Party, he drew in both ''establishment Republicans and the more militant members of the John Birch Society .


Sarah Moody to Marry R. L. Mariani May 21
LEAD: Sarah Moody, a third-year law student at Georgetown University, and Raymond L. Mariani, an assocate in the New York law firm of Condon &amp; Forsyth, plan to be married May 21, the parents of the future bride, Mr. and Mrs.

An Exhibition With Many Directions
LEAD: THE AURORA, a gallery that will be celebrating its second anniversary next month, has the potential of attracting artists from the ''other side of the border,'' as well as from New Jersey.
And so it may be a sign of things to come that the best-known exhibitor in the present show is Alan Gussow, a resident of Rockland County, N

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN BREAST CANCER
LEAD: In regard to your update about the disturbingly high incidence of breast cancer on Long Island  [ ''Breast Cancer Rate: Puzzle for L.I.,'' March 13 ] , and specifically Nassau County, it is important for women to realize that, now more than ever, they must take this issue into their own hands.


Where Maharajahs Once Played
LEAD: THERE comes a time in Indian travels - after the Britishness of New Delhi, the disbelieving wonder of the Taj Mahal, the delight of peacocks and emeralds in Jaipur, the majestic rock sculpture of Aurangabad's caves, the flashiness and despair of Bombay and the frustration and decayed beauty that is Calcutta - when a gentle respite is in order.


Is Price Too High?
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Correction
LEAD: An article by The Associated Press on March 27 about a protest in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, located the city incorrectly.
It is in central Czechoslovakia, on the southern border.


Installing an Outlet For Outdoor Electricity
LEAD: THE most recent revision of the National Electric Code, upon which many local electrical codes are based, requires that all new homes be equipped with at least one outdoor electric outlet.

Kluszewski Farewell
LEAD: He slugged his way into the hearts of Cincinnati players and fans, and both groups turned out in force yesterday to bid farewell to Ted Kluszewski, the power-hitting ''gentle giant,'' who died of a heart attack last week at the age of 63.
He was the Reds' first baseman from 1947 to 1957 and served as the team's batting coach during the Big Red


A Net to Catch Playwrights BefCre They Fall Away
LEAD: The American theater does not lack for playwrights.
It has playwrights, plenty of them, mostly young ones.
They are all over the place, and when I say playwrights I mean that they have not only written plays, they have had at least one produced professionally and they have stood there and watched it succeed.

Robert Joffrey and His Great American Dream
LEAD: In many ways, Robert Joffrey embodied the American dream.
The son of an Italian mother and an Afghan restaurant owner, he was typically American.
Others might want a home with a picket fence; the child who grew up in Seattle as Abdullah Jaffa Anver Bey Khan dreamed of founding his own ballet troupe.


LEARNING THE ART OF BRINGING UP BABY
LEAD: Twenty-three-year-old Pam Thomas is the mother of three children, 5 years old, 4 years old and 4 months old.

Prost and Piquet Are Favored
LEAD: Formula One auto racing is a sport in transition, with new rules forcing a technical revolution in the world's premier form of motorsport.
Although the deck has been thoroughly shuffled over the winter, when the new game starts today with the season-opening Brazilian Grand Prix (ESPN, 11:50 A.M.), the strongest hands should be held by a familiar pair of drivers, Alain Prost and Nelson


The Grip of Tennis
LEAD: I CAN'T begin to count all the years I have played tennis indoors, or how many different players I have been with.
Of course, there have been changes; the years have brought not only new personalities but new artificial turfs, better lighting, more heat.
When I finally, reluctantly, have to leave, what will be my legacy to my tennis friends?

The Physician In the New Age Of Health Care
LEAD: THE next time you are a patient in the hospital, take pity on your doctor.
Never mind that you are a diagostic enigma or therapeutic dilemma.
Forget about all the blood tests that are drawn and the myriad of X-rays with all those unpleasant ''cleanouts.''And ignore the insipid food, the inconveniences and your loss of dignity.


THE NATION: THE PENTAGON IS LEARNING TO LIVE WITH LESS;
LEAD: THIS year's annual report to Congress from Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci 3d bore a startling notation over a chart projecting the Navy's shipbuilding plans for 1990 and beyond: ''Subject to further review,'' it said.


Review/Jazz; Piano and Songs, by O'Brien and Nakasian
LEAD: When Hod O'Brien was first heard playing piano in New York in the 1950's, he was a product of the be-bop era, with a style that drew on the playing of Bud Powell.
In recent years Mr.
O'Brien has been working as a duo with the singer Stephanie Nakasian, primarily in New Jersey, and the rumbling, swaggering lines of Dave McKenna have replaced the fleet, be-bop virtuosity of Powell as Mr.


On the Road, 1988: New Dangers and Decline in Hitchhiking
LEAD: ''Somewhere along the line I knew there'd be girls, visions, everything,'' Jack Kerouac wrote in ''On the Road,'' his classic 1950's paean to thumbing his way across America, and to lowlife joys of the road. ''Somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me.''

How Will The Mets And Yanks Do in '88?
LEAD: Billy Martin's old sidekick, Art Fowler, will probably ruin the Yankees' already shaky pitching.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE: 102 of the Most Influential Companies Outside America.
By Milton Moskowitz. (Macmillan, $24.95.) From Nestle and Nissan to Philips and Fiat, this hefty volume offers a glimpse of many giant corporations around the globe.
The flood of foreign investment into the United States - the result, in large part, of a weak dollar - makes the book a timely one.


'Nixon' Opens a New Chapter for Opera
LEAD: We are accustomed to contemporary opera's being either dense and harsh, or, if ''accessibility'' is attempted, forlorn and derivative.
It can also, of late, be Minimalist, but the long works of Philip Glass seem more like pageants than operas to many people, and many find them numbingly repetitive.


Going On in The Northeast
LEAD:  NAVAJO BLANKETS


Report Warns on Efforts to Reduce Class Size
LEAD: A report by the Department of Education says that any major attempt to reduce class sizes in public schools would be very expensive and probably ''a waste of money and effort.''

Two Italian film makers, Yervant Gianikian and Angela Ricci Lucchi, have drawn upon turn-of-the-century film from regions that were then fabulously exotic - the Arctic, India, Africa and less remote but equally striking settings in the Dolomites and the Caucasus - and assembled it at a sleepwalker's pace, with changeable color tints and a humming electronic score.

Review/Art; Works for Urban College Raise Hard Questions
LEAD: Suspended from the ceiling of the mall of York College in Queens is a skeletal sculpture by Martin Puryear called ''Ark.'' It is 70 feet long, 36 feet tall and 6 feet wide.

Charles Ryskamp Brings a New Look To the Frick

Architecture: Cycles of Invention
LEAD: There was a time, a decade or so ago, when nothing in architecture was more startling than the mere idea of putting a gable on a house.
How clever, how brazen even, such a thing seemed to eyes conditioned by years of sleek metal and glass.

Look at me - I'm 53 years old and I'm just learning how to read.


'Doomed' Hotel That Lives On
LEAD: SINCE opening in 1921, the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles has had ample publicity as a mecca for movie, political and social luminaries.
But starting in May 1986, the news was more like an obituary.


A Compact for Boston's Hard Work High
LEAD: AT AGE 15, Maria is facing fractions again.
Her challenge this sixth period in Boston's English High School class in basic math is identifying lowest common denominators.
Can two-sixteenths be reduced further?
She stares at the problem, unsure how to respond until a tutor guides her painstakingly through numerator and denominator toward the realization that 16 can be divided by 2.


Shell-Rich Marco Island
LEAD: FROM the highest elevation in southwest Florida the vista opens wide across the Gulf of Mexico.
But there's no fear of altitude sickness as you scan the horizon, for you're only 58 feet above sea level on Indian Hill, in a residential neighborhood on Marco Island.
And even this gentle mound is an artificial height, laboriously created, basket by shell-filled basket, over hundreds of years by Calusa Indian women.

Summertime, and the Learning Is Pleasing
LEAD: FINDING the right summer activity for a child too young to draw a paycheck or too blase for Camp Cowabunga (or the like) can be a daunting task for parents.
Happily, an interesting mix of programs can be found for children as young as 6 and ranging up to 18-year-olds who prefer educational and cultural enrichment to the rigors of a job.


PERSPECTIVES: The Lefrak Plan; Using Condo Sales to Assist New Rentals
LEAD: SOUTH of Delancey Street, the Lower East Side is something of a housing museum.
Most of the governmental programs used to produce new urban housing since the days when Alfred E. Smith was Governor are on view there.


THE SELLING OF VERMONT
LEAD: IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYPLACE IN the United States, but it looked like nowhere in particular.
All around was the sort of cartoon architecture that more and more makes us appear to be a civilization of overfed clowns - the golden arches of burgerdom, the revolving red-and-white-striped chicken bucket, the fake mansard roof announcing the ubiquitous pizza - plus a full complement of motels, car dealerships, discount merchandise plazas with their vast parking lagoons.


The Time for Roses
LEAD: BE careful with footwork in the asparagus patch where young spears are starting to emerge; as soon as they are of edible height on mature (over two years) plantings, for best flavor break them off just in time for dinner.
Finish pruning fruit trees.
Indoors, turn seedlings daily if set near windowsills to keep stems straight; don't neglect half-rate applications of water-soluble fertilizer to support their growth.


Coming to Terms With Bilingualism in New York City Schools
LEAD: IN 1974, The United States Supreme Court ruled that students who do not speak English are entitled to special language instruction as a matter of equal educational opportunity.

How to Avoid a Phony Powder Horn
LEAD: THE TRICKERY EXPLORED in the exhibition ''April Fool: Folk Art Fakes and Forgeries'' is as old as art itself and always a subject of absorbing interest to collectors.

Tracking Wiltshire's White Horses
LEAD: ''THERE'S an old White Horse cut in the side of the highest hill hereabouts and many folks sets a good deal of store by it. '' The words are those of Thomas Hughes, the 19th-century British writer who gave us ''Tom Brown's Schooldays.'' Hughes grew up in the village of Uffington, beneath a northern escarpment of the Berkshire Downs some 50 miles west of London.

Homelessness Under Study
LEAD: AT A Los Angeles inner-city high school, students in a government class are creating a video documentary on homelessness.
In a Yale University seminar, students spend an entire day on the streets with New Haven's homeless.
In New York City a pen-pal program has been set up between students at the Fieldston School, a private school in the Bronx, and homeless students at a public elementary school on the Lower East


Hard Times for Three Big Banks
LEAD: THE New York banking scene is going through wrenching change that is likely to lead to a major realignment of banking power within the city and the nation over the next few years.


Headliners; Tibet vs. China
LEAD: It is a tenet of Buddhism that the path to salvation avoids the extremes of self-mortification and self-indulgence and runs between them, in the middle.
There, too, lies the path by which the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, apparently hopes to return to his native land.
The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after Chinese troops quelled an uprising by Tibetan nationalists, was visiting Great Britain last week when the Chinese offered to allow him to return to Tibet if he would abandon the cause of nationalism.


Does Steinbrenner Help or Hurt The Yanks?
LEAD: Steinbrenner definitely helps the Yankees . . . and Jack Clark will play in 150 games, Billy Martin will manage the team into the 1990's and a Winfield for Fred Lynn trade would be a brilliant move.
STEVEN USLANER  Fresh Meadows


Career Ladders for Teachers on The Rise
LEAD: FIVE YEARS AGO this month, the National Commission on Excellence in Education declared that America was ''A Nation at Risk'' because of the failings of the American educational system.
One way to mitigate the risk, it suggested, is a ''career ladder,'' an incentive pay plan that rewards teachers and administrators for doing better work or for taking on more responsibilities.

From Kudelka, Pinteresque Ballets
LEAD: JAMES KUDELKA, THE 32-year-old Canadian choreographer, has been called the Harold Pinter of dance.
A darkly intense man with short-cropped black hair and restless eyes, his works teem with shadowy undercurrents of emotional ambiguity and inference.
By critical consensus, he is a new voice in ballet, and on Tuesday, his choreographic art will be given major display when Les Grands Ballets Canadiens opens a brief season (through April 17), at the Brooklyn Academy of


Judge Delays Mecham Trial
LEAD: A judge has granted a defense lawyer's motion to delay the criminal trial of former Gov.

Judge Ryan agreed to postpone the Mechams' trial to May 19 from April 21.


A Marshall Spirit
LEAD: SHOCK, outrage, sheepishness at having been bamboozled and grudging admiration all went into making up the meaning of a ''Marshall swindle'' or, later, just plain ''swindle.''

New York:  An I Can Read Book/Harper &amp; Row.


Eye on the Doughnut
LEAD: IF YOU ASK my opinion - and even if you don't - one of the least wonderful things about having a technical job is that when you come home after work and the spouse of your choice says, ''Did you have a nice day, dear?'' you can say ''Yes,'' ''No'' or ''None of the above.'' But chances are you can't explain why.


P. S. du Pont 3d, 77, Candidate's Father And Business Leader

LEAD: ALTHOUGH Earle Bruce received a payment of $471,000 as a buyout of his contract when he was dismissed as football coach by Ohio State last November, the 57-year-old veteran of 35 years on the sideline is not a happy man on the sideline this spring.

The Low Dollar Has Worked Wonders
LEAD: NEARLY two centuries ago Alexander Hamilton, in his famous ''Report on Manufactures,'' tied the future of the United States to the health of its manufacturing sector.
Hamilton's prescient words still ring true today.


Adaptable Antiques
LEAD: Antiques have many attractions: They represent substance and continuity while evoking the past, their various styles suit numerous tastes and they are frequently handcrafted with a quality no longer seen today.
But because they were often created for a culture that no longer exists, their intended purpose may not be applicable to a 1980's life style.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: CRIMINAL TENDENCIES.
By William O'Rourke. (Dutton, $19.95.) This crime thriller, William O'Rourke's third novel, is set within the glitzy, sleazy confines of Key West - ''Disneyland for dropouts,'' as one of the characters thinks of it.
With the Mariel boatlift of 1980 as a sociohistorical backdrop, the author assembles a sorry gang of small-time criminals and their mixed-up girlfriends, along with a few jaded writers, and sets them loose on the island.

Fine Debut Marks 'Anna Christie'
LEAD: EUGENE O'NEILL'S Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Anna Christie,'' which opened in 1921, remains one of this master's most accessible plays.
Currently at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale, this highly romantic drama about people whose lives are shaped by circumstances as arbitrary as storms at sea still manages to pack a dramatic wallop.

CAMPAIGN OF BUSH GIVES UP SPOTLIGHT
LEAD: Whenever Vice President Bush made public comment on a campaign swing the last two days, he offered words that were not likely to attract much attention.


What's Ahead for the Fed?
LEAD: The jobless rate is down and much of the economy is at near capacity - the classic condition for inflation.
Typically, the Federal Reserve responds to these pressures by raising interest rates.
Last week, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds jumped to 8.87 percent, the highest since January.
Is the Fed now worried about inflation?


Q and A
LEAD:  Violations in a Conversion


Why Du Pont Gave Up $600 Million
LEAD: IN 1974, when stratospheric ozone depletion was still a theory, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company made a pledge: If scientists proved that chlorofluorocarbons were a threat to public health, the company would stop making the chemicals.
On March 24, 1988, Du Pont honored that commitment and announced its intention to phase out production of the most ozone-damaging C.F.C.

He is remembered as the father of the Quaker who founded Pennsylvania, but Ms.


The Lessons of Hate
LEAD: The tension and the harshness of vocabulary appear higher than ever in Israel.
But that isn't exactly so.
It is an impression nourished by the foolish assumption that the status quo could go on indefinitely, that if it didn't heal wounds, time would blunt the urge to violence and restore quiescence.


Mothers' Legacies, Gifts of Hand, Heart and Soul
LEAD: RILEY'S box sat in a corner of my studio.
This large wicker chest had been here since my daughter and her husband announced they would become parents.


South Africa
LEAD: To the Editor ''South Africa's Economy Faces an Unsteady Future'' (March 13) ignores the fact that labor reform in South Africa is one of the major achievements of the reform initiatives undertaken by my Government in recent years.
Where else in Africa (or indeed in the third world) is trade union activity of the kind seen at work in South Africa to be found, let alone officially permitted?

Agnes Roman Catholic Church in Greenwich, Conn., Jean Marie Colloton, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Fiero Facing Its Swan Song Amid Some Mourning
LEAD: THE auto show was in New York this week.
Lots of hot lights, red neon, cars glittering on revolving platforms.
And, at the Pontiac stand, there was one sad white Fiero, among other things.


New Elements, Old Effects
LEAD: This 1920's stone house, dramatically situated on the top of a hill, looks as if it were transported from the English countryside.
The private walled entrance court, casement windows, stone terracing and outbuildings and 19th-century cast-iron garden furniture could well be included in the setting for an old romance.


Seeing Schubert Whole
LEAD: ALFRED BRENDEL HAS LONG taken it upon himself not only to challenge but also to change certain stereotypes about Schubert's music.


RICHARD FORD'S UNCOMMON CHARACTERS
LEAD: RICHARD FORD AND his wife, Kristina, have just rented another house, a double trailer they plan to use as a hunting cabin next fall.
It's about 30 miles east of Great Falls, Mont., snug up against the Highwood Mountains, an isolated range of peaks that seems to have just sprouted out of the high plains from seeds dropped randomly by the wind.


CUOMO PUTS DOWN NEW DRAFT EFFORT
LEAD: Governor Cuomo asked Westchester County Democrats today not to go forward with efforts to mount a drive to draft him as a Democratic Presidential candidate.


The Versatility of Color
LEAD: Most people would have the same reaction to a lime-green living room that Gelett Burgess had to the purple cow he immortalized in one of his poems: He had never seen one, nor did he hope to.
But according to a number of decorators and design experts, a creative approach to color -whether it's an unusual shade or merely an unusual placement - not only enlivens a room but maximizes its assets and minimizes its flaws.


Erskine Hawkins Blows Sweet Sounds in Catskills
LEAD: The ''20th-Century Gabriel'' is still blowing his horn, but he's making the scene these days in the Catskills, not Harlem.
He's the trumpeter Erskine Hawkins, for many years a fixture with his big band at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, and now a fixture with a small band at the Concord Hotel here, where he came for a one-week booking and decided to stay.

A brief report with the chart incompletely described the availability of rail passes.
They are available through travel agents.


By NEWGATE CALLENDAR
LEAD: Partly it's a parable, taking us from Eden to a problematic future.
Partly it's a social study about benevolent dictatorship.
It has a lot to do with human greed.
It's also a rattling good adventure story.
It is ISLAND by Thomas Perry (Putnam, $18.95), and whatever it is, it's wacky, imaginative, funny, serious and altogether different.

Does Steinbrenner Help or Hurt The Yanks?
LEAD: When I wear my Yankee cap, my friends ridicule me for rooting for the team George Steinbrenner owns.
He let Reggie go; hired Billy Martin (again), and sold so many games to pay television that people in Brooklyn have to follow the team on radio and in the papers or else forgo being fans.
He has hurt the team and the tradition so much I do not bleed pinstripes anymore.

A Chill Over the Hot New 'Hybrids'

Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts has built his small lead in the Democratic delegate race largely among the Democratic National Committee members, governors, Congressmen and other party leaders who go to the convention by virtue of their office or party title.


Does Steinbrenner Help or Hurt The Yanks?
LEAD: George Steinbrenner has little idea of the professionalism that has characterized the Yankees in better days.
His overweening ego has placed him on center stage instead of the players, and his lack of a world championship since the 70's is proof of his failure as a good leader.
NICHOLAS DEBORD


A Wee Union for Bargaining
LEAD: HERE'S a new setting for labor-management relations: an elementary school where sixth-graders and teachers negotiate the amount of homework assigned.
The school is Public School 38, the James F. Murray School, in Jersey City - and if the pupils abide by the bargain, completing all homework and classwork for five consecutive days, they earn a free period as well.


Cheeses With an Irish Accent
LEAD: IMAGINE that you are nearing the end of a Lucullan dinner at White's on the Green, one of the finest restaurants in Dublin.

LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  'NATION ON THE MOVE'


A 'Butterfly' That Hovers Over The Issues of Racism, Sexism And Imperialism
LEAD: IF YOU WANT TO BE TAKEN seriously as a playwright, the quickest way is to set up as a thinker.
Nothing is more calculated to make audiences assume a respectful expression than the suggestion that they are about to have some ideas dished out to them, and in a theater world that generally offers little in the way of intellectual nourishment, it is easy enough to see why.


Family Outing On a Slow Boat In the Midlands
LEAD: OUR family venture on the canals of England started innocently enough.
Years ago I had become fascinated with ''the river'' in ''The Wind in the Willows.'' Then, reading Jerome K. Jerome's ''Three Men in a Boat,'' an account of a week's boating holiday on the Thames in the late 1800's, during a visit with friends in London, I mentioned how nice it would be to explore the waterways.

The buoyant Soviet leader said the last deadlock - over a mutual Soviet and American cutoff of military supplies - had been broken, and Soviet troops might begin their trip home as early as May 15, ending one of the most troublesome legacies that Mr.


Harsh Words Fly
LEAD: Strong feelings that have festered below the surface at the Masters for years could no longer be contained by the somewhat artificial veneer of serenity, green jackets and lawn parties at the Augusta National Golf Club.

Patterns of Addiction

We went looking for an open pack.

McGwire Fed Up
LEAD: THE next time somebody throws a baseball at the head of Mark McGwire of Oakland, the American League rookie of the year last season, he had better do some ducking himself.

UNDER WRAPS
LEAD: UNWRAPPING A PACKAGE IS AT LEAST half the fun.
Break a shining crust with your fork, releasing a cloud of fragrance.
Slice through a casing of salmon or cabbage to reveal the savory contents within.

No matter the attack, the initial pleasure of food wrapped in edible packages is always the same, a present that holds a surprise.

New Jersey Guide
LEAD:  HOLOCAUST OBSERVANCES


FAREWELL, FRIEND
LEAD: Unlike the heartless editor in Russell Baker's farewell column, I shed genuine tears after reading Mr.
Baker's valedictory.
He made so many people smile, even laugh aloud, or, more remarkably, think seriously.
We admirers would phone one another to discuss and dissect with great joy and laughter his current column, or clip it out to send to distant friends and relatives.


True Bargains in Speakers
LEAD: A RECENT SURVEY REVEALS the somber fact that the average price of audio products has risen faster than the general cost of living, as gauged by the Consumer Price Index.

Sound Ideas
LEAD: A century ago, the novelist Edward Bellamy blithely predicted that by the year 2000 all human strife would be ended.

LAUGHTER AND HOPE
LEAD: I suspect that Dr.
Melvin Konner has unintentionally presented a distorted view of Bernie Siegel's work as described in his book ''Love, Medicine, and Miracles.'' Dr.
Siegel never suggests that conventional medical therapy be supplanted by any form of faith healing.
Rather, he depicts a humanistic therapeutic approach integrating imagery (psycho-) therapy with standard forms of medical treatment.


India
LEAD: To the Editor: It made interesting reading to go through ''Enfolding India in a Length of Cloth'' by Iris Ihde Frey (Shopper's World, Feb. 28), but the author mistakenly indicated that the spinning wheel is symbolically represented on the Indian national flag.
Actually, the wheel on the flag is a replica of the wheel of law from the lion capital (pedestal) erected by Emperor Ashoka in Sarnath in the third century B.C.

PARENTS AND TEACHERS: THE REAL GOALS
LEAD: I would like to respond to the article ''Fray at Southampton P.T.A.''  [ March 13 ] .
The National PTA and all its member units have specific objectives, and these objectives have nothing to do with cupcakes or insurance coverage or usurping authority.


Hard-Rock Commonplaces With a New Spin
LEAD: WHEN LATE-1980'S ROCK seems to be humorlessly high-minded, slickly synthetic, tiresomely pandering or so implacably conceptual it's just no fun, there's an alternative: Australia.
Heard from across the Pacific, against the background of American and British rock, Australian rock can sound like a wallaby of a different color; rowdy, guitar-driven, solid on the backbeat and tuneful, too.


PRESS IS TAKEN TO TASK ON IRRADIATION STORIES
LEAD: Recent articles about safety violations in the irradiation industry should alert the public to act on an issue which, although fital, has received less coverage than baseball or the sexual escapades of politicians and evangelical leaders.

Vegetable cookery is no longer the exclusive province of the counterculture.
It has become mainstream.


Does Steinbrenner Help or Hurt The Yanks?
LEAD: It is interesting that after Dave Winfield's book had been available for about a month, George Steinbrenner went public with his comments - a week or so before the Yankees' home opener.

Home Depot's Success Formula
LEAD: SHARES of Home Depot Inc., like virtually every other stock, crumbled in October's market crash.
Home Depot fell to $12.125 a share, from a peak of $28.
But unlike many stocks, Home Depot has sharply rebounded and was trading last week around $24.
Such strength is not unusual for the stock.
It jumped fourfold at the beginning of the 1980's bull market and, after giving back some of those gains, more than tripled between

A Democracy That Suits the Generals
LEAD: WITH a civilian serving as its President since 1985 and a freely elected Congress now close to completing work on a new Constitution, Brazil is routinely included among Latin America's ''new democracies.'' Brazilians, though, know different.
And last month, when the armed forces ruled yet again that the country was not ready for full democracy, any remaining doubts were dispelled:


Does Steinbrenner Help or Hurt The Yanks?
LEAD: The question is irrelevant.
Think back to the feuding Oakland A's of the early 70's and the swaggering Yankees of the late 70's.
Neither of these teams was enamored of their owner.
These guys are professionals and the bottom line is what they do between the white lines, not outside them.

This approach, rather than a shoot first, ask questions later method, is the safer one for gardeners to follow when controlling pests and diseases.


Gifts of Passage for the Graduate
LEAD: SCHOOL graduation is one of those rites of passage that begs for a gift.
A child's first graduation - from nursery school, becomes a big day in the short life of a 5-year-old -certainly deserving of a present.
Clearly, some graduations are more important than others. ''The younger the child, the smaller the occasion - and the gift,'' advised Judith Martin, author of ''Miss Manners' Guide to Rearing Perfect Children.


NEW YORKERS, Etc.
LEAD: SOME years ago an actress who was a client of Lionel Larner's gave him a gift.

POSTING: Farmers Market Jamaica; A Home At Last
LEAD: Since its formation 12 years ago, Farmers Market Jamaica has been pushed around quite a bit.

ISLANDERS AGAIN FALL TO DEVILS
LEAD: It was only appropriate that the spotlight, which escorted each member of the Devils onto the ice at the game's start, circled Sean Burke last and lingered with him longest.


DEALING WITH GORBACHEV
LEAD: Although I never voted for Richard Nixon and never, indeed, liked him, I found his article a superior piece of analysis - incisive, cogent, and terse.

LEAD: The Downtown Ensemble presented ''Graphic Music I'' - the first of two concerts devoted to music written pictorially rather than in standard notation - at the Greenwich House Music School (46 Barrow Street) on Thursday evening.

In One Room, Less Is More
LEAD: Visitors are graciously instructed to leave their shoes at the entrance to this L-shaped Manhattan studio because, as the tenant, Robert Homma, explains, ''I eat, sleep and live on one surface.'' Only by padding around in stocking feet and assiduously using a Dustbuster is he able to keep the 16 tatami mats that line the floor as clean as the day they were installed.


Designs for Two Kitchens
LEAD: In the 1920's and even earlier, the classic urban kitchen of the affluent was a large, dreary space where few family members ever made so much as a piece of toast themselves.
Often approached by a long butler's pantry, these rooms were designed in an era when the kitchen was considered a private place, off-limits to visitors.

Some Plain Talk and Advice About: Hemlines
LEAD: THIS MAY SEEM LIKE HERESY, BUT A hemline is not the be-all-and-end-all of fashion.
How much of your leg shows, or does not, is just one piece of the seasonal shifting around of stylish silhouettes.
It is just as important to watch what happens to your shoulders, your breasts, your waist - your shape in general.


An Emerging Theory on Blacks' I.Q. Scores
LEAD: MOST social scientists know - though few publicly discuss it - that there has been a puzzling gap of about 15 points in I.Q. test scores, on average, between blacks and whites in America ever since the tests were first widely used more than 70 years ago.
After long debate over why blacks score lower, and what it means, a fresh theory is putting the discussion into perspective.


Pop View; Wait a Minute, Mr. Postman: Sting Takes on His Critics
LEAD: STING IS AT IT AGAIN.
IN California recently, I came upon an arch letter the rock star had sent to The San Francisco Chronicle, complaining about a review of his recent Bay Area concert and challenging the critic to come up on stage at his next show and prove that he has the talent to entertain an arena-sized audience for 10 minutes.

On-the-Job Learning

LEAD: NONINDIFFERENT NATURE.
By Sergei Eisenstein.
Translated by Herbert Marshall. (Cambridge University, $37.50.)

The Race to Commercialize Substitutes

Marylyn I.

It has become mainstream.

Troops Patrol Honduran Capital
LEAD: Honduran soldiers handing out leaflets yesterday in Tegucigalpa asking parents to control rioting students.


DEALING WITH GORBACHEV
LEAD: In publishing Mr.
Nixon's article on Gorbachev, The Times shows clear hypocrisy.
The paper castigated Nixon throughout his political career, and now that his name is commercially valuable, it features him in its magazine.
I recognize that Nixon has plenty to gain -money and stature - for his piece in the magazine, but I would have thought The Times might cling to its principles, however misguided.

LEAD: A good many sins have been committed in dance in the name of postmodernist abstraction and ''body work,'' or dance drawn from now-popular physiotherapeutic techniques.

Advice From The Experts
LEAD: When top architects and designers were asked to pinpoint what they considered the most common design problems, the one they most frequently cited was the classic puzzle of inadequate space - rooms that are either just too small or those that are poorly proportioned.

Tickering Produces 'Fastest Street Car'
LEAD: LIFE can be slow in the shoreline community of Old Lyme, but that is not said about the car that comes out of Callaway Engineering in a small industrial park there.


Practical Traveler; Hotel Rankings: A Guide to Stars
LEAD: SYSTEMS used overseas for grading hotels with stars are not necessarily more helpful than the chaos that would result from adding up all the ratings in commercially published guidebooks and dividing by your shoe size.
The problem for the American traveler is that no set of criteria is universal.
One country's three-star might not cut the horseradish across the ocean, or even the river.


Striking Actors Reach A Tentative Contract
LEAD: A tentative settlement was reached yesterday in a strike by actors and actresses over pay for commercials that appear on cable television, a union official said.


Smalley Retires

LEAD: Among the reports in this issue:


Review/Opera; Ordinary Vampires, In One Act
LEAD: Golden Fleece Ltd. in 12 years of operation has presented nearly 60 new operas, most of them written and developed for the ensemble.
The latest three, heard Friday evening at the Sanford Meisner Theater (164 11th Avenue), are short - about 15 to 40 minutes - and are generally more in the nature of acting-workshop sketches with unambitious, functional music than operas in the familiar sense.

Premiere of Song Cycle To Be in Tarrytown
LEAD: BRTHDAY parties are often fun, but rarely do they also enrich the contemporary music legacy.
The 40th Anniversary Gala of the Sleepy Hollow Concert Association should do just that, however, because the celebration concert by the superb young baritone Christopher Trakas will feature the world premiere of a song cycle especially commissioned from Richard Hundley for the occasion.


POSTING: Where Roses Bloomed; 40 Town Houses for Tranquil Bayport
LEAD: Bayport, L.I., is not a resort, although Fire Island, just across the Great South Bay, is.
It is also not the most developed area on the South Shore, although Suffolk's largest downtown, Patchogue, and airport, Long Island-MacArthur, are nearby.
Founded by clammers and rose growers, Bayport has remained a quiet, year-round community off the Montauk Highway, not the Long Island


Keep Sports Agents Off the Campus
LEAD: ONE of college football's biggest problems is that of unscrupulous agents tampering with undergraduate athletes.


HOW BASEBALL'S TOP ROOKIES STACK UP
LEAD: The sheer, naked prospect that any new player may develop into Hall of Fame material has been enough to drive up the price of each year's rookie cards before the ink is dry.
As the season - and the seasons - unfold, most drop to the level of common players.
But while their careers are young and there is still even a remote prospect of stardom, their rookie cards sell at a premium.


The Ascent of Books on Decline of U.S.
LEAD: IT is unusual for an academic treatise to become a runaway best seller, but Paul Kennedy's ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' has been on the lists since February.

LEAD: There was indulgent laughter and a cry or two of ''yeah'' from the audience when the dancers of the Washington Ballet came forward for their curtain call at the end of ''La Fille Mal Gardee'' on Saturday at the Brooklyn Center at Brooklyn College.

Some of the passers-by were skeptical of the goods in such a handsome deal, and so, like others on the street selling everything from mink coats to snake oil to used toothbrushes, one had to hawk the goods, and, naturally, put as glossy a face on them as possible.

LEAD: On the last day of fall fashion openings yesterday, Geoffrey Beene drew a standing ovation from an audience of nearly 1,000 packed into the ballroom of the Hotel Pierre.

WHY I'M QUITTING THE SENATE
LEAD: THE SENATE CAMPAIGNS OF 1988, like the Democratic Presidential primaries, may well be remembered not so much for those candidates who ran, as for those who chose not to run.
Seldom have so many senators in midcareer chosen to call it quits.


TALL IS BETTER
LEAD: IF THERE IS A CONSTANT IN HUMAN nature it is a wild, irrational admiration for mere height.
Three thousand years ago the prophet Samuel - against his better judgment - let the people of Israel talk him into finding them a king.

We read of Saul that ''when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.

Who Will Indict The Indicters?
LEAD: INDICT IS A STRANGE verb; it looks as if it should rhyme with &gt;interdict.
The confusion is rooted in the Latin &gt;in- (''against'') and &gt;dictare (''to dictate, order''); to &gt;indict is to speak against, to accuse.
We would all be better off to spell it &gt;indite (as in ''to write''), but not even Noah Webster could straighten out English spelling.

Aside from the misery I felt at having 10 percent of my vacation wasted, my experiences were very positive.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. When we purchased our 40-year-old house about two years ago, we were told that a new roof had been installed about seven years before that.
Recently we had to rip off and replace the old gutters and found that the bottom wood edge of the roof was rotten, with pieces starting to fall off.
Does this mean we have to take off all the shingles, or can a partial job be done to correct this problem?


'La Cage aux Folles' in Darien

LEAD: A Marine Corps sergeant says he is certain that the ''40 to 50 unauthorized personnel'' with whom he and 100 comrades clashed at a fuel depot Tuesday night were intruders, not figments of the imagination or other American soldiers.


DESTINATION: MARS
LEAD: In his article, John Homans describes those of us who came of age in the 1960's as ''the generation that was going to change the world'' (italics mine).
This characterization is particularly ironic in light of the recent resignation of Elisabeth Ann Zinser from the presidency of Gallaudet University, after a week of student protests.


Using Technology Doesn't Mean Getting Seduced by It
LEAD: Go to Madison Square Garden for a concert, and you can expect big-budget theatrics: lasers and full-spectrum lights, ranks of keyboard and guitar electronics, truckloads of stage and sound equipment.
But some of the effects I've enjoyed most at recent performances suggest that - just in time - we may be in for a low-tech renaissance.

Managing Potential Presidents: Sketches of Key Campaign Staff Members

The quality, tone and style of a term in the White House depend not only on the President but on the aides who surround the chief executive and White House staffs and cabinets usually draw heavily from the people who surround the candidate who runs successfully for the office.

What's Doing In Buenos Aires
LEAD: In the waterfront neighborhood of La Boca, a narrow street called Garibaldi leads visitors into the Buenos Aires district that is synonymous with Argentina's big Italian immigration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In Separate Gestures, a Mosaic of Intentions
LEAD: THE principal actors in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict often reveal their true feelings and intentions through spontaneous, even subconscious gestures.
Sometimes they seem unaware of the implications of what they are doing, or that their acts may unintentionally subvert their goals.
In the past two weeks three such gestures have spoken volumes about the real state of the conflict today.


The Irreverence of Cocteau Sparkles Once More
LEAD: JEAN COCTEAU'S BALLETS, BY definition, set out to look as much unlike ballets as possible, and ''Les Maries de la Tour Eiffel (The Wedding on the Eiffel Tower),'' which was seen in a new version in New York last week, is no exception.

NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Christiana, Del.; The Menace From Below

WAITZ IS A WINNER AFTER 10 MONTHS OFF
LEAD: Her last race had been 10 months before so naturally, Grete Waitz had questions about her return to competition yesterday, in the 10-mile Trevira Twosome in Central Park.

Review/Jazz; Horvitz's Varied Idioms
LEAD: Wayne Horvitz, a keyboardist, is one of those downtown musicians who juggle a rock band, free-improvising outfits, collaborations with other composers and large-scale works of their own.


Headliners; Home From Prison
LEAD: Comdr.
Donal M. Billig may be nearly blind in one eye, and his record as a physician may be imperfect.

Dan Rather of New York.

Review/Music; Viola-Flute-Harp Trio
LEAD: The literature for viola, flute and harp is not enormous, and what there is of it tends more toward the lightweight than the edifying.
Yet trios of this constitution come together now and again, and when the chemistry is right, the results can be quite pleasant.
Paul Coletti, a violist; Marya Martin, a flutist, and Emily Mitchell, a harpist, have banded together as the Coletti-Martin-Mitchell Trio, and in their debut, Wednesday evening at the 92nd Street Y, they played with considerable polish and a lovely sense of collaborative give and take.

When a Stepfather Loses His 'Children'
LEAD: I REMEMBER my father bringing home wonderful strawberry tarts from work.
I was 6 at the time, it's one of the only memories I have of him, because he died in about that same period in my life.
But I was lucky.
It seemed my neighborhood had lots of men eager to ''step up'' and take on the job of role model.


Review/Dance; 'Roses' and 'Soup to Nuts,' by Paul Taylor Troupe

DESTINATION: MARS
LEAD: I am interested in the opinion of young people regarding space travel, because they will be tax-paying adults when and if a manned trip to Mars becomes a reality (''Destination: Mars,'' by John Noble Wilford, March 20).

IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: Goldbach's Conjecture; This One May Be Provable, but We May Never Know
LEAD: WHEN a Russian civil servant named Christian Goldbach sent a letter to the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1742, seeking advice about a maddeningly recalcitrant problem, he could hardly have imagined that more than two centuries later it would remain unsolved.


DESTINATION: MARS
LEAD: Perhaps the Soviet Union's true interest in the planet Mars is based on ideological considerations.
After all, Mars is known as the ''red'' planet, and if the Russians land there by 2017, it would coincide with the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. When we purchased our 40-year-old house about two years ago, we were told that a new roof had been installed about seven years before that.
Recently we had to rip off and replace the old gutters and found that the bottom wood edge of the roof was rotten, with pieces starting to fall off.
Does this mean we have to take off all the shingles, or can a partial job be done to correct this problem?

A LITTLE JOYFUL EXERCISE
LEAD: BABIES, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, spend a good deal of time kicking and gesturing wildly in the air.
All this fuss serves a good purpose other than the apparent one of commanding attention.
They're getting their exercise -something they also may receive by being bounced up and down on parents' knees or rocked back and forth to the beat of a song.


Flowers for Spring
LEAD: FERTILIZER is important for all plants, especially those that have dawdled; give them a boost with a general formula such as 5-10-5 or 10-10-10; trace a circle of it around the crowns.
Pull away winter mulches, but be careful if working around perennials and shrubs as many are shallow rooted.
Sow another half-row of radish, peas and spinach to keep harvest coming.

Home Run By Carter Spurs Mets

There are more than five months of a long arduous season ahead, and even in the best of times, Gary Carter has endured his share of foul tips, leaving welts on his body, and hitless nights.
In the spring of his 14th season, however, Carter is rejuvenated, feeling like The

LEAD: UPLIFT THE RACE: The Construction of ''School Daze.'' By Spike Lee with Lisa Jones. (Fireside/Simon &amp; Schuster, $9.95.) ''What is ''School Daze'' then?
Maybe it's just a Spike Lee Joint,'' muses the film maker in this fascinating account co-written with Lisa Jones, a second assistant director on the new film.


Broad Beans Herald Roman Spring
LEAD: THE markets and restaurants of Rome exhibit at this time of the year an explosion of fresh fruit and vegetables.
Small, tender, violet-colored artichokes, the long, slender stalks of wild asparagus, crisp puntarelle, a chicory-like green much favored for first-course salads, tiny, sweet peas called piselli romaneschi, the succulent, spinach-like vegetable called agretti.


Now, Apprentice Professionals
LEAD: WHEN people think of an apprentice, they generally think of a skilled craftsman, not an accountant.
But when Karin Vickers graduated from Hofstra University with a degree in accounting in 1986, she had a hard time finding a job in her field.
Rather than take a low-paying menial job, she turned to the apprentice system.


Going On in the Northeast
LEAD:  CHORAL CONCERT


HORNISTS EXPLORE MOZART CONCERTOS
LEAD: IN HIS HORN CONCERTOS, AS in the horn parts of all his works, Mozart wrote, of course, for the only available instrument of his time, the valveless ''natural horn,'' which could produce only overtones of its fundamental note.

Cool Jazz, Hot Jambalaya In New Orleans

TAKING CARE: ALLERGIES

Coping With Life Overseas
LEAD: FOR MANY young men and women serving overseas in the military, the drawbacks of life outside the United States, largely economic, are outnumbered by the benefits, including the chance to travel, learn new languages and experience diverse cultures.


Public Attitude Key to Ruling On Alcohol And Minors
LEAD: FOR a century, the Connecticut Supreme Court had held that a person who served liquor could not be held liable for the actions of the person who consumed it.
The reasoning was that someone became drunk not by being given alcohol, but by the voluntary act of drinking.
Last week, the court changed its mind.


Raid Fails to Find Fugitive Manila Coup Head
LEAD: Troops raided a hideout of the fugitive leader of August's attempted coup, the military said today.


If You Like Walking on Water
LEAD: FEW areas of human endeavor have eluded the fertile imaginations of inventors.
So there was no stir at the United States Patent Office last October when it announced the award of Patent 4,698,039 to Benjamin H. Watson of Renton, Wash., for equipment to let people walk on water.


In School, Facts Have Priority Over Fun
LEAD: The paradox examined by Cindy Econopouly Soehner  [ ''When Schooling Gets in Learning's Way,'' Opinion Page, March 27 ]  that ''to continue to enjoy learning,'' her son ''may just have to drop out of school'' resolves itself when we think that, despite the fact that medical doctors don't all cure us of every ailment, we do not drop out of medicine and become self-treaters.


CD Sonic Blockbusters With Fine Performances
LEAD: BACK IN THE DAYS OF analog recordings and vinyl pressings, an audiophile spectacular stood out from the pack either because it captured a performance with uncommon realism or because the range of timbres and dynamics was so broad that the disk could be used as a measure by which a stereo system might be judged.


Speakes: Product Of the System
LEAD: Everybody seems to be beating up on Larry Speakes for faking statements and attributing them to President Reagan, but Speakes is merely a symbol of a larger problem.
In fact, the confession in his ghost-written book that he was putting words in the President's mouth may be the only useful thing he did in the White


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. When we purchased our 40-year-old house about two years ago, we were told that a new roof had been installed about seven years before that.
Recently we had to rip off and replace the old gutters and found that the bottom wood edge of the roof was rotten, with pieces starting to fall off.
Does this mean we have to take off all the shingles, or can a partial job be done to correct this problem?


1948: Live . . . From Philadelphia . . . It's the National Conventions
LEAD: It is now 40 years since networks began live television coverage of political conventions.
Back in 1948 it took fewer than 300 journalists and technicians, and what they provided was carried by four networks to 18 stations in nine cities.
Although radio had never attempted it, television began with gavel-to-gavel coverage, not because it was noble, but because it was cheaper than providing entertainment from studios in New York.


U.S. Is Reportedly Weighing Retaliation for Mining of Gulf
LEAD: The Reagan Administration is weighing a possible military response to what officials view as a resurgence of Iranian mine laying in the Persian Gulf, officials said today.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:
HUNTINGTON 'JOURNEY'  If a little imagination goes a long way, just think of what more than 2,000 imaginations could accomplish.

Winter's Mantle Is Shed; Now It's Time for the Grime
LEAD: AH, SPRING, a time of rebirth and renewal.
Also a time of cleaning and mending.
And on scales grand and small, cleaning and mending - as well as hauling, painting and waxing (hot waxing at that) - are going on all across the state.


A TOP A TRAIN STATION, A BUILDING THAT IS RIGHT ON TRACK
LEAD: IT IS NOW 20 YEARS SINCE THE OPEN-ing of the ''new'' Pennsylvania Station in New York, that depressing maze of underground corridors pretending to be a train terminal.
This place would have been one of the more notable architectural disasters of the 20th century even if it had not required the demolition of the old Pennsylvania


THE LURE OF THE POLITICAL ROAD
LEAD: As a Presidential campaign veteran, I enjoyed reading John Homans's article ''The Lure of the Political Road'' (March 13).

THRICE-TOLD TALES
LEAD: Owen Edwards's ''Thrice-Told Tales'' certainly rings true.
If this letter is published, I am sure that in five years I will tell friends I had a short piece published in The Times; in 10 years I will boast of a major article; and I will tell my grandchildren that I was interviewed and written about the week after Russell Baker left.


For Anguilla, Tie to London Is Prosperity
LEAD: For six months, the Government of this little British possession in the Caribbean has been trying to find 11 good men or women who would like to become members of the Anguilla Police Force.


In the Hospital
LEAD: To the Editor: When I read Carlton Zucker's report of his stay in the Israeli hospital (''The Lessons of a Hospital Stay Abroad,'' Travel, Jan. 17), it evoked memories of my experience with Egyptian medicine during a tour that my wife, who is a physician, and I took last October.
While in Aswan, I fell getting off a bus.

Sports of The Times; Burke's Devilish Impact
LEAD: IN the frenzy of the final seconds, Sean Burke peered through his mask as Pat LaFontaine swooped in and shot.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: THE TALL DARK ALIBI.
By Carol Jerina. (Charter/Berkley, $3.95.) This slim, good-natured romp is a textbook example of television's indelible impact on the contemporary novel.
Perhaps Ms.
Jerina gives the game away when her heroine, a neophyte private eye, says that her work is ''more like 'Magnum' and 'Moonlighting' '' than the rumpled detective story of yesteryear.


It's a Good Time for Fresh Young Vegetables
LEAD: IT is no news that vegetables are at their best when young, and now - with the arrival of spring - the quality of produce in the market has dramatically improved.
Tiny carrots, baby zucchini complete with their flowers, asparagus ranging in size from pencil-thin to almost as thick as sugarcane, tender bulbs of

AMERIC'S RED ARMY
LEAD: THE GROUND TREMBLES IN THE HALF light of early morning as dozens of camouflaged tanks and troop carriers race by, their corrugated tracks criss-crossing the landscape.

LEAD: ASPHALT driveways suffer abuse in all seasons, but especially in early spring, when alternating freezes and thaws produce cracks, crumbled areas and potholes.
Luckily, most driveway damage is reasonably easy to repair.


Nurses, in Short Supply, Take Skills on the Road
LEAD: Susan Smith, a nurse in the operating room at University Hospital here, plans to spend spring on Long Island, summer and fall in New England and winter in Hawaii.

THE WILL TO STAY WELL

An Old-Fashioned Slam
LEAD: COMPARING the heroes of yesteryear with those of today is a popular nostalgic exercise, which is easy in some activities but difficult in others.

DESTINATION: MARS
LEAD: John Noble Wilford's article gave promise of a realistic view of solar-system exploration.

All that beautiful machinery on the surface of Mars, and all those people running around in their space suits -for what?


Outdoors; Fishing for Bass In Unusual Habitat
LEAD: IT was a peculiar setting in which to be going striped bass fishing.

EXPLORING THE FORCES OF SLEEP
LEAD: IT'S 2:30 IN THE MORNING, YOU'VE got a crucial interview during the day and you find yourself desperately thrashing in bed.

If this sounds familiar, relax, because the news from the world of science is good.

THE NEW MARITAL THERAPY
LEAD: In Martha Weinman Lear's article ''The New Marital Therapy'' (Body and Mind, March 6), one message that is being sent to couples in distress is ''let the buyer beware.'' Those of us who ''bought'' the 1970's ''self-actualizing'' theory can't ask for a refund!

The themes are big.

Leafs Blame Coach
LEAD: WHY did the Toronto Maple Leafs manage only 21 victories during the National Hockey League season?
According to two players, Miroslav Frycer and Borje Salming, it wasn't the players' fault.
The blame, they said, rests with Coach John Brophy.
Asserting that 90 percent of the players ''despise working for the coach,'' Frycer said he would not be playing for


SMOKING BAN NEAR ON FLIGHTS IN U.S.
LEAD: The no-smoking light will stay on for good starting Saturday on about 80 percent of the airline flights within the United States.

Out of the Cabaret, On to Broadway
LEAD: WHEN MICHAEL FEIN-stein makes the leap from cabaret to a one-man Broadway show this Tuesday, it is altogether fitting that the singer and pianist should have chosen the Lyceum Theater, on 45th Street east of Broadway, to make the move.


&gt;Firemen Try to Attract New Blood
LEAD: THE banner in front of the Syosset Fire Department reads, ''Fire Fighters Wanted: Help Us Help You.''


FOOD FACTS
LEAD: THE AMERICAN DIET IS CHANGING for the more exotic, and an increasing variety of foods is making its way to market, especially in ethnically diverse cities.

Frank J. Hoen Jr. of Glyndon, was married yesterday to Simon Benedict Wakefield, a son of Sir Peter and Lady Wakefield of Twickenham, Middlesex, England.


Correction
LEAD: A photograph with a March 13 review of the first volume of Vera Brodsky Lawrence's ''Strong on Music'' was published in error.

Texas Air Faces Official Inquiry
LEAD: Texas Air is facing a Government inquiry into its financial condition and its compliance with safety standards.

FORGET MURDER AND CAR CHASES: NOT IT'S 'SLICE OF LIFE' SHOWS
LEAD: IS THE TELEVISION PLOT DEAD?
IN the emerging strain of slice-of-life ''dramedies'' currently favored by the networks, nothing (in the dramatic sense) seems to happen anymore.
ABC's ''thirtysomething'' offers us life style writ large; a group of friends, their lives vaguely defined by a prior decade that could be the 60's or the 70's, kvetch their way through the business of middle-class life in the 1980's.


Washington Office an Asset to State
LEAD: TO A STRANGER in town, the State of New Jersey's Washington office, just down the street from the Capitol, looks much like that of a New Jersey Congressman's.

Crime
LEAD: It is the immediate future, and Congress is getting ready to pass a law permitting certain kinds of murder.
A powerful, clandestine group called the Hunt is behind it.
The members think legal murder will be the salvation of the free world. (Don't ask why; just read the book.) Another clandestine group, equally powerful, is made up of the best scientific brains in America, and it makes the Mafia look like the P.T.A.


An Elegant Spot for Expert Italian
LEAD: THE French may have a culinary beachhead in Greenwich, but the Italians have arrived with a challenger.
La Strada sets new standards of stylishness for Italian restaurants in Fairfield County, with elegant surroundings and a menu to match.

When a Principal Is a Publisher
LEAD: In his letter to the Long Island editor of March 20, a former school board member, Bernard Schmitz, states that the Hazelwood decision does not censor students' press rights because the principal who reviews the students' material is like the publisher of a private newspaper who has the right to decide what his paper will contain.


THE LITTLE NETWORK THAT COULD
LEAD: It was disappointing to see Ernest Leiser dismiss a fifth of CNN's programming as ''a couple of half-hour business-news shows'' (''The Little Network That Could,'' March 20).
But it is not surprising.
Broadcast network producers rarely understand business news, so they usually don't consider it worth coverage.


Attack on Chinese Reporter
LEAD: A Chinese television reporter was beaten by security guards while covering a flower show, a newspaper said today in a rare report on the activities of Chinese police.
Worker's Daily said Zhang Jianhua, a reporter for a television station in Henan Province, was in a park just before its annual peony show when four security guards surrounded and attacked him.


One Man's Milagro
LEAD: To the Editor:

Who Should Be Hockey's M.V.P.?
LEAD: With Wayne Gretzky being injured and the Oilers slipping, the race for the m.v.p. became wide open.
Steve Yzerman led his Red Wings to first place, but he too was hurt.
Sean Burke dominated games the way Ken Dryden and Bernie Parent did, but played in so few games.
So it comes down to two players who carried their talentless teams on their backs all year: Mario Lemieux and Denis Savard.


Review/Jazz; Art Songs In Popular Context
LEAD: Cassandra Wilson writes and sings deceptive, ambiguous music, tricking listeners into hearing the familiar where the familiar doesn't exist.
At her show at the Kraine Gallery (85 East Fourth Street) Tuesday night, where she helped start off a week-long series of new-music concerts, Ms.
Wilson latched on to the power of pop - good melodies, an assortment of rhythms and dance beats, songs and electronics - without sacrificing any of jazz's improvisational or musical power.


U.S. Officials Link Pakistan Blast to Kabul Regime
LEAD: One week after a major explosion at a Pakistani ammunition dump, Defense Department officials say that they believe that the explosion was the work of agents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul.

The Rev.


As Ozone Is Depleted, Much of Life Could Go With It
LEAD: THERE is scientific consensus now that certain industrial chemicals are destroying the atmosphere's protective ozone layer, leaving the earth and all the life upon it increasingly exposed to damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
But scientists remain largely in the dark about what effects that radiation will have on the earth's ecology.


Unions Hope to Flex Old-Time Political Muscle in Primary
LEAD: LABOR unions may have lost some of their bargaining and political clout in recent years, but they are an important element in the Rev.
Jesse Jackson's bid to win a plurality of the New York Democratic delegation.


The Candidates and the Middle East
LEAD: No national security question rings louder in the Presidential campaign than the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The Middle East may well be the most flammable place in the world.
So it's critical for voters to know how the next President proposes to prevent war there.
New Yorkers have served the nation well in pressing the candidates to spell out their positions in advance of Tuesday's

AIRLINE HIJACKERS THREATEN KILLINGS
LEAD: The hijacking of a Kuwaiti jet took a more threatening turn today when the men holding the airliner said they wanted to fly it elsewhere to ''liquidate our account'' with the Kuwaiti Government, which has refused to yield to their demand to free 17 convicted terrorists.


Adults Brave the Risks of the Stage
LEAD: ACTING is trusting, surrendering, caring.
Acting is listening, believing, feeling moved.


France's Shrinking Communist Presence
LEAD: ANDRE Lajoinie did not sound like someone who was leading the French Communist Party into a debacle of historic dimensions.
As 5,000 mostly working-class supporters roared on cue - whenever their presidential candidate raised his voice to a righteous shout - Mr.
Lajoinie lambasted the French right and predicted that the

A faction of the Red Brigades guerrilla group took responsibility for the killing.


A Fateful Choice
LEAD: Israel became a state on May 14, 1948.
A month later its Government faced a fateful issue.
Irgun Zvai Leumi, the right-wing terrorist group that had operated during British rule, tried to bring thousands of guns in on a chartered ship, the Altalena.


Pitted Against the Sky
LEAD: HE SAYS: ''THE WAY THE cherry throws itself into the air, it suggests a ship drawing up on shore.'' She says: ''The garden itself is very formalistic.
It reminds me of Versailles.
Louis XIV was known for the etiquette he enforced in the palace.
So the spoon and cherry kind of fit right in, as a parody of table manners.


RECEIVERS THAT FEIGN POWER
LEAD: THE BARGAIN HUNT goes on.
Rising prices of sound equipment make thrift a necessity as well as a virtue for growing numbers of listeners.
Following our initial foray into budget speakers last week, the spotlight now shifts to receivers in the same bracket.


THE GREAT COLLABORATOR
LEAD: A PRETTY RED BARN on the outskirts of a Connecticut village.
Inside, the decor is late 20th-century rustic: no trace of hay or horses, but plenty of hand-hewn beams, rough-hewn furniture and high-end electronics, whose video components tap into the global village via a satellite dish on the lawn.


Kanzaburo Nakamura, Kabuki Actor, 78
LEAD: Kanzaburo Nakamura, a leading kabuki actor and recipient of cultural awards from the Japanese Government, died following a heart attack today, people in the kabuki world reported.

24-Karat Principals
LEAD: Most teen-agers would rather be caught dead than dowdy.
But one trend among some New York City high school students, the wearing of flashy gold jewelry, may be deadly.


Jury Advised on Recantation in Mob Murder Trial
LEAD: The judge in the trial of three reputed Mafia figures charged with killing a New York City police detective told the jurors yesterday that they had to decide whether to believe the recanted testimony of a prosecution witness.


The Theme of Patriotism From Foreign Lands
LEAD: DESPITE the weakening of the dollar and its impact on imports, a flood of new issues from foreign lands continues.
In most instances the themes are selected for their relevance to the issuing nation.
There also are instances in which they clearly are selected for their appeal to United States collectors.


Former Foster Child Tells Panel of Five Lost Years
LEAD: One ''mother'' struck him and threw him in hot water, the 12-year-old boy recalled.
Another spoke only in a language he did not understand.
And when it was time to say goodbye after a visit with his real mother, he felt ''like the world was leaving me.''


THIS AMERICAN IN PARIS KEPT TRUE TO NEW YORK
LEAD: WHEN CRITICAL ENTHU-siasm for Abstract Expressionism waned during the 1960's, Joan Mitchell was among the painters whose reputations suffered most.
She moved permanently to France in 1968 but pursued the path she had carved out in Manhattan during the early 50's - a path that drew inspiration from the works of de Kooning, Pollock and other members of the New York

Business of Providing Crime Protection

Court Rules U.S. Was Wrong To Deny Visa to Mrs. Allende

Almost-Vegetarian Meals
LEAD: ''WE ALMOST NEVER EAT RED meat anymore.'' It's a statement you hear frequently these days, and statistics bear it out: Per capita, Americans are eating less red meat than they were a decade ago.


Corrections
LEAD: A graphic last Sunday with an article on New York banks incorrectly stated the 1986 net income of the Chemical New York Corporation.
It earned $402.4 million.


Film on Richard
LEAD: HIS major-league career came to a sudden end when he suffered a stroke in 1980, but J. R. Richard, the former Houston Astros pitcher, is looking forward to a comeback of sorts, and a resurrection of the glory days when he was one of the leading pitchers.


A Better Team Defense Against Drugs
LEAD: IN December 1985, Walter Davis, the star guard for the Phoenix Suns, stepped forward to ask for help in dealing with an addiction to cocaine and alcohol.
As shocking a revelation as that announcement was, within 18 months, the Davis case would grow into a nationally publicized investigation of drug use among present and former players, sending shock waves throughout Phoenix and the National Basketball


Old Friends Gather In Chamber Series
LEAD: IT should be a happy New York Philharmonic reunion in Salisbury this afternoon, when the Harvey String Quartet, the resident ensemble of the Chamber Music at St.
John's series, greets its guest artist, the noted flutist Julius Baker.


Strange Season at the Met
LEAD: THE METROPOLITAN OPERA IS A LARGE, IN-tricate machine with as many working parts as a cuckoo clock.
Yes, it strikes the wrong hour with depressing regularity, but an organization that puts on 110 performances of 22 operas in a season cannot help doing something right, can it?
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day, horological wisdom reminds us.


VARIANTS ON JAZZ ECLECTICISM
LEAD: LURKING IN PRESS RELEASES, interviews and concert programs, composers' influences spring at unsuspecting readers.
From John Zorn to the minimalists, from Henry Threadgill to the Talking Heads to the WBLS rap disk jockey Marley Marl, musical collage and cultural borrowing are on a rampage.
Pieces sound as if they've been written by roaming record collections instead of musicians.


A Reader's Garden Of Earthly Delight
LEAD: WHEN I was growing up, Orthodox Jewish on the edge of Harlem in the 1940's, the public library was my tree house, my backyard, my playground.
It was there that I was free to be me.
Outside the library, much was forbidden - churches, Christmas, Easter, strangers, bike riding, bacon, ham and household pets.


Difficutl Repertoire Performed by Students
LEAD: THE Westchester Conservatory Orchestra is a largely student ensemble, but it certainly tackles adult repertoire.
Today at 3 P.M., the program at Sarah Lawrence College lists Schubert's C major Symphony (which lost its projected premiere in 1826 when the orchestra pronounced it too long and difficult to learn), and a Mozart premiere, arranged by Richard


Kati Johnston, Producer, Is Wed To Stewart Russell

New York Gets a Chance to Make a Difference

LEAD: Anne Paton, at center with hat, the author's wife, and Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi, right, chief minister of KwaZulu, at service in Pietermartizburg, near Durban.

The bride, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

RUSH HOUR ON THE NAUTILUS
LEAD: SOME THINGS NEAL REED KNOWS about his clients: Carol Rigby can eat a pint of vanilla Haagen-Dazs in one sitting.
Joy Toboroff wishes her thighs, which are not at all fat, were thinner.
Frank Stella, who bends over when he paints, gets pains in his neck.
Paul Kessel worries about losing his flexibility - and his golf swing - as the years advance.

Penguin Repertory Offers ''The Immigrant''

School Role Ill-Advised For Business Managers

The results of this educational debacle are well established in the historical record.


Who Should Be Hockey's M.V.P.?
LEAD: It would appear that Mario Lemieux of the Penguins is a shoo-in for the award.
I'm here to tell you it ain't so.
Give the scoring trophy to Lemieux with all the accolades of being the top scorer, but please don't assume that he will also walk off with the m.v.p.


Guterman's Troubles Jolt Client Co-ops
LEAD: AT least 36 New York City co-ops were forced to find new managing agents and sue to recover records and bank balances after the management division of The Hanover Companies, a real estate development company headed by Gerald Guterman, the financially troubled real estate developer-converter, began falling apart along with a number of his other ventures.


Olympic Profiles: Tim Daggett; Gymnast's Scars Spurring Him On

WESTCHESTER GUIDE
LEAD:  'DEER AND PEOPLE'  A workshop on ''White-Tail Deer and People: How Do We Co-Exist?'' will explore methods of controlling the expanding deer population.
The workshop is scheduled from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M.
Saturday at the Teatown Lake Reservation on Spring Valley Road in Ossining.
Widespread development has squeezed the animals into ''habitat islands,'' or small areas where a shortage of food forces them to forage on private property.


THE LITTLE NETWORK THAT COULD
LEAD: The White House, Pentagon, State Department and television networks are not the only places that the early-alert value of Cable News Network is appreciated.
CNN is a constant background companion in our daily newsroom at The Detroit News.


It's a Good Time for Fresh Young Vegetables
LEAD: IT is no news that vegetables are at their best when young, and now - with the arrival of spring - the quality of produce in the market has dramatically improved.
Tiny carrots, baby zucchini complete with their flowers, asparagus ranging in size from pencil-thin to almost as thick as sugarcane, tender bulbs of Florentine fennel and beautiful ivory-white heads of cauliflower are just some of the many choices.


IN QUOTES
LEAD: ''You get better odds in Las Vegas.'' - Representative J.J.
Pickle, Democrat of Texas, on the 38 percent error rate in I.R.S. responses to taxpayers.


Hundreds in Panama Protest Noriega Regime
LEAD: Hundreds of protesters smashed windows, blocked streets with flaming barricades and clashed with riot police today in a demonstration demanding the removal of the military leader, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The police fired tear gas and birdshot as about 400 demonstrators, mostly members of a women's group, rallied on the north side of the capital.


Installing a Dishwasher in 77 Days
LEAD: IF you are tired of consumer complaint stories like the one about the woman who kept being dunned for $00.00 and escaped court action only by sending a check for that amount, then don't read this.
But if you want to learn how to take 11 weeks to install a dishwasher, this is for you.
David Niven, you will recall, took just three days more to go around the world.


Debbie Lalin Plans to Wed David Finkel in September
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Charles H. Lalin of Rockaway, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Debbie S. Lalin, to David A. Finkel, the son of Dr. and Mrs.

A September wedding is planned.


Rome
LEAD: To the Editor: ''The Food of the Roman Ghetto'' by Diane Weathers (Fare of the Country, Feb. 28) made a cryptic - and somewhat ominous -reference to ''handsome carabinieri toting M-12 machine guns,'' presumably to guard the area's synagogue.
Can you elicit from Ms.
Weathers something more about what lies behind this statement?


Review/Dance; Muller Group Plays 'Hide And Seek'
LEAD: Children's games are often cruel, and adults can be childish game-players.
That was made clear in ''Hide and Seek,'' which Lynne Taylor-Corbett created as guest choreographer for Jennifer Muller's company, Jennifer Muller/The Works.


Review/Music; 'Serenade,' Britten's Six-Song Cycle
LEAD: Benjamin Britten's ''Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings'' is one of the most nearly perfect song cycles in existence: its beauties are immediately apparent yet familiarity deepens them; the poems are great ones and faithfully treated, but they do not overshadow the music; the six songs are wonderfully contrasted yet there are unforced links, and the balance among them is perfect, with nothing essential unsaid and nothing superfluously repeated.


THE IGNOMINIOUS ITCH
LEAD: SCRATCHING THE ITCH OF SUNBURN or poison ivy grants not just relief but pleasure - sometimes exquisite pleasure, rivaling that of good food or good sex.
The medical term for itch, pruritus, comes from the same Latin root as prurient, and psychiatrists have long interpreted itching in sexual terms.


Democrats Prepare for Decisive Primary
LEAD: WITH considerably less fanfare, more Democrats are expected to vote in Tuesday's primary on Long Island than voted in New Hampshire earlier this year at the beginning of the campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination.


Close Scrutiny, More Balk Calls Give Some Players Pause
LEAD: DOUG JONES, a Cleveland Indians relief pitcher, did it with the bases loaded in the eighth inning and the game tied, 6-6, and the Minnesota Twins won, 7-6.
Les Lancaster, a Chicago Cubs reliever, did it with runners at first and second in the seventh inning and the game tied, 3-3, and Bob Horner hit a sacrifice fly that gave St.


That's Melanie Griffith Everywhere
LEAD: ON A BLEAK SPRING AFTER-noon, Melanie Griffith sits in her cozy trailer munching on a multicolored salad and surveying the Irving Place strollers outside her window.
She is wearing the de rigueur costume of the day - a tasteful tan business suit - and her short blond locks perfectly frame her face.


Will the Trade Gap Grow?
LEAD: The announcement of February's $13.8 billion trade deficit - the largest in six months - sent a shock through the economy.
The stock market fell sharply and the dollar dropped too.
How should the trade figures for February be understood?
Are they part of a trend, or just an aberration?
Carl B.


A Walk on the Weird Side in L.A.
LEAD: YOU'VE all had your little laugh at the weirdness of Los Angeles.
You think you're an authority on the subject, just because you've strolled past the Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard, gawked at the ersatz canals in our beachside version of Venice or giggled at Forest Lawn's ''authentic'' reproduction of Michelangelo's ''David,'' complete with a push-button activated, tape-recorded dramatization of the battle between David and Goliath.


Tribute to Craig
LEAD: THINGS haven't been the same in Easton, Mass., since Donald Craig died earlier this year.

'Steamroller and Violin,' Tarkovsky's Earliest
''The Steamroller and the Violin,'' which opens the Andrei Tarkovsky retrospective at Film Forum 2 today, is in a much lighter mood than the works for which the Soviet director is celebrated.
Mr.
Tarkovsky, who died in 1986, was known for powerful, sometimes violent images and big, sometimes mystical symbols.
This very early work, made in 1960 during his final year at the Moscow Film Institute and not shown in New York until now, is a small story told through the eyes of a small boy.
The focus is on a few hours that Sasha, a 7-year-old violin student, spends in the company of a steamroller driver named Sergei.
Sasha, though spunky, is a privileged child who is picked on by the rougher kids in his apartment house.
Sergei, who comes to his defense and lets him operate the steamroller, seems a sort of hero, a stand-in perhaps for the father who never appears.
To Sergei, we sense, the boy represents a future that is beyond a mere worker.

Review/Dance; Balanchine's Stravinsky, With Feeling
LEAD: Dance companies often take time to settle into new seasons, and it looked as if the American Ballet Theater was doing that in two performances on Thursday at the Metropolitan Opera House.

Time for the Windfall Tax to Fall
LEAD: Do American oil producers deserve ''windfall'' profits?
It was a resentful question when Americans waited two hours in gasoline lines and Saudi princes summered in Monaco.

Review/Film; A First Feature, With a Bounty Hunter
LEAD: ''The Blue Iguana,'' which opened yesterday at the Cinema 2 and other theaters, belongs to that genre of first feature most favored by film-school graduates.
It's inspired not by life but by other movies.
Whatever passion it possesses is the film maker's desire to make movies - any movies - before he has much of anything in mind to make movies about.


Reagan Again Backs Meese, Saying He Should Not Quit
LEAD: President Reagan said today that Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d should not resign.

Puerto Vallarta
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Puerto Vallarta Losing a Hotel'' (Travel Advisory, March 13) was of great interest to those of us who knew and loved the hotel years before John Houston filmed ''The Night of the Iguana'' and put the sleepy little fishing town on the tourist map.
Your report that the Oceano Hotel has surrendered to condominium builders needs some updating, though.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: STORIES: Five Acre Virgin and The Travelling Entertainer.
By Elizabeth Jolley. (Viking, $17.95.) Reading Elizabeth Jolley is a bit like listening to your favorite grandmother, the one who is wise and funny and a little bit demented, the one who keeps track of all the cousins and can see all of human nature in a family reunion or a day at the beach.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Headliners; Off the Hot Seat

Last summer, I bought the vouchers, but upon using them in Finland, I had to pay a 50 percent surcharge to occupy a single room.
The rooms had a single bed.
I was not occupying a double room, on which a surcharge might have been appropriate.


Review/Theater; Childhood Memories Of a Long-Gone World
LEAD: Larry Cohen's memory play, ''Washington Heights,'' revisits a world that will seem very familiar to anyone who has already savored Neil Simon's ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' and Woody Allen's ''Radio Days.'' Once again, it is the eve of World War II.

Film; Where the Action Was
LEAD: IT IS AN EXERCISE IN ARCHEOLOGY, the act of viewing the films that Andy Warhol made in the 1960's.
It summons up more than the ghosts of cinematheques, lofts, college auditoriums and other vaguely remembered spaces.
For those who saw these films way back when, it is a ride on a time machine to revisit the land of 60's dreams and nightmares.

LEAD: Neil Young was playing with the blues when he came to the World last week.

With the release of his album ''This Note's for You,'' he brought his band, the Blue Notes, including a six-man horn section, to the World for four barely publicized club dates rather than a large New York concert.

THE HIGH COST OF THINNESS
LEAD: Ms.
Henig's assertion that liposuction surgery ''most often requires an overnight hospital stay,'' is not supported by my own experience nor that of many other plastic surgeons.

WHEN THE PUTTING GOES BAD
LEAD: At 38, Tom Watson is no longer a golf prodigy (''When the Putting Goes Bad,'' by Peter de Jonge, March 13).
However, he may be encouraged to recall that Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus were still winning major titles past the age of 40, and Lee Trevino won his second P.G.A.
Championship in 1984, when he was 44, 10 years after his first P.G.A.

The Milliners' Tale
LEAD: ''THE BRITISH ARE GREAT AT THINGS LIKE breakfast and Rolls-Royces,'' says David Shilling. ''And hatmaking.'' Not surprisingly, Shilling is a British hatmaker. ''Designer, actually,'' he says.

For Dukakis Campaign, the Money Keeps Rolling In
LEAD: When critics make much of the millions of dollars fueling his Presidential campaign, Michael S. Dukakis gets uncharacteristically ruffled.

POSTINGS: New Jersey Law; Now Co-ops Need a Deed
LEAD: Buyers of New Jersey cooperative apartments created on or after May 9 must be given a deed along with the bill of sale.

Give Illegal Aliens More Time
LEAD: The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided amnesty for the estimated 1.4 million to 2 million undocumented aliens who have been in the United States since before 1982.
But with the May 4 deadline less than two weeks away, only 1.2 million have applied.
Fairness justifies an extension.


Marathon Running Is Alive And Well
LEAD: REPORTS of the death of distance and marathon running are greatly exaggerated.
Long Island has the proud distinction of showing this to be so.


Oxford Versus Thatcher's England
LEAD: ''OXFORD!'' CRIED THE CONDUCTOR. ''Oxford is next.'' I peered through the dirty window, hoping for a glimpse of the fabled spires, but all I saw were giant cranes looming against the sky.

There was construction everywhere: car parks, concrete office blocks, a new shopping mall on Queen Street.

LEAD: WHEN ASKED WHERE HE would go to record a massive classical work - Mahler's ''Symphony of a Thousand,'' for instance, or a Wagner opera - provided he had to remain in New York City, the veteran producer Max Wilcox refused to play along.

IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester; Texas Developer Thinks Big on Rentals
LEAD: A TEXAS development company is providing something that is in great demand but short supply in Connecticut - sensibly priced apartments for rent.
The company, Trammell Crow of Dallas, the nation's largest developer with assets of $13 billion, recently set up a regional office in New Canaan from which it is directing the construction of about 3,000 apartments, some already built and occupied, some under way and others on the drawing board.


Exterior Paint Problems
LEAD: BLISTERING and peeling are perhaps the two most noticeable signs of deteriorated exterior house paint.

Getting Medical Help When You're Overseas
LEAD: WHEN a vacationer is taken sick or injured overseas, there may not be anyone around who speaks English well enough to grasp what the complaint is and advise on getting help.

Propping Up the S.&amp;L.'s
LEAD: Troubles in the savings and loan industry continue to multiply.
Hundreds of savings and loan associations, mostly in the oil belt, are insolvent.

CRIME
LEAD: Tuthill Willow, the private eye in DEATH WORE GLOVES by Ross H. Spencer (Donald I. Fine, $17.95), is approached by a nun who wants him to locate her missing niece, a model.
This nun is not your everyday variety of nun.
She is in a permanent alcoholic fog, and her language would bring a blush even to men in an army barracks.


Reagan Disproves A Lame-Duck Myth
LEAD: Some good news.
In several important areas, the Administration is dispelling the myth that a President, especially a lame duck, cannot make foreign policy progress in an election year.
Moreover, by offering President Reagan explicit or implicit support in those areas, the Democrats may be contributing to a selective bipartisanship that could serve the nation very well in the years ahead.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. The nearly flat roof on my ranch house has no provision for ventilation.
Roofers have told me the lack of air circulation makes rot a strong possibility.
I have been able to look inside this confined roof space but have seen nothing unusual.

Licensing for Fun and Profit - and Free Exposure
LEAD: TWO decades ago Andy Warhol turned a soup can into a work of art, but corporate logos and trademarks were not valued in their own right by the public until about three years ago.
Today consumers can't get enough Coca-Cola T-shirts and Spuds MacKenzie dolls, and corporations are turning to licensing specialists to supply the demand.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  FUNNY SAUCE, by Delia Ephron. (Penguin, $3.95.) With all the messy entanglements caused by divorce, remarriage and joint custody, the humorist Delia Ephron writes, the term ''extended family'' now often applies to a mismatched group of mostly unrelated people who are forced to tolerate one another's existence.


Planner's Proposals Miss the Mark
LEAD: On its surface, the interview with David Emilita  [ ''A Planner Balances Quantity and Quality,'' March 20 ]  would appear to warrant serious thought.
Unfortunately, the proposals Mr.

More Co-op Owners Battling Their Boards
LEAD: KENNETH ROSENBLUM, a Manhattan lawyer, said the difficulties with his co-op board started with a leak in the ceiling of his living room.

THE HEALTH-CARE CHAOS
LEAD: Documenting and eliminating waste in the health-care system will be a difficult task.
It is not even clear that waste can be defined adequately.
Is it wasteful for Medicare to spend a large proportion of its funds on acute care of the elderly who are in their last year of life while access to prenatal care for women on Medicaid is severely limited?


Gurkhas Kill 2 Communists
LEAD: Gurkha militants kidnapped and beheaded two members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the police said today.

Why Not Maintain Public Land?

The monthlong, citywide celebration of the performing arts opens on June 11, just two years after the 71-year-old Segal resigned as chairman of Lincoln


NORTHEAST JOURNAL
LEAD:  Like Father, Like Son


TREASURE HUNTS
LEAD: Visiting the city's auction houses can be as enjoyable and educational as perusing works in a museum or art gallery.
In some ways even better.
There aren't any admission fees.
Art and objects can be viewed at close proximity and experts are on hand to discuss them and to answer questions.
Shoppers with a hankering to try on a giant diamond brooch, inspect the inner workings of a clock or open every drawer of a desk may do so, in most houses.


When Mud Season Arrives, Life Bogs Down
LEAD: While most states struggle along with just four seasons, Vermont enjoys six: spring, summer, fall, winter, more winter and mud.


Art; So, Mate, You Want to Know What's New in Australian Art?
LEAD: CONTRARY TO IMPRESSIONS OF Australia conjured up by the tourist campaigns, Australian culture is a mixed palette of artistic visions and gritty urban scenes.

Kilda, situated on one of Melbourne's sunny downtown beaches, is the one with the greatest number of artistic associations, embodying all the contradictions of Australian urban life.

Runners Aiming For Gold, Cash
LEAD: America's elite marathoners have received their share of criticism the last few days.
Nine runners from six other countries have covered the 26-mile 385-yard distance in less than 2 hours 10 minutes, and not once in the last five years has an American run it that fast.


Who Will Win the Kentucky Derby?
LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.

Emelin's Many Facets
LEAD: MENTION a season at Mamaroneck's Emelin Theater for the Performing Arts and what comes to mind?
It could be the foreign films (on seven Fridays), the chamber music recitals (five Saturdays) or the prominent lecturers (four Wednesdays).
Or perhaps ''Super Stuff for Kids,'' which includes 14 different shows on weekend mornings and afternoons.


Improvements: Cease and Desist
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


A GREAT DEAL OFFERS OCCASIONS FOR BRILLIANCE
LEAD: FEW players appreciate the vast organization that underlies a major tournament.
In the recent Spring Nationals in Buffalo, for example, there were 40 directors, 50 caddies and a bunch of assorted officials and journalists.


SCIENCE FICTION
LEAD: As recently as the early 1960's, new science fiction meant short fiction.
Except for an occasional novel marketed as something else, new s.f. appeared mostly in monthly magazines where the longest stories were chopped into three or four parts for serialization.
Only when paperback books displaced magazines as the principal outlet for new science fiction did the novel replace the short story as the genre's standard narrative form.


Miss Findlay Is to Be Wed
LEAD: The engagement of Kimberly Wrede Findlay to Jonathan Bostwick Davis, the son of Dr.
E.

Sports of The Times; Yankees' Version of The Natural Is 3-0

Five people were reported killed and 15 wounded.


Correction
LEAD: An article in The Times Magazine on April 10 about Abel Aganbegyan, Mikhail Gorbachev's economic adviser, misstated the price set by the Russians for a metric ton of oil for military use.

Reagan Predicts Victory on Veto of Trade Bill
LEAD: President Reagan, who has steadfastly opposed the comprehensive trade bill that is scheduled for a vote in the Senate Tuesday, predicted today that his veto will be sustained.


Headliners; Under Discussion
LEAD: Clearly, Fidel Castro and John Cardinal O'Connor had a lot to talk about.

Castro's forces overthrew the Batista Government nearly 30 years ago, met with the Cuban President into the wee hours one morning for what the prelate described as discussions of church-state relations.


U.S.-Iran Gulf Battle: Powerful Lesson in How Naval Warfare Has Changed
LEAD: Although a minor engagement by World War II standards, the Persian Gulf battle last week was the most significant American naval surface action since the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines in 1944 and underscored the accuracy and destructiveness of modern high-technology weapons.


Mob Suspect Held in Slaying on Manhattan Street
LEAD: A man killed another on Friday afternoon as the two strolled down a busy street in the East Village, and the police believe the suspect is an organized-crime figure who testified against two associates in a 1978 murder trial.


Correction
LEAD: In last week's Chess column, Black's 35th move should have read N-B3.


Manhattan Rabbi Celebrates 25 Years on a Different Path
LEAD: A remark by a Soviet official 22 years ago that ''religion is for old people'' vexed Rabbi Arthur Schneier, then the young leader of the Park East Synagogue, in a broadly political and deeply personal way.


New Stamps, New Shmamps!
LEAD: AS someone who remembers the days of the penny postcard and the 3-cent letter, and who also remembers when 25 cents could send me to the movies for an entire afternoon, or send me on five uneventful subway rides, I am shocked - no, horrified -to learn that this once princely sum of money now sends no more than a skinny little letter on a trip through the mail.


Yucatan
LEAD: To the Editor: My husband and I recently returned from two months in the Yucatan Peninsula and so read Elizabeth Benedict's article on Kailuum with amusement and disbelief.

They wound up with the same old result - a defeat, their 17th straight since the start of the season.


The Editorial Notebook; Chinese Reformers, Soviet Upstarts
LEAD: Western analysts talk of reform, Soviet and Chinese, in one breath.
Not the Chinese.
They've been at this reform business for a decade.
They see the Russians as upstarts with greater problems and more entrenched habits.
Indeed, the traveler to China is struck by an economic vitality and consumerism beyond Moscow's dreams.


From a Safe Haven, Charting a Course through Past and Future
LEAD: ''THE LAST SPRING,'' by Grieg, ended just as I came to a stop only yards from the water on the north shore of Gardiners Bay.
My mood was anything but elegiac.
I switched off the radio, deepening the silence of the empty beach (it was early April), and admired the view that had been an almost unchanging part of my summertime life since boyhood.


Settling the Score
LEAD: AN ORCHESTRAL PERFORMANCE IS the result of hours of rehearsal preceded by a month or a lifetime of preparation.

Watch Out for the Market Data Glut
LEAD: CAN too much of a good thing be bad?
Absolutely - as marketing executives are finding out.
The amount of data available to them is increasing at a pace that will defy their capacity to assimilate it.
And over the next decade, the data directed at a typical brand manager at a packaged goods company could jump from several hundred thousand new numbers a month to billions a day.


Review/Guitar; Artist Bridges Two Styles
LEAD: The guitar is a common denominator between popular and concert music, so, appropriately, Douglas Niedt's evening at Weill Recital Hall on Friday went back and forth between the two.
At one pole in his program were familiar items by Tarrega, Turina and Villa-Lobos.
At the other were placed arrangements of Paul Desmond and Dave Brubeck, with Richard Rogers's ''Lover'' and ''Laura'' by David Raksin alongside them.


Our Muscle-Bound Navy
LEAD: THE NOISY RESIGNATION of Navy Secretary James H. Webb Jr., on Feb. 22, throws into sharp relief the growing controversy over the expensive naval buildup launched by the Reagan Administration.
With its stated objective of deploying a ''600-ship'' Navy by 1989, the buildup represents, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Caspar W.

Exterior Paint Problems
LEAD: BLISTERING and peeling are perhaps the two most noticeable signs of deteriorated exterior house paint.
Their causes can also be among the most difficult to pinpoint and remedy.
However, whether you intend to repaint your house or only make spot repairs, take time to analyze areas of deteriorated paint and eliminate their causes before mending them.


THE K.G.B. AND ME
LEAD: Your Moscow bureau chief, Philip Taubman, seems puzzled by the degree of surveillance accorded him by the K.G.B. (''The K.G.B. and Me,'' March 6).
As a former intelligence officer, I can assure him that intelligence bureaucracies, regardless of nationality, have one sacred purpose - to expand the T.O.

LEAD: LIKE many urban areas, this sprawling city in southeastern Tennessee is developing condominiums, shops and parks on its waterfront.


After Taking the Oath of Secrecy, It's Magic on a Smaller Scale
LEAD: ONSTAGE at parties, weddings and special events, the magician Sandini -otherwise known as Michael J. Piacente of Yonkers - is a master of the dramatic effect.
Doves materialize at his command, and the straps and clasps of straitjackets mysteriously give way.


POSTINGS: New State Forms; Renewing A Lease
LEAD: Beginning next Sunday, rent-stabilized tenants whose leases are expiring will receive new state-mandated lease-renewal forms.

THE HIGH COST OF THINNESS
LEAD: Congratulations to Robin Marantz Henig on her coverage of the popular liposuction surgery.
It would be interesting to study the statistics concerning the gender of these patients.
How many men, I wonder, are so inclined to run serious health risks and pay outrageous sums of money for a narrower appearance?


Homelessness: A Need For 'Community' And Basic Comforts
LEAD: TRAFFIC on the highway had slowed to a halt.
My friend and I had hoped a quick trip into Manhattan would break the monotony of another gray, cold winter day.
As I sat humming to the radio, a flash of light caught my eye from the opposite side of the road.


George St. Offers 'Rappaport'
LEAD: HAVING been perplexed by one oddity after another, a sex-reversed ''King Lear'' being the oddest of all, and then jolted by ''Tracers,'' a graphic piece about the Vietnam War, George Street Playhouse audiences can now be taken in by ''I'm Not Rappaport,'' a play that appears rigged for safety and endearment.


Editor of the Letters Tests Limits
LEAD: The tiny office is submerged in stacks of readers' letters, one day's worth of mail piled precariously on the desks and spilling onto the floor.
The small staff of Ogonyok, the brash weekly magazine, is inundated by an outpouring of newly voiced passions from the Soviet people.


Review/Rock; A Straightforward Brand Of Music, From the Alarm
LEAD: Part of the way through the Alarm's sold-out show at the Beacon Theater on Wednesday night, its lead singer, Mike Peters, risking his clothes if not his life, wandered out into the audience.

I will fight those songs with every ounce of breath in my body.


Let Shadow Cabinets Join in the Debate
LEAD: To the Editor:


'Sweet Charity' on Stage at Cabaret in Bridgeport
LEAD: ''SWEET CHARITY'' isn't one of the American theater's landmark musicals, but if the current drought in homegrown song and dance shows goes on, this one just might move up a notch or two, as if by default.
Whereas some musicals deepen with time and others become dated, the theatrical values of ''Charity'' remain constant; the show seems better only because times are worse.


Pop View; Out of Tune With the Times?
LEAD: DOES LOVE OF MUSIC have a window of opportunity?


What Are The Jets' And Giants' Draft Needs?
LEAD: Who is going to block Dexter Manley?
The Giants need another Brad Benson.
Without him the Giants don't have a chance.
The Jets need a whole new team.

CHINATOWN MARKETPLACE
LEAD: THERE ARE TIMES WHEN the atmosphere of Chinatown is strongly reminiscent of the sights, the smells and the sounds of Hong Kong marketplaces -especially on weekends, when Asians from other parts of the metropolitan area crowd these narrow streets to do their week's shopping.
Chinatown offers great bargains as well as items that are unavailable elsewhere, such as fragrant fresh lemon grass, pale jade-colored bitter melons, chrysanthemum leaves, lichees and kumquats, water chestnuts, lotus root and fresh banana leaves for wrapping preparations of sticky rice.


Catharine Eddy White Marries John O'Rourke
LEAD: At the Central Presbyterian Church in Manhattan yesterday, Catharine Eddy White, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.

The Monte Carlo Orchestra Plays Roussel and Dukas
LEAD: It is not particularly the fault of Lawrence Foster and his Monte Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra that their Carnegie Hall concert Sunday afternoon prompted thoughts less about the specifics of the program at hand than about the international symphonic scene.
The playing was good: very good indeed in the hushed, well-sustained slow movement of Dukas's Symphony in C; more than adequate everywhere else.


3 Proposed for Federal Bench By D'Amato Are Scrutinized
LEAD: Three candidates for Federal judgeships recommended by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York have come under unusually intense scrutiny in regard to their ethics or qualifications.

LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  GILOT'S 'JOURNEY'  Straight from an acclaimed run at the Picasso Museum in France, ''Francoise Gilot: An Artist's Journey,'' a retrospective of the Frenchwoman's work, begins a tour of American museums in Hempstead today.
Why Hempstead?
That's where Hofstra University is, and since Ms.
Gilot is a special friend of Hofstra - the university has given her an honorary degree, and she's been involved in some of its art programing - the artist has chosen it as the first American site for her exhibition.


Women Film Directors Make a Strong Comeback
LEAD: THIS MONTH, AN UN-precedented number of films directed by women have opened in New York.


A NEW ERA: SENATE SEEKS A LEADER FOR THE 1990's
LEAD: The decision by Senator Robert C. Byrd to relinquish his post as Democratic leader in January may mean not only a changing of the guard but also the passing of an era.
The choice will be up to the West Virginian's fellow Democrats, who if they retain control of the Senate in November will pick the man to lead a troubled legislative body into the 1990's.


HOW THE U.S. CAST OFF NEUTRALITY IN GULF WAR

Paris Opera
LEAD: To the Editor: I recently returned from Paris and a visit to the Paris Opera.
Some thoughts on the Q &amp; A item of March 13 on ''Phantom of the Opera'' tours: Since viewing some parts of the opera house is very limited, especially on days of performance (you will not see the Chagall ceiling), we found the best thing to do was to buy the cheapest seat ($13) for an evening performance.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: THE MARTYR.
By Jurgen Petschull.
Translated by Stephen G. Cappellari. (Mercury House, $18.95.)

LEAD: LONG ISLAND business leaders seem unanimously against it.


Talks With Sabonis

LEAD: Penn's heavyweight varsity crew posted its first victory of the season to retain the Blackwell Cup, defeating Yale and Columbia on the Harlem River yesterday.

OLYMPIC PROFILE: MARY DECKER SLANEY; HARD TIMES BEHIND HER SLANEY RENEWS THE QUEST
LEAD: ON Aug. 4 she turns 30, and the mere idea of such antiquity drew a laugh and a slap of the forehead in mock disbelief. ''I know, I know,'' Mary Decker Slaney said. ''But they say distance runners don't peak until their mid-30's.
Do I believe it?
Yeah.
Of course I believe it.''

LEAD: THE airport security guard knew we were bicyclists - our carry-on luggage included helmets and handlebar packs.

If Jazz Quartet's on Stage, Lawyer Can Take a Bow
LEAD: ''I never had any musical talent, and everybody knows I can't sing a thing on key,'' said Paul Chevigny, a 52-year-old civil rights lawyer, law professor and jazz aficionado. ''I was always a guy who went to clubs, nursed a beer and just listened.''

City Hall Notes; Little Support From Within for Koch's Candidate

Headliners; On the Record
LEAD: ''Moonwalk,'' the autobiography of Michael Jackson, began dancing out of the bookstores last week.
For $15.95 a copy, readers became privy to the kind of tidbits that most entertainers toss off for free in interviews, which the reclusive Mr.
Jackson does not give.
The 29-year-old superstar concedes, for instance, that he has had his face remodeled, but not as much as many have speculated:


A CITY IN GREEN
LEAD: Henry Adams in his ''Education'' wrote that the contrast of the seasons gave life itsrelative values; he associated winter with town (Boston) and summer with country (Quincy).

Back to Basics In Baseball
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


A Canada Goose That Thought It Was a Chicken
LEAD: WHEN he came he could hardly be recognized as a proud Canada goose.


What Are The Jets' And Giants' Draft Needs?
LEAD: I've given up this kind of speculation after years of wondering why George Young drafted linebackers when we had so many good ones (L. T., Carl Banks, Gary Reasons, Pepper Johnson).
Or why he chose a free safety (Terry Kinard) when we had other needs or a tight end (Mark Bavaro).
It's been proven to me that the needs for both teams are the best players available.


Ethics Board Asks Developer to Testify
LEAD: ''WE'RE not dragging our feet,'' said Roland F. Berlingo, a member of the Port Chester Board of Ethics. ''These are legal matters, and they take time.''


THE HEALTH-CARE CHAOS
LEAD: Joseph Califano's article raised many issues concerning the rise in health-care costs, but fundamental to the discussion is his call for a cultural shift in patient attitudes and expectations.
He is saying, in effect, we must begin to make choices.


Corrections
LEAD: An article last Sunday about Harley-Davidson Inc. misidentified the motorcycle ridden by Marlon Brando in ''The Wild One.'' It was a Triumph.


Police Say Thief Told Victim He Had AIDS
LEAD: A Bronx man was arrested Friday night on charges that he had robbed a woman of her jewelry by telling her he had AIDS and holding a hypodermic needle to her neck, the police said.


Treat Teachers Like Professionals
LEAD: A RECENT article on teacher participation in the hiring process in the East Williston school district may give the teacher empowerment movement a much needed boost on Long Island.


Exterior Paint Problems
LEAD: BLISTERING and peeling are perhaps the two most noticeable signs of deteriorated exterior house paint.
Their causes can also be among the most difficult to pinpoint and remedy.
However, whether you intend to repaint your house or only make spot repairs, take time to analyze areas of deteriorated paint and eliminate their causes before mending them.


Ruth S. Sharp to Wed Robert A. Keilty
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
George B. Sharp of Katonah, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter Ruth Sloane Sharp to Robert Allan Keilty, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
R.
Bruce Keilty of Toronto.
A September wedding is planned.


N.F.L. Draft '88; ... BUT SO DO THE JETS
LEAD: AS good as he may be -and he will probably be very good - the first player the Jets draft today is unlikely to turn the club into a winner in 1988.
But it's a start.
Again.
The likely starting point, if the clubs ahead of the Jets draft to form, will be the offensive line.
The Jets pick eighth.
They would probably like to take Paul Gruber of Wisconsin.


Review/Pop; Dancing Zairian Rhythms By Les Quatre Etoiles
LEAD: Les Quatre Etoiles (the Four Stars), a seven-piece band from Zaire by way of Paris, brought intricate, effervescent dance music to SOB's on Wednesday.
Zairian pop is a cross-cultural delight, an amalgam of traditional rhythms, imported (or repatriated) Afro-Cuban rhumbas and electric guitars used in a purely Congolese style, with skipping, syncopated lines in a quicksilver tone.


Lord Ramsey, 83, Dies in Britain; Former Archbishop of Canterbury
LEAD: Lord Ramsey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury who, during his tenure as Primate of the Church of England, was a thorn in the side of conservatives and a proponent of worldwide Christian ecumenism, died yesterday in Oxford, England.
He was 83 years old.


Late-Inning Scramble Gives Mets a Victory
LEAD: The St.
Louis Cardinals huffed and puffed, traded guys, promoted guys, juggled guys, stole home and tried everything else to pull out of the tailspin tonight.


TALKING: Dockominiums; Navigating The Resale Market
LEAD: DOCKOMINIUMS have been around the New York coastal region for about four years - enough time to gain acceptance in boating circles and to build a track record for gauging how this kind of investment behaves over the longer term.


THE WORLD: Ambassador Grunwald's View; Kurt Waldheim and Austria's Embarrassment
LEAD: Henry A. Grunwald, a Jew who was born in Vienna, fled Austria after the Nazis took power in 1940.
He retired last year as editor in chief of Time Inc. and was appointed Ambassador to Austria by President Reagan.
Following are excerpts of a speech he gave this month at the University of Minnesota on Austrian attitudes toward Jews and Austrian President Kurt Waldheim's World War II activities.


New Jersey Guide
LEAD:  TRIBUTE TO RESISTANCE  Pierre Sauvage, among the 5,000 Jews smuggled out of the French village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon during the Nazi occupation, has made a film, ''Weapons of the Spirit,'' a tribute to the residents of that major way station in the Resistance's underground railway.


N.F.L. Draft '88; Giants Want A Tackle . . .
LEAD: THE Giants' first-round choice in today's National Football League draft will probably be an offensive tackle or a running back.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. The nearly flat roof on my ranch house has no provision for ventilation.
Roofers have told me the lack of air circulation makes rot a strong possibility.
I have been able to look inside this confined roof space but have seen nothing unusual.
I am about to have a new roof installed and want to know what to do about this problem, or even if there is a problem.


Hartford Series on Iran Aims at Misconceptions
LEAD: A program focusing on Iran will run in Hartford this week, and its organizers hope that it will dispel many incorrect stereotypes among Americans.


New Haven Holding On To 'Elm City' Nickname

Something There Is That Does Not Love a Missile
LEAD: To the Editor:


Television; The Shot Heard Round the World is Fired Anew
LEAD: BACK AROUND 1950, HOWARD Fast spent three months in prison for refusing to give the House Un-American Activities Committee the names of contributors to an organization deemed subversive by the Attorney General.
Although he had already published extensively, including the popular novels ''Freedom Road'' and ''Citizen Tom Paine,'' Mr.


Of Snobs, Art and Price Tags
LEAD: To the Editor:


The RoboAnchor
LEAD: Some weeks ago, NBC announced it was putting into operation television's latest technological marvel, the robotic camera, or robocam.
The robocam slides around the studio floor and zooms in for close-ups like any other TV camera, but all by remote control.
This means that the three or four cameras aimed at Tom Brokaw are no longer operated by three or four operators, but by one.


THE HEALTH-CARE CHAOS
LEAD: The ''barely explored world of biotechnology beyond the imagination of Steven Spielberg'' seems to carry a price tag beyond the imagination of King Midas.
The prices that are being charged for the new genetically engineered drugs are outrageous.
Instead of berating the American Association of Retired Persons for charging its measly $4.50 dispensing fee, Mr.


'Candidate' Runs Again And Wins
LEAD: JOHN FRANKENHEIMER'S ''MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE'' is arguably the most chilling piece of cold war paranoia ever committed to film, yet by now it has developed a kind of innocence.
There was so much that we had the good luck not to know in 1962, when the film was made; so much that, unluckily, we know now.


Does Albany's Fight to a Draw On Budget Portend Summer Standoffs?
LEAD: After a long and largely fruitless battle, New York state legislators last week approved a $28.4 billion budget that was essentially the same as the one they had been on the verge of passing before the deadline three weeks earlier.
The only difference was that after 20 days of debate, the Legislature had given up trying to reach agreements on the issues that had been holding them up.


Defying Curfew, Palestinians Hold Protests
LEAD: Israeli troops maintained a curfew today on 400,000 Arabs in the occupied territories during a ''Day of Anger'' ordered by Palestinian leaders.
But some protests took place, and in one of them an Israeli police officer shot and killed a Palestinian man who reportedly attacked the officer with an ax.


PICNICS TO GO
LEAD: Despite the constraints of the urban landscape, New Yorkers love a picnic.
We jump at the chance to eat outdoors - at sporting events, concerts and shows in the parks, or a garden outing.
And stocking the picnic basket is now almost as easy as buying hot dogs from an umbrella cart.
Restaurants, carry-out shops and caterers have organized picnic menus, complete three- or four-course meals, assembled and ready to go.


PRAGMATISTS LEAD IN BUSH ECONOMICS
LEAD: After a primary campaign in which his economic proposals consisted mainly of support for President Reagan's programs, Vice President Bush has gathered around him advisers who are helping him prepare proposals that imply a more moderate, pragmatic agenda.


IN THE REGION: Long Island; Recent Sales

LEAD: John S. Radosta, who spent 38 years with The New York Times as a photo editor and reporter, died of lung cancer yesterday at the Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan.
Mr.
Radosta, who retired from The Times in 1983, was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.


The Plot's The Thing - Again
LEAD: A LEGEND IS A TWISTED FACT THAT HAS SURVIVED more than a generation.
Having burrowed into the general consciousness, it is well on the way to becoming irrefutable myth.
No one is ever going to prove, for instance, that Helen's face launched only 500 ships, or that there was an honest man in Athens but Diogenes just didn't find him.


WHEN THE CASE FOR THE DEFENSE IS TOP SECRET
LEAD: When Lieut.
Col.
Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter were in the White House, they handled some of the most closely held secrets in the Government.
They knew the intimate details of this country's covert operations.
They learned precisely where and under what circumstances American intelligence can eavesdrop on conversations around the world.

Donald I. Applebaum of Iselin, N.J.
An August wedding is planned.


Pleasing the Teen-Ager Who Buys the T-shirt
LEAD: YOU can't judge a company by its trademark, but customers do anyway - and for that reason, among others, companies spend millions of dollars each year making sure their trademarks convey the intended message.
From commercial characters as lively as Cap'n Crunch to dignified corporate logos, trademarks shape the identity of a company and its brands.


Polly Roberts Married To Rexford Hall Swain
LEAD: Mary Jaques Roberts and Rexford Hall Swain were married yesterday at the Myopia Hunt Club in Hamilton, Mass.

Muslim Patrols Fight Capital Drug Trade

STREETSCAPES: Claremont Stables; An 1892 Survivor of Close Calls With Demolition
LEAD: BUILT in 1892, Claremont Stables at 175 West 89th Street in Manhattan has twice escaped demolition.
Now the city, which had condemned the site for housing in 1965, has both offered to sell the building back to the family that has operated it as a riding academy since 1943 and proposed the building for landmark designation.


POSTINGS: Fishkill Project; The Rush To Dutchess
LEAD: A five-year, $100 million project being built in Fishkill, N.Y., is grounded in microprocessors and home furnishings.
The first of six office buildings, a four-story, 120,000-square-foot structure, will be ready for occupancy in June.
Its first tenant, with 6,200 square feet, will be the Intel Corporation, the world's largest maker of microprocessors.


Rajneesh Haven: A Legacy of Debts
LEAD: SIX years after the Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh began to build a ''world commune'' near Antelope, Ore., all that was left was a ghost city.


RIDING THE ROAD OF DANGEROUS CARS
LEAD: REMEMBER how on long drives you used to make a game of spotting out-of-state license plates?
Lately, I've been playing a similar time-passing game when I'm driving after dark - counting ''one-eyed'' drivers.


Another Feather For Massimino
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Quartets Play Today: Tokyo and Manhattan
LEAD: GREAT quartets and grand opera, not to mention orchestral galas, are on the schedule as the end of April approaches, and with it, the winding down of the concert season.


THE HEALTH-CARE CHAOS
LEAD: Joseph Califano's article implied that the support of the American Association of Retired Persons for the prescription-drug benefit under Medicare's proposed catastrophic-health-insurance legislation is due to the ''substantial windfall'' for A.A.R.P.'s mail-service pharmacy.
This is simply not true.


Strawberry Shortcake: Two Versions

Trade Bill Passes First Crucial Vote
LEAD: A trade bill made it through the House.
A party-line vote of 312 to 107 approved the measure, which included an intensely disputed item requiring that workers be given 60 days' notice of plant shutdowns or big layoffs.
President Reagan, in a stand backed by many business groups, has said he will veto a bill that includes the notice provision.

LEAD: Leftist guerrillas dressed as Government soldiers massacred 20 peasants in a remote mountain hamlet to avenge the deaths of three rebels in February, witnesses said today.


Sydney's Quirky Village, Paddington
LEAD: SYDNEY'S neighborhood of Paddington has always celebrated bohemia in Down Under style.
Its 400 acres of sturdy Victorian terrace houses are festooned with a quirky overlay of lighthearted colonial, wrought-iron balconies and gray-green eucalyptus trees.
And, like Greenwich Village in New York or the French Quarter in New Orleans, Paddington preserves a village ambiance with local institutions and colorful personalities that confound the bulldozer of progress.


Sports of The Times; Hockey Wins but Loses
LEAD: MARK JOHNSON did not mind being overshadowed by Patrik Sundstrom in the Devils' 10-4 victory over the Washington Capitals Friday night.

EXPERIENCE WINS, BUT NOT TOTALLY, OVER YOUTH
LEAD: IT might be expected that experience would triumph over youth in match play, and that is what happened generally in the preliminary world championship candidates matches in Saint John, New Brunswick.
Yet in the seven contests the more mature players did not achieve a shutout but had to yield two victories to younger adversaries.


Cervantes Award Given To Carlos Fuentes
LEAD: The Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes today was awarded Spain's $87,000 Cervantes prize for literature, considered the top honor for Spanish-language writers.

The report was released today.


Social Events; Parties With a Purpose
LEAD:  For Creative Solitude


Rediscovering Japanese Life At a Bike's Pace
LEAD: JAPAN.
Remembering the old days.
I had been there a number of times, the last of them as a fighter pilot direct from the war in Korea.
We were given 48 hours in Tokyo every two months or so.
I have a vague recollection of having seen the Great Buddha at Kamakura, but far more distinct are images of an indoor waterfall, many lighted levels and 800 evening-gowned hostesses - the allures of a famous nightclub called the Mikado,


THREE WORLDS OF 57th STREET; The World of Music
LEAD: ALTHOUGH BIG BUSIness deals are cut in financial centers all over the world, the name that comes to mind when we think of stocks and bonds is Wall Street.
Theater in midtown Manhattan fans out into a dozen side streets and alleys, but all major activity is nonetheless subsumed under the rubric Broadway.


THERE'S MORE TO CHINATOWN
LEAD: It is your original ethnic theme park.
I could eat the air, food-promise-crammed.
Street life chugs, as thick and rich as arterial blood.
Guitar-twang speech, a harmonic convergence of it, is all around.
Red and gold, colors of good luck, flare up.
And this wild variegation, alongside the jagged Chinese writing, cuts against architectural regularity.


'Angel Street': Wife And Her Tormentor
LEAD: IN 1939, Patrick Hamilton's thriller ''Gas Light'' opened in London, and in 1941 the same play, about a fiendish husband trying to drive his wife insane, opened in New York under the title ''Angel Street.'' It was later made into a Hollywood movie, again titled ''Gaslight.'' The Arena Players Repertory Company has revived ''Angel


THE HIGH COST OF THINNESS
LEAD: It is with great concern that I respond to Robin Marantz Henig's article ''The High Cost of Thinness'' (Body and Mind, Feb. 28).
The article correctly states that suction lipectomy is the most common form of esthetic surgery performed in the United States today, but the procedure is not designed to be an easy way to make people ''look thinner.


ORCHESTRATION
LEAD: PUTTING TOGETHER A MENU IS A DIFFERENT skill entirely from cooking a great dish.
The process has often been compared to composing a symphony.
A chef who understands the progression of the ''movements'' of a dinner knows how to create anticipation, climaxes and resolution in the way dishes are arranged in sequence.

Dance View
LEAD: EVERY SO OFTEN A NOTABLE young choreographic talent creeps up on the ballet world, diligently producing imaginative, even excellent work that is perhaps more appreciated abroad than at home.
Along the way, he or she develops what looks like a confirmed signature, and yet the evidence is that, like any true creative spirit, this choreographer is still in a stage of continuing development.


Winning Makes Devils Easy to Love
LEAD: With rueful smiles, the group has come to call itself the Original 13.
They first met one evening in 1982.
For the most part, they were young and idealistic, although admittedly somewhat apprehensive about the future of their union.
In time, a constitution was drafted and bylaws were adopted.


A Chance to Pile Up a Few Dollars More
LEAD: Below are answers to some recent questions from readers of the Personal Finance column.


BOOKS FROM THE TIMES
LEAD: PITCHERS DO GET LONELY: And Other Sports Stories.
By Ira Berkow. (Atheneum, $17.95.) ''For some of us,'' writes the New York Times sports columnist Ira Berkow, ''the struggle to get it right, to do it well and to realize at least a small portion of our dreams never ends.
Like sports.'' In this selection of 85 columns that have appeared in The Times since 1981, the author covers the bases - including an interview with Sigmund Freud, who analyzes the Yankees owner George Steinbrenner - and everything else, from basketball to hockey to wrestling.


House Panel Reports Abuse and Conflicts At a Federal Agency
LEAD: Officials of a Federal agency that was created to sell property from insolvent savings institutions traveled in high style and awarded no-bid contracts to former business associates, all while receiving six-figure salaries and bonuses, the House Banking Committee has charged.


AVIATION ACE: Ernest H. Boullioun; Roaring Out of Retirement
LEAD: THE sign on the door says ''Boullioun Aviation Services/Sumishin Leasing.'' Inside are brand-new quarters - so new the furniture is still arriving.
And behind the desk in the executive office, surrounded by model planes and framed by a sweeping view of Lake Washington, sits Ernest H. ''Tex'' Boullioun, retired president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Company.


CHANGING TIDES
LEAD: On a mild afternoon I watch pretty little single-masted sailboat beat its way around the foot of Manhattan Island.
Against the background of skyscraping towers, it looks absurdly delicate as it glides along, close to the wind.
Between Governors Island and the Jersey piers a half-dozen more sailboats are racing over the gray water.


Corrections
LEAD: An article on March 20 about subliminal messages misstated the annual sales of self-help subliminal tapes.
The estimated figure is 2.5 million tapes.


Fuel-Wise Corvettes: Detroit's Longtime Guzzlers Learn to Sip
LEAD: When the Senate Finance Committee voted last month to double the tax on cars rated as gas guzzlers, the domestic auto industry scarcely lifted an eyebrow.

PERSPECTIVES: The M.C.I. Allowance; Attacking a Rental Upgrading Incentive
LEAD: ''THE only way you can maintain rental property is to get the major capital improvement allowance,'' said Joseph Pistilli, whose Astoria-based company, the Pistilli Group, owns and manages older buildings in Queens and Brooklyn. ''It would be economic suicide if it were revoked.''


Architecture View; A Novel Design And Its Rescue From Near Disaster
LEAD: ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY stories in contemporary American architecture is that of the John Hancock Tower in Boston, a glass slab that for years was known less for its architecture than for the fact that while it was under construction its windows kept tumbling out onto the street.
They did not all fall out, but so many of them cracked, broke and were replaced with a temporary sheet of plywood that it was common to hear Bostonians call the tower the U.S.


POSTINGS: Norwalk Market; Condominium, Yes; Office Building, No
LEAD: The changing face of Clocktower Square, a planned office and apartment complex near downtown Norwalk, Conn., is a sign of the times for Fairfield County.
While construction of a 61-unit condominium will begin in June, continuing an urban revival aided by a strong residential market, plans for a 55,000-square-foot office building have been shelved for now.

Financial Aid And Private Colleges
LEAD: The article ''Concern Growing on College Costs'' on March 20 contained a number of inaccuracies with regard to the cost of attending a private college.

Review/Theater; Feeling Right at Home With the Unspeakable
LEAD: No need to take a hit of anything before you go into Sebastian Stuart's ''Beverly's Yard Sale'' at the Theater for the New City; if this thing, all on its own, doesn't shake your screws loose, mere chemistry won't help you get it.
The play, the third part of what Mr.
Stuart calls his Saugerties trilogy, pits a degenerate Hudson


'Chess' Seeks To Shed Its Checkered Past
LEAD: TIM RICE, THE LYRICIST AND mastermind behind ''Chess,'' has a nickname for the spectacle that will be unveiled this Thursday at the Imperial Theater.
He calls the $6 million show, which originated as a record album in 1984 and has had one of the longest, most troubled histories of any musical to reach Broadway, ''Chess II.


EMBROIDERED ANTS AND SUCH
LEAD: Isabel Canovas's fal accessory collection resembles an etntomologist's fantasy: embroidered and jeweled ants scamper across a classic high-heel pump in hot pink silk, and a purple octagonal handbag is embroidered in a spiderweb patern, complete with caputred flies.

Schoolgirl Has No Illusions
LEAD: The shorts are baggy, which is to be expected of those issued for Olympic trials.
She wears low-cut black sneakers, an old-fashioned look in the era of Air Jordan.
She has a pale complexion and her medium-length blonde hair is cropped short in front, to keep it out of her eyes.
In the gymnasiums and playgrounds of Indianapolis, her appearance and passion for basketball has earned Vicki Hall the nickname Lady Bird, the female version of Indiana's favorite son, who plays for the Boston


Jews Voted Against Jackson for Views, Not Color
LEAD: To the Editor:


IN LATIN AMERICA, NORIEGA IS A PRINCIPLE
LEAD: Seen more as a whim of American power than as a new commitment to democracy in the hemisphere, the Reagan Administration's campaign to unseat Panama's military leader has been received with a mixture of resentment and resignation by the rest of Latin America.
No one is willing to recognize Washington's right to meddle in the domestic affairs of countries of the region, but no one seems able to stop it from happening.

For Fugard, Many Roads Lead to This 'Mecca'
LEAD: THE TITLE CHARACTER IN ''Dimetos,'' one of the few Athol Fugard plays that has not yet been performed in the United States, lives on a stark landscape, unidentified by name but a clear approximation of New Bethesda in South Africa.
At one point, Dimetos describes a workman in the local quarries as a man who ''assaulted'' rock ''as if nothing short of total obliteration would satisfy him.

FILL-IN FLASH ANXIETY REMEDIED
LEAD: BACK in the Dark Ages of photography, the most anxiety-producing technique known to camera-toting man or woman was called fill-in flash.
It was meant to remedy a common problem of outdoor portraiture: too much contrast.
Sophisticated photographers knew that just the right amount of light from a flash would eliminate unflattering deep shadows from under their subjects' noses, eyes and chins.


Offense on Film?

WHAT'S DOING IN SEATTLE
LEAD: In Seattle this is the year of the drought.
This is a mixed blessing for Northwesterners, to whom too much sun is as objectionable as someone who wears the same shirt every day.
A favorite quote, attributed to John Steinbeck and displayed in offices and homes all over town, goes like this, ''I lived in a place with a nice climate once and it bored the hell out of me.


PRIVATE TERMS WINS
LEAD: Private Terms ran his record to 7 for 7 by scoring a 1 1/2-length victory over Seeking the Gold and Cherokee Colony in the $599,000 Wood Memorial Stakes at Aqueduct yesterday.

Breat Cancer: Anguish, Mystery and Hope
LEAD: IT IS TUESDAY, BREAST CANCER DAY AT THE National Institutes of Health clinic in Bethesda, Md.
At first glance, the women sitting in this sunny waiting room waiting to be examined look perfectly healthy.
There are no obvious wigs - the telltale sign of chemotherapy.
But these patients are clearly nervous, flipping through magazines distractedly or staring out through the large plate-glass window at a wooded landscape dotted with N.I.H.


Art or Not? Anyway, Now It's Mine
LEAD: I CAN'T blame the wine at the opening - I'd only had one small plastic glassful, and it was white and cheap.
But something had loosened my inhibitions and purse strings, and now I'm a Collector, a graduate to uppercase.


STEPPING OUT
LEAD: FOR MANY MUSICIANS, NEW YORK ISN'T the center of the world - it's more like a far-flung suburb of Port-au-Prince or Athens, Bogota or Dublin.

Comeback by the Atlanta Papers Isn't All Hurrahs
LEAD: This city's newspapers, The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, have all the ingredients of an editor's dream: a celebrated reputation in need of repairing, owners with money and a hunger for dramatic improvement, a town large enough to support a first-rate paper, and a big story to cover - the evolving South.


Smoking Becomes 'Deviant Behavior'
LEAD: It was cause for a libel award when a Chicago television commentator said in 1981 that the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation was trying to snare teen-agers with advertisements relating smoking to drugs, alcohol and sex.

About the Arts/NEW YORK; At Yale, Images of Pope: A Classical Poet With Tragedy At His Very Core
LEAD: ALEXANDER POPE WAS born 300 years next month, on May 21, 1688.
A hundred years later, when he had already been in his grave for 44 years, he was still a dominant literary force, his immense reputation seemingly secure.
But the tide was about to turn, and 100 years further on, the prevailing view was that he had scarcely been a poet at all.


A Cure for a Company's Identity Crisis
LEAD: CORPORATE logos once tended to be straightforward graphics and identifiable trademark objects and characters - the A.T.&amp;T. bell, for example, or Pegasus, Mobil's winged horse.
In the 1970's, however, logos took on a new look: Lettering and symbols became abstract, and logo characters became passe.

If Budd is not banned by the board, the British team could be banned from international competition for 12 months and miss the


Television; Reading Hemingway With One Eye Closed
LEAD: IN HIS KINDER MOMENTS, ERNEST Hemingway regarded biographers as either grave-robbers or morticians.
As a grim compliment, he congratulated Arthur Mizener on his 1951 biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald, ''The Far Side of Paradise,'' calling it ''good undertaking.'' It was not an unintentional pun.
Mizener, Hemingway said, had done a better job than most members of the profession: ''Almost as good as the job they did on my father's face when he shot himself.


Review/Pop; Ironic Songs And Tart Lyrics By Jay Leonhart
LEAD: Jay Leonhart, one of the most sought-after standup bass players on the New York pop-jazz scene, has another side to his musical personality.
A writer of humorous rhymed verse, he has recorded three albums of original songs that combine his jousting wit with fluid bebop-flavored melodies.

He said, ''Can I check the oil?''


What Are The Jets' And Giants' Draft Needs?
LEAD: The Giants' two needs are an offensive line and the secondary.
The Giants will probably draft Paul Gruber of Wisconsin if he is available.
If he is not, my hunch is they will go for size and draft John Elliott of Michigan.
For their secondary, look for names like Michael Brim of Virginia Union and Quintin Jones of

BELMONT MAKES THE HEART BEAT FASTER
LEAD: From the window of the placing judges booth, a hundred feet above the finish line at Belmont Park, the horses look like canoes as they pass beneath on the post parade to the starting gate - canoes with bright colors at their centers, the silks of the jockeys, the red jackets of the outriders, the green jackets of the pony boys and girls.

THE HEALTH-CARE CHAOS
LEAD: Joseph A. Califano Jr.'s article ''The Health-Care Chaos'' (March 20), was a well-balanced dissection of today's health-care cost problems.
More importantly, he has provided well thought out, eminently sensible solutions, but the main questions remain.
Will Government and the judicial system make the necessary changes and will the medical community be able to establish valid standards for quality care combined with justifiable expense?


DUKAKIS STRATEGY: GRAB FROM BUSH, BORROW FROM JACKSON
LEAD: A strange calm descended on the campaign trail last week.
Not only the Republicans but now also the Democrats seem very close to having their nominee, months before the national conventions.

BREAKING THE LAW IN NEW YORK CITY: 7 MILLION PEOPLE, HALF A MILLION FELONIES
LEAD: Killings rose in New York City last year, alarmingly in some areas, and it was small comfort that robberies were down.
While robberies declined by 2.4 percent to 78,890, the New York City Police Department reported last week, murders increased by 5.8 percent to 1,691.


THE HEALTH-CARE CHAOS
LEAD: Joseph Califano states in his article that Americans spent $1,800 a person on health care in 1985.
He says that the British spent $600 and yet their health-care system is ''sophisticated and modern'' and that life expectancy is ''at least as high as in the United States. . . .'' This, however, obscures the fact that a British citizen with chronic debilitating pain resulting from, for example, end-stage hip disease, may have to suffer for years waiting for surgery.


HIS, NOW HERS
LEAD: FASHION HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, BUT there's more to it than that.
On the right woman, a man's shirt can be alluring - one reason, experts say, why shirts designed for men routinely find their way into many women's closets.
A man-sized shirt masks curves, to be sure, admits Judith Waters, a psychologist who has studied the role clothes play in business and private life.

NEWS SUMMARY
LEAD:  INTERNATIONAL/3-19


A Treasure Trove Worthy of a Pulitzer
LEAD: ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE were collectors who did not follow fashion, never resold or traded what they had bought, preferred the difficult and the taxing to the easy and ingratiating and never, ever, used the word ''I'' when discussing the art that they owned.

THREE WORLDS OF 57th STREET; The World of Art
LEAD: IN THE MATTER OF 57th Street, I find myself agreeing with the art critic who spoke of it as perhaps the longest street in the country - so far does it stretch in our imaginations, and so widely is its example followed.
Many other streets in Manhattan have art galleries, and some of them are very good indeed (others are awful, which is a story for another day), but 57th


Antiques; A Bestiary of British Furniture
LEAD: BEHEMOTHIC BRITISH furniture - framed in columns, crowned with pediments and fitted with beastly feet - dominated fashionable interiors throughout England, Scotland and Ireland 150 years ago.

No Headline
LEAD: Kurt Vonnegut usually has several of what he describes as ''conscience books'' around the house.
This does not mean that Mr.
Vonnegut routinely delves into how to be a better person or atone for sins.
Not at all.
Conscience books are those that he believes he should read, as opposed to those that he freely chooses to read.


THE MEN WHO BRING US SPRING
LEAD: From spring to spring, you never know what you'll find in the public gardens at Wave Hill, up in the Bronx.
