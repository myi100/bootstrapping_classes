State Lines and Party Lines Are Coinciding Less
LEAD: FINALLY, everything is for keeps.
The 1988 election campaign has been going on for the better part of two years.

How I Learned to Love the Deficit
LEAD: I WISH to argue a case in favor of a Federal deficit as a normal aspect of sound economic policy.
This is to enter a plea in the face of overwhelming public opinion as well as against the views of many, although certainly not all, economists.
It would therefore seem to be a hopeless case.
I hope to show that it is not.

LEAD: FOR more than 12 years, the New York City Board of Education has tried to maintain racial balance in a handful of neighborhood high schools despite the dwindling number of white students.
This has been done by closing the door to minority students from outside the neighborhood, if the school's population was less than 50 percent white.


Notebook; Players Resent 'Double Standard' on Punishment
LEAD: The players see Pete Rose suspended for pushing an umpire, Billy Hatcher suspended for corking a bat, Kevin Gross and Joe Niekro suspended for having forbidden objects on the mound, Pedro Guerrero suspended for throwing a bat and they wonder.

British Sitcoms: Where Nothing Is Sacrosanct
LEAD: Even back in the days when the British had no sense of humor, it was understood by Americans that their distant insular relatives were funny.

Question Of the Week How Will The Giants And Jets Do in '88?
LEAD: I am getting bad signals from the Giants.
The line still has some unanswered questions (especially William Roberts at his new position).
If the line has trouble, the whole offense will be in bad shape with Phil Simms being grounded and Joe Morris pounded.
And after watching the Browns game, it's safe to say the wide receivers aren't producing as much as anyone has hoped.

The Teacher's Nervous, Too
LEAD: PERHAPS preschool anxiety in teachers begins as early as the calendar page of July becomes scratch paper left on the countertop with vestiges of breakfast juice and scribbling of things yet to do, or maybe its beginning dates back to unresolved conflicts of childhood school days.
Whatever the origin, preschool anxiety is real and manifests its presence in many different ways.

As Summer Wanes, City Picnickers Bloom
LEAD: WITH the Labor Day weekend upon us, it's hardly surprising that New York City has been abloom lately with picnickers.
These appear in abundance late every summer and are easily identified.

Answering the Mail
LEAD: Q. When our house was built in 1959 we had a large walk-in cedar closet built in for clothing storage.

Mr.
Gregorian, who presided over the revival of the library as president, was appointed last week as the 16th president of Brown University.

New York: Viking. $15.95.


WORDS AND MUSIC
LEAD: Martin Gottfried criticizes my ''so usually impeccable'' rhyming by citing the rhyme of ''liaisons'' with ''raisins'' in ''A Little Night Music.'' He misses the point.
As is clearly indicated by the normal (i.e. Anglicized French) pronunciation of ''liaisons'' throughout the rest of the lyric to which he refers, it is a deliberately false rhyme, meant to express the wry contempt of the character who sings it (meant, too, to get a laugh, which it usually did).

A School for Pedal Pushers
LEAD: KNEES flexed, weight slung back, we neophytes poised at the top of the beginners' hill at Mount Snow, Vt., and prepared for our first descent.
From the bottom, the slope had looked like a gentle rise.
Now from above, it was a different matter entirely.
This wasn't a downhill.
This was a crater.
Waved down by the instructor, we pushed off one by one and soon were fishtailing through the thick grass and rocks, squeezing the bike's hand brakes for dear life.


Delay in Fuel Aid Program
LEAD: The state's fuel assistance program that helps poor families heat their homes will start a month later this year and end a month earlier because of a lack of funds.

It May Be Good But Is It Art?
LEAD: Critics interested in new art are usually wary of relegating the efforts of someone who claims to be an artist to the status of ''not art.'' Consequently, one usually asks the question the other way around.
It's art, we tacitly agree, but is it any good?
We assume that answering this question will automatically take care of the other, more difficult one:

Answering the Mail
LEAD: Q. When our house was built in 1959 we had a large walk-in cedar closet built in for clothing storage.
Now the smell is gone.
Is the wood still a deterrent against moths, and if it isn't can the wood be treated to restore the odor and the mothproof qualities?

LEAD: SENATOR DAN QUAYLE, the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, has claimed bragging rights for his efforts to enact the 1983 Job Training Partnership Act, the measure that provides Federal funds to train the unemployed poor for jobs.

LEAD: There seem to be two sides to everything in the Cradle of Democracy.
Athens abounds in history, but suffers from unchecked modern development: On the Acropolis, the 2,500-year-old Parthenon stands above a television antenna-dotted skyline.
The city is renowned for openness and hospitality, but the noise and congestion would try the patience of Hercules.

Nothing Is Disturbing the Peace at the Western White House

POSTINGS: Targeting the Bay Ridge Market; Offices in a Family Setting
LEAD: Steve Pappas readily admits that constructing an office building among the two- and three-family homes in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn is a bit unusual.
But that singularity, he said, assures a local market.
The 58,000-square-foot structure that Mr.
Pappas, with Gino Silvestri and Gus Spiropoulos, is raising above 92d Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues will be marketed mostly to medical, legal and other small space users now shoehorned into neighborhood storefronts.

LEAD: Predicting that there will be 3.6 pecent more problem drinkers in New York State by 1995, a new state report calls for substantial increases in all levels of alcoholism-treatment programs.


A Choice Encounter
LEAD: IT WAS 1973 and Ansley J. Coale was fed up with academia.
So he bought 2,000 acres in Ukiah, Calif., in Mendocino County.
It's only two hours north of Berkeley, where he'd been teaching Greek and Roman history, but - emotionally at least - it's about as far from faculty meetings as it's possible to get.


Poland's Tired Dreams
LEAD: There is neither euphoria nor despair in the Polish regime's new agreement to negotiate with its people, whom the Government has openly come to call ''the opposition.'' Eight years to the day after signing the agreement recognizing Solidarity in 1980, the independent union's leader, Lech Walesa, wearily sat down again to open talks.


Packing Without Angst: Making a Priority List
LEAD: A FRIEND used to suffer from packer's block, which is like writer's block, if less fashionable.
An episode usually begins when the suitcase is opened preparatory to travel.
The victim abruptly seizes on some other problem, like alphabetizing the medicine cabinet or waxing the kitchen floor.
My friend, unable to get the first pair of socks into the valise, would call at bizarre hours on Friday nights to get help.

Question Of the Week How Will The Giants And Jets Do in '88?
LEAD: The Giants are much like the Mets.
They can control their destiny.

I see no other N.F.C. teams getting in the way of the Giants' path back to the Super Bowl.


Sanford Weill Goes Back to Wall Street
LEAD: Sanford Weill is getting back in the brokerage business.
The founder of the firm that became Shearson Lehman Hutton worked out a $1.65 billion deal under which his Commercial Credit Group will merge with Primerica, the parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham.
Primerica, the former American Can Company, has been transformed into a financial services conglomerate by Gerald Tsai Jr., who made a fortune during the stock market's ''go-go'' years of the 1960's.

OLYMPIC ATHLETE

Up in Arms Over Yanks, Their Owner, and Their Attitude; Accentuating The Negative
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


NEWS SUMMARY
LEAD:  INTERNATIONAL/3-21


A Fight to Win The Middle Class
LEAD: PEOPLE could wonder why Michael Dukakis bothers running.
Jimmy Carter rode Gerald Ford out of the White House with a severe recession fresh in voters' minds and inflation picking up speed.
Ronald Reagan then rode Mr.
Carter out, months after another recession and when inflation and interest rates were raging.


Rushing to (Mis)Judgment
LEAD: Five years after a Soviet fighter shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, and two months after the U.S.S.
Vincennes shot down an Iranian Airbus, America has yet to come to grips with the common elements in these two tragedies.
The Reagan Administration rushed to deny that there could be any.
Indeed, the incidents were not parallel, but there were important similarities in the way the parties involved responded.

Glick in the 60's
LEAD: To the Editor:


Headliners; Back in the U.S.S.R.?
LEAD: The telegram didn't say all was forgiven, but Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn has, in effect, been invited back home - at least for a visit.
The Russian writer, who was expelled in 1974 as an enemy of the people and now resides in Vermont, was invited last week to join a Soviet committee supervising the building of a memorial honoring the victims of Stalin-era repression.


Army's Hold in Guatemala Stirs Fear for Democracy
LEAD: Two and a half years after Guatemalans elected a civilian President in an effort to end decades of military dominance, progress toward democracy is slow, and frustration is increasing.
Although trade unionists and other protesters have greater freedom to organize than they did in the past, men in uniform still exercise ultimate political authority.

By Cynthia Harrison.  337 pp.
Berkeley: University of California Press. $25.


Seoul Shoes
LEAD: To the Editor: The article ''What's Doing in Seoul'' (Travel, July 24) states that Reebok shoes are available in the Itaewon shopping district in Seoul for $15.
This is, unfortunately, a perfect example of the old adage that something that appears to be too good a bargain generally is.
All shoes that are available in Itaewon at this price are counterfeit.


Looking Ahed to Fall's Concerts
LEAD: WITH the concert season in its end-of-the-summer doldrums, the moment seems right to look ahead to some of the music awaiting us in the fall, remembering that the early concert subscriber not only gets better seats and lower prices, but can also avoid the sold-out signs sure to appear when such stars as James Galway, Dave Brubeck and Canadian Brass come to town.


Correction
LEAD: An article in the Sports section last Sunday on a rule change in college football did not mention the number of points a defensive team can score on conversion attempts.

Truth Eludes Fact and Fiction
LEAD: One reason why the feature-length documentary has lately been in decline is that the fiction feature has subsumed its role.
We're as apt to get our facts from lightly embroidered versions of real events as from the events themselves.
The television movie, which can proudly base itself on a true story and then touch up the story to suit the audience's taste, has paved the way for this development, but television drama in itself is rarely alarming.


POSTING: Duplexes on a Recreation Site; 44 on 3 Acres
LEAD: ''Just about everyone on Long Island knows this site,'' said Robert Krieger, who with his father, Maxwell, and brother, Steven, is building 44 town houses on three acres in Elmont.
But not just any three acres.
On this lot between Stewart and Franklin Streets on Johnson Avenue was a recreational complex that included a huge, above-ground pool and the Wal-Cliffe Rollerdrome, a roller-skating rink.


Wit can Undermine a Woman's Career
LEAD: HOW I long for a good belly laugh.
But I probably won't have one, at least not in public, until I retire.
Women in business don't do that sort of thing - just like, at one time, ''nice'' girls did not have sex before marriage or at least they didn't broadcast it.


Correction
LEAD: A page 1 article yesterday about the reimposition of fines against the City of Yonkers for refusal to comply with a desegregation order incorrectly described a Federal judge's proposal for settling the case.

LONG ISLAND GUIDE

LEAD: WHEN the Nassau County police officer arrived at the scene of the accident along the Long Island Expressway, he saw that the driver, a 36-year-old man driving a 1981 Chevy Caprice, had slurred speech and glazed and bloodshot eyes and staggered when he tried to walk.

'Summer '88' At Sound Shore Features 50 Visions

LEAD: ANDREW is black.
His family comes from Barbados and they are Christian.

A while ago they married among their friends and families.
I, one of their guests, have spent lots of time thinking of that joyous but perplexing afternoon.


Doors and Windows: Shelter From the Storm
LEAD: If your home lacks storm doors or storm windows or you wish to replace existing ones, you can save money by installing them yourself.
Doing so is usually a simple procedure.
The easiest doors and windows to install are pre-hung - that is, mounted in their frames.
Pre-hung storm doors and windows are made to fit nearly all standard door and window openings.

Meadowlands Recycling Plan
LEAD: State officials hoped to include thousands of football fans in a new recycling campaign at Monday night's season opener at the Meadowlands between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants.
To help comply with a 1987 state law that calls for a 25-percent reduction in the state's waste flow, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority has set up 60 recycling bins for glass bottles and cans at the parking lot of Giants Stadium.


New Charges for the Call of the Wild
LEAD: Great egrets glide over the peaceful Suisun Marsh and antlered tule elks trumpet for their mates in these warm final days of summer, oblivious that something of a revolution in wildlife management has begun around them.


New Setbacks for the I.R.A. But Still the Group Endures
LEAD: The Irish Republican Army routinely advises its new recruits that service in the guerrilla organization will most likely lead them to one of two destinations: a prison cell or a cemetery plot.

Underdogs Have Their Day as Top Players Fall
LEAD: Eight of the 16 seeded players in the men's draw and six of the seeded women were eliminated in the first week of the United States Open, and the men's third round has not yet been completed.
Thus, the rainy-day question yesterday was whether that was good or bad news for tennis.
Critics often complain that the game is dominated by a handful of players, which can make the weekly results repetitive.


Fleeing Assault by Iraqis, Kurds Tell of Poison Gas and Lives Lost
LEAD: They were, they said, the fortunate ones, who had come from a land at war and survived.
And their path, in flight from Iraq's elite forces, had brought them here, to a broad valley clustered with rocks and people and small cooking-fires - and a sense that, once more at history's turning, a Kurdish minority had been crushed by a hated foe.


Appointments at Avon
LEAD: James E. Preston, president of Avon Products Inc., has been named to the additional post of chief executive.
Mr.
Preston, 55 years old, was named president in May, becoming the heir apparent to Hicks B. Waldron, 64, the chairman and chief executive, who plans to retire at the end of the year.
As president, Mr.

The Art of Survival
LEAD: When the Freer Gallery of Art closes tomorrow for renovations, its colony of turtles will be boarded out among employees of the Smithsonian Institution, of which the gallery is a part.

Jets Need Dominant Decision-Maker
LEAD: In a steady rain, the Jets' inexperience melted into ineptness.

MUSIC: Avant-garde to Zydeco, By Way of Texas
LEAD: Nobody thought avant-garde music could pay a club's rent until the Knitting Factory came along.
A few months after it opened, it had become a center for improvisational music, at the nexus of risky, format-defying new jazz, new rock and the postmodern assemblages of downtown composers - the tumultuous piano solos of Cecil Taylor, the quick-change artistry of John Zorn, the geometrically proportioned slabs of noise composed by Elliott Sharp, the dreamlike performance-rock of Hugo Largo or the skewed, clattery funk of Curlew.

LEAD: The essence of Richard N. Goodwin's charge in his article ''The War Within'' (Aug. 21) is that midway in 1965 Lyndon B. Johnson, detached from reality, became a raving paranoid.
Mr.
Goodwin confirms this indictment by revealing that he consulted medical books to fortify his epiphany.
Like some latter-day Clark Kent, he vanished daily into a White


Managing the Hotel 100 Homeless Families Call Home

High Mileage Rules May Stall Detroit
LEAD: ON THE eve of the 1989 model year, we find ourselves handcuffed by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program - the CAFE rules.
This 1970's law was intended to deal with anticpated oil shortages, but now it threatens American jobs, diminishes consumer welfare and gives foreign auto makers an edge in the marketplace.


Heady Days for Junior Playwrights
LEAD: ''The play has helped me understand who I am in relation to my mom's suicide, and how important that really was to me,'' said Jonathan Marc Sherman, an 18-year-old from Livingston, N.J.

LEARNING HUMILIATION AT WRITER'S PREP
LEAD: It is to my friend Chris that I owe my experience at Writer's Prep, the now celebrated school for authors, because he wouldn't take no for an answer.
A novelist himself as well as an alumnus of the program, he had watched in horror when, several years ago, I went through the nightmare so many writers endure with the publication of a first book.


Sending Your Child to College: Grief or Relief?
LEAD: Last year, when my son went away to college, I cried bittersweet tears.
I felt that although this was a happy milestone, it marked the end of our little family as we'd known it for 18 years.
First we were four; now, with just our high school-aged daughter at home, we would be three.

Archbishop Pio Laghi, the Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States, performed the ceremony.


Movies, sports and familiar faces
LEAD: The schedules for the 1988-89 television season announced by the major networks last spring had a heavy dose of the familiar.
Television stars like Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, each long since removed from the domestic bliss that they shared as Rob and Laura Petrie from 1961 through 1966, would be returning to CBS; the recent hit films ''Baby Boom''(NBC) and ''Dirty Dancing'' (CBS) would be turned into weekly series, while old weekly series such as ''Get Smart'' (ABC), ''Mission: Impossible'' (ABC) and ''Marcus Welby, M.D.


Behind Barbed Wire
LEAD: Last month, President Reagan signed into law a national act of contrition for a grievous lapse in this country's cherished standards of liberty almost half a century ago: The wartime incarceration of more than 100,000 Japanese-American citizens and Japanese resident aliens in concentration camps.
The legislation provided for recompense of $20,000 to each surviving internee, whether citizen or alien, and, more significantly, an unprecedented apology by the United States Government.


A Place that Works at Finding Out Who's Where
LEAD: EVER wonder what the average sale price of a house in New Canaan is?
Or how many Asian auto body repairmen there are in Litchfield County?
Or what the dollar value is of groceries sold in Hartford?


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Field Hockey
LEAD: In the United States, field hockey is primarily a women's sport, but is played by both sexes in the rest of the world, especially in the former countries of the British Empire.
An Olympic sport for men since 1908, field hockey became one for women in 1980, when the United States boycotted the Games.


Car Rental
LEAD: To the Editor: We recently returned from a trip to California and Yosemite National Park.

Cyclist Disqualified
LEAD: He pedaled his way to a gold medal and a silver at the 1984 Olympics, but Steve Hegg won't be bringing home any cycling honors from Seoul.

View of Future in a 20-Room Museum
LEAD: So here I am, one block and maybe a couple of light years away from the apartment where I grew up.

REVISIONS SOUGHT

Albany's Battle Over Milk Industry Is Not Over Yet
LEAD: GOVERNOR CUOMO put an end last week to yet another battle affecting the state's dairy industry with a veto of one of the most controversial legislative measures of the year.

LEAD: The marriage of Susannah Fanshawe Dwight and James Pius Prout took place yesterday at the Roman Catholic Church of St.
Thomas More in New York.

Stan Moseley performed the ceremony.


High-Tech Rebel
LEAD: IT IS EARLY MORNING AND most of the top leaders of the nation's personal computer industry are jammed into a hotel banquet hall in Naples, Fla.
The annual, late-winter gathering is one that industry insiders can't afford to miss - 72 hours of closed-door deal-making, hushed corridor conversations about technologies gone amiss, and arguments over the future course of America's most visible high-tech industry.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  ABBOTT'S NEW YORK  Although Berenice Abbott began her artistic life as a would-be sculptor, it's as a photographer that she will be remembered, particularly as a photographer of New York City.


Where Swiss Carvers Put Life in Wood
LEAD: THE bucolic village of Brienz, often called the gateway to the Bernese Oberland, is also the center of Swiss woodcarving.
From here come most of the country's ubiquitous souvenir bears, as well as realistic animals and figures so artfully fashioned that sculpture would be an apt description.
Just up from the Hauptstrasse, which is lined with carvers' shops, lies


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Rowing
LEAD: In rowing, the stereotypical coxwain is the little fellow in the back of the boat exhorting the oarsmen to row harder for God and country. ''But it's not like that at all,'' said Seth Bauer, the cox of the United States' men's eight-oared crew. ''At the Olympic level, motivation is not an issue.
I have to have a feel of what's going on in the boat, to know when we're going fast and how to sustain that.


Don't Discard Summer's Bounty Yet
LEAD: EVEN though the orange glow of pumpkins is beginning to dot the fields around some farmstands, and baskets of crisp apples are already on sale, it's too early to discard summer's tastes.
The corn, peppers, tomatoes, peaches, eggplants and plums are still abundant.


ATOMIC TEST DATA WEAKEN U.S. VIEW
LEAD: Unexpected results from a recent Soviet-American experiment on monitoring nuclear tests have raised questions about the Reagan Administration's stance in negotiations over restrictions on such tests, some geologists say.


Yanks Beat Tigers For Third in a Row
LEAD: The season has been so riddled with reverses, so twisted with turmoil that the Yankees have really learned just one lesson during it: Nothing is for certain, not leads, not rosters, not the day-to-day hierarchy in the American League East.


Instead of a Shoe Box, Utilize the Albums
LEAD: NEW collectors are frequently baffled by the rich variety of albums designed to organize stamps, covers and other material.


The Real Issues
LEAD: What are the serious problems facing this country?

Hut to Hut In the White Mountains
LEAD: IN the Pinkham Notch base camp at the foot of Mount Washington, my son and I found we couldn't fit everything into our pack.
What to take, what to leave out?
It was a moment of reckoning.
While some people on vacation would find climbing to 6,000 feet a form of masochism, to us it was a way of determining the essentials, learning to travel light.


100-METER RIVALRY RUNS ON
LEAD: AS Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis moved into the blocks that afternoon at the world track and field championships last August in Rome, no one could have known the nature of what was to follow.
After all, these splendid sprinters had opposed each other at the same, 100-meter distance 13 other times, with neither pushing the other to any historic limits.


Public to Get Radioactive Waste Plan
LEAD: THIS week the state will publicly reveal its plans for establishing a dump for the 22 tons of low-level radioactive waste generated in Connecticut each year.


Harvesting A Vacation On the Loir
LEAD: MADAME'S dog has come down the dusty road and over a bed of dahlias to our Loir valley farmhouse for an early morning visit.
He crushes underfoot the last of the plums that have fallen from the tree at the corner of the low stone building, and sniffs like a connoisseur at the ruby grapes hanging from vines growing characteristically around our doorways.

LEAD: Tom Tom Club has reappeared in a new, compact lineup for its three-week stand at CBGB (315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street).
The group started in 1981 as an occasional sideline for Talking Heads' rhythm section - the drummer Chris Frantz and the bassist Tina Weymouth - and assorted friends and relatives, and the group came up with a hit single, ''Genius of Love,'' that led to two albums.


Just Disdain For Yankees
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Hispanic F.B.I. Agents' Suit Reflects a Sense of Betrayal

New Era in Burma
LEAD: 'There is wall-to-wall support for the establishment of genuine multiparty democracy in Burma.
The Government there has completely unraveled.
We are at the dawn of a new era, and it is very much in the interest of the United States to make it as clear as possible, as quickly as possible, that we are strongly on the side of democracy rather than dictatorship in Burma.


NONFICTION
LEAD:  RESTRUCTURING THE WORLD ECONOMY.
By Joyce Kolko. (Pantheon, Cloth, $24.95; Paper, $14.95.) For most economists the period from 1974 to the present is filled with inconsistencies, which Joyce Kolko does her best to explain from an orthodox Marxist perspective.
Much of the world during the mid-1970's and the first half of the 1980's was in a profound state of economic, financial and even agricultural crisis, as Ms.

Question Of the Week; What Do You Expect To See in the Olympics?
LEAD: I expect some success in track and field for the U.S. team.
Carl Lewis should win several medals, some gold included.
We have an excellent shot at a gold in the men's marathon, and the diving champion, Greg Louganis, should bring home the gold as well.
Gymnastics should be a bit of a problem with stiff competition from the Eastern bloc countries; specifically, the Russian, the Rumanian and the East

The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Yachting
LEAD: The yachting competition will be held off Pusan, a port city about 200 miles south of Seoul.
The conditions are expected to be windy; sailors who gathered there last September for a pre-Olympic regatta encountered breezes that ranged mostly from 15 to 25 knots.


To Miter Joints, Use a Backsaw
LEAD: FOR molding to present a neat appearance, individual pieces must be joined skillfully.
The technique most often used to accomplish this is mitering (cutting the ends of pieces off at an angle and joining them by placing the angled ends together).
Creating professional-looking miter joints requires practice; however, by working patiently with appropriate tools, even beginners can produce excellent miter joints after only a few tries.


Bruins Trounce Cornhuskers
LEAD: U.C.L.A. gave Nebraska a taste of California flash and a 41-28 trouncing before 84,086 tonight in the Rose Bowl.


Breaking Out of the Biotech Pack
LEAD: WHEN kidney dialysis patients taking part in the clinical trials of Amgen Inc.'s erythropoietin talk about the drug's impact on their lives, they tend to use words like ''wonderful'' and ''dramatic,'' with all the restraint of a carnival barker hawking snake oil.


TENSE TALK
LEAD: Reading Ben Yagoda's article brought back memories of my medical internship, when I was astounded to discover that even brain surgery is not that difficult.
Neurosurgery is more like real estate.
There are only three important things to remember in the human brain: location, location, location.
Once the skull is open, the tumor is resectable or not; the hematoma can be evacuated or not.


NEW JERSEY GUIDE
LEAD:  WRIGHTSTOWN AIR SHOW  The Thunderbirds, the Air Force aerial demonstration team and their F-16 fighters, will be the stars today of McGuire Air Force Base's annual air show, which last year drew 400,000 spectators.

THE WORLD'S ATHLETES UNITE IN A DIVIDED LAND
LEAD: IN the quiet of his office in Lausanne, Switzerland, not long ago, Juan Antonio Samaranch tried to remember how many countries he had visited in his tenure as president of the International Olympic Committee.
The total approached the number of nations invited to the Games of the XXIV Olympiad in Seoul, South Korea, and he seemed slightly embarrassed that he had not yet reached all 167.


Baseball Movies Turn Men to Mush
LEAD: The less one knows about baseball - and I happen to know less than almost anybody - the more one is apt to notice in movies about the game.
It can be wonderfully liberating to have little idea whether the rookie is really any good, whether the aging manager stands a chance of breathing new life into his career or whether the team has any hope of winning the pennant, since the attention is thus freed to concentrate on more pressing matters.

Mr.
Beard runs a nonprofit company that helps attract grants and designs plans to attract economic development.


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Table Tennis
LEAD: Table tennis, the newest Olympic sport, is hardly an obscure game.
Ping-Pong, as it is generally called in the United States, is believed to be the second most popular participation sport in the world after soccer, and even in the United States it is the most popular racquet sport, with an estimated 20 million players.


Boom Times for 'Thrift Doctors'
LEAD: THERE were days of intense negotiations that went on long into the night, and after it was all over, the most expensive rescue of a single savings and loan association was in place.

MILAN TONES DOWN
LEAD: Invention has traditionally been the operative word at the Salone Internazionale del Mobile, the world's most important furniture fair, which is held in Milan each September.

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:

The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Weight Lifting
LEAD: In weight lifting, there are separate competitions in 10 body-weight classes in which competitors weight from 114 pounds to over 242 pounds.
Competition in each weight class involves two kinds of lifts: one is the snatch, in which the bar is raised overhead in a single, unbroken motion; the other is the clean and jerk, in which the bar is first raised to chest level and then lifted overhead.


Ibram Lassaw: The Sculptor as Explorer
LEAD: The 60-year survey of the sculpture of Ibram Lassaw currently on view at the Guild Hall Museum sums up a body of work that will never rank very high in the annals of 20th-century art history.
At the same time, this show, which is titled ''Ibram Lassaw: Space Explorations,'' presents a long, dedicated career worthy of attention.


Book Talks to Look at Changing Values
LEAD: WHAT are some of the lasting effects of the 1960's?
How have families changed - and stayed the same - over the last 50 years?
Which Presidents since the Depression have had the greatest impact on American society?


Museum Celebrating Film Opens Its Doors in Queens
LEAD: Even the ribbon-cutting ceremony made it obvious: the debut of the American Museum of the Moving Image yesterday in Astoria, Queens, was not the usual ho-hum occasion marking the day when a cultural institution officially opens its doors.


Correction
LEAD: A picture caption on page 27 in some copies of the Arts and Leisure section today about the film ''Prince of Pennsylvania'' misidentifies theaters for the opening on Friday.

FULL OF BEENES
LEAD: At a time in fashion when most designers cautiously refrain from making pronouncements on the nature - and the future - of their craft, Geoffrey Beene remains as tartly outspoken as he was 15 years ago.
Then, he decreed, silhouette be damned, ''the challenge of any collection is the fabric.''


Diluted Satire in 'Middle Ages'
LEAD: ALTHOUGH the enterprising Penguin Repertory goes in for the new and the unfamiliar, it has a certain fondness for the plays of A. R. Gurney Jr., which seem to pop up every couple of seasons. ''The Middle Ages,'' which is playing at the Penguin's Barn Playhouse through Sunday, is the third of Mr.
Gurney's works to be seen here in six years - after ''What I Did Last Summer'' and ''The Dining Room.


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Shooting
LEAD: Olympic shooting's two newest events are men's and women's air pistol competitions, bringing the total to 13.
Though the various rifle, pistol and shotgun events have a larger following in Europe, Americans have done well over the years.


No More Bandits
LEAD: After four decades, Taiwan has modified the practice of referring to the People's Republic of China as a ''bandit'' regime.
Until August, all goods imported from the mainland had to be labeled as ''bandit goods.'' Now, according to the Free China Journal, they will be called ''products from the Chinese mainland'' or ''products from Communist China.


To Miter Joints, Use a Backsaw
LEAD: FOR molding to present a neat appearance, individual pieces must be joined skillfully.
The technique most often used to accomplish this is mitering (cutting the ends of pieces off at an angle and joining them by placing the angled ends together).
Creating professional-looking miter joints requires practice; however, by working patiently with appropriate tools, even beginners can produce excellent miter joints after only a few tries.

Having Won Trust Among Conservatives, The Candidate Is Free to Test the Middle

Julian Deeken performed the ceremony at Our Lady of Fatima Roman Catholic Church.


MUSIC: Operas and Organ Recitals
LEAD: When Harvey Lichtenstein opened the refurbished Majestic Theater last fall, two blocks from the Brooklyn Academy of Music, it was perceived as a New York home for Peter Brook and other innovative theater directors.
But now it is emerging as a concert hall and opera house as well.
Pierre Boulez's appearances there in June with the Ensemble Intercontemporain proved the excellence of its acoustics, and now a number of other musical and operatic events are being negotiated, not the least of which are the Metropolitan Opera's Brooklyn experimental seasons, starting in 1991.


Talking About Women, Not to Them
LEAD: THERE IS SOMETHING extremely peculiar about the messages women are getting this election year.
A rat, presented with the same set of contradictions, would simply keel over in its little maze, toes up, circuits blown.
Women are expected to press on and vote.


Views From Family Tables
LEAD: I USED to be a model tourist: I ordered coffees or Cokes and watched passers-by from sidewalk tables in cafes on Boulevard St.-Germain and Via Veneto; bargained gently for watches and cameras in Hong Kong or rugs and copper pots in North African souks.
Then I got better jobs and stayed in hotels that got starrier and starrier till one day I made it to the top of the firmament: a five-star deluxe.


Flunking the Motor Vehicle Test
LEAD: Q. WHAT is the rule of thumb for safe following distance on dry pavement? (On the way over here, on Route 4 in Teaneck, the traffic's moving along at 50. You can't leave more than 15 feet between you and the guy ahead before someone cuts in. It's worse up in Paramus.) It's a Friday afternoon in the summer.


A Return To the Past On Rosh ha-Shanah
LEAD: WHEN people ask me if these are my ''happy holidays'' or my ''sad ones,'' I really don't know where to begin.
So much of what makes a holiday happy or sad is often not the liturgical, official content of the day but the familiar context - how the surrounding song and dance make it seem in memory.


Administration Faults Dukakis on College Loans
LEAD: Reagan Administration officials in the Department of Education have criticized a new college loan proposal by Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis because the loan repayment plan would make graduates in high-paying careers subsidize the loans of those in low-paying ones.


Q and A
LEAD:  Young View


For Two Vietnamese Refugees in the U.S., Lost Families Are Found Again
LEAD: Nguyen Anh Tuan and Giui Thi Le could not believe their eyes, but somehow they were back in Southeast Asia.


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Canoeing/Kayaking
LEAD: In most Olympics, canoeing has seemed to be an after thought for the United States.
Americans have seldom reached finals, let alone won medals.
Now the United States has become a factor, not on the level of East Germany, but certainly in the next group, with Hungary, the Soviet Union and New Zealand.


TED KOPPEL'S EDGE
LEAD: I have always admired Ted Koppel's ''Nightline'' (''Ted Koppel's Edge,'' by Marshall Blonsky, Aug. 14).


OLD, OLD SCHOOL BUILDINGS
LEAD: IT was with a mixture of amusement and anger that I read a recent public relations bulletin issued by the Hewlett-Woodmere School Board.
It began:

POSTINGS: The New Linden; Commercial Push
LEAD: In a deal that could spur the transformation of Linden, N.J., from an industrial area to a commercial center, Hartz Mountain Industries has bought a 70-acre industrial park on Route 1 there for $30 million.
The transaction, completed late in August, is the largest in Union County this year, according to the broker, the Archie Schwartz


REACTIONARY MUSICAL MODERNISTS
LEAD: The most fascinating bit of musical journalism in recent weeks is an article by Richard Taruskin in the Sept. 5 New Republic entitled ''The Dark Side of Modern Music.'' Ostensibly a review of Harvey Sachs's book ''Music in Fascist Italy,'' it lays out biographical evidence indicating the Fascist, or at least authoritarian, tendencies of Stravinsky, Schoenberg and


Even Chicago Is Not Immune To Fashion
LEAD: For more than a decade now this city in which architecture is a subject of everyday conversation has been in a kind of identity crisis.
Chicago has always prided itself on being America's great city of modern architecture - the city in which the average person knew who Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe were and the average real-estate developer was expected as a matter of course to put up first-class modern buildings.

New works and old masters
LEAD: Modern dance by old and new trailblazers promises to be a highlight of this dance year.
The season gets off to a formal start when the Martha Graham Dance Company opens a three-week engagement at City Center (Oct. 4-23) with a gala featuring guest artists Mikhail Baryshnikov, Maya Plisetskaya and Kathleen Turner.


Museum Loans Add Zest To the Antiques Season
LEAD: Esoteric and exotic antiques - American washboards, African ivories, Indonesian artifacts and ancient Greek miniatures - dominate in the exhibitions to be presented at museums and galleries over the next several months.


SIENESE GOLD
LEAD: Siena sprawls across three rolling hills, a sleepy Italian city centuries past its prime.
Its Gothic cathedral and medieval town hall rise over the Tuscan countryside; palaces, now museums, house the poetic late medieval paintings and sculptures that distinguish this region's culture.


Obstacles Litter The P.L.O. Path To a Consensus
LEAD: The Palestine Liberation Organization's tortuous quest to achieve self-determination is meeting obstacles presented not only among Palestinian groups, but also by Syria, Israel and the United States.


NONFICTION
LEAD:  TO THE MEMORY OF CHILDHOOD.
By Lydia Chukovskaya.
Translated by Eliza Kellogg Klose. (Northwestern University, Cloth, $24.95; Paper, $9.95.) This memoir by the novelist and dissident Lydia Chukovskaya is a charming and powerful tribute to her father, Kornei Chukovsky, the Russian critic, translator and author.


SEASON PREVIEW: CLASSICAL RECORDS
LEAD: AFTER HALF A DOZEN YEARS IN WHICH THE classical record business took on new life as a result of the boom in compact disks, the competition both in classical sales and in pressing CD's has become fierce.


Amtrak
LEAD: To the Editor: Amtrak's cross-country service may be enchanting for William Borders and Nancy M. Debevoise, but for the commuter on Amtrak's crowded Northeast Corridor Boston to New York route, the ride is at best an inconvenience.
During the 1987 holiday season, Amtrak passengers who had paid the full $40-plus fare were forced to take commuter trains; I saw elderly citizens and families with small children endure the five-hour trip sitting on bags in the aisles.


INSIDE
LEAD:  A Shift in Zia Inquiry


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Track and Field
LEAD: More gold medals, 42, will be awarded in the Olympic track and field meet than in any other sport in the Games.
If events of the last 18 months are any indication, many of them will go to new world record-holders.


Penguin STages 'Middle Ages'
LEAD: ALTHOUGH the enterprising Penguin Repertory goes in for the new and the unfamiliar, it has a certain fondness for the plays of A. R. Gurney Jr., which seem to pop up every couple of seasons. ''The Middle Ages'' is the third of Mr.
Gurney's works to be seen here in six years - after ''What I Did Last Summer'' and ''The Dining Room.


Tamara Tunie Is Wed
LEAD: Tamara Renee Tunie, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
James W. Tunie of Homestead, Pa., was married in Pittsburgh yesterday to Gregory T. Bouquett, the son of Dr. and Mrs.
Gaston Bouquett of Dayton, Ohio.
The Rev.

About Books; Honk if You Love Lighthouses
LEAD: A couple of weeks ago I read in the newspaper that the 11 lighthouses in the United States that are still tended by keepers will be automated by the fall of 1989.
Well, I thought, there goes the last symbol.
There'll be no more ''To the Lighthouse,'' just as there'll be no more Don Quixote, because the windmills too are gone.


What's a Carpetbagger?
LEAD: Vice President Bush, who calls Texas home, continues to be hounded as a carpetbagger.
Polls suggest that more than half the registered voters in Texas don't think he is a ''real Texan.'' Of course, a lot of other people don't see Mr.
Bush as a Texan either, since by background he's obviously a Connecticut Yankee.


Corrections
LEAD: A chart last week with an article about election-year economies mislabeled the broken line on a graph.
It showed the number of employed workers.


Too Many Unchallenged Incumbents and Full Campaign Chests
LEAD: To the Editor:


Headliners; A Return
LEAD: Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware returned to tributes in the Senate last week after seven months during which he was operated on twice for brain aneurysms and once for a blood clot in a lung.
He said he bore no grudge against the Dukakis camp for the disclosures -principally that he had used the words of a British politician without attribution - that forced his withdrawal a year ago from the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination.


BACK TO HER AFRICA
LEAD:  HONEY FROM THE LION  An African Journey.
By Wendy Laura Belcher.  188 pp.
New York:  E. P. Dutton.


Summertime, and Some Livings, Aren't Easy
LEAD: I'VE spoken to quite a few people lately who, like me, spend their days in an office.
Even through the heat, they seem to recall fondly the days when employment commitments hinged on the summer season, and no job was too good to quit.


Two Jazz Veterans Work With New Recruits
LEAD: ''Master Mind,'' a thunderous piece by the saxophonist Greg Osby on Jack DeJohnette's newest recording, ''Audio-Visualscapes'' (Impulse!, MCA 8029, all three formats), begins and ends with an ominous, machinelike drumbeat.
In between, saxophone lines, radically disfigured by electronic instruments that double and triple the sound of the instruments, riff away unmercifully.


Mood of Caution Rules in the Post-Crash Market
LEAD: FIGURING that panic on Wall Street might deflate property prices throughout New York City, Douglas P. Klassen decided to halt his search for an apartment indefinitely when the stock market plummeted last October.


BASEBALL: American League; Clemens Fires 1-Hitter as Red Sox Beat Indians
LEAD: Roger Clemens held Cleveland hitless for seven and one-third innings today as the Boston Red Sox beat the Indians, 6-0, for their fifth victory in six games.


THE FROZEN ROOM
LEAD: A number of recent studies confirm that autopsies still discover unexpected major findings about 10 percent of the time.
The reason fewer of these examinations are done is that autopsies are not reimbursed by third-party payers.
Second, in these litigious times, when any less- than-perfect result can lead to years of involvement with the medicolegal system, many doctors prefer to bury their mistakes, and who can blame them?


Electrifying L.I.R.R.: Pluses and Minuses
LEAD: MIKE PERDIE, a Long Island Rail Road commuter from Rocky Point, has been driving to Ronkonkoma to catch the train to Manhattan ever since electric service on the Main Line began there early this year.


In the Heart of Literary London
LEAD: SEEING PEOPLE YOU KNOW OVER AND over again, in different contexts, happens so much in London that it characterizes the city in an essential way.
An old English woman once told me, when I asked her if there was anything in London that could be called society, ''No, and it's just as well, don't you think?


Ruth Sharp Wed To Robert Keilty, Insurance Broker
LEAD: Ruth Sloane Sharp, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Artist's Life: The Making of a 'Miracle'
LEAD: Stephen Huneck is a wood-carving artist who could be called an afternoon success.
The afternoon was in May 1984, when he quite unwillingly sold his first sculpture.


Still Fighting The Civil War
LEAD: ''OUR point,'' says the president of the Alabama chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, ''is that that flag can be flown at any time in any place except on public property.''


In Computer Behavior, Elements of Chaos
LEAD: AS computer systems continue to grow more complex, scientists are finding it increasingly difficult to accurately predict their behavior.


Heritage Hills: Another View
LEAD: Your article of Aug. 21 on Heritage Hills  [ ''The View From: Heritage Hills'' ]  gave an unbalanced description of life in this semiretirement complex.
As more and more young people purchase homes here this is a mixture of working and nonworking residents.
Certainly there are many here who think they have died and gone to heaven because of the availability of free tennis and swimming and other carefree activities but there are also many who, as volunteers, are giving much time and effort in hospitals, libraries, to people who are homebound, to literacy programs and other selfless activities.


Whistle Stops On the Rails To Siberia
LEAD: ''SAY goodbye to Moscow; you're going off to Siberia!'' It wasn't in keeping with glasnost, but with that announcement, our four-night train trip to Irkutsk began.
The overtones of ''going off'' started a nervous giggle.


Question Of the Week; What Do You Expect To See in the Olympics?
LEAD: I expect the Olympics to follow the pattern of the past - the usual bad feelings whenever there is physical contact and in all other competition, with suspicion of drug abuse, the prejudiced and incompetent - irrational official and judges decisions - the usual foul claims and disagreements and objections by biased coaches.


ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS BY BUSH CRITICIZED
LEAD: Senator Lloyd Bentsen accused the Republican Administration today of conducting a ''popgun war on drugs.'' He said that Vice President Bush had been responsible for leading this battle ''and he blew it badly.''

These reports further noted that the very highest ozone levels can be found immediately over Route 1.


Cone Fans 10 and Stops Expos on 7 Hits
LEAD: David Cone kept the Mets roaring through the homestretch tonight with more of the classic pitching that has sustained them all season.
He mastered the Montreal Expos by 6-0 and won for the 16th time against only three defeats.


IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: When Minutes Matter; How a Soviet Capsule Became Stuck in Space
LEAD: A Soviet and an Afghan astronaut were stranded in space last week when a malfunctioning navigation system interfered with the split-second calculations required for a successful landing.
On the third attempt, the Soyuz TM-5 capsule touched down safely in the Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan, leaving Soviet and American scientists to reconstruct the sequence of errors that led to a harrowing 25 hours.


Poised at the Turning Point
LEAD: I don't know what it actually takes to become a star,'' says the choreographer Agnes de Mille, ''but it is a matter of being given the opportunities and of having the tremendous courage to take those opportunities.
You have to have enough belief in yourself to do that, otherwise it's just coloring in the black and white.


Who Are Nonvoters, And Who Needs Them?
LEAD: THE quadrennial hand-wringing over the vast number of Americans who choose not to vote - nearly half the people who are eligible -has several new twists this year.

Back to School
LEAD: TEACHERS in the Ardsley Union Free School District were officially on the job by the end of August to prepare for the reopening of school last week.


Ailing Ashe in Hospital
LEAD: This was a special summer for Arthur Ashe.
In 1968, when tennis lifted the barriers to professionals, he won the first United States Open, becoming the first black man to win a Grand Slam event.
But Ashe hasn't had a chance to celebrate the 20th anniversary.
He is in New York Hospital, undergoing tests to determine why his right side became numb last week.


Behind the Fun
LEAD: To the Editor:


P. A. Parent Weds Miss Trowbridge

Grain and Soybean Crops Are Dealt an Extra Blow
LEAD: Several spells of intense heat have inflicted additional damage on the nation's already drought-ravaged grain crops in the last month, leading agricultural analysts say, and a tiny parasite has aggravated the harm the drought has done to critically important soybean yields.


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Modern Pentathalon
LEAD: Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the French nobleman who founded the modern Olympics in 1896, designed the modern pentathlon to give soldiers something better to do than wage war.
It didn't work.
The sport made its debut at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912, two years before the outbreak of World War I. The competition features five events in five days.


B. N. Pyne, Jersey Orchestra Official, And Janet Eaton Auchincloss Marry
LEAD: At St.
James's Episcopal Church in New York, Janet Eaton Auchincloss, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Virtually Unbeatable: Stefanie Maria Graf
LEAD: The promising 14-year-old tennis player had torn the tendons in her thumb, falling on the grass courts during practice, forcing her to withdraw from the Australian Open.

No Sabotage Clues Seen in Zia Crash
LEAD: Nearly four weeks after Pakistan's President, Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, and the United States Ambassador to that country were killed when a Pakistani Air Force plane crashed in eastern Pakistan, Pakistani and American investigators have so far found no conclusive evidence that a missile or a bomb was responsible.


Magazines With Older Readers and Eager Advertisers
LEAD: THE advertisements are for Chanel and Chevrolet as well as hearing aids and ''a face lift without surgery, at last!'' Articles chronicle a leisure cruise to the Antarctic and include an interview with Shere Hite, who writes about human relationships.


Answering The Mail
LEAD:  Q. We have a ceramic tile floor in our bathroom consisting of one-inch square tiles.
The floor is even and in good condition, but it is not attractive, and so we would like to put down new ceramic tile.
Can we put new tile on top of the existing tile, or must we rip up all the old tile first?


Review/Music; Eclectix Performs New Works
LEAD: With two brief exceptions, Friday's program by Eclectix at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church offered music about other music.
In keeping with its title, this new-composers group takes its styles where it finds them, but it does seem to be looking in a few specific places.
Thus most of this repertory grew out of a tonal, melody-accompaniment tradition, and a lot of it by way of American popular culture.


IN THE WAKE OF BOYCOTTS, SOVIETS PLAN TO WIN
LEAD: WHILE the Los Angeles Olympics were going on four years ago, Vladimir Geskin, the foreign editor of the newspaper Sovietski Sport, was in Tallin, the capital of Estonia.


Many Need 2 Jobs for One Life's Bills
LEAD: FOR many jobholders, for many reasons, one is not enough.
A schoolteacher by day becomes a theater usher by night.
A secretary from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. becomes a nurse's aide from 6 P.M. to midnight.
A full-time firefighter is also a part-time coffee grinder.
And the list goes on.
There are thousands of Connecticut residents who moonlight - work a part-time job in addition to a full-time job - in order to make ends meet or maintain their styles of life.


IN THE NEW YORK REGION: Connecticut; On a Thames Bluff in Norwich, 300 Units With a Day-Care Center By ELEANOR CHARLES

34&gt;A Mother's Lessons Not Fully Learned
LEAD: ''YOU'RE not to do it, understand?
I don't want you to go there tonight.
It's a dangerous neighborhood.
You'll get stuck in traffic, and you'll come home late and I'll worry about you.
Don't go!''


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Swimming
LEAD: Track and field may have Carl Lewis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Edwin Moses and all those other glamorous athletes.
Gymnastics may have all those doll-like successors to Olga and Nadia and Mary Lou.
But if you like to see Americans win Olympic medals, swimming will be the sport to watch in Seoul.


A Chip Off Old Rodgers Block
LEAD: The play seemed hauntingly familiar.


Having Money Does Not Make One 'Nice'
LEAD: I have to take exception to the article ''Full Life, Empty Values'' by Linda Gass (Opinion page, Aug. 21).
I, too, live in the same community as Ms.
Gass.
However, I do not feel the same way she does.
My children have been taught, not that appearances are important, but rather that if they work hard and try to be good people they have a better chance of achieving their goals and dreams than if they think everything just comes to them on a silver platter.


Wagner Is Routed In Season Opener
LEAD: Chris Warren scored touchdowns on runs of 37, 20 and 5 yards yesterday as Ferrum College routed Wagner, the defending National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III champion, 40-13, at Fischer Field on Staten Island.


About Chess Moves
LEAD: The New York Times has converted its method of chessboard notation to the algebraic system, in which each square is unambiguously identified by file letter and rank number.
Explanations of the system are available from the Chess Column, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.


Children of Flatbush Adjust to Palm Trees and Poi
LEAD: Separated from their birthplace by 4,969 miles, six time zones and a culture gap that can seem as broad as the Pacific Ocean, former Brooklynites who have settled here might be excused if they occasionally long for the shores of Coney Island.


Man Who Set Himself Afire as Protest Dies
LEAD: A 32-year-old Iranian who poured gasoline over his clothing and set himself afire across from the United Nations died early yesterday.

The 'Safest' Ship Was the Titanic
LEAD: When people like Ross Fleisig (''Nuclear Phobia Over Shoreham,'' Aug. 21) - citing all manner of safety systems - insist that Chernobyl couldn't happen here, I remind them that the world's safest ship, the Titanic - with all manner of safety systems - was unsinkable.
BEN CALDERONE  Levittown


American accents are back in style
LEAD: The British tidal wave will subside this season.
No large musicals are scheduled to sail across the Atlantic, unless one includes ''Legs Diamond,'' a multinational creation, composed by and starring Peter Allen as the title gangster.
Maggie Smith is to arrive in Peter Shaffer's ''Lettice and Lovage,'' her West End comedy vehicle, with her London co-star, Margaret Tyzack.

Moyers Designs A Talk Show ForThinkers
LEAD: There are those who say that the intellectual guides, the figures of learning and probity who enlightened the public during such times as elections campaigns, are gone, replaced by flashy media pundits better able to make a fetching image on camera than to reflect on the wisdom of the ages.
Bill Moyers, a rare television pundit of a less flashy, more probing stripe, agrees that modern times have been hard on what the British used to call pop dons.


Young Man With a Sax
LEAD: AS A FOOTBALL STAR AT Palisades High School in Los Angeles, Forest Whitaker was eagerly recruited by colleges that wanted to armor their defensive lines with his 6-foot, 2-inch, 245-pound body.
A gifted tenor, Mr.
Whitaker also received a scholarship in music.
When a Hollywood agent saw him in a professional production of ''The Beggar's Opera'' and urged him to audition for a movie, the 20-year-old college student promptly got the part.


Jets' President Is Learning the Playbook
LEAD: Steve Gutman will not be wearing short pants today, not in the visitors' v.i.p. box at Cleveland Stadium, where the Jets face the Browns.


Folk-rock, pop-soul and the prince of funk
LEAD: As pop music moves back indoors, arenas in the New York area are offering an unusually inviting array of pop, rock and soul talent.
From the freewheeling West Coast folk-rock of the Grateful Dead (beginning Friday) to the glitzy merry-go-round pop of Elton John, due Oct. 17, Madison Square Garden will be a busy musical hub.


Supermarkets: Tales From the Underground
LEAD: RISING rents for ground floors are forcing Manhattan supermarkets underground.
Leading the way is a Gristede's that will open in December beneath the Boulevard, a 300-unit condominium that is nearing completion on Broadway at 86th Street.


IN THE NATION: Seattle; A New Community of 660 Homes To Sit Atop an Interstate Highway
LEAD: SINCE Seattle already has built a park and a convention center over a freeway, it seems appropriate that the next big residential project to be developed here will be erected over eight lanes of Interstate 90.

Faked Russian Maps Gave the Germans Fits
LEAD: To the Editor:


ART IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
LEAD: Like many self-taught artists, Perle Hessing didn't begin to paint until she was well into middle age.
Her art has served her as a way to reconstruct and preserve the spiritual fabric of her life, which began in a provincial Galician town in 1908.
While A MIRROR TO MY LIFE (Holt, $29.95) reproduces in color more than 90 of the paintings Mrs.


Irked by Delays, Commuter Fights Back
LEAD: MARTIN P. HACKER says he has always considered himself a private man of simple tastes, never one to mix in politics, certainly not somebody who would single-handedly do battle with a giant commuter railroad authority.


NO PLACE LIKE HOME
LEAD: There are some dishes that - no matter how appealing - will never be served in a restaurant.
And vice versa.


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Cycling
LEAD: The 1984 American harvest of nine gold medals, and Greg LeMond's 1986 victory in the Tour de France, have stimulated cycling interest in the United States, among participants and spectators.
But this time, the Soviet Union, East German and other Eastern bloc riders will be competing.
And LeMond and other male professionals are not eligible for the Olympics.


TED KOPPEL'S EDGE
LEAD: Richard N. Kaplan, executive producer of ''Nightline,'' explains the reason for Ted Koppel's practice of not letting those he interviews have eye contact with him: ''To watch yourself talk out of synch is mind-boggling.''

TENNIS COMPETITORS PROS IN NAME, FACT
LEAD: THERE will be no mistaking who they are and how they came to afford fancy cars and all the modern conveniences.

The tennis players who are coming to Seoul, South Korea, are professionals by any definition the International Olympic Committee chooses to use.


Living the Life Of a Bostonian On Beacon Hill
LEAD: HENRY JAMES called it the most proper street in Boston, and it rises straight as an ascendant arrow in eastward flight from Storrow Drive and the river embankment.
It crosses Charles Street (once a shoreline of the Charles River estuary before history and real estate ambition and landfill turned it into the boundary between Beacon Hill and the Back Bay) and here Mount Vernon Street is deflected ever so slightly toward the southeast.

LEAD: Emily Ann Egan, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Gymnastics

Children Aloft
LEAD: To the Editor: I read, with great interest, your article on children who fly alone (Practical Traveler, July 24).


Checking It Out At the Grocery
LEAD: The story entitled ''At the Grocery, I Was the One Checked Out'' (Opinion page, Aug. 14) sounds apocryphal to me.
Getting locked up in an office by a giant who spied a card in a pocket?
Being looked upon by another shopper as a possible drug dealer?
Sure, hyperbole in a humorous piece is a good tool, but it just doesn't wash here.


A New Team Speeds Mamet's 'Plow'
LEAD: From the New York Times, Aug. 8, 1988:


POSTINGS: Park Slope Project; Building into a Low-rise Neighborhood
LEAD: In Park Slope, the brownstones are the prime properties; the restorers are busy, and the builders are highly revered and generally dead.
Several residential buildings have been started recently on the western and southern fringes of the prosperous Brooklyn neighborhood, but a $9 million condominium, Sterling Court, at 100 Sterling Place between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, will be the first new construction in the core of Park Slope in years.


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Volleyball
LEAD: There is little doubt that it will require a huge upset for the United States' men's team to surrender the gold medal it won in 1984 in Los Angeles.
The American men had never won a major tournament before, but since Los Angeles it has built itself into something of a dynasty, winning at the World Cup and the world championships and the gold medal at the Pan American

Lessons in perspective, partly in Italian
LEAD: The 1988-89 art season has a rare urgency.

Elizabeth's Roman Catholic Church in Wyckoff, N.J.


A Big Battle Over Computer Buses
LEAD: THE attention of the computer industry is soon to be riveted once again on the Byzantine inner roads of the PC, specifically the internal data path known as the bus.
The mind-numbing technical debate over a bus standard warrants study, because it could affect corporate computer buying decisions into the 1990's.


Its Time for Us to Stop Abusing Our Environment
LEAD: IT used to be that the weather was something to talk about casually, in passing, as a prelude to more important topics like the stock market or Presidential politics.
We laughingly complained about the heat or the rain but endured them because, after all, they were natural events over which we had no control.


At Seafood Event, an Undercurrent of Worry
LEAD: The second annual New Jersey Seafood Festival was held at this seaside resort today, and though the seascape was serene, the festival itself was awash with concerns and conflicting views about the danger that pollution poses, or does not pose, to fish and to people who eat fish.

LEAD: Having missed the 5:45 P.M. ferry to Staten Island by two minutes on Friday, your faithful dance critic waited around for the 6:45.

Rot at the Top
LEAD: THERE'S AN OLD Greek saying,'' said Michael Dukakis, responding to a question about whether President Reagan and Vice President Bush could be held personally accountable for their Administration's ethical lapses, ''a fish rots from the head first.
It starts at the top.'' This scrupulously bipartisan column takes no position on the accuracy of any political accusation, but is ready to examine the roots of all colorful adages used in campaigns.


WHAT'S DOING IN: Cincinnati
LEAD: Some 200 years ago, a party of 24 men and nearly a dozen families settled on the banks of the Ohio River in a place called Losantiville.
Two years later, in what is now testimony to the ease with which whims could be satisfied on the frontier, Gen.
Arthur St.
Clair, Governor of the Northwest Territory, decided he didn't like the name.


Pledge Dispute Evokes Bitter Memories
LEAD: When Marie Snodgrass and Gatha Edmonds think of the Pledge of Allegiance, what comes to mind is neither a patriotic ritual nor the 1988 Presidential campaign.
Instead, it conjures up indelible childhood memories of traumatic times that helped shape American constitutional law.


Frankfurt and Tokyo Take Control
LEAD: THE United States has lost control of its financial markets to foreigners and has run out of easy policy options to regain it.
The American financial tune is no longer being called in New York, but rather in Tokyo, London and Frankfurt.
In fact, this loss of control had a lot to do with the timing of the stock market crash last fall.


Armenia and Its Neighbors Only Diverge
LEAD: ONE balmy evening several days ago on the plaza outside the city opera house, a group of Armenians were playing Yerevan's favorite guessing game: What if Armenia broke off from the Soviet Union and declared its independence?


To Miter Joints, Use a Backsaw
LEAD: FOR molding to present a neat appearance, individual pieces must be joined skillfully.
The technique most often used to accomplish this is mitering (cutting the ends of pieces off at an angle and joining them by placing the angled ends together).
Creating professional-looking miter joints requires practice; however, by working patiently with appropriate tools, even beginners can produce excellent miter joints after only a few tries.

On College Costs: A Presidential Idea

Under a Roof Of Thatch In the Jungle
LEAD: WE wanted to see a part of the Amazon jungle, that vast wilderness of land and water that makes up more than a third of the South American continent.
We weren't hikers or campers.
On the other hand, neither were we interested in boating on the Amazon River, where we feared we'd see more cruise ships than anything else.


Another Mosquito To Worry About
LEAD: AS MOSQUITOES go, the Asian tiger is not only exceptionally aggressive, but also a carrier of serious diseases.

An Affable Provocateur
LEAD: RICHARD GREENBERG is a nice guy from Long Island who writes funny plays that often provoke what he calls ''strange, hostile questions.'' He is still rattled by one that was thrown at him last year during a post-performance audience discussion of ''The Maderati,'' his brittle sendup of today's young literati that in another day might have sprung from the pen of Dorothy Parker or Clare Boothe Luce.


Don't Discard Summer's Bounty Yet
LEAD: EVEN though the orange glow of pumpkins is beginning to dot the fields around some farmstands, and baskets of crisp apples are already on sale, it's too early to discard summer's tastes.

The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Team Handball
LEAD: It's not like one-wall handball in a Brooklyn playground or four-wall handball in an exclusive Manhattan club.
The Olympic sport of handball, also known as team handball, is an indoor sport in which the idea is to throw a ball into a net.

The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Diving

AN EPIC GROWS IN BROOKLYN
LEAD: Imagine an undulating sea monster, a woman walking a pet lobster, slithering animals with daggers in their mouths, a moon crushing a hero's chest and giving birth to a meteor, a naked prostitute seducing a hairy animal-man, a huge metallic room slowly filling with trees, a dragon that swallows a man and an icy field with a consuming fire on the horizon - all accompanied by speech and song and swelling instrumental music that evokes 19th-century


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Water Polo
LEAD: In 1980, when the United States water polo players felt sure they would win the Olympic gold medal, the American boycott kept them home.
In 1984, they tied Ygoslavia for first place and lost the gold because of a tie-breaking rule (goal differential) that has since been abolished.

STREETSCAPES: The Russian Tea Room; Sweet Deals Fail to Tempt
LEAD: WITH a knife edge of Harry Macklowe's 78-story Metropolitan Tower on one side and the rising superstructure of Carnegie Hall Tower on the other, the Russian Tea Room on West 57th Street east of Seventh Avenue is Manhattan's newest holdout, a five-story, brownstone peanut of a building whose owners have so far resisted temptations to sell out.


Headliners; A Promotion
LEAD: Only in America could a mere Ivy League president and Renaissance scholar become the commissioner of baseball.
Last week, A. Bartlett Giamatti, who left as head of Yale two years ago to become president of the National League, was elected to the five-year term by the 26 major league club owners.
He will replace Peter Ueberroth April 1.


Seeking a Job In a Labor Shortage

Raising the Odds
LEAD: WINNING MONEY, fame and status in Hollywood is never easy.
The quickest overnight success usually takes years.
But there are always a few actors, directors, producers - and even a few movie executives - who insist on making it harder.
They handicap themselves by making unconventional choices.
Those who depart from whatever formulas are in fashion may end up with terrible mistakes, but their movies won't be boring.

There is nothing incongruous about this: After all, the Music


In the Dakotas, a Bad Year and Worse Memories
LEAD: ''The dawn came, but no day.
In the gray sky a red sun appeared, a dim red circle that gave a little light, like dusk; and as the day advanced, the dusk slipped back toward darkness, and the wind cried and whimpered over the fallen corn.'' - John Steinbeck, ''The Grapes of Wrath''

The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Fencing

The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Boxing
LEAD: At the United States Olympic trials in July, Ed Hopson, a featherweight (125-pound limit) who had endeared himself to the crowds with his perpetual-motion aggression, earned a berth in the Olympic boxoffs the following week.
There, he had to win only once against Kelcie Banks, a boxer in the classic style, to make the Olympic team, but on successive days


When North Looks Better Than South
LEAD: IF a partnership is unbalanced, with one player clearly a better cardplayer, there is a tendency to maneuver the bidding so that he, or she, can be the declarer.
Provided this is not carried too far, the better player will play more than his share with a profitable effect on the score.

LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.

We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


Practical Traveler; Cash or Credit? Saving Money On Bills Abroad
LEAD: WHAT'S the most economical way to pay your expenses on an overseas trip?
The answer is parallel to the old saw about success in the stock market: Buy low, sell high.
That is to say, when considering whether to convert dollars or traveler's checks into the local currency to buy things, or to use a credit card and pay later, your goal should be to pay at the moment when the dollar is worth the most in terms of the currency involved.


Buddy movies with a twist - and more
LEAD: There are no superheroes to be found on this season's schedule, and not many small-town schoolteachers, either.
Normal behavior - normal by the movies' standards, anyhow -will not be well represented.
Jeremy Irons, who will play twin psychotic, drug-addicted gynecologists in ''David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers,'' may have the role (or roles) that best captures the spirit of the season.


Staying in Stocks, but Cutting the Risk
LEAD: AS the anniversary of Black Monday approaches, investors are reviewing their stock portfolios, assessing the past year's performance and charting a course for the future.

LEAD: WORK is set to begin soon on a $105 million project to create 530 residential units and 125,000 square feet of office and retail space in a five-block area of downtown New Haven.


The Amazon's Kettle of Fish
LEAD: THE vast web of waterways that make up the Amazon - rivers, lakes, swamps, streams, waterfalls, bayous and igapos or flooded forest land - are, as Brazilians put it, peixoso or full of fish.
Fish is the principal source of protein for Indians living in the Amazon region as well as for the caboclos, descendants of a mixed population of Europeans and Indians who farm and fish in the more populated and accessible areas near Manaus, the capital city of the state of Amazonas.

For Congress From New York
LEAD: New York City Democrats so outnumber Republicans that a victory in the Democratic primary usually means election.
In four races for Congress in Thursday's primary, voters will have even less choice than usual.


Thomas Loses Bid
LEAD: What worked on Friday for his teammate Richard Dent didn't work yesterday for Calvin Thomas.

Rabbi Philip J. Bentley and Cantor Marvin Antosofsky officiated.


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Tennis
LEAD: It could easily be just another tournament on the globe-trotting tennis tour, the Korean Open for the men, the Virginia Slims of Seoul for the women.
Setting this tournament apart, though, is that it is part of the Olympic spectacle.
It is the first time in 64 years that ennis players will compete for a gold medal.

Don't Discard Summer's Bounty Yet

Bronx Program Creates Teacher From Illiterate
LEAD: Carmen Malpica remembers Jan. 5, 1986, very well.

TENSE TALK
LEAD: Ben Yagoda's article ''Tense Talk'' (On Language, Aug. 14) notes the tendency among many professionals to take solace in the fact that what they do is not brain surgery.

ploring What It Means to Be Canadian
LEAD: Earlier this summer when the Edmonton Oilers sold Wayne Gretzky, the hockey virtuoso who is also probably the world's best-known Canadian, to the Los Angeles Kings, many, perhaps most, of his countrymen were hurt and some truly mourned.
His departure injured the nation's self-esteem and aroused thoughts of apostasy and betrayal.


POSTINGS: Round the Station; Just the Ticket for Commuters
LEAD: SoNo is neither SoHo nor NoHo, the neighborhoods south and north of Houston Street in Manhattan, nor is it the invention of rampaging neighborhood-namers.
SoNo is South Norwalk, a harborside district of Norwalk, Conn., that has what some see as a trackside gold mine.


Canadians Return to Town Evacuated in PCB Fire

Open Victory Gives Graf a Grand Slam
LEAD: It took a 19-year-old West German with a rapier forehand to give the National Tennis Center the tradition it lacked, and perhaps even some needed dignity.

Though recognizing the many differences between humans and animals, they think they have similar and transferable souls.


Nicholas Nixon Seeks a Path to the Heart
LEAD: There are two apparently polar but equally valid ways of looking at Nicholas Nixon's photographs.
His images are remarkable demonstrations of how the traditional (and by now archaic) tools of the medium - a view camera, black-and-white film, contact prints - can be used to venture into uncharted artistic territory.

In this collection's title piece, a man writes to a woman he knew in the third grade, trying to figure out why there is ''a black vacuum at the center of his life.'' ''It remains one of  [ Marianne ]  Wiggins's most striking achievements that in making us see her characters' humanity, she also compels us to acknowledge our shared yearnings and sense of loss,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The


NEW YORKERS, Etc.
LEAD: SOMETIMES you can't win.
That's to be expected, but the no-win situations seem to come with increasing frequency.
No matter how agreeable you are, no matter how winning or open your smile, no matter how pleasant and sincere your ''Good morning,'' you are met with a stone wall.
Well, not really a stone wall, but a stone face.


Shubert Role Expands with Opera
LEAD: WE call it the Shubert, but the theater in New Haven is actually the Shubert Performing Arts Center and it presents its own ballet and theater seasons.
Now, it has added opera.

Rehnquist's Court: Tuning Out the White House
LEAD: CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM HUBBS REHNQUIST stared stonily out at the crowd in the marble-columned chamber from the Supreme Court's center chair, the chair in which Ronald Reagan had put him two years before.
It was June 29, the last day of the Court's 1987-88 term, and one decision remained to be handed down - the big one.

LEAD: Labor Day marks the beginning of the Presidential campaign.
The conventions are over, the lazy days of August past.


THE FROZEN ROOM
LEAD: I enjoyed John Stone's article ''The Frozen Room'' (Body and Mind: Aug. 7), but I strongly disagree with his statement that autopsies are less needed now that ''more accurate premortem diagnosis is possible.'' The data don't bear that out.
It is only through the autopsy that we test the accuracy of our premortem diagnosis, see the additional diagnoses that we didn't think of, and maintain our humility.


On Emergency Care For Injured Pets
LEAD: In the article ''Emergency Pet Care'' [ Aug. 21 ] , it was stated that the County Animal Clinic provided the only 24-hour emergency care in Westchester for injured pets.
This statement is far from accurate.
Dr.
Theodore Hoch and Dr.
Arnold Remson provide 24-hour emergency service at the Yorktown Animal Hospital, at 271 Veterans Road in Yorktown Heights.


Car Stereo Trolls for a Shapely Bass
LEAD: The unconventional Lord Berners (1883-1950) - quite an accomplished English composer - had the cows on his estate painted different colors for different seasons.
He also had a harpsichord built into his chauffeured Rolls-Royce, because he liked to have music on his travels.
No doubt he would have delighted in a modern car stereo system bringing him highway Haydn or


Civil Rights Groups Are Redefining Their Job
LEAD: THE National Association for the Advancement of Colored People still sometimes engages in battles that recall the height of the civil rights era.
Last week, for example, its Mississippi branch picketed and boycotted schools in Greenville in protest of policies it believes are racist.

The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Judo (Men's)
LEAD: The modern form of judo, consisting of throws, hold-downs, choking techniques and armlocks, was introduced in Japan in 1882 by Jigaro Kano, a student of jujitsu, the martial art that predated judo.
In 1964 judo became an Olympic sport in - appropriately - Tokyo.
The Japanese have dominated the sport until recently, when several European countries and South Korea began to produce formidable competitors.

CHINA PRODUCING NEW WAVES OF YOUNG DIVERS

LEAD: After more than five years as the principal spokesman for private business in Nicaragua, Enrique Bolanos Geyer relinquished his post this week but promised to remain in Nicaragua and continue his anti-Sandinista militance.


The Joys and Hassles Of Remodeling a Home
LEAD: SOONER or later it seems to happen to most middle-class house owners.
The kitchen looks dingy and old-fashioned, the house gets smaller as the kids get bigger, and anyway, a lot of the neighbors seem to be adding new familiy rooms off the living room, sun rooms off the master bedroom and decks off the dining room.


Audrey Mathias to Wed
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Mr. and Mrs.
Michael D. Mathias of Scarsdale, N.Y., of the engagement of their daughter Audrey Elise Mathias to Steven Wayne Winter, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

THE WORLD: The Left's Loss; Where Liberation Was a Dream, Other Visions Ascend
LEAD: A QUARTER of a century ago, revolutionary Algeria, having wrenched its independence from France in a bloody armed struggle, was a heroic beacon to those fighting for freedom elsewhere.

CALIFORNIA ABSTRACT
LEAD: Richard Diebenkorn is by general consent a painter much loved and not like any other, but he does not look like most people's idea of an artist.
If we were told that he was the head of the department of moral philosophy at an ancient and low-key university, we would have no trouble believing it.
He has the large, heavy-framed glasses, the well-cut tweed jackets (neither old nor new), the corduroy pants of standard cut, the capacious and comfortable shoes and a general air of continuous but soundless rumination.

Can we put new tile on top of the existing tile, or must we rip up all the old tile first?


The Games, From Archery to Yachting: Demonstration Sports - Judo (Women's)
LEAD: Women's judo became an Olympic sport largely through the efforts of a Brooklyn woman, Rusty Kanokogi, who, after her marriage to a Japanese judoka - a judo fighter - in 1964, became a crusader for women in the sport.
She organized the first world championships for women, a prerequisite for consideration on the Olympic agenda, in 1980 with 149 athletes from 27 countries.


Abundance of Seafood in Sayville
LEAD: LONG ISLAND should have a multitude of restaurants like Stevie Ray's Seafood Restaurant in Sayville.

In the distance, one sees the blue silhouette of a modern city that, as yet, has not imposed its needs on the people living here.

Time, as it always is in such fiction, is running out.

Customers, for whom theatergoing is not priority No. 1 can get on to other diversions in a hurry, and management has the chance to increase grosses by putting on two shows a night.

LEAD: It is not within the power of architecture to guarantee that we have a good time - except, perhaps, at Wrigley Field.

Global Warming
LEAD: To the Editor:


BBottle Law: When Can Becomes Can't
LEAD: ME-VT-CT-MA-NY REFUND 5.
When I first encountered this obscure message it did not strike a chill in my heart.
There was no foreboding, only a smug sense of participating in a virtuous and civilized system.
To be precise, the message did not at that time include NY; perhaps it read only ME-VT-CT, or something of the kind.


First Liver Transplant in New York Performed
LEAD: The Mount Sinai Medical Center has become the first hospital in New York State to perform a liver transplant.

THE SEOUL OLYMPICS: TV Sports; NBC's Coverage Captures the Color, but Not the Fun
LEAD: In its zeal to Get That Story, along with its phobia of seeming like a flag-waver, NBC-TV opened its Olympic coverage by combining the joy of the event with a certain heavy portentousness.


HANDS-ON STYLE
LEAD: For many men, a manicure is a supreme but necessary indulgence, even an inexpensive thrill.
Some desire short, meticulously groomed nails for professional reasons; others enjoy the soothing qualities of the experience.
For instance, Charlie Rosner, creative director for a New York City advertising agency, favors very short nails for drawing, and delights in his periodic pilgrimages to Manhattan's Gio Hair Stylists because the manicurists there, he says, ''are kind enough to give me half an hour of complete silence once every 10 days to two weeks.

THE AGGRESSORS
LEAD: Just when so many of us had begun to hope that biological determinism had fallen out of fashion, Melvin Konner informs us in ''The Aggressors'' (Body and Mind, Aug. 14) that biological imperatives compel men to behave more violently than women.
It is such a tired argument that one might have assumed it would not be dragged out unless there were new evidence.


My Birth And the Great Hurricane of '38
LEAD: WITH a mighty and explosive burst, the wind split the giant elm, sending it crashing through the garage; the lights went out, the trolleys stopped and my whole birthday party was forced to sleep over.
It was 1945, the night of my seventh birthday.
It was a night of cozy excitement and as the wind whistled, my family sat around the candle-lit kitchen table.

IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: A Voice From Yellowstone; 'Neither Fire Suppression Nor Natural Burn Is A Sound Scientific Option'
LEAD: NOW that cool, damp weather has thankfully come to Yellowstone, the giant fires raging out of control in and around the park during the last several months have finally slowed.

NEW YORKERS, Etc.

HIS OWN BIG PICTURE
LEAD: Stuart Davis (1892-1964) was an artist whose biography is that of American 20th-century art.
It is not that Davis was at the center of the mainstream art world.
Rather, as we learn in Karen Wilkin's book STUART DAVIS (Abbeville, $85), a lavishly illustrated and handsome coffeetable volume, he was an important and representative figure, one who started in the socially conscious Ashcan School tradition and became an outstanding Cubist.

LEAD: There was anguish in Chelsea in the 1960's when the United States Postal Service wanted to build a maintenance center for its trucks on the site of its Morgan annex on Ninth Avenue at 29th Street.
Opposition killed the plan.
But the need remained, and the Postal Service looked elsewhere.
Eventually, more hospitable territory was found to the west.


Review/Music; Mehta, Webern and Schoenberg
LEAD: It is rough on the symphony orchestras of America that they should play best a repertory for which few of their subscribers want to pay.
The presence of Webern's ''Six Pieces for Orchestra'' on the New York Philharmonic's first subscription concert of the season Friday evening no doubt played its part in keeping the hall appreciably less than full.

LEAD: Amy Barrett Avellone, a daughter of Mrs.

Avellone, was married yesterday to Dr.

Pre-Abstract Expressionist Artist
LEAD: IF Abstract Expressionism was the atom bomb of art, maybe the revival of artists eliminated by the explosion can be likened to the rebirth of the natural environment.
In any case, they keep coming, these pre-bomb artists, and, as someone recently remarked to the reviewer, it's as if they, or the historians espousing them, are scurrying to beat the deadline of the century's end.


Gem Collecting
LEAD: To the Editor: In response to B. R. of Brooklyn (Q &amp; A, July 10) requesting information on tours for gem collecting:

THE NATION: U.S. Plan on Hold; Suddenly, Nuclear Waste Looks Very Visible Again
LEAD: ALMOST half a mile beneath the desert in southern New Mexico, Federal engineers believe they have found a solution for disposing of nuclear waste that is as eternal, as elemental and as invisible as the atom itself.

How Different Are the Famous From the Faces In the Crowd?
LEAD: The famous are different from you and me - they receive more attention.

Lessons Learned In Youth Have
LEAD: FOR A DANCE WRITER, ONE OF the unpredictable pleasures of interviewing is that moment when, without fanfare, words tumble out of a dancer or choreographer that offer a fresh or codifying insight into a body of work, a career or dance itself.

LEAD: Hempstead House is falling down.
Decay is not visible on the outside, with seemingly immutable granite and limestone walls, or on the inside, with 40 rooms that have served as lavish showcases for prominent designers, but in its crevices, where rain has seeped for 76 years.

It means attending innumerable cocktail parties, shaking thousands of hands and sitting for weeks on a podium trying to look bright-eyed and interested as hundreds of orators reel off prepared speeches that more often than not are repetitive and dull.

Player Ends Career
LEAD: Before deciding to play football this season, Chris Thorpe checked with three medical specialists.
That's because Thorpe, a 21-year-old senior safety for Penn State who had missed the 1986 season with a severe neck injury, wanted to make sure he would be at no special risk this year even though he had played in nine games last season.


Review/Opera; Handel in Light Mood, In Omaha 'Partenope'
LEAD: Two-thirds of Opera/Omaha's season looks like that of any American regional company - a musical comedy to entice the faint of heart and then the Romantic repertory aimed at those for whom ''grand'' remains the important constituent of opera.

LEAD: At St.
John's Episcopal Church in Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., Helena Franklin, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

LEAD: NEW JERSEY'S September grape harvest is in full swing, and wineries are reporting good crops.


Being Exclusive Is Nothing Special
LEAD: I RECENTLY RECEIVED a card from Ireland.
It simply said, ''Hello,'' and was not signed.
I suspect it was from a man I was once related to by marriage.
More than 10 years have passed since my divorce from his cousin.
I had met him briefly one night while on a family visit.
He wanted me to feel at home in his country.

THE SEOUL OLYMPICS: Sports of The Times; Korea's Home-Grown Sport
LEAD: On the first day of these Summer Games, the old was never very far from the new: a state-of-the-art stadium and men and maidens performing an ancient purification ritual on the lush grass during the opening ceremony.


In Hong Kong, Early Tea And Strategy
LEAD: THERE'S a lot to do in Hong Kong besides eat, but perhaps nothing so worthy of attention, so all-consuming, nothing that offers as great a share of its everyday life.
The lure of the five- or six-course lunch, followed after a decent interval by a 10-course banquet in the evening, calls for a breakfast strategy.


IN THE REGION: Long Island; Recent Sales

Midnight Perfection
LEAD: The only time Tom Browning had to work out of trouble was after it was over.

At last he emerged, disheveled and a little disbelieving.


Point O'Woods: Idyllic Monolith?

Streetscapes: The 125th Street Station; Metro-North Plans New Makeup, Not Plastic Surgery, for a Beauty
LEAD: It has been so neglected that it has the air of an abandoned building, even though 3,400 passengers use it daily.
But now the Metro-North Commuter Railroad has put out to bid plans to renovate its 125th Street station at Park Avenue, which was built in 1897.
Sometime next year the exterior will emerge from decades of neglect, but the long-hidden golden oak interior will simply get another coat of paint.

Evans's Homer Sinks Yanks BASEBALL

Sentimentalizing 60's Radicalism
LEAD: 'RUNNING ON EMPTY'' IS Sidney Lumet's family drama about radicals who, 15 years after blowing up a research laboratory that made napalm, are still on the run.
Why is this idea so undeniably compelling?
In part it's novelty, since Hollywood has left the radicalism of the 1960's relatively unexplored.


MR. EURIPIDES GOES TO WASHINGTON
LEAD: People often talk wishfully of establishing a ''national theater'' in the United States, but they aren't always clear what that cultural incantation means.
Do they have in mind some grand metropolitan institution, an American counterpart of Britain's National Theater or France's Comedie Francaise or Sweden's Royal Dramatic Theater, rooted at Lincoln Center or even the Kennedy Center?

Please Send One Bag of Garbage
LEAD: BY now there are very few people in New Jersey who are not fed up (please excuse the choice of words) with the garbage situation.
Single households like mine find the present arrangement particularly burdensome, since there is a flat pickup fee regardless of the amount of garbage generated.


A Revolutionary Cuba is Portrayed in Show of Posters at Lehman Gallery
LEAD: THE mission of the poster being to persuade, it seems redundant to call a show of them ''Persuasive Images.'' Then again, these particular posters, on display at the Lehman College Art Gallery, are Cuban, so the title may be a kind of caveat emptor aimed at those who are wont to see Castro as a Robin


Ship Bottom Journal; A Surf Shop Folds Awning After 30 Years

It called for peace between Israel and a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, each respecting the other's need for security.


Signs of Slowdown Are Well-Received
LEAD: A slowing of the economic pace seemed to be registered in the week's statistics.

The statistics included a two-tenths of 1 percent drop in retail sales in August.


Rutgers Outgunned by Vanderbilt
LEAD: Eric Jones was an efficient general on attack and a superb passer today, just as Vanderbilt has said of its senior quarterback and just as Rutgers knew from last year.

LEAD: APPLES are at their peak in the fall.

Question Of the Week; Should Drug Violators Be Paid for Time Away?
LEAD: No, No, No.
Would they be paid if they worked in private industry?
I doubt it.
Moreover, upon first offense, drug violators should be banned for the season; upon second offense, they should be banned for life.
Perhaps - then and only then - will athletes keep their noses clean.
NICHOLAS D. DeCURTIS  New


Card-Carrying Smears
LEAD: Even in a negative campaign for President, one topic that ought to be off-limits is questioning an opponent's loyalty to country.
The Bush-Quayle campaign has been operating close to the borderline of decency in its carping about the flag and the American Civil Liberties Union.
That such techniques may be working, at least temporarily, does not dignify them.


Bentsen Plays Up Roots In His Tour of the South

Nudism
LEAD: To the Editor: Regarding ''The Naked and the Dressed in Provence'' by Mickey Friedman (Travel, June 26): Was this mixture of furtive voyeurism and prudish distancing for real (''stunned, shock, widened eyes, shame''), or (now I get it) just a satire of those oh so noncosmopolitan Florida citizens who have not yet become suave New Yorkers?

The Moscow Blob
LEAD: The State Department's commitment to good architecture for U.S. embassies has raised some beautiful structures in faraway places - they are elegant expressions of America's best.

A Milestone for Johnson As Mets Set Back Expos

The emergency radio told of a boat accident and subsequent drownings.


Question Of the Week; Should Drug Violators Be Paid for Time Away?
LEAD: Every professional athlete has a moral obligation to honor his contract and do everything possible to perform at his best.

RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Golf  Palmer Leads Seniors: Arnold Palmer, five under par for the day after the first five holes, rolled in a 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole yesterday to salvage a four-under-par 68 for a three-shot lead after two rounds of the $325,000 Crestar PGA Seniors Classic in Richmond.

ON THE WAY UP
LEAD:  THE YOUNG MR.
LINCOLN Starring Henry Fonda.
Directed by John Ford. 1940.
Key Video. 100 minutes. $19.98. (Closed Captioned).
If Abraham Lincoln were half the man that Henry Fonda makes him in ''The Young Mr.
Lincoln,'' he could have settled the Civil War with a jest.
John Ford's 1940 movie, about Lincoln's days as a lawyer in Springfield, Ill., in the 1830's, is unabashed hagiography, but its strong feeling for time and place and the careful performance by Fonda, looking more like Lincoln in frock coat and stovepipe hat than


AMERICAN GLAMOUR
LEAD: In the Hollywood of the 1920's through the 40's, a man's clothes were cut to play up his assets - and play down the rest.
And the fashions made popular by the studios' most celebrated leading men conveyed the message that, on celluloid at least, style and substance were synonymous.
It wasn't easy, for example, to separate Robert Montgomery's suave authority from the elegant white dinner jackets he wore in his portraits.


Lingering Questions on Iran-Contra May Arise in Court - Or May Not

Do July's gains signal a closing of the trade gap?

LEAD: ONE old Asia hand likes to tell of an encounter at the airport restaurant in Guilin, China.

Entrees were identical, prices were not.


Whither City Opera Now?
LEAD: THE NEW YORK CITY OPERA'S ANNOUNCEMENT the other day that Christopher Keene would replace Beverly Sills as general director after this season came as a mild surprise, though hardly a shock.
Though some observers had hoped that the board of trustees might choose a career administrator who would share reponsibility with an artistic director, rather in the style of the Metropolitan Opera's team of Bruce Crawford and James Levine, that was not in the cards.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: He lost the United States Open and the No. 1 ranking he had held for 156 weeks, but Ivan Lendl, who is now ranked No. 2 behind Mats Willander, cited another ailment in withdrawing from this week's Volvo-Los Angeles tournament: an injury to his right shoulder joint incurred during the Open.

LEAD: ''As ye sow so shall ye reap.''


Renewing the United Nations; A Disposable U.N. Rite
LEAD: For most of this decade, Arab members of the United Nations have made a September ritual of asking the General Assembly to expel Israel.

Last year, 80 nations opposed the Arab move, 39 voted aye and 10 abstained.


Changes and Dues
LEAD: 'President Reagan has determined that the United Nations has reformed its operations to the point he can release the United States funding for that institution . . .

THE GREAT AMERICAN ORIGINALS
LEAD: Fall 1988 marks the coming of age of the American look, an eminently easygoing style whose roots - and influence - stretch across the Atlantic.
A timelessness and a graceful nonchalance define this home-grown way of dressing.
Western boots, a chambray work shirt or, on a more formal note, a three-button suit worn with cordovan brogues are a few of the badges of Yankee style updated for this season.

THE WAR WITHIN
LEAD: I was intrigued and then dismayed by Richard N. Goodwin's article ''The War Within'' (Aug. 21), about Lyndon B. Johnson.
From the depth of his analysis, it sounded as though Mr.
Goodwin was one of the President's closest advisers.
Mr.
Goodwin met or talked with the President 127 times in 1964 and 1965, according to my research using the Presidential daily diaries.


Using Face Lifts to Solve an Identity Crisis
LEAD: Conference centers are facing an identity crisis.
Throughout the early 1980's, their reputation rested on being serious: a campus-like collection of meeting rooms with audio-visual equipment that were dedicated to business use.


Bringing Up Babies to a Broadway Beat
LEAD: WHEN I WAS A SMALL child - I cannot recall exactly how small - my favorite toy was a narrow box full of records.

LEAD: Grace Stark should never have put up the $30,000 bond for that cocaine dealer.
What does a 52-year-old suburban housewife from western Massachusetts know about the bail bond business anyway?
She's only supposed to be minding the store until her husband, Phil, a professional bondsman who has filed for Chapter 11, can make good on some forfeits and get his license back.


Moscow's Still Holding
LEAD: INSIDE A WINDOWLESS ROOM in the heart of the Pentagon, a set of antiquated encryption/decryption machines suddenly start to percolate.

POSTINGS: Empty-Nester Condos; No More Mowing
LEAD: For the buyer whose empty nest must still hold a brood of furniture, a Stamford, Conn., project offers condomium houses.
A $285-to-$325 monthly common charge replaces weekend weed pulling and gutter cleaning, but, unlike a line of town houses or a stack of apartments, large - 3,000 to 3,400 square feet - single-family homes give this condominium cluster a subdivision look.


Meetings With More Frills - and More Fun
LEAD: Companies may be under pressure to control costs, but the amount they are spending on meetings continues to rise.

ANSWERING THE MAIL

SUMMER 1988; Loking Ahead, With Anticipation
LEAD: FORGET the weather.
Pay no heed to the end-of-season productions and awards ceremonies that were almost as prolific in late August as they were in June.
And most certainly ignore the fashion previews of woolens and corduroy that hit the clothing stores just about the time you decided it was time to invest in a new bathing suit.


Coastal Pollution Isn't Just Coastal
LEAD: The thorough piece ''Coastal Pollution: No Quick Remedy'' on Aug. 28 is to be well-pondered.


The Asians Have Given In And Still Prevailed on Trade
LEAD: WHEN the Reagan Administration took office in 1981, its message to Asia was clear: It would no longer stand by idly while Japan and a handful of other fast-growing economies flooded the United States with low-priced products and blocked American goods from their own markets.

Battle Over Condo Conversions Heats Up
LEAD: WHILE New Jersey suffers from a severe shortage of low-cost housing, tens of thousands of tenants across the state face eviction because their apartments are being converted to condominiums or cooperatives.
Mounting opposition to the evictions has generated fierce legislative and legal debates.


Peking Duck At the Source
LEAD: BEIJING, which in recent decades seemed content to ignore its dynastic past and culture as somehow corrupt, has, even as it rushes toward modernity, taken to collecting accounts of the customs and mores of the past century from its elderly citizenry.

Audio Goes By the Numbers
LEAD: AUDIO IS PROBABLY THE only field in which it is always safe to believe what you hear.
Playing it by ear, so to speak, is what audio is all about, and casual listeners rarely go beyond that.
But those who hope to evaluate sound equipment with real critical discernment need more than ephemeral impressions as a basis for judgment.


Military Programs of Candidates Mean Cuts Despite the Tough Talk
LEAD: While Vice President Bush and Michael S. Dukakis continually argue over just which weapons to add to the nation's arsenal, there has been little direct debate over the cuts in other military programs that would be required under their budgetary promises.

A Duel of Jockeys
LEAD: They could have called it ''Age Against Youth,'' or just maybe, ''Beauty and the Beast,'' but to the officials at Canterbury Downs in Shakopee, Minn., the ''Duel of the Downs,'' match race scheduled for Sunday, Oct. 2, is nothing less than a battle of the sexes.

After that is exhausted, vacation time.
If there is no provision for leave time in the professional athlete's contract, or if such leave time has been exhausted, then that person should go on leave without pay.
Professional athletes are no different from anyone else; they sign a contract to work and they ought not to be coddled.

Law School v. Reality
LEAD: TO A GREAT EXTENT, law and lawyers are in their heyday in the United States.
Lawyers' incomes continue to rise and their prominence in the society at large seems ever-increasing.
One of the most popular shows on television at the moment is about daily life in a law firm.

Reviews/Music; Ancient Music Group At New Miller Theater
LEAD: The McMillin Theater at Columbia University is dead.
Long live the Kathryn Bache Miller Theater.
Although McMillin, the 64-year-old hall at West 116th Street and Broadway, enjoyed a long and honorable run as a center for campus activities and especially as a home for electronic music and other varieties of contemporary art, it has been in recent decades a depressing place to hear concerts.

Men's Basketball; Sabonis Ineffective As Russians Fall
LEAD: In moments of frustration, Arvidas Sabonis chose to stare at his sneakers, shaking his head, sometimes bouncing the basketball as if he wanted to punish it for his plight.

Reviews/Music; Some Playful Algebra From Anthony Braxton
LEAD: The history of jazz is filled with eccentrics, and the saxophonist Anthony Braxton, who brought a quartet to the Knitting Factory for a rare engagement, qualifies as one of them.
Though he represents jazz's pedagogic side - his liner notes are as arcane and indecipherable as the densest semiotic text; he labels his compositions with line drawings that look algebraic - his music is often playful, with lines shooting out from all angles, and tempos picking up only to slow down.


Barges: Lifeline for the Far North
LEAD: Toward midnight, with the 24-hour sun of the Arctic summer hovering above the horizon, a dilapidated wooden cabin came into sight on the shore of the Mackenzie River.

Strangers On a Train, In 'Kansas'
''Kansas'' sets itself up as a suspense story entangled with the people and values of America's heartland.
Here is what happens in one supposedly sleepy little town.
A wheat field-wholesome young man named Wade (Andrew McCarthy) is on his way to New York City.
After his car burns up, he jumps on a freight train where he meets a drifter named Doyle (Matt Dillon) and is so unfazed by his sinister looks - the gold tooth and the panther tattooed on his forearm might have made most folks suspicious - that he hops off the train with his new friend.
Following Doyle's lead, the impressionable Wade breaks into a house, goes to a parade where he spots the girl of his dreams and robs a bank.
But while he is fleeing the bank, a car carrying the Governor's small daughter falls into the river, so Wade saves the child from drowning, runs away and hides the money - all this before lunchtime.
Soon he finds work at a farm owned by the father of the girl of his dreams, a convenient place to roll in the hay, literally, while the town searches for the mystery hero.
The plot slows down after that, but does not get less incredible.
The characters never become intriguing, though we're supposed to wonder about Wade's moral direction when he hangs onto the money, lies to Doyle and is uncovered as the hero.

On Refugees: Generous but Clumsy
LEAD: Secretary of State George Shultz has promised to open America's doors to more refugees next year.

LEAD: A traveler from the country who is lost in London wanders into the flat shared by Cyril (Philip Davis) and Shirley (Ruth Sheen), and he has such a hard time going home that they wind up nicknaming him ''E.

LEAD: After weeks of intense debate, the Palestine Liberation Organization is close to agreement on a formula for declaring a Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that would seek to be placed under United Nations trusteeship and would not necessarily recognize Israel, according to the leader of the organization's most radical faction.

SENDING THE GAMES ROUND THE WORLD
LEAD: The room is dark except for the rows of small television monitors filling the front wall, making it look like a giant flashing checkerboard of bright images, blinking soundlessly: swimmers splashing, runners running, horses jumping, boxers punching.

Radon: Making the Public Pay Attention
LEAD: The Government recently told Americans that their homes may be collecting dangerous amounts of odorless, tasteless, invisible radon gas, which causes about 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year in the United States.

Mexico City and the Loss of Innocence
LEAD: I carried a manual typewriter and a certain Olympian innocence to Mexico City 20 years ago.
I didn't fully understand that the Games I was covering were not the only games being played.
I thought that Bob Beamon's great leap forward and the black power salutes of Tommie Smith and John Carlos were entirely separate incidents, one a sporting event, the other a political statement, and that the Olympic Movement itself was so swollen with pretension and hypocrisy that it would soon explode in the atmosphere like one of its ceremonial balloons.

Where Menu and Music Are Lively
LEAD: JAZZ is king at Syosset's Cafe Royale.

That Strange Breed of Singer, Countertenors

Concerns About Coverage
LEAD: I have many problems with the Olympic Games, namely the unnecessary hype of the television coverage and the participation of seasoned professionals such as Chris Evert.

By Rail Among the Peaks of Peru
LEAD: THE train had stopped at the Continental Divide and we were hurrying toward the doors when I noticed the elderly woman beside me gasping for air.

APPEARANCE ANXIETY

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, he argued.

RUSSIAN AND RARE
LEAD: The chase is the most compelling part of an antiques dealer's profession - the constant search for that which is unique and undiscovered and appealing.

Question Of the Week; Is Gregg Jefferies The Rookie Of the Year?
LEAD: Gregg Jefferies should not be the Rookie of the Year because he has not played enough.

Making Garbage 'Disappear Like Magic'
LEAD: THE movement to ban many categories of plastics unless they degrade in the environment is not founded strictly on logic.

2 Koreas Are 2 Pieces In a Developing Puzzle
It's a shrewd director who knows the effect of his work as well as Lee Chang Ho.
At a press conference after ''The Man With Three Coffins,'' the first South Korean film to be shown at the New York Film Festival, he said through an interpreter, ''Thank you for your patience'' - a bluntly honest remark. ''The Man With Three Coffins'' is the kind of film that must be seen twice before it makes sense.
But only the most committed and curious students of world cinema may feel that Mr.
Lee's artistic rigor is reward enough for struggling through the film's taxing narrative strategy and its obscurity to most Western viewers.
In summary, the plot sounds compelling.
Three years after his wife's death, a man travels north to her hometown to scatter her ashes.
Along the way he crosses paths more than once with a nurse also heading north with her elderly charge and encounters a prostitute who dies soon after he sleeps with her.
All three women, including the wife seen in flashbacks, are played by the same actress, creating mysterious echoes.
Is the hero imagining this similarity?
Or are the women reincarnations of the wife?

New Look at Scaasi Is Slim
LEAD: THERE are, of course, a few big, rounded ball gowns in the fall collection of custom-made clothes by Arnold Scaasi; his clients insist on them for extravagant parties, he said.

Film Festival; Glimpses of a Depressing Future

Its manifold images of annihilation and misery are assembled in free-associating fashion, without any concern for narrative but with the quick, vigorous, flashy pacing that video audiences understand.
