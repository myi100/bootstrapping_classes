LEAD: From his home in Bridgton, Me., the very young Michael Cousins watched the big tractor-trailers roll silently by.
The great rigs were the boy's dream: He wanted to be a truck driver.


A Quest That Now Seems Quaint
LEAD: The quest to have photography treated as an equal partner of painting and sculpture has been going on since the mid-19th century.
It has been responsible for some of the most provocative images taken with the camera, and it has occasioned a seemingly endless string of attempts to convince the art world, once and for all, that photography is a medium of expression as well as of description.


'Presidential Pursuit'
LEAD: Which American President had a toy named after him?
Who was chosen President in 1800 after there was a tie in the Electoral College, and by whom?
If a Vice President dies in office, how is a new Vice President selected? *

Old, Yet Contemporary, South
LEAD: Posterity has been kinder to John Campbell, fourth Earl of Loudoun, than he probably deserved.

George on the signboards,'' said Benjamin Franklin, using the contemporary term for signs, ''always on horseback but never moves forward.


THE COST OF BEING BOOK-WISE
LEAD: ''The price of textbooks will make you cry,'' said Eddie Brosa as he searched for his books at the New York University bookstore in Manhattan.

Reworking the Classics: Homage or Ego Trip?

There is no theatrical activity that more inflames purist sensibilities in criticism and the academy - nothing that stimulates as many caustic generalizations about the debasements of modern culture.


Only Two More Fighting Days Until Election; Bush and Clean Fuel
LEAD: To the Editor:


LOTHAR BAUMGARTEN'S DISCREET PROVOCATIONS
LEAD: Among current presences on the international art scene none is more benign than a German artist called Lothar Baumgarten, who has just made the news on two quite separate counts.
At the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, there was inaugurated a ceiling piece of majestic proportions and almost incorporeal substance that measures roughly 110 feet by 40 feet.

Public Sculpture In Glen Cove
LEAD: The article ''Art and Identity in Glen Cove''  [ Oct. 23 ]  may serve as a step toward more public discussion of the very important proposal for a public sculpture in Glen Cove, and follows a letter which I wrote in which I raised questions about the site of the project and the composition of the committee supervising it.


Question Of the Week; What Do You Think About the Jockeys' Strike?
LEAD: It's about time the horse owners started to have a little sympathy toward the betting public.
We were being deprived of watching the world's greatest jockeys, but what is more important, if a horse finished an easy first, it stands to reason that if the second and third place finishers were allocated a diminishing percentage of the purse, then much fairer results would occur on place and show betting, which would ultimately make racing better for the bettor all round.


TURMOIL IN THE LABS
LEAD: Edward Teller, Lowell Wood and others have done a disservice to their colleagues and the cause of science by treating scientific research as a commodity to be bought by Congress and sold to the public.
Their effort to sell the Strategic Defense Initiative by making exaggerated claims for its effectiveness is only one example of a growing tendency to oversell scientific proposals through marketing techniques that are more appropriate to the sale of toothpaste.


High Overhead
LEAD: Put the roof aside for just a minute, which is the point, of course.
Within the confines of the SkyDome, Toronto's 60,000-seat stadium which is scheduled to open June 3, 1989, there will be a health club (with squash courts, a running track and a pool), an 800-seat restaurant, a Hard Rock Cafe, a hotel with 70 of its 350 rooms overlooking the field and a 115-by-33-foot Sony

TURMOIL IN THE LABS

We had been told that many members of the center would be there.

Group Show With 'Side Dish'
LEAD: THE group show now at Rutgers's Robeson Center Gallery, in Newark, follows precedent in having a solo as a ''side dish.'' And, as usual, Alison Weld is responsible for both events.
The difference is that Ms.
Weld, having left Rutgers for the State Museum in Trenton, is guest instead of resident curator.


MARC ORLANS MAYER WEDS MEERA KHOSLA
LEAD: The marriage of Meera Khosla, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Ramesh Khosla of Srinagar, Kashmir, India, to Marc Orlans Mayer, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Question Of the Week; What Do You Think About the Jockeys' Strike?
LEAD: Although I certainly acknowledge the riders' point-of-view - and indeed respect both their abilities and dedication to the cause - as a horseplayer, I cannot fully support their position.
The principal incentive in any sport - especially when wagering is involved - should be to win, not to finish second or third.

It has become cold-weather time.
Thoughts of tomato and mozzarella salads, chicken on the grill and fresh plum tarts are best tucked away.
The appetite is whetted by hearty fare, earthy mushrooms, rich squashes and nuts.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: THE yearning for days gone by isn't the exclusive province of one generation - it's almost a constant - but there's an absolute tidal wave of nostalgia going on at the moment.
The movies are full of music of the 1950's and 1960's; some of the biggest theatrical hits, including ''Cafe Crown,'' are revivals of the 1940's and, in the case of ''Anything Goes,'' of the 1960's, and the Chanel look in fashion has never been more popular.


The Everlasting Enigma of the 'Ring'
LEAD: Ever since the first performance of Wagner's ''Ring'' in 1876, audiences and critics have twisted themselves into knots wondering what it is all about.
Why not, when the composer himself seems to have believed that the questions were more important than any answers.
So, inevitably, with the appearance of the Metropolitan Opera's ''Gotterdammerung'' and the closing of yet another '

Fare of the Country; New Mexico's Pine Nuts, Sauce to Snack
LEAD: The short-trunked, short-needled, twisted, slow-growing pinon, or Pinus edulis, is as much a part of the landscape of northern New Mexico and Arizona as pink rock and blue mesas and yellow earth.
The peoples who have lived in the region have used the nuts for food, medicine, building material and fuel, in stories and in mythmaking, and in the softly rounded adobe kiva fireplaces to help along affairs of the heart.

STRIKE UP THE CHOIR!
LEAD: Thirty years ago, on April 30, 1958, to be exact, I sat with 250 students facing one of the most formidable men our generation knew - Peter J. Wilhousky, director of music in the New York City schools and conductor of the New York All-City High School Chorus.
As the warm, and primarily parental, applause receded at the concert's end, Wilhousky returned to the podium of Carnegie Hall, gestured for silence, and raised his baton to conduct the traditional encore, ''Madame Jeanette.

Film Version Of Everyman Wins Mexico
LEAD: Somewhere in the most remote hinterland of Mexico, there just might be a village whose residents have yet to see one of the many movies of La India Maria.

20's Restoration in Brooklyn: Park and Pride
LEAD: Imagine living on the park.
Across a broad boulevard is the classic marble facade of an art museum.
Just a short walk away are a lake and a zoo.
Behind you, however, is not the Upper East Side, but Prospect Heights, because this is Brooklyn, not Manhattan, and the Park is Prospect, not Central.
Gerald Rosengarten, converter of 49 apartments at 115 Eastern Parkway - priced from $94,500 to $204,500 - insists that not just sales bluster permits comparison between his address and one on Manhattan's Museum Mile.

LEAD: It's almost a re-enactment: A fast-food restaurant moves to elegant Fifth Avenue, to the dismay of the Fifth Avenue Association.

Connecticut Notebook; Experts Doubt Coattails or Turnout Will Decide Senate Race

MAESTRO ON THE MOVE
LEAD: As director of the New York Philharmonic since 1978, Zubin Mehta has drawn mixed reviews with praise for being a skilled technician and critcism for appearing indifferent in approaching some conducting assignments.

HIGH MARKS FOR LOW-COSTS HOUSING IN BOSTON
LEAD: Can there be such a thing as ''affordable housing'' that is decent, even wonderful, as a work of design?
That manages to make sense both economically and esthetically?
The answer, at least in Boston, is yes.
Two complexes of apartments have recently been completed in this city that achieve what is often thought to be no longer possible in our age - they are desirable places to live for working-class families and at the same time they add to the city's body of good architecture.

Low-Key Target In the Busy Caribbean
LEAD: The beaches are as perfect as they are anywhere else in the Caribbean, with great white crescents of sand resting against billowing green hills.

When he reached the end of the notebook, he flipped it over and continued writing on the reverse.

Shopper's World; Gemstones From Maine's Quarries
LEAD: Jewels are not what comes to mind when one thinks of Maine.
Regattas, L. L. Bean and lobster, maybe.
So it comes as something of a surprise to learn that many of the world's largest and most flawless tourmaline crystals have been mined in the rugged hills of southwestern Maine.

Question Of the Week; What Do You Think About the Jockeys' Strike?
LEAD: New York's jockeys were merely seeking to be treated like jockeys everywhere.

Review/Theater; 1940's Brew of Satire Within Satire
LEAD: ''Kiss Me Quick Before the Lava Reaches the Village'' is a textbook example of the kind of musical that tries so hard to be clever it ends up outsmarting itself.

HOLY SECRETS
LEAD: The Body and Mind article, ''Holy Secrets'' (By Michael Wilkes and Miriam Shuchman, Oct. 2) neglected to mention a crucial fact: because of the unusual transmission pattern of the AIDS virus, the prospects of saving partners from infection are far larger than for other sexual diseases.
Most sexual diseases are most easily transmitted in the first weeks or months after an individual contracts them; in the case of syphillis, for example, by the time someone becomes sick, typically five years or longer after infection, the syphillis spirochete is virtually nontransmissible.

By David Stenn. (Doubleday, $18.95) This rags-to-riches biography of Clara Bow is titillating and enthralling yet sad.

Better Government for Yonkers
LEAD: The bitter battle over court-ordered low-income housing in Yonkers was an inevitable result of the city's governing structure.
It has a mayor with little management authority, a city manager with virtually no political authority and a City Council reflecting district, not citywide, interests.
A ballot proposal to restructure and strengthen city government deserves voter approval.

Celebrating A Gateway to The Frontier
LEAD: Natives of Staunton, Va., hasten to tell you that the town's name is pronounced Stanton, after Lady Stanton, a royal governor's wife, and no one is quite sure how the ''u'' wandered in to the spelling to confuse generations of visitors.

Chess; On Giving Heroic Defenders the Credit They Deserve
LEAD: IT is hard to see the defender as a hero, even when he is.

VERBATIM: Unhappy Trials
LEAD: 'If you actually read the biography of any of the famous gunfighters, they led very drab, mostly very repetitive, not very exciting lives.

New York:  Alfred A. Knopf. $19.95.


MEMO TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT
LEAD: One hopes Henry Kaufman's wise prescription is heeded by the next President and Congress (''Memo to the Next President,'' Oct. 9).

He correctly stresses the danger of pushing the economy down when it already might be headed into a recession.


Foreign Children: Hoping to Fit In

LEAD: Dabby Dawson ran for 134 yards and a touchdown today as Wyoming whipped Texas-El Paso, 51-6, to claim a share of the Western Athletic Conference title.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  GERALD L. K. SMITH: Minister of Hate.
By Glenn Jeansonne. (Yale University, $25.) Gerald L. K. Smith was a bizarre fundamentalist whose vitriolic racism was matched only by his passion for collecting Bibles.
In chronicling Smith's life, Glenn Jeansonne, who teaches history at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, opens a window on the lunatic fringe.

KEAN PLANS TO CURB GROWTH, WITH OR WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE

A Great Equalizer For the Disabled
LEAD: OF THE 45 million students now in public schools, at least 10 percent - 4.5 million - are disabled in some way, according to the Federal Government.

Nearly half are considered to be learning-disabled.

Go Away, Dick and Jane
LEAD: THE COMPETITION to get into Blue Sky News is intense.
When Kalinda, who has recently moved into the Forest Edge Elementary School District in Reston, Va., offers the fact that her family has a new couch, she is almost hooted out of the classroom by her fellow first-graders.
On the other hand, Brian's announcement that his cat just had nine kittens is hailed unanimously as a big story.


The Mood
LEAD: Coast to coast, north to south, the dominant reaction to the Presidential campaign has been disappointment verging on disgust.
Voters yearn for a leader, but expect much less.
The Week in Review, Section 4.
As one of the legion of non-voters said, ''I don't care who you have in there unless it's God Himself.


Sifting for Gold In Two 'Lost' Balanchine Ballets
LEAD: George Balanchine choreographed ''Cotillon'' in Monte Carlo in 1932 at the age of 28 and ''Mozart Violin Concerto'' in Buenos Aires in 1942.
Quite unexpectedly, within one month both of these so-called lost ballets have recently been performed in New York City.
Created 10 years apart, they reveal strikingly not only how Balanchine arrived at the esthetic that now identifies him but, more importantly, the influences that he sought to cast off in his youth.

Question Of the Week; What Do You Think About the Jockeys' Strike?
LEAD: The ''jockeys' strike,'' which would appear to have been more of an owners' strike, has illustrated the fact, that even though small of stature, the jockeys proved themselves much bigger than the owners and some of their trainers.
Indeed, how many owners would have been willing to turn their backs on the possibility of making more than $100,000 (Pincay) or would offer to contribute their out-of-town earnings


Banned Beepers
LEAD: New York Schools Chancellor Richard Green deserves praise for banning telephone pagers, or beepers, from all public schools.
It's a welcome response to the drug plague that recognizes no boundaries, including institutions of learning.


Ruggers Preparing for Playoff
LEAD: JUST two years ago, the future of Westchester's only amateur Rugby team for adults looked grim.
It was losing more games than it won, it lost its playing field in White Plains and was demoted to the second division of the New York Metropolitan Rugby League Conference.


A Whodunit Keeps the Audience in the Dark
LEAD: ''ARE You Sure?'' - presented by the Boston Post Road company - is one of those pretentious, pseudo-mysteries that purport to keep one guessing who is who, who is alive and what is real.
Since the playwright, Sam Bobrick, would apparently rather titillate than tell, one's patience is likely to expire before the play does, which grinds the evening down to one crucial question: ''Who cares?

Consolidation in Greenwich: A 285-Slip Marina Nears Final Approval
LEAD: By the numbers, Cos Cob Marina will not bring much of a change to the Mianus River in Connecticut.

Kraft then came up with a special dividend package of securities it valued at $110 a share, but had left the door open to outside offers.

LEAD: In September, oil production in the United States fell below eight million barrels a day for the first time in more than a decade; in October, Saudi Arabia pushed its production to 6.5 million barrels a day, the highest level since 1982.

A Killer Companion in 'Child's Play'
Even before a killer doll turns up in ''Child's Play,'' you may feel you've dropped into ''The Twilight Zone'' -the television show, not the place.
As a detective chases a murderer down a murky Chicago street and into a toy store, the scene looks so television-perfect, so shallow, artificial and lurid, that you expect the camera to pull back and reveal that we've really been watching television.
Though the film never becomes so blatantly ironic, the television look suits Tom Holland's clever, playful thriller.
Straddling the line between sendup and suspense, ''Child's Play'' occupies the narrow, self-conscious space that is truly ''Twilight Zone'' territory.
When the detective (Chris Sarandon) shoots the scraggly-looking ''Lakeshore Strangler'' (Brad Dourif), lightning flashes over the toy store and the murderer begins to chant.
He throws his departing soul into the nearest available body - a three-foot-tall talking doll called a Good Guy.

LEAD: Ballet, functioning within a repertory system, has what are called alternate casts.
No one considered Rudolf Nureyev and Dame Margot Fonteyn as understudies in the days when they would consistently and triumphantly follow on the heels of another partnership in the very same ballet.

WEST VIRGINIA - DUKAKIS
LEAD: In this mountainous state, one of the poorest in the nation, Democrats usually do well, and West Virginians gave the Democrats a clean sweep of major races.

Yesterday, with the dry leaves shuffling in figure eights around my feet on the sidewalk, I thought about what it was like growing up, and the feeling came back to me, palpable as fever.

First Choice for Top Cabinet Post: James Addison Baker 3d
LEAD: He is a Texas patrician who struck up a friendship with his next-door neighbor, George Bush, 30 years ago, a lawyer whose shrewdness and toughness as a Republican political strategist have led him close to the pinnacle of power.
Although James A. Baker 3d openly sought the job of Secretary of State, the choice is a risky one.


Health; Personal Health
LEAD: If Dr.
Mary S. Calderone had known all about the medications she was taking in 1985, when her troubles began, she might have been spared 30 months of debilitating, often humiliating misery.
She suffered from extreme sleepiness, loss of balance, memory problems, weakness, difficulty concentrating, depression, unease and lassitude.


Review/Music; Transcriptions for Guitar
LEAD: Kazuhito Yamashita's assets as a guitarist include extraordinary dexterity, a big resonant tone and flare before an audience.
His main failing, to judge by an Alice Tully Hall recital Sunday afternoon at which all the virtues were abundantly in evidence, is overweening ambition.

In all, Adler &amp; Shaykin will purchase about 98 percent of Best Products' shares outstanding.


NEVADA - BUSH
LEAD: As it has since Richard M. Nixon's election in 1968, Nevada gave its four electoral votes to the Republican Presidential candidate.
Mr.
Bush swept the state.
Senator Chic Hecht, a Republican running for re-election after his first term, was dogged by attacks not only on his effectiveness in Congress but also on his intelligence, and he lost to the state's highly popular Governor, Richard H.


Review/Architecture; Pavilion Where East Meets West
LEAD: Its winged roofs, zigzagging walls and circular towers covered in shards of green quartz loom to the west of the La Brea Tar Pits.
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's new Pavilion for Japanese Art, which opened recently, has prompted some observers here to suggest that La Brea's fake mastadons look as though they are rearing up in startled response.

Review/Violin; Gidon Kremer's Version Of Busoni's Grand Vision
LEAD: The more one knows of Ferruccio Busoni's music, the more intriguing its curious blend of grandeur and intellectual rigor becomes.
He may be the next Mahler or Janacek: that is, a turn-of-the-century composer whose vision turns out to have suited a future age better than his own.
His second violin sonata in E minor, composed in 1898, furthered such thoughts Sunday evening at Avery Fisher


Schizophrenia Study Finds Strong Signs Of Hereditary Cause
LEAD: An international research team has announced that it has found ''the first concrete evidence for a genetic basis to schizophrenia,'' one of the most devastating and widespread varieties of mental illness.


Witness Recalls Myerson's Anger at Newspaper Inquiry
LEAD: A witness testified yesterday that Bess Myerson became ''very angry'' when a newspaper asked questions about her hiring of Sukhreet Gabel in the Cultural Affairs Department of New York City.


The People Speak
LEAD: From the beginning, American political theory has rested on the idea of popular sovereignty.
In this country, James Madison wrote in 1798, ''The people, not the government, possess the absolute sovereignty.''


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Study Lends Support To Price Promotions
LEAD: Do price promotions destroy brand equity?
Advertising agencies say yes, emphatically.
But a new study by Frankel &amp; Company, the Chicago-based sales promotion agency, says no.


Bass Group Buys Sensormatic Stake
LEAD: An investment group led by Sid R. Bass and his brother Lee, two members of the Bass family of Fort Worth, have acquired a 6 percent stake in the Sensormatic Electronics Corporation.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Bass group said that it had purchased the shares in Sensormatic, a maker of electronic surveillance equipment based in Boca Raton,


Time 'Too Painful' to Remember
LEAD: The Golden Age Club in the basement of an upper Manhattan synagogue was abuzz with gossip, laughter and the shuffle of cards when the rabbi, himself 79 years old, struck a spoon against a metal ash tray to get everyone's attention.


HOME IMPROVEMENT
LEAD: DOORKNOBS that incorporate a lock in the knob are referred to as locksets.
Because they are less expensive to manufacture and easier to install than traditional mortise locks - in which the knob and lock mechanism are separate even though housed in a single assembly - locksets are by far the most common type of latching device for both exterior and interior doors.


VIRGINIA - BUSH
LEAD: Proving their capacity for divided loyalties, Virginians voted to put a Democrat in the Senate and a Republican in the White House, both by overwhelming margins.


Ideology, Competence and Mr. Bush
LEAD: President-elect Bush could have found someone with weightier national security credentials than James A. Baker 3d to be his Secretary of State.
But he could not have found anyone he trusts more.
Mr.
Baker, the former Secretary of the Treasury and a friend for 30 years, was an architect of Mr.
Bush's rise from potential loser to President-elect.

Rangers Make Important Leap
LEAD: Igor Liba, a former Czechoslovak Olympian who speaks almost no English, had to express his delight last night simply through his distant smile from the far reaches of the locker room.
However, the rest of the Rangers, who had lost their previous three games, provided the words to go with his obvious sentiment in a final bit of the kind of eloquent teamwork they had displayed in beating the Flyers, 5-3, at Madison Square

Metro Datelines; H.M.O. Rates to Rise By as Much as 45%

The increases are expected to lead many employers to pass on rising health-care costs to workers.


TENNESSEE - BUSH
LEAD: Mr.
Bush, as expected, won handily in Tennessee.
Mr.

LEAD: The Phoenix Cardinals are hardly a reincarnation of the Green Bay Packers of the 1960's or even the champion Chicago Bears, San Francisco 49ers or Washington Redskins of the 1980's.
They have only a 6-4 record, and they would be 4-6 except for last-minute victories on the last two Sundays over the Dallas

Patents; A Bib for Fathers To Assist in Bonding
LEAD: Last September, Janet D. Hodson, an inventor in Ventura, Calif., won patent 4,768,612 for Pregaphone, a device designed to let expectant mothers talk to their unborn children.

Taking the Hard Road With Black Athletes
LEAD: My three-volume book, ''A Hard Road to Glory: A History of the African- American Athlete,'' began almost as an afterthought to a seminar class I was asked to give on the historical and sociological role of the African-American athlete.
Though I had never seen it, I assumed some esteemed black historian, sociologist or sports reporter had compiled the entire story of the black athlete in one volume.

LEAD: THE 19TH-CENTURY British critic John Ruskin, nipping in the bud any fashionable tendency to include native artifacts in the world of esthetics, declared, ''There is no art in the whole of Africa, Asia or America.'' He did not bother even to mention Australia.
At the time he wrote, most aboriginal Australian objets d'art were in the hands of missionaries, homesteaders or anthropologists, who valued them more for what they said about the extraordinary social life of the hundreds of groups defined by language and kinship than for their beauty.


Military Mindset

LEAD: Big is not always better.
But it can be, if not exactly noble, at least gallant.
Consider ABC.

Isn't There a Better Way to Run an American Election?

LEAD: The Soviet Union today detonated a 20-kiloton nuclear test device beneath the Semipalatinsk proving grounds on the steppes of Kazakhstan in Central Asia, the official press agency Tass reported. ''The goal of the testing was upgrading military technology,'' Tass said.

The Mystical Force of Bartok's Quartets
LEAD: When the Emerson String Quartet first performed all six Bartok quartets in a single evening, at Alice Tully Hall in 1981 on the occasion of the composer's centenary, it smacked of youthful bravado if not a publicity stunt.
Along with Beethoven's late quartets, these number among the most concentrated and astringent works in the genre, intensely demanding of performer and listener alike.


KIDS IN THE FAST LANE
LEAD: Was anyone else as bothered as I was by Sara Davidson's article on family privilege in Los Angeles?
Behind the introspection was a cheer for the good times she and others enjoy.
Who really cares about the micro-dilemmas of wealthy families?

The Love Between Beckett and Actors Isn't Mutual
LEAD: Just in case you haven't been keeping tabs on Samuel Beckett lately, we should make note this morning that he has gradually arrived at his concept of ideal theater.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  THE GRAMMAR OF JUSTICE.
By Elizabeth H. Wolgast. (Cornell University, Cloth, $29.95; Paper, $9.95.) Democracy, equal rights and, especially, justice are concepts often invoked but seldom examined; so it is singularly useful to read Elizabeth H. Wolgast's clear-sighted and thought-provoking essays.

Cooling It in the Fast Lane
LEAD: THE really good upward mobile and savvy stuff is in the fast lane.
That's where it's at, we're told.
What fast lane?
It sure ain't on the roads in these parts.
So; when even all the upward mobility and savvy in the world doesn't change anything, and to join the frozen traffic is the give, why not take a break and look around while you're parked there on the road twixt and tween other wheels fore and aft.

Autumn Anti-Breeze Protection
LEAD: IN New York lately, the weather has been a little on the cool side but still relatively mild for this time of year.
A wool coat is too bulky and warm, and a raincoat isn't heavy enough.
Stylish women are thus confronted with the kind of challenge they are no more likely to pass up than they would a half-price sale: devising the perfect cover-up.

Tit for Tat
LEAD: Led by the sharp-shooting Mario Lemieux, the Pittsburgh Penguins have been well out in front of the National Hockey League in goals scored this season.
Even so, the Penguins have been stuck behind the Rangers in second place in the Patrick Division standings.
That's because the Rangers, the Devils, the Islanders and Pittsburgh's other divisional rivals have been employing a deceptively simple, but largely effective, strategy to neutralize the Pittsburgh attack: answering virtually every

A Growing Backlash Against Greed
LEAD: REVULSION over the frenzied battle to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. for the unprecedented price of more than $20 billion may do something that neither the insider-trading scandal nor any other mega-acquisition has accomplished: stir Washington and investors to try to curb takeovers.


Late Touchdown Gives Army 7th Victory in Row
LEAD: Army added a glorious chapter to its football history today, driving 63 yards for a winning touchdown in the waning moments of play to score a dramatic 24-19 triumph over Vanderbilt and virtually insure the Cadets of a berth in the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Tex., Dec. 24.


Golf
LEAD:  Four Tied for Lead: Chris Perry figures he needs to finish in the top three in the Centel Classic to retain his PGA Tour card.
He is in a good position for that after shooting a six-under-par 66 yesterday to move into a four-way tie for the lead after three rounds.
Perry will start today's final round of the $500,000 event tied for the lead at 204 with Bob Lohr, Bill Glasson and Kenny Perry.


Question Of the Week; Can the N.H.L. Stop Sticking Incidents?
LEAD: As with most of its other troubles, the N.H.L.'s stick-swinging problem is money-related.
In all contact sports, the answer to flagrant rule infractions is length-of-the-injury suspensions.
A career-ending high stick then has the same effect at both ends of the weapon.
Since N.H.L. owners' money, in the form of player investments, is involved, don't hold your breath.


Time Alone Will Tell Ownership
LEAD: A derelict, turn-of-the-century sidewalk clock on Third Avenue and 85th Street was designated a landmark in 1981, but then mistakenly sold by the city to a private buyer, who removed it in 1985.
The buyer returned the clock and a restoration program is now almost complete - but now three different parties, including the city, consider themselves the legal owner.


Vive la Difference
LEAD: I CAME TO PARIS IN 1982 at the age of 30, met a Frenchwoman three years later, married her and settled down in France.

Review/Pop; 2 Musical Homelands In Songs by Los Lobos
LEAD: On Thursday night at Carnegie Hall, David Hidalgo of Los Lobos sang, ''Dos idiomas y dos paises/Dos culturas tengo yo.'' (''Two languages and two homelands/Two cultures have I.'') The song, by the norteno group Los Pinguinos from South Texas, sums up Los Lobos's position as the leading Mexican-American band (and probably the only one known to most of Los Lobos's English-speaking audience).


A Plea For Surprises
LEAD: To the Editor:


Sound Bite, Define Yourself!
LEAD: WHEN, WEEKS from now, the hurry-up ''definitive'' history of the 1988 campaign is written, what word or phrase will emerge as the favorite locution of the election?

Reading, Mass.:  Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $29.95.


AS THE ECONOMY SLOWS, THE UNCERTAINTIES INCREASE
LEAD: From nearly every economist, the message is loud and clear: the American economy is slowing down.
The slowdown could turn into a recession next year or the year after.
Or, ideally, the decline would halt short of a recession, and the economy would then settle into a low but satisfactory rate of growth -one that would last into the 1990's.


Curing a Computer Virus
LEAD: Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated an investigation into the virus program reportedly written by Robert T. Morris Jr., a graduate student at Cornell University, that clogged the Pentagon's Arpanet research network and paralyzed an estimated 6,000 computers around the nation.
A handful of computer installations escaped because they had plugged loopholes.

THE YEAR'S BEST ILLUSTRATED BOKKS
LEAD: The illustrations on these pages have been taken from The Book Review's choices of the 10 best illustrated children's books of 1988.
Since 1952, The Book Review has annually asked a panel of three judges to make a selection from among the several thousand children's books published each year.
The judges this year were Dudley B.


Question Of the Week; Can the N.H.L. Stop Sticking Incidents?
LEAD: If the N.H.L. gave harsher punishments to those who do use their sticks savagely and also to those who instigate the incident.
The length of the suspension or the publicity surrounding the incident should not differ if the player involved is a superstar or a journeyman.
CHRIS FARBER  New York


Rome Picnics
LEAD: To the Editor: Professor Chappell's article (Travel, Oct. 23) about picnicking in Rome recalls beautiful weeks spent in the Eternal City, doing just what she describes.
However, neither the Janiculum - being on the ''wrong side of the river'' - nor the Pincio are among the ''Seven Hills of Rome,'' which rather include the Capitoline and the Viminal.


Sports of The Times; The Patriots' Cleanup Man
LEAD: At halftime of the New England Patriots' season opener, Vic Kiam and Billy Sullivan were up in the Sullivan Stadium press box, visiting with a few sportswriters.

Tomorrow night, the group will hold a cabaret benefit to replenish its war chest.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  BONES OF CONTENTION: Controversies in the Search for Human Origins, by Roger Lewin. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $9.95.) Based on smatterings of fossilized fragments, theories about the ancestral lineage of man often require as much imagination as analysis, Roger Lewin shows. ''Again and again, the science of human origins comes out looking like a competitive Rorschach test,'' our reviewer, Robert Wright, said last year.

RISK VS. REWARD: A BALANCING ACT
LEAD: The amount of risk an individual is willing to assume when investing depends more on the person than on the investment.
An investor's age, income, short- and long-term goals play important roles when deciding where to put money to work.
A 24-year-old single investor might go for a big return with options or commodities.


The New Reasons for Giving to Children
LEAD: THREE years ago, Herman and Ruth Balcoff of Millburn, N.J., opened a savings account in the name of their new grandchild, listing themselves as the custodians.

Balcoff said.

After Gilbert, Finding Bargains Under New Roofs
LEAD: The resorts of Jamaica and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula have not completely recovered from the damage inflicted by Hurricane Gilbert, which killed 400 people in its path in September.
But vacationers who have a fondness for either area, or who are seeking low rates, should not automatically reject either one - as long as they are prepared to ask hard questions about conditions and perhaps make some allowances.

THE NATION: History's Precedent; How Hoover Handled The '29 Transition
LEAD: GEORGE BUSH is in a situation that no President-elect has had to deal with in 60 years.
Not since Herbert Hoover was elected in 1928 to follow Calvin Coolidge has a new President succeeded one of the same party and thus had to decide which, if any, of his predecessor's appointees to keep.


CAMERA! ACTION!
LEAD: With elements of costume epic, backstage story, frontier adventure, domestic romance and even a Dickensian scenario (an orphan that Cecil B. adopted was actually his brother's son), the story of the DeMille family seems like another C. B. extravaganza.
With audacious brevity, the biographer Anne Edwards documents three generations of this remarkable clan in the lavishly illustrated THE DeMILLES: AN AMERICAN FAMILY (Abrams, $39.95).


Findings of a Trashologist
LEAD: SPECIALIZATION has gone amok.
I've heard of a doctor who treats only diseases of the elbow and of a lawyer who confines his practice to cases involving fishermen.
I know an actor who plays only uncle roles, and there are surely a lot of flambeau chefs who perform only at tableside.
I, too, have a special ability.


THE NATION: Together Again; With Bush in the Oval Office, Is The C.I.A. 'Back in the Saddle'?
LEAD: VICE PRESIDENT BUSH, who will be the first President to have served as America's intelligence chief, wasted no time in signaling a new, hands-on approach to intelligence issues.


Arrest at White House Fence

Mickey Mouse And Tick-Tack-Toe At the Japan Society

Review/Ballet; The Joffrey's Diaghilev Bill
LEAD: The Joffrey Ballet's Diaghilev program received a nicely danced but relatively low-key performance on Thursday at City Center.

Correction

Knee Surgery for Solt
LEAD: When the Eagles' high-priced guard, Ron Solt, turned out to have severe knee problems after being traded to Philadelphia by the Indianapolis Colts last month, some Eagle fans assumed that the Colts had palmed off damaged goods on the Eagles or that Solt had covered up his problems.

STAR TREKKING
LEAD: While Peter Mehlman is happy to spot celebrities, I harbor deeper notions (About Men: ''Star Trekking,'' Oct. 16).
I fantasize that, in a chance encounter with one of my particular favorites, like Woody Allen, I will utter the perfect few words that will enable him to recognize me as a soul mate and we will become instant best friends.


Melissa Jay Greenwald Engaged to Rolf Kat

LEAD: To the Editor:


Need Aircraft Tires? How To Grow Them Yourself
LEAD: EURICIC acid vegetable oil, an extract from a large group of plants, including rapeseed and crambe, is not recommended as part of the human diet because it can severely damage the liver.

And so, in sadness, he walks in the night, and as he walks the snow starts falling gently, very gently.''

Presidents have tastes in design, one presumes, but they are not enforced in the manner that Louis XIV'S architectural tastes were enforced, or those of the Czars.

Democratic Strength Shifts to West
LEAD: The 1988 Presidential election marked a decided shift in the strength of Democratic Party to the Midwest and the West.
It also confirmed that the ''Solid South,'' once a Democratic bastion, is now solidly Republican in Presidential voting and may well stay that way for some time.


Canada's Business, Canada's Loss
LEAD: Even if numbed by the distortions of their own political campaign, Americans may be startled to learn how they are currently portrayed by Canadian politicians: as hungry predators, poised to swarm across the 49th parallel and gobble everything in sight.


Natural Childbirth Evolving With Advances for Less Pain
LEAD: The doctrine of natural childbirth, which once called for no medical intervention whatsoever in normal labor and delivery, is increasingly being bent to accommodate the advances in understanding and controlling pain.


FOR ARABS, THE TALKS ARE A 'GIFT'
LEAD: The 448-member Palestine National Council was founded in 1964 as a consultative body for Palestinians and has become the highest legislative body for the 5.5 million Palestinians dispersed around the world.
Its decisions become binding policies that can sometimes paralyze or motivate Palestinian actions.


Ostriches From Oklahoma and Big Farms of Fish
LEAD: THE relentless sun of last summer baked Russ and Diane Erdman's farm in Alma, Mo.
But unlike some Missouri growers, the Erdmans at least had something to sell this year: blueberries, blackberries and tomatoes, all of which survived with irrigation.

LEAD: Barry Sanders, the Oklahoma State tailback, broke the major-college single-season touchdown record today, scoring five times against Kansas in a 63-24 Big Eight Conference romp.

Justice and a Salty Sandwich Are Served in Pennsylvania
LEAD: A judge has cleared a convenience store clerk of disorderly conduct for serving an oversalted ham sandwich.
It was a practical joke that a state trooper with high blood pressure found in bad taste.


Old Timers Out for a Spin Cut a Couple of Disks
LEAD: The two records under consideration here might be lumped together under the title ''geezers at play,'' except that one (the far better one) sounds like playful geezers and the other like geezers hard at work to recapture something long lost.

NEW YORKERS, Etc.
LEAD: IT'S hard to believe, but Barbara Cook says it's true.
She has a friend, a famous and rich performer, who doesn't stint on luxury when she's on tour.
She hires limousines, stays in the best hotels, tips generously.
She has elegant luggage and in that elegant luggage is an elegant wardrobe - and an iron and squares of aluminum foil.


Philadelphia Freeing 100
LEAD: Philadelphia, acting under a court-ordered plan to relieve prison overcrowding, has begun releasing 100 more inmates awaiting trial.
The release, which will take several days, was ordered Friday because the city has been violating a limit of 3,750 inmates, imposed by Federal District Court.


VERMONT TOURS BY CABRIOLET AND CUTTER
LEAD: Robert Gove, a retired dairy farmer in Moretown, Vt., says he feels ''more alive, somehow'' when he's driving his sled.
And it's easy to see what he means.
A trip through woods and fields in one of Mr.
Gove's sturdy wooden box sleds is a treat to all the senses, and one is delighted by the crisp smell of woodsmoke and pine boughs; the sight of snow-covered pastures and of Mount Mansfield - the state's highest peak - rising in the distance; the feel of the rough wool blankets; the varied cadence of the harness bells on the

Reviews/Music; Recent Pieces by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich
LEAD: For the contemporary composer, first performances of one's latest music are relatively easy to manage.
Getting them repeated is far more difficult.
Thus Ellen Taaffe Zwilich was doubly blessed on Sunday afternoon at Merkin Concert Hall when the New York Philharmonic Ensembles played two of her recent, but by no means new, compositions.

Love Can Mean Saying Goodbye
LEAD: I JUST took my husband to the airport for the third time in a month.
My husband is a film maker, and the three-month project he is working on in the Northwest has turned us into a bicoastal family.
We are always saying goodbye.
Even when we say hello I hear the echo of parting in the background.


Question Of the Week; Can the N.H.L. Stop Sticking Incidents?
LEAD: The National Hockey League can stop sticking incidents by inaugurating a series of penalties, starting with a one-game suspension; then escalating to a three-game suspension if the violation is judged to be a deliberate intention to harm; and at least a suspension of double the number of games that the victim is forced to miss as a result of the injury.


Stymied Warriors
LEAD: SUDDENLY, THE CODE WORDS are given and the nocturnal tranquility of the desert is shattered by the staccato sound of automatic arms fire and jarring explosions.
In minutes, a small commando group has successfully completed its mission - storming the buildings, killing the terrorists and rescuing the hostages.


A Move to Trim Corporate Travel Costs
LEAD: TRAVEL means different things to different people.
To the business traveler, it too often means delayed flights, missed connections, inferior hotels and upset stomachs.
Yet, since the days of Marco Polo, travel has been a vital and necessary part of doing business.


Question Of the Week; Can the N.H.L. Stop Sticking Incidents?
LEAD: No.
In order to overcome the American male stereotype that guys who like to skate and speak French are ''sissies,'' the stickings and fights will continue.
Otherwise hockey will attract just as many American viewers as that other great ice sport, curling.
ROBERT J. MOORE  Bloomfield, N.J.


CLOSE TO THE VEST
LEAD: Chalk it up to the influence of what The New York Times movie critic Janet Maslin has called ''white flannel films,'' in which immaculate young men preen in turn-of-the-century trousers, blazers and, most strikingly, silk vests.
Or to a rekindled interest in the plumage worn by such legendary dandies as Oscar Wilde, whose biography made best-seller lists earlier this year.


Demand for Affordable Housing Helps Slow Redlining
LEAD: Heavy demand for affordable housing in New York City has stimulated investment in neighborhoods that used to be terra incognita for lenders.


SEEKING SAFE HARBORS TO KEEP MONEY INTACT
LEAD: To many investors, the markets are still treacherous territory.
The economy may be stable, and the sharp swings that plagued the stock market a year ago may have subsided, but the nervousness lingers.


A GRAND-SLAM PROFIT MAY BE IN THE CARDS
LEAD: ''Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.''  Shakespeare


Sometimes Fortune Comes Right to the Doorstep
LEAD: A FEW weeks ago I was an unwitting party to a crime.
It happened on our second day in a country house we had rented for the winter.
As I was washing dishes I looked out of the window and saw a large dog tussling on the lawn with a mysterious black object.
It was raining hard and my husband dragged on his coat and went outside to investigate.


Correction
LEAD: A front-page headline in the Travel section today carries an incorrect page number for an article about the abbeys of Wiltshire, England.
The article is on page 27, not page 8.


DETERMINED TO BE HEARD
LEAD: Ann B. Hopkins is suing because she is ''tough-minded'' and believes she was discriminated against when she was not selected for promotion at Price Waterhouse.

NEWS SUMMARY
LEAD:  INTERNATIONAL/3-23


Fare of the Country; Philadelphia's Twist on the Pretzel
LEAD: Along with the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, the soft pretzel is at home in Philadelphia.
With an estimated 300,000 consumed daily in the city, it's no wonder that the comedian David Brenner, who is a native son, called his recent book ''Soft Pretzels With Mustard.'' Perhaps the ultimate street food, this humble twist of bread may today seem indigenously


For Neil Simon, the Prescription Was Farce
LEAD: ''I was going through some difficult times,'' Neil Simon says. ''This marriage I was in was breaking up.
My daughter's husband was killed in an automobile accident.
It seemed like rough going.

Farrell, St. Francis Advance
LEAD: Monsignor Farrell, the regular season Catholic High Schools Football League AAA division champion, had a relatively easy time eliminating Holy Cross, 31-13, in the playoff semifinals at St.
John's University yesterday.

LEAD: As a New Yorker, I, too, have spot-the-celebrity stories.
One of mine involves the same person Peter Mehlman spotted.

Page 23, the editorial page, and Page 3 occupy each other's positions.


Sewage in Santa Monica Bay
LEAD: Nearly seven miles of beaches are closed for the weekend because a cap on a sewer main 15 miles inland failed, causing a gush of raw sewage into Santa Monica Bay.
The overflow, which apparently began Wednesday, caused bacteria levels in the ocean near Marina del Rey to rise to more than twice the safe levels for swimming, a city biologist, John Dorsey, said Friday.


Honor for Page
LEAD: He was an All-Pro defensive tackle with the Minnesota Vikings, an all-American at Notre Dame and now he's an assistant attorney general for the state of Minnesota.

Question Of the Week; Can the N.H.L. Stop Sticking Incidents?
LEAD: As both last year's Winter Olympics and Canada Cup proved, violence can be taken out of hockey without any negative effect on the excitement and quality of play.
Sure the N.H.L. could tighten rules and all but eliminate violence, but its concern is not the red cuts and black eyes of the players, but the green dollars of the people paying to see the brawls and cheap shots.


Harper Names Publisher
LEAD: Eddie Bell, the managing director of the William Collins Sons general book division, has been named publisher of Harper &amp; Row's newly created mass-market paperback division.
The division will issue its first titles next year.

Kiddie City Tests Discount Toys In Manhattan
LEAD: ''WE weren't sure what to expect,'' Marvin Katz was saying as he stood in Manhattan's new Kiddie City store next to a kangaroo bigger than him (there was nothing to worry about, since it was made out of Lego blocks). ''People wouldn't be coming in cars.
They'd be riding the subways and buses.

LEAD: In England, you can buy a newspaper legally on Sunday, but not a book; drugs in a drugstore, but not dental floss; partly cooked tripe at the butcher's, but not fresh meat.


When Machines Spawn Obsession
LEAD: THE phenomenon is familiar in the world of ''hackers'': a young man of exceptional intelligence, feeling that he is alienated from the system and threatened by the real world, finds safety in the computer lab and develops an obsession for the technology.
Shunning sleep, and limiting social relationships to the sphere of hackers with whom he shares his obsession, he pushes himself to his physical and mental limits in the quest for the ultimate hack, the fusion of elegant thought and computer code.


BROOKLYN COLLEGE UPSETS ADELPHI, 4-1
LEAD: Michael Dominic scored two goals and Brooklyn College dominated nearly every aspect of the match as the Kingsmen upset Adelphi, 4-1, this afternoon in the first round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I men's soccer tournament.


GOING ON IN THE NORTHEAST
LEAD:  ANTIQUE COVERS


Hitler and the Bomb
LEAD: IN DECEMBER 1938, JUST 50 YEARS AGO NEXT MONTH, TWO German chemists discovered nuclear fission.
It was the research of German scientists - working in a country whose dictator had already determined on war in Europe - that opened the way to the atomic bomb; and it was the ensuing fear that Hitler might be the first to have a bomb that led to Franklin Roosevelt's decision in October 1941 - two months before Pearl Harbor, at a time when the materials from which a bomb might be made did not yet exist - to launch what would become the Manhattan


'89 Mayor Race: Key Issue May Be Koch

MAMMOTH IN MORE THAN ONE WAY
LEAD: Mammoth Mountain, in the eastern Sierra Nevada range, though not as well known as such ski resorts as Vail, Killington and Squaw Valley, certainly ranks with them in terms of sheer busyness.
Mammoth, the nearest resort to the Los Angeles area, draws weekend crowds that can exceed 21,000 and had a record season in 1985-86 of 1.4 million skier days.


Long Island Star Attracts Attention in Two Sports

Time to Save the Species
LEAD: To the Editor:


FICTION
LEAD:  IN PALE BATTALIONS.
By Robert Goddard. (Poseidon, $18.95.) World War I was its own particularly disillusioning hell, but in Robert Goddard's superbly plotted romantic thriller, the real evil lurks in a graceful English country estate.

LEAD: WITH a few measured keystrokes, Robert T. Morris, the 23-year-old Cornell University computer prodigy, did more than bring a nationwide Pentagon data network to its knees on Nov. 2.
He has raised troubling questions about the very limits of openness in a society that increasingly depends on an unfettered flow of information.


New Color Film Has High Quality
LEAD: COMPROMISE is as much as part of color film as it is of life.
We'd all like to have an ultra-fast, ultra-sharp, ultra-vivid emulsion residing in the cameras, preferably one that would also countenance underexposure and overexposure without complaint.
Then we could shoot away in all manner of conditions without a care in the world.


Lynn E. Usdan, a Lawyer, Weds Richard I. Shapiro

High-Tech at Home
LEAD: THE other morning, very early, I was awakened by a loud chirp.
This was not the cheerful chirp of a cricket taking shelter from the frosty night.
No, it was a mechanical sound with no personality at all.
Ignore it and maybe it will go away, I thought, as I buried my head under the blanket.
Of course it didn't.


Hospitals Study Right-to-Die Ruling
LEAD: HOSPITAL administrators in the county are expressing concern about a recent court decision that ordered the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla to keep a patient alive by artificial feeding.
Its effect, they say, will be to force hospitals to make a legal issue of what should, in their opinion, be an ethical and medical matter.


Review/Opera; Several New Singers In the Met's 'Carmen'
LEAD: ''Carmen'' is not an easy work to cast.
What opera is these days?
Still, the Metropolitan Opera ought to be required by international law to do better by Georges Bizet than it did in the season's first performance of his much-abused masterpiece on Friday evening.
The production, no landmark of the lyric theater when it was new in 1986, now staggers from act to act without much sense of direction, either in the geographical or the theatrical sense.

Review/Recital; Guitarist's Four Roles
LEAD: Sharon Isbin is a good, conscientious guitarist, and her program Wednesday night at Town Hall served to introduce one valuable new score.
But beyond that, its primary interest lay in its imaginative stretching of the recital format.
Ms.
Isbin managed to keep herself pretty much in the center of the picture, presenting herself as a recital soloist, a duo partner, a co-soloist in a concerto and a concerto soloist pure and simple.


IT'S ART, BUT IS IT PHOTOGRAPHY?
LEAD: In his article ''It's Art, but Is It Photography?'' (Oct. 9), Richard B. Woodward points out that an artist improves his economic situation greatly when his work is categorized as art rather than ''mere'' photography.
One wonders, then, why Doug and Mike Starn, Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine and others don't simply walk away from the denigrating label of photographer and pronounce themselves fine artists, period.

Strange's Lead Holds Up Again
LEAD: Curtis Strange, the United States Open champion, lost the lead in the $5 million Nabisco Championships today for the first time since it began Thursday.

KIDS IN THE FAST LANE
LEAD: I have raised children ''in the fast lane'' of Beverly Hills and have seen the next step in their development (''Kids in the Fast Lane,'' by Sara Davidson, Oct. 16).
I have seen 9- and 10-year-old girls dis-invite another girl to a birthday party because she did not own a rabbit coat, and a 10-year-old boy laugh when I suggested that he join the Boy Scouts, saying, ''Why carry heavy packs up the San Bernadino Mountains when I already visited the Alps in Switzerland?


The N.C.A.A. Punishment Of Kansas Is Not Fair

LEAD:  Where the King Lives, Alone


Towns of Stone In the Downs Of Wiltshire
LEAD: Wiltshire is famous for its strong sense of local identity and of history stretching back to prehistoric times.
It is just far enough from London to make commuting impracticable, and this has helped it maintain a remote and rural character.
Although its landscape is dominated by the dramatic sweep of the Salisbury Plain to the south and by the subtler sweep of the Marlborough Downs to the east, the most typical aspect of the county is of a gently rolling countryside, sporadically dotted with small towns, pasture lands and the occasional forest.

How 'The Devil' Hauled Shaw Up From Hell
LEAD: In 1896, when he was 40, Bernard Shaw's sense of failure had brought him to the verge of physical collapse.
For the past year he had been making a living in London as a drama critic at $10 a week, but the sheer drudgery was causing headaches and neuralgia.
He was the author of five unsuccessful novels and of seven plays, only three of which had achieved noncommercial productions before small audiences.

LEAD: The wallpaper is a deep green, the wood paneling well burnished.
The walls are busy with signed programs and photographs of stars from the Yiddish theater of the 1940's.

Viruses Revisited
LEAD: I HAVE A DRAWER IN MY kitchen that's a jumble of odds and ends.
But my junk drawer, cluttered and haphazard though it seems to the uninitiated, has an important function in our house.
When something breaks down, we run to that drawer and can usually find a handy way to fix the problem.
The old can opener buried under the kabob skewers, for instance, turned out to be the perfect way to reach the ''on'' switch for the coffee grinder when the right way no longer worked.

Question Of the Week; Can the N.H.L. Stop Sticking Incidents?
LEAD: The N.H.L. has the capabilities to stop major sticking incidents.
The suspensions of Rick Tocchet, David Shaw and Mark Messier should be enough to warn players that excessive violence no longer will be tolerated.
But perhaps the N.H.L. should also come up with an all-or-none penalty, thereby when a player is found guilty he receives a penalty of a certain number of games, with repeat offenders receiving more.

Review/Opera; Wrestling With Guilt, in Adaptation of Poe Tale
LEAD: Part of Edgar Allan Poe's theory of the short story was that no detail should be permitted that did not move the story toward its single climax or contribute to its single mood.
There is no justice in holding an opera composer to this rule, but it was hard not to think of Poe's strictures while watching ''The Tell-Tale Heart'' by Bruce Adolphe at Marymount Manhattan College

New York Gives A Bank a Break; The Return Is Uncertain
LEAD: THE kind of high-stakes deal-making that persuaded Chase Manhattan to move 5,000 workers to Brooklyn is fundamental to the governmental strategy of using real estate development to promote social objectives.

Headliners; Storm of Protest
LEAD: The special memorial session of the West German Parliament was to mark the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the pogrom that confirmed the full fury of the Nazis against the Jews in Germany.

'Romero' Finds A Producer: The Church
LEAD: Like any other Hollywood producer, Ellwood E. Kieser spent his weekdays worrying about budget overruns, script changes and daily rushes when the movie ''Romero'' was being filmed here not long ago.
At week's end, however, he assumed another set of duties: donning his vestments, he would celebrate mass for the movie's cast and crew.


KIDS IN THE FAST LANE
LEAD: I think that it is fine to be fascinated with our children, to be able to offer them the benefit of our experiences and to make them our No. 1 event.

For 300 Years, A World Apart By Lawrence Block; Lawrence Block, the author of the Matt Scudder and Bernie Rhodenbarr mystery series, frequently sets scenes of his novels in Greenwich Village.
LEAD: IN ''THE MALTESE FALCON,'' there's an aside wholly unrelated to the plot in which Sam Spade recounts the story of a man named Flitcraft.
One day Flitcraft was on his way to or from his office when a beam at a construction site fell as he passed, narrowly missing him.
Flitcraft then disappeared without a word.


Condo Lingo
LEAD: To the Editor: In her attempt to be humorous, Carol Cott Gross (''Condo Spoken Here,'' Travel, Oct. 16) displays an amazing lack of both sense and sensibility.
The elderly people in Florida who worked hard all their lives, in most cases, to buy those condos and not be a burden to their children up north, should be admired instead of ridiculed.


Prospects; Interest Rates Climb
LEAD: The fall in the value of the dollar against the yen last week raised expectations that the Federal Reserve Board would push interest rates higher to prevent the dollar from sinking further.
In the bond markets, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds increased on Thursday to 9.17 percent before retreating slightly at the close of the week.


Outdoors; Wood Fires Under Scrutiny
LEAD: The National Wildlife Federation recently had some chilling news for those who have long warmed their hearts and hands before a wood fire, but the situation is not as depressing as it first seemed to be.


Minority Students Find Hope in Private School
LEAD: At an upstart private school here, there are no lush green playing fields sporting finely tailored teams.

LEAD:  THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ROY COHN, by Sidney Zion. (St. Martin's, $4.95.) While Roy Cohn was dying of AIDS, he collaborated with a friend, the journalist Sidney Zion, on the story of his life.
At about the same time, Nicholas von Hoffman was writing CITIZEN COHN (Bantam, $5.50), an unauthorized biography of Cohn, who is probably best known for his stints as chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy during the 1950's and as a prosecutor of the Rosenbergs.

A Pitfall
LEAD: To the Editor:


After 25 Years, His Aura Resists The Chill of History
LEAD: FOR much of the 25 years since John F. Kennedy was killed, his death has tended to overwhelm his life, casting his Presidency as a virtuous road to martyrdom.
But in recent years both that life and that Presidency have been weighed from critical perspectives that either did not exist during his thousand days or only matured later - influences like feminism, the Vietnam peace movement, the New

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My fireplace, which was trouble-free for a number of years, now emits a pungent or sour odor after a rainfall.
This odor lasts for several days after a fire has burned in the fireplace.
I have had the chimney cleaned and a cap placed on it, but to no avail.
Is there is anything else I can do?


Swiss Embroidery and Lace
LEAD: SWITZERLAND has been a world embroidery center for 400 years.
The reputation of Swiss needlework was established in 16th-century St.
Gallen, in the canton of Appenzell, and secured with 19th-century Swiss expertise on the embroidery machine.


Iranians Say Carter Asked to Aid Hostages

Other First Ladies Were First in Their Fashion
LEAD: To the Editor:


THREE CHEERS FOR MY DAUGHTER
LEAD: My skin tingled after reading Kathleen Cushman's saucy ''Three Cheers for My Daughter'' (Hers column, Oct. 23).
Since the demise of my saddle shoes in 1974 and the dawning of feminism in my soul, I have been hiding my high-school identity: I was one of 12 loud, sturdy, enthusiastic and precise cheerleaders.


Something's Afoot: More Police Patrols
LEAD: MORE and more neighborhoods are deciding that a police officer on foot is not an anachronism; it is a necessity.


Canada's Deeper Identity NOT Made in the U.S.A.
LEAD: On this last weekend before a national election that will reset the fundamental political and economic directions of the second largest country in land size in the world, Canadians drove their Chevrolets, Plymouths and Fords to Sears stores past the Holiday Inns and Midas muffler shops.
They ate lunch at McDonald's or Kentucky Fried Chicken and bought their groceries at Safeway.

Sununu as Others Know Him
LEAD: A decisive, sometimes abrasive man: That is how some people in New Hampshire view the future White House chief of staff.
Page 28.


The Clearly Unclear P.L.O.
LEAD: Why was the response in the West so lukewarm to the Algiers declarations adopted last week by the Palestine Liberation Organization?
The P.L.O. did in fact move forward in endorsing U.N.
Resolutions 242 and 338, thereby implicitly accepting Israel's right to exist.
But this statement and others were surrounded by gamesmanship and murkiness.


London Does It Better
LEAD: To the Editor:


Susan Edwards and Jeffrey Zimmer Are Married
LEAD: Susan Ellen Edwards, the daughter of Madeline Edwards of New York and the late Richard Edwards, was married yesterday at the Roman Catholic Church of St.
Thomas More in New York to Jeffrey Johnson Zimmer, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Death in a Clothes Dryer
LEAD: Rafael Benitez, 18 years old, was found locked in a commercial clothes dryer in this Los Angeles suburb Friday and died later in Los Angeles County-U.S.C.

The New Illegals: The Irish
LEAD: ''LEGALIZE THE IRISH,'' reads the latest green-and-white poster in the hallowed old Hibernian precincts centered on Woodside, Queens, and the Bronx and Brooklyn neighborhoods where a flood of illegal aliens has been quietly arriving from Ireland for the past six years.


OLD MONEY, NEW POWER
LEAD: As a longtime member of the American Association of Retired Persons, I resent the one-sided article by John Tierney, ''Old Money, New Power'' (Oct. 23).
At the age of 35 (and probably making good money), he finds it hard to conceive of elderly people who worked hard all their lives, living on Social Security alone.


Surgery For Bird
LEAD: In Boston, where the pantheon of heroes includes such famous basketball figures as Red Auerbach, Bob Cousy and Bill Russell, a couple of unknowns sought instant Celtic immortality yesterday.
Based on an initial evaluation, they may have achieved it.


4,478 Signatures
LEAD: The Times reported recently on a new disposable $2 fountain pen that writes for 3,000 feet before the non-smudging ink runs dry.

In Japan, The Quinella is King
LEAD: NEXT SUNDAY AFTERNOON, THE WORLD'S first $2-million horse race outside the United States will be run, and not at Royal Ascot in the English countryside or Longchamps on the outskirts of Paris.
Whichever one of a dozen thoroughbreds from around the world wins the Japan Cup at Tokyo Race Course will earn his owner nearly $1 million, with the runners-up sharing the rest.


When 'Normal' Is Unfair

The event, which is free and open to the public, will include readings, crafts demonstrations, lectures and the chance to browse and to buy books.


THREE CHEERS FOR MY DAUGHTER
LEAD: No wonder Kathleen Cushman's daughter became a cheerleader.
It was probably to spite her mother for forcing her to go on all those Mondale and Ferraro marches.
As for describing a cheerleading contest as ''a wild concatenation of female passions, a screaming, ritualized celebration of sex and power under the sanction of the state,'' I can only say, Hey, ease up.


Teacher of the Year is Named
LEAD: AN English teacher at Berlin High School who blends into her lessons such subjects as social awareness of human rights and nuclear disarmament has been named Connecticut Teacher of the Year.


Question Of the Week; Who Should Win the Heisman Trophy?
LEAD: Steve Walsh, quarterback at the University of Miami, deserves to win the Heisman.
Walsh, a junior, has already tied Miami's season record of 26 touchdown passes thrown by the 1986 Heisman winner, Vinny Testaverde.
With three regular season games remaining before last night's game at Louisiana State, Walsh will easily shatter the old school record.


Molly Ann Hood Becomes a Bride

Edward E. Hood Jr. of New Canaan, Conn., was married there yesterday to George Augustine O'Brien, a son of Dorothy Thompson Fisher of White Plains and the late George A. O'Brien Jr.

Hemingway &amp; Co. in Key West
LEAD: KEY WEST is no longer just a small Southern town.
Since the 60's, the island has become a major international resort, attracting figures from the overlapping worlds of the arts, publishing and fashion.
Even so, it keeps its large black and Cuban-American population, as well as the Conchs, white fishermen and ship workers who have lived on the island for generations.


First Steps for Young Actors
LEAD: ''YOU see, if I was lucky, Harold and I could've succumbed to our silly little passion and that would've been that, the end of it.
And New Rochelle, of all places.
At least if I had been in some nice apartment in the Village, say, with the sounds coming through the window of traffic and people, the breeze blowing the curtain over the bed, like in the movies.

A Forgotten Fort At the End of Nowhere
LEAD: BEYOND the glitter of Miami and the party lights of Key West there is a bit of America that borders on nowhere.
At first sighting on a sunlit day in the Dry Tortugas, Fort Jefferson rises from the sea like a specter from a dark fable.


Cynthia Reed Weds David Eliot Klein
LEAD: The marriage of Cynthia Elizabeth Reed, a daughter of Adrian Pryor Reed of Centreville, Md., and Ariane Wellin of Greenwich, Conn.. to David Eliot Klein, the son of Mrs.
David Aylwin Klein of Stockbridge, Mass., and the late Mr.
Klein, took place yesterday at St.
Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greenwich.


GROWING UP IN JERUSALEM
LEAD: Richard Selzer's article made me remember a winter in Idaho, when I was 12.
The deer had not migrated south before a big snow, and coyotes were waiting as the deer struggled to free themselves from the drifts.
We were small children, not guides, and we had no weapons, but we spent days and nights chasing those cowardly killers with sticks and shouts and anything else we could muster.


Marc Stone, 76, Public Relations Executive
LEAD: Marc Stone, a public relations executive who helped start the widely circulated newsletter written by his brother I. F. Stone, died of emphysema Thursday at the Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto, Calif.

WHAT'S DOING IN: Phoenix
LEAD: Outdoor recreation is the major draw to what Arizonans call the Valley of Sun - that is Phoenix and the surrounding cities of Scottsdale, Tempe and Mesa.
Phoenix has more than 1,000 tennis courts and 90 golf courses within its 400 square miles.
The mild climate encourages these sports, and others, such as hang-gliding and hot-air ballooning.


Dr. Paul P. Vessa And Ms. Ozimek, A Designer, Wed
LEAD: Kimberley Cordeaux Ozimek, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

LEAD: Re: ''Working to Defeat Alcoholism'' (New Jersey Q &amp; A), on Oct. 30:


Breaking a Taboo, to a Child's Delight
LEAD: PARENTS have always been the guardians at the gate of potential danger for their children.
Since there are different degrees of danger, children rely on parents to provide an honest hierarchy.


POSTINGS: On West 17th; The Inn Crowd
LEAD: A suite at the new Chelsea Inn rents for $130 a night, but for travelers who find that too rich there also are $60-a-night rooms available.
All have kitchenettes, and all are just a short walk to Fifth Avenue.


Hand-Held TV/VCR Unit: Breakthrough or a Gimmick?
LEAD: For the last two months, passengers boarding the Hokutosei, a 16-hour overnight express train from Tokyo to Sapporo, Japan, have been given a new toy just for the ride: a combination television set and videocassette recorder, shrunk to the size of a tall paperback book.


Sheep in Wolf's Clothing
LEAD: To the Editor:


GROWING UP IN JERUSALEM
LEAD: The caption under the photograph of an Israeli soldier standing in front of the Western Wall reads: ''Time has not been a great healer.
A heavily armed Israeli soldier stands watch as Jews gather by the Wailing Wall to pray.''


A Melding of the Popular and the Elite
LEAD: A VISITOR to ''Fiber, Metal and Wood,'' the latest exhibition in the series of New Jersey's Arts Annuals, is likely to become confused.
At the entrance to one gallery in the Noyes Museum here stands a life-size female figure in armor.
It is made of kitchen utensils liberated from function.
Across the room is a set of silver spoons for garnishes, inventively designed for utility.


High Anxiety But Few Jobs In Argentina
LEAD: Plastered with campaign posters, the School of Medicine seemed ready for a fierce ideological battle of the kind traditional in Argentine universities.
Yet improving the world was not uppermost in the minds of those voting in student elections here this month.


A Quest in the Park for a Graveyard
LEAD: It was a good day to look for skeletons in Washington Square Park.


Some States Stumble In Balancing Their Books
LEAD: WHY, in this age of technocratic government, of sophisticated fiscal and economic forecasting, have California, New York and Massachusetts struggled this year to overcome budget shortfalls while states like Minnesota, North Carolina and Maryland wallow in comfortable surplus?


Impetus For Reflection
LEAD: To the Editor:


State Buys Farm in Ridgefield
LEAD: THE State Department of Environmental Protection last week purchased 45 acres of Weir Farm, a picturesque haven in Ridgefield to which artists flocked for decades for inspiration.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES: Shopping for Buildings; 'Trophies' Are Rare, and There Are Risks Aplenty
LEAD: AS too many investors chase the best office buildings in the United States, and too many troubled buildings languish without any buyers in sight, the spectrum of prices is extending to record highs and depressing lows.


Japan's Best Movies Aren't a Leading Export
LEAD: Throughout Mitsuo Yanagimachi's ''Fire Festival'' (''Himatsuri''), one of the finest films to be made here in recent years, there recurs a series of images that are initially funny but which, as the film progresses, become increasingly disturbing.


Condo Lingo
LEAD: To the Editor: I doubt very much if the youngsters of today will go condo-hopping, bypassing Acapulco, the Bahamas or such other popular resorts to visit their parents in the condominiums and subject themselves to learning a specialized lingua franca specially adapted to the condo modus vivendi.


OLD MONEY, NEW POWER
LEAD: Each time I read an article like John Tierney's, I pull out my checkbook and make another contribution to a senior political-action committee.
As a matter of fact, I have stopped sending money to my political party and devote all my contributions to the senior cause now.
Ironically, this essentially defensive reaction has strengthened senior organizations to the point that they may be able to regain some of the ground lost in the last decade, and that would be only simple justice.


Pakistani Rivals Seek Mandate in 2d Election
LEAD: Awaiting the formation of a new government, Pakistanis voted again today to elect members of four provincial assemblies.


Anxiety on the Rails: Riders Seek Cures
LEAD: ANOTHER Sunday and the stations of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad are, as usual, oddly quiet.


Agency Says Tax Increase Is Needed to Reduce Deficit
LEAD: Rejecting proposals like that offered by President-elect Bush to reduce the deficit, the General Accounting Office said today that new taxes would be needed as part of a ''credible'' effort to solve the nation's budget problem.


Mileposts Along the Overseas Highway
LEAD: THE highway mile markers in the Florida Keys once aided the driver as the sextant aided the explorer.
Like highway mile posts in rural Alaska today, these state-posted markers were the surest reference for the traveler, and all directions in the Keys were given in mile markers.
Today they are still there on the Overseas Highway, or U.S.


IN THE REGION: Long Island; Recent Sales

An Aqueduct of Cries
LEAD: For some people, travel becomes a kind of inspired lunacy.
This is from ''Kinds of Water'' by Anne Carson, who went to Spain, apparently, in the rainy season.
It is one of 20 pieces in ''The Best American Essays 1988,'' edited by Annie Dillard (Ticknor &amp; Fields).

For Jackets, The Simplest Of Necklines
LEAD: FOR members of the exclusive L.W.L.
Club (Ladies Who Lunch), the hottest item on the menu these days is neither the delectable coquilles St.
Jacques nor the irresistible tuna carpaccio with piquant lime sauce.
No, it's the smashing collarless ringneck jacket a la Bill Blass, which is having high midday impact in some of the hautest of our city's cuisineries.


Tchaikovsky's Death - The Riddle Endures
LEAD: Lives of great men do not only remind us that we can make our lives sublime.
Read with a suitably cold eye, they also remind us that personal history and myth want to tangle and merge.
In the hands of many biographers, truth and fact become illusions or malleable intellectual concepts, as in the work of the more dogmatic literary Deconstructionists.


Immigration Law Said to Harm U.S. Citizens
LEAD: Many United States citizens and aliens eligible for residence are experiencing discrimination in employment, housing and other services in New York City because of widespread concern about Federal sanctions, representatives of community organizations, immigration experts, public officials and immigrants themselves say.


12 Personal Favorites

They've had a meal in Chinatown and seen the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall.
Where else can you take your out-of-town friends?


Angry Carson Says He Could Play Next Week
LEAD: Less than 24 hours after he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery, Harry Carson said today he was angry and disappointed.

The couple plan an April wedding.


Correction
LEAD: A table on Oct. 23 with an article about European trade omitted the value of goods and services imported by the European Community from the five nations of the European Free Trade Association.

New York:  Alfred A. Knopf. $12.95. (Ages 5 to 9)


Rock Label Bows on the Classical Scene
LEAD: The classical-music record business is in a state of churning flux these days, but nobody could accuse it of inactivity.
While major American companies have been sold off to foreign corporations, other, newer classical lines have been founded, expanded or revitalized.
And, at long last, record companies swollen with rock profits have begun - for whatever reasons - to stretch out toward the classics (and jazz and ethnic music and new-age music, as well) to create so-called ''full line'' companies.


Trying to Save A Doomed Globe
LEAD: IT WAS believed to be the largest revolving manmade globe in the world - a 25-ton steel sphere, 28 feet in diameter, with tiles painted to resemble the earth.
But it fell prey to the elements, lost its tiles and stopped revolving more than five years ago.

Judge Rosemary K. Reavey of New Jersey Superior Court, an aunt of the bride, performed the ceremony at the Somerset


Reviews/Music; 'Ghosts' That Alter Sounds
LEAD: Electronic-music concerts can be a trial: clinically impersonal or technically inept or oddly artsy or doggedly polemical in their exposition of a single stylistic school.
The judiciously selected, surely produced program offered Tuesday night at the Manhattan School of Music by the New Music Consort happily avoided nearly all of these pitfalls.


Restarting Radiators
LEAD: RESTARTING hot water or steam radiators at the beginning of a new heating season may produce a few surprises.
Insufficient heat, minor leakage and noises all are common symptoms.


Cuomo's War; Lilco's Victory?
LEAD: In order to intelligently evaluate the Shoreham settlement one has to actually read it or risk falling victim to the ''media blitz'' William Wrigg mentioned in his article  [ ''Cuomo's War, Lilco's Deal,'' Oct. 16 ] .

A Corner of Jungle and Sea
LEAD: As we stepped onto the narrow footbridge that marks the start of the Abel Tasman Coast Track, our packs held a schizophrenic inventory.
Much of it was familiar backpacking gear: sleeping bags, tents, stove, fuel, and so on.

Mass Transit: It's Still A Good Idea
LEAD: THOUGH politicians may ignore the idea of mass transit and push a fourth and fifth lane for Sunrise Highway, it is time we take a hard look at what the reliance on automobiles has done to our lives.

Deng seems finally to be showing signs of his age, the giants have been replaced by a committee.


One Act Redefines 'Neighbor'
LEAD: THIS is a Thanksgiving kind of story, although it took place almost two weeks before that lovely holiday.
It happened on one of those cold and overcast days in late autumn, a time when the sun sets by late afternoon, and sometimes a darkness of the spirit, as well as of the sky, can settle in around us quite suddenly.


Two Soloists Make a Different Kind of Duo
LEAD: A glance through the Lincoln Center Great Performers schedule for this season reveals an unusual number of recitals billed as duos rather than solo turns.

The Fit Of a Princess
LEAD: Remember the princess wrap dress?
The handiwork of Diane Von Furstenberg, it flourished in the mid-1970's, when most women were in blue jeans or pants suits.
It flattered most figures and could be tossed in the washing machine.


Knicks Explode Again And Win This Time
LEAD: The Knicks, who couldn't reach the 100-point scoring mark in 28 games last season, continued their running and scoring rampage last night by overwhelming the Philadelphia 76ers, 141-122, before a capacity crowd of 19,591 at Madison Square Garden.


In Harmony With Brazil's African Pulse
LEAD: AS we climbed off a bus at the Barra Lighthouse in Salvador, the capital of Bahia in Brazil, several young boys, smiling broadly, chanted ''Africa do Sul!'' and held their fists in the air.
I was among a group of African-American friends who might have blended in with Bahia's predominantly black population had it not been for our cameras and sightseeing attire.


FLASHBACKS: Back to Bay Ridge
LEAD: Bay Ridge, in my memory, is where my grandfather drove the Borden's Milk wagon up to the house every morning to get his breakfast, in the middle of his route.
He came into the house on Sixth Avenue, and my grandmother gave him eggs and sausages and bakery rolls for the drippings, and the white horse ate from the oat bag tied around his nose.

Blue Hill Show Combines Painting, Sculpture
LEAD: AT the Blue Hill Cultural Center here is a double bill featuring Francoise Gilot and Minoru Niizuma.

But more of this later.


NEW YORKERS, Etc.
LEAD: THE bride is always beautiful and the bridesmaids are - well, put it this way, they aren't what they used to be.
At least not always.
They are, increasingly, not only an extra added attraction but the source of raised eyebrows, bulging eyeballs and astonished murmurs.
These days, bridesmaids, some of them, wear black.


Children of Choice
LEAD: THERE WERE A LOT of kids at our housewarming party -babies, toddlers, even one or two who were big enough to pointedly inform their parents how bored they were.
The last time we moved, seven years ago, there hadn't been any.
So here we are, I thought, almost 40, and really it hasn't turned out so badly for a lot of the women

Correction
LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the state's Republican Party misattributed the statement ''It's time for the party to shake off the dust and get moving again.''

Robert Adam's Derbyshire Jewel
LEAD: SOLID grandeur, with references to ancient Rome: that, it seemed to Sir Nathaniel Curzon, was the very least an English gentleman could expect when building himself a house.
Of course, it helped that he owned, among other things, quarries rich in marble and alabaster.
But even more than an expression of his wealth, Kedleston, the country seat he started building in Derbyshire in 1759, is a perfect symbol of the pride, power and pomp of 18th-century


CONSPICUOUS CONSUMERS
LEAD: Next to the club soda, Perrier and cat food in the refrigerator are 150 tubes of lipstick.
There's hardly room for such clutter in the bathroom.
That is crowded with 100 or so bottles of fragrance and uncounted cases of eyeshadow, blusher and other necessities.
This shrine to makeup is Margot Rogoff's apartment.


Cuomo's War; Lilco's Victory?
LEAD: Mario Cuomo's comments about Shoreham make clear that our Governor does not have the courage to be a political leader.
Knowing that most Long Islanders oppose the opening of a nuclear plant, he lists a number of reasons why it shouldn't.
Perhaps most disingenuous is the notion that we shall pay more if Shoreham opens.


People of Color
LEAD: THAT'S THE MOST adorable little colored girl playing outside,'' observes a woman in Berke Breathed's comic strip, ''Bloom County.''


'The Nerd' Drops In Again
LEAD: THIS season, three Long Island theaters are presenting Larry Shue's comedy ''The Nerd.''

The Limpid Candor Of an Unspoiled World
LEAD: Among quiet-spoken forms of European art, German Romantic drawings stand as high as any.
Dated primarily from the immediate pre-industrial era - between 1780 and 1830, that is to say - they portray an unspoiled world in which no one is ever in a hurry.


From Royal Court To Rustic Colony
LEAD: Baroque splendors - sumptuous silver wine coolers, elaborately painted cabinets, tasseled textiles in jewel colors and a chimney wall covered to the ceiling with blue-and-white porcelains - await at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, 2 East 91st Street.

What's Happening on the Street of Dreams
LEAD: IN THE SUMMER OF 1955, when I was 19 and the Grand Concourse was in bloom in every respect, I decided to take a walk in my newly purchased Bermuda shorts.
These were the earliest days for Bermudas; they were seldom seen on the streets of the city, and you wore them with high argyle socks.
I was striding along the Concourse when a middle-aged woman stepped in my path, glared at my bare knees and proclaimed, ''You're a disgrace to the Bronx!

LEAD: IT has been almost a decade since the Rev.
Jerry Falwell formed the Moral Majority and since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took power in Iran - two very different developments involving two different religions, often linked by the single label of fundamentalism.

2 Health Inspectors Get Jail Terms in Extortion
LEAD: One was a corrupt New York City restaurant inspector who was so greedy that his co-workers called him ''Hungry Joe.''

Getting Insurance When Self-Employed

Some Variations on the Traditional Thanksgiving Menu

3 Giant Windmills: Is There a Buyer?

New East Coast Arts Season
LEAD: ''NOW, it's a gritty musical.

A Joe Cacaci play, I'm not sure which one, will follow that, or maybe it'll come before.''

Broadcast lenders are now refusing to bankroll what they consider the dead-end of the industry: solo AM stations.
As a result, AM stations are finding that capital is available, but only if they link up with an


The Aging Grace of Roquefort
LEAD: THE worst-looking loaf of bread imaginable is proudly displayed under glass in the Roquefort cheese caves of the Societe, the largest producer in the French region of Aveyron.

In the Marketplace of Ideas, Americans Ask for Protection
LEAD: THE desire to collect the fruits of innovation is as old as man the inventor.
The American colonists recognized it, as did the leaders of ancient Greece.
As early as 500 B.C., in the upscale Greek colony of Sybaris, the Sybarites decreed that any confectioner or cook who created a unique dish had the exclusive rights to profits from it for one year.


Anything for Kafka
LEAD: 'This is perhaps the most important work in 20th century German literature, and Germany had to have it.

STREETSCAPES: Washington Mews; Gates for Protection Against The Threatening City Beyond
LEAD: THE cobblestoned Washington Mews is one of the most unusual lanes in Manhattan, its converted two-story stables making it a sort of retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city.
Originally open, then later closed by gates, the Mews was open again after 1916.


Palestinian Nationhood And Israeli Resolve
LEAD: WITH a larger than average dose of pomp and fanfare, Palestinian leaders proclaimed a new state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip last week.
But when the dust settled and the residents of the ''state'' looked around to assess their new status, they realized that nothing had really changed.


The Campaign Behind and the Job Ahead


POSTINGS: Seaport Condo; A New Tack
LEAD: The developer of Seaport Mews is in the uncomfortable position of having to market what he once sought to demolish.
James Buden bought the 1835 warehouse at 266 Water Street with plans to replace it with a 15-story apartment tower, but then the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission began to consider adding that section of Water Street to the South Street Seaport Historic District.

LEAD: Southern California and Nebraska settled two conference titles and four bowl matchups yesterday while Notre Dame moved one step closer to a possible final No. 1 ranking as it approached a Fiesta Bowl showdown with West Virginia.


Dregs of the Oil Crisis
LEAD: Even the winners have lost.
Fifteen years after the explosion of oil prices in 1973, the price of petroleum in real terms is not a lot higher than it was just before.


A Guide to Village Jazz
LEAD: An average week's worth of jazz in Greenwich Village is like a jazz festival anywhere else.
New York is the center of the jazz world, and the Village, with its abundance of clubs and piano bars, is the center of the center, indisputably.


Reviews/Music; Sonnerie, in French Mode
LEAD: The Trio Sonnerie, founded in 1982, virtually incarnates the internationalism of today's early-music community.

GROWING UP IN JERUSALEM
LEAD: In his article ''Two Generations: Growing Up in Jerusalem'' (Oct. 16), Meron Benvenisti writes that he contemplates fleeing Jerusalem for Tel Aviv.
Ultimately, he chooses to stay and ''watch the blossoming of the tulips'' that Jerusalem's Mayor Teddy Kollek planted between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods.


Accepting the Gambit Is Playing With Fire
LEAD: THERE are those who seem to think that no more is required for successful pawn-snatching than sticky fingers and a spirit of greed.
But materialism on the chessboard often involves high adventure.
To accept a gambit is a commitment to running a dangerous gantlet, especially nowadays when gambits are rarely thrown around with wild abandon but almost invariably have some sort of justifying positional basis.


In the New TV Season, The Tint Is Blue
LEAD: Hobbled by the writers' strike, the fall season on commercial television is finally under way and its content is distinguished largely by an utter shapelessness.
The one new wrinkle seems to be a preference for adding more shocking shades of blue material.

Shriver Ends Graf's 46-Match Winning Streak
LEAD: The invincible one was felled by a common cold and an uncommon performance by Pam Shriver yesterday.

De Chirico - Life After Death In Venice
LEAD: Long before his death 10 years ago at the age of 90, Giorgio de Chirico had passed away, so far as many painters and critics were concerned.
Having created, between 1910 and 1920, canvases of deserted piazzas whose eerie stillness inspired the likes of Andre Breton, Max Ernst, Rene Magritte and Yves Tanguy, the artist vigorously renounced his links to Modernism.


The Early Returns of a Toxic Poll
LEAD: Returning members of Congress will learn something they may not have bargained for when they amended the toxic waste cleanup law in 1986.

Some Variations on the Traditional Thanksgiving Menu

In order to be appealing, these must pay homage to the tried and true, especially with ingredients such as cranberries, sweet potatoes, turkey and pumpkin that are expected to appear on the holiday table.


Crowding the Floor
LEAD: Perhaps because they keep out of party politics, members of the British royal family tend to be adept at the politics of parties.
Certainly Prince Charles made a hit last week as he celebrated his 40th birthday with 1,500 inner-city youngsters in blue-collar Birmingham.


Nicaraguans Crowd the Miami Welcome Mat
LEAD: From the street, the storefront here looks festive, its window covered by a giant blue and white flag of Nicaragua, photographs of a smiling Pope John Paul II and a poster announcing ''Gran Fiesta Danzante'' (''A Big Dance Party'').

Hugh Livengood performed the ceremony.


Visiting Rights
LEAD: I FIRST VISITED NEW York in 1962, when my novel ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' appeared full-length in The New Yorker.

Friends, family, business associates were all making claims on me and my precious novelist's time.
I hadn't yet learned how to cope with success.


FLASHBACKS: Blue Sky and Blood on 10th Avenue
LEAD: WHEN I WAS GROWING up I spent five years in Spanish Harlem and ten years in the upper Upper West Side.
The streets were always crowded with different types of people: kids from the projects, white liberals, students from Columbia.
But I didn't hang out much.
You could find me in my room, or in the park by the river.


Four Million More Subjects; Drug-Testing Technology Speeds Up
LEAD: WITH drug screening of private employees on the rise and the largest Government-mandated program yet on the horizon, even people in the drug-testing business worry about human error and privacy issues.
But they have few doubts about the technical capability for accurate and sensitive testing.


Question Of the Week; Who Should Win the Heisman Trophy?
LEAD: Without a doubt this year's Heisman should go to Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State.
His 31 touchdowns and 186 points scored are both N.C.A.A. single-season records.

LEAD: While South Africa says publicly that it is still studying the detailed plan for regional peace in southern Africa that Angola and Cuba approved Friday, there were indications today that the Pretoria Government was likely to give its assent.


FOCUS: Anchorage; Homesteading Is Still Alive in Alaska
LEAD: HOMESTEADING - acquiring ownership of government land by the sweat of one's brow - was a dream of millions of Americans 125 years ago.
Even today, some older cities give tax-forfeited, deteriorated working-class homes to striving families who pledge to restore them.
That's called Urban Homesteading, a pale imitation of what still exists in but one state -

To Emigres, Sakharov Remains Above It All

Teamster Local, Once Run by Mob, Tries the Ballot Box
LEAD: JUDGMENT DAY is near for the Federal Government's most ambitious effort to restore internal democracy to a racketeer-controlled union local.


Yale Students Lend a Hand to An Abused Building
LEAD: The Yale Art and Architecture Building is the tragic hero of contemporary American architecture.
It is bold, ambitious, glorious, intense, harsh and as frustrating to live with as any building of our time.
It is now a quarter of a century old, and during that time it has been adored and it has been hated; in 1969 someone apparently hated the building so much that he set fire to it, and seriously.


OLD MONEY, NEW POWER
LEAD: Social Security is entirely self-financing, including provision for cost-of-living adjustments.
It has a tremendous surplus against the day when the baby-boomers who don't expect to get their fair share back reach 65.


FOCUS: Anchorage; Homesteading Is Alive, and Sort of Well, in Alaska
LEAD: Homesteading - acquiring ownership of government land by the sweat of one's brow - was a dream of millions of Americans 125 years ago.

Homeless Get Ticket To Leave
LEAD: Church Street Marketplace is a merchant's dream: a cobblestone mall ringed by the sort of trendy boutiques and cafes that attract the affluent shoppers of this prosperous city.
But the area also attracts street people, who are not so welcome.


AFRICANS EXTEND U.N. ECONOMIC PLAN
LEAD: African nations agreed unanimously today to press on with ambitious but painful economic programs for two more years in an effort to overcome the crisis gripping most of their economies with falling incomes, increasing starvation and rising infant mortality.


Picture Research
LEAD: TEN years ago I spent several months doing picture research on studio color photography of the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's.
What I found was surprising.
The images that remained from the 1920's and 1930's were still colorful, crisp and lively.
But a great many from the late 1940's had faded to an overall magenta cast.


Reviews/Music; Adventures For Flute And Piano
LEAD: There was another inventive and substantial addition to New York's recital life - this one at Merkin Concert Hall on Wednesday night.

'Ideas' Seen as a Source of New Taxes

THE GUIDE
LEAD:  CELTIC FOLK MUSIC


Criticism on Halting Of Microwave Study
LEAD: STATE public health officials have halted a study to determine whether radiation from a large satellite communications industry here is responsible for what residents say is an abnormally high level of birth defects in this rural township.

U.S. Won't Bring Criminal Charges In Building Collapse in Which 28 Died
LEAD: Federal authorities will not file criminal charges and will forgive a record $5 million in fines levied against contractors in the collapse of a high-rise complex that left 28 workers dead and 16 others injured in Bridgeport, Conn., 19 months ago.

Francis Prep of Queens a stunning 10-7 victory over Monsignor Farrell of Staten Island in the Catholic High Schools Football League championship game.


Repairing to the Steam Era
LEAD: IT'S officially billed as the North Carolina Transportation Museum and, true, among the hundreds of exhibits are cars, an airplane, a 2,000-year-old Indian dugout canoe, a 1918 horse drawn mail buggy and other vehicles.
But the main reason people come to the site of the Southern Railway Shops is steam trains.

Restarting Radiators
LEAD: RESTARTING hot water or steam radiators at the beginning of a new heating season may produce a few surprises.
Insufficient heat, minor leakage and noises all are common symptoms.


A Hidden Tresaure of Women's Humor
LEAD: FOR centuries, people have ignored, dismissed or even failed to recognize the humor of women.
That is because women's humor is unconventional, subversive and different from that of men.


Broadway Rebound
LEAD: ON BROADWAY NEAR 86th Street, morning commuters push past empty windows of the Boulevard, a new 21-story tower seeking chic merchants for its retail space and young professionals for its quarter-million-dollar condominiums above.
A marketing brochure spares no modesty: ''To live at The Boulevard,'' it says, ''is to experience a constant sense of well-being.


Sports of The Times

It's time to catch up, and the main question is: How soon?

LEAD: The Juilliard Dance Ensemble presented an evening of pleasantly civilized dance, created by faculty members and graduates of the Juilliard School dance division, on Monday at the Juilliard Theater.


GROWING UP IN JERUSALEM
LEAD: I left Jerusalem in 1979, after living there for nine years.
In return visits, I have seen the growing contrast between the two sides of the city.
In the West city, millions of dollars have been spent on parks, shopping centers, apartment complexes, hotels, cultural centers and playgrounds.
In the East city, neglect is ever more apparent.


Reviews/Music; The Stockholm Arts Trio

Laser That Turns Many Eyes and Ears

A Plymouth Laser!''


Civilization's Cancer
LEAD: WE HAVE OFTEN seen in the breast a tumor exactly re-sembling the animal the crab. . . .

PERSPECTIVES: The Arverne Plan; Oceanfront Site Terms Challenge Builders
LEAD: THE name ''Arverne'' is synonymous with urban-renewal deadlock, although it should evoke the excitement of development opportunity.
Except for a cluster of high-density rentals put up for low-income tenants in the early 70's and a small community of older houses that survived the demolitions of the site-preparation process in the 60's, this 308-acre oceanfront tract on Rockaway Peninsula in

Ayn Rand Adaptation By Italian
Made in Italy during World War II, at first approved by the Fascists and then banned from theaters, ''We the Living'' has lost its political urgency.
But it has gained historical interest, not to mention unintended kitsch.
Seeing Rossano Brazzi play an aristocratic White Russian, standing in the fakest snow that wartime supplies could buy, may be the most peculiar twist of all in the curious story of how Ayn Rand's autobiographical first novel came to the screen.
In 1942, the director Goffredo Alessandrini helped himself, without any legal right, to Rand's novel, which was set in the years after the Russian Revolution.
Even Rand's earliest writing anticipated the self-aggrandizing heroes of her most famous works, ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged.'' A simplistic paean to the lost wealth and freedom of upper-class individuals, ''We the Living'' is so anti-Communist that it makes ''Doctor Zhivago'' look like ''The Communist Manifesto.''

The Great American Lockout
LEAD: It's embarrassing having to complain constantly about progress, because progress is really what America is all about unless they've been lying to us.

LEAD: ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT tasks facing each new Administration is the formation of its Cabinet.


Madrid
LEAD: To the Editor: Your brief item on Madrid Radio's ''Buenos Dias'' program (Travel Advisory, Oct. 16) is slightly misleading.
I believe the correct frequency listing should be 657 kilohertz, not 657 megahertz; 657 kilohertz would put the station at the lower end of the standard AM broadcast band.


The Business of Young Talent
LEAD: SOME children are willing to trade in their toy robots and Barbie dolls for a resume and an 8-by-10 black-and-white glossy.

Question Of the Week; Should the Yankees Trade Don Mattingly?
LEAD: Although I would prefer not to see Mattingly traded I could easily live with it, if the Yanks are overwhelmed with an outrageous offer for him.
Let's face facts.
The Yanks have won nothing with Mattingly.
I can clearly understand Steinbrenner's anger at Mattingly.
How many of us can publicly attack our bosses and show up for work the next day?

The Coming Crunch for the Military Budget
LEAD: AS President-elect Bush works on plans to slow down Federal spending, the first casualties are likely to be in military programs where the Reagan legacy is already proving short-lived.


Question Of the Week; Should the Yankees Trade Don Mattingly?
LEAD: No player, with the exception of Dave Winfield, should be kept off the trading block.
Donny Baseball will never bring a pennant on his own.
He lacks the day-to-day power and the personality to lead the team and satisfy the fans.
Moreover, in the last year, he did not take advantage of the short right-field fence, an unforgivable sin for any left-handed hitter playing in the Stadium.

Tampering With the Safety Net
LEAD: THE insurance on deposits of up to $100,000 at most banks and savings institutions has come to feel as sacrosanct as turkey on Thanksgiving.

Casting a Critical Eye at the Met's Casting
LEAD: For as long as I have been following the Metropolitan Opera, which is more than 30 years, people have complained about the unacceptably low quality of some casts.
Justifiably, too.

JAPANESE FAULTED OVER BLACK HIRING

Question Of the Week; Should the Yankees Trade Don Mattingly?
LEAD: Trade Don Mattingly.
He's a vestige of history.
A throwback to the past.

The insipid days before drugs.

Beware The Borderline
LEAD: To the Editor:


Rangers' Granato at Center Stage
LEAD: Tony Granato's finest game of the season, when he scored four goals against the Penguins last month, was overshadowed by the small riot that marred the third period of a 9-2 victory at the Garden.

LEAD: AT this time of year, apples and pears are practically being given away.

For 60's Devotees, a Show Fraught With Nostalgia
LEAD: Once upon a time, and not so long ago - in 1968, to be precise -there was art that did not have its eye on the auction room.

Why Remodeling Stocks Won't Shine
LEAD: ALTHOUGH housing construction increased by 7.2 percent in October, the biggest month-to-month jump since February, many analysts note that building this year is still running almost 10 percent behind 1987 levels and predict a further deterioration in 1989.
Since this scenario suggests that people will stay in their current houses and renovate them instead of moving, some investors might assume it should be a boon to companies that produce materials and tools for the home remodeling market.

LEAD: Last March, in a verdict that surprised even his defense lawyers, Larry Davis was acquitted by a jury in the Bronx of the murder of four suspected drug dealers.

Where Eagles Soar
LEAD: ON a visit to a Modoc Indian battle site in northeastern California late last February, an unseasonably warm day on which the snow had melted, the air was thick with the pungent scent of sagebrush.
Gleaming black lizards darted between clefts in the rocks.

But its aftereffect is inexplicable and its consequences are unfortunate.

I have functioned well.

Playing Musical Chairs on a Worldwide Stage
LEAD: The ideal of ''classical music'' evokes images of grandeur and permanence - white marble columns, glistening stone, immemorial values.

Good Sound for Audiophiles on a Budget
LEAD: Music is an art for all seasons; even so, most sound equipment is bought in fall and winter.

LEAD: Thomas L. Friedman's article ''Proposals for Peace'' (Oct. 30) might be titled more accurately ''How to Get Rid of the Palestinians Without Appearing to Expel Them and to Come Out Smelling Like a Rose.''

For a Bowling Widow, a Split Isn't Just Two Lonely Pins
