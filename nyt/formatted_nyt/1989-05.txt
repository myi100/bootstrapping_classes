But when the Cornerstone Theater Company showed up and started building a stage in their local movie house, Shakespeare became the talk of the town.


A Cheerful Cafe in South Norwalk

Unknown Londoners and a Well-Known Russian (Peter Schaaf); (Eastfoto) (Richter)
LEAD: Last season Ian Hobson gave a three-concert series at Merkin Hall, attended by small but fascinated audiences.
He called it the ''London Piano School,'' and it was a retrospective of composers - some of them so minor that not even experts knew their names - who were active in London from about the 1760's to the 1870's.


Waiting for Motherhood
LEAD: THE flashing red lights of the school bus demanded that I stop.
As the children manuevered down that last large step, they absent-mindedly went their separate directions home.
The afternoon was sunny and warm.
The lights turned off and the line of cars proceeded.


Riding Appalachia's Rapids
LEAD: SOME come for the thrills.
Paddling madly, they raft the Gauley River's Pillow Rock rapid, dropping 25 feet in 20 yards, and shoot through Lost Paddle - a half mile of the highest-rated rapids run by commercial outfitters anywhere - and plunge 14 feet into Devil's Hole at Pure Screaming Hell.

A CHINESE LESSON IN POLITE PROTEST
LEAD: For anyone tempted to think that rebellious Chinese students must be fighting for capitalism and multi-party democracy, a banner fluttering over People's University marchers on Thursday was a rude shock.
It read, ''We firmly support the correct leadership of the Communist Party.''


City Gardens: Retreats Complete With Weeds
LEAD: Fifteen stories above Fifth Avenue, Earl Reiback has planted more than 500 petunias, impatiens, pansies and other flowering plants that will transform his terrace into a garden worthy of a country estate.

RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Auto Racing  Senna Gains Pole Spot: The world Formula One champion, Ayrton Senna of Brazil, gained the pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix as he blistered the Monte Carlo streets in a qualifying best in the second practice session yesterday.
Senna toured the twisting, 2.068-mile circuit in 1 minute 22.308 seconds.


PASTIMES: Bridge
LEAD: The Cavendish Club's Invitational Charity Pairs, one of the world's strongest annual events, will be slightly different this year.

How's the Roller-Coaster Rivalry? Looking Up, of Course
LEAD: A summertime ritual is under way at amusement parks across the land: the competition to have the tallest and fastest roller coaster.
And within weeks of the opening of a new record-holder for height at the Six Flags Great Adventure park in Jackson, N.J., an even taller one has started rolling at the Cedar


Correction
LEAD: Because of a computer entry error, the paperback fiction best-seller list published on April 30 reversed the ranking of two books. ''The Drawing of the Three,'' by Stephen King (Plume/NAL), should have been No. 1. ''Tapestry,'' by Belva Plain (Dell), should have been No. 2.


Pratfalls and Nitwits, Leopards and Hawks
LEAD: Stand back - the superlatives are going to intersect here, the result of the long-overdue video releases of two classic screwball comedies by Howard Hawks, 20TH CENTURY (1934, RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, $69.95) and BRINGING UP BABY (1938, Turner Home Video, $19.98).


SPA LIFE: WHAT THEY'RE WEARING IN ACTION
LEAD: GRAY SWEATS JUST DON'T CUT IT ANYMORE.
THOSE who are serious about exercise - the ones with board-flat stomachs who visit spas once a year and health clubs once a day -are just as serious about dressing for action.


TIME INC. MEANS BUSINESS
LEAD: Among the ''lush excesses'' of my own experience at Time Inc., where I was a reporter for Sports Illustrated in 1956, was breakfast at the bargaining table (''Time Inc. Means Business,'' by Lester Bernstein, Feb. 26).
In those days, management and the Newspaper Guild (of which I was an active member) sat at a pristine, linen-draped table with a skyline view.


FASHION: On the Street; Suits Are the Order For Lunch in the Park
LEAD: Eating in Central Park is usually an opportunity for dressing down.
After all, who needs to get fancy for a picnic on the Sheep Meadow?
But the luncheon held last Wednesday at the Rumsey Playfield in the park was a special occasion, the annual Frederick Law Olmsted Awards, and those who attended did some serious suiting up.


Ross Lewis - Subway Muralist
LEAD: In the beginning there were scraggly mustaches inked onto the faces on advertising posters.
Then came the age of graffiti, when no subway was safe from egos and spray cans.


Q and A
LEAD:  Tax on a Brownstone


For Charles Schwab, a Time to Tinker
LEAD: Time weighs heavily at Charles Schwab &amp; Company, the nation's largest discount broker.
Transactions are down and so are profits.
The days of pre-crash trading volume have become a distant memory, and employees have been encouraged to take three-month ''sabbaticals'' at one-quarter pay or to work part time to cut costs.


SPA LIFE
LEAD: The word spa is dusted with a bit of magic.


Vermonters Organizing Opposition to Gas Pipeline
LEAD: Angry Vermont residents are mobilizing in opposition to a plan to run a natural-gas pipeline across the state from the Canadian border.


WHAT'S DOING IN: Santiago
LEAD: As rivers go, the Mapocho sets no standards for either beauty or might, but at this time of year a walk along its south bank as the river flows past Parque Forestal in the center of Santiago has the feel of a walk by the Seine in autumn.
This is not an accident.
The park, with its immense old trees, dusty footpaths and gaslights, was designed by Georges Dubois, a French landscaper, in 1901.


POSTINGS: Fannie Mae Experiment; Senior Thesis
LEAD: To provide low-cost housing for people 62 years old and older, the Federal National Mortgage Association has made $100 million in new mortgage money available to lending institutions under four innovative programs.

Question Of the Week; Should Dykstra and Wilson Platoon?
LEAD: Where else but in New York can you find someone who has the qualities of a Mookie Dykstra?
His enthusiasm and energy will carry him 162 games.
He gives 20 home runs, 120 r.b.i.'s, 50 stolen bases and an insurance policy.
Not only do I hope he stays, perhaps he should run for mayor.
He symbolizes what New Yorkers are, and want to be: competitive and dependable.


Two Chinas May Never Become One, But They Are Becoming Friendly

Star-Crossed Lovers in 'Delancey'

Understanding and Punishing Teen-Age Violence in Park Attack
LEAD: To the Editor:


FINDING 'THE ZONE'
LEAD: On behalf of my team, I'd like to thank Mr.
Shainberg for his discussion of archery.
Finding the zone is a goal in itself for many archers, transcending competition and score.
For many of us, archery is not only a sport but a spiritual exercise, the results of which - relaxation, improved concentration and better mental discipline -carry over into our daily lives.


On the Big Questions, the Jury Is Still Out
LEAD: IT took the jurors in the trial of Oliver L. North 12 days and a prayer to reach conclusions about the Iran-contra affair.

LEAD: On behalf of the Westchester County Hispanic Advisory Board, I commend you for your insightful article on the assertiveness of the Hispanic community to improve its status in Westchester County  [ ''Hispanic Residents Striving for Political and Economic Gains,'' April 16 ] .

The Minimum-Wage Fight Isn't Really About Pay
LEAD: IN a Congressional session thus far devoid of serious policy-making, it is probably fitting that the first showdown between Democrats and President Bush comes over the largely symbolic question of how much to raise the minimum wage.


Question Of the Week; Should Dykstra and Wilson Platoon?
LEAD: A great ball team is like an ensemble company: the best players in there every day, at the same position, learning to play together as a unit.
Players do best when they are happy with their jobs and feel that management has a total commitment to them, even when they're in a slump.
The platoon system may seem expedient on paper, but it does not work in the hearts of dedicated players or fans.


The Superpowers Decide Clients Are Too Expensive
LEAD: THERE is a new sound coming from the third world - the sound of superpowers pulling up stakes.
From Afghanistan to Syria to Cambodia to Ethiopia to Angola to Nicaragua, both the United States and the Soviet Union are looking for the exits.
And as they take their cold war home with them, both are coming to recognize the nasty, tribal and intractable nature of some regional conflicts that have consumed them for decades.


Seton Hall Treated Unfairly
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


STREETSCAPES: The Half Moon Hotel; A Symbol of Coney Island Is About to Be Eclipsed

I do know that the two men who have delivered my mail over the 38 years I've lived in the same house have indeed been special deliverers.


IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester; Antique Houses in New Developments
LEAD: NEW ENGLAND'S unique supply of early American architecture has generated something of a growth industry in preservation.

LEAD: The astronauts of the space shuttle Atlantis photographed lightning in storms over Africa and conducted metal-processing experiments today as they orbited Earth on a mission scheduled to end Monday afternoon.


When Berlitz Is Not Enough
LEAD: CONFRONTATION with alien tongues sorts travelers into three groups.
The adepts, at one extreme, ''have an ear.'' Landing in Madrid for breakfast, they're able to chat up the waiter by dinnertime.
At the other extreme are the blithely monolingual, confident that pantomime, loud repetitions of their native speech and the kindness of strangers will carry any day.


Wright's Path to Power: From Young Idealist to Debt-Ridden Investor
LEAD: ''My finances are in shambles,'' the diary entry reads. ''With what unbelievable folly have I so long ignored them and let them drift.
In my 30th year, I was the richest young man in town.
In my 50th - well, I'm driving a 10-year-old car, owe so God-awful much money I'll need luck to pay it off. ''But I will, somehow I will.

Reviews/Music; Mozarteans On Period Instruments
LEAD: One of the nice things about hearing period-instrument concerts these days is that the instruments themselves are generally well played and less of an issue than they used to be.
This is by way of saying that when the Mozartean Players came to the Metropolitan Museum on Friday night, Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn were more on our minds than what they were being played on.


Miss Middleton Engaged to Wed F. G. Oswald 3d
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Bentivoglio Middleton of New York and Greve, Italy, have announced the engagement of their daughter Laurinda Payson Middleton to Frank Graf Oswald 3d, a son of Mr.

On Some Ball Clubs, Pitchers Are Not the Weakest Hitters
LEAD: The designated-hitter rule states specifically that a hitter may be used to bat for the pitcher, but why discriminate against other poor hitters?


Jazz With A Purpose, At Its Source
LEAD: The day started with a funeral.
It was no one I knew, but he was a member of the Prince of Wales Social Aid and Pleasure Club, founded 1928, which sponsors full jazz funerals for its members.
While visiting New Orleans for the Jazz and Heritage Festival that ends today, I'd tuned in the Saturday morning brass band show on WWOZ.


Cast Rises to Challenge With 'All My Sons'
LEAD: THE sounds of sniffles emanating from the George Street Playhouse these matinees and evenings are those of an audience in the grip of a great, affecting play.


'I Had Never Heard Such Silence'

I thought swimming was me and my friends taking turns running through the open fire hydrant,'' says Jonathan, 9 years old, the guest of a Fresh Air Fund host family in Massachusetts.

Enclosing an Interior Doorway

No Headline

THE BOY IN THE PHOTOGRAPH
LEAD: I felt the same embarrassment Donald I. Fine did when my father, his ever present Voigtlander camera swinging from its strap, tried to get me to stand next to Al Jolson so that he could take our picture in front of a hotel in Miami, Fla. (About Men: ''The Boy in the Photograph,'' April 2).
The smiling ''Jolie'' even offered me a nickel to pose with him.

Lower East Side: Directors Love It To a Fault
LEAD: The Pat Hearn Gallery once occupied the northwest corner of Sixth Street and Avenue B in Alphabet City.

Nightclubs Now: Lasers and Late Nights
LEAD: THE ladies' drink of the night is no longer Seven and Seven.
It's Sex on the Beach.
The lindy, stroll, frug, jerk, twist and hustle have given way to no-name dancing. ''Call it freestyle,'' shouts one dancer as he flails his arms and bends his knees.


Jacqueline Carr Weds
LEAD: At the Unitarian Church of All Souls in New York, Jacqueline Marie Carr, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.

PHILIP MORRIS'S BIG BITE
LEAD: There is considerable irony in Philip Morris's sponsorship of athletic events like the Virgina Slims tennis tournament.
It seems unlikely that the participants in these tournaments smoke.
If they did, they would have neither the respiratory capacity nor the stamina necessary to compete as professional athletes.


Wallowing in Iran-Contra
LEAD: Let's finally put Iran-contra behind us and get on with the business of government.
That sentiment is proclaimed most loudly by supporters of Oliver North but is heard on all sides.
That will not happen soon, nor can it, for this monumental affair is about government's most important business.


Legal Constraints on Sharing Ideas
LEAD: At one end of the conference hall a scientist stood in front of a video screen, doing what appeared to be a feeble attempt at break dancing.
He waved his arms, hopped on one foot, bobbed and weaved like a boxer, poked his fingers into the air as if he were popping invisible balloons.
A large crowd of his colleagues at the Computer Human

CAMPUS LIFE: Miami of Florida; Women's Hair Is Scrunching Up For Cool's Sake
LEAD: What's up in women's hairstyles at the University of Miami is, well, hair - in stiff, spirited ponytails that look like palm trees sprouting atop the head.
The stiffeners of choice include scrunchers, crunchers and plain old wool.


FINDING 'THE ZONE'
LEAD: I have observed the phenomenon among surgeons.
There are times when these physicians describe their work as occurring far faster than anticipated: time has ''dilated,'' and movements are performed flawlessly.
I suspect there are many occupations in which the techniques described in your article can be utilized to enhance performance.


Like the West Coast City It Is, Seattle Is Tired of Developing
LEAD: BLESSED with a majestic natural setting, this city has always prided itself on holding onto its quality of life even at the expense of business expansion.

Question Of the Week; Should Dykstra and Wilson Platoon?
LEAD: They should play Lenny Dykstra in center and Mookie Wilson in right.
They are both better players than Darryl Strawberry.
Look what happened to Lou Gehrig: He was sitting on the bench, Wally Pipp got sick, Lou went in and Pipp never played first base again for the Yankees.
If a man can hit and field, he must play and not sit on the bench.


More Tuition Was Too Much to Ask
LEAD: GIVEN the sharp rise in the cost of going to college in recent years, a $200 tuition increase - and the first since 1983, at that - might seem relatively low.

CAMPUS LIFE: Miami of Ohio; Serenade of Sons Now Sings Praises Of Daughters, Too
LEAD: For 80 years, students at Miami University of Ohio sang a school song that included phrases like, ''Thy sons have quested from thee.'' In that time, those sons went off to fight in two World Wars and battles in Korea and Vietnam.
But for 89 years, daughters, too, have attended Miami, and a little war has been fought and won to convince the university of their contributions.

SPA LIFE: THE HOMEBODIE
LEAD: My father is one of the few people I know whose stationary bicycle doesn't double as a clothes rack.

LEAD: Here are some of the most notable releases of the last few months.


COLD HANDS

The application of biofeedback techniques allows the patient literally to warm up cold fingers by releasing the spasm of the artery in the hand.
Patients are conditioned to observe the changes on a sensitive thermometer so that they master the ability to increase the finger teperature.


Common Sense Seems to Be In Short Supply
LEAD: Few people enter a theater hoping to hate the movie, but, having paid their seven bucks, they don't take kindly to insult.

Baryshnikov Searches for The Heart of 'Swan Lake'
LEAD: Tomorrow, when his staging of ''Swan Lake'' launches American Ballet Theater's eight-week season at the Metropolitan Opera House with a gala, Mikhail Baryshnikov will be imagining that somewhere in the audience is a budding romantic who must be placated.

Charity and Comedy Both Begin at Home

Freedom of Speech And 'Hateful' Ideas

The Bountiful Tables of the Lot
LEAD: THERE are many reasons why the Lot, as well as the departments that spread out from its boundaries, has maintained a gastronomic culture all its own.

LEAD: If the Canadian Center for Architecture were just a bit better known, and if it cast its net wider to include all of the visual arts, then it might just be confused with the Getty Museum in California.

Raising a Bar
LEAD: Perry J. Watkins made it no secret that he was gay when he was drafted in 1967, but the Army said he could be discharged only after homosexual activity was proved.

The scariest part, easily, is the stomach.


THE SOLDIERS: Anger and Frustration
LEAD: The warrens and alleyways of the Nablus casbah are desolate and still.
For the fifth straight day, the 20,000 Arab residents of the ancient market are under curfew, locked in their homes night and day as punishment for the killing of an Israeli soldier a few days earlier.
But as Moshiko Giat, a reserve paratrooper, and the seven other members of his patrol move through the narrow twisting corridors, pressing themselves tight against walls, pointing their automatic rifles around every corner before they turn, it's clear they feel a strong threatening presence.


Living Up to a Name Promising Much
LEAD: MICHAEL ANTHONY JOSEPH TOSCANO must be a confident man.

That's right, Michael Anthony's Creative Cuisine.
It's in East Moriches, and with that monicker is a tempting target for any critic inclined to take a cheap shot.


A Harlem Church Welcomes A Bishop on Her First Visit
LEAD: When Josephine Green started singing in the choir of Saint Philip's Episcopal Church in Harlem 51 years ago, the notion of a woman holding high office in the diocese, or even leading a congregation in prayer, was unthinkable.

The Beat Goes On - And Time Stands Still
LEAD: ''American Bandstand'' notwithstanding, the measure of a commercial dance record is almost never its beat.

The beat is at most an instigator, a means toward a greater reward.

None, in the view of Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., head of New York City's Charter Revision Commission, who would ban such behavior.

LEAD: CALIFORNIA still has the jump on the rest of the country when it comes to pioneering America's revolution in food and drink.

A Sculptor Who Really Gets Into His Work
LEAD: Antony Gormley is both director and actor on a sculptural stage as spare as anything in Beckett.
He is the mind deciding where his figures will go, and he is the body from which his squatting, flying and tumbling figures are cast in plaster and then fixed in lead.
Even when there are two figures and they seem to be a man and woman in sexual union, the molds were taken from him alone.

FICTION
LEAD:  GOLDILOCKS.
By Andrew Coburn. (Scribner's, $17.95.) Crime novels - unlike mysteries, which usually rely heavily on plot - are successful largely due to their interesting characters and their mood of psychological tension.
The most effective, like those by Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, create sinister worlds we don't mind visiting, but certainly wouldn't care to live in.


SPIES &amp; THRILLERS

Chang on Rise but He's Still Not in Agassi's Act
LEAD: There were times last year when Michael Chang was reduced to a footnote in the Andre Agassi story.
Agassi had flair - a punk rock hairdo and equally colorful personality -plus a game that vaulted him to six tournament titles and No. 3 in the world.
Chang preferred a brush cut and an impassive expression on the court, masking his emotions.

PHILIP MORRIS'S BIG BITE
LEAD: L. J. Davis's article about Philip Morris Companies and their search for new fields wherein to invest their vast profits reminded me of the cocaine drug barons and their search for ways to launder their poison profits (''Philip Morris's Big Bite,'' April 9).
The Surgeon General of the United States has labeled tobacco an addictive drug, so there is indeed more than a casual similarity.

LEAD: If Alfred MacLennan, in his letter ''The Speed of Sound: A Matter of Fact''  [ Letters to the Westchester Editor, March 26 ] , had simply presented his value for the speed of sound at sea level  [ regarding Robert P. Levine's essay ''When the Ballpark Cost Just a Nickel'' ]  in a straightforward manuever, that would have been fine.


MOSCOW CAUTIONS NATO ON REPLACING MISSILES IN EUROPE
LEAD: The Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, said today that if NATO decided to replace and improve its short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, the Soviet Union would consider either halting the dismantling of its own nuclear rockets or developing a new weapon.


Only the Desperate and Lucky Get Out of Jalalabad
LEAD: When the helicopters land, the men with the bundles of possessions and the women in the head-to-toe shrouds rush forward, elbowing and shoving in a desperate effort to board before the machines soar back into the air.


Meals Anticipating The Bathing Suit
LEAD: WITH summer - and bathing suits - around the corner, it is time for sensible eating.
Low-calorie meals do not have to be boring, however, or even skimpy.
It is simply a question of laying off the saturated fats.
The recipes below are substantial enough for company; they have little fat but get plenty of flavor from marinades and light sauces.


At the Gas Station, Help Yourself To Less Service
LEAD: AS gasoline retailers converted to self-service, drivers had to get used to the idea that they might not be able to count on their local service station to make repairs, change tires or even clean their windshields.
Soon they may not even be able to drive in and ask the attendant for directions.


NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: PETOSKEY, MICH.;

Meals Anticipating The Bathing Suit
LEAD: WITH summer - and bathing suits - around the corner, it is time for sensible eating.
Low-calorie meals do not have to be boring, however, or even skimpy.
It is simply a question of laying off the saturated fats.
The recipes below are substantial enough for company; they have little fat but get plenty of flavor from marinades and light sauces.


MAESTROS ON PARADE
LEAD:  A HISTORY OF ORCHESTRAL CONDUCTING  In Theory and Practice.
By Elliott W. Galkin.
Illustrated.  893 pp.
New York:  Pendragon Press.


IT GRIPES ME TO SAY THIS
LEAD: Gripe did originally mean grip, as Roy Blount says in his article, but that's not the point here.
An old meaning of gripe is intestinal pain, and because people with a bellyache often go around bellyaching, the word eventually acquired the slang meaning ''complaint.''  LOUIS JAY HERMAN  New York, N.Y.


PASTIMES: Camera
LEAD: There's no arguing about the usefulness of filters.
With slide films they are virtually a necessity, since you can't fiddle much with the image after it has been shot.
But even those of us who use color-negative films, which can readily be color-corrected in the printing stage, find good reasons to put filters in front of our lenses.


Bob Hiemstra - Fashion Illustrator
LEAD: His talent is to be able to draw in such a way that the result always looks as if it had been done in a flash, even if, as Bob Hiemstra, a fashion illustrator, explained, ''It took five days rather than five minutes to get it off the drawing board.''


Two Suspects Held in Slaying of Cabdriver
LEAD: An 18-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man were arrested today in connection with the execution-style killing Thursday of a New York cabdriver, the police said.


Review/Theater; 'Legends,' a New Kind of Revival Meeting
LEAD: ''Legends in Concert,'' the glitzy Las Vegas revue that opened at the Academy Theater on Wednesday evening, presents nine performers doing mechanical impersonations of stars who have little in common beyond the fact that they are all dead.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My house has an unfinished attic that I can walk into.
I use the attic frequently, but in summer the temperature climbs so high it is difficult to stay long.
The attic floor is insulated with a layer of vermiculite, covered with a thick layer of fiberglass without a paper backing.
This seems adequate to prevent heat filtering into the rooms below.


Banker's Lady Wins Shuvee
LEAD: Banker's Lady proved herself the new queen of American racing by running Winning Colors into defeat and then pulling clear to a 2 1/4-length victory over Rose's Cantina in the $174,300 Shuvee Handicap yesterday at Belmont Park.


Mission Decor in a Carolina Inn
LEAD: WE were on an unsteady course toward the lounge.
A friend and I had stopped for a drink at the Grove Park Inn in Asheville, N.C., and as we walked down a long, wide corridor, I was drawn left and then right, again and again.
I wove this way toward a big hulk of an oak sideboard or that way toward a severe-looking couch with wooden slats at its sides and back.


PASTIMES: Numismatics
LEAD: It's been nearly 75 years since the British passenger liner Lusitania was torpedoed by a German submarine.
The ship's sinking slowly sucked the United States into World War I and inspired one of the most controversial medals ever made.
That medal and others by the German sculptor Karl Goetz will be sold at auction today at the Omni Park Central Hotel at Seventh Avenue and 56th Street at 1 P.M.


Using Scaffolding Instead of Ladders
LEAD: FOR projects like house painting and installing new siding, scaffolding obtained from a rental center is easy and safe to use, and more efficient than ladders.
Units are constructed from pairs of end frames linked by braces and covered by planks or platforms on which to stand.
Joining units vertically creates a tower; joining them side by side creates a run.


MEDICAL JARGON
LEAD: In his response to Morton Hunt's article, Dr.
Weiss insults a large portion of the public whose intelligent command of medical jargon is as natural to them as his own is to him.
No one, especially the patient, is better served by the use of ''everyday names'' to describe symptoms.
How can ''my belly hurts'' possibly supply nuances that a detailed description of the location, intensity and duration of pain would not?


A Youthful Subculture on Capitol Hill
LEAD: They call themselves ''Hill people,'' a subculture of the recent college graduates who hold many of the 19,000 staff jobs in the offices of senators, representatives and congressional committees on Capitol Hill.
They perform similar jobs, associate with similar friends, frequent the same night spots, survive on the same shoestring budgets and a good many of them are at least toying with the idea of devoting their lives to public service.


Ardsley Perspective On the Soviet Union
LEAD: ''Soviet Travel: Friendship and Flexibility'' by Roberta Hershenson  [ April 9 ]  brought back memories.
My son John, a 15-year-old Ardsley High School sophomore at the time, was with his teacher, Larry Mayer, on that first trip to the U.S.S.R.
That was 10 years ago this month.


Puckett's 4 Doubles Pace Twins
LEAD: Kirby Puckett tied a major league record with four doubles and drove in three runs today as the Minnesota Twins beat the Toronto Blue Jays, 10-8, for their fourth straight victory.


Reviews/Theater; Bickering Vaudevillians In 'The Sunshine Boys'
LEAD: Among the more audacious ventures in theatrical circles is the revival of a play that, through the medium of film, has gained such popularity that it becomes the standard against which later productions of it are bound to be measured.


A Classic With A Double Life
LEAD: This has been a season of revivals of unusual works by George Balanchine.
The Joffrey Ballet reconstructed ''Cotillon'' of 1932.
Tulsa Ballet Theater offered the New York City premiere of the 1942 ''Mozart Violin Concerto.'' And the New York City Ballet has just given us ''Danses Concertantes,'' a ballet of 1944 - or, is it really from 1972?


Sabina Martin Is Betrothed

Managua and Its Rivals Spar Over Voting Laws
LEAD: More than two weeks after political organizing for national elections was to have begun, the Government and its opponents remain locked in a dispute over the rules that will govern the vote.


KEEPING PACE
LEAD: Power, control, raw sensual appeal - concepts car makers have used for years to tout their products, have been commandeered by the shoe industry to promote advances in athletic footgear.
Stripped of their tony visuals, the new crop of ads offers no easy distinction between the ''ultimate driving machine,'' as the B


When Dissidents Are Free, What Are They?
LEAD: NOT so long ago, ''dissident'' was a widely used term whose meaning was obvious.
As he spoke out on injustice from his banishment in Gorky in the Soviet Union, Andrei D. Sakharov was certainly a dissident.
In Poland, Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron were clearly dissidents as they condemned a system that retaliated by jailing them or keeping them out of work.


Suzanne R. Lynde Is Wed To William F. Maguire 3d
LEAD: Suzanne Russell Lynde and William Francis Maguire 3d were married yesterday at the Ralph Waldo Emerson Inn in Rockport, Mass., by the Rev.

Precisionism With Emotion

Coming to Terms With the J-Jitters
LEAD: MY FATHER SAID, ''Don't let your mouth get in front of your mind, that's all.'' It was sage advice, if sometimes difficult for a stutterer to follow.
Getting my mouth in front of my mind - words in front of the underlying thoughts - has been a problem for longer than I want to think about, like some threadbare sweater


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Susan Willet Bird was having a business dinner with a man recently.
The waiter came over with the check and, although she hadn't asked for it, he placed it in front of her.


The Soviets and Chinese Get Down to Business
LEAD: JUST 10 years ago, a group of American Congressmen touring the Soviet Union were startled when a provincial politician launched into a remarkably candid and seemingly heartfelt tirade about the menace of China.


CRUSADER ON THE CHARLES
LEAD: Irony fairly leaps from the page when you call John Silber a ''crusader.''


I Know Where I Am; But Why?
LEAD: I HAVE come into the kitchen for the third time today and I can not remember why.
I am not over 60 years old, not suffering from Alzheimer's, but somehow a few of the cells in the overstuffed computer of my brain do not have room to remember why I came into the kitchen.


'Intellectuals'

In Defense of Larry Kramer

The French System For High-Speed Trains
LEAD: According to your recent news article (''Maglev: Fast Trains of the Future?'' April 30), Europe is working on a network of high-speed railroads, but it will use the French high-speed railroad as the preferred system, not the experimental Maglev one.
The French is fast enough, is well-proven and does not have the hazards that are likely if the superconductivity of the

We are building a new society, and it is deep rooted.
The Israelis will have to accept it.''


Question Of the Week; Should the Yanks Have Traded Leiter?
LEAD: Syd Thrift just made the biggest mistake of his baseball career.
I am not denying the team's need for offense, but is a .200 hitter the miracle cure?
Thrift shot a hole through the Yankees' togetherness.
They lost youth, enthusiasm and unparalleled potential.
KARA YORIO  Kinnelon, N.J.


Apoogies and Free Pizza After Racial Message Mix-Up
LEAD: LAST Saturday, David Newell, the manager of Domino's Pizza in Ansonia, opened hop at 1 P.M., a few hours earlier than usual.

Conservatives Find Bush Troubling
LEAD: The conservative movement, which has never regarded George Bush as one of its own, is uneasy over his first four months in office.

New York:  Harper &amp; Row. $22.95.


CAMPUS LIFE: Wisconsin; A Street Festival 20 Years Later: Fun, Not Protest
LEAD: What a difference a couple of decades can make.
In 1969, the University of Wisconsin's Miflin Street Block Party became the focal point for a three-day student protest that left 80 people injured, 20 of them police officers.
These days it is just a happy one-day festival.


Manila Uncovers Mass Grave
LEAD: The Philippine military said today it had uncovered a grave with the bodies of at least 13 Communist rebels killed as spies by their comrades.

CAMPUS LIFE: Yale; Literature Majors Favor Black On Their Backs
LEAD: Beatniks did it.

Even Japanese designers did it.

Often consciously, and always conspicuously.


Rally for Slain Korea Student
LEAD: Riot policemen with sticks and shields clashed with thousands of marchers who gathered today to protest the death of a student, Lee Chul Kyu, whose body was found on Wednesday in a reservoir near Kwangju.

Indy Trials Rained Out
LEAD: An intermittent rain today wiped out the first day of what is expected to be record-setting qualifications for the May 28 Indianapolis 500.


Figurative Allusion: Anniversary Show Of Robust Drawings
LEAD: ''FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING'' is an apt title because the Neuberger Museum show that it designates is of drawings that allude to the figure rathern than describe it.
The show itself, however, implies nothing if not commitment - by the seven artists represented and by its curator, Nancy Miller, who is also the museum's acting director.


A British Outsider Examines the Rules of the Club
LEAD: ''It's not a bad hotel room, is it?'' the British director Martin Stellman says, gesturing nonchalantly at the casual luxury of an elegant piece of the City of Angels called Le Reve. ''Very seductive, very pleasant, and I don't mind a bit of it.
It is a relief from shooting a film in the middle of a damp, dark London winter.


Soviet Deeds, American Words
LEAD: President Bush finally offered a glimpse of his thinking about Soviet-American relations, and it seems a sensible one.
Speaking in Texas on Friday, he wisely called for moving beyond containing Soviet expansionism to ''the integration of the Soviet Union into the community of nations.''

LEAD: The marriage of Dr.
Elizabeth Anne Horwitz, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
S.

Prospects; The Dollar Flies Higher
LEAD: Last week the dollar rallied against the world's other major trading currencies, reaching a 30-month high against the West German mark, an 18-month high against the British pound and an eight-month high against the Japanese yen.
Although the central banks of the major industrial powers - the G-7 - have intervened in the currency markets to push down the dollar, the effect has been negligible.


Question Of the Week; Should the Yanks Have Traded Leiter?
LEAD: If the Yanks were set on getting rid of their top pitching prospect, they should have dealt him for someone they needed: a third baseman.
What happens when Mel Hall comes off the disabled list?
And when Dave Winfield returns?

I use the attic frequently, but in summer the temperature climbs so high it is difficult to stay long.

Judge Drops Hiring Quotas For New York State Police
LEAD: Nearly a decade after imposing strict quotas for the hiring of minorities and women by the New York State police, a Federal judge has lifted his court order and commended the department for its recruitment efforts.


The Perfect New England Village
LEAD: ON three summer days in 1681, the Puritan settlers of Hingham, midway between Plymouth and Boston, raised the frame of their new meetinghouse.
For inspiration, they drew on what they remembered of church architecture in England, then dominated by the Elizabethan Gothic style.
But because they lacked the stone or bricks of the home country, they used the available local material, large virgin timbers.


PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: Most experienced tournament players distrust radical early violent mating attacks - they've seen too many of them flop - so it is a terrible embarrassment when one of these coffeehouse adventures achieves a smashing success.


Using Scaffolding Instead of Ladders
LEAD: FOR projects like house painting and installing new siding, scaffolding obtained from a rental center is easy and safe to use, and more efficient than ladders.
Units are constructed from pairs of end frames linked by braces and covered by planks or platforms on which to stand.
Joining units vertically creates a tower; joining them side by side creates a run.


MEDICAL JARGON
LEAD: The letters from two physicians, Wendy S. Aronson and Carl Austin Weiss (April 16), critical of Morton Hunt's Body and Mind article ''Patients' Rights'' (March 5), merely serve to reinforce the extraordinarily cogent points Mr.
Hunt was trying to make.
To wit, too many doctors nowadays have become haughty, arrogant, too busy to listen, and clutching at the pedestals they themselves have erected on patients' backs.


At the Beach, Jungle Prints Prowl and Colors Dazzle
LEAD: Animal prints.
Bright colors.
Bikinis.
Pareus.
Sheer fabrics.
Beach dresses.
Polka dots.
Molded bras.
Neoprene.
Want to be in fashion at the seaside this summer?
Wear suntan lotion, a big straw hat and at least one of the above.


THE WHITE SHIRT
LEAD: You devoted five pages of your magazine to displaying five white shirts, none of which costs less than $132 (Fashion: ''The White Shirt,'' April 23).
I suppose there are some who might pay $560 for a white shirt.
The shirt itself is very good-looking.
And the price tag may serve to convince them they've bought something stylish and elegant.


Lisa Becker Plans To Marry in June
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
John Ewing Becker of New Canaan, Conn., and Naples, Fla., have announced the engagement of their daughter Lisa Courtney Becker to Peter Seabury Adam, a son of Sydney C. Adam of New Canaan and the late Peter J. C. Adam.

Fighting for Life Itself in a Nazi Boxing Ring
LEAD: Sometimes on the set during filming, the brutality of it all becomes just too much, and that's when they begin to play little games, like the one where you spot resemblances between the Polish extras and Hollywood stars.

LEAD: For Michael Jordan and for the Knicks, Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series provided stunning turnarounds today, and the Bulls emerged facing in the right direction.


Florida

Meals Anticipating The Bathing Suit
LEAD: WITH summer - and bathing suits - around the corner, it is time for sensible eating.
Low-calorie meals do not have to be boring, however, or even skimpy.
It is simply a question of laying off the saturated fats.
The recipes below are substantial enough for company; they have little fat but get plenty of flavor from marinades and light sauces.


No Loss for Words
LEAD: Unaccustomed as he is to public speaking these days, Ronald Reagan has found that money talks, or at least that his talks bring big money.
Lavish plans are being made in Japan to welcome him for 10 days of speeches and ceremonies in October.
Despite a shadow cast by a scandal involving illicit payments to Japanese politicians by corporations, a bidding war is said to have erupted to be Mr.

Steps to Ban Alar Announced
LEAD: The Environmental Protection Agency today announced steps to prohibit the use of Alar on apples and other foods but said final action is not likely for at least 18 months.

No Impostors in This Final
LEAD: The unscientific playoff format of the National Hockey League, often a vehicle used by Cinderella squads to cling to contention until the championship round, was not fooled by pretenders this spring.


Hilary Jacobs Engaged
LEAD: A June wedding is planned for Hillary Lauren Jacobs and Jeffrey Stone Kaplan, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Edward S. Kaplan of Memphis.
Ms.
Jacobs is a daughter of Gail Jacobs and Dr.
Eugene L. Jacobs, both of New York.


No Points, No Excuses
LEAD: His first shot missed.
His second shot missed.
Sooner or later, Johnny Newman figured, he would make a shot.
He never did.
Newman, the Knicks' second-leading playoff scorer, was 0 for 8 in shooting today during New York's 111-88 loss to the Chicago Bulls.
He missed Friday's practice with a sore left knee, but he did not use the injury as an excuse.


Fresh Air Fund Expands Horizons
LEAD: UNTIL Luis Saez was 7 years old, he knew only the walls of his apartment building and the daunting streets of the northern Bronx.
The attractions of Manhattan and the greenery of Westchester lay short train rides away, but he had experienced neither.
Even the world-renowned Bronx Zoo, only minutes from his home, was foreign to him.


WHY AUSTRALIAN WRITERS KEEP THEIR HEADS DOWN
LEAD: So a brash young country goes in for a checkup to the Great Cosmic Doctor. ''I don't know what it is, Doc, but I'm feeling kinda crook,'' he says. ''Something's going on with me, but I can't put me finger on it.''


Soviet Politics Go Rough-and-Tumble
LEAD: The democratization of the Soviet political process has taken a turn familiar to Western voters as a candidate for the national congress used a freewheeling television debate to issue sensational 11th-hour charges of a cover-up of corruption in which he dropped the name of a leading member of the Politburo.


FICTION
LEAD:  CLOSER.
By Dennis Cooper. (Grove, $15.95.) The gay teen-age boys who populate this short, brutal novel are not entirely indistinguishable from one another, but their energetic couplings betray a fatal sameness that is only occasionally relieved by the homicidal fetishes of their older lovers.
Some readers have found similarities between the novelist and art critic Dennis Cooper's work and that of Jean Genet or William Burroughs, but it must be said that he lacks the ordering instincts of the one and the wild comedy of the other.


Give Only Venture-Capital Gains a Tax Break; Rich Get Even Richer
LEAD: To the Editor:


Anxiety Over the Science Police
LEAD: CONGRESS, which approves billions of dollars for research, is so worried about possible scientific fraud that it recently brought the Secret Service into an investigation of one research project to examine the laboratory notebooks.

RECENT RELEASES
LEAD:  CLASSICAL  Josquin: 'L'homme arme' Masses  The Tallis Scholars.
Gimell CDGIM 019; CD and cassette.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My house has an unfinished attic that I can walk into.
I use the attic frequently, but in summer the temperature climbs so high it is difficult to stay long.
The attic floor is insulated with a layer of vermiculite, covered with a thick layer of fiberglass without a paper backing.
This seems adequate to prevent heat filtering into the rooms below.


Shooing Elephants
LEAD: HEADACHES ARE A-mong the five most frequent complaints brought to a family doctor - but no two people describe them in quite the same way.
Nor are two doctors likely to interpret those complaints in the same way.

'Drug-Free Zone': Some Quick Results
LEAD: Regarding ''Effectiveness of Drug Law Questioned'' (April 9): The new ''drug-free zone'' law for 1,000 feet around schools may not be perfectly written, nor is it a cure-all, but in my experience it seems to work - and not only by arrests and sentencing, but by discouraging drug dealing near a school.

LEAD: ON a recent Sunday evening at TriBeCa's Odeon, a young couple, both dressed in black on black and wearing short, asymmetrical hair styles, lingered over their profiterolles and brewed decaf.

The Big News in Tiny Computers
LEAD: Here in Silicon Valley, smallness has traditionally been equated with power, so it was not by accident that the Poqet Computer Corporation chose its name.

Man Imperils Sand Shaped by Eons of Winds
LEAD: The cold spring wind off Lake Michigan carries the sounds of the new season: the rasp of saws, the pang of hammers and the rumble of bulldozers cutting roads into the steep-sided sand dunes that rise hundreds of feet above the shore.


A Corporate Palace That Louis XIV Might Envy
LEAD: Never mind the Louvre pyramid.
Forget the monumental arch at La Defense, and the new opera house at Place de la Bastille, and have a look at a really monumental piece of new architecture in France: the sprawling headquarters of Bouygues (pronounced Bweeg), the multinational construction company, in this new town about 12 miles from Paris.


&gt;Rational Behavior On House Prices

The Games of Girls: Kinder and Gentler
LEAD: While the boys were disporting themselves on the streets of the city, in the days when it was still safe to play on the streets, hitting, slapping or punching among the sewers, the girls were engaged in kinder, gentler (though not wimpier) games.
We played potsy, developing our sense of balance.
We jumped rope, sharpening our timing.


Helping the Poor With Legal Aid

TALKING: Co-op Loans; An Effort To Ease Availability
LEAD: WITH considerable fanfare, Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) announced last month that it was expanding its co-op loan program.
As a result, borrowers were supposed to obtain mortgage loans for co-op apartments more easily and cheaply.
The move was also designed to help lenders make fixed-rate loans on co-ops, which had been difficult to obtain in the past.


In Housing Slump, Builders Focus on Affluent Elderly
LEAD: A SLUGGISH housing market has brought most types of construction to a halt, but one conspicious exception is that intended for the affluent elderly.

CRUSADER ON THE CHARLES
LEAD: I knew John Silber during my four years as superintendent of the Boston public schools.

STORMING MONTANA'S WILDERNESS
LEAD: Why do those who would rape our nation's public lands for direct personal profit label as elitist advocates for the preservation of the wilderness?
It seems the elitist label belongs more aptly to those who stand to profit at the expense of the rest of us.
JOHN L. TURNER  Huntington, L.I.

LEAD: The Hotel Thayer, the famous inn on the grounds of West Point familiar to two generations of cadets and their families as well as countless tourists, will be renovated and probably be substantially enlarged.


Glued to the Wheels Of a Racer's Mind

Brodsky's Challenge Cheers Democrats

STREETSCAPES: 780 West End Avenue; Making a Tall Building Taller
LEAD: THE sales office for 780 West End Avenue at 98th Street opened last month and the conversion of the building's 63 apartments into condominiums is under way. ''We bought it because it was so distinctive'' says Glen Siegel, a spokesman for Walter &amp; Samuels, selling agents for the owner.


PASTIMES: Stamps
LEAD: The short and not very happy reign of Edward VIII as King of England produced a set of stamps that are strikingly severe in design, almost plain.
But the story behind the design is interesting.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  CHATTERTON, by Peter Ackroyd. (Ballantine, $8.95.) Keats wrote a sonnet to Thomas Chatterton, the young and unappreciated poet who killed himself in 1770 at the age of 17.
Peter Ackroyd has made him a character in a story that takes place over three centuries and the result is ''a wonderfully vivid book,'' Denis Donoghue said here last year.

The Rev.
Michael Crimmins, a cousin of the bride, performed the ceremony.


Thorny Issues From the Seeds Of Controversy
LEAD: Claude Chabrol's latest film, ''Une Affaire de Femmes,'' is emotionally brutal, morally disturbing and probably one of the masterpieces of this decade.
Yet it slipped in and out of New York recently, its United States premiere limited to two screenings at the Museum of Modern Art in a series devoted to the film's producer, Marin Karmitz.


At a Workshop, Only the Verse Is Free
LEAD: WE pull up in Lenny's hot-mufflered car, park by the yard where some male prisoners are hanging around inside the shiny fence.


Bosses, Embrace Your Workers!
LEAD: The work ethic - producing goods and services through long hours of hard work - is no longer serving America well.
The reason is that the work enviroment found in most American companies discourages people from working from the heart - from caring about the job they do and the people with whom they work.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD:  For Mothers of Multiples  MANY Long Island mothers of twins are resting today, but not because it's Mother's Day.

Man Found Alive After 14 Hours in Train Wreckage


New 'Circle' Is Suburban Bluegrass
LEAD: Tradition can be a tricky thing.
In the broadest sense, just about all music is traditional, unless it uses unique instruments and brand-new structures.
And in the narrowest sense, virtually no music is purely traditional since each new interpretation alters the tradition in some way - although that process is itself a traditional one, as oral traditions constantly sift promising innovations from indulgences and tangents.


Opposition in Panama Urges Wide Strike to Rout Noriega
LEAD: Struggling to devise new tactics in the face of increasing Government repression, the opposition to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega called today for a general strike starting on Wednesday.


Baby Sitters for Creative Artists?
LEAD: To the Editor:


Schools Without A Chancellor Or a Plan
LEAD: RICHARD R. GREEN may have been unfamiliar with many peculiarities of New York City when he arrived to take over the public schools in March 1988, but he was certainly aware of one feature of the city: the reverence afforded the concept of decentralization.
At first he was careful not to criticize the system, in which elementary and junior high schools are run by 32 locally elected boards.


The Northwest Reclaims a Lost Artistic Heritage
LEAD: OF ALL THE TRIBES THAT INHABITED North America in the centuries before European visitors, few people had so much leisure time on their hands as the nations of the Northwest coast.

Times Change, Sentiment Endures
LEAD: FINDING a Mother's Day card for my mom has never been easy.
When I was growing up, the women depicted on the front of the cards didn't resemble my mom.
In their aprons and print cotton dresses, they were the typical Donna Reed type mom of the early 1960's.


Lusty Regional Portuguese Sausage
LEAD: ON a bright April morning, a wrong turn landed me on Belleville Avenue in New Bedford, Mass.
A huge yellow backhoe was mangling a stretch of sidewalk on a cross street.
In the blocked roadway stood a construction worker, watching the machine and chewing at a bread and meat combination in his hand.


PASTIMES: Around the Garden

Snap faded flowers off daffodils, tulips and other spring blooming bulbs to avoid the formation of unwanted seed pods.


Turning On the Research Switch
LEAD: Time was when most companies felt that research and development was something they had to do for themselves and technology developed by others was adopted only as a last resort.

FOR THOSE WILLNG TO PAY, CATALOGUES OF CATALOGUES
LEAD: The idea of charging customers for catalogues may seem ridiculous.
But the concept could be just the ticket to offset retailers' higher postal expenses and winnow browsers from their mailing lists.
People who pay for catalogues, after all, are more likely to place orders.

LEAD: With millions of twists of the wrist, New Yorkers have saved about 5 billion gallons of water since a drought emergency was declared almost two months ago, helping set the stage for the possible lifting of some water-use restrictions tomorrow.


Drenttel Doyle Partners - Advertising and Graphic Designers
LEAD: To Stephen Doyle, a 32-year-old co-conspirator behind the design of the magazines Spy, In Fashion and The New Republic, graphic design is a bit like driver's education. ''You communicate through layout,'' he said. ''Type tells the reader when to speed up and when to put the brakes on.''

A Debate About The Inevitability, And the Fragility, Of Democracy
LEAD: IN the 19th century, it could be said that there were two alternative predictions about mankind's future.
Marx proclaimed the inevitability of world socialism while Toqueville asserted that democracy, which he saw with some trepidation as rule by the consent of the governed, would surely replace rule by the few.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Debating States' Rights In South Asian Nations
LEAD: LAST week, as ethnic Tamil guerrillas met with leaders of Sri Lanka for the first time, the hope in everyone's mind was that a political formula could be found for ending six years of civil war.
The formula under discussion was the classic device used by democratic nations to make room for regional differences: federalism.


Louisville
LEAD: To the Editor: I would like to note an inaccuracy in ''What's Doing in Louisville'' (Travel, April 9).
The J.B.
Speed Art Museum, while enjoying a close relationship with the University of Louisville, is not ''the University of Louisville's ...
Museum,'' but a private institution, Kentucky's oldest and largest art museum, which has served this area of the county independently as an art museum for more than 60 years.

MEDICAL JARGON
LEAD: If Mrs.
Hunt was describing her symptoms accurately, what difference does it make whose jargon she was using?
If she understood the terms and used them comfortably in speaking to someone who also understood them, the only impediment to the transfer of information would be the arrogance of a physician who is threatened by an informed, intelligent patient.


Can the U.S. Bail Out Thrifts Without Sinking Real Estate?
LEAD: AS the Bush Administration's proposed savings and loan bailout works its way through Congress, more and more attention is being paid to a peculiar challenge: how to carry out the plan without worsening the depression in Southwestern real estate prices that helped cause the crisis in the first place.

''Choice'' Schools Isn't the Whole Answer
LEAD: ''Move for Parental Choice in School Gains'' (April 16) seems to favor Gov.
Thomas H. Kean's simplistic approach to improve the quality of education in New Jersey.
Permit the parent of a child to have a choice of the school the child will attend, and educationally the child will succeed.


Recycling or Incineration? Actually, We Need Them Both
LEAD: THE issue of recycling versus incineration, to manage New Jersey's solid-waste crisis, is the focus of great controversy.

Meals Anticipating The Bathing Suit
LEAD: WITH summer - and bathing suits - around the corner, it is time for sensible eating.
Low-calorie meals do not have to be boring, however, or even skimpy.
It is simply a question of laying off the saturated fats.
The recipes below are substantial enough for company; they have little fat but get plenty of flavor from marinades and light sauces.


The Magic Moments Come the Year Around
LEAD: THE real Mother's Days, to my mind, consist of the most magical moments of being a mother.
The prime occasion may well be when the baby kicks for the first time during pregnancy.


It's a Fan's Kind of Town
LEAD: In this city, sports fans do not do The Wave.
They do not wave hankies.
They do not paint themselves in team colors or wear goofy costumes.
They watch the game.
And they shake the rafters.
If it's mere entertainment you want, try City Hall.
Sports is too serious for such shenanigans.

Keeping Hotel Phones From Ringing Up Charges
LEAD: IF you are staying at a minimum-service economy motel, miserly phone service should not be a surprise.
At the Econo Lodge on International Drive in Orlando, Fla., for instance, guests cannot use the telephone in a room for any outside call, whether collect, credit-card or whatever, until a $10 deposit is received by the front desk.


Why Can't the Movies Play Ball?
LEAD: A couple of baseball movies have come to town recently on the coattails of last year's hit ''Bull Durham'' in the timeless tradition of bad to so-so movies chasing good ones until you never want to see another of that particular kind as long as you live.
In the 40's it was bildungsroman musicals (or sons of ''Yankee Doodle Dandy''), and in the 50's it was westerns - at which point sociologists with a license to babble declared that America obviously saw itself as a frontier once again, but all it had really seen was ''High Noon'' and the best of John

Largely Chaplin? More Like Indiana Jones
LEAD: One of Bill Irwin's constant companions in the immensely funny entertainment known as ''Largely New York'' is a cane, a perfectly ordinary walking cane with which he does certain wondrous things.

Question Of the Week; Should the Yanks Have Traded Leiter?
LEAD: George Steinbrenner's impatience has made his baseball ignorance known to everyone.
So Al Leiter didn't become a star in his first season.
Why give up on him?
Frank Viola was 11-25 after his first two seasons in the big leagues.
Pitching is 90 percent of the game and, unfortunately for Yankee fans, George Steinbrenner has proven his inability to grasp this concept.

Using Scaffolding Instead of Ladders
LEAD: FOR projects like house painting and installing new siding, scaffolding obtained from a rental center is easy and safe to use, and more efficient than ladders.
Units are constructed from pairs of end frames linked by braces and covered by planks or platforms on which to stand.
Joining units vertically creates a tower; joining them side by side creates a run.

Man or Beast, They Are Made For Music
LEAD: Musical sculpture - slit gongs, horns, harps and drums in the shape of oxen, buffalo, horses, long-beaked birds or armless men - are silhouetted against the walls of the great hall at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art.
These figural instruments include several that are monumental in scale and many more that convey movement or the music they were devised to bring alive.


Question Of the Week; Should the Yanks Have Traded Leiter?
LEAD: Al Leiter has proven he talks a good game and nothing more.
The Yankees needed Jesse Barfield's run-producing bat to protect the franchise, Don Mattingly.
The gloom-and-doom prophets in the news media, who are openly rooting for Barfield to fail, can no more guarantee that Leiter is the next Sandy Koufax or guarantee that Barfield won't annually hit 30 plus homers and 100 plus r.b.i.


It's Autumn in Paraguay But Spring Is in the Air

LEAD: Every so often, there surfaces in the international art world a truly terrible idea.
An idea of precisely that order was approved unanimously not long ago by the trustees of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London.

LEAD: Gov.
Mario Cuomo of New York, steadfastly opposed to reinstating the death penalty, proposes to punish first-degree murder with a sentence of life in prison and no chance of parole.

In the Defiance, Shades of Chairman Mao
LEAD: ALTHOUGH their banners call for such profoundly un-Maoist goals as a free press and elections, the students' challenge to the Communist Party leadership in Beijing owes a debt to Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.

Amazin' '69 Mets In Another Bow
LEAD: O.K., so they weren't exactly Amazin'.
Their uniforms stretched in odd places and their limbs no longer bent in the old familiar ones.
It mattered not at all.
The 1969 Mets, reunited, if not rejuvenated, were together and playing again.
It lasted only a couple of moments, but it was a marvelously minor miracle all the same.

Yorktown School Fields Winning Creative Team
LEAD: THEY have rewritten and performed a new ending for Moby Dick; designed, built and powered a car that fits into a suitcase; and thought of all the meanings of a glass of water.

A Truth-in-Politics Bill Gains, But Then How Could It Not?

Fourth of July, Vermont Style
LEAD: FOR SOMEONE WHO OWNS A CLASSIC clapboard house with a sloping lawn overlooking the route of one of Vermont's most popular Fourth of July parades, it would seem positively unneighborly not to ask a few friends over to watch.

Beware: Retiree Within
LEAD: SELDOM does one read of wives in retirement.
They don't retire.

A life of leisure awaits the man of the house, but what about Mrs.

...AND OF THE VINE
LEAD: FOR YEARS, ITALIAN WINE ENTHUSI-asts kept Friuli pretty much to themselves.

It is obvious that they have short memories.


Strong, Vulnerable; Vulnerable, Strong
LEAD: Jessica Lange has not always chosen film roles wisely, but she always plays them well.
As a sophisticated city woman or a gritty farm wife, she reaches into characters to suggest the strength of vulnerable women and the vulnerability of the strong.


DRAWING ON THE DARK SIDE
LEAD: In recent weeks, the public has been bombarded with news reports about the rape of a woman jogging in Central Park.

Question Of the Week; Was Mark Jackson Treated Fairly?
LEAD: The fans did not boo Mark Jackson for missing a shot at a critical point in the first playoff game against Chicago.
The fans have no other civilized way to express their disapproval for an incredibly dumb, egotistical attempt to hit a bomb with seven seconds left in a tie game. (He was closer to half court than he was to the three-point line.) His responsibility was to work the ball for a good shot.

SCIENCE FICTION
LEAD: There was a time - after H. G. Wells and before the advent of paperback novels - when the best science fiction appeared in the form of magazine stories.
However brief, these stories dealt with big issues: human nature (in the guise of the alien), human strengths and weaknesses (in the guise of technology), human destiny (in the guise of evolution).


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Two years ago, we had a new stoop of reddish fieldstone built on top of our old concrete one.
The mason advised us to coat it with a silicone sealer; however, I read that this was not needed and so I did not apply any.
Now the stoop is gradually turning green.
How can I remove this discoloration, and after that should I apply a sealer?


Pitino Talks With Knicks

LIFE STYLE: Sunday Menu; Stuffed Papaya Halves Hold a Bounty of Spices
LEAD: Years ago a variation of this recipe was served at the Mauna Kea Resort in Hawaii.
At the time it was impossible to buy papayas on the East Coast, so pineapple made an acceptable substitute.
Today, papayas are almost as common as bananas in supermarkets, and they are the best choice for this simple dish.

LEAD: THE $35,000 that United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of East Haddam, accepted last year in fees for giving speeches and writing articles was the highest among Connecticut senators and representatives.

PASTIMES: Around the Garden
LEAD: For This Week: Set out annual flowers, container-grown perennials and shrubs; be sure to work the planting holes well and incorporate organic material to aid the soil's water retention and improve its tilth.
Finish pruning forsythia, kerria and other spring-flowering shrubs by cutting out one third of the older canes to ground level.


'Ahead of Her Time'
LEAD: Some called her ''the conscience of white South Africa.'' Others called her worse.
Whatever the view, all sides joined last week in praising Helen Suzman, South Africa's best known white campaigner against apartheid, who decided to retire from Parliament after 36 years.
For years, Mrs.
Suzman was the only legislator representing opponents of the legal policy of racial discrimination.


About Cars; Nissan's New Z Is a Curvaceous Beauty

WHERE GET-UPS AND GADGETS OUTSELL THE BIKES
LEAD: The days of the greasy, hole-in-the-wall bike storefront are numbered.
Independent bicycle shops are moving toward a tonier image, offering not just bikes but fashionable accessories and gadgets.


The Cure Provides Company for Misery
LEAD: In rock's commercial sweepstakes, the Cure might seem to be a sure bet for also-ran.
The British band's songs are an anatomy of melancholy, breaking now and then into anger or delirium; its lead singer and lyricist, Robert Smith, has a strangulated, whiny yelp of a voice.
Even when the band rouses itself for an uptempo song, Mr.


Okamoto Leads the Pack
LEAD: Five of the world's best women golfers - Ayako Okamoto of Japan, Patty Sheehan, Nancy Lopez, Betsy King and Pat Bradley - sit atop the field going into the final round of the 35th annual Mazda L.P.G.A.
Championship.


WRITERS BEWARE WRITERS
LEAD: What an experience it must have been to be friends with Henry James, a man whose standards of behavior were almost ineffable, who might well have quailed under the brutal impact of a simple declarative sentence.
Just to hear him out would have required a heroic patience.
Yet it must have been wonderful, too, his incredible scrupulosity that pursued every thought to the end of its tether.


In Memory of A 'Wild Genius'

DRAWING ON THE DARK SIDE
LEAD: Today's comic books cater to an older audience - the same audience that sees acts of sex and violence shown nightly on the news.
To call for the whitewashing of such events in any form of literature is a denial of the world we live in today, and a form of censorship.
At least in the fictional world of comic books, the bad guys usually get their just deserts.

Catskill Hotels Put Housing on the Menu
LEAD: FOR Sidney and Esther Gerber, it seemed a perfect combination of personal privacy and public convenience: a house of their own, but with all the services of a Catskills resort hotel only a few steps away, from a supper club to a health club, from tennis courts to country walks.


For a Defense That Makes Sense
LEAD: IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE NATO Alliance, which celebrates its 40th birthday next week, is going through a midlife crisis.
For more than a month now, Americans and Germans have been locked in a loud cross-Atlantic argument over the alliance's short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, one that is likely to continue at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's coming meeting in Brussels.

Cantor Bruce L. Ruben officiated.


Noise Drives Recording Musicians Into Quiet Westchester
LEAD: THE music playing on your stereo may have been recorded at a theater near you.

Two frequently used sites are the Sommer Center at Concordia College in Bronxville and the Performing Arts Center at the State University at Purchase.


Trial in Spain on Toxic Cooking Oil Ends in Uproar

'Your Children Are Calling to You for Help'
LEAD: RECENTLY, while experimenting with a form of prose bordering on minimalist fiction, I wrote a story about two girls who were pushed to the edge of nervous breakdowns by problems within their families.
I am proud of that story; it has moved some readers to tears and caused others to remark that they thought it had been written by someone older than my 17-year-old self.


Hannah Toffey Wed to Editor
LEAD: Hannah Toffey and James Christopher Mauro were married yesterday at St.
Peter's Roman Catholic Church in Great Barrington, Mass., by the Rev.

The Old Met
LEAD: To the Editor:


Designer's Rooms Done in Miniature
LEAD: FOR Barbara Ostrom of Upper Saddle River, an interior designer, an 11-by-14 room poses no particular problem - unless it's 11 by 14 inches.
And that was the challenge she faced when she was invited to do a room for a dollhouse at the prestigious Kips Bay Decorator Show House.


Government Penalizes Nonprofit Groups
LEAD: To the Editor:


Fringes, Fairness and Taxes
LEAD: Section 89 of the tax code, little known to the public, has become a famous horror for employers.
Its purpose is simple enough: to regulate taxation of health insurance provided by employers.
But along the way, Section 89 got ferociously complex.
Corporations growled.
Some even dropped health insurance entirely rather than put up with the hassle of dealing with the Internal Revenue Service.


Know Where Your Children Are?
LEAD: To the Editor:


Flames' Goalie Is Beaten And Beat
LEAD: It was not a good time to be a goaltender.


When New Plays Are Made From Old
LEAD: At least since Shakespeare, playwrights have been tempted to rewrite the works of others.
Usually they resist that temptation; if not, they should take on that role with trepidation.
Michael Frayn, who has translated Chekhov's four major plays and has also written his own freehanded adaptation of Chekhov, ''Wild Honey,'' admonishes that it is ''a presumptuous enterprise'' to rewrite someone else's play.


What Elements Do to a Windowsill
LEAD: WOODEN windowsills suffer greatly from weather.

Murders That Torment Those Left to Mourn
LEAD: HELEN NANNERY is not prone to emotional outbursts, but she could not hold back her feelings as she watched the residents of Horton Road in Valley Stream parade across her television screen and plead with the police to arrest someone for the murder of young Kelly Tinyes. ''It's been a week already,'' the mob shouted.


DRAWING ON THE DARK SIDE
LEAD: Instead of redundantly emphasizing the sadistic violence prevalent in comics, Mr.
Queenan might have expanded on the comic-strip creator Alan Moore's reference to Schopenhauer, Bosch, Barthes and Derrida.

LEAD: WITH Memorial Day weekend coming up, thoughts turn to summer entertaining.
Buffet dishes that do not have to be served hot are among the best choices.

New York:  Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. $22.50.


Backpacking Along the Pacific Shore
LEAD: CIVILIZATION clings to the water, so shorelines number among our most domesticated landscapes.
It is a dismaying reality for the backpacker, who longs for the seaside but wants to escape humanity and its artifacts.
A happy exception is found in Washington's Olympic National Park, at the upper-left-hand corner of the map, where an unexpected wilderness stands as wild today as it was when 16th-century mariners worked their way up the West Coast in search of the elusive Northwest

Precision for Precision's Sake in a Show by Virtuoso Realists
LEAD: ART revolutions come and go, but Andrew Wyeth still plays to packed houses.

STREETSCAPES: The Carroll Street Bridge; Getting a Landmark in Shape for Its 100th Birthday
LEAD: THE Department of Transportation is racing to meet a deadline for reopening the little Carroll Street Bridge across the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn.
The unusual 1889 retractile-type bridge - the oldest in the country - has been left open since 1986, but the department has been repairing it since last December and it should be working in time for its 100th anniversary on Sept.


KING BHUMIBOL'S REIGN
LEAD: THE HELICOPTER HAS JUST touched down, stirring the dust of a parched land waiting for summer rains, when its door opens and silk parasols, borne by guards in the costumes of an ancient Asian court, float above the head of the slender, solemn man in military uniform emerging from the aircraft.
King Bhumibol Adulyadej,

Kloman's daughter Laura Delano Roosevelt to Dr.

A January wedding is planned.


Pitcher Perfect
LEAD: IN THE LAND OF SHADE TREES AND PEONY beds, of linen shirts and bare feet, of friends bunched on the deck and families strewn all over the lawn, the cocktail can no longer be assumed to be king.
More and more, an icy pitcher full of punch - which used to seem such a throwback, such an archaism, such a dodge - strikes a lot of people as up-to-the-minute and just right.


TV Steps Into the Fray, and Alters It
LEAD: Nothing so confirmed the power of television as a force in world opinion as the dramatic live broadcasts to the United States on Friday night of Chinese bureaucrats shutting the networks down.

LEAD: Monique Jeannette Vos, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The Annual Event: Family Cookout On Long Island
LEAD: THE YEARLY CLAMBAKE, ONE OF TWO annual McGuinness family reunions, began at dawn on a typically foggy late-July morning in Lloyd Harbor on the North Shore of Long Island.
By 6 A.M., with the mist settling on top of the trees, 6 of the 31 people who would ultimately cram into the McGuinness house on this day had set off to comb the beach at Cold Spring Harbor for mussels.


U.S. Warning on China Trips
LEAD: The State Department recommended today that Americans planning to visit China delay their trips for the next 72 hours because of the political unrest there.


BEYOND THE QUARK
LEAD: As a lay person, I read with fascination James Trefil's lucid discussion of the proposed Superconducting Supercollider and the scientific discoveries it may yield (''Beyond the Quark,'' April 30).
As a cynic, I am moved to wonder what military applications could motivate Congress to spend $4.4 billion on the project.


Successful Failures
LEAD: To the Editor:


PASTIMES: Stamps
LEAD: Looking back over a year's worth of mail from readers, two problems seem so common that they deserve some solutions in print.


A Gesture To the 'Good' Rockefeller Center
LEAD: Almost everybody loves Rockefeller Center, or at least the original part of it constructed in the 1930's between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas.
This is not just a cluster of buildings in New York City: it is a national symbol of distinguished corporate design, far and away the finest grouping of skyscrapers ever built.


DRAWING ON THE DARK SIDE
LEAD: I have recently become a comic-book addict, although I hardly fit the description of the typical comic-book reader.
I am a 45-year-old mother of two sons, 11 and 15 years old, and I have a Ph.D. in biochemistry.
I think Joe Queenan has made a mountain out of a molehill about the dark side of comic books.


Jersey City Journal; State Questions Legality of an Out-of-State Lotteries Business

Western Conference finals.


BLURRING THE LINE BETWEEN FACT AND FICTION
LEAD: As a television commodity, ''reality'' is being packaged for market faster than sneaker commercials these days.
Major based-on-fact network movies in the last few weeks have included ''A Deadly Silence'' with its account of an incest case in Long Island, ''Guts and Glory'' and its version of the rise and fall of Oliver North, and ''Roe v.


This Versatile Stereo Receiver Adapts to Changing Habitats
LEAD: The close resemblance between different brands of stereo receivers is easily explained.
Their manufacturers mostly imitate each other, which is the safe and sensible thing to do in the absence of a better idea.
Occasionally, however, a flash of originality sets certain models apart.
A case in point is the expandable receiver by Rotel, a company renowned in


Primitive Dreams Are Hitting The Big Time
LEAD: ''The natives are extremely fond of painting,'' wrote Thomas Watling, an Australian convict, almost 200 years ago.
The aborigines, who have inhabited the Australian continent for an estimated 50,000 years, have been painting on sand, bark and their own bodies for the last 30,000.
Suddenly their fondness for painting, now in acrylics on canvas, is landing them squarely in the lap of the international art world, for which they are adapting their grand creation myths, maps of the land and ceremonial symbols to the West's easel- painting tradition.


Commander Says Coast Guard Couldn't Have Stopped Spill
LEAD: The Coast Guard's controllers of ship traffic could not have prevented the tanker Exxon Valdez from running aground in Prince William Sound, the commanding officer of the station said today at hearings into the Alaska oil spill.

By Stanley Fish.  613 pp.
Durham, N.C.:  Duke University Press. $37.50.


Why Schnabel's Mozart Works So Well
LEAD: Old recordings are antiques, but antiques of a most ephemeral kind.
Indeed, collecting them points up an important difference between music and the visual arts.
To hold 18th-century majolica in the hand, for example, is to know the true thrill of possession, a thrill impossible without the presence of ther object.


IN QUOTES
LEAD: ''When was the last time you listened to rock-and-roll?
Comedy is the rock-and-roll of the 90's.''
Michael J. Fuchs,
chairman and chief executive of HBO.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Two years ago, we had a new stoop of reddish fieldstone built on top of our old concrete one.
The mason advised us to coat it with a silicone sealer; however, I read that this was not needed and so I did not apply any.
Now the stoop is gradually turning green.
How can I remove this discoloration, and after that should I apply a sealer?


For 7 Palestinians Accused in the Uprising, Common Thread Is Journalism

A Centennial Effort to Add Cancer Unit
LEAD: PORT CHESTER, February 1889.
Fourteen Port Chester matrons, concerned over the plight of the sick and infirm in the community, form the Ladies Hospital Association, ''to serve humanity, to save lives and to relieve suffering.''

WHO'S TO JUDGE?
LEAD: DR.
ELIZABETH MORGAN, 41 YEARS OLD, A HAR-vard-, Oxford- and Yale-educated plastic surgeon and author of four books, adjusts a recalcitrant snap on her orange prison jumpsuit, leans forward in the glass-walled room of the Washington, D.C., jail and explains a decision she made that sent her to prison 21 months ago: ''I had to face the fact that for one year I sent my child off to her rapist.


Reviews/Music; Joan Osborne Sings Blues
LEAD: The blues-bar circuit doesn't exactly encourage subtlety or originality.
For up-and-coming performers who are attached to blues and old-fashioned soul music, however, it's the only circuit there is, and every so often there's a glimpse of real bluesy depth.
Joan Osborne, who sang Thursday night at Mondo Cane, doesn't pretend to be anything other than white and northern.


Now We Know: Home Is Where the Art Is
It's all a matter of perspective, of ratio.
To the New York-based observer, American movie making has looked pretty paltry this year, mostly big-budget mass-market comedies of no distinction and even less humor.
Three thousand miles away, the scene suddenly takes on a different, far more promising aspect.
On the basis of two films shown on the second and third days of this 42d Cannes International Film Festival, one might think that American films are in the midst of some kind of crazy renaissance.


Alison Sondhaus Wed to A. J. Carroll, A Peace Corps Lawyer, in Washington
LEAD: The wedding of Alison Jean Sondhaus to Anthony J. Carroll took place yesterday at St.
Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington.
The Rev.
Gregory Weider performed the ceremony.


POSTINGS: Jersey Farmland Development; Houses Amid Rolling Hills
LEAD: When James Pitney took title to his brother Jonathan's farm in 1771, the property was one of the most extensive in northern New Jersey.
It had been assembled by Pitneys since the first of them, also named James, settled in the area earlier in the century.
There was little more around then than gently rolling hills, woodlands and meadows, criss-crossed here and there by streams and by narrow, winding paths.


Health Efforts Widen on a Fetal Danger
LEAD: WHEN Joanne B. learned that she was pregnant, she was determined to have a healthy baby.
She quit smoking.
She stopped taking over-the-counter cold medicines.
She sought medical advice about drinking and was assured that ''one drink won't hurt.''


AMERICAN MODELS TAKE THE ROUGH TERRAIN
LEAD: Imports may be dominating the United States bicycle market, but domestic bike makers are finding ways to stay in the race.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: New Times Square Hotels; 3 Hostelries to Join the Marquis, a Hit on Broadway
LEAD: A HOTEL construction boom surpassing any that Times Square has seen in more than half a century is now under way, and by late next year three new hotels will be competing with one prosperous pioneer, the Marriott Marquis, which opened four years ago amid predictions that the area's seedy reputation would do it in.


Putnam Landfill Plans Raise an Outcry
LEAD: WHEN Putnam County released a list ranking 20 potential sites for a countywide landfill three months ago, its neighbors in northern Westchester paid little attention.
But now they have discovered that four of the sites are in their backyards.


Luxembourg
LEAD: For years, perhaps for centuries, Luxembourg has usually been an afterthought on a European tour.
Although poets as disparate as Racine and Goethe sang its low-key charms, the vest-pocket country was usually a rest stop on the way to the station or a jumping-off place for wine tasting in the Moselle Valley.


ADVISER TO BUSH GETS H.U.D. SUBSIDY
LEAD: A top campaign strategist for both President Bush and Ronald Reagan is benefiting from a Federal housing subsidy progam that is under investigation because of the large number of prominent Republicans who have been able to obtain millions of dollars in payments as consultants or developers.


A One-of-a-Kind Experience
LEAD: THE American Hotel dates to 1846, when Sag Harbor and its whaling fleets were in their heyday.
Seventeen years ago, it was restored and its restaurant has earned high marks for fine food and a voluminous wine list ever since.


And the Babies Had Fun, Too
LEAD: WHEN I WAS growing up, my mother tells me, every neighborhood had a play group.
For three hours or so, in the morning or the afternoon, they met at someone's house, and the children ran in circles amusing themselves while the mothers drank iced tea and giggled. ''Oh, we giggled a lot,'' my mother, who is not the giggly sort, tells me.


Violence Flares at Berkeley Park During Event Marking 60's Battle
LEAD: May 20 - A rampage that began Friday night raged into this morning during a commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the violence that followed the takeover of People's Park by the University of California.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD:  Horse Doctor  SPRINGTIME is a special time at Long Island's horse farms.
Gangly foals on legs twice too big for them greet visitors shyly from the security of their mothers' flanks.

Armed Only With Optimism, China's People Rise Again
LEAD: ONE of the greatest living Chinese writers, Bo Yang, a 69-year-old social critic now living in Taiwan, was deeply depressed when he visited Beijing late last year after a 40-year absence. ''I went to Beijing University and spoke to some students,'' he recalled in an interview earlier this year, ''and they gathered round and asked me: 'How can we save China?


Long Island Needs Military Spending
LEAD: Who would have ever thought that some Long Island congressmen would actually be strongly against jobs for Long Island (''U.S. Decision to Curb F-14 Sends a Jolt to Economy,'' April 30).
What I hope the people of Long Island are finally realizing is that when a congressman is anti-defense, he is anti-Long Island.


Survivors Heal Slowly Where 5 Children Died
LEAD: At recess at the Cleveland Elementary School here, children cower near the building so they can run for cover if the shooting starts again.
Teachers scan the adjoining streets wondering which stranger is an intruder, and parents gather outside the chain-link fence, worried and watchful.

In Friuli, Enjoying the Fruits of the Sea...
LEAD: UP IN FRIULI, THE ITALIAN RE-gion wedged into the northeastern corner of the country between the Alps and the Adriatic, people take great pride in what they like to call their native reserve.
Walter Filiputti, the winemaker at the Abbazia di Rosazzo, a winery on the grounds of an 11th-century abbey that is an hour's drive north of Venice, is a typical Friulano.


Financial Decision
LEAD: When Oral Roberts University withdrew from the National Collegiate Athletic Association earlier this month, the official explanation was offered by the basketball coach, Ken Trickey.
He said the switch to the low-key National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics was strictly a financial decision to save the beleaguered university $500,000 to $1 million a year.

LEAD: Chinese nationals and emigres in major cities across the United States rallied to the support of China's widening democracy movement yesterday with protests against the Beijing Government and calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Li Peng.


Kids + Restaurants - A Growing Trend
LEAD: WHEN JACK JELENKO AND HIS wife, Margaret, dine out near their home in Sonoma County, California, their priorities are not always titillating cuisine or an enchanting atmosphere.
Rather, they tend to look for a place where tables are uncluttered, service is rapid-fire and much of the food is plain and familiar.


Susan L. Quarles Marries Producer
LEAD: Susan Linda Quarles and Geoffrey Stephens were married yesterday at the Heights Town House in Brooklyn Heights by the Rev.
Harris Riordan, a Unitarian minister.


Reviews/Dance; Harlem Ground Is Broken For National Black Theater

Mets Are Done In By Power, Pitching
LEAD: There really wasn't much Darryl Strawberry could do.
He moved slightly in pursuit of Will Clark's enormous shot before conceding the inevitable and stopping, not even bothering to look.
He looked a little longer at and ran a little farther after Kevin Mitchell's rocket five pitches later before acknowledging that it, too, was out of the park.

LEAD: On a trip during the winter, Jeff Torborg, the new manager of the Chicago White Sox, was talking to Harold Baines about hitting.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Life hasn't been easy these past few weeks.
Walking in rain that seemed almost constant required not only agility but also planning - and a dash of prescience.
The reservoirs may now be in good shape, but pedestrians are still recovering from maneuvering on walking surfaces that turned into wet battlefields.


On the Road With 'Legends!' And Its Legends
LEAD: I don't remember when the idea struck me to write a play about two feuding actresses, legends in their time, who were somewhat over the hill, had made one film together that was a box-office hit but represented personal hell during the making.
What if one of them, Sylvia, always played the Joan Crawford parts, the one who started out scrubbing dishes in a diner and was going to make it to Chicago if she had to step over her mother, 12 orphans, several politicians and 23 lovers.


A Silk To Suit The Faded Denim Set

But there is one role he has never played: chef.
That he reserves for his private life.

LEAD: THE happiest person in Pennsylvania last month may have been Alverta Handel, a housekeeper from the town of Portage who beat 9.6 million-to-one odds to win an $8.2 million share of the record-breaking $115 million lotto jackpot.
But the biggest winner by far in Pennsylvania's lottery is the state treasury, which last year netted $593 million from ticket sales.


DRAWING ON THE DARK SIDE
LEAD: To characterize an entire industry as ''determined to dispel any lingering notion that its products are for children'' is incorrect.
One need only glance at the comics issued by Archie Comic Publications (''Betty and Veronica,'' ''Jughead''), Father Tree Press (''Elfquest''), Another Rainbow/Gladstone (''Mickey Mouse'' and ''Donald Duck'') and the revival of Classics Illustrated by the Berkley Publishing Group, First Publishing and Classics Media Group.


A Buffet Dish For Serving Cold

Buffet dishes that do not have to be served hot are among the best choices.

Reviews/Theater; Sending Up Musicals, In 'Laughing Matters'

Booking Soviet Musicians Is Not Yet a Bowl of Borscht
LEAD: With all due respect to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, doing business with the Soviets, whether the product be ballet or ball bearings, can evoke Dostoyevsky and the Marx Brothers in equal measure.
Just ask the American impresarios who regularly import Soviet dancers and musicians.

All Must Share In Health Care
LEAD: In ''The Sickening Cost of Getting Sick'' (Opinion page, April 30), Richard Elsberry expresses dismay that patients like himself ''smart enough to have health insurance or money in the bank'' are forced to support medical care for the ''poor and indigent.'' Until the state finds a ''kinder and gentler way'' (do I read lips in assuming this does not mean raising taxes?), he proposes an interim solution: the less smart should ''seek more affordable care out of state.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Two years ago, we had a new stoop of reddish fieldstone built on top of our old concrete one.
The mason advised us to coat it with a silicone sealer; however, I read that this was not needed and so I did not apply any.
Now the stoop is gradually turning green.
How can I remove this discoloration, and after that should I apply a sealer?


BEYOND THE QUARK
LEAD: It would be foolish and wasteful to spend $4.4 billion on the Superconducting Supercollider when newer and superior technology -plasma particle accelerators, as reported in the March issue of Scientific American - is being proposed.
The whole question of the S.S.C. deserves another look.
We should pursue the development of a machine that could prove to be much cheaper and produce more power (faster particles).

The Past Needs to Look Ahead
LEAD: After one calling-card concert, it is too soon to say with confidence that the arrival of Trevor Pinnock's Classical Band has filled a gap in New York's musical picture.

Koch made gloomy predictions about New York City's fiscal prospects and appeared to be readying himself to run for re-election as ''the Mayor who could say no.''

Reviews/Music; Renaissance Sounds
LEAD: The first half of Calliope's program Tuesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall brought the familiar piping, buzzing, tinkling and droning sounds of a Renaissance consort playing works by Praetorius, Isaac, Des Prez and their less-known or unknown fellows.
It was pleasant and jolly in the usual way: the sounds of the old instruments have lost little of their piquant flavor; the actual music making is a little on the light side; the Calliope foursome's determinedly down-home vocal contributions create the right atmosphere.


Correction
LEAD: An article on page 31 of the Arts and Leisure section today about aboriginal artists misstates the commission that the John Weber Gallery receives for sales of their work.

Greco: Makeup Artist

Take &gt;stab in the back.


A WEstport Tribute To Dorothy Parker
LEAD: ''I NEEDED someone with a quicker wit than mine,'' Prince sang in his ''Ballad of Dorothy Parker'' in 1987.

LEAD: Because of the lack of affordable quality child-care programs, most parents are at a disadvantage when searching for a child-care program.

WHO'S THAT MAN WITH MARILYN HORNE?
LEAD: My husband and I enjoyed reading Barbara Jepson's article on accompanists and are glad to see they are getting the recognition and payment due them (''Who's That Man With Marilyn Horne? April 16).

Fleeing Jackson Hole's Bustle of Jackson Hole

The great, glaciered peaks of the Tetons, arguably the continent's most classically beautiful mountains, soar more than a mile into the air from the valley floor.
A half-dozen pristine alpine lakes puddle at the base of the range, and the braided channels of the Snake River meander through the valley's lush meadows, sagebrush flats and groves of willow, cottonwood and aspen.


DRAWING ON THE DARK SIDE
LEAD: Joe Queenan might have added a little light by reporting that Marvel also publishes inspiring comics, such as ''Mother Teresa of Calcutta'' and ''The Life of Pope John-Paul II.''

A Wilderness Named for the Gods
LEAD: DEEP inside the Olympic rain forest on the far western edge of the continent, there is not a fingerprint of the 20th century, nor the 18th century for that matter.

Reviews/Theater; Mark Medoff Tells of Softness in a Macho World
LEAD: One would have to search hard to find a playwright more obsessed with machismo, heroism and psychic emasculation than Mark Medoff.

A Camcorder Wins a Battle, But Can It Win the War?
LEAD: Now in its fifth year, the rivalry between camcorder formats seems endless, pointless and confusing.
But videophiles are willy-nilly forced to take sides.
They must choose one of the two contesting formats - VHS or 8-millimeter - when buying a camcorder, and naturally they'd like to pick the winner.

Eastwood As a Tracker In 'Pink Cadillac'
When it's time to look back on the strange sweep of Clint Eastwood's career, from his ambitious direction of ''Bird'' to his coarse, classic Dirty Harry character, ''Pink Cadillac'' will probably settle comfortably near the bottom of the list.
It is the laziest sort of action comedy, with lumbering chase scenes, a dull-witted script and the charmless pairing of Mr.
Eastwood and Bernadette Peters.
Ms.
Peters plays Lou Ann, the innocent wife of an ex-convict who belongs to a well-armed white supremacist group called the Birthright.
When the group's cache of counterfeit money is found in her trailer, Lou Ann is arrested.
Leaving her baby daughter with her sister, she gets in her husband's old pink Cadillac - which happens to be so full of hidden money that bills eventually fly out onto the highway - and jumps bail.

BEIRUT DIARY
LEAD: APRIL 17, 1989: Sporadic shelling this morning.
I drive home from my office at midday with a 25-liter canister of gasoline for my electric generator.

Resources for Treating Child Sexual Abuse
LEAD: There can never be enough said about child sexual abuse  [ ''The Lasting Scar of Sexual Abuse,'' April 23 ] , a topic too long and too often shrouded in secrecy.
As we as a society continue to lift the lid on this pot boiling over with shame and turmoil, it is important to note all the resources we have on Long

Only a few years ago, a qualifying speed of 212 m.p.h. won the pole; now such a speed will not make the field.

GUESSING GAMES
LEAD: Someone once asked Harry Waugh, the grand old man of the English wine trade, how long it had been since he'd mistaken a Bordeaux wine for a Burgundy. ''How long is it since lunch?'' he replied.
No single part of wine lore is more beset by myth and misinformation than the vague area of wine tasting.


The Same Old Response, But Not the Same Old China
LEAD: IT was as if the clock in China had been set back decades, to the politics of intrigue and purge.
Suddenly, instead of the exuberance of people power in the streets of Beijing, instead of throngs of joyful students marching for democracy, the focus shifted last week to a secret power struggle at the top of the Communist


LIFE STYLE: Sunday Brunch; Food That's Memorable Amid Nostalgic Decor
LEAD: This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in the Connecticut, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester Sunday regional sections of The New York Times.

A Gotti Is Convicted
LEAD: Gene Gotti, the 42-year-old brother of John Gotti, was convicted of running a multimillion-dollar heroin ring, but it wasn't easy.
The case began in 1983, resulted in two mistrials and became one of the oldest unresolved matters on the Federal docket.
A third mistrial was narrowly averted in Brooklyn when one of the 12 jurors whose identities were supposedly secret said that two men had threatened him in his driveway.


COMIC-BOOK COLLECTORS
LEAD: Mr.
Queenan is an editor at Forbes, a magazine that extolls the pursuit of empty materialism and the virtues of greed, featuring such stalwarts as Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken.
In comparison, a little straightforward violence in the battle against crime is a downright relief.
I'd rather my child's heroes be characters with a sense of honor and a willingness to take responsibilty for the consequences of their actions, like Wolverine and Batman, than Oliver (Just Following Orders) North or Jimmy (God Forgave Me, Why Can't You?) Swaggart.


March Moore Weds Broker
LEAD: At All Saints' Episcopal Church in Chevy Chase, Md., March Victoria Moore, a daughter of Guy Will Moore of Arlington, Va., and the late Hazel Cartwright Moore, was married yesterday to Christopher Lockwood Dodge.

Long Island Journal

The four-wheel-drive modified class A final was about to begin. ''Drivers to the track,'' shouted the track director, Bob Constantino of Coram.


Correction
LEAD: An article last week on the bicycle business incorrectly identified the first American winner of the Tour de France.
He is Greg LeMond, who won the race in 1986.


Shaping Jazz With Three Sets a Night
LEAD: If New York jazz has a local habitation and a name, it is the Village Vanguard.
The 54-year-old, 123-person-capacity club is a basement in Greenwich Village, a rounded-off triangle (like a pie slice) where Seventh Avenue South meets Waverly Place.


Suffolk's Big Plan to Preserve Pine Barrens Is Yielding Small Results
LEAD: In 1987 and again last year, Suffolk County residents agreed to a quarter-cent increase in their sales tax so that the county could buy thousands of acres of Long Island's most ecologically sensitive land, the Pine Barrens.


Yonkers Council Candidates: New Faces, Familiar Stands
LEAD: THE Yonkers City Council, where a continuing dispute over a court-ordered housing-desegregation plan has dominated the agenda in recent years, may look a lot different after this November's elections.
But the legislative results could remain the same.
All six district seats are being contested, as is the mayoralty, the Council's seventh vote.


Review/Music; A Program Built on 'Seasons of Life'
LEAD: When a director takes up the challenge of building a cohesive program around a broad theme - as Clara Longstreth did with the New Amsterdam Singers program she conducted Wednesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall - we are reminded that programming can be an art.


PERSPECTIVES: The Sunnyside Yards; Amtrak's Grand Vision for Its Air Rights
LEAD: NOW it's Amtrak's turn at trying to make use of the huge development opportunity at the Sunnyside railyards in Long Island City, Queens.
The national passenger railroad has taken on a development manager and started planning that could open 150 acres of land there for large-scale commercial and residential development over the next decade and beyond.


A Salute To Forgotten Soldiers
LEAD: FROM the southern coastal plain to the rocky fastnesses of the Northeast, the old gravestones dot New Jersey's African-American cemeteries.
They have a characteristic silhouette, and when you get used to it you can readily pick them out.
Occasionally you'll see a Grand Army of the Republic stanchion stuck in the ground alongside, and there are always the flowers on Memorial Day.


Seeking a Formula For Liberty and Order in the Park
LEAD: EACH year, three million people make fourteen million visits to Central Park.
On a beautiful summer day, there might be 250,000 people in its 843 acres.


Despite Distraction, Cubs Come Up With Victory
LEAD: Rick Sutcliffe was paying as much attention to the Bulls as he was to the Reds.


A Family's Spreading Pool Of Resemblance
LEAD: EVERYONE is gone now.
When I return ''home'' to New Hampshire, as I drive up Interstate 91, I find myself holding imaginery conversations with my aunt or mother, pointing out something they would enjoy - a frisking colt or rosy sunset.
I hear the genial timbre of my father's voice saying, ''Oh, Sure!


Modular Housing Gaining Acceptance
LEAD: AFTER more than two decades of trying to obliterate their house-trailer heritage, manufacturers of modular houses are finally persuading skeptics to buy housing off the assembly line.

LEAD: Spain will compete in the 1992 America's Cup with a Spanish-designed vessel, the president of a group in charge of organizing the country's effort said today.


For Steve Reich, War and Rediscovery
LEAD: Composers, or their publicists, are always talking about breakthroughs.
No sooner is a new work introduced than it is touted as an unprecedented advance, a break with the past.
Perhaps this obsession with forging ahead is a legacy of modernism that lingers in our post-modern era.


Sharing a View From Leonard's World
LEAD: In response to Margaret J. Peterson's account of her brother Leonard, ''My Brother's Unknowable World'' (Opinion page, April 23), I would like to share a view from Leonard's environment.
As staff members who dedicate our lives to the care of special people, we do not question God's wisdom, but rather we've come to realize there are many roads to salvation - not all of which are smoothly paved.


IN QUOTES
LEAD: ''It's a question of dignity.
We will not be treated like children sent to bed without dinner for not following their parents' wishes.''
A senior Japanese diplomat reacting to the American trade move.


For Some Players, 'Life Begins at 40' Has Many Side Effects
LEAD: Rick Reuschel is 40 years old, but he has an 8-2 record and a sizzling 2.06 earned run average so it's clear he is not finished as a major league pitcher.
Nolan Ryan, even though he is 42, is not ready for forced retirement either; he has a 5-2 record and 79 strikeouts in 65Y innings.


A First-Year Look At County Center
LEAD: IT is just a little more than a year since the County Center officially reopened.
And the word from many Westchester officials is that the $16.2 million face-lifting taxpayers agreed to four and a half years ago has been well worth the cost despite the problems.


Reviews/Dance; Additional Segments Of Kei Takei's 'Light'
LEAD: Kei Takei has done it again.
On Tuesday night at the La Mama Annex the Japanese minimalist deposited a group of performers in another of her barren landscapes and provided them with another of her stark and mystic rituals.
Once again she bored at least one viewer nearly to death.
And once again she has created a theater-dance piece of undeniable and unforgettable power, this time in ''The Last Rice Field,'' a new work that is Part 27 of her 20-year ''Light'' series.


DALEY CONFOUNDS CRITICS IN CHICAGO
LEAD: When Richard M. Daley was elected Mayor here six weeks ago, his critics did not quite predict that a small clique of old-fashioned machine politicians would take over City Hall, then build a moat around it filled with alligators to feast on liberals and government reformers.
But that was the impression they left.


POSTINGS: Upscale Downtown; Condos in a Stable
LEAD: A century ago the New York architectural firm of D. &amp; J. Jardine designed a decorous upscale stable for horses at 125 East 12th Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, even incorporating representations of horses' bits into the six terra cotta capitals on the front of the building.
And now in another of the bizarre transmogrifications that ginger the New York real estate market, workmen are converting the East

LEAD: WESTCHESTER is on the verge of a ''true recycling adventure,'' County Executive Andrew P.O'Rourke said Monday as he announced plans for a sophisticated plant to separate and process recyled goods into marketable materials.


The West May Not Be the World, but It's Ours
LEAD: It would appear that we now have a brand-new, shiny, politico-cultural Hula Hoop with which to do our academic-artistic gyrations: anti-Eurocentrism.


QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Next Week; Should Contracts Be Honored Or Ignored?
LEAD: The Times welcomes letters from readers.
Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
Letters should be addressed to The Editor, Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


Burma
LEAD: To the Editor: I disagree with the advice given by Steven Erlanger.
He writes, ''The children behave as if they haven't seen candy since martial law, so bring or buy lots of it.
Kids of a more discerning age will prefer pens.'' This advice, if followed, will certainly promote the image of the ''ugly American'' abroad.


Linda Silberman, Professor, Is Wed
LEAD: The wedding of Prof.
Linda Silberman and Dr.
Victor Goldberg took place last evening at D'Agostino Hall at the New York University School of Law.
Judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob of Manhattan Civil Court officiated.


CRIME
LEAD: With certain nations owing certain other nations $100 billion or so, what can you say about a guy who's into another guy for a couple of ''bones'' ($2,000), plus a weekly ''vigorish'' (interest) of two ''smalls'' ($200)?
Robert Campbell has a mouthful to say about a chump like that, and in JUICE (Poseidon, $18.95) he says it with grand panache, in the colorful patois of Hollywood ''gamooshes'' and ''juicemen.


Burma
LEAD: To the Editor: Steven Erlanger glossed over the truly splendid and unusual things to see in Burma.
I found it totally refreshing to be one of only 50 to 75 tourists in the whole country.
While Burma isn't geared for tourists yet, it was wonderful to visit the various sites and not be inundated with gawking tourists and hordes of tour buses.


PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: There is no greater opportunity for the aspiring young grandmaster than to be taken on as second to a principal of world championship caliber, but there is also the hazard of becoming awestruck.

Review/Dance; Bill by Balanchine, Robbins and Feld
LEAD: The New York City Ballet, now rightly considered the repository of George Balanchine's ballets, presented what could be called a disparate program on Friday night.
Those who recall the company's more eclectic first two decades would not have found it that unusual.


Open Mind Wins the Acorn
LEAD: Open Mind beat ten 3-year-old fillies so impressively in the $186,600 Acorn Stakes yesterday at Belmont Park that her handlers are now thinking about running her against colts in the Belmont Stakes June 10.


All That Smithsonian Jazz, Now on Five Compact Disks
LEAD: The Smithsonian Institution's massive best-selling ''Collection of Classic Jazz,'' first issued in 1973, became what The Times's jazz critic John S. Wilson called an ''instant classic.''

CAMPUS LIFE: Alabama; The Untimely Demise Of Half a Million Mice Stymies Researchers
LEAD: It's midnight in the world of medical research. Do you know where your mice are?


Louisville
LEAD: To the Editor: I would like to note an inaccuracy in ''What's Doing in Louisville'' (Travel, April 9).
The J. B. Speed Art Museum, while enjoying a close relationship with the University of Louisville, is not ''the University of Louisville's . . .
Museum,'' but a private institution, Kentucky's oldest and largest art museum, which has served this area of the county independently as an art museum for more than 60 years.

THE WORLD: A Voice From Warsaw; A 2-to-1 Shot at Freedom Isn't So Bad
LEAD: LAST night in my garden, something like a memorial mound sprang up.
Under the earth are hidden lost hopes, among them the remains of a calf bought cheap from a farmer.
Why cheap?
Because the farmer was upset by the price of the dollar, the only real currency in the country, constantly jumping up, and the stories of so-called economic reforms that would only make his life worse.


Reviews/Music; Bostonians in Orpheus Permutations
LEAD: Last season, Joel Cohen brought his Boston Camerata to Manhattan for an interesting, slightly quirky production of Monteverdi's ''Orfeo.'' Since then, Mr.

Others have unusual silhouettes.

Cruise LInes Are Riding a High Tide

Burma

PASTIMES: Camera
LEAD: The news that Modern Photography magazine has come to the end of the road was no less depressing for being predictable.
Not long after Capital Cities-ABC sold the magazine to Diamandis Communications, Diamandis announced that it was shutting it down, as of the July issue.
Diamandis owns Popular Photography, Modern


WRITE TILL YOU DROP
LEAD: People love pretty much the same things best.
A writer looking for subjects inquires not after what he loves best, but after what he alone loves at all.
Strange seizures beset us.
Frank Conroy loves his yo-yo tricks, Emily Dickinson her slant of light; Richard Selzer loves the glistening peritoneum, Faulkner the muddy bottom of a little girl's drawers visible when she's up a pear tree.


Bush Speaks of Allied Troop Reductions
LEAD: President Bush told Italian leaders today that recent Soviet proposals to reduce conventional arms in Europe had opened the way for cuts in allied forces, including those of the United States.


Reviews/Theater; Lerner-Loewe 'Gigi' on Smaller Scale
LEAD: Any musical that depends as much upon evoking a high-style period ambiance as Lerner and Loewe's ''Gigi'' is bound to be compromised by a production that fails to offer at least a modicum of opulence.
In the Equity Library Theater's cheery but threadbare revival, the few props chosen to suggest turn-of-the-century Parisian grandeur look like moth-eaten relics from a second-hand shop.


Cruise Ships Still Plying Gulf of Alaska
LEAD: LATE spring through summer is the season for cruises to Alaska, which in recent years have experienced a decided upsurge in popularity.

Reviews/Dance; Swiss Institute Bill Belies Stereotypes
LEAD: The program of dance presented by the Swiss Institute on Thursday night would have surprised anyone who thinks of the Swiss as a relatively sedate lot.

Is Life in Made-for-TV Films Worth Living?
LEAD: Consider the land of the made-for-TV movie.
You probably know it's there, but you haven't been paying that much attention to it.
Made-for-TV movies don't hang around like ''theatrical'' movies.
Even a really horrible theatrical movie will be advertised for a couple of weeks or so and is more noticeable than ''Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure'' on ABC last Sunday or ''Out on the Edge'' (CBS, May 14).

Duality of Existence in Latin Works
LEAD: THE show entitled ''Latin Roots/American Visions'' is a small one - 32 paintings, drawings and photographs by nine artists - and its catalogue is modest.
Yet, in word and image, this production, at the New Jersey Center for Visual Arts here, does as much as any large survey to enlighten its beholders about the Latin contribution to contemporary


Voters to Decide Fate of Nuclear Plant
LEAD: At the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Plant here, where cows graze in the shadow of the twin cooling towers, contingency plans are being made to turn off the plant, move the fuel into storage, lay off hundreds of workers and buy power from alternative sources.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Not Imperial, but Still Faberge
LEAD: Everything seems royal about the diamond-encrusted ''Pine Cone'' Easter egg that the Russian jeweler Peter Carl Faberge made in 1900.
Everything, that is, except its pedigree.
This exquisite bauble is royal blue, an enameled triumph.
When it was auctioned on May 10 by Christie's in Geneva, it fetched the princely sum of $3 million.

SPA LIFE
LEAD: I eagerly read Linda Wells's article ''Spa Life'' (May 7), hoping to find some spas in the United States like the ones I enjoyed so much during the three years I lived in Hungary.

These resorts may be pleasant places to spend some time; however, they are not built around mineral springs, as are European spas.

Cordoba's Hymn to Islam
LEAD: HE was standing in the courtyard of the Great Mosque of Cordoba in southern Spain when I saw him, gargling water from the ritual fountain there.

'Angels' Find Heaven in the Canadian Bush
LEAD: There's no chance that the actors Robert De Niro and Sean Penn, the writer David Mamet and the producer Art Linson would ever claim to be angelic characters.
So they think it's a bit of a joke that they were all involved in a film called ''We're No Angels,'' which was very definitely not a remake of the 1955 movie of the same name.


HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA
LEAD: Orville Schell's trenchant article ''Human Rights in China: An Act of Defiance'' (April 16), about the surrealistic odyssey of Fang Lizhi in Beijing is important.

LEAD: Among all the arts exported from the Soviet Union since the 1950's, architecture has been conspicuous by its absence.
The reason is simple.

THE CASE AGAINST LAWNS

Findings Plunge Archeology of the Americas Into Turmoil Estimates of first Asian migration are 33,000 years apart. By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   ORONO, Me. FROM the tundra of the Yukon to Brazil and southern Chile, archeologists are digging up tantalizing clues that threaten conventional views about the peopling of the Americas. The mounting evidence, if confirmed, could establish that the first migrants from Asia reached the American continent as early as 45,000 years ago, about 33,000 years earlier than commonly believed.   One scholar described the discoveries, which also have been interpreted to suggest that the early Americans may have arrived in many waves of separate migration, as forcing American archeology to a ''critical turning point.''   The disputed claims and conflicting interpretations have stirred up a tempest in American archeology. Skeptics argue that nothing has yet been produced to prove human habitation took place in America before the accepted date of 12,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age. Some of those who have discovered the new evidence protest that their work is being unduly criticized and some of their research impeded because it runs against prevailing theory. Signs of Tookmaking    For more than half a century, the earliest date for human occupation in the Americas that archeologists accepted as indisputable was about 11,500 years ago, based on the dating of stone projectile points found throughout South and North America since the 1920's. Archeologists assume that the people who made the points were on the continent at least several hundred years earlier.   But discoveries over the last decade in the Bluefish Caves along the Old Crow River of Canada's Yukon reveal fractured and flaked bones of mammoths, seeming to tell of human butchering and toolmaking 24,000 years ago. Many scientists are also impressed with other sites, in Pennsylvania and in the western United States, where stone tools and other artifacts suggest human presence much earlier than usually believed.   Excavations in South America are producing results even more at odds with traditional thinking. At Monte Verde in Chile, archeologists have found clay-lined hearths, stone tools, bone implements and traces of the foundations for wooden shelters. The artifacts are 13,000 years old, their discoverers maintain, and deeper deposits yield possible human material dated at 33,000 years.   More astonishing, and controversial, are the findings in rock shelters of northeastern Brazil, where French and Brazilian archeologists have discovered elaborate rock paintings as well as human fireplaces, tools and butchered animal bones. Three years ago they reported that they had dated the paintings at more than 12,000 years old and the other artifacts at 32,000 years old. 'Profound Changes' Foreseen    At a conference here this week at the University of Maine, Niede Guidon, an archeologist at the Institute of Advanced Social Science Studies in Paris, startled scientists by reporting new results that she said showed the Brazilian rock shelters were occupied by humans at least as long ago as 45,000 years. The ''quantity, diversity and preservation'' of materials at the sites, she said, should lead to ''profound changes in the knowledge of prehistorical America.''   Reactions at the four-day meeting reflected the scholarly turmoil over the first Americans: who were they, and when did they arrive?   No one is seriously questioning that they came from Siberia across the Bering Straits, when Asia and America were connected there by a land bridge. It is generally assumed that early people could not have reached America across the oceans and that clear evidence of early people in North America was probably lost during glaciation. But the new evidence is winning converts.   ''Frankly, the sites in South America are driving us to a critical turning point in American archeology,'' said Alan L. Bryan, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, who has found evidence at the Brazilian site persuasive. Limit Termed 'Untenable'    The dating of the first signs of human habitation at 11,500 years is based on stone projectile points, carefully flaked on both sides to form sharp edges and used either as darts or spearheads. They were found in the 1920's near the towns of Folsom and Clovis in New Mexico.   Similar points were soon identified at sites throughout North America, and other stone weapons were discovered as far south as Patagonia. The Clovis people thus came to be thought of as the paleoindians, ancestors of the people encountered by Columbus. 'There Is No Consensus'    A number of influential archeologists are resisting the growing challenge to the Clovis people's primacy. They caution that the sites yielding earlier dates must be examined more carefully to be accepted as genuine pre-Clovis encampments. One particular concern, they say, is the problem of being able to determine if the stone and bone objects, crude by Clovis standards, are actually the work of humans and not the result of natural erosion in streams or landslides.   One of the skeptics, Thomas F. Lynch, a specialist in South American archeology at Cornell University, said: ''I'm still unconvinced. A lot of weak cases don't add up to a strong case.''   David J. Meltzer, an archeologist at Southern Methodist University, summed up the dispute. ''Some say the evidence for earlier Americans is out there plain to see, and the skeptics are blinded by their theories,'' he said. ''One thing we can say, there is no consensus.''   Dr. Guidon is frustrated by the lack of acceptance of her results from the Brazilian rock shelter, known as Pedra Furada. In an interview, she said: ''Why is American archeology so conservative and rigid? Nobody questions dates since 12,000. Why are only the earlier dates considered suspect and bad? It's emotional.'' Harm to Research Seen    The issue of possibly unscientific behavior has indeed been raised. After talking to investigators at some of the disputed sites, Robson Bonnichsen, director of the University of Maine's Center for the Study of the First Americans, said the climate of controversy was ''adversely affecting'' their research.   ''Numerous meritorious grant proposals have been rejected because their goals and objectives were incompatible with entrenched academic opinion,'' he said. ''At least five South American archeologists admitted that they are suppressing pre-12,000-year-old data out of fear that their funds would be cut off by American colleagues who endorse the short-chronology school of thought.'' 'Mind-Boggling' Findings    Like many archeologists who have visited Pedra Furada, Dr. Bonnichsen said Dr. Guidon's findings were ''mind-boggling'' but may turn out to be correct and certainly deserve a respectful hearing. Dr. Guidon complained that her severest skeptics had yet to visit the site.   One of the leading skeptics, Vance Haynes of the University of Arizona in Tucson, said he had not altered his views but declined to make any further comment. In a letter to Dr. Meltzer a few years ago concerning the Monte Verde site, Dr. Haynes proposed that a ''panel of objective conservatives'' could help resolve such disputes by collecting their own samples at the sites for study. ''If a positive consensus results,'' Dr. Haynes wrote, ''we can then accept the interpretation and formulate new hypotheses for peopling the New World.'' Authenticating a Discovery    The task of authenticating an archeological discovery usually begins with geology. The sediments containing the artifacts must be examined to make sure the layers have not been disturbed by stream erosion or other forces and that the bones or tools belong in the sediments.   Another step is to demonstrate beyond doubt that the materials are related to human activity. It was clear that the Folsom and Clovis points were made by human hunters. But other objects identified as scrapers and choppers can be so crude that they could just as easily have been worn or broken by natural forces. Such is the case, some archeologists say, with artifacts at Pedra Furada.   Next, archeologists want to establish a pattern of the artifacts and other aspects of the site. Is it clear what people were doing there? A fair sprinkling of rock or bone flakes would indicate they were making tools and weapons. Animal bones broken in a certain way might indicate a hunting camp.   Finding charcoal in the deposits is critical because it could mean people were cooking and, moreover, it is a key to establishing a date. Wood or bone, anything that once lived, is essential in radiocarbon dating, which measures the time since the material was burned or killed. Widespread Occupation Found    Dr. Guidon, responding to possible objections, said the charcoal at Pedra Furada was concentrated in stone hearths and so was not likely to have come from a forest fire. Also, she said, the rock shelter is high on a cliff, far from trees.   Pedra Furada is situated in an arid wilderness in the Brazilian state of Piaui. Carbon dating and geological analysis, Dr. Guidon said, indicated that the rock shelter was occupied by successive groups of people from as long as 45,000 years to 5,000 years ago. Test digging elsewhere in the valley indicated that human occupation was widespread.   Since the skeptics doubt the evidence of the stone artifacts at Pedra Furada, they have yet to judge the claims under the other criterea.   The rock paintings, which first drew archeologists to the site, were made with red ochre and, Dr. Guidon said, are ''a joyful and free art.'' Some fragments of paint have been found in deposits as old as 17,000 years, which would make the artists contemporaries of the Cro-Magnon people who decorated the caves of France and Spain. Paintings of People    Anne-Marie Pessis, a member of the French-Brazilian team, said the most abundant and most legible paintings were made 12,000 years ago. In contrast to the Cro-Magnon animal and hunting scenes, she said, most Pedra Furada art depicts people in everyday activities. Later, however, the art depicts violent scenes.   If the findings at Pedra Furada and Monte Verde in Chile are confirmed, Dr. Meltzer said, it does not necessarily mean that the earliest people at such sites were the ancestors of today's native Americans. They could have been part of early waves of migration from Asia that eventually failed. Later migrations might have been more successful and out of this ''melting pot'' of people emerged the Clovis people, he said.   A serious gap in the evidence for such an argument, archeologists said, is the absence of established relics from the route of migration closer to the Bering land bridge. Richard E. Morlan of the Archeological Survey of Canada said that, though the bone fragments from Bluefish Caves in the Yukon were dated at 24,000 to 40,000 years old, it was only ''a working hypothesis'' that they were broken by human hunters. If they were, it would be the earliest evidence for human presence in the region.   Tom D. Dillehay, an archeologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, who discovered the Monte Verde site, said, ''Logic has always told me something had to be here before Clovis.''
