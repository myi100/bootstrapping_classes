CASTLES IN THE SAND
Elizabeth Hawes's article "Castles in the Sand" (July 11) brings deserved attention to Fire Island's severe problems, stemming from last winter's storms.
I take exception, however, to the implication that all politicians have been slow to grasp the importance of maintaining the integrity of Long Island's barrier island system.
I joined Federal Emergency Management Agency officials on tours of Fire Island numerous times last winter to review the storm damage and discuss potential solutions to shore up the island.
I worked with the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the permits required to deposit sand on the severely eroded beaches in Robert Moses State Park.


Don't Worry but Be Wary: A Fine Line in Water Scare
Detecting bacteria in water samples is so easy that technicians do not even use a microscope to do it.
Knowing how to react is harder.
In the past week, city officials have walked a very fine line, telling tens of thousands of people in Lower Manhattan in the heat of summer that yes, there are bacteria in the water and you should be prudent and boil before drinking, but no, there is nothing basically wrong and the problem is just an inconvenience, not a danger.


Tribes Recognized in State
ACCORDING to 1990 United States Census reports, there are about 15,000 American Indians now living in New Jersey, said Sen-Yuan Wu, a research economist with the State Department of Labor.
Mr.
Wu said the census was self-reporting, meaning that if someone said he was an Indian and there was no obvious conflicting information to indicate otherwise, the census would report that person as an Indian.
"Basically, they take your word for it," Mr.
Wu said.


Remains of the Race: Horton Ponders Crash
Jimmy Horton took his stock car and left the track early last Sunday during the DieHard 500 at Talladega (Ala.) SuperSpeedway.
The only problem was, at the point where he exited -- midway through Turn 1 -- there's no tunnel.
But that didn't stop Horton, a 37-year-old driver from Somerville, N.J.
Neither did the retaining wall at the top of the high-banked turn.
And by the time the remains of Horton's 3,500-pound race car reached the bottom of the 30-foot-high embankment on the opposite face of the turn, a chain-link fence wasn't much opposition, either.


Mutual Funds; Readers' Mail: Unlisted Funds
Question: How can I track the performance of mutual funds that are not listed by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system?
Answer: To qualify for a listing with Nasdaq, which provides fund data for most newspapers and magazines, a fund generally must have either $25 million in assets or 1,000 or more shareholders.
Today about 3,100 funds are Nasdaq-listed and 217 are not, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago.


Martha DeJong and James Volcker
Martha Anneke DeJong, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Bastiaan C. DeJong of Chatham, Mass., was married there yesterday to James Paul Volcker, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Paul Volcker of New York.
The Rev.
Charles Amstein, a Presbyterian minister, officiated at the First Congregational Church.
Mrs.
Volcker graduated from Wheaton College and is a candidate for an M.B.A. at Emory University.
Her father, now retired, was a vice president of Anglo Nordic Shipping Ltd., a former shipping company in New York.


It's Woodstock On the Danube
"Student Island," an international festival intended to recapture something of the spirit of Woodstock, will take place in Budapest from Aug.  19 to 26.
For a week spanning the country's national holiday, St.
Stephen's Day, the festival, on the one-and-a-half-mile long Hajogyari Island in the middle of the Danube, will include stage, film and more than 200 musical performances, primarily by Hungarian and other Eastern European classical and rock musicians, as well as sports and other activities.
Campers will be invited to help develop a new language, made up of words they think are easily understandable the world over.


Double Talk
I COVERED THE White House for a while under Reagan and Bush.
And now I cover Ovitz and Katzenberg.
It hasn't been an especially difficult transition.
Each town hungers for the worst parts of the other.
Hollywood's executives and movie stars, embarrassed about their frivolousness and lack of education, crave Washington's exaggerated seriousness, its aura of power, even its pretension and pomposity.


Fishing Countries Split on Harvest
Rival fishing nations grimly acknowledged this week that their fleets have thinned out stocks of the world's edible marine fish to levels unimaginable only a few years ago, and that only coordinated conservation and management steps will restore them.
But at the conclusion of three weeks of talks here, a core negotiating group of 70 governments remained far apart on the central problem: how to reconcile the time-honored freedom to harvest the sea with the biological consequences of overfishing.
It is a notion that went largely unnoticed until catch rates worldwide began declining sharply about four years ago.

A New Diplomacy of Lost Causes
WATCHING the Clinton Administration as it grappled with Bosnia and the fighting in Lebanon last week, it was hard to escape the impression that a new form of American statesmanship had been created: the diplomacy of lost causes.
This is a diplomatic art that they don't teach at the Foreign Service Academy.
It's strictly on-the-job training.
It requires a real skill at averting one's gaze from gruesome news footage; it requires a special knack for using body language to tell people in hopeless situations to surrender to reality, when words would be too brutal; and it requires perfecting that mournful gaze that says to inquiring reporters and historians: "I recommended doing more but the (fill in the blank: Pentagon, President, Congress, allies, public opinion) wouldn't let me."


BIG GIRLS, DON'T CRY
Hal Rubenstein's feature "Big Girls, Don't Cry" (Fashion, July 11) was a good start -- but only a start -- in recognizing that all women are not rail thin and size 4.
Regrettably, the models shown were only slightly more ample than usual, and the captions did not include information on available sizes.
No room for double digits, perhaps?

Major's Tories Face a Deepening Political Rut
After 14 years in power, Britain's Conservative Party has driven into a deep political rut, and analysts said this week that Prime Minister John Major faced a substantial challenge in trying to put the Government and his own fortunes back on track.
On Thursday the party suffered a stinging defeat in a race for a vacant seat in Parliament, losing by a 2-to-1 ratio in a district it had held for 83 years.


Correction
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the Town of Monroe, N.Y., referred incorrectly to Middletown, N.Y., the site of a nearby shopping mall.
It is in Orange County, not Ulster County.

Correction
Because of an editing error, an article on July 18 about David Black, artist and former Broadway producer, misidentified the galleries in Kent where his paintings were exhibited.
Peoplescapes was at the Hugh A. Hill Gallery; landscapes were at the Tiglieto Gallery.
There is no David Black Gallery.

Sagamore Hill
To the Editor: The information on the reopening of Sagamore Hill, Theodore Roosevelt's home in Oyster Bay, L.I. (Travel Advisory, July 4) should have noted the very limited ability of the guides at the house to escort groups through the narrow halls and small rooms.
We arrived at 2 P.M.
July 5.
The ranger was very apologetic, but said that no more could be accommodated that day.
JOHN G. CAROLIN  Greenwich, Conn.
Vidal Martinez, superintendent of Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, replies: I regret that the visitors were inconvenienced.
We received an unusually large turnout in response to the reopening.
On reopening we added ranger-led tours, which slows access but protects the interior and makes visits more meaningful.
Because of the number of visitors, we have cut tours from 45 minutes to 30 minutes.
We advise arriving early in the day, especially on weekends or holidays.
A recording with information on tours is now available on (516) 922-4447.

Florio's on a Bill-Signing Blitz; Whitman's Off to a Quiet Start
IN June, New Jersey voters picked the two major party candidates for governor and then turned their thoughts to vacations, air-conditioners and the resurgence of the Yankees.
That left Gov.
Jim Florio, the incumbent Democrat, and Christine Todd Whitman, his Republican opponent, the task of keeping themselves in the public eye and expanding their base of supporters -- all without spending too much of the money they will need for their television campaigns after Labor Day.


Profile/Arati Prabhakar; She's Not Just Setting Standards
ON her way to becoming the first woman to win a Ph.D. in applied physics at the California Institute of Technology, Arati Prabhakar realized what she did not want to do: immerse herself in narrowly focused research.
"If the worst thing you learn in graduate school is what you don't want to do, that is not all bad," she said.
Instead she and her thesis adviser decided she should apply her learning to public policy.
"We had this problem of deciding what to do about me," she said.
"Finally he suggested that I should become a Congressional intern, even though neither of us was quite sure what a Congressional intern did."


Katherine Field, Andrew Ellenthal

Thai Airline Bans Use of Laptops
One of Asia's largest airlines, Thai International, has imposed strict new safety rules that forbid the use of laptop computers and compact-disk players at all times on all flights.
The rules, intended to prevent electronic interference with navigational equipment on the flight deck, go beyond anything imposed by Thai's major regional competitors or by large American carriers.


Fear and Fascination Of Snakes
Pete Dunne's article dealing with snakes took me back to my boyhood.
In my very early teens we lived just south of Bay Avenue in Bloomfield.
At that time the area north of Bay Avenue, except for a few homes, was a forest.
The place is full of houses now, but the woods were a great attraction to the neighborhood boys, and we shared that with enthusiasm because of the brook that ran through the woods.
The stream had carp, and a rare trout or two.
But along its banks could be found snakes.


The Fight Over National Standards
When former President George Bush pushed for national student standards in math, science, history and other academic subjects and new ways to assess student progress in meeting those standards, there was a ground swell of support.
When President Bill Clinton proposed Federal legislation in April to create councils to oversee the work on standards and assessments, many more applauded.
After all, who could argue against setting standards for students that specifically outline what they should know in each subject area at each grade level?
And who could oppose exams that better measure student progress toward those standards, abandoning the old multiple-choice tests that research shows are biased against girls and minorities and substituting new assessments that require students to do more writing and demonstrate an ability to think?


Corrections
A map on May 23 showing former gravesites in New York City depicted the status of the Riker family graveyard in Queens incorrectly.
It still exists.
The map also misidentified locations for some old graveyards on Staten Island.
A corrected version appears today on page 42.
A Staten Island group telephoned The Times on May 24 about errors, and a Riker family spokesman wrote on June 2; this correction was delayed for further research about the Staten Island sites.


Bosnian Leaders Split on the Pact for Ethnic Partition
Bosnia's political and military leaders remain divided over a peace agreement reached on Friday that would split the country into a loose federation of three ethnic republics, a member of the collective presidency said today.
"The text was not signed," Miro Lazovic, the speaker of the Bosnian Parliament and member of the presidency, said of the plan.
"We only accepted it as a basis for further talks."

Derzaw, 35, graduated from New York University.
She is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Jerome Weinstock of Forest Hills, Queens.
Her father is a manufacturers' representative of fashion accessories in New York.


Fire and Spice
Grilled food is the bass note of Summer dining.
The smoky flavor and crusted texture of grilled meat, chicken or fish can be counted on to recur at regular hot-weather intervals.
Side dishes provide contrast, nothing more, nothing less.
But it takes the serendipitous jolt of condiments, in a savory rub, to give grilled food the surprising pow that wakes up summer eating.
Rather than add a superficial shellac, these herb mashes and seasoned salts permeate deep into food, creating contrasting layers of flavor.
But condiments are sneaky.
They leave no mark, while managing to alter everything.
Once applied, they insinuate themselves, changing, not only the flavor of chicken and fish, but their own taste as well.


The Holocaust and Its Deniers
To the Editor:
Walter Reich's July 11 review of two books about attempts to deny the Holocaust -- Deborah E. Lipstadt's "Denying the Holocaust" and Pierre Vidal-Naquet's "Assassins of Memory" -- made for difficult reading for anyone sensitive to the Holocaust, whether Jewish or not.
The Big Lie lives; the deniers give Hitler and his techniques new life.


Lisa Cunningham, David J. Arcara
Lisa Anne Cunningham, a television and video producer, was married yesterday to David James Arcara, the owner and president of DJA Media, a broadcasting company in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
The Rev.
Richard Erhart officiated at the Unitarian Church of All Souls in New York.
Mrs.
Cunningham Arcara graduated from New York University.
She is the daughter of Nita C. Kaplan of San Antonio and the late John F. Cunningham Jr.
Her mother and her stepfather, Jonathan L. Kaplan, own and operate Kaplan Real Estate and Development Inc., which restores and sells historic properties in San Antonio.


The Holocaust and Its Deniers
To the Editor:
Why doubt the Holocaust?
For the same reason I doubt most history espoused by white Western males -- the profit motive.
And no one can deny the enormous economic benefits the Zionists have reaped from this tale.
Over $100 billion from the United States (per capita annual benefits make Israel the most generously gifted American state) and many billions more from Germany and others.


Reagan Curse on Clinton
It isn't all Bill Clinton's fault. Not by a long way.
The President's protracted, messy effort to push his economic program through Congress, still hung up short of success this weekend, is taken in some Washington circles and by many rank-and-file voters as evidence of ineptitude if not incompetence.
There is no doubt that the White House has made its share of mistakes in this campaign, on which the very definition of the Clinton Administration may turn.


Bermuda Bowls May Become Rarer
NEWS from the World Bridge Federation indicates that the Bermuda Bowl contest for the world championship, with teams qualifying in zonal events, is, like the Cheshire Cat, fading away.
When the contest began in the 1950's, it was annual.
In the 60's it was played three times in each four-year cycle, and this was then cut to twice, always in odd-numbered years.
Now it will be cut again, to once in each cycle, and the Venice Cup for Women's Teams will suffer the same fate, if proposals by the federation's management committee are put into effect.
The reason is financial.
Bermuda-Venice contests are expensive to stage and are a burden on the small countries that normally act as hosts, while the alternative, a world pairs and teams championship open virtually to all comers, is profitable.


American Menu With Intriguing Twists
WHEN Randy Nichols, the chef at the West Street Grill in Litchfield, left to start his own restaurant some months ago, it was big news in the area -- such is the fame of the Litchfield establishment.
Now that the new place has opened, visitors may be in for a surprise.
On his own premises Mr.
Nichols has opted for something different.
Harvest Roasterie -- no clone of anything nor trying to be smart and fashionable -- is in a former roadhouse on the outskirts of non-trendy Torrington.
The owner's stated intention is to serve generous portions of good food at reasonable prices.
The goal is modest and, in our experience, already has been achieved.


Lesson on Henley
To the Sports Editor:
Why should reporters and newspapers in general prate on sex and race in their writing?
In her feature on the Henley Royal Regatta in England ("Always an England," Styles of The Times, July 4), Maureen Dowd refers to the Henley stewards as an "ultra-exclusive club of white men who run the regatta."


THE TWISTED LEGACY OF IRAN-CONTRA
I congratulate Philip Weiss for reminding readers that "hatchet jobs" are not a thing of the past ("Oliver North's Next War," July 4).


POSTINGS: No G.M. Lease Renewal in '95; Fifth Ave. Showroom to Close
For a quarter century, the first floor of the General Motors Building at 767 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, at the southeast corner of Central Park, has been one of the world's most stylish automobile showrooms.
By January 1995, however, the venue will go the way of G.M's old Corvair model, as the company has decided not to renew its lease on the 9,000-square-foot space.


At Work; Interpreting the Family Leave Act
FEW people are wildly ecstatic about the version of the Family and Medical Leave Act that will go into effect on Thursday.
Many businesses would like no version of the measure, which requires them to grant employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year for family medical emergencies, arguing they already shoulder more than their share of expensive Washington-imposed social policy.
Employee advocates wanted a stronger version, along the European model of extended paid leave, pointing out that few workers can afford to forgo a paycheck for three months.
Yet both sides will acknowledge what several surveys on leave benefits show: that the new law, if less generous than some state laws, is nevertheless in line with policies already in place at many companies, and thus is not likely to provoke a dramatic increase in the number of work days lost.


Veterans Committee Additions Aid Rizzuto
Phil Rizzuto's chances of getting into the Hall of Fame were apparently boosted yesterday by the addition of YOGI BERRA and PEE WEE REESE -- both members of the Hall -- and the National League president, BILL WHITE, to the veterans committee.
Both Berra and White are close friends of Rizzuto.
Berra played on 14 pennant winners with the Yankees, several with Rizzuto as a teammate.
White and Rizzuto shared the microphone and a friendship on TV.
Reese, the former Brooklyn shortstop, is known to favor Rizzuto's election by the veterans committee.


Just Put Your Hands on the Bunny and Smile
At 8:15 A.M. they descend on Camp DeBaun: 8 photographers toting 24 cameras, 70 rolls of film, 16 light stands, 8 light meters, 8 logs, 8 signboards, 144 plastic combs and 1 stuffed bunny named Thumper.
By day's end, the crew has photographed each of the day camp's 700 youngsters, individually and with their bunks.


New York Team Wins Bridge Title
A team from the New York metropolitan area came from behind here late Friday night to capture the Women's Knockout Team Championship at the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals.
Gail Greenberg and Judy Tucker of Manhattan, Dorothy Truscott of the Bronx, Irina Levitina of Teaneck, N.J., Stasha Cohen of Glen Ridge, N.J., and Rozanne Pollack of Englewood, N.J., trailed by 18 imps into the final quarter but then won by 24 imps.
The losers were the top-seeded foursome of Kay Schulle and Jill Meyers, both of Santa Monica, Calif., Cheri Bjerkan of Elmhurst, Ill., and Janice Seamon of Miami.


THE TWISTED LEGACY OF IRAN-CONTRA
I am not a Republican, and I tend to be antiestablishment, but Lawrence Walsh is a hero to me because of his integrity, honesty and perseverance.


Learner-Friendly Courses
SANDRA Tolchinsky, a senior at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, said that when she was a freshman she was nervous about taking Calculus I and II, both required courses.
But after participating that year in the school's Save Our Students program, or S.O.S., she said, her fears faded so dramatically that she switched her major from journalism to math, which requires Calculus III.
Miss Tolchinsky was in the first class at Fairleigh Dickinson's Teaneck campus required to take S.O.S., an initiative designed to make courses more student-friendly while maintaining the standard curriculum.


Truce Creates Opening for Christopher
In brokerng a cease-fire along Israel's northern border, Secretary of State Warren Christopher did himself a favor.
The truce means that his trip next week to try to revive the Middle East peace talks will not be conducted under the shadow of full-fledged war in southern Lebanon.
A senior State Department official acknowledged today that as long as citizens in northern Israel had to remain huddled in bomb shelters away from Katyusha rockets fired by guerrillas in southern Lebanon, and as long as Lebanese and Palestinian refugees were streaming north to escape Israeli bombardment, the prospect for a successful trip were virtually nil.


Center-Court Star at Center Stage
DRESSED in jeans, a black jacket and recycled shoes, Martina Navratilova floated up the escalator into the hot, white light of the television cameras, some kind of blond, casual goddess rising from the sea.
Smiling but moving as fast as one of her groundstrokes, she blistered through the tony, largely gay crowd waiting breathlessly to see her in the upper reaches of Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night.
A few mumbled hellos and she was gone, tucked safely away inside one of those rooms reserved for stars like her at times like these.


Finding Source Material
To the Editor:
In his essay on Terrence McNally's play "A Perfect Ganesh"  [ "In McNally Country, Life Is All and Nothing," July 11 ] , David Richards suggests that the play is reminiscent of the work of Tennessee Williams, quoting a line from "The Night of the Iguana": "Nothing human disgusts me unless it's unkind, violent." This is in reference to Zoe Caldwell's line in the McNally play: "Before I die, I want to kiss a leper fully on the mouth and not feel revulsion."


A Woman's Ordeal Helps Her Become A Better Pastor
FOR the Rev.
Alice O'Donovan, being open about her sexual orientation has been like letting a genie out of a bottle.
"The genie never goes back in the bottle," she said.
"You can't ever take it back."
Five years ago, Ms.
O'Donovan became the first openly gay person to be ordained a United Church of Christ minister in Connecticut.
She paid a price for her honesty, she said, but her struggle for acceptance has deepened her spirituality and made her a more compassionate pastor.


Homemade Ice Cream, Fresh Fruit Taste
WITH berries, peaches and plums -- and the weather -- all at their peak, it is the perfect time for making ice cream.
I often buy too much fruit because it looks so good at the farm stand, and I usually end up making it into ice cream before it turns bad.
The other day, after spending an afternoon picking raspberries at a local farm, my 5-year-old son tripped and scattered the contents of his baskets all over the ground.
He was dismayed until I told him we would rinse off the berries and use them to make ice cream.


Proud, Official Partners
James D'Eramo does not care whether people like him or not.
But he does care about equal rights.
So in March Mr.
D'Eramo stood fifth in line with his lover, Will Wake, to sign a new registry that is the City of New York's official acknowledgment of their commitment to each other.
Straight from the City Clerk's Office, where they signed a registry for unmarried heterosexual and homosexual partners, the couple went to an airline counter to put their new status to the test.
In canceling an Italian vacation trip, they demanded the same bereavement benefits given to married couples.
Mr.
Wake's father had recently died.
It took their new certificate to persuade Alitalia Airlines to give full ticket refunds to both men.


Through the Looking Glass and Into 'Our Town'
What Thornton Wilder seized upon as the simplest stuff of human drama is still scattered about this unaffected town more than half a century later, from cemetery glade to lacy front porch.
It feels natural here to remember young Emily and George shyly approaching love and beyond in "Our Town." Still, a visitor may owe it to Wilder's memory to also keep in mind a bit of murderous Uncle Charley terrorizing his small-town kin in "Shadow of a Doubt," the 1943 Hitchcock movie Wilder co-wrote from the same character ingredients of the shadowy American soul.


A Republican Attacks Whitman, Too
With James Carville acting as the chief political strategist for New Jersey Gov.
Jim Florio's re-election campaign, the Republican challenger, Christine Todd Whitman, expected to be bashed by one of the supreme masters of hardball politicking.
But Mrs.
Whitman could not have anticipated that the slugger would be from her own party: Roger Ailes.
On Tuesday, Mr.
Ailes, who guided Ronald Reagan and George Bush to Republican Presidential victories, unleashed the kind of blistering attack on Mrs.
Whitman that he used to reserve for Democrats.


No Hair Spray, No Spangles
Mary-Chapin Carpenter loves the mall.
It makes her feel beautifully anonymous.
Walking beneath plastic faux cathedral ceilings, drowned in lighting as bright as a flashbulb pop, she leaves at bay, for a few hours, her career as a country singer-songwriter and becomes just another neurotic shopper looking for a bargain.
"There's something oddly therapeutic about it," she says.
"When you've had a hard week, and you want to be by yourself but you want some outside stimulation or surrealness, take yourself to the mall. You can fog out and just look in the windows."
On a Friday afternoon after a band rehearsal for a tour that starts in a few days, Carpenter drives her Toyota Land Cruiser to the Tysons Corner mall in the suburbs of Washington, not far from her home in Old Town Alexandria, Va.
Right now Carpenter is one of the top-selling stars in country music.
Her 1992 album "Come On Come On," a crisp, jangly blend of pop, folk and country influences, has been certified platinum, for sales of one million copies; her previous effort, "Shooting Straight in the Dark," released in 1990, has been certified gold (sales of 500,000).
In February, she won her second Grammy Award, for Country Vocalist, Female.
And Carpenter has been on tour practically nonstop since the release of "Come On Come On" about a year ago, playing to sold-out audiences both here and in Europe.


Week of Free Events for the Family
SUMMERTIME is also family fun time, and there are a number of good listening opportunities this week.
Heritage Celebrations are scheduled today and next Sunday from 1 until 6 P.M. at Kensico Dam Plaza in Valhalla.
Polish bands and other Polish entertainers spark the party today while Hispanic musical traditions will be in the limelight next Sunday.
For more details, the number to call is 285-7275.
The Bronx Arts Ensemble, off to an early start in celebrating its 20th-anniversary season, is also presenting a free Sunday series in the Bronx through Aug. 22, with 2 P.M. programs at Rockwood Drive Circle in Van Cortlandt Park (near Broadway and Mosholu Avenue) and 4 P.M. encores in Fordham University's McGinley Center (on Southern Boulevard).
In case of rain, the outdoor programs will move to the Church of the Mediator, on Kingsbridge Avenue at West 231st Street.


Denver
It is a rare vacation destination that offers country music, the works of Michelangelo and a visit by Pope John Paul II.
The Pope is scheduled to arrive in Denver on Aug. 12 and celebrate Mass there on Aug. 15, an event that is expected to draw some 500,000 visitors to the city.
In conjunction with his trip, the Colorado History Museum is offering a showing of selected works from the Vatican collection, including those of Michelangelo, Rubens and Bernini.
A vibrant city that exhilarates without exhausting, Denver has plenty of elbow room, geographically and intellectually.
With its Old West heritage and New West vision, Denver is a place where cowboy boots rest under computer terminals in refurbished glass-and-stone buildings that once housed rowdy saloons.
Vegetarian restaurants are easy to find, as are places serving elk and buffalo.
Amendment 2 -- blocked by the Colorado Supreme Court until a trial this fall -- which would have prevented the state and any municipality from passing legislation to protect homosexuals from discrimination, was passed in Colorado last year but soundly rejected by voters in Denver.


Business Diary/July 25-30
COMPANIES Big Blue Will Make Deep Cuts -- But Precisely Where?


The Dishes Done? O.K., You Can Watch Lifetime
Lifetime television likes to call itself the women's cable network.
Its ads for "L.A. Law" focus on the series' sexy male stars.
There's no football on New Year's Day.
And it did, after all, save "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," that paean to urban female angst, when NBC canceled it in 1989.
But Molly isn't on anymore, not even in reruns.
And while there is worthy programming, not every show seems to convey the messages one might expect from an effort by and for women in the 1990's.


Washington at Work; War Room General Plots Fight on Economic Turf
In the middle of chaos, with computer printers humming, phones ringing nonstop and five television monitors blaring, Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman calmly surveyed the Administration's war room as he planned the next forays in the protracted battle to push the President's budget package through Congress.
Mr.
Altman has been hunkered down in this overstuffed room for the past three weeks, ever since the White House asked him to run the war room operations.
The 30 people he oversees are responsible for developing and executing a strategy to nudge or straight-arm (whatever it takes) President Clinton's $500 billion deficit-reduction plan through Congress.


What Price Art?
To the Editor:
In a world of instant gratification via television and music videos and of classical-music radio stations that play only one movement of a work, why is it necessary to continue to perform in a more or less 19th-century mode and ask people to sit down, be quiet and concentrate?


F.B.I. Inquiry Into Note by Dead Clinton Aide
Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed White House staff members late Thursday afternoon about a delay in the handling of a torn-up note written by Vincent W. Foster Jr., the White House aide who was found dead on July 20, a Justice Department spokesman said today.
The F.B.I. lent some agents to the United States Park Police to try to learn why the note, found on Monday in Mr.
Foster's briefcase by a colleague, was not given to the Park Police until Tuesday night, said Carl Stern, the spokesman.
The Park Police is investigating the circumstances of Mr.
Foster's death from a gunshot wound in a roadside park in suburban Virginia; by all accounts so far, he committed suicide.


Corrections
An article on page 1 of the New Jersey Weekly today about three Indian tribes whose efforts to seek Federal recognition or obtain land in New Jersey have been opposed by the state's casino industry misidentifies a genealogist hired by one tribe.
He is Roger D. Joslyn.


Mr. October Is Now A Man For All Seasons
On a Saturday in June 1977, Martinez Jackson, a tailor in Wyncote, Pa., just outside of Philadelphia, received a phone call from his son, Reggie, in Boston, and it was clear that his son was terribly upset.
Martinez Jackson had raised Reggie pretty much alone, after he and his wife had divorced when the boy was 6.
He raised him on Greenwood Avenue in Wyncote, the block where all the blacks in town lived.
At the time of the call, Reggie Jackson was 31, an outfielder with the New York Yankees, and it came after a game against the Red Sox.
Reggie had always said that his father is the most important influence in his life and he talked often to his father, at that point in 1977, over the 10 years of his major league baseball career.


The Urge to Suppress Persists in South Africa
IT is more than three years since the words of Nelson Mandela were unbanned in South Africa, and 10 years since the censors legalized "Tropic of Capricorn" and "Portnoy's Complaint." At talks on building democracy, all the major parties have included free speech in their proposals for a new bill of rights.
Freedom is so much in fashion that even the former state censor now presents himself as a born-again champion of artistic and political liberty.
But two events in recent days have aroused debate about whether the temptation to suppress is really dead or merely dormant, waiting to be called up in service of different sensibilities.


Buttons And Beaus
The pace of change in businessmen's fashion is often equated with the movement of a snail.
But last week in Seventh Avenue showrooms, executives and buyers from stores around the country gave a fresh look to the classic three-button single-breasted suit jacket by buttoning only the top button.
The idea, a style that was popular among Victorians and Edwardians, surfaced in Italian designer collections two years ago.
Then a few young men picked it up last summer.
What's new this year is the number of mature businessmen in ties who are adapting a style that young men are wearing with T-shirts.


Bridge Builder?
To the Editor:
Congratulations on the enlightening presentation of RuPaul as performer and person  [ "How RuPaul Ups the Ante for Drag," July 11 ] .
As a transsexual, it is heartening to see the media pierce the veil of negativity surrounding drag queens and recognize the validity of the person within.


Lady Fairfax And Her Millions
To the Editor:
The story about Lady Fairfax ("Who's That Lady?" July 18), who spent $17 million on a triplex at the Pierre Hotel, reports that she says she would like to dedicate her life to helping people; the poor of Thailand, for example.


Alcohol's Effect on Learning
PROFS.
Philip J. Cook and Michael J. Moore of Duke University asked themselves this: "If drinking adversely affects productivity on the job, what is alcohol's effect on education?" To find the answer they embarked upon a nationwide study of drinking among high school students and its effect on their rates of graduation and college matriculation.
Their conclusion: Drinking seems to have a significantly bad effect on academic performance.
And their prescription: Raise the minimum drinking age and the tax on beer sales.

CLINTON APPROVES A PLAN ON BOSNIA
President Clinton gave his final approval today to a plan for using air strikes to help protect the Bosnian Muslims, Administration officials said.
The United States has called for a NATO meeting in Brussels on Monday to discuss the proposal.
The President's decision means that despite recent progress in negotiations on partitioning Bosnia, Washington is determined to press ahead with planning for air attacks to safeguard Muslim civilians and protect aid deliveries.


A Week For Fashion
Men's-wear party, Council of Fashion Designers of America, July 26.


The Trouble With Drug Testing
To the Editor:
I take issue with Ira Lipman's philosophy, his statistics and his conclusions. To wit:


Hypnotic Images From the Core of Islam
Religion and political conflict walk hand in hand.
In Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka and India, sectarian battles rage on, and events from the Islamic world are especially grim.
In Bosnia, Muslims are slaughtered by Christians, while Muslim militants kill tourists in Egypt and scour the streets of Teheran punishing moral infractions, all in the name of religious principle.
Yet violence and conflict are the farthest thing from one's mind when visiting "The Divine Word of Islam," at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, a show that offers a handful of gorgeously ornamented pages from the Koran, the great holy book of Islam.
The exhibition, drawn from the Sackler's Vever collection and organized by Marianna Shreve Simpson, a curator of Near Eastern Islamic art, not only demonstrates the meditative, mystical core of a religion but also suggests how incomplete a picture one has of any culture when evaluating it by political standards alone.


Lisbon Transport
To the Editor: I would like to add to your informative article, "What's Doing in Lisbon" (July 18), that public transportation in and around Lisbon is a pleasure.
My husband and I spent a week in Lisbon at the beginning of July using city bus transportation to all places of interest.
"Frommer's Comprehensive Travel Guide -- Portugal" gave us the number of the bus to take to our destination.
We would write the number on a piece of paper and show it to shopkeepers, who would point to the direction of the bus stop.
We found all the bus stops clearly marked with the number of the bus line.
The cost of this efficient transportation was less than a dollar.


Pilgrims' Progress
Imagine how amazed the Pilgrims would be to discover, three centuries later, that their starched white collars and simple black robes were the height of fashion for fall 1993.


Q and A
Blocked Co-op Rental Question: I purchased a studio co-op five years ago on the Upper East Side.
The board, however, has threatened to cancel my proprietary lease if I sublet my apartment.


Meditating to Try to Lower Crime Rate
THE silence was earsplitting.
Less than 100 yards away, cars and buses honked on a busy avenue in a Washington neighborhood known for indiscriminate gunplay.
But with eyes closed and minds "floating," nearly 60 men, women and children concentrated on not concentrating.
Legs crossed, they lined up in rows on a foam pad in a dimly lightedcollege gymnasium.
Trying to wipe their minds free of any thoughts, they focused on a silent mantra that only they could hear.


A New Russian Empire?
Two years ago, Moscow lost an empire, stranding 25 million ethnic Russians in newly independent republics.
Now nationalist opponents of Boris Yeltsin's Government and factions in its demoralized and fragmented armed forces are dreaming of a new Russian empire.
And they're not just dreaming.
Some Russian military commanders posted in the new republics have begun to act.
In Tajikistan, an old-style Communist regime recently defeated a coalition of Muslims and democrats in a civil war.
Russian troops now fire across the Tajik border into Afghanistan to hold off supporters of the ousted regime.


Preparing to Meet Terrorists Bearing Plutonium
NEARLY two decades ago the Federal Government formed an elite, super-secret team to hunt down nuclear weapons that bad guys of one sort or another might hide on American soil.
Now, with the bombing of the World Trade Center in February and the unraveling of a plot to blow up other New York City targets in July, the team is racing to update its methods and gear.
Even President Clinton has fretted about one of the most nightmarish of modern scenarios -- terrorists with the ultimate weapon.
Making a nuclear warhead is certainly a lot harder than concocting a homemade bomb out of diesel fuel and fertilizer, which is what the Trade Center bombers did.
A prime worry is the possibility of stolen warheads.
The country's two major nuclear weapons labs are now working to improve methods for tracking them down and are wrestling with what to do if one should ever be found -- a predicament the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, or NEST, is meant to confront.


Modell Opts to Leave Rather Than Squeeze
Next month, for the first time in 30 years, Art Modell will be absent when the National Football League opens crucial television negotiations with the three major networks.
The Cleveland Browns' 67-year-old owner, after a heart attack and three major operations in the last 10 years, said it was time to quit.
One owner speaking on the record and other people within the N.F.L. who asked that their names not be used said Modell stepped down because he realized that aggressive new club owners wanted to get every possible dollar from the networks, no matter how much money the networks might lose.
At first, television rights to N.F.L. games were sold cheaply.
But in Modell's 30 years as the N.F.L.'s chief negotiator alongside the commissioner (first Pete Rozelle and now Paul Tagliabue), the league negotiated $8.4 billion in network contracts.
Each team's national television income rose from $400,000 in 1962 to $40 million this year.


Fear and Fascination Of Snakes
For one who had to turn his head when a snake slithered across a marble mosaic floor in the introductory scenes of the television series "I Claudius," I found Pete Dunne's article (July 4) about snakes fascinating even though it changed my phobic feelings very little.
I too have early memories.
I was about 7 and spending a harrowing vacation at a camp on the Metedeconk River.
More mornings than not, I woke up at reveille and recoiled at the sight of a large black snake coiled up on the floor in the middle of the tent.


Symbols of Summer and Bits of Whimsy
THE New Jersey Designer Craftsmen must have worked hard to create symbols of the lazy days of summer.
A visit to the Members' Show at their gallery provides a tranquil interlude filled with lush flowers, fruit and small animals.
There are no garish colors or aggressive themes, simply the serene appeal of well-executed designs in a variety of media, with a few delightful touches of whimsy.
Any craft artist who lives or works in New Jersey is eligible to join the organization.
Considering this open policy, the overall quality of work by 104 members is surprisingly good.
A year-round display area in the rear of the gallery shows work by the organization's top artists, who were selected by a jury.


Down From the Self-Esteem High
CAN student achievement in math, science and other academic subjects be increased if teachers boost the self-esteem of their pupils?
For years conventional wisdom has said yes: more self-confidence will help all students, but particularly girls, members of minority groups and, increasingly, gay and lesbian youth who see their sense of self diminished by an indifferent public school system.


Fantasy Or Affront?
When Jean-Paul Gaultier showed a Hasidic-inspired collection in Paris last March (right and below), some people accused him of being insensitive to Jews.
Now French Vogue is being called anti-Semitic for photographing the clothes in Borough Park, Brooklyn, which has a large population of Hasidic and Orthodox Jews.
One photo in August's issue shows two women smoking cigars.
"The whole thing is very offensive," said Rabbi Morris Shmidman, the executive director of the Council of Jewish Organizations of Borough Park.
"To take men's mode of clothing and make that into a modish thing for women is extremely inappropriate in this community."


Creating a Morally Coherent Universe
To the Editor:
The review by Margaret Forster of Frances Sherwood's historical novel, "Vindication" (July 11), told me almost nothing about the novel, except that it's based on the life of Mary Wollstonecraft and that Ms.
Forster thought it "a good novel," worth a few grudging compliments on style, dialogue and detail.
It did, however, tell me a great deal about the reviewer's extreme, almost humorous discomfort with the very intention of historical novels -- the intention of all novels, for that matter.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
SUMMER MEDITATIONS By Vaclav Havel.
Translated by Paul Wilson.
Vintage, $11.
The president of the Czech Republic reflects on the new politics of Eastern Europe and the tension in his own life between his role as intellectual and his role as leader.
"Freedom-loving people everywhere owe Vaclav Havel a lasting debt of gratitude and admiration for what he has done and said to define the basics of liberty," Ralf Dahrendorf said here last year.


Falcons Sign Top Draft Pick
The Atlanta Falcons' top draft pick, LINCOLN KENNEDY, signed a three-year, $3.019 million contract yesterday and then was cleared immediately for full-contract drills.
The former University of Washington star, the ninth player chosen in the N.F.L. draft, was inserted as the left guard on the starting offensive line. (AP)


Working Around Walls In Crooked Rooms
BUILDING a partition wall is usually a fairly easy exercise.
But when the existing walls, floor, ceiling do not meet at right angles the work can become a nightmare.
Here are two wall-building methods that professionals use in crooked rooms.
Before starting measure between both ends of the existing walls that will be parallel to the partition wall to determine whether the existing walls are parallel to each other.
If they are, measure from either of them along the floor at both ends of the room to determine the position of the partition wall.
Mark the position by snapping a chalkline between.


Britain Flunks a Test Of National Curriculum
THE FIRST WEEK in June, students in Fred Close's ninth-year English class in London sat down to 12 pages of word drills and reading exercises, part of a new nationwide examination intended to measure how well they and other 14-year-olds were absorbing the lessons of Britain's five-year- old national curriculum.
But when the students turned in their work, the only grade Mr.
Close handed out was to the Government ministers and bureaucrats who had designed the test: he flunked them for designing an exam he said was badly organized and cumbersome to grade, and bore little relationship to what is actually taught in the classroom.

Despite the F.B.I., Mann's Daughter Was Never a Communist
To the Editor:
I was surprised by "Thomas Mann's Daughter an Informer" (news article, July 18), which reviews the work of a professor of German literature, Alexander Stephan, based on recently declassified Federal Bureau of Investigation files.
The headline itself is grossly misleading.


Japan's Moment, and Ours
By the time an ill George Bush collapsed into Kiichi Miyazawa's lap in Tokyo 18 months ago, it was easy to imagine that Mr.
Bush and his Republican Government might be out of power soon.
It was hard for anyone to foresee that Mr.
Miyazawa's Liberal Democratic Party would be headed the same way.
Yet two months of political turmoil have apparently insured that the insurgent Morihiro Hosokawa will become Japan's first non-L.D.P. prime minister since 1955.
Where the turmoil will finally lead turns on whether Japan can do anything about the fundamental oddity of its postwar regime: the combination of a very strong Government and very weak political control.


Political Memo; Flinching Over Washington's Hand in State Wallets
As Governor of Arkansas, President Clinton was just as generous as other state and local officials in ridiculing the Federal Government's practice of sticking its long arm into their affairs, particularly when it came to how they spent their money.
So it was no surprise when Mr.
Clinton, speaking by satellite to the National Conference of State Legislatures gathered here, sought to reassure his former colleagues.
"The evidence is clear, at least based on my personal experience," he said, "that Federal money goes farther, does more good, has a bigger impact, if we stop trying to micromanage it and overregulate it, and instead let it be spent where the people and the problems are."


Social-Climbing Tintypes, Yearning to Be Paintings
In a famous passage from Baudelaire's critique of the Salon of 1859, the poet railed that once photography came along and proved itself equal to art in reproducing nature, "our squalid society rushed, Narcissus to a man, to gaze on its trivial image on a scrap of metal." Indeed the public's devotion to the daguerreotype depended largely on the medium's skill at portraiture.
The 19th century luxuriated in the new-found pleasure of having its likeness ever within view.
When cheaper forms of photography were devised in the 1850's, the democratizing nature of the medium became ever more evident.
Cheapest of all was the tintype, invented in America in 1856.
The tiniest images, 36 stamp-size pictures made on a single plate, might sell for as little as 12 for 25 cents.
The working classes and the poor could now afford to be immortalized.


Behind Tokyo Reformer's Rise, a Crafty Politician
Japan has always had prime ministers, and always had a small clique of other politicians who really ran the country.
Not surprisingly, for all the tumult over reform and change here in the last week, some things have stayed very much the same.
So while the capital was immersed in one of the most remarkable power scrambles this country has seen since the end of World War II, Japanese flocked to the bookstores to snap up the latest book explaining the future of their country.


Hitting the Half Notes
DON SPENCER lived up to his billing as Australia's King of the Kids, which is to say he came across as a Crocodile Dundee version of Raffi.
Wearing sneakers, jeans, a T-shirt imprinted with brightly colored animal pictures and a 12-string guitar, Mr.
Spencer bounded into the concert last Saturday evening that ended the daylong Kids Music Seminar.
The impact of his sunny tenor and wink-'n'-a-grin humor on the 300 people (perhaps 50 of them children) in the Imperial Ballroom at the Sheraton New York was instant as he let fly "Feathers, Fur or Fins." This was not the evening's first or last song about all creatures great and small, but Mr.
Spencer, more than the other adult performers, had the most glowing presence.
Before the song's first clap-your-hands chorus, every 3-, 4- and 5-year-old had rushed the stage.


There's No Relief, But Yanks Still Win
Buck Showalter stopped briefly to chat with Spike Owen during batting practice at Yankee Stadium yesterday afternoon.
It was a mental-health check, really, the manager taking the time to be certain that the shortstop wasn't stewing or sobbing over the fact that he no longer plays every day.
Showalter found, though, that there was never any reason for concern.
Owen hasn't whined or complained but rather waited patiently for his opportunity to contribute -- which is exactly what he did yesterday.

More Bombings: Italy's Religious Heritage Under Attack
As all too often in its modern history, Italy's response to political uncertainty has turned to violence.
Car bombs last week in Milan and Rome killed five people and seriously damaged the historic churches of St.
John Lateran -- a major Christian shrine -- and San Giorgio in Velabro, one of Rome's oldest places of worship.
In Milan a gallery of modern was damaged.
The explosion broke a gas main and started a fire that destroyed a wing of the Royal Palace.

Representative Paul B. Henry, 51, Dies After Battling Brain Cancer
Paul B. Henry, a former political science professor who became a Congressman and a rising star in the Republican Party, died yesterday at his home in Grand Rapids, Mich.
He was 51.
The cause was brain cancer, a Congressional staff spokesman said.


Lauren J. Turell and Ken Kramer
Lauren Jill Turell, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Perry H. Turell of Short Hills, N.J., was married last evening to Hal Kenneth Kramer, the son of Sondra Kramer of Fort Lee, N.J., and Ronald D. Kramer of New York.
Rabbi Jerry Heller performed the ceremony at Crystal Plaza, a catering establishment in Livingston, N.J.
Mr. and Mrs.
Kramer, both 27, graduated from the University of Rochester.
She is an assistant treasurer in the commercial real estate division of the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.


Music Heads For School
Time was when flannel-clad collegians headed for campus with a tennis racket and ukulele.
Today, portable stereos top the list of extracurricular paraphernalia, and students preparing to return to school are pondering options in carry-along sound gear.
Leaving aside various species of the Walkman, which can be heard only with earphones, the boom box is the most popular choice for portable sound.
The better models have advanced far beyond the notorious noisemakers of yesteryear, and the best of them don't even boom.
Even so, they still have limitations.
Luciano Pavarotti in full voice might rattle a boom box, and symphonic onslaughts leave them shaken.
But they do well with jazz and pop, and there is something to be said for a complete stereo system that can be picked up by a handle.


POSTINGS: City Seeks a Developer -- Again; Anyone for the Old U.N. School?
Could the fourth time be the charm for the former United Nations School at First Avenue and 51st Street?
New York City officials have tried for a decade to find a developer who would preserve the exterior of this handsome 103-year-old Romanesque Revival structure.
Three auctions have failed to make a successful match.
Tomorrow, the city's Economic Development Corporation will issue a request for proposals, rather than going to auction.
Under the new guidelines, a developer would have to preserve and maintain the old facade but would be allowed to exploit the full zoning potential of the site, adding up to 106,500 square feet to the existing 42,000-square-foot structure.
That could yield a tower of 15 to 20 stories over the four-story school building.


The (Bruised) Emperor of the Outdoors
A boy's life in the American West can be like a summer that never ends.
So it was for Bruce Babbitt, who grew up with the sunset-colored breach of the Grand Canyon as his backyard.
He chased deer, caught snakes, built tree forts, floated rivers, scavenged for arrowheads, fought forest fires, fished with Indians, shot birds, followed dinosaur tracks, skied the first snow of November and dreamed about it all at night.
He never spent much time with the Boy Scouts, he said, because it would have been superfluous.
In January of this year, as Babbitt became the 47th Secretary of the Interior, the Bible had barely closed at the swearing-in ceremony when he allowed himself a kid-in-charge-of-the-candy-warehouse chuckle.
The vast public domain, shrines of the natural world and the big scraps left over from the land America took from the natives, bought from the Europeans and wrestled away from the Mexicans, was his to run.
Babbitt was given control of an area bigger than France -- 503 million acres of forests and open range, national parks and wildlife refuges, seashores and Indian reservations.


Loose Change Can Yield Treasures
THERE are a few good coins floating around, and if you keep checking your loose change, you might find one.
That's because the American Numismatic Association and the United States Mint have placed five coins into circulation that would normally be closely held by collectors.
The hope is to raise interest in coin collecting as a hobby and to publicize the association's annual convention, being held this weekend in Baltimore.
The most valuable of the five coins is a 1909 cent minted in San Francisco and donated by the association.
The coin was put into circulation at a McDonald's restaurant in Towson, Md., on July 23.
The coin is worth $420.


110,000 Young Players Help Fuel State's Passion for Soccer
AS the soccer field here baked on a 100-degree day, Brian Fahey stood on the sidelines watching his 12-year-old son, David, carve his way around two opponents and send a long ball sailing toward the goal.
"Soccer is on the verge of exploding," predicted Mr.
Fahey, a lawyer whose three older sons also played the sport.


Turkish Taxi
To the Editor: When my wife and I were in Istanbul last April, we were warned against unmetered cabs, whose drivers would overcharge and otherwise take advantage of trusting foreigners.
Our experience was quite different.
Only unmetered cabs were available when we needed to get back to our hotel from the Grand Bazaar, all of them asking the equivalent of $8 or $9 for the trip.
One man finally agreed to take us for $7, an offer we accepted with great trepidation.


FLOOD WATERS FILL A ST. LOUIS SUBURB
A levee break on the Missouri River just west of here swamped more than 15 square miles of lowland in the city of Chesterfield as the leading edge of cresting flood waters began to hit the St.
Louis area.
Officials in Chesterfield, a suburban city of 42,000, said there were no injuries either from the flooding or the evacuation in near panic after the break in the Monarch Levee about 10:30 P.M.
Friday.
And today along the barricades of Route 40, just 100 yards from where the highway was swallowed up by the river, there was talk among the refugees of pets, computers and valuable machinery left behind.


On Sunday; Muslims Resent the Stain Left By 'That Gang'
EVEN before the mosque closed down it had seemed emptier, its possibilities paler, once Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman was taken off the streets by immigration officials and confined, along with his talent for fiery rhetoric, over in New York in an upstate jail cell.
"There's such a bad feeling, a suspicion that this place is crawling with informers," conceded Abu Bakr Ali, an Islamic believer, objecting as city authorities cited a zoning violation to shut down Masjid al-Salam soon after the cleric was silenced.
"The media has painted our mosque as a cell of terror."


THE TWISTED LEGACY OF IRAN-CONTRA
A special prosecutor's mission is to prosecute on the basis of evidence, not to pontificate on assumptions.
Walsh's statement that he would include "things we were not able to prove" in the final report comes very close to a working definition of libel.

WHAT IS IT ABOUT AUGUST?
The common wisdom: nothing happens in August.
It's the Sunday of months -- lazy, dull, ineluctably spoiled by anticipation of September's Monday.
Plus, it's too hot.
Worse, it's the title of an unreadable novel by Judith Rossner.
Journalists know August as "the silly season," the uneventful time of year when newspapers are especially desperate for copy and so rely -- more so than usual -- on fluff.
No surprise, then, that the Aug. 24, 1939, edition of this newspaper devoted an entire page to the previous day's goings-on at the World's Fair then filling Flushing Meadows.
Readers were apprised that a sneezing contest had taken place at the Carrier Corporation's "Igloo of Tomorrow" -- part of a special event that also included a demonstration of the "hay fever hop" by a group of Arthur Murray dancers.
Elsewhere in that day's Times was a six-inch report about an unusually large sea turtle that had escaped from the Fulton Fish Market, attracting crowds as it swam to freedom in the East River.
"Half a dozen Chinese," the paper reported, "were heard to sigh audibly." The story went on for three more paragraphs.
In short, a slow news day.


Terry J. Gushner, Leonard J. Laufer
Terry Jo Gushner, a daughter of Judy and Harvey Gushner of Boca Raton, Fla., was married last evening to Leonard Justin Laufer, a son of Evelyn and Hans Laufer of Manchester, Conn.
Rabbi Alan Fuchs performed the ceremony at Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia.
The bride, 28, is a third-year law student at New York Law School.
She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, from which her husband received an M.B.A. degree.
Her father, now retired, was an owner of Boyd's, a men's clothing store in Philadelphia.


Early Music Goes Flat in New York
New York does not always lead the international classical-music scene, but it generally follows close behind.
Lord knows, it is not the kind of city to get out of the way.
Yet in one of the liveliest and most sweeping musical trends of the century, the Early Music movement, New York has seemed oddly content of late to lag far behind not only European cities like London, Amsterdam and Paris but also American ones like Boston and San Francisco.
True, music of the medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods abounds in churches and small halls around New York.
But the term Early Music has come to mean more: not only an ancient body of works but an esthetic of performance.
Over the last decade, the ethic of period performance practice, originally meant to recreate the long-lost sonorities and styles of genuinely early repertories, has been extended boldly through the 19th century and tentatively into the 20th.


Crime
Think you're paranoid?
Let William J. Caunitz put a focus on those woozy feelings of dread.
If you buy the harrowing premise of this former New York police lieutenant's smartly researched thriller CLEOPATRA GOLD (Crown, $20), Latin American drug cartels are indeed taking over the country, and they are infinitely more cunning and ruthless than the candy man on the corner.
The big dopers Mr.
Caunitz writes about use the most sophisticated weapons and communications systems and the latest aerodynamics technology to transport their huge heroin cargos from Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle to New York.
And when these guys get testy, they feed their enemies to giant anacondas -- right on the stage of a Manhattan movie theater at 112th and Madison. (O.K., so maybe there's a bit of invention at play here.)
The only hope, it seems, is Alejandro Monahan, a half-Irish, half-Tarascan Mexican nightclub crooner who has infiltrated the Cleopatra network, working as the deepest kind of undercover agent for our side.
Alejandro has terrific style, as do the obscenely colorful traficantes.
But there are so many spooks from various ill-defined intelligence agencies running around investigating one another, the author should have assigned them the only law-enforcement officer who doesn't appear in this gaudy underworld -- a traffic cop.


Bribe or Not?
To the Sports Editor:
Since Dave Anderson is so clear about what constitutes bribery ("Honesty and Culpability: A Bribe Is a Bribe," The Times, July 4), I would be curious to know what he thinks about the actions of a city government that tells the owner of a sports team that it will build him a brand-new stadium (at a site he determines) and provide him with huge tax incentives to keep the team in place.

America's Schools Are Not Alone
MANY problems facing your school board, it turns out, are far from unique.
A group of 24 university presidents, chancellors and rectors from around the world gathered recently at New York University to compare notes -- and commiserate -- on common difficulties facing public-school education.
Among the concerns of school officials in Russia, Syria, Nigeria, Greece, India and elsewhere, according to the participants, were chronic overcrowding, a lack of economic resources, a decline in student literacy, the negative impact of television, decreasing popularity of science and a decline in social and family values.


Corrections
An art listing and a picture caption in the Arts &amp; Leisure Guide today misstate the opening date for "American Treasures: 19th-Century Paintings From the National Academy Collection," an exhibition at the National Academy of Design.
It opens to the public on Thursday, not today.


Citing Chains, Eeyore's Books Calls It Quits
Eeyore's, a mainstay in the world of children's books in Manhattan, has closed its doors, a victim of difficult economic times and changing fashions in retail bookselling, its owner said yesterday.
Joel Fram, who founded Eeyore's Books for Children two decades ago, said he closed one of his stores, on Broadway near West 79th Street, on Tuesday, after having closed the other branch, on East 83d Street, in June.


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS Surprises in Canada Mikael Pernfors landed in the final of the Player's Ltd.
International Canadian Open in Montreal and couldn't hide his surprise.
"I never thought it would happen again," said Pernfors, who beat a tired Petr Korda of the Czech Republic, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5, in the semifinals yesterday at Jarry Stadium.
The victory put Pernfors, once one of the top 20 players in the world, in position to win a tournament for the first time since 1988, when he won in Scottsdale, Ariz.
"I thought if I played really well I'd go two or three rounds and if I came up against a really good player, I'd lose," said Pernfors, 30 years old, of Sweden.


The Holocaust and Its Deniers
To the Editor:
Certain often shocking yet unscrutinized numbers become statistical folklore.
Walter Reich's excellent review reports that "22 percent of adults think it seems 'possible' that the Holocaust never happened." Presumably, this measures the success of the Holocaust deniers.


Flood Damage Vast From Any Viewpoint
The swath of destruction cut by the great Midwest flood of 1993 is so wide, so devastating, so awesome, that the small things, the images caught in a blink, often provide the most illuminating and telling perspective on this summer-long rampage by nature.
At night, from 2,500 feet up, under a three-quarter moon, much of Iowa has become a new land of 1,000 lakes, its fields of corn now glistening diamonds that, come the dawn, will reveal themselves to be mostly muck and sodden agricultural ruin.


Zembriski Putts His Way Into The Lead
Walter Zembriski's putting stroke is becoming effective again, and with help with new shafts in his irons he is getting closer and closer to his first victory on the Senior PGA Tour since 1989.
Zembriski's driving accuracy has always been a strength, but it was his irons and putter that worked so effectively today as he moved atop the field in the Northville Long Island Classic after two rounds.


A Business Takes Off By Filling Blank Spaces
HE has been called the Infomercial King and the Head Honcho of Hair Replacement.
But although thenickname may vary, millions of television viewers hear Sy Sperling of Manhasset declare every night that he is "not only the Hair Club president," but "also a client."
His delivery is just bland enough to convince viewers that he is no actor.
His before-and-after demonstration, in which he holds a photograph of his bald head next to a youthful face now framed by thick brown hair, is impressive for the 30 million American men plagued by varying degrees of alopecia, or hair loss.


From Acura, a Third-Generation Integra
HONDA's Acura Division has come a long way in the seven short years since it arrived on these shores as the leader in what has since become a Japanese rush to produce luxury automobiles.
First, there was the Legend sedan, followed by an elegant coupe.
Then came the entry-level Integra, the Vigor sports sedan and the spectacular all-aluminum NSX sports car.
And a new network of dealers was set up to distance the nameplate from Honda's reputation for cheap little cars.


Amy Janower and Samuel Weinstein
Dr. and Mrs.
Murray Janower of Waban, Mass., have announced the engagement of their daughter Amy Janower to Dr.
Samuel Weinstein, the son of Dr. and Mrs.
Joseph M. Weinstein of White Plains.
A September wedding is planned.
Ms.
Janower, 27, is an assistant manager at American Express in New York.
A graduate of Cornell University, she received an M.B.A. from Columbia University.
Her father is chief of radiology at St.
Vincent's Hospital in Worcester, Mass.
Her mother, Linda Janower, is president of Professional Media Services, an information-gathering agency in Boston.


Othello as Bureaucrat and Martinet
THROUGHOUT the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's "Othello," one has the inescapable impression of observing ordinary people in domestic crisis.
Not ordinary as in identifiable.
Ordinary as in boringly mediocre.
As in small.
How startling, then, to read the festival's program notes by the dramaturge and the artistic director, but not the production's director.
Shakespeare's tragedy, one learns, is actually being perceived as domestic.
No larger-than-life characters here.
So this is ordinariness by intent.


THE GUIDE
SUNNYSIDE STORYTELLING
It is fitting that Sunnyside, the home of Washington Irving, America's seminal storyteller, should be the site of contemporary storytelling festivals.
For a third year the house and grounds bordering the Hudson River in Tarrytown will be given over to the reading of tales, performances by puppeteers and music programs on Saturday and Sunday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.
Produced primarily for children, the event is held rain or shine, with space available inside the house as needed.


Nina Handy, David Endicott
Christina Adams Handy, a daughter of Ethel M. Woolverton of Oyster Bay, L.I., and Chalmers Handy of Little Compton, R.I., was married yesterday to David Stephen Endicott, the son of Mrs.
John A. Duly of Atlanta and James H. Endicott of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
The Rev.
Dr.
Harry A. Fifield, a Presbyterian minister and the bridegroom's maternal grandfather, officiated at the Hollyhedge Estate in Solebury, Pa.
Mrs.
Endicott, who is known as Nina, is an assistant vice president and the purchasing manager at Sotheby's in New York.
She graduated from Marymount Manhattan College.


A Trail Links Mexico to Canada
The 2,109-mile Appalachian Trail now has a West Coast counterpart in the recently completed, 2,638-mile Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail.
The Mexico-to-Canada trail, which was authorized under the National Trails System Act of 1968, was inaugurated in June.
It begins just east of San Diego on the Mexican border, cuts north across the Mojave Desert and continues along the spine of the Sierra Nevada.
Eventually, the trail crosses the Cascade Mountain Range in Oregon and Washington and ends in Manning Provincial Park, British Columbia.

Baseball  American League  BALTIMORE ORIOLES -- Placed Mike Mussina, pitcher, on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to July 22.
Activated Arthur Rhodes, pitcher, from the 15-day disabled list.


'In Your Own Backyard,' Some Mysterious Goings-On
AS a title, "In Your Own Backyard" seems to promise work produced in Westchester.
But the show it designates, which is on view in the Castle Gallery at the College of New Rochelle here, can hardly be called Regionalism, for it includes entries from states far beyond New York.
Westchester artists are present, however, and Lucinda Gedeon, director of the Neuberger Museum at the State University of New York at Purchase, did the honors by selecting 34 works from the 250-odd submitted.
The result is a pleasant, well-balanced mix of canvases and works on paper with a sprinkling of sculpture and photographs.


Rangers' Rodriguez Sets Early Return
Texas Rangers catcher IVAN RODRIGUEZ says he plans to return from facial surgery by early next week so he can play in a big series against the Chicago White Sox.
"I want to play in that series," the All-Star said Friday after undergoing surgery to elevate a fractured bone between his left eye socket and ear.
"We have to win that series, and I want to be in the lineup."
Texas (51-51) entered play yesterday five and a half games behind the White Sox in the A.L.
West.
Rodriguez hasn't played since cracking the bone Thursday against Kansas City.
He was injured when HUBIE BROOKS's bat accidentally clipped him on the left side of his facemask during a follow-through.


Suicide in Southampton: Rallying for a Surgeon
ON June 10 a successful East End surgeon received a letter from the State Office of Professional Medical Conduct informing him that he was being disciplined for negligence and incompetence.
The surgeon, Dr.
Vladimir D. Safonov, began composing a protest letter to Health Commissioner Mark R. Chassin saying the disciplinary agency had committed a "great injustice" in his case.
He challenged the fairness of the investigations and hearings and presented a case-by-case rebuttal.


Michele Pigliavento, Daniel Alonso
Michele Pigliavento, an actress, and Daniel R. Alonso, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, are planning a September wedding.
Ms.
Pigliavento, a cum laude graduate of the State University of New York at Geneseo, is appearing in "The Goodbye Girl" on Broadway.
Her parents, Eleaner and Orlando Pigliavento of Schenectady, N.Y., own the Orlando School of Dance there.


Shock Therapy Still Causes Brain Damage; For Insured Whites
To the Editor:
The 1976 California law that restricts electroconvulsive therapy also requires reporting of every treatment in public or private facilities.
The Office of Patients' Rights summarizes these data in annual reports to the Legislature.
They confirm limited access of ethnic minorities to this safe and effective treatment.


Mary Anderson, Aristides Spanos
Dr.
Mary Katharine Anderson, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Harrison C. Anderson of Mission Hills, Kan., was married yesterday to Aristides Vasilios Spanos, the son of Margaret Morrison of Lafayette, N.Y., and William V. Spanos of Castle Creek, N.Y.
The Rev.
Edward Johnston performed the Episcopal ceremony at Christ's Church in Rye, N.Y.
Dr.
Spanos, 31, graduated from Denison University and received a doctorate in veterinary medicine from Kansas State University in May.


Market Research and Product Image
WHEN Reynald Swift, president of Longines-Wittnauer Watch Company in New Rochelle, needed a marketing strategy to create a new image for an old product, he got in touch with B.A.I., a market-research and consulting concern originally called Behavioral Analysis Inc., based in Tarrytown.
"I had worked with them before," Mr.
Swift said.
"When I was at Arm &amp; Hammer, they helped us develop new products. "I like the thoughtful, creative approach they take, and that's what we needed.
Our goal was to strengthen the Wittnauer name and to give it its own identity as a separate brand of watch, which was not as simple as it sounds because for over the last 100 years, Wittnauer has never had its own image; it has always been linked as a companion to the Longines lines."


Placing the Hudson Valley in Perspective
THE Hudson River Valley has long been known locally for the richness of its cultural past.
But interest in the historical significance of the area is no longer confined to the region.
This summer 25 college and university professors from throughout the country gathered at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie to study the national importance of an area that has produced great writers and painters and ultimately produced one of the first visions of a national culture for a fledgling America.
"The Hudson River Valley is the nation's first self-consciously esthetic zone -- the first literal stretch of landscape that was elevated into a symbol of national identity and aspiration," said Dr.
H.
Daniel Peck, a professor of English at Vassar College.
Dr.
Peck was the director of a summer institute, called Hudson River Valley Images and Texts, which studied the region.


BIG GIRLS, DON'T CRY
At last! A fashion editor who sticks up for women with flesh on their bones.
I'm all for "unencumbered lines" and "easy fit," but I'm not so sure about "monochromatic layers" and "minimal jewelry."


Lights! Cameras! Interaction!
LAST Monday, the sky was behaving rudely.
All afternoon, clouds a shade of gray that knots the stomachs of outdoor-event planners were lingering.
The weather forecasters were having a commitment problem.
That meant that the opening night of the Byrant Park Summer Film Festival, sponsored by HBO and Warner Brothers and already rained out the previous Monday, might be postponed again.
Around dusk, as an intrepid audience accumulated for "A Night at the Opera," Michael Fuchs, the 46-year-old chief executive of HBO and the chairman of the Bryant Park Restoration Committee, was looking down at the park from his office just above the tree line on 42nd Street.
"It's not so threateningly dark out there," he said, though he was looking through tinted windows.


BIG GIRLS, DON'T CRY
Your article notes: "More than half the women in America wear at least a size 12 dress." I would suggest that if more than 50 percent of the female population is at least that size, there should be nothing for this significant majority to cry about.
The implication that women need to dress strategically -- the notion of fashion as camouflage -- is condescending.

From the Fresh Air Fund, a Day of Discovery
In the gaggle of children jostling for position around Annie the cow, Bryant Powell was the first to squeeze a fine stream of milk onto the ground.
"Yo," said the 10-year-old from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, who had never before seen a cow.
"It's cool."


A Correction: Staten Island Sites

Sullivan and Gilbert, Starring and Sparring
LET Broadway hold on to its "new Gershwin musical comedy." Westchester's got the new Gilbert and Sullivan show.
Years before Ken Ludwig concocted a silly book to accompany an aimless assortment of Gershwin songs and called it "Crazy for You," he wrote a pastiche, "Sullivan and Gilbert," about a command performance in 1890 before Queen Victoria by the D'Oyly Carte Company, London's resident troupe exclusively devoted to the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan.


Your Home: Roommate Law; Staying On If a Tenant Doesn't
TEN years ago, New York State enacted a "roommate law," acknowledging the rise of nontraditional living arrangements.
The measure gives tenants the right to bring in a nonfamily member without first gaining the consent of the landlord.
Reasons can range from financial to personal.
And hundreds of such roommates moved in.
Today, a growing number of these individuals are facing a follow-up issue.
Under what circumstances, they ask, may they also have the right to stay on should the tenant move out or die?

After 8 Years, A Geneva Bypass
A newly opened strip of highway that bypasses Geneva bridges the gap in a network of high-speed roads connecting northern Europe to the Mediterranean.
Completion of the 6.25-mile link took some 24 years of planning, eight years of construction and more than $8 million.
The new section, called the Autoroute de Contournement de Geneve, runs south from Vernier (near the airport) to Bardonnex on the border with France.


Justice Department Considers Inquiry on Microsoft
The Justice Department is exploring whether it should investigate the Microsoft Corporation for possible antitrust violations, a Government official involved in the review says.
The move comes after the Federal Trade Commission deadlocked on July 21 for the second time in its 37-month inquiry into whether to charge the world's largest software publisher with unfairly dominating the $7 billion market for personal computer software.


A Furniture Store With Museum Airs
THERE was a hush at last Monday's opening of a new shop on Lafayette Street called 1950, which befits a store selling the high-priced output of top French furniture designers of the 1950's.
The aluminum doors, with portholes modeled after those the architect Jean Prouve often used, occasionally admitted a solitary passer-by, who would wander reverently through the 9,000 square feet of sleek furnishings.
But most of the time, the understated pieces by Mr.
Prouve, Jean Royere, Jacques Adnet and others stood aloof and unexamined under lights that cut obliquely through a line of Victorian columns in a most 20th-century way.


Amy Lankenau, Aaron McPherson
Amy Barbara-Lillie Lankenau, a daughter of Alison and John C. Lankenau of New York, was married yesterday to Aaron Francis McPherson, a son of Grace Chapman of Pittsfield, Mass., and John McPherson of Worcester, Mass.
The Rev.
Richard E. Spalding, a Presbyterian minister, officiated at the Wellesley College Chapel in Wellesley, Mass.
Mrs.
McPherson is a student at Wellesley College.
Her father is a partner in the New York law firm of Lankenau, Kovner &amp; Kurtz.
Her mother is the head of student-support services at the Nightingale-Bamford School and an educational therapist, both in New York.


Gothic Arches

In a Posting on July 11 headed "Preserving Gothic Arches" reference is made to a building at City College as "Harris Hall."


With 40 Able-Bodied Seakids, Clearwater Plies the Hudson
RASHEEDA BOCUS took the trip in stride, because as a little girl living in the United States Virgin Islands, she had been on boats many times.
But her campmates at the Grace Church Community Center Day Camp in White Plains said they were a little scared.
They knew about sailboats from television and school, they said, but this one was 106 feet long with a 108-foot-high mast and a 3,000-pound sail, which they later learned was one of the biggest of its kind in the world.
Not only that, but Tora Johnson, who leads daily tour groups on three-hour sails aboard the Clearwater, the Hudson River sloop and flagship of the Poughkeepsie-based environmental group of the same name, said the 40 children themselves would be raising the sail.
They would also go fishing, steer the vessel and examine fish specimens through microscopes.


Dollar Libre: Cuba Tries Tourism And Cash in Crisis
With the neatly twinned announcements last week that Cuba will soon allow its citizens to possess dollars for the first time since its Communist revolution while encouraging Cuban-Americans to visit in large numbers, the Government of Fidel Castro is effectively announcing the grave dimensions of its economic crisis.
Mr.
Castro's gamble is aimed at attracting more, desperately needed foreign dollars and capturing those already in circulation by enabling Cubans to shop stores previously reserved for foreigners.


A Ukrainian Could Envy Russia's Economy
IF the economy in Russia seems wobbly and fraught with the seeds of social and political unrest, consider neighboring Ukraine.
Ukraine's fledgling currency, the coupon, has collapsed against the dollar and the ruble as the central bank's printing presses keep rolling at full speed.
Progress toward privatizing industry is less likely than a year ago.
Hyperinflation devours workers' salaries and capital is in full flight.
Barter and corruption dominate what is left of trading, which could be further hurt by Russia's action last week on the ruble.
In other words, economic reform, even of a tepid kind, is unknown in the second most populous republic of the old Soviet Union.


Keeping Well in Spite of Summer's Hazards
AS the dog days of summer lure people to camping grounds, beaches and backyard barbecues, the County Medical Center and the Department of Health are offering advice on how to cope with some of the hazards of being outdoors -- among them lightning storms, snake bites, beestings and heat-related illnesses.
Among, other warnings, the Health Department advises people not to seek shelter under a tree during thunderstorms.
"If there isn't time to get inside a large building or a car or truck, stay away from any tall isolated object that projects above the landscape," said Valerie P. Goldstein, a Health Department spokeswoman.


The Trouble With Drug Testing
To the Editor:
Mr.
Lipman brushes aside the objections of "critics" who say workplace drug tests are "intrusive and prone to error."


In America; Looking For Work
Scott Scanlon was blunt, and it was enough to make you shudder.
"When people talk about economic recovery," he said, "people tend to think that means more jobs. There's not going to be a recovery in jobs."
Mr.
Scanlon is chairman of Hunt-Scanlon Publishing in Greenwich, Conn.
It publishes a newsletter, Executive Search Review, aimed at senior-level executives who are looking for work.
Some have been looking for two or three years.
For many, the search is hopeless.
The jobs are gone.


Housing vs. Horticulture On Publicly Owned Lot
More than 15 years ago, people who lived near a rubble-strewn city-owned lot on West 84th Street got tired of the drug users and illegal garbage-dumpers the empty space was attracting.
With the city's consent, they turned it into a neighborhood oasis for city-bound gardeners.
But now the New York City Housing Authority, which has legal control over the 9,000-square-foot property between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, wants to put 35 units of public housing there.
And like a foster family balking at giving up a child for adoption, the community is struggling to keep the garden where it is.


Nude Ascending
The model Tatjana Patitz found her film debut in "Rising Sun" embarrassing and morbid.
Her role called for total nudity in a scene that is videotaped and repeated throughout the movie.
After seeing the finished product, she said, "I think I went every color on the palette." She also had a body-bag scene.
"When they lift you into a body bag, you get this sense of depression," said the actress, who wasn't complaining.
"I can't live with regrets."


Nazi-Hunters Look Beyond Demjanjuk
IT was a Solomonic if also political ruling -- not guilty but not innocent.
Last week, the Israeli Supreme Court overturned the conviction of John Demjanjuk as "Ivan the Terrible" of Treblinka, leaving disappointed prosecutors, jubilant defense supporters and anguished death camp survivors struggling to fathom a decision that hinged on accounts of long-dead witnesses in old Soviet files.
Relatives of the 73-year-old former Cleveland auto worker, who had spent the last five years on death row, vowed a campaign to press misconduct charges and bring Mr.
Demjanjuk home, while United States war-crimes investigators who started the case more than a dozen years ago defended their actions and said they would fight his return.


Ms. Rissmeyer, Mr. Wallace
Patricia A. Rissmeyer, the dean of students at Canisius College in Buffalo, was married yesterday to James H. Wallace Jr., the director of residence life at Buffalo State College.
The Rev.
John Weimer performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at the Christ the King Chapel on the Canisius campus.
Ms.
Rissmeyer, 37, is keeping her name.
She graduated from the University of Hartford and received a master's degree in education from the University of Massachusetts.
She is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Walter H. Rissmeyer of Lakewood, N.J.


The Trouble With Drug Testing
To the Editor:
Ira A. Lipman offers an excellent summary of all the reasons for workplace drug testing ("Fight Drugs With Workplace Tests," Viewpoints, July 18) -- for all the wrong reasons.


The Myth of the Independent Director
To the Editor:
Regarding "Boards Protect Shareholders, Right?" (July 11): In my lifetime, I have served on more than 15 boards of directors and the only thing that the directors ever cared about were their interests and the interests of the managers.
On all the boards on which I sat (with one exception) over a period of more than 30 years the directors totally and completely failed in their fiduciary capacity as representatives of the stockholders.


National Merit Scholars From L.I. Are Named
The National Merit Scholarship Corporation has announced the names of 6,5000 high school seniors who have won college scholarships.


More in Buffalo
To the Editor: "What's Doing in Buffalo" on June 27 was both accurate and enjoyable.
Yet I feel compelled to mention other things that visitors might not want to miss.
Allentown, close to downtown, is a historic district famous for its Victorian architecture.
The neighborhood also features art galleries, restaurants and cafes.


Youth Against Censorship
To the Editor:
Regarding "A Chip That Allows Parents to Censor TV Sex and Violence" (Technology, July 18): the sub-headline about the V-chip -- "It's cheap. It's easy. It's controversial: the broadcasters hate it." -- is missing a line.
It should have also said " . . . and kids hate it."


Wall Street; Petsmart Hits the Market Leaping
IT must be the pressing need to teach Fido some decent manners.
Petsmart Inc., a Phoenix-based operator of pet-supply and obedience-training "superstores," has enjoyed a 46 percent surge in its share price.
Petsmart went public on July 23 at $18 a share only to close that same day at $25 and hover around that exalted level the following week.
Stock market bears point to all the exuberance as yet another sign that the overall market is about to go to the, well, you know.


Amanda E. Benson, William E. Powers
Amanda Elizabeth Benson, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Ralph L. Benson of Lexington, Va., was married yesterday to William Eric Powers, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Her father, now retired, was the purchasing manager for the Bobst Groups Inc. in Roseland, N.J., a manufacturer of printing equipment.
Her mother, Jeanne Benson, retired as a special-education teacher at the Kings Road School, an elementary school in Madison, N.J.


Apartments for Fine Feathered Friends
THE intriguing forms resembling totem poles or a Lilliputian playground, which suddenly appeared on the campus of the State University of New York here late in June, are actually birdhouses -- a whole community of them.
The 18 bird cottages, condominiums and cubicles set on three tall wooden poles and arranged like sculpture were made by members of the Minnesota-based American Association of Woodturners, which makes wood turners one word, and installed for the group's seventh yearly symposium here.


Jennifer Plane, Mark Hartman
Jennifer Plane, a daughter of Mary and Robert Plane of Ovid, N.Y., was married yesterday to Mark Thomas Hartman, a son of Gail and Thomas Hartman of Hobbs, N.M.
The Rev.

She graduated from Harvard University.
Her father is the president of Wells College in Aurora and was until recently the wine maker at Plane's Cayuga Vineyard in Ovid.
Her mother was the winery's general manager.


Are Blacks Excluded?
SHOULD America's campuses resemble melting pots that blend a motley assortment of freshmen into a mass of like-minded graduates?
Or should they be more like mosaics where different ethnic tiles glitter equally on the college tableau yet remain sharply distinct?
That clash of images has been central to a spate of books in recent years about multiculturalism, including the much debated broadsides by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Dinesh D'Souza criticizing that trend for destroying the spirit of individualism, assimilation and merit that has defined America.
Now two black voices have entered the fray, those of Paul Robeson Jr. and Cornel West.


Shock Therapy Still Causes Brain Damage; Cost-Effective
To the Editor:
Your generally favorable July 19 article about electroconvulsive therapy is an assessment of a valuable treatment that has been unfairly maligned.
It is important, however, to clarify a number of issues.


Trying Serial Murder: Where to Begin?
Of all the questions surrounding the case of Joel Rifkin, who is accused of killing 17 women, the first quandary prosecutors must resolve is this: Who will get the first crack at convicting him?
Legal experts say the case is a jurisdictional morass involving nine counties in the New York region, since the authorities have said Mr.
Rifkin killed most of the women in Manhattan and dumped their bodies in rivers and woods in a wide area from eastern Suffolk County to northern Putnam County.
The state police are coordinating the murder investigations, but a month after Mr.
Rifkin's arrest, a squadron of prosecutors is still trying to resolve where he will be tried and in what order to bring the cases.


BANGLADESH FACES DISPUTE ON FLOODS
After a recent wave of flooding that killed about 2,000 people in South Asia, Bangladesh has renewed demands that India and Nepal control the powerful rivers that flow though their countries.
Officials in Bangladesh say the flooding has killed at least 150 people and displaced seven million people.

Computer Thieves Hit The Campus
A WAVE of computer thefts has hit the nation's college campuses and is interfering significantly with student work.
"There has been an upswing in the last few months at the larger public computing facilities nationwide," said Douglas Van Houweling, vice provost for information technology at the University of Michigan.
"Toward the end of a semester a student needs the computers and it becomes a major problem when we lose them due to criminal activity."


'Too Clever by Half' Is a Witty Equation
Imagine Lucille Ball, loose in mid-19th-century Moscow.
Lucille Ball with an overbite.
Better still, Lucille Ball with an overbite, wearing a Carmen Miranda turban and an adulterous-red off-the-shoulder evening gown that make her look like the figurehead of a ship transporting loose women to Tripoli.
That may give you an idea -- but only an idea -- of the uproarious performance that Sally Wingert is delivering in "Too Clever by Half," the 1868 satirical comedy by Alexander Ostrovsky that has gotten the Guthrie Theater's 30th season off to a heady start.


Disaster Engulfs Southern Asia
This summer's monsoon in southern Asia has destroyed lives and property with a ferocity not seen in decades.
Two weeks of rains swelled rivers, flooding farmlands stretching east from India's Punjab region, across Nepal and into Bangladesh.
By the end of last week about 4,000 people were dead and millions homeless, and millions of dollars worth of roads, railway lines and bridges were ruined.
Officials in India estimated that the floods may have left 1,000 people dead and as many as 15 million people homeless in that country.
Air force helicopters dropped food to areas in the east, but elsewhere there seemed to be little official effort at relief.

Sports of The Times; Another Reason to Hate Baseball
I faced a terrible dilemma when I came home from vacation.
I wanted to go to a baseball game but I didn't know where to turn.
Baseball is getting so scary.
When the Mets were home, I heard about players aiming explosives and bleach sprays at reporters, and I couldn't find the old hard hat and construction goggles I used to carry in the trunk of my car when I was a news reporter covering coal-mine explosions and urban violence.


IN SHORT: FICTION
EUROPEAN FICTION BROTHER JACOB By Henrik Stangerup.
Marion Boyars, $24.95.
The final novel in the Danish writer Henrik Stangerup's trilogy of European historical fiction, "Brother Jacob" may be his best and most profound.
Though studded with bloody episodes of the primitive, as befits its 16th-century setting, the drama, as energetically translated by Anne Born, turns on the commitments and renunciations of men and women for whom philosophy equals destiny.
The title character, a member of the Danish royal family, joins the Franciscans just as Renaissance turns to Reformation.
When he flees his suddenly Protestant homeland, Jacob's refugee existence becomes a search for utopia, a quest that steers him into quandaries of spirit evoked through nightmare physicality, often suggesting his tormented countryman Hamlet.
At its most sublime, Mr.
Stangerup's novel reconnects artistic integrity with its religious roots.


The Movie Studios' Top 15 Dinosaurs
IT'S called "the boys' club," but there's a "girl" in it, too.
They're paid salaries totaling millions of dollars, they get the best tables in restaurants, the valets never keep them waiting for their Mercedes, they glide from one studio job to another, and whenever they quit their jobs -- or are dumped -- they get more millions, just to keep them happy and, more importantly, quiet.
Nice work if you can get it.


A Sport Hangs On in the Local Clubs
Walk up a flight of stairs, open the heavy metal door and the scene flickers, like slow motion from an old black-and-white movie: Someone is hitting the heavy bag, off in a corner a man in shorts is skipping rope before a mirror, and in the ring, two fighters stalk and jab.
But it isn't a movie and there are no stars.
Boxing may be gone from Madison Square Garden, but it is alive in the city -- particularly in the three big gyms that remain here.
In them, for a couple of bucks and a dream, one man can hit another.


Lavish Proms As Milestones
To the Editor:
I was very dismayed to read Doretta Katzter Goldberg's letter and description (July 11) of the students highlighted in your article "Prom: The Production." The letter is filled with assumptions and innuendoes that do not accurately portray the thousands of students I have come to know as a high school assistant principal in Plainview, L.I.

Her father is a lawyer in New York.
Her mother, known professionally as Eve Preminger, is a Surrogate's Court judge in New York.


How's the Soil? Just Look at the Weeds
WEEDS have a way of letting gardeners know what is under the ground.
Although the Northeast's recent hot weather, high humidity dry soil caused many of these unwanted plants to wilt, weeds are natural soil indicators, just by growing where they do.
Wise are those gardeners who heed what nature is telling them.
Weeds should never be considered as a substitute for a good pH test analysis if a major gardening project is to be undertaken.
But where there seems to be a trouble spot, look to the weeds for possible answers.


Cleopatra Meaney, Joseph Lindner
IN his sunglasses and fadeaway haircut, Joseph Lindner, an assistant football coach at Fordham University, is known for pacing the sidelines during games, looking competitive, fierce and handsome. (Some call him "the GQ coach.")
Off the field, Mr.
Lindner, 29, is an old-fashioned romantic.
He eats dinner by candlelight, listens to Vivaldi, believes in chivalry and counts the Knights of the Round Table among his role models.
Few of his friends were surprised that he met Cleopatra Meaney in a way that combined the jet age with the Dark Ages.


On Wheels: America at 10 M.P.H.; For the Lay of the Land Ahead, Don't Ask Behind
Anyone journeying on a bicycle across personally uncharted territory hungers to know about the local weather and the terrain.

Is the road well traveled?
Hilly?
Anywhere to buy Gatorade along the way?
And which way will the wind be blowing?
In general, accurate renderings of this information are not available.
You simply can't count on what you find out from weather forecasts or local residents.

'Believe In Your Product'
To the Editor:
The great masterworks of the Old World and the New World are not medicines to be swallowed because they're good for you; they are exciting examples of mankind's highest achievements in art.
Our concert halls celebrate the heights to which we can soar -- a welcome respite from the daily reminders of war and bigotry and avarice and hate.
If we cannot sell this vintage, let us find a solution other than diluting it with soda pop.


Bomb Check Closes Street
A two-block stretch of 82d Street near the Metropolitan Museum of Art was closed to traffic for about an hour yesterday morning while a police bomb squad investigated a duffle bag found outside the museum.
A security guard found the blue canvas bag at 8:30 A.M. on the plaza of the museum at 1000 Fifth Avenue, thought it looked suspicious and called the police, said a police spokesman, Sgt.
Anthony Barlanti.
The bag turned out to contain only a radio, the police said.
The museum opened on time at 9:30 A.M., a museum official said.

A Crown Heights Remark Returns to Trouble Cuomo
In an odd sidelight to the debate on Crown Heights, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, who commissioned the report that found Mayor David N. Dinkins had not restrained the police response to the disturbances, may be the only elected official to have publicly suggested otherwise.
A week after the unrest in the Brooklyn neighborhood in August 1991, The Jewish Press, a weekly publication, quoted the Governor as saying in an interview that the Mayor had told him rampaging youths in Crown Heights had been given "a day of grace" to vent their emotions.


Identity Crisis In the Making?
To the Editor:
Edward Rothstein is right on target in his essay "Be Smart as a Lemming, Orchestras Are Told"  [ July 11 ] .
The American Symphony Orchestra League report recommends redefining the ethnicity of American orchestras.
This misguided attempt at a face lift will create a potentially fatal identity crisis for our orchestras.


Steel Pact Lets Union Name a Board Member
The National Steel Corporation averted a strike yesterday when its president, Ronald H. Doerr, shook hands on a deal that will allow the United Steelworkers of America union to name a director to the company board.
Two other steel companies, which have labor contracts that also expired late yesterday, did not seem prepared to meet the same terms.
Armco Inc., based in Parsippany, N.J., persuaded the union to continue working under the old contract until talks resume on Aug. 12; the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, based in Bethlehem, Pa., was studying whether to begin shutting down the huge blast furnaces that need to be stopped before production halts.
Roughly 17,300 employees of Bethlehem are affected by the current round of talks, as are 2,200 at Armco. 'Steady Progress'
"We've made steady progress on the issues and are still hopeful we'll achieve an agreement prior to the midnight deadline," said Henry Von Spreckelsen, a spokesman for Bethlehem.


SURFACING
FITNESS -- Dress codes: The backlash has begun.
The World Gym in Manhattan has banned all street clothes, specifically Dr.
Martens, plaid flannel shirts and cutoff jeans (the preferred uniform at World's rival, the David Barton Gym).

How else to explain the phenomenon of moviegoers of all ages wandering midtown outfitted like Beldar and Prymaat?
FASHION -- Gap underwear: Packaging is destiny -- just ask Calvin.

Matthew B. Ridgway, who died July 26 (front page, July 27), and George C. Marshall were the outstanding soldier-statesmen of our day.
General Ridgway, after having distinguished himself as a combat commander in World War II, was called upon to repair the disaster following Chinese intervention in Korea, and he did so brilliantly.


The Goose That Laid An Egg in the Suburbs
The ubiquitous suburban goose, once of Canada, has proved impervious to fake swans, reflective tape, bobbing oversized balloons, dogs, sirens and firecrackers.
But now there is a new obstacle to its life on the region's parks, ponds, lawns and golf courses: hunters.


Maryland and the Wounded Terrapin
THE University of Maryland mascot, the terrapin, or tidewater turtle, has slowly, methodically defeated his opponent -- the University of Maryland.
Five years ago Scott Rudolph, The Terrapin, broke his arm in three places at a football game against the University of Virginia while pretending to fight The Cavalier, Virginia's swashbuckling mascot.
Maryland, denying liability, argued that, although a symbol of its campus intelligence and persistence, this "turtle" was no state employee.
The courts disagreed.
Final score: Terrapin $5,000, U. of M. 0.

Working Around Walls In Crooked Rooms
BUILDING a partition wall is usually a fairly easy exercise.
But when the existing walls, floor, ceiling do not meet at right angles the work can become a nightmare.
Here are two wall-building methods that professionals use in crooked rooms.
Before starting measure between both ends of the existing walls that will be parallel to the partition wall to determine whether the existing walls are parallel to each other.
If they are, measure from either of them along the floor at both ends of the room to determine the position of the partition wall.
Mark the position by snapping a chalkline between.


How's the Soil? Just Look at the Weeds
WEEDS have a way of letting gardeners know what is under the ground.
Although the Northeast's recent hot weather, high humidity dry soil caused many of these unwanted plants to wilt, weeds are natural soil indicators, just by growing where they do.
Wise are those gardeners who heed what nature is telling them.
Weeds should never be considered as a substitute for a good pH test analysis if a major gardening project is to be undertaken.
But where there seems to be a trouble spot, look to the weeds for possible answers.

35 Protesters Arrested at Abortion Clinic
Thirty-five people were arrested yesterday morning in a protest outside an abortion clinic in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., the police said.
About 160 people, from groups for and against abortion rights, demonstrated outside the Women's Medical Pavilion on Ashford Avenue, said Officer Larry Bonavita of the Dobbs Ferry Police Department.
The demonstration began about 7:30 A.M. and lasted until noon, when the clinic closed.


A la Carte; Finding Something Special in an Out-of-the Way Location
THE month-old Trattoria Grasso is situated midway between Pomodoro and Piccolo, two of the most popular restaurants in Huntington.
That location might, at first glance, seem like the worst possible place for yet another Italian restaurant.
But this tiny, sumptuous cafe is deservedly prospering just on the basis of word-of-mouth.
People who happened upon it realized they had found something special.


Christine Parrillo, Thomas Cantilli
Christine Rea Parrillo, a senior accountant in Hackensack, N.J., at Ernst &amp; Young, was married yesterday to Thomas Matthew Cantilli, an assistant controller of Marpac Industries, a plastics manufacturer in Waldwick, N.J.
The Rev.
Paul Holmes, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated at St.
Gabriel's Church in Saddle River, N.J.
Mrs.
Cantilli graduated magna cum laude from Lehigh University.
She is a daughter of Linda Rea Vernooy of Saddle River and Dr.
Vincent N. Parrillo of Ridgewood, N.J.
The bride's father is a sociology professor at William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J.
Her mother is a media specialist for the Oakland (N.J.) School District.
The bride is a stepdaughter of Robert A. Vernooy and Elizabeth B. Parrillo.


Lindsay Jenkins, Paul Matthews
Mr. and Mrs.
Francis P. Jenkins Jr. of Chappaqua, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter Lindsay Virginia Jenkins to Paul Taylor Matthews, a son of Michelle M. Matthews of Mendham, N.J., and the late Edward J. Matthews.
A September wedding is planned.
Miss Jenkins, a graduate of Sweet Briar College, is a Spanish teacher at the King &amp; Low-Heywood Thomas School in Stamford, Conn.
Her father, formerly a senior executive officer of the First Boston Corporation in New York, is a private investor.

Power Struggle: Central Banks Fight The Tape
IT was classic Bundesbank.
The independent, proud and powerful German central bank was, in the words of one French banker, "determined not to be pushed around by anybody, least of all the markets."
The Buba decision, to do only a bit to cut German interest rates, pushed the latest European currency crisis to a fever pitch just as most of the important people on the Continent were planning to begin their traditional August vacations.
Some traders hoped the governments and central bankers would capitulate this weekend to avoid disturbing their holidays.


School Bias Still at Issue In Yonkers
EIGHT years after a Federal judge ruled that this city deliberately promoted racial segregation in its housing and schools, the educator who optimistically set off to remedy the problem in the classroom returned to court with a poor report card.
During 12 days of court testimony in Manhattan last month -- in a lawsuit to get the state to pay for the second stage of a federally mandated school-desegregation plan -- Superintendent Donald M. Batista and other education officials told United States District Judge Leonard B. Sand that minority students continued to lag behind their white classmates both academically and socially.


A Change for Heart Therapies
Alternative medicine got a boost last week when Mutual of Omaha, the nation's largest provider of health insurance for individuals, announced it would reimburse patients participating in a program that combines diet, meditation, exercise and support groups to reverse heart disease.
The "reversal program," developed by Dr.
Dean Ornish, director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., is the first non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical heart disease therapy to qualify for reimbursement.


Conservatives Struggle For Something to Say
ON a chilly morning here last January, leading conservatives announced "Empower America," an organization created to begin plotting the resurgence of a Republican Party that seemed in tatters.
Since then, two of the group's leaders and possible Republican Presidential candidates, William J. Bennett and Jack F. Kemp, have articulated strikingly different visions of what their party should stand for.
While Mr.
Bennett preaches about a crisis of values in America, Mr.
Kemp argues that the party's future lies in proposals for economic growth.


It's Alive; How Clinton's Economic Strategy Ended Up Looking Like Bush's
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S plan for reviving the economy, embodied in his budget proposals, is squeaking through Congress.
Even so, the President in one important sense has lost the battle.
Like a general forced to call off a cavalry charge, he has given up his original strategy.
Instead, President Clinton is proclaiming the same hard-nosed economic propositions that George Bush and Ronald Reagan proclaimed as their guiding principle.
The irony is that Mr.
Clinton, like his Republican predecessors, has locked himself into an economic theory that works in the imagination but perhaps not in practice.


Jennifer L. Morgan, Herman L. Bennett
Jennifer Lyle Morgan, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
John P. Morgan of New York, was married yesterday in Sag Harbor, L.I., to Prof.
Herman Lee Bennett, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Lee T. Bennett of Offenbach, Germany.
Judge Kibbie F. Payne, a Civil Court judge in New York, performed the ceremony at the summer home of the bride's parents.
Ms.
Morgan, 27, is keeping her name.
She graduated from Oberlin College and is a doctoral candidate in history at Duke University, from which her husband received a Ph.D. degree in history.
Her father is a professor of pharmacology at the City University of New York Medical School.
Her mother, Claudia B. Morgan, retired as a project director for the Settlement Housing Fund for the City of New York, in Manhattan.


Still Sexy After All These Years
Lauren Hutton, nearly 50, smiles in gap-toothed gorgeousness from the pages of the J. Crew catalogue.
Isabella Rossellini, just over 40 and long the signature face for Lancome cosmetics, must have the most photographed pair of lips in the world.
Catherine Deneuve, the ice maiden of the 60's, has made a comeback with Yves Saint Laurent in Europe.
For the generation that once warned not to trust anyone over 30, suddenly 40 is beautiful.
Or even 50.
Time flies.

Joyce Haber, a Gossip Columnist Known for Barbed Commentaries
Joyce Haber, known for her barbed commentaries as one of the last of Hollywood's powerful gossip columnists and the author of a best-selling book on the movie industry, died on Thursday at a hospital in Los Angeles.
Her age was variously given as 60 or 62.
The cause was kidney and liver failure, said a spokesman for the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.


In the Region: Connecticut; For Fairfield, 2 Multiple-Listing Services
FAIRFIELD COUNTY'S residential real estate industry is watching with interest, concern and considerable confusion as two powerful entities square off in a battle to set up the state's first regional multiple listing service.
One of them, a consortium of four major real estate firms, has the edge over the other, a coalition of 12 Fairfield County real estate boards, plus three others from New Haven and Litchfield Counties, that is just now being formed.


Wall Street; New Shaker in the A.D.R. Business
THEY'RE in the headlines and they're hot.
And like every other fashion rage, they can also cost a bundle.
But fees attached to foreign stocks traded as A.D.R.'s -- American depository receipts -- stand a fair chance of actually coming down in price.
If, that is, a new entrant to the A.D.R. business is able to shake the competition into a little price-cutting.


Laurel Reiman, C. C. Henneman
Laurel Elizabeth Reiman, the daughter of Mary W. Reiman of New York and Donald H. Reiman of Newark, Del., was married yesterday to Charles Clifford Henneman, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
John B. Henneman Jr. of Princeton, N.J.
The Rev.
John O. Mellin, a Presbyterian minister, officiated at the Reformed Church in Bronxville, N.Y.
Ms.
Reiman Henneman, 24, graduated from Wesleyan University, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
She was until recently an associate at J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, the investment bank in New York.
She will attend the New York University Law School in the fall.
Her father is a literary scholar at the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation in Newark, Del., which makes grants to universities and libraries.
Her mother is an executive assistant in New York at Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting firm.


Tug of War Emerging Over the 2000 Games
The city in question is Beijing in the year 2000, but the answer is Berlin 1936.
The history of the modern Olympics is too short and the world is too small to forget murder.
The International Olympic Committee is expected to name the site of the 2000 Games next month.
Sydney, Australia, and Manchester, England, are considered the front-runners, but Beijing is a strong contender, especially among Olympic politicians who want to hook into a powerhouse country of the future.


If You're Thinking of Living in: Roosevelt Island
ROOSEVELT ISLAND is a mix of Sinclair Lewis (its main street, appropriately, is Main Street) and utopia, a middle-class development where once stood a penitentiary, lunatic asylum and other institutions on a two-mile-long, 147-acre East River strip.
Just 300 yards from both Manhattan and Queens, it was planned as a model community, but all is not paradise: Tenants have said they are increasingly unable to absorb rising rents, resulting in rent strikes.
And there are strains on school and community among 8,000 residents of mixed backgrounds and incomes living together.


The People Factor

The report by the American Symphony Orchestra League seems to miss a simple point, which is that people, not only sociologists, attend concerts.

Autopsy Is Attacked in Detroit Beating Trial
In week nine of the trial of three former police officers accused in the beating death of a man last November, defense lawyers attacked the medical examiner's autopsy of the victim for failing to address the role that cocaine might have played in his death.
Three medical experts testified for the defense that the autopsy had been seriously flawed because although the victim, Malice Green, 35, had suffered more than a dozen blows to the head, they alone were not enough to kill him.


Europe's Currency Crisis Presents U.S. With a Hard Choice
While a collapse of the European Monetary System would probably give American exports a boost, Europe's latest currency crisis presents the Clinton Administration with a difficult decision on whether to intervene to help prop up the French franc, monetary experts said today.
A breakdown of the so-called exchange rate mechanism could also eventually unleash inflationary pressures throughout Europe.
And the United States hardly wants to be seen as benefiting from or abetting the troubles of its allies.


A Highbrow Peep Show On 42d Street
Frank Lloyd Wright considered all cities big mouths and New York the biggest mouth of all.
It devoured food, people, ideas, freedom, bellowing its head off between bites.
Gobble, gobble, gobble, demand attention, toot the horn.
This was not a flattering image, of course, so it's not surprising that New York architects haven't done more with it.
Our buildings generally contrive to mask the city's insatiable orifice rather than expose the possibility that we are on the menu.
A decade ago, Philip Johnson uncapped the "lipstick building," a sensuously curved midtown Manhattan tower that could symbolize the stylish gloss architects smooth over the urban cycle of consumption and promotion.
Not that cosmetics aren't something to be grateful for.
If buildings are going to wolf down energy, space, sky and the memory of what preceded them, at least they can have flawless lips.


American Winner and Presidential Ball Upset
A helicopter and 21 years of experience helped John Campbell drive to victories over two superstar horses at two different tracks tonight.
At Yonkers, Campbell drove Life Sign past the overwhelming favorite, Presidential Ball, in the $301,760 Art Rooney Pace, ending Presidential Ball's 10-race winning streak.


Ms. Bullock, Mr. Elfstrom
Katharine Colgate Bullock, a daughter of Mary C. Bullock of Greenwich, Conn., and the late Rufus Bullock, was married yesterday to Bruce Ernst Elfstrom, a son of Robert Elfstrom of San Francisco and the late Barbro Elfstrom.
The Rev.
Dr.
C.
Rex Mix, a Disciples of Christ minister, officiated at Christ Episcopal Church in Greenwich.
Mrs.
Elfstrom graduated from Lynchburg College and received a master's degree in teaching from Simmons College.
In August, she will become a public-school teacher in Las Cruces, N.M.
Her father was the chairman of the Edgewood Management Company, an investment-advisory concern in New York.


July Look: 4 Passers, 48 Plays, 0 Answers
A year ago, the spotlight was beaming down on Browning Nagle, the heir apparent to Ken O'Brien at quarterback for the Jets.
But today, that spotlight was on someone else: Boomer Esiason.
One week away from the Jets' preseason opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Coach Bruce Coslet took a long look at Esiason, Nagle and his two other quarterbacks in a scrimmage against the Washington Redskins.
Washington won, 29-16, largely on the strength of five field goals by Chip Lohmiller.

What's Up in the Old Hotel?
A weekday afternoon, poolside at the Chateau Marmont, a Hollywood hotel in an ersatz Loire Valley chateau.
A crush of several hundred at a birthday party and cookout for Sofia Coppola, daughter of the director.
The guest of honor and her consort, Donovan Leitch, fellow Ford model and son of "the" Donovan, greet their guests.
Never mind that they don't seem to know many of them.
Never mind that it's not her actual birthdate.
After all, this is the land of make-believe.


Branson Brouhaha
To the Editor: Expecting to be in the area, we fell victim recently to the Branson, Mo., brouhaha.
It proved to be a pleasure fraught with frustration.
Branson was formerly a hamlet of 3,800 inhabitants.
Now it is a sprawling monster extending in all directions, awkward and haphazard.
There appears to be no urban plan.
Now there are 52 shows operating, with more on the drawing boards.
Construction is rampant.
The result is a continuous traffic jam day and night.
Highways are inadequate; roads are antiquated.
It is as though the inhabitants awoke one morning to find themselves invaded by aliens.


Two Children And Woman Found Slain
The bodies of a woman and two children who had apparently been taken from their home in the middle of the night and shot to death were found at the edge of the East River yesterday in an isolated, rundown waterfront area near the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Alerted by a dog-walker who called at 8:40 A.M., the police found the bodies at the foot of Jay Street between the navy yard and the Manhattan Bridge -- the woman, 35 to 40 years old, on a trash-cluttered ledge at the water's edge, and a boy 10 to 12 and a girl 5 to 7 floating in the river nearby.


Pops Gives Free Music Lessons
"THE first thing to go in public schools is the arts," says Peter B. Lane, executive director of the New York Pops, referring to the effect of budget cuts.
So the Pops, helped by a $30,000 grant from the Bank of Tokyo Ltd., donated free music lessons during the past school year for 50 New York City students.
Young musicians "are stars on stage in their own schools and their own communities," Mr.
Lane said.


Youth Hanged in Error in '53, Britain Says
The British Government has acknowledged that Derek Bentley, a mentally disabled teen-ager executed 40 years ago for the killing of a police officer, should not have been hanged for the crime, but it stopped short of overturning his conviction.
In granting a posthumous pardon limited to the 19-year-old's death sentence, Home Secretary Michael Howard for the first time acknowledged possible Government wrongdoing in the case, which has generated a long campaign among legal specialists, politicians and Mr.
Bentley's family.

New Game Tests World Knowledge
Travel Buff is a new trivia board game that tests up to six players on their knowledge of the history, culture, people and points of interest of nine popular destinations -- Africa, North America, Asia, Europe, South America, Australia, the Caribbean, Mediterranean and South Pacific.
Each of the 550 question-and-answer cards offers questions at three levels of difficulty.
A sample card from the Mediterranean set: Easy (two points): A traveler on the island of Sardinia would be closest to the island of (a) Corsica (b) Crete (c) Malta.
Intermediate (four points): According to legend the entire population of this Greek island was once completely female.
Advanced (six points): The popular and sumptuous dish in the Greek islands which consists of chopped meat and eggplant mixed with a cheese and tomato paste is called (a) baklava (b) moussaka (c) dolmades (d) arni.

Fifth Graders And Condoms
Alarmed by recent statistics on AIDS and teen-age sex, the New Haven Board of Education last week adopted what is apparently the most far-reaching program for distributing condoms in any school system in the nation.
Under the plan, fifth graders and older students can get condoms from school clinics after being counseled on abstinence and risky sexual behavior.
Nearly all other programs, including New York City's, are limited to high-school students.


'Edward Hopper and the Figure' At the Whitney in Stamford
DURING his lifetime Edward Hopper exhibited at virtually every major museum in the nation.
Yet he remains inextricably bound up with the Whitney Museum of American Art, beginning with his first appearance at its predecessor, the Whitney Studio Club, in 1920, and continuing with the retrospectives of 1920 and 1964.
Since the painter's death in 1967 -- followed by that of his wife less than a year later and then, in 1970, the bequest of his estate to the museum -- there have been more retrospectives, notably "Edward Hopper: Selections From the Permanent Collection," which toured the world from 1989 to 1992.
The artist lives on but, as everyone must know by now, the museum has changed from being a conservative institution to one that attempts to serve two masters: the American Modernist past, in which Hopper has an important place, and, through its now notorious Biennials, the media-saturated present, in which he has none.


Fatal Attraction? Bizet Knew All About It a Century Ago
Here's what you don't want to run into in a love partner, if you're the romantic, soulful type: someone whose allure is so delicious and whose focus on you is so intense that it seems to fulfill every dream, but who can switch it off like a light when problems or boredom set in.
And if you really want to be self-destructive, go fall in love with someone whom you know from the outset to be this way.
If, on the other hand, you're a sensual live-for-the-moment type, here's what you want to avoid: someone who gets fun all mixed up with tortured longings and anxieties, and who gets clingy, or even obsessed, when you're ready to move on.
And if you seduce someone like this who also carries a whiff of potential violence, you're really asking for it.


MY LIFE IN THE MILITARY CLOSET
Jose Zuniga's story and those of thousands of other gay men and lesbians who have served with distinction in the military exposes the lie that homosexuality is incompatible with military service ("My Life in the Military Closet," July 11).
Homosexuality is not the problem.
The problem is the unfounded fear and prejudice of the military leadership and their supporters in Congress.

Working Around Walls In Crooked Rooms
BUILDING a partition wall is usually a fairly easy exercise.
But when the existing walls, floor, ceiling do not meet at right angles the work can become a nightmare.
Here are two wall-building methods that professionals use in crooked rooms.
Before starting measure between both ends of the existing walls that will be parallel to the partition wall to determine whether the existing walls are parallel to each other.
If they are, measure from either of them along the floor at both ends of the room to determine the position of the partition wall.
Mark the position by snapping a chalkline between.


INSIDE
Bosnian Pact Provokes Dissent Among Factions
Despite an accord to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into three federated republics, leaders of the three warring factions are divided about a settlement.
And in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, residents bitterly asserted that not even capitulation at the Geneva talks was likely to bring peace.
Hoping to press the Serbs, President Clinton approved plans for using air strikes to protect Bosnian Muslims.

Haiti Senate Delays Approving New Premier
Even many of those who have taken part in the bombast agree that never before have Haiti's politics so mimicked the bludgeonry of professional wrestling as they have this week in Senate negotiations on ratifying a new Prime Minister.
While the country's gas supply dwindles and a weary population awaits a political settlement that in theory has been complete for weeks, the Haitian Senate fiddles.


Mel Brooks Vs. the Boyz N the Wood
"Spellbound" is one of Hitchcock's most deliciously melodramatic movies -- the one in which Gregory Peck is the amnesiac director of a psychiatric rest home and Ingrid Bergman the doctor who cures him.
But the last time I saw it, the sober film had acquired surprising moments of hilarity.
When the heroine settled down to dinner with her fellow doctors, instead of Ingrid Bergman, Leo G. Carroll and Gregory Peck, all I could see was Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman and Mel Brooks as the staff of the Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very Very Nervous.
This was the effect of having watched Mr.
Brooks's loving Hitchcock parody, "High Anxiety," a few weeks before.
When a movie satire works, the original may never look the same again.
Over the years, no one has spoofed movies better than Mr.
Brooks.
"Blazing Saddles," "Young Frankenstein" and "High Anxiety," his 1970's classics, have spawned a mini-industry of imitators: the goofy "Airplane!" and "Naked Gun" series; the howlingly comic "Hot Shots!" and its current, lesser sequel, "Hot Shots! Part Deux"; the lame, optimistically titled "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1," which came and went quickly last winter.
The best Brooks movies have become so familiar, the clones so plentiful and the audience so jaded that his new film, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights," puts him in the odd position of competing with his own unmatched reputation.


Rare Beauty From a Time Of Horror
There has probably never been as rich a selection of historic recordings as there is today; each month brings unexpected treasures.
But until recently, some of the finest performances of the century could be heard only on odd labels with small distribution.
They were recorded in Nazi-occupied Europe.
Now, in a release of 11 disks (with another 30 or so scheduled), Teldec adds immeasurably to an understanding of the music of that time, which will always stymie attempts to comprehend how such refinement and beauty could have been applauded by such audiences, in such a culture.
These performances, by Wilhelm Furtwangler, Erich Kleiber, Willem Mengelberg, Georg Kulenkampff, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and Eugen Jochum, represent the inverse image of "Entartete Musik," the series London is currently releasing.
Far from being banned by the Nazis as "degenerate," most of these performances would have been choice representations of their artistic prowess; the later recordings had to be official products of the Nazi cultural apparatus.


Not Quite Bubba: A New Challenger To Japan's Status Quo Emerges From the South
From transistors to McDonald's, Japanese have always had a knack of importing American ideas and giving them a Japanese twist.
Here's the latest: turn the country over to a smooth-talking young Governor from the South promising change.
But Morihiro Hosokawa, who spent his days as Governor of Kumamoto lambasting the central Government, was not selected as the head of a new coalition because it loves his ideas about decentralizing an overly powerful bureacracy.
Instead, he was the fastest way to a very practical goal: stitching together enough votes in Parliament to oust the Liberal Democratic Party after nearly 40 years of continuous rule.
An outsider with little central Government experience -- or graft -- to his name, Mr.
Hosokawa, a 55-year-old descendant of one of Japan's most famed shogun families, is almost certain to become the country's first non-Liberal Democratic Prime Minister in 38 years.
His task is papering over differences among coalition members with little in common.

Cutting the Baby in Half
The wisdom of Solomon held that the true, biological mother of a disputed child would rather give it up than have it sliced in half in a custody dispute.
It hasn't quite worked out that way in modern-day America.
On Monday Jessica DeBoer, who is 2 1/2 years old, will be taken from the only home she has ever known.
The people she knows as her mother and father will be replaced with the two strangers who are her biological parents.
Jessica's biological mother gave her up for adoption and named the wrong man as her father.
Then she changed her mind and informed the real father.
Now married to each other, Cara and Daniel Schmidt have fought a two-year legal battle to gain custody of the child they have named Anna.

Dolphins' Offerdahl Might Miss Season
JOHN OFFERDAHL said his arm felt numb, and he looked the same way.
The injury-plagued Miami linebacker suffered a torn left bicep Friday that might require surgery.
Offerdahl was injured during the Dolphins' workout against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
He said he would wait a couple of days until the swelling in his arm goes down before doctors decide whether to operate.
"If it's surgery, it'll probably knock him out for the year," Coach DON SHULA said.
"If it doesn't need surgery, he's probably got a chance to come back and play."


Star Power


Regardless of the Budget, the 103d Is No Gridlock Congress
TUESDAY the House stopped fighting about flood relief and passed a $3 billion measure, raised to $4.7 billion in a Senate committee Friday.
Thursday House and Senate conferees broke their deadlock on how to put the Government into the student loan business.
Friday Senate Republicans gave up their filibuster against the national service bill, which the House had passed Wednesday.
This legislative barrage was conducted while other sets of negotiators fought over the tax increases and spending cuts in the budget-reconciliation bill, the crucial test for the first part of this Congressional session.
None of those other successes made the budget measure any easier.
It will still take every bit of muscle and arm-twisting the White House and Democratic leaders can muster to pass the half-trillion-dollar deficit reduction before Congress leaves for vacation next weekend.


With Supply and Purity Up, Heroin Use Expands
Even with her striking beauty, hardly anyone seemed to notice the young model as she glided through the swarm of heroin dealers and glassy-eyed addicts on a patch of steamy pavement in East Harlem.
This was not her crowd, but they had what she needed and she would endure what she had to to get her drug.
She was one of the new ones, drawn to a high grade of heroin that does not need to be pumped into the body with a hypodermic needle but can be inhaled like cocaine without the slightest damage to a finely turned nose, at least in the beginning.


Chamber Recitals Wind Down Norfolk Season
THE Norfolk Chamber Music Festival is drawing to a close with a pair of free student recitals -- 7:30 P.M. tomorrow and at that same hour on Thursday -- paving the way for the two final faculty evenings.

Homemade Ice Cream, Fresh Fruit Taste
WITH berries, peaches and plums -- and the weather -- all at their peak, it is the perfect time for making ice cream.
I often buy too much fruit because it looks so good at the farm stand, and I usually end up making it into ice cream before it turns bad.
The other day, after spending an afternoon picking raspberries at a local farm, my 5-year-old son tripped and scattered the contents of his baskets all over the ground.
He was dismayed until I told him we would rinse off the berries and use them to make ice cream.


For Many Bosnians, Peace Accord Brings No Joy
Late this afternoon, one of the most powerful men in the Bosnian Government was slumped in a wingback chair in his office, gaunt and exhausted, listening disconsolately to a transistor radio report of what was initially hailed as a major step toward ending the Bosnian war.
"I'm very depressed," the official said.


On the Rhine, Commerce and Romance
A CRUISE on the Rhine is, literally, a power trip -- past the German and French industrial might evident along the river banks; the commercial and trading power of the scores of huge barges, many of them Dutch, that throb ceaselessly through the immense current, and powerful landscapes like the 440-foot rock cliffs of the Loreley on the most scenic stretch of the Rhine between Mainz and Koblenz.
Dutch, German and Swiss companies all operate comfortable cruise ships that ply the waters on various itineraries between Amsterdam and Basel, but we took the Deutschland, a 22-year-old, 361-foot-long cruise ship of the German Koln-Dusseldorfer Line, which has been running the Rhine since 1826.
The trip we chose was a two-night journey between Strasbourg and Cologne over what promised to be a beautiful May weekend.


One Batter Gets Hit and Then Decides to Charge the Messenger
When Bob Patterson, a Texas relief pitcher, hit Brian McRae on the hip with a retaliatory pitch the other night, the son of the Kansas City Royals' manager did not charge the mound.
Instead, he charged the dugout, taking that unusual route trying to get to Kevin Kennedy, the Rangers' manager.
"Brian McRae did exactly what he should have done," Sparky Anderson, the Detroit Tigers' veteran manager, said the next night, discussing retaliatory pitches and the fights that ensue.
"There was a statement made that they were going to get somebody. If I made a statement that we're going to get Joe Carter, I would expect him to come after me. That's why you never make a statement that you're going to get somebody." A Promise
Last Wednesday night, Rick Reed of the Royals hit Rafael Palmeiro after Palmeiro hit his second and third home runs in two games against the Royals.
"We'll take care of it tomorrow night," Kennedy said afterward.

Heat-Struck Nursing Home Reopens
THE evacuation of 250 frail elderly residents of a nursing home here last month because of dangerously high temperatures has prompted city officials to take a closer look at such homes to make sure they are operated safely.
"Considering the magnitude of what happened here, that so many lives were endangered, the city felt that it needed to get a second look on nursing care conditions to avert this sort of thing from ever happening again," said Daniel Gibson, an administrative aide to Cardell Cooper, the East Orange Mayor.

COLLECT CALLS TO CONSUMERS?
AS Ameritech sees it, cellular telephone customers are saying one thing loud and clear: Makers of digital phone equipment are placing a collect call from the future, and consumers aren't yet ready to pay the price.
Ameritech, the regional Bell telephone company in the Midwest that is also a major provider of cellular phone services, said recently that it would defer any plans to offer digital technology to its cellular customers.
The company said that tests earlier this summer showed that customers preferred its older analog cellular system to the new digital service offered here by Cellular One.


Miss Raymond And Mr. Ross

She received an M.B.A. from Emory University.
Her father is the vice president and the head wine maker at the Raymond Vineyard and Cellar in St.
Helena.


How's the Soil? Just Look at the Weeds
WEEDS have a way of letting gardeners know what is under the ground.
Although the Northeast's recent hot weather, high humidity dry soil caused many of these unwanted plants to wilt, weeds are natural soil indicators, just by growing where they do.
Wise are those gardeners who heed what nature is telling them.
Weeds should never be considered as a substitute for a good pH test analysis if a major gardening project is to be undertaken.
But where there seems to be a trouble spot, look to the weeds for possible answers.


More Neighborhoods Await the Results of Water Testing
As city officials awaited test results to determine whether three neighborhoods -- Chelsea in Manhattan, East Tremont in the Bronx and Tottenville on Staten Island -- might have contaminated drinking water, a battery of tests throughout southern Manhattan showed that the problem is not systemwide, the officials said yesterday.
A spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, John Melia, said water samples were taken at 58 places south of 34th Street during the last three days.
"And all those tests came back clean," Mr.
Melia said, "so we know it's not a systemic problem."


Former Soviet Players Dominate the Open
THE 1993 National Open Championship, held June 11 to 13 in Las Vegas, Nev., ended in a tie among the grandmasters Gata Kamsky of Brooklyn, Sergey Kudrin of Stamford, Conn., Alex Yermolinsky of Highland Park, N.J., and Maxim Dlugy of Englewood, N.J.
The four former Soviet citizens scored 5 1/2- 1/2 to win $2,500 each in the 300-player, Swiss-system tournament.
The Round 5 game between Kamsky and Walter Browne, a six-time United States champion from Berkeley, Calif., illustrated the fighting quality of the encounters.

Why The Carping Continues
The jazz at Lincoln Center series opens its third season on Tuesday amid the same criticism that has trailed it since its inception.
Critics complain that the series lacks breadth and emphasizes some parts of jazz history at the expense of others.
They also say the programs are insular, with the artistic director, Wynton Marsalis, and some of his current and former band members regularly receiving commissions (Mr. Marsalis has gotten one every year) and performing in more than their fair share of the concerts.
Inclusion also means exclusion, and virtually every member of the jazz community has ideas about who should be represented but isn't.
There is truth to most of the criticism, and in general the program has been guilty of an astounding clumsiness when it comes to the appearance of impropriety.
The series has not once featured a white composer, opening itself up to charges of racism.
In May its director, Rob Gibson, fired members of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra because they were over 30, only to rescind the dismissals after being apprised of the illegality of the move.
The series has also ignored the jazz avant-garde of the 1960's and 1970's.
And the regular appearances by Mr.
Marsalis's band seem like the work of a patronage system.


Rescuing Children From Boredom
AS A YOUNGSTER in Modesto, Calif., George Lucas detested school.
"Up through high school I was bored silly," he recalled.
"I didn't seem to fit into the educational system as it was functioning. Then when I got to college and had more freedom and more control over my life I suddenly enjoyed it enormously. The contrast between my early education and my later education was so dramatic that I was constantly pondering, 'Why did it have to be that way?' Why was I robbed?" Mr.
Lucas, the film maker, creator of the "Star Wars" saga, has the money and clout, and perhaps the vision, to find some answers.  'I Was Robbed'
"My primal motivating factor is I feel I was robbed of a lot of great educational opportunities; I could have learned a lot more," he said, sitting in the dining room of his workplace, the lavishly idyllic Skywalker Ranch, home of the LucasArts Entertainment Company, in the hills of Marin County just north of San Francisco.
"The only adaptation mechanism that we have as an animal or species is our brain. If we don't use it wisely, we don't survive.

Classwork Vs. Tests as A Measure
LAST Sept. 12 Joseph McCracken's teacher told her third-grade class to write as much as they could about what they had done that week.
Joseph wrote one sentence: "Two days ago we had a spilling tet." When given a similar assignment this June 9, however, Joseph wrote a two-page essay.
It said in part: "Now let's talk about spelling. My first spelling test I was nervous. But when I got the hang of it I got perfect scores for four straight weeks."
His teacher, Joe Ann Allen, compared these as well as other samples of Joseph's work that she had compiled over the school year.
"There was a dramatic change in Joseph's ability to express his ideas through writing," she said.
"As a teacher, when you pass papers back it is not as easy to see growth, like an improvement in spelling, as it is when you have the work in front of you."

Cruising the St. Lawrence, Era by Era
THE voyage of the Canadian Empress from Montreal to Kingston, Ontario, began with a U-turn.
I boarded the ship, along with 42 other passengers, in the bustling Old Port of Montreal, where 19th-century stone warehouses have become condominiums and shops, and abandoned piers now house a flea market, an IMAX theater and special exhibitions.
The white triple-decked copy of a Great Lakes steamship eased out of her slip and headed toward the Atlantic Ocean.
She crossed under the Jacques Cartier Bridge and turned 180 degrees to briefly challenge the current of the St.
Lawrence River before finding the safety of the canal along the south shore.
The 351-year-old city's best-known landmarks passed by in a backward chronological order: Olympic Stadium, the decrepit Expo '67 site, the massive lighted cross on Mount Royal and the huge shining dome of St.
Joseph's Oratory.
The Canadian Empress is sold as a floating history lesson whose journey along the St.
Lawrence will unravel "the real Canada, the original Canada." Over the course of four nights and five days, we were inundated with the lore of the river.
There are five shore trips to museums, a fort and a pioneer village, and every few hours taped announcements broadcast over the public address system provide well-researched vignettes about passing landmarks.


Neighbor's Keeper


No Hair Spray, No Spangles
Mary-Chapin Carpenter loves the mall.
It makes her feel beautifully anonymous.
Walking beneath plastic faux cathedral ceilings, drowned in lighting as bright as a flashbulb pop, she leaves at bay, for a few hours, her career as a country singer-songwriter and becomes just another neurotic shopper looking for a bargain.
"There's something oddly therapeutic about it," she says.
"When you've had a hard week, and you want to be by yourself but you want some outside stimulation or surrealness, take yourself to the mall. You can fog out and just look in the windows."
On a Friday afternoon after a band rehearsal for a tour that starts in a few days, Carpenter drives her Toyota Land Cruiser to the Tysons Corner mall in the suburbs of Washington, not far from her home in Old Town Alexandria, Va.
Right now Carpenter is one of the top-selling stars in country music.
Her 1992 album "Come On Come On," a crisp, jangly blend of pop, folk and country influences, has been certified platinum, for sales of one million copies; her previous effort, "Shooting Straight in the Dark," released in 1990, has been certified gold (sales of 500,000).
In February, she won her second Grammy Award, for Country Vocalist, Female.
And Carpenter has been on tour practically nonstop since the release of "Come On Come On" about a year ago, playing to sold-out audiences both here and in Europe.


Lawyers Unsure of Effects of Paring Altman Charges
As the criminal trial of Robert A. Altman enters its final, critical phase this week, lawyers familiar with the case are divided over how to interpret the significance of a decision by a New York State Supreme Court judge to dismiss half the charges against Mr.
Altman.
Some say the ruling weakened, if not gutted, the Government's case.
The decision was made on Thursday by Judge John A. K. Bradley, who threw out four charges, including an important bribery count.


Conversations: Ofra Bikel; The Patience and Passion Of a Documentary Film Maker
OFRA BIKEL is listening, but there is nothing passive about her.
She asks a simple question and then she stops and waits and wills you to speak.
She can wait a very long time.
And it is what tumbles into those silences that has won Ms.
Bikel her reputation and shelves full of awards as a documentary film maker.
As they face those silences, people who have no reason to reveal themselves begin to tell her what she wants to know.
They are people like the three jurors in her recent four-hour documentary about a North Carolina child sexual abuse case, who tell her why they voted to convict a man they believed to be innocent.
And from other projects: a Japanese businessman reveals, to himself as much as to her, that he lives a life devoid of dreams.

Life on the Road: A Parent's View
To the Editor:
My attention was grabbed immediately when I saw the headline and photos for Neal Karlen's "Lollapalooza Love Story" (July 11).
I felt insulted and disgusted not only that two very young people were testing their relationship in an unnatural way, but that their traveling around the country with this group of people was romanticized.
I had a very different experience.


Corrections
An article on July 11 about exploring London with children misstated the address of the Sherlock Holmes Museum and referred incorrectly to the building's involvement with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
The museum is at 239 Baker Street; the plaque by the door, however, bears the number 221B, the creation of Doyle for his character, Sherlock Holmes.
Doyle himself lived in the north of England and Scotland; he is not known to have stayed on Baker Street.


Reluctant Giant: Germany Balks at Leading Europeans to Unity
Germany's shoulders, it turns out, are not as broad as either the Germans or their neighbors thought they were.
Ever since the unification of Germany in 1990, supporters of European unity, Germans most of all, have been telling themselves that Germany would lead the way.
Built on the idea of Franco-German reconciliation, this unified Europe would forge a strategic and economic partnership with the United States, with the powerful German economy pulling the rest of Europe to prosperity.

The monthlong expedition, which left Copenhagen on Thursday aboard a Russian research ship, is the first big East-West effort to examine the submarine Komsomolets, which sank 300 miles off the coast of Norway in 1989.

They're Hot! (They're Not!)
This story is not about Arnold Schwarzenegger, Madonna, Roseanne or Tom Arnold, Shannen Doherty, Sharon Stone or anyone who could be described as a "supermodel." If it were, you would have stopped reading by now and screamed, "No! Not another story about them!" You would have turned the page in disgust.
Some celebrities have become so ubiquitous, so annoyingly overhyped, that you can't stand to read, hear or speak another word about them.
They are, in a word, overexposed.
Leave the camera lens open too long and the image becomes a blinding blur.
This doesn't happen to every celebrity, just those who show up on three magazine covers in the same month, attend one too many klieg-lit movie premieres, and whose all-too-familiar faces turn up on everything from Burger King drink cups to the National Enquirer.
This story isn't about them.
It's about how they got to be them and the perils of being sucked into the publicity machine.


A Health Fair -- It's Worth a Shot


CONNECTICUT GUIDE
LET THE GAMES BEGIN
Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts all-star baseball players from 18 to 21 years of age are scheduled to play against the Cuban Junior National Team and the Russian Junior National Team at the Municipal Stadium in Waterbury.
In two series titled the International Friendship Games, the Cubans will defend their World Champion status from Wednesday through Sunday, while the Russians, who are national champions at home, will take on the Americans from Aug. 17 through 21.


Miss Williams And Mr. Clark
Elizabeth Anne Williams, a daughter of Herbert and Gail Williams of Belle Mead, N.J., was married yesterday to Timothy James Clark, a son of James and Patricia Clark of Cortland, N.Y.
The Rev.
John Morrison, a United Methodist minister, performed the ceremony at the Edith Memorial Chapel of the Lawrenceville (N.J.) School.
Mrs.
Clark, 32, was until recently an administrator at Schafer Capital Management Inc., an investment advisory company in New York.
She graduated from Goucher College.
Her father is a consultant on office equipment.
Her mother is a saleswoman at Peyton Associates, a real estate brokerage in Princeton, N.J.


Many Flavors of Florida's Panhandle
THE license plates are mostly from Georgia, Texas, Alabama and Tennessee.
The bumper stickers and T-shirts advertise ritzy Atlanta private schools, the epochal football season of the Alabama Crimson Tide and country music heartthrobs like Travis Tritt and Garth Brooks.
The flawless beaches and emerald surf around Destin, Fla., may be to many Southerners what the Jersey Shore and the Hamptons are around New York, but it's probably time to retire the term "Redneck Riviera." Almost unnoticed by most non-Southerners, the heart of the Florida Panhandle has developed into one of the most inviting and affordable beach and coastal areas in the country.
And from the overgrown fishing village turned condo alley at Destin to the unpretentious small-town eccentricities of Grayton Beach to the pastel dreamworld of Seaside, it's now as diverse and contradictory as the South itself.
The main reason for the appeal is not hard to figure out.
The beaches are deep, clean and sugar white, and the Gulf surf is a startling blend of emerald, turquoise and aquamarine, blending finally into a deep blue about 100 yards out to sea.
About 60 percent of the 24 miles of beaches around Fort Walton and Destin have been protected against any development by state or federal governments.


Shock Therapy Still Causes Brain Damage
To the Editor:
Re "With Reforms in Treatment, Shock Therapy Loses Shock" (front page, July 19): Electroconvulsive therapy's promoters notwithstanding, it is no panacea for depression.
There is a longstanding and heated controversy within the medical profession and among the public over the effectiveness and safety of shock therapy, which you largely ignore.

Europeans Meet on Currency Crisis
Senior central bank and finance ministry officials from the European Community countries gathered here today to discuss how to save the European Monetary System, once seen as the foundation for a single currency later in the decade, from collapse.
Their chiefs, the finance ministers and heads of central banks, will meet Sunday to decide what steps to take.


C.I.A. Says Chinese Economy Rivals Japan's
The Central Intelligence Agency says China's economy is bubbling -- indeed, close to overheating -- with a gross domestic product of $2.35 trillion, matching Japan's and growing at 13 percent a year.
In an annual report to Congress presented today, Martin Petersen, the C.I.A.'s top East Asia analyst, said reforms instituted over the last 14 years have sharply improved living standards in China, and allowed free domestic markets to flourish.
They have created "a modern economic power," the third-largest economy in the world, after those of the United States and Japan.


Men, Men, Men . . . And a Boy
In keeping with fashion's haywire calendar, Seventh Avenue's men's-wear designers presented their spring and summer 1994 collections last week.
While the number of shows was few, too few in fact for many European models to be enticed to cross the Atlantic, the week did have its moments.


Foster Puts Up a Hurdle To His Retirement Plans
Tonight was supposed to have been Greg Foster's grand farewell to United States track and field.
The 34-year-old three-time outdoor world champion in the 110-meter high hurdles announced his retirement in January and selected the Olympic Festival as his signature exit.
Instead of a stunning triumphant finale, Foster, reacting to the gun late, knocked over three successive hurdles and finally stopped before the eighth bank and failed to finish the race.


The Mystery Filly Impresses but Loses
Well, they found out one thing on the first weekend of the new Saratoga season: Miss Indy Anna, the unbeaten but unknown filly, can run in the big leagues.
They also found out that she can be beaten, although it took a mighty drive through the homestretch by Missed the Storm to do it today.

Technology; A Better Way for the Wireless Caller?
AFTER more than 18 months of technical debate, manufacturers in the cellular telephone industry have endorsed a new method of carrying wireless phone calls that uses advanced digital technology.
Trouble is, a significant portion of the industry is resistant to actually adopting the technology any time soon.
The new technique, called code division multiple access, or C.D.M.A., could lead to a nearly 20-fold expansion of available radio channels, especially in large cities where network congestion can cut off cellular conversations in mid-sentence.
Cellular carriers could thus accommodate millions of new customers and improve service for current users without going to the Federal Communications Commission for the lengthy process of obtaining additional radio-frequency bands.

A Director's Trip From Salad Days To a 'Banquet'
With every graduating class from New York University's film school, one young director seems to get the most invitations from Hollywood.
In 1984, that person was Ang Lee, whose comedy "The Wedding Banquet" -- about a Taiwanese homosexual, his American lover and a hasty marriage -- opens on Wednesday.
The buzz had begun with his 45-minute thesis film, "Fine Line," which earned him an agent at William Morris.
But as any N.Y.U. film school graduate knows, being the flavor-of-the-month is a title of ambiguous worth, usually consigning its bearer to what is commonly referred to as development hell, wherein a young director does lunch and takes meetings with studio suits ad infinitum.


'The Art of Arousal'
To the Editor:
I wish to congratulate you on selecting Susie Bright (a pseudonym?) to review "The Art of Arousal," by Ruth Westheimer (July 11).


Assault the Bourgeois
To the Editor:
I am writing in response to two reviews that appeared opposite each other on June 20.
The one about David Halberstam's book "The Fifties" recalls that decade's racism, sexism, conformist Levittown culture, McCarthyism and other follies.
The second review, of Katherine S. Newman's "Declining Fortunes," warns that baby boomers cannot hope to emulate "the ordered suburban existence" of their middle-class parents.


Not Major League
To the Sports Editor:
One does not have to be genius to discern the core of the Mets' problem: pitching.
Young, Schourek, Maddux and Innis now cannot pitch on the major league level.
Whether they will do so in the future is beside the point.
Their combined record at last glance was 2-28.
These fellows should have been released or sent down to the minors a long time ago.
STEPHEN C. LERNER Teaneck, N.J.


Putting Dances in a Safe Place
There are times when academic matters seem far from stuffy.
Consider the New York City Ballet's recent Balanchine Celebration.
The festival made it possible for 73 works by George Balanchine to be presented during the course of eight weeks.
But what is to become of them?
Balanchine's choreography must be preserved, balletomanes insist.
No one disputes that.
The hard question is: How?
Although some of the productions will remain in the City Ballet's repertory, all 73 can't be danced every season just to prevent them from being forgotten.


NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: West Philadelphia; Strapped Buyer Seeks Auction
AFTER seeking financing for nearly two years, a community group has reached a watershed in its effort to buy a 12-story office building on 22 acres in West Philadelphia that is now under the control of the United States Bankruptcy Court.
The nonprofit group, the Urban Education Development Research and Retreat Center Inc., has asked that the property, the former headquarters of Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company, be auctioned if it cannot complete the $1.7 million purchase by Aug. 15.
The center, which was set up by local activists, legislators and others anxious to keep the building from foreclosure, has been working to obtain an estimated $5 million to buy and renovate it.

Search Warrant for Mustaf Home Sealed
The murder investigation warrant under which the police searched the home of Phoenix Suns reserve forward JERROD MUSTAF has been sealed by court order.
Police searched Mustaf's house in Chandler, Ariz., last Sunday, one day after the body of ALTHEA HAYES, a 27-year-old pregnant woman he reportedly had been dating, was found dead in her Glendale, Ariz., apartment.
Mustaf, 23, was questioned by telephone by the Glendale police yesterday after he arrived at National Airport near Washington.
MICHAEL STATHAM, Mustaf's Maryland-based agent and attorney, said his client "continues to steadfastly deny any involvement."


Regina Cosnowsky, Bruce L. Carvalho
Regina Sydney Cosnowsky, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Monty Cosnowsky of New York, was married yesterday to Bruce Lawrence Carvalho, the son of Dr. and Mrs.
Richard S. Carvalho of Peterborough, N.H.
The Rev.
Richard Stower, a Unitarian Universalist minister, officiated at Glen Magna Farms in Danvers, Mass.
Ms.
Cosnowsky, who is keeping her name, graduated from Bryn Mawr College and received a master's degree in education from Harvard University.
She is a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology at Temple University.
Her father, now retired, was a vice president and associate research director at D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, the advertising agency in New York.
Her mother, Doris Cosnowsky, retired as the director of admissions at the Fleming School in New York.

No Change Since Mahler
To the Editor:
Edward Rothstein's position on American orchestras reflects attitudes long held by our art institutions.
Most of our orchestras continue to act as though only Europe produced musical genius.
No, they need not present, as Mr.
Rothstein suggests, "throat singers from Tulva" or play music by black composers once a year as an act of noblesse oblige.


Baudouin I, King of Belgium, Dies at 62
Baudouin I, the King of Belgium for 42 years and one of the more reclusive of Europe's dwindling monarchs, died yesterday while vacationing in Motril, a town in the province of Granada in southern Spain.
He was 62.
A spokesman for the Spanish Government attributed the death to a heart attack.
The king had been in ill health for two years, having undergone prostate surgery in 1991 and an open-heart operation last year.
Baudouin was the fifth king of the Belgians.

Filming on a Shoestring, a Director Takes to the Streets
A YOUNG BOY, TRYING TO look cool under a melting afternoon sun, is sitting on an abandoned automobile on Driggs Avenue in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
He watches cars pass, waiting for a customer to buy drugs.
At the word "Cut!" a woman rushes from behind the camera to hold an oversized umbrella over the boy so he doesn't wilt.
Boaz Yakin, the writer-director, is visibly moist from the heat and wondering how much longer he will have the use of his 13-year-old star (child labor laws stipulate a nine-hour day).
But, he says, "I'm just glad preproduction's over."
On this 100-degree July day, a movie called "Fresh" has begun shooting in Brooklyn.
And for a low-budget film to be shot in New York, ingenuity must substitute for cash, particularly during preproduction.
A dogged negotiation style (to wring the best deals from the city's unions) is as critical as savvy location scouting and creative casting strategies.


A Bookcase Created By an Ensemble
While the American masters of 1950's furniture design were industrially inspired, the French tended to be decorative.
Yet there is a connection between Charles Eames's mass-produced storage units designed in 1951, and this one-of-a-kind French piece made in 1953.
The room divider and bookcase is by Charlotte Perriand, who designed the oak shelves, and Sonia Delaunay, who chose the bright colors.
Jean Prouve contributed the aluminum dividers.
It is $24,500 at 1950.


Heifer Hazard
To the Editor: Your articles about Ireland's County Mayo (June 20) brought back fond memories of our family trip there in 1990.
One of our favorite towns was Belmullet, where we stayed at the B &amp; B of Mrs.
Maguire-Murphy.
The three men in our group will never forget their golf experience on the Belmullet golf course, where my husband's first drive hit the hindquarters of a large cow. (The cows had not yet been driven from the course.) The greens are protected from bovine munching by wire fences and the official rules of the course explain how one is required to play the fences.
We will not soon forget the gorgeous scenery of the North Atlantic and the cow dung and gopher hole hazards.


Theirs Was a Blissful Marriage Of Innovative Form and Finish
On March 11, 1938, the good news came in the morning mail to the Vienna studio of Gertrud Amon and Otto Natzler: Their ceramics had won a silver medal at the Paris International Exposition.
But that night, joy gave way to horror as Hitler's troops marched into the city, abruptly and irrevocably changing their lives.
"We knew we must flee," Mr.
Natzler said in a recent interview, following the opening of "Gertrud and Otto Natzler: Collaboration/ Solitude," an exhibition at the American Craft Museum.
After a Kafkaesque five months of dealing with Nazi authorities to obtain passports, visas and their marriage license, the newlyweds left by train for Trieste.
They then sailed by Italian freighter to Los Angeles, the home of one of Mr.
Natzler's cousins, and by December their belongings -- a kiln, a potter's wheel, 20 kilos of uranium oxide for glazes and a crate of ceramics -- had finally arrived.


3 Indian Tribes Stir Casino Fears
RECENT actions by three groups of American Indians that could ultimately lead to the establishment of Indian-owned casinos in New Jersey are drawing harsh criticism from local officials and representatives of the state's 15-year-old casino industry and mixed reactions from the state's Congressional delegation.
In northern Bergen County, a group known as the Ramapough Mountain Indians has applied to the Federal Government for official recognition as an Indian tribe.
Its members have said that if their request is granted they will buy land in the area and ask that it be placed in trust as a Federal Indian reservation.


Roller Hockey Glides Into Sports Arenas
WHEN T. J. Schatz went to the offices of the Connecticut Coasters last month, his hope was to sell T-shirts to the new roller hockey club at the New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
A fledgling entrepreneur, Mr.
Schatz runs a screen-printing company in Milford and he foresaw a market in the Connecticut Coasters and their fans.
A month later, Mr.
Schatz, who is 24 years old and lives in East Haven, found himself not selling T-shirts to the Coasters but scoring the team's first-ever goal in their opening game against the Florida Hammerheads.
He went on to score two more goals and three assists as the Coasters beat the Hammerheads, 10-9, in a Roller Hockey International game.


New York Politics: Polls Show Mayor Unscathed by Riot Report
While New York Mayor David N. Dinkins may have underestimated the severity of racial violence in Brooklyn during four days of unrest in August 1991, local politicians and pundits may have seriously overestimated the impact of the Mayor's mistakes on his political future.
Mr.
Dinkins, a Democrat who is being challenged in his bid for a second term by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, was widely thought to have suffered major political damage two weeks ago when a state report harshly criticized his handling of the disturbances in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.


CASTLES IN THE SAND
Fire Island is a magical place where anything can happen.
I met my husband in a "share" house, in Ocean Bay Park, almost three years ago and have returned every year since then.
It is very sad for us to watch nature's destruction of our island.

White House Nearing a Key Decision on Paper Recycling
Environmental groups and the paper industry are battling over a proposed Presidential order intended to promote recycling by committing the Government to buying printing and writing paper made with more recycled material.
Those close to the fray say a decision on the proposal is imminent.
Kathleen McGinty, director of the White House Office of Environmental Policy, which will make the recommendation to President Clinton on what order to issue, said an announcement could come in about three weeks.


Two for the Money, but Loopholes
The struggle to curb the enormous costs of an America's Cup campaign has absorbed challengers and defenders for the last year, uniting the usually dissonant groups in a common cause.
But loopholes still remain in the rules that have been established to contain costs, and these gaps are almost certain to bring discord when the cup trial racing gets under way in January 1995.


Belly Dancing Is Out!
CALL IT the curriculum of ambition.
In its serious incarnation at schools for continuing education, it is "Introduction to Parallel Computing." In its not-so-serious incarnation, it is "How to Make Money Selling at Fairs, Festivals &amp; Flea Markets."
Throughout the economic slowdown, with its large number of white-collar professionals newly unemployed or fearful of layoffs, enrollment in continuing education courses has continued to inch up.


Susan Kane, Eric Doelger
Susan Kane, the executive editor of New Woman magazine in New York, was married yesterday to Eric James Doelger, a senior account executive at Ringier America, a printing company in New York.
Walter Lawton, the leader of the Ethical Culture Society of Queens, officiated at the Lotos Club in New York.
Ms.
Kane, 39, is keeping her name.
She graduated magna cum laude from Vassar College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
She is a co-author of "Unnecessary Choices: The Hidden Life of the Executive Woman" (Morrow, 1987).


How's the Soil? Just Look at the Weeds
WEEDS have a way of letting gardeners know what is under the ground.
Although the Northeast's recent hot weather, high humidity dry soil caused many of these unwanted plants to wilt, weeds are natural soil indicators, just by growing where they do.
Wise are those gardeners who heed what nature is telling them.
Weeds should never be considered as a substitute for a good pH test analysis if a major gardening project is to be undertaken.
But where there seems to be a trouble spot, look to the weeds for possible answers.


A Touch of 19th-Century Americana
ROUTE 32 is an old road that twists northward in eastern Connecticut and motorists, particularly in summer when the foliage is heavy, are likely to miss a sign tucked into the trees at a side road south of Willimantic.
Occasionally, however, someone will notice the sign, be intrigued by it, and turn into the road, to discover a place that appears to be rooted forever in the 19th century.
At the spot, under huge shade trees, are little wooden houses, perched this way and that around a circular road that had been made just wide enough to accommodate horses and buggies going one way.
Nearly all of the houses have front porches, for sitting and talking on a warm summer evening.
There is also a preacher's stand for outdoor religious services, a dining hall, a chapel, a library.


Churches Face Ravages of Age And Neglect
THREE years ago at St.
Columba's Roman Catholic Church, a fixture in Newark's South Ward for close to a century, the congregation was dismayed when water started running down the inside walls on rainy Sundays.
When the leaks were investigated, the parishioners discovered that the building needed extensive roof repairs and interior restoration work.
Now, after the completion of more than $200,000 in repairs, St.
Columba's is watertight once more.

Homemade Ice Cream, Fresh Fruit Taste
WITH berries, peaches and plums -- and the weather -- all at their peak, it is the perfect time for making ice cream.
I often buy too much fruit because it looks so good at the farm stand, and I usually end up making it into ice cream before it turns bad.
The other day, after spending an afternoon picking raspberries at a local farm, my 5-year-old son tripped and scattered the contents of his baskets all over the ground.
He was dismayed until I told him we would rinse off the berries and use them to make ice cream.


Moscow's Cultural Shutdown
Like the Russian economy and most of its political institutions, many of Moscow's cultural landmarks are under repair.
The main building of the Tretyakov Gallery (closed for seven years) and Arkhangelskoye estate park (shut for more than three years) are still inaccessible, as are many of Moscow's churches.
And a few months ago, in response to complaints of crime and unsanitary conditions, the Arbat's artists, street vendors and musicians were asked to vacate the bustling district for a spring cleaning that promises to go on indefinitely.
Remonts, Russian for repairs, have become ubiquitous as the city of Moscow and the Russian Government give Moscow's worn exterior a facelift.


Mets End Their Day As Two-Time Losers
The digits on the scoreboard clock at Busch Stadium at last read 11:00.
Those numbers were far more depressing than the Cardinals 4, Mets 3 that would be flashed there at the conclusion of tonight's game.
The trading deadline was upon the Mets, and there was no announcement on the agenda.
It marked one more failure for a fabulously futile 1993, and it amounted to a setback of no minor consequence.
The Mets, after all, had long sworn themselves to the project of reconstruction, and the club's top executives had told New York fans to underline July 31 on their calendars.


How Congress Juggles With Tax Laws
To the Editor:
Shirley D. Peterson, Commissioner of Internal Revenue in 1992-93, chooses a worthy target in the changes proposed for Federal estate tax law (Op-Ed, July 24).
But her argument may mislead some.


Ms. Fitzsimmons, Mr. Kirkpatrick
Barbara Ann Fitzsimmons, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Roger J. Fitzsimmons of Little Silver, N.J., was married yesterday to David William Kirkpatrick, a son of Judge and Mrs.
William P. Kirkpatrick of Rumson, N.J.
Msgr.
Richard Behl officiated at the Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in Rumson.
The Rev.
Foster C. Wilson, a Presbyterian minister, took part in the ceremony.
Mrs.
Kirkpatrick, 33, is the art director of Morrow Junior Books, a division of William Morrow &amp; Company in New York.
Her father is a vice president in Red Bank, N.J., of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, the securities brokerage.
Her mother, Patricia A. Fitzsimmons, retired from the Little Silver school system as a speech and language therapist.


Learning the 'Weird' Music
LUCY LEWIS didn't have to put on regulation-issue shorts or sneakers for her fifth-period gym class.
She didn't have to meander through a steamy locker room or do warm-up calisthenics or try for a record-setting 50-yard dash.
Just a short ride in a tiny elevator, then an hour of pulling on a rope that dangled from the ceiling.
A good way to develop upper body strength?
Maybe, but that was not the point.
This was a bell-ringing class in a tower 100 feet above the Washington National Cathedral.
And it was no gut course.
"It's one of the hardest classes I take," said a classmate, Meri Gots.


The Trouble With Drug Testing
To the Editor:
For the bulk of workers in office settings, random drug testing is a serious invasion of privacy, an expensive and ineffective management tool and an inappropriate way to diagnose and prevent substance abuse.


Classic French, and Still at the Top
IT is time for food lovers to sing an enthusiastic happy 10th birthday to Mirabelle.
A decade ago, the small French restaurant in an unobtrusive converted house on Route 25A in St.
James skyrocketed in popularity and is still there.
On a recent visit, comments by first-timers were telling.
On entering the dining room, one asked, "Is there another room?" Another added, "It's not what I expected."


Tongue Tided
No one cares about fussy things like 'like' any more," my friend in advertising exclaimed, a bit touchy. I had challenged the grammar of a line she had written for a client: "Nobody knows, like Domino's, how you like pizza at home."
"Of course people care," I insisted, remembering how purists boiled up in anger over the aggressively colloquial 1954 commercial declaring that "Winston Tastes Good, Like a Cigarette should." But that was a generation of purists ago.
My friend in advertising turned out to be right about modern language.
The Domino's ad appeared on national television hundreds of times last winter and elicited no outrage, no controversy, not one complaint.


Tommy Lee Jones Snarls His Way to the Pinnacle
At precisely 9 A.M., Tommy Lee Jones strides quickly into the lobby of La Mansion del Rio Hotel and impatiently enters a suite set up for breakfast.
Except for the dark wraparound glasses, the actor could be just another Texas banker in his black boots, suit, white shirt and tie.
He removes his jacket and puts some fresh fruit on a plate.
There is a knock at the door.
He rushes over and flings it open.
A chambermaid stands nervously outside.


Budget Talks Take a Breather, but Clinton Presses On
Hung up on odds and ends, Congressional budget negotiators took the weekend off, but President Clinton and his staff continued today to try to drum up support for his economic program.
Mr.
Clinton invited a group of tourists at the White House into the Rose Garden about 8:30 this morning and delivered a campaign-style speech in which he insisted that his program was essential for economic recovery and would pose little burden to middle-income Americans.


Teaching Art the Painful Way
AS MIGHT be expected from an artist, even one whose command of language is impressive, Alan E. Cober talks best with his hands.
Hoping to lead his students to a rout in the next day's illustrators' softball game, he demonstrates with a crumpled wad of memo how to pitch.
And when seized by the impulse to teach perspective, he is only momentarily stymied by the lack of drawing surface and instrument.
"Do we have a blackboard? They stole our blackboard!" he grumbles.
"Does anyone have a knife? We'll carve it into the wall."
He makes do with the wall and a felt-tip pen to show how a map of the United States can be redrawn so that, instead of offering a bird's-eye view, like a map, it tilts back in space.
"This goes for anything," he says.
"If you needed a chicken flattened out, you could do this with a chicken."

Computer View of Art at Neuberger
NEXT fall, the Neuberger Museum at the State University of New York here will be among the first to propel modern art toward the 21st century by taking part of its permanent collection and re-creating it in what the museum calls an interactive kiosk.
Basically a large monitor powered by a self-contained Apple Macintosh computer, the kiosk will be housed in a section of the museum set aside for art education beginning Sept. 15.
Like all so-called interactive multimedia devices, it will offer sound, video, text and graphics and allow the user to manipulate all of these in many ways.


U.N. Envoy From Israel Under Guard
Federal authorities and the New York City police have placed Israel's representative at the United Nations under extra security for the last week because of Israel's shelling of Lebanon and assassination threats by Islamic militants in the New York area, an Israeli official said yesterday.
Avner Tavori, the spokesman for the Israeli mission to the United Nations, said the representative, Gad Yaacobi, had been traveling in an armored Cadillac under the escort of the Federal agents and the New York City police.
He said the precautions had been taken in part because of the Israeli offensive against Iranian-backed guerrillas of the Party of God in Lebanon, but also because of specific death threats.


Vatican Watershed -- A special report.; Papal Birth-Control Letter Retains Its Grip
Twenty-five years after Pope Paul VI put a jolting halt to expectations that the Roman Catholic Church might ease its opposition to artificial birth control, only 1 out of 10 American Catholics agree with the church's position.
But the Pope's 1968 encyclical and the furor it created continue to polarize the American church.
Though birth control is seldom the subject of much serious debate among lay people in the 58-million-member Catholic Church, the effects of the initial debate linger like a low-grade fever, flaring up in areas that have little to do with sexual morality.
To this day, they shape everything from Catholic views on other issues to the selection of bishops and other leaders.


John F. Orrall, Eileen M. Smith
Eileen Marie Smith, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Leonard F. Smith of Centerville, Mass., was married yesterday to John Frederick Orrall, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Roy E. Orrall of Lynnfield, Mass.
The Rev.
Terence F. Keenan performed the ceremony at Our Lady of Victory Roman Catholic Church in Centerville.
The bride is the director of training and development for Bright Horizons Children's Centers Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., which operates 56 day-care centers in 15 states.
She graduated from the College of the Holy Cross and received a master's degree in early-childhood education from Boston College.


Amid Weapons Stockpile, Indian Takes a Stand
On the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian reservation here, men in fatigues with assault rifles and sidearms emerge suddenly from the woods, or from the wooden guard tower that overlooks Stanavage Road.
What appears to be a foxhole, covered with logs and surrounded by sandbags, sits ready behind the reservation's barbed-wire-lined entrance.
In other words, it's just another business day at the Golden Hill Tribal Smoke Shop, where a splinter faction of the tribe is selling tax-free cigarettes in open defiance of Gov.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the state police, the State Tax Department, the elders of the tribe and all the other mostly white enemies that Moonface Bear -- the unquestioned leader here -- says have oppressed American Indians and blacks for 300 years.


Hitting It Right: Tracking Tarpon Through the Florida Keys
Sometimes you just hit it right: one of those days when the weather is fine, the tide is right, the wind is behind you, and the fish are everywhere.
One fine week earlier this summer, I hit it right.


Rebuilding Their Lives After a Fire
Marv Moss and his family today moved back into their rebuilt home on Charing Cross Road, a switchback trail in the Oakland Hills where nine people burned to death and all 27 houses were incinerated in the 1991 firestorm.
The new home, built of red cedar in the craftsman style, "is a symbol that we can adapt, that we can accept, that we can put one foot in front of the other," Mr.
Moss wrote in his journal, musing on the decision to return to the steep, serpentine street where so many lives were lost.


Double Talk
I COVERED THE White House for a while under Reagan and Bush.
And now I cover Ovitz and Katzenberg.
It hasn't been an especially difficult transition.
Each town hungers for the worst parts of the other.
Hollywood's executives and movie stars, embarrassed about their frivolousness and lack of education, crave Washington's exaggerated seriousness, its aura of power, even its pretension and pomposity.


Commercial Property: Co-Brokerage; More Brokers Are Sharing Deals, Often Unhappily
IT started out simply enough.
The New York State Housing Finance Agency and the State of New York Mortgage Agency had a total of 78,470 square feet in two buildings.
They wanted to consolidate the agencies into about 100,000 feet in one building.
They hired the Edward S. Gordon Company to find them the space.


U.S. BROKERS TRUCE TO HALT FIGHTING IN SOUTH LEBANON
Seven days of shelling and air attacks, the largest assault by Israel on Lebanon since the 1982 invasion, ended today after pro-Iranian guerrillas and the Israeli Government agreed to a cease-fire brokered by the United States.
Israel's heavy artillery fell silent at 6 P.M. on Saturday in accordance with the agreement after raining thousands of shells down on some 70 villages in south Lebanon.
Israel also halted air strikes and gunboat attacks, but Israeli jets fired missiles into the hills south of Beirut minutes before the deadline.

Du Pont's Enemy in Lawsuit: Its Own Papers
In a multimillion dollar product liability suit pitting E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company against four ornamental plant growers, Du Pont's own documents have emerged as the growers' star witnesses.
The case, being heard in Federal District Court here, centers on a Du Pont chemical, Benlate DF, used to kill fungus on plants.
The growers assert that in 1991 Benlate was contaminated with the Du Pont weedkiller sulfonylurea, which is the most potent herbicide known to agriculture.


Sound Bytes; A Man With Many Ideas for Addicting Americans
If Thomas J. Kalinske were a video game character, he would rack up more points than Sonic the Hedgehog.
Mr.
Kalinske, president and chief executive officer of Sega of America Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., a subsidiary of Sega Enterprises Ltd. of Japan, joined the toymaker Mattel as a product manager in 1973 and rose to president of the company in 1985.
When he took the control stick at Sega of America in 1990, the video game machine and software company lagged far behind Nintendo with annual sales of $125 million.
This year's sales are "just under a billion," he said, and Sega's Genesis machine is outselling Nintendo's counterpart by two to one.


Two Conflicts Between Historic Preservation and Develpment
THE debate over the preservation of historic buildings and the contemporary pressure to develop is heating up at two sites on Long Island.
In the Village of Huntington, a farmhouse dating from 1830 has become a source of dispute between Huntington Hospital and residents.
The hospital, which owns the vacant house, is seeking approval from the Town Board to move it so that a parking lot can be built on the site.
But residents oppose the move, saying they want to save the town's historic character.

The Only Good Video Is an Edited Video
ENVIRONMENTALISTS say the current generation, if it continues its wasteful ways, will leave a legacy of polluted rivers, landscapes and air.
Camcorder owners, if they don't edit their home videos, will saddle their heirs with miles and miles of mixed-up home video shots that won't even have the "date taken" on the cassettes.
It requires extra effort and dollars to make a home video worth watching.
Viewing an unedited video is like reading an author's notes before he writes his book.
Imagine trying 30 years from now to organize a bunch of unedited tapes made in 1993.


Sports of The Times; Where Do George's Critics Live?
HAS anyone noticed that George Steinbrenner has not fired a pitching coach or banished anyone to Columbus for muffing a ground ball in a one-run game?
Could it be that he is otherwise occupied tormenting New York politicians?
Better it be Mario Cuomo than Gene Michael.
Steinbrenner's critics haven't yet caught on that the Boss's stadium crusade is the nicest thing he has done for his baseball team in more than a decade.
While the Boss postures to build a new house, like his long, late, distant relative, the Babe, Michael continues to refocus the team and Buck Showalter steers it deeper into the race.
May this be the organization's delegation of work assignments until the end of the club's Yankee Stadium lease, in 2003.


After 30 Years, Seeing Clothes In a New Light
The celebration of Geoffrey Beene's 30th anniversary as a designer will be a collaborative effort.
Tom Kalin, the director of last year's art-house film success "Swoon," has just finished shooting a short film to mark the occasion.
The silent, black-and-white film, "30.," features Viveca Lindfors, Marcia Gay Harden and the models Roshumba and Caprice Benedetti wearing a retrospective selection of Mr.
Beene's fashions.
"He wanted to see the clothes move again." Mr.
Kalin said.
"The film is a way to stage the clothes in different contexts to show off their romantic, lyrical and surreal aspects, but it's not some sort of costume pageant."


It Don't Mean A Thing . . .
To the Editor:
The admonition by the American Symphony Orchestra League that orchestras should perform works that "reflect more closely the cultural mix" of the communities is, if anything, a sign of ignorance.
I recently heard some Duke Ellington works performed by a symphony in New Haven.
The result was disappointing at best.
Ellington's music is designed to be played by musical organizations that perform in a particular stylistic way.
Symphony orchestras were not designed to swing.

Famers Thank Others for Their Laurels
Each man stood rigidly and proudly during his special moment. Each man stood alone.
Each stood behind a podium on the steps of pro football's Hall of Fame this afternoon where each was recognized as one of the game's best.
It was a glorious, bright, sunny day, indeed, for Walter Payton, Bill Walsh, Chuck Noll, Larry Little and Dan Fouts.
And each man made a singular point.


THE TWISTED LEGACY OF IRAN-CONTRA
Scott Spencer's otherwise excellent article "Lawrence Walsh's Last Battle" (July 4) overstates the legal accomplishments of Judge Walsh's work while understating the historical significance of his investigation.
It is true that of the 14 people prosecuted, Walsh obtained convictions or guilty pleas from 11.
Seven of those, however, were plea-bargain agreements, mostly on misdemeanor charges, that resulted only in slap-on-the-wrist fines and a few hours of community service.


Blue Jays Get Henderson From A's
When the Yankees acquired Rickey Henderson from the Oakland Athletics at baseball's winter meetings in 1984, he balked at attending the news conference announcing the trade until he was paid $50,000 for his time.
Last night, Henderson again got what he wanted, and the Athletics traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays.
Wherever Henderson goes, he makes an impact, and he is expected to do that again, this time on the American League East race.
The Yankees, to whom Henderson had said he would have considered returning, will get the first look at him because the Blue Jays come to Yankee Stadium for a four-game series beginning tomorrow night.


This Man Wants to Bury You
Off in this city's industrial wasteland sits an unmarked building of corrugated steel, perpetually locked.
Now and then, a wide door rises, a black Chevrolet Suburban truck backs in, and a whiff of formaldehyde escapes before the entry clanks shut.
Here, 15 times a day, more than 5,000 times a year, the residents of Houston come to be embalmed.
In any other business, Service Corporation International would call this site its regional processing and distribution center.
Remains flow in from households and hospitals around the city, in trucks large enough for two cots.
Twin walk-in coolers accommodate the center's backlog.
Once embalmed -- or prepped, as they say -- the remains are delivered to the company's 15 funeral homes in the Houston area.


'What's Happened?'
MONKFISH MOON By Romesh Gunesekera. 138 pp. New York:  The New Press. $16.95.


Sharyn Korobow, Jonathan Lewis
Naomi and Leon Korobow of Great Neck, L.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter Sharyn Elizabeth Korobow to Jonathan Alexander Lewis, a son of Barbara and Jack Lewis of Reston, Va.
A September wedding is planned.
Ms.
Korobow, 25, graduated from Northwestern University, as did her fiance, and received a law degree from Yeshiva University.
In August she will become a clerk in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan.


Working Around Walls In Crooked Rooms
BUILDING a partition wall is usually a fairly easy exercise.
But when the existing walls, floor, ceiling do not meet at right angles the work can become a nightmare.
Here are two wall-building methods that professionals use in crooked rooms.
Before starting measure between both ends of the existing walls that will be parallel to the partition wall to determine whether the existing walls are parallel to each other.
If they are, measure from either of them along the floor at both ends of the room to determine the position of the partition wall.
Mark the position by snapping a chalkline between.


Homemade Ice Cream, Fresh Fruit Taste
WITH berries, peaches and plums -- and the weather -- all at their peak, it is the perfect time for making ice cream.
I often buy too much fruit because it looks so good at the farm stand, and I usually end up making it into ice cream before it turns bad.
The other day, after spending an afternoon picking raspberries at a local farm, my 5-year-old son tripped and scattered the contents of his baskets all over the ground.
He was dismayed until I told him we would rinse off the berries and use them to make ice cream.


CASTLES IN THE SAND
I thoroughly enjoyed your article, with one exception -- the family portrait of John Eberhardt and his "adopted son and lover." My attitude has always been live and let live, but the words "adopted son and lover" denote an unhealthy relationship -- dare I say incest?
This same situation is what many found appalling about Woody Allen's affair and his attitude that nothing was wrong with it.
CAROL M. URQUHART Smithtown, L.I.


The Executive Computer; An Impressive Line From Lexmark Breaks Old Ground
LEXMARK INTERNATIONAL last week introduced a generation of peripheral printing devices that make it astonishingly easy to address envelopes and to fill in the blank areas on forms.
Lexmark describes the new devices as perfect office companions for personal computers.
Besides processing envelopes and forms with ease, the new machines can print multipart forms, including overnight courier labels, packing slips and insurance forms.
Such tasks are impossible on laser printers.


THE TWISTED LEGACY OF IRAN-CONTRA
Oliver North is campaigning for a seat in a branch of government he does not respect.
In his career in the National Security Council, he proved both in word and deed that he believes in the supreme power of the executive branch (meaning either Ronald Reagan or himself, as his mood dictated) to conduct foreign policy as it sees fit.
No checks and balances, no advise or consent: he regarded the House and Senate as useless appendages, to be lied to and used for publicity.
How he could hope to contribute to that body is beyond me.

WALKER WHITE Arlington, Va.


A Feisty Pair of Eminent Victorians
LET Broadway hold on to its "new Gershwin musical comedy." Westchester's got the new Gilbert and Sullivan show.
Years before Ken Ludwig concocted a silly book to accompany an aimless assortment of Gershwin songs and called it "Crazy for You," he wrote a pastiche, "Sullivan and Gilbert," about a command performance in 1890 before Queen Victoria by the D'Oyly Carte Company, London's resident troupe exclusively devoted to the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan.


Demjanjuk Due to Go to Ukraine, Israel Says
John Demjanjuk, whose conviction for war crimes as the death camp guard "Ivan the Terrible" was overturned, is due to leave Israel for Ukraine on Sunday, Israeli officials said today.
"The Police Department and prison authorities say the deportation of Demjanjuk has been arranged, and tomorrow at 14:30 he will leave Israel for Kiev, Ukraine, unless there is another decision by the Supreme Court or an order by the Attorney General," said a police spokesman, Raffi Levy.


A Hospital's New Site Stirs Opposition
UP and down the western edge of mid-Manhattan, St.
Clare's Hospital and Health Center searched for a place to put its new building.
It finally settled on a site on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, in what looked like a parking lot but turned out to be a hornet's nest.
That is because the site, directly across from the Worldwide Plaza office and apartment complex, is in Broadway's backyard, just a few steps west of the Gershwin, Circle in the Square, Ambassador and Eugene O'Neill Theaters.


Deconstructionists And the Emperor
To the Editor:
I was encouraged by your article on deconstructionism in fashion ("Coming Apart," July 25).
The Martin Margiela jacket with detached "sleeve" must reflect the extent to which the economy, stretched by the current lull in accumulation, is coming apart at the seams.
Considering the short reign of modernism and the even shorter rule of post-modernism, one is given hope that deconstructionism itself will be fleetingly brief, and that as the attached sleeve disappears from the runways of fashion, the emperor that is the market economy will be revealed at last to have no clothes.


Sara Waring, Taegan Goddard
Sara Mercedes Waring, a research assistant at the World Bank, and Taegan Daniel Goddard, a policy analyst for the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, both in Washington, were married in Woodstock, Vt., yesterday.
The Rev.
Donald Boyer performed the ceremony at the St.
James Episcopal Church.
Mrs.
Goddard, 26, graduated from Mount Holyoke College and is to attend the Yale University School of Organization and Management next month.
She is a daughter of Lucy Waring Young of London and the late March Chase Waring.
Her father was the founder and president of the Waring Consultancy, a financial consulting company in Jakarta, Indonesia.
Her mother is an artist in London.

Heidi A. Pesky, F. L. Worcester Jr.
Heidi Alison Pesky and Frederick Lothrup Worcester Jr., landscape architects in Charlottesville, Va., were married yesterday in Ketchum, Idaho, in a meadow in the Boulder Mountains.
Judge Cathy Silak of the Idaho Supreme Court in Boise officiated.
Mrs.
Worcester works for Francois Goffinet Ltd., an architectural concern.
She graduated from Colorado College and received a master's degree in landscape architecture from Harvard University.
She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Alan D. Pesky of Ketchum.
The bride's father, who retired as a partner in Scali, McCabe, Sloves Advertising in New York, is now the principal in the A. D. Pesky Company, an investment concern in New York and Ketchum.
Her mother, Wendy Pesky, is a partner in the Farmhouse Collection Inc., a furniture manufacturer in Hailey, Idaho.


FISH STOCKS DOWN TO PARLOUS LEVELS
Rival fishing nations grimly acknowledged this week that their fleets have thinned out stocks of the world's edible marine fish to levels unimaginable only a few years ago, and that only coordinated conservation and management steps will restore them.
But at the conclusion of three weeks of talks here, a core negotiating group of 70 governments remained far apart on the central problem: how to reconcile the time-honored freedom to harvest the sea with the biological consequences of overfishing.
It is a notion that went largely unnoticed until catch rates worldwide began declining sharply about four years ago.


Blazers' Top Pick Leaves Camp
JAMES ROBINSON, the Portland Trail Blazers' first-round draft pick who had been working out with the team's summer-league squad in Salt Lake City, has returned to his home in Mississippi.
The former Alabama guard had been participating only in non-contact workouts.
He did not attend a Friday morning practice and said before he left town later in the day that he was upset at being unable to play in the squad's Rocky Mountain Revue games.
He said he will not come back until he has signed a contract.


Helen Gardiner, Louis K. Parks
Helen Marie Gardiner, the daughter of Keith M. Gardiner of Bethlehem, Pa., and Veronica Gardiner of South Burlington, Vt., was married yesterday to Louis Keenan Parks, a son of Donald and Lorraine Parks of Rockville, Md.
The Rev.
Robert J. Reed, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated at the Church of SS.
Simon and Jude in Bethlehem.
The bride graduated from Wellesley College and is a candidate for a master's degree in early-childhood education at Sarah Lawrence College.
Her father is the director of the Center for Manufacturing Systems Engineering at Lehigh University in Bethlehem.


Taste and Place
To the Editor: I thoroughly enjoyed the article by Libby Lubin on buying clothes while traveling only to discover they are not appropriate at home (July 18).
It's my opinion that the same is true about food and drink.
Sipping a pina colada in the tropical ambiance of Puerto Rico while gazing at the sea tastes completely different from one here.
I was in Mexico once and found the margaritas there so delicious that I brought back a bottle of Mexican tequila for my husband.
He hated it, and I was hard put to convince him that in Mexico it had been wonderful.


Miss Cavaliere And Mr. Wilson
Frances Cavaliere, an audit manager, and Christopher Wilson, a senior accountant, both at Ernst &amp; Young in New York, were married yesterday.

Bettine Besier officiated at St.

More on Sampras
To the Sports Editor:
Dr.
Peter Fischer ("The Making of a Wimbledon Champion: the Formative Years," The Times, July 11) discussed the period in which he coached Pete Sampras toward his 1993 Wimbledon triumph.
Although rightfully contending that he contributed to his pupil's technical capacity to win, Fischer omitted any comment on his failure to have fostered Sampras's psychological capacity to win.
It is now clear to everyone that Sampras controls his anxiety by becoming preoccupied with physical symptoms, especially as he approaches victory.


Deborah Jane Kazis, Gideon Taylor

Her mother, Judith Kazis, is a tutor at Public School 183 in New York.


Streetscapes: 125 Joralemon Street; Ersatz History vs. Plain Reality
IT is common to condemn the artificial, the Disney-like in historic preservation and prefer what reality has deposited rather than the managed fakery of pseudo-historic designs.
This conviction might be put to an extreme test at the dinky but unique little 50's bungalow at 125 Joralemon Street in the Brooklyn Heights historic district.
This spring the Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to allow its demolition and replacement with a mock stable in the neo-neo-Romanesque style.
Brooklyn Heights was in full flower as late as the 1890's, when the mansion of David Chauncey, a Wall Street banker, went up at 129 Joralemon Street.
Later apartment development replaced only a small percentage of the thousand-odd private houses in the area.

Essay; When an Aide Dies Violently
Almost three decades ago, the body of a talented artist was found along the Georgetown canal towpath, a bullet in her head.
Because she had for years been an intimate friend of President Kennedy, counterspy James Jesus Angleton was immediately notified and searched her home before the police arrived.
When her diary came into his hands, that Kennedy loyalist destroyed it, as he later indicated to me, "to protect the Presidency." A suspect was tried and acquitted; the prosecutor was justifiably furious when it was revealed that the C.I.A. destroyed the murder victim's diary.
The crime was never solved.


Miner's Mark Reshuffles The 3-Year-Old Picture
The jumbled class of 3-year-old colts grew even more jumbled today when the Jim Dandy Stakes, the return match for Triple Crown colts, was won by a neck by Miner's Mark, who didn't run in any of the Triple Crown races.
Not only that, but second place was taken by Virginia Rapids, who ran fifth in the Belmont Stakes in his only appearance in the Triple Crown.
And then, nearly five lengths from the lead, came the stars of springtime: Colonial Affair, who won the Belmont Stakes in June, and Sea Hero, who won the Kentucky Derby in May, both carrying 9 pounds more than the winner but both clearly beaten on this day at the races.
Two Halves Too Tough
So, who's the leader of the glamour division now?
Maybe none of the above.
Maybe Kissin Kris, who won the $500,000 Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in an upset about half an hour after Miner's Mark won the Jim Dandy.
But the true leader will not surface now until most of the same colts race in the $1 million Travers Stakes at Saratoga on Aug. 21.


For Children, Nothing Beats Two-Parent Home
To the Editor:
In "Bothered and Bewildered" (Op-Ed, July 21), Katha Pollitt argues that the tie between marriage and maternity is irrevocably broken.
Women can have careers, homes, a sex life and children without husbands, and in our public values, we should stop acting as if they cannot.
As for the much documented problems faced by children in households headed by single women, Ms.
Pollitt attributes these to poverty and the absence of paid parental leave, publicly subsidized day care, flexibility in job scheduling, better child support and "comparable worth" pay scales.


Entrepreneurs Pave Path For the Next Generation
A thriving population of black entrepreneurs prospering in business has been a dream since the days of Booker T. Washington.

But for some successful entrepreneurs, the dream remains alive, and a few have taken it upon themselves to guide the young.


Microsoft Installing a Team For New Look in Computers
Seeking to influence the design of a new generation of more powerful consumer-oriented computers, the Microsoft Corporation has hired a small team of supercomputer engineers, company executives said today.
The world's largest software company has no intention of entering the supercomputer industry, the officials noted.
Instead Microsoft wants to take the expertise of those who design the world's fastest computers and apply it to problems that personal computer companies are facing in creating a new class of computing devices that will control future digital television sets and other consumer appliances.

5 Shots Back, Floyd Catches Fire
Ray Floyd has come to Long Island twice to play golf in his illustrious career and has walked away a winner each time.
The North Carolinian captured the $550,000 Northville Long Island Classic today in a final drive reminiscent of his victory in the United States Open at Shinnecock Hills in 1986.
The 50-year-old Floyd today had seven birdies and no bogeys to win the tournament at the Meadow Brook Club here, despite starting the day five shots off the lead.

Pop and Jazz in Review
Wolfgang Muthspiel  Sweet Basil
In the 1980's, acoustic jazz was besieged by musicians who thought that its language had dried up, that it needed some help with its vocabulary.
Musicians brought world music and pop and rhythm and blues to jazz, and for the most part the grafts have withered away.
Wolfgang Muthspiel, a German guitarist, uses funk patterns, and a rock tone, and doesn't swing.
But he does it all in a context -- using an acoustic bass, drums and a saxophone and fluegelhorn -- that means to imply a mainstream jazz sophistication.
Add to that some techniques taken from the avant-garde of the 1960's, and Tuesday night's set became unsatisfying and a bit thoughtless.

Review/Theater: In the Summer House; Mothers, Daughters and Tangled Emotions
"I'm Jewish, homosexual, alcoholic, a communist -- and I'm a cripple!" Jane Bowles once bragged, winning a bout of one-upsmanship with a self-pitying fellow traveler on the literary fringe.
Bowles, whose writing career was over by the time she had a stroke at the age of 40 and who died in 1973 at 56, was everything she said and more, including the wife of the novelist and composer Paul Bowles ("The Sheltering Sky"), with whom she fashioned a now-legendary open marriage in the sybaritic expatriates' colony of Tangier.
An original and independent woman, yet one who never escaped her demons or her husband's orbit, Jane Bowles was born to be a heroine for our time, if only a cult figure in her own.
She'd be fascinating with or without her limp, as those who have read her letters, her biography (by Millicent Dillon) or Michelle Green's recent group portrait of the Tangier crowd ("The Dream at the End of the World," published by HarperCollins) can attest.
Her own literary output, however, was tiny: one novel, seven short stories and one full-length play, "In the Summer House," which was revived at the Vivian Beaumont Theater last night.

Review/Opera; Glimmerglass Reflects A Dual 'Cosi Fan Tutte'
Opera has the impossible job of matching the formal designs of musical sound to the natural flow of human affairs.
Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte," which played here at the Glimmerglass Opera on Thursday night, comes astonishingly close.
In Act I, Scene 2's quintet-trio sequence, a mysterious chemistry transforms sorrow and sarcasm into musical counterpoint; sentiment, in turn, becomes un-self-conscious formality.
It is like observing the fervor and the geometry of a biblical painting all at once: a story told, and yet an arrangement of figures, the play of light, the fold of drapery.
Given such a miraculous union, producers of "Cosi Fan Tutte" usually rush to celebrate it.
The Glimmerglass team -- Martha Clarke, the director; James Ingalls, the lighting designer, and Robert Israel, who made the sets and costumes -- has taken a more (dare I use the word?) deconstructionist viewpoint.
Form and content have been pulled apart, like the sleeve from one of this season's modish jackets.
One sees them separately and simultaneously.
Not all of last night's orchestra playing and ensemble singing lived up to this fascinating dichotomy.
The ears were allowed to get the idea; the eyes were allowed to feast on it.

Officials Lift Water Alert For Chelsea
Environmental officials lifted a water alert for the Chelsea section of Manhattan last night, but they said they were still baffled by the weeklong outbreak of bacteria that has forced tens of thousands of residents across New York City to boil their drinking water.
And they could not give assurances that water in other neighborhoods would remain free of contamination.
The city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Albert F. Appleton, said he was stepping up his agency's efforts to solve a scientific mystery that has endured for nearly a week: what is causing the high levels of bacteria discovered in water mains across the city -- from Morris Park in the Bronx to lower Manhattan to Little Neck and Douglaston, Queens.


Israeli Court Bars Demjanjuk's Leaving
Even as John Demjanjuk waited with his bags packed to leave his prison cell here for Ukraine, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled today that he could not go until the Government considered whether to press new war-crimes charges against him after the court overturned his conviction in the "Ivan the Terrible" case.
A three-judge panel instructed Israel's Attorney General to submit arguments in the next week on whether he wanted to pursue a case against Mr.
Demjanjuk for having served as a Nazi guard at the Sobibor death camp in Poland during World War II.

CHRONICLE
What can you do with a 175,000-acre ranch in Colorado that includes three 14,000-foot peaks on its terrain?
Malcolm Forbes, the late magazine publisher, bought the property in Fort Garland, Colo., in 1969 and named it Forbes Trinchera Ranch, intending to operate it as a game preserve.
"Then Colorado changed its hunting laws, making the season shorter, so there we were with a large piece of property and no visible means of income," said his son CHRISTOPHER C. FORBES , vice president of Forbes Inc., the other day.
"For three months a year during hunting season . . .  it was very busy, and for nine months it sat there with a large and capable staff doing very little."

Waters Bulldoze an Illinois City and Aim for St. Louis
Coursing higher and faster than officials had predicted just one day earlier, the Mississippi River overwhelmed a levee today and swept through the downtown streets of this city today in a swirl of muddy water that shut down the city's water plant and even topped street lights in some areas.
Then it surged southward, where it was expected to merge with the Missouri River and crest at record levels in St.

Two Converging Cases Tear At Divisions in Los Angeles
Two racially charged trials intersect here this week: a Federal judge is scheduled to sentence two white police officers convicted in the beating of a black motorist, Rodney G.

The two cases, offering legal and emotional counterpoints in black and white, have come to symbolize the divisions and resentments that have kept Los Angeles on edge since the city flared into violence 15 months ago.

Davenport Tackles Flood's Damage With Energy and Humor

So what about the ticket takers and hot dog vendors for the Quad City River Bandits, the Midwest League team that has been forced for now to reschedule its home games into away contests?
They have come back to work -- to scrape, grade and resod the field in a frantic effort to get their team, which, after all, is still in a pennant race, back home.


Ginsburg's Spirit Is Echoed by Other Pioneers
In the years that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was rejected by law firms although she had graduated first in her 1959 Columbia Law School class, Muriel F. Siebert was told that she would be hired as a securities analyst only if she wore white gloves and a hat in the elevator.
At the same time, Maria Iandolo New collected rejections from medical schools because she had the temerity to marry.
As Judge Ginsburg nears confirmation by the Senate as a Supreme Court Justice, her long road to eminence echoes the experience of a generation of women who embarked on careers in a pre-feminist era, before they had an ideology to justify their actions and a movement to open doors that were shut to them.
Hearings Revive Memories
And many say the barriers remain formidable, although open discrimination is now illegal, thanks in part to the work of Judge Ginsburg.
Ms.
Siebert went on to become the first woman to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, and Dr.
New ended up as the first woman to head a department at Cornell University Medical College, where she is chief of pediatrics.

LEBANESE REFUGEES ARE HURRYING BACK TO RAVAGED HOMES
Thousands of Lebanese began to stream back home today, creating wild traffic jams on roads leading from Beirut to the agricultural hamlets, villages and small seaside towns of southern Lebanon after a cease-fire reached on Saturday ended a seven-day Israeli bombardment.
Dazed residents poured into scores of tiny villages perched on the steep mountain ridges and along the Mediterranean shore to scenes of collapsed houses, burned hulks of cars and concrete rubble.
The landscape of destruction was unlike anything seen in years in this country, which has experienced civil strife and war since 1975.


EUROPEANS AGREE TO LET CURRENCIES FLUCTUATE WIDELY
European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs, trying to save the remnants of the European Monetary System, agreed early this morning to let their currencies rise and fall as much as 15 percent -- a far wider margin than has been allowed during 14 years of attempts at forging closer links.
They acted after Germany's central bank refused on Thursday to lower the discount rate, as many had expected it would, and currency speculators responded on Friday by selling great quantities of the weakening French franc and buying German marks.
Central banks from a number of countries intervened in efforts to prop up the franc, but without much effect.

Softer Franc Could Help To Bolster the Economy
The European Community's decision early today to allow the French franc and six other European currencies to float more freely against the German mark is above all a severe political blow to France, which had staked its honor on maintaining the franc's parity with the mark.
Yet while it will be difficult for the French Government to claim that its strong franc -- its "franc fort" -- policy has not been swept away by a de facto devaluation, the move may in fact be just what this country's economy needs to lift it out of a deepening recession.

Color in Politics: Impact Of Race on Campaign
ALBERT SHANKER, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, posed a fundamental question last week about race and its role in the New York City mayoral campaign: "Was it better in the old days when prejudice was out in the open or nowadays when prejudice is hidden?"
Writing about the search for a new Schools Chancellor, Mr.
Shanker said he was struck with the impression that whites need not apply.
As evidence, he said that after he had been suggested for the job himself, he received a questionnaire seeking information about his race and his sex.
Also, that the completed selection process was reopened when a white man (like Mr. Shanker) emerged as the leading prospect after one other finalist (a black) withdrew and the candidacy of the third (a Hispanic educator) faded.

Review/Theater; A Family's Ties That Bind As a Foundation for Farce
"Twisted Roots," the clever catch-all name for Tuesday evening's Serious Fun program at Alice Tully Hall, is a label that could be applied to any of the three frisky performances that took over the stage in a two-and-a-half-hour show.
Applied to Ain and David Gordon's play, "The Family Business, Act I," it could refer to the fact that the work, written and performed by members of the same family, explores their ties to one another and to an aged relative.
In the second part, Ken Bullock, a performance artist from Georgia, does ultra-campy sendups of Southern cultural stereotypes.
The members of Instant Girl (Janet Bogardus, Joanna Heimbold and Susan Trout), the performance trio that concluded the show, have known one another since childhood.

Editorial Notebook; 'Socialized Medicine' Revisited
Nowadays everybody likes Harry Truman, the subject of a best-selling biography and of admiring remarks by Presidents Bush and Clinton.
This was not the case on Nov. 19, 1945, when Truman became the first President to propose a comprehensive medical insurance program for Americans of all ages.
For this, Truman was reviled by the American Medical Association and its most visible spokesman, Dr.
Morris Fishbein, editor of the A.M.A.
Journal.
The tone of the debate was established by this overheated editorial in the country's most widely read medical publication:

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; And Then There Were Five? QVC's Barry Diller Would Face Big Hurdles in Building a New Network.
WHEN cable television's QVC Network shopping channel announced plans recently to merge with the Home Shopping Network, the speculation was immediate and inevitable: the move, it was said, was surely a forerunner to the creation of a fifth broadcast television network.
The primary reason for this presumption is that the man who heads QVC, Barry Diller, created the fourth network, Fox Broadcasting, only seven years ago.
Most of the television industry has been waiting for Mr.
Diller to move toward another new network because it seems unlikely that a man with Mr.
Diller's programming skills would be satisfied to run a home-shopping operation.

Alcantara Journal; Brazil's 'Window on Space' Broken
Strolling the quiet cobblestone streets here, it is easy to conjure up the 18th-century glory of Alcantara's cotton barons.
Blue and white tiles from Lisbon and Macao sheathed elegant town houses of the rural aristocracy.
Inside, lavish banquets with harpsichord music, imported crystal and English silver celebrated the return of young nobles from university studies at faraway Coimbra in Portugal or at Yale.
First, a drop in cotton prices in the 1830's, and then the abolition of slavery in 1888, reduced this proud town to a ghost town.
Palaces and convents long ago collapsed into piles of local bricks and imported stone.
And today, green tufts of vegetation sprout irreverently from looming facades of surviving Baroque churches.
Preserved as national patrimony, Alcantara now lives largely off historical tourism.

Still Solid, G.O.P. Opposition To Clinton May Soon Soften
Toward the end of this week, all 219 Republican members of Congress will line up against President Clinton's budget bill.
It may be the last time they are this united in the 103d Congress.
A posture of relentless opposition has served the Republicans well when it is focused on big issues, like the budget plan's tax increases, or even the economic stimulus bill.
Buttressed by sincere economic beliefs, it reassures their natural supporters and scores political points with swing voters.


Orioles Are Put on the Bidding Block With a Judge as the Auctioneer

Groups headed by an investment banker from Cincinnati, a lawyer from Baltimore, an international art dealer from New York and a former National Football League tight end make up the lineup of bidders who want to succeed Eli Jacobs as the owner of the suddenly financially successful Orioles.

The latest problems surfaced in Louisiana this week when the State Insurance Commissioner forced the resignations of the local plan's chairman and most of its board members.
The commissioner, James H. Brown, accused Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana of squandering premium money on exorbitant salaries and perquisites and engaging in questionable billing practices that may have bilked policy holders and Medicare of tens of millions of dollars.

"Blue Cross has always been looked on as American as apple pie," said Mr.
Brown, whose action seemed to catch many in the state capital as well as in the plan by surprise.

Baudouin, King of Belgium, Dies in Southern Spain at 62
Baudouin I, the King of Belgium for 42 years and one of the more reclusive of Europe's monarchs, died on Saturday while vacationing in Motril, in the province of Granada in southern Spain.
He was 62.
A spokesman for the Spanish Government attributed the death to a heart attack.
The King had been in ill health for two years, having undergone prostate surgery in 1991 and an open-heart operation last year.
Baudouin, who is to be buried on Saturday in Brussels at St.
Michel Cathedral, was the fifth King of the Belgians.


Review/City Opera; The Original 'Butterfly,' and Pinkerton's a Cad
Giacomo Puccini, the scion of Italian operatic tradition, was not content with the destiny set out for him.
He repeatedly tried to escape the confines of his Milanese milieu, adapting the innovations of his more radical contemporaries.
The man who journeyed far to see Strauss's "Salome" and Schoenberg's "Pierrot Lunaire" was seeking ways to bring Italian opera into the 20th century.
Tradition, however, held fast; audiences preferred the previous century.
Thus the initial failure of "Madama Butterfly," which Puccini intended as a departure from standard melodrama.
After a savage reception from a La Scala crowd in 1904, the composer quickly concocted substitute versions of his "Japanese Tragedy," softening the central conflict of American and Japanese culture.
The final 1906 version has since become universally beloved, despite makeshift plotting in the third act.

Mr.

Doubts Raised On Insurance In L.I. Swindle
Six banks and dozens of businesses that prosecutors say lost about $38 million in a swindle by an armored-car service are in danger of not being reimbursed by the service's insurer because a Federal indictment says the insurance policy was part of the fraud, lawyers involved in the case say.
And while Federal agents continue to search for the missing money, the couple accused of masterminding the scheme is being investigated for their role in financing a new taxi and limousine company, said a law-enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Kindergarten Holds Hostages Too Old to Flee
In Kindergarten Number 3 in the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, 47 Azerbaijani men and women are being held in what was once a children's playroom.
They sleep on metal cots, made for 6-year-olds.
The women are bundled in layers of tattered and dirty skirts and sweaters, their heads covered with scarves, the men in dark suits and sweaters -- their only possessions.
They are hostages, among the 92 civilians captured by the Karabakh army when it invaded Kelbajar in April.
Most of the villagers fled before the army arrived.
Contrary to many published reports, Kelbajar was not encircled,-- an escape route was left open for the civilians, according to relief workers who were present at the time.

Books of The Times; An Innate Universal Moral Sense? If So, Why?
The Moral Sense  By James Q. Wilson  313 pages. The Free Press/Macmillan. $22.95.
Superficially considered, James Q. Wilson in his new book, "The Moral Sense," sounds like an old-fashioned father banging on the tabletop and shouting for a rejection of new-fangled ideas and a return to the ways of our ancestors.
It's these modern-age thinkers like Darwin, Marx and Freud who have got us in such trouble, he says.
It's the cultural relativists and logical positivists.
Who says there's no longer such a thing as virtue? he demands to know.
Why, we wouldn't always be complaining about crime and immorality if we didn't know what virtue was.
Our very concern over the decline of ethics proves that our moral standards are still very much intact.

What Do the Mets Do With Veteran Murray?
The box score entry could have come from any season of the last two decades.
Murray, Eddie: 5-2-3-3.
The numbers translated into three hits and three runs batted in and ultimately a 10-3 triumph for the Mets over the Cardinals.
What was indecipherable about the numbers, though, was why no one in baseball seems overly impressed by them.
Murray, the first baseman with historic accomplishments and an eminently intact ability to produce runs, was offered by the Mets to any club in either league that would listen.
The Mets put Murray's 1993 average (it was .289 after today) and his home run and r.b.i. totals (15 and 71) on the table and waited for the telephone to ring.

TENNIS  No. 95 in World, No. 1 in Canadian Open  Mikael Pernfors of Sweden continued a remarkable comeback with a 2-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory over Todd Martin yesterday in the Player's International Canadian Open tournament in Montreal.
Pernfors, a top-10 player in 1986 who developed Achilles' tendon problems, got his first victory since he won in Scottsdale, Ariz., in 1988.
Pernfors, 30, the lowest-ranked player ever to reach the Canadian Open final at No. 95, earned $235,000 -- more than he had won since undergoing surgery on his injured foot in April 1990.
Pernfors had upset Jim Courier, the No.2-seeded player, and Petr Korda, seeded sixth, en route to the final.
Pernfors had dropped to a career low ranking of 1,001 in 1991 and had only rebounded to No. 237 by the end of last season.
The Canadian Open was the first tournament in which he didn't have to go through qualifying since his operation. (AP) Costa Makes Short Work of Gustaffson: Carlos Costa lost only six games against Magnus Gustafsson to win the Dutch Open clay-court championship in Hilversum, the Netherlands.

Beyond the Flood, Farmers Worry About Drought and an Early Frost
For all the damage that flooding and drenching rains have caused in the Midwest, most farmers and agribusiness in general are feeling more threatened by weather of a very different sort.
A dry or very hot August followed by an early frost, they worry, could do far more damage than the flooding.
The problem is that spring crops were planted late across most of the Midwest because of a late harvest last year and spring storms.
For millions of acres of corn, August heat could interfere with the crucial pollination process.
And both corn and soybeans, the two most important crops in the region, will not have fully matured by the prime harvest time.

Plundering the Seas
Last year's Earth Summit in Brazil produced few concrete agreements but one transcendent lesson: The earth's most serious environmental problems know no national boundaries; they require a global response.
But if the just-concluded U.N. conference on threatened fisheries is any guide, a collective response to common dangers remains a distant dream.
Nationalism is still king.
The conference, one of several follow-up sessions mandated at Rio de Janeiro, drew 150 diplomats and a small army of lawyers, marine biologists and industry officials.
They arrived in general agreement that many species -- including dinner-table staples like cod, tuna and mackerel -- are steadily being wiped out by overfishing.
They left in almost total disagreement as to who is to blame or how to manage and propagate the fish that are left.

Initially, Blue Cross plans covered hospital bills and Blue Shield plans covered doctors' bills, but most have merged into single corporations that offer both types of insurance.

War in Caucasus Shows Ethnic Hate's Front Line
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, independent nations have been born and reborn, but sovereignty has eluded one of the first groups to seek it, the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, a small enclave in the Caucasus that Stalin put inside the borders of the republic of Azerbaijan rather than in Armenia.

Bosnian Leaders Oppose Plan to Carve Up the Country Into 3 States
International mediators pressed ahead today with their plan to carve up Bosnia and Herzegovina into three ethnically based states, despite opposition by members of Bosnia's collective leadership, who warned that it would reward aggression and could turn another million people into refugees.
At the urging of Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, and Thorvald Stoltenberg, who represents the United Nations, the leaders of the victorious Serbian and Croatian factions, who together control about 90 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina, agreed on "a target figure" of 30 percent for the new Muslim ethnic state.

CURTAILING SMOKING IN THE MALL
As the country goes, so goes the mall.
And the country, judging by the number of malls moving to ban cigarettes, minds very much if you smoke.
Some states, like New York and Vermont, have laws that prohibit smoking in most public indoor spaces, including malls.
But in the last few months, dozens of malls throughout the country that are not bound by such laws have announced plans to go smoke-free, citing health concerns regarding secondhand smoke.
And those unwilling to take the plunge are dipping in, instituting designated smoking and nonsmoking sections.

An Economic Hooray for Hollywood
Known more for glitz and glamour than for the jobs and commerce that it creates, the ever-expanding film and television industry is emerging as a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy economy here.
With some $8 billion in revenues last year, the film and television industry has become the leading producer of jobs in the Los Angeles area, eclipsing aerospace, real estate and tourism, which are all in decline.

For Children, Nothing Beats Two-Parent Home; Too Poor to Marry
To the Editor:
Re "Speed the Search for Deadbeat Dads" (editorial, July 17): Divorced fathers, in the middle and upper class at least as much as among the poor, regularly neglect their financial obligations to their children.
But for poor dads there's a dimension you neglect.


Hispanic Stations Hope to Lift S.B.A. Rule
Spanish-language broadcasters, who say a credit crunch is hampering their growth and preventing them from serving the nation's growing Hispanic population, have begun a lobbying effort that, if successful, could unleash millions of dollars of financing to radio station owners.
The campaign is supported by the powerful National Association of Broadcasters, whose lobbying helped prod the Federal Communications Commission to relax radio station ownership rules last year.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; General Mills Tries to Position Cereal Beyond the Breakfast Table.
OVER the years, American marketers' more improbable contributions to cuisine have ranged from TV dinners and Ding Dongs to Spaghettios and Sno Balls.
Can General Mills avoid adding to that list a crunchy cereal "made to eat with your fingers"?
The product, called, most appropriately, Fingos, is produced, most unconventionally, in oversized chip-like flakes intended to be eaten by hand -- sans spoon, bowl or milk.
At $34 million, the budget for the first year of the advertising and promotional campaign, which begins this week, is among the largest ever for a cereal.


Political Memo; Perot's Alternative Budget Plan: Attack and Dodge Specifics
For ordinary politicians, Ross Perot's performance on television this morning might have spelled political disaster.
While he was in his usual fighting form as he bashed President Clinton's economic program, Mr.
Perot looked uninformed and uncomfortable, as he was unable to answer even the most basic questions about his own alternative.

The Release of Larry Hogue
Though his release has been postponed, chances are that Larry Hogue, a mentally ill man who for years terrorized residents of Manhattan's Upper West Side with his bizarre, sometimes violent behavior, will soon leave Creedmoor Mental Health Center.
He was involuntarily committed last year on the grounds that he was likely to abuse crack and become dangerous if let out.
Understandably, that's worrisome news to the residents of West 96th Street, where the 49-year-old veteran slept in doorways, menaced passers-by and battered cars.
Mr.
Hogue, who suffers from a brain injury incurred in military service, has been in and out of mental institutions and prisons for 30 years.
Now he is judged healthy enough for release.
But at least mental health and criminal justice officials are struggling to minimize the chances that this is just another spin through the legal revolving door.

Blind Sailor Is Rescued
The attempt by Hank Dekker, the 58-year-old blind sailor from Novato, Calif., to cross the Atlantic Ocean alone in a sailboat, which began Thursday, ended abruptly late Saturday when gear trouble developed aboard his 30-foot yacht.
A satellite tracking system alerted Dekker's sponsor, the National Federation for the Blind in Baltimore, that there was a problem.
After receiving a distress call from the federation at 5:45 P.M.
Saturday, the Coast Guard at Cape May, N.J., sent a rescue helicopter to find Dekker.
He was spotted at 7:43 P.M.
Saturday, the sails down on his boat, about 90 miles east of Atlantic City, Coast Guard officials said.

Perez Offers 1 2/3 Reasons To Worry
Rickey Henderson's sudden presence in Toronto, and his new status as an obstacle in the American League East, may soon be the least of the Yankees' worries.
For a second consecutive Sunday, they had one and two-thirds reasons to be concerned about Melido Perez.
Another uncharacteristically brief and ineffective start by Perez, which led to a 9-2 Yankee loss to Milwaukee and the end of a four-game winning streak, raised questions that could follow the team to the end of a noisy summer in the Bronx.
A crowd of 35,938 fans at the Stadium was reduced to a group of quiet witnesses as the Yankees fell one game behind the division-leading Blue Jays going into the four-game series between the two teams that begins here tonight.


Pop and Jazz in Review
Ozric Tentacles  The Grand
The missing link between the psychedelic rock jams of the 1960's and the free-floating ambient house music of the 1990's is Ozric Tentacles, an English band that performed at the Grand on Monday night.
As moire patterns pulsed and spotlights radiated sunbursts through smoke, the five-man band played instrumentals that evolved from sustained ripples of sound to broad-shouldered rockers, where swoops and echoes from keyboards contended with speed-fingered guitar solos.


Treasury to Auction Only Bills This Week
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week will include only today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.

Review/Music; A Missa Solemnis Light on the Solemn
The story is told that Berlioz, weeping uncontrollably during a moving performance of a Beethoven symphony, was asked by a woman next to him why he continued to listen if it made him so unhappy.
"Madame," he is supposed to have replied, "do you think I am here to enjoy myself?"
I thought of this tale on Saturday night when Roger Norrington conducted the Boston Symphony at Tanglewood in Beethoven's Missa Solemnis.
For Mr.
Norrington argued in the program notes and, ultimately, in the performance itself, that this is precisely why we are listening to this music: to enjoy ourselves.
The Mass, he pointed out, has a reputation for being "very serious, very forbidding, and very difficult to listen to." Instead it should be something "enjoyable." At least three-quarters of the work is filled with "dancing celebration." So intent was Mr.
Norrington on creating an enjoyable experience (this was, he stressed, "a concert rather than a religious service"), he even interrupted the composition after the Gloria for an intermission.


Tokyo Hectic In Response To Europe
A desultory morning of currency trading exploded here early today after European governments mounted another attempt to rescue the European Monetary System, with the German mark soaring in value amid extremely nervous speculation.
Foreign exchange traders used to quiet Monday mornings here said that initially the market had been slow and edgy as the monetary officials met in Brussels in an effort to calm the latest currency crisis.
But shortly after news services flashed word that several European currencies would be permitted to fluctuate in a wider band of values, furious bidding began.

Two Killed in Subway and Train Accidents
Two men were killed and a third was injured yesterday in separate accidents at a Manhattan subway station and a Long Island Rail Road station in Queens.
Those killed remained unidentified last night.
In the Manhattan incident, two men were struck by subway trains about 6:45 P.M. while trying to retrieve a basketball that had fallen onto the tracks at the 33d Street station of the Lexington Avenue line, the transit police said.
One man was hit first by a southbound No. 5 express; the other by a southbound No 6.
Both men were in their 20's, the police said.

Her not uncommon situation is made worse by the state's mandatory Rockefeller drug laws, passed in 1973.

Computers And Pros Hit Boxing With a 1-2
For most sports federations, the Olympic Festival, which ended here this evening, provided national coaches with an opportunity to look at bright young prospects and reload after an Olympic year.
For amateur boxing, however, the 10-day festival was more the continuation of a massive rebuilding project in the aftermath of a disastrous performance in Barcelona during the Summer Olympics.


New Fight Over Release Of Patient
A new legal fight over the release of a mentally ill homeless man who has menaced and frightened residents of the Upper West Side for years was joined yesterday as New York State officials moved to detain him at a psychiatric hospital for up to six more months to allow time to find him a suitable home.
But lawyers for the man, Larry Hogue -- whose release to a son had seemed imminent last week until the son was threatened with eviction -- indicated they would fight any extended detention, and an unusual State Supreme Court hearing was set for 9:30 A.M. today at Creedmore Mental Health Center in Queens, where he has been confined for nearly a year.


COMMANDER WANTS END TO TROOP CUTS
The general in charge of reducing the number of American soldiers in Germany to 65,000 by 1995 says he thinks the number should dip no lower than that.

David M. Maddox, commander of the Army in Europe, said in an interview in his headquarters here.
"I think there is considerable concern that we stop there," he said.

Dinkins Disavows Aide's Comments on Giuliani
Mayor David N. Dinkins disavowed yesterday the remarks of a top campaign aide who said voting for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, would empower racists and the Ku Klux Klan.
The aide continued to stand by his comments but said they had been misunderstood.
Mr.
Dinkins said the aide, Jose Torres, a former boxing champion who is one of three deputy campaign managers, should not have made the remarks and had been told as much by Bill Lynch, the campaign manager.
The Mayor promised to speak directly to Mr.
Torres himself about the matter.


All of Boston Says Goodbye to Lewis
The tribute took shape outside, in the midday heat, as the people waited quietly on St.
Botolph Street to say goodbye to Reggie Lewis.
They moved by the thousands in lines that grew as large as four across along the length of Matthews Arena, where his basketball career had grown at Northeastern University and where the late captain of the Boston Celtics rested in an open casket this morning.
On the day Lewis was laid to rest, his farewell created an extraordinarily diverse collection of admirers whose collective presence transformed an old arena into a cathedral and said as much as the powerful words, music, applause and tears that followed throughout the afternoon.

For the Major 3-Year-Olds, It's Still a Stampede for the 1993 Season
Racing's 3-year-old division is such a free-for-all that Julie Krone even got to wondering about it while she was riding Colonial Affair to the post Sunday for the Jim Dandy Stakes, a race that was supposed to clarify the puzzle but didn't.
"I was sitting there thinking: Who's No. 1?" she said today.
"Most of the 3-year-old colts have won one big race apiece, and they've been beating each other all year. There is no dominant horse. So, I guess we won't find a leader until the Travers, and we certainly won't find a champion until the Breeders' Cup."

Layoff Law Impact Is Almost Nil
Four years and millions of layoffs after Congress enacted the plant closing law of 1988, which required many companies that chopped 50 or more jobs to give their workers 60 days' notice, the law seems to have had virtually no impact.
While few people took literally the Democrats' assertions that the law was a great victory for America's working men and women -- or President Ronald Reagan's warning that it was the "the most anti-competitive, anti-employee, anti-business pieces of legislation to come along in a long time" -- many Americans expected that laid-off workers would have the time to look for new jobs or retrain, and that communities affected would have the time to seek new businesses.

Constitution Covers Members of Congress
To the Editor:
Your July 22 editorial on Representative Dan Rostenkowski is repugnant to any notion of fair play under our Constitution.
Members of the press often assert that their rights under the First Amendment entitle them to a wide range of privileges not afforded the ordinary citizen.
Yet you argue that a member of Congress's assertion of fundamental Constitutional rights makes him unqualified to hold a position of prominence he has fairly and properly earned -- a position in which he has demonstrated great skill and integrity.
The First Amendment is important, but no more than other amendments pertaining to personal rights.


Long Before Flowering Plants, Insects Evolved Ways to Use Them
ON a summer's day, nothing is more natural than the sight of bees and butterflies sticking their heads deep into garden blossoms.
Insects and flowering plants are so evidently made for each other that scientists have long assumed it was the emergence of plants with flowers, or angiosperms, 125 million years ago that led to the sudden flourishing of insects in myriad forms.
This assumption, elevated to conventional wisdom and taught in biology courses, has been challenged in a new, comprehensive study of insect fossils.
The greatest expansion and diversification of insects, it has now been discovered, actually began 120 million years before the advent of angiosperms.
If anything, when flowering plants proliferated, insect diversification slackened.


G.M. Chief Talks to VW On Dispute
The corporate espionage melodrama involving the General Motors Corporation, Volkswagen A.G. and German prosecutors moved to the executive suites today with an overseas telephone conference between top executives of the two auto makers, followed by a G.M. demand that VW retract recent allegations.
David J. Herman, managing director of Adam Opel A.G., G.M.'s German subsidiary, said today that he was willing to continue discussions with VW about data and documents that G.M. contends were stolen by VW's production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former G.M. executive, provided German prosecutors did not object.

NATO to Join U.S. in Planning Air Strikes Against Serbs' Forces
Under pressure from the United States, the NATO allies threatened today to bomb Serbian forces tightening a noose around Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, if the United Nations requested such action.
After 12 hours of meetings by the 16 delegations to overcome objections from Canada and to a lesser extent from Britain, the alliance agreed to begin immediate military preparations for "stronger measures, including air strikes," in coordination with the United Nations.


What Will Protect Us From Managed Care?; One of the Options
To the Editor:
"Empire Scrambles Back" (editorial, July 24) has a positive headline, for which we thank you.
The body of the editorial, however, gives the impression that Empire has made the decision to force its community-rated policyholders into some form of managed care.
This is not the case.
During the interview with your reporter, I discussed various possibilities that might be considered when trying to control health care costs and slow the increase in premium levels.
Managed care, of course, was one of those options.


Just Say No to Clinton's Package
Have you heard about the new White House "diet" plan?

The diet is quite simple.
You can eat anything you want, any time you want, as much as you want.
It costs quite a bit more, but they guarantee you'll lose all the weight you want.
The only catch is you won't see any weight loss for five years.
Does this diet make sense?
Hardly!
But it's about as logical as the deficit reduction scheme President Clinton is pitching.


Student Shot During Class in Bronx High School
An 18-year-old student who was taking a summer course was shot and wounded yesterday when a gunman walked into a high school classroom in the Bronx and opened fire, the authorities said.
The victim, who was grazed on the left side of the head, was taken to Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, where he was treated and released.
His name was not released by the authorities.


No Henderson, No Alomar, No Gaston, No Sweat
The Blue Jays did not need Rickey Henderson last night.

Henderson has not joined the team since being obtained from Oakland on Saturday, and Alomar and Gaston were ejected in the first inning for arguing a third strike.
But the Jays had Devon White batting leadoff one last time against the Yankees, and he was special.
With August pennant fever raging in the Bronx, with 43,304 spectators at Yankee Stadium on a muggy evening, with advertisements touting this four-game series as the "Summer Showdown," and with Jim Abbott and Todd Stottlemyre matching zeros for five innings, White interrupted the tidy affair by lacing a two-run homer in the sixth that vaulted the Jays to a 4-0 victory.

Just when Paris designers are opting to abandon their tents and head underground to a show space at the Louvre, New York is building its own three-ring circus for fashion.

There will be two canvas tents, at the east and west boundaries of Bryant Park: the Gertrude Pavilion, with 974 seats and 164 standing-room places, and the Josephine Pavilion, with 506 seats and 96 places to stand.
The third runway is to be in the Celeste Bartos Forum, inside the library, which seats 500 with 100 standing-room places.

Community Board Gets Its No in Early

"Public transportation to the railyards does not exist, while the current stadium in the Bronx is very accessible by subway," said the letter from the board, which voted, 34-1, last week against the site proposed by Cuomo in case a lease extension cannot be worked out to keep the Yankees, owned by GEORGE STEINBRENNER, at Yankee Stadium.

Yellow-winged butterflies flit through the long grasses in this village above Sarajevo, and the orchards are ripening with apples, pears and plums.
Off in the distance, the mountain sites of the 1984 Winter Olympics shimmer in a blue haze, the ski trails like ribbons cut into the thickly wooded slopes.
On a balmy summer day, Jezera hardly seems like a place to die.
But only a few hundred yards from the village, up a slope to a grassy knoll called Golo Brdo, or Naked Hill, a ferocious battle is being waged that may seal the fate of Sarajevo.

He is already jittery about his defending Super Bowl champions although the first regular-season game is still a month away and quarterback Troy Aikman and running back Emmitt Smith are out of action.
The Minnesota Vikings inflicted a 13-7 defeat on the Dallas Cowboys Sunday night in Irving, Tex., and Johnson acted as if someone had stolen his Super Bowl ring.
"It would be very easy to say we'll be fine when the season starts," said a red-faced Johnson, whose team leaves for London today for next Sunday's American Bowl game against the Detroit Lions.
"We need a sense of urgency on this team. It will be difficult to correct in next week's practices, but it will be corrected when we get back to Austin." What Johnson wants to correct is five turnovers, three lost fumbles and two interceptions that kept the Cowboys from mounting any serious offense.
However, the Cowboys will get only two days of hard work in London.
Johnson didn't make any excuses for his tired team, which had three days of scrimmages against the Los Angeles Raiders and a scrimmage with the Houston Oilers just before they played the Vikings. (AP)

College Dropout to Camp Drop-In
Walter Payton had told friends here that the Hall of Fame ceremonies would be more like an afterthought, like a Christmas present he had already received in July.

But Saturday in Canton, Ohio, Payton reversed field as beautifully as he had on any of his exhilarating Bears runs in Soldier Field.

Mystery of Sleep Yields as Studies Reveal Immune Tie
A COLLEGE student goes two nights without sleep to cram for exams and on the third day comes down with a cold.
A night-shift employee begins working days and gets the flu.
A surgery patient who is awakened four times a night in the hospital begins to recover only after going home and getting a good night's sleep.
Are these situations coincidental?
Or do they show that sleep loss promotes illness?
Despite intense interest in the question, sleep researchers have been hard pressed to show exactly how sleep influences human health and disease.


TV Campaign Unveiled to Build Hevesi Image
Alan G. Hevesi, the State Assemblyman challenging City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman in the Democratic primary next month, began a television advertising campaign last night intended to introduce a candidate few voters seem to know.

Molitor Gets Chance This Time Around
The last time the Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays were so close to each other and played a meaningful series this late in the season was in 1985.
They played two series in September that season, the first one in New York, the second in Toronto that ended the season and made the Blue Jays American League East champions.
The New York series made Dave Winfeld Mr.
May.
Paul Molitor was not a part of those games.
He spent September mired in the depths of the division, wallowing with the rest of the Milwaukee Brewers up to 31 games behind the leaders.
Baseball economics, however, have conspired to make Molitor a part of the confrontation that began at Yankee Stadium last night.


Levee Breached to Save An 18th-Century Village
In a dramatic bit of flood triage, local officials and the Army Corps of Engineers decided early today to break a hole in the main Mississippi River levee near here in an effort to save this 18th-century French village and other towns downriver.
The officials hope that the deliberate breaching of the levee, which will flood about 44,000 acres of agricultural bottom land, will create a buffer of water that will slow the swift torrent cascading from levee breaks just upriver, ripping apart farmhouses and businesses.
Protecting the Village
Mathew Hunn, an official of the Army Corps of Engineers, said the deliberate break along the Harrisonville-Stringtown-Fort Chartres levee just north of this historic village of 700 people would also ease the pressure on the levees protecting the village.
Those levees run nearly perpendicular to the Mississippi River along Prairie du Rocher Creek, a tiny tributary feeding into the river just north of the village.


Bridge
A star-studded team led by Dick Freeman of Atlanta won the prestigious Spingold Knockout Team championship here on Sunday at the conclusion of the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals.
The Freeman team included Nick Nickell of Raleigh, N.C., who was winning his first major team title, and four of the world's best players: Bob Hamman and Bob Wolff of Dallas, Jeff Meckstroth of Tampa, Fla., and Eric Rodwell of Naperville, Ill.
They took the lead at the start of the final and were never threatened, winning by 60 imps.

Chess
In the common situation where several players are tied for the lead in the last round of a tournament, the advantage lies with those who have a positional rather than an attacking style.
The former can quietly press to win as they usually do without overextending themselves.
Thus, if they don't succeed in this primary objective, they have good chances of holding a draw and achieving a tie for first place.
Those players who rely on their skill in attack ordinarily cannot help but make heavy commitments that are difficult to reverse if things start to go wrong.
For them, it is a matter of all or nothing.

Subaru's problems show that a breakthrough campaign, by itself, can't always revive a product.
IN the aftermath of Subaru of America's abrupt sacking of Wieden &amp; Kennedy, a subversive question keeps being raised: What's advertising got to do with it?
The auto maker's startling decision to dismiss Wieden, which has handled the nearly $100 million account for only two years, will end one of the most closely watched, contentiously debated agency-client relationships in advertising.
The campaigns created by Wieden, the risk-taking hot shop out of Portland, Ore., were decried early and often by many executives in the automotive and advertising industries.
They complained that the ads sacrificed basic principles of selling automobiles, like flattering product shots in television commercials, for showy creative efforts carrying the emphatic, though enigmatic, theme of "What to drive."


Gaza Bus Hijacking Kills One
A Palestinian believed to be a Muslim militant hijacked a United Nations bus in the occupied Gaza Strip today and smashed into two Israeli vehicles, killing one person and wounding five, police and United Nations spokesmen said.
In Gaza, the militant group known as Islamic Holy War asserted responsibility for the attack, which came a day before the arrival of Secretary of State Warren Christopher here on an effort to revive the stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks.
Palestinian militants have mounted similar attacks before previous rounds of negotiations.

Lawyer Sets Insanity Plea In L.I. Case
In a move that came as no surprise to prosecutors, the lawyer for Joel Rifkin, the unemployed landscaper suspected of killing 17 women, said today that he planned to use an insanity defense based on several psychiatric examinations of his client that occurred in July.
Robert Sale, Mr.

Rifkin's mental condition, but he said that the evaluations "confirm the propriety and efficacy of such a defense." Mr.
Sale added that he was not conceding that Mr.

THE BUDGET BILL: A Fading Call to Arms; Clinton Wins a Crucial Fight on the Deficit, But Some of the Sense of Mission Is Lost
President Clinton took office with three goals for the economy.
He wanted to reduce the annual budget deficit, stimulate the economy to create jobs and redirect the priorities of the Government.
In his speech to a joint session of Congress last February laying out his economic program, the President called for tough choices and shared sacrifices, for fundamental changes that he said would make the tax system fairer and direct Government spending to the programs where it would do the most good.
"Our nation needs a new direction," he declared.


Market Place; Central Banks Make It Easy To Bet Big on a Sure Thing
Once again, European central banks have given away hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars.
The recipients were currency traders, speculators and all the others who thought it profitable, or just prudent, to sell overvalued currencies to the central banks.
The latest failure of Europe's attempt to sort-of-fix exchange rates in the face of hostile markets emphasized the profits that can be made, at minimal risk, from currency crises.
And it again raised the question of why European governments, which end up paying the losses of their central banks, have been so willing to put up with a system that makes such losses a periodic inevitability.

"We've installed 65 to 70 percent of the defense, and he's missed all the practice reps and snaps that a youngster needs. Never is a long time, but I can't see him catching up this year."

Also cited by analysts as reasons for yesterday's gains were the recovery in 30-year Treasury bonds, favorable data from the National Association of Purchasing Managers and general anticipation that President Clinton's deficit-reduction proposals would be passed by Congress this week.
As a result, the mood on Wall Street was generally upbeat and all of the major market indicators advanced.

The ruins, which are in a few miles of each other and date back to the classical period, were found in the jungle region of the Monkey River by an expedition supported by the society.

For Fish, an Outboard Motor at the Rear
A RESEARCHER at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia has turned a theory about how fish generate power for swimming on its head -- or tail, perhaps.
The mechanical power a fish uses for swimming is generated by muscle contractions.
Previous modeling had led scientists to conclude that muscles in the front half of the fish formed a "motor" to produce that power, which was then transferred along the length of the fish to its tail, or "propeller."

One elaborate foldout ad even offers smokers a challenge kit: tiny labels to cover brand names on Winston Select Lights and Marlboro Lights cigarettes when trying both to "choose your idea of smooth."

Meal Tax to Aid Miami's Homeless
Metropolitan Miami will soon begin imposing a 1 percent tax on restaurant meals to finance programs for the homeless, an action that experts on homelessness say breaks new ground but that the tourist industry opposes.
The move is a response to a Federal court order that Miami provide help for its homeless.


THE BUDGET BILL: Back Home; Letter Writers Lay Down Their Pens as Vote Nears
Though some members of Congress are wringing their hands over whether to vote for a budget bill that includes higher energy taxes and other contentious items, they are, to their surprise, not hearing a lot from their constituents.
And with a few significant exceptions, Washington's major lobbying organizations are mounting only limited campaigns against the proposal -- or none at all.


Review/Opera; Diverse Crowd Gathers For a Verdi Rarity
The audience that gathered for a New York Grand Opera production in Central Park last Tuesday night was a classical-music marketer's dream: youthful, ethnically diverse, generous at the concession stands.
It stayed more or less intact for over three hours, following the action intently; there were even some Arsenio Hall-like yelps from the bleachers when Vincent La Selva, the conductor, came on for the final act.
Alas, the opera was "Aroldo," one of the less spine-tingling entries in the Verdi canon.
The Grand Opera deserves credit for tackling the piece, which had never been given a full staging in New York, but there are better venues for exploring opera rarities than Central Park on a humid summer evening.

Review/Television; Is It Art? Is It a Dollar? It's a Judgment Call
Whether J. S. G. Boggs is making money the old-fashioned way or a newfangled way, it is his own way.
You can see him on "Money Man," turning out something that looks like United States currency on his drawing board.
You don't have to be much of a sleuth to discern that a Boggs bill differs in many particulars from the kind produced by ordinary counterfeiters, not to mention by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
Just for starters, he leaves one side almost blank and has been known to print "Willy" under a portrait of President William McKinley and "Undertaker" under what may or may not be a facsimile signature of the Treasurer of the United States.

Cuban Dissident, in the U.S., Says Embargo Is a Mistake
In ardently spoken five-minute bursts, Cuba's most prominent political dissident often finds himself railing these days against the disaster he says is looming over his country.
But rather than attacking the Government of Fidel Castro, a target of his criticism for more than two decades, the dissident, Elisardo Sanchez Santa Cruz, has spent much of his time during a rare visit to the United States reproaching Washington for what he sees as its immutable determination to isolate his country through a 30-year-old economic embargo.

Where else but in Washington would they serve up something called the "ethical lunch?" At Ristorante Tiberio on K Street, the tab for lunch is $19.99, a way to help diners to abide by a change in regulations.
The Office of Government Ethics in February lifted a restriction barring Federal officials from accepting any meal or gift from lobbyists, journalists or anyone else who may benefit from the contact.
Instead, the agency limited the cost of such meals to $20, with an overall ceiling of $50 a year from any one source.

Manufacturing Outlook: Still Tepid
The outlook for the nation's manufacturing sector improved only slightly in July, according to an influential survey of purchasing managers released yesterday.
The National Association of Purchasing Management in Tempe, Ariz., reported its monthly index of economic activity was 49.5 percent in July, compared with 48.3 percent in June.
Under its method, any rating below 50 percent suggests that manufacturing contracted, even though numbers above 44.5 percent may indicate overall economic improvement.


Corrections
An article last Tuesday about Justice Edwin Torres of State Supreme Court in Manhattan and the film "Carlito's Way," which is based on his novels, misstated his role in the trial of six youths accused of raping and beating a jogger in Central Park in April 1989.
Justice Thomas B. Galligan presided, not Justice Torres, although Justice Torres had been in a pool of five judges who might have been used in the case.

SCIENTIST AT WORK: Graham Hawkes; Racing to the Bottom Of the Deep, Black Sea
AS a boy growing up in London in the early 1950's, then as a young engineer, Graham Hawkes often regretted having been born too late to join the machine-shop daredevils who flew into the sky on a shoestring and, almost as an afterthought, founded the aviation industry.
That melancholy gave way as Mr.
Hawkes discovered the challenge of the emerging field of undersea engineering.
His pioneering ideas soon made him one of the world's top designers of diving suits, submarines and undersea robots and helped him start a number of successful companies.

As a result, Macy's said in its monthly report to the United States Bankruptcy Court, it is "approaching the fall season very cautiously."

THE BUDGET BILL: Breaking Away; Milk Cows? Udder Disease? Budget Talks Take a Detour
As the budget conferees' long struggle to reach an agreement neared an end today, some found themselves deadlocked over an issue that seemed a curious subject for a budget debate: whether the use of bovine growth hormone should be banned for a year.
Lobbyists on both sides of the question jostled outside the Congressional conference room to press their views.
Some told the conferees that banning the use of the cow hormone for a year would preserve family farms and reduce the threat of bovine udder disease.
Others said a ban would knock the nation's young biotechnology industry off its feet.


Citing Safety, Toll Takers Try to Block New System
A futuristic method of collecting highway tolls that would let cars zip through the booths while a computer charges the driver's account has run into a pedestrian problem: How are the toll takers supposed to cross the lanes if the cars don't stop?
The New York State Thruway Authority began collecting some passenger-car tolls electronically yesterday at the Spring Valley toll plaza, but the toll collectors' union, citing safety issues, won an injunction on Friday that has blocked the authority from using special lanes that would speed the cars through.

Albania Crumbles Into a 'Least Developed' Nation
Albania has no economy to speak of, an unemployment rate of about 40 percent of the remaining work force after about one-tenth of the population has fled abroad to find work, few public services and pervasive poverty of a degree not seen in Europe since World War II.
The railroad no longer functions, and buses are rare.
There never was an airline.
Hospitals lack virtually everything, and schools have no textbooks since 27 million of the heavily ideological books of the past were scrapped.
The United Nations has classified Albania as a "least-developed nation," the only one ever in Europe.

Chemists and pharmaceutical experts at the San Francisco and Santa Barbara campuses of the university say that a computer-designed molecule based on the buckyball has been shown by laboratory tests to inhibit the action of an enzyme needed by the virus to reproduce.

Review/Music; A Musical Gumbo Out of New Orleans Comes to Jones Beach
The annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is such a great party that its promoters decided to take it on the road.
Festival New Orleans, which ended a six-week tour with a show at Jones Beach Theater in Wantagh, L.I., on Sunday evening, picked up the main elements of its parent festival: music, food and crafts.
When the best musicians were onstage, the six-hour show went a long way toward exporting the Big Easy; call it Nolapalooza.
But there was a snag.
Like a Broadway road show, Festival New Orleans depended largely on second-string performers.
Only Buckwheat Zydeco, a clattering, steaming, chugging accordion-driven blues-rock band, and Beausoleil, a fiddle-topped Acadian (Cajun) rock band, are at the top of their genres.
Most of the other performers had some New Orleans rhythm but not first-rate songs.
Still, Festival New Orleans provided nearly nonstop syncopation.

Going, Going, Sold: Orioles Auctioned for $173 Million
In a spirited and steadily soaring auction, a group headed by a Baltimore lawyer and a Cincinnati investment banker bought the Baltimore Orioles baseball team yesterday for $173 million in a sale forced by the bankruptcy of the Orioles' owner.
The price is the highest ever paid for a professional sports team in the United States.
Judge Cornelius Blackshear conducted the auction in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, and his desire to get the most money possible for the creditors of Eli Jacobs, a New York venture capitalist, sent the sale price even higher after the auction appeared to have ended.


Lawsuit Specter Grows
Vince Coleman, the Mets' left fielder who ignited a firecracker nine days ago in the vicinity of about 100 Dodger Stadium fans, now faces the possibility of seven lawsuits.
The number grew by four today, according to Coleman's attorney, Bob Shapiro.
Last week, the parents of 2-year-old girl who suffered a cornea injury, the parents of a 13-year-old boy who suffered shin lacerations and a 33-year-old woman who aggravated an inner ear problem all planned to sue Coleman.
Today, Shapiro said four children who were with the boy, Marshall Savoy, are also expected to take legal action.

Carlton H. Lee Jr., 35, AIDS Panel Lobbyist
Carlton H. Lee Jr., the Congressional liaison officer for the National Commission on AIDS and a key figure in Congressional approval of civil rights legislation affecting people with AIDS and other disabilities, died on Friday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh.
He was 35 years old.
Mr.
Lee, who was known by his friends as Sonny, contracted hepatitis B when he served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierre Leone, West Africa, from 1981 to 1986.
The commission said he had a toxic reaction to an experimental drug that he was taking as part of a clinical trial by the National Institutes of Health.


Review/Opera; Glimmerglass Offers a Fresh Look at 'Werther'
The Glimmerglass Opera's reliance on young Americans represents both virtue and necessity.
Beginning professionals -- the kinds one hears as finalists at the Metropolitan Opera Auditions or as stars in advanced student productions -- tend to end up a year or so later at way stations like this one.
The voices are fresh, and some quite finished.
Where they are not, overwork or bad technique have not had time to do their damage.
Such singers are also affordable to a company that, with a budget of a little over $2 million, must bear the costs of a resident orchestra, four ambitious productions, artists' housing and a five-week season played in repertory.
Talent is repaid not with high fees but through a kind of artistic barter: sophisticated productions, public exposure and a training program that offers advancement.

Where Muslims and Jews Live Together in Peace; In Heart of Brooklyn, Two Devoutly Religious Communities Find Common Ground
Every Friday at noon, as Jews bustle about Avenue J in Midwood, Brooklyn, preparing for the Sabbath eve meal and stroll to the synagogue, where thoughts turn toward Jerusalem, the Muslims of Midwood are at Jumu'a, the weekly gathering of the faithful at the mosque, invoking the blessings of Allah and genuflecting toward Mecca.
That these worshipers from brother religions live in the same community, reap the rewards of commerce and share many spiritual values, should not, ideally, be surprising.

Ross, Still Bobbing and Weaving
You'd think that by now Ross Perot could keep a few basic facts in his very own head.
We're not asking for much, just a few numbers that would help ordinary folks understand how he intends to do the one thing he says Bill Clinton can't do, which is to bring the budget deficit to zero.
After all, this is a man who's been talking economics day and night for two years, usually with a pointer and charts.
But without the charts, Mr.
Perot can't remember a thing.
The funny thing about those charts is that they're never there when somebody else wants to consult them.
They're always within easy reach when Mr.
Perot wants to show the weaknesses in Mr.
Clinton's ideas.
But ask him a pointed question about his ideas and darned if he didn't leave his charts back on the kitchen table.

Sunbeam-Oster Picks Chief To Replace Ousted Leader
The Sunbeam-Oster Company today elected Roger W. Schipke, the chairman of Ryland Group, as its new chief executive, ending a seven-month search set off in January when Sunbeam's board abruptly ousted the controversial chairman who had rescued the company from bankruptcy.
Just last week, Sunbeam, the maker of small home appliances, paid the former chairman, Paul B. Kazarian, $160 million for his stake in the company.
More significantly, that purchase also settled a $3.2 billion lawsuit filed against Sunbeam by Mr.
Kazarian in June.
He had charged the company with conspiring to overthrow him, denying him earnings owed and smearing his reputation.

Review/Music; City Opera's 'Boheme' Making Its Last Rounds
In the old-home week that begins the New York City Opera's 50th-anniversary season, the second presentation was Puccini's "Boheme," on Thursday evening at the New York State Theater.
And this is the oldest home of all, itself spanning more than half the company's history.
Cynthia Auerbach's modest production, with sets and costumes by Lloyd Evans, entered the City Opera repertory in 1966 and is now back for the last time, in five performances.
The production has served the company well even in its dingy state of recent years; dinginess is, after all, to the point in this story.
The broad strokes are made effectively, and Beth Greenberg's stage direction, despite occasional hokeyness, poses relatively few obstacles for good singers or actors when they turn up.

From the outset, the case against the Bank of Credit and Commerce International has not suffered from a lack of superlatives.

It led to the indictment of Clark M. Clifford, one of Washington's most successful and influential power brokers.
Mr.

St. Louis Defenses Contain Flood As Crest Is Lower Than Predicted
The Mississippi River all but consumed villages and farmland to the north and south of here today, but St.

The havoc suffered in the smaller towns along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers proved to be this city's gain: Unexpected breaks in levees outside the city helped reduce the pressure of the Mississippi and bring down its crest, which ran below the most dire predictions made over the weekend as it passed the landmark Gateway Arch here.

Haiti's Man of Destiny Awaiting His Hour
For most of the 22 months since he was ousted from Haiti's presidency in a military coup, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide has been something of a celebrity in Washington, running his government-in-exile from rented Georgetown apartments and lecturing audiences about the urgent need to free his troubled country.
Now, after arduous negotiations with the same military leaders who toppled him, the frail, soft-spoken Catholic priest is poised to go home.
And the nagging question for the Clinton Administration as Father Aristide prepares his return 13 weeks from now is whether he will be able to make the transition from martyr to statesman.


A Timely Threat on Bosnia
You can read it on the front page.
Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have been proclaiming this week that Bill Clinton is getting tough.
First a greenhorn State Department spokesman said the United States would use air strikes to defend Sarajevo whether or not NATO allies agreed.
Then President Clinton said it wasn't exactly like that.
Then one of those handy nameless officials said, oh, yes, it was.
O.K., so it wasn't pretty to watch.
These days, you take signs of White House resolve -- of any kind, on any issue -- where you can find them.
And on this issue, the Clinton Administration is picking the right time to try to threaten convincingly.

Shooter's Island to Be Wildlife Sanctuary
There is a spot, just one, where you can walk from New York City to New Jersey without getting your feet wet.
But yesterday Mayor David N. Dinkins signed an agreement with the mayors of Bayonne and Elizabeth so that the only feet that make the trip will belong to wading birds.
The spot is Shooter's Island, in the Kill van Kull, a body of water that most geography buffs would swear divides Staten Island from New Jersey.
But overaggressive use of landfill in the last century added 7.5 acres to the island on the Bayonne side, and 1.2 acres in Elizabeth.

The issue: for or against independence from Britain.

President's National Service Legislation Is Approved by Senate
The Senate today passed the national service bill, the first of the major programs that President Clinton promised in his campaign, and sent it to what is expected to be a very fast conference with the House, which has passed its own version.
The Senate voted 58 to 41 to approve the measure, which will encourage community service in two main ways.
One is full-time national service for adults who will receive up to $9,470 in educational grants when they finish and a minimum-wage living allowance while they serve, and the other is through projects for schoolchildren.


Chevy Chase Chosen For Frito-Lay Spots
What is it with Frito-Lay and late-night talk show hosts?
The company, which used Jay Leno in commercials for its Doritos brand of tortilla chips from 1986 to 1990, said yesterday that it had signed Chevy Chase, who will begin appearing next month on a talk show for the Fox Broadcasting network, as a spokesman for its Doritos Tortilla Thins brand of chips.
Though terms of Mr.
Chase's contract were not disclosed, Advertising Age estimated in June that he would be paid $3 million.
Mr.
Chase, whose program, "The Chevy Chase Show," begins on Sept. 7, is starring in his first advertising campaign; the first of three commercials, created by BBDO New York, is scheduled to appear tomorrow night during a "Tribute to Michael Jordan" on NBC.
In the spot, Mr.
Chase performs some acrobatic stunts as he rescues a bag of chips from a frail eldery woman about to be crushed by a steamroller.
The spot carries the theme "Grab 'em," which replaces the one used to introduce the brand in March, "America, your chip has come in."


American Winner No Longer Favored
After upsetting American Winner last Saturday, Pine Chip has been installed as the even-money favorite against his chief rival in their elimination heat of the Hambletonian Saturday afternoon at the Meadowlands.
Before last Saturday night, any 3-year-old trotter being favored over American Winner in harness racing's showcase event would have been unthinkable.
Then Pine Chip, with John Campbell driving, set a record for a night-time trotting mile when he captured the Budweiser Beacon Course final in 1:534/5 at the Meadowlands.

DEMJANJUK RETURN IS BACKED IN RULING BY APPEALS COURT
Five days after he was acquitted by the Israeli Supreme Court on charges that he was among the most brutal of the Holocaust's war criminals, John Demjanjuk won a major victory today when a Federal appeals court here ruled that he must be permitted to return to the United States.
The appeals court, which had reopened the case last year on its own initiative, criticized the Justice Department, calling its prosecution "careless at the very least." It also aggressively questioned how Attorney General Janet Reno could have supported the legal position that Mr.
Demjanjuk (pronounced dem-ahn-YUKE) should remain banished from the United States while the Federal courts reconsider their earlier order that had stripped him of his American citizenship.
A Return to Ohio
The decision today means that Mr.
Demjanjuk, a 73-year-old retired auto worker who was extradited to Israel in 1986 to face war-crime charges, will very likely wind up returning to his family in Ohio.
He remains in a small prison cell near Tel Aviv for eight more days while the Israeli Government decides what to do with him.
American prosecutors asked the court to stay its ruling so it could appeal it.
But the court denied the request to await further review and its decision may make it impossible for American officials to block his return.


Transcript of Tapes Reveals Sheik Talked of Merits of Bomb Targets
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman talked with his followers of the merits of targeting various buildings in a terrorist bombing plot and advised them to prepare carefully and "go slow," according to Government transcripts of secretly taped conversations with an F.B.I. informer.
The transcript records a meeting in the early-morning hours of May 23 in which the sheik responded to questions from the informer, Emad Salem.
Also present were several other men, including Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, a prime suspect in the plot. 'House of Devil'
At the meeting, Mr.
Salem asked Mr.
Abdel Rahman if, under Islamic law, the United Nations should be considered the "house of the devil" and could be a target of "action."

In America; The Real Jobless Rate
The Federal Government will release its latest unemployment figures on Friday.
But behind the official statistics is a truer picture -- a scarier picture -- of the nation's employment crisis.
Crowded into this picture are the millions of Americans (there are no precise totals) who have become discouraged and stopped looking for work, who are working part time but would like to work full time, who are working at jobs beneath their education or skill level, who are working at temporary jobs, who have set up some form of self-employment because they can't find other work, who are living on severance and savings and don't know what the future holds, who have retired prematurely, and on and on.

The Pop Life
McDonald Blinks
"Blink of an Eye" (Reprise) is the new album by Michael McDonald, whose soulful style influenced a generation of male pop crooners.
But the record may surprise some people.
"I think a lot of people expected me to go in and try to keep up with the newer R-and-B material," said the singer, who lives in Santa Barbara, Calif.
"Everybody kind of really wants to convince you to do what it is that's working best for them at the moment and to write with the writers they're getting hits with. What's really happening in Los Angeles is the South-Central feel, hip-hop and dance-oriented music, which I enjoy. But I didn't feel that was the next logical step for me as an artist and I might be perceived as trying to keep up with whatever is new. I wanted to break away from that."


Titan Lost Payload: Spy-Satellite System Worth $800 Million
The explosion of a Titan IV rocket over the Pacific on Monday destroyed its secret payload, an $800 million spy-satellite system, wiping out most of the savings Congress took from the intelligence budget this year and damaging the nation's most expensive espionage program, Government and intelligence officials said today.
"Every penny we cut is gone," said a Senator who fought to cut an additional $700 million from the budget for spy-satellite programs requested by the Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey.
The cost of replacing the destroyed system would exceed the savings wrung from Mr.
Woolsey by the Congressional intelligence committees last month.

The Third Reich went down in flames in 1945, but its personalities continue to provide plots for authors of suspense fiction in the 1990's.
And for good reasons: it's hard to invent greater crimes than those committed by Nazi Germany, and the mere mention of Hitler's henchmen instantly conveys villainy to the reader.


Pregnancy Monitors: Lifesavers or Costly Gadgets?
BECAUSE this reporter was at high risk of having a premature baby, my obstetrician started me on a home uterine-monitoring program in the 24th week of my pregnancy, in the hope of detecting and forestalling early labor.
For two hours each day for the next 12 weeks, I lay down and fastened a belt containing a pressure sensor around my abdomen to pick up contractions in the uterus underneath.
Once a day, I hooked the monitor into the phone and sent signals representing the two hours of tracings to a nurse, who scanned them and reported the results.
I got a few minutes of praise and encouragement if the tracings were good or advice and an order to repeat the process if there were too many contractions.

Stray Whale Is Herded Toward Uncertain Fate
A wayward whale that had been circling in shallow waters off Pelham Bay Park for four days was herded toward deeper water farther east in Long Island Sound yesterday.
But its long-term health and safety was by no means assured, as it battled illness, disorientation and the curiosity of well-meaning New Yorkers.
Volunteers and researchers from the Okeanos Ocean Research Foundation, which helps rescue stranded marine animals, were able to push the long-fin pilot whale out of a shallow cove hours before low tide would have left it beached.
But as night fell, the whale was in waters only 20 feet deep, still far from the open ocean it must reach to survive.


Wine Talk
E ACH week's mail brings notice of yet another wine conference.
Or wine symposium.
Or judging.
Or festival.
Few of these gatherings seem to concern themselves with the simple enjoyment of wine -- which is why I routinely throw out the invitations, including one from the International Pinot Noir Celebration, held in Oregon.
A mistake.
I should have looked closer.
Fortunately, word trickled down.
Gerald Asher laid it out in Gourmet magazine a few months ago.
He talked of "the gaiety of the event and its lack of pretension." Of drinking wine for pleasure.


Polygram Records to Buy Motown
Polygram Records said yesterday that it would acquire Motown Records, the legendary record label that spawned the careers of many of the nation's great black singers and was a notable model for black-run businesses, for $301 million.
Founded in 1959 by Berry Gordy, Motown has included among its stars Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, the Supremes, the Jackson Five, Lionel Richie, the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson.
Polygram is acquiring a current roster of more than 30 artists, a catalogue of 30,000 master recordings dating from the 1960's to the present and other assets.


THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: The White House; CLINTON PUSHES FOR BUDGET, REASSURING PUBLIC ON TAXES AND VOWING ECONOMIC GAINS
Declaring that "it would be irresponsible not to take decisive action" to reduce the budget deficit, President Clinton appealed to middle-class taxpayers tonight to support the economic plan that will face crucial votes in Congress this week.
"We're on the verge of breaking out of the old false choice between tax and spend and trickle down, between abandonment and entitlement," Mr.
Clinton said.
He brandished colored bar graphs to support his insistence that the plan is fair and includes genuine cuts in Federal spending.  [ Transcript of the President's address, page A14. ]


No Need for More Unemployed College Grads; Misguided Policies
To the Editor:
Robert Reich's proposed solutions to unemployment in the United States and the industrialized economies (Op-Ed, July 20) miss the mark: Jobs are not being created and upgraded because of the costs Government imposes on the job creators in the private sector, particularly the small and medium-size businesses that create the majority of the jobs.
Government regulation and taxes create a wedge between what it costs a business to employ a worker and the net benefit a worker receives.
Any increase in this wedge raises the cost of hiring new workers and reduces the net wages workers receive.
In addition, overgenerous Government welfare and social benefit programs like those in Europe make nonwork more attractive than work.

Two Men Are Found Dead At Stamford Research Lab
Two longtime employees of American Cyanamid were found dead this morning in a small room at the company's research laboratory here after co-workers heard gunshots.
The authorities described the deaths as a murder-suicide and said they were looking into the possibility that they resulted from a dispute between a worker and his supervisor.
But investigators declined to speculate on who fired the fatal shots, pending the outcome of an autopsy on Wednesday.

No Need for More Unemployed College Grads; Who Is Protected
To the Editor:
Robert Reich (Op-Ed July 20) makes a distinction between the more and less educated segments of the American work force.
His answer for less educated workers is to raise their education and skill levels.
A more useful distinction would be between those who are forced to compete against workers in the third world and those protected from such low-wage competition.


N.F.L. TRAINING CAMP REPORT
Denver Broncos
An inner-ear problem will keep linebacker Karl Mecklenburg out of the Denver Broncos' four preseason games, and a doctor has told him that more damage could end his career.
Mecklenburg said he expected to start in the Broncos' season opener against the Jets on Sept. 5.
But he risks permanent hearing loss in his right ear if he continues to injure a membrane, he said yesterday.


Federal Employees Given Coverage for Abortions
For the first time in a decade, Federal employees will be able to obtain abortions paid for by their health insurance policies after abortion rights supporters won a critical vote in the Senate today.
But opponents of abortion insisted that they would not let today's action be a precedent for what is covered under national health care legislation President Clinton is expected to propose this fall.

Reviews/Television; Onstage at the Apollo, Competitive Tribute
For six decades, the Apollo Theater has been the proving ground for black performers.
Lately, the place has rarely missed a chance to remind people of its history, bringing back both those who performed there regularly and newcomers who hope the legend will rub off on them.
"The Apollo Theater Hall of Fame," tonight at 9 on NBC, is the latest history lesson, tribute and hodgepodge from the Harlem landmark, with Ray Charles, Diana Ross, B. B. King, Eric Clapton, Al Green and more than a dozen other performers.
The occasion is the induction of the first members of the new Apollo Hall of Fame, all of whom performed at the theater before 1956: Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and the Ink Spots.
Each gets a tribute from younger performers.
Special Chairman's Awards, whatever they are, are also dedicated to Mr.
Charles, Mr.
King, Richard Pryor and Sam Cooke, providing an opportunity for more tributes and a blues jam session.


Long Shot Gains Hope Of Proving A Surprise
At lunch, in a large Puerto Rican restaurant near his home in the Kingsbridge Heights section of the Bronx, Roberto Ramirez sipped his fifth cup of coffee of the day and reflected on the defiance of expectations.
"The conventional wisdom was that I, as a Puerto Rican who came here at age 19 without knowing a word of English, should never have gone to college, should never have gone to law school and should never have been elected to the State Assembly," Mr.
Ramirez said.
"One of my greatest assets is that I have always been underestimated."

Beyond the Powwow, The Goal Is College
For 28 Chippewa Indian high school students in northern Minnesota, summer has been a time for learning.
In a five-week course that ended last week, they studied biology, computer science, psychology and algebra -- and woodland pottery, photography and native medicine.
They attended an Ojibwa powwow and helped stage a film festival, "Wind and Glacier Voices."
The aim is to prepare the students for college and, beyond that, for leadership of their tribes and communities.
The program, at Bemidji State University, is modeled on the Native American Preparatory School at Irvine, Calif.
Support comes from a variety of foundations.
Teachers and administrators are recruited from reservations; the principal is Erma J. Vizenor, a Chippewa from the White Earth Reservation who graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.


Khmer Rouge Violence Said to Signal Goals
The Khmer Rouge rebels have stepped up a campaign of post-election violence in Cambodia in what diplomats and United Nations peacekeepers believe is an effort to convince other Cambodian factions that it would be dangerous to exclude them from the new coalition Government.
United Nations officials said today that it appeared that the Maoist-inspired rebels were responsible for a train ambush in southern Cambodia on Monday afternoon in which at least 10 people were killed and 30 wounded.
Peacekeeping troops said the train ran over mines laid on the track and was then raked with gunfire and shoulder-held rockets.
The ambush took place about 14 miles east of Kampot, on an antiquated railway line that has often been the scene of guerrilla attacks.

Flinty, Revered Teacher of Chefs
MADELEINE KAMMAN is either the most brilliant, gifted, warm-hearted cooking teacher in America or a brutally frank, ungenerous, obsessive perfectionist.
Proof of the latter, her critics say, is that she has never gotten along with Julia Child, a woman with few detractors.
It is her difficult personality, critics contend, that has prevented her from attaining the celebrity accorded Mrs.
Child, although she has written seven cookbooks, all still in print, and stars in cooking shows that are still seen on television.
Her admirers are equally adamant about her virtues.
They say no one has done more to teach chefs the fundamentals of cooking.


Landeta's Hang Time May Come Before Long
After a season of doubt, despair and rehabilitation, the Giants' Sean Landeta is trying to regain the form that has made him the National Football League's eighth-ranking career punter with a 43.4-yard average.
So far, so good, which pleases everyone here at the Giants' camp because there are always fears that a 31-year-old kicker in his 12th pro season has few punts left.
The 1992 season, although a loss from the beginning for the Giants, had started off well for Landeta.
He was coming off big games against the Denver Broncos (six punts for a 51-yard average) and the Green Bay Packers (five punts for a 52.4-yard average).

Compaq Printer Can Tell You What's Ailing It
When a computer printer turns out a blurry and smeared page, a confounded user is most likely to phone the manufacturer's customer-support staff for advice.
But not Dan Lee.
His Compaq laser printer contains artificial-intelligence software that can diagnose and unravel printer problems and tell the user what to do.
To prove it, Mr.

Before he had written the last word, the software had already seized on key words and was whizzing through its memory stores.


Europe's Turmoil Aids U.S. Banks
As Europe's governments continue to wrestle over the fate of the ever-more-elusive dream of currency union, their actions have an unintended beneficiary: American banks.
In the second quarter, the five largest New York banks and the BankAmerica Corporation of San Francisco reported combined revenues of $2.2 billion from trading, an all-time record.
And if the volatile markets continue, the banks are positioned to best that record this quarter.
With profits shrinking from traditional corporate lending, the big banks saw trading as a way to cash in on the rapid growth of international investments by corporations, pension funds and mutual funds.
So over the last few years, banks have built vast trading desks around the world, many with hundreds of traders sitting at banks of computer screens, rapidly barking prices for currencies and securities into their telephones.
Need to Change Positions
Volatile markets, like those in Europe last week, force these investors to change their positions quickly to protect themselves against currency devaluations and interest rate shifts -- resulting in a flurry of profitable trading for the banks.


Dawn Brings a Ray of Hope To a Newly Silent Sarajevo
For Sarajevans, the change was obvious.
Dawn came today without the usual fusillade of Serbian artillery, and the quiet continued throughout the day, with hardly any shells striking the city.
At the Kosevo Hospital, where many of the 70,000 people killed and wounded in the 16-month siege have been taken, the trauma clinic received only four patients with war wounds all day, the lowest toll in months.
Not all residents of the city agreed that the lull was a direct consequence of the announcement hours earlier that the NATO allies had backed an American plan to mount air strikes against Serbian nationalist forces if they continue to threaten Sarajevo and five other towns declared "safe areas" by the United Nations.
But the silence of the guns today bolstered those who have argued that it may not be necessary for air strikes to be carried out, only for the threat of them to be made credible.


2d Arrest In Bus Holdup
The police yesterday arrested a teen-ager who they said was one of three youths who boarded a city bus in Queens on Friday, brandished guns and robbed passengers of money and jewelry.
It was the second arrest in the case.
The suspect, Shawn Moncrieffe, 18 years old, was arrested shortly after 1 A.M. as he was leaving his home at 108-33 174th Street in Jamaica, Queens, the police said.
He was charged with first-degree robbery, and if convicted faces a maximum of 12 1/2 to 25 years in jail.
With guns and a book bag, the police said, Mr.
Moncrieffe and two others boarded and robbed passengers on a Q-85 bus on Friday morning at 140th Avenue and Edgewood Avenue in Springfield Gardens.


AT LUNCH WITH: Peter Hook; The Genial Troubadour Of Mope Rock
FOR a rock musician who packs arenas with sensitive black-clad adolescents, Peter Hook of New Order is hardly a household face.
Tonight, he and the English band are to headline at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., as part of their first United States tour since 1989.
Not long ago, Mr.
Hook, 37, was at a window seat at Zoe, a restaurant in SoHo, visible to every passer-by but unnoticed.
T-shirted, bearded and basset-faced, he calmly lunched on a well-done hamburger and french fries -- "no vegetables, just fries" -- while genially undermining New Order's image as dour purveyors of doom-y romance set to dance rhythms.

Reviews/Television; Imaginings About Another Kennedy
So it's open season on the Kennedys, not that there has ever been a closed season.
Copies of "The Last Brother," Joe McGinniss's maunderings about Senator Edward M. Kennedy, had hardly reached the bookstores before the USA Network was promoting "Marilyn and Bobby: Her Final Affair," two hours worth of huggermugger that manages in its fuzzy way to put some blame on Robert F. Kennedy for the suicide, if it was suicide, of Marilyn Monroe.
Described as "a blend of fiction and speculative journalism" (which means that nothing in it can be trusted), this television movie is not out to get the former Attorney General; all its makers want to get is an audience.
Bobby, as he is called by everybody tonight (James F. Kelly, affecting a Boston accent) is treated as a rather likable romantic who falls for a mentally dim Marilyn Monroe (Melody Anderson being breathy) after brother Jack has had enough of her.
The physical resemblances are about as authentic as this show gets.

Turkey Loses Its Allure as a Patron in Central Asian Nations
When the cold war ended and the remote Soviet fiefs of Central Asia became independent states, an idea emerged here and in Washington that Turkey should expand its role from bulwark of the Western alliance to patron of emerging nations stretching east to the Chinese border.
The idea had instant allure for many Turks, reviving forgotten dreams of pan-Turkic influence among distant Muslim kin awaiting a march toward Western prosperity.
For the United States, facing the prospect of ever more complex nationalist strife abroad as Soviet power crumbled, Turkey seemed a reliable proxy to fill the Central Asian vacuum.

Unfortunately for Dudley, he cannot yet be officially called Portland's property either.

Nine people were arrested in raids in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island after an eight-month investigation in which an undercover agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms purchased 180 submachine guns, automatic pistols and revolvers.


60-Minute Gourmet
TUNA'S annual run off eastern Long Island has begun, and at this time of year I enjoy going to the dock in Montauk and watching the catch come in.
Many of the biggest fish are cleaned immediately and placed on small planes that whisk them to Kennedy International Airport, where they are transferred to Tokyo-bound planes.
Within 24 hours they will be served as sushi.


China Bans One of Its Own Films; Cannes Festival Gave It Top Prize
In a bleak omen for the Chinese cultural world, the Government has banned one of the nation's most acclaimed films after just a few showings.
The leaders had approved a censored version of "Farewell to My Concubine," a movie that follows the lives of two Peking Opera actors through five turbulent decades of recent Chinese history.
But last week the authorities abruptly halted its release and distribution without offering an explanation.


THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: Strategy; Short One Vote in the Senate, Clinton Allies Prowl the Hill
One vote short; four days to find it.
With that premise, the White House and senior Democrats abandoned most pretenses of finesse today and began beating the halls of Congress, searching for the single Democrat who might give President Clinton's budget package a winning margin in the Senate.

N.A.A.C.P. Says Hughes Is Violating Diversity Rules
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is accusing the Hughes Aircraft Company of violating Federal guidelines that require Government contractors to diversify their work forces and managements.
Officials of the civil rights group said they would present evidence at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday that Hughes, which employs 55,000 people, has only two black vice presidents and that blacks are grossly underrepresented in its work force.

Cool-Tomato Pasta
NOW that the summer's best tomatoes are coming to market, it's a good time to make a pasta sauce that pairs hot, cooked pasta with cold, raw tomatoes.
This is the only time of year you can make the dish with good results.
Tomatoes that are just O.K. will produce a sauce that will have to be doctored to give it any flavor.
The traditional version of the cold tomato sauce calls for basil.
But now that arugula is fairly easy to find, it makes a very good change of pace.
The sweetness of the tomatoes provides an interesting contrast to the slightly bitter arugula.


Review/Film; A Union of Convenience Across a Cultural Divide
If the lavish bar mitzvah has become a familiar comic set piece in movies over the last two decades, Ang Lee's film "The Wedding Banquet" introduces its Asian-American counterpart in festive excess.
The Chinese wedding banquet that gives his funny and poignant comedy of manners both its title and its most riotous moments is an opulent nuptial celebration that refuses to end.
In the movie's virtuosic banquet sequence, 300 wedding guests gorge themselves on a sumptuous feast that leaves many of them literally retching from overindulgence.
The newlyweds are coerced into kissing ostentatiously and into drinking so many obligatory toasts that they are left reeling.

The doctor, David Benjamin, lost an appeal to keep his license last Friday after a professional conduct hearing committee found that he had practiced with incompetence and negligence, lied about his credentials and maintained inadequate records.

Eating Well
NO Eating Well columns have generated as much mail recently as those that have dealt with dietary supplements.
The people who have written, for the most part, are opposed to plans by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate supplements.
They believe that the Government is trying to take away their access to these remedies.
There are frequent comments on other subjects from readers that, while not as passionately presented, are of general interest.
Following hard on the heels of dietary supplements is anything to do with fat: fat in the diet, fat in recipes, fat in cookies.


2 to Be Sentenced Today in Rodney King Beating
Still publicly unrepentant, the two police officers convicted in the beating of Rodney G. King on March 3, 1991, will hear their sentence on Wednesday and by the end of the day could be behind bars for the first time.
Since their conviction in April for violating Mr.
King's civil rights, both Sgt.
Stacey C. Koon, who is 42, and Officer Laurence M. Powell, 30, have repeated in strong terms their belief that they acted properly in the violent, videotaped beating that for many Americans has become a symbol of police brutality.
They say they are being sacrificed to maintain the city's fragile peace following last year's riots.


Levee Is Cut Back to Save A French-Colonial Hamlet
Mississippi River flood waters poured today through a 400-foot breach intentionally punched in a major levee by the Army Corps of Engineers, but it was unclear tonight whether the action would save this 18th-century French hamlet from a muddy, ruinous deluge.
After a day spent shoring up a secondary levee that is closer to the historic downtown district, town officials and residents who had not already evacuated, fled around 9 P.M. as the waters could be seen approaching from the north.


No Need for More Unemployed College Grads; Shorten the Workweek

Those of us urged to do career planning at the dawning of the Age of Technology, as I did in a California junior high school, circa 1955, were told to map out and nourish leisure activities, the premise being that, as technology entered the workplace, work would require less time.


Coleman Is Charged With Felony in Los Angeles
Mets outfielder Vince Coleman was charged with a felony here today for igniting what an arson investigator likened to a "quarter stick of dynamite" in a crowded Dodger Stadium parking lot 10 days ago.
Officials from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said they expected Coleman, 31, to surrender to authorities on Monday or Tuesday and will recommend that his bail be set at $5,000.
Coleman's lawyer, Bob Shapiro, said that the left fielder would not contest the charge -- unlawful possession of an explosive device, which carries a minimum sentence of probation and a maximum of three years in prison.


Trading Is Brisk as Dow Posts Small Gain
Stocks closed narrowly mixed yesterday, with profit taking and concern about the economic recovery constraining the type of sharp upward movement that marked Monday's market.
Many investors had one eye on Washington, where the budget debate appeared to be moving toward a conclusion and the other on Europe, where Monday's agreement to widen the trading ranges for European Community currencies allowed the Exchange Rate Mechanism to survive -- at least in name.
The currency turmoil is sparking another debate as to whether the decline in European interest rates will be beneficial for American companies.


Metropolitan Diary
HIGH noon on a Lexington Avenue bus stuck in slow-moving traffic.
The vehicle is beyond steamy.
The air-conditioning has broken down.
The bus driver, perspiration dripping from his face, looks as though he is about to pass out.
Still, as each passenger boards the bus -- Joan Stark of Scarsdale, N.Y., is one of them -- the exhausted driver warns, "There is no air conditioning." Two women, overdressed for such a humid day, get on and stand near the front, alongside the driver.
"There is no air-conditioning," the driver says again, looking at the two of them.
"Honey, I'm not buying this bus," one of them answers. "I'm just riding it."
. . .
A steamy Saturday night in Brooklyn.
Linda and Sam Greenberg and Vicki and Garth Wade consider a deliciously icy cinema.
In the box office window of the Fortway Theater on Fort Hamilton Parkway, they spot two signs.
First this: SORRY, NO AIR CONDITIONING.
And then this: RESUSCITATION MASKS  AND LATEX GLOVES  ARE AVAILABLE AT BOX OFFICE.

Dear Diary:
I was sitting in a playground in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, sipping coffee and eating a toasted, buttered bagel when a little girl with a Pillsbury Doughboy stomach and light brown hair appeared before me.
She called herself Stephanie, and she claimed to be an 8-year-old cheerleader.
Her friendly manner won her a piece of my bagel.
"Mmmm, coffee -- my mother sometimes lets me have some," said Stephanie, who allegedly has a 48-year-old brother, a 23-year-old sister and an infant nephew.
"No, you are too young," I said, and asked if she was by herself.
No, she said, pointing to an older gentleman clearly oblivious to the wanderings of his charge.
Stephanie asked for another piece of my bagel -- actually, the whole other half.
Trying to be gentle, I explained that this was my lunch and offered her the smaller piece.
She ate it quickly and eyed the other half.
Seconds later, she snatched it and made off for the swings, turning around occasionally to hold up her prize.
I waited patiently for the return of my carbohydrates.
She made it to the other side of the park -- her hands were empty.
On her way out, she patted her stomach like a content Winnie-the-Pooh.
"That was good," she said.
"Thank you." I admonished: "That wasn't very nice. Don't do that to people." She smiled sweetly and left, her baby sitter following.
As I watched Stephanie skip down the block, I pondered the situation.
My mother was right, I thought, taking a sip of coffee.
I really should not talk to strangers. -- MINA LANDRISCINA

The scene was an elevator ride in a Manhattan office building, from the 38th floor to the lobby.
The cast of characters: a female office worker and a U.P.S. guy, who obviously knew each other, and me, David Itkin, listening to their dialogue.
He: How you doing, Lisa? How was your weekend?
She: Great. Saw a couple of movies.
He: Yeah? Which ones?
She: I saw "The Firm." It was good but the book was better.
He: "The Book"? I didn't see that.
This is a true story. It is also the end of literacy as we know it.

SUMMER RENTAL  On summer nights, sleep seeks  no boarders, finds no tenants since  lovers are blind to time and profit.
When it's finally late enough  each and everyone of us has the right  to own bold blue skies as ray  Upon ray of sweet-talk falls  across ceiling shadows illuminating the  tenderness and shining the happiness.
Everywhere, couples wrapped in  sudden sunshine squint past quiet clocks  and stare at hands held close to joy  While summer rents free to hopeful hearts,  for lovers want no payment, no darkness  only the bright light of white knights. -- ROGER GRANET

No Need for More Unemployed College Grads
To the Editor:
"Workers of the World, Get Smart" by Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, July 20) perpetuates the dangerous myth that demand for college-trained workers is limitless.
Mr.
Reich argues that if we can simply train enough workers with "problem-solving skills," we can have both high wages and high employment.
Yet America is suffering from too many college-educated workers.
Unemployment of Ph.D.'s is high, college graduates are experiencing the worst prospects for landing college jobs, and the last recession witnessed large-scale white-collar layoffs.


New Yorker Set to Back Deficit Plan
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, the only Democratic member of Congress from New York who voted against President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan in May, said today that she would vote in favor of its final version on Thursday.
The first-term Congresswoman, whose district stretches along most of the East Side of Manhattan, had come under intense pressure from the Democratic leadership, but she said then that she could not vote for a plan that was heavy on new taxes and did not aggressively cut spending.

Nine Ugly Walks Put Yanks in Danger of Taking One
Whenever Buck Showalter is asked about toppling the Toronto Blue Jays, his answer is simple.
You cannot make mistakes or give them extra chances.
They are too talented.
Give them something extra and they will probably exploit you.
Like they did against the Yankees last night.
It was a game that the Jays really did not deserve to win.
It was a game the Yankees really had to win.
Neither premise was realized as Toronto smoothly rebounded from deficits of 3-0 and 4-2, gladly accepted nine walks and one hit batter to jump-start their already imposing offense, and emerged with an 8-6 victory before 48,031 frustrated fans at Yankee Stadium.


Buenos Aires Journal; Where Gaucho Roved, Water Is Everywhere
Lorenzo Lenci, a 78-year-old rancher and hydraulics engineer in this town some 150 miles west of Buenos Aires, hid his worry behind a laconic smile as he showed where the floodwaters came to within yards of his colonial ranch house.
At one point in early July the land was 90 percent flooded.
"We lost the entire corn crop and much of the sunflower crop and all of our pasture, so we've had to move all of our cattle off the farm," he said.

He will be sidelined two to four weeks.

A week ago, the former outside linebacker was switched to right defensive end.
He will be replaced as a starter by Michael Strahan, a rookie and the team's second-round draft pick.


Book Notes; 265,000 Printed, Very Few Sold
Simon &amp; Schuster rushed "The Last Brother," by Joe McGinniss, into stores about 10 days ago, far earlier than originally planned, in an effort to head off the advance criticism piling thickly onto the book.
But the publisher is facing more bad news: for a book with a big-name author and an enormous first printing of 265,000 copies, "The Last Brother" seems hardly to be selling at all.
For any publisher, the most telling sales figures come in on Mondays.
That's when the country's big bookstore chains and wholesalers report their sales for the previous week.
The figures that came in on Monday for "The Last Brother," a biography of Senator Edward M. Kennedy that has been criticized for its use of imagined thoughts and actions and has been dogged by accusations of plagiarism, are dismal, chains and bookstores report.

For generations, girls and black and Hispanic students have performed less well than their peers in math and science -- in part, recent research suggests, because teachers set lower expectations for them.

Hudson Street between Morton Street and St.

Craig Bero has seen to that.
First he started his restaurant Village Atelier, in 1988, furnishing it with rustic farmhouse oak from his native Wisconsin.
Next he opened Anglers and Writers, a homey cafe done up like the reading room in a fishing lodge.
Now, next door to Anglers and Writers, he has opened Be-Speckled Trout at 422 Hudson Street, a general store with its mind on fishing.
All manner of chinaware, folk art, books and fishing collectibles make up the floor-to-ceiling clutter of this shop.
It also serves as a showcase for his mother, Charlotte Bero, whose baked goods, served in the restaurants, are now sold in the store.
They include old-fashioned homemade fruit pies ($22 each), muffins (75 cents) and tea loaves ($6), many of them baked with fruits and berries that Mr.

SWIMMING AND DIVING  New World Breast-Stroke Record
Karoly Guttler broke a world record and Franziska van Almsick won two gold medals yesterday on a big day for Hungary and Germany at the European swimming championships in Sheffield, England.
The Germans again dominated in diving, winning a fourth gold medal in a row, and Hungary's triple Olympic medalist, Krisztina Egerszegi, coasted to victory in the women's 400-meter individual medley.
Guttler, a Hungarian, became the first swimmer to break the 61-second barrier in the 100-meter breast-stroke when he set a world record in a heat before winning the gold.
During the first day of racing in the Ponds Forge pool, Guttler clocked 1 minute 00.95 seconds in the final heat.
In the final, Guttler went off to a fast first 50 meters and seemed on his way to breaking the record again.
He managed 1:01.04, while Nick Gillingham of Britain came in second with 1:02.02.
Van Almsick, who won two silver and two bronze medals for Germany at last year's Olympics at age 14, won the 100 meters in European record time, then went on to another gold in the 800-meters freestyle relay.
In the diving pool, Germany won its fourth final in a row when Brita Baldus got 541.68 points in the 3-meter springboard final. (AP) TENNIS  Stich Makes Quick Work of Pernfors
The second-seeded Michael Stich of Germany overpowered Mikael Pernfors of Sweden, 6-2, 6-4, yesterday in the first round of the $300,000 Volvo Tennis-Los Angeles men's tournament only two days after Pernfors won the Canadian Open.
Stich needed just 67 minutes to eliminate Pernfors, who beat Jim Courier, Aleksandr Volkov of Russia and Petr Korda of the Czech Republic en route to winning the Canadian Open.
Bruguera, ranked fifth, beat Zdrazila, 6-1, 6-3, in just 66 minutes.
Second-seeded Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden defeated Franco Davin of Argentina, 6-4, 6-2; sixth-seeded Carlos Costa of Spain beat David Rikl of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-1; and seventh-seeded Nicklas Kulti of Sweden outplayed Alberto Berasategui of Spain, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.

The best Steve Howe could do last night was come out ahead of "O Canada."
The boos for the Canadian anthem were far less raucous than the boos for Howe, the Yankees' incendiary relief pitcher who failed yet again in a brief appearance.
He gave up two singles to two batters, including the hit by Roberto Alomar in the sixth inning that drove in two runs and tied the score at 4-4.


BEAR STEARNS COS. (N)
The Bear Stearns Companies, one of the most profitable firms for its size in an industry where profits have been setting records the last two years, announced record profits yesterday for the quarter and fiscal year ended June 30.
The formula for success at Bear Stearns was a 42 percent gain in noninterest revenues in the latest quarter, mostly from securities trades for its own and customer accounts.
Expenses in the quarter rose only 38 percent, excluding interest.
For the last year, compensation to employees was only 48.3 percent of noninterest revenues at Bear Stearns, well below the 60 percent or more at many other securities firms.


Floods, and Fear of Them, Disrupt Tourist Industry
Compared with other tourist destinations along the rivers of the upper Midwest, St.
Joseph is one of the lucky ones.
Although its industrial south side was inundated and a flooded water-treatment plant left 85,000 residents without drinking water for five days, the historic sites that draw up to 250,000 visitors a year to this city were untouched.
Burlington, Iowa, suffered extensive flood damage to its tourist attractions, including historic buildings and a municipal auditorium.
And vast stretches of Katy Trail State Park in Missouri, a 200-mile hiking and bicycle trail between St.
Charles and Sedalia, were flooded by the rampaging Missouri River, which the trail parallels for most of its length.

Sea Gulls in Yonkers Are Suspects In Water Contamination Mystery
Environmental officials believe they have solved the mystery of how drinking water in parts of New York City became contaminated last week.
They said the bacteria probably came from sea gull droppings in a reservoir in Yonkers.
The droppings are always present in the reservoir's sediment, Albert F. Appleton, the city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, said yesterday.
But at the Hillview Reservoir, "three or four unique conditions" caused the sediment to be stirred up, flushing the bacteria into the water system, he said.

CHRONICLE
GIL SHAHAM , the young violinist who made news four years ago when he was summoned from a high-school exam in New York to fill in for an ailing Itzhak Perlman in London, climbed into a taxi at Kennedy International Airport recently, expecting an uneventful ride home.
Not surprisingly, the cab got stuck in traffic.
After sitting on the Van Wyck Expressway for half an hour, the cab driver turned around, spotted Mr.
Shaham's violin, a Stradivarius, and asked him if he knew the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto.

Belarus, a Model for Ukraine
The Clinton Administration is starting to make progress in disarming the new nuclear republics of the former Soviet Union.
Belarus is fast becoming nuclear-free, and reaping appropriate rewards.
Taking notice, balky Ukraine has begun disarming.
That's reason enough for Washington to begin rewarding Ukraine as well.
True, the aging SS-19 missiles Ukraine is deactivating are fast becoming unreliable, posing more of a menace to their immediate environment than anywhere else.
True, too, Ukraine says it is now disarming just one SS-19 regiment -- consisting of 10 missiles, each armed with six nuclear warheads -- and will disarm a second regiment in September.
Until it reaches agreement with Russia and the U.S., it refuses to deactivate its more potent SS-24 missiles; it has 46, each carrying up to 10 warheads.
Despite this refusal, the U.S. is right to provide Ukraine $175 million to aid in the disarming.

The Midwest Needs Help
The Salvation Army is serving 100,000 meals a day to flood victims in the Midwest.
The Red Cross serves 55,000.
Volunteers from the Southern Baptist Convention help prepare those meals, and Second Harvest, a network of food banks, has already shipped in 62 trailerloads.
That's only a sampling of the volunteer organizations working to ease victims' needs -- for a bed, a change of clothes, a loan or a cash voucher for groceries, prescription medicine, a lost pair of eyeglasses or just for a comforting ear.

Index of Leading Indicators Was Up a Scant 0.1% in June
The Government's main forecasting gauge barely inched up in June, and its decline in May was slightly larger than had originally been estimated, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The index of leading indicators, which is supposed to offer a six-to-nine-month look ahead at the economy, rose a scant one-tenth of 1 percent in June.
May's decline was four-tenths of 1 percent, not the three-tenths of 1 percent originally reported.


McKay Buys Part of Orioles
When Jim McKay called his grandson Monday with word that the veteran ABC commentator was one part of an ownership group that acquired the Baltimore Orioles for $173 million, 11-year-old James said, "Cool. Can we go on the field tomorrow night?"
"And when I take him down there tonight," McKay said by telephone yesterday, "I'm 12 years old, if I'm honest about it."
McKay has not hitched the family fortune to the Orioles.
His stake is less than 1 percent; Peter Angelos, a Baltimore lawyer, and William DeWitt Jr., an investment banker from Cincinnati, are the primary investors in the most expensive purchase ever of a sports team.

Senate, 96-3, Easily Affirms Judge Ginsburg as a Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg easily won confirmation to the Supreme Court today, and within hours of the Senate vote Judge Ginsburg, who argued six cases before the Justices as an advocate for women's rights, returned to the Court to inspect her new office.
Judge Ginsburg, who was on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, will officially become Justice Ginsburg when she takes the oath of office next Tuesday.
She arrived at the Court in midafternoon in a silver Nissan Maxima driven by her husband, Martin.
"It feels wonderful," she said of her confirmation as the car paused briefly before disappearing into the Court's underground garage.

Market Place; Slump gives waste disposal companies less to handle.
COMPANIES that got into the once-lucrative business of disposing of hazardous waste have run into a problem: There is not enough of the stuff to go around.
The continuing economic slump has reduced the amounts of waste being generated by industrial production.
And more companies are choosing to treat the wastes that are generated on their plant sites, rather than ship them to third parties for disposal.
The emphasis now is on reduction and recycling, rather than burning or burying.

Review/Music; A Tanglewood Mini-Festival Offers New Works in a Traditional Setting
The lure of the countryside and the lure of new compositions do not usually coincide.
But at the Festival for Contemporary Music at Tanglewood, listeners who do not usually seek out new music join major composers drawn by the promise of excellent performances and the acclaim of acolytes studying at the Tanglewood Music Center for the summer.
The audiences are healthy in size and passionate in their positive reactions.
The music is a widely varied sampling of works that have not yet and probably never will become mainstream concert fare.
And the rural setting emphasizes how often 20th-century composition, for all its urbanness, has sought distinctive landscapes, pastoral worlds distant from the public and the sounds of the surrounding mass culture.


Personal Health
JUST as we fertilize gardens to give nature a boost, throughout human history people have used a host of tricks to enhance sexual desire.
Be they tantalizing scents, soothing lights, sensuous music, stimulating drugs, herbs, foods, drinks or even exercise, these tricks of the sexual trade are known as aphrodisiacs.
The name comes from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of physical love.
With low sexual desire now a leading psychiatric complaint, millions of Americans are seeking ways to excite their sex drives.
Elusive Potions
Many of the reputed aphrodisiacs, like ginseng and yohimbine, have been used for centuries by primitive -- and not so primitive -- cultures to enhance sexual interest and performance.
Yet few have been put through a true scientific test.
Even if a researcher were intent on properly exploring a substance's stimulatory potential, it would be quite a challenge to come up with accurate and reproducible data on its effects on people.

Crown Heights Report Unfairly Criticizes Hynes in Nelson Trial
To the Editor:
As one who has practiced in New York State and Federal criminal courts for approximately 30 years, I take strong issue with the Crown Heights report, insofar as it criticizes the actions of Charles J. Hynes, Kings County District Attorney.
Mr.
Hynes receives criticism for his handling of the Lemrick Nelson trial, in which a jury found the young man accused in the death of Yankel Rosenbaum not guilty.
The conclusions of ineptitude on the part of Mr.
Hynes's office are unsupportable and unfair.
I am not a stranger to the Crown Heights embroglio since it was my client who was driving the car that accidentally killed young Gavin Cato, precipitating subsequent events.
To the extent that District Attorney Hynes insisted that the matter be presented to a grand jury I myself criticized him for what I had come to believe was oversolicitousness to public pressure on his part.
Nonetheless, because that inquiry was thorough, professional and rooted in elemental fairness, I had no doubt, as shown by the outcome, that my client would ultimately be vindicated.


Philadelphia Journal; A Chain-Store Invasion Of the Proudly Quaint
In this city of distinctive neighborhoods, none clings more proudly to its image than Chestnut Hill.
Situated at the city's northwest corner, it has won designation as a national historic district, maintaining the rustic ambiance of generations past, when only the rumble of trolley cars pierced the quiet of a summer afternoon and most folks knew one another by first names.
At Chestnut Hill's commercial center, blocks of small, upscale, family-owned businesses with names like Little Nook Gift Shop and the Happy Butterfly line cobblestoned Germantown Avenue, some in stone buildings more than 200 years old.
If any business owner needs help in deciding what color to paint a store, the Chestnut Hill Community Association will happily provide 29 pages of guidelines on how to "create visual harmony with the village character and ambiance of Germantown Avenue."


2 Men Arrested in Killing of Connecticut Family
Two men were arrested in Brooklyn yesterday in the killing of a Connecticut couple and their two children last weekend, the police said.
Three of the bodies were dumped by the edge of the East River near the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
One suspect, John Camacho, 22, a relative of the family, was charged with four counts of murder, said Officer Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman.
The second man, Luis Garcia, 23, was charged with tampering with evidence.
The police said he helped to take the three bodies from Connecticut to Brooklyn, where they were found late Saturday.


New Jersey and New York Police Seeking Links in 4 Slayings
Investigators from New York and New Jersey are sharing information to try to determine whether there are links in the deaths of four men whose dismembered bodies were discovered inside bags over the last year in both states.
The men were middle-aged, and investigators believe they were gay.
At least three of them were last seen in restaurants and bars in Manhattan before they disappeared, authorities said.


A Supporter Of Holtzman Tied to a Loan
A political supporter of Elizabeth Holtzman played an important role in a bank's decision to grant a $450,000 campaign loan last fall to Ms.
Holtzman's Senate campaign, bank executives, campaign officials and others with firsthand knowledge of a city investigation into the loan say.
The supporter, James P. Murphy, a vice president at the Fleet Financial Group, is the chairman of the board of trustees of the City University of New York.
He helped raise money for the Holtzman campaign during the summer of 1992 and was the first bank official the cash-starved campaign approached last August when it sought the loan, according to bank officials and aides to Ms.
Holtzman, the City Comptroller since 1990.

30-Year Bond at a Low of 6.52%
The yield on the 30-year bond neared 6.50 percent briefly yesterday but the buying lost some of its momentum in the afternoon.
Yet the yield still ended at 6.52 percent, a 16-year low for the yield on the 30-year bond.
The price of the 30-year bond was up 15/32 of a point as the yield fell from 6.55 percent Monday.
The yields on other Treasury notes followed the same volatile pattern to end the day down.
But they are still above the lows reached for this year.

Judge Postpones Man's Release
A judge postponed a decision yesterday on whether to release a mentally ill homeless man who has menaced residents of the Upper West Side of Manhattan for years, as officials tried to determine whether he would have a suitable home upon his release.
The postponement of the hearing, by Justice James F. O'Donoghue of State Supreme Court in Queens at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, came a day after the homeless man, Larry Hogue, offered to buy the house in Bridgeport, Conn., where his son is living, for $79,900.


THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: The Senate; Budget Opposition Brings Senator to Center Stage
Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey has rarely taken center stage in the United States Senate.

Mr.
Lautenberg's announcement came in a spare, eight-line press release that called the budget plan unfair to the middle class.
Although he has long been identified as a loyal, if not predictable liberal Democrat, his decision came as no surprise.
What was surprising was that the White House did not fight harder for his vote.

On the day that players were to report to training camp, the Jets had two draft choices who weren't signed -- linebacker Marvin Jones, the first-round pick, and running back Adrian Murrell, a fifth-round pick.
They still haven't signed Jones, who is demanding millions of dollars commensurate with his station in the draft.
Murrell signed about an hour before players were to report.
But his delay left some wondering about the presumptuousness of a rookie running back drafted in the fifth round and coming to a team that has two established veterans at his position.

Corporations would feel the effects of the big budget-reconciliation bill in two ways: as it directly affects the taxes they pay, and as it affects the performance of the broader economy in the years ahead.
For example, large retailers would lose by paying a new top tax rate of 35 percent on corporate income, an increase of two percentage points over the current top rate.
But they would also gain by being able to take advantage of a newly reinstated tax credit for hiring chronically unemployed workers.

City Ballet Breaks Off Its Long Relationship With Suzanne Farrell
Suzanne Farrell, the prima ballerina of the New York City Ballet who had been a longtime choreographic inspiration for George Balanchine, was dismissed from the company on Friday by Peter Martins, the company's director and her former ballet partner.
The strained relationship between the 47-year-old Miss Farrell, one of the most celebrated ballerinas of modern times, and the company was the subject of an article in The New Yorker in mid-May.
Miss Farrell retired from performing in 1989; since then, she served informally as a teacher and a coach for City Ballet, although she had no official title.

Review/Music; Plumbing the Soul of Jazz

No category is safe from his transformations; he'll speed up a ballad, turn a show tune into gospel music, remake country songs as soul shouts.
He can shred a song, turning it into a simple display of willfulness.

At Radio City Music Hall on Friday night, the 62-year-old Mr.

He was backed by a 17-man big band, which bustled ineffectually in its own showpiece but settled back to fill out the arrangements when Mr.

While American officials said the United States intended to begin bombing Serbian positions around Sarajevo unless the siege there was eased by early next week, there remained disagreement between the United States and the United Nations over whether the air strikes would require United Nations approval.

CITY officials say they think they have found the source of the bacteria that forced 35,000 New Yorkers to boil their drinking water last week, but the uncertainty in their voices might make people think about buying a water filter.

N.F.L. Is Told How Players Cheat on Drug Tests
While deciding the fate of Giants offensive lineman Eric Moore last week, the National Football League was told by at least one current N.F.L. player how players across the league are going through bizarre and intricate means to avoid testing positive for steroids.
The league was also told that while use of the drugs has diminished over the last five years, there still remains a significant number of players who use steroids, and those players think they can easily circumvent the testing procedures.
N.F.L. policy prohibits players from using anabolic steroids, which are generally believed to add to muscle bulk.


Heard the One About Laughter Seizing Montreal?
In the waning hours of this city's annual comedy festival, Just for Laughs, plaintive notes rang out from a grand piano in the mezzanine of the Delta Hotel.
Robert Schimmel, a comedian known for his X-rated sexual humor, was delivering a suavely textured rendition of the theme from "Love Story," using both hands and, for the melody, his nose, hitting the occasional grace note with a nostril.
The extra effort was understandable.
The small group gathered around the piano included Robert Morton, an executive producer for David Letterman; Steven Hewitt, the senior vice president of Showtime Entertainment Group; Jaime Masada, the owner of the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, and John Rubin, assistant manager of comedy for HBO.
As Mr.
Schimmel executed a final nose arpeggio, Mr.
Rubin nodded appreciatively and said, "It's moments like this that make Montreal special." Trade Show, Trading Pit
Now in its 11th year, the Just for Laughs festival has become the Cannes of comedy, an event that is equal parts trade show, Elks convention, all-star gala and trading pit.
Executives from the entertainment industry come to scout and schmooze.
Comics come hoping to score a hit and swing a deal.
Audiences come to laugh.
Last year, 610,000 people attended the 10-day festival, whose 250 acts perform in two theaters, a night club and on the Rue St.-Denis, in the heart of the city's Latin Quarter, where the festival closes that street to traffic for a six-block stretch in the evenings.

Defying NATO, Serbs Assault Key Sarajevo Outpost
Defying threats of NATO air strikes if they continue to strangle Sarajevo, Serbian nationalist forces moved today to complete their encirclement of Bosnian Army units defending a mountain stronghold that has been crucial to the city's survival during the 16 months of the Serbian siege.
A spokesman for the United Nations military command said that Serbian tanks, artillery and infantry appeared to have virtually trapped the Bosnian forces atop Mount Igman, which overlooks the western approaches to the city.
Bosnian Army commanders in Sarajevo dispatched hundreds of troops to reinforce the units defending against the Serbian attack, but they acknowledged that the situation was critical.


New York City Fined Again on Homeless

The ruling marked the second time since last November that the judge, Justice Helen E. Freedman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, cited officials as individuals, a rare legal move aimed at prodding the city into action.
She said in a 23-page decision that she would soon rule on whether to levy individual fines or even jail the officials for failing to provide prompt housing.


Foot-Dragging on War Crimes
With much huffing and puffing, the United Nations pledged in February to establish an international tribunal to prosecute war crimes in the Balkans.
Seven months after this Security Council declaration, little has happened.
The tribunal has only a token budget and scarcely a staff, and not a single case file has been opened.
Yet action along these lines would risk no lives -- indeed, might save lives -- and could begin to counter the frustration and cynicism as ethnic cleansers murder, rape, bomb and steal.
Granted, there are difficulties.
When World War II ended the Allies ruled Germany and Japan, and many accused war criminals were already in detention.
The U.N. is only a lightly armed interlocutor in the former Yugoslavia.
Some offenders could not only escape arrest but could mock the tribunal by staging press conferences under the protection of the flags they have disgraced.


Croatia's Founding Chief Is Seen as 'Mixed Story'
By all accounts, Croatian forces in Bosnia have been engaged in some of the same kinds of aggression as those being practiced by the Serbs.
But unlike the Serbs, the Croats are not being threatened by Western bombs, and have even managed to avoid the international economic sanctions that have crippled the Serbian economy.
For steering their fledgling country through this minefield, Croats owe much to President Franjo Tudjman, who has used the Balkan wars to solidify his position as his country's undisputed leader.

Clean Up the 'Ivan' Case
The "Ivan the Terrible" case has left a scar on American justice.
Whatever evils John Demjanjuk may have committed as a Nazi guard, the investigation that sent him from Cleveland to Israel for a war crimes trial was bungled.
It's unlikely that Israel will conduct another trial.
Thus the only effective way to restore order and honor is for the Justice Department to bring Mr.
Demjanjuk, who was acquitted of the most serious charges against him, back to the United States to determine his ultimate home and citizenship.
Mr.
Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born auto worker, was accused a decade ago of being the sadistic guard "Ivan the Terrible" of Treblinka, the death camp in Poland where nearly a million Jews were exterminated.
He was stripped of his American citizenship, held deportable and extradited for a murder trial in Israel, where he was convicted and sentenced to death.


Lautenberg Unpressured Over Budget
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the only Democratic Senator from the Northeast to oppose President Clinton's budget proposal, is being allowed to hold his ground without any challenge from New Jersey party leaders or arm-twisting by the White House.
No attempt has been made to enlist Gov.
Jim Florio to try to change Mr.
Lautenberg's mind, and party leaders said in interviews that they respected Mr.
Lautenberg's decision.
It is a decision that Democrats in New Jersey and in Washington understand to be a politically pragmatic one: the Senator faces a potentially tough re-election bid next year, fiscal policy is likely to be the main issue and New Jersey is a tax-weary state.

Guard Kills Armed Robber in Queens, Police Say
An armored-car guard shot and killed one of four men trying to rob the vehicle yesterday morning in Queens, the police said.
The robber's accomplices fled before the police arrived.
Three guards were dropping off several canvas bags filled with cash at 8:10 A.M. at a check-cashing service on Liberty Avenue in Richmond Hill when two masked men brandishing guns suddenly appeared, said Officer Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman.


Bell Atlantic in a TV Deal
The Bell Atlantic Corporation said today that it was acquiring a stake in a small New York company that would provide up to 100 television channels to users with a special antenna, providing an alternative to cable.
The regional telephone company is investing in Cellularvision, which provides its "wireless cable" service in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn and plans to phase it in throughout the metropolitan area.
Eventually the system could be offered nationwide if Federal regulators approve.
It also could be used for a variety of interactive and data services, which will be tested.

Embattled at the Source
Last month, Mayor David Dinkins proposed a $720 million plan that could protect New York City's water supply for decades.
This program has been rightly praised by environmental and community organizations for its emphasis on protecting drinking water at its source -- the 2,000 square miles of watershed land that surrounds the 18 city-owned reservoirs -- and for seeking a partnership with upstate communities and recognizing the high economic and social costs of pollution.
It is vital that the City Council support it when it votes on the Mayor's revised capital budget in September.

THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: The Senator Who Switched; For DeConcini, the Vote Is a Gamble
The temperature was heading toward 108 degrees today in the Valley of the Sun, and Leah Akers was sheltering under a japonica tree with the rest of the Oasis Senior Citizens Association, a clump of gray hair, bright prints and collective cynicism over Senator Dennis DeConcini's decision to change his vote and give President Clinton a chance for a victory in his budget battle.
"DeConcini is trying to maneuver himself into buying votes, but he's not going to get mine," said Ms.
Akers, a retired clerk.
The group snickered in derision at the mention of the "deficit-reduction trust fund" that Mr.
Clinton agreed to establish at the urging of Senator DeConcini, a three-term Democrat who faces a tough re-election battle next year against Democratic and Republican opponents.

Mr.
Giuliani, who had avoided in-depth discussions of these issues until last night, mocked the Democratic Mayor for naming a panel to restudy the study of his own commission on homelessness, rather than moving immediately to carry out its recommendations.
"Give me a break -- make a decision," said Mr.
Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor.

Sievenen was second in 4:15.51. (AP) TENNIS  Sanchez Vicario Gains in California  Two-time defending tournament champion Jennifer Capriati suffered a lower back strain during warm-ups and withdrew from singles play before her match last night in the Mazda Classic in Carlsbad, Calif.
Capriati, ranked ninth in the world, said the injury occurred 10 minutes into practice and about one hour before her match against Tatyana Ignatieva was to begin.
Tour trainer Joanni Essenmacher gave a treatment to Capriati, 17, who left open the possibility of playing her next doubles match Thursday depending on how well her back responds to a night's rest.
Alternate Shannan McCarthy replaced Capriati and was paired against Ignatieva in the night's featured match.

Capriati is the second top-10 player in two days to drop out of a match in the $375,000 tournament.

Israel Opposes U.S. on Sending Demjanjuk Back
The Israeli Justice Ministry, which is considering a petition that would require John Demjanjuk to stand trial for war crimes other than the one he was acquitted of by the Israeli Supreme Court, said a ruling by a United States court overturning Mr.
Demjanjuk's extradition order and challenging Israel's right to try him for other crimes "is not legally binding on the state of Israel."
The statement came in response to a decision Tuesday by the United States appeals court.
The court ruled that Mr.
Demjanjuk should not be tried in Israel for any other wartime offenses.
The United States court said Mr.
Demjanjuk's extradition was only concerned with the charge that he was the sadistic camp guard known as "Ivan the Terrible," who worked at the Treblinka death camp in Poland during the Nazi occupation.

Zero Hour for the Budget
The budget compromise that Congress will now vote on isn't as bold or inspiring as President Clinton asserted in his television address.
But neither will it lead to the economic Dunkirk forecast by Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader.
To the President's and the conference committee's credit, the plan would begin to bring the deficit monster under control without imposing undue harm on a fragile economy.
Where the plan comes up short is in its failure to tilt public and private spending toward investment -- the key to long-term growth.
This budget does not embody the economic plan Bill Clinton ran on or the economic agenda he set forth in his compelling speech to a joint session of Congress in February.
He promised then to stimulate the economy, to strengthen the country's economic base with innovative investment programs and to reduce the deficit through new taxes on the rich and cuts in Federal spending.
Both the stimulus and the investment initiatives have all but disappeared, leaving a deficit reduction program.

McGhee, who was recently moved from outside linebacker to the defensive line, had arthroscopic surgery today to repair torn cartilage in the knee.
Usually, that kind of injury would take two to three weeks to heal.
But McGhee also has an arthritic knee and the healing process could be considerably longer.


CHIRON CORP. (NMS)
Shares in the Chiron Corporation fell $3.50, or more than 5 percent, to $65 yesterday in response to second-quarter earnings that failed to meet Wall Street analysts' expectations.
The Emeryville, Calif., biotechnology company released its results after the stock market's close on Tuesday, showing net income of $5.4 million, or 16 cents a share, a reversal of a loss of $3.8 million.
But the second-quarter profit included a one-time gain of $6 million, which reflected the partial recovery of a reserve set aside for the settlement of a lawsuit by the Eastman Kodak Company.
Without the one-time gain, Chiron would have posted a small loss for the quarter.
Analysts had expected the company to earn about 10 cents a share without the one-time gain.

It's no laughing matter, but the Academy Award-winning Italian director FEDERICO FELLINI joked with his physician and photographers yesterday at a hospital in Rimini, Italy, where he is being treated for a stroke he suffered on Tuesday.
The hospital issued a statement yesterday saying his condition was guarded.
The famed director, who is 73, was on vacation in Rimini, a seaport on the Adriatic, when he collapsed in his hotel room.
Tests confirmed the diagnosis of a stroke on the right side of the brain.


Salzburg: Theater Makes Inroads
Even with Gerard Mortier's modernist reforms, the Salzburg Festival is still thought of as a celebration of music and opera.
But what is perhaps Mr.
Mortier's most striking reform has been little remarked in the non-German world.
That was his decision, soon after his appointment in 1989, to revitalize spoken theater at the festival.
With the aid of Peter Stein, a German director, that ambition has been triumphantly achieved, in a way that even Mr.
Mortier's many enemies are compelled to applaud.
But since the performances are nearly all in German, they appeal neither to non-German tourists nor to critics unversed in the language and in Central European theatrical traditions.

When Byrd came to a stop in the middle of the field, Jets Coach Bruce Coslet blew his whistle and players scrambled from all corners of the field to greet the former defensive end.
As soon as Byrd got out of the cart he was smothered in bear hugs.

New York State's frail system of reimbursing hospitals, crucial to the care of millions of middle- and low-income people, appears to have been saved by some deft 11th-hour maneuvering and sheer political muscle from the state's senior Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
Outflanking opposition from Republicans and some labor unions, Mr.
Moynihan and his staff cobbled together a novel plan over the weekend that would protect the state's reimbursement plan from a barrage of lawsuits that have threatened to bring it crashing down.

Custody Battle Casts Shadow on All Adoption; Only Broken Promises
To the Editor
Forty years ago, my biological parents, a young nurse and a doctor serving his internship, had a child.
If anybody had the option of abortion, they did.
Nevertheless, they chose to have their child and make that child available for adoption.
Whatever their reasoning, their decision was loving, courageous and selfless.
No less selfless and loving were the actions of the man and woman who adopted me.
In "Accidental Justice for Jessica DeBoer" (Op-Ed, July 27), Nerys Patterson, herself adopted, evidently cannot see the entire picture in this girl's tragic story.
Jessica's adoptive parents have honored their half of the adoption agreement.
They told the truth and have raised their daughter with love.
Jessica's birth mother has lied and now seeks to uproot that innocent's life in the most selfish of fashions.


Drama In Jays' Dugout
George Steinbrenner continues to maintain a public silence about the Yankees' ups and downs in the American League East race, but the C.I.A. side of him has surfaced once again.
Ceaseless in his desire to find dirt under his opponents' rugs, Steinbrenner found a potential target in Cito Gaston, the Toronto Blue Jays' manager, Monday night.


Dow Off, but Nasdaq Index Closes at High
Stocks moved in aimless fashion yesterday, as traders focused on the scheduled votes in Congress today and tomorrow on President Clinton's deficit-cutting package.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 9.22 points to close at 3,552.05, while the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 major stocks fell 0.73 point, to 448.54.
Intel Paces Nasdaq
But the other major market barometer, the Nasdaq composite index -- fueled by buying interest in secondary stocks and a two-point gain by the Intel Corporation, the second-largest Nasdaq company -- rose 4.78 points to set a record close of 713.79.


Callers Swamp Capitol Phones
Since Tuesday night, when President Clinton and his Republican nemesis, Senator Bob Dole, urged Americans to call their lawmakers about the budget, millions of Americans picked up their telephones to do just that.
A spokesman for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Herb Lennin, said that in the first two hours after the President's address, two million calls had been placed to the Capitol switchboard.
Between dawn and 4 P.M. today, 1,020,000 more calls were made.
Not all got through, and Mr.
Lennin was not sure if it was a record number of attempts.


U.S. Informer Is New Suspect In Bomb Plot
A 33-year-old fugitive who had been questioned by the F.B.I. and released almost immediately after the bombing of the World Trade Center was indicted yesterday as a new conspirator in the explosion, with Federal authorities charging that he helped mix explosive chemicals in the month leading up to the bombing.
Abdul Rahman Yasin, also known as Aboud, was named as a suspect as a Federal grand jury in Manhattan handed up a new indictment, outlining a host of new details about the conspiracy that led to the Feb. 26 explosion, which left six people dead and more than 1,000 injured.


Custody Battle Casts Shadow on All Adoption
To the Editor:
The case of Jessica DeBoer, in which her biological parents have been awarded custody after a two-year battle with her adoptive parents, has struck fear in the adoption community.
It has raised angry and passionate voices.
At issue is the legitimacy of adoption.
As both a biological and an adoptive parent, I was shaken by Nerys Patterson's "Accidental Justice for Jessica DeBoer" (Op-Ed, July 27).
She implies that adoption tears a child from the mother's breast, causing irreparable psychic damage to birth mothers and children.
Adoption, I maintain, far from being disruptive, creates families who understand and value the basic bonds that unite them: love and a desire to build a haven of support for all its members.

To the Editor:
"Long-Lost Spanish Fort Found in St. Augustine" (Science Times, July 27) contains a common error.
Yes, Florida translates literally as "flowered," but the state was not so named because it was a "flowery land." The native vegetation is flowerless, especially along the east coast lagoons.


Bernard Barrow, 65, Stage and TV Actor
Bernard Barrow, a stage, television and film actor best known for playing Johnny Ryan on the soap opera "Ryan's Hope" for 13 years, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 65 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Joan Kaye Barrow.


As Muslim Line Hardens, Serbs and Croats Halt Peace Talks
Serbian and Croatian leaders broke off peace talks here tonight and headed home after President Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Muslim leader, boycotted the negotiations for the third day.
The Serbian and Croatian leaders said they would return for talks on Friday if Mr.
Izetbegovic agreed to rejoin the negotiations.
But the President insisted that he would not resume talks unless Serbian forces withdrew from two mountains overlooking Sarajevo.


Victim's Cousin Accused of Killing Family
To people who knew him, John Camacho was a troubled young man who had received a golden chance to straighten out his life: the help of a cousin and her husband in Connecticut.
The couple, Santa and Al Marquez, gave him advice, let him stay in their home and tried to keep him away from what they saw as his aimless life in Brooklyn.
But on Tuesday night Mr.
Camacho, 22, was arrested and accused of killing the Marquezes and their children, Jonathan, 14, and Crystal, 6.
The police charged another man, Luis Garcia, 22, with helping Mr.
Camacho to take the bodies of Mrs.
Marquez and her children last Friday from the family's home in South Windsor, Conn., to Brooklyn, where they were dumped by the East River.


Calais, Here I Come: Channel Swim Endures
Beneath the White Cliffs, along a rocky beach where the first hazards are children skipping stones the size of baseballs, Sandra Jenkins stands ankle deep in the surf, windmilling her sun-tanned arms and taking great chuffs of breath as she stares down the French shore, 21.5 miles across the Channel.
Ms.
Jenkins, a muscular 29-year-old health club employee from Wales, is in training.
Today, she will swim some 10 miles, back and forth across the harbor where the huge Channel ferries come and go.
But next week, if the weather and tides cooperate, she will plunge into the bone-aching 62-degree water just below Shakespeare Cliff and like some 4,300 men and women before her set out for Calais, about 12 hours and 50,000 arm strokes away.


Times Mirror to Supply Information for Prodigy
The Times Mirror Company, the huge newspaper publisher, has made a deal to provide news, advertising and interactive services through the electronic network of the Prodigy Services Company, which provides information to computer users nationwide.
The agreement announced yesterday, which includes Times Mirror's newspapers in Los Angeles and New York, is further evidence of the current rush by newspaper and magazine publishers to find electronic pathways for their information.
Although many of the new ventures are essentially untested financially, the revenue potential is so great that many publishers feel they cannot stand idle as America wires itself .

Review/Opera; Santa Fe Offers Mozart, In English
Surely it occurred to John Crosby, when he founded the Santa Fe Opera in 1957, that by setting his theater on a hilltop and leaving it partly open to the sky, he was allowing for certain serendipitous production frills.
During the Queen of the Night's arias in Mozart's "Magic Flute," for example, an operagoer could look past the stage to see stars and moonlight and perhaps even -- as was the case on Tuesday night -- the bright flashes of distant electrical storms.
"The Magic Flute" is one of five productions the Santa Fe Opera is presenting in its 37th season, which runs through Aug. 28.
The company has long been a magnet for opera lovers, and this season, which company officials say will cost nearly $8 million, has several lures, including the new "Flute" staging and new productions of Handel's too rarely heard "Xerxes," Strauss's "Capriccio" and a Kurt Weill double bill of "The Tsar Has His Photograph Taken" with the American premiere of "The Protagonist." All are to be sung in English.
Also on the bill is a revival of the company's 1990 "Boheme."


Rostenkowski Spends $355,000 on Lawyers' Fees
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, fighting a Federal investigation of his finances, has spent more than $355,000 in campaign funds on lawyers' fees for himself and his aides in the last 18 months, Federal records show.
Such use of campaign money is entirely lawful.
But the amount of the lawyers' bills, while not unprecedented for a member of Congress under criminal inquiry, is a reflection of the depth of the legal trouble that Mr.
Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, may be facing.

American Winner, who will continue his quest for trotting's triple crown on Saturday in the $1.2 million Hambletonian at the Meadowlands, is a son of Super Bowl, the last to win the triple crown, in 1972.
American Winner is also a blood relative of Mack Lobell, who won the Hambletonian, harness racing's richest and most prestigious event, in 1987.


Holtzman Fighting Pressure on Loan Inquiry
Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman and her challengers in the Democratic primary clashed yesterday over whether she should urge the quick completion of an inquiry into a loan to her Senate campaign last year.
Her opponents urged the city's Department of Investigation to complete its inquiry before the Sept. 14 primary and pressed her to agree to promptly make the results of the investigation public.
But because the agency that requested the inquiry, the Conflict of Interest Board, usually keeps such reports secret, city officials said it was unclear whether Ms.
Holtzman could affect the release.

THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: News Analysis -- Beyond the Superlatives; Clinton-Dole Jousting Over Budget Bill Shows How Assertions Can Mask Truth
On television Tuesday night, President Clinton called the budget legislation now before Congress "the largest deficit reduction in history."
Not to be outdone, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, went on the air a few minutes later to say that the measure was actually "the largest tax increase in world history."


Coleman Leaves to Prepare for His Court Case
Vince Coleman has requested and been granted a leave of absence from the Mets to prepare for his arraignment in Los Angeles early next week and he will not be paid during that time, the Mets' assistant vice president, Gerry Hunsicker, said today.
The organization informed Coleman, who is under a felony charge of possessing an explosive, that he was expected to rejoin the club two days after his arraignment, which is expected to be held Tuesday in Los Angeles.


Autopsy Shows That Lewis Had Enlarged and Scarred Heart
An autopsy has shown that the heart of Reggie Lewis, the late Boston Celtics captain, "was abnormal, enlarged and was extensively scarred," the Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner said in a statement issued here today.
But the statement from the Chief Medical Examiner, Dr.
Richard Evans, said that neither the cause of the scarring nor the cause of death have been determined.
Scarred heart tissue can lead to potentially fatal heart rhythms and sudden death.
And many problems can lead to scarring of the heart.
Among them are infections -- often ones that produce few symptoms -- chemicals, previous heart attacks, immunological reactions, injuries and drugs, both prescribed and illicit.


2 Deaths Called Murder-Suicide
Authorities confirmed today that the deaths of two American Cyanamid employees at a research laboratory here on Tuesday morning were the products of a murder-suicide but said they had yet to learn the motive for the killings.
The Stamford police said an autopsy had shown that Cleophus Whitaker, a 49-year-old lab attendant from Stamford, had killed a co-worker, William Luther, 48, of Norwalk and then turned the handgun on himself.


THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: White House Memo; An Excess of the Pulpit And Not Enough Bully?
Staring defeat in the face, Richard III melodramatically offered to trade his kingdom for a horse.
In an equally tight spot this week, President Clinton has talked himself to the brink of laryngitis, but his wheeling and his dealing have been strikingly subdued.
Without the vote of Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, a conservative Democrat who finally agreed late this afternoon to support him, Mr.
Clinton seemed likely to be beaten when his budget proposals come before the Senate on Friday.
Some incentives had been offered to Mr.
DeConcini, including a less onerous tax on high-income recipients of Social Security, designed to appeal to the many wealthy retirees in Phoenix and Tucson, and an executive order pledging new tax revenues to deficit reduction rather than new spending.

Essay; President Hobson
Thomas Hobson ran a rent-a-horse agency for the hard-riding scholars of Cambridge, England.
His system was not customer-friendly: renters could take only the next available horse, thereby saving wear and tear on the more popular models.
This led the poet Thomas Ward to coin a phrase in 1630: "Where to elect there is but one/ 'Tis Hobson's choice, -- take that or none."
President Clinton adopted Hobson's style in his Oval Office address the other night.
"Now there are only two choices: our plan or no plan." He then zapped opponents of the Democratic plan as "guardians of gridlock." (I would have added an alliterative advance adjective, "grim," to convey the full nattering-nabobs-of-negativism flavor, but speech writers today are more restrained.)

THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: The Overview; Clinton Finds a Convert on the Budget
One of the seven Senate Democrats who have opposed President Clinton's $500 billion budget package changed his mind today, converting a shaky bet that the package will squeeze through the Senate on Friday into something close to an odds-on favorite.
Close, but not absolute.
Today's decision by Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona to support the measure places 49 Democratic senators solidly behind the package, and there are strong hopes in the White House that one past Democratic supporter -- Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska -- will not decide to break ranks.


Sayers Says Kansas Taking a Risk
Kansas is risking all the strides it has taken on the football field in recent years by playing Florida State in the Kickoff Classic, GALE SAYERS said last night.
Sayers, a Pro Football Hall of Fame member and a former Jayhawk, said a losing season and a poor performance in the Kickoff Classic could "kill the program" that has been resurrected under GLEN MASON.
Kansas, which had one of the worst collegiate football programs in the country until recently, went 6-5 two years ago and improved to 8-4 last year.
Kansas capped the season with a victory over Brigham Young in the Aloha Bowl.
The Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium on Aug. 28 will net Kansas a minimum of $625,000. (AP)


Hospital Fund Takes Leader From Assembly
The majority leader of the New York State Assembly, James R. Tallon Jr., a Binghamton Democrat, was named today as president of the United Hospital Fund of New York, a research and charitable foundation that assists nonprofit hospitals in New York City.
Mr.
Tallon, who is 51, plans to begin the job on Sept. 8, leaving the Assembly after 19 years, seven of them as its second-ranking member.
He lost a campaign for Speaker to Saul Weprin in 1991, but Mr.
Weprin retained him as majority leader.


Advisers Are Urging President to Expand Peacekeeping Effort
President Clinton's national security aides have recommended that the United States adopt a more assertive role in United Nations peacekeeping operations, Administration officials said tonight.
The recommendation, in a classified draft of a Presidential directive, also calls for Washington to take a more active diplomatic role in seeking to resolve disputes within and among the former Soviet republics, the officials said.
The recommendations were first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed later by the officials.

Clinton Plan's Economic Drag Cited
Should the long end of the bond market rally when -- and if -- Congress approves President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan, he probably should not regard the buying as strictly investor applause.
In his televised address to the nation Tuesday night, the President used this year's bond market rally, which has pulled the yield on the 30-year bond down to its lowest level in 16 years, as a signal of approval from what he called "the most conservative and skeptical critics of all, those who run our financial markets."

Washing, Baking and Lugging, Too: Frontier Women of the Flooded Plains
The sound of the flood in New Canton is the sound of washing machines.
They are running day and night all over town.
Shirley Main is going through three big boxes of detergent a week.
Shirley Dennis and Cecilia Irwin did 10 loads each one day.
Norma Hart is doing laundry, too.
So are Sue Wells, Rita Schultz, Nancy Gates, Julie Carder and Kim Pullian, among others.
There are 200 National Guardsmen working on the levee here -- and no laundry.
So the women of New Canton (population 450) have become the laundry.
Not only do they do the wash for nothing, but they send it back with homemade cookies and a handwritten note: "You're doing a great job."


Judge Reinstates Jeffries as Head Of Black Studies for City College
A Federal judge yesterday reinstated Dr.
Leonard Jeffries as chairman of the black studies department at City College, ruling that while Dr.
Jeffries had made "hateful, poisonous and reprehensible statements" and had behaved in a "thuggish" way, his removal had violated his constitutional rights.
The strongly worded decision by Judge Kenneth Conboy of Federal District Court in Manhattan was a clear victory for Dr.
Jeffries, who was removed as department chairman after a 1991 speech in Albany that was considered by many to be anti-Semitic.
It was also a rebuke to the top administrators and trustees of the City University system, who, Judge Conboy said, had been "dishonest" and perhaps "cowardly" in their presentation of the case.


Illinois Town Cuts Levee Against Federal Advice
Defying the advice of the Army Corps of Engineers and threatening farmland to the south with yet more flooding, officials in this Mississippi River hamlet dynamited a levee outside of town today in a desperate gambit to relieve the pressure on another levee abutting the historic downtown.
In a 3:30 A.M. meeting called during a break from their all-night sandbagging efforts at the main levee, all three commissioners of the Fort Chartres-Ivy Landing Drainage and Levee District voted to blast new holes in their levee with dynamite, expanding earlier efforts this week by the corps to breach the levee.
They hoped the wider openings would help draw away the muddy water lapping at the streets of Prairie du Rocher.


Gillette Accounts Are Consolidated
Two Gillette Company units -- Braun Inc. and the worldwide stationery products group -- have consolidated accounts at different agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Braun, the maker of personal care products and appliances, consolidated its global creative account at the Lowe Group in London, without a review.
Billings were estimated at $80 million.
Lowe will add responsibilities for the Braun campaigns in countries like Britain, where the account had been handled by McCann-Erickson, and in the Netherlands, where it had been handled by Young &amp; Rubicam.
Lowe will keep the account in countries like the United States, where a Lowe shop, Lowe &amp; Partners, has worked for Braun since 1984, and in France, Germany and Italy.

Microsoft in Deal With Continuum
The Microsoft Corporation said today that it would purchase, for an undisclosed amount, certain technology and product development efforts from the Continuum Productions Corporation, a Bellevue, Wash., company entirely owned by William H. Gates 3d, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive.
Analysts said the acquisition might reflect a realization at Microsoft that its core products -- operating system software and applications -- have matured and can no longer sustain the company's historic sales growth.
Bringing in new technology from Continuum could provide future growth for Microsoft, these analysts said.


Economic Scene; An idea for countering the deficit: forcing citizens to save.
IF Democrats do manage to shoehorn through a budget this week, what will they have accomplished?
Something close to $500 billion in deficit reduction over the next five years -- $500 billion the Government would otherwise have bid away from private investment or borrowed abroad.
More than some people expected, perhaps.
But to William Gale and Robert Litan, economists at the Brookings Institution, this glass is decidedly half empty.
By their reckoning, the fact that Washington has turned itself inside out just to buy a few years' grace on the deficit is evidence that the long-term fight for fiscal rectitude has already been lost.

Review/Jazz; 30 Years On, Recalling The Site and Sound Of Triumph for Monk
Jazz at Lincoln Center opened its season on Tuesday night at Alice Tully Hall with an ambitious project: to reproduce, almost 30 years after the original concert at Lincoln Center, the big-band collaboration between Hall Overton, a Juilliard teacher and jazz pianist, and the pianist and composer Thelonious Monk.
By all accounts, the concert in December 1963, was an extraordinary success, and the recording of the concert, which unfortunately is rare, has some of the most beautiful moments jazz has ever committed to tape.
It's a performance in which a group of musicians perfectly interpret orchestrations that in turn interpret Monk's music with real clarity.
The orchestrations, which Overton and Monk worked on, are loaded with wit, and accurate: on "I Mean You," high riffs, played with soprano saxophone and clarinet, mimic Monk's own high-register tinkling, and the music is rife with his funny dissonances and wryness that constitute a large portion of Monk's legacy.

WHAT has surprised the woman the most is the intensity of her emotions since she separated from her husband a few months ago.

She and her husband had met during their freshman year at college and married after graduation.

"There was no other vehicle or pedestrian involved, but several officers about a block away saw what happened and went to help. Apparently, a citizen noticed the gun and mentioned it to them. They questioned Mr. Snipes and he produced the gun."

THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: Income Taxes; Tax Bill Would Let Wealthy Stretch Out Their '93 Payments
The wealthy taxpayers most affected by the new tax increase in the Clinton budget package will not feel the full effect immediately because the Administration has agreed to allow them to spread their payments of 1993 taxes over two extra years.
In effect, they will be getting a two-year loan at no interest.
And for the wealthiest the loans could amount to tens of thousands of dollars.

I do not have misgivings about the package because it has "gas taxes that are too high." I will support an increase in the gasoline tax, and those who quibble over a difference of a few cents therein are wasting time.

Neighbors Hail Demise Of Bridgeport Trash Pile
The former site of a 35-foot illegal dump known as Mount Trashmore was officially turned over to the City of Bridgeport today as more than 150 residents of the city's East End gathered to celebrate.
"I had my doubts that this day would ever come," said James Drayton, 75, "but we fought hard and I just thank God that we won."


At Swearing In, Iran's Leader Stresses Rights
President Hashemi Rafsanjani was sworn into office today for a second four-year term, and he urged "very serious" Government coordination to insure basic freedoms for Iranians.
Mr.

Woman Abducts Son From Foster Mother
A woman who surrendered custody of her 8-year-old son to foster care abducted the boy from his foster mother at gunpoint on a Brooklyn street last night, the police said.
The woman, Carmen Sanchez, and three of her friends drove to the home in Bensonhurst where her son Frandiego lived with his foster mother.
They were walking down the street when a light-blue sedan pulled up at about 7:40 P.M.

Summer Charity Game Could Be King's Finale
There will be one more game for Bernard King.
That much is certain.
Beyond his commitment to play in the New York All-Star Basketball Classic on Sept. 1 is a question, he said yesterday, that he would not answer for another 30 days.
But he sounded like an athlete coming to grips with retirement.
"Someone like myself," he said, "who's overcome a lot of adversity, feels like he has to go out and play at a certain level, and last season I didn't play at a level that made me happy."


Cow-Hormone Flap Ends
After three long days of haggling, the Senate-House budget conferees finally closed their last remaining -- and unlikely -- debate this afternoon when they agreed to impose a three-month moratorium before bovine growth hormone could be sold.
Senator Russell D. Feingold, a freshman Democrat from Wisconsin, had caused the delay by pushing an amendment for a one-year moratorium on recombinant bovine somatotropin, a genetically engineered version of a hormone that occurs naturally in cows.
He said today that he was satisfied with the compromise, since the three-month moratorium would not begin until after the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, probably later this year.


Yanks May Be a Bit Down, but They're Hardly Out
Twenty-four hours earlier, Paul O'Neill had put the Yankees' task in simple terms.
"Obviously, the next two games are more important for us than they are for them," the Yankees' right fielder said.
"They won the first two. We don't want to be pushed around by them."
The Yankees pushed back last night.
With O'Neill driving across three runs with a pair of consecutive-inning two-out singles, the Yankees defeated Toronto, 6-2, and sliced the Blue Jays' American League East lead to two games.
The victory was only the Yankees' third in nine games with the Blue Jays this season and fifth in 22 games including last season.

New Chiefs for 2 Paris Institutions
Jacques Toubon, the French Minister of Culture, appointed new directors today for two landmarks of French culture.
Francois Barre, 54, will become president of the Pompidou Center here, succeeding Dominique Bozo, who died in April.
Jean-Pierre Miquel, 56, an actor and stage director, was named general director of the Comedie Francaise, effective Sept. 1.
Mr.
Barre, an alumnus of the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, was the founder and director from 1969 to 1976 of the Centre de Creation Industrielle, later incorporated into the Pompidou Center.
He also directed the magazine Architecture d'Aujourd'hui, and was counselor to the chairman of Renault, the car maker.
He had been in charge of plastic arts at the Ministry of Culture since January 1990.


Coslet Rolls a 7: Esiason
Jets Coach Bruce Coslet has decided to go with Boomer Esiason as the starting quarterback for the team's first preseason game against Pittsburgh this Saturday.
Esiason will be followed by Browning Nagle and Jeff Blake.
Esiason was acquired in a trade with Cincinnati in the off season to compete with Nagle, last year's starter.
And even though Coslet has indicated that the competition for starting quarterback is wide open, Esiason, by virtue of his nine years of experience in the National Football League and familiarity with Coslet's offense, appears to have the advantage.
Esiason played for Coslet when the coach was the offensive coordinator for the Bengals.


The Outdoor Shower: A Spray From Heaven
IT'S kind of like the Garden of Eden with soap and a towel, maybe a fluffy robe.
The Great Outdoors crossed with a clean motel.
If it isn't original sin, it feels like it could be: a stream of water falling through the air, like the warm voice of a snake.
It's outdoors when it's supposed to be indoors, and one never forgets that fact.
The unlicensed thrill is as fresh as the water, every time.

Victim's Cousin Accused of Killing Family
To people who knew him, John Camacho was a troubled young man who had received a golden chance to straighten out his life: the help of a cousin and her husband in Connecticut.
The couple, Santa and Al Marquez, gave him advice, let him stay in their home and tried to keep him away from what they saw as his aimless life in Brooklyn.
But on Tuesday night Mr.
Camacho, 22, was arrested and accused of killing the Marquezes and their children, Jonathan, 14, and Crystal, 6.
The police charged another man, Luis Garcia, 22, with helping Mr.
Camacho to take the bodies of Mrs.
Marquez and her children last Friday from the family's home in South Windsor, Conn., to Brooklyn, where they were dumped by the East River.

Albania Takes Refugees, Not Terrorists
To the Editor:
Re "Is Macedonia Next?" by Misha Glenny (Op-Ed, July 30):
The assumption that Albania can tolerate the training of Bosnian refugees for terrorist activities in the camps it is offering them is unfounded.
Giving shelter to people in need has been an Albanian tradition that benefited many Montenegrins and Bosnians before World War II, the Jewish community when our country was occupied by the Nazis and numerous Greeks who fled into Albania in the late 1940's because of the political and military circumstances in their homeland.
Now, as other European, Middle Eastern and Asian countries have done, Albania is receiving thousands of refugees from Bosnia, mostly women and children, despite very limited resources.
But this only and nothing else is foreseen in the various Albanian talks and agreements with the Bosnian authorities.
The Albanian Government would never allow any use of these camps for other purposes and will provide access there for anybody who might want to check them.
As for the Albanian negative vote to the admission of Macedonia into the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, it is only conditioned by the failing of the Macedonian Government to give the Albanian community living there the rights it was committed to give, such as proportional representation in the state apparatus, more schools, an Albanian university and more access in the national news media.
Furthermore, the Albanians in Macedonia are crucially supporting the internal stability of that young state.
Many international community leaders have publicly recognized that the Republic of Albania, with its commitment to peace and to easing tensions, its opposition to any violent change of borders and its realistic policy, has made a major contribution to stability in the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula.

SOME nerve, Jerry Lewis had, growing up like that, becoming something other than the freakish wonder, the boy with the tomahawk scream, the innocent caught up in his own sweet madness.
He was young and raw.

They echoed now, off the walls in Mr.
Lewis's house, in photographs of him looking straight at you.
Or at Dean's side.
Or pouting and staring out, a young squirt, a strange sort of comforting, bewitching presence in his own house.

Japan Admits Army Forced Women Into War Brothels
After decades of denials, the Government acknowledged today that the Japanese military had forced Asian and European women to work in army brothels during World War II, and it offered its first full apology for those atrocities.
The announcement was significant, given Japan's long reluctance to acknowledge the scope of its wartime aggression.
But it was also another step to respond to demands from Asian neighbors that Japan admit the brutalities committed by its troops.


Steelmakers Push to Overturn Trade Ruling
American steelmakers, stunned by a Federal commission's ruling last week that eliminated many tariffs on imported steel and knocked $1.1 billion off the value of their stocks in 90 minutes, began a broad campaign this week to reverse the decision.
Led by major companies like the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the LTV Steel Company and the USX Corporation, the domestic industry is putting pressure on Congress, the White House and the Federal panel, the International Trade Commission.

Italy's Parliament Votes to Abolish Electoral System
The Italian Parliament voted today to abolish the country's 45-year-old electoral system and replace it with a direct ballot that is supposed to make politicians more accountable to the people who elect them.
Under the previous system Italians voted for lists of candidates controlled by powerful political parties and parliamentary seats were distributed according to the overall showing of each party.
Under the more complex system approved today three-quarters of the nation's legislators will be chosen by straight contest in individual constituencies where the winner will be the person with the most votes.


Review/Theater; Testing the Hazy Border Of On the Stage and Off
Near the beginning of her solo performance piece "101 Humiliating Stories," Lisa Kron explains that she doesn't really have the number of tales her show's title proclaims.
"I have 17," she admits in a tone of mock apology.
"But each story has several humiliations," she adds, brightening hopefully.
Ms.
Kron, who has the wry delivery and comic timing of a natural storyteller, animates such moments with just the right mixture of hesitancy and deadpan humor.
Her show, which she performed at Alice Tully Hall last Thursday evening as part of the Serious Fun festival, is a collection of autobiographical vignettes about embarrassing moments, each recounted in exquisite detail.

How Do Mets Falter? Green Adds Up Ways
There is no end of topics for insult when it comes to the Mets.
Dallas Green, the manager, most certainly knows that.
Before tonight's game at Olympic Stadium, Green found fault with: a) the Mets' bullpen, b) the Mets' lack of speed, c) the Mets' erratic defense, d) the "lack of heart" of several players.
Afterward, though, it was the offense that took the abuse.
New York managed three hits off Montreal starter Chris Nabolz this evening, a paltry performance against a pitcher who had but a 6-7 record and a 4.84 earned run average before meeting the Mets.
Nabholz went eight innings and outdueled Sid Fernandez, who pitched well after the first, but was still stuck with the 3-1 New York defeat.


Big Gamble For Israelis
Israel's weeklong bombardment of southern Lebanon, the largest assault since the 1982 invasion, brought a respite from attacks by pro-Iranian guerrillas, but its success depends now on attaining a peace agreement with Syria, Israeli officials and Western diplomats say.
Israeli officials are banking on an agreement with Syria that will include a return of the Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for peace along the northern borders.
Any agreement, Israeli officials say, will include a Syrian commitment to crush the principal Iranian-backed guerrillas, the Party of God.


Ukrainian Runner Faces Suspension
The world 3,000-meter champion, TATYANA DOROVSKIKH of Ukraine, tested positive for a banned drug and faces a four-year suspension, the International Amateur Athletic Federation said yesterday.
Dorovskikh will be ineligible to defend her title at the world championships at Stuttgart, Germany, starting Aug. 14.
A federation spokesman said Dorovskikh tested positive after a meet June 15 in Budapest.
Both urine samples were positive, resulting in an automatic suspension pending a hearing with her national federation.
The I.A.A.F. did not dislose the banned substance, but sources indicated it was a steroid. (AP)

Parliament is to convene this afternoon and will probably elect Morihiro Hosokawa, the head of a coalition of seven opposition parties, as Prime Minister, another step in the whirlwind of change that has altered Japanese politics over the past two months.
The Liberal Democrats lost their majority in last month's elections.

New Day for Women's Team
It's easy for the United States' women's soccer team to distinguish current events from the old days.
Anything before 1991, when the team won the first FIFA Women's World Championship in China, qualifies as the old days.
"In the old days, our audience consisted mainly of mom, dad and the family dog or cat in the stands," said Anson Dorrance, the head coach, who is with the team for the North, Central American and Caribbean women's championship in New Hyde Park, L.I.
"But since our championship, our crowds have been growing and growing. We were lucky back then if we could get 1,000 people to come to our matches. Today we get about 7,000. The recognition has been slow, but I do see a gradual development."

Sounds Around Town
In a Donegan Mood
Dorothy Donegan Trio, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037.
Dorothy Donegan, a throwback to the days when jazz musicians were often a part of show business, has managed to combine her showmanship with musical virtuosity and a strong jazz sensitivity, a combination that often blinded jazz purists to her skills.
Now approaching 70, she is usually not as rambunctious as she once was, but she can still turn on the heat when she wants to.
To help her shift into various moods, her trio includes her longtime drummer, Ray Mosca, who understands every twist of her fingers and every stomp of her foot.
With Jerome Hunter on bass, they play tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.
The cover charge is $15 and the minimum is $8 tonight and tomorrow.
On Sunday the cover is $12 but the minimum is still $8.

Versus and Scrawl, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-3055.
Buzzing, droning, ticking and pounding, Versus plays rock songs that implode.
All of a sudden, calm declarations like "I don't care" are torn apart by jagged guitar chords and bursts of noise, as if social decorum could no longer contain emotional turmoil.
Scrawl, a long-running college-circuit band, plays scruffy, straightforward tales of troubled romance and day-to-day tension.
The quadruple bill, with Coral and Kepone opening, begins tonight at 9; tickets are $8.


Test Sales of New Tomato Called a Success
The DNA Plant Technology Corporation said today that test-market results of its premium tomato had been three times greater than expected, prompting company plans to broaden distribution more than tenfold later this year.
Despite the company's name and core technology, the tomato is not genetically engineered, but has been bred using conventional processes to remain fresh longer.
As such, it is not using the techniques of agricultural biotechnology that have been criticized by some consumer activists and chefs.
Nevertheless, analysts said the test-marketing results were evidence that consumers would pay a premium price for a better tomato.
DNA Plant shares closed today at $5, up 37.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
More Stores and More Acreage
DNA Plant said its tomato, sold under the brand name Freshworld Farms, achieved an average 15.8 percent market share during its first three months of test sales in Philadelphia and Columbus, Ohio.
The sales began in April.
DNA Plant said this acceptance meant it would now increase the number of supermarkets carrying its tomato from 41 to more than 500 by the end of 1993.
The company, based in Cinnaminson, N.J., is now planting more acreage to meet this goal.

Yankees Send a Message With Split of Series
Don't write their obituary yet.
Don't dismiss the next two months of baseball from the team that still resides in the Bronx.
Don't say the Yankees cannot beat the Blue Jays.
The pennant race is alive and kicking and so are the Yankees.
Even though most of the Yankees were too proud and too programmed to concede it, they needed respect from the first-place Jays during this pivotal four-game series.
How could they ever challenge for the American League East title if the Blue Jays constantly humbled them?
The question is no longer valid.

Rarities Amid a Trove of Ellingtonia
"Paris Blues," released in 1961, is one of those slight slivers of a film that pretty much deserves its obscurity.
Paul Newman pitches woo at Joanne Woodward.
Sidney Poitier pitches woo at Diahann Carroll.
The two men, jazz musicians living in Paris, have to decide whether to stay in France or return to America.
End of movie, and off to the cultural dustbin.
Except for one thing.
As all this woo gets thrown around, Duke Ellington's extraordinary score for the film rumbles along behind the semi-activity.
A virtually unknown piece of Ellingtonia, the soundtrack uses everything from small bands to a large orchestra, and it's a magnificently rich, if jumbled, work.
It comes from a crucial year, 1960, that saw Ellington recording "The Nutcracker Suite," the "Peer Gynt Suites," "The Asphalt Jungle Suite," "The Queen's Suite" and "Suite Thursday." Ellington was in an especially prolific period.
The score to the movie sprawls, glittering with beautiful melodies and graceful interludes.

N.B.A. Rejects Blazers' Contract for Dudley
Commissioner David Stern of the National Basketball Association formally rejected Chris Dudley's imaginative new contract with the Portland Trail Blazers yesterday, calling the former Net center's seven-year, $10.5 million pact "a blatant and transparent attempt" to circumvent the league's salary cap.
The action, which had been expected, puts the matter in the hands of the league's special master, Merrell Clark.
He will decide whether to uphold the commissioner's ruling and also whether the contract represents a circumvention of the salary cap.
If he finds a circumvention, the league could fine the Trail Blazers as much as $1 million and force it to forfeit draft choices.

Some workers in the 44-story Bertelsmann Building at 1540 Broadway at 45th Street had to walk down stairways to reach the street because elevators were not working.
Four people suffered smoke inhalation and several dozen people were trapped for about an hour on the top floors of the building, the Fire Department said.

Tribe on Path to Nuclear Waste Site
An Indian tribe said yesterday that it wanted to begin "credible, formal discussions" with the Federal Government about storing high-level nuclear waste for at least a few years on its reservation in southern New Mexico.
The tribe, the Mescalero Apaches, did not say it would accept the waste, which comes from civilian power plants, and the tribe faces opposition from New Mexico's Governor, Bruce King.
But the announcement means that the Mescaleros have gone further than anyone else along the path to accepting the waste, which is piling up at more than 100 civilian reactors.

Sports of The Times; Poor George: Yet Another Huge Crowd
Only 1,643 fans rattled around Yankee Stadium yesterday.
Several hundred others were held hostage by hostile bands outside the ball park.
The Yankees were so disheartened by continued low attendance that they lost, 12-0, to fall 23 games out of first place.
Afterward, several players said they hoped the franchise would be moved.
HE would love that, would the man from Tampa.
It would only strengthen his case for pulling an O'Malley, for shifting the Yankees to another state.
Unfortunately for the man from Tampa, the evidence is that a pennant race is taking place in the Bronx.

The two telecommunications giants, which announced the alliance in June, said the venture's worldwide headquarters would be in the northern Virginia suburbs near Washington, where MCI is based.
They have not chosen a specific site for the company, which is expected to employ 1,000 employees worldwide.

Joe Willie Namath Is Now Free Joe Willie
The end of Joe Namath's six-year NBC career as a pro football analyst, announced late last month, seems as awkward as his sad final playing days with the Los Angeles Rams after his glory years with the Jets.
Jimmy Walsh, Namath's agent, said: "I don't understand how they evaluated that Joe couldn't play a major role. They made a calculated decision that Joe wasn't important. In celebrity value, Joe doesn't take a back seat to any one of their analysts. Joe knows as much about football as the other guys."


Christopher Is Returning to Syria, Pressing the Role of 'Intermediary'
On the third day of his trip to the Middle East, Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced today that he was returning to Damascus for a second round of discussions with Syrian leaders.
In traveling back to Syria on the last day of his Middle East trip, Mr.
Christopher appeared to be moving into the role of what he has termed an "active intermediary," in effect becoming a messenger in the first contacts between Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin of Israel and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria since the Middle East peace talks began in October 1991.
Before this trip, discussions between Israel and Syria occurred between their negotiators in Washington.

USX-U.S. Steel
Since the International Trade Commission's ruling on July 27 that eliminated many tariffs on imported steel, shares of USX-U.S.
Steel Group have plummeted from $36.625 just before the announcement of the ruling.
On Tuesday, steelmakers petitioned the commission to reconsider the issue, but the stock has continued to decline.


Handling a Campus Demagogue
Dr.
Leonard Jeffries, the bigoted chairman of black studies at the City College of New York, has won another legal battle against the university.
This spring a jury assessed $400,000 in damages against the university for unconstitutionally removing Dr.
Jeffries from his chairmanship.
Now a Federal judge in New York is ordering him reinstated, forcing the public to endow his bogus scholarship with a chairman's prestige and power.
Judge Kenneth Conboy had little choice given the hash made of the Jeffries case by university officials and state lawyers.
As the judge made clear, with more courage, candor and wisdom, university officials could have disciplined and even demoted Dr.
Jeffries, whose notoriously racist 1991 speech was only a symptom of his inadequacy as an educator.
Indeed, the decision can be read as a blueprint on how the university might deal with Dr.
Jeffries should he continue to spout venom that ignores sound scholarship.

Topics of The Times; 'Sunset' Lights a City Park
"Sunset Boulevard," Billy Wilder's 1950 classic, played to a packed park in mid-Manhattan this week.
Norma Desmond, the faded star played by Gloria Swanson, would have loved it -- an acre of movie fans adoring her image on a giant silver screen, just a short step from the first-run houses on Broadway.
The theater was Bryant Park, the elegantly restored block behind the New York Public Library.
For too long the park was infested by drug dealers, and no place for the unwary.
Revived with private donations, it now resembles the Tuileries in Paris -- gravel paths, green chairs and all.
Home Box Office, Warner Brothers and the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation are co-sponsors of the film series, which runs for eight more Mondays.
Next week it's "King Kong," starting at dusk.

U.S. and Cuba Team Up Against a Pilot
In a rare instance of cooperation between the United States and Cuba, Federal law-enforcement officials are pursuing, with Havana's help, criminal charges against a pilot who commandeered a Cuban commuter flight last year and flew the airplane and its 52 passengers to freedom.
To the alarm and anger of the large and powerful Cuban exile community here, crew members who had returned to Cuba were brought back to Miami this week to meet with Federal prosecutors, according to lawyers for the pilot, Carlos Cancio Porcel.
The lawyers said the Cuban witnesses were seen entering the Federal Courthouse here today to testify before a grand jury that was meeting there.

Jeffries Return Hinders Plans to Alter Department
A Federal judge's decision this week to reinstate Dr.
Leonard Jeffries as the head of the black studies department at City College has put a major crimp in plans to change the department's direction, people at the college said yesterday.
While Dr.
Jeffries has won a loyal following at City College by virtue of his powerful personal style and his appeal to racial pride, the hope of the administration was to move toward greater academic respectability and prestige for black studies.

Pittsburgh Steelers
Barry Foster returned to the Pittsburgh Steelers yesterday after missing 20 days of practice in a pay dispute, his wallet potentially $80,000 lighter.
Foster, who led the American Conference with 1,690 rushing yards in 1992, has two years left on a contract he signed last August.
It will pay him $460,000 in base salary this season, $40,000 less than fullback Merril Hoge and more than $2 million less than Buffalo's Thurman Thomas, who rushed for 203 fewer yards.

Program to Preserve Families Draws Child-Welfare Debate
Over the last decade, New York City and 30 states have turned to a social program that seemed to offer remarkable results.
With just a brief but intensive dose of counseling and social services, proponents said, the appealingly named "family preservation" program would keep families together and children out of expensive foster care.
The Clinton Administration has embraced the approach.
But as Congress considers a budget package this week that would pour more money into such programs, researchers say a growing body of evidence suggests that family preservation has not lived up to its name.

Whitman and her husband, John, a financial consultant, paid more than $1.3 million in taxes to the Federal Government and the states of New Jersey and New York on a total income of $3,597,063.

Restaurants
Frontiere
In a neighborhood of trendy restaurants and double air kisses, the greeting of choice at Frontiere is the hug.
Not that this eight-month-old spot doesn't attract its nightly share of the gorgeous downtown crowd, but, as the name Frontiere -- French for border -- indicates, the restaurant toes a line between sincerity and fashionable exhibitionism and manages to unite the best of both worlds.
Similarly, Frontiere leaves behind culinary and design cliches.
The menu, with dishes like "la charcuterie del giorno" suggests a melding of the bordering cuisines of southern France and northern Italy, though the food is not restricted to that area.
Andrew Nathan, the 29-year-old owner and chef, offers food that is fresh, flavorful and direct, prepared with confidence and unburdened by excessive touches of creative whimsy.

To the Editor:
It strains logic for you to endorse the thrust of the national airline commission recommendations (editorial, July 23), but question the one with the most immediate beneficial effect: a break from excessive taxation.
The commission was right on target in concluding that "the Federal Government imposes a large and disproportionate tax burden on the airline industry that impedes its return to financial health."

From Israeli Site, News of House of David
An Israeli archeologist has discovered a fragment of a stone monument with inscriptions bearing the first known reference outside the Bible to King David and the ruling dynasty he founded, the House of David.
Scholars of biblical history said this was strong corroborating evidence for the existence and influence of the House of David in early Jewish history and in the traditions of both Judaism and Christianity.
In their excitement, they used words like "phenomenal," "stunning" and "sensational" to emphasize the importance of the discovery in biblical archeology.


Lewis's Doctor Says More Testing Was in the Works
Reggie Lewis, the late Boston Celtics captain, died the night before his doctors were to make final plans to monitor his heart while he played basketball, his doctor said in a statement issued today.
It was the first statement from Lewis's doctor, Gilbert H. Mudge, since Lewis collapsed and died while shooting baskets on July 27.
The statement came a day following a preliminary report from the Chief Medical Examiner of Massachusetts, who said that an autopsy showed that Lewis's heart "was abnormal, enlarged and was extensively scarred."


Market Place; A Debt Offering Reveals A Fashion Family's Feud
The prospectus by Guess?
Inc. for a private debt offering of $120 million provides some insights about the split between the company's chairman, Georges Marciano, and his brothers, who have combined innovative designs, fabrics and advertising to make Guess? jeans a fashion sensation.
"Over the course of the past two years, Georges Marciano and Maurice, Paul and Armand Marciano have had differing opinions regarding certain aspects of the company's business," said the offering memorandum, which has been circulated to just a few potential investors and provides a rare peek into a privately held company with profitability that has, until now, only been rumored.

After three months of record-breaking heat and virtually no rain, the sky turned black and the winds kicked up and swollen rain clouds swirled over Tom Garrison's Denver Downs Farm here today.

Garrison to contemplate his stunted corn and hungry cows and the worst drought he could remember.


For Mets, Big Fall But Sweet Recovery
It looked over when Jeromy Burnitz blasted his first career grand slam over the right field wall in the fifth inning.
The knock was so decisive that Larry Walker, the Expos' right fielder, did not bother to move or turn his head.
The Mets' lead by then was eight runs and Eric Hillman, the New York starter, looked convincingly strong on the mound.
And so the Mets figured that a victory would end this miserable trip, a seven-game jaunt during which baseball had been far overshadowed by Vince Coleman's problems with the law.

Mention "a date which will live in infamy," and most Americans think of Dec. 7, 1941.

Manhattan Bars Are Focus in 5 Gay Men's Deaths
Investigators, still looking for possible links in the deaths of five men whose dismembered bodies were discarded along highways and roadways in three states, have been questioning customers and bartenders at bars and restaurants in New York City where four of the men were last seen.
The investigators, including several from the New York Police Department, have also talked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation about whether there have been similar cases elsewhere in the country, said Kenneth Gribetz, the District Attorney for Rockland County, where the most recent discovery was made on Saturday.


Tow-Truck Driver Accused of Fraud

Ex-Ruling Party in Japan Stalls Election of a Premier
The Liberal Democratic Party may have lost its 38-year grip on power, but today, in its new role as the opposition party, it proved strong enough to delay the election of a new Prime Minister and dampen the hopes of the coalition government.
What was foreseen as a day of triumph for the seven-party coalition poised to take power instead became a series of humiliating delays and disputes that left Morihiro Hosokawa, the coalition's leader, looking wounded and kept him from the Prime Minister's seat -- at least for now.


Rotation: Jean In for Hutton
If one rookie pitcher does not work out in the rotation in a pennant race, try another one.
That is the philosophy the Yankees used yesterday when they sent back Mark Hutton to their Class AAA Columbus team and said that Domingo Jean would be summoned from the minors to start Sunday against the Twins.
Outfielder Gerald Williams will join the Yankees Friday and Saturday in Minnesota and then be replaced on the roster by Jean.
Jean will become the second Yankee pitcher in three weeks to make his major league debut as the club scurries to evaluate its young starters while it continues to discuss possible trades.
General Manager Gene Michael said he was still talking to teams about pitching help.
"It would be nice to see all the people before we make a trade, if we do," Michael said.


Farmers in the Flood Plain Explore Their Lost Worlds

U.S. Says Bomb Plotters Talked About Kidnapping
The men who plotted to bomb the United Nations and other New York City targets also discussed kidnapping, taking hostages and "myriad other terrorist activities," a prosecutor said yesterday.
The assertion, in a letter to a Federal District Court Judge, Michael B. Mukasey, was the first indication that the 11 defendants now under arrest may have been involved in a conspiracy broader than the bombing plans already outlined in existing criminal complaints.


Review/Film; Back on the Trail Of a One-Armed Man
A LOT of us watched Dr.
Richard Kimble catch his one-armed man in the final episode of "The Fugitive," the hit television series that lasted four years in the mid-1960's.
And not many of us have given Dr.
Kimble a moment's thought since then.
So there was no reason to expect much from a feature-length "Fugitive," since it had the makings of one more present-day project with a desperately nostalgic ring.
If Hollywood has taught us anything lately, it's that old television shows never die; they just get rehashed on a bigger, costlier scale.
Not this time, however.
The film version of "The Fugitive" turns out to be a smashing success, a juggernaut of an action-adventure saga that owes nothing to the past.
As directed sensationally by Andrew Davis and acted to steely perfection by Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones and a flawless supporting cast, it is a film whose every element conspires to sustain crisp intelligence and a relentless pace.
Tight editing, a powerhouse score, adroit sound effects and a clever, inventive screenplay all contribute mightily to the fever pitch.
To put it simply, this is a home run.


State-of-the-Art Jail, or a Monument to Poor Planning?

And it seems to be much less than was hoped for by the upstart communications companies, which are supposed to benefit from the Federal Communications Commission's decision.

Review/Film; Small-Town Eccentrics And a Brash Newcomer
In a tiny Swedish village, a funeral is taking place.
The dead man, Erik Zander (Per Oscarsson), was a bohemian sort who traveled on a bicycle and wore a beret, and he was knocked off his bicycle by the local minister, who was driving his car and listening to Abba at the time.
"Erik is lucky with the weather, anyway," one of the pallbearers gamely says.
Erik was eccentric, and he was also a wealthy landowner, one whose estate is now much in demand.
It is virtually within the grasp of Axel Flogfalt (Sven Wollter), a crafty but dense local farmer, when a strange young woman arrives at the funeral.
Fashionable in black, she zips into town on a motorcycle, accompanied by a raffish male friend with an earring and an evil grin.
Her identity remains a mystery until she reaches the cemetery, at which point she cries out, "It's a shame I never met you, Grandpa!" At this, several of Axel's relatives very nearly tumble into the grave.


House to Back More Flood Aid
The leadership of the House of Representatives has decided to accept the larger, $5.8 billion aid bill for Midwestern flood victims passed by the Senate on Wednesday, Congressional officials said today.
Last week the House passed a $3 billion flood-aid bill.
Normally, a House-Senate conference would be called to reach a compromise between the two bills, but the House leadership decided to move to approve the plan with the Senate's dollar amount.
This was done in the hope of sending an aid package to President Clinton before the August recess, scheduled to begin this weekend.

The Lawyers' Race to the Bottom
Many lawyers like paradox, and here's one they like especially, because it's about them.
Americans despise lawyers, yet we can't get enough of them.
The legal thriller -- John Grisham's "The Firm," Scott Turow's "Pleading Guilty" -- is a hot genre, so big it's become a new category in the book business and has crossed over to do major box office at the movies.
To explain their dubious prominence, lawyers like the notion that the law has become America's civic religion.
In a country where people are plagued by doubt or divided by creed, the law is said to provide common ground.
Americans hate lawyers because we expect them to compare with priests, and are enraged by their shortcomings.
We are riveted by legal thrillers because we want to know what's wrong with an institution that should stand for what's right.

It may not make her a favorite to win the race, but if luck counts, SUZANNE McKECHNIE, a 25-year-old runner from Portland, Me., should make a good showing in the 24th New York City Marathon on Nov. 14.
Hers was the first name out of the box at City Hall yesterday when the marathon's director, FRED LEBOW, conducted a drawing to fill 5,000 of the race's 25,000 places from among 28,000 hopefuls.
The first 12,000 places were filled earlier on a first-come, first-in basis and another 8,000 places are reserved for runners from abroad.


Review/Film; Recollections of Adolescent Roilings
"That Night," Alice McDermott's haunting and elusive portrait of a Long Island suburb in the early 1960's, is a novel filtered through the viewpoint of a pre-adolescent girl.
With hindsight, writing many years later, she narrates the story and reconstructs her first true glimpses of the adult world.
As a child, she was fascinated by a daring, rebellious teen-ager named Sheryl, and by the way Sheryl's exploits brought their tiny community to the boiling point.
Sheryl is seen and imagined from a great distance.
The book contrasts its characters' private yearnings with their middle-class propriety, and it is full of secrets.
The film version of "That Night" has no secrets at all.
With Juliette Lewis as Sheryl and Eliza Dushku as a precocious 10-year-old called Alice Bloom (the novel's narrator was nameless), it works awkwardly to dramatize all the feelings that Ms.
McDermott carefully left unspoken.
As written and directed by Craig Bolotin, the film invents an unconvincing friendship between Sheryl and Alice, makes Alice the third wheel in Sheryl's furtive love affair with Rick (C. Thomas Howell), and fleshes out any extra ambiguity with a blunt selection of pop songs on the soundtrack.
When Alice says about Sheryl and Rick, for instance, "I wanted them to stay around forever," the song heard in the background is "Stay."

The United States is pressing NATO to broaden its threatened air strikes against Serbian forces to include roads, bridges, supply depots and command posts, senior officials said today.
As conveyed by the officials in a briefing for reporters, the message was aimed both at Washington's allies and at the Serbian commanders, who have not yet loosened their noose around the Bosnian capital.


'Man With Golden Arm' Starts Preminger Series
A seven-week series of films produced and directed by Otto Preminger is opening today at Film Forum 2 with "The Man With the Golden Arm." The 1955 film about drug addiction, starring Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak, successfully challenged the censorship of Hollywood's Production Code.
Among the 31 films that will be screened during the series, which is to run through Sept. 23, are "Advise and Consent," "Saint Joan," "Carmen Jones," "The Moon Is Blue," "Anatomy of a Murder," "Laura," "Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon" and "Exodus."


A Christian Who Implicated Egyptian Militant Is Killed
A Christian pharmacist was shot and killed tonight, apparently by Muslim militants because he cooperated with the Government in its drive to curb the Islamic movement, security officials said.
The victim, Philip al-Qummus Basilius, 36, was shot in his pharmacy in the town of Dayrut al Sherif, 175 miles south of Cairo, after providing evidence in court against a Muslim militant.


Giuliani Begins Taking Message to the Airwaves
After months of intermittent skirmishing, Rudolph W. Giuliani has moved the New York City mayoral campaign into the very-high-frequency war that really counts: paid television and radio advertising that starts by portraying the former prosecutor as a warm, regular guy in an effort to pre-empt Mayor David N. Dinkins's stepped-up attacks on him.
The silent tag line on one of his TV commercials reads: "He'll fight as hard for you and your family as he does for his own."


No Bragging, No Crying After Split
Two victories, two defeats, two teams wondering just what it was that was proved at Yankee Stadium this week.
A lot, according to the Toronto Blue Jays, a somewhat surprising synopsis since it was the Blue Jays who had won the first two games from the Yankees only to drop the final two and restoke the Yankees' division title hopes.

Review/Opera; 2 American Gaps in Weill Are Filled
The Kurt Weill revival of the last 15 years has done much to illuminate the musical journey this adaptable composer took from his early years as a Busoni disciple through his jazz-tinged works of the 1920's and 1930's to his final years as a Broadway composer.
Yet a glance at his catalogue shows that many of his works, including some pivotal ones, remain virtually unknown.
Weill's first opera, "The Protagonist," was a critical and popular success at its premiere in Dresden, Germany, in 1926, yet the current Santa Fe Opera production is its first American staging.
The company is pairing the one-act work with the opera Weill composed as a companion piece for it in 1927, "The Czar Has His Photograph Taken," in its first professional American production.
The double bill opened on July 31, and was repeated on Wednesday night.
Its final performance is Aug. 13.


Airlines Give Travelers a Three-Tiered Fare Cut
Travelers who played the waiting game this summer were rewarded yesterday when rival airlines not only matched the fare cuts announced by Delta Air Lines on Wednesday, offering discounts of up to 35 percent for travel through Dec. 15, but added three weeks to the start of the sale.
Delta had hoped to get past the busy Labor Day weekend before putting the discounts into effect on Sept. 15, but its rivals countered by allowing travel beginning Aug. 23.
Rather than risk losing passengers to other carriers, Delta also agreed yesterday to the earlier date.
But it dropped the 14-day advance purchase required by most other airlines, although a spokesman said last night that the carrier was reviewing whether to reinstate it.


Behind Beating Sentence: Guidelines and Sympathy
Even given strict sentencing guidelines intended to limit judicial discretion, Judge John G. Davies of United States District Court managed Wednesday to stun prosecutors, defendants and legal observers with his leniency toward the two police officers convicted in the beating of Rodney G. King.
And he did it with drama.
Reconvening a familiar cast in the same hushed, magisterial courtroom where a jury had convicted two officers and let two go last April, Judge Davies appeared at first to be moving toward a severe sentence.
One defendant's sister was sobbing openly.


RESULTS PLUS
GOLF Mize Leads With a 64  Larry Mize, spurred by an opening charge by his playing partner, John Huston, shot an eight-under-par 64 yesterday to lead the Buick Open in Grand Blanc, Mich., by two strokes.
Huston birdied the first five holes and finished the first round with a 66.
Payne Stewart and rookie Paul Goydos also were at six under in the final tuneup for next week's P.G.A.
Championship at Inverness in Toledo, Ohio.
Huston, in an early-morning threesome with Larry Mize and Rocco Mediate, began as if he could do no wrong at Warwick Hills.
"He had a tough start, didn't he?" said Mize, who had eight birdies in a bogey-free round.
"It's not hard to notice when a guy birdies the first five holes." (AP) Round of 63 Leads L.P.G.A.: Dana Lofland-Dormann matched the best round of the season with a 63 to take the first round lead in the McCall's L.P.G.A.
Classic in Stratton Mountain, Vt.
The third-year pro, who had one victory last year and a third-place finish this season, blistered the 6,077-yard, par-72 Stratton Mountain Country Club course for nine birdies and almost capped it with an eagle on the last hole. (AP) TENNIS Graf Takes Control Top-ranked Steffi Graf let a three-game lead slip away in the first set yesterday but then dominated to beat Sandrine Testud, 7-5, 6-1, and advance to the quarterfinals of the Mazda Classic in Carlsbad, Calif.
Graf will play today against seventh-seeded Mary Pierce, who advanced by beating No. 9 Naoko Sawamatsu, 6-1, 6-4, in another third-round match.
In other matches, second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated Petra Ritter, 6-2, 6-1, and fifth-seeded Magdelena Maleeva beat Jennifer Santrock, 6-3, 6-1. (AP) McEnroe to Play Sampras: Patrick McEnroe, more assured of his play with each match, rallied past eighth-seeded Brad Gilbert 6-7, (8-10), 6-3, 6-0, to advance to the quarterfinals of the Volvo-Los Angeles tournament.
In a late match, top-seeded Pete Sampras defeated Mauricio Hadad, 6-4, 6-0, and will face McEnroe in the next round.
McEnroe, ranked 87th in the world, dropped the first-set tiebreaker on a netted forehand, then made an excellent recovery and had little trouble with Gilbert in the last two sets.
He won in 2 hours 16 minutes.
Fourth-seeded Richard Krajicek, the defending champion from the Netherlands, escaped with a 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-0 victory in the second round over Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, and fifth-seeded Aleksandr Volkov of Russia defeated Michael Joyce, 6-1, 6-3. (AP) Ivanisevic Wins: Top-seeded Goran Ivanisevic routed Gilbert Schaller, 6-2, 6-1, in 56 minutes to reach the quarterfinals of the Philips Head Cup in Kitzbuhel, Austria.
Italy's 50-foot Mandrake collided with Promotion of the Netherlands at the first mark turn off Hayling Bay near Cowes, England.

(AP) EMPIRE STATE GAMES Successful Return Dave McFadgen bounded back from a two-year, drug-related suspension from athletic competition yesterday to win his 10th triple jump title at the Empire State Games in Rochester.
McFadgen jumped 51 feet 3 inches on the first day of competition.

Ferrer Sues For Cleanup Of the Bronx
Saying that filth hurts the Bronx's image and business, Borough President Fernando Ferrer yesterday took the unusual step of suing the city to clean up highways and major thoroughfares and to fill in hundreds of potholes.
But Mayor David N. Dinkins quickly issued a statement saying that the Bronx -- fighting to keep the Yankees and perennially nervous about its reputation -- is actually cleaned better than other boroughs.
He cited arcane statistics that showed in part how intent City Hall was to fend off the prickly attack, which came from a political supporter not long before the mayoral election.


Rabid Raccoon Is Discovered In Flushing
A rabid raccoon has been found in Queens, indicating that an outbreak of rabies that has steadily moved up the East Coast has now spread to all five boroughs of New York City, officials said yesterday.
The city's Department of Health has now confirmed 75 cases of rabies in animals since it declared the disease endemic in New York in March 1992.
Health officials warned that the widening outbreak posed a significant threat to people and pets, although so far the cases in the city have been confined to wild animals.

A Family Slain at Home Is Mourned in Hartford
Atop one coffin was a small teddy bear.
On another was a Yankees cap.
A third had a textbook, "Mastering Electronics," on top, and on a fourth was an open Bible.
The Marquez family was buried today, six days after the police say they were slain by a relative they had taken in and tried to befriend.
On Saturday, three of their bodies were discovered on the banks of the East River in Brooklyn.
Struggling to Understand
More than 500 people crowded into a funeral home here today to mourn the family, who lived in South Windsor, a rural suburb of Hartford.
Many were still struggling to understand what had happened.

False Fear of Automated Tolls
Toll collectors have lowered the gate on the New York State Thruway's plans to collect some tolls electronically.
Their union got an injunction last week on grounds that collectors could be hit crossing lanes to get to their booths.
The case is headed for arbitration, but experience in Houston and New Orleans indicates no real risk.
Electronic toll collection involves advance payment by a motorist, who is then issued a small tag to paste inside the windshield.
A computer reads the tag each time the car goes through an electronic gate, and deducts the toll from the prepaid account.
When an account runs low, the tag-holder replenishes it, or additional payment can be withdrawn automatically from the tag-holder's bank account.


Regulation Can Save Air Industry From Itself
To the Editor:
The preliminary findings of a Government commission charged with reviving the airline business have been cheered by the industry.
One would not expect less from a report that promises to continue the past's failed policies.
The findings seem to acknowledge that cutthroat competition and a frantic drive for monopoly are to blame for today's problems.
But our experience of how unlimited deregulation stirs predatory corporate behavior seems to be ignored.
Instead, the commmission appears to endorse even less regulation, rather than reregulation, proposing to transfer the functions of the Federal Aviation Administration to an independent self-financed (and undoubtedly industry-run) corporation.
These ideas would not cure but aggravate the industry's ills.

THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: Political Memo; The Public Is Confused, And Getting Suspicious
From Joan N. Baggett, the White House political director, it was a frank admission of reality: As hard as President Clinton tried in his address on Tuesday to portray his budget package as fair, most Americans simply don't believe him.
"My husband said after watching both the President and Senator Dole's response, 'No wonder people are cynical and turned off to Government: You have the President telling them one thing and Senator Dole telling them the exact opposite,' " Ms.
Baggett said.
"When there's that much confusion, voters have reason to be suspicious."


Review/Film; Loving Him to Death
"Being at Home With Claude" is a film that goes to great lengths to pump cinematic frenzy into a story that originated as a long-winded stage drama of sexual obsession.
Adapted from a play by Rene-Daniel DuBois, it follows the interrogation of Yves (Roy Dupuis), a 22-year-old male prostitute in Montreal, several days after he has murdered his lover on a steamy July night.
The inspector (Jacques Godin) who does the grilling specializes in dealing with hustlers.
His interrogation, in the library of a judge who is one of the prostitute's clients, is a strident, often confusing cat-and-mouse game.
Because Yves has already admitted to the homicide, the goal isn't to extract a confession but to reconstruct the events surrounding the crime and to determine the motive.


Health Care Overhaul Is Approved in Oregon
Just before sunrise today the State Legislature approved a five-year experiment to expand health care for Oregon's poor and to require employers to provide health insurance for workers.
On the final day of the longest legislative session in the state's history, the lawmakers approved the plan, which will provide Medicaid to an additional 120,000 Oregonians living below the poverty level, a 50 percent increase in the number of people covered.
The state now provides coverage to about 245,000 poor residents.

Perversely, Yen's Rise May Prolong the Japanese Recession
The sharp swings in European currency markets may ultimately encourage a recovery in some of Europe's depressed economies by bringing down interest rates and making foreign products cheaper.
But in Japan, the crisis may well have the opposite effect and could extinguish early flickers of an economic rebound.
While attention has been focused on the decline in the value of the French franc, the level of German interest rates, and the future of the European Monetary System, the yen has jumped in value against the dollar, setting off concern that Japan's nascent recovery from a long recession may be cut short.

Regulation Can Save Air Industry From Itself; Burden on Passengers
To the Editor:
While in general agreement with "A Sensible Look at the Airline 'Crisis' " (editorial, July 23), on the national airline commission, I take exception to your statement that the commission is wrong to call for tax relief for the industry.
In 1990, Congress increased Federal ticket and cargo excise taxes and authorized local airports to begin imposing passenger facility charges.
These two initiatives increase passenger air fares as much as $2 billion a year.
As the New York hotel industry has experienced because of the city's excessive room tax rates, taxes on travel not only drive up the price of service but also discourage travel.


Is NATO's Threat Real?
Having agreed on Tuesday to American demands to threaten the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes unless they stopped their "strangulation" of Sarajevo, the NATO alliance now faces what may be its most crucial decision since the end of the cold war: whether to carry out the threat.
The key moment appears to be a meeting of NATO ambassadors at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels scheduled for Monday.

One of the secret pleasures of high summer in Manhattan is that we can walk into the European Paintings galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and tick off the summer loans, one by one.

Major works of art should not be left in empty rooms.
Storage and insurance cost money.
Pictures lent to the Met are well looked after in a privileged environment and give pleasure to others.

Cuomo Vetoes Bill to Expand Health Plans
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo today vetoed a bill that would have required all health insurance policies sold in New York State to include coverage for immunizations and so-called well-child visits for youths through age 19.
The veto surprised and angered the bill's sponsors and children's advocates, who considered the bill the most significant achievement of the 1992 legislative session.
They said they were dumbfounded by the Governor's opposition to a bill that was written to bring down health-care costs in the long run through a modest, short-term increase in health insurance premiums.

NATIONALIST SERBS SAY THEY WILL EASE SIEGE OF SARAJEVO
Serbian nationalist leaders met here in emergency session today and announced a pullback of their troops from newly won territory on two strategic mountains southwest of Sarajevo, apparently fearing that failure to do so could bring on the NATO air strikes threatened earlier in the week if the Serbian forces continued their "strangulation" of Sarajevo.
The announcement was the first in the 16-month Bosnian war in which Serbian military commanders have made specific agreements to withdraw from any of the territory they have conquered, which amounts to more than 70 percent of Bosnia.


U.S. and Canada Make Deal On Beer Amid Trade Talks
The United States and Canada settled a five-year-old trade dispute today that had threatened to result in sharply higher prices for imported Canadian beer.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and Trade Minister Thomas Hockin of Canada struck the deal during a recess from their continuing negotiations on labor and environmental issues linked to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The talks, which also include Trade Minister Jaime Serra Puche of Mexico, are scheduled to continue on Friday.

Steakhouse Chains Are Coming
This fall, two national steakhouse chains plan to challenge New York's loyalty to favorites like Peter Luger, Palm, the Old Homestead, Sparks and Smith &amp; Wollensky.
After 28 years, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, a group of 39 restaurants based in New Orleans, is finally adding Manhattan to its list of locations.
It plans to open at 148 West 51st Street in late September.
Morton's, a chain of 25 restaurants that was founded in Chicago in 1978, has taken over the 150-seat premises at 551 Fifth Avenue, at 45th Street, which were once occupied by the Cattleman restaurant.
It expects to greet customers by the end of September.


Gold's Long, Seductive Climb Ends in a Flash
Gold prices plunged yesterday in a frenzied day of trading as investors dumped their holdings amid the easing of Europe's currency crisis and rumors of sales by China's central bank.
The sharp drop in prices came amid what traders described as a marketwide panic.
A broad swath of international investors, mutual funds and speculators unloaded gold on fears that demand was softening even as the price was reaching a speculative peak.

Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor missed the second practice today with back spasms he suffered during the first practice.
Taylor was in bed, resting his back in the afternoon, but team officials say the spasms are not serious enough to keep him out of Saturday's game against Cincinnati.


Ryan Had Made Plans To Come Out Swinging
ROBIN VENTURA of the Chicago White Sox got the lesson of his life Wednesday night, going one on one with Texas Rangers pitcher NOLAN RYAN.

"I decided I was going to be the aggressor. I wasn't going to just take it."

Topics of The Times; 1.5 Bureaucrats per Patient
Remember the old jokes about the Agriculture Department, playing off the fact that as the number of American farmers declined, the number of bureaucrats kept soaring?
One day, the story goes, an official was spotted crying in the hallway.
"What's the matter?" he was asked.
"My farmer just died," he replied.
Well, something very like that is going on in hospitals right now.
A paper in The New England Journal of Medicine reports that an astonishing 25 percent of the average American hospital's spending in 1990 went for administration.
"In many hospitals," the study found, "as the number of patients declined, the number of bureaucrats increased to battle with competing hospitals over market share and with insurers over payment."

Peru Is Expected to Extend Death Penalty to Terrorists
After the capture last September of Abimael Guzman Reynoso, the founder of the Maoist guerrilla organization called Shining Path, President Alberto K. Fujimori has said repeatedly that he would like to see the death penalty visited on the man whose 13-year insurgency has led to the death of almost 30,000 Peruvians.
At a meeting in Brazil last month of Latin American leaders, President Fujimori said that if he had ever met Mr.
Guzman face to face and had had a gun with him, "I would have sent him to hell."


Salomon Picks Arbitrage Chief
Salomon Brothers said yesterday that Dennis J. Keegan had been named to head fixed-income arbitrage in the United States.
Mr.

He replaces Lawrence E. Hilibrand, who announced plans two weeks ago to leave the company.


Why Bonn Is Buzzing: More Unmasked Spies
A delayed case of spy fever has gripped this little capital on the Rhine, a hotbed of Communist spies all through the cold war.
In the last week, two members of Parliament and the head of the main center for refugees in Berlin during the cold war have been accused of spying for East Germany before Communism collapsed there in 1989.
The charges have been by the press, not yet by prosecutors.
But prosecutors have arrested a top German official in NATO headquarters in Brussels and his British wife, and questioned a German journalist in Bonn and her husband on charges of espionage.


Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's Line to a $20 Million Telephone Account is Suddenly and Sharply Disconnected.
MOBILINK, the cellular telephone consortium formed by 15 leading North American telecommunications companies, unexpectedly changed agencies yesterday without a review.
The fledgling concern, which includes six of the seven Baby Bell regional telephone companies, moved its account, with billings estimated to exceed $20 million, to J. Walter Thompson San Francisco after only eight months at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising in New York.
Saatchi's sudden, swift disconnection was surprising even by current standards of client fidelity to agencies, which could be best described as "What have you done for me yesterday?" Mobilink's here's-your-hat-what's-your-hurry notice, which was faxed to Saatchi, was particularly startling because the initial campaign the agency created did not begin running until July 1.


Review/Film; Prom Night Was Never Like This
If you crossed an Archie comic book with a teen-age zombie film and added a dash of "Carrie," plus smidgens of "Ghost" and "Defending Your Life," you might end up with a movie like "My Boyfriend's Back." The one-joke comedy is the whimsical autobiography of Johnny Dingle (Andrew Lowery), a teen-ager killed in a robbery who returns from the grave for the sole purpose of escorting his sweetheart, Missy McCloud (Traci Lind), to the prom.
It is only hours after his interment that Johnny pops up from the earth, arm first, clutching the single red rose Missy tossed onto his lowered coffin.
Minutes later, he cheerfully shakes off the dirt and heads for home, where his parents (Edward Herrmann and Mary Beth Hurt) greet him as casually as if he had just stepped around the corner to pick up a quart of milk.


Sleuths at Sea
Many weekend sailors would sooner put into shore than toss a beer can or plastic cup overboard.
Regrettably, no comparable sense of environmental stewardship burdens the corporate managers and captains of some of the huge cruise ships that ply America's offshore waters.
Conservation groups estimate that of the seven million tons of waste illegally dumped into the oceans, 15 percent can be traced to cruise ships.
Lately, however, tourists with a strong conscience and a talent for undercover work have offered hope.
An article in The Times last week reported that Princess Cruise Lines recently paid a record $500,000 fine after pleading guilty to illegal dumping.
The crucial evidence was supplied by a Michigan couple, Alvin and Marilyn Levett, who videotaped the crew of the Royal Princess hurling plastic bags into the sea off the Florida Keys.
Under a Federal whistle-blowers' program, the couple received half the fine, or $250,000.
Two other similar cases are now under Federal investigation.

HOUSE PASSES BUDGET PLAN, BACKING CLINTON BY 218-216 AFTER HECTIC MANEUVERING
After a day of frantic maneuvering to lock up the final votes, the House of Representatives narrowly approved President Clinton's five-year economic plan tonight, putting him on the verge of the most important victory of his young Presidency.
The vote, in doubt until the final gavel, was 218 to 216.
All 175 Republicans voted against the measure, but they were joined by only 41 Democrats.
The victory was provided by the 217 Democrats and one independent who stood with the President.


Review/Music; Manchester's Gloom Patrol Catches Dance Fever in Jersey
Manchester, England has fomented two rock movements: dank, dystopian post-punk rock as the 1970's ended and propulsive, synthesizer-driven dance music from the mid-1980's to the present.
One Manchester band, New Order, has been part of both waves, from its beginnings as Joy Division to its current incarnation, singing tales of vague, gloomy love amid computerized syncopations.
On Wednesday night at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., New Order aligned itself with dance music, sharing a triple bill with 808 State, also from Manchester, and Sunscreem, an English band with a canny combination of dance rhythms and pop melodies.
A good part of the crowd stood up and shimmied, even for the opening acts.

Connecticut Girl Is Found
A 9-year-old Connecticut girl whose father reported her missing from the Bronx was found in her mother's custody last night, and the police said they planned to charge the father with filing a false report.
The police said the father, Edwin R. Marraquin, had staged the girl's disappearance as part of a custody dispute, but the purpose of the hoax was not entirely clear.
"The child was in fact given to the mother in Connecticut," said Captain Eugene P. Murphy of the Bronx.
"He's going to have to answer for filing a false report." Police had been looking for the girl, Leslie Carena Marraquin-Rodriguez, since her father, of Stamford, Conn., reported her missing on Wednesday.
The father said she had disappeared after walking out of an apartment in University Heights to go to a store.

Sometimes it's hard to sort out the product messages, price slashing and rebate offers related to hit movies and their videocassettes.
For example, in "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," which was released on tape last week by Fox, there is a pause in the action at the Plaza Hotel while young Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) announces the hotel's "800" reservations number.
It would have taken him several deep breaths to rattle off all the other companies and deals on items from shoelaces to air fares that are tied to the film in promotions.

In a Bright Career, the Glare of a Harassment Trial
As a lawyer who once served a Governor, as president of a major art foundation, and as a well-connected Republican who considered running for Mayor of Philadelphia, Richard H. Glanton has encountered his share of contention and controversy.
But none of that has pushed Mr.
Glanton into the kind of spotlight trained on him by a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by a former associate, a case that has been heard in Federal District Court here for the last five weeks.
The case has fascinated Philadelphians because the testimony is titillating and because it echoes the issues raised during the confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court two years ago.

Victims of Layoffs Seek More Than Job Advice
EXCEPT for the edge of desperation, it seemed like an ordinary convention of thriving professionals.
There were registration tables, exhibits, workshops, coffee urns flanked by mounds of glistening danishes.
But the 2,000 people who came to this college town this week were not thriving.
They had been laid off, excessed, dislocated or fired in some other euphemistic fashion.
Some had journeyed here to nurse bruises that still hadn't healed, others to figure out what they were doing wrong -- why after months of searching they had not landed a job.


Autopsy on Counsel to President Points to Suicide
Investigators said today that the autopsy of Vincent W. Foster Jr., the deputy White House counsel, appeared to confirm that his death two weeks ago was a suicide.
Mr.
Foster was found dead July 20 in a nearby Virginia park with a gunshot wound to the head.
Officials said today that the autopsy found gunpowder burns on Mr.
Foster's hand, strong evidence that he had fired the weapon that killed him.
The bullet that went through Mr.
Foster's head has not been recovered, officials said.


Sherrard: Fancy Step For Giants On Offense
Mike Sherrard and Mark Jackson knew everything about each other even before they met.
Sherrard's grandmother lives in Denver and is a big Broncos fan.
Sherrard's grandmother also loves the dog track.
And who would she see at the track from time to time?
Mark Jackson.
He would talk about the Broncos and she would brag about her grandson, who was also a wide receiver in the National Football League.
So when Jackson and Sherrard finally met, it was as if they already knew each other.
Now, they're good friends.
They hang out together, eat together, and together the Giants think the duo can combine to become a tremendous offensive threat.

Delahoussaye Rides His 5,000 Winners Into Hall
Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode A.P.
Indy and 5,000 other winners, and Tom Kelly, who trained 65 stakes winners, were inducted into racing's Hall of Fame today along with three legendary horses of the past: Cavalcade, Personal Ensign and Alysheba.
It was a day when memories were revived and races rerun before a crowd of 2,000 racing officials and tourists who filled a huge tent next to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.
It is a stately brick building across Union Avenue from the 126-year-old Saratoga Race Course, and during the last 38 years the hall has become the home of racing history with niches honoring 69 jockeys, 66 trainers and 138 horses.


Critic's Choice; Free Shows Put Emphasis On Footwork
The Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival is famous for the astonishing variety of music, dance and theater that spills out across Lincoln Center Plaza and into nearby crannies.
This weekend's dance programs at the free festival, now in its 23d year, are a good example.
Tonight, dancegoers can start at 6 P.M. with "Red Squalls," a world premiere at the North Plaza (the space for which it was created) by Gus Solomons Jr., the choreographer, with music by Toby Twining and an architectural set design by Scott De Vere.

Israel Minister Meets P.L.O. Aide, Breaking a Longstanding Taboo
With the knowledge of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, an Israeli Cabinet Minister, Yossi Sarid, met secretly with a senior Palestine Liberation Organization member in Cairo, shattering one of Israel's most rigid political taboos, senior Israeli officials say.
The news of the meeting unleashed an acrimonious exchange in Israel between those who believe that the country must open direct negotiations with the P.L.O. and those who believe that the state should have no contact with what they term a terrorist group.

Sculpture's Season In the Sun
THE usually busy outdoor sculpture season has been made even busier this summer with exhibitions where art has not been shown before, or at least not in a while.
One of them, organized by the Sculpture Center in Manhattan, is the first to be held on Roosevelt Island.
It includes works by six artists.
Another is on Wards Island, where the Organization of Independent Artists has renewed a program of outdoor sculpture that was discontinued in 1984; the organization has put together more than 50 works, displayed across the grounds of the Manhattan Psychiatric Center.
Are all of the shows good?
Of course not.
The outdoor sculpture season is almost by definition a hodgepodge; nevertheless, this summer there happens to be a healthy share of decent work to see around New York City.


Jones in Green: Jets Sign Top Pick For Top Dollar
After two weeks of frustrating negotiations, the Jets headed off a possibly longer and acrimonious stalemate with their first-round selection, linebacker Marvin Jones, by coming to terms with him today on a five-year deal worth about $6 million, including a signing bonus of about $3.5 million.
Incentives could raise the value of the package to $7.5 million.
Jones agreed to terms after missing 14 days of training camp and is expected to sign when he arrives at camp on Friday.
He is expected to take a physical examination and travel with the Jets to their first preseason game at Pittsburgh on Saturday evening.
Jones will suit up, but isn't expected to play.

TV Weekend; A Troubled Child's Inexorable Path to Violence
It is easy to understand why "Punk," Carl Franklin's final thesis at the American Film Institute, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in directing, should have caught the eye of producers.
This half-hour drama, the latest offering in the "Alive TV" series, has the freshness of youth and the conviction of talent.
The focus is on 9-year-old Dominic, whose longing for a father, anxieties about sex and determination to be a man force him into a violent act that seems inevitable, although, of course, it settles nothing and leaves us wondering what else likable Dominic will be driven to do to prove to himself he is no punk.

Review/Pop; Choose a Tune and a Beat, Then Give Them a Twist
Leave it to NRBQ, the band with the bottomless repertory, to find the song for a set at Summerstage in Central Park: "Sitting in the Park," a mid-1960's near-hit by Billy Stewart.
The easy-swaying pop tune fit easily alongside NRBQ's own songs and other borrowed material, from Sun Ra's "Rocket No. 9" to Carl Perkins's "Get Rhythm." NRBQ socks all of them out, a wildly eclectic bunch of musicians thinly disguised as a good-timey bar band.
NRBQ was part of a Summerstage triple bill of pop-rock eccentrics last Saturday afternoon with Pere Ubu and They Might Be Giants.
All three bands love the simplicity of a good tune and a good beat; all three also thrive by warping those basic ingredients, whether with eruptions of jazz (NRBQ), an overlay of noise (Pere Ubu) or sudden hops from one style to another (They Might Be Giants).

Dole Campaign From 1988 Gets $120,000 Fine
Senator Bob Dole's 1988 campaign for President has agreed to pay more than $120,000 in civil penalties for election law violations, the largest settlement for any Presidential campaign organization, the Federal Election Commission said today.
In the settlement, Dole campaign officials admitted that they had committed several serious violations in raising and spending money for the 1988 Presidential primaries.
The campaign took in improper corporate contributions and exceeded the spending limits in the important states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and Mr.
Dole, a Kansas Republican, improperly used his political action committee to benefit his Presidential drive, the commission reported.

Too Much, Too Late: Yanks Falter in Minnesota
Gene Larkin's two-hop grounder bounded into the shortstop hole and Randy Velarde followed it.
Jeff Reboulet was racing from third base with the potential winning run.
Larkin was plodding to first.
Velarde's eyes were glued to the important bouncing ball.
He was chasing the third out of a 3-3 game in the bottom of the ninth.
Velarde glided five steps to his left, snatched the grounder, tried to switch the ball to his hand and it slipped out like a child dropping a lollipop.
The ball fell to the turf, Reboulet crossed safely and the Metrodome erupted because the Twins had emerged with a come-from-behind 4-3 victory tonight.
It was the 10th time this season that the Yankees had squandered a lead of three runs or more.

KEVORKIAN DETAILS HIS ROLE IN SUICIDE
Going further than ever before in his attempt to provoke the authorities to prosecute him, Dr.
Jack Kevorkian has described in detail how he helped a 30-year-old man suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease commit suicide on Wednesday.
The Wayne County prosecutor, John D. O'Hair, said after the man killed himself that he had not decided whether to charge Dr.
Kevorkian under Michigan's new law making it a felony to assist in a suicide.
The law, which was overturned once and then reinstated, is being appealed.
The suicide was the 17th in which Dr.
Kevorkian has assisted since 1990.


Shoemaker Suit Denied
A Superior Court judge in Pomona, Calif., yesterday dismissed a lawsuit filed by the former jockey BILL SHOEMAKER, who had charged that the state was negligent for not installing guardrails along Route 30 in San Dimas.
On the evening of April 8, 1991, Shoemaker drove his pickup truck off Route 30, overturned the vehicle and suffered severe spinal injuries.
Now paralyzed from the neck down, he and his attorneys charged that the state of California should have had guardrails in place to prevent the pickup truck, or any car, from tumbling down the adjacent embankment.


Stratford Tests Lessen Fears Over Dioxin
For the second time this week, test results have indicated that the town's hazardous-waste problems may not be as serious as initially feared.

Assessing the Danger of Asbestos Fibers
The health effects of asbestos in buildings has been one of the most contentious environmental issues of the last few years, but experts on all sides of the issue agree on one thing: asbestos is a threat only if its fibers escape into the air, where they can be inhaled.
That principle underlies Federal policy for handling asbestos in schools.
The policy says that school buildings should be inspected thoroughly for the presence of asbestos.
Crumbling or damaged asbestos should be removed, since fibers can easily become airborne.
But undamaged asbestos should be left in place and checked periodically, since removal could cause some of the material to crumble and fibers to escape.

The stock closed yesterday at $16.25, giving it a market capitalization of about $285 million.


Brazil Won't Retreat From Democracy
To the Editor:
Three articles on Brazil July 25 and 26 focused on the shooting of street children in Rio de Janeiro, economic uncertainty and the difficulties of the political process.
They also gave unwarranted emphasis to some isolated voices that anachronistically call for return to authoritarian rule, voices that meet with the nation's prompt, unanimous condemnation and with President Itamar Franco's rejection.


Weighing Mutual Funds On the Volatility Scale
THE most important measurement in assessing mutual fund risk is not one of those mathematical formulas clogged with squiggly Greek letters.
It's an investor's own pulse and how fast it races when a fund is falling.
"If this fund dropped 40 percent," said John D. Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors, "do you have the courage or the risk tolerance to say, 'O.K., I'm going to stay with it?' Will your plans survive or will you break?"

The Gap Inc. is testing a new line of lower-priced basic clothing in an attempt to attract more cost-conscious customers and improve the performance of some of its stores.
The move, which was first reported in The San Francisco Chronicle, should also stanch some of the price-cutting that has sliced profit margins in its Gap stores.


Tepid Justice in Los Angeles
Every time a judge hands down a sentence, it serves two purposes: to punish individual wrongdoing fairly and to broadcast a society's standards of behavior.
In sentencing two Los Angeles policemen who savagely beat Rodney King two years ago, U.S.
District Judge John Davies said he was not interested in the second issue.
He had tried to treat all the participants, he said, "not as symbols, but as individuals."
That's impossible.
When a court sentences an offender, he or she becomes a symbol of the consequences of crime.
On Wednesday, sentencing Laurence Powell and Stacey Koon to two and a half years in prison and waiving their fines, Judge Davies sent an unfortunate message: that a serious breach of the law by the people who are supposed to enforce it will be treated leniently.


Cuomo Vetoes Bill Raising Police Union's Privacy
Angering police unions across the state, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo today vetoed a bill that would have prevented conversations between police officers and their union representatives from being used in criminal investigations.
The legislation would have given such conversations the privileged legal status accorded to discussions between lawyers and their clients.
Police unions across the state had strongly endorsed the bill, saying it would have allowed union officials to perform their jobs without fear of being subpoenaed in criminal cases against police officers.


July Jobless Rate Dipped to 6.8% As Payrolls Increased by 162,000

The July gains suggest that the gradual improvement in the job market that took hold in the winter is continuing and that this recovery is indeed putting people back to work.

The Talk of Salzburg; Austrian Festival's Embattled Chief
The later years of Herbert von Karajan's regime at the Salzburg Festival, in the 1980's, were often faulted for their glorification of the maestro at the expense of nearly everything else.
If Gerard Mortier's intentions as his successor were in part to diminish the Salzburg cult of personality, he has failed.
Uppermost in nearly every conversation in Salzburg these days is Mr.
Mortier himself.
The reason is the implacability of his many enemies and the feistiness of his responses.
Austrian cultural politics in general are conceived in Manichean terms, the forces of good battling the forces of evil, "good" being one's own side, of course.
Reasonable compromise and a search for consensus seem foreign to the Austrian nature and, to judge from Mr.
Mortier, the Belgian nature as well.

It began with a truck, a van and a hearse, rolling down the Long Island Expressway, bearing prophesies of doom for the slaves of 9 to 5: "Move Out of New York State, Before It's Too Late."
Soon after, red banners with the same exhortation appeared on overpasses in Long Island and Queens: the Van Wyck, Long Island and Clearview expressways, the Northern and Southern State and Grand Central parkways.
They would go up at night, salvos in a game of dialectical guerrilla warfare, and make it through morning rush hour before being torn down by the authorities.

Frequent-Flier Pilots; Now Delta Is Putting You In Control, Well Almost
Convinced that many of its best customers also harbor dreams of flying commercial airliners, or a close facsimile, Delta Air Lines said yesterday that it was offering frequent fliers a chance to trade in some miles for a one-hour session in a flight simulator used to train pilots.
Delta has selected 6,000 of its best customers to bid for 125 slots on the flight simulator in Atlanta in an auction to be conducted by mail this fall, said Clayton R. McConnell, a Delta spokesman.


Cataract Surgery Not a Simple Procedure
To the Editor:
Jane Brody's July 21 Personal Health column on cataract surgery is refreshingly accurate in most respects, especially in describing the nature of a cataract and putting in perspective the reasons for surgery.
But the characterization of modern cataract surgery as a "simple procedure" in the accompanying graphic, "Simple Procedure to Uncloud Vision," ignores the fact that years of rigorous surgical training, and meticulous microsurgical skill are required for the 98 percent to 99 percent success rate.


Eastman Kodak Chief Is Ousted by Directors
Kay R. Whitmore, the chairman of the Eastman Kodak Company, who appeared to have survived a revolt by investors earlier this year, has been ousted by Kodak's board, apparently for not moving fast enough to improve the company's financial performance.
Kodak's outside directors, who announced Mr.
Whitmore's dismissal yesterday, said he would be replaced by an executive from outside the company.
The new leader is to be selected by a search committee headed by Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman of the Coca-Cola Company and one of the Kodak directors instrumental in Mr.
Whitmore's ouster.

Beliefs
Ten years ago, the Reform branch of American Judaism officially renounced one of the principles that had guided Jews for at least 2,000 years: that in mixed marriages the religious status of children comes down through the mother.
The child of a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish man, therefore, was automatically Jewish, while the child of a Jewish man and a non-Jewish woman was not.
The renunciation led to a firestorm of reproaches and laments among Jewish leaders.
Even today, although the Reform movement's position that Jewishness can come through either parent has been accepted by a growing number of Jews, the fears and the furor have not faded.


Judge Reinstates Coach
MARIANNE STANLEY, who sued Southern Cal and Athletic Director MIKE GARRETT, alleging sex discrimination, was ordered reinstated to her job as the school's women's basketball coach by a judge yesterday, pending another hearing.
Stanley charged in her lawsuit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, that she was promised a multiyear contract if she turned around the team's losing program.
The Trojans had a 12-16 record the season before Stanley arrived.
After she took over, the team fell to 8-19 in her first year.
But the Trojans showed significant improvement the next three years, going 18-12 in 1991, 23-8 in 1992 and 22-7 last season.

New Promises, Familiar Drift, In the Kremlin
The struggle and drift in Russian economic policy was particularly vivid today, as President Boris N. Yeltsin convened an expanded meeting of his divided Government in the Kremlin while the Parliament was busy suspending his privatization program for the second time in a month.
As a measure of the state of affairs, it was considered a victory for the market-oriented wing of the Government that the industrialist Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, did not throw his support behind a Soviet-style effort by the Economics Ministry to resurrect the essentials of centralized planning.


After Struggle, Reformer Is Chosen as Japan's Premier
After two days of embarrassing delays, political squabbles and obstructions, Japan got its first Prime Minister in 38 years not drawn from the Liberal Democratic Party, with the election late tonight of an avowed reformer, Morihiro Hosokawa.
Mr.
Hosokawa, 55, the scion of a wealthy, aristocratic family, is the second-youngest Prime Minister since World War II.
He wore his relative mantle of youth proudly tonight after the election, promising to clean up the corrupt political system and open the heavily regulated economy.


Review/Music; Mostly Mozart Illuminates The Beethoven Connection
In the last installment of its Mozart and Beethoven week, the Mostly Mozart Festival finally got down to business and presented works that showed connections between the two composers.
Of course, finding both common ground and telling contrasts between composers whose lives and styles overlapped is not brain surgery.
But perhaps Lincoln Center programmers figured that by missing the mark in all but the final program, they could create a sense of cathartic release with one that actually made sense.
The orchestral concert last Saturday evening, which was conducted ably by John Nelson, began with excerpts from the second act of Beethoven's "Creatures of Prometheus," a work best known for having yielded a theme that was later used in the "Eroica" Symphony.

Review/Jazz; A Timeless Protest, Updated
In 1960, when he recorded his "Freedom Now Suite," Max Roach presented an open-ended, flexible piece of work.
A protest piece that focused on the cruelty experienced by blacks, from the United States to South Africa, it used slight materials: moans backed by drums, a few songs and a bit of spoken text.
Mr.
Roach had discovered the perfect vehicle upon which to expand, and for the last 30 years, he has been doing just that, adding parts, texts and instrumentation.
On Sunday, at Aaron Davis Hall on the City College campus, Mr.
Roach presented "We Insist!," a suite that borrowed liberally from "Freedom Now Suite." And once again, the drummer had expanded the show, creating a multi-media performance, directed by George Ferencz, that used dancers, a chorus, Mr.
Roach's own quartet and text spoken by the actor Ossie Davis.

Linebacker Marvin Jones, the Jets' first-round draft pick, who came to terms with the team on Thursday, arrived at camp early yesterday morning in time to take a physical, sign his five-year, $6 million contract, squeeze in a brief workout and board the team bus to the airport for New York's first preseason game, in Pittsburgh on Saturday night.
Jones, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall, said he didn't weigh in this morning, but he assumes he weighs about 244 pounds.
His playing weight is listed at 240 pounds.
At least the Jets know that Jones's writing hand is in shape.
He said he spent a considerable amount of time signing the 30-odd page document.

METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY  ASBESTOS TESTS FOUND WANTING
New York City officials have determined that asbestos tests to certify the safety of every city public school are so unreliable as to be meaningless.
The officials have described the Board of Education's asbestos testing as grossly mismanaged, incompetent and possibly fraudulent.
Mayor Dinkins ordered an emergency inspection of each of the city's 1,069 schools.

Public School 188 on the Lower East Side is one of the 83 city schools that will get the highest priority in checking for asbestos.

Experts agree that asbestos is a threat only if its fibers escape into the air, where they can be inhaled.

Bacteria Rate Is Still High in New York City Tap Water
Bacteria are still appearing in the tap water around New York City at a rate far higher than normal, the Environmental Commissioner said yesterday, adding that more "boiled water alerts" are still possible.
But the likely source of the problem, an unusual water routing at the Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers, will end by today, said the Commissioner, Albert F. Appleton.
And the water that has been leaving Hillview for the last few days has measured clean in hourly tests, he said, meaning that the bacteria were probably swept into the distribution system only once, which led to the health advisories last week in two areas of Manhattan, Chelsea and the South Street Seaport area.


Review/Music; Baritone Is the Borodin Trio's Guest
Sergei Leiferkus, the "assisting guest artist" with the Borodin Trio at Monday night's Mostly Mozart concert at Fisher Hall, sang only eight songs and one encore.
But his brief appearance was enough to dissolve the audience into a small riot of enthusiasm.
Gifted with a golden dark voice and a deep theatrical intelligence, this baritone star of the Kirov Opera has the unmistakable power to enthrall.
First came three songs by Borodin: "Sleeping Princess," "Listen My Friends to My Little Song" and "To the Shores of a Faraway Place." The Borodin Trio accompanied in all three, using arrangements by its cellist, Laszlo Varga.
One hardly needed to look at the text translations; Mr.
Leiferkus made the emotions plain, from somnolent unease to gentle sorrow to cataclysmic longing.
Burnished in the lower register, luminously clear in the tenor stretch, this voice encounters no technical obstacles.


New York Asbestos Tests Are Voided
New York City officials have determined that asbestos tests to certify the safety of every city public school were so unreliable as to be meaningless.
The officials yesterday described the Board of Education's asbestos testing as grossly mismanaged, incompetent and possibly fraudulent.

The Mayor said no school would open this fall until it had been tested and any problems corrected.


As New Beating Trial Begins, Jurors Are Asked About Race
The delicate process of interviewing prospective jurors in the trial of two black men accused of beating a white truck driver began today in a newly charged atmosphere.
Just two days earlier, a Federal judge pronounced a sentence of two and a half years on two white police officers convicted in the beating of Rodney G. King, who is black.
Coupled with the judge's warm words for the defendants, the sentence, which was far more lenient than had been widely expected, came as a new shock to many black people who complain of racial bias in the justice system.


Stop the Arms Race in South Asia
India and Pakistan both have the parts and skill to assemble sizable nuclear arsenals within weeks, if they haven't done so already.
Now, with help from their friends, they are also making missiles -- which, when armed with more sophisticated nuclear warheads than they can make now, could reduce each other's cities to smoking ruins in a matter of minutes.
Washington knows just how risky that can be.
So does Moscow.
They squared off in the Cuban missile crisis, which very nearly led to Armageddon.
And Beijing has good reason to fear a nuclear arms race within range of its own cities.
Instead of spurring the race on, all three Governments have to stop it before it goes too far.


Cosmos Soccer Day Camp Mixes Summer and Sport
It is brutally hot this August morning, as 150 sweaty young soccer players, shin guards firmly in place, obediently leave the shade of the sheltering elms and trot onto a large parched field.

He clearly doesn't want to take part in the juggling, passing and dribbling that will be taught today.


Gifts That Grease Congress
Remember the large group of new faces that voters sent to Congress last fall with the hope they would change the corrupt ways of Washington?
They got off to a promising start in April, when the House's 63 Democratic newcomers presented useful if watered-down proposals for cleaning up the nation's political system.
But most have shunned the ethics agenda ever since.
When the House prepared to recess for the summer without doing anything to overhaul the rotten system of financing Congressional elections, the public heard no protest from all the newcomers who ran for office as agents of change.
Some are plainly afraid to take on House Speaker Thomas Foley, whose early stalling dissipated the momentum for real reform.
But many others are too busy hustling their own re-election contributions from lobbyists and special interest committees to care.

THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: The House; Whips Use Soft Touch To Succeed
The excruciatingly slim victory for President Clinton's budget package in the House of Representatives on Thursday was fabricated from equal parts of flattery, cajolery and promises of sweetmeats to come.
Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan was upset that no one was consulting him in drafting a crime bill, and he voted against the budget package out of pique.
House Democratic whips swarmed over him like bees to honey, and eventually he switched his vote, falling into line after being told he would be a prime player.


Norwegians Claim Their Whaling Rights
Norway has a reputation for being ecologically correct.
Its melodramatic mountains and fjords are kept pristine.
Hotels are apt to post notes requesting guests to reuse their towels to cut down on the use of detergents.
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland is so widely known as an environmentalist that she has been nicknamed "the Green Queen."
So it is an odd twist of fate that Norway is becoming a pariah among ecologists and a target for direct action campaigns by groups like Greenpeace.
It is the first country to face the serious prospect of trade sanctions by the United States for undermining a conservation effort.
Insist on Their Right
The reason is to be found in this tiny harbor village of 500 people in the Lofoten Islands, 60 miles north of the Arctic Circle.

Man Is Held In a Killing In Greenwich

3 Guilty in Asbestos Trial
A civil jury has found the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Dresser Industries and Colonial Sugar Refinery Ltd. of Australia guilty of wrongfully distributing products containing asbestos, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said today.
The companies were held liable for distributing defective asbestos-bearing products, according to the lawyer, Ronald L. Motley, who is with the firm of Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &amp; Poole.
A fourth company, Uniroyal, settled with the plaintiffs during the four-and-a-half-month trial, which ended Thursday.


Blood Donor Pool
To the Editor:
The United States blood supply for transfusion, administered by the Red Cross, is at a precariously low level.
One simple rule change could dramatically increase the supply for needy recipients: People with idiopathic hemochromatosis, a benign, noninfectious genetic iron storage disorder for which the only treatment is phlebotomy -- that is, being bled -- cannot donate blood by current, antiquated rules.
But such people have in the past been used as paid donors.

CHRONICLE
Sensing that many New Yorkers share the same disaffection toward government that propelled Ross Perot into the political arena, TERRY ANDERSON, the former hostage, is trying to form his own grass-roots, nonpartisan political movement.
The group, which Mr.

O'Rourke Cleared in Case Involving Friend's Job
A grand jury today found that the Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, did not violate any laws when he recommended the woman he lives with for a job with the company that administers the county's health insurance plan.
At the same time, Carl A. Vergari, the county District Attorney, announced that the 59-year-old Mr.
O'Rourke did not violate any conflict-of-interest laws in four other arrangements with county contractors that involved Mr.
O'Rourke's two daughters, a son-in-law and the son of the woman he lives with.
Those incidents, Mr.
Vergari said, did not even merit submission to a grand jury.


CHRONICLE
POPE JOHN PAUL II and GILBERT LEVINE, the conductor laureate of the Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra in Poland, will have a reunion next Saturday in Denver.
Mr.
Levine will conduct the National Repertory Orchestra, the Colorado Symphony Chorus and the Colorado Children's Chorale at a vigil that will be part of the Pope's visit for World Youth Day.
It will be the fourth meeting between the Pontiff and the conductor.
"I don't call myself a friend," Mr.
Levine said yesterday, "but I am privileged to say that I have the trust and confidence of the Pope through our meetings."


Banneker Academy, New Mini-School, Will Begin on Time
To the Editor:

Kashmir Strife Mounts; 12 Dead, Scores Hurt
At least 12 people were reported killed and scores wounded today in gun battles between Indian troops and militants in several towns in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir.
It was the fifth day of clashes.
The casualties occurred during big demonstrations called to protest the reported killing of civilians by soldiers, press accounts said.
Troops fired tear gas into crowds estimated at several thousand, gathered at the Hazratbal shrine area in Srinagar, the summer capital of the state, and chased the Kashmiri protesters through the streets, swinging staves, according to the reports.

Fire Kills Two Children
Two children died last night in a fire at a private residence in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, the Fire Department said.
The dead were identified at Jacqueline Besse, 15, and her 7-year old sister, Christina Cardona.
Their bodies were found inside the three-story brick house at 535 50th Street, near Fifth Avenue.
The blaze was discovered about 10:45 P.M. and brought under control about an hour later.
Jerry Sanford, a spokesman for the Fire Department, said the blaze was suspicious because of the severity of the fire when firefighters arrived.
Fire marshals are investigating, he said.

Scant Change in Region's Unemployment
In a sign that the New York region has not yet entered a period of sustained economic recovery, the unemployment rates for New York State and New Jersey remained virtually unchanged -- at 7.5 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively -- from June to July, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday.
The figures continued a three-month trend for both states of almost no variation in the number of unemployed, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the statistics bureau, indicating that the "shading in the economy is still primarily gray."

CLINTON WINS APPROVAL OF HIS BUDGET PLAN AS GORE VOTES TO BREAK SENATE DEADLOCK
With Vice President Al Gore casting the tie-breaking vote, the Senate gave final Congressional approval tonight to President Clinton's five-year economic program.
This means that the budget plan, the most important legislative issue of the Clinton Presidency so far, cleared Congress by the narrowest possible margin and awaits only the President's signature before becoming law.
Enactment of the legislation was viewed at the White House as essential to Mr.
Clinton's ultimate success as President.


11.46 Advance in Dow; Other Big Indexes Gain
The stock market moved upward late in yesterday's trading, as investors braced for the Senate's vote last night on President Clinton's budget package.
Stocks have been generally indecisive all week as Congress headed for a showdown over the President's economic plan.
Although gainers topped decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by only a slight margin, the three key market barometers were all higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 11.46 points to close at 3,560.43; the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks advanced 0.55 point, to 448.68, and the Nasdaq composite index extended its record run for the third consecutive day, rising 2.58 points, to 718.08.


THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: Reporter's Notebook; The Joy of Being Undecided: Senators Bask in the Lights
If nothing else is clear after the three-month public debate over President Clinton's budget package that ended tonight, this is: the Senate is not the House.
Not in style, not in oratory, not in political machinations.
The House is lightning, unpredictable and borne along by political squall lines that trigger sudden ruckuses and then die.
The Senate is the lightning bug, but would clearly prefer to be known by the more dignified Latin appellation: lampyridae.


Moves to Counteract Publicity Weighed by Judge in Bomb Case
The Federal judge presiding over the World Trade Center bombing case said yesterday that he has considered moving the trial to Cincinnati to escape the extensive pretrial publicity but was leaning toward keeping it in New York City.
Judge Kevin T. Duffy of Federal District Court in Manhattan also said that he had sent out "a great number of jury summonses, perhaps the largest ever sent out in this district," to pave the way for what is expected to be a long and complicated process of jury selection in the trial.
It is now scheduled to begin Sept. 14, nearly seven months after the Feb. 26 explosion.

Review/Music; Interior Sounds Go Exterior
The Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, which played a concert on period instruments as part of the Mostly Mozart Festival on Thursday night in Avery Fisher Hall, takes its name from a common but little-understood genre of composition that flourished in the Baroque period.
"Table music" is meant to be heard in the background at a banquet or dinner.
Telemann even composed a collection of pieces bearing that title.
Of course, we have tafelmusik now as well.
It can be heard in elevators, in restaurants, on easy-listening radio stations, even on classical radio stations.
The main criterion for the genre is that the music must establish as smooth an interior world as possible; there should be no emotional edges or exclamations to catch attention or distract from the pleasures of dining or conversation.
The music should charm, but never demand.
It should be solid and reliable.
It should always be there when attention wanders from the social occasion, but never deserve or require anything more.

THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: In Other Business; New York Judge Is Confirmed to Lead F.B.I., but Surgeon General Vote Stalls
Once the Senate passed the budget reconciliation bill tonight, it moved quickly to confirm Judge Louis J. Freeh as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and voted final passage of a $6.2 billion flood-relief bill without dissent.
But Republican Senators prevented action on the House-Senate compromise on President Clinton's national service legislation and on his nomination of Dr.
Joycelyn Elders to be Surgeon General.
Both will be acted on, and are all but certain to be approved, as soon as the Senate returns after Labor Day from a month's vacation that is to begin on Saturday.

Excerpts From the Senate's Debate on the President's 5-Year Economic Plan
Following are excerpts from the Senate debate on President Clinton's five-year economic plan, as recorded by The New York Times: Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey
Mr.
President, last year voters in this country voted overwhelmingly for change.
They were fed up with economic hardship and fear for the future.
This demand for basic change swept Bill Clinton into the White House and brought this package before us today.
Most of the provisions in this bill the President advocated in the campaign, and the people elected him.
With this bill we begin dealing with one of the primary national problems: the staggering deficit and the astronomical debt.
The President deserves credit for acknowledging deficit spending as a problem.

Warming Giuliani's Image
Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun his New York City mayoral campaign in earnest, broadcasting his first television commercials this week.
They are a mix of understated images and the candidate's own unscripted words, intended to counter perceptions of him as a cold-hearted former prosecutor.
In keeping with the style of the commercials' creator, David Garth, they hardly look or sound like advertisements.
They are more like tiny, self-promotional documentaries.
Here is a summary of one of the subtler ads.

Review/Film; A Rechargeable Man of Steel Aids the Inner City
Robert Townsend's film "The Meteor Man" doesn't lack nerve.
The low-budget adventure comedy, which Mr.
Townsend wrote and directed and in which he plays the title role, wants to establish an inner-city answer to Superman.
In Mr.
Townsend's variation, which is aimed specifically at inner-city children, the Clark Kent character is a mild-mannered Washington schoolteacher named Jefferson Reed, who advises his students to run from a fight.
His alter ego is somewhat feistier.
Wearing an outfit sewn by his mother -- a green cape and silver armor stenciled with the initials M M -- he disarms the Crips and the Bloods, destroys crack houses, and with a wave of his hand transforms a vacant lot into a flourishing vegetable garden.

THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: The Region; Backlash to Tax Rise Splits New Jersey Democrats
While New York and Connecticut Democrats were firmly united behind President Clinton's tax and deficit reduction plan, there were major defections among New Jersey Democrats in Congress.
What engendered opposition to the President's plan in New Jersey, several Democratic leaders said, was a lingering political backlash to the state tax increase pushed by Gov.
Jim Florio three years ago, and the residual fear that voters would punish anyone who supported another tax increase.


Serbs Hedging On Vow to Ease Siege in Bosnia
A day after pledging to relax markedly the Serbian nationalist siege of Sarajevo, the Serbian military commander appeared to hedge today, raising doubts among top United Nations officers whether the withdrawals will be made promptly, or indeed at all.
At a meeting with United Nations commanders at Sarajevo airport, the Serbian military commander, Lieut.
Gen.
Ratko Mladic, left serious questions as to whether the Bosnian Serbian nationalists would pull their forces back from two strategic mountains southwest of Sarajevo and open up two roads to the city.

Even by the bizarre standards of conduct that have recently been established in the home team's clubhouse at Shea Stadium, Bret Saberhagen's entrance late yesterday afternoon had to raise the eyebrows of his Met teammates.
As Saberhagen silently moved the length of the dressing room more than two hours before the scheduled start of a rained-out game with Pittsburgh, four objects were forcefully removed from his path.


Officials Said to Ignore Asbestos Report Errors
It was a leaky roof at a decrepit, 95-year-old public school in Chinatown that led to the discovery that years and millions of dollars had been wasted on negligent or fraudulent asbestos inspections, that scores and possibly hundreds of city schools may still be contaminated with the cancer-causing material.
But long before asbestos was found last June at Public School 1, at 8 Henry Street, touching off the investigation whose explosive results were announced at City Hall yesterday, authorities in charge of school asbestos abatement programs should have known that the problem was widespread, investigators said.

Demolishing the Holocaust Deniers
To the Editor:
I would like to thank you for Walter Reich's extensive review.
The two books discussed are important not only because they critique the malicious attempt to erase and deny a relatively recent historical experience, but also because they will aid attempts, both in the present and in the future, to publicize, recognize and come to terms with murderous behavior (whether in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq or Somalia).


What's Love Got to Do With It? Plenty
To the Editor:
I'm very glad I read Humphrey Carpenter's book "Benjamin Britten" before I read David Blum's review (July 11).
Having enjoyed reading Mr.
Blum in the past, I might have taken his assessment as my own.
I think he shares with me the disgust many in the musical community feel about the self-righteous muckraking of recent biographers of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and even Pierre Boulez.
It's irresponsible, since it explains nothing about the music they produced.
If it is sufficiently proved that Schubert, for example, liked little boys, how does the contemplation of that fact tell you anything about the C-major Quintet?

What's a Mother to Do?
KIPPER'S GAME  By Barbara Ehrenreich. 310 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.


The Thrills Endure as Tivoli Turns 150
THE strange sight of prams and wheelchairs jousting for space one recent morning suddenly brought home to me why Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen are so special.
True, Tivoli's real fame comes from being the world's oldest amusement park, this year celebrating its 150th anniversary.
And during its impressive history it was the inspiration for Hans Christian Andersen's "Nightingale" and Walt Disney's first theme park.
But its secret, I concluded, lies elsewhere.
It is, quite simply, that Tivoli appeals to all ages.
So, there they were, prams and wheelchairs, arriving punctually as the gardens in the middle of the city opened at 10 A.M.
Soon they were joined by mothers trying to control exuberant youngsters, while old men and women strode purposefully through the gardens.
By lunchtime, businessmen and tourists were filling the park's 28 restaurants.
Then, as the afternoon advanced into evening, families, young couples and groups of friends joined the crowds.
And, when the park closed at midnight, there were still some babies and grannies heading for the gates.

For Big Stucco Repairs, Patience and Knowledge
STUCCO is virtually the same material as the mortar used for bricklaying, a combination of cement, lime and sand.
Athough durable like all cement mixtures, it is not flexible.
Cracking of stucco finishes is common and can lead to major damage from water if not repaired.
Most amateurs can fill cracks and repair shallow or small areas of stucco.
Large or deep repairs may call for practiced troweling and other techniques.
But even those are not too difficult if the work is done patiently and with knowledge.
Unfortunately, matching the color and texture of a repair to existing stucco is nearly always impossible.


The Last Splash
A touch louche, otherworldly and frivolous, the Deligny swimming pool was more than a place to get wet in the summer heat.
It was the Paris beach and, for many, offered an escape from the city right at its very heart.
Secured by barges on the Seine opposite the Tuileries Gardens, Les Bains Deligny floated on the river, so to swim there was to be in water and above water, an agreeable condition that was especially seductive to the metaphysically minded Parisians.
But on July 8, after almost two centuries of delighting le tout Paris, the pool sank under mysterious circumstances.
There was a hideous sound of cracking as the wooden decks where stars and starlets had bronzed themselves broke apart.
A serious accident was avoided only because Deligny went down empty at dawn.
All that is left is an expanse of flotsam that causes tourists on the bateaux-mouches to set aside their cameras in bewilderment.


Bone-Dry Weather Taking Its Toll on the Crops
On the Pollard Brothers farm, grass the color of toast crunches under foot, and corn that normally grows as high as an elephant's eye has been stunted, less poetically and profitably, at kneecap level.

"The corn is starving for water."


The Season of Their Discontent
It was yet another three-ring performance, New York Mets style.
A player, having already done a fine job of trashing his image through childish behavior, had thrown a temper tantrum.

Your Home: Satellite Dishes; Relaxing Outdated Restraints
WHEN satellite dish antennas first came on the market some 13 years ago they were large and ugly, like giant rice bowls sprouting in a greensward.
So it was understandable that condominium and other homeowner associations tightly restricted their use.
But too often the unit owners didn't care.
According to the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association, the trade association for satellite dish reception based in Alexandria, Va., some 364,000 residential satellite systems were installed in 1992, twice as many as the 130,000 systems installed in 1982.


Ninth-Inning Shakes Foil Yanks Again
Another ninth-inning setback to the Twins, a team that is going nowhere this year.
Another night when the Yankees failed to move closer to the first-place Blue Jays.
Another night when the Yankees, and especially their relievers, would have trouble sleeping because of another damaging one-run loss.
After an impressive comeback helped the Yankees erase a 5-2 deficit, partially wipe out a poor outing by Jim Abbott and send the game into the bottom of the ninth, they did not like what transpired.
The Twins scored the decisive run on Kirby Puckett's two-out single to center field off Steve Farr and emerged with a 6-5 victory at the Metrodome.


Putting Filmgoers In the Big Picture
WHAT IS THE MOVIEgoing experience of the future?
Is it watching a film on a compact screen at a local multiplex or, as some industry mavericks believe, is it being swept into vast panoramas and headlong action on an outsize screen in a specially built theater?
The film might be a Hollywood feature produced on an unusually grand scale or, more likely, a new concept in entertainment -- a combination movie/theme-park ride.
Three companies -- Imax, Iwerks Entertainment and Showscan -- are currently engaged in what might be called the battle of the big screens, each competing to create a future in which their giant screen plays a role.


The Budget Fight Has Just Begun
When Vice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate on Friday, Congress ended a long battle over the Administration's five-year economic program.
But an even more fundamental struggle over the budget has just begun.
What Congress did last week was primarily to set taxes and spending formulas for entitlement programs, like Medicare and food stamps.
But it still must decide, after returning from summer vacation, how much to spend next year on programs that don't work by formula -- discretionary programs that include everything from the F.B.I. to the census.
At stake is whether the core of Mr.
Clinton's program survives, or whether he is forced to retreat to a program little different from George Bush's.


The Strain on the Bonds of Adoption

Puerto Rico's Identity, Up for a Vote
IN little more than three months, Puerto Ricans will be asked whether they prefer to become the 51st state, remain a commonwealth or seek independence.
The campaign leading up to the vote is barely under way, but it is clear that partisans of all three options are also grappling with an underlying question: What does it mean to be a Puerto Rican?
Ever since the United States seized this lush Caribbean island in 1898 as booty of the Spanish-American War, the relationship between the mainland and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has been marked by ambivalence on both sides.
Puerto Ricans have often seemed unsure whether to regard themselves as Americans, Latin Americans or both.

Mexico, Argentina and U.S. Represented in Cultural Medley
HAVING been founded in 1969 and 1971, respectively, El Museo del Barrio and the Bronx Museum of the Arts both rank as byproducts of the Civil Rights era, but the Bronx institution casts its net wider than its Manhattan sibling.
This cosmopolitan outlook is characteristic of temporary installations from the great Latin American roundup of 1988 to the present "Artist in the Marketplace" annual, reviewed here a few weeks ago.
And it is even more pronounced in the museum's recent acquisitions, a sampling of which is now on view under the title, "Another Perspective."


For a Summer Treat, Blueberry Breakfast
FRESH blueberries make the difference between weekend breakfasts in summer and those spread for family and friends the rest of the year.
With a bowl of blueberries on hand, even the most routine and austere breakfast fare seems more festive.
It takes no effort to scatter fresh blueberries atop a bowl of nutritious and fiber-rich bran cereal or granola or to mix them with plain yogurt.
They dress up a wedge of melon or round cuts of banana.


James W. Owles Is Dead at 46; Was Founder of Gay Rights Group
James W. Owles, the founding president of the Gay Activists Alliance and the first openly gay candidate for political office in New York City, died on Friday at St.
Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 46 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was AIDS-related toxoplasmosis, said Ethan Geto, a friend.


A la Carte; Aiming to Make Spa Dishes More Appealing
ONE of the Island's most creative chefs and a nutritionist have joined forces to make spa dishes more appealing.
In fact, tackling popular menu items in an attempt to maintain their flavor while minimizing fat, cholesterol and calories has become something of a game for the nutritionist, Layne Lieberman-Anapol, and Starr Boggs, chef and owner of the Westhampton Beach restaurant that bears his name.


Bead Therapy: Good for What Bores You
SOMETIMES it's the search for a new therapy -- something calming and creative -- that draws people to the Bead Store on the Upper East Side or the one in SoHo.
Other times, it's simply a question of "How do we fill up an afternoon?"
That's how Brenda Dweck, a mother of three from Great Neck, L.I., put it one recent Saturday as Benjamin, 9, David, 7, and Meryl, 4, surveyed the compartmentalized tables in the Lexington Avenue shop.
Each store has about 1,500 varieties of beads, from glass beads no bigger than poppy seeds ($2.50 for a vial containing about a yard's worth) to sterling silver Balinese beads two inches in diameter ($50 each).
The stores also carry thread, wire, clasps and other findings to make almost any item of personal ornamentation, including earrings, chokers and watchbands.


Alaskan Tours Of Native Life
One of the newest trends in touring Alaska is "cultural vacationing." Travelers visit remote native villages to learn firsthand the art of native cooking, dancing and survival techniques of people who settled the tundra near the Arctic and Bering seas centuries ago.
Alaska Airlines Vacations, (800) 468-2248, offers trips to native villages, including a one-day excursion from Anchorage to the Eskimo village of Kotzebue, about 30 miles north of the Arctic Circle.
At the village, travelers visit a cultural camp where village elders teach youths traditional crafts and survival skills.
The cost of the tour, including air fare between Anchorange and Kotzebue, is $315.


Indian Ocean Coral Reefs Are Ravaged by Mining
As the waves ease and the warm ocean beckons, young men get on their rafts and paddle out to the coral reefs that form a blueish ring around Sri Lanka.
But their idea is not to admire one of nature's wonders.
The lean young men are off to mine the reefs.
Carrying crowbars and hammers, the divers break up rocks and branches and smash coral formations that have taken thousands of years to grow.
Like pearl divers, they hold their breath at length and work until their rafts are full.
Once ashore, the coral is carried to kilns where it is pulverized and meets its destiny as cement.


Wealthy or Not, Taxpayers Will Find Plenty of Surprises
The Democrats have said, correctly, that the new law raises taxes mainly on the wealthy.
But many people who are not wealthy will be affected by the tax increases, some in ways that have been widely heralded, but others in ways that may come as a surprise.
Gasoline taxes are going up; so are taxes on many people's Social Security benefits.
Anyone who moves for a new job might lose certain deductions of expenses, whether he is Croesus or Cratchit.


In Paradise Built by Now-Bankrupt Developer, Anxiety Reigns
Before they had toured the models, before they had even read the brochures, they had heard of John Mc Namara.
The name was a source of reassurance as they struggled with whether to buy -- in some cases, to invest their life savings -- in the Highlands, a condominium complex nestled in the hills above Long Island Sound.
"Two years ago, you mentioned the name McNamara, it was like mentioning God," said Jerry Reda, president of the homeowners' association at the development.
"Everyone here bought here because of his name and reputation."


A Retouching Pen To Remove Red-Eye
RED-EYE is one of color photography's persistent problems.
Its cause is well known, but the solution is evasive.
The flash from the camera strikes the back of the eye, which is full of tiny red blood vessels and reflects directly into the camera as a picture is taken.
The finished prints look as if the subjects have turned into ghouls -- red beamspouring out of their eyes like lasers.
When point-and-shoot cameras appeared in the early 1980's, engineers turned to various solutions -- moving the flash further from the lens, or pre-flashing the subject so the pupils closed down, thus cutting back on reflection problems.
In spite of this effort, the problem only subsided, but was not eliminated.


If Wishes Were Air Kisses
Blowing kisses is an underrated art form.
It takes a master to do it properly, which is totally straight.
You can't mock the kiss, you can't mock the recipient, you certainly can't mock yourself.
You must put your heart and soul into it, be overcome with the sheer delight of happening upon the object of your affection, just out of reach.
This is how it is when Tomasz Starzewski (pronounced toe-MAHS star-ZHEF-skee) sweeps into lunch at Bice, a newly opened branch of the Italian restaurant.
Sweeping is yet another art form, but it's not Mr.
Starzewski's.
He sweeps small, in the background, allowing the woman he accompanies the big sweep, a method that works best in clothes he has designed.
If she is not wearing his clothes and is not much of a sweeper herself, well, that's paradise lost for you.


For Big Stucco Repairs, Patience and Knowledge
STUCCO is virtually the same material as the mortar used for bricklaying, a combination of cement, lime and sand.
Athough durable like all cement mixtures, it is not flexible.
Cracking of stucco finishes is common and can lead to major damage from water if not repaired.
Most amateurs can fill cracks and repair shallow or small areas of stucco.
Large or deep repairs may call for practiced troweling and other techniques.
But even those are not too difficult if the work is done patiently and with knowledge.
Unfortunately, matching the color and texture of a repair to existing stucco is nearly always impossible.


A Taste of Victory For 2 Big Winners
FOR two winners of the Spingold Knockout Team Championship in Washington a week ago it was a first taste of victory in that event.
The captain, Richard Freeman of Atlanta, once lost the final by a heartbreaking 2 imps, but this time there was no error: his team won by 60.
He has played infrequently in the past two decades, but had considerable playing credentials as a young man.
He became a life master at age 18 in 1952, the youngest ever at that time.
As a child he was famous on radio as a "Quiz Kid."


Really Roseanne
I loved Lucy, but she was always getting into trouble.
I loved Miss McNamera and My Little Margie, but who wants to go through life in a cocktail dress?
Forget Loretta Young.
She couldn't enter a room without twirling around the doorknob.
And I didn't like the apron set either: Mama, Harriet, Margaret and Donna.
For a short time though, I did want to be Beulah.
At least, like my mother, she had a man and a job.
Only now, just when I thought I was too old for one, does a real role model come along: She works.
She's funny.
She gets mad at her husband and isn't sappy about her kids.
She's stressed out and hates to clean.
I love Roseanne.
Every Tuesday night, Roseanne cuts through baloney using humor like a machete.
When she whacks a frozen wad of burger so it will defrost faster, it won't break.
When she bounces it off the counter, that doesn't work either.
When she tries to crack it over the edge, television finally catches up with reality.
What happens to Roseanne happens to me.


Dancing Fairies, Cavorting Pigs: Illustrations for Children's Books
FOR a show like "This Wondrous World: Children's Book Illustration in New England," there could scarcely be a more appropriate setting than the Lyman Allyn Museum.
Not only is this more or less neo-classical building on a hill, in New London, the repository for the Baratz Collection of 19th-century dolls and furniture to scale, but it is also rich in dolls' houses and miniature room displays.
It has, in addition, an education department with volunteers who are apparently ready for any situation.
Sad to say, the Mrs.
Tiggy Winkle Tea, with Donna Dufresne playing the lead in a hedgehog outfit, is long gone but there remains Carnival of the Animals, a concert with Ogden Nash poetry, scheduled for the evening of Aug. 18.
The guest curator of the illustration exhibition is Charles Price, a professor emeritus at Connecticut College.
This, too, is appropriate, for while the museum is directed by Penny Knowles, the college takes care of its administration.
Better yet, Professor Price is an authority on and collector of children's books.
In a recent interview taped by Pamela Bond for the still-new Griffis Art Center, also in New London, he observed that they "give insights into our lives that we don't get in other ways," noting, however, that "there are more great illustrations than texts."

CASTLES IN THE SAND
As the author of an upcoming book on Fire Island, I congratulate Elizabeth Hawes on her intuitions about our little spit of sand ("Castles in the Sand," July 11).
The history of the place can indeed be "recounted in storms," sociologically as well as topographically.


Union Leaders Fight for a Place in the President's Workplace of the Future
As the Clinton Administration seeks to define the high-performance workplace of the future, union leaders are fighting for a place in that definition.
More specifically, they say any Clinton campaign to upgrade the workplace will not succeed without unions.
But the Administration, backed strongly by unions in last fall's election, is not ready to go that far.
"The jury is still out on whether the traditional union is necessary for the new workplace," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview.


Fight Sleepism. Nap Now
American society is not, in general, nap-friendly.
It is actually sleepist in the extreme.
"There's such a prohibition against admitting that we need sleep!" says David F. Dinges, a nap specialist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Nobody wants to get caught napping, to be found asleep at the switch.
Even children know that it's bad to be a sleepyhead.
To quote an obscure Minnesota proverb worthy of Lake Wobegon, "Some sleep five hours, nature requires seven, laziness nine and wickedness eleven."
Wrong.
The way not to fall asleep at the switch is to take naps when you need them.
Listen to William Dement of Stanford University, the godfather of sleep research: "We need to totally change our attitude toward napping." Taking a nap, he says, should be viewed as a "heroic" act.
"If we see someone taking a nap, we should stand in awe." Our latest hero, leading us all in sleep policy, is none other than President Clinton.
According to recent reports, he has begun taking a half-hour nap in the afternoon.


Sports of The Times; Varying Perceptions Of Byrd's Recovery
JUST about the time Dennis Byrd walked proudly back into the Jets' training camp last Wednesday morning, a man named Al Fogle wheeled himself to the front of a lectern, accepted a microphone from his best friend, Hank Carter, and said a few gracious words in behalf of some who will never be as fortunate as Byrd.
He was wearing a Knicks T-shirt and a National Basketball Association cap.
He held the microphone in his right hand and thanked the handful of N.B.A. players who had come to a midtown hotel to announce the Knicks-hosted charity game at Madison Square Garden on Sept. 1. that will benefit the wheelchair wing of Goldwater Hospital on Roosevelt Island.


Business Diary/July 25-30
THE ECONOMY Climax for the Federal Budget Debate


Federal Investigator Is Accused of Sex Harassment
The man in charge of investigating misconduct in science for the Federal Government has been accused of misconduct of another sort: sexually harassing an office manager by seeking sexual favors from her in return for good employee ratings.
The office manager, a 27-year-old woman, has filed a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Service's equal employment opportunity office against Dr.
Clyde A. Watkins, 46, acting director of the Division of Research Investigation in the Federal Office of Research Integrity.
She accuses him of pressing her for sexual favors for a year, and at one time promising to give her a top employee rating if she would perform oral sex on him twice.


Monitoring Of Schools Is Resuming
After a pause of two years, a period when state aid for poorer school districts was increased, New Jersey will soon reactivate its system for monitoring how well schools educate their pupils.
Gov.
Jim Florio suspended the monitoring program in January 1991 and called for a new system with "tough, relevant" standards that led to legislation in 1991 and adoption of new standards by the State Department of Education last November.

Exhibit Views AIDS Frankly For the Young
While parents and educators around the country continue debating when, where and how youngsters should learn about safe sex and AIDS, a combined effort of eight science museums has brought the subject into graphic public view with a provocative exhibit at the Franklin Institute Science Museum here.
Developed in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the exhibit, "What About AIDS?" is designed to educate people under the age of 20, for whom important questions about sex and AIDS might be unclear or uncomfortable.
And despite an interactive presentation with puzzles, books and computer programs that younger people might find inviting and fun, the overall message that AIDS can happen to anyone is stark, urgent and often poignant.

Will Markets Slide as Rich Are Soaked?
THE rich, as Fitzgerald said, are different.
These days, they are also a distinctly unpopular group in Washington.
The Clinton Administration and the Democratic Congress appear to be serious about taking money from them in the tax bill.
The issue of justice aside, that could have interesting economic effects.
For while the rich -- surprise -- spend more than the poor, it is in saving that they really are the dominant group.
And it is savings that become investments and propel stock and bond prices ever higher.

U.S. ALLOWS A VETO FOR BOUTROS-GHALI
United States officials seeking support for proposed NATO air strikes against Serbian forces encircling Sarajevo said today that they were prepared to agree with the United Nations Secretary General that the first such attack would require his approval.
The Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, wrote to Secretary of State Warren Christopher this week insisting that he be consulted on any expanded NATO military role in Bosnia.

Finks Stable but Serious
JIM FINKS, former president and general manager of the New Orleans Saints, was in stable but serious condition yesterday after undergoing emergency surgery.
Doctors at Southern Baptist Hospital removed a blood clot on Finks's brain late Friday.
Finks, 65, arrived at the hospital by ambulance early Friday and was admitted to the intensive care unit.
Finks was diagnosed with lung cancer in April.
He resigned on July 14 to focus on radiation and chemotherapy treatments. (AP)


Smithsonian Postal Museum
The National Postal Museum, the Smithsonian Institution's newest addition, opened July 30 in Washington.
It is the first major United States museum devoted to postal history and philately, and is housed in the building that served as Washington's main post office from 1914 to 1986.
The Beaux Arts-style structure, designed 80 years ago by Daniel H. Burnham, is situated on Capitol Hill across the street from Union Station, another Burnham creation.
Exhibits include an 1851 Concord-style mail delivery stagecoach, and a copy of a 19th-century mud wagon in which visitors can sit and discover how uncomfortable it was for the 14 passengers who hitched a ride along with the mail.


Whose Vacation?
To the Editor: Yo!
Kids!
It's your parents' vacation, that's whose vacation it is.
They're the ones who worked for it and are paying for it.
And what they need is a vacation from you kids.
My suggestion to parents: Hire a really good sitter with instructions to take the kids to any nearby carnival or amusement park for the bumper cars, etc., the local McDonald's for meals, the local dairy bar for frozen yogurt, and use a museum catalogue for gifts.


Block Raids, Yeltsin Tells Central Asians
At an unusual meeting today, President Boris N. Yeltsin appealed to Central Asian leaders to help defend the old Soviet border with Afghanistan against incursions stemming from the civil war in Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic.
Russian soldiers have been dying again in battles with Afghans on the mountainous border of Tajikistan, which has brought back some old nightmares here.


'The Secret Garden' and How It Grew
HE GAVE SHAPE TO 80 YEARS of Indian history in "Gandhi" and fashioned the elegant decor in "Dangerous Liaisons." For each he won an Academy Award.
But in his new film, opening on Friday, the production designer Stuart Craig faced a particularly difficult task -- finding ways to make "The Secret Garden" fresh.
The source material, of course, is Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved story of an orphan whose discovery of a hidden and neglected garden fills her deathly world with life.
Published in 1911, the book has spawned adaptations as varied as a Margaret O'Brien film in 1949, a BBC children's special in 1975 and a 1991 Broadway musical.
The current version, from Francis Ford Coppola's film company American Zoetrope, was directed by the Polish film maker Agnieszka Holland ("Europa, Europa") with a cast including Maggie Smith as the housekeeper and a group of young unknowns.
Mr.
Craig, accordingly, knew that the secret garden itself -- indeed, the entire look of the movie -- must function as its star; this was a film as much about plants as people, about physical location as a gauge of spiritual growth.

Interface: People and Technology; Testing the Telecommute
FROM his basement laundry room in scenic Summit, N.J., David LaPier may be helping redefine the technology of telecommuting.
On a recent afternoon, as sunshine and the happy yelps of his three young children streamed through the cellar window, Mr.
LaPier was having a good-natured argument with a co-worker 50 miles away.
The two were revising the preamble to a technical report, and LaPier the engineer was now LaPier the grammarian.


A Nice Place to Visit, And to Live Someday
Tractors amble along the narrow highway that cuts through this upstate village, and it's not unusual to see rows of corn growing in backyards.
When people pass one another on the street, they never fail to say hello.
These are the things Rashad Herdigen loves about Candor, where he has spent the last 10 summers through the Fresh Air Fund.
They are also the reasons Rashad, a 16-year-old from Brooklyn, wants to move here after he finishes high school.


Emily Fraenkel, Andrew Faulkner
Emily Alexandra Fraenkel was married yesterday to Andrew Montgomery Faulkner at Union Theological Seminary in New York.
Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in New York performed the ceremony. .
Mrs.

Gottfried S. Fraenkel, was a professor of entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
He was a pioneer in the study of insect physiology and endocrinology and was credited with discovering the hormone that causes insect metamorphosis.


Art School? Not Exactly
The Time Is Always Now, an art gallery at 476 Broome Street (Wooster Street) in SoHo, is inviting people to come in and make their own art this summer.
The current show -- if that is what it should be called -- is titled "Art 101" and runs through September.
In the main room of the gallery are grade-school-size chairs and a large table filled with art supplies.
Anyone can walk in to draw or paint.
There's also a blackboard and a room called the Faculty Lounge (where cookies, juice and fairly undrinkable coffee are available).


Copenhagen
A Copenhagen travel poster put out by the city's tourist association in the 1950's showed a policeman stopping traffic to allow a duck and her ducklings to cross the street.
Just a few years ago a mail clerk used it to wrap some new posters that were being submitted to an international poster art competition.
The judges, unwittingly, awarded first prize to the duck and ducklings.
This pleased Copenhageners no end, for it corresponds neatly to their image of themselves as people with heart and a sense of humor that helps defuse life's more difficult moments.
That image was dented by the country's divisions over the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which will strengthen Denmark's ties with the European Community.
The night after the referendum, hard-pressed policemen fired into a crowd of rioters.
No one was seriously hurt, but the incident profoundly shocked the Danes, who believed it couldn't happen there.

Does No One See a Running She?
To the Editor:
The sweat was still pouring down the back of my neck after my morning run when I picked up the paper and read "Chief Executives Who Are Quick on Their Feet" (July 25).
Good thing for the sweat, because it kept the hair from rising.
The only woman mentioned in a discussion of numerous chief executive officers was some guy's date.


Southeast Asia Luxury Train
This fall a new luxury train is scheduled to begin running between Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok.
Covering 1,200 miles in 41 hours, the Eastern &amp; Oriental Express will offer a two-night trip with all meals, sleeping accommodations and private showers and toilets at fares starting at $1,130 a person in double occupancy.
The train will stop at Penang, Malaysia, and at Surat Thani and Hua Hin, both in Thailand.
Passengers may get off for a stay in any of those cities and then continue their trip on a later train.
Add-on excursions will also be available.
Fares for those overnight trips start at around $390 a person -- final prices have not yet been set -- and include sleeping accommodations and meals.


Rabies Is Confirmed as Cause of Girl's Death
An 11-year-old Sullivan County girl who fell ill on an upstate camping trip last month and died of a viral brain infection two days later was the first rabies fatality in New York State in nearly 40 years, state health officials said yesterday, confirming fears that had been expressed days before.
The girl, Kelly Ahrendt of Bloomingburg, N.Y., died at the Westchester County Medical Center on July 11 in the midst of a record epidemic of rabies among wild animals, particularly raccoons, in New York State and other parts of the Northeast.
But much about the case remained a mystery.

The bride's previous marriage ended in divorce.


An Apology From Japan, Finally, to War's Sex Slaves
A half-century after the end of World War II, Japan last week abandoned years of denial and finally admitted that during the war the Imperial Army had virtually kidnapped and imprisoned thousands of women from one end of Asia to the other, forcing them to have sex with Japanese soldiers in a network of brothels.
The Government said it decided to issue its apology after interviewing some of the women and discovering new documents in its archives.
But the imminent transfer of power to a new reformist Government may have had a lot to do with it.


The Executive Life; The Surlier Side Conquers Hollywood
VALERIE CAVANAUGH wasn't going to take it anymore.
For an entire year, Ms.
Cavanaugh, executive vice president of Gracie Films, the production company of the Oscar- and Emmy-winning writer-producer-director James L. Brooks, had not received even one perfunctory greeting from the talent agent Gavin Polone as they dickered over the services of a writer.
"I would pick up the phone and he would say, 'Where's the check?,' " Ms.
Cavanaugh recalls.
Finally, Ms.
Cavanaugh, who knows Mr.
Polone's mother, lectured the young agent: "Gavin, if you want to talk to me, you're going to have to feign interest in me and ask me two personal questions before we get to the business." Now, when Mr.
Polone phones, he inquires about Ms.
Cavanaugh's day and her well-being.
After replying, Ms.
Cavanaugh says, "I feign interest in him by asking two personal questions. He answers and we proceed to business."


Coming Oil Shortage Will Worsen Food Crisis; New Crops Needed
To the Editor:
An all-out effort is needed to slow population growth, as Lester R. Brown states in "Natural Limits" (Op-Ed, July 24), but such an effort will not significantly reduce the population explosion of the next 10 to 20 years.
In addition, some 700 million people today do not have access to enough food.


A Slow Boil In the Melting Pot
On wooden benches at Seth Low Park in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Russian emigres gather daily to play chess and dominoes and to discuss the latest political developments in their homeland.
Not long ago, Italian-Americans would have been sitting on those benches playing cards.
But in the last few years, the Russian emigres, most of whom are Jewish, have slowly replaced the Italian-Americans, who have moved their card games inside the park's clubhouse.
"It's too bad that they don't come anymore," 66-year-old Mikhail Kopyt said through an interpreter.
"There was never any problem with them. I don't know why they stopped coming."


A Bright Balloon of a Building Soars at U.C.L.A.
FOR MOST OF THIS CENTURY, architecture paralleled the increasing informality of modern life: fewer rooms, more flexible layouts, no elaborate moldings for nonexistent maids to dust.
Then architecture reversed direction.
Since the 1970's, many architects have contrived to put the starch back into buildings.
The classical elegies of Michael Graves, the stiff-white-collar modernism of Richard Meier, the overwrought geometries of Peter Eisenman: though these esthetics have assumed vastly different forms, they share an evident antipathy toward the unstructured spaces promoted by modern architecture.
Each yearns for a time when it was the architect's job to reinforce social  formalities.
The Temporary Powell Library, a bright balloon of a building that alighted a year ago on the Westwood campus of U.C.L.A., is blithely oblivious to formal dress codes.
Designed by the Santa Monica firm Hodgetts &amp; Fung, this ephemeral structure shares common ground with student life.
Immensely popular with the university's undergraduates, the Temporary Powell has also become a mecca for visiting architects.
Earlier this year, it was honored with an award for design excellence from the American Institute of Architects.
With its playful air of spontaneity bolted down by innate rigor, the Temporary Powell revives informality as an architectural ideal.
And it raises the question of why that ideal fell from favor.


'A Quiet Corner Chicken, Sir?'
The demand for good food in the Hamptons has reached an abnormal level.
Nowhere is the problem more evident than at 95 School Street, a new restaurant in Bridgehampton that has been taking reservations for the chickens it serves.

FOCUS: Vancouver, B.C.; Waterfront Projects Meeting Resistance
WITH British Columbia's economy and real estate market improving, two local developers have been trying to redevelop the waterfront in two affluent communities across the harbor from downtown Vancouver and have run into opposition on several levels.
Land in the two communities -- North Vancouver and West Vancouver -- is scarce and expensive.
The developers, the Larco Group of Companies and the Viam Group, are concentrating on an eight-mile stretch of Marine Drive, proposing new projects and speeding work on those already under way.

THE term integrated pest management, or I.P.M. as it is often known, is so much a part of horticultural language, it can practically be equated with mulching or weeding.
The appeal of the alternative means of keeping pests under control coincides with the current awareness to do the right thing as far as tending the land is concerned.
The practice of integrated pest management can be carried out whether someone tends a half-acre plot or manages the land of a huge wholesale nursery.
As a case in point, American Nurseryman recently surveyed wholesale growers.
Those who managed as many as 200 acres advocated following some I.P.M. practices in keeping pest populations under control.
In fact, 70 percent of the wholesalers who responded to the survey said that they did not apply pesticides on a fixed schedule, while only 30 percent said they did.
In other words, the trend is toward targeting controls of troublesome insects rather than spraying on schedule just because certain insects are expected to appear at certain times.

Do Threads of Five Lives Lead to One Serial Killer?; Investigators Sift Details and Look for Links in Murders of Gay and Bisexual Men
They spanned the broad experience of gay life, a life led with a current of tension and secrecy under even the most tolerant of circumstances.
Michael J. Sakara, bearded and burly, lived openly for nine years with a lover and ended each night he spent at a downtown bar with a vamp of "I'll Be Seeing You."


Rangers Embarrassed
Texas Rangers officials are fielding calls from angry fans who weren't amused by a strip show performed in a private suite at their game against the Chicago White Sox Thursday night.
In the top of the fourth inning, many fans and players watched the unusual sideshow as a woman, dressed in a pink, polka-dot bikini, removed the garment while standing in the window of a luxury box.
"Needless to say, we're embarrassed about it," said JAY MILLER, the suite sales director said.
"I know who owns the suite, and I called him up." The woman was ejected from the ball park.  (AP)


American Winner Takes Hambletonian
After losing the reins a week ago, American Winner reclaimed his throne as the top trotter in North American harness racing here this afternoon with a triumph in the 68th edition of the Hambletonian.
With his victory in the most prestigious event in harness racing, American Winner is a race away from becoming the first trotter since Super Bowl in 1972 to capture trotting's triple crown.

The bride-to-be is also the daughter of the late Elia Maria de Oliveria Hodgson.


For a Summer Treat, Blueberry Breakfast
FRESH blueberries make the difference between weekend breakfasts in summer and those spread for family and friends the rest of the year.
With a bowl of blueberries on hand, even the most routine and austere breakfast fare seems more festive.
It takes no effort to scatter fresh blueberries atop a bowl of nutritious and fiber-rich bran cereal or granola or to mix them with plain yogurt.
They dress up a wedge of melon or round cuts of banana.


Bowls Showcase the Wood-Turner's Art
AN exhibition of contemporary turned-wood bowls at the Neuberger Museum is among a medley of events nationwide celebrating 1993 as the Year of American Craft. (Begun as a grass-roots movement among representatives of crafts groups, the year was officially named by Congressional decree last fall.)
The 60 pieces on exhibit, ranging from a massive, scooped-out hemisphere to a small, paper-thin goblet, were culled from the Edward Jacobson collection at the Arizona State University Art Museum in Tempe.
Representing 15 master woodworkers, the show will remain on view through Oct. 29.


Listening Hard for the Politics in Music
To the Editor:
In trying to show that music carries a political meaning (letter, July 29), Prof.
Michael Broyles stretches ideas and facts.
When he tells us that the Baroque overture reflects the pomp of a royal court, he points to the music's occasion, not its character.
A Sousa march is pomp and circumstance too: does its playing on the Fourth of July make it democratic?
Politics is an ambiguous term anyway.
The article that prompted the Broyles letter used the term to mean partisanship, advocacy.
An established regime is not political in that sense; it is only the way society is organized.
A piece of music may suit festivities -- as a church service does -- without advocating anything, just serving the human urge to celebrate.


Corrections
The crossword puzzle in The Times Magazine last Sunday included an incorrect definition for 85 Down.
It should have read, "Playhouses, in Madrid," not "Yellowish-pink color." (The answer was "teatros.")

WHAT: The wildly overhyped plastic doodad that creates fancy twists with long hair.
HOW: Make a ponytail and then stick the handle of the doodad (which looks like a miniature butterfly net without the net) through your hair behind the elastic band; thread your ponytail through the doodad's loop and pull down on the handle.


Focus: Vancouver, B.C.; Waterfront Projects Meeting Resistance
WITH British Columbia's economy and real estate market improving, two local developers have been trying to redevelop the waterfront in two affluent communities across the harbor from downtown Vancouver and have run into opposition on several levels.
Land in the two communities -- North Vancouver and West Vancouver -- is scarce and expensive.
The developers, the Larco Group of Companies and the Viam Group, are concentrating on an eight-mile stretch of Marine Drive, proposing new projects and speeding work on those already under way.


Even Long Johns Deserve Respect
To the Editor:
In your article "Secrets Revealed" (July 25), you write in saucily ironic tones about "the long johns that Mormons wear underneath their clothes to protect them from evil."


Orchestrating a Musical Partnership
CAN art and commerce help each other?
Two unlikely but successful collaborators answer yes.
The partners, the New Orchestra of Westchester and Doral Arrowwood, the resort and conference center here, have taken part in many joint marketing programs since both were formed 10 years ago.
Both have benefited financially as a result.
Paul Lustig Dunkel, music director and conductor of the New Orchestra of Westchester, said the unusual alliance began almost by chance.


Marylou's Merry-Go-Round
Let us now praise famous socialites.
The ones to the manor born and the ones who marry in.
The ones who discover, after they marry, a flair for designing ball gowns, and the ones who fly to Paris for the collections.
The ones who get into trouble and end up in jail and the ones who get divorced and end up on the Home Shopping Network.
Let us now praise Marylou Whitney, the 68-year-old former actress who isn't afraid to put on straw hats as big as umbrellas and be gay in the old sense of the word.


Prague Is Embroiled in Accusations of Espionage
An indictment of a former intelligence agent on charges of selling economic secrets to a well-known Czech businessman has shaken the country with tales of blackmail and raised questions about the accountability of the intelligence service.
The scandal broke into the open on July 28, when Vaclav Wallis, an agent of the former Czechoslovak intelligence service, F.B.I.S., was indicted on charges of selling classified Government information.
He had been dismissed in December.

Tomorrow Isn't Just Another Day
THE STORY SO FAR: "ANNIE" IS ONE OF THE MOST successful musicals in Broadway history.
It opens in 1977 and earns a profit of between $20 million and $30 million before closing in 1983.
The first attempt at a sequel, "Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge," costs $7 million and closes in 1990 after a tryout in Washington and negative reviews.
Abandoned by its producers, "Annie 2" evolves into "Annie Warbucks." The show is produced by Karen Walter Goodwin, who tours it around the country in 1992.
With a budget of $5.5 million, it is scheduled to open on Broadway in April of this year.
But then something happens . . . .
Feb. 19, 1993: The Dream Dies  Karen Walter Goodwin announces that "Annie Warbucks" will not make it to Broadway in 1993 for lack of money.
March 9: Hold It!
The Dream Lives  Ben Sprecher, the co-owner of the 499-seat Variety Arts Theater Off Broadway, calls Martin Charnin, the director of "Annie Warbucks," and offers to produce the musical at his theater.
Mr.
Sprecher had made an offer once before, but Mr.
Charnin, his heart set on Broadway, was unreceptive.
This time, he reacts differently.
Mr.
Sprecher: "He looked at me. I looked at him. His head went back, and his forehead read 'Tilt!' "
March 11: They Think They're Gonna Like It Here  The "Annie Warbucks" creative team -- Mr.
Charnin, the show's lyricist, the composer Charles Strouse and the book writer Thomas Meehan -- inspect the Variety Arts, a theater on Third Avenue near 14th Street that Mr.
Sprecher and William P. Miller bought in 1990 and renovated.
It opened in the fall of 1991 with "Return to the Forbidden Planet," a science-fiction musical that closed in April 1992.
In November the play "Program for Murder" lasted less than a month, and the Variety Arts has been dark ever since.
But the former porn theater apparently looks right for the redhead.
The team agrees on the spot that the show will go on.
May 6: Honey, They Shrunk the Kids  A news conference is called to announce that "Annie Warbucks" is alive.
In a parody of the Lorenz Hart song "Where or When," Mr.
Charnin croons to the assembled journalists, "It seems we stood and talked like this before . . . The smirk you are smirking you were smirking then." A downsized version of "Annie Warbucks" will go into rehearsal at the Variety Arts, produced by Mr.
Sprecher, Mr.
Miller and Dennis J. Grimaldi.
The $5.5 million musical will come in at $1 million, with all actors except Harve Presnell (reprising his role of Daddy Warbucks) working for Off Broadway scale.
Just how small is it?
Mr.
Sprecher: "It's as if you took the Broadway show, threw it in the washing machine in hot water, and it came out about three-quarters the original size."  May 10: Attack of the Little People  Many small girls converge on the theater in response to an open call for the orphans.
May 26: Dog Day Afternoon  Cindy Lou, a mixed-breed terrier who plays Sandy, gets a second understudy.
If Cosmo can't go on, Buby (pronounced Bubba) will.
June 10: Mini Annie  First rehearsal.
The cast has shed, along with the second chorus, Lauren Gaffney, the stalwart Annie of "Annie Warbucks." Now 13, she is too old and too large.
Her replacement is the very small, very young, very loud Kathryn Zaremba, a 9-year-old from Broken Arrow, Okla.
"One of her most endearing qualities, from my point of view, is she isn't even 4 feet tall yet," says Mr.
Charnin.
July 8: A New Deal for Daddy?
First preview of the show, in which the evil child welfare commissioner, Harriet Doyle (replacing the evil Miss Hannigan), tells Warbucks he has 60 days to find a wife or Annie goes back to the orphanage.
Donna McKechnie has signed on as Mrs.
Kelly, a possible love interest for Daddy.
Aug. 9: Tomorrow, Tomorrow  "Annie Warbucks" is scheduled to open exactly 17 years after the original "Annie" opened at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn.
Mr.
Charnin: "The main thing is, it's going to happen, and I don't have to sit on a stool with hand puppets, which was the plan of last resort."


Helping the Ill and Aged Control Their Destinies
CHARLES AGUADO is a favorite with the women at the Marrs Nursing Home here, where he volunteers as an ombudsman, but the men get his special attention.
Older men tend to be withdrawn, he says, while women continue to form sociable relationships.
So on a recent visit to the home, when he saw an old man alone in a wheelchair, Mr.
Aguado addressed him warmly.
"What's doing, Harry?" he asked with a smile, and before long the two were laughing together.


Lexus Weighs In With a 'Gran' Sedan
IT occurs to me that it has been a good long while since I have heard Detroit automakers whine about "perceived quality."
What that phrase meant to the executives who were wringing their hands through much of the last decade was a misguided public's notion that Japanese cars were simply better, no matter the actual quality of domestic cars.


Photographers Have Other Organizations
I am appalled by the article on July 4 about the 65 photographers in Westchester and Fairfield Counties who have formed their own self-protection association because of the claims of the founders that "Commercial photographers don't normally communicate with each other"  [ "Photographers Find Strength in Unity ] .
I am amazed, not by the facts stated about how they are often "stiffed" by their clients (I am sure this may be true in some cases) but by the naivete of the members of this group.
I am even more disturbed by the acceptance at face value of their plea of isolation from their contemporaries and their dire need for an organization to protect their interests.
If they do not wish to participate in extant groups, that's one thing.
To deny their very existence is something else, but where is the journalistic research that an article such as this demands?


Inner Landscape
To the Editor: I, too, have experienced reaffirmations of my faith and connections to other Jews in far-off lands, as did Elizabeth Benedict ("Exploring an Inner Landscape," May 30).
On one such visit, a number of years ago, I was so moved that I decided not to be simply a "cultural Jew" who occasionally seeks out her roots.
Rather, I vowed to rekindle the faith of my ancestors in my own life and the lives of the members of my family.


Just a Moment on Those Layoff 'Experts'
To the Editor:
Regarding "Learning the Lessons of a Layoff" and "Job Hunting Beyond the Want Ads" (Your Own Account, July 11 and 18): Just where did you dig up the "experts" on the unemployed?
They seemed to agree on just one thing -- if people are laid off, it's got to be their own damn fault.
My guess is that they all make a good living soothing the feelings of the managers booting people out on the street.
As one who was laid off late last year, I suggest that the management expert you might consider for your next article on this subject is W. Edwards Deming, who says 85 percent of the problems a company has are caused by its management.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
SHORT PIECES  TO FEEL THESE THINGS  Essays.
By Leonard Michaels.
Mercury House, paper, $12.


Hurricane of the Mind
Summer storms in South Dade County sweep the flat, green horizon nearly every afternoon.
Even on clear days, claps of thunder sometimes trouble the still air, causing newcomers to look skyward with a start as they reach, instinctively, to close their windows.
Cloudbursts, when they do come, hardly cool the already steaming land or break the torpor.
Instead, they leave their mark in gray puddles or shimmering mists that rise from scorched fields made of coral rock crushed to dust and pebbles by years of the hoe and the plow blade and the ravages of wind and rain.
When the wide open fields of the Redlands are fresh-plowed, the coral rock lies in chunks out in the open.
A farmer digging his toe into the earth shifts chalklike pebbles to and fro.
Pure white under a pure white sun, they burn the eyes.
Summer days, when the mercury rises above 90, and sea salt and humidity mix to leave a film upon bare skin, the air itself can seem to almost sting.


A Wave of Boardsailors to Hit Beach
Jayne Fenner, the No. 1 boardsailor in the United States, has seen jams at a starting line before.
But none are likely to equal the crush expected at the United States Windsurfing Association national championships next week in Maui, Hawaii.
At least 150 boardsailors -- or windsurfers, the terms are interchangeable -- are expected at the regatta, Aug. 17-21, at Kanaha Beach Park.
Such a turnout would make the event the largest in the national championships' five-year history.


Wall Street; The New Activism at Fidelity
FIDELITY Investment's quiet role in arousing discontent with Kay R. Whitmore, ousted as Eastman Kodak's chief executive last week, is only the latest evidence that the nation's largest shareholder wants more might for its money.
Over recent years, Fidelity has argued for overhauls at several of the nation's largest companies, and has most recently turned its attention to executive pay.
While some other fund groups are raising their voices, most express discontent by selling.
But at Fidelity, the inspiration for corporate activism comes straight from the top.
Edward C. Johnson 3d, the chairman and chief executive of the FMR Corporation, the mutual fund group's parent, has been forceful in his rare public comments.
"For too long, institutions have failed to act as long-term owners of the equity they hold," he wrote in the Harvard Business Review a few years ago.
"They have failed to use their influence as shareholders."


Mica P. Post, Keith Oberkfell
Mica Patricia Post, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Michael Post of Randolph, N.J., was married yesterday to Keith F. Oberkfell, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Harold Oberkfell, also of Randolph.
The Rev.
Susan Chrystal performed the ceremony at St.
Paul's Episcopal Church in Morris Plains, N.J.
The bride is a doctoral candidate in English literature at the University of Chicago, where she received a master's degree in the same subject.
She graduated summa cum laude from the University of Richmond, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
Her father is a vice president of Lazard Freres &amp; Company, the New York investment bank.


Technology; The Woof and Warp of Tomorrow's Aircraft Parts
IN this riverside city where the textile industry flourished a century and a half ago, there are still a few antique looms at work.
But instead of twills and tweeds, three of the machines are weaving the aircraft of tomorrow.
Textron Specialty Materials, a subsidiary of Textron Inc., has adapted venerable weaving techniques to the task of producing new-wave materials for the aerospace industry.
From Textron's computer-controlled looms roll 60- and 100-inch-wide bolts of titanium ribbon and silicon carbide fabric.
The material is ready for shaping into parts that can withstand the searing heat inside a jet engine or on the skin of a spacecraft re-entering earth's atmosphere -- heat that would cause titanium alone to lose much of its strength.


Custody Trial Explores Backgrounds of Rivals
Regina Twigg still has a bedroom in her home reserved for Kimberly Mays, even though the teen-ager testified this week that she wants nothing to do with Mrs.
Twigg, her natural mother.
The parent Kimberly does want to be with, Robert Mays, has complained to a psychologist that the nation's most unusual child custody case in years has made him feel as if he were "back in Vietnam," and "like I never know what's coming next."


JAPAN RETHINKING THE NUCLEAR PACT
As the city whose name has become synonymous with the horrors of atomic warfare, Hiroshima has transformed its once incinerated central district into a shrine of antinuclear fervor.
Every year on this date at precisely 8:15 A.M., the anniversary of the bombing by the United States, it translates its tragedy into an almost religious mission to control, at all costs, the nuclear genie.
But this year, on an overcast, humid morning, amid the solemn bells, trilling cicadas, speeches and testimonies to the miseries the people endured, came a seeming contradiction.
The Mayor, Takashi Hiraoka, exhorted his country's leaders to reject an indefinite extension of the main tool for limiting the spread of atomic weapons, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which will expire in 1995.

UP AND COMING: Bonnie Hunt; Not Just a Perky Tour Guide
SUDDEN SEMI-STARDOM, SAYS Bonnie Hunt, is a funny thing.
"See, I live in this apartment building," she explained, "and everybody who lives there thinks of me as a housewife. People drop their babies off with me. Or I get notes: 'I'm going to be gone for three days, the keys are under the mat, take care of the cats.' Because they all think I'm home all the time."


In Georgia's Swept Yards, a Dying Tradition
Mismatched pots of begonias and petunias hang from old porches that could use some work.
Painted chicken feeders blossom with zinnias and red salvia.
These yards have no grass -- because they are swept clean with a broom made of dogwood branches gathered in the woods.
They don't look like much at first glance.
But hidden in their unconscious design are traces of West Africa and the emergence of a hard-won independence.


Dying Metaphors Take Flight
I HAVE BEEN THINKING about metaphors lately, and I think you should think about them, too.
I have been thinking that the dying metaphor deserves to live.
In his classic 1946 essay, "Politics and the English Language," George Orwell made a simple division: There is what poets do, the metaphor newly invented that "assists thought by evoking a visual image," and there is the dead metaphor, which no longer evokes any visual image at all.
The dead metaphor has been around so long that it has reverted; it is now just an ordinary word.


AUG. 1-7: Titan IV Blows Up; A Billion Dollars' Worth Of Spy Equipment Gone
More than a secret spy-satellite system was destroyed when a Titan IV rocket blew up last week.
The as yet unexplained explosion wiped out most of the savings Congress trimmed from the intelligence budget this year.
And it grounded the remaining Titan IV rockets that launch such spies in the sky.
The system -- a trio of solar-powered satellites used by the Navy to track foreign ships and listen to their communications -- and the rocket cost at least $1 billion.
That made the explosion the most costly space accident in monetary terms since the 1986 Challenger disaster.


CASTLES IN THE SAND
Four miles east of the Pines, Davis Park is the frontier of escape.
We are the romantics, artists, misfits and surfers who wash up on the uneroded nude beach each summer, year-to-year renters, oblivious to the insurance industry.
We live communally, and many choose to escape not only the sounds of traffic but also of television and telephones.
At night, we see starlight and hear only the unpolluted surf and the sounds of our own musical voices.


Federated Battles Chief's Move
Federated Department Stores Inc. yesterday sued Roger N. Farah, the chairman of its merchandising office, to prevent him from leaving the company to take a job as president of R. H. Macy &amp; Company, one of Federated's largest competitors.
A Federal judge in Cincinnati issued a temporary restraining order that prohibits Mr.
Farah from negotiating for or accepting employment with Macy, which operates the Macy's, Bullock's and I. Magnin chains, Federated said in a statement.
The judge also prohibited Mr.
Farah from disclosing any confidential information or trade secrets to Macy.


World Markets; A Watchdog Gets to Work in Bangkok
THAILAND'S stock market was long compared to a casino in which the games of chance had been rigged.
Insider information was widely circulated.
Market manipulation was rife.
And for years no one much minded, since Thai investors from all walks of life made money as the market boomed along with the economy.
The national motto -- mai pen rai, or "never mind" -- seemed to apply.


AUG. 1-7: Sentenced in Los Angeles; Yet Another Reading Of the Rodney King Tape
Photojournalists know that a news picture needs a caption to tell its story.
They know that different captions can make a picture tell different stories.
The 81-second amateur videotape of the March 1991 beating of Rodney G. King has shown that the same thing is true of news film.
Each set of prosecutors and each set of defense lawyers in two separate trials has given the videotape a new interpretation.
Both juries later said they had found still other ways of understanding it as they worked to reach their different verdicts.


Michelle Iacovelli, James Najarian
Michelle Anne Iacovelli, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Benjamin J. Iacovelli of Lyndhurst, N.J., was married there yesterday to James William Najarian, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Johnnie A. Najarian of River Edge, N.J.
The Rev.
Charles Miller performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at Sacred Heart Church.
Mrs.
Najarian, 25, is a research scientist at Propulsion Science and Technology Inc., an aerospace company in Princeton, N.J.
She graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Her father is a machinist at Hummel Tool and Machine in Kearny, N.J.
Her mother, Evelyn Iacovelli, retired as a clerical worker at the State Farm Insurance Company in Rutherford, N.J.


Testing Newborns for AIDS Virus Raises Issue of Mothers' Privacy
A growing effort in New York State to identify and quickly treat children infected with H.I.V. has led to a struggle over how to reconcile the health needs of the children with the right to privacy of their mothers.
The debate has sharpened with a proposal that state disclose to mothers the results of H.I.V. tests that the State Health Department now performs anonymously on all newborns.
Those tests are conducted in 44 states to help health officials track the progression of the epidemic, but in no state do the testers know who the babies are, say officials from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.


Hayes Proudly Puts Gay and Athlete in the Same Sentence
It was three years ago that Bruce Hayes, then a man frightened by his own sexuality, took control of his fear.
He summoned every ounce of courage he had, certainly more than it took him at 21 years of age to win a gold medal in swimming at the 1984 Olympics, and told the world the truth about himself: he was gay.
Unlike many homosexuals, Hayes was both gay and an athlete -- two words that he had never dared to combine in the same sentence.
But after living a lie for nearly 30 years, he found an institution where being a gay athlete was not only tolerated, but celebrated.
It was the Gay Games III in Vancouver, British Columbia, that allowed Hayes a comfortable atmosphere in which to be himself.


A Great Museum Struggles To Keep Up Appearances
THE TOP-OF-THE-LINE TOURIST ATTRACtion in St.
Petersburg is still what it always was -- the tour of the Hermitage.
If the museum ranks level, in this respect, with Versailles and the Louvre rolled together, it is because that's exactly what it is, with additional echoes of the Metropolitan Museum, the British Museum and the Uffizi in Florence.
There will never be anywhere quite like the Hermitage for the presentation of so great a diversity of major art in an architectural wonderland.
For this reason, the fortunes of the Hermitage in the tumultuous times that have broken out all over the former Soviet Union are a matter of international concern.
The worst potential calamities have been avoided.
Nothing from the collections can or will be sold.
Together with its friendly rival the Russian Museum in St.
Petersburg, the Hermitage has been formally ranked by President Boris Yeltsin among the top cultural institutions of Russia.


For Esiason, Caution. For Nagle, Flash.
The Jets' quarterback competition, which kicked off in earnest in their first preseason game against the Steelers here tonight, looks as if it may become a contrast in styles.
Boomer Esiason, the 10-year veteran whom the Jets picked up last spring in a trade with Cincinnati, is methodical and measured.
He doesn't take many chances and doesn't make many mistakes.
Browning Nagle, who started last season, is brash and bold.
When he's on the field, exciting things happen, whether good or bad.


For Mohawks, a Village to Call Their Own
LAST month, when a group of Mohawk Indians successfully bid on a 300-acre property in Montgomery County, N.Y., a spontaneous celebration broke out among the hundred or so townspeople who had gathered for the auction.
"There was general jubilation. Everybody was hugging and kissing each other," said Kathy Frasier, the wife of Miles Frasier Jr., Supervisor of the Town of Palatine, where the land is situated.


Japan's Uncomfortable Past
As Japan begins its quest for a cleaner, more open political future, it nervously glances back at World War II era brutalities it has never properly acknowledged.
Last Wednesday, the day it left office, the Government of Kiichi Miyazawa conceded that Tokyo was responsible for the wartime abduction of hundreds of thousands of young women throughout Asia and their repeated rape by Japanese soldiers in "comfort stations" created to stimulate the fighting morale of imperial Japanese forces.
Of course, the Miyazawa Government didn't put it quite that plainly, referring only to "the recruitment of comfort women" and noting that this "recruitment" often occurred "against their will." Conceding uncomfortable truths in any form is a welcome advance, but the new regime is obliged to go further.
It must speak much more frankly, and offer direct compensation to these women, now in their 60's and 70's, and to other devastated victims of wartime Japanese militarism.


Conversations/Dan White; Lawyers Aren't So Bad, Really Says a Humorist, With a Laugh
THOUSANDS of lawyers were converging on New York last week, just in time for a new National Law Journal survey showing that lawyers have descended in the public's estimation into the leagues of journalists and elected officials.
But Dan White, Columbia Law School '79, wasn't about to join the American Bar Association as it engaged in defensiveness and self-pity.
If anything, Mr.
White is sort of a lawyer-basher himself, having written "The Official Lawyer's Handbook," a best-seller that both trashed the profession and provided his ticket out of it.


Beach Fears? So Stay Home!
To the Editor:
Regarding Emily Prager's article on sun-protection clothing ("Extreme Protection," Aug. 1): one wonders why Ms.
Prager bothers to spend so much time at the beach, when that is the one place where the sun is most damaging to skin.


Sculptor Fools the Eye With Wooden Apparel
JON BERG'S "Hard Software" plays on two persistent themes in art: the challenge of interpreting flowing folds of cloth in hard material and the trick of luring the eye into seeing an artist's imitation of an object as the actual thing.
In most of the 25 works by Mr.
Berg in the inaugural show at the Gallery at Marsh here, those themes are combined in images of everyday apparel.
For example, Mr.
Berg has carved a mahogany replica of a work shirt draped on a hanger.
The mellow brown tones of the wood are reminiscent of suede, compelling a viewer to verify the illusion by touch.
CRAFTS


The Trials of Ownership in a Recession
BETH DIVNEY always believed that owning a home was sound advice.
And, until recently, such wisdom seemed infallible.
After all, home prices in most places hadn't declined since the Great Depression.
For much of the 70's and 80's appraisals soared in most areas, impelled by a demographic bulge of baby boomers buying their first houses, lenient lending practices, tax incentives and the aggressive marketing of co-ops and condominiums.


On Sunday; Style Divides Subway Rivals United in Need
THE busker and the beggar could be friends.
But they're not often, in their noisome place under the city, for reasons touching on artistic pride, work ethic, or maybe just spare change and human wile.
Wilfredo Alvarez is trying a Bach guitar piece in the wet heat of a Manhattan subway station, fingering intricately as the trains screech in, his music battery-amplified in a far-from-easy livelihood built of quarters from passersby, listening or not.


Sports of The Times; The Players Should Copy The Matador
WHAT baseball needs right now is more Nolan Ryans and Robin Venturas and fewer Bud Seligs and Donald Fehrs and Richard Ravitches.
What we need is more fights on the pitching mound and fewer threats in the perpetual labor struggle.
Fehr and the Players Association are talking about throwing a pre-emptive strike in September, getting the owners during the pennant race before the owners get them next March.
This would be dumb.
This would be really dumb.


Andrea Miano, Kevin Hodges

To the Editor:
Electromagnetic radiation is always present in our environment, since the earth has a field ("Power Lines Raise Fears in Home Buyers," July 11).


Nontoxic Tactics for Coping With Insects
THE term integrated pest management, or I.P.M. as it is often known, is so much a part of horticultural language, it can practically be equated with mulching or weeding.
The appeal of the alternative means of keeping pests under control coincides with the current awareness to do the right thing as far as tending the land is concerned.
The practice of integrated pest management can be carried out whether someone tends a half-acre plot or manages the land of a huge wholesale nursery.
As a case in point, American Nurseryman recently surveyed wholesale growers.
Those who managed as many as 200 acres advocated following some I.P.M. practices in keeping pest populations under control.
In fact, 70 percent of the wholesalers who responded to the survey said that they did not apply pesticides on a fixed schedule, while only 30 percent said they did.
In other words, the trend is toward targeting controls of troublesome insects rather than spraying on schedule just because certain insects are expected to appear at certain times.


Yes, It's Kelly and Scotty, Together Again
ONCE AGAIN, CULP AND COSby are messing around on the set.
They're supposed to be knocked out, lying stone cold on the floor of a dank castle on the outskirts of Vienna.
The director is eyeing the two henchmen who just conked them.
He's not happy.
"Reach down!" he yells to the bad guys.
"Go get their guns!" When the henchmen hesitate, the temptation is too much for the stars.
Knocked out or not, they thrust their guns up in the air for the taking.
Their actions are perfectly synchronized; who knows how?
"Cut!" yells the director.
He rolls his eyes in exasperation.
Mr.
Cosby spins over onto his back, his feet and arms stiff in the air, a cartoon corpse.
Mr.
Culp cracks up.
The technicians laugh.
There they go again.


Liability Is Being Shifted to Auto Renters
FIVE major auto rental companies are shifting a new financial responsibility onto the renter.
These companies, Alamo, Avis, Budget, Hertz and National, have changed their rental contracts in various states to make the renter's own insurance policy the first line of defense if there is an accident involving a liability claim -- i.e., one that injures or kills other people or damages others' property.
Until recently, the liability insurance that rental companies are required to maintain by state laws was the primary coverage.
For drivers who do not carry liability insurance or do not want to put their own policies on the line, the rental companies offer an alternative, which they sell under various names for an added daily fee of $8 or so.
For those without liability coverage who do not buy this, the renting company's back-up coverage becomes the primary coverage, but there is a possibility that the rental company will turn around and sue the renter.
Rich McEvily, a lawyer for Hertz, said, "We say to the renter, "It's up to you to protect your own assets.' "


Forget About Lotus Land. Thank You for Not Smoking.
AS a boy, Roger Diamond sometimes snatched the cigarette from his mother's mouth and demanded that she quit her "disgusting habit." As he grew older, he took to carrying a water pistol with him to squirt at smokers.
Naturally he became a lawyer, and he made it his business to agitate, in vain, to make jury rooms smoke-free.
Today Mr.
Diamond is a successful criminal lawyer, but his heart is still in his anti-smoking campaign.
And now he is tasting one of his greatest victories as a ban on smoking took effect in all restaurants throughout Los Angeles last week.
He is not the leader, but he is one of the most dedicated soldiers in what is just the latest, but perhaps the most authoritarian, in this state's long history of health crusades.


Stephanie Speck, Robert Mastroianni
Stephanie Marie Speck, a daughter of Drs.
William and Phoebe Speck of Tenafly, N.J., was married yesterday to Robert Luigi Mastroianni, a son of Drs.
Luigi Mastroianni and Elaine Pierson-Mastroianni of Haverford, Pa.
The Rev.
Richard S. Crowell performed the Episcopal ceremony at the Church of the Messiah in Woods Hole, Mass.
Mrs.
Mastroianni, 27, teaches the sixth grade and social studies at the Bank Street School for Children in New York.
She graduated from Syracuse University, as did her husband, and received a master's degree in education from Suffolk University.
Her father is the president and chief executive of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.
Her mother is a teacher and an adviser at the Bank Street College of Education in New York and a curriculum consultant for private schools.


Corrections
An article on July 18 about two historic Hudson Valley houses misstated the first name of the architect called in by Louise Livingston to remodel Montgomery Place; he was Alexander Jackson Davis, not Andrew Jackson Davis.
The article also referred imprecisely to the phase of Janet Livingston Montgomery's life when she bought the property in 1802.
She was in her late 50's.


For Scouts, a Merit Badge for Levee-Building
The 26,000 Boy Scouts camped here for the 13th National Scout Jamboree added levee-building to their skills as 13 hours of rain floated sleeping bags and sent streams surging through tents.
The seven-day meeting, which ends Tuesday, is taking place on 6,500 acres at this Army training base about 75 miles south of Washington.
Scouts from 58 countries swapped patches, groused about the macaroni and cheese, and tried activities from snapping bullwhips to tracking satellites.


Parcells Passes Through Patriots' Initiation Rites
Bill Parcells and the New England Patriots became acquainted tonight, and Parcells was the one muttering into his headset.
Last seen on a sideline, Parcells was the victorious Giants coach 31 months ago in Super Bowl XXV, but his Patriot debut this evening was no thriller: a 13-7 exhibition loss to the San Diego Chargers.
Parcells' team missed a field goal, had a touchdown called back by a referee's questionable call, threw an interception on San Diego's 1-yard line and yielded a long bomb in the final seconds of the first half that set up a Charger field goal.
Other than that, Parcells stayed calm.


Our Common American Heritage
To the Editor:
As the publisher of Hippocrene Books, I would like to respond to Thomas Swick's essay on travel guides ("A Guide to Guidebooks for Who You Are, Not Where You're Going," July 4).
Mr.
Swick wrote that Hippocrene's "Polish Heritage Travel Guide to U.S.A. and Canada" "can be of little interest to anyone other than Polish-Americans."


In This Case, 'Purer' Does Not Mean Better
WE LIVE IN A TIME of touching faith in musicology.
We trust our musical scholars to instruct us in proper performance style, to complete works left for one reason or another incomplete and to uncover composers' original intentions, freed from the misguided changes of editors or even from the composers' second thoughts.
But sometimes those entrusted to realize incomplete works have second thoughts of their own.
And if the second thoughts of composers can be overridden, what about those of the people empowered to second-guess them -- especially when the second-guessers are themselves composers?


Demolishing the Holocaust Deniers
To the Editor:
Reviewing "Denying the Holocaust," by Deborah E. Lipstadt, and "Assassins of Memory," by Pierre Vidal-Naquet, Walter Reich notes that these two books, which "analyze the arguments of the Holocaust deniers and demolish them thoroughly and effectively," "are now available to people of good will who do  not know what to say, or what to think, when they are told . . . that the Holocaust never happened."

Suffering for Art
In steamy SoHo, a preview of an exhibition of sculptures by Arnaldo Ferrara Ocanto, 40 Wooster, July 29.


Billy Joel, A Pundit Of Suburbia
Billy Joel HAS ALWAYS HAD A KNACK FOR capturing the mood of the moment in songs that have the insistent blare of tabloid headlines.
A sort of one-man singing newspaper, he typically combines smatterings of news with editorial reflection on everything from music to sex to religion.
As Mr.
Joel has matured, his usually noncontroversial opinions have grown even broader and less prickly.
And on his new album, "River of Dreams" (Columbia 53003; CD, cassette and mini-disk), the 44-year-old singer and songwriter from Hicksville, Long Island, makes the transition from aging rock-and-roll rebel to middle-aged suburban pundit, playing the role of philosophic everyman with a windy bravado.


Goin' Home


Bartlett Updated: Renewing the Idea of a Shared Culture
THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW turned over a good part of its letters space recently to a tempest over the line -- mangled in a review -- "A day away from Tallulah is like a month in the country." It isn't in the new 16th edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.
Six letter writers and the editor attributed it to eight of the usual suspects: George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, Alexander Woollcott, Howard Dietz, Robert Benchley, Ilka Chase, Tallulah Bankhead's husband and Goodman Ace.
In another letter in the same issue we found the poet Anthony Hecht upbraiding the novelist Alison Lurie for failing to notice a light-fingered borrowing by the novelist Peter Ackroyd from the poet Wordsworth about some sentimental mist glittering over some plashy earth.
This is also missing from Bartlett's -- though the new edition has finally caught up with Evelyn Waugh's far more important plashitude: "Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole."
Pity the editors of any familiar quotations volume.
The culture moves so fast these days.
Who knows whose bons mots will be borrowed, twisted, misremembered and misattributed in next week's Book Review?
John Bartlett himself, having begun in 1855 with the essential smattering of Bible, Shakespeare and mostly English stalwarts, went through nine editions in his lifetime without ever awakening to his contemporaries Whitman, Thoreau or Melville.
Today editors have to keep their fingers more tightly on the pulse.
No wonder the editors liked this last one, a micro-Bartlett's, from the Bible to George Eliot in 60 words.


European Voices: Disillusionment and a Growing Fear of 'Many Yugoslavias'
Egon Bahr
Foreign policy analyst for Germany's Social Democratic Party, architect of West Germany's "Eastern policy" in the 1970's under Chancellor Willy Brandt; 71


Author Finds His Inspiration in Demjanjuk and Long Island
JONATHAN DEE'S quietly gripping and controlled second novel, "The Liberty Campaign," is a tale strung plausibly on the thorns of a moral imbroglio as ancient as many of the religions of mankind and as current as today's global television networks.
Published this month by Doubleday, the book should set thoughtful minds abuzz not only on suburban Long Island, where it is set in the fictional town of Belmont, but also wherever Mr. and Mrs.
Ordinary Safe and Prosperous comfortably reside.
Into the predictable daily routines of the novel's main character, the unremarkable, placidly married Gene Trowbridge, a 65-year-old advertising executive on the verge of well-cushioned retirement, suddenly erupts a small volcano of otherworldly evil.
A Neighbor's Past
Gene discovers that his heretofore reclusive, though unfailingly courteous, neighbor, one Albert Ferdinand, was once a war criminal in charge of the torture of anti-Government suspects in Brazil.
With his devoted dog and distinguished bearing, Ferdinand appears to be at several removes from your average "nice and quiet" psychopath.

Mr. and Mrs.

Miss Gullquist, a graduate of Denison University, is a research assistant with Columbus Circle Investors, a money management firm in Stamford, Conn.
Her father is a partner in the New York investment bank of Lazard Freres &amp; Company.


Reds Place Larkin On the Disabled List
The Cincinnati Reds placed shortstop BARRY LARKIN on the 15-day disabled list yesterday, retroactive to Thursday.
Larkin, the starting shortstop in this year's All-Star Game, sprained his left thumb during a game.
Cincinnati recalled infielder WILLIE GREENE from Class AAA Indianapolis to replace Larkin. (AP)


Greenburgh Residents Seek Better Cable TV
EXCEPT for the few who are always present, no matter what the issue, residents' attendance at town meetings is sparse.
Rare is the meeting at which members of the audience outnumber the elected representatives on the dais.
But at the meeting at Greenburgh Town Hall on July 27, the crowd, which grew to more than 160, started to gather nearly an hour before the scheduled 8 P.M. starting time.


Seriously Wired
Billy Idol is playing with his new best friend, technology.
Bounding across the living room of his home in the Hollywood Hills with the manic energy of a truant 10-year-old, the platinum-blond, spiky-haired singer is fixating on one of his favorite toys, a palm-sized camcorder.
The device is sitting atop his enormo-screen television set, pointed toward a sofa across the room and playing it live on the television, turning what was supposed to be a simple, low-tech print interview into a do-it-yourself media event.
Welcome to the wonderful world of Idolvision!
Wearing a black T-shirt, magenta silk pants, combat boots and purple sunglasses, Mr.
Idol looks something like an overgrown punk-rock version of Macaulay Culkin with his finger in a light socket.
He fiddles with the camcorder's lens, mumbling to himself.
"I'm just going to -- ummph, there we go," he says.
"I've got these -- heh, heh; oh, this should be good." At the moment, the television simply shows a straight-on shot of the couch, but Mr.
Idol wants to doctor it up a little.
He picks up a plastic lens and clicks it over the camera's eye.
"This one's a sort of prism," he says.
Now the shot has been broken up into several kaleidoscopic images.
Suddenly we have entered an episode of "The Monkees," circa 1966.
"Ah, yes!" Mr.
Idol says, stepping back and scrutinizing his work.


Beethoven and Jazz at Caramoor; Chamber Music at Falls Village
LAST spring a 19-year-old native of New Canaan, Andrew Armstrong, took first place in the pianist category at the National Federation of Music Club's young artists competition and became the youngest performer admitted to the 1993 Van Cliburn Piano Competition.
This week Mr.
Armstrong makes his recital debut at the Caramoor Summer Festival in Katonah, N.Y.
His 4:15 P.M.
Thursday program should please the audience: the program lists Beethoven's Sonata No. 22, Ravel's "Tombeau de Couperin" and the Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise, a nocturne, two mazurkas and the F Minor Fantasy of Chopin.


Tyson No Model Of Manliness
To the Editor:
The creation of a T-shirt featuring convicted rapist and ex-heavyweight champion Mike Tyson (Surfacing, July 18) is in itself appalling.
Nevertheless, what it represents to young men is even more tragic.
Most young men who wear the T-shirt feel it gives them more power, makes them feel more macho, in control and mentally and physically stronger.
I know a young man who bought the T-shirt because he felt girls would be more attracted to him.
"It makes me look more manly," he said.


Susan Steinkamp, Alexander Boyd

Church-State Clash in Colombia Takes New Twist
A yearlong standoff between the Government and the Roman Catholic Church over a century-old treaty that grants the church unique privileges has been complicated further by a high court declaration that ruling on the pact is beyond its legal domain.
Last year, the constitutional court ruled that most articles in the treaty, known as the Concordato, were at odds with the country's new Constitution, signed in 1991.


A Passel Of Parasols
Whistler and Sargent painted women carrying Chinese parasols in the 1880's, when there was a craze for chinoiserie.
The Edwardians abandoned Chinese parasols for elaborate silk-and-lace Parisian versions.
By the 1920's, lightweight Chinese paper-and-bamboo parasols had reappeared as the height of fashion at the races, at garden parties and summer resorts.
By the end of the decade, parasols were smaller and made of printed cloth to match dresses.
Parasols were discarded before World War II, when suntanning became fashionable.
Today's Chinese paper parasol is both a fashion statement and protection from the sun.
This parasol is heavier than the original; the paper is now coated with a slightly odorous substance that makes it resistant to rain.

In Search of the Bears' Old Glory
The Chicago Bears held their annual pig roast here in training camp last Wednesday.
It was a day for the locals -- giddy each year over the Bears' presence -- to meet the players, take pictures, obtain autographs and enjoy a first peek at just how strong or weak their adopted favorites might be in 1993.
No Bears were stuck with a fork and roasted over the coals along with the pig.


Open but Undeclared War for Mayor
The New York City mayoral campaign is fully under way in every sense but one: neither Mayor David N. Dinkins nor his challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has formally declared his candidacy.
To be sure, each has said over and over in no uncertain terms that he is running, but not in the old-fashioned way, with banners and balloons.
What is going on here?
In part, it's simply a testament to the reality that everyone who needs to know they're running already does.


Storied Danish Manors
PRINCE HAMLET was not the last to find a ghost in one of the great houses of Denmark.
In north Jutland, Gammel Vraa manor was visited for centuries by a naval officer, riding up nightly in a coach drawn by headless horses; not far from Gammel Vraa, at Kokkedal, another legend tells of a knight's daughter, pregnant without benefit of marriage, who was walled into a niche the manor alive and has spent 400 years wandering the premises.
Many Danish manor houses are home to such stories, which people connected to the manors will gladly, even gleefully, relate.
But the real ghosts, in a sense, are the manors themselves.
Denmark is a fiercely egalitarian country now -- income tax begins at around 50 percent -- so the rich and famous are not so rich here.
Manor houses are images of a very different era, the lovely remnants of a fabulous if inequitable past.


Study Doesn't Prove Beer Harms Students
To the Editor:
"Alcohol's Effect on Learning," a "Blackboard" item in your Aug. 1 Education Life supplement, reports on a study by two Duke University professors, but fails to probe shortcomings of the research.
This study is one more overreaching, simplistic attempt to justify massive beer tax increases as the panacea for a problem that has much deeper roots.
The study creates an illusory cause-and-effect link between academic success, the level of state beer taxes and the availability of beer to young people.
It trivializes a problem of educational decline that is rooted in the changing -- some might say weakening -- social, political, environmental and economic fabrics of our society.


Remembering A Different Sarajevo
IT was a warm May evening, and we were having drinks with friends in the garden cafe of the Hotel Europa -- a dignified and slightly faded grand hotel that, with its Turkish carpets, its burnished wooden floors and overstuffed plush furniture, seemed designed for secret assignations in a spy novel by Eric Ambler or Graham Greene.
Paper lanterns glowed softly in the trees of the garden, and, as the waiter brought more wine, our friends spoke of the worsening hardships of life in their city: the mounting ethnic tensions, an inflation rate so high that their salaries depreciated in the half hour it took them to cross town and exchange their dinars for hard currency.
But even these problems seemed somehow less pressing as we laughed and drank wine and watched our children play soccer in the garden with other children from France, from Germany, from all over Yugoslavia.
Suddenly there was a commotion.
A group of gypsy children had run into the cafe.
Everyone was screaming, because one tiny gypsy girl had a broken, jagged broomstick and was tossing it like a javelin.
The gypsy children ran away as quickly as they'd come, and I remember thinking, very clearly: Something's missing.
What was gone was my younger son Leon's denim jacket, which he'd tossed over a chair.
The kids had nimbly lifted it as they'd left.
Leon's shock and sense of betrayal was enormous; he was only slightly comforted when, the next morning, we managed to find him a new denim jacket in the city market.


FOCUS: Vancouver, B.C.; Waterfront Projects Meeting Resistance
WITH British Columbia's economy and real estate market improving, two local developers have been trying to redevelop the waterfront in two affluent communities across the harbor from downtown Vancouver and have run into opposition on several levels.
Land in the two communities -- North Vancouver and West Vancouver -- is scarce and expensive.
The developers, the Larco Group of Companies and the Viam Group, are concentrating on an eight-mile stretch of Marine Drive, proposing new projects and speeding work on those already under way.

Her father, a veterinarian, and her mother, Patricia Gibson, own a veterinary services company that operates the Alameda Animal Hospital in Compton, Calif.


Streetscapes: Gouverneur Hospital; In Murals for Children, Alice's City Wonderland
FOR more than a decade it has been a hollow shell, its bulbous pair of wings puzzling motorists on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.
Now the old Gouverneur Hospital, at Gouverneur Slip and the East River, is being rehabilitated and will open as apartments for the homeless just as a series of unusual 1930's murals rescued from the building go on display on Oct. 1.
The first Gouverneur Hospital opened in 1885 in a former public market building at the center of the wide Gouverneur Slip.
The three-story city hospital had no operating room and was often surrounded by market wagons that blocked ambulance access.
At that time the Lower East side was expanding with European immigration: Martha Frish, a real estate consultant who has studied Gouverneur Hospital, says that the population density reached 330,000 per square mile in the 1890's.
Today, says Esther Padlovsky of the Department of City Planning, the density is about 94,000 per square mile.

Miss Handwerger And Mr. Large
Gretchen M. Handwerger of Paris and Joseph Handwerger of Washington have announced the engagement of their daughter Anne Chapman Handwerger to Curtis Eugene Large, a son of the Rev. and Mrs.
Wayne T. Large of Ann Arbor, Mich.
An October wedding is planned.
Miss Handwerger, 25, and her fiance, 23, are associate consultants at Bain &amp; Company, the management consulting firm in Boston.
They graduated from Yale University, she cum laude.


For a Summer Treat, Blueberry Breakfast
FRESH blueberries make the difference between weekend breakfasts in summer and those spread for family and friends the rest of the year.
With a bowl of blueberries on hand, even the most routine and austere breakfast fare seems more festive.
It takes no effort to scatter fresh blueberries atop a bowl of nutritious and fiber-rich bran cereal or granola or to mix them with plain yogurt.
They dress up a wedge of melon or round cuts of banana.


Gruber Wants Trade
PAUL GRUBER, a six-year veteran, has asked his agent to request a trade from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the unsigned left tackle says he is willing to sit out the season if he doesn't get one.


Lack of New Radar May Have Delayed Tornado Alert
No warning was issued before a tornado hit this city and its suburbs on Friday, killing four people and destroying a historic district, because the twister had not been spotted visually and an updated radar system had not yet been installed, a National Weather Service official said today.
City officials said today that 190 people had been injured by the tornado, which hit about 1:30 P.M., wiping out the Old Towne historic district, an important tourist draw.


PLANE GEOMETRY
Alex S. MacLean's photos are remarkable and Bill McKibben's commentary is insightful ("Plane Geometry," July 4), but one point should be explored.
McKibben sees "the long rows of individual backyard swimming pools" as sadly symbolic of "the preposterousness of our life styles."


Even Castro Sees the Possibilities of Enterprise in Cuba
WHILE debate heats up in the United States over the wisdom of continuing to turn a cold shoulder toward President Fidel Castro, a consensus is growing among American business executives and academics that major changes are inevitable in Cuba, ones likely to transform the island into a lucrative new business frontier.
Many of the executives and scholars say Cuba's badly wasting economy will soon be cast open one way or another, be it through the continued crumbling and eventual collapse of Mr.
Castro's Communist system or through some kind of constructive engagement initiated by the United States to encourage faster reforms.
The latter course is being urged on the Clinton Administration with increasing forcefulness by advocates of a new approach toward the island after 33 years of economic embargo and political ostracism.


Making Health Plans Prove Their Worth
KATHLEEN ANGEL oversees $200 million a year in medical spending for employees of the Digital Equipment Corporation.
But like most benefits executives, she is largely flying blind when it comes to comparing the performances of the slew of health plans used by big companies.
Even the simplest request for information to compare the quality of care, patient satisfaction and cost efficiency, among other things, can produce a harvest of statistical apples and oranges.

Inquiry Focusing on Arson In 2 Brooklyn Girls' Deaths
A fire that killed two girls in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn on Friday is being investigated as a possible arson, a Fire Department spokesman said.
It occurred only hours after an accidental fire several blocks away critically injured two boys, the authorities said.


A Family Totally at Home With Folk Art
BOSTON
THE TWO MASSACHUSETTS farmhouses of Bertram and Nina Fletcher Little are so casually decorated, strangers might assume the couple had purposely played down their folk-art collection, which is one of the finest ever assembled.
"Frankly, the relaxed style of these houses suited the way we lived," said John B. Little, at 66 the eldest of the Littles' three children.
"As kids, we never thought of these things as a collection. They were what we lived with and used."

Spectacular Tide Upsets Dr. Kiernan
The house of upsets maintained its tradition today when Dr.
Kiernan's four-race winning streak came to an end because Spectacular Tide's three-race losing streak came to an end in the $200,000 Sword Dancer Handicap.
Spectacular Tide was no stranger, though.
He arrived with distinction as the grandson of Seattle Slew on his father's side and Spectacular Bid on his mother's side.
He also races only on grass and at long distances, especially at today's distance of a mile and a half.


Results Plus
TRACK AND FIELD Morceli in Near-World-Record Run Noureddine Morceli of Algeria missed the world record in the 3,000 meters by less than half a second yesterday at the Herculis Grand Prix meet in Monte Carlo.
Morceli was timed in 7 minutes 29.24 seconds, just off the world mark of 7:28.96 set by Moses Kiptanui of Kenya last year.
Morceli's performance was the second-best ever in the event.
Morceli, the world record-holder in the 1,500, ran the second-fastest 1,500 earlier this year in 3:29.20.
Samuel Matete (47.94) of Zambia, the 1991 world champion, overtook Kevin Young (48.17) in the final stretch and beat the Olympic gold medalist for the second time in four days in the 400 hurdles.
Jon Drummond beat former world record-holder Leroy Burrell (10.12) in the 100 in 10.05. (AP) SOCCER Zambia Battles Back to an Emotional Tie Zambia, a team rebuilt after most of its players were killed in an April plane crash on the way to a match with Senegal, played a scoreless tie with that country yesterday in a crucial World Cup qualifying match.
The intensely emotional make-up game captivated the neutral crowd in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, that cheered heavily for the resurrected Zambian squad, which remained in contention for a berth in next year's World Cup.
The draw followed Zambia's stirring 2-1 victory over Morocco last month, the first game since the crash that killed 18 players and forced soccer officials to quickly reassemble a new team.
Zambia is 1 point behind Morocco, which is leading Group 2 of the Africa zone with 4 points. (AP) SWIMMING Fifth Gold Medal for Van Almsick The freestyle racer Franziska van Almsick of Germany won her fifth gold medal and Martin Lopez-Zubero avenged a rare defeat at the European Swimming Championships yesterday in Sheffield, England.
Van Almsick, 15, swam the final leg in the 400-meter medley relay, leading the German women past a Russian quartet by more than three seconds.
Van Almsick also has won individual golds in the 100- and 200-meter freestyle races and swam on victorious relay teams in the 400- and 800-meter races.
She is favored to win her sixth gold, in the 50-meter freestyle, today.
Lopez-Zubero, a Spaniard who was born in the United States, lost the 200-meter backstroke in an upset to Vladimir Selkov of Russia on Friday.
Yesterday, Lopez-Zubero overtook Selkov at the halfway point and won in a championship-record 55.03 seconds. (AP) TENNIS Krajicek Outpounds Sampras Richard Krajicek, the defending champion, upset top-ranked Pete Sampras 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3), in a battle of big servers yesterday to advance to the final of the Volvo-Los Angeles tournament.
At 2-2 in the third set, Krajicek's left leg began bothering him and he called for ATP trainer Bill Norris.
After a massage, Krajicek regained his form.
He led by 5-3 in the tie breaker when another one of his big serves and another forehand error by Sampras ended the match.
Krajicek had 10 aces, giving him 39 in four matches this week. (AP) Graf Cruises by Martinez: Top-ranked Steffi Graf took control toward the end of the first set and then breezed past third-seeded Conchita Martinez, 7-5, 6-2, to reach the championship match of the Mazda Classic in Carlsbad, Calif.
Graf will play for her fourth straight tournament title today against second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who advanced with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over unseeded Marketa Kochta in the hard-court event. (AP) Bruguera and Chesnokov in Final: Top-seeded Sergi Bruguera of Spain and No. 3 Andrei Chesnokov of Russia advanced to the championship of the $365,000 Skoda Czech Open yesterday in Prague.
Chesnokov, ranked 31st in the world, rallied from a 5-4 deficit to win the first set against No. 2 Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden, 7-5, then had a 2-0 lead in the second set when Gustafsson retired because of illness.
Bruguera, the world's fifth-ranked player, broke Andrei Cherkasov's serve in the fourth and eighth games of the first set, and went on to defeat the Russian in just 75 minutes, 6-3, 6-1. (AP) LACROSSE U.S.
Women Overwhelm Canadians The United States women's lacrosse team opened defense of its World Cup championship yesterday in Edinburgh, Scotland, with an emphatic 14-0 victory over Canada.
Carin Peterson and Kathleen Geiger scored three goals apiece and Danielle Gallagher, Gail Cummings-Danson and Mandy O'Leary each had two goals for the United States team, and Betsy Dougherty and Mary McCarthy also scored. (AP)


YOUNG RUSSIA'S DEFIANT DECADENCE
Andrew Solomon's article "Young Russia's Defiant Decadence" (July 18) brought to mind haunting scenes from the movie "Cabaret," set in Berlin during the 1920's.
There, too, artistic expression ran wild, after the end of the repressive militarism of Imperial Germany in the First World War.
Under the rule of the liberal Weimar Republic, all sorts of innovations flourished in literature and the arts, as Germans experienced a freedom they had never had before.
Social life was open to experimentation, traditional values were questioned, even homosexuality was accepted.
Yet within a decade, caused by economic problems and a weak commitment to democracy, the freedom of the Weimar Republic gave way to the tyranny of the Third Reich and Hitler's Nazis.


Western Europe's Dreams Turning to Nightmares
Four years after the Berlin wall came down and leaders proclaimed a new era of freedom and prosperity, Western Europe is transfixed by gloom.
The region is staggering through its worst recession since World War II, and unemployment is straining its welfare states to the breaking point.
Instability and violent nationalism in southeastern Europe have prompted hundreds of thousands of refugees to pour westward, setting off a racist backlash in Germany, France and Denmark.


From Russia, With Red Tape: A Technology Boom
LABORING behind the Iron Curtain, Soviet scientists often worked in crude laboratories, struggling to create new medical, chemical or engineering technologies with fewer resources than their Western counterparts.
These disadvantages frequently compelled the scientists to make do, pushing the limits of creativity in ways that led to unorthodox, uniquely economical or especially efficient inventions.
But since nearly every scientific or engineering institute was dedicated to military research, many of the Soviet Union's most innovative scientific discoveries were stamped "top secret" and never seen in the West.


Corrections
An article last Sunday about the Chateau Marmont, the Hollywood hotel, misstated the location where William Goldman wrote the screenplay for "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." It was Princeton, N.J.
The article also incompletely listed the founders of the Manhattan nightclub M.K. and misstated the role of Andre Balazs in its founding.
The club, now closed, was founded by Eric Goode, Jennifer Goode, Bruce Frank and Serge Becker; Mr.

Her father is a marine engineer at John J. McMullen Associates, a marine architectural concern in Newport News.


Mystery Man Evolves
Documents show that a woman who said she was pregnant by Phoenix Suns reserve forward JERROD MUSTAF apparently had a conversation with someone shortly before she was fatally shot.
The documents filed by Glendale, Ariz., police and released Friday also confirm reports that Althea Hayes, 27, told relatives she was pregnant by Mustaf, and that he was pressing her to have an abortion.
They say she went to his home the night before she was slain to refuse his offer of $5,000 to have an abortion and insist he agree to support the child.
Hayes was found shot to death in her suburban Glendale apartment July 24.
Mustaf has denied any involvement with the killing and has refused to discuss his relationship with Hayes.


Much Faking Seen In Tests For Asbestos
New York City investigators said yesterday that they believe that the asbestos tests for more than one-third of the city's schools were complete fabrications and that the Federally mandated inspections of many of those schools never occurred.
They said they reached that conclusion after an examination showed that reports on asbestos testing in 399 of the city's 1,069 schools gave wildly inaccurate or conflicting information.
In some instances, they said, data as basic as the number of building samples taken versus the number tested did not jibe.


Trees Help Us, So Let's Help Them
I was extremely distressed to lose a young ficus tree to disease last year, but the only instruction we received about care of this tree was to water it (and we were grateful that the former homeowners had saved that piece of literature for us).
Now I fear for the other two ficus trees down the street, but no one seems to pay attention to our trees, nor does the town check on possible sick trees.


THE EVOLUTION OF CYBERPUNK
So, what is cyberpunk?
It's really just an attitude, one that tries to give computer geeks' interests (science fiction, comic books, computers) a cool image by infusing them with an aura of male teen-age rebellion (sex, drugs, rock-and-roll) and a psuedo-libertarian philosophy (anarchy, distrust of authority, apocalyptic gloom).
According to "Mondo 2000, a User's Guide to the New Edge -- Cyberpunk, Virtual Reality, Wetware, Designer Aphrodisiacs, Artificial Life, Techno-Erotic Paganism and More" (Harper Perennial, 1992), fundamental tenets include:


Coming Oil Shortage Will Worsen Food Crisis
To the Editor:
I greatly appreciate "Natural Limits" by Lester R. Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute environmental research group (Op-Ed, July 24), concerning his organization's reports on declining food production rates.
Certainly, this problem and population growth, its corollary, portend a frightening global problem.
Such overviews, however, seldom emphasize the problem's relationship to petroleum supply.
The disparity between grain production and population growth is compounded by the fact that our food production and distribution systems run largely on petroleum.
We lack the technology to run these systems without it.


THE BUDGET STRUGGLE: The Overview; REJOICING IS MUTED FOR THE PRESIDENT IN BUDGET VICTORY
While flush with triumph after Congressional passage of his five-year economic plan, President Clinton was careful today to claim the narrow, bruising victory as no more than a first step toward setting the economy on a more prudent course.
Having won over skeptical Democrats only by promising to put together another package of spending cuts by fall, Mr.
Clinton and his aides faced a morning-after prospect of having to return once more to the politically hazardous occupation of singling out victims of the budget knife.


Kimberly Clark, Ted Yarbrough
Kimberly Anne Clark, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
James W. Clark of Tampa, Fla., was married yesterday to Ted Kirk Yarbrough, the son of Drs.

Mrs.
Clark-Yarbrough, 25, is a rehabilitation counselor for mentally ill adults with Federation Employment Guidance Services, a nonprofit social-services agency in Manhattan and the Bronx.
She graduated from Boston College and received a master's degree in developmental psychology from Columbia University.

Profile: Robert A. Iger; A Strong Signal to a Man Who May Be King at ABC
FEW executives get higher marks for good management than Thomas S. Murphy, chairman, and Daniel B. Burke, chief executive, of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
After building Capital Cities into one of the most profitable television-station companies, they acquired ABC in 1986, integrating the two companies well during a rough period for broadcasting.
If their record has had a flaw, it has been the failure to prepare for succession.
Capital Cities/ABC has never had an obvious team of young executives groomed to take over when Mr.
Murphy, who is 68, and Mr.
Burke, 64, eventually retire.
Mr.
Burke is already scheduled to retire next February.


On and Off Field, Butler Beats Coleman in Almost Every Category
When the Mets decided to let Darryl Strawberry leave as a free agent after the 1990 season -- maybe that was the first mistake -- they initiated the Vince Coleman era.
That was definitely a mistake, first or second.
The Mets would have been better off then and they would certainly be better off now if they had decided to make Brett Butler, not Coleman, the symbol and the catalyst of their new offense.


How Thirsty Plants Struggle to Survive
THE cows in New Jersey are so hot they don't feel like making milk.
The drought in Georgia has deep-sixed the corn.
And it almost looks like fall in Central Park.
What the ground needs is a slow, steady rain that lasts about a week.
A sudden heavy downpour will run right off hard-packed soil that in some cases is dry four feet down.

Whose Vacation?
To the Editor: Joyce Maynard's charming piece on travel to London with young children ("A Lark With Kids in London," July 11) reminds me of my own experiences abroad, especially in London and Paris, with toddlers and adolescents.
When in Europe with small children, one delightful way to pass the time and see the sights is to use as a guide a favorite storybook, such as "Babar Loses His Crown" or "Paddington Bear." In the case of the former, with young Jonny Goldin clutching his own stuffed Babar, five Goldins traipsed from the bateau mouche to the Tour Eiffel to the Opera, everywhere looking for Babar's lost crown, following the book's text as itinerary.
In London we retraced Paddington Bear's steps, again using the wonderful children's story as a guide and reading the text on bus rides between destinations.
It is a marvelous way to engage children and their imaginations, while seeing the principal sights and interesting points in between.
HARRISON J. GOLDIN  New York, N.Y.

How a Chef Can Make the Difference
FAIRFIELD COUNTY chefs seem to move among restaurants frequently, and few more so than Philip Costas, a talented cook whose sojourns at Old Rialto in Norwalk and at Bella Luna in Greenwich brightened both places considerably.
Mr.
Costas's followers will be pleased to know that his creativity continues in his own restaurant, Kathleen's, in Stamford.
Named for his mother (who makes the restaurant's ravishing desserts), it is to be found in the space vacated by Angsavanee East.
The long, two-tier dining room, separated into cozier small areas, has the same brass railings, soft lighting, well-napped tables and stylish look as before.
But the walls and accouterments now convey a sense of Americana, with one wall near the entrance suggesting a country cottage.
Even the facade, black with bright blue signage and four windowboxes bursting with fresh flowers, generates sophisticated hominess.

PSYCHIATRY -- Paxil: Yet another contender for the title "The New Prozac." Will this prescription antidepressant become a punch line and the subject of a best-selling book, too?


Page Lichtenfeld And Paul Bondor
Page Leigh Lichtenfeld, a daughter of Judith Lichtenfeld and Merrill S. Lichtenfeld, both of New York, was married yesterday to Paul Arthur Bondor, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Paul L. Bondor of Bakersfield, Calif.
The Rev.
Robert Davidson, a Roman Catholic priest, and Rabbi Shimon Berris officiated at the Princeton University Chapel.
Mr. and Mrs.
Bondor, both 25, graduated cum laude from Princeton University.
The bride, who received a law degree from Harvard University, is to join the Manhattan District Attorney's office next month as an assistant district attorney.
Her father is a member of the New York Stock Exchange and a managing director of Montgomery Securities, a stock brokerage, in New York.


Rebel With a Cuisinart
Hubert Keller, owner of Fleur de Lys in San Francisco, is one of a fading breed of French-born chefs who think America is a great adventure.
The son of a pastry chef from Alsace, he grew up schooled in the ways of France, able to recite the name and nuance of each of his country's 400 cheeses, able to discriminate between a baguette and a boule.
And like a typical French child, the first words he learned to read were "Our forefathers, the Gauls," an ancestry that would insure (he was taught) the cultural, intellectual and, of course, epicurean superiority of a country with 400 cheeses.

CONNECTICUT GUIDE
NORWALK MEMORABILIA
One of Norwalk's claims to fame is the Raggedy Ann doll, created there 76 years ago by Johnny Gruelle.
It is a key component in an exhibition of memorabilia on view through Aug. 22 at 55 North Main Street.
The storefront location houses a collection gathered by Ralph Bloom, city historian and director of what he hopes will soon evolve into a Norwalk Museum.
The display includes locally manufactured furniture, pottery and hats as well as examples of fine art, vintage photographs and a collection of objects from Norwalk Hospital that provide a 19th-century view of the city.
The hospital is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year and its contribution to the exhibit includes chamber pots, apothecary jars, spittoons and an electric shock device from 1872.


When It Comes to the Hereafter, Romance and Sentiment Rule
EVER SINCE THE 1937 "TOPPER" became a hit, spawning two sequels and a television series, Hollywood has been dabbling in ghost stories.
For decades, movies set in haunted houses were a horror staple.
In the past few years, however, it has been fanciful romantic comedies and dramas like "Ghost" (1990), which earned more than $200 million at the box office, and the sentimental "Field of Dreams" (1989), with its baseball-playing ghosts, that seem to beguile Hollywood.
The basic conceit of these ghost movies is that the dearly departed return to guide, reclaim or pester the folks who are left behind.
On the heels of two recently released ghost comedies, "Hocus Pocus" and "My Boyfriend's Back," comes the spirits-in-limbo sweepstakes "Heart and Souls," which opens on Friday with Robert Downey Jr. as a mortal with four soul mates.


French Rails Vs. Computer
Named Socrate after the Greek philosopher, but unfortunately lacking in even basic common sense, the new computerized booking system of the French railroads has exasperated travelers since its introduction early this year and ended up adding as much as 45 minutes to an hour to journeys shortened by the spreading network of TGVs (trains a grande vitesse, or high-speed trains).


Wall Street; Those Looking for Safety Look More to the Yen
THE dollar is very weak.
The dollar is very strong.
The dollar is really just a bystander these days, and is neither strong nor weak.
All of the above are true, or at least seem to be if you look at the numbers the right way.


Ernie Roth and Carolyn Metz
Carolyn Joan Metz, an associate counsel for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, was married on Thursday to Ernie Roth, the president of Furman Roth Advertising.
Both work in New York.
Rabbi Bernard Mandelbaum performed the ceremony at the Sephardic Temple in Cedarhurst, L.I.
Mrs.
Roth graduated magna cum laude from Brooklyn College and received her law degree from Boston University.
She is a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Martin Metz of Marlboro, N.J.
Her father, who is retired, is a professor emeritus of medicine at the Downstate Medical College in Brooklyn.


Weathering the Rally Event
After the United States military fired missiles on Iraq on June 27, President Clinton's approval rating surged 11 points, to 50 percent, for a fortnight.
Ever since Franklin Roosevelt watched his ratings climb after key moments of the Second World War, poll analysts have tracked these involuntary calls to patriotism and given them a name: rally events.
A rally event always provides a boost -- though often only a momentary one -- even if the action is a disaster.
Kennedy, for instance, sustained a five-point bump for a week following the Bay of Pigs incident.
In fact, a President need not even be a willing participant, so long as he remains a sympathetic character.
After Iran seized American hostages, Carter floated on a 30-week, 19-point high that ebbed, to his dismay, during the Democratic primaries; Reagan's approval rating leaped 7 points for 9 weeks following his attempted assasination.
Of course, the public mind can be perverse: Johnson received his biggest bounce in March 1968 after announcing he would not run again.


Caroline J. duPont, William Prickett
Caroline Johnstone duPont, the chairwoman of Summit Aviation Inc., a privately owned airport in Middletown, Del., was married yesterday to William Prickett, a partner in the law firm of Prickett, Jones, Elliott, Kristol &amp; Schnee in Wilmington, Del.
The Rev.
Edward Eastman Godden performed the ceremony at Immanuel Episcopal Church on the Green in New Castle, Del.
Mrs.
Prickett is a daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs.
Paul L. Johnstone.
Her father was a vice president of the Hercules Powder Company in Wilmington.
The bride was a widow.

For Israelis, Getting Away Is a Necessity
If normal patterns hold, at least 600,000 Israelis will travel abroad this year, most of them over the summer.
That is an eighth of the population, the equivalent of more than 30 million Americans.
It is a lot of people rushing for the exits.
Of course, getting away for awhile is standard behavior in most places.
But in Israel the tensions of daily life are so severe, people's nerves so easily frayed, that many fear they might just come apart at the seams unless they slip out now and then.


NOTES
David Hershkovits, right, a co-editor and co-publisher of Paper Magazine, the downtown chronicle, is running for mayor.
And he appears to be quite serious.
"I'm concerned about many of the same issues other people are -- crime, the drug problem, the gun problem, AIDS, freedom of expression -- but I think my approach would be different," said Mr.
Hershkovits, 45, who decided to run because of his frustration with the campaigns of both Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani.
Since he has little time left before Aug. 17 to collect the 7,500 signatures he needs to get on the ballot as an independent, he may be just a write-in candidate.
One thing is sure to be refreshing: Mr.
Hershkovits, who keeps his head completely shaved, promised that he would not wear a hair piece.
"We're the clean party," he said.
"How can anybody run with a toupee?"


How Success Spoiled the European Currency System
FRANCE and Germany haven't quite called off their planned economic marriage, but the relationship is on the rocks.
Last week, Europe's finance ministers announced that they had all but abandoned their 14-year-old plan to limit the fluctuations among the Continent's major currencies.
The arrangement had limited currency variations to 2.5 percent above or below levels set in 1987.
The idea was to stabilize the value of everyone's money so there can ultimately be a single European currency.
But in recent weeks currency markets kept pushing the French franc down and the German mark up too hard for central banks to resist.
So the governments retreated and allowed fluctuation of as much as 15 percent.


The Executive Computer; With New Machines, Apple Keeps Its Edge in Multimedia
MOST of the attention at last week's Macworld computer trade show was focused on a little green Apple, a handheld unit called the Newton.
But Apple Computer Inc. also decided the time was ripe to introduce its most powerful Macintoshes to date.
The new Macintosh Quadra 840AV and its smaller sibling, the Centris 650AV, are the first of what Apple says will be many computers using AV -- audio-visual -- technologies.


Hilary Wechsler, William Gibson
Lewis S. Wechsler of New York and Joan Neary of Brooklyn have announced the engagement of their daughter, Hilary Lauren Wechsler, to William Francis Gibson, a son of Nancy Gibson of Charlottesville, Va., and the late Dr.
John E. Gibson.
An October wedding is planned.
Miss Wechsler is a senior vice president of Lehman Brothers, the New York investment bank.
She graduated magna cum laude from Tufts University and received an M.B.A. degree from Columbia University.
Her mother is a teacher for the Nassau County Board of Cooperative Educational Services in Wantagh, L.I.
Her father is a senior vice president and the director of television programming at Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor, a New York advertising agency.
He is also a creator and the supervisor of "The People's Choice Awards" and "Circus of the Stars" television shows.


For Big Stucco Repairs, Patience and Knowledge
STUCCO is virtually the same material as the mortar used for bricklaying, a combination of cement, lime and sand.
Athough durable like all cement mixtures, it is not flexible.
Cracking of stucco finishes is common and can lead to major damage from water if not repaired.
Most amateurs can fill cracks and repair shallow or small areas of stucco.
Large or deep repairs may call for practiced troweling and other techniques.
But even those are not too difficult if the work is done patiently and with knowledge.
Unfortunately, matching the color and texture of a repair to existing stucco is nearly always impossible.


Green Waits to Play Wyatt Earp
As the soap opera that is the Mets continues to spew forth more and more image-damaging incidents, there is no doubt that reputations have been damaged.
No one knows that more than Dallas Green.
The Mets' manager knows that because he knows just what his billing was when he stepped into office May 19.


A CALIFORNIA JURY PONDERS 9 DEATHS
Dorothea Montalvo Puente, a heavyset 64-year-old, white-haired woman who wears large glasses and floral-print dresses, does not fit the stereotype of a serial killer.
But five years ago, the authorities in Sacramento dug up seven bodies in the lush yard around her boarding house, a two-story Victorian structure with gingerbread trim five blocks from the state Capitol.
All seven of the dead, as well as two other people she is accused of killing, were her tenants.
Five of the victims were women and four were men; they ranged in age from 52 to 80, and none had family or friends to notice they were missing.


Costa Rica Reopens Inquiry in 1984 Bombing
Investigators here are taking a new look at one of the mysteries of Nicaragua's civil war after a newspaper report about a bombing in 1984 that killed four people and wounded a Nicaraguan rebel leader.
On May 30, 1984, in the Nicaraguan jungle just over Costa Rica's northern border, a bomb exploded at a news conference called by the rebel leader Eden Pastora Gomez.

Clinton Is Pulled From the Brink. He'll Be Back.
THE margin could not have been thinner or the stakes higher.
One switched vote in the Senate or the House of Representatives, and Bill Clinton would have lost his economic package and perhaps his Presidency.
So all the bargaining in the great souk on Capitol Hill over the last three months, all the searching for backbone by legislators terrified of the electoral guillotine, clearly was worth it.
Thursday's and Friday's gut-wrenching roll-call victories represented a down payment on Mr.
Clinton's campaign and inaugural promises to get the country moving again.
Failure would have made the President look impotent on the economic issues that stand quite clearly at the center of national politics.
He has avoided that, although the urgency of taming the deficit has allowed him little room for the innovative programs and redirection of Government that he and his party are committed to seek.


Talking in Geneva, Rampaging in Bosnia
IN one respect, last week was a typical week in the year-long effort to negotiate an end to the Bosnian civil war.
At the Muslims' insistence a cease-fire was declared while faction leaders assembled here for more peace talks last Tuesday.
But as soon as negotiations began the Serbs seized a couple of mountains overlooking Sarajevo.
Meanwhile, Muslim troops went on a rampage in central Bosnia.
When scolded about truce violations by the infuriated international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic blithely replied that his men were acting in self-defense, while Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Muslim President, called for an independent inquiry into massacre charges against his forces just as images of mutilated Croat corpses came across Swiss television screens.

Mrs.
Louard graduated cum laude from Wellesley College and received a law degree from Columbia University.
She is the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Voldie McCarthy of New York.
Her father is a supervising audiologist in the New York City Department of Health in Brooklyn.
Her mother, Brenda McCarthy, is a clinical coordinator of nursing services at St.
Luke's Hospital in New York.


THE BUDGET STRUGGLE -- Economic Memo; In Short Run, Economy Could Suffer
Now that the President's $496 billion budget bill has passed, the question on many Americans' minds is whether the plan will help or hurt the economy.
During the debate, the Administration promised that higher taxes, spending curbs and a shrinking deficit would produce millions of new jobs in the next three years.
Congressional opponents, on the other hand, predicted that the deficit-cutting plan would produce nothing but another recession.


James Rodney and Susan Siegel
Susan Siegel, a daughter of Ann and Norman Siegel of Utica, N.Y., was married there last evening to James Rodney, a son of Jane and Burton Rodney of Lawrenceville, N.J.
Rabbi Stanley Gerstein officiated at Temple Beth El.

Her father is a partner in Coupe, Siegel, Hester, Stephens &amp; Kahler, a law firm in Utica.


Restoration of Edison Laboratories Could Cost $30 Million
JOHN BELLE, the New York architect who has helped restore Ellis Island and the South Street Seaport Museum, recently addressed a public hearing on the future of Thomas A. Edison's laboratories here.
Mr.
Belle was among a group of prominent architects who had been invited to present their suggestions for restoring the site, owned and operated by the National Park Service.
It has been described by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of "America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places."


THE BUDGET STRUGGLE -- Political Memo; For Clinton, Plenty of Work Is Left
President Clinton scraped through and got the budget victory on which he staked his Presidency.
Now comes the scary part.

One Democratic Senator who reluctantly voted for the package, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, bought television commercials this weekend defending his decision.


A Tot's Trip to 'Jurassic Park': 'I'm Not Scared, Honest'


Jodi Alper, Robert D. Rosenthal
Jodi Alper, until recently an owner of a basket and novelty gift company in New York, was married last evening to Robert D. Rosenthal, a chairman and a chief executive of the New York Islanders hockey team.

Mrs.
Rosenthal graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.
She is a daughter of Harvey and Marianne Bernstein of Old Westbury, L.I.

The bride's previous marriage ended in divorce, as did the bridegroom's.


The Good Old (Elitist) Days
To the Editor:  In his article "Opera, the Fairest One of All"  [ July 11 ] , Lawrence O'Toole seems to believe that only now, with the invasion of opera by theater and film types and other popmeisters, can it finally become accessible to everyone.
He claims that opera is more democratic, no longer elitist.


More Fun Than Checkers Or Tiddlywinks
Bead stringing is a great way to keep children out of trouble, as long as they don't spill the beads all over the floor.

They also make good gifts to send to camp.
The kits, which cost $15 to $40, are recommended for children ages 7 to 15.

I think The New York Times Book Review did a terrible disservice to its readers when it published the page 1 piece on Holocaust denial (July 11), a branch of fiction promulgated by a few perverse European intellectuals and American pamphleteers, none of them credible or serious.
Would you devote 4,000 words to an examination of the claims of the Flat Earth Society?

Tantalizing New Spin on a Musical Jest
A NOT-SO-FUNNY thing happened to "City of Angels" on the way to the Gateway Playhouse in Bellport.
The first 40's private eye-type Broadway musical, which also happened to be the last musical of the 80's, and the only half-and-half (designed in half living color and half black and white) musical for the stage, suddenly seems to be taken more seriously than not.
Not that the Larry Gelbart book, a sendup of the Philip Marlowe-Sam Spade genre, has lost its cool talent to amuse.
And the Gateway production is spiffy and hard-boiled to order.


Leslie Lucania, Corey Winograd
Leslie Ann Lucania, a daughter of Karen Solomon of Livingston, N.J., and Dr.
John F. Lucania of Hackensack, N.J., was married last evening to Corey Michael Winograd, a son of Elaine and Joel Winograd of Bellmore, L.I.
Rabbi Peter E. Kasdan performed the ceremony at the Woodcliff Lake (N.J.) Hilton.
Mrs.
Winograd, 27, is a management compensation consultant at Frederic W. Cook &amp; Company in New York.
She graduated from the State University at Binghamton, N.Y., and received an M.B.A. degree from Columbia University.
Her father is a dentist in Hackensack.
Her mother is an account executive at G &amp; S Creations, a wholesale and retail jewelry concern in Verona, N.J.


In Indianapolis, Colts Missing Their Engine
The Indianapolis Colts' organization is so angry with its absent quarterback, Jeff George, that it is threatening to make him pay big dollars if he refuses to report.
It isn't that he is unsigned.
In 1990, the Colts mortgaged talent to make him the first choice over all in the National Football League draft and signed him for $14 million over six years.


Gerasimov to Teach in U.S.
Gennadi I. Gerasimov, who was the chief spokesman for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, has accepted a visiting professorship at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., college officials said.
Mr.
Gerasimov, named Ambassador to Portugal in 1990, was also director of information for the Foreign Ministry.
Mr.
Gerasimov is to move to Allentown in September to begin teaching two courses in political science and one in history.


Really Roseanne
I loved Lucy, but she was always getting into trouble.
I loved Miss McNamera and My Little Margie, but who wants to go through life in a cocktail dress?
Forget Loretta Young.
She couldn't enter a room without twirling around the doorknob.
And I didn't like the apron set either: Mama, Harriet, Margaret and Donna.
For a short time though, I did want to be Beulah.
At least, like my mother, she had a man and a job.
Only now, just when I thought I was too old for one, does a real role model come along: She works.
She's funny.
She gets mad at her husband and isn't sappy about her kids.
She's stressed out and hates to clean.
I love Roseanne.
Every Tuesday night, Roseanne cuts through baloney using humor like a machete.
When she whacks a frozen wad of burger so it will defrost faster, it won't break.
When she bounces it off the counter, that doesn't work either.
When she tries to crack it over the edge, television finally catches up with reality.
What happens to Roseanne happens to me.

She and her husband are English teachers, she at Nyack (N.Y.) High School and he at the Felix Fester Junior High School in West Nyack, N.Y.
They received master's degrees in education from Columbia University.


Corrections
An article in The Times Magazine on July 25 about Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for Mayor of New York, misstated Roger Ailes's role in a speech delivered by Mr.
Giuliani at the state Legislative Correspondents Association dinner in 1991.
The speech was written by Mr.
Giuliani and a group of friends and advisers; Mr.
Ailes reviewed it before its delivery and expressed some reservations, but did not write it.


Sophie Chapuisat, Kenneth Smith
FOR many people with unusual schedules and serious passions -- ice-water swimmers, doctors, currency traders, Deadheads -- it helps to marry a like-minded soul.
Kenneth Smith, 37, and Sophie Chapuisat, 28, describe themselves as rowing fanatics.
Both rowed as undergraduates at Columbia University (she was a member of Columbia's first women's crew in 1983) and now belong to a small group of die-hard rowing enthusiasts in New York City.

In the Region: Westchester; A Developer Steps Into Bartering Field
THE glut of office space in Westchester County has inspired one local development company to start an entirely new business venture, designed to keep buildings occupied and tenants happy.
The concept is anything but new.
Through the ancient custom of bartering, the Robert Martin Company, of Elmsford, wants to help tenants dispose of unwanted leases without the tenants losing any money or leaving empty office space behind.


CORRECTION
An article last Sunday about plans to close the automobile showroom in the General Motors Building referred incorrectly to the presence of G.M. dealerships in Manhattan.
Although a dealership partly owned by the racing-car team owner Roger S. Penske was the only G.M. sales location in Manhattan when it closed in 1991, G.M. cars continued to be leased by Potamkin Leasing.
In addition to the leasing showroom, there are now two sales locations, operated by Potamkin Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet.


No-Fault Team
To the Sports Editor:
Dave Anderson's column ("Lewis Death on Celtics' Conscience," The Times, July 29) implying that the Boston Celtics management somehow shares blame for the tragic death of Reggie Lewis stretches credibility.
Lewis sought a second opinion about his health status after the medical team hired by the Celtics said he could not play again.
Dr.
Gilbert Mudge determined that Lewis would be able to resume his basketball career.
Lewis had been working out on an exercise treadmill under Mudge's supervision.
Lewis clearly intended to play basketball again.


Penn Station
To the Editor: My husband and I arrived at Penn Station in New York in early June, en route to a trans-Atlantic cruise.
We each had a heavy suitcase.
To our dismay, we discovered that not one of the escalators was working, and hundreds of passengers were being funneled to the stairs.
While we debated what to do, another passenger hailed a redcap, who picked up her bag, unlocked one of the escalators with a key in his possession and, while a guard stood at the bottom to prevent anyone else from getting on the now-functioning escalator, took his passenger up.
Clearly, there was no mechanical problem.


After 2d Test, Bay Ridge Water Is Declared Safe
Residents of Bay Ridge in Brooklyn can drink their water without fear because a new test showed no harmful bacteria there, a spokesman for New York City's Department of Environmental Protection said yesterday.
A test on Thursday found E. coli, the bacteria that have caused water alerts in other New York neighborhoods in the last few weeks, in a sample taken in southern Bay Ridge.
But yesterday the area was declared trouble free, Ian Michaels of the Department of Environmental Protection said.


2 Mountaineers Out
Two West Virginia defensive line recruits will not play with the Mountaineers this year because they did not meet eligibility requirements, Coach DON NEHLEN said.
FRANK BIRTS of Okeechobee, Fla., and KEITH DRAYTON of Fort Myers, Fla., will not join the team when freshmen report for preseason practice tomorrow.
Nehlen said they failed to meet National Collegiate Athletic Association eligibility requirements for freshmen. (AP)


AUG. 1-7: Jeffries Reinstated; Ruling for Free Speech, No Matter the Source
It's not very often that a judge, in deciding for a plaintiff, calls him "thuggish" and "reprehensible," or that he scolds the other side for failing to present a better case.
But that is what Federal District Judge Kenneth Conboy did last week when he reinstated the controversial Leonard Jeffries as chairman of the black studies department at City College in New York City, from which he had been removed a year ago.
Judge Conboy noted that in June 1991, Dr.
Jeffries did indeed make a speech that contained "hateful" statements about Jews.
He found that City College, one of 21 branches of the City University of New York system, had fired Dr.
Jeffries for that alone, which violated his first amendment free speech rights.

Tragedy Highlights Perils of Croton Dam
IT was on Sunday on the Fourth of July weekend, and 20-year-old Benjamin Vinci Jr. and his friend Chris Sarcone, also 20, had been out drinking.
About 4 A.M., they decided to set off fireworks over the Croton Dam.
The dam had been a popular destination for the two Croton residents when they were growing up.
The two climbed a granite ledge that is four feet high and four feet wide and has no railing, then scaled a nine-foot-high granite valve chamber on the bridge.
After they had shot off about $15 worth of Grand Finale rockets, Mr.
Sarcone jumped safely back onto the ledge.
But Mr.
Vinci lost his footing and fell 77 feet onto the dam's spillway.

Christian Gavigan, Armand B. Erpf
Christian Georgia Gavigan, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Owen D. Gavigan of Locust, N.J., was married yesterday to Armand Bartholomew Erpf, a son of Susan M. Erpf-Van de Bovenkamp of New York and the late Armand G. Erpf.
The Rev.
Joseph Hughes performed the ceremony at the Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in Rumson, N.J.
The bride, a graduate of Georgetown University, is studying acting at Michael Howard Studios in New York.
Her father is a managing director of the Trinity Trading Company, an institutional research and investment banking firm in New York.


WHO'S BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR
For a kid, a day at the office can be better than a theme park.
Where else can you play video games on a Quotron machine (see Nicholas Helfenstein, right), or Xerox your body parts?
Of course, what to wear on these important occasions is no small question.
But fortunately, for fall, everything from rugged, tough-guy clothes to refined separates is a workable option.


LAWRENCE WALSH'S LAST BATTLE
Scott Spencer makes an unwarranted statement in his otherwise perceptive article "Lawrence Walsh's Last Battle" (July 4).
He says: "In choosing Walsh, Reagan-Bush stalwarts may have felt secure that the Iran-contra investigation would be run with gentlemanly tact. . . ."
In fact, Reagan-Bush stalwarts had nothing to do with Walsh's selection.
He was chosen by the Panel to Appoint Independent Counsels, which then consisted of three judges of the United States Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the 7th and 11th Circuits, respectively.
I know of no evidence to suggest these judges violated their oaths of office by asking the "stalwarts" to help in the choice of the person assigned to investigate them.


AUG. 1-7: U.S. Reopens Case; Demjanjuk May Return Home After Dodging The Gallows In Israel
John Demjanjuk, who spent the last four years in an Israeli prison before Israel's highest court overturned his conviction as a Nazi war criminal, may soon be returning to the United States.
On Friday, a Federal appeals court in Cincinnati formally ordered the Government to permit the 73-year-old retired auto worker to re-enter the country.
The judges said Mr.
Demjanjuk should be present while they consider whether to reopen their 1985 decision that stripped him of his American citizenship.
He was charged with falsifying his visa application more than 40 years ago to conceal his past as "Ivan the Terrible," a brutal guard at the Treblinka concentration camp where hundreds of thousands died.

In America; The 6.8% Illusion
Following a marathon struggle, President Clinton has his budget deal.
Now would be a good time for the Administration to stop giving the public a false impression about job creation.
Mr.
Clinton's top economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, says a million jobs have been created so far this year.
To the average ear, that sounds impressive.
It's not.
The Administration sometimes uses employment statistics the way a carnival barker uses his pitch -- to mislead the unsuspecting.


CASTLES IN THE SAND
One of the most distressing facts revealed in your article is that many homeowners are reimbursed for storm losses by Federal Flood Insurance, obtained, no doubt, because private insurance is either prohibitively expensive or possibly unobtainable.


In the Path of the Flood, Hard Times Just Got Harder
The flood water that swamped Deerfield Village Mobile Home Park here last month has receded nearly a foot in recent days, but it has left the twin plagues of foul-smelling mud and larger-than-life mosquitoes.
The muck, the bugs and the stench reminded the 265 families who live here that ferocious rivers, frantic sandbagging and failed levees are only the first chapter in the great flood of 1993 and will be followed by less drama but more misery.

Joining Technology And the Work Force
The article "For Law Graduates, a Scarcity of Jobs" (New Jersey Q &amp; A, July 11), is more evidence of the growing need in this country for an integrated employment agency.
With the combination of new technologies, along with downsizing and re-engineering of jobs, the greatest threat to the American work force has become its own increased productivity.
An example of this could be seen when Martin Allen attributed the scarcity of jobs for lawyers in New Jersey to their own efficiency.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Is It a Butterfly or a Leaf?
THE butterfly counters said they would meet at the I-Hop restaurant in East Norwich.
But the butterfly counters did not say what they looked like.
Entering a roomful of pancake eaters, none of whom carried a net or wore a pith helmet, a reporter had but one option.
"Excuse me," she said to table after table of diners.
"Are you counting butterflies today?"


Questions Over Who Controls Medical Center
EVERY so often, reporters converge on this sprawling 600-acre campus in search of news about a public figure admitted to the County Medical Center.
Last week photographers lay in wait for a glimpse of Leonard Stabb, an actor on the soap opera "Guiding Light," who was being treated here for serious head injuries from a hang-gliding accident.
In the spring the focus was on Jean S. Harris, the former headmistress convicted of killing her lover; she was undergoing quadruple-bypass heart surgery shortly before her pardon from the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility.
But behind the periodic glare of television cameras, local politicians are arguing over who should control this large county-owned hospital -- one that has grown in 77 years from a simple almshouse into the largest critical-care institution in a seven-county region north of New York City.
The center, which has a total of 646 beds, each year admits more than 21,000 patients and serves more than 300,000 emergeny and outpatients.

At Work; The New Equality in Hard Times
LAST hired, first fired, goes the wisdom about women.
By that logic, women should be hit hardest by recessions, and that indeed is what three Bureau of Labor Statistics economists thought they kept reading in news accounts of women's status.
William Goodman, Stephen Antczak and Laura Freeman went back to their files -- comparative male-female data on the five recessions since 1969 -- and confirmed reality as they knew it: men typically fare far worse than women in recessions.
As the three economists point out in research published last month in the Labor Department's Monthly Labor Review, men lost nine times as many jobs as women did in each of the last five recessions.

A.T.&amp;T. Reaches Out (And Grabs Everyone)
FROM a converted barn in the middle of nowhere north of Fresno, Calif., an entrepreneurial spirit named Kenneth Williams runs a computer network that allows personal-computer users anywhere in the country to come together over ordinary phone lines to engage in games like chess, bridge and backgammon, or to chat electronically.
The network fascinated David Neylon, manager of new business development for A.T.&amp;T.'s consumer products group.
Here was a primitive version of a "cyberspace theme park," an electronic funhouse that could ultimately offer all kinds of video games, gossip networks, lonelyhearts clubs and shopping catalogues.
It could be entertaining, like TV; easy, like a telephone, perhaps even addictive, like video games.
What more could a company selling long-distance service want?

American Runners Come Back From Afar
As American athletes sharpen their preparation for the world track and field championships, which begin Saturday in Stuttgart, Germany, a new and talented crop of men has emerged to restore international status to United States runners in the distance events.
Led by Bob Kennedy in the 5,000 meters, Todd Williams in the 10,000 meters and Mark Croghan and Marc Davis in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, the Americans have seen their fortunes take a promising turn this summer.
The average age of this new generation is 23.


Musical Takes Jab or Two at British
THEATER THREE in Port Jefferson is producing the Long Island premiere of "Mr. Cinders," a sprightly British musical comedy that made its debut on the West End in 1929.
American economic troubles at the time kept "Mr. Cinders" from Broadway, and the show, which has music by Vivian Ellis and Richard Meyers and book and lyrics by Clifford Grey and Greatrex Newman, has been seen only in a few regional theaters in recent years.


Department Of Oversight?
To the Editor:  It is incredible to read an article on new horizons in opera and not see one word about the Houston Grand Opera's contribution.
David Gockley, the company's director, is known both nationally and internationally as being on the cutting edge of opera today.
He has brought the company from a budget of $420,000 in 1972 to one of more than $15 million in 1993.
This has been accomplished not only by staging the "safe" operas of the Old World but by venturing into the New World.


An Eclectic Spot With Many Contrasts
HAMPTON SQUARE in Westhampton Beach is a restaurant of striking contrasts.
There is little middle ground.
Some dishes elicited cries of "best ever." Others were so drab and dreary that diners groused all the way home.
Service also ran the gamut from concerned competence on a quiet weeknight to confused amateurism on a Saturday night.
Our waitress on that frenzied evening was not only inexperienced, but also overwhelmed.
It took three requests for seconds on rolls, and the third try was met with a rude response from a busgirl.
The host, who has a friendly word for everyone, was always charming.


Demolishing the Holocaust Deniers
To the Editor:
Thank you for your forceful review of the Holocaust-denier phenomenon.

MARCIA SPIRES New York


'In the Summer House' Preserves Its Riddles
THE DIRECTOR JOANNE AKA- laitis has taken "In the Summer House," an odd play, and made it odder.
In doing so, you could argue, she is simply pushing the work to its limits, forcing it to reveal more of its strange self.
But I wonder if the opposite tactic wouldn't have been more fruitful.
While Jane Bowles's drama has been beautifully laid out at Lincoln Center, much of what transpires on the open stage of the Vivian Beaumont Theater is bound to befuddle you.
No surprise there.
Ever since its original, abortive run on Broadway during the 1953-54 season, the play has enjoyed a well-deserved reputation for being elusive and mysterious.


SERBS CONSOLIDATE HOLD ON MOUNTAIN
Despite pledges by Serbian nationalist leaders to withdraw their forces from two strategic mountains south of Sarajevo, United Nations officers said today that Serbian forces on one of the peaks, Mount Igman, appeared to be consolidating their positions with troop movements and artillery fire.
United Nations officials said United Nations military observers on Mount Igman had reported that on Friday afternoon the Serbian forces opened fire on Bosnian Army units that were abandoning positions on the mountain and withdrawing to Hrasnica, a Bosnian-held town that lies on a narrow plateau between Mount Igman and the Sarajevo airport.


E. Coli the Ubiquitous
It is the Bo Jackson of the bacteria world, the bug-of-all-trades, and it made a reappearance last week in an unusual role, a microscopic clue that led investigators to the scene of an environmental crime.
It is Escherichia coli -- or E. coli for short.
New York City officials were trying to determine what contaminated the water supply.
Samples taken from taps showed E. coli.
Previous studies had shown that the same strains were present in the sediment of the Hillview Reservoir, north of the city.
Sea gull droppings are the presumed culprit.


Mets Split; So Does Saberhagen (With an Injury)
The announcement came in the matter-of-fact way disaster haunts the Mets these days: "Saberhagen hurt his knee warming up," Mets' Manager Dallas Green said yesterday.
At that point, Green had barely digested his chicken noodle soup and an opening-game loss to the Pirates with Doc Gooden on the mound.


Crowd Control Takes on New Meaning at the Pillow
THE YELLOW TUBEROUS BEGO- nias, ringed by clusters of blue lobelia, are in bloom at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival this summer.
Spectators who meander across the grounds to a performance invariably admire the vibrant floral designs that have replaced the overgrown lawns of a decade ago.
Nowadays, such visual delights are programmed as part of an entire festival experience.
Little is left to chance.
"It's no accident when we decide whether people should walk uphill or downhill, or what flowers they see," Samuel A. Miller, the festival's executive director, said recently.
"We help people see. Our job is to stimulate them."


The Mahogany Voice Endures, And So Do the Private Battles
Nina Simone has just released her first major album in 15 years, and she is doing everything possible to stand in the way of its success.
Now 60, the caustic pop-jazz singer, pianist and onetime fiery civil rights advocate has never cared much for public relations, as her label, Elektra Records, has found out.
She has resisted interviews, canceled several concerts, turned down the "Tonight" show and made her only New York appearance this year two months before the album's release.
But none of this is unusual for Ms.
Simone, a cult diva whose shamanistic hold on audiences is matched by an infamous temperament.
About 20 years ago, she left this country for Barbados, then Liberia and Europe.
She angrily denounced the treatment of blacks in America and claimed that record companies and promoters had cheated her.
The Internal Revenue Service had charged her with nonpayment of taxes, another factor in her decision to leave the country.


Heather A. Weisel, Jason A. Pedersen
Heather Ann Weisel, the daughter of Mrs.

The bride, 23, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.
She is a candidate for a doctoral degree in clinical psychology at the California School of Professional Psychology.


Prime Time for Israel's Enemy of Choice
PRESIDENT HAFEZ AL-ASSAD of Syria, who for decades has been one of Israel's most relentless enemies, is now being talked about in Jerusalem and Washington as the man who could nurse the Middle East peace talks back to health.
During Secretary of State Warren Christopher's trip to the Middle East last week, the Syrian leader was praised by the Secretary and by Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, for helping to end the recent fighting between pro-Iranian guerrillas and Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, as well as for fostering progress in the 21-month-old peace negotiations.
And Israeli leaders have been emphasizing that Mr.
Assad is a man they can deal with.


Flooded And Saved
With a resolve that reflected both sheer bravery and a desperate roll of the dice, the Illinois hamlet of Prairie du Rocher staged a dramatic battle against the Mississippi River last week, even as officials were declaring that the end was at last in sight for the great Midwestern flood of 1993.
For now, the village, settled by the French in the 1720's, seems to have come out a winner.


Gilt Is Nice but Seeing Queen Would Be Nicer
For Dorothy Leighton, who traveled down from the north of England, the best part was the Blue Room.
"So many mirrors and such beautiful ice-blue chairs," she marveled, showing off the $15 white bone-china mug she had bought as a souvenir of her morning at Buckingham Palace.
"All I can say is, God bless the Queen!"
Luke Waldron, 14, an American, said he liked the Throne Room.
"It was neat," he said, tugging at a baseball cap.
"You can picture the Queen, like, just sitting there."


Ex-Officer Admits That He Beat Detroit Man
For the first time in the lengthy trial of three former police officers accused in the beating death of a drug suspect last November, one defendant acknowledged striking the suspect in the head with his flashlight.
The former officer, Larry Nevers, fought back tears as he described his encounter with the suspect, Malice Green, outside a Detroit home on Nov. 5.
He took the stand on Tuesday as defense lawyers wound down their case in the trial's 10th week.


Pleased With Its Art Colony, Peekskill Plans for Expansion
AN artist ponders a still life in a spacious studio where partly stretched canvases, smudged paint tubes and a stack of finished paintings create a scene of productive chaos.
The artist, working in the strong northern light provided by a skylight, paints at an easel until a voice calls through an interior window that dinner is ready.
Then she puts down her brushes and walks into the living area of her family's loft.
And so, as city planners here envision it, ends a workday for a future resident of Peekskill's proposed new housing complex for artists.


Serbian General Is Either a Snake or a Charmer, Depending on the Beholder
Atop Mount Bjelasnica, the 6,800-foot peak south of Sarajevo that is one of the newest Serbian conquests, one name dominates the graffiti emblazoned by soldiers on the orange doors of the heavily damaged ski-tow terminal -- Ratko Mladic.
"Long live General Mladic," one triumphal message reads.


Whose Vacation?
To the Editor: The youngsters interviewed make a valid point that children should take part in vacation planning.
We have done this for years, and now that our sons are 13 and nearly 11, I find myself on the asking end of this same question.
Recently it has become all too clear how often the vote is 3 to 1 against Mom.


Attorney General Visits New York


Other Voices
To the Editor:  K. Robert Schwarz says that until the new recording of Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait" on Delos, "innumerable versions . . . ranging from the merely indistinguished to the truly execrable have made it almost impossible to listen to the piece with an open mind"  [ "Record Briefs," July 11 ] .


'Heartbeats' at Goodspeed Opera
IF Amanda McBroom in her flustered little musical "Heartbeats," at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, is trying to tell us that life is a cliche, she may have a point, but what's the point of proving it?
Ms.
McBroom's theme is a stagnating marriage; her characters are "Annie, the wife" and "Steve, the husband," married 20 years and two months.
An ensemble of four, a sort of everychorus, plays umpteen parts.
Among them are back-up singers, Annie and Steve's younger, still younger and even unmarried selves, Annie and Steve's son and daughter (both airheads), and high-kicking supermarket delivery kids in spangled costumes.

She and her fiance received doctorates in clinical psychology from Fairleigh Dickinson University.


MY LIFE IN THE MILITARY CLOSET
Jose Zuniga's article "My Life in the Military Closet" (July 11) documents the way in which the Army fosters, validates and even demands hatred of homosexuals by its recruits.
Then the Army turns around and says, "We couldn't lift the ban against homosexuals; the hatred among our men would cause terrible morale problems" -- as if it had nothing to do with the inculcation of that very hatred.

HEALTH-CARE REFORM
The picture of American health care, as envisioned by Alain Enthoven, is as instructive for what is to be left out as for what is to be covered ("The Abandoned Father of Health-Care Reform," by John Hubner, July 18).
For example, the proposal to omit vision care "other than treatment for eye injuries or inherited abnormalities" would abandon nearly all patients with cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration, the four leading causes of acquired blindness in the United States today.

Senate Confirms Freeh as New F.B.I. Chief
Without a word of debate and by unanimous consent, Judge Louis J. Freeh was confirmed as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation late Friday night by the Senate.
But Republican Senators prevented action on the House-Senate compromise on President Clinton's national service legislation and on his nomination of Dr.
Joycelyn Elders to be Surgeon General.
Both will be acted on, and are all but certain to be approved, as soon as the Senate returns after Labor Day from a month's vacation..


Lost Valley Found
To the Editor: Your June 6 article on Lost Valley Ranch ("A Dude Tries the Ranch Life in Colorado") accurately describes this fun, friendly vacaton spot.
I have played cowgirl at Lost Valley annually since 1972.
I have watched it and the Foster and Reynolds families grow, participated in cattle roundups, built and painted wagons, judged costume parties and, most important, made many lifetime friends from all over the globe.


Just a Moment on Those Layoff 'Experts'
To the Editor:
It takes gall to quote management consultants and "job search" types who say 1,000 resumes are crossing their desks each month, only to quickly add that "looking desperately for another job just to put food on the table is not a long-term solution."


An Island of Summer Fun in Bridgeport
"IT'S about a mile from 95," a visitor was told as part of the directions to the McGivney Community Center in Bridgeport.
"And lock your doors."
For nearly that entire distance, from the exit ramp to the turn off East Main Street in the city's economically depressed East Side, the visitor had an escort of sorts: a battered late-model car with Massachusetts plates traveling slowly yet erratically, with its driver's head turning to one side and then the other, scanning the streets that throbbed with the rhythms of everyday life.


Amid the Balkan War, The Game Goes On
MORE than two years of fighting, destruction and suffering in the Balkans have been no deterrent to the staging of chess events there.
The people of Yugoslavia and the republics that have seceded from it are fanatical chess players; in fact, the ratio of chess players to the population at large is the highest in the world.
The latest chess event was the Yugoslav Team Championship, restricted to Serbia and Montenegro, the two remaining republics in the Yugoslav federation.
The event took place in early June in Becici, Montenegro, where more than a thousand players participated on 150 teams.
The winner was the Agrouniverzal team of Belgrade.


POSTINGS: Millbrook's Halcyon Hall; Good Deal for a 19th-Century Landmark
There may be halcyon days ahead after all for the vacant and decaying Halcyon Hall in Millbrook, N.Y.
The 200-room Queen Anne style 19th-century building had been the subject of a dispute between preservation groups and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
An agreement reached late last month allows the listing of the hall and its adjacent chapel on the National Register of Historic Places and marketing of the property by preservation groups for nine months, beginning Aug. 18, with binding historic-preservation covenants.
It also calls for repairing and stabilizing the Dutchess Country property.
It settles a lawsuit filed last November against the F.D.I.C. on behalf of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Preservation League of New York and the Friends of Halcyon Hall.

Her mother is a real estate agent at Vincent &amp; Whittemore in Bedford Village, N.Y.


Getting Results in Setting Standards
To the Editor:
Arathi Prabhakar is off to a good start as director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("She's Not Just Setting Standards," Profile, Aug. 1).
She undoubtedly will succeed whereas, 25 years ago, a high-level attempt to similarly refocus the then-National Bureau of Standards died in Congress.

Fight on Subway Recounted In 2 Officers' Assault Trial
A violent clash last year between a teen-ager and several New York City police officers who were leaving an unruly demonstration by off-duty officers at City Hall is being graphically recounted in a Brooklyn courtroom.
Two of the officers involved in the clash are on trial on assault charges for what prosecutors say was a vicious and "excessive" beating they joined in giving the teen-ager, after he severely slashed the face of a third officer with a razor blade in a dispute on a subway train in Brooklyn.
The officers were off duty and in civilian clothes at the time.

Civics Lesson
To the Sports Editor:
By what leap of guilt or hubris does Harvey Araton imagine that in the debate over the future home of the Yankees, his own move to the suburbs matters a fig? ("Where Do George's Critics Live?" The Times, Aug. 1).
In light of the millions of dollars of tax and other benefits Steinbrenner has received from the city, the Yankee owner's attempt to paint his desire to move to the suburbs as that of a practical businessman operating in a world of unfettered capitalism is a travesty.
Araton's job is to expose the travesty and address the issue: civic responsibility to the people who live in the city and who have subsidized Steinbrenner's wallet.

Ultrair Drops Scheduled Service
Ultrair, a fledgling airline that offered upscale amenities on flights between Houston and New York, has ceased operating as a scheduled carrier.
Ultrair executives said they decided to cut their losses and halt service on July 25 after six months of operations because too few passengers lined up for the company's offer of fancy meals and extra leg room at prices that matched the coach service offered by larger competitors on the route.
Its meals were developed by Tony's, a noted Houston restaurant.
Ultrair removed roughly 60 seats from its 727's, which typically have 150 seats, to add more leg room for passengers.


Safety vs. Esthetics on Bronx River
THE narrow swath of parkland nestled between the Metro-North railroad tracks and the Bronx River Parkway here is thick with century-old trees, protected species of ferns and other plants and birds skimming over the sun-dappled river.
The paved pathway through the 68-year-old park -- the first county park to be created in Westchester and one of the oldest in the nation -- is popular with joggers and bicyclists, many of whom begin their route at the bridge near Harney Road here and continue southward to Yonkers.
In addition, the park, called the Bronx River Reservation, is closely watched by several conservation groups.


Nontoxic Tactics for Coping With Insects
THE term integrated pest management, or I.P.M. as it is often known, is so much a part of horticultural language, it can practically be equated with mulching or weeding.
The appeal of the alternative means of keeping pests under control coincides with the current awareness to do the right thing as far as tending the land is concerned.
The practice of integrated pest management can be carried out whether someone tends a half-acre plot or manages the land of a huge wholesale nursery.
As a case in point, American Nurseryman recently surveyed wholesale growers.
Those who managed as many as 200 acres advocated following some I.P.M. practices in keeping pest populations under control.
In fact, 70 percent of the wholesalers who responded to the survey said that they did not apply pesticides on a fixed schedule, while only 30 percent said they did.
In other words, the trend is toward targeting controls of troublesome insects rather than spraying on schedule just because certain insects are expected to appear at certain times.


Gunk-Holing in the Pacific Northwest
OFF the coast of Washington and British Columbia, tucked away like so many hidden jewels, are the San Juan and Gulf Islands, at once civilized and untrampled.
To explore them in a way that was free of structure and ferry schedules, last summer we chartered a sailboat and set out for a week of gunk-holing.
Gunk-holing is a kind of nautical meandering, dipping in and out of coves and inlets.
The San Juans and their sister archipelago to the north, the Gulfs, turned out to be an ideal place to do it.


Defining a New Role for Unions of Future
Union leaders are fighting for the Clinton Administration to include a role for organized labor in its definition of the workplace of the future, and to enact provisions that will help revive the union movement in the United States.
But the Administration is not ready to go that far, even though labor gave strong support to Mr.
Clinton's campaign last year.


Inger McCrorey, Dean N. Parker

Zoeller Is Advancing
Fuzzy Zoeller, playing his best golf in years, charged into the lead on the first hole, then pulled away from the pack in the third round of the Buick Open yesterday in Grand Blanc, Mich.
Zoeller, 41 years old, plays a limited schedule because of back problems and outside business interests.
He hasn't won since 1986.
But he shot 66 for a three-round total of 200, 16 under par, and a four-stroke lead over Larry Mize, who shot 71 at Warwick Hills Country Club.

Q and A
Swiss Watches

On Wheels -- America at 10 M.P.H.; Where Crossing the State Line Produces a Colorful New World
Most of the time, state borders have the geographical import of lines drawn in the sand with a stick, signifying little but a change in who gets the real estate taxes.
But a bicyclist crossing over from Brookings, S.D., into southern Minnesota experiences something on the order of Dorothy dropping out of Kansas into Munchkinland.
After three days of dry wind, level, arrow-straight highway and, even in this wet summer, bleached farmland and sky, the road didn't exactly turn to yellow brick, but everything else suddenly became almost garish with color.
For one thing, Minnesota has trees.


Fox May Get Exempt Letter
It's likely the Giants will send a five-day exempt letter on Monday to holdout Mike Fox that, if ignored by the defensive end, could result in his being barred from playing in up to three regular-season games.
The point of the letter, designed to limit the length of holdouts for unsigned players, is part of the new collective bargaining agreement between the players and the National Football League.
It was designed to limit the length of holdouts for unsigned players.


Limited Run
To the Sports Editor:
In "World Set Right for a Day: Runners' Peace in Belgrade" (The Times, July 18), Fred Lebow writes, "I was quite amazed to find a charming and bustling city that has escaped the fighting . . . with residents playing chess and tennis, listening to music and dancing." I wonder how many residents in Sarajevo and Tuzla are playing tennis and dancing?
How many charming and bustling cities in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is the regime in Belgrade responsible for directly and indirectly destroying?


Drug Testing From the Security Standpoint
To the Editor:
Regarding "The Trouble With Drug Testing" (Letters, Aug. 1): Would your letter writers be as cavalier about drug testing for security personnel if they or a member of their family were criminally assaulted by a drug-using released felon who has been hired as a "security guard"?


NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY PAPERBACKS
AFRICAN LAUGHTER: Four Visits to Zimbabwe By Doris Lessing.
Harper Perennial, $13.
The author revisited her homeland at intervals between 1982 and 1992.
As she describes the burdens crippling Zimbabwe, her book becomes an elegy for the hope that accompanied independence.
Last year our reviewer, Vincent Crapanzano, called it a "brilliant report."


Future of the Pill May Lie Just Over the Counter
FOR all America's prudishness about sex, the shelves of the local drugstore are cluttered with products designed to permit at least an occasional dalliance, from spermicidal foams and sponges to condoms of every improbable texture and size.
And now the debate has begun in earnest over whether birth control pills, too, should be sold over the counter, without the doctor's prescription that is currently required.
As might be expected of a discussion about the only medication of sufficient sociocultural stature to merit the imperious designation "the pill," the issue is fraught with complexities and implications.
Those complexities were thrashed out at a recent conference on the subject held in Menlo Park., Calif., by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health research foundation.
This week, an article on the debate will appear in the American Journal of Public Health.
And Schering-Plough Healthcare, one of several manufacturers of oral contraceptives, plans to apply to the Food and Drug Administration early next year to sell its pill over the counter.


Why Belgium Had to Surrender to Nazis
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 2 obituary of Baudouin I, King of Belgium, states that his father, King Leopold III, was "widely criticized for surrendering Belgium to the Nazis." You misstate the case.


Stamps; A Postal Museum Without Cobwebs
Everything about the National Postal Museum, which opened in Washington on July 30, is clear and crisp, just as philatelic things should be.
Except for the name.
It really is a history museum, and it would be a shame if "postal" put off people who think of stamp collectors as dry academics.
The museum, the 14th in the Smithsonian Institution's franchise, is in what was the Washington City Post Office Building, just to the right as you go out of Union Station, and it is a very lively place.

Going-Out-of-Business Sale For Soviets' Space Program
The gaze behind the helmet visor on the soft pink face of Ivan Ivanovich, the first Soviet mannequin in space, is melancholy as all Pushkin.
It is as if Ivan always knew the gallant adventure of Communism's astronauts would come to this -- a hard-currency auction at Sotheby's.


Teddy Bears For London
London's Kensington Town Hall will be packed with teddy bears on Aug. 29 and 30 for the fifth annual British Teddy Bear Festival.
With more than 130 exhibitors, including specialty shops and artisans, there will be more than 10,000 bears -- antique, modern, large, small, machine-made and hand-stitched -- for sale.


Mutual Funds; Some Options for Startup Investors
INVESTING takes many twists and turns through a lifetime, and what makes sense for beginners in their 20's and 30's is far different from what's best for their elders.
The 20's and 30's are realistically a time of spending, not saving: college loans are paid off, a home is bought and furnished, a family started.
Still, some money should be set aside, financial planners say.
"Start with the idea that investing is not a choice, it's a necessity," said Carol C. Pankros, a planner in Palatine, Ill., a Chicago suburb.


Judge Ginsburg Serves as Living Link to Early Equality Battles
To the Editor:
Coincidentally, as the Senate confirmation hearings for Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg were coming to a close, you published a feature article July 24 on Kaufman's all-night pharmacy on Lexington Avenue and 50th Street in Manhattan.
The hearings had brought to my mind earlier testimony, some 22 or 23 years ago, when Judge Ginsburg -- then a law professor at Rutgers -- appeared before the New York City Council in support of a bill I sponsored.
The bill banned sex discrimination in places of public accommodation.
It was precedent-setting and even a little controversial.
I was most appreciative of the scholarly, legal arguments Professor Ginsburg presented.


Trees Help Us, So Let's Help Them
Re: "The Trees Fall, Victims of Neglect" (July 18):
Thank you for calling to our attention the plight of state, county and municipally owned New Jersey trees.
We agree that not only are trees esthetically pleasing, providing virtuous things like shade, but also they are good for our health, veritable filtration systems reducing air pollution.


Reeves Era Starts On Note of Optimism
And who said Giants Coach Dan Reeves was no fun?
John Elway recently whined that playing for Reeves was hell.
If that's the case, the Giants want you to pass the sunscreen because they'll take it.
No, the Cincinnati Bengals, New York's opponent tonight at sold-out Riverfront Stadium, probably won't be making the trip to the Super Bowl this year.
The salad bowl is more like it.
But in all, the Giants' first showing under new coach Reeves was a solid and successful one.


Sanford Stark, Miriam Herman
Stephen and Joan Stark of Scarsdale, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their son, Sanford Weil Stark, to Miriam Florence Herman, the daughter of Odette Klein Herman of Chevy Chase, Md., and Harry H. Herman Jr. of Washington.
A November wedding is planned.
Miss Herman graduated summa cum laude from Yale University, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and from which she received a law degree.
Next month, she is to become a clerk for Judge Morton I. Greenberg of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Trenton.
Her father is a consulting engineer in Washington.


Scrambling Leader, Scrambled Team
In 1991, after reconstructive knee surgery, Randall Cunningham reported to the Philadelphia Eagles training camp here wearing a cap saying, "I'll Be Back Scrambling."
Last year, his cap read, "He's Back Scrambling."


Not So Mysterious
To the Editor:  In his review of the Balthus exhibition in Lausanne  [ "Mysterious Works From a Mysterious Man," July 11 ] , Nicholas Fox Weber writes that "little is known of his life -- which suits him perfectly." This statement is surprising.
The catalogue of the Metropolitan Museum's exhibition of Balthus in 1984 contains a great deal of facts, dates and information on his life based on research work for my doctoral dissertation.
Further, there is a discussion of these facts as they relate to his work.


For Asian-Americans, a Way to Fight a Maddening Stereotype
AFTER David Ching started as a team supervisor at his company, some of his colleagues told him he wasn't decisive enough.
"I try to get groups in consensus," said the 28-year-old Chinese-American, who works in computer operations at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif.
"Sometimes I've gotten flak for it, like 'Why can't you come out and make a decision?' "


Sound Bytes; How Did They Do 'Tommy'? Enter a Mysterious Computer
John Arnone is the set designer for the Broadway production of "Tommy," for which he received the Outer Critics Circle Award, the Drama Desk Award and the Tony Award for best set design.
The musical, written by the British rock star Pete Townsend and directed by Des McAnuff, is an elaborate, computer-driven production that defines the idea of "multimedia."
On Mr.
Arnone's set, banks of projectors fire off rapid volleys of still images on big and small screens, walls of video monitors augment the action on stage, special effects in lighting create illusions, an actor flies, and a pinball machine explodes.
Mr.
Townsend, meanwhile, is reportedly working on a musical in which virtual reality is a theme.


Traffic Report
To the Sports Editor:
I have been a Yankee fan for more than 50 years.
I will never again attempt to attend a game at Yankee Stadium unless I can leave my house four hours before game time.
On Sunday, July 25, I left my home in Wayne, N.J., with my daughter at 11:45 A.M. to attend a 1:30 P.M. game.
The George Washington Bridge and the Major Deegan Expressway (a misnomer) were virtual parking lots.
I finally reached the Yankee Stadium exit at 2:20 P.M., at which time the Yankees were behind, 7-0.
I am certain it would have taken at least another hour to reach the Stadium.

Mordecai Richler's characterization of "the rest of Canada" as an "indistinct society" is even truer than he knows (On Language: "Gros Mac Attack," July 18).
As a fellow Montrealer, who has lived outside Canada for the past 36 years while keeping my Canadian citizenship, I have found in the the course of extensive travel that being Canadian is the closest thing to being stateless, while retaining a valid passport.
Brits all think I'm American; Americans can't figure out why I'm not American, and almost everyone else in the world doesn't believe there's a difference.
Only the French can tell Canadians and Americans apart, and they are laughing so hard at our accents that I can never get them to say how they do it.

Nontoxic Tactics for Coping With Insects
THE term integrated pest management, or I.P.M. as it is often known, is so much a part of horticultural language, it can practically be equated with mulching or weeding.
The appeal of the alternative means of keeping pests under control coincides with the current awareness to do the right thing as far as tending the land is concerned.
The practice of integrated pest management can be carried out whether someone tends a half-acre plot or manages the land of a huge wholesale nursery.
As a case in point, American Nurseryman recently surveyed wholesale growers.
Those who managed as many as 200 acres advocated following some I.P.M. practices in keeping pest populations under control.
In fact, 70 percent of the wholesalers who responded to the survey said that they did not apply pesticides on a fixed schedule, while only 30 percent said they did.
In other words, the trend is toward targeting controls of troublesome insects rather than spraying on schedule just because certain insects are expected to appear at certain times.


School Officials Begin Vast Testing and Cleanup Operation
New York City school officials began to attack the school system's asbestos problem yesterday, ordering custodians into more than 700 schools to close off dangerous areas as inspectors moved into dozens of other buildings to collect samples.
Anxious parents kept 17 operators busy with calls to an asbestos-crisis hotline set up in a workroom at the Division of School Facilities headquarters in Long Island City, Queens.


Mary A. Procida, Glenn Moramarco
Mary Angela Procida, a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Pennsylvania, was married yesterday to Glenn J. Moramarco, an assistant United States attorney in Camden, N.J.
The Rev.

She also received a law degree from Harvard.
She is the daughter of Vincent and Imelda Procida of New York.


No Headline
The Rev.
Homer A. Jack, a Unitarian minister who headed a United Nations disarmament agency for a decade and championed other peace and civil rights causes, died at his home in Swarthmore, Pa., on Thursday.
He was 77.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.


Holland Without a Country
Agnieszka Holland is lost in a Communist labyrinth.
Before and behind her stretch the corridors of Warsaw's television headquarters, with their peeling walls and padded doors, their ominous dun-colored sameness and the rancid redolence of a defeated ideology.
Holland peers ahead through thick spectacles, her disorientation mounting as identical vistas emerge around each corner.
But her pace never slackens.
"This," the Polish-born movie director mutters in exasperation, "is the architecture of repression."
Although recently embraced by Hollywood, Holland understands rejection and repression in her bones.
Her highly successful 1991 film, "Europa, Europa," about a young German Jew propelled by outlandish chance into the Hitler Youth, made her the most talked-about European director in the United States.
Her 1992 film, "Olivier, Olivier," in which a young boy disappears and seemingly reappears six years later, added fuel to the enthusiasm.
But to reach America, Holland had to fight -- and still she struggles to escape her past.
Imprisoned in Prague, exiled in France and long persecuted in her own country, Holland has repeatedly paid for a mixed Polish Catholic and Jewish ancestry that places her at the hub of this century's violence.


In a Crackdown, Egypt to Try 53 Muslim Militants
Tightening its grip on the Islamic fundamentalist movement, the Egyptian Government will put 53 more Muslim militants on trial in a special military court next week, security officials and a lawyer for the defendants say.
The men are charged with murder, forming an illegal organization and other crimes, and could face the death penalty if convicted.


In a Drought, Some Plants Are Tougher Than Others
As the drought continues, take note of the survivors in the desert.
Sedums do well in dry weather, thanks to their waxy cuticles and an ability to store carbon dioxide at night, rather than in the daytime, which means they lose less water vapor during transpiration.
The display gardens at Nassau County's Cornell Cooperative Extension in Plainview, which is experimenting with drought-tolerant plants, have some unexpected flops and successes.

A Last Tribute to Belgium's King Baudouin


The World Bank Responds
To the Editor:
In "World Bank Needs a Wake-Up Call" (Aug. 1), Gary Kleiman argued that the World Bank is assisting nations that no longer need help and neglecting nations that desperately do.
Both claims are false.


HEALTH-CARE REFORM
Rather than raise deductibles or have patients "make a $10 co-payment" every time they visit a doctor, the new health-care plan should encourage "well care" by providing full reimbursement for one medical and dental checkup per year.
Money spent on early detection of potential health problems is a sound investment.

Cuomo Vetoes a Fishing Limit Near Long Island
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo has vetoed a bill intended to resolve a dispute between the commercial fishermen of Long Island and sport fishermen.
The bill, which passed virtually without opposition in the State Assembly and Senate, would have limited the use of trawl, or drag, nets near Long Island inlets where fish normally enter and leave the bays during spawning and migration periods.
It would also have banned the use of such nets within a mile of Long Island, instead of the current half-mile limit, from Jan. 1 through June 15.


For a Summer Treat, Blueberry Breakfast
FRESH blueberries make the difference between weekend breakfasts in summer and those spread for family and friends the rest of the year.

They dress up a wedge of melon or round cuts of banana.


For the Record
To the Editor:  In his review of the recording of "Tommy," Ken Tucker repeatedly refers to it as a soundtrack  [ "In the 90's, 'Tommy' Plays a Fancier Pinball," July 18 ] .

Hollywood's Widower Fantasy
Sam Baldwin is perfect.
He is charming, wry, sensitive, successful, handsome, a great father, and, most of all, he absolutely adores his wife.
Oh, the perfect part?
She's dead.
Sam Baldwin is the character played by Tom Hanks in "Sleepless in Seattle," the romantic comedy hit of the summer.
In the movie and in the movie theaters, Sam is the object of swooning fantasies on the part of the nation's single women.
Why?
Sure, the charm, wryness, etc., of Tom Hanks helps.
But the secret of the movie's success is that it identifies the ideal man for our times: the New Widower.


Editorial Notebook; Rudy vs. Dave
One of the nice things about a political campaign is that once it heats up, we no longer have to depend on political consultants and spokespersons to size up the contest.
We can watch the candidates themselves, and nothing is more revealing of character and strategy.
In that regard Mayor David Dinkins and his principal challenger, Rudolph Giuliani, put on an informative show last week.
They and George Marlin, the Conservative candidate, showed up for a forum on housing that was in itself a masterpiece of poor planning.
Several days of publicity drew a good crowd, but most of them never got inside the tiny subterranean auditorium built for about 250 people.


Call It Baseball or Call It Business, It's Still Booming
AS the bids soared in the auction of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team last week in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, one of the many lawyers in the standing-room-only courtroom smiled gleefully and said in a stage whisper, "Keep going, guys. I like it, I like it."
The lawyer happened to represent one of the Orioles' minority owners, Sargent Shriver, who profited handsomely from the winning $173 million bid.
But in another sense, baseball profited, too.

For Big Stucco Repairs, Patience and Knowledge
STUCCO is virtually the same material as the mortar used for bricklaying, a combination of cement, lime and sand.
Athough durable like all cement mixtures, it is not flexible.
Cracking of stucco finishes is common and can lead to major damage from water if not repaired.
Most amateurs can fill cracks and repair shallow or small areas of stucco.
Large or deep repairs may call for practiced troweling and other techniques.
But even those are not too difficult if the work is done patiently and with knowledge.
Unfortunately, matching the color and texture of a repair to existing stucco is nearly always impossible.

Military's Leaders Are Jockeying In Effort to Be Powell's Successor
On Tuesday night, President Clinton will be the host for an unusual soiree at the White House: The guests will be his 16 top military commanders.
For a handful of these admirals and generals, the occasion will test all their political and diplomatic skills.
After dodging danger in Vietnam, logging long hours to make their superiors look good and maneuvering to reach the military's top echelons, they have emerged as the leading candidates to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Tuesday's dinner is the ultimate high-pressure dinner with the boss -- with every rival there, too.

Sports of the Times; History Is on the Side Of the Veteran Pitcher
THE last time the Yankees had hopes of winning the American League East, Jimmy Key was barely past apprenticeship as a starter for the Toronto Blue Jays.
Jim Abbott?
He was matriculating at the University of Michigan.
And Melido Perez was low in the Royals' minor league system, commanding little notice for anything other than the fact that he was the little brother of the flamboyant pitcher Pascual Perez.
The year was 1985 and the present-day trio of pitchers was still years away from being a focal point of any division title hopes held by the Yankees.
The cast has changed since then, of course, with 1985 hurlers like Ron Guidry and Phil Niekro well into working through their five-year Hall of Fame waiting periods.


1,000 Rooms Sealed in Tests For Asbestos
Custodians finished sealing off 1,000 classrooms that may harbor asbestos and inspectors completed a survey of 39 heavily damaged schools where summer classes are under way as New York City's crash program to remove the cancer-causing material from the nation's largest school system went into high gear yesterday.
As a small army of experts worked around the clock to assay the most urgent dangers, the Board of Education and an oversight committee appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins met separately to monitor progress and ponder costs and ways of insuring the safety of a million students and staff members by September.

Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska cast the vote that tipped the balance for President Clinton's budget bill, but Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine worked for weeks so there was a balance to be tipped.
Mr.
Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, irritated other Congressional leaders, especially Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, as he kept pushing for ways to tinker with the bill.
He would bring along one senator by proposing an increase in something while keeping another in the fold by urging that a cut be restored.

To the Editor:
Re "Just Say No to Clinton's Package" by Ronald Reagan (Op-Ed, Aug. 3): I find it appalling that the man who got us into the deficit nightmare derides the first efforts to do something about it.
While no one, including President Clinton, thinks the final budget proposal is a panacea, it is a step to quell the hemorrhaging embraced by Ronald Reagan and his ilk as they robbed from the future to pay for what was mostly defense toys.

New York's Fiscal Forecast: Cloudy
New York City's budget for the current year is still teetering, according to fiscal watchdogs who monitor the city's finances for the state.
In its midsummer review, the Financial Control Board's staff acknowledged that Mayor David Dinkins and the City Council had made "significant" fixes in the past two months, but said more must be done to make sure the budget balances at the end of the fiscal year next June 30.
Not surprisingly in an election year, the Mayor said the board's new estimates were wrong, and that this year's $31 billion budget will be balanced.
But that's also what he said in June, before another watchdog -- the Standard &amp; Poor's bond-rating agency -- forced him to announce in early July that he would make more cuts.


Gilliam's Second Chance
JOE GILLIAM JR., a Super Bowl champion with the Pittsburgh Steelers and then an outcast over drug abuse, hopes he has found his way back to success, even though he knows he will never live down his past.
"No matter how long I live or where I go or what I do, that's the way it's going to be," Gilliam told The Jackson Sun in an article published yesterday.
"I'm not bitter about it. It's just one of those things I'm going to have to deal with for the rest of my life."

Egyptian Official Slain By Suspected Militants
Gunmen shot and killed a senior police official and two of his aides in the southern province of Qena on Saturday night, security officials said today.
The official, Gen.

General Ghobara, deputy police chief of northern Qena, had only served in the post for five days.

Heart Problem Raises Issues for Giants' Roberts
The good news for the Giants was that their preseason victory against the Cincinnati Bengals Saturday night couldn't have gone better for them.
The intensity was great, quarterbacks Phil Simms and Kent Graham looked good and Lawrence Taylor appears to be fine.
Today, though, some of that good feeling was dampened because of two troubling factors: the heart problems of offensive lineman William Roberts that may sideline him for this weekend's game at least and torn ligaments in the left foot of Michael Strahan that will probably end his season.

A Marked Increase in Rabies Cases
Although the death of 11-year-old Kelly Ahrendt was the first fatal case of rabies exposure in almost 40 years in New York State, officials in the northeast region have been tracking a marked increase in rabies cases in the last three years.
Last year, New York State set a national record for the largest number of rabid animals ever reported, 1,761, and 1,088 people were treated for possible exposure to rabies.
In 1989, 81 people were treated for exposure.

Dvorak's Spirit Returns to the Iowa He Loved
One hundred summers ago, Antonin Dvorak arrived in this tiny Iowa town with the newly written "New World" Symphony under his arm.
After a bruising and exhilarating year as the director of the National Conservatory in New York, the Czech composer craved the society of his countrymen.
Dvorak's secretary, Josef Kovarik, convinced him that if he traveled not east across the ocean, but west to the rolling green hills of northeast Iowa, he would find the people he was looking for.
He did.
And Spillville is remembering Dvorak's three-month stay with a weekend of solemn Czech Masses, polka dances, kolaces, pilsener beer, parades, lectures, chamber music and -- oh yes -- the E-minor Symphony "From the New World" played by the Dubuque Symphony in the local high-school gymnasium.

Clinton's Gay Rights Foray May Miscarry; Landmark Asylum Case
To the Editor:
In a landmark decision this month, an immigration judge in San Francisco granted political asylum to a Brazilian gay man.
Citing numerous abuses by antigay death squad gangs, who are often joined by the police in their massacres of gays, the judge decided that homosexuality classifies as a social group, is immutable or a characteristic an asylum applicant should not be compelled to change.


Conservatives Dominate Japan's New Cabinet

In satisfying this disparate group he seems to have insured that any changes will be careful and slow.

Review/Jazz; Men With Horns Face Off, and Youth Is Served
About halfway through the first half of "Battle Royale: Trumpets and Tenors," it slowly became clear that something abnormal was happening.
The concert, at Alice Tully Hall on Friday night, was meant to bring together musicians and let them go at it, improvisation as a type of competition.
That's jazz convention; what happened entirely surpassed the standard excitement of a cutting contest.
The first half of the show, featuring the younger, lesser-known tenor saxophonists Don Braden and Josh Redman, along with the veteran saxophonists George Coleman and David Murray, brought out such a high level of improvisation by the musicians -- and such a definitive division between those who came to play and those who either didn't or couldn't -- that it felt as if history were being made.


Spinning Round Wins The Ballerina Stakes
George Steinbrenner, basking in the success of his New York Yankees, took a side trip to Saratoga Race Course today and hit a home run of his own when his filly Spinning Round won the Ballerina Stakes over the favored November Snow before a record Saratoga crowd of 53,574.
It was a rave performance by Spinning Round, who has run in the money 20 times in 27 starts but who lost 9 of her last 10 races before taking the lead today and holding it the entire route.
She also delivered a resounding payoff to her supporters: $25.20 for every $2 bet on her to win.

Change Worries Kodak's Hometown
After more than a century of basking in the generosity of the Eastman Kodak Company, this metropolitan region of 700,000 people near Lake Ontario -- one of the nations' largest centers of manufacturing and exports -- is facing a future where the cozy relationship of company and community will be challenged by the more tight-fisted values of Wall Street.
On Friday, Kodak's board announced that it had ousted the chief executive, Kay R. Whitmore, a 35-year employee, and said it was planning to bring in an outsider to run the company.
The news came as a shock to community leaders and residents.
It also raised questions here about the future of the region's largest and perhaps most paternalistic employer and longtime community benefactor.

China Says U.S. Is Harassing Ship Suspected of Taking Arms to Iran
In a dispute likely to create new strains between China and the United States, Beijing accused Washington today of harassing a Chinese ship because of suspicions it is shipping chemical weapons materials to the Middle East.
The official New China News Agency indicated that Washington suspects Beijing of exporting raw ingredients used to make mustard gas and nerve gas.


As Coleman Knows, At Least It's a Start
Marvin Jones, the Jets' first-round draft pick, roamed aimlessly along the sidelines, looking like a guest at a party who knew no one except for the extremely busy host.
He didn't play against the Steelers in the first preseason game Saturday night because he hadn't signed his contract until the day before.
That was the good news for Keo Coleman, a linebacker who was drafted in the fourth round last season and is trying to earn a spot as a backup middle linebacker.
But Jones will practice this week and will probably play against the Eagles in the Jets' next preseason game, on Friday at Giants Stadium.

The Talk of The Telly; Few Mourn as BBC Soap Is Put Out of Its Misery
After one short year of life, the BBC's dinosaurian soap opera "Eldorado" gasped its last this summer and fell into welcome extinction.
Or at least Britain's rapacious television commentators seemed to feel its disappearance was welcome; they had mocked the poor beast unmercifully since it first lumbered to life.
A roundelay of romantic entanglements and low-life skulduggery set in an imaginary Spanish resort community, the series was everything that Anglophilic admirers of Masterpiece Theater think is foreign to British television: bloated, leaden, dull.
Worst of all, it committed the sin of sins for a soap: the characters weren't sexy, weren't appealing, weren't in any way suitable for fantastical self-projection by couch potatoes.
They weren't even ordinary enough to seem lifelike.
Money Couldn't Buy Love
The set alone, built in southern Spain, cost more than $3 million; the budget was five times that, making the show the most expensive independent production ever commissioned by the BBC.
The critics, especially in London's tabloid press, were merciless: "In its early days, 157 episodes ago, 'Eldorado' was almost treasurably bad," The Guardian wrote just before the final show on July 9.
"But then it began to improve. It became mediocre instead of dire." The audience watched elsewhere, with rarely more than a third of the projected 15 million people tuning in.
The Producer's Assessment
As it happens, "Eldorado" was meant, at least in part, to be a serious soap, and its producer, Verity Lambert, has been quoted to the effect that it failed not because it was bad but because it was too experimental.
Her credits, after all, include shows of just the sort that have given British television a good name in the United States: "Dr. Who," "Rumpole of the Bailey," "The Naked Civil Servant" and the like.
And the new head of drama for the BBC, Charles Denton, seems now to be aiming even lower, unashamedly courting the biggest possible audience.
"We are in direct competition with ITV for the mainstream popular audience," he told The Independent.
ITV stands for Independent Television.

Editorial Notebook; 'Rising Sun' Is Old Business
Asians in American movies are typically portrayed as comedians, geishas, villains or karate masters.

Mr.
Crichton's larger purpose is to present a dark vision of Japan's economic ambitions.
Read either as a thriller or a tract, the book portrays the Japanese as hard-edged exploiters of an increasingly vulnerable America.

Mattingly Salvage Pulls Yanks From Wreck
The game was looking like the culmination of a lost weekend.
The Yankees had already squandered leads of 4-1 in the seventh inning and 6-5 in the ninth.
But instead of losing their third straight game in the bottom of the ninth to the Twins, the Yankees appeared to be waiting until the 10th before succumbing today.
At least that would have been progress.
But the Yanks did more than that.
They salvaged their trip to Minnesota because Don Mattingly belted a two-run homer off Rick Aguilera in the 10th for an 8-6 victory over the Twins at the Metrodome.
After two nights of frustrating setbacks against the terrible Twins, Mattingly made sure the weekend would not be a total loss.

Traders and investors appear eager to buy the last of the quarterly 30-year bonds to be auctioned by the Treasury this week.
At the end of last week, the new issue was trading in the when-issued, or pre-auction, market at a yield of 6.45 percent.
That is 8 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, below the yield on the current 30-year bond, which ended trading at 6.53 percent on Friday.
Prices and yields move in opposite directions, so investors were willing to pay a premium for the new issue.

Clinton's Gay Rights Foray May Miscarry
To the Editor:
President Clinton has been widely congratulated for taking a small but valuable first step toward equality for gays and lesbians in the military.
It has been less recognized that this first step is also likely to be a last step.
If, as expected, the new regulations are cemented into law, any future reforms can be blocked by a right-wing filibuster, an obstacle that is likely to prove, for the foreseeable future, insurmountable.

Young Catholics Questioning Their Identity in the Church
The arrival of Pope John Paul II here on Thursday for World Youth Day comes at a time when many young Roman Catholics are struggling with a question whose answer their parents found as obvious as fish dinner on Fridays and rooting for Notre Dame: What does it mean to be a Catholic today?
A generation removed from Latin Masses and meatless Fridays, young Catholics are typically unfamiliar with the rites of confession, praying the rosary or observing the stations of the cross.

Review/Opera; Seekers of the Unusual Find It Twice at Santa Fe
A visitor to the Santa Fe Opera has to admire the delicacy with which the company's season is balanced.
Of its five productions, only "The Magic Flute" and "La Boheme" can be heard anywhere, anytime.
The double bill of Kurt Weill rarities is guaranteed to lure specialists and the adventurous.
But in some ways Handel's "Xerxes" and Strauss's "Capriccio" are the season's most alluring offerings.
Because neither is frequently staged, they appeal to seekers of the unusual.
As sheer entertainment, both offer abundant charms.
And Santa Fe has assembled its starriest casts of the summer for them.
The Handel, on Thursday evening, was also Frederica von Stade's return to the stage after strained vocal cords forced her to cancel several performances this summer.
Miss von Stade was in generally good voice, and if there were traces of huskiness in her middle and lower registers, the top of her voice was as pure and smooth as ever.


Treasury Plans to Auction New Bills, Notes and Bonds
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week will be confined to the bond and note markets, beginning with the regular weekly auction today of new three- and six-month bills.
On Tuesday, the Government will auction three-year notes, followed by Wednesday's auction of 10-year notes and Thursday's auction of 30-year bonds.
According to traders, by the close of the New York cash market on Friday, the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 3.02 percent and the rate on a six-month bill was 3.18 percent.
In when-issued trading, the three-year notes were being offered at a rate to yield 4.49 percent, 10-year notes were at 5.80 percent and 30-year bonds were at 6.45 percent.

Now, two decades after the major supermarket chains abandoned largely black neighborhoods, consigning their shoppers to smaller, more expensive groceries, the church coalition appears to have succeeded.

Jerkens Is Master of Mystery at Track
Every morning just before 6 o'clock, the mystery man of racing drives into the stable gate at Saratoga Race Course, rolls down the hill through the short tunnel beneath the exercise track and turns right into his blue heaven: a park-like compound with tall trees and a stately barn filled with star horses.
In fact, no barn at the 126-year-old race track holds more star horses.
And on every weekend during the five-week Saratoga season, one of the stars will be racing in a Grade I stakes and will probably be the favorite to win it for Harry Allen Jerkens, the intense but impassive 64-year-old trainer who has 25 horses for eight owners in his barn and who is holding more aces than anybody else at Saratoga.


Revenue Losses Feared as Court Backs Out-of-State Lottery Sales

Ever since New York, New Jersey and other states began turning to lotteries as an alternative means of raising revenues, each has been able to run its games with unquestioned control and with little competition from other states' games.

Imagine how shocked some in the financial services industry were, then, to learn last week that a tiny company in Fairfax, Va., had received what appears to be an enormously broad patent covering financial transactions conducted from home computer terminals.

Owners Refinancing Homes To Cut Debt, Not Payments
When Patricia Fox realized that lower interest rates would allow her to pay off the mortgage on her three-bedroom ranch house in Brookhaven, L.I., in 15 years instead of 30, with only a $100 increase in her payments, she leaped at the opportunity.
Confounding the expectations of some economists, a growing number of people like Ms.
Fox are taking advantage of low interest rates and refinancing their houses not to cut their payments but to pay off their debts faster, thus building equity and cutting their anticipated interest costs, often by tens of thousands of dollars.

Television; CBS Pushes Its Affiliates To Toe Line on Letterman
The David Letterman-Jay Leno confrontation starts on the air three weeks from tonight, but an equally important battle has raged behind the cameras since the day CBS announced it had lured the late-night star away from NBC.
The skirmish, surprisingly, has been between CBS and some of its own affiliates.
This contest is about clearances -- commitments from affiliates that they will carry the network's new late-night show, "Late Show With David Letterman." It's not that the reluctant affiliates dislike Mr.
Letterman's show.
In fact, many CBS station managers are enthused at the prospect of having Mr.
Letterman on the network.
But some CBS stations have balked because they can make more money by broadcasting syndicated shows or reruns.


Essay; Bosnia: NATO vs. The U.N.
For one glorious moment a week ago, it seemed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ministers in Brussels had finally agreed to get tough with Serbian leaders who had been jerking the world's diplomats around for the past two years, making a mockery of collective security.
Word came from Brussels NATO headquarters that a list of targets had been selected for air strikes to break the siege of Sarajevo and save the lives of its Muslim residents.
The targets were not just Serbian artillery positions in the hills pounding the populace, but fuel and ammo dumps, supply lines and bridges, and "those responsible Bosnian Serbs" -- meaning the contemptuous thugs with stars on their shoulders who have been directing mass murder with impunity.

U.S. Troops for a U.N. Army
President Clinton once urged creation of an American "rapid deployment force" of peacekeepers that would be on instant call to the United Nations.
He's settled for something less.
He won't commit a U.S. contingent to a U.N. standing army or earmark units for U.N. duty in advance.
Instead, some troops will train to be part-time peacekeepers and could serve under U.N. command on "a case-by-case basis." And Washington will beef up the U.N.'s scrawny peacekeeping headquarters with staff, equipment and a training center.
That's a step in the right direction, but Mr.
Clinton could go further.
It may be politically ill-advised to ask Congress to pre-commit U.S. forces.
But he could prudently order the Pentagon to designate one or two U.S.-based brigades to be used exclusively for peacekeeping contingencies and have them participate in joint exercises with peacekeepers from other nations.

Pitfalls for Investors in the New Tax Law; Steep Rise In Minimum Rate Costly
The new tax measure has good news for some real estate investors, but many other investors will find bad news in it.
The value of some municipal and corporate bonds may go down, but not nearly as much as if the bill had been passed a few years ago.
And investing in bankrupt companies will become even more hazardous than it was before.
While President Clinton emphasized that workers in families with incomes of less than $180,000 a year are unlikely to pay higher taxes, that is not true for many investors.
A variety of measures could wind up costing them money, even if they are not making really big bucks.

Review/Mime; A Festival Explores the Impact of a Great Teacher
Etienne Decroux, the great French mime teacher and performer, seems to have taught just about everyone active in mime today.
What he taught was not a style but a way of working deeply through the torso, arms and legs without recourse, necessarily, to narrative, character, props or even facial expression.
The variety of work produced by his students, who included Marcel Marceau, has been astonishing.
And that variety was the implicit theme of the International Movement Theater Festival of New Mime, whose presentation at three theaters in Philadelphia ended today.
For the festival, Griftheater of Amsterdam restaged "Sa Griffe," a recent piece drawn from Man Ray's "objects of affection" and created for a warehouse setting.
The hourlong piece sprawled across the polished floor of an elegant old church school gymnasium in a smooth-flowing series of scenes that took place in small, discrete universes scattered about the room.

Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska cast the vote that tipped the balance for President Clinton's budget bill, but Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine worked for weeks so there was a balance to be tipped.
Mr.

Federated vs. One of Its Own
The swift retaliation of Federated Department Stores Inc. against Roger N. Farah, the chairman of its merchandising office who planned to leave the company to take a senior position at R. H. Macy &amp; Company, caught the retail community by surprise over the weekend.
It also represented a setback for Macy's plans to install a chief merchant to reinvigorate its merchandising efforts.
The company has been operating the Macy's, I. Magnin and Bullock's department stores under the protection of Federal bankruptcy court.

Guido del Mestri, Cardinal, 82
Guido Cardinal del Mestri, a member of the Roman Curia, died on Monday in a clinic in Nuremberg, Germany, the Vatican has announced.
He was 82.
Cardinal del Mestri was a Vatican diplomat who became an archbishop in 1961.
He served as papal nuncio to West Germany from 1975 to 1984, before Pope John Paul II named him to the College of Cardinals in 1991.
In 1990 he journeyed to Bucharest and took part in the renewal of the Catholic Church there after the fall of Communism.
Earlier he had served as a diplomat in Rumania while it came under Communist rule.

As NATO Meets on Bosnia Plan, U.S. Won't Press for a Go-Ahead
The 16 NATO members are to meet in Brussels on Monday to approve military plans to prevent the Serbs from choking off Sarajevo and other Muslim enclaves in Bosnia, but United States officials said today that Washington would not press for an immediate decision to authorize military action.
With the Serbs promising to pull back from some crucial positions in the mountains around Sarajevo, with peace talks among the warring sides in Bosnia set to resume on Monday and with some European nations still reluctant to take military action, the United States wants to see what happens next before pushing for air strikes.


3 Palestinians Threaten to Resign From Talks in a Rift With Arafat

Arafat in Tunis, where the P.L.O. has its headquarters, said Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the head of the delegation.


An Education Dream Hits Reality
Just a year ago, Tennessee entrepreneur Christopher Whittle thought he had the answer to America's education woes.
He would build a huge network of for-profit schools that would become a model for public education.
And he would spend only as much per pupil as the average public school.
But major corporations he has wooed to invest in the project have said, "Not yet." They're looking for proof that this new educational program will work.
So Mr.
Whittle will try to start his model in a few floundering public schools and add private schools later.
That doesn't condemn the concept of for-profit schools.
It just confirms that education reform is a lot harder than it looks.

Late-Blooming Price Falls Short No More
For nearly a decade on the Professional Golfers' Association Tour, Nick Price was known as easygoing, mega-talented and too nice to know how good he was.
And as much as his fellow golfers liked him, they hoped he never found out.
Although he could strike the ball as purely as anyone, Price had the reputation of habitually falling just short.
It began when he gave Tom Watson a British Open in 1982 by squandering a three-stroke lead with seven holes to play, and took on added weight when Seve Ballesteros made everything in sight in the final round to nip him by a stroke at the 1988 British Open.

With few celebrated male lawyers around this year, a triumphal appearance by Justice-to-be Ruth Bader Ginsburg and quite possibly the bar group's first female president on the horizon, the A.B.A. convention now under way at a constellation of hotels in midtown Manhattan has been an affair to remember for women.

Staten Island Secession More Than Fringe Threat
The distance between SoHo and Staten Island is a short hike and a 50-cent ferry ride, but for Daniel Singletary, a New York artist who has lived on Staten Island for more than 20 years, the mental gap is meaner than the flooded Mississippi.
"I don't know how long I've been going in to the Manhattan art world but I'm still considered the Staten Island redneck artist," he said.
It rankles.
So, like a growing number of his neighbors, Mr.
Singletary wants to get out of town without ever leaving home: he wants Staten Island to secede.


Saltwater Fishing
Commercial fishing catches have increased 59 percent in area waters over the last five years, a change that is most likely cyclical, marine officials say.
In 1992 the area's largest commercial producer, New Jersey, ranked seventh in the nation.
The ranking rests largely on the catch of shellfish, which account for 55 percent of the total.
New Jersey's largest non-shellfish catch is of Menhaden, a common bait fish, at more than 27 million pounds in 1992.
In contrast, the area's recreational fishing harvest has declined, due partly to the region's sluggish economy and also since a Federal law went into effect limiting andlers to 10 bluefish (the most popular sporting fish on the East Coast) a day.
New York and Connecticut, but not New Jersey, extended the law to state waters, and New York's recreational catch fell by about 50 percent from 1992 to 1992.

A huge serve and overhead smash gave Krajicek a 5-3 lead.
Down match point at 6-5, Chang hit a down-the-line backhand that was just wide. (AP)

A Plan to Encourage News Corrections
Journalists do not like to write corrections.
Sometimes that's because they haven't made mistakes.
But sometimes, as when someone asserts that he or she has been libeled, it is because a news organization is afraid of being sued if it admits an error.
The issue of when the press should correct itself -- and how much it might have to pay when it does -- grew more complex last week.
An influential national legal body, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, proposed a new law aimed at encouraging corrections and limiting libel suits.
The idea appears destined to ignite bitter battles in state legislatures as it is presented to them in the next few years.

The Heavy Hand of European Settlement
IT may be true, as some scientists have lately been saying, that the America encountered by the first European settlers was no primeval Eden, and that pre-Columbian Indians shaped, reshaped and sometimes degraded the landscape and ecology of the continent much as modern people do.
But while the original Americans did change their environment, new studies of ancient and present-day ecosystems have found that since European settlement the vegetation of North America has undergone a radical and continuing transformation unlike anything seen in thousands of years -- even in some areas commonly thought of as wilderness today.

At Edge Of Beach, 2 Theories At Odds
SCIENTISTS who created artificial beaches in a computer have produced startling new findings about one of the most puzzling features of coastal geology: the evenly spaced, crescent-shaped undulations that form as if by magic along many coastlines.
Though they can be subtle enough to escape the notice of bathers splashing in the surf, these beach cusps have long fascinated scientists, who have yet to figure out for sure exactly how they form.
Cusps occur on all kinds of beaches, from stretches of gravel exposed to the ocean's wrath to sheltered expanses of fine-grained sand.
Individual cusps can be anywhere from a few inches to 50 yards apart.

Inspectors who began on Saturday to collect samples of wall plaster and other materials had worked their way through only 21 schools by yesterday morning, and the unexpected extent of wall damage they found in most buildings will force them to return for more samples, the officials said.

The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond shattered the 6.50 percent level yesterday, falling to 6.46 percent, as the bond market rallied across the board.
But the rally, traders and analysts said, was not necessarily a positive response to Congressional approval of President Clinton's deficit reduction plan late Friday.
Rather, the rally resulted from a host of factors, including the fact that the 30-year bond seemed to take on a life of its own, an indication that its spectacular performance was not a reflection of overall market sentiment.

CLINTON DOUBLING FEES FOR GRAZING ON FEDERAL LANDS
Returning to an issue set aside when it appeared to threaten the budget negotiations, the Clinton Administration announced today that it would more than double grazing fees for ranchers who use Federal land.

Environmentalists heralded the action and predicted it would reduce harm to wildlife, forests and streams that they say is caused by grazing on public land.


Review/Theater; Singing, Dancing, a Bark or Two
No sooner does 9-year-old Kathryn Zaremba sing her first note in "Annie Warbucks," the long-labored-over musical that opened at the Variety Arts Theater last night, than the audience erupts into relieved, gratified chuckles.
Ms.
Zaremba, who plays the show's titular heroine, is very small, even for a 9-year-old, but her voice, which is pitched somewhere between a bugle and a gym teacher's whistle, is enormous.
Never mind that her diction sometimes suggests that her cheeks have been stuffed with M&amp;M's.
The kid can belt, and she seems as un-self-conscious as a kitten.
In the old-fashioned American musical, which is what "Annie Warbucks" frankly aspires to be, big voices out of little bodies are held dear, representing a combination of naivete and aggression that is at the very heart of the form.
Innocence at high volume was, after all, what put over the original "Annie" -- the 1977 Broadway blockbuster inspired by the long-running comic strip "Little Orphan Annie" -- to which this production is a sequel.
"Annie" was audaciously anachronistic, and after a decade of musical theater dominated by the chillier charm of Sondheim, audiences lapped up its brazen sentimentality.

In its two-month rampage, the great Midwest flood of 1993 cut an awesome destructive swath.
It took 50 lives, left almost 70,000 people homeless, inundated an area twice the size of New Jersey, caused an estimated $12 billion in property and agricultural damage and stirred anew a debate over the nation's flood-control system and its policies.
The crest of the mighty flood, probably the worst ever to wash over the United States, roiled down the Mississippi past Cairo, Ill., today, and from there south the swollen waters will steadily lose their deadly potency because the river bottom widens drastically.

Eastman Kodak officials say they have no plans to sell Kodak's Sterling Winthrop drug unit, but analysts who follow the international pharmaceutical business are betting that Sterling will be sold.
And they predict the buyer will be Elf Sanofi S.A., a French company, which is already a Sterling partner.

Doctor Clears Roberts But Orders More Testing
Giants offensive lineman William Roberts has been released from the hospital and cleared to play football again after suffering a third episode of atrial fibrillation, or rapid heartbeat.
But he will miss at least two weeks for further tests to make sure that football is not putting his life in jeopardy.
Roberts left New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center this afternoon, two days after he left New York's game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Saturday night complaining of light-headedness.
It was later determined that Roberts had suffered another case of atrial fibrillation, his third in two years, this time triggered by over-the-counter medication Roberts had taken earlier in the week for a chest cold.


Continental Airlines Switches Agencies
Continental Airlines yesterday dismissed Wells Rich Greene BDDP, its agency since March 1990, and moved its estimated $40 million United States account, without a review, to the Richards Group in Dallas.
"I was hired to bring a new direction to the airline's marketing approach," said Donald G. Valentine, who joined Continental two months ago as the senior vice president of marketing and sales.
He praised Richards for producing advertising that "sticks to the roof of your brain."

Morals Can Restore Self-Respect to Youth
To the Editor:
The reasoning in your July 31 editorial endorsing Dr.
Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General of the United States is appalling.
In citing the woeful statistics on teen-age pregnancy, AIDS and other venereal diseases, you say, "For all such ills the best prescription is straight, strong, honest talk about the sexual precociousness of America's adolescents, and the necessity for all Americans to know how to protect themselves against unplanned pregnancy and disease." Nowhere in the whole editorial do you mention morals.

Baghdad Journal; In Iraq, a 'One-Man Show' Acquires New Meaning
He comes in military uniform, naturally, or in a blue, brown, green or gray suit with matching breast pocket handkerchief.
But you could also choose a picture of him sipping tea with gaily dressed Kurdish women amid snowy mountains, or talking to veiled Shiite Muslim women in the reeds of the southern marshes.
You can have him praying, too.
To mark the 25th anniversary in July of the coup that brought President Saddam Hussein's Baathist Party to power in Iraq, an exhibition of more than 40 new larger-than-life portraits of the leader, each 9 by 6 feet, has opened here in the Saddam Art Center.


Taos Journal; In Defense of a Hero of the Old West
One hundred and twenty-five years after his death, Kit Carson, the legendary scout and frontiersman of the Old West, is still a big man here.
A national forest outside town is named after him, and his home and grave site are popular tourist attractions.
So the idea that Carson's reputation needs rehabilitating may sound odd, but that is just what the people who run the Kit Carson Historic Museum are trying to do.
On July 31 they held a symposium called "Kit Carson: Indian Fighter or Indian Killer?" to defend his honor.


Facing the Price of a Home Computer
WITH varying degrees of enthusiasm, parents and children are preparing to begin a new school year.
For many people this is the time to shop for a home computer and educational software.
Buying a computer can be nerve-racking for the beginner.
Even though prices have plummeted in the last two years, personal computers still represent a substantial investment.
What if you choose the wrong type of computer?
What features are important and which are frills?
What if you can't figure out how to use it?
What if the kids get bored with it?
Do you really need a computer, or are you being manipulated by the education-technology complex?


Pope, on Way to U.S., Avoids Criticism on Bosnia
Embarking on a trip that will take him to his first encounter with President Clinton, Pope John Paul II sounded conciliatory tones toward American policy in Bosnia and Somalia today but offered no hint of compromise on what American Catholics regard as such key issues as abortion.
The Pope set out his views in a brief meeting with reporters aboard the plane carrying him here from Rome.
He is to visit Jamaica and Mexico before traveling to Denver to join celebrations of World Youth Day this week and meet with Mr.
Clinton.
The trip is the 60th of his papacy.

But if the hoax was meant to harass the judge, Acting Justice Elliott Wilk of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, it hit somewhat shy of the mark.
Justice Wilk, who presided over the recent custody battle between Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, is on vacation this week, and it was an aide who was burdened by the deceit.

The School Asbestos Scandal
After 14 years of supposedly monitoring and eliminating asbestos hazards in city schools, New York's Board of Education now finds itself compelled to conduct a hurried reinspection of all 1,000 school buildings to make them safe for the coming year.
The emerging scandal is a monument to astounding incompetence by school officials and their asbestos monitoring contractor.
Students and workers in some schools may already have been exposed to risky doses of asbestos because of botched inspections and lax oversight.
The reinspections should help bring that problem under control.
But investigators need to complete their inquiry into how this fiasco happened as quickly as possible and determine if there was any criminal activity.
The findings may decide whether parents, students, teachers and the public can have any confidence that the school system is being run competently.

When the Olympics are out of session, we Americans dine on a sparse diet of televised track and field and other summer events (save gymnastics, which we get in mass quantities).

With Budget Won, Sales Pitch Begins
President Clinton opened a drive yesterday to convince the American public of what he narrowly managed to convince Congress last week: that his $496 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases was worthy of its support.
The White House billed the President's visit to West Virginia as a victory lap to celebrate Congressional approval of his five-year economic plan.
But his campaign-style rally reflected the Administration's view that though the plan had passed, it remained to be sold.

Meteors to Put On a Rare Show
MIGHTY storm or heavy shower, but certainly no drizzle.
That's the astronomical forecast for tomorrow evening, when the night sky will come alive with flashes of light from the Perseid meteors.
The Old Faithful of meteor showers is expected to be spectacular this year because a passing comet recently recharged the river of debris that the Earth crosses to produce this annual extravaganza of "shooting stars."
The Perseids (pronounced PUR-see-ids) are so named because they appear to radiate from a point near the constellation Perseus, which is near Cassiopeia, the easily recognized "W"-shaped constellation.
Perseus was the son of Zeus in Greek mythology.

Back to Basics in Somalia
Four Americans died in Somalia on Sunday -- the first U.S. combat deaths since the U.N. took command of peacekeeping operations there in May.
It's a painful moment, sure to bring calls to withdraw the 4,000 remaining U.S. troops.
But a more constructive response would be for Washington to insist that the operation return quickly to its original goals: humanitarian relief, political reconciliation and rebuilding a functional government.
President Clinton has pledged to find out who was responsible for the blast that killed the soldiers as their Humvee traveled down a Mogadishu street, and then "take appropriate action," through the U.N., to protect American troops.
Well and good.

Earlier in the season, when the Yankees were lucky to attract 24,000 people, Mr.
Steinbrenner said the fault lay with the stadium, not his team.
Fans wouldn't brave the indignities of the Bronx, he argued.

Chess
A selection of the world's top young women in chess defeated a group of senior men in a match in late June in Vienna.
They thus got revenge for their defeat in the first match of this kind last year, which took place on Aruba in the Caribbean.
The winning team was composed of the former women's world champion, Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia, who was high scorer with 9-3; Zsuzsa Polgar of Hungary; Xie Jun of China, the current women's world champion; Zsofia Polgar of Hungary; Ketevan Arakhamia of Georgia; Alisa Gallyamova of Ukraine.

Market Place; A Pestilence in the Vineyard Is a Plague on Mondavi Stock.
WHEN a premier Wall Street investment bank brings a new offering public to a frothy market, elbows start flying as investors scramble to scoop up shares.
After all, a top firm's reputation alone can help push up an offering's stock price, giving a quick and tidy profit to the lucky few who snagged shares.
But not always.
Investors in the initial public offering in June of the Robert Mondavi Corporation, the California premium winemaker, sure aren't popping any champagne corks these days.
And the offering's poor performance is all the more embarrassing because it was brought public by one of the bluest of Wall Street blue chips, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.

Rent Subsidy Moves Homeless Out of Hotels
To the Editor:
A July 26 news article decries the exorbitant cost of keeping a homeless family in a shelter or welfare hotel, instead of using that money for permanent housing.
How can New York City and New York State offer a homeless mother of two only $286 as rent allowance for permanent housing, but continue to pay upward of $3,000 a month to put that family in a badly run welfare hotel miles from where that family can receive real help?
There seems to be a lack of clear thinking among those who have allowed this practice to continue.

Tax Credit for Poor Is Widely Abused
To the Editor:
Re "Expansion of Aid for Working Poor Is Tied to Budget" (front page, July 26): Having prepared about 500 tax returns in an H.&amp; R. Block office in New York City's Washington Heights section last tax season, I am under the impression that the earned-income tax credit is the most abused part of the tax system.


Prehistoric Climate
Scientists excavating a disused gravel quarry in Oxfordshire, England, have uncovered a giant graveyard of prehistoric mammoths and other animals.
The remains, rare in their diversity and superb state of preservation, hold clues to the region's climate 220,000 years ago.
Dr.
Katharine Scott, a paleontologist at the Donald Baden-Powell Quaternary Research Center at Oxford University, said her team had found the remains of more than 150 different species, including 14 complete mammoth tusks, the bones and teeth of bison, and vegetation.


Subaru Lays Off 17.5% of Jobs in U.S.
Bowing to cost-cutting pressures and cutthroat competition in the United States automotive market, Subaru of America today eliminated 144 jobs, or 17.5 percent, from its American work force of 823 employees.
The company, a subsidiary of Fuji Heavy Industries in Tokyo, said that workers had been notified today that the cutback was effective immediately and that it mostly affected workers at the company's headquarters in Cherry Hill, N.J.

It became Mattingly's first taste of the Yankee-Red Sox rivalry.

Tax-Tardy C.P.A.'s and Lawyers Under Gun
An investigation by the Internal Revenue Service has some high-powered lawyers looking to hire some high-powered lawyers.
And some accountants are sharpening their pencils to take care of their own -- tardy -- tax returns.
District offices in New York, Chicago and Pittsburgh have begun efforts to track down lawyers and accountants who have failed to file tax returns, The Washington Post reported yesterday.
Since last fall, the I.R.S. has been on a campaign to get lapsed taxpayers to own up.
The recent local effort to crack down on professionals is a matter of district offices taking the campaign an extra step, said Frank Keith, a spokesman for the I.R.S.


Serbs Make a Gesture at Sarajevo, Then Dig In Heels
A melancholy smile spread across the face of a sodden Bosnian soldier standing in a forest clearing on Mount Igman today.

Bridge
The prophets at the World Junior Team Championships in Arhus, Denmark, are expecting a Europe-America final, and after nine rounds they appeared to be right: The United States No. 1 team was in the lead, followed by Norway, Germany and Denmark.
However, Australia, in fifth position, may upset the calculations when the 15th and final qualifying round is completed.
Murray Green of Australia was cited for the best-played hand on the second day.
It is shown in the diagram, and he and his partner were using a fancy system in which a one-diamond opening was artificial, guaranteeing at least four spades.
East stepped in with a take-out double, a doubtful action that served to give significant information to South.

Review/Music; Mozart, Paired With Tchaikovsky
The Mostly Mozart Festival hit on a workable theme this week, examining Mozart's influence on Tchaikovsky, but many people in the audience at Avery Fisher Hall last Tuesday evening were having none of it.
Tchaikovsky pronounced Mozart's works "the highest, most perfect culmination ever attained by beauty in the realm of music." Michael Lankester, in his preconcert lecture, cited other evidence of Tchaikovsky's near-idolatry of Mozart and used a piano to show instances of the resulting influence.
The concert itself, conducted by Neeme Jarvi, capped a steady stream of Mozart -- Two Minuets With Contredanses (K. 463), Six German Dances (K. 509) and two concertos -- with Tchaikovsky's Orchestral Suite No. 4, "Mozartiana."


Review/Music; Classic Improvisation (As in Quick Thinking)
The final concert of the 53d season of the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival, this evening, was enjoyable and at times sensational on its own terms.
Still, it could only be anticlimactic after the bizarre and wonderful events of the night before.
On Friday evening, the Cleveland Quartet was to have played a standard program of Haydn and Brahms quartets, separated by a small novelty: the premiere of Joan Tower's seven-minute "Elegy" for trombone and string quartet, a work commissioned by the festival for its trombonist John Swallow.
For reasons that would become clear only later, the concert began almost 25 minutes after the scheduled 8:30 start, and the order was changed to put the Tower first.
Thus began a wild ride.

Swept Apart by Sickness, Kept Apart by War; A 3-Year-Old's Plea to Be United With His Mother Is Tangled in a Diplomatic Thicket
Mirza Smailbegovic is a 3 1/2-year-old boy who wants his mother.
Often, after a mixture of potent drugs drips through a tube surgically implanted in his chest, he is overcome by nausea and asks the nurse, doctor or social worker at his bedside, "Where's my mama?"
The answer is hard for him to understand.
His mother, Amra, is far away, in the Bosnian village of Breza, where he was born.
She wants to fly to him, her only son, and help him through his excruciating treatment for leukemia at New York University Medical Center.
But a war has engulfed their country, and she is trapped within its borders.
Only Mirza's grandfather made it to the United States with him.


RESULTS PLUS
TRACK AND FIELD  Powell's Streak Intact  The long jump world-record holder, Mike Powell, leaped 27 feet 10 inches yesterday in the last round at the Malmo Invitational Grand Prix track and field meet in Sweden.
It was Powell's 22d straight victory since the Barcelona Olympics last summer.
Earlier this summer, Powell won the United States championship with a mark of 28-1 1/2.
Powell failed to jump 8 meters, or 26-3, in the first two rounds yesterday, but gradually produced longer and longer jumps, despite a drizzle.
"In a way I miss Carl Lewis. I'm a man looking for challenges, which he gives me," Powell was quoted as saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
Lewis won the Olympic long jump.
Powell's countrymen, Dennis Mitchell and Kevin Braunskill, won the 100- and 200-meter races.
Mitchell, an Olympic bronze medalist last year, was coming off an injury.
He was clocked at 10.22 seconds in his only tuneup for the world track and field championships in Stuttgart, Germany, which begin Saturday.
Braunskill's time was 20.61 seconds. (AP)

When Memory And Frill Collide
ALTHOUGH it is an old song, "Thanks for the Memory" is still the favorite theme of personal computer fans, particularly those who have resisted moving to Windows or who have made only a partial changeover.
Two columns last month about QEMM 7.01, Quarterdeck's new version of an old standard among memory managers, brought in spirited responses from both readers and software publishers.
It was mentioned that QEMM and a screen saver, Razzle Dazzle, did not coexist.
A company expert in the Quarterdeck Forum in Compuserve, who had earlier suggested changes to deal with this, noted later: "You will probably find that some screen savers will interfere with system functions that are more important. However, a lot of our users have After Dark, and that seems to work fine." This avoided answering the question of what system function could possibly be more important than a neat screen saver.
Then Road Scholar, the publisher of Razzle Dazzle, sent word that an updated version of the screen saver would work with the new QEMM.
Meanwhile, a reader, Dick Netzer, senior fellow and professor of economics and public administration at New York University, wrote of version 6.0: "QEMM fights fiercely with Pyro," a screen saver, "and occasionally fights with Sidekick."


Moon's Thin Atmosphere Extends 5,000 Miles
ALTHOUGH scientists demonstrated earlier this century that the Moon has a thin atmosphere, its extent was a matter of speculation until two researchers at Boston University developed images of the sodium gas enveloping the Moon.
The researchers, Dr.
Michael Mendillo, a professor of astronomy, and Brian Flynn, a doctoral candidate, used a wide-angle four-inch telescope coupled with a sensitive light detector to map the distribution of sodium gas in the lunar atmosphere.
In a report in a recent issue of the journal Science, they say the atmosphere extends at least 5,000 miles above the lunar surface.

Review/Television; The Self-Realization of Gayness
No conclusive answer to the title question, "Why Am I Gay?," is provided by these "Stories of Coming Out in America." But the profiles of four homosexuals -- three men and a woman -- leave a strong impression that they had little to say about it.
All tell of their childhood confusion and distress when, as Edgar, a Bronx police sergeant, recalls, "I didn't think there was anybody in the whole world like me." Michael, a member of the Flirtations -- advertised as "the world's most famous openly gay, politically aware a cappella doo-wop singing group" -- is reminded on a visit back to the Midwest of the growing-up miseries of being picked on as a sissy.
Susanne, a 46-year-old divorced woman, says she never wanted to be different but found herself strongly drawn to her own sex.

NATO Allies Settle on Procedures For Air Strikes on Serbs in Bosnia
The NATO allies approved procedures and targets today for air strikes against Bosnian Serb nationalist forces if they kept up their strangulation of Sarajevo.
But they put off a specific bombing decision and confirmed that such missions would not begin without specific approval by the Secretary General of the United Nations.
NATO airplanes and coordination procedures with United Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina are already in place.
The actual decision to launch attacks would depend on additional judgments -- that the Serbs were tightening the noose around Sarajevo and other besieged areas, and then only after all 16 allies met here again to approve.

His clothes appealed to the anti-establishment young as well as to more traditional women.
"My mother wore a Burrows to my bar mitzvah," Michael Kors, the designer, recalled recently.

New York May Try Concrete to Combat Gulls at a Reservoir
How do you keep well-fed gulls swimming in your drinking water from doing what gulls do?
Other cities have covered their reservoirs with plastic, in the equivalent of a tent.
But this is New York, and so city officials are drafting plans for concrete, the equivalent of a pyramid.
When investigators traced an outbreak of bacteria in city tap water to gulls at the Hillview reservoir in Yonkers this month, city officials said the problem was temporary because they had plans to cover the reservoir with a concrete deck topped with a reflecting pool.


Budget Cutters Discover Easy Target in Medicare
As one of the largest and fastest-growing Federal programs and one bearing the dreaded "entitlement" label at that, Medicare, which covers health care for the elderly, presented budget cutters with a plump target.
And not surprisingly it took the biggest single hit, apart from the military, as Congress and the President wrapped up the new five-year economic plan last week.
Money for Medicare from 1994 through 1998 was trimmed by $56 billion, a 6 percent cut from the previously projected total of $971 billion.
Another $8 billion was pared from Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, a 1 percent cut from $592 billion.

Rosalind Fidelman, a retired bookkeeper in East Northport, L.I., calls cereal prices "disgraceful," bristling at the ever-higher prices she sees posted on grocery store shelves.
The latest advance came last week, when the Kellogg Company, the market leader, wrote retailers that it was raising prices 2.1 percent, the company's third increase of the year.
And Mrs.
Fidelman is not alone.
Robert Abrams, the New York State Attorney General, sued in February to block Kraft's $450 million acquisition of RJR Nabisco's cold cereals.
"These soaring price increases, far out of line with other food products, are a clear result of an overconcentrated industry," he said.

Review/Rock; The Barrage Method of Tweaking Taboos
Garage-band riffs, pounding drums, flashing lights, random film clips and a general air of frenzied decadence have made the Butthole Surfers an alternative-rock staple.
At Roseland last Tuesday night, in a sold-out triple bill with Stone Temple Pilots and Flaming Lips, the band trotted out its dependable act.
A decade of touring has turned into a routine, with Gibby Haynes's growled, rasped, distorted vocals, Paul Leary's acid-rock guitar, a selection of surgical-instruction and ethnographic films, and a finale in which Mr.
Haynes sets a cymbal afire with lighter fluid and hits it with a drumstick to send flames aloft.
The band's name, printable but outrageous, promises taboo-tweaking titillation, while its lyrics growl about party-hearty apathy and bodily decay, controlled wildness that's perfect for the collegiate circuit.
After making 11 albums and EP's for independent labels, with titles like "Locust Abortion Technician" and "Hairway to Steven," the Surfers, who are based in Austin, Tex., recently released "Independent Worm Saloon" on the Capitol label, showing how the rock mainstream has expanded toward the noisier fringes.

Senatorial Disruption in New Jersey
In only six states can a state senator veto nominations by the governor.
The power is traditional, not statutory.
In New Jersey -- one of the six -- a senator's objection to the reappointment of a Superior Court judge shows how the power can be abused, and why it should be abolished.
The New Jersey case involves the pending reappointment of Marianne Espinosa Murphy, who sits on family cases and is known for being tough on "deadbeat dads" who welsh on child support.
Her seven-year term expires next month; Senate confirmation of her reappointment would give her tenure.
Senator John Dorsey, the Republican majority leader, stands in her way by invoking "senatorial courtesy." She sits in his home county.

The use of the telephone number -- 1-800-DINKINS -- represents the first time in a New York City campaign that a candidate has set up a toll-free number to solicit contributions and volunteers, a tactic that first came to broad prominence last year when it was used by Edmund G.

The rock critic Dave Marsh writes about the song, its impact and the history of rock-and-roll in his new book, "Louie Louie" (Hyperion), whose subtitle seems about as long as the song itself: "The History and Mythology of the World's Most Famous Rock 'n' Roll Song; Including the Full Details of Its Torture and Persecution at the Hands of the Kingsmen, J.

Where Arab Militants Train and Wait
For nearly a decade, this frontier city of densely packed mud houses skewered by narrow lanes, vast suburbs of pastel-hued homes and streets crowded with four-wheel drive vehicles and donkey carts, was home to spies, military planners, guerrilla commanders and would-be political leaders, all intent on driving out the Soviet Army.
But it became, as well, the home, and gateway to Afghanistan, for thousands of fervent Islamic warriors from Libya, from Iraq, from Egypt, from the Sudan.
And among the ranks of these, according to Western intelligence officials and United States law enforcement officials, came some of the men, and much of the inspiration, for the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in February and for a second bombing conspiracy broken up in New York in June.

Their straightforward descriptions are in contrast to the visual pretensions and theoretical mishmash that fill much of the rest of this 90-minute Canadian documentary, which was shown on Cinemax last year.
Most of it is devoted not to illnesses associated with food, but to the more general question of why so many women can't stand being fat.
Starting with the proposition that an obsession with thinness prevails in North America -- where 5-foot-4-inch, 140-pound women dream of being 5-10 and 110 pounds -- the program serves up a miscellany of purportedly expert opinions on why this is so, from the points of view of a Jungian psychoanalyst, a professor of women's studies and assorted psychologists.

Jersey Shore Beach Food: Just a Summer Love?
NEW JERSEY may be famous for its tomatoes, but when summer is over, they may not be the food vacationers remember best.
Just as Maine has its lobsters, and New Orleans its jambalaya, the Jersey Shore has its beach food.
Certain towns have become famous for certain specialties: Beach Haven for elephant ears, Atlantic City for saltwater taffy, Ocean City for pork roll, Seaside Heights for frozen custard and Long Branch for hot dogs.


U.N. Needs to Act On Rights of Women
To the Editor:
A.
M.
Rosenthal errs in his July 27 column, which denounces female genital mutilation as "the world's most widespread form of torture." He complains no one is speaking up about it, yet countless women's groups raised the issue at the United Nations human rights conference in Vienna last June and at the United Nations Commission on Women meeting in Geneva last spring.

YACHT RACING  Spain Edges U.S.
The Spanish yacht, Galicia 93 Pescanova, beat Dennis Conner's round-the-world racer, Winston, to the finish line yesterday in the British Fastnet Race.
By arriving in Plymouth, England at 12:57 A.M., New York time, Galicia was a half-hour ahead of Winston, and first to finish on elapsed time.
The 605-mile competition from Cowes, England, drew 243 sailboats in a finale to the 1993 Champagne Mumm Admiral's Cup series.
Galicia, skippered by Javier de la Gandara of Spain, is a sister ship to Winston.
Both are 60-foot sailboats.
Conner, who is competing elsewhere this week, was not on board Winston in the Fastnet.


U.S. Grants $13 Million More For I.B.M.'s Supercomputer
I.B.M.'s fledgling supercomputer business got a lift yesterday as two Federal agencies awarded a major grant to the Cornell Theory Center, a research proving ground for the powerful machines that are expected to replace mainframes some day.
The $13 million grant from the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Science Foundation will be used to buy and program an I.B.M. supercomputer with 512 processors, one of the most powerful machines in the world, and to train scientists to use it.


NEW RULES TIGHTEN ACCESS TO SHELTER IN NEW YORK CITY
New York City will soon refuse to shelter families just because they say they are homeless.
Those who could continue to live with friends or family, or who abandon their apartments because of crime and drug-dealing in their neighborhoods, will be turned away, city officials said yesterday.
The new rules, proposed by the city and approved by state regulators this week, will change the city's 10-year practice of sheltering virtually anyone who asks for help, no questions asked.
Even with the changes, the city will still have the nation's most generous approach to sheltering the homeless.


Court Backs Lesbian's Right To Adopt a Partner's Child
A family court judge has upheld a lesbian's right to become the adoptive parent of her partner's child, in an unusually detailed opinion addressing a practice that has been growing, largely out of public view, since the mid-1980's.
The judge, Phillip M. Freedman, ruled that it would be in the best interests of the child, a 3-year-old girl, to allow her adoption by the woman who has had a "committed relationship" with her mother for 10 years.

On Eve of Strike, Nigeria Detains Opponents
Nigeria's military Government has detained dozens of opponents and imposed tight controls on the press as a three-day protest of the annulment of June's elections approaches.
General strikes and demonstrations are to begin on Thursday.

Lehman Bros. Appointment
Dexter Senft, one of the Wall Street "rocket scientists" of a decade and more ago, who transformed bond trading from a seat-of-the-pants business into one relying on computers and mathematical models, has joined Lehman Brothers as a managing director in charge of quantitative research.
In the late 1970's, Mr.
Senft was a leader in evaluating mortgage-backed securities, and he helped educate a generation of investors and traders about how prices and yields of those securities can fluctuate as mortgages are repaid.


Ohio State Coach Testifies in Jackson Trial

Serbs Said to Send More Troops and Arms to Sarajevo
Despite renewed assurances by Serbian nationalists that their troops were withdrawing from two strategic mountains overlooking Sarajevo, the units held their positions today and were reported to be moving more heavy weapons and hundreds of fresh troops forward toward the small pocket of territory that remains under Bosnian Government control.
Western reporters who crossed the Serbian siege lines around Sarajevo and reached Serbian positions on Mount Bjelasnica and Mount Igman returned to the city tonight and said that all signs on the two mountains pointed to a consolidation of the Serbian strongholds.

Personal Health
MOST parents of infants and preschoolers have no memory of summers when children were kept out of swimming pools for fear of catching polio.
Indeed, a 1993 Gallup poll shows that nearly half of parents today are unaware that polio is a contagious disease.
Nor do they know firsthand the terrors of breath-robbing whooping cough, the often fatal paralysis of tetanus or the sometimes fatal throat infection caused by diphtheria.
Many do not know that measles can cause life-threatening encephalitis and mental retardation.
Nearly all parents of young children today grew up when these serious infectious diseases were prevented by vaccines, which have saved more young lives than any public health measure since the purification of public water supplies.


Big Victory for American Airlines in Fare Suit
After an intense four-week trial, jurors decided in less than four hours today that American Airlines did not try to drive weaker competitors out of business with "predatory" prices during the air fare war last summer.
Lawyers for Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines, which brought the suit, said they might appeal the verdict.
But the swiftness of the decision and the fact that the jury did not believe that American Airlines intended to monopolize markets with its revamped fares could make a successful appeal difficult, they said.

Teen-Ager Testifies That Off-Duty Police Officer Threw First Blow In Clash
A teen-ager who prosecutors say was criminally beaten by two off-duty New York City police officers after he slashed the face of a third off-duty officer, testified yesterday that he had wielded his razor blade only after the man he cut had punched him.
But the teen-ager said he could not identify the two officers on trial as having been among those who beat him at a Brooklyn elevated station and in a car.
And no other witnesses have identified the officers as taking part in the beating, though the prosecution argues that witness accounts of the clash point to the defendants.

She is seeking unspecified compensatory damages.


Productivity Of Workers Falls Sharply
After rising steadily for almost two years, the productivity of American workers dropped between January and June, the Labor Department said today in a report that could raise worries about layoffs or renewed inflationary pressures.
The department reported that average nonfarm output per hour of work sank at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.5 percent from April to June, the second quarterly drop this year and the biggest decline in more than four years.
From January through March productivity dropped at a rate of 1.6 percent.

Review/City Opera; 'Tosca,' In a Moody Revival
The City Opera's 50th anniversary season has opened with a heavy salvo of Puccini: "La Boheme," "Madama Butterfly" and, on Saturday night, "Tosca." The last two are both revivals of productions by Frank Corsaro, and their variable success illustrates the challenge posed by Puccini's adventurous conservatism.
"Butterfly," in its original 1904 version, glances against turn-of-the-century American imperialism in the Far East.
The production follows along with some subtle gestures and details of decor: most tellingly, a model of an American battleship in the hands of a half-Japanese child.
But the overall atmosphere falls short of the original score's ambitions: some large, unifying gesture is absent, some central image of cultural conflict.


Reform for the Public Lands
Resurrecting a promise he had shelved under pressure from Western lawmakers, President Clinton proposes to double grazing fees and tighten supervision for America's vast public lands.
While environmental purists might want higher fees and stiffer rules, the new plan is a wholesome break with historical leniency toward the private use of public resources.
Mr.
Clinton first proposed increasing fees for grazing and mining on Federal lands in his budget package, but backed off when Western senators threatened to scuttle the whole package if those fees were in it.
His pullback added to the perception -- in full bloom at the time -- of a floundering fledgling in the Oval Office.
But if Mr.
Clinton can now accomplish most of the same objective through normal rule-making without a draining battle in Congress, his early retreat may nourish the notion that he knows what works and what doesn't.

Review/Film; Blessing (or Burden?) of a Child's Chess Gift
"Searching for Bobby Fischer" isn't about Mr.
Fischer, but it's well named.
The film tells the story of Josh Waitzkin, a gifted young chess player growing up in the shadow of the legendary boy wonder, the one whose name is still mentioned in awestruck tones.
Yet Mr.
Fischer, who is seen here in old news clips as a boy playing against rows of different grown-up opponents and otherwise dazzling the chess establishment, is as well remembered for arrogance and eccentricity as he is for brilliance.
Hovering over this absorbing story, the image of Mr.
Fischer embodies genius as a double-edged sword.
The price of being a prodigy is very much at the heart of "Searching for Bobby Fischer," which is adapted from the book by Fred Waitzkin about his son's experience.
As written and directed thoughtfully by Steven Zaillian (whose other, much broader screenplays include "Awakenings" and "Jack the Bear"), the film seems to worry about the very talents it also celebrates.
This separates it valuably from the standard-issue success story it occasionally approaches.


Fatal Motorcycle Accident

Thus the fact that doctors did not immediately recognize the girl's symptoms made no difference in the outcome, and did not lead to the death.

Hope Seen for Curbing Youth Violence
Although statistics show that violence is rising among American youths, a panel of psychologists released a report yesterday offering an optimistic view of what might be done to reverse the bloody tide.
The escalation in violence among young people is captured in statistics like these: a 61 percent increase in the 1980's in shootings committed by Americans 15 to 19 years old, and a 1,740 percent rise in the number of children and teen-agers treated for knife and gunshot wounds since 1986 at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington.

ONE of the saddest things I have heard this summer is a congressional proposal for the Department of Interior to purchase four historic ball parks when they are no longer needed for major league baseball.

SoHo, Sidewalks And Small Cafes: Oh, So Romantic! Oh, So Illegal!
FEW scenes in New York may be as romantic as an outdoor cafe table in SoHo.
But to a small group of artists and urban pioneers who moved to this once-decrepit neighborhood before it became gentrified and swamped by shoppers, nothing has been more disturbing than the proliferation of unenclosed sidewalk cafe tables that, with their umbrellas, sprout up like giant portobello mushrooms each night.
The tables, unbeknown to many, are illegal in SoHo and nearby NoHo.
An obscure 1980 zoning resolution left these two neighborhoods as the only areas in Manhattan zoned for commercial and manufacturing use where unenclosed sidewalk cafe tables are banned.

Pentagon Seeks To Modify Cuts In Carrier Fleet
Reflecting growing concerns over regional instability around the world, the Pentagon has recommended that the United States maintain a fleet of 12 aircraft carriers, senior Administration officials said today.
The Pentagon had been considering a plan to cut the fleet to 10 carriers from the current 14.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin made the recommendation for the larger fleet at a meeting of top officials at the White House.
Under the plan, one carrier would be used to train Navy aircraft units in the military reserves but would also be available for patrols.


New Polio Shot May Be Safer
A NEW, beefed-up version of the old polio vaccine, based on killed virus, may provide better protection against this disease and, at the same time, prevent the rare cases of paralytic polio that occur among the recipients of the currently used Sabin vaccine, an oral vaccine made from attenuated live virus, according to a study in the current issue of the Journal of Infectious Diseases.
The new vaccine, based on an inactivated polio virus but with enhanced potency, is approved for general use and is often used to prevent polio in people with immune disorders.
However, in a study of 158 immunologically normal infants, those who got two doses of the new injectable vaccine, at the age of 2 months and 4 months, followed by a single dose of the oral vaccine at 12 months showed higher levels of protection against polio than those who got three doses of the oral vaccine.
Because a killed-virus vaccine was used for two of the doses, the chances of getting sick from the vaccinations were greatly reduced.
The study was conducted by Dr.
Howard Faden, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Buffalo.

Oils Infused With Taste Lead the Condiment Craze
Like an open mind, the American pantry keeps stretching and expanding.
The search for flavor, variety and convenience has pushed cooks toward condiments and concoctions that promise to boost the flavor of food.
Bucolic cottage industries as well as multinational corporations have obliged with a battery of new products.
There was the mustard craze, when everyone from roadside farm-stand owners to elite wine makers began to produce hot mustards, herb mustards and spice mustards.
Then came vinegars: wine, sherry, champagne, malt, herb-infused, fruit and chili.
Spice mixtures, seasoned salts and herb pastes followed.


Demjanjuk Verdict Points Up Complicity; Fight Return to U.S.
To the Editor:
We take issue with your recommendation that the Justice Department allow John Demjanjuk to return to this country so that the process can be "done over, cleanly" (editorial, Aug. 5).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decision permitting Mr.
Demjanjuk's return flies in the face of evidence that he was an active, voluntary participant in wartime atrocities and was properly stripped of his citizenship and any right to enter or be present within United States borders.


U.S. May Send Commandos To Hunt for Somali Warlord
The Administration is considering using commandos to search Mogadishu for Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, the Somali warlord who the United States believes was behind the killing of four American soldiers, United States officials said today.
One official familiar with Government planning said that "the use of special forces and other creative military operations" were being discussed, and that the use of commandos from other countries was being considered.

Saberhagen Belatedly Admits to Bleach Squirt
In a statement released by the Mets yesterday, Bret Saberhagen admitted responsibility for the July 27 bleach-spraying incident in the Shea Stadium clubhouse.
The pitcher agreed to make amends for his actions and offered a formal apology both for his behavior that night and for his failure to acknowledge his role at an earlier date.
"I am sorry for the accident and the failure to come forward, both of which have obviously hurt the club's relations with the media," said Saberhagen, who over the last two weeks repeatedly denied his role in the incident -- in which reporters were sprayed -- to both the news media and to his organization.


I.A.A.F. Won't Review Krabbe Case Now
Ignoring appeals and pressure from Germany, world track and field officials have refused to discuss the case of the world-champion sprinter, KATRIN KRABBE, who remains suspended for doping.

Officer on Drug Duty Wounded in Shooting
A police officer trying to serve a search warrant on suspected drug dealers in a Washington Heights apartment yesterday morning was wounded in the leg when one of the suspects ambushed him, the police said.
The officer, Sgt.

Sergeant Gildea was in good condition yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
Four men, including the man suspected of shooting the officer, have been arrested, said a police spokesman, Officer Scott Bloch.

New Chief at Empire Blue Cross Moving Quickly to Reduce Costs
Moving swiftly to reverse years of financial decline, the new head of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans to cut costs by 10 percent, largely by reducing its staff through attrition, early retirement and layoffs, a company spokesman said yesterday.
The personnel cuts, as well as possible reductions in the use of rented office space, are intended to save the financially troubled insurer $50 million to $55 million a year, said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Empire, which lost a total of $250 million in 1991 and 1992.

Blessing (or Burden?) of a Child's Chess Gift
"Searching for Bobby Fischer" isn't about Mr.
Fischer, but it's well named.
The film tells the story of Josh Waitzkin, a gifted young chess player growing up in the shadow of the legendary boy wonder, the one whose name is still mentioned in awestruck tones.
Yet Mr.
Fischer, who is seen here in old news clips as a boy playing against rows of different grown-up opponents and otherwise dazzling the chess establishment, is as well remembered for arrogance and eccentricity as he is for brilliance.
Hovering over this absorbing story, the image of Mr.
Fischer embodies genius as a double-edged sword.
The price of being a prodigy is very much at the heart of "Searching for Bobby Fischer," which is adapted from the book by Fred Waitzkin about his son's experience.
As written and directed thoughtfully by Steven Zaillian (whose other, much broader screenplays include "Awakenings" and "Jack the Bear"), the film seems to worry about the very talents it also celebrates.
This separates it valuably from the standard-issue success story it occasionally approaches.

The United States intensified pressure on the Bosnian Serbs today by explicitly warning that they could face a NATO attack unless they moved quickly to abandon positions on two strategic mountains near Sarajevo.
At the same time, the United Nations announced that the ground controllers necessary to coordinate air strikes were now in place in Bosnia, and that their links to NATO warplanes were being tested.

JAPANESE PREMIER TACKLES U.S. TIES
Japan's new Prime Minister used his first news conference today to emphasize his eagerness to improve strained relations and reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States, but he rejected most of the tools President Clinton has insisted on using to do the job.
While the Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, said Japan would open its markets and reform its political structure, he suggested that Tokyo would not open its rice market, would not cut taxes to stimulate the anemic economy and would refuse to set targets for Japanese imports or for reductions in the trade surplus.
The Clinton Administration has pressed for such targets.

Giardia Test Will Cut Waiting Time
DOCTORS have long been frustrated by the difficulty of diagnosing giardia, a common parasitic infection of the intestine that causes diarrhea, bloating, nausea, stomach pain and fatigue.
The current test is so unreliable that patients frequently suffer the debilitating symptoms for weeks or months before they test positive and are treated for the disease.
Now scientists have developed a new way to detect the parasite in the stool.
The new test should keep patients from having to wait so long for a diagnosis.
It uses antibodies to detect proteins from the surface of the parasite.
It will detect the proteins even if the parasite has died and been degraded.


Bosnia Mediators Call Off Talks Until Serbs Quit Mountains
Indirectly endorsing Bosnian Muslim demands, the international mediators on Bosnia and Herzegovina said today that they would not reconvene peace talks until Serbian forces withdrew from two strategic mountains overlooking Sarajevo.
The Muslim-dominated Government has boycotted the negotiations with Serbian and Croatian leaders since Aug. 1 to protest the Serbs' seizure of Mount Igman and Mount Bjelasnica.
A United Nations spokesman said Serbian forces had pulled back from Mount Bjelasnica, but were still on Mount Igman.

The California Phone Rush Is On
Not since the breakup of the Bell System monopoly 10 years ago has the telecommunications industry seen such upheaval as is taking place in California, where companies will soon be allowed to compete to carry short-haul toll calls that are now the sole province of local phone companies.
Such calls -- farther than 16 miles but still within the authorized coverage area of the local telephone monopoly -- represent a $2 billion market in California for regulated local phone companies like Pacific Bell and GTE.

Somali Showdown
The American determination to arrest a fugitive Somali clan leader underscores how the United Nations mission in Somalia has evolved from one of guarding and providing relief aid to aggressive military enforcement.
The original goal -- to provide security so that relief agencies could supply food to tens of thousands of starving Somalis -- officially ended in May with the withdrawal of American troops and the handing over of command to the United Nations.
The mission, United Nations officials said, was highly successful: the famine created by three years of civil war was over.

Your Aug. 1 editorial makes the same error when it declares that Jessica "was adopted in Iowa" by the DeBoers.

WHEN Judith Smith Kaye rose last Saturday to speak at the annual meeting of the American Bar Association -- kicking off a discussion of "Is the Law Male?" -- it was the fifth of 10 talks she would give at the convention, a feat surpassed only by the president and the president-elect of the bar group.
"The week that I became Chief Judge of the State of New York. . .," she began.
But the audience -- which, unlike the law, was most decidedly female -- cut her off, and the room at the New York Hilton erupted in thunderous applause.

Boys of 50's Brooklyn, Graying but Still Game
BACK then in that time of egg creams and lime rickeys when they were being boys together, when they were first learning about sin, when their parents were worried about what would become of them, back then in the 50's, Flink's was the center of everything.
The name on the window of the candy store at Newkirk near Coney Island Avenue said The Colonel's but everybody called it Flink's, though nobody knew why.
Carl, who owned the place, was not named Flink.
Carl, who would occasionally wave a cleaver to chase out people who were sitting at the counter without spending, is dead.

Teen-Ager Testifies That Off-Duty Police Officer Threw First Blow In Clash
A teen-ager who prosecutors say was criminally beaten by two off-duty New York City police officers after he slashed the face of a third off-duty officer, testified yesterday that he had wielded his razor blade only after the man he cut had punched him.
But the teen-ager said he could not identify the two officers on trial as having been among those who beat him at a Brooklyn elevated station and in a car.
And no other witnesses have identified the officers as taking part in the beating, though the prosecution argues that witness accounts of the clash point to the defendants.

My refrigerator at home held, among other things, ripe plum tomatoes, fresh snap peas and goat cheese.
I had used rich ricotta before as a sauce binder, but not goat cheese.


Europe's Worry: A Generation of Leaders Not Up to the Task?
Confronted by political scandal, recession and the erosion of familiar comforts, Western Europeans have come to sense that the very people they chose to solve their problems have been in power too long to steer a dejected Continent through the shifting shoals that mark the close of the 20th century.
This year alone, France's Socialists have been ignominiously ousted from power, their counterparts in Spain have lost absolute control of Parliament for the first time in a decade, and an entire political elite has been decapitated by scandal in Italy.
In Britain, Prime Minister John Major holds the dubious distinction of becoming his country's least-loved Prime Minister since polling began.
And in Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's popularity is at an all-time low.

Review/Music; Samples of the Baroque, Paired at Mostly Mozart
In its most avant-garde swipe yet at the thematic programming trend, the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center opened its Mozart and Haydn Week on Monday evening with a double bill that brought together Charpentier's "Acteon" and Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas," performed not by the festival's resident players, but by William Christie and Les Arts Florissants.
It was, in effect, Not Mozart and Haydn Week at the Not Mostly Mozart Festival.
In that spirit, there were subtle connections to be made.
Both works were composed -- indeed, both composers had died -- well before Haydn and Mozart were born.
Both are steeped in the elegance of the French Baroque style (alloyed, in Purcell's case, with English traditions), which both Mozart and Haydn would have regarded as hopelessly archaic.
And given the 18th century's preoccupation with new music, there is reason to suppose that both Mozart and Haydn went through their lives without hearing either work.

New Pregnancy Hope: a Single Sperm
BELGIAN scientists have invented a new treatment for male infertility that they say may allow virtually any man, no matter how few or misshapen or immobile his sperm cells, to father a child.
The method, developed by Dr.
Andre C. Van Steirteghem of the Brussels Free University in Belgium, involves the direct injection of a single human sperm into a human egg in a petri dish.
Scientists had thought such a technique would never work, because it bypasses the complex chemical reactions that take place when the membrane of a sperm meets the membrane of an egg and because no one, including Dr.
Van Steirteghem, has succeeded in fertilizing animal eggs by directly injecting sperm.

The text of the letter was disclosed today by the Justice Department in an effort to quiet speculation about the death of the 48-year-old deputy White House counsel, an Arkansas lawyer who was a lifelong friend of President Clinton.
But instead it raised a number of puzzling new questions, few of which were answered in Administration briefings.

Mitchell Trims Down, Inflates Expectations
First-round draft choice, first season, first regular-season game, first pass reception: Johnny Mitchell had the football, a 23-yard gain and -- ouch! -- a shoulder injury that kept him out of action for the next six weeks.
"It was a very learningful experience," Mitchell said today at the Jets' camp, reflecting on his mishap of last Sept. 6.
"My shoulder wasn't strong enough. I wasn't lifting weights properly. I was raw."

DeBoers Never Adopted Custody Case Baby; Jessica Won't Forget

Yes, her mind will forget, but in certain places in the heart there will be a hunger and a sense of loss.
How do I know what experts can only guess at?
At about age 2 1/2 or 3 I was taken from a loving home in Brooklyn by a father who thought he was doing the right thing.

A Brighter Day for Legal Services
Lawyer-bashing is an old story for the underpaid, overworked attorneys who represent the poor in more than 300 poverty law offices under the federally funded Legal Services Corporation.
For eight years the Reagan Administration pummeled the program with abuse and tried to kill it, and for four years the Bush Administration neglected it.
Now President Clinton has wisely chosen a new board of directors committed to breathing renewed life into the program.
Some of the 11 new directors are veterans of the bashings Ronald Reagan administered as a Governor and President.
Others are bar leaders who lobbied to gain the organized bar's strong endorsement for the program.
Still others are allies of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who headed the board during the Carter Administration.
All deserve swift confirmation when the Senate returns next month.

An article on July 26 about an American warplane that fired on a missile battery in southern Iraq misidentified the authority that barred Iraqi flights over the area.
The ban was imposed by the United States, Britain and France, not the United Nations.


In America; Killing 'Just for Whatever'
Denver's long season of violence and sorrow began in May when an infant, just 10 months old, was struck by a bullet at the polar bear exhibit of the Denver Zoo.
Authorities do not know who fired the bullet, which grazed the baby's head and shattered an innocent family outing.
The child, a boy, survived but the mayhem in and around Denver was under way and much worse was to come.


Giuliani Outlines Plan to Stir Economy
Looking toward the future by casting back to the revitalization of New York City's economy in the early 1980's, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, yesterday released an extensive plan for the city's economy that stressed cutting the city work force by more than 16 percent, tax relief and an end to some fines that he said were driving small businesses from the city.
His proposals, delivered in a morning speech at the Sheraton New York before an audience of about 80 supporters and dismissed by the Mayor's office by dusk as "political plagiarism," were essentially a refrain from speeches he has given in recent months.


Trichardtsdal Journal; A Farmer, but Not Exactly a Boer. You See . . .
On the day Rex Mametja was inducted into the farming fraternity of this tropical hamlet, he hovered near the door of the planters' hangout, the Ofcolaco Club, ready to flee across the cricket pitch if necessary.
There he was, he recalled thinking, encircled by the white settlers whose forefathers had robbed his forefathers of their land.
As a barefoot child picking cotton on their farms, he had seen the whip applied.
As a voteless grownup he had joined the African National Congress to take the country back from them.

U.S. Joins Investigation Into Asbestos in Schools
Federal prosecutors announced yesterday that they would look into why asbestos inspections in New York City's public schools were so shoddy, as city investigators said for the first time that their own inquiry includes other companies involved in the asbestos program besides the one publicly cited.
The investigators, Edward D. Stancik, the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the New York City School District, and Thomas D. Thacher Jr., the Inspector General of the city's School Contruction Authority, repeatedly declined to give details, but said they are looking into the work of at least one New Jersey company in addition to Enviro-Safe, the asbestos consultants hired by the Board of Education.


Outlook Is Uncertain on Revenue Sharing by Owners
Richard Ravitch, the architect of baseball's plan to increase revenue sharing among the 28 clubs, can count on a certain number of votes for adoption of some sort of plan.
But it's the votes he isn't certain of that will determine the outcome of the owners' meeting in Kohler, Wis., that begins today.
The critical meeting will continue tomorrow and perhaps Friday as the owners try to reach agreement on a plan that would take effect only if the players then agreed to a salary cap.
Because the players are opposed to a cap, the owners may be meeting in vain, even if they adopt a plan.


Mood Ellington: The Faithful Gather
Duke Ellington is Russia to the Napoleon of his biographers and fans.
Nineteen years after his death, he still hasn't been the subject of a decent biography, though rumor has it that a new one in the works will remedy that.
The most basic information -- which of his pieces were played when, and by whom -- is lost in the shadows of memory, yet to be clarified.
His discography, 534 pages long, is a swamp of official recordings, airchecks made from radio broadcasts, V-disks made for the armed forces during World War II, live recordings and Ellingtonian revisions of older material.
There are 183 recorded versions of "Perdido" listed.
Try to get a handle on that.
But things may be changing.
The latest sign is the 11th Annual International Duke Ellington Conference, which starts today and will run until Saturday, at the Holiday Inn on Broadway at 49th Street.
The yearly conferences -- last year's was held in Denmark, next year's is to be in Sweden -- are effusions of Ellingtonia, part fan-club meeting, with all the attendant nostalgia, part academic conference and part simple basking in the cathedral Ellington built, musically and intellectually.


Review/Dance; From Taiwan, Energetic Ceremonies of Motion
The dance and music performed by the Formosa Aboriginal Dance Troupe of Taiwan on Sunday afternoon at the Fountain Plaza at Lincoln Center were ceremonies filled with repeated movements and sounds.
But the performers, appearing as part of the center's Out of Doors festival, were one of the rare groups who managed to overcome the distractions of the setting.
Car horns, conversations, excited children and the city's busy skyscape paled before the authority, simplicity and radiant humanity of the company, seen here in its American debut.
The 24-member troupe, founded in 1991 with the aim of revitalizing the traditional song and dance of nine aboriginal tribes, offered just a taste of its work, performed in costumes of brilliant colors and patterns, adorned with feathers and pompons.
Fuller programs will be offered in performances on Friday through Sunday at the Taipei Theater in the McGraw-Hill Building (1221 Avenue of the Americas, at 49th Street).
But what a tantalizing taste this was!
Under the direction of Faidow Fagod, the company bravely and imaginatively built its program around a New Year's ritual in the styles of three tribes, with occasional ventures into male initiation and harvest dances.

Red Sox and Viola Treat It Like a Big Game
The Yankees kept assuring themselves that this was not a really important series.
Three games in August against the Red Sox with first-place implications for both teams, not important?
These were the Red Sox.
This was Fenway Park.
Scalpers were asking $75 for a bleacher ticket.
This game carried more impact for both teams than any since 1988, even if the Yankees were reluctant to admit it.
The opener between two of baseball's storied franchises might have helped revive one of baseball's great rivalries, especially from Boston's perspective.
Frank Viola pitched six splendid innings to power the Red Sox to a 5-0 victory and boost them into second place by themselves in the packed American League East before a packed park of 34,413 fans.

Region Stands To Gain Little In New Budget
New Jersey, New York and Connecticut will be among the states that benefit least, while paying the most, under the economic plan that President Clinton signed into law today.
Economists, regional planners and executives have spent the last weeks poring over details of the Clinton budget and breaking the numbers down to suit their particular needs.
Their calculations show that the three states rank low on nearly every measurement of new spending intended to boost the economy.

Historical Society Gets N.Y.U.'s Help
New York University is taking over management of the library of the troubled New-York Historical Society, it was announced on Tuesday.
In addition, the two institutions will develop joint educational programs, and the libraries at the university and the society will share their catalogues in a single database.
An agreement between the two institutions became effective Aug. 1.
It was announced by Herbert S. Winokur Jr. and Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the chairmen of the historical society, and L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University.
Under the agreement, which is for a year but may be extended, Carlton C. Rochell, the dean of the university's library system, which has holdings of 3.7 million volumes, will oversee management of the society's library services and develop joint programs. 'Economie of Scale'
At a stroke, the venture promises to cut costs for and to shore up management of the society, which has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the last four years and early this year was on the verge of closing its doors.
At various times, talks were begun to see whether the society could be merged with the Museum of the City of New York or the New York Public Library.
In a last-minute reprieve, as the society was laying off staff members, closing its galleries and cutting back on library hours, the State Legislature allocated $6.3 million to it in April, and the city provided matching financing in May.

John Wilson began designing a new home for the British Library, he has lived through what could only be considered an architect's nightmare.

The site was finally moved north and east to a seedy area next to St.

More dithering in Parliament postponed the approval of a design and the start of construction until 1980.

Census Takes Wing, Keeping Count of Vulnerable Butterflies
For the last five years, ecologists in New Jersey joining a national butterfly census have found the existence of butterflies in the state nearly as fragile as the insects seem in flight.
Several of the 130 species identified in New Jersey are on the Federal Government's endangered list, and many more are feared to be disappearing from the region.
But as the bands of butterfly counters grow, their workshops and outings also are generating increasing attention.
The censuses are drawing participants from the curious to serious scientists.
As a side effect, the counts have raised the first rumblings of a wildflower movement that advocates planting flowers that butterflies feed on along now-mowed state highways.

"Rights payments were out of proportion to reality. Baseball is going in a different direction, which indicates the rules we operate under will change."


Sports of The Times; The Roomies Are Reunited In Boston
THERE are very few roommates left in the major leagues.
No need to share hotel rooms at those salaries.
But two old "roomies" are playing first base and shortstop for the Boston Red Sox in the delightful seesaw of the Eastern Division.
Last night Mo Vaughn and John Valentin couldn't stop the Yankees from winning, 8-3, and tying this series that is merely a month short of being crucial.
"Today is over," Valentin said Tuesday night after he and Vaughn both hit home runs in Boston's 5-0 victory.
The two gritty young Red Sox know that baseball still takes six months and 162 games.
It is some slight advantage to the Red Sox that two of their regulars were roommates for two years whenever Seton Hall University went on the road.

Islamic Guerrillas Take to the Hills in Egypt
For the first time in the 18 months since they began a violent campaign to overthrow the Government, Islamic militants have formed small guerrilla bands in the mountains in southern Egypt, militant leaders and Egyptian intelligence officials say.
The dozen or so bands, each comprising about a dozen fighters, are constantly on the move in the arid hills that stretch out from the thin green ribbon of farmland that girdles the Nile.
They are equipped with small arms, automatic weapons, crude homemade bombs and walkie-talkies.
In the last few weeks the guerrillas have slipped into villages and towns in southern Egypt, where there is a strong militant presence, to carry out armed attacks and then melted back into the countryside.
They have gravitated around Assiut, Minya, Dairut and the surrounding villages, where some of the worst violence has occurred.

But at practice this morning, Esiason let fly with three deep passes -- two of more than 40 yards in the air for touchdowns to receivers Mario Bailey and Rob Moore -- that were on target and evoked flashes of when the quarterback was at his best in Cincinnati in 1988 and 1989.

DINKINS WILL SHIFT RUNNING OF CLINICS TO HOSPITAL CORP.
In a major bureaucratic overhaul aimed at reducing costs and unifying New York City's health clinics with its hospitals, the Dinkins administration will turn the management of dozens of city clinics over to the public corporation that owns the municipal hospitals.
The average patient will not see an immediate change in service at the clinics, now run by the city's Health Department.
But city officials say the shift is part of a larger reshaping of the city's health system intended to improve health care for the poor.
Ultimately, the goal is to provide a network of neighborhood clinics practicing preventive medicine and working in tandem with nearby hospitals, thus easing the strain on emergency rooms.

For the next four hours, working both sides of Union Avenue, he first met with officials of the horse owners and trainers on the backstretch and expressed support for their drive for higher purses and no shutdown of winter racing.
Then he went to the Hall of Fame across the street, met with the trustees of the New York Racing Association and expressed hope for a joint attack on the problems besetting the business.


Yankees Drub Clemens and Squelch the Drama
The cherished pitching matchup quickly dissolved into a mismatch.
The aura of Roger Clemens against Jimmy Key lasted about 10 minutes tonight because the Yankees exploded for four runs off the Boston pitcher in the top of the first inning.
Before Key tossed one pitch, he had a comfortable cushion.
But this was Fenway Park and this was a road game so the Yankees did not relax too much.
They anxiously watched as Key handled the Red Sox for six innings to protect the lead and they happily watched Clemens stew as his situation remained grim after the first.
With a bunch of Yankee runs on the scoreboard and Key in command, there was a good deal of silence among the 34,470 fans.

And for a buckle designer looking for new ideas, they unearthed vintage fashion books.

When Rudolph W. Giuliani campaigned on the streets of New York City last Saturday, one of his stops was that quintessential Upper West Side milieu, Zabar's.
When Mayor David N. Dinkins began a radio advertising campaign this week to raise money and attract volunteers, he made sure to include WQXR-FM, a classical music station through which he hopes to reach many well-educated, liberal listeners.
By hunting for votes in such venues, both candidates are showing what a number of polls have suggested: how important a certain stripe of skeptical, independent-minded voters will be in determining the outcome of a mayoral election that is widely expected to be close.
So close, in fact, that any one of several broad voting groups could be said to hold the key in November -- Hispanic New Yorkers, Jews, gay voters, women.


New Tax Law Limits the Draw of S Corporations
By pushing the top individual tax rate significantly higher than the top corporate rate, the new tax law takes some luster off S corporations.
Unlike other corporations, which are taxed on their earnings, businesses named for subchapter S of the tax code do not pay a corporate tax.
Instead, their earnings are passed through to stockholders, who pay taxes based on their personal income bracket.


Several Firehouses Are Temporarily Shut as Firefighters Find They're Under-Dressed
In an unusual labor dispute, dozens of New York City firefighters have told supervisors that their coats, boots, gloves and other equipment are worn out or otherwise inappropriate, causing the temporary shutdown of nearly 30 firehouses over the last two days, union and city officials said last night.
The closings have been brief, usually lasting from a half-hour to several hours, fire officials said, and safety has not been compromised because other nearby units covered for those that were shut down.


POPE CELEBRATES INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
On the eve of his first meeting with President Clinton, Pope John Paul II today criticized injustice against indigenous people "from the Alaskan peninsula to Tierra del Fuego" and urged a new redistribution of wealth between the American continent's rich north and poor south.
The Pope arrived in this small town of 20,000 people in the Yucatan peninsula from Jamaica on the 60th overseas tour of his papacy.
He is to travel on Thursday to meet President Clinton and celebrate World Youth Day in Denver, Colo.
That visit is expected to illuminate fundamental differences between the Vatican and many American Catholics over artificial birth control, abortion and the ordination of women as priests.


Man in the News; Four-Star Military Mind
Pray for peace but prepare for war, runs an old military motto.
John Malchase David Shalikashvili came into a world about to go to war.
As an 8-year-old boy, he fled for his life through a country ruined by war.
He has been preparing for war all his adult life.
General Shalikashvili, who was named by President Clinton yesterday to succeed Gen.
Colin L. Powell as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would be the first foreign-born military leader to hold that post.
He was born in Warsaw on June 27, 1936, the grandson of a czarist general and the son of a military officer from the Soviet republic of Georgia.
His mother was Polish.

Where AIDS Advances, Understanding Lags; On Long Island, Patients Describe Suburban Exclusion Unmatched in Cities
Peeking out from the clutter of papers on Anthony and Susan Scardace's refrigerator is testimony to a time of euphoria, before AIDS gave the family a guided tour through the dark side of suburbia.
It is a snapshot of Mr.
Scardace cradling his daughter, Victoria Marie, whose day-old face shines pink and impossibly playful.
The picture was taken at Mid-Island Hospital in Bethpage six years ago, where Mr.
Scardace was a popular employee in the purchasing department.


Bridge
Teams representing Norway and Germany began play yesterday in Arhus, Denmark, in the final of the World Junior Team Championship.
After 48 deals of a scheduled 128 Germany led Norway by 40 imps.
In the 64-deal playoff for the bronze medals, United States No. 1 team led Denmark by 30.
Semifinal play, in 64 deals Tuesday, went to extremes.
In one match Norway crushed the United States' first team by 115.5.
In the other Germany beat Denmark by half an imp, the smallest margin ever recorded in international play.
Denmark actually won the match by 10 imps, but Germany had a carryover of 10.5 imps based on the qualifying scores.


Ameritech Places Account in Review
Ameritech, the Midwest regional Bell telephone company, said yesterday that it had placed in review its corporate advertising account, with estimated billings of $10 million, after dismissing Bayer Bess Vanderwarker in Chicago, which had handled the account for the last five years.
"We, as a company, are undergoing a fairly dramatic reorganization," Steve Ford, an Ameritech spokesman in Chicago, said.
"Our objective is to bring fresh thinking into our advertising plans." A decision is expected in early November.


Books of The Times; A Little Girl With a Big Talent, and How She Grew
Judy Garland The Secret Life of an American Legend By David Shipman Illustrated. 540 pages.
Hyperion. $24.95.
Judy Garland said movie and television moguls wanted her to be "sort of the girl next door." But, she added, "they couldn't find the right house or the right door." Neither could she, and that's why the House of Garland turned into such a scary place.
Go through one door and you'd find the plucky, sweet-faced girl with the tear in her voice.
Go through another and you'd find a cursing maniac addicted to vodka, barbiturates, amphetamines, crash diets and wrist slashing.
Go through a third and you'd find a performing genius.
She knew every show-business technique there was, from hokum to hysteria to pure joy, and she managed to leave her mark on almost every kind of performer, from rock star to drag queen to summer-stock and church-choir ingenues.

Agriculture Dept. Unveils Cooking Labels for Meat
The Department of Agriculture yesterday unveiled labels with cooking and handling instructions that all raw meat and poultry will carry by the middle of October.
The labels were introduced at a news conference by Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who said they were part of an effort "to reinvent and rethink every aspect of meat inspection." The present system has been criticized for years because of its inability to prevent tainted meat from reaching consumers.


Mr. Giuliani as a Son of the Neighborhoods
ON THE SCREEN
Camera pans in on row of brick houses, then moves down to pick up Mr.
Giuliani dressed in a red short-sleeved shirt and sitting on the hood of a car.
When he talks about the city's small businesses, the scene shifts to the Bronx Terminal Market while captions run across the bottom, saying "New York City has lost over 300,000 jobs in the last three years," and "Only 25 percent of N.Y.C. job loss can be blamed on national trends. Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics." At the end, Mr.

Rock Hall of Fame Names Its Director
Mounting skepticism over whether the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum would ever be built was eased in June when ground was broken in Cleveland for the complex.
Another step in its evolution was taken yesterday with the appointment of Dennis Barrie as its director.
Mr.
Barrie, an art museum director and historian, came to national prominence in 1990 as the director of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati.
He and the museum were charged with obscenity, and ultimately acquitted, after presenting an exhibition of the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe.
After leaving the arts center last year, he founded Dennis Barrie &amp; Associates, which has developed traveling art exhibitions.
He is also a former director of the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
King, who will be entering his eighth season with the Islanders, played on a line with PIERRE TURGEON and STEVE THOMAS in 1992-93 and had 38 goals and 38 assists for 76 points in 77 games.

They wanted to be prepared.
In their case, preparation took the form of intensive classes in everything from adolescent behavior to household budgeting.
When they finished, they moved into a comfortable brownstone in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, not exactly a starter home.
Included in the deal were half a dozen troubled teen-age boys.

RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Courier Falls to 56th-ranked Stoltenberg  Jason Stoltenberg of Australia scored the biggest upset of his career yesterday, defeating second-seeded Jim Courier, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, in the second round of the $1.65 million Thriftway ATP Championship at the Jack Nicklaus Sports Center in Mason, Ohio.
Stoltenberg, ranked 56th in the world, completed the upset with an ace.
Courier seemed sluggish in the second and third sets and his serve lacked its usual zip.
Stoltenberg, the top-ranked junior player in the world in 1987, went to the net at every opportunity, and Courier missed many lobs and passing attempts. (AP) BASEBALL  New York Teams Play in 7 Games in a Day  New York City's entries in the first R.B.I.
World Series had a long day in St.
Louis yesterday, with the senior team (16- to 18-year-olds) playing a modified tripleheader and the junior team (13- to 15-year-olds) playing in four different games.
Because of rain delays on Tuesday, both teams began the day by completing interrupted games, the juniors beating Kansas City, 9-3, and the seniors beating Kansas City, 4-3.
The seniors followed with a 9-5 loss to Los Angeles, giving them a 1-1 record going into last night's game against St.
Louis at Busch Stadium.
The juniors followed with a 4-3 loss to San Juan and a 9-5 victory over Richmond, giving them a 2-1 record going into a late game against Miami.
The first R.B.I. (for Reviving Baseball in Innercities) World Series has drawn teams from 13 cities.
The double-elimination tournament ends tomorrow.
YACHT RACING  Germans Overcome Italians to Win Cup  The slim edge that Italy had going into the Fastnet, the last yacht race of Britain's Champagne Mumm Admiral's Cup series, was overtaken by the German team in yesterday's final stage.
Collisions, dismastings and a crewman who fell overboard whittled the 23-boat international fleet down to 15 boats by the end of the 12-day series.
Germany compiled 279.13 points, beating Australia by 25-hundredths of a point.
France was third over all with 247.50 points.
Italy, with two of its three boats retiring, finished fourth, with 242.88 points. (AP) TENNIS  Austin Gets Victory on Comeback Trail  Tracy Austin, playing an opponent who never even heard of her, rallied from a 4-2 deficit in the third set last night in Manhattan Beach, Calif., to defeat Yelena Likhovtseva, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, and advance to the third round of the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles.
Austin, 30, a two-time United States Open champion, is making a comeback after a four-year layoff.
She needed 2 hours 13 minutes to defeat Likhovtseva, a 17-year-old from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.
Austin will meet third-seeded seed Gabriela Sabatini today. (AP)


Cuomo Hits Hustings On the Backstretch
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo drove into the stable area at Saratoga Race Course at 9:15 this morning, checked the horses in Sally Lundy's barn, shook hands with some trainers between workouts and then got down to business: his campaign to reorganize racing in New York State.
For the next four hours, working both sides of Union Avenue, he first met with officials of the horse owners and trainers on the backstretch and expressed support for their drive for higher purses and no shutdown of winter racing.
Then he went to the Hall of Fame across the street, met with the trustees of the New York Racing Association and expressed hope for a joint attack on the problems besetting the business.

Sweden and Britain to Evacuate 41 Bosnians
The British and Swedish Governments said today that they would evacuate 41 war victims from besieged Sarajevo.
The announcement follows an outpouring of public outrage and sympathy touched off by the plight of a seriously wounded five-year-old Bosnian girl fighting for her life in a London hospital.
Prime Minister John Major, speaking in Stockholm alongside the Swedish Prime Minister, Carl Bildt, said Britain would take in 20 of the 41 victims, half of whom are children.
Sixteen will be transported to Sweden, and five others will be treated in Ireland.


Computer-Chip Stocks Rise on July Orders
Computer-chip stocks rallied today after an industry association released figures showing record-breaking orders for July.
The report surprised Wall Street analysts, who had been expecting a decline for July, typically a slow month in the semiconductor industry.
Shares of the Intel Corporation closed today at $58.75, up $1.875 in Nasdaq trading; Motorola rose $1 to close at $96; Texas Instruments was up 75 cents, to $77.25, and Advanced Micro Devices rose $1.25, to $29.625.
Many of these stocks had already moved up earlier in the month as individual companies began reporting that July earnings had exceeded their expectations.

The company has asked the court to schedule the trial no later than June 30, 1994, when Mr.

Seeking to dispel charges that it has a poor record of hiring members of minority groups, the Hughes Aircraft Company met in Washington today with officials of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which last week accused the military contractor of violating Federal guidelines on work-force diversity.
Although both sides described the breakfast meeting as cordial and productive, it apparently did little to change the N.A.A.C.P.'s stand.
At noon, the civil rights organization proceeded with a planned demonstration on the Capitol steps, where it criticized Hughes and Federal agencies for their hiring policies and treatment of minority-group workers.

Garry Shandling Is Staying Put at HBO
Garry Shandling has had plenty of offers recently to be the host of a real late-night talk show on a real network.
Yesterday, though, he announced that he would stick with parody and do at least 35 more episodes of "The Larry Sanders Show" on HBO.
On the show, Mr.
Shandling plays the neurotic, manipulative but strangely likable Larry Sanders, the host of his own late-night show.
In an eerie conflation of television and reality, the show's scripts this year have drawn heavily on actual developments in late-night television, developments that often included Mr.
Shandling.


A New System for Validating Rembrandts
The Rembrandt Research Project, a committee established 24 years ago by the Dutch Government to determine the authenticity of the many works attributed to Rembrandt, has lost four of its five members and is giving up the system of connoisseurship by consensus that has rankled scholars, curators and dealers for most of its existence.
Now the art world is asking what direction the project will take and whether crucial works by the Dutch master will be re-evaluated.
"The file is never closed," said Ernst van de Wetering, the remaining member of the project.
"Each painting is in constant discussion."

Immigrants detained by the Federal Government in Manhattan are held under inadequate conditions, subject to arbitrary isolation in roach-infested cells and denied effective access to legal help, says a report to be released today by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The problems at the immigration detention center on Varick Street include hostile guards, some inadequate medical care and management so inefficient that some immigrants are kept for months, even years, after they volunteer to be deported, the report said.

Economic Scene; Sustainability, or Seeking the Deficit Level That We Can Live With.
THE Democrats bit the deficit bullet, but did they bite off a big enough piece?
Not by Ross Perot's reckoning, or, for that matter, by Bill Clinton's.
Their assumption, widely shared across the political spectrum, is that the only acceptable deficit is no deficit at all, or at least none when the economy is running at full capacity.
And last week's budget accord still projects a deficit equal to 3 percent of national income in 1998 -- about where it was before the bipartisan budget summit conference in 1990.


Jury Acquits Mavs' Jackson of All Charges
A jury in Columbus, Ohio, yesterday found Dallas Mavericks guard JIM JACKSON not guilty of all charges stemming from a disturbance last Dec. 30 during which four people charged that the former Ohio State star had waved a gun at them as they were driving in Columbus.
The jury of four men and four women deliberated less two hours before acquitting Jackson of one count of aggravated menacing and three counts of disorderly conduct.
Franklin County Municipal Judge STEVEN HAYES had previously dismissed one charge of improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle and one count of disorderly conduct.

Schools Asbestos Task Force Cited for History of Mistakes
The New York City Board of Education's asbestos task force has a history of incompetence that stretches beyond the mismanaged federally mandated inspection of public schools, city investigators and board officials say.
In 1986, the board was forced to close a school for handicapped children in Washington Heights after the task force failed to supervise an asbestos-removal job adequately.
In 1987, the task force concluded that all of its asbestos testing during the preceding seven years was so unreliable that it had to be redone.


2 Injured In Dispute At Job Site; 10 Arrested
An architect and a construction worker were seriously hurt yesterday afternoon when 50 people demanding jobs stormed a work site at 72d Street and Madison Avenue where a Ralph Lauren store is under construction, the police said.
The demonstrators arrived in a bus at about 1 P.M., chanted slogans, and soon were in fights with workers on the site, wielding two-by-fours and chunks of concrete, said Lieut.
Farrell Hopkins of the 19th Precinct.
During the confusion, as frightened workers ran onto the street, some of the demonstrators also assaulted random victims on the street, Lieutenant Hopkins said.
By the end of the melee, 10 people were arrested and charged with riot and assault.

Bailey Knows It's Crowded Inside
The understanding, as far as Carlton Bailey is concerned, was that when he signed a $5 million deal to leave Buffalo and join the Giants, the talented former Bills linebacker would be in the starting lineup.
Somehow, some way.
Of course, that wasn't part of the contract, but when a team spends that kind of money on a player, he can't help think he's going to be on the first team.
"Originally, yeah, I did think I was going to be a starter," he said.
"I still have that in mind. I still think I'm a good enough player to start. But for right now at least, Pepper Johnson is ahead of me. That's just the way it is for now. I just have to fight and battle my way to the front. I'll tell you this, it's great competition."

Meteor Shower Obscured By Uncooperative Clouds
The preparations began weeks ago.
John Marshall and his band of urban astronomers planned beach-chair gatherings at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn and the marshes of Staten Island.
The Parks Department decided to assemble skywatchers at sites around New York City.
Across the region, people had vowed to wake after midnight, throw open their windows and look up.
Overnight, the annual Perseid meteor shower was supposed to have made such a forceful appearance that even in a city of domineering architecture swathed in artificial light, residents would finally be able to sample the heavens.
The usually pallid sky should have been flecked with color, giving it more pizazz than the skyline to which it has long been subservient.

HOME IMPROVEMENT
NO floor says home like a gleaming wood floor, but caring for one is not always so straightforward.
In fact, cleaning methods recommended for some finishes are wrong for others.
All wood floors should be dusted every few days to remove the gritty dirt that causes scratches.
Scratches not only dull a floor's finish, but they also open the way for water damage and stains.
If the floor has a waxed or oil finish, use a broom or dry dust mop (you can add a solvent-based cleaning compound, if you like).
On a polyurethane finish, Swedish finish (a generic variety containing urea-formaldehyde) or acrylic finish (the kind used on most flooring labeled "prefinished"), use a broom or a dry dust mop.
If the finish is less than three years old and in good shape, you can use a damp mop, but if the finish is old or worn, the floor may not stand up to damp-mopping.
In addition to dusting, vacuum all wood floors at least once a week.

Child Health: Now, Get It Right
Gov.
Mario Cuomo of New York shocked child welfare advocates when he vetoed a bill that would require health insurers to include immunizations and routine doctor visits for children under 19 in every family policy.
The idea was to get more children to doctors before they become seriously ill and before they run up huge health care costs.
Mr.
Cuomo liked the idea but not the bill, which he found too costly for ratepayers and technically flawed.
He's right on both counts.
But what the Governor didn't say was that his staff helped create the problem by failing to work with the sponsors before the bill was passed to clean up the language and lower the costs.

Sierra's "Trio Tropical," composed in 1991, made a splendid impression on first hearing.
This Puerto Rican composer is a master of rhythm and atmosphere, gathering Caribbean, Latin American and jazz elements into a classical idiom rooted in Bartok.
In this new piano trio, these diverse sounds intersect within a keenly demarcated frame; the result is a sensuous, ever-shifting musical picture, poised between impressionism and rhythmic modernism.


Vote in Atlanta Suburb Condemns Homosexuality
In a striking example of the emotional politics surrounding homosexual issues, Cobb County in suburban Atlanta has passed a resolution condemning homosexuality and is considering another that would require county-financed arts groups to meet "community, family-oriented standards."
Several communities around the country have passed measures aimed at combating political initiatives by homosexuals, but the resolution approved here -- although it carries no legal weight -- is believed to be the first one condemning homosexuality.

Market Place; A Giant in Managed Care Stubs Its Toe on Other Lines of Insurance.
WITH health care re-emerging as the top issue in Washington and managed-health-care networks spreading like kudzu, this would seem to be a good time for shares of the Cigna Corporation, one of the most sophisticated and successful managed-care insurers.
But Cigna's stock, in fact, is not going much of anywhere; the shares fell $1.375 each yesterday, to $60.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
And this week, the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation downgraded about $1.2 billion of Cigna debt, reminding investors that whatever Cigna's health operations are expected to give, its troubled property-casualty business could take away.

Russia-Japan Relations on the Rocks
Four barren islands in the Kurile chain stand between Russia and Japan.
A reformist Russian Government is reluctant to return them for fear of stirring nationalist reaction at home.
Yet without a commitment to their return, Japan is withholding substantial aid and investment that could propel Russia down the road to reform and recovery.
The impasse is not in America's interest.
Washington wants its longtime ally Japan to regain what is rightfully Japan's, the islands Stalin seized at the end of World War II; and it needs Japanese capital to help Russia's economy.


Bustle of Nationalities in Denver As Young Catholics Await Pope
The streets of this city bustled with the flavor of an international bazaar today as 160,000 Roman Catholics under the age of 40 from 70 nations awaited the arrival of Pope John Paul II on Thursday.
President Clinton will greet the Pope at Stapleton Airport, and the two will be whisked by helicopter to Regis University, where they will talk for about 45 minutes.


PARENT &amp; CHILD
ROBERT BROOKS recalls how one of his sons, then 3 1/2, would put on a cowboy hat and talk about his imaginary life on the range.
The child's fantasies, however, often focused on more mundane issues than cattle drives and rounding up rustlers.
"When my wife or I would tell him to go to bed, he would reply, 'When I was a cowboy, there were no parents to tell me to go to bed,' " said Dr.
Brooks, who is the chief of psychology at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
"That's how he could stand up to us without risking being rejected."

Williams Takes One for the Team . . . in the Head
Bernie Williams can be credited with taking one for the team in tonight's game against Boston.
Williams walked away from a beaning by Roger Clemens secure in the knowledge that he gave as good as he got.
Clemens, arguably one of the fiercest throwers of his time, plunked Williams with the first pitch thrown to the Yankees' center fielder in the third inning.
Williams writhed on the ground for a few frightening moments.
But he continued on in the game -- after he proved that he saw only the allotted amount of fingers being held up by the Yankees' trainer, Gene Monahan, and that he could find his way to first base.

Music Notes; A Reconsideration of Dvorak
The Bard Music Festival in the Mid-Hudson Valley has built a devoted and somewhat scholarly audience by presenting intensive, thematic programming that focuses on a featured composer and his milieu.
Brahms, Mendelssohn and Richard Strauss have been the previous honorees, and this summer -- this weekend and next -- the music of Dvorak will be in the spotlight.
The festival, which is directed by Leon Botstein and Sarah Rothenberg, includes 12 concerts starting tomorrow night, an exhibition of documents and artworks from Dvorak's sojourn in the United States from 1892 to 1895, and four panel discussions that will cover the relationship between music and nationalism, ethnicity in American music, Dvorak's place in musical history, and a survey of the last century of America's musical life.
As in previous years, a collection of essays compiled for the festival will be published by Princeton University Press.
This year's title: "Dvorak and His World."

An Asbestos Company Under the Microscope
Asbestos inspection and removal was a new industry in 1985 when Richard W. Holmes and Jaime A. Escobar formed a company that grew into the multimillion-dollar enterprise called the Envirosafe Corporation.
Eight years later, their corporation is a focus of the investigation into mishandled and possibly fraudulent asbestos testing in the New York City schools.
A network of six affiliated companies headed by Mr.
Holmes and Mr.
Escobar had a mixed performance record even before Envirosafe itself was sharply criticized by city investigators on Friday for incompetence and inexperience in overseeing the school inspections in 1988 and 1989.
But is unclear how large a role Envirosafe played in the inspections.

Scheduled to play one quarter, Montana will put his surgically repaired right elbow through sustained action for only the second time in more than two years.

FETUS OFFERS CLUE ABOUT ARTHRITIS
For decades, doctors have been puzzled over why symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually abate during pregnancy.

Yanks Need Reversal Of Woes on the Road
The Yankees won for the 64th time in 115 games last night, their nifty record and .556 winning percentage suggesting the victory not to be that unusual.
What is unusual is that the triumph came in a ball park other than Yankee Stadium.
The Yankees defeated the Red Sox, 8-3, at Fenway Park, beating no less than Roger Clemens.
It is a victory the traveling Yanks surely needed.
That's because this is a team that will have a hard time permanently leapfrogging the likes of Toronto, Boston and Baltimore if it doesn't turn around what has become a remarkably poor road record.


Midtown Building Is Sold for Lofty $176 Million
A Times Square skyscraper that has stood for months as one of the most potent symbols of the commercial real-estate crisis in New York City was sold yesterday to the Morgan Stanley Group Inc. for $176 million, a price considerably higher than many real-estate insiders had thought it would bring.
The sale reflected more interest in the New York City office-building market than many people had expected, members of the real-estate industry said.
Barry F. Sullivan, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said he thought the purchase could take the Times Square neighborhood "out of the pioneer stage and into the beginning of the long-run growth stage."


Bottlenecks Slow Drive On Asbestos
New York City's School Construction Authority is rushing into the re-inspection of 1,069 schools for asbestos, announcing yesterday that it had brought in four more companies with about 40 teams of inspectors.
But the authority is also facing serious bottlenecks that range from laboratory capacity to procedural decisions.
Meyer S. Frucher, a trustee of the School Construction Authority, said yesterday at a news conference called to reassure the public about the quality of the work that it would be done according to "a very precise protocol, with at least three or four checks and balances." But even as they said that inspectors were working in 128 schools as of yesterday, officials added that the work done over the weekend and early this week will have to be reviewed to see if it was done properly.
The job seems to grow every time the managers take another look.

Pope's New America
For decades, Popes viewed the United States as a steadfast ally against Communism.
Now, as Pope John Paul II makes his first visit to the United States since the end of the cold war, that view has changed.
For the Pope, the United States remains an indispensable part of his vision of a new world order, but maybe an unreliable one.
The Pope, who arrives here on Thursday and will meet with President Clinton in the afternoon, has said he loves the United States.
But he clearly hates some things about it: liberal policies on abortion and what he regards as a culture that is increasingly self-absorbed and self-destructive.
He admires American political institutions and recognizes the power of the American economy, but he has deep doubts about whether this country can measure up to what he sees as its potential and its responsibilities.

Owners Looking Hard At Revenue Sharing
More than 100 major league club owners, lawyers, financial officers and general managers gathered at a sprawling resort here today to try to hammer out a way of sharing a greater portion of their local revenue.
As the meeting day approached the 12-hour mark at midnight, baseball's richer clubs formulated their own plan for increased revenue sharing and sent it to the poorer clubs to consider.
The counterproposal emerged tonight from a four-hour session attended primarily by owners of 10 clubs and their aides.
When that meeting broke up at about 11:40 P.M., some of the people returned to the original meeting room in another building at the American Club to discuss the plan that was a counterproposal to the one presented by Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive.


Pop and Jazz in Review
Geri Allen and Marcus Roberts  Alice Tully Hall
The extended composition is fairly rare in jazz, in part because jazz's generally penurious economic level doesn't allow for the necessary rehearsal time, the additional musicians and the time alone that a musician needs to pull one together.

New York Confronts Its Own Shelter Rule
New York City's new policy on homelessness sounds straightforward: the city will shelter only families who have no adequate place to live, screening out those with apartments of their own or friends or families they can stay with.
But carrying out the new eligibility rules for shelter, approved by state regulators this week, will be anything but simple.
Most of the thousands of families who ask the city for shelter each year are not literally living on the streets with no roof over their heads.
Rather, they are doubled up in cramped apartments with their mothers, aunts, cousins or friends.

A String of Injuries Stuns the Seminoles
Florida State University's quest for its first national football championship was made even more difficult by the loss of two key players today as the result of serious knee injuries.

Tailback Tiger McMillon and free safety Steve Gilmer were injured today, and cornerback Corey Fuller was hurt on Monday.
All are expected to require surgery, according to Dr.

The Clues Left by Vincent Foster
The belated disclosure of an anguished note written by Vincent Foster, the Deputy White House Counsel who took his own life last month, adds a sad, provocative piece of evidence to an individual tale of depression and suicide.
But the Clinton Administration must resist its governing impulse to ignore internal problems of which Mr.
Foster wrote.
And it must avoid the demagogic comfort of lashing out at the press and Washington for destroying a high-minded innocent from Arkansas.
There are lessons in Mr.
Foster's death -- and tasks left uncompleted.
The text of his note, which had been torn into more than two dozen pieces, points the way.
Special investigations need to be mounted in several critical areas singled out by Mr.
Foster.
The Public Integrity Section and the Office of Professional Responsibility of the Justice Department have begun inquiries; these must be kept fully independent of the White House or any of Mr.
Foster's former associates.
But ideally, an independent counsel wholly free from executive branch control needs to be appointed.


Too Much? Well, Royals Call It Home
Framed by thick scarlet draperies, the thrones belonging to Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, sit cozily side by side at the far end of a high-ceilinged hall on the second floor of Buckingham Palace.
The scrunched-up seat cushions show the distinct impressions left by their last visits, and on the high back of each, the royal initials, E.R.
II and P, have been separately embroidered, not unlike monograms on matching "hers" and "his" bath towels.
For those wending their way these days through the palace, parts of which were opened to public view for the first time last week, it is the Throne Room, of all rooms, that offers one of the few reminders that real people still live and work in this monstrously overdecorated royal mansion.
A kind of gilt stage set without actors, its opulent public rooms are stunning to look at, but devoid of a single family photograph, book or personal touch.

Paul Westerberg  Irving Plaza
Paul Westerberg was welcomed like a star by a sold-out house at Irving Plaza last Thursday night.
Shouts greeted him when he walked on stage; a good part of the audience sang along every time he played a song by the band he used to lead, the Replacements.
But neither the audience nor the performers were unaware that Mr.
Westerberg has had no hit records, despite a decade of recognition as one of the best songwriters in rock.
And the frustration lent an extra edge to the show.
Two songs from his new album, "14 Songs" (Sire/Reprise) denounce pop trendiness: "You're sick to death of the latest rage," he groans in "Dice Behind Your Shades." Yet Mr.
Westerberg hasn't soured on subjects like first love or needling the pompous; he's simply hunkered down to rock harder.


Extent of Serbian Pullout Is Unclear
Under the threat of air strikes led by the United States, Serbian leaders have promised repeatedly in recent days to withdraw their forces from two mountains commanding the southern approaches to the Bosnian capital, but confusion continued today about the extent of the withdrawal.
A Western reporter who reached Trnovo, the Serbian-held town that serves as a base camp for the forces on the two peaks, Mount Bjelasnica and Mount Igman, said that he had seen a convoy of buses arriving in the town with Serbian soldiers returning from the front.
The reporter said Serbian officers had told him that 2,500 Serbian troops were being withdrawn, leaving 1,500 troops in position.

Although no details were disclosed, Gilliam, who was waived by the 76ers to make room for their top draft choice, Shawn Bradley, signed what is believed to be a four-year deal worth $7 million.

Millions of Nigerians Stay Home in Protest Campaign
Millions of Nigerians stayed away from work in the country's largest cities today at the start of a three-day campaign of civil disobedience to protest the military Government and its decision to annul last June's presidential elections.
The leaders of the campaign said that the main aim of the protest, which locals called one of the biggest in this West African nation, was to rid Nigeria of military rule rather than to offer support to any particular candidate.
Broad Street, the main business thoroughfare of Lagos, Nigeria's largest city with a population of more than five million, was eerily silent as nearly all banks, shops and even Government offices were closed.
Railway, bus and other public transportation were shut down, and most roads leading into the city, usually congested with traffic and boisterous street traders, were deserted except for police and army patrols.

In a wood relief he carved in 1936, the folk artist Elijah Pierce (1892-1984) depicted the world of his childhood.
It is Sunday in rural Mississippi.
Worshippers greet each other and chat outside a small white church; a gospel quartet sings "Shine on Me" (an emblematic lighthouse stands nearby).
Two farmers in a field enact a biblical proverb about industry and sloth, and the old man in the foreground is the figure of God himself -- or more exactly "de Lawd" from the film "The Green Pastures," which had been released that year.
Many of the ingredients of Pierce's art are here, from autobiography to moral homily to details of the popular culture of his day.
And most important, there is a view of earthly life as a fundamentally benign condition in which the divine and human meet.
"I dream things the way they ought to be," Pierce once said, and throughout the hundred-plus dreamlike works in "Elijah Pierce: Woodcarver" at the Studio Museum in Harlem, a sense of sober but joyous optimism prevails.


AIDS Babies Pay the Price
Each year in New York State some 200 or more newborn babies infected with the AIDS virus leave the hospital without anyone lifting a finger to identify them or care for them.
The babies receive no special treatment for their infections until, months or years later, they develop the first symptoms of their fatal affliction.
How could this happen in a supposedly enlightened community?
The answer is not callousness or carelessness.
The neglected babies are simply the price knowingly paid for what is perceived as a greater good -- protecting the privacy of the mothers and thus enhancing the likelihood that mothers will voluntarily cooperate with the health system, not only in fighting AIDS but in improving overall family health.


Market Place; Sometimes a Great Notion in a Prospectus Is Only That.
FEW things spook investors more than a company that goes insolvent.
After all, earnings are the centerpiece of the stock investment game, and if a public company cannot even meet its financial obligations, investors run for the hills.
But with the gambling mentality of investors in 1993, a private company that is insolvent and is looking to pull itself out of the hole with public investment capital often looks just dandy.
So it was with Hillside Bedding Inc., a retail mattress company based in the Bronx, that went public in February.


Civic Disorder and Liberal Guilt
Of all the neighborhoods of the gorgeous mosaic, Greenwich Village must be one of the gaudiest.
Yet even there a group finds itself under political and cultural siege.
Its members feel that their way of life is scorned and that their protests are mocked and ignored.
Some wonder how long they will be able to hang on.
This group is not the homeless or squatters or some religious sect.
It is the liberal bourgeoisie.
For years, Tompkins Square Park in the East Village was a shantytown.
If you weren't a bum, a beggar or a kid from the suburbs who called himself an anarchist, you feared to go there.
A year ago, after a costly cleanup, the park was reopened.
Today, disorder thrives in the central and West Village.


Orthodox Jews Sue Village on Yeshiva, Asserting Official Bias
Contending that local officials had engaged in a "systematic and discriminatory" campaign over the last year to block their yeshiva from opening, leaders of an Orthodox Jewish school have filed a lawsuit to stop this affluent village from condemning and seizing the property.
Officials of the Hebrew Academy of Long Beach say some of the 450 village residents, many of whom are Jewish, have made no attempt to mask their disdain for Orthodox Jews in opposing the academy's plan to open a yeshiva high school for girls on the site of a former country day school.

Launching Halted at Ignition In Latest Setback for Shuttle
The space shuttle Discovery thundered to life on the launching pad today, spewing flames and white clouds from its main engines, only to lapse into eerie silence as a minor engine flaw stopped the effort just three seconds before the spaceship and its five astronauts were to fly into space.
The danger was high because 800 tons of volatile fuels had begun to burn explosively in the normal process of combustion, not unlike a bomb whose fuse had been lit.
But NASA, poised with a host of safety precautions, quickly drenched the main engines and the rear of the spacecraft with water.


Hertz Appoints a New No. 2 In Management Revamping
The Hertz Corporation, the world's largest rental-car company, named Craig R. Koch, an executive at the company for 22 years, as president and chief operating officer.
Mr.
Koch, 46, was previously the president of the North American Rent-A-Car division, a post that will not be filled under a management revamping at the company, which is based in Park Ridge, N.J.
Instead, the bulk of Mr.
Koch's old responsibilities will be handled by Joseph R. Nothwang, also 46, who takes over as the vice president and general manager of the Hertz United States Rent-A-Car division.


Dollar Takes New Plunge Against Yen
The dollar continued its plunge against the Japanese yen in trading here today, hurtling downward toward an exchange rate of 100 yen to the dollar.
The dollar fell below 102 yen for the first time since modern exchange mechanisms were established after World War II.
It was quoted as low as 101.80 yen early this afternoon before edging up to 102.35 yen later in the day, down 1.02 yen from the close of trading here on Thursday.


Sounds Around Town
Tribute to Monk
Anthony Davis, Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000.
As part of a series of concerts featuring musicians commemorating their muses, Mr.
Davis will perform a tribute to Thelonious Monk.
Mr.
Davis was a highly promising young jazz musician who branched out into other forms of compositions and improvisations; it will be a treat to hear him interpreting Monk, and performing his own pieces that pay homage to the master.
Performance: Sunday at 3 P.M.
Tickets: $6.
Horn Improvisations
Art Farmer, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785.
Mr.
Farmer's group has been a bedrock of the club scene; his visits here a few times a year show off not only his fluegelhorn improvisations, but well-thought-out bands as well.
This band features Jerome Richardson, who was shown by a recent Jimmy Heath's orchestra concert to be a major figure on the saxophone.
Shows through Sunday are at 9 and 11 P.M.
There is a $15 music charge and a $10 minimum.
Piano Grooves
Ahmad Jamal, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, near 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212)255-4037.
Mr.
Jamal and his trio are working on a sort of structural improvisation that really doesn't have much of a precedent in jazz.
Pieces jump around from rhythm to rhythm, groove to groove, key to key.
It's thrilling, and musical, and Mr.
Jamal's piano playing is always graceful and swinging.
Performances: Friday and Saturday at 9:30 P.M., 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. and Sunday at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M.
Tickets: $15, plus a $10 minimum.


Rain Floods Subway Tracks
Heavy rains flooded tracks and halted subway service on four lines in parts of Queens yesterday.
A Transit Authority spokesman said subway service was suspended east of Queens Plaza on the E, F, G and R lines between noon and 4 P.M.

Police Scandal Is Giving Germans an Inside Look at War Against Terrorists
A spectacular police scandal that has broken over Germany is giving people here their first inside look at the clandestine war between the police and terrorists that has been under way in this country for more than 20 years.
The scandal has all the elements of a spy thriller, complete with a top-level informant, a wild shootout at a rural train station and the prospect that two commandos from the country's most famous police squad may soon be charged with murder.


Nader Group Cites 'Redlining' in Study of Lenders
A computer study that matches loans and neighborhoods provides "strong evidence" that many of the nation's major mortgage lenders fail to serve minority areas, Ralph Nader's public interest group said today.
A computerized nationwide study by the Nader group, Essential Information Inc., suggests that 49 mortgage lenders in 16 big cities engaged in racial redlining, a practice in which banks and other lenders avoid making loans in low-income and minority communities.

Restaurants
Whetted by a decade of devotion to Italian cooking, New York City's appetite for sun-kissed flavors has blossomed into a pan-Mediterranean feeding frenzy.
Whether for health reasons or in the restless pursuit of good taste, diners are trooping to local restaurants whose menus -- culled from Provence and Greece and Morocco -- are light on meat, heavy on vegetables, pasta and olive oil.
The aroma from sidewalk falafel stands has become an ambient perfume on many midtown Manhattan street corners.
And now that hummus and baba gannouj have become as much a part of the local food lexicon as pesto, Middle Eastern restaurants have started to lay out the white tableclothes and bid for their share of Mediterranean aficionados.
It's not easy.
Like the best food from all the countries surrounding that mythic sea, eastern Mediterranean cooking is generally simple peasant fare that doesn't lend itself to the stylization and culinary conceit that is synonymous with fine dining in New York.
Italian restaurateurs use Milano-style lighting and polished marble to give their dining rooms style.
The better Greek restaurants evoke the traveler's Aegean.
Middle Eastern restaurateurs, on the other hand, can't lean on wide-scale vacation memories or familiar elements of decor to lure New Yorkers.





Play Clocks Shrink And Rosters Expand
As the National Football League rolls into its second full weekend of preseason games, questions abound about the 1993 season.
We've got answers.


Fairleigh Dickinson to Close Rutherford Campus
Officials of Fairleigh Dickinson University said today that they would close their campus in Rutherford to cut operating costs while spending $27 million for expansion on their other two campuses.
In announcing the plans, the university's president, Francis J. Mertz, also said that Fairleigh Dickinson had just completed its first year with a balanced budget in a decade.
When he was appointed in 1990, Fairleigh Dickinson had a $6.5 million operating deficit and a $32 million debt.


Dinkins Praised by Control Board For Handling of Fiscal Problems
The members of the State Financial Control Board, many of whom have criticized the Dinkins administration in recent months for its handling of New York City's fiscal problems, lavishly praised Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday for promising to take bold action after the mayoral election in November.
The timing was welcome for Mr.
Dinkins, whose main opponent in the mayoral race, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, has stepped up his attacks on what he describes as the Mayor's mismanagement of the city and its fiscal affairs.


Editors' Note
An article yesterday described the isolation felt by AIDS patients in suburban communities on Long Island.
It included a passage about the scarcity of opportunities for gay social life outside of parts of Fire Island and the East End, adding that such social life "largely consists of anonymous assignations" in parking lots and at bars.


Treat Both Prostitutes and 'Johns' as Neighborhood Nuisances
To the Editor:
Your July 28 article on crime in the 47th Precinct in the Bronx states that I "rarely give jail time" in sentencing people convicted of loitering for the purposes of engaging in prostitution, or for prostitution.
This is flatly untrue.
In the hundreds of cases in which I have imposed sentences for both charges over the more than five years I have been sitting in the criminal court in Bronx and New York counties, I have invariably imposed jail sentences of "time served," the equivalent of a sentence of three days' jail.


Trying Out New Image: The Combative Giuliani
Shoulders hunched, his lips pursed, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, punched and swiped at City Hall this week like a shadowboxer chafing to go glove to glove.
After initially holding to a campaign memorable mostly for its positive visions of a future filled with safe streets, good schools and an expanding job base, Mr.
Giuliani suddenly shifted his strategy by relying on a combination of put-downs, cold humor and even a slick background paper on the city's slow demise -- complete with graphs.
By week's end he had painted a vivid picture: that of a Mayor who is out of touch or often out on tennis courts, disengaged from the details of running the nation's largest city and prone to giving unwavering support to inefficient subordinates at badly managed agencies.
Mayor David N. Dinkins, he asserted, has created a government that cannot meet a deadline, is riddled with incompetence and devoid of ideas.


A Dream of Riches Seduces the Middle Class; Trickle-Down Cruelty
To the Editor:
"A Budget That Will Backfire" (Op-Ed, Aug. 6) by John H. Makin of the American Enterprise Institute is shocking and incorrect.
Shocking in his unfailing belief in the feeble school of thought known as "trickle-down economics," and incorrect for the view that trickle-down economics could cure our economic woes.


Critic's Choice; Swinging And Clinging To a High Bar
First it was inclined planes, then springboards.
Now Eliot Feld is into high bars and nets.
In his new "M.R.I.," to be performed tonight and tomorrow night by Feld Ballets/NY at the Joyce Theater, dancers perch, swing from and cling to two horizontal bars eight feet above the stage floor.
They also get a chance to climb a cargo net draped across the exposed-brick back wall of the stage.
Music by Edgard Varese will provide an appropriately knotted, unyielding score for this dance for 16 performers, led by Lynn Aaron and Darren Gibson.
"M.R.I." is named after a term from medical science -- magnetic resonance imaging -- that engaged Mr.
Feld's magpie imagination.


Jordan's Father Is Missing
The police in North Carolina said yesterday that they have been searching for Michael Jordan's father, James Jordan, since learning on Wednesday that a car found stripped in a rural wooded area near the city of Fayetteville a week earlier had been registered to the elder Jordan and that he has not been seen for three weeks.
Sheriff Morris Bedsole of Cumberland County, where the car was found on Aug. 5, said last night that the car, a Lexus SC-400, which had been stripped of its license plates and contained no personal identification, had been linked to Jordan through a check of its vehicle identification number.

The Answer to a Marine Chaplain's Prayer
Three cheers for the Marines!
The Corps said, in a directive that attracted attention this week, that beginning in September 1995 it would enlist only unmarried people.
Too many young married recruits have become a burden to their command.
The directive, long overdue, was the answer to every chaplain's and troop leader's prayer.
But hardly had it hit the streets than Secretary of Defense Les Aspin rescinded it because the Defense Department bureaucracy had not approved it.
Prudently, he later agreed to review marriage issues in all the services.

Sports of The Times; Dark Side Of Jock 'tude Out of Focus
VINCE COLEMAN and Bret Saberhagen are in the public stocks today, heads exposed to the rotten tomatoes hurled from behind columns and out of squawk radio.
Make no mistake, every single SPLAT! is deserved.
Yet, if the Bomber and the Bleacher hang their heads and grin hard enough, they will soon be released and led out of range.
And if they ever start playing up to their salaries, they will be forgiven.
Their crimes, after all, by SportsWorld standards, were crimes of manner, of posture, of attitude, an excess of the very same attitude that lifted them to the major leagues in the first place.


New Twists in Case of a Texan Scheduled to Die
Gary Graham is scheduled to die by lethal injection before dawn on Tuesday, but like so much else about his case, that date is up in the air.

Reporter's Notebook; Despite Rain, Denver Is a Mile High for the Pope
There was rain, thunder and lightning, even a double rainbow in the evening sky.
But the skies could do nothing to compare with the exhilaration that filled Mile High Stadium upon the arrival of Pope John Paul II.
For hours, young Catholics attending the World Youth Day events here this week had been streaming into the stadium, where they swayed, sang, clapped and danced to throbbing music from nations around the world.


Anchors Aweigh For Clitz, Trivia And Miss Liberty
FOR more than 100 years, there has been a single best way to see the Statue of Liberty: from a boat in New York Harbor, standing on a deck crowded with people from different countries all over the world.
When it comes right down to it, you don't really want to be inside the statue; you want to see her from the outside, approaching her by water, watching her grow larger and larger, seeing the torch change from a tiny dot of distant gold to a burning bronze flame.
You want to sail beneath her strange, stern gaze, admire the folds of her gown, shiver at the deadly sharp points of her crown.
The Statue of Liberty is the star attraction of New York City sightseeing cruises.
Sure, there is plenty more to see on a three-hour or a 90-minute trip in the harbor or around the island.
You can look up at the belly of the Brooklyn Bridge as you pass underneath, and cringe at the clatter and screech of heavy passing traffic; you can spy odd or little-known landmarks like the Stadium Motor Lodge, in the shadow of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.
On a rocky and wooded outcropping on the shore of northern Manhattan, you might see people like a woman who stands by herself with her arms outstretched and her face turned to the sky in some kind of anonymous prayer.
When the tourists on the deck of the Circle Line wave to her, as they wave to everyone, she will interrupt her meditation, smile and wave back.


GAP INC. (N)
Profit margins at the Gap Inc. continued to shrink in its second quarter as competitive pressures forced the specialty retailer to cut prices, the company said yesterday.
Donald G. Fisher, the Gap's chairman and chief executive, said higher rents also contributed to a 24 percent decline in earnings for the quarter that ended July 31.
The drop in earnings came despite a 13 percent increase in sales.


Clonmel Journal; Come Cromwell, Come Slump, City Fights Hard
When Oliver Cromwell and his army reached the walls of this quiet valley town in 1650, they met the fiercest resistance of their campaign to enforce English rule in Ireland, losing about 2,000 men.
After that, peace prevailed in Clonmel, which means Vale of Honey in Gaelic, and a happy mix of agriculture and commerce kept the town of 16,000 in Tipperary County one of the most prosperous in the country.


Man Accused of Selling Phony Scout Items
A volunteer worker with the Boy Scouts has been charged in Federal court with selling $2,500 in counterfeit souvenir scout patches during the closing of the 13th National Scout Jamboree here, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.
The volunteer, Michael W. Welsh, 38, a patch maker by trade and former alderman from DeKalb, Ill., was arrested on Monday.
He was caught when a scout leader, an F.B.I. agent, became suspicious as he saw Mr.
Welsh sell unauthorized patches out of a truck with license plates that said PATCHS-1.


Home Video
A Fight for Rights
This week in Washington, a group representing thousands of independent television and video producers again took up a year-old gripe with the Public Broadcasting Service.
As it had last September, the Coalition for Public Television Program Access and Diversity asked PBS to reconsider a policy that, the coalition says, withholds PBS program money from producers who don't sign over video rights to PBS.
This time, though, the coalition charged that PBS Home Video, formed in 1991, was in financial trouble and that some producers had not been paid for their programs.


Muriel R. Carbery, 81, Nursing School Dean
Muriel R. Carbery, a retired nursing school dean and hospital nursing director, died on Tuesday at home in Port Jefferson, L.I.
She was 81.
From 1952 to 1974 Miss Carbery served as the director of the nursing service at New York Hospital.
From 1958 to 1970 held the dual post of dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing.


Baseball Cards: Out of the Pocket And Into the Met
WHEN I was a young yout', as that period in our childhood was referred to back in Chicago, my parents on occasion took me to the Art Institute, to try to teach me to appreciate the finer things in life.
To this day I honor their noble, although mostly futile, attempt.
Greeting us as we entered the Art Institute was a sculpture that my parents quickly dragged me past, but that I caught squarely out of the corner of my eye.
It was a scene that appeared to include a bare-chested Eve and an Adam attired only in his modesty.
The couple was entwined in a way that my tender mind found arresting.
Little did I know, nor my parents even suspect, that in my back pocket were stashed several more art objects.
They were baseball cards.
If I had begun to flip through them in the museum, with all the other arty stuff around, I probably would have received a good rap on the head.


BUSINESS DIGEST
Companies
A New Jersey court approved a plan to rehabilitate the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, the largest life insurer ever to fail in the United States.
Under the plan, the company's 700,000 customers will have full access to their money after a waiting period of up to seven years.  [ Page A1. ]
Shares of T2 Medical plummeted nearly 35 percent after the company said its earnings in the first and second quarters were far lower than previously announced because of "certain accounting irregularities and errors."  [ D1. ]


Finding Therapy and Hope in Gardens: A Place for Quiet Recovery
When Noe Perez entered Bellevue Hospital Center last year, he needed help escaping the alcoholism and drug addiction that had destroyed his life.
He found that help, but not from the science or technology that brought him to the hospital in the first place.
Instead, his salvation came from a gritty, abandoned playground on the outskirts of Bellevue's property, where he coaxes flowers from between the cracks in the asphalt and draws inspiration from a toppled willow tree that refuses to die.


Flood Claims Baby
A 5-month-old baby died yesterday after she apparently drowned in the basement of her Queens home, which became flooded during yesterday's rain, the police said.
The baby's father told the police that the child was sitting in the basement of their house on Holly Avenue in Flushing as water seeped in.
The baby was taken to Flushing Hospital Medical Center at 1:30 P.M. and was pronounced dead an hour later.
The names of the child and her father were not released.
Officer Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said that until the Medical Examiner makes a determination on the cause of death, the police are calling it "a possible drowning." He said it was not clear why the baby was left alone in the basement.


Marine Leader Contritely Admits He Erred on 'Singles Only' Order
In a contrite admission of error, the Commandant of the Marine Corps said today that he was wrong for having "blind-sided" President Clinton by ordering a phase-out in the enlistment of married men and women without first seeking approval from civilian superiors.
The command and communications breakdown surrounding the singles-only enlistment policy, which was reversed by Defense Secretary Les Aspin late Wednesday before it could take effect, underscored a frequent difference between the way high-ranking officers at the Pentagon view an issue and the way that same issue can be viewed by the rest of official Washington.


Cuomo Names Republican To Court of Appeals Seat
After passing him over on six occasions, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo nominated Howard A. Levine, an appellate division judge from Schenectady and a Republican, today to the Court of Appeals, the state's top court.
If confirmed by the State Senate, Justice Levine would take the seat previously held by Judith S. Kaye, whom Mr.
Cuomo promoted to chief judge of the seven-member court earlier this year.
She succeeded Judge Sol Wachtler, a Long Island Republican who resigned last year after being arrested for extortion.


Abroad at Home; The End Of the Affair
The West's worst moral and political disaster since the Nazis is coming to a climax.
And just as many politicians and institutions paid for the failure to stop Hitler, so many will pay dearly for allowing the Serbian tyrant, Slobodan Milosevic, to destroy Bosnia.
George Bush will go down in history as the President who promised a new world order and then undermined it by his own weakness.
The man who rallied the world to save the feudal regime of Kuwait and its oil did nothing to stop the dismemberment of a civilized country in Europe, or the genocide of its people.


Sailing's New Course: Multihulls
The racing multihull has a formidable reputation in sailing, one of lightning speeds and scary rides.
But a less intimidating breed of cruising boat is emerging, one that has become a lifeline for companies foundering in a flat marine market.
Several boat makers have turned from monohull production to building catamarans, which are sailboats with two hulls, and trimarans, which have three hulls.

An article on Aug. 4 about New York state's hospital reimbursement system misidentified Medicare.

Review/Rock; Looking Back To Beatles
Rock music evolves so fast that traditionalism is only a matter of 20 or 30 years of hindsight.
The Odds and the Woodies, two bands on a triple bill at the Grand on Wednesday night, happily look back to the Beatles, a band whose style is so regularly revived -- by the Raspberries in the early 1970's and Squeeze well into the 1980's, among many others -- that it's easy to forget how many different strands of music the Beatles pulled together and twisted.
The trick is to recapture the relative innocence of the mid-1960's without sounding too naive or self-conscious.
Both the Odds and the Woodies write melodic, generally midtempo pop songs with unexpected chromatic twists and carefully placed bits of vocal harmony.
But the Odds, from Vancouver, are far less archival.
Drawing on Squeeze as much as on the Beatles, the band plays concise arrangements, often with bass, drums and guitar in crisp unison, their low-slung chords making plenty of room for the vocals.
From both Squeeze and the Beatles, the Odds learned to match genial melodies to slightly barbed lyrics.


Marine Madness
O.K., this clinches it.
It's the water in the Potomac River.
That water goes into reservoirs around Washington.
Some of it reaches Congress and we get the Federal budget.
Some is obviously affecting the people in charge of President Clinton's image.
And most clearly, a big dose of eau de Potomac has been imbibed by senior Marine Corps officers sitting in front of word processors in the Pentagon.
So the Marine generals decide they will take only unmarried recruits.
This is too rich.
Even the Roman Catholic Church is thinking that a singles-only recruiting policy has not worked all that well.


Study to Examine Bones From Blacks' Burial Site
Interred as chattel and forgotten for hundreds of years, the slaves whose remains were unearthed from a landmark burial ground in lower Manhattan is soon to be the subject of an extensive study that should provide a window onto the lives of the first black Americans -- and, officials hope, inspiration to their descendants.
The Federal authorities said yesterday that the bones from more than 400 bodies recovered from the burial ground would be taken to Howard University in Washington, where teams of anthropologists and other scientists would try to determine the origins and lifestyles of those buried there.


There's Bounce-Back In Those Pinstripes
If the Yankees are proving adept at one thing, it's making timely recoveries.
They avoided disaster last week against the Toronto Blue Jays by winning two straight games after losing the first two of the series at Yankee Stadium.
That kept their deficit in the American League East manageable at one game behind Toronto.


Running Man: Lewis Just Keeps Going and Going
Carl Lewis is 32 years old and on the down side of his spectacular career.
His injured back still bothers him.
He has run nine races this year and won only once.
So why does he think he will run well in the world outdoor track and field championships, which begin here Saturday?
Why does he think he can win in the 100-meter and 200-meter dashes when he is the favorite in neither?


The Lazy Days of Summer Are Met Head-On


After the Deluge, Flood Victims Find Drudgery and Heartache
A month has passed since the Raccoon River invaded Sandra and Ben Elliott's well-kept split-level home here, filling the first floor with four feet of murky misery and sending the couple fleeing into the night.
Once they returned 48 hours later to inspect the damage and begin reclaiming their modest piece of the American dream, their initial urge was to pack up and run away forever.

George A. Kochevitsky, a concert pianist and music teacher, died on Tuesday at his home.
He was 90, and lived in Manhattan.
The author of two books on pianism, Mr.
Kochevitsky continued to write and act as a consultant for performing artists until his health began to fail several months ago.


Serbian Forces Fail to Meet U.N. Withdrawal Deadline
Serbian forces besieging Sarajevo allowed a mid-morning deadline set by United Nations peace negotiators to pass today without complying with demands that Serbian troops be withdrawn from two strategic mountains overlooking Sarajevo.
But negotiators in Geneva said the Serbs had agreed to binding arbitration on the issue on Friday, and the threat of NATO air strikes against the Serbs was not fulfilled.
As dusk fell on the Bosnian capital, Serbian troops remained at front-line positions on Mount Igman, the lower of the two mountains, where Serbian forces pose the most direct threat to Sarajevo.
Most of the withdrawals that Serbian commanders said they had made appeared to have taken place from around Mount Bjelasnica, a 6,800-foot peak to the southwest of Mount Igman, or from territory still farther away from Sarajevo that was not directly involved in the United Nations demands for a Serbian troop pullback.

Review/Art; At the Whitney, Provocation and Theory Meet Head-On
"Abject Art" and "The Subject of Rape" are the latest in the series of annual exhibitions organized by students in the Whitney Museum of American Art's Independent Study Program.
Relegated in the past to the museum's branch galleries, now defunct, the students' exhibitions this year fill the second floor of the Whitney itself.
Even in this high-profile venue, though, the atmosphere of the seminar room hangs heavy in the air.
Both shows give evidence of an instinct for provocation, but their reliance on off-the-rack academic theory and an all-purpose, in-your-face 90's pique keeps their impact low.
This is especially true of "Abject Art," a potential wild card of a show, which strikes some sparks but never manages either to define or to transcend its fashionably melodramatic title.
"Abject art" is a term suggested by the theoretician Julia Kristeva to designate art based on the image of the human body, but specifically the body fragmented and decayed or represented by one of its socially less presentable functions (scatological images, for example, abound in the show).
In depicting what most people would rather not see, the theory goes, art breaks through societal taboos, especially those surrounding sexuality.

Circle Line is a floating landmark, the Empire State Building of the water, as New York as subway crime, Central Park carriage rides and maniac taxi drivers.
ITINERARY: A three-hour cruise that entirely circles Manhattan Island: south from Pier 83; down along the financial district; past the Statue of Liberty and Governors Island; under the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges; past midtown and the Upper East Side; north through the Harlem River and around the northern tip of the island, and back south under the George Washington Bridge to Pier 83.
DOCK ENVIRONMENT: The pier, situated next to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, has a vaguely institutional feel: all cement and cinder block, with little speakers that look as if they date from the 50's piping in elevator music as you board.
Along 12th Avenue, vendors are hustling naive tourists with cheap knock-off T-shirts and assorted unnecessary objects.
BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT: "Good afternoon, and a beautiful afternoon it is!"
DECOR: Not too fancy, but not too shabby, either.
Two decks with indoor and outdoor seating, a couple of portholes, white plastic chairs that can be moved around, a wooden dance floor area and industrial carpeting that is guaranteed to be strewn with popcorn by the end of the tour.
PASSENGERS: The teeming masses of the world.
Dozens of languages are being spoken on all sides, which adds to that New York international and cosmopolitan flavor.
Everyone is jumping up and taking pictures; everyone waves at passing ships or landlubbers on the shore.
And who can resist a boatful of happy tourists?
People always wave back, whether they're shirtless men on speedboats, rich folks on their private yachts, fellow day-trippers on the Liberty Island Ferry or dock workers in tank tops lolling over pier railings.
TOUR GUIDE: A leftover from the 1950's lounge circuit.
Wearing white pants, a navy blazer, a white shirt with the collar out and Wallabes, with slicked-back gray hair and a face that was a cross between Anthony Quinn and a Frank Sinatra acolyte, this fellow was truly a relic of another New York.
Between hawking guide books ("It's got over 30 pages and 50 photos, and it's only $3 -- what a bargain!"), offering statistics ("27,000 tons of garbage go out from New York City every day") and enlightening his audience with descriptions of famed architecture ("The Empire State Building was the last hangout of King Kong -- remember him?"), he tossed off a series of jokes that were probably already familiar in the vaudeville era.
At one point, he even invoked the grandaddy of painful punsters: "Henny Youngman once said, 'I knew a girl who had so much bridge work, to kiss her you had to pay a toll.' " Sometimes he would go off on inexplicable tangents; you'd tune out for a second, looking at the Woolworth Building, and suddenly he'd be giving the ages of George Burns and Bob Hope.
"Guess getting older's not too bad, when you consider the alternative," he mused.
He listed some famous people who died at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (Andy Warhol, Yul Brynner).
Then things took a further metaphysical turn.
"In the next 8 or 10 years there's going to be a dramatic change in the world's weather," he said somewhere near Inwood.
"You'll see. You youngsters who are young now, I feel sorry for you." He also does birthday and anniversary announcements.
During the intermission, women swarmed around him, begging for dedications.
Forget the United Nations building: this guy alone is worth the price of admission.
Like the Circle Line itself, he's a New York classic.
CREW: They also seem to be aspiring entertainers.
One twinkle-eyed, lean young fellow looked at me askance when I asked for a receipt at the lunch counter.
He wrote one out and handed it over.
"I signed it Drake Quack," he said proudly.
"He wants to be famous," explained a female co-worker.
Now he is.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Statue of Liberty: it is impossible not to be awed and moved by her splendor.
She seems to turn her head and gaze at you as you sail past, dignified and fraught with an elusive, Mona Lisa-like melancholy.
"The greatest lady in the land," said the announcer.
"Except for my wife."
LOW POINTS: Somewhere after the Williamsburg Bridge, a strange, heavy lull begins to set in.
Face it, there's not much to look at on the east side except a lot of hospitals, housing projects and Con Ed plants on the Manhattan side, and burned-out warehouses and wharfs in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
People started to conk out.
They were lying back in their chairs with their legs stuck out and their mouths open, as if they were home in their easy chairs in front of a ball game.
Even the announcer began to lose steam and mumble a lot.
He seemed to be desperate for landmarks.
"On the right here we have piles of salt!" he said with forced enthusiasm.
MOST ARCANE TIDBIT OF INFORMATION: There is enough wire in the cables of the George Washington Bridge to go around the world four times.
Runner-up: Did you know that Dean Martin was going to be a lawyer, but he couldn't pass the bar?
FOOD: Tasty hot dogs (mmmm-mmmm), soft-serve ice cream, marble pound cake, Budweiser on draft.
PHOTO OP: A photographer takes pictures of every party that boards; the glossy prints are for sale ($10 each) after you debark.
HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LEAVE: After three hours, you can't wait to get off the thing.
But you are, nevertheless, sated and gladdened by this quintessential New York experience.
World Yacht
Leaving from Pier 81, Hudson River and 41st Street, Manhattan, (212) 630-8100.
Daily dinner cruises from 7 to 10 P.M., boarding at 6 P.M., Sundays through Thursdays, $62; Fridays and Saturdays, $69.50.
COMPANY MOTTO: "Elegant Dining Afloat." The bizarre grammatical structure of this statement somehow manages to conjure the image of a plate of food bobbing in a bathtub.
BOAT: Duchess of New York, a three-tiered yacht with two large, enclosed dining area, a lower outside deck with cocktail tables and chairs, and a roomy, open upper deck with patio chairs that you can pull right up to the railing.
OVERALL EXPERIENCE: The Love Boat of sightseeing cruises.
It's upper-crusty and just a tiny bit snooty, like a semi-fancy dinner party on the water.
No jeans are allowed; men must wear jackets.
If the television show "Love Connection" came to New York, this is where all the contestants would take their dates to impress them.
ITINERARY: A three-hour cruise that heads south from Pier 81 and under the very nose of the Statue of Liberty, timed to happen right at dusk; then up the East Side, turning around after the Manhattan Bridge and coasting back around the lower tip of the island.
DOCK ENVIRONMENT: There's valet parking and lots of wealthy international businessmen wandering around with their coiffed and gowned wives and dates.
After the ride, aggressive limousine and town car drivers are hanging around to take advantage of naive or tipsy debarking tourists.
BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT:Very efficient and professional: safety procedures, locations of life jackets.
DECOR: Elegant in a Hyatt ballroom kind of way: the dining areas have large windows to allow for spectacular views, the tablecloths are crisp and white, the drinks come with swizzle sticks.
Faux Art Deco lighting fixtures give a soft, peachy glow.
A jazz trio, switching off with a singing pianist playing pop standards, is set up in front of a dance floor in the lower dining area.
PASSENGERS: A Whitney Houston lookalike in a floor-length royal blue velvet halter gown; tons of dark suits; a middle-aged woman wearing Roman-style sandals with multi-colored laces that wound halfway up her calves.
Couples on birthday dates made up no fewer than three tables in my vicinity, and there were clusters of young people celebrating heaven knows what.
Champagne corks pop, and the dining rooms eventually build to a boistrous din.
TOUR GUIDE: Don't be gauche.
The only time an announcer comes on is to inform passengers that the Statue of Liberty is approaching on the starboard side.
Like, thanks.
I mean, it's kind of hard to miss.
Then the piano player sings "America the Beautiful" and "God Bless America" really loud.
CREW: The waiters and waitresses are pleasant, though with a tendency to be overly solicitous.
HIGHLIGHTS: The sunset, and the lighting of Manhattan.
As you sail up the East River, the evening wans into pale twilight; by the time you've turned around and headed back south again, the lights on the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges have come on, and all of downtown has begun to glow pink and gold.
The Statue of Liberty shone against a sky burnt and streaked with fiery red, orange and violet; the harbor was like spilled red paint.
Throughout the cruise, passengers are allowed to roam at will; you can pull up a chair, prop your feet on a railing and sink back in bliss in the hot summer night.
Faintly now, a song comes through the sound system, a romantic lyric from a gorgeous old standard like "At Last": "My heart was wrapped up in clover/The night I looked at you." This is the brilliance of the World Yacht: it allows you to buy a temporary ticket to the privileged class.
LOW POINTS: After coffee and dessert are served, the band kicks into 60's and 70's frat party standards, like "Mustang Sally" and "Takin' Care of Business." People get loud and annoying and start singing along.
MOST ARCANE TIDBIT OF INFORMATION: Two fluffy-haired blondes discussing whether the Twin Towers are really twins.
FOOD: Snacky hors d'oeuvres adorn each table when you board.
Appetizers include goat cheese salad and seafood pastry; entrees include a Fulton Fish Market selection of the day.
And for dessert, the chocolate and raspberry layer cake rules.
PHOTO OP: Same deal as the Circle Line: a photographer takes pictures of your party as you board, then a hostess brings the picture to your table and you are given the option of buying it for $10 each.
HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LEAVE: Quite fulfilled, but glad to get away from that frat party before it gets any more out of hand.
Seaport Circle Line
Leaving from Pier 16, South Street Seaport, lower Manhattan, (212) 563-3200.
Daily sightseeing cruises at 11 A.M. and 1, 3 and 5 P.M.
Tickets: $12 each ($11 for the elderly; $10 for students; $6 for children 2 to 12).
COMPANY MOTTO: "America's Favorite Boat Ride." The sequel
BOAT: There's a reason the boats are distinguished only by Roman numerals: they're all alike.
OVERALL EXPERIENCE: The Circle Line just recently took over the South Street Seaport cruise, so the general situation is much the same.
The major difference is that this ride is only 90 minutes, which fortuitously cuts out that borderline tedious stretch of upper Manhattan.
ITINERARY: From Pier 16 the boat heads south, then west around the lower tip of Manhattan, sailing north on the Hudson about as far as Greenwich Village; then it turns around, and does the Statue of Liberty thing.
Then it's back up the East River to just below the Empire State Building before returning to South Street.
DOCK ENVIRONMENT: Pier 17, an indoor mall with shops and restaurants, is right next door; the lightship Ambrose and the schooner Pioneer are docked nearby.
BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT: "We're going to ask you to help us out here. Please don't throw anything overboard."
DECOR: Same plastic white chairs, same concession stand with food and souvenir goodies, same industrial carpeting with popcorn spilled on it.
PASSENGERS: A bit more low-key and easy-going than those on the regular Circle Line.
You kind of get the feeling they came to South Street Seaport to shop and buzz around, and then happened to see the sign for the cruise.
Because it's only 90 minutes, it's much less of a commitment.
TOUR GUIDE: Much more restrained than his uptown counterpart, although he seems to date from the same era: he has a 1950's television announcer vibe to him, earnest and deadpan and slightly nerdy.
CREW: They don't want to be famous, they're just doing their job.
HIGHLIGHTS: You just can't see the Statue of Liberty too many times.
LOW POINTS: Like the other Circle Line announcer, this guide seemed to be slightly at war with the modern world.
When the Staten Island Ferry went by, he couldn't help remarking: "For years the ferry was 5 cents. Gone up like everything else. It's now 50 cents." Like that's a rip-off.
Hey, buddy, your boat costs 12 smackeroos.
MOST ARCANE TIDBIT OF INFORMATION: The sculptor Bartoli fashioned the face of the Statue of Liberty after his father's.
FOOD: There's a reason everybody's buying that popcorn: it's darn good.
Freshly popped on board, and all hot and buttery.
PHOTO OP: No, but disposable cameras are for sale at the concession stand.
HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LEAVE: Sunlit and invigorated.  Port Imperial Harbor Cruise
Leaving from Port Imperial, Weehawken, N.J., (800) 533-3779.
Sailings Mondays through Sundays at 10:30 A.M., 1:30 and 4 P.M.
Tickets: $12 for adults, $6 for children. (Tours also leave from the line's Manhattan terminal on West 38th Street.)
COMPANY MOTTO: Doesn't have one yet, and somehow "New Jersey's Favorite Boat Ride" doesn't do it justice.
BOAT: Robert Fulton, a 97-foot ferry that is smaller than its big-city counterparts.
OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Really fantastic.
The Port Imperial cruise hits the perfect balance of history, education, human interest and fun.
Since it's fairly new, it isn't overrun with crowds: you can sit wherever you want and move around to other seats in enclosed or open-air sections.
ITINERARY: A 90-minute ride that leaves Weehawken and then picks up passengers from Port Imperial's Manhattan terminal before sailing back down the New Jersey side, closely hugging the shore to allow a great view of landmarks like Ellis Island and the gorgeous railway terminals in Hoboken and Liberty State Park; south around Governors Island and past the Statue of Liberty; up the east side along the Brooklyn shore as far as the Brooklyn Bridge, and back south and around lower Manhattan.
DOCK ENVIRONMENT: Beautifully landscaped and meticulously tended on both the Jersey and New York sides, with bursts of marigolds and flowering trees.
BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT: Well, there are still a few kinks in the system.
The public address system wasn't working properly at first.
An energetic woman in flowing brown pants and a print shirt, with red combs and blue bows in her graying hair, jumped out and explained the route without amplification.
She said someone named Dennis was going to fix the P.A., and a swarthy man in the pilot room said, "Test, test, test," and everything was fine.
DECOR: Spic and span white metal benches, plastic zip-open windows.
Everything is so clean that if you spill a drop of coffee or lose a napkin, you instinctively pick up after yourself.
And the crew tends to the boat as if it were their own home.
Not once but twice Dennis was puttering around the deck with a dustpan and broom.
PASSENGERS: Friendly but quiet and attentive.
White-haired men in slacks and suspenders, well-behaved children.
The only sourpuss was an old fellow in a straw hat who complained to his wife that he was cold and why hadn't she told him to bring his jacket.
TOUR GUIDE: After the P.A. was fixed, the energetic woman introduced herself as Wilma.
She related details about the architecture on both sides of the river: the history of the Maxwell House coffee plant in Hoboken, the New Jersey shipyards and dock industry.
She particularly enjoyed pointing out interesting architectural juxtapositions, and offered idiosyncratic criticisms on the subject.
For example, cruising around lower Manhattan, she pointed out side-by-side ferry terminals, one designed in the ornate turn-of-the-century style and currently used by the Coast Guard, and the other in a more modern tile design for the Staten Island Ferry.
"The Staten Island terminal was designed in green to resemble the oxidation of the older terminal," she explained.
"I always say that it looks to me like a car wash." Furthermore, she shared the most amazing things: that Ellis Island was used as a place to execute pirates, or that excavation from the construction of the New York subway system was used to build up Governors Island.
She became quite excited when we encountered a fire boat display off lower Manhattan.
"It's a rare thing to see," she said reverently, as the boat sprayed tall, arching streams of water into the air.
"It's the first time I've ever seen it in person." Plus she had a sense of humor, and pointed out some nude bathers on a pier in TriBeCa.
CREW: Dennis wins the Sightseeing Cruise Employee of the Month award.
HIGHLIGHTS: Really, this cruise was a pleasure from beginning to end.
When we passed the exclusive North Cove in Battery Park, Wilma said drily, "Perhaps some of you left your yachts here when you came in?"
LOW POINTS: No complaints here.
MOST ARCANE TIDBIT OF INFORMATION: The Burger King on Governors Island serves beer.
FOOD: O.K., the food left something to be desired: just bags of chips and pretzels, coffee, etc.
Give them time.
PHOTO OP: This cruise is hype-free.
HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LEAVE: You are actually, honestly making plans to come back and bring friends.
Amid Dennis's cheerful banter and Wilma's edifications, with the sun dancing on the water and the warm summer wind blowing in from the sea, even the sourpuss had to smile.


Kohl's Corp. reports earnings for Qtr to July 31


Heirs of the Golden Horde Reclaim a Tatar Culture
Five hundred miles from Moscow, sitting prettily on the Volga River, is the point where Russia's history and its current politics most sharply intersect.
The Tatars, a Turkic people whose medieval khanate held Russia under "the Mongol-Tatar yoke" for almost three centuries, lost their empire when Ivan the Terrible captured Kazan in 1552 and absorbed Tatarstan into Holy Russia.
Ivan built St.
Basil's Cathedral just outside the Kremlin walls in Moscow to commemorate the victory.


Owners Take Steps To Prevent A Strike
After a second day of marathon meetings, major league club owners tonight failed to reach agreement on the thorny issue of revenue sharing, but they took steps to remove the players' primary reasons for following through on their threat to strike next month.
After 28 hours of plotting, calculating and negotiating, two groups of owners adjourned without resolving their differences over how to get the richer clubs to help their poorer brethren.


Public Park Is Too Private to Suit the Government; Eastchester Charges Too Much for Use of a Former Country Club, Federal Officials Say
With its 18-hole golf course, five pools, eight tennis courts and cavernous banquet hall, Lake Isle Park would seem to be an enviable example of what a public recreation area can be.
But Federal park officials say that this Westchester County town, which bought Lake Isle in 1979, is operating the park like the country club it once was.
Seasonal permits for the use of the park cost Eastchester families $1,575 and families from out of town $3,150, and National Park Service officials say that excludes poor people, particularly minority residents of neighboring communities.
Though many towns try to reserve their parks and beaches for the use of their residents, Federal officials say Lake Isle's rates are excessive to the point of discrimination.


A Dream of Riches Seduces the Middle Class
To the Editor:
The headline on "The Would-Be Rich vs. the Truly Rich" (Op-Ed, Aug. 6) by James Grant, publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, inadvertently highlights the endemic upward mobility that has deposited him and many other upper-income -- but not rich -- Americans on the wrong side of the debate about the Clinton economic package.


What Customers Can Expect

From Uncle Smoke to Mr. Clean
At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last summer everyone knew who the heroes and villains were.
Environmentalists and foreign diplomats decried failures by the U.S. contingent and praised European leadership.
But since then, as the few people who have observed the fate of the Rio accords are aware, almost everything about the treaty has been stood on its head.
At Rio, the European Commission, representing Western Europe as a bloc, wanted a legally binding treaty that required each country's emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, to be stabilized at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The Bush Administration opposed a binding pact, saying that each country should set reduction goals.

Producer Prices Fell 0.2% in July
The Government released reports today showing a weak economy in which inflation has continued to abate and retail sales have grown sluggishly.
That kind of "no news" is good news these days for bond investors and Administration officials counting on low interest rates to keep the recovery going.
Producer prices slipped two-tenths of a percent in July, the Labor Department reported today, after declining three-tenths of a percent in June.
The falling prices charged by manufacturers and farmers offered further evidence that the inflationary pressures that were worrying the Federal Reserve this spring are unwinding and signaled that the floods in the Midwest had not unleashed much inflation.


COURT BACKS PLAN TO PAY CUSTOMERS OF FAILED INSURER
A plan to rehabilitate the largest life insurance company ever to fail in the United States was approved yesterday by a New Jersey court.
Under the plan, the 700,000 customers of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company will have full access to their money after a waiting period of up to seven years.
Unless it is delayed by legal appeals, the plan will finally give some sense of certainty to customers around the nation.
The Newark-based insurer was taken over by the State of New Jersey in July 1991 after it became insolvent.


Diner's Journal
East Coast Outlet
Madeo, an Italian restaurant at 47 West 55th Street in Manhattan, is the second restaurant from the Los Angeles area to open on 55th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas.
It is just down the block from Michael's, the New York branch of Michael McCarty's Santa Monica establishment.
The original Madeo is in Forte dei Marmi, the coastal Tuscan town that Bruno Vietina, the owner of the Madeo restaurants in America, and the chefs in New York, Paolo Celeste and Alessandro Cherubini, once called home.
The New York Madeo took over the handsome if somewhat stark terra cotta-colored space previously occupied by Eldorado Petit, a Catalan restaurant from Barcelona, and turned the two rooms into a more traditional setting, done in white with touches of blue.
Highlighting a menu of appetizers ($7 to $18), pasta dishes ($14 to $18) and main courses ($18 to $26) are several commendable items grilled over wood, like delectable fresh langoustines and sliced sirloin steak.
The pastas and risottos range from satisfying (risotto with porcini) to unusual (veal ravioli in a rich walnut sauce) to pedestrian (linguine with pesto sauce).
Several dishes boast perfectly cooked white beans, but excessively hot plates keep some of the food cooking long after it is served.


Review/Theater; Basketball as a Metaphor for the Game of Life
Theater for the New City has been touring the boroughs with its summer street program since the late 1960's, and it still exudes a strong whiff, as identifiable as sandalwood incense, of the decade that spawned it.
Founded by George Bartenieff and Crystal Field, longtime fixtures of the Greenwich Village arts scene, the company mixes blatantly homemade sets, costumes that might have come from the bargain bins at Canal Jeans, quasi-Brechtian didacticism and a do-your-own-thing style of performance.
These elements are shaped into a noisy theater of protest that blends right into the curmudgeonly hubbub of the New York streetscape in its dog days.
The results are crude, chaotic and preachy, but everyone involved seems to be having a lively time.

In a Standoff, Yeltsin Threatens Opponents With an Early Election
Looking for a way to break out of a tense political standoff, President Boris N. Yeltsin warned his legislative opposition today that he was prepared to call early parliamentary elections this fall, whether the members wanted them or not.
Such a step could force Russia into another constitutional crisis since the President now lacks the authority to dissolve the Parliament on his own, and the Parliament -- whose term is supposed to end in 1995 -- is increasingly inclined to hang onto its seats until next spring at the earliest.


Doctors Say a New Cholera Poses a Worldwide Danger
A new strain of cholera sweeping across India and Bangladesh at an alarming rate has spread to Thailand and threatens to cause a global epidemic of the diarrheal illness, health officials and other experts reported yesterday.
Cholera is spread primarily through contaminated water and poor sanitation.
In the United States, one non-fatal case of the new cholera has been reported, in Los Angeles, in a woman who became infected in India.
The new strain is not seen as a major public health problem in the United States, where only rare cases of the older strains of cholera have been reported in recent years, though epidemics occurred in the last century.


Judge Rules in Lotus's Favor
In a major blow to Borland International Inc., a Federal judge in Boston ruled today that a feature in current versions of the company's Quattro Pro spreadsheet software program infringed copyrights held by the Lotus Development Corporation of Cambridge, Mass.
Borland, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., said it would appeal the decision.


Sentence in King Case
To the Editor:
I found "Sympathetic Judge Gives Officers 2 1/2 Years in Rodney King Beating" (front page, Aug. 5), on the trial of Sgt.
Stacy C. Koon and Officer Laurence M. Powell, biased.
The headline states that the judge was sympathetic; rather, the judge's position indicates the flawed justice system, where there are two tiers of justice, one for whites and the other for people of color.


Unico American
The Unico American Corporation, an insurance holding company dealing primarily with small businesses through its Crusader Insurance unit, posted a first-quarter profit, in contrast to a loss a year earlier because of claims related to the Los Angeles riots.
Property-casualty premiums have risen 55 percent since California moved to shut down some 250 unlicensed insurers.

Now, Canada Objects on Trade Pact
Canadian concerns have emerged as a sticking point for the first time in the negotiation of side agreements for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Prime Minister Kim Campbell has rejected a compromise crafted by her own negotiators on labor and environmental safeguards for the accord, apparently resisting giving import-blocking power to United States companies that could be used against Canada.
Analysts also said she was taking the tough stance partly for domestic political reasons.


Steel Decision Will Cost American Jobs
To the Editor:
In "A Wise Decision on Steel" (editorial, July 29), you maintain that it is good for the economy and Americans that the domestic steel industry lost its trade cases against subsidized and dumped foreign steel products.
Lower costs, you state, will help makers of "everything from baseball cleats to automobile parts."


Lawmakers' Legal Aid Society: Rich Donors
Though he is a man of modest means, Senator Bob Packwood hired one of Washington's priciest law firms in his effort to fend off the Ethics Committee's sexual-harassment inquiry that could lead to his censure or even expulsion from the Senate.
Mr.
Packwood can afford the services of the law firm, Arnold &amp; Porter, because he is the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee and can count on friends with thick wallets.


Lead Removal Planned
Westchester County officials and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency today agreed to a plan to remove lead from the soil at a county-owned shooting range in Cortlandt.
Environmentalists contend that spent ammunition left by hunters shooting at clay pigeons at the Sportsman Center poses a danger to children and wildlife as lead seeps into the groundwater, ponds and marshes of the Blue Mountain Reservation, a 1,500-acre county preserve surrounding the 300-acre shooting range.

The final chapter to BILL ROBINSON's storybook season at the Meadowlands will be tonight's $747,700 Woodrow Wilson Pace final, a race in which the 46-year-old trainer will showcase three of the top 2-year-old horses in his stable.
On the last night of the harness season in East Rutherford, N.J., Robinson, who has already set meet records for earnings and winning percentage and a personal best for victories at the track, will unleash Armbro Mackintosh, the 5-2 favorite leaving from post 2, Expensive Scooter, the 3-1 second choice leaving from Post 5, and Pacific Rocket, the 5-1 fourth choice leaving from Post 4.
Million to One, the 7-2 third choice trained by HARRY POULTON, will leave from the rail.


Books of The Times; Trekking With a Star in a Television Wasteland
Artistic Differences By Charlie Hauck 238 pages. William Morrow &amp; Company. $21.
"Artistic Differences," with a title meaning either "I quit" or "you're fired" in Hollywoodese, is a caustically funny account of star temperament within the world of network television.
The novelist, Charlie Hauck, clearly knows his terrain.
As a consequence of having variously written, produced and created seven half-hour comedy series (among them "The Associates") and living "in Los Angeles, about 10 blocks from Michelle Pfeiffer" (according to the jacket copy), Mr.
Hauck keenly appreciates the rules of the game.
"Never let the star know that there are other people in the world" is one of the helpful hints his story provides.


Pope Challenges President's Stance on Abortion
Pope John Paul II publicly registered his opposition today to President Clinton's stand on abortion and challenged Americans to revive "a high moral vision" to guide their lives at home and their leadership abroad.
In their first face-to-face encounter, the two leaders greeted each other warmly on the tarmac at Stapleton International Airport here, just after the Pope arrived.
It was his third major journey to the United States, which he said he was revisiting "with special joy."


CHRONICLE
HEIDI FLEISS is planning to head to California today.
No, not that Heidi Fleiss, the one accused of running a high-priced prostitution ring catering to Hollywood's elite; she's already there.
The en route Heidi Fleiss is a chiropractor with offices on East 55th Street in Manhattan, and she's been having a jolly time the past few weeks.
Friends and people she hasn't seen for years call and greet her with, "We thought we knew you, but now we know we don't." Some of her patients have taken to calling her -- in jest, of course -- "Dr. Madam."
Dr.
Fleiss, who is married and has a 3-year-old son, is going to California for vacation.
She describes herself as "not conservative but not what comes across as feminine and sexual; I'm thin and athletic."


Demand for 30-Year Bond Turns Weak
It could not have been a better warmup for a Treasury auction.
The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods fell two-tenths of 1 percent in July, providing a little better inflation news than expected, and retail sales came in just up a barely noticeable one-tenth of 1 percent.
This left the Treasury selling 30-year bonds at a time when new data reassured traders, investors and speculators that inflation was in check, and that economic growth would not pick up enough to awake worrisome inflationary fears any time soon.


Reviews/Film; A Yuppie Haunted (Really) By Other People's Problems
"Heart and Souls," a whimsical film that could raise the dead for the wrong reasons, has the cute idea of bringing together four bus passengers and a pregnant woman for a fatal crash.
The souls of the dead enter into the body of the woman's newborn baby, paving the way for all manner of supernatural high jinks.
Whoever thought this premise was a good idea also thought it would be fun to have each dead person use the baby, once he grows up to be a yuppie named Thomas Reilly (Robert Downey Jr.), as a vehicle for settling one unresolved problem apiece.
When the film announces, halfway through, that it will be devoting the rest of its running time to tying up these loose ends, the audience may as well give up the ghost.


Defensive Line Lifeline: Fox to Show
The Giants could soon get some much needed help on the defensive line since defensive end Mike Fox has apparently agreed to terms and will be in camp on Friday.
But chances are he won't play in Saturday's preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
"I've always wanted to get there and play," said Fox during a telephone interview from his Ohio home as he was literally packing his bags.
"I'm ready to go. I think it was a pretty good deal."

A Retro Motel for the New Age
MY eyes open to blinding light.
Tile floor, stainless-steel sink, blank white walls with exposed bulbs.
Is it a hospital?
Maybe I've broken something.
I wiggle my toes.
Still in one piece.
O.K., now I know.
It's my college dorm room.
This is the dream where I've just slept through my chemistry final and now I'll never graduate.
A woman sleeps near me, although she doesn't look like my roommate.
Actually, she looks like me.
It's my mom, who happens to be great at chemistry.
A good dream!
She took the test for me so I could sleep.
What a pal.


Wave of Indecision Roils Clinton's Vacation Plans
Congress has gone home, everybody on the staff is dog-tired and on edge, and there is little left to justify workaholic tendencies in a town where vacationers have been racing to the exits for weeks.
What's a President to do?
For Bill Clinton, answering that question has been more difficult than anyone expected.
Or for those who have grown used to the time it typically takes Mr.
Clinton to make a decision, it has been predictably arduous.


Dow Drops 14.26 Points as a Rally Sputters
An early rally by stocks aided by favorable data on inflation quickly fizzled yesterday.
By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had shed 14.26 points, to 3,569.09.
A contributing factor to the decline in stocks was the Treasury's auction of 30-year bonds, which did not go well and which pushed interest rates higher as a result.
Higher rates do not bode well for an economic recovery.

Review/Jazz; Two Rare Ellington Suites, Falling Into Places
A few tunes into "In the Spirit of Place," a concert featuring the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra performing works by Duke Ellington at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday, things started to fall into place.
On "Air-Conditioned Jungle," the welling dynamics took hold, the rhythm section locked in, and the show was off.
By the time the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis came out to perform "Echoes of Harlem" and "Harlem Airshaft," pinching and squeezing notes, the crowd was ready to applaud for all the exceptional performances, from the trombonist Art Baron's moaning and shouting solos to the pianist Marcus Roberts's carefully calibrated but exuberant improvisations.
The concert, like many of Jazz at Lincoln Center's Ellington programs, had a theme, and this one traced Ellington's preoccupation with translating place into music.
But more important, as part of its attempt to show exactly how deep Ellington's greatness ran, the orchestra performed two suites that have rarely been played.
The first, "Deep South Suite," is known to have been performed twice; the second, "Paris Blues Suite," is thought to have never been performed outside of the recording studio.

Continental Won't Appeal American Air Verdict
Continental Airlines said today that it would not appeal Tuesday's verdict by a Federal jury that acquitted American Airlines of trying to drive Continental and Northwest Airlines out of business with illegally low prices.
Northwest, which joined Continental in suing American Airlines for antitrust violations, has not made a decision to appeal and is talking with Joseph D. Jamail, its lead lawyer in the case, and its other counsel, a spokesman, Jon Austin, said.


Coleman Agrees to a Leave With Pay
Vince Coleman's return to the Mets will be delayed, the team said yesterday, while baseball investigates Coleman's throwing of an explosive that injured three fans late last month in a parking lot outside Dodger Stadium.
The investigation is expected to conclude in about a week, and the Mets said both Coleman and his agent agreed to a paid leave, an action suggested by the team.

Fresh Money for Poor Communities
The Community Reinvestment Act was passed in 1977 to direct more commercial bank loans into poor communities.
It hasn't worked very well.
Community organizers, who lobbied for the bill, have been frustrated by the legal roadblocks thrown up by the banks.
The banks resent the hugely expensive paperwork and being held hostage to community groups angling for concessions when the banks apply for the right to merge or expand.
Everyone agrees that the act has produced more paperwork than loans.
Meanwhile distressed neighborhoods continue to wilt.
Relief may now be in sight.
The Clinton Administration has proposed a new way to channel credit into blighted communities.
It has also promised to re-examine the reinvestment act.
If it artfully combines the two ideas, Mr.
Clinton could put together a first-rate reform.


G.E. to Pay Fishermen Over Polluted Striped-Bass Waters
Ending an eight-year fight, the General Electric Corporation has agreed to compensate New York commercial fishermen for income they lost because of PCB contamination of Hudson River spawning grounds for striped bass.
Under an agreement reached out of court Wednesday night, G.E. will pay up to a total of $7 million to 300 to 400 fishermen, including as many as 150 eastern Long Island baymen, who can prove they lost income as a result of a state ban on fishing for striped bass from 1986 to 1990 in marine waters off Long Island, and since 1976 in the Hudson River.


Mother in Molester Case Avoids Murder Verdict
Friends and family members today privately celebrated the conviction of Ellie Nesler on manslaughter rather than murder charges in the slaying of a handcuffed man accused of molesting her son.
But their relief over the verdict that was reached Wednesday evening was tempered by the knowledge that next month the same jury will decide whether Ms.
Nesler was sane and therefore legally responsible for her actions at the time of the killing.
Ms.
Nesler faces a maximum sentence of 11 years, but if she is found temporarily insane, she may serve a minimum sentence of six months in a mental institution.


Sounds Around Town
The Mingus Legacy
Lincoln Center Out of Doors, Broadway at 66th Street, (212) 875-5400.
The far-reaching series of free events performed in the plazas and parks around Lincoln Center offers an unusually wide spectrum of musical events this weekend.
Tonight at 8:15, Mingus Dynasty, the band created in the late 70's to perpetuate the legacy of the jazz composer Charles Mingus, will perform his work at the Damrosch Park Band Shell.
In Lincoln Center's North Plaza tomorrow and on Sunday, there will be demonstrations of jazz drumming at 2 P.M. (by Chico Hamilton) and frame drumming at 4:30 P.M. (by Glen Velez and Handance).
There will be live music at the Fountain Plaza all afternoon on both days.
At 7:30 P.M tomorrow at the Damrosch Park Band Shell, the legendary folk singer and songwriter Pete Seeger will lead a coalition of local choruses in a sing-along concert.
At once eloquent and modest, Mr.
Seeger, now 75, is still the most convincing spokesman for the sing-along tradition.
Re-inventing Champagne

The artistic anchor of this uneven tribute to the composers of "My Fair Lady," "Brigadoon" and "Camelot" is Martin Vidnovic, a powerful theatrical baritone too rarely seen on Broadway.
Mr.
Vidnovic offers riveting renditions of "If Ever I Would Leave You" and "Gigi," among other Lerner and Loewe favorites.
Although the show's other performers -- Maureen Brennan, Eddie Korbich and Juliet Lambert -- don't inhabit the songs as completely, they are thoroughly professional.
The director, Deborah R. Lapidus, gives several of the ensemble numbers elaborate comic spins.
Showtimes are 8:30 and 10:30 tonight and tomorrow night.
There is a $35 cover charge; no minimum.

Bowe-Holyfield II
RIDDICK BOWE, who won the undisputed heavyweight championship by beating EVANDER HOLYFIELD last November, will defend his titles against Holyfield in a Nov. 6 rematch at Caesars Palace, in Las Vegas, Nev., hotel officials said yesterday.
The fight comes nearly a year to the day after Bowe won a 12-round decision over Holyfield to hand the former champion his first loss and capture all three portions of the heavyweight title.
Bowe has since been stripped by the World Boxing Council portion of the title, so the fight will be for the International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association versions.


Wieden Is Closing Philadelphia Office
Clients of Wieden &amp; Kennedy's Philadelphia office said yesterday that they had been notified it would close at the end of September.
The East Coast office of the Portland, Ore.-based agency was opened in 1991 to serve the Subaru of America account, which Wieden will lose at the end of the year.
The office staff was reduced by 11 people, to 45, after Subaru announced last month that it would not renew its contract with Wieden.
While most of the office's billings come from Subaru, it also handles clients like ESPN, YM magazine, The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Orchestra.


Clinton Hails Midwest Courage Against the Flood
President Clinton today made his fourth trip this summer to the Midwest, this time to sign legislation providing $6.2 billion in Federal assistance to farmers and other victims of the record flooding there.
Mr.

Among 19 citizens from nine states whom he honored was a 32-year-old maid from North Dakota who dived into a flooded basement apartment to rescue a trapped resident.


One Small Beep for Man, Giant Beep for Open
The United States Open's historic leap into the future of automated officiating will be accompanied by time-tested asterisks when the United States Tennis Association's new electronic line calling system is introduced at the 1993 Open later this month.
According to Steve DeVoe, the tournament director, the new system, which signals a long or wide shot with a loud beep, will indeed be used to make all line calls on the four main courts at the National Tennis Center in Flushing, Queens, from the first qualifying matches on Aug. 30 to the men's final on Sept. 12.
Judges Stay, for Now
But in response to player concerns he said, full cadres of line judges will be at their usual places, reinforcing the beeps with their familiar hand signals and cries of "out."

DuPont Settles Growers' Suits Over Fungicide
In a surprise ending to the first trial in one of the biggest agricultural-contamination cases in American history, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company and four growers who contended that a du Pont fungicide had damaged their crops reached an out-of-court settlement this afternoon.
Under it, the company agreed to pay about 1 percent of what the plaintiffs had sought.
In a news conference announcing the $4.25 million settlement, Du Pont's chairman, Edgar S. Woolard Jr., called the agreement "a victory for Du Pont, our employees, and our science."


Review/Film; A Dance As a Slice Of History
American pop culture since World War II has been one long, aggressive assault on Puritan codes of behavior.
One of the earliest and headiest moments in the rebellion was the ascendancy of the twist in 1960.
Five years after Elvis Presley scandalized the guardians of public decency with his televised gyrations, the biggest dance craze since the Charleston liberated social dancing from genteel ballroom conventions and made everybody an Elvis imitator.
As Ron Mann's entertaining documentary "Twist," which opens today at the Village East Cinemas, reconstructs the craze, it came in several phases.
Early in 1960, Hank Ballard and the Midnighters scored a sizable hit with "The Twist," a record that had been the B-side of a minor hit he had released the previous year.
Chubby Checker, a vocal impressionist from Philadelphia, quickly recorded an imitation of Mr.
Ballard's record that was so close to the original in sound that even Mr.
Ballard thought it was his own version the first time he heard it on the radio.
Promoted on Dick Clark's dance show, "American Bandstand," the record went to No. 1 that September.

CONTROLLERS BAN LIFTED BY CLINTON
In a largely symbolic gesture to woo the support of organized labor, President Clinton today canceled President Reagan's ban on the rehiring of air traffic controllers who were dismissed in 1981 in an illegal strike.

Simpson and Wadkins Both Make Statements In First Round of PGA
On a leader board full of low numbers and at least one emphatic message, quiet Scott Simpson shot a loud seven-under-par 64 today to take the first-round lead in the 75th PGA Championship.

CHRONICLE
An increasing number of Off Broadway theaters are offering homemade goodies for sustenance during intermission -- for money, of course, or does that go without saying?
But it's doubtful there's any nosh as rich, or as unexpected, as the lokshen kugel whipped up by MIKE MOSES in the basement of the Lambs Theater on West 44th Street and served to theatergoers attending "Beau Jest." Lokshen kugel, a pudding made with noodles, sugar, buttermilk, sour cream and eggs, is one of the foods mentioned in the play, a comedy has been running for almost two years.
The recipe that is sending scores of cholesterol levels into the stratosphere came from MIRIAM HANAN RUSKIN, the mother of CAROL OSTROW, a co-producer of the show.
Mr.
Moses, an actor (but not in this play), doesn't confine himself to lokshen kugel.
The more diet-conscious -- well, comparatively speaking -- can munch on chocolate chip cookies and chocolate cake.

There could be all kinds of reactions to the sign that will go up Monday at the westbound entrance to Midtown Tunnel.
A lot of people going into Manhattan from Queens will undoubtedly give it and themselves a second look.
Some will smile or laugh; others will probably mutter, "Who do they think they are?" and still others will brush the whole thing off as typically New York.
The whole thing in this case is a 20-foot-by-60-foot billboard that will read: "You're going to New York dressed like that?" The signature is Charivari, New York.
"It's meant to be funny," said JON WEISER, the president of the six Charivari stores in Manhattan.
"We all need to lighten up."


Talk of Campaign Finance Laws Generates a Scramble for Donations
Though legislation to overhaul the campaign finance system has stalled in Congress, it has accomplished one thing: a frenzied round of fund-raising by incumbents.
Lobbyists and directors of political action committees are complaining that the pressure has been turned up for early donations.
The legislators are arguing that they must stockpile donations now for fear that proposed campaign finance laws would diminish their ability to raise money.


Cuomo Says He May Meet With Cato Family on Son's Death
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo told a group of black elected officials yesterday that he would ask the state's Director of Criminal Justice to interview the parents of Gavin Cato, leaving open the possibility that he would order a new investigation into the child's death in a traffic accident, which led to four days of violence in Crown Heights in 1991.
And in what seemed to be an effort to smooth frayed relations with blacks in New York City, where some officials have seen a recent state report on Crown Heights as being overly critical of Mayor David N. Dinkins, Mr.
Cuomo said he would meet with the Cato family if they requested it.

Romania Offers Dramatic Data on Abortion
To the Editor:
In the debate on abortion, advocates of choice have often urged that the consequence of making abortion illegal, or legal but inaccessible, will be much higher mortality among pregnant women who feel compelled to seek back-alley abortions.
There are statistics available on this subject from Romania, which made abortion illegal in 1966, but then reversed itself under a new regime in 1990.

'Playdays'  Lincoln Center  (212) 875-5400  Recommended for all ages  Tomorrow and Sunday
Malika Lee Whitney planted storytelling roots in her native Jamaica, and she has been spreading African-Caribbean tales throughout New York City for the last 15 years.
In her inimitable style, she will recite stories about the African diaspora in performances for the family program of the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival.
Ms.
Whitney will be joined by Pearls of Wisdom, a group of elder female storytellers who like tales of courage, and who doesn't need to hear about that?
They will perform at 3:45 P.M. tomorrow and Sunday.
Families can also try the festival's dance workshops tomorrow and Sunday.
At 2 P.M. each day, Silvana Magda's Viva Brazil ensemble will show how to do the samba de roja, the original samba, in which you invite the person next to you to dance by bumping into him or her. (You can't be shy.) They will also teach the samba carioca, which has more hyped-up movements.
Greek circular and line dancing reach back to the days of Helen of Troy, and at 3 P.M. the Greek-American Folklore Society will teach the basic 5/4 rhythm that this dancing is about.
At 4 P.M. each day, the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers will teach round dancing, and at 5 P.M. you can learn contra dancing.

'Fool Moon'  Richard Rodgers Theater  226 West 46th Street  Manhattan  (212) 307-4100  Recommended ages: 6 and up  Through Sept. 5
At the opening of this high-brow clown show, David Shiner, one of the two performers, climbs over a row of people, practically choking a man in the last seat.
That leads to a burst of near-fisticuffs, which Mr.
Shiner seems to encourage.
He then moves through the audience, throwing people's clothes around while pushing them out of their seats.
He's an aggressive clown, with a hatful of neurotic tics and an ability to mock people while making them want more.
His partner, Bill Irwin, a clown who has received a MacArthur Fellowship, is a slyly humorous guy who in one act tries to seduce Mr.
Shiner's date.
In another act, he has infinite trouble putting a vest on; children can relate to that.
In fact, children can find a lot in common with Mr.
Shiner and Mr.
Irwin's antics.
The two-hour show relies a lot on audience participation; during a recent show, a boy and a girl from the audience were enticed onto the stage to participate in an act with Mr.
Irwin.
Tickets are available in all sections at most performances.
Performances are Monday through Saturday at 8 P.M.; there are matinees on Wednesday and Saturday at 2 P.M.
From Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, performances will be Tuesday through Saturday at 8 P.M., Wednesday and Saturday at 2 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M.

This small exhibition uses large, handsomely painted illustrations and photographs of girls around the world to show that they are not only different from boys but are also often treated in a petty way, as if they are, indeed, the second sex.
Against this colorful backdrop, which includes illustrations adapted from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Linnea in Monet's Garden," American girls can read facts about girls on the other side of the world.
For example, 60 million girls do not have access to primary schools, compared with 40 million boys.
In Java, girls work 30 percent more hours per day than boys do.
In Bahrain, 50 percent of girls are married by age 15.
Visitors may find that the photographs alone -- of street girls, girls selling flowers, a girl washing clothes in a murky river -- tell the story.
The free exhibition, a collaboration between Unicef and children's book authors, illustrators, publishers and photographers, suggests that the remedy is not to ignore the differences between boys and girls, but to identify and end discrimination in health care, play and schooling, and to promote self-esteem and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse.
The lobby is open daily from 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.

At the Bar; Tough litigators ponder the meaning of success at a shrine to America's immigrants.
They came by ferry rather than rickety steamer, and on the top deck rather than in steerage.
They paid in dollars -- 95 of them -- rather than in rubles or kronen.
They wore blue blazers and seersucker suits instead of heavy woolens.
They were met by a Dixieland band rather than by doctors.
And on a professional scale they were bluebloods, not greenhorns.
On Tuesday night three boatloads of lawyers, all members of the American Bar Association's litigation section, set sail with their families for Ellis Island.
There, with Manhattan's spectacular skyline looming in the distance -- many stories taller than what an earlier generation of Americans saw -- they spent four hours eating, drinking, networking and conjuring up thoughts about America and Americanization.

Men Charged With Killing Of an Artist
Two men have been indicted in the killing of a graphic artist who was shot outside her TriBeCa loft in February, hours before the men were arrested in another shooting in Coney Island, the Manhattan District Attorney's office announced yesterday.
On Feb. 23, Bonnie Bear, 42, was shot in the neck and robbed of a tote bag as she loaded packages into her Mercedes-Benz near her loft at 11 Lispenard Street in TriBeCa.
Her spinal cord severed, she never regained consciousness and died eight days later at Bellevue Hospital Center.


TV Weekend; A Hollywood Sexpot And Her Short Career
Jean Harlow's short life, off screen and on, was the stuff of which movie magazines of her era were made. (In this era, it would be television docudramas.) On screen she was a naughty but nice 1930's girl, slinking, slithering and showing more than a glimpse of stocking for the benefit of tough guys like Gable, Cagney and Tracy.
Off screen she made the headlines when Paul Bern, her husband in a reportedly unconsummated marriage, committed suicide and when William Powell, her lover in a presumably consummated romance, wept at her funeral.
She was only 26.
"Harlow: The Blond Bombshell" is consciously in the movie-magazine mode, even to describing the star as wanting nothing more than to quit Hollywood and settle down with Mr.
Right: "Beneath her film image, an old-fashioned housewife was struggling to get out."

F.C.C. Imposes Fine on Infinity
The Federal Communications Commission fined Infinity Broadcasting $125,000 for what the agency considered indecent radio programs by the New York disk jockey Howard Stern.
The move came a day after the F.C.C. fined a Nevada radio station $73,750 for carrying the programs.
The fines could be the start of a new battle between Mr.
Stern and the commission, which in December imposed a fine of $600,000 against the company that supplies his programs.

Doctor Faces Murder Count In Abortion
A Queens grand jury indicted a physician for murder yesterday, charging that he performed an illegal abortion on a patient and then allowed her to bleed to death without offering the slightest medical help.
The physician, Dr.
David Benjamin, was charged with second-degree murder for showing "depraved indifference to human life" in the death of Guadalupe Negron.
Mrs.
Negron, 33, died on July 9 after undergoing what medical officials said was a botched and illegal abortion at Dr.
Benjamin's office at 102-21 Roosevelt Avenue in Corona.

Reviews/Film; Three Italian Vignettes, Stolen by a Stray Dog
Canines have always been notorious scene-stealers in movies.
And in "Especially on Sunday," a trilogy of vignettes conceived by the revered Italian screenwriter Tonino Guerra, a slightly corny fable about a stray dog that attaches himself to a reluctant widower nearly walks off with the film.
Each of the stories, which are all set in the vicinity of the Marecchia River Valley in north-central Italy, is assigned to a different young director.
But because they share the same screenwriter and the same ruggedly beautiful landscape, they flow into one another almost as though they were the work of a single hand.

Since their publication, people who live and work here have been asking obsessively: Is it really that savage?
Is Washington so different from other places?
Is the pressure at the top levels of power in this city so intolerable that suicides are inevitable?

Review/Music; The Mutuality of Mozart and Haydn
This year's thematic Mostly Mozart festival has been discussed very nearly ad nauseam, but a critic new to the game feels the need to add his own pronouncement.
Is it possible that the problem is not the festival's presentation of Mozartean influence, but Mozart himself?
Over the past two centuries, composers have repeatedly longed to duplicate the boy wonder's pristine musical world, and their homages have repeatedly fallen short.
Mozart is an intangible idol, an impractical ideal; music influenced by him often has a squishy surface, like a nose pressed against a candy shop window.
Those who were around while the young god trod the earth, Haydn and Beethoven in particular, took more useful lessons than the likes of Tchaikovsky and Strauss, who worshiped at a distance.
Haydn is the final exhibit in Mostly Mozart's series, and he ought to have been the first; the Mozart-plus-Haydn orchestral program on Tuesday night made eminent good sense.
Relations were easily found: the dramatic unison at the outset of Haydn's Symphony No. 93 brought to mind "Don Giovanni," and the Menuetto of Mozart's "Linz" Symphony sounded like Haydn through and through.


Review/Film; Blossom Time for a Lonely Girl
A fawn, a bunny, a lamb: these are among the last things anyone might expect to see in a film directed by Agnieszka Holland, whose other work (including "Europa, Europa" and "Olivier, Olivier") had not a trace of sugarplums in its makeup.
Yet Ms.
Holland's film of "The Secret Garden" is elegantly expressive, a discreet and lovely rendering of the children's classic by Frances Hodgson Burnett.
That book is a paean to the restorative powers of the natural world, and Ms.
Holland succeeds in conveying much of its delicate beauty.
For all its raining rose petals and time-lapse shots of springtime, this "Secret Garden" remains in some ways relatively austere.
It has been made without the preciousness that is this story's greatest liability, and with a lush visual prettiness that could not have been captured onstage (where "The Secret Garden" was the basis for a successful 1991 musical).
Aside from simply telling this story, Ms.
Holland (and the screenwriter Caroline Thompson, who wrote "Edward Scissorhands") also strengthen some of its underpinnings.
The director's touch is most noticeable in scenes setting forth the trauma and the unhappiness from which Mary Lennox, the 10-year-old heroine of "The Secret Garden," must gradually recover.


Refugees In Croatia: No Solace, Few Hopes
The manager of the Laguna Hotel in downtown Zagreb, Ivan Sertic, can vividly remember the day when 20 buses full of war refugees pulled into his parking lot.
"It happened all of a sudden, on Nov. 22, 1991," Mr.
Sertic recalled.
"Government people told us the refugees needed a place to stay for a while, and we took them in. No one had any idea they would still be here two years later."

Mexico Opts for the Sanctions It Bitterly Opposed
Determined to see the North American Free Trade Agreement approved in a divided United States Congress, Mexico has agreed to the very penalties for violations of labor and environmental laws that it had steadfastly opposed: sanctions on trade.
But while the Government quickly came under attack today by opposition politicians and other critics for its reversal, the side accords to the trade agreement seemed to trouble the Mexican businessmen who might face sanctions little, if at all.

The Free-Trade Accord; 3 NATIONS RESOLVE ISSUES HOLDING UP TRADE PACT VOTE
Clearing the way for a big legislative battle, the United States struck deals with Canada and Mexico today resolving issues that have stalled approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But the deals did not mollify Congressional critics of the pact and left its political future in doubt.
The three countries agreed to set up two North American commissions that would try to insure the enforcement of labor and environmental laws from the Yukon to the Yucatan as the free-trade pact eliminates tariffs and other trade barriers across the continent.


Report Says Shuttle Engines Are Less Safe Than Believed
A NASA safety panel says the main engines of the space shuttles, long viewed as their most fickle and dangerous part, appear to be more prone to catastrophic failure than generally believed and need rapid improvement to "greatly enhance engine reliability and safety."
The failure of a main engine on Thursday stopped the shuttle Discovery just three seconds before the winged spaceship and its astronauts were to blast into orbit.
It was the second time this year that a shuttle -- still on the launching pad with the engines already firing -- suddenly went silent because of an engine flaw.

GOVERNMENT TOLD TO SAVE MESSAGES SENT BY COMPUTER
In a decision that brings the accountability of Federal agencies into the computer age, a United States appeals court ruled today that the Government must preserve millions of electronic messages and memorandums under the same standards used for paper communications.
A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected arguments by the Clinton Administration that computer messages between officials -- E-mail -- did not have to be saved.
The Administration contended that officials should be allowed to choose whatever computer files they thought should be preserved and to print them on paper.


Man, Shot in '92 Car-Theft Case, Is Charged in Possession of Crack
Howard Caesar, the 19-year-old whose shooting by the police last year as he emerged from a stolen car focused wide attention on the city's car theft problem, was arrested this week on charges of possessing four vials of crack, the police said.
After the shooting, an Essex County grand jury indicted a police officer for firing the shot that critically wounded the young man and hospitalized him for several months.

In currency trading here, the dollar continued to fall rapidly, closing at 102.40 yen, down 0.97 yen from the Thursday close in Tokyo, and at one point in the day it hit 101.80, a record low since modern exchange rates were set in 1949.

Revising the Meaning of Homeless
For a decade, New York City has sheltered just about any family that said it was homeless.
Never in that decade has that policy worked.
The system is overloaded, resources are limited, planning has been inadequate, and the truly needy often lose out to the less needy.
Finally, the Dinkins administration is facing reality.
It is taking a step toward improving homeless services by rationing them.
Under new eligibility rules, families seeking shelter will have to prove that they truly have nowhere else to live.
If they cannot, they may be turned away.

WARNING IS ISSUED ON LIBYA SUSPECTS
The United States, Britain and France issued a new warning to Libya today, giving it until Oct. 1 to turn over two suspects in the bombing of an American airliner over Scotland in which 270 people died nearly five years ago or face new and tougher sanctions.
The warning came in a joint statement issued after the Security Council voted for the fourth time to continue its own sanctions against Libya for refusing to give up the two men, both of whom have been indicted in connection with the explosion of Pan American World Airways Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988.
All 259 passengers and crew and 11 people on the ground were killed in the bombing.

Most Retirees Won't Feel Tax Law's Bite
Many retirees are uncertain whether their Social Security benefits will be taxed at a higher level next year -- and for good reason.
The calculation is so complex that tax experts expect more pensioners to turn to accountants than ever before.
The Internal Revenue Service will include a special worksheet with its tax instructions, but the new worksheets, instructions and tax tables will not be printed and distributed for months.
In the meantime, retirees who want to know if they will be affected, and to what extent, might find it useful to do rough calculations.


2 Polls Show Pessimism by Consumers
Two widely followed consumer confidence polls taken in the first half of August show Americans are even more discouraged about the economy and their own financial situations than they were before the Aug. 6 vote on President Clinton's budget.
This suggests that most consumers, already as depressed about economic prospects as they were when George Bush was in the White House, have not accepted the Clinton Administration's assurances that its plan to raise taxes and restrain spending will help get the economy moving and benefit all but the richest Americans.

This proved unsuccessful.


Upstaters Shouldn't Pay for New York City's Drinking Water
To the Editor:
Robert F. Kennedy's "Embattled at the Source" (Op-Ed, Aug. 5) embodies the elitist attitude so often displayed toward upstate New York residents, businesses and landowners by their downstate counterparts.
The Catskill and Delaware watershed area is unquestionably a precious treasure and should be preserved, policed and maintained.
However, it is not now, nor should it ever become, a New York City service facility.
The watershed area comprises places with strong histories and identities of their own, home to countless families and businesses, most far more environmentally responsible than city dwellers.

Judge CHARLES MOORE also ordered Browning to donate $500 to a Drug Abuse Resistance Education program and undergo drug and alcohol evaluation.

He pleaded guilty to the traffic offense and was fined $50 and court costs, Moore said.


Review/Dance; Many Languages, Many Voices of Students
One of the most enjoyable features of the twice-yearly benefit for the Emergency Fund for Student Dancers is the opportunity to see performing and choreography by the students themselves.
The dances presented on Wednesday night at the Cunningham Studio were no exception.
The program, which included works by professional choreographers, was long.
The theater was hot.
But the performances and new dances were vivid and fresh.
Cristina Rizzo, representing the Martha Graham School, dealt with communication and the lack thereof in "Organized Havoc," a dance for six pale-faced young women in black, foreign students each speaking in her own language.
The theme, enlarged on somewhat unclearly in a score with text that was composed by William Catancaro, seemed touchingly to allude to the experiences of dance students here from other countries.
The piece built steadily to its climax.
And Ms.
Rizzo knew how to make her dancers look good.
She was joined in the cast by Maria Elena Bernardi, Lexuri Gallastegi, Jeanette Hemstad, Gissella Speranza and little Fernanda Stein, who has the makings of a first-rate Paul Taylor dancer.

Learning Hard Lessons About Cold-Call Offers
THE next time the phone rings with an unfamiliar stockbroker who sounds altogether too friendly, think about Laurence A. Van Vliet.
The owner of a construction company near Los Angeles, he received a cold call from a Shearson Lehman broker about two years ago.
The call came first thing in the morning, he recently recalled, before anyone else had arrived.
Mr.
Van Vliet (pronounced VLEET) said he was a long-term investor and welcomed the broker's recommendation of Glaxo, a reputable drug company.
But each time the broker from New York called, the picks became riskier, soon running to unproved biotechs.
The tone became more frantic.
"We've got to get out of there," the broker said of a bank stock Mr.
Van Vliet had long held.
"It's going to crash."

Israel Rethinks Interrogation of Arabs
Several months ago, Israelis watching an evening newscast saw Hassan Zubeidi shuffle stiffly onto their television screens, his face frozen in a hollow stare.
Mr.

The report from his house -- a rare look by Israeli television at a Palestinian allegedly mistreated by the Shin Bet -- briefly pierced the secrecy and public indifference that normally cloak interrogations of Arab suspects in the occupied territories.
These interrogations, according to human rights groups and former prisoners, routinely involve physical and psychological abuse that has been classified by some critics as a form of torture.

An encounter on a country road between the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman, and a camera crew for the Democrat, Gov.
Jim Florio, has blown up into a major confrontation in the race.
Since the start of the campaign, Governor Florio has sought to portray Mrs.
Whitman as wealthy and out of touch with the common people.
But it was not until Mrs.
Whitman and an aide jumped in a car on Wednesday to chase the Florio camera crew, which had been videotaping her 208-acre farm in Bedminster and Tewksbury, that her wealth, and the issue, came to life. 'He Can Really Hurt Her'
Within a day, the issue that Mrs.
Whitman had tried to prevent from becoming a focus of the race overwhelmed everything else, as Mr.
Florio began to attack her for using that farm, and a smaller one in Far Hills, as tax shelters that saved her as much as $30,000 in income taxes last year.

Consumer Price Index Up Bare 0.1%
Inflation has all but disappeared this summer -- though not for good, by the assessments of government and private economists.
The Consumer Price Index, the broadest measure of inflation, inched up just one-tenth of 1 percent in July, the Labor Department reported today, driving the three-month rate to eight-tenths of 1 percent on an annual basis.
That is the lowest for any three-month period since mid-1986, when oil prices came crashing down.

There are these deep winding stairs to the locker room in Chicago Stadium, and the father would always have a cup of a soft drink, and his son would take a few sips before entering the court, where he would invariably dazzle the crowd.

Let Women Respect One Another's Choices
To the Editor:
Having recently added another failed relationship to my string, I was on the subway after a long day at my well-paying if not glamorous job, on my way home to an empty apartment, wondering if I should get a couple of cats.
I wasn't up to thinking of having a child without a husband.

Yank Numbers: Double Plays, First Place
There is a party going on in the Bronx, and the invitation list is growing.
If there were complaints about parking spots last night, they were obscured by the roars inspired by the four Yankee double plays that helped stabilize Jim Abbott's early struggle, and Mike Stanley's long, two-run double that broke a scoreless tie with the Orioles, and a 4-1 Yankee victory.
Coupled with Toronto's loss at Boston, the ninth Yankee victory in their last 12 home games created a first-place tie in the American League East.
It incorporated the elements essential for contention: effective starting pitching, outstanding defense and offensive opportunism in the late innings.


Bridge
Those who think that Russians are a stolid, unemotional people would have had cause to change their minds if they had been present at the conclusion of the National Women's Knockout Team Championship in Washington last month.
Irina Levitina of Teaneck, N.J., who came to this country from St.
Petersburg two and a half years ago, bubbled over with excitement on finding that she was a winner.
It was her first major bridge title, a well-earned one, although she has won many major women's chess championships, including the American title.
On the diagramed deal from the final, Levitina was North, playing with Dorothy Truscott, and she judged well to pass three no-trump rather than persevere to four hearts.
The opening lead of the heart eight strongly suggested that East held the queen.
South had communication problems, and was reluctant to see a diamond lead coming from her right.
She won with dummy's heart king, and, as it happens, would have done well to play the club ace.


A Gamble by Campbell Earns Praise and Points
Prime Minister Kim Campbell gambled and won.
Her hard line against the trade sanctions under the labor and environmental side agreements of the North American free-trade pact brought Canada the exemption it had demanded without torpedoing the basic accord.
She risked being the spoiler, but has now won political points at home by standing up to Washington.


The Race for No. 2: Now It's Brown's Turn
It is only the second preseason game, and not much should be made of these.
Tuneups, that's all.
But when the Giants play the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday night, the game will mean a little more to quarterback Dave Brown.
And with good reason.
Like many players, Brown is fighting for a job.
But unlike many others, his position is the most visible of all: the quarterback's.
And for that reason, his battle with Kent Graham to become the second-string passer behind Phil Simms is that much more intense.


Gathering Some Special Eggs for a Russian Show
Almost 70 years after Bolshevik revolutionaries looted the Winter Palace and peddled the Imperial Easter eggs, jewel-encrusted boxes, clocks, silverware and porcelain throughout Europe, some Faberge treasures have returned to Russia.
Largest Display Since Revolution
More than 350 royal trinkets and 6 jeweled eggs designed by Carl Faberge and his craftsmen in their St.
Petersburg atelier at the turn of the century are included in an exhibition at the Hermitage Museum here.
The Faberge display is believed to be the largest since the Russian Revolution; it is the first time some of the pieces have been seen in public.
The show, which closes here on Aug. 15, is to open at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris on Sept. 24 and at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in January.


Literary Lions, Purring and Hissing
The work of anyone who was anybody in the turn-of-the-century pantheon of British novelists, playwrights and poets can be found among the 200 manuscripts, illustrations and memorabilia on display in "Dandies and Doughties: Writers in Britain, 1890-1900," an exhibition on view in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library until Sept. 25.
Not surprisingly, the show is filled with literary gems that offer readers and scholars a lesson in vision and revision by masters of language and storytelling.
William Butler Yeats, Oscar Wilde, Max Beerbohm, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Hardy, John Galsworthy, Robert Louis Stevenson, H. G. Wells, A. E. Housman, George Du Maurier, Somerset Maugham, James M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle are among those whose work is on view.


Choosing the Right Person to Manage Your Will
Choosing the executor for a will tends to take a back seat to such issues as minimizing estate taxes and deciding who will get the silver.
But this may be a serious mistake.
A poor choice can lengthen the probate process, run up legal fees, miss tax filing deadlines and delay the distribution of assets.
And the appointment of multiple executors can create gridlock.
"I've seen too many bitter fights develop because the executors couldn't agree or didn't know what they should be doing," said Martin M. Shenkman, a lawyer in Teaneck, N.J., who has written on estate issues.

New Quarrel Delaying Plans for Coliseum Development
Plans to develop the site of the New York Coliseum were delayed again yesterday by a quarrel between the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority over negotiations with Mortimer B. Zuckerman, three days before a city deadline for signing a contract with Mr.
Zuckerman.
In the latest twist in the plan to build on the site at 59th Street and Columbus Circle, the Dinkins administration accused the M.T.A. of being unreasonable in its negotiations with Mr.
Zuckerman, who has been seeking to scale back the project and to reduce the price of the land.


So They Loaded Up the Truck and Moved to Vermont
In 1985, Max Comins and his wife, Merrily, traded their jobs on Wall Street for a country inn in Vermont, risking their savings on a dream they had shared since college.
They came close to failing, when, near opening day, their funds dipped below the next month's bills.
Seven years later, their inn is a success.
With gross annual revenue of $1.2 million, the Cominses believe they can eventually sell the business at a profit.
The most important bonus, they say, is having weekday afternoons free to be with their son.

Tagliabue Voids Mirer's Contract
Commissioner PAUL TAGLIABUE voided the contract between quarterback RICK MIRER and the Seattle Seahawks yesterday, calling it "a sham" that violates the league's new labor agreement.
In an uncharacteristically strong statement, Tagliabue said the contract between the Seahawks and the former Notre Dame quarterback, the second pick in April's draft, was designed to circumvent the salary cap for rookies with incentives it was impossible not to reach.
One such incentive in the five-year deal that could be worth up to $15.7 million is a clause that would pay Mirer a $3 million bonus if the Seahawks, 2-14 last season, won more than two games this season -- whether Mirer played or not.

Send Republicans a Message on Gridlock
To the Editor:
If there ever was any doubt that the Republicans are the party of obstruction and gridlock, the spectacle of Republican senators voting en bloc against any and all Clinton budget proposals would certainly demonstrate it conclusively.
The sight of all those Republican senators marching in lock step to the orders of Commander Dole is a disheartening one for anyone who believes politicians may sometimes think independently and vote their consciences rather than their party line.
Anyone who gives serious thought to our country's financial situation must realize that we can no longer afford the Reagan-Bush borrow and spend policies and that we must make sacrifices, including higher taxes.
Only Republicans seem determined to protect the financial interests of their wealthiest campaign contributors at all cost -- including the cost to the people who elected them and who pay their salaries.

Dehere And Derby Now Stuff Of Dreams
Wise racing people try not to whisper the words "Kentucky Derby" when they see a 2-year-old prodigy performing at Saratoga.
Wiser ones don't even think "Kentucky Derby."
But they could all be forgiven today after watching the juvenile prodigy Dehere win the Sanford Stakes by five lengths for his third straight victory.
And he did it by escaping a traffic trap on the inside with a spectacular sweep around four other horses, shifting into overdrive in the homestretch, burying Prenup and Distinct Reality and dashing into the imaginations of racing people, wise or not.

So Close, But Guess Who Was Pitching
The streak is at one.
It is, for the moment, as monstrous and cruel a mark as when Anthony Young had lost 27 straight.
Young, the minor celebrity with the major league record for consecutive defeats, recovered his futile form tonight after a brief fling with success.
Entering the game with the Mets ahead by 5-4 against the Phillies with two out in the ninth, the right-hander left it with Veterans Stadium threatening to collapse from vibration.


How Scrappy Borland Tripped Up
In headier times, Philippe Kahn likened his company, Borland International, to a pack of barbarians -- lean, mean troops out to vanquish bloated, bureaucratic competitors in the personal computer software wars.
But now the barbarian, bleeding from wounds both self-inflicted and otherwise, has taken another spear in the side.
The thrust came late Thursday, when Federal District Judge Robert E. Keeton in Boston ruled that a feature in Borland's Quattro Pro spreadsheet program infringed on the copyrights for the 1-2-3 spreadsheet program of the Lotus Development Corporation.
Quattro Pro, Borland's flagship product, represents about 25 percent of the company's $464 million annual revenue.

Giuliani Says Dinkins Avoids Budget Choices
Saying that New York City "is entitled to a mayor, not a committee," Rudolph W. Giuliani sharply attacked Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday for postponing decisions on how to keep the city budget balanced until a panel of experts reports after Election Day, and he faulted the State Financial Control Board for letting the Mayor do it.
At the same time, Mr.
Giuliani discussed his own broad outline for cutting the city work force, scaling back taxes and keeping the budget balanced.
But he did not explain how he could accomplish all he said without either catastrophic cuts in some services or higher taxes.


Israel Ends Bar On P.L.O. Role At Peace Talks
Formally ending a longstanding refusal to involve the P.L.O. in the Mideast peace talks, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today that Israel would continue to negotiate with three key Palestinian delegates despite their new status as officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
"It makes no difference to us," Mr.

Early August Vehicle Sales Rose 3.6%
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose just 3.6 percent in early August, compared with a weak year-earlier period, as dwindling dealer inventories caused some shoppers to postpone their purchases.

A Chairman for Changing Times
For a Polish-born son of a Soviet Georgian military officer to succeed a Bronx-born child of Jamaican immigrants as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a tribute to their abilities and to the military as a path for advancement in America.
The tougher question is whether the nomination of Gen.
John Shalikashvili to replace Gen.
Colin Powell is a tribute to President Clinton's judgment.
That will depend on whether General Shalikashvili can ease the military's adjustment to a turbulent but less threatening world and its acceptance of social mores that challenge tradition.


Edgartown Journal; Worse Than Rain: a Presidential Visit

"There goes the neighborhood," said the cartoonist Jules Feiffer, who was speaking by telephone from Maine, where he was on a week's vacation from his vacation on this socially frenetic island.


Marines Are First to Admit Wedlock in Corps Can Be Hell
High-school sweethearts who married when they were both 20, Rick and Lisa Hihath are the quintessential Marine couple: he the trim noncommissioned officer whose duty has shuffled him around the world, she the dutiful wife rearing two daughters and following him when she can, struggling to keep the marriage intact.
"It's stressful," said Sergeant Hihath, now 29, a logistics expert with the First Marine Division at Camp Pendleton here who recently returned from Somalia.
"Given the amount of time marines spend away from home, the family has to adjust to dad's being away. And then they have to adjust when he comes home again." Marital Casualty Toll
Similar stories can be told throughout the corps, and it was precisely to avoid that sort of disruption in the lives of recruits that the Marine Commandant recently issued a new corps policy that would have barred enlistment of married recruits, a startling departure made without the knowledge of civilian superiors.
Once the superiors found out, they quickly scuttled the idea on Wednesday, but the episode underscored the toll that military life takes on families, particularly in the Marines, a kind of international 911 service.
And it reopened an age-old question about whether military and family life can co-exist.

If everything goes as planned, BASHKIM DIBRA will be at Barnes &amp; Noble's new superstore on Broadway and 82d Street this afternoon with a golden retriever puppy named Bruno, a Great Pyrenees named Hudd and a lot of theories about dog behavior and training.
Mr.

In addition to selling books, he plans to offer tips on handling children and pets under the same roof.  (He says, for instance, that even before a newborn is brought home from the hospital, an article of the baby's clothing should be given to the dog to smell, to familiarize it with the scent and avoid possible jealousy.)

"It would help us in a lot of ways and only affect us negatively in an area where we already have good depth."

The ninth episode in the phenomenally successful series, which began in 1980, "The Final Friday" is a largely incoherent movie that generates little suspense and relies for the majority of its thrills on close-up gore.
Most of the grosser images in the film, which was directed by Adam Marcus, come near the beginning, not long after Jason Voorhees, the series' hockey-masked fiend, is dismembered by a squad of machine gun-toting police.


Review/Music; Gospel And Blues, Strings Attached
The Soldier String Quartet, one of several hiply dressed chamber groups currently exploring the border between classical and pop, played an hourlong, early-evening program on Thursday as part of Lincoln Center's Out of Doors series.
Up against the north wall of the Metropolitan Opera House, David Soldier and Regina Carter (violinists), Ron Lawrence (violist) and Dawn Buckholz (cellist) presented a few original compositions along with half a dozen blues and gospel numbers.
The guest vocalists were Jason White and Tiye' Giraud, with intermittent drumming by Jim Black.
The set opened with "God Moves on the Water" by Blind Willie Johnson, a Texas gospel classic that Mr.
Soldier ably transferred to string sonorities.
Other selections leaned heavily on the masters of Mississippi blues (Son House, Robert Johnson, Skip James), with covers also of Blind Lemon Jefferson and Roebuck (Pop) Staples.
Ms.
Carter's solos caught the idiom with haunting accuracy, and the vocals had vitality and wit; the showpiece for Mr.
White was Jefferson's "Black Snake Moan."


Abortion Protesters Outnumbered in Denver
Hoisting placards that reviled a doctor who performs abortions here as a killer, about 40 members of Operation Rescue marched and kneeled in prayer on the sidewalks outside the Swedish Medical Center here today.
But they were outnumbered by more than 2 to 1 by others with signs that declared, "This clinic stays open."

Checking Schools for Asbestos: 3 Down, Hundreds to Go
A week after asbestos inspections began at more than 1,000 New York City public schools, officials said yesterday that they had decided what to do in three of them.
The rest of the schools are in various stages of diagnosis and evaluation, four weeks before classes are scheduled to start.


Over Cosmetics and Appliances, the Sounds of a Baby Grand
It's 10 A.M. and the one-day sale at the Abraham &amp; Straus department store at the Paramus Park Mall is in full swing.
Martha and Irving Westman have divided their energies: she's buying in the blouse department, he's beside the baby grand piano in the lobby, humming along to "I Can't Give You Anything But Love."
"My wife does the shopping and I do the sitting," Mr.
Westman said, then nodded toward the pianist, Doug Harding.
"I come here a few times a week to hear him."


Review/Music; Forget the Themes and Just Listen
Concert programs gracefully balanced and well-played have a concreteness that makes all the themes and linkages of this summer's Mostly Mozart Festival seem a little ephemeral.
The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center occupied Avery Fisher Hall at Thursday night's edition of the series and brought together Haydn, Schubert and Mozart in the most satisfying of ways.
Haydn -- Mozart's contemporary and greatest fan -- was represented by some of the Scottish folk songs he arranged (for a price) for singer and instrumental trio.
Although Haydn attached his own name to this work, a lot of it was farmed out to pupils, making it in the genre of "from the studio of Titian" or "the workshop of Rembrandt." Such dishonesties on his part were simply responses to ones committed against him.
Haydn was regularly robbed by publishers who either issued his pieces without permission or offered counterfeits.


As Trading Slows, Dow Ends Up 9.22 for Week
What started out as a promising week for stocks ended in disappointment on the 11th anniversary of the start of the Great Wall Street Bull Market.
Trading faded yesterday, leaving market barometers only slightly higher, as the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.56 point for the day, to 3,569.65, but up 9.22 points on the week.
Dennis E. Jarrett, the chief market analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, said, "It was a typical summer Friday with volume on the low side."


Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum reports earnings for Qtr to June 30


Giuliani Drawing Funds
Campaign finance reports filed yesterday in the New York City mayoral race showed that in the period from July 12 to Aug. 9, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, took in money at nearly twice the rate of Mayor David N. Dinkins.
The figures showed Mr.
Giuliani's raising $622,166 to $343,927 for the Mayor.
But that was offset by the Mayor's receiving nearly $1 million in matching public funds for the Democratic primary.
The Mayor now has just over $2 million on hand for his campaign while Mr.
Giuliani has $1.3 million.


N.A.A.C.P. Leader Denies Snub of Cuomo
The Rev.
Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the executive director of the N.A.A.C.P., said yesterday that he had not intended to snub Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo when he abruptly canceled a meeting with the Governor on Wednesday.
"It was a matter of schedule," Dr.
Chavis said yesterday, as he talked with reporters before meeting at City Hall with Mayor David N. Dinkins.
"The Governor, first of all, requested the meeting, and we just have not been able to schedule it as of yet. At some point we will have a meeting."


Make Room for the Government Permit-Holders; Municipal Workers Fill Parking Spaces That Boerum Hill's Car Owners Must Vacate
If alternate-side-of-the-street parking is the bane of car owners in New York City, consider the plight and pique of Joseph Martinez, a resident of Pacific Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.
By 8 A.M. every weekday, he and his neighbors must move their cars and roam the streets in search of a new spot, only to trudge home to find their block lined with cars bearing that coveted perquisite of the public servant -- the official parking permit.


Clinton Preaches Military Conversion to an Area Hit Hard by Cuts
President Clinton sought to assure residents of this region today that his Administration stood ready to ease their economic burdens as it shuts down five major defense installations in the San Francisco Bay Area over the next four years.
The Bay Area will be the region hit the hardest by a broad Administration plan to shut down or scale back scores of military bases across the country.
But Mr.
Clinton said the effort would create more economic opportunity than is lost "if we do it right."


Bristol-Myers Won't Renew Hauser Pact
Announcing a move that some analysts characterized as "hardball negotiating tactics," the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company confirmed yesterday that it would not renew a supply contract for its Taxol cancer drug with Hauser Chemical Reseach Inc., a small Colorado company.
Hauser shares immediately plunged, losing more than half their value in heavy Nasdaq trading and closing at $6.625, down $7.875 on volume of 2,453,800 shares.


U.N. REPORTS SERBS ARE PULLING BACK ON SARAJEVO FRONT
The top United Nations commander here said today that the Serbs had withdrawn most of their troops from two strategic mountains southwest of the capital, clearing the way for the resumption of peace talks in Geneva on Monday.
After a day on which United States and other NATO jets screamed lower than ever before in their patrols over the Sarajevo area, the United Nations commander in Bosnia, Lieut.
Gen.
Francis Briquemont, said tonight that the Serbs had already pulled back most of their troops from the two peaks, Mount Bjelasnica and Mount Igman, and had pledged to remove the rest by 4 P.M. local time on Saturday.


Observer; And the Shooting Stopped
Afterward it was said that the extraordinary meteor showers of August 11-12 must have had something to do with it.
Such fundamental reversals in human nature do not "just happen," but can result only from extraterrestrial influences.
So said people who believed the meteor showers awoke better angels that had been long dormant in the American nature.
Whatever the cause, the first development in the good-feeling movement occurred, oddly enough, on a Friday the 13th, a day famous for bad luck.


India Risks Going the Way of the Soviet Union
To the Editor:
Khushwant Singh, in "India, the Hindu State" (Op-Ed, Aug. 3), is on target except for one vital issue: the future of India.
He thinks India is in no danger of fragmenting.
India will disintegrate precisely because its secular framework has been shredded over the last 47 years by corrupt governments and by nascent Hinduism flexing its muscles after centuries of slavery.
Mr.
Singh fails to note that almost the entire periphery of India has been in flames for more than a decade.


Times Adopts A New Policy In Advertising For Housing
The New York Times has adopted a policy requiring that pictures of people in housing advertisements be representative of the racial makeup in the metropolitan area.
The policy was adopted as part of a settlement, announced yesterday, of a lawsuit filed in 1989.
The suit asserted that the newspaper had violated Federal fair housing laws because virtually all the people shown in real-estate advertisements were white.


American Biltrite reports earnings for Qtr to July 3


Morceli Issue is Unresolved on Eve of Championships
The world outdoor track and field championships will begin a nine-day run on Saturday, with or without Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, the world's best 1,500-meter runner.
The issue for Morceli is money.
In a sport now more professional than amateur at the top level, no one will receive prize money here, although each individual winner will get a new Mercedes worth more than $25,000.
Morceli wants prize money and will settle for appearance money.


Accords Fail to Redraw Battle Lines Over Pact
A horde of interest groups sprang into action today to praise or denounce President Clinton's new side agreements to the free trade pact with Mexico and Canada.
The new agreements on labor and environmental issues have changed virtually no one's position on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
That is bad news for the Clinton Administration because the most organized and numerous pressure groups are those that fear they will be hurt by the pact, and the Administration was counting on the agreements to bring some of them around.


A School Board in California Makes Room for Creationism
A local school board that has become a test case in a nationwide ideological battle has taken its boldest step to require the teaching of biblical creationism and weaken the teaching of evolution in classrooms.
Under the policy adopted Thursday night by the board in the city of Vista, teachers discussing evolution may not be dogmatic about it and must cover scientific criticism of the theory, and creationism must be discussed when appropriate in history and literature classes.


Money Fund Assets Down
The total assets of the nation's 645 retail money market mutual funds decreased $1.05 billion, to $389.18 billion, for the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said on Thursday.
The assets of the 404 taxable retail money market funds were down $806.6 million, to $306.25 billion, while the assets of the 241 retail tax-exempt funds decreased $246.4 million, to $82.93 billion.


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Sampras Wins Once, Agassi Wins Twice  Pete Sampras, facing two matches yesterday because of a rain delay in the $1.65 million Thriftway ATP championship in Mason, Ohio, won the first by overcoming a 4-0 second-set deficit on the way to beating Aaron Krickstein, 6-2, 7-5.
The tournament lost four more seeded players, leaving only Sampras, No. 3 Stefan Edberg and No. 7 Michael Chang.
No. 10 Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine lost to a qualifier, Steve Bryan, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6).
Andre Agassi, trying to return to form after being bothered by tendinitis in his wrist, won twice.
In a morning match, he beat Doug Flach, 7-5, 6-1, then came back in the afternoon to beat No. 4 Michael Stich, 6-3, 6-2, and become the first player to advance to the semifinals. (AP) Argentine Finds Fault and Default: Guillermo Perez-Roldan was defaulted from the San Marino ATP tournament yesterday when he refused to resume play after losing the first-set tie breaker, 7-5.
The third-seeded Argentine, who won this clay-court tournament in 1990 and 1991, was riled by a controversial call by an umpire that gave Renzo Furlan of Italy a 5-4 lead in the first-set tie breaker of their quarterfinal match.
Perez-Roldan was defaulted when refused to resume play in protest. (AP)


Hotel Collapses in Thailand, Killing at Least 40


Executive Changes
ATMOS ENERGY CORP., Dallas, a natural gas distributor, appointed H. F. Harber, vice president for human resources and administration, to senior vice president.
He assumes the duties of Jerry D. Knierim, who is retiring as executive vice president of corporate services.
Mr.
Harber's previous responsibilities will be consolidated in his new position.


Much Ado About 'Louie'
With some 1,200 incarnations, "Louie Louie" is the most recorded song in pop music.
In a new book, "Louie Louie," the rock critic Dave Marsh chronicles the social history of this 1963 American classic from innocent ditty about a lovesick Jamaican sailor to anthem of a generation.
In this excerpt, Mr Marsh describes the F.B.I. investigation to determine if the lyrics were obscene.


Counters of Plastic Laminate Call for Tender, Loving Care
ORDINARY kitchen and bathroom counters are surfaced with plastic laminate (Formica and Wilsonart are well-known brands).
The material consists of paper sheets saturated with plastic resin, which are pressed together and heated to form the finished product.
Plastic laminate is tough and durable in many ways, but easily damaged in others.
Unfortunately, repairing damaged laminate is often impossible, and patching or replacing it is the only solution.


When a Medley of Tongues Speaks the Language of Salsa
Jose Chombo Silva, the veteran Cuban saxophonist, blew the last notes of his solo passage, paused for a moment, then peered from the recording studio into the engineering room.
"Esta bien?" he asked. ("Was that all right?") Behind the soundproof plate glass, Boncana Maiga, the Malian music director, switched on a microphone and answered in Mr.
Silva's native Spanish: "Excelente!"
Ibrahima Sylla, the Senegalese producer, beckoned to the saxophonist, took hold of his arm and named a half-dozen of his records.
"Tell Senor Silva I've listened to him since I was a schoolboy," Mr.
Sylla said in Mandingo to Mr.
Maiga, who repeated the tribute in Spanish.


Shellfish Confidential: Trying to Score Inside the Tidal Zone
The rewards of gathering soft-shelled and hard-shelled clams (steamers and quahogs), blue mussels and blue crabs, are well-known, but most foragers ignore some equally tasty denizens of littoral areas: Atlantic surf clams, lady crabs, sand eels and silverside minnows.
Atlantic surf clams, or sea clams, range from Nova Scotia to South Carolina and are often found less than 50 yards from shore, whether in ocean, sound or bay.
Most sea clams are harvested by boat-towed hydraulic dredges, but those in shallow water may be easily plucked from the bottom by any swimmer adept with mask, snorkel and flippers.


The Debate Over la Difference
A WOMAN who makes it to the top of a company is likely to act more like the men who reach the same heights than like women farther down the corporate food chain.
That, at least, was the widespread belief when, in 1990, the Harvard Business Review published an article that begged to differ.
"The Ways Women Lead," by Judy B. Rosener, reported that women were doing very well, thank you, and they were doing it by "behaving like women."


With Talks Idle, Sinn Fein Stumps in Ireland
With the British-sponsored peace talks on Northern Ireland dead or dying, Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, is taking advantage of the vacuum by trying to improve his party's image in the Irish Republic, where support for Sinn Fein and the I.R.A.'s violent campaign is minimal.
While most other political leaders were on vacation, Mr.
Adams made a public appearance in Dublin Thursday night.
He told an audience of 200 that his party was an agent of peace and accused the British and Irish Governments of "demonizing" Sinn Fein, recalling that he was talking about peace with John Hume, a member of the British Parliament from Northern Ireland and a Roman Catholic.


Talking Baseball
To the Sports Editor:
Thad Mumford's premise, that "the game has lost its grip" ("Baseball Comes to a Resounding Sigh," The Times, July 25), is out of touch with the facts.


RUDOLPH GIULIANI
It is nice to see, just once, an assertion that even liberal Democrats possess a frankly racial agenda.
Too often, in our strangulated public discourse, the cliche has it that only Republicans use "code words" and "sow divisiveness." But the Democratic Party has its own brand of verbal demagoguery.
Bill Lynch's comparison of Giuliani to David Duke can be viewed as nothing less than that.
PATRICK A. BERZINSKI Belleville, N.J.


Stanley, I Presume
Like everyone I knew in college in my freshman spring of 1968, I devoted too many nights to meticulous, if stoned, frame-by-frame dissections of Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey." We were miserable.
The Vietnam apocalypse was now.
Kubrick's Cinerama epic, with its recurrent image of a mysterious, tombstone-shaped monolith, beckoning man through time and space to ever higher planes of evolution, was a promise of peace and redemption.
If only we could survive to the next century we'd have all the answers.
I never could have imagined that 25 years later the Vietnam War would be over, I would be a functioning adult, and that one very late July night I would meet Stanley Kubrick in London.
The place was Joe Allen's restaurant, the American expatriates' after-theater hangout in a cellar in Covent Garden.
At my table sat two sharp reporters from the newspaper where I work, women who have cornered subjects as diverse as the President of the United States and David Hampton, the fabled Manhattan scam artist who posed as Sidney Poitier's son.
With us was our friend Larry, the producer, who knows everyone in Hollywood and has long since stopped being impressed by any of them.


In California, Logging Dispute Hits Home for Some
As he worked in the dappled shade of his home office one day in June, Rich G. Kelso could hear the whine of chain saws and crunch of breaking wood from what he had been assured was tree trimming on his neighbor's property.
Then sunlight suddenly flooded his house, and Mr.
Kelso said he got a sinking feeling.
Looking out a 14-foot-wide picture window, he could see men cutting down the last row of trees next to his property, giving him a clear view of a stump-filled hillside that only hours earlier had been an impenetrable shroud of redwoods.


The Executive Life; The Challenging Life of a Corporate Nomad
A LITTLE-TROD career path bred in the technology industry over the last 10 years may yet offer opportunities for the most independent-minded of the nation's unemployed managers: joining the ranks of "rented execs." But would-be rent-execs should be forewarned: the job requires a unique personality and can come with considerable emotional sacrifice.
Typically senior managers, rent-execs have lost interest in the concept of a long-term job at a single company and are hungry for new experiences and independence.
They may be brought in by new companies on the way up, or to help rescue companies on the way down.
Or, in the latest developments of a downsizing age, they may be rented by established companies to deal with special short-term projects.


Will Power


In Kent: 2 Galleries, 3 Sites, 4 Shows
THE scene is the hamlet of Kent and the action, once again, is divided between its two principal galleries, Paris-New York-Kent and Bachelier-Cardonsky.
But there have been some changes: Jacques Kaplan has branched out across the railroad tracks to share space in the old railroad station with Stosh's Ice Cream Parlor.
So now, it is Paris-New York-Kent, The Station, as well as Paris-New York-Kent, The Caboose, and, given the freight train that has taken to riding the long out-of-use rails, its purpose and destination unknown, a future Paris-New York-Kent, The Train, is not out of the question.
Outside The Station are two heads, both Pharaonic in size and cast in glaring white polyester resin.
They are the work of Philip Grausman and signal the presence of "Three Men in a Station," a group in which he plays the dominant part.
Mr.
Grausman is a veteran of six solo shows in Manhattan and as many again in the museums and galleries of New England.
He has also spent much of his 35-year career collecting awards, including a crucial Prix de Rome -- crucial because of the technical skills he was able to acquire while in Italy.


At a Movie-Money Lifeline, It's a Wrap
AST February, Dan Sherkow was gearing up to begin filming an independently made thriller, "Cops." The movie producer had a cast and a director in place and about $13 million in financing lined up through the usual patchwork of banks and advance guarantees from key European distributors.
Then his completion bond fell through, and the entire project was in jeopardy.
Completion bonds are the insurance policies that independent movie makers must get as a prerequisite for bank loans.
They guarantee that if a movie misses deadlines or goes over-budget, a bond company can take over and complete production or repay the lenders.


For Seaside Police, A Hard Day's Night
IT'S closing in on 2 o'clock of a Sunday morning, and this borough's Police Chief, Tony Schremmer, in jeans and a faded cranberry golf shirt, is walking the Boulevard.
About two hours ago, the last families lugging drowsy children left the noise and neon of boardwalk amusements a block away.
In another hour, the next exodus will take place as patrons empty bars and nightclubs along the strip that Chief Schremmer is pacing.
Most will make it back to their own beds.
But, inevitably, some will wind up spending the night across Barnegat Bay in an Ocean County jail.


The Burden of Unhealed Memory
Bob Ojeda remembers the pleasant, shirt-sleeve night, the beauty of the Florida lake, the lights from the houses nearby.
He remembers the laughter of his teammates Tim Crews and Steve Olin as they sped along in Crews's boat last spring.
Then, suddenly, everything changed.
Ojeda says he remembers no sound.
He had taken a fierce blow to the head and wasn't aware until moments later that they had slammed into a pier that jutted out into the lake.
Ojeda's neck ached terribly and he tried to see what was happening.
He felt the inert body of Olin beside him and heard Crews moaning.
Everything was gray, he said, and he felt and smelled blood, a lot of blood.


Alison Becker, Harry Hurt 3d
Harry Hurt 3d is a tall, blond, 41-year-old author who grew up in Texas, graduated from Harvard and lives in Sag Harbor, L.I.
He has written about everything from Texas billionaires to the Apollo astronauts to vigilantes who root drug dealers out of tenements in the Bronx.
His newest book is "Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump" (W. W. Norton).
"I think of Harry as Dick Diver with a red convertible and a silver flask," said Kevin Wade, a screenwriter who also lives in Sag Harbor and wrote "Working Girl." "He's like someone out of a Fitzgerald novel. He's a very presentable bad boy."


Anne M. Coyle and Ralph S. Gill
Anne Maureen Coyle, the director of admissions of the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, was married yesterday to Ralph S. Gill, the president of the Ivy Biotechnology Corporation, a drug research and development company.
Both work in Ithaca, N.Y.
The Rev.
George S. Salzman performed the ceremony at St.
Paul's Catholic Church in Cambridge, Mass.
Ms.
Coyle, 31, is keeping her name.
She graduated from Harvard University, from which she also received a master's degree in public administration.


With All Plants Drooping, What to Do?
UNTIL steady rainfall comes to assuage the dry ground and fill the reservoirs once again, gardeners will have to remain watchful during the Northeast drought.
Many homeowners have been saddened.
Instead of velvety greenswards, suburban lawns are for the most part crunchy strawlike mats.
Huge shade trees are dropping their leaves to reduce the number that have to be supported by a lengthy root system.
Rhododendron leaves are hanging; some are dead.
Even the pachysandra, a stalwart groundcover, is wilting.
Woodlands are dangerously dry.


By Bus to the Berkshires
THE theme from "Midnight Cowboy" droned away deep in my brain, a reflex action, no doubt.
I was on a bus, not my usual M-104, zipping up Broadway, but a serious, long-haul bus, with gray velour seats and a bathroom in the rear.
If we kept to our schedule, I'd be on board for 5 hours and 10 minutes, the rather daunting time it would take to get from New York City to my destination, Williamstown, Mass., in the Berkshires.
That was plenty of time to take in the lush summer greenery, neat clapboard houses and glittering streams that line Route 7 through western Connecticut and Massachusetts.
Plenty of time, as well, to mull over whether taking the bus was a big adventure, a big mistake or no big deal.


Corrections
An article last Sunday about the evolution of cyberpunk referred incorrectly to the creators of emoticons.
They are Seth Godin and David Sanderson.
The article also referred incorrectly to a co-author of the book "Cyberpunk, Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier"; she is Katie Hafner.
In addition, the article misidentified the data medium on which the electronic essays "Beyond Cyberpunk" were published.
It was a hypercard stack, not a hyperstack card.


Making It as a Mainstream Director
Oprah Winfrey's latest project is "There Are No Children Here," a made-for-television movie based on Alex Kotlowitz's searing account of life in a Chicago public housing project.
Ms.
Winfrey's Harpo Productions is producing it, and she is playing a leading role.
The script is by Bobby Smith Jr., a black writer.
And the director is Anita Addison, a 36-year-old black woman.


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
SHETLAND FIDDLERS
Twelve of the 60 fiddlers who make up Shetland's Young Heritage will perform on Saturday from 2:30 to 4:30 P.M. at Boscobel in Garrison.
The fiddlers, who are 13 through 25 years old, will be accompanied by Walt Michael and Company, the popular Hudson Valley string ensemble.
The Scottish group was formed in 1981, dedicated to preserving the music and culture of the Shetland Islands, an archipelago off northern Scotland.
Their current tour of the eastern United States, including performances at the White House and the Smithsonian Institution, was underwritten by the British Council in Washington and cultural agencies in the Shetlands.


Part Of the Process
To the Editor:
While Jack Anderson's essay on dance preservaton, "Putting Dances in a Safe Place"  [ Aug. 1 ] , focused on the continuing debate over dance notation versus film and videotape, there are broader issues surrounding the subject.


RUDOLPH GIULIANI
Rudolph Giuliani says he wants "to get New York to stop thinking about all this symbolism." Yet it is the symbolism we do think about when he marches in the St.
Patrick's Day parade with the Ancient Order of Hibernians, without making an equal gesture to the Irish Gay and Lesbian Organization, and when he chooses to run on a ticket with a woman who voted against a gay rights bill in March 1986.


Conversations/Christine Craft; Revenge of a Former Talking Head: Seen Less but Heard More
CHRISTINE CRAFT swims laps every night right before her broadcast, planning the provocative topics she will discuss on her radio talk show.
Then she goes on the air with wet hair, wearing leggings, a football jersey and not one iota of makeup.
That working costume is a far cry from what Ms.
Craft wore as a television anchor in Kansas City in 1983, when she was forced to put on blouses with bows, blazers with crisp collars and gobs of foundation to narrow what her bosses considered a jutting chin.


AUG. 8-14: What's Arafat's Line?; Israel Ends Bar to Role Of P.L.O. at Peace Talks
For years a defining element of Israeli policy toward the Arabs has been a ban on talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization on the ground that it is a terrorist organization.
But Israel's resolve has been steadily weakening.
In January it repealed the law against contacts with P.L.O. members, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin recently authorized his Environment Minister to meet secretly with a senior official of the organization.
Last week the Rabin Government took its biggest step toward lifting the ban: It said it would continue to negotiate with key Palestinian delegates to peace talks despite the fact that they were just named P.L.O. officials.
The delegates from the occupied territories were long known to represent P.L.O. positions anyway, so in practice the change may be merely public acceptance of longstanding reality.
Still, the announcement by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres had symbolic weight, and brought protests from Israel's right wing.

SPORTS MEMOIR SEASONS TO REMEMBER The Way It Was in American Sports, 1945-1960.
By Curt Gowdy with John Powers.
HarperCollins, $23.


Japanese Are Long Way From an Indy-Car Start
With the increasing weakness of the International Motor Sports Association's sports car series and Nascar's ban on foreign cars, the only high-profile outlet left for Japanese automakers in this country is Indy-car racing.
So Toyota's announcement on Aug. 5 that it will study the feasibility of entering that series, possibly as early as 1995, was no surprise.
Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., the company's American wing, now joins American Honda in dipping its toe into the Indy-car pond.


Walk, Don't Run
WHEN Naomi Campbell slid giggling to the ground, her legs folded under her like a giraffe's, platform shoes seemed doomed.
The model's collapse at Vivienne Westwood's fall show in Paris was proof that for modern women, club-sandwich-sized soles are hard to take.
So how come so many designers are proposing that women walk tall?
Platform shoes may not reach the dizzy heights of Ms.
Westwood's creations, but they are still a big step up from the sensible footwear in which women have been leveling with men.


Asbestos Tests Highlight Agency Flaws
At the heart of the New York City public schools asbestos scandal is a huge and largely hidden bureaucracy with a history of bribery, mismanagement and ineptitude.
It is the division of school facilities, the organization that so mishandled the building of city schools that the Legislature stripped it of construction powers in 1988.
Today it is responsible only for maintenance, but it has developed a backlog of 44,000 work orders.


A Prescription For Summer Blahs

The Lawyer's Rite of Passage
While members of the American Bar Association dined on steak in New York last week, would-be lawyers chewed their nails.
About 50,000 people took bar exams last month and are awaiting their scores.
If the 1992 results are any indicator, test-takers in Utah need only nibble around the cuticles; test-takers in the District of Columbia need Band-Aids.


Julia F. Bator, Charles Duggan
Julia Franciska Bator, the daughter of Mrs.

Sex, Maps and Videotape
I HAVE just been out exercising my libido, terrorizing the town at the wheel of a black '93 Dodge Viper, and my head hurts.
That is because (a) the boom of the 8-liter V10 has addled my brain, or (b) because of the bright sun on my pate.
Understand, with a Viper you have to construct the roof almost from scratch every time you want some shade, so you just don't do it.


Worrisome Foursome Betrays The Giants
The Giants tried a three-man defensive front tonight against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Sometimes the Giants tried four men.
Other times it looked as if they might try 11 and still would not be able to consistently stuff the run or get to the quarterback.
Injuries have depleted the Giants' pressure up front and the Steelers took full advantage, winning by 23-17 in preseason action before 57,681 fans at Giants Stadium.
But there were bright spots for New York.


AUG. 8-14: A Mission and a Mystery; A C.I.A. Agent Is Slain In Formerly Soviet Georgia
With his country torn by civil strife and a secessionist movement, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the President of Georgia and former Soviet Foreign Minister, was concerned for his safety.
Last year he asked the Bush Administration to provide Central Intelligence Agency agents to help train his personal security force.
Last week, one of the agents sent to Georgia, Fred Woodruff, 45, was shot and killed while driving to Tbilisi, the capital, from the country's north.
R.
James Woolsey Jr., the Director of Central Intelligence, flew to Tbilisi to retrieve the body.

What's Wrong With Buying Black
To the Editor:
I don't know how blacks will react to the suggestion that they "buy black," even to the point of seeking out black physicians.
But I know how I would reply if anyone told me to "buy female." I intend to keep spending my hard-earned money where I can get the best product or service for the best price, regardless of the race or sex of the provider.
And I can't help wondering whether if the author were facing surgery, he would look for anything other than the best surgeon he could find (who, of course, might or might not be black).

Liege Casts Its Eye on a Native Son
"ONE would have to say his feet had carried him without his knowledge, by force of habit, to the Brasserie Dauphine. He greeted the proprietor, sniffed the restaurant's warm smell and went over to his corner where he had sat on the bench thousands of times before.

Pope Expounds Stern Guidelines, Warning U.S. Could Lose Its Soul
In the most explicit and emotional language he has used in his current visit to the United States, Pope John Paul II today lamented "the false morality" of modern society, labeling abortion and euthanasia "the slaughter of the innocents." He urged young people, in particular, to practice "natural" birth control rather than using artificial methods, including condoms.
In remarks at a prayer service with bishops and young Catholics this afternoon, the Pope also touched for the first time since his arrival here on Thursday on the highly controversial issue of the sexual molestation of young people by Catholic priests.


At Work; New Reminders on Harassment
IT may be true, as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission contends, that the agency's new regulations on harassment in the workplace break no new legal or policy grounds.
But the regs, which will be published for comment by the public as soon as the Office of Management and Budget and everyone else within the Government has had his or her say, may by their very existence send a message to companies about firming and toning their harassment policies.
The regs are in the pipeline at least in part because sexual harassment has received so much attention in the last few years, obscuring harassment based on race, religion, national origin and disability.
They are a reminder that all forms of harassment are discrimination and that proving it rests on similar legal arguments.


Ranking Our Poets
To the Editor:
On July 18, Rachel Hadas slyly made a case for Mona Van Duyn and John Hollander -- yes, Virginia, John Hollander -- as "major" poets.
On July 25 (in response to a reader's letter), David Lehman described Frank O'Hara and John Ashbery as "two of the greatest poets of our time."


Who Was Gret Palucca? A Legend in Her Time
Gret Palucca died in Dresden late in March at the age of 91.
This news, which went virtually unreported in this country, may cause some American dance lovers to sigh, "How sad." Many others, though, will look puzzled and wonder, "Who was Gret Palucca?"
In Europe, Palucca remains a legendary name in modern dance.
She had a devoted public.
Intellectuals theorized about her, and artists sketched her.
That Palucca is largely unknown in the United States serves as chilling evidence of how unpredictably evanescent the art of dance can be.
Dances and choreographers are easily forgotten.
And audiences in one corner of the world may have no idea of what is being -- or has been -- staged elsewhere.

His Bag: a Brown Paper Bag
A man wearing a particularly novel accessory was strolling the streets of Southampton, L.I.
His name was Valentine Paluck Jr., and he had a brown paper bag on his head.
Cuffed and perfectly fitted, it didn't look stupid; indeed, it was practically chic.
Mr.
Paluck (right), 27, a photographer, has worn these homemade hats off and on since his college days in Virginia.
"I worked at this cafe," he said.
"The health inspector came one day and told all the women that they had to cover their hair and we didn't have hats so everybody put paper bags on their heads for the day."


Russian Gifts: A Tax Warning
While Russia grapples with reforming its restrictive Soviet-era export regulations, tourists should be careful to get proper documentation for their souvenirs or risk being slapped with a 600 percent customs tax at the airport.
According to the outmoded 1990 legislation, tourists may take home gifts costing less than 300 rubles free of charge.
In 1990 that was officially $500, but inflation has whittled it down to about 30 cents today.
For gifts worth more than 30 cents, travelers' generous impulses may be rewarded with a hefty tax at the airport.


Filling Philadelphia's Bank-Financing Gap
Several older office towers financed by GE Capital Services have undergone significant renovations in this city's downtown, where one estimate puts the Class B vacancy rate at 37 percent, even as competing buildings are mothballed or auctioned.
GE Capital's moves are evidence of the change in real estate financing to more long-term investors -- primarily finance companies and real estate investment trusts that can tolerate greater risk and wait longer for their returns.
In 1990, GE Capital took back two 1920's medical office buildings with more than 200,000 square feet of Class B space from Allan Pullman, who defaulted on $35 million in loans.
The buildings were sold to GMH Associates of Wayne, Pa., for $24 million and then renovated at a cost of $5.5 million.
GE took the mortgage for both the building and the renovation costs.


Monzon Allowed Out
The former world middleweight champion CARLOS MONZON, halfway through an 11-year sentence for murder, will be allowed to spend daytime hours and weekends outside prison, according to officials in Santa Fe, Argentina.

He will be eligible for parole in 1995, when he completes two thirds of his sentence.
Starting yesterday, he was also allowed to train amateur boxers at a local gym and return to prison at night, the official news agency Telam reported.

The Gods Hunker Down For Another Nasty Twilight
In dead earnest, the participants compare it to the House of Atreus or, closer to home, Wotan and his extended family of Germanic gods.
The less reverential might invoke "Dallas" or a typical afternoon with Oprah.
Either way, the family squabbles among the heirs of Richard Wagner over who will next run the Bayreuth Festival are complex and bitter.
They have led to a situation in which no one -- not even the current chief, Wolfgang Wagner, who turns 74 in two weeks -- has any real idea what will happen next.
It was Richard Wagner who built the Bayreuth Festspielhaus and opened the first festival in 1876, as an annual shrine devoted to his works.
He ran the festival until his death in 1883 and was succeeded by his wife, Cosima, and his son, Siegfried, both of whom died in 1930.
Winifred, Siegfried's English-born widow, ran Bayreuth from 1930 to 1934.
She was (and, at 96, still is) a great admirer of Hitler and was barred by the Allies from having anything to do with the festival.


The Lobster Shift
The first Maine i knew was a picture-postcard Maine, summer at Hancock Point, a jagged jut of earth and black rock northeast of Mount Desert Island, bisected by a single road, crisscrossed with a handful of prim little streets.
On the surface, it was exactly what I'd sought for two months of hermitage: an endless playground.
But my orderly days of tennis and swimming, writing and cooking were somehow haunted by my having missed the point.
An agenda, I've learned over the years, is not something one takes to this corner of the country.
One takes sturdy boots, big sweaters, yellow slickers, good books, dry matches and a supple appetite.
Maine is a state of vicissitudes, mostly of weather, but then of mood.
To submit to its domineering geography, at least for the summer, is sublime.


Trade Pact Involves Delicate Talks With Congress
American officials conducted two sets of North American trade negotiations this summer.
One was with Mexico and Canada, to draft side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement that would prevent harm to workers and the environment as tariff and other trade barriers are dismantled.
The other talks, more informal, were with Congress, as Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, tried to gauge how much he could offer Democrats, unions and environmental groups without losing the agreement's core constituency of Republicans and corporations.

Jordan Case Investigators Have a Lead
Authorities investigating the death of Michael Jordan's father said today that they had identified at least two people they believe could lead them to his killers.
As the investigation's second full day continued with the involvement of several law enforcement agencies, including the F.B.I., officials from the Cumberland County, N.C., Sheriff's office said they believed that the two people, whom they did not identify, had driven James P. Jordan's car from where the killing might have occurred to the remote spot outside of Fayetteville where it was found vandalized on Aug. 5.

How the Rich Get Richer
To the Editor:
In his review of "A Short History of Financial Euphoria" (July 18), Robert Krulwich, like the author, John Kenneth Galbraith, does not seem to realize that while the rich often do get carried away and lose their fortunes, they do not get rich simply because they are lucky.


Paris Revealed, Down by the Seine
MOST visitors to Paris know that life there began on the river, and if they don't, they soon learn.
Not only do they find themselves constantly crossing the Seine to get to the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, the great squares and shops of the Right Bank, the Eiffel Tower and famous cafes of the Left Bank, but images of it are everywhere: on postcards, in books of photographs and in Impressionist paintings.
Even the city's official logo of a sailing ship pays tribute to this river that is Paris's heart and soul, and that courses through it in a grand seven-mile arc.
This being so, visitors cheat themselves if they confine their experience of the Seine to hurried trips across it on their ways elsewhere.


BEIJING RESTRICTS LAND SPECULATION
Pressing ahead with its clampdown on runaway economic growth, the Chinese Government has banned new golf courses and announced that work on some luxury hotels and villas will be halted even though they are already partly built.

Thousands of small property companies have been making huge profits by "chao di," or "stir-frying property" -- buying and reselling in a speculative frenzy.

What's Wrong With Buying Black
To the Editor:
"Buy Black" was probably the most racist piece that I have ever read in a general-circulation newspaper.
You didn't publish it under the title "Don't Buy White" or "Don't Buy Korean," but that is exactly what it was saying.
It was a counterproductive, exclusionary and divisive article.

POSTINGS: $500 Waldorf Tour; A Chance to See How Suite It Is
They've never been open to the public.
But now, one time only, for $500 a person, 50 lucky people can visit some of the most famous, private and exclusive suites at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
The tour, Sept. 9 at 4 P.M., is sponsored by the New York Landmarks Conservancy as part of its celebration of the Waldorf's 100th anniversary, and all proceeds go to help the conservancy's preservation work.
The visit includes the suite of the President of the United States, the residence of the United States Representative to the United Nations, the soup and pastry kitchens, the silver room and the "New York, New York" home of that stranger in the night, Frank Sinatra.


Fiscal Fog Blankets New York
New York City's Financial Control Board has squandered its public trust.
With Maestro Mario Cuomo on the podium, the board last week sang praises for Mayor David Dinkins's budget discipline, mainly because he promises to get serious after Election Day.
Until this blatant intrusion on the mayoral campaign, the board could be counted on for unvarnished truth about city finances.

It's August; How Much Policy Can a Nation Take?
SAY of them what you will, Ronald Reagan and George Bush knew the value of a good rest from the public eye.
Every August, Mr.
Reagan flew to Santa Barbara and disappeared for a month, visible only rarely and only by telephoto lens, riding horses and clearing pesky brush.
Mr.
Bush went to Maine and rode boats and played golf.
Momentous and terrifying world events sprang up with lunar regularity in August but dynamite could not have extracted these Presidents from their leisures.
January's Man from Hope, Ark., by contrast, threatens daily to become August's Man from Boring, Md.
President Clinton has spent more time on television in the last seven months than Willard Scott.
He has been host to domestic roundtables, proposed Russian economic rescue plans, contorted himself over policies on gay soldiers and illegal nannies.
He has peddled budgets and stimulus packages and motor-voter schemes and campaign-finance reform, and heaven help us all, it is blazing hot outside and he is only now getting to the really mind-numbing stuff.


Watch This Intellectual Space . . .
Take off all your clothes and smear your body with chocolate.
Scatter severed body parts from dead cows on the steps of public buildings.
Shave half your head and dress half as a man, half as a woman.
Then get the government to pay you for doing it.
Welcome to the world of conceptual art.
Conceptual artists, like their more traditional colleagues, like to challenge the public's sense of what's normal, what's real, what's art.
Their medium is themselves.
Most of them have a pretty highly developed sense of the ridiculous, so maybe it was just a matter of time before some of them decided to go one step further.


When Banks Make Currency Go Up and Down
To the Editor:
In "Central Banks Make It Easy to Bet Big on a Sure Thing" (Business Day, Aug. 3), you note that European central banks have given away "hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars" in failed attempts to defend certain currencies, particularly buying French francs, which were collapsing in value.
This, you write, "again raised the question of why European governments, which end up paying the losses of their central banks, have been so willing to put up with a system that makes such losses a periodic inevitability."


When Men Were Men (and Women Were Too)
Last year "The Crying Game" had as its secret a woman who turned out to be a man.
"Orlando," which opened in June, sketched the life of a character who started out as a man and ended up, four centuries later, a woman.
"The Ballad of Little Jo," opening on Wednesday, is inspired by the story of Josephine Monaghan, who, in order to better herself, lived as a man in the 1800's.
Little was known about the woman who was cast out of her family because she had a child out of wedlock.
She moved from Buffalo to the West, adopting men's clothing somewhere en route.


Form Over Function And Hairdos
Aerodynamic styling makes these 1950's hair dryers look more powerful than they really are.
These dryers emit the gentlest of breezes compared to today's higher-wattage versions, which must have been O.K. in the 50's, when fewer women had to get to work.


Sports of The Times; Baseball Lucked Out In Last Race
TAKE a look around you.

Try to catch the score of the Red Sox-Blue Jays game in Fenway when it comes around on the accursed message board that takes the place of a real scoreboard.
This is a pennant race.
This is the last one.
Take a good look.
There are people who wished they had taken one last look at Ebbets Field or Pennsylvania Station or the American buffalo herds, to commit them to memory before the money people tore them down or shot them.


Another Sour Note in a Swan Song for Geese
SOME people hate them, some put up with them, but the county's Canada geese seem serenely not interested in popularity polls.
Now, to dislodge their flocks from suburban lawns and pondside, where their droppings and moltings annoy property owners and strollers, the State Department of Environmental Conservation has decided to allow hunters a special season to shoot the birds.
Excessive droppings in the reservoirs, furthermore, are considered a potential source of bacteria by department officials.


Nicaragua Might Prefer Benign Neglect
To the Editor:
"Testing Time for Mrs. Chamorro" (editorial, July 30) demands that Gen.

Hot Stuff


HEALTH CARE REFORM
John Hubner's article "The Abandoned Father of Health-Care Reform" (July 18) states that Alain Enthoven's ideas threaten the insurance industry, but it fails to point out that a handful of big insurance companies -- among them, Aetna, Prudential, Cigna, Travelers and Met Life -- stand to reap an enormous windfall from Enthoven's "managed competition," should it come to pass.
These firms largely will control the system and will manage many of the health care networks under Enthoven's model.


Unfeathered Boas
On a hot day recently, two owners of Burmese pythons took their six-foot-long pets for a swim in the Washington Square fountain.
On a recent Sunday, four young snake enthusiasts had lunch near the Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park while their pets cavorted in the grass.
Nearby, a three-foot-long boa constrictor knotted itself around the low branches of a tree as a crowd gathered to gawk and touch the exotic reptile.
One man tied a red AIDS-awareness ribbon onto the snake coiled around his neck.
Spotting pet pythons or iguanas on shoulders about town was a rarity 10 years ago.
Today, it's not uncommon.


Red or Green, Now It's Tomato Time
IT is now the season for my favorite summer lunch: red, ripe tomatoes.
I love to eat them picked straight off the vine, still warm from the sun.
I slice them onto toasted peasant bread, adding extra-virgin olive oil, sea salt and pepper, a few leaves of basil and perhaps some raw onion. (I confess that sometimes I even top this with canned sardines and brown the whole thing under a broiler -- I guess there's no accounting for taste.)
Raw tomatoes also make a delicious pasta sauce that has endless variations.
Among the ingredients that can be judiciously added are basil, chopped mozzarella, black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, capers, toasted pine nuts, hot pepper flakes, chopped raw onion and even anchovies.

She graduated from Hamilton College and from Columbia University, and received a master's degree in nursing from the University of Pennsylvania.


The Peephole Approach to Artist Couples
Not even the Sun has caused blood to boil in the veins of art world regulars in the Hamptons this summer as much as a silly biography of two of their own, Elaine and Willem de Kooning.
"Elaine and Bill: Portrait of a Marriage" is by Lee Hall, who, you will be stunned to discover -- if you are unwise enough actually to read it -- was for many years president of the Rhode Island School of Design.
She says she was also a friend of Elaine de Kooning's, although you wouldn't think so from her demeaning portrayal.
With any luck, this book will disappear as quickly as the heat.
Gossipy, turgidly written, chockablock with nasty quotations from anonymous sources, it is riddled with the sort of sloppiness that at one point places Mr. de Kooning at a reception at the Museum of Modern Art with Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller Sr., who died in 1915, before the museum was founded and when Mr. de Kooning was an 11-year-old boy living in his native Netherlands.


Curator's Role In Art Show at Cafe
Although pleased at having press coverage of my work ("Along With Croissants, Cafe Offers an Attitude," July 11), I was dismayed that the driving force of the art at Cafe Newz, the curator of this exhibition and many others like it, was not mentioned.


Elevating the Sorriest Scoundrel
THE worst thing about "Our Country's Good" by Timberlake Wertenbaker, now at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale, is that there is no way to describe it without making it sound dreary, which it most certainly is not.
It could be said that the play is about the travails of British convicts who have been condemned to exile in Australia.
It also could be said that the play is about the developing love affair between a married British officer and one of the female prisoners in his charge.
Descriptions like these, although true, do not serve to attract audiences.


Spies in the Battle for the Environment
Seated in the steamy front seat of a van without air-conditioning, two men peered through a pair of binoculars into the wilds of the Bronx frontier marked by trucking depots and factories, vacant lots, high grass, narrow streets and -- to the men's chagrin -- piles upon piles of illegally dumped refuse.
For years, the East River fringes of Hunts Point have been one of many haunts for Joe Montalto and Edward F. Lassen, members of a dwindling breed of stealthy, armed garbage men known as the New York City Sanitation Police.

Grace Hartigan Still Hates Pop
In the first room of the "Handpainted Pop" show at the Whitney, two big paintings by Grace Hartigan boil over with energy.
"Billboard" (1957), with its large gestures and thick paint, organizes a roiling Abstract Expressionist composition into an irregular grid of color patches enclosing figures, faces, fruit and hints of objects alive somewhere in the depths of paint.
In "Grand Street Brides" (1954), loosely and vigorously drawn in a style reminiscent of Willem de Kooning and John Graham, six towering women are in some danger of being overwhelmed by isolation, overpainting and revisions.
"Hand-Painted Pop: American Art in Transition, 1955-62" (a show of more than 100 works by 21 artists, on view through Oct. 10) means to prove that Pop Art was not an abrupt break with Abstract Expressionism but a slow evolution during which artists combined gestural brushwork with representations based on popular culture.
Grace Hartigan looks good in concert with Larry Rivers, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol and company, but what she is doing there is another matter.


Nonresident Fees Would Hurt Libraries
I read, with interest, your front-page article on June 27 discussing the fact that nonresidents use many libraries in Westchester.
Last year the Greenburgh Town Board unanimously approved a resolution calling on the White Plains Library to continue to stay a member of the Westchester Library System.
We want to make sure that the White Plains Library does not establish nonresident fees for those who do not live in that city.
I hope that every library in the county will continue to share books and programs with residents of other Westchester communities and be good neighbors.

In the battle for the affections of George M. Steinbrenner 3d, New York City is trying to be a good landlord at Yankee Stadium, but city and state officials know New Jersey will woo the club with assurances that three million fans per season would attend a state-of-the-art ball park -- more than has ever filed through the team's Bronx turnstiles.
"They're courting him with charm," said Ellen Baer, the chief of staff for New York City's First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel.
"We're courting him with parking spaces."


Indonesia Reduces Separatist's Prison Term
The East Timor separatist leader who was sentenced to life imprisonment in May has had his sentence reduced to 20 years by President Suharto, the Indonesian Government announced Friday.
The separatist, Jose Alexandre Gusmao, who is known as Xanana, had been found guilty of rebellion and firearms possession after a trial in East Timor, which was a Portuguese colony until 1975.


The Executive Computer; Memory Chip Prices Take the Up Stairs Again
HERE we go again.
Prices for computer memory chips have doubled in the past month, touching off a panic among computer makers and raising the possibility that computer prices will rise -- or at least stop falling for a while.
Sharp price swings are nothing new to the memory chip business, perhaps the most volatile of computer component industries.
Prices more than quadrupled in the late 1980's and then reversed direction to become cheaper than ever in the early 1990's.


Under the Spell Of Banda
To the Editor:
Having been in California recently I am now under the spell of "musica banda," the latest in Mexican-American music, song and dance ("Loud and Proud," July 25).
I can also suggest a derivation of this near-hypnotic sound from Czech-Bohemian traditional folk music.
The polka originated in Bohemia, and the "polka Mexicana" has long been a popular form north and south of our border with Mexico.


AUG. 8-14: Now That's Brass; Corps Contretemps Upstages Clinton's New Military Chief
It was supposed to be the day President Clinton would snap a smart salute to the Pentagon and receive one in return.
With all the pomp that accompanies a Rose Garden ceremony, Mr.
Clinton on Wednesday announced the appointment of Gen.
John Shalikashvili, 57, to succeed Gen.
Colin L. Powell as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Unlike other appointments, this one had not run into glitches, and the choice of a widely respected warrior seemed destined to smooth the rocky relations between the military and the Commander in Chief who once avoided the draft.


Nigerian Runner Disputes Drug Report
The German newspaper Suddeutsche-Zeitung reported today that Nigeria's four world-class sprinters had tested positive for the use of banned drugs.
But Daniel Effiong, the only one of the four competing here in the world outdoor track and field championships, said the report was exaggerated.
The four runners are American collegians: Effiong, who attends Central Arizona College; Olapade Adeniken, who won the National Collegiate Athletic Association 100-meter and 200-meter titles in 1992 for Texas-El Paso, and the twins Davidson and Osmond Ezinwa, who attend Azuza Pacific.


Carol Ann Raub, Andrew M. Sieg
Carol Ann Raub, a daughter of Richard C. Raub of Pittsburgh and Carol Philabaum of Coraopolis, Pa., was married yesterday to Andrew M. Sieg, a son of Philip and Judith Sieg of Bellefonte, Pa.

Results Plus
TENNIS  Edberg Upsets Sampras in Ohio Stefan Edberg tamed Pete Sampras's blistering serve last night, beating the No. 1-ranked player in the world in three sets to advance to the finals of the $1.65 million Thriftway ATP Championship in Mason, Ohio.
Edberg and Michael Chang play for the championship Sunday afternoon.
No. 3-seed Edberg, who won the tournament in 1987 and 1990, won, 6-7 (7-3), 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), in a match that took 2 hours 43 minutes.
Sampras's serve was particularly effective in the first set, when he had 13 aces.
But it failed him in the second set, when he double-faulted nine times. (AP)


For Japan, the Old Slurs Are the New Party Line
CHANGE in Japan often seems glacial, a process of half-steps that usually add up to little.
Then there are periods like the last 10 days.
In a complex about-face, Japan has broken through a half-century of denials, speaking frankly about the terrible mistakes of World War II and about the dynamics of its economy.
But while the Japanese now express shame over what their military leaders did during World War II, they feel just fine, thank you, about what their economic leaders have done ever since.

The Dead Band Society
WHAT: Metal Leg: The Steely Dan Magazine, a fanzine devoted exclusively to the sardonic 70's pop band.
It recorded its last album in 1980 and quietly disbanded the next year.
"It's all these things you wanted to know about Steely Dan but were afraid to ask," said the editor, Peter Fogel, 34.
WHY ASK?
Because Steely Dan never really went away.
The band's music -- their hits include "Rikki Don't Lose That Number," "Peg" and "Hey 19" -- fits like an Earth Shoe on classic-rock and contemporary-jazz radio-station formats.
As a Presidential candidate, Bill Clinton played "Reeling in the Years" at campaign stops last year.
Steely Dan CD's remain among MCA Records' most consistent sellers; their fussily produced music sounds even more pristine in that format.
Toss in the reclusive nature of the band's leaders, the keyboardist-singer Donald Fagen and the guitarist-bassist Walter Becker, and you have a cult for the nostalgic audiophile.


3 Weeks, Many Miles, Gold Medal
It was heartwarming.
It was unlikely.
It was darn near impossible.
And it was a human-interest story that transcended sports, a tribute to one man's unfailing will to persevere and succeed against impossible odds.
The man was Mark Plaatjes, a 32-year-old South African-born black and an American citizen for all of three weeks.
Tonight, in a race that started in 81-degree temperature and 51 percent humidity, a debilitating combination for such a long grind, he won the men's marathon as the world outdoor track and field championships began.


Water Farm In Catskills Has Enemies
The burbling brooks that cut through the hills here have made this area on the edge of the Catskills a trout angler's paradise -- a world-renowned fishing center where environmentalism is a passion verging on a religion.
It was just the kind of place for a conservationist and former Sanskrit scholar like Andrew J. Krieger to move to after leaving Wall Street six years ago and giving up his claim to fame as the world's most daring trader in currency options.
A vegetarian, he named his rolling estate Karma Farms "as a place where good things happen," and even planted grasses and grains so that wildlife would have food during the long, hard winters.


The Ad Campaign; Giuliani: Restating the Record
This is the latest in a series of television advertisements that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor of New York City, has broadcast in recent days.
ON THE SCREEN: Pictures of bearded, sandy-haired lawyer talking in book-lined office, pictures of Mr.
Giuliani greeting merchant at Bronx Terminal Market and an elderly woman at a senior citizens' center.
Camera pans through leafy trees to door of Rutgers Houses housing project on Lower East Side.
Silent captions on screen say: "Rudy Giuliani's office secured over 4,000 criminal convictions in five years," and, "Less than one percent of Giuliani's criminal convictions were overturned." At end, logo appears on blue background: "Rudy Giuliani. He knows how to get things done."
PRODUCER: Garth Group of New York.


How a Father May Figure Into an Athlete's Life
Every Saturday morning during the spring and summer my father and I would greet the dawn.
We never talked about it, but I think he looked forward to the ritual as much as I did.
We would have our breakfast, put on our shorts and sneakers, walk across the street to the school playground and shoot baskets.
Or, shoot at the basket.
I was 8 when we began and my shots barely reached the rim.
My dad said that there was a lot more to the game than shooting and that by the time I was able hit the rim consistently, I would have an idea of how to play the game.
So we worked on dribbling, passing, catching.
Defense.
Coordination.


Taxing the Very Rich
To the Editor:
"This Man Wants to Bury You" (Aug. 1) describes the operations of Service Corporation International (S.C.I.), a triumphal euphemism for a chain of funeral homes.
It says the combined salaries of the three senior officers is $8.6 million.


Rare Slave Badges To Be Sold at Auction
COMING to auction on Sept. 9 is a collection of very rare slave-hiring badges from Charleston, S.C.
Slave-hiring badges were issued to the owners of slaves who wished to rent them out for day work.
In more rural places such an arrangement would have been a purely private affair, but in Charleston the practice became regulated in the early 18th century, and by 1751, hired-out slaves were required to wear badges.
Only 100 or so badges are now extant, and Stack's, which is handling the sale for the John J. Ford Jr.
Collection, estimates that the 14 being offered will bring anywhere from $200 to $4,000.
While thousands of badges are thought to have been issued by Mobile, Ala.; Savannah, Ga., and New Orleans, only badges from Charleston are known to exist.
What happened to all the others is a mystery.


CLINTON IS FACING STATE RESISTANCE ON HEALTH PLAN
Arriving for their annual summer meeting, the nation's governors seized on the issue of health care today, putting President Clinton on notice that his proposal for a uniform system of health insurance should not interfere with state programs already under way.
Several governors attending the meeting of the National Governors' Association made it clear that despite calls for a bipartisan effort to revamp the nation's health care system, there are serious differences dividing the parties, the states, and the Federal and state governments on how to overhaul the system.


Edward K. Strosser, Merin P. Frazier
Merin Porter Frazier, the daughter of Nina Von Eckardt of Jaffrey, N.H., and Charles Frazier of Kings Point, L.I., was married yesterday to Edward K. Strosser, a son of Ann and Kenneth Strosser of Pittsburgh.
The Rev.
Stephanie Nichols, a Unitarian Universalist minister, officiated at the home of the bride's mother.
The bride, 28, will keep her name.
A graduate of the State University at Purchase, N.Y., she received a master's degree in early and elementary education from Hunter College and teaches at the Christ Church Day School in New York.
Her father is a sculptor, and her mother is a painter.
Her stepfather, Wolf Von Eckardt, is an architecture critic.


Apocalypso for Brazil? More Scandal for Italy?
Brazil and Italy have always been rivals for World Cup glory.
Each has captured the coveted trophy three times, and Brazil is the only country that has participated in every final round since the inception of the quadrennial tournament in 1930.
Until three weeks ago, Brazil also had the unique distinction of being the only country in the world without a loss in a World Cup qualifying game, but that all changed July 25 in La Paz with a 2-0 loss to Bolivia.

Coming Soon to a Brisket Near You
THE Agriculture Department last week introduced safe-handling labels, like the one above, that will be required on all raw meat and poultry products sold in the United States starting in mid-October.
The labels were prompted by the Jack-in-the-Box food-poisoning outbreak in the West this year.
Some consumer groups are seeking revisions, while the meat industry says it might not have time to comply.


Corrections
A picture caption on page 42 of The Times Magazine today, with the Fashion column, refers incorrectly to Amanda Harlech's children.
She has a son, Jasset, and a daughter, Tallulah, not two daughters.


Dresden
To the Editor: Just before the Berlin wall came down my husband and I took a tour of Eastern Europe that included a short visit to Dresden.
We were met by a young local tour guide who seemed unhappy to be escorting a group of Americans.
She immediately lectured us on the unnecessary bombing of her city by the Americans in World War II.


Lady Harlech's Album
Amanda Harlech sits in her bedroom lapped in lush velvet.
She looks like the high priestess of Haute Bohemia, with this upright English country house and its rabbit-warren of rooms her gypsy kingdom.
Harlech, a passionate horsewoman, says that she lives in jodhpurs.
But there are Chinese slippers on the floor, and from the table she picks up some feathers that she twists into a dying swan of a hat.
With her slim, pale face, she looks like a portrait of Lady Ottoline Morrell, the exotic creature who fascinated the Bloomsbury set before and after the First World War.


The Man Who Makes Somalia Worse
HE has limited military training and, American officials believe, commands only 300 to 500 lightly armed fighters in Mogadishu.
But even with those meager assets, Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid has been able to wreak havoc in the Somali capital, exposing to public view the kinds of strains inherent in any United Nations peacekeeping operation and raising the specter of the result that Western political and military leaders probably fear most: a quagmire.
That General Aidid has been able to accomplish this is a testament only in part to his ruthlessness and cunning.
More important, his success in troublemaking reflects the skittishness of Western powers fearful of their soldiers being killed in places and conflicts perceived as not directly tied to their strategic interests -- like Somalia and, yes, like Bosnia.

Say It Once More: 'Reggie,' as in Jackson

The New Millionaires: Making It In Tough Times
THEIR megabucks didn't come from Publishers Clearinghouse, a state lottery payoff or a reclusive relative's will, and they haven't been on "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" -- not yet, anyway.
But despite the recession and its still-uncertain aftermath there are a lot of new millionaires out there.
Just how many is unclear.
PSI, a financial services research firm in Tampa, Fla., says there are now about 3.7 million households in the United States with a net worth of $1 million or more, an increase of 900,000 since 1989.
Relying on income-producing assets as its yardstick, the Claritas Corporation, a market research firm in Alexandria, Va., puts the number at 1.04 million, a gain of more than 50,000 in the same period.

Counters of Plastic Laminate Call for Tender, Loving Care
ORDINARY kitchen and bathroom counters are surfaced with plastic laminate (Formica and Wilsonart are well-known brands).
The material consists of paper sheets saturated with plastic resin, which are pressed together and heated to form the finished product.
Plastic laminate is tough and durable in many ways, but easily damaged in others.
Unfortunately, repairing damaged laminate is often impossible, and patching or replacing it is the only solution.

An article on Aug. 1 about over exposed Hollywood stars misrendered one word in a quotation about Arnold Schwarzenegger's appearances on the cover of GQ magazine.
The quotation, from a Daily Variety column by Peter Bart, said, "Three GQ covers alone in the last six years," not "in the last three years."


RUDOLPH GIULIANI
In "Rudolph Giuliani and the Color of Politics in New York" (July 25), Todd S. Purdum places too much emphasis on Giuliani's so-called gaffes.
This election will not be won or lost because of a few gaffes on the part of the contender; it will be decided by the many mistakes of the incumbent.


Liberty Theater
To the Editor:
In your Streetscapes column on July 11 headed "Unlikely 42d St. Revival" I was cited as source for information concerning a connection between 42d Street's Liberty Theater and the scenic artist and decorator Joseph Urban.
I came across an additional piece of documentation confirming this fact too late to be included in the article.


Like, Uptalk?
I used to speak in a regular voice.
I was able to assert, demand, question.
Then I started teaching.
At a university?
And my students had this rising intonation thing?
It was particularly noticeable on telephone messages.
"Hello? Professor Gorman? This is Albert? From feature writing?"
I had no idea that a change in the "intonation contour" of a sentence, as linguists put it, could be as contagious as the common cold.
But before long I noticed a Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation in my own speech.
I first heard it when I myself was leaving a message.
"This is Jim Gorman? I'm doing an article on Klingon? The language? From 'Star Trek'?" I realized then that I was unwittingly, unwillingly speaking uptalk.

Medical Advice For the Tropics
A list of more than 100 travel medicine specialists has been prepared to help travelers, particularly those going to the tropics, find a place to get inoculations and health advice, as well as follow-up on return.
The list is distributed by Dr.
Leonard C. Marcus, a tropical medicine specialist and president of the clinical arm of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, the major United States organization in the field.
According to Dr.
Marcus, the physicians on the list have experiencein tropical medicine and in operating a clinic of this type.
However, he said, it is up to a traveler to ask if the doctor's expertise in diagnosis and treatment is strong in diseases that may be a problem in the countries of the planned trip.


Hog Heaven: High Rates In Hot Nations
The world is not a friendly place for cash these days.
As recession rolls from the United States to Japan to Europe, there is less demand for money and interest rates keep falling.
For a while, those that looked after money market mutual funds and other short-term investments looked to Europe because many countries there were forced to keep rates high in order to keep their currencies on a par with the German mark.
But after the decision two weeks ago to let European currencies float freely, rates will fall.
And so investors are increasingly tempted to send their money far off the beaten path.
They are being lured by offers of rates from 7 percent in Thailand to 9 percent in Argentina, 10 percent in Indonesia and 14 percent just over the border in Mexico.

Women in the Band, the Truck, the Store
THEIR names are Rage, Page, Sage and Pamela, and false eyelashes, red lips and helmets of blonde hair are their trademarks.
They perform as the Gloo Girls, singing screechy rock-and-roll.
Their first album, "Attention Shoppers," will be released this fall by Moving Target Records.
They're also professional furniture movers.
Now, the Gloo Girls, who are the four owners of Amazon Movers, have opened Amazon Moving and Surplus, a secondhand furniture store on Lafayette Street in Manhattan.
The shop, which opened on Aug. 6, proves that these women have an eye for the design of the 1950's and early 1960's, the era that influences their music.

Bubbrother
He shows up at the Chateau Marmont on Sunset Strip with a 32-ounce grape Slurpee in one hand and a Motorola cellular phone in the other.
Hollywood's latest B-movie sensation, coming soon as a Southern mayor named Bubba in "Pumpkinhead 2: Blood Wings" and a Detroit thug named Gino in "National Lampoon's Last Resort," is sunny at first.
He is wearing a purple-fish T-shirt, long white shorts and high-topped Reeboks and his curly hair flows around his shoulders.
Like his brother, he is late, pudgy and puppyish.

Toning Down, John Woo Earns His Hollywood R
There was too much blood, too many bodies flying through the air and too many bullets tearing holes in too much pink flesh.
Six times Universal Pictures submitted "Hard Target," John Woo's first American film, to the motion picture ratings board.
And six times the board refused to give the movie, which stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, an R rating.
It was a bitter lesson in Hollywood film making for Asia's most successful action director.
"I was shocked and very frustrated," says Mr.
Woo, who won an R rating demanded by the studio on the seventh try.
"My kind of action is like a dance, a ballet. The violence in 'Hard Target' -- compared to the movies I made before -- was toned down a lot."


If You're Thinking of Living in: Mamaroneck
NOWHERE was there greater jubilation when Stars and Stripes '87 beat the Australians and brought home the America's Cup than in Mamaroneck.
The sleek 12-meter craft had been built there at the Derecktor Shipyard by Portuguese, Chinese and American craftsmen who live in the village.
Boat-building and sailing have a long tradition there, and marinas and beach clubs line the shore of the second largest natural small-boat harbor on the East Coast -- sometimes hard to see through the forest of masts from 1,500 boats.


Peering Behind the Mask: a Past Looking Back On Its Past
I REMEMBER standing in front of a painting of two Spanish children in old-fashioned costumes.
They are in front of a background of flowers in a field that has a Rousseau-like primitive quality about it, but also something else, more subtle and haunting.
Although the colors in the flesh of the children are distinctly painted, I have the eerie impression that they have faded, even as the time of childhood and of that particular past seems to fade right before my eyes.
I do not know why I am so moved by this particular painting.

Considering what passes for sequels in Hollywood these days, "Annie Warbucks," the follow-up musical to good old lovable "Annie," has no apologies to make.

No Broadway show ever had the rug pulled out from under it so repeatedly and lived to tell a tale.


Loan Fund Helps the Poor and Powerless
IMAGINE if you will, the absurdity of trying to borrow $50,000 to renovate a decrepit house in a run-down neighborhood on a yearly income of $11,000 or less.
Yet the likelihood of getting such a loan is not as farfetched as it would seem, thanks to a relatively new type of lending institution, community-development-loan funds like the Leviticus 25:23 Alternative Fund in Ossining, which makes loans in low-income areas.
"Ours is a fund pledged to helping the poor and powerless," said Brother George C. Schmitz, the fund's executive director, "Our participating members, which include churches, corporations and individuals, all have agreed to lend their money where conventional lending institutions won't, at below-market interest rates to nonprofit organizations whose projects benefit the poor."


SHE'S NO JOCKETTE
Although I am an inveterate sports fan, I am not particularly knowledgeable about racing and, therefore, didn't know about Julie Krone's special story and her charm and grit ("She's No Jockette," July 25).

Thank you for the robust and colorful adventure with this remarkable woman.

The machines typically cost $100,000 to $500,000.
Instead of printing a picture of a screw, say, or a valve, a fabricator "prints" an actual, usable screw or valve by beaming light on multiple layers of photosensitive plastic polymers.
Printing metal objects is the next frontier.
Mr.
Burns is no stranger to computers; as a graduate student at the University of Texas in 1982, he became one of the first nationwide marketers of I.B.M.
PC clones, six months before another Texas student, Michael Dell, started a similar company.
Mr.
Burns folded his company when it became apparent that "Running a computer company and doing graduate work in physics were not compatible." His research company, Ennex Fabrication Technologies in Los Angeles, advises corporations on automated fabrication and its uses.

Redecorating Private Rooms in Political Limelight
Redecorating the White House has always been a prickly issue: How to balance the democratic spirit with the dignity of the Presidential office; how to juxtapose the homey needs of the First Family with the historical hubris of a national house and its caretakers.
But those behind-the-scenes strains became part of a very public mystery this week when a note written by Vincent W. Foster Jr. was released, with its cryptic and angry charge of misdeeds by the little-known White House Usher's Office.


Red or Green, Now It's Tomato Time
IT is now the season for my favorite summer lunch: red, ripe tomatoes.
I love to eat them picked straight off the vine, still warm from the sun.
I slice them onto toasted peasant bread, adding extra-virgin olive oil, sea salt and pepper, a few leaves of basil and perhaps some raw onion. (I confess that sometimes I even top this with canned sardines and brown the whole thing under a broiler -- I guess there's no accounting for taste.)
Raw tomatoes also make a delicious pasta sauce that has endless variations.
Among the ingredients that can be judiciously added are basil, chopped mozzarella, black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, capers, toasted pine nuts, hot pepper flakes, chopped raw onion and even anchovies.


Neil Tuch and Adrienne Polishook
Adrienne Kim Polishook, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Burt Polishook of Greenwich, Conn., was married last evening to Neil Alan Tuch, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Gerald Tuch of North Caldwell, N.J.
Cantor Elliot Levine performed the ceremony at the Rye Town Hilton Hotel in Rye Brook, N.Y.
Mrs.
Tuch, 26, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.
She is a third-year medical student at Temple University.


Q and A
Lack of Maintenance Question: My co-op provided shareholders with their Form 1098 -- the amount of interest paid -- late.
Also, the numbers were wrong.


Grief Over a Dead Child, and Over the Child Accused
Residents of this picturesque village tucked in the lush hills of the Southern Tier say they've now lost two children: a 4-year-old boy and the teen-ager charged with killing him.
"We have been stuck in that place we Protestants don't like to talk about," said the Rev.
Neil Strong of the Savona Federated Church.
"That place called Hades."


DATE RAPE'S OTHER VICTIM
However gifted Katie Roiphe may be at interpreting English literature, she is neither qualified nor apparently motivated to provide a competent critique of the scientific literature on rape ("Date Rape's Other Victim," June 13).
She repeats yet again the charges of other critics that my research reflects a so-called radical, rape-crisis feminist approach to rape.
Examination of the published articles would have shown her that the research is based on a legal definition of rape.


Mashing Potatoes for a Cause
A barbecue and fireworks and then a dance in a tent, all set in a potato field in Sagaponack, L.I., and all for the benefit of the Community Research Initiative on AIDS, Aug. 7.

Jerome Farmer, 73, A Managing Partner of Accounting Firm
Jerome Farmer, the former managing partner of a major accounting company and a retired business executive, died on Thursday at the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
He was 73 and lived in Manhattan, Stonington, Conn., and Tucson, Ariz.
For more than 20 years Mr.
Farmer worked for J. K. Lasser &amp; Company, a leading accounting firm and publisher of a popular annual income-tax guidebook.
He served as managing partner and managing director of its international division.
Lasser eventually merged with Deloitte &amp; Touche.


Alternatives to Jail Save $3 Million
AT $160 a day, a criminal offender's stay in the County Jail here has become an expensive proposition for taxpayers.
A program to divert some nonviolent criminals from prison to rehabilitation services and shelters proved to be a cost-effective alternative last year, saving the county $3 million, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said.
"The criminal-justice system is burdened with individuals whose crimes do not necessarily warrant a jail term and who actually may be better helped by less-expensive programs," Mr.
O'Rourke explained.


The Quick-Fix Pill
To the Editor:
In the aftermath of Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s suicide, the report that his doctor in Little Rock, Ark., mailed the White House lawyer antidepressants contributes to a sense of pathos in the case, instead of sounding the alarm at this dangerous but common practice.


Children With Sawdust in Their Blood
CAMP was winding down for the day.
Julian Vercruyssen, 6, from White Plains, was walking around on stilts.
Todd Strickman, 9, from Rye, was spinning plates on top of long wooden sticks.
Jared Ross, 9, from New Rochelle, was hanging upside down from a trapeze.
"This is easy," each one called out to a visitor. "You should try it."


Corrections
A theater review last Sunday about "City of Angels" at the Gateway Playhouse in Bellport referred incorrectly to three cast members.
They were J. T. Cromwell, Carole Crelin and Frank Kosik.


ONE-WEEK STAND
I agree with those like Frank Rich who criticize "Bridges" for its unsophisticated prose, but I object to his dismissal of Francesca simply because she does not comform to today's erotic ideal of womanhood -- the young, taut female body, as promoted by films and advertising.
He misses precisely the point that she is not a mere object, but a woman who possesses sexual self-esteem in spite of her laugh lines and full womanly figure.
Perhaps your writer cannot grasp how liberating it is for readers to see a middle-aged woman celebrate lust.

Wall Street; It's Hulbert-Bashing Time, Again
BASEBALL, swimming and boating aren't the only great sports of summer.
Not to be forgotten is the late-summer sport of Hulbert-bashing -- the discrediting of the man who scores investment newsletters.
Mark Hulbert, editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, gains a few new enemies each month when he publishes an updated list of who's best -- and who's worst -- among 145 investment advisers who sell newsletters.


Counsel Praises Bankruptcy Creditors
"Anatomy of L.I.'s Major Bankruptcy" fails to provide the overall context that would allow the reader to understand how and why any real estate bankruptcy takes place on Long Island during the recession of 1993.
The Racanelli corporate bankruptcy was not some sudden implosion but a calculated response by the firm to a combination of factors far beyond their control.
These elements include the redrafting of Federal tax laws lowering the value of real estate investments, the ongoing commercial credit crunch, the region's lingering recession and a property tax structure that is crippling commercial and residential property owners alike.


Sky Beauty Is Back, Winning the Alabama
Sky Beauty went back to the races today for the first time since she swept the Triple Tiara five weeks ago and enhanced her stature as the best filly in the land by winning the 113th Alabama Stakes by a length and a half over Future Pretense.
It was the fourth straight victory in a Grade I stakes for the 3-year-old daughter of Blushing Groom, and the ninth time in 10 starts that she came home first.
And it moved her firmly into the front of the class of fillies with a clear shot at the Breeders' Cup Distaff on Nov. 6, and perhaps even a shot at the ultimate honor in thoroughbred racing, the title Horse of the Year.


Airlines Offer Video Games, Faxes Aloft
In recent months some airlines have begun packing their planes with new technology to create flying video arcades and airborne offices.
Recent examples of the rush to retrofit include Japan Airlines offering Sega video games to first-class and business passengers flying between Japan and the United States.
Virgin Atlantic Airways plans to start offering video gambling on board its flights this fall.
And Singapore Airlines is installing fax machines aboard its 747's, which bounce its signals off a satellite to most places in the world.


Grand Central
To the Editor:
Two cheers for Metro North and its grandiose plans for Grand Central Station ("Grand Spaces in Grand Central," July 4).
For years now, there have been no benches at the terminal for the sick, the lame, the aged and the otherwise disabled, except those seats up three flights of stairs.
And it's a long walk from Lexington Avenue to Vanderbilt to get to those lofty seats.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
BEFORE AND AFTER By Rosellen Brown.
Dell, $5.99.
Ben and Carolyn Reiser are a successful couple whose lives fall apart when they learn that their teen-age son may have committed murder.
Each must later choose between familial love and the pursuit of justice.
Last year our reviewer, Michael Dorris, called this a "powerful new novel." He added: "Rosellen Brown is too original and truthful a writer to depend on easy solutions."  THE CIVIL WAR IN THE AMERICAN WEST By Alvin M. Josephy Jr.
Vintage Civil War Library, $15.
A historian illuminates a relatively unexamined theater of the war, showing how both the Union and Confederate armies exploited the Western territories and their Indian inhabitants to further their own ends.
"Only occasionally does one find such a felicitous pairing of author and subject as in this important new book," David Haward Bain said here last year.
Also reissued in a Vintage Civil War Library edition is


Cole Porter's Waspish Words
To the Editor:
Since the issue of Garbo's feet seems to be a subject of endless fascination to both the staff and the readership of the Book Review (Letters, June 20 and July 18), surely what were perhaps the most waspish words ever said about them ought to be displayed once again.
I am referring to the lines from Cole Porter's 1941 song "Let's Not Talk About Love," from "Let's Face It": "If you know Garbo, then tell me this news, / Is it a fact the Navy's launched all her old shoes?"
Of course, in the song the name is pronounced gar-BOH.  JEROME S. SHIPMAN  Potomac, Md.


POSTINGS: Parker Meridien Loses; City Tells Hotel: Restore Chairs
Can a developer who provides a civic amenity in exchange for a zoning bonus unilaterally reduce the public benefit?
"No," came the answer last week from the New York City Environmental Control Board.
Overruling one of its own administrative law judges, the board declared that the Parker Meridien Hotel, 118 West 57th Street, had violated the Zoning Resolution when it removed 40 or 50 chairs from its mid-block atrium.
The order was signed by Albert F. Appleton, Commissioner of the Environmental Protection Department.
He is also chairman of the control board, which enforces quality-of-life laws.


Detectives Say More Information Backs Arrest in Ball-Field Death
Two days after a man was arrested in the death of a young woman hit by a bullet fired from a moving train as she played catch on a ball field in the Bronx, investigators said they had more information to support the account of a witness to the shooting.
The information was supplied by another man, detectives said, who told the police that he had seen the suspect carrying a handgun earlier the day of the shooting.


A la Carte; Some Imaginative and Eclectic Dishes in Rustic Montauk
THE 27 East restaurant is a microcosm of Montauk.
It is an improving, emerging establishment, serving more-imaginative and eclectic dishes than were previously available at restaurants in this rustic fishing port.
It is also a restaurant in flux, midway between a casual local hangout and a serious, sophisticated eating place.
A recent three-course early-bird dinner, one of the best buys in Montauk at $15.95, was a mix of the two.

AUG. 8-14: On to Congress; A Hurdle Is Cleared For Free-Trade Accord, And Its Foes Hiss
The Clinton Administration linked American trade policy to labor and environmental issues as never before last week when it struck three deals with Mexico and Canada, its prospective partners in the still-unratified North American Free Trade Agreement.
The deals are aimed at protecting workers, businesses and the environment from possible side effects of the accord.
For decades, the United States has resisted tying trade to other issues, contending that free trade helps economies most when each country is free to use any competitive advantage it perceives as in its overriding interest, including low-wage labor or a willingness to pollute.
Last week's deals will set up commissions in Ottawa and Washington to assure that all three countries at least enforce their domestic labor and environmental laws.


Balkan Children Meet in Friendship at Camp
In a picnic area at the Palic zoo, four girls huddled over a large square of brown paper, painting in the outlines of trees and deer they had sketched and pausing to joke with their counselors.
Until about a year ago, three of the girls -- a Serb, a Croat and a Muslim -- lived in Sarajevo.
The fourth is a Serb from Pakrac, in northern Croatia.


Australian Given O.K.
CORY READER, a 7-foot, 280-pound center from Brisbane, Australia, will be allowed to play for Brigham Young after all, just not this season.

What's Wrong With Buying Black
To the Editor:
Bernard Kinsey seems worried that his modest proposal might offend some of his readers.
But guess what?
African-Americans are not the only ones with buying power who might support his idea.
There are even a few of us white folks who would gladly patronize black-owned business -- especially if we knew how to find them.
Just as the "Made in the U.S.A." label is a helpful tipoff, we could use an insignia -- "Proudly Owned By an African-American" or "Another African-American Business" -- that could help us make our purchasing decisions.
And it might work.
After all, the American consumer is possibly the most effective tool for economic change we've got.

Jets' Jones Shows Long-Range Ability
Linebacker Marvin Jones, the Jets' first-round draft pick, wandered around the sideline dressed in street clothes, looking completely out of place last weekend during the team's first preseason game.
But on Friday night, Jones spent most of his time roaming from sideline to sideline, chasing Eagles running backs, quarterbacks and receivers for nearly three quarters in the Jets' 24-13 loss to Philadelphia at Giants Stadium.
And he looked right at home doing it.

Streetscapes: The Dakota; The Elusive Mystery of Its Name
THE two-year process of cleaning and restoring the Dakota is nearly over, and when the co-op corporation takes down the sidewalk bridge this fall it will look, as nearly as possible, the way it did when it was completed in 1884 at West 72d Street next to Central Park.
But just how did it look -- not architecturally, but as a piece of the city?


Amy C. Pearlman, Philip J. Capell
Amy C. Pearlman, a daughter of Robert and Sula Pearlman of Rye, N.Y., was married last evening to Philip J. Capell, a son of Howard and Sheila Capell of Dix Hills, L.I.

Smoker's Lament
To the Editor: How fortunate that Eleanor Chard (Letters to Travel, July 18) has found a smoke-free trans-Atlantic carrier so that she won't have to forever forgo the delights of overseas travel.
We smokers aren't so lucky.
We must live without the everyday pleasures of working in a relaxed atmosphere, eating by a window in a restaurant, enjoying a movie or socializing with friends and family in their homes.
We can't even takeg a walk in a park or go to a beach witout being verbally accosted.


Seles Suspect Charged
The man who stabbed MONICA SELES in April has been charged with causing grievous bodily harm, the authorities said on Friday.
Seles, 19, who has been undergoing rehabilitation in Vail, Colo., at the Steadman-Hawkins Clinic, will not be able to defend her United States Open title at the end of August.


Corrections
A report last Sunday about the wedding of Caroline Fraser and Harold Espen omitted part of the bride's educational background.
She has a doctorate in English literature from Harvard.


Eve Stafford, Raymond Rathle
Mrs.
Frederick M. Stafford of New York has announced the engagement of her daughter, Eve Alexandra Stafford, to Raymond Michel Rathle Jr., the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Rathle of New Orleans.
An October wedding is planned.
Miss Stafford, a graduate of Smith College, is a television and video producer in New York.
She is also a daughter of the late Mr.
Stafford.


GROS MAC ATTACK
Mordecai Richler's On Language column "Gros Mac Attack" (July 18) was entertaining.
It hardly strikes me as unusal for there to be some residual linguistic tension in Quebec, when you consider that the British and French argued and fought for the better part of two centuries in the colonies.


Fred and Ginger: The Sophisticates
To the Editor:
I was astonished by John Mueller's review of my book "Noel and Cole: The Sophisticates" (June 6).
More than that, I was mystified at the unsupported reference to my "careless" way with facts, as Mr.
Mueller put it, especially his mention of "at least six errors in the two and a half pages" devoted to the musical play "The Gay Divorce" and the film version of it.


No Headline
In a culture which holds that no universally valid truths are possible, nothing is absolute.
Therefore, in the end -- they say -- objective goodness and evil no longer really matter.
Good comes to mean what is pleasing or useful at a particular moment.
POPE JOHN PAUL II. [ 24:1. ]


Wellsboro, Pa.
To The Editor: Ann Crittenden's article "An Eastern Canyon" (June 27) recalled many delightful weekend trips that my husband and I have made to Wellsboro, Pa.
Although health problems preclude us from taking part in the many outdoor activities the area offers, we try to visit once or twice a year.


Corrections
A listing on July 25 with an article about Scottish country wines referred incorrectly to Brookes Wine Bar in Inverness.
It is out of business and has been replaced by Pierre Victoire.

Fairfield Orchestra At Levitt In Westport
SUMMERS are usually orchestral times off in Connecticut, but the Fairfield, New Haven and Waterbury Symphonies are all in performing action next weekend.
Off to an early start Thursday, with an 8:30 P.M. concert at the Levitt Pavilion in Westport, is the Fairfield Orchestra, with its founding director, Thomas Crawford, leading "Summer" from Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, Grieg's Holberg Suite and Bach's Second Brandenburg Concerto.
The featured soloists are Cenovia Cummins, Douglas Myers, Marcia Butler and Adrianne Greenbaum, respectively, playing violin, trumpet, oboe and flute.


Volvo Tennis Tournament Returns
WHEN the Volvo International tennis tournament moved from Stratton Mountain, Vt., to New Haven three years ago, the consensus among business and civic leaders was that it would give a big boost to a city scarred by a soaring homicide rate, high unemployment and other problems.
Matthew Nemerson, the president of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce, was one of many who predicted that the tournament would generate substantial revenues and tourist development for the city.

Seat-Belt Laws Grow, But by Fits and Starts
Gov.
Howard Dean of Vermont carries out his official duties in a blue Lincoln Town Car, and, unlike most other Vermonters, he and his driver always buckle their seat belts.
But others will soon learn the habit, because after a decade of legislative skirmishing, Vermont has broken a New England tradition.
As of Jan. 1, motorists must wear safety belts.

NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Wilmington, Del.; Condo Project Back on Track
A LOCAL developer that has built several successful commercial projects, including downtown office high rises and suburban office parks, has breathed new life into an eight-year-old condominium project here on the Brandywine River that has been slow to sell.

In America; Violence And the Young
Last summer the "Munecas," an all-girl Little League softball team in Camden, N.J., won a championship behind a power-hitting 11-year-old named Samalica Ortiz.
This year the "Munecas," which means "Little Dolls," made it to the finals but lost the championship game, 14-13.
Samalica was not there.
Last Nov. 22 she was shot to death at a friend's birthday party.


Macabre Vs. Awesome
To the Editor:
Why is it that Cara Greenberg considers the human skeleton outside the new store Evolution (Foraging, July 18) "macabre" but feels the animal skeletons displayed within "evoke nothing but awe"?
Were she a gazelle, she would probably shudder at all those "stripped down" animals, too.


Years After Bias Ruling, Yonkers Still a House Divided
MARY MUNSON is weary from the din in the streets, the filth in the elevators and the ever-present threat of drugs and violence that stalks her son and daughter as they travel to and from school.
After 10 years of living in this rundown west side neighborhood, Ms.
Munson -- who is black and raising her children alone -- said she hopes the next phase of a court-ordered housing desegregation plan will mean an opportunity to finally better her family's circumstances.
Ms.
Munson, locking the steel gate behind her in the courtyard of the federally subsidized apartment building for people of low and moderate income where she lives, escorted a visitor to her apartment, to meet Ha-Saun and Tamara, her 15-year-old twins.
Once inside, Ms.
Munson, who is an executive assistant for Barnes and Noble Bookstores in Manhattan, talked about how the mostly black and Hispanic areas of this city have deteriorated over the years, how her children rarely go outside anymore and about how much she wants to move to a neighborhood where there are lawns, shade trees and safe places to ride a bike.

Her mother, Lorie Kemp, is a counselor in the Hartford public schools.


Computer Screen As Bedtime Story
To the Editor:
I enjoyed your article on screen savers ("Silly Screens," July 18), although I think that you are overlooking a major reason why that market is booming.
The mystery over the growing purchases of screen savers by the home-computer user can be very easily explained if one focuses not on the problem of screen burn-in, but of FTPI (Fatal Toddler-Program Interface).


NOTES
Montel Williams, the syndicated talk show host with the shaved head, is starting his own clothing line.
He just signed a deal with the St.
Remo clothing company to design and produce men's shirts with his name on them.
Asked to describe his own style, he said: "I just dare to be a little different. I might put an epaulet on something that someone else wouldn't put it on."


A Little Gun Control, a Lot of Guns
IT was 1981 when a young man with a handgun shot President Reagan and his press secretary, James S. Brady, prompting what would become a new wave of gun-control activism led by the permanently maimed Mr.
Brady and his tirelessly campaigning wife, Sarah.
In the dozen years since that day, Americans have bought nearly 50 million new guns, including more than 20 million handguns.
Altogether, Federal officials estimate, Americans may own 200 million firearms.
Last week, as promised, President Clinton declared his support for the measure that gun-control advocates have sought most avidly: the Brady bill, which would require background checks on handgun purchasers in every state, in most cases with a waiting period of five business days.
Such checks aim to detect felons, people who have been committed for mental illness, out-of-state residents and others who are legally prohibited from buying a gun.

Tax Package Punishes Retired Couples
To the Editor:
Newspeak still reigns in Washington.
President Clinton said in his Aug. 3 budget address: "For working families making less than $180,000 a year there will be no income tax increase. I repeat, for working families making less than $180,000 a year there will be no income tax increase" (transcript, Aug. 4).


They Fell in Love While Wrestling
To the Editor:
The concern of the individual with mortality is indeed the main theme of "Gilgamesh," but I was surprised to see Karin Brothers's emphatic denial of any sexuality at all in the story (Letters, July 18).
To the contrary, it reeks with sexuality.


Law Protects Mexico's Workers But Its Enforcement Is Often Lax
"There's no way I can get my labor costs down to $1 an hour," groused an American executive pictured in a magazine advertisement promoting the state of Yucatan this year.
Below his photograph the Yucatan government promised low wages and workers willing to accept them.
"When the U.S. is too expensive and the Far East too far," the advertisement said, "yes you can, in Yucatan."


N.J. Bell's Cable Plan Hits Snag
WHEN New Jersey Bell unveiled plans to replace its 56.3 million miles of copper telephone wire with fiber optic cable made of hair-thin strands of glass, it promised to create a network of high-speed audio, video and data services that would revolutionize the way people communicate.
In a "fully fibered state," company officials say, doctors could read CAT scans taken in hospitals miles away, businesses could market products over interactive two-way video, and television viewers could select virtually any cable television program in the state.

Corrections
Because of an editing error, an essay on page 3 of The Times Book Review today about Henry Roth, in a mention of first novels that have yet to be followed by second novels, misstates the title of Ralph Ellison's first novel.

Giants Find Two Potential 20-Game Winners Better Than One
Talk about cautious conservatism.
Dick Pole, the San Francisco Giants' pitching coach, supervises the two most successful pitchers in the National League, but he won't acknowledge, publicly at least, that they are on the verge of gaining a distinction rare in the National League in recent years.


With All Plants Drooping, What to Do?
UNTIL steady rainfall comes to assuage the dry ground and fill the reservoirs once again, gardeners will have to remain watchful during the Northeast drought.
Many homeowners have been saddened.
Instead of velvety greenswards, suburban lawns are for the most part crunchy strawlike mats.
Huge shade trees are dropping their leaves to reduce the number that have to be supported by a lengthy root system.
Rhododendron leaves are hanging; some are dead.
Even the pachysandra, a stalwart groundcover, is wilting.
Woodlands are dangerously dry.


'Operettas At Their Best'
To the Editor:
Allan Kozinn's view of City Opera at 50 may be unduly pessimistic  [ "City Opera Turns 50, but Who's Counting?" July 25 ] .
Unbalanced budgets are a problem for all nonprofit cultural organizations today.
In my opinion, over the last several years, City Opera has substantially raised the level of its performances despite budget deficits.


Hudson Mansion
To the Editor: On a Hudson Valley Heritage expedition sponsored by Mohonk Mountain House, my husband and I visited Margaret Suckley at Wilderstein, a year before she died at 99. , William Weaver describes the very qualities we felt distinguished Wilderstein from other mansions open to the public.
Mr.
Weaver describes a first impression of "a Dickensian illustration of decay." '
There is a feeling of stopped time as in "Great Expectations" but Ms.
Suckley was no Miss Haversham.
She received us, a few at a time, in the windowed gallery on the side of the house with cordiality, responding to comments and questions she must have heard repeatedly as if it were the first time she had heard them.


Counsel Praises Bankruptcy Creditors
I am writing in response to "Anatomy of Long Island's Major Bankruptcy"  [ Long Island Weekly, July 23 ] .
As lead bankruptcy counsel to N. Racanelli Associates, I was pleased with the accurate portrayal of one of the most visible bankruptcy cases in the Eastern District of New York.
I commend your writer for her diligent effort in tracing the genesis of the Racanelli bankruptcy and for her sensitivity in dealing with the many issues and people affected by the case.
One aspect of the story which should be especially highlighted is the response from all the creditors who were involved in this case.
Throughout the legal process, I found the trade creditors to be particularly, and unusually, understanding and positive toward the Racanelli bankruptcy.
It is absolutely true that Racanelli and other major developers on Long Island have become casualties of the credit crunch and depressed real estate market.
It is heartening to see the Long Island businesses pull together during tough times, all the while maintaining an overall positive outlook.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Universities as Landlords; When the Landlord Is a University
RUTGERS UNIVERSITY has some 335 surplus acres fully permitted for development and zoned for light industrial use near its campus in New Brunswick, N.J.
But as hungry as it is for a developer, particularly in this down market, Rutgers won't even talk to people who want to put up manufacturing facilities.
"We see developing our surplus land as building our own neighborhood, and manufacturing is not what we have in mind," said Mark Rozewski, the university's director of physical and capital planning.


Baldwin to Graduate
Former University of Nebraska I-back SCOTT BALDWIN , confined to a wheelchair since being shot by Omaha police after going on a rampage last September, was scheduled to graduate yesterday from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.


Bushwick's Hope Is a Public Project
In their darkest days, the blocks around St.
Barbara's Roman Catholic Church in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn absorbed misfortunes of nearly biblical dimensions.
In the mid- to late 1970's, fires coursed through the streets with such regularity that to enable fast evacuation, mothers often dressed their children for bed in street clothes.
In the name of urban renewal, the city tore down blocks and blocks of homes, but never built the promised replacements.
Packs of wild dogs were often the only signs of life on these streets, the pounding of scavengers pulling copper wire and aluminum fixtures from burned-out buildings the only sound.


Shame on Him
To the Sports Editor:
Suckered once again by a New York baseball team owner!
I still hadn't recovered from the O'Malley greed when I was tricked by the Steinbrenner greed.
Greedy George kept whining that the Yankees weren't drawing crowds because of the location of Yankee Stadium.
I invested an afternoon, traveling more than two hours to get to the Stadium with the assumption that an afternoon weekday game would be a fun day.
Not so.
The game was sold out and the scalpers were selling tickets for $50 each.


Subway Train Kills Man
A 71-year-old man walking in a subway tunnel was struck and killed yesterday by a northbound No. 2 express train near the Times Square station, the transit police said.
Sgt.
Luis Medina, a transit police spokesman, said the man had apparently walked 150 feet south from the station along a ledge into the tunnel, then jumped or fell to the tracks as the train approached.
The man, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was identified from a New Jersey driver's license he was carrying, the sergeant said, but his name was withheld pending notification of relatives.
The incident, about 3:10 P.M., disrupted service on the northbound No. 2 line for about an hour.

Her mother, Gail Whelpley, is a legal secretary for Transport Systems in Bernardsville, N.J.


Viewpoints; A Brief History of Coca-Colonization
IT'S May 1991 at the headquarters of the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta.
A top executive and a visitor are talking when they're interrupted by word that Rajiv Gandhi, former Prime Minister of India, has just been assassinated.
They join another executive watching CNN nearby.
"Well," mutters the other executive. "That's not too good for us."


Israelis Say U.S. Opposes North Korean Deal
Israeli officials said that the United States was opposed to an Israeli plan to invest in North Korea as a way to prevent the North Koreans from supplying upgraded long-range missiles to Iran.
"The American position is certainly one of dissatisfaction and reservations regarding the contacts with North Korea," said Eytan Bentsur, senior deputy director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
"But this is coupled with the recognition that the supply of Rodong missiles to Iran presents a most serious danger." He said he learned of the American position in the last week.


Stardust Reveries
"IT would have been a nice night for bicycling," George Plimpton was saying last Tuesday, having cabbed downtown from his Upper East Side home.
After giving a reading at Cafe Limbo on Avenue A, he was having dinner at a nearby Mexican restaurant with a dozen serious young writers and Paris Review staff members.
"I don't know why more people don't do it. You go sweeping by everything, get exercise and see lots of friends. I could have biked down here in 20 minutes," Mr.
Plimpton said, ordering a double Scotch.

Spring Hill Journal; Rural Town Ages Rapidly Under Saturn's Influence
For its first 176 years, Spring Hill was known for -- well, as Charlie Brown, the buildings superintendent, says, for "nothing."
Then, in 1985, the Saturn Corporation, a new unit of General Motors, announced that it would build a plant at the south end of town to produce spiffy new cars in a newfangled way, and suddenly Spring Hill became a dot on the map.
A good map.

What's Wrong With Buying Black
To the Editor:
Regarding "Nothing Else Has Worked. Buy Black" (Viewpoints, Aug. 1): Bernard Kinsey, although obviously well intentioned, misses the mark.
To presume that the myriad problems that plague blacks in America's inner cities can be eradicated by the ringing of cash registers is, at best, a gross over-simplification.


Corrections
An article last Sunday about easing access to birth control pills referred incorrectly to the plans of a pharmaceutical manufacturer, Schering-Plough Healthcare Products.
The company does not make oral contraceptives and says it has no plans to apply for Food and Drug Administration permission to sell them without prescription.


ONE-WEEK STAND
Frank Rich's interpretation of "The Bridges of Madison County" is that of a typical, old-fashioned male -- the guy scored (Endpaper/Public Stages: "One-Week Stand," July 25).
The appeal of Robert James Waller's book is that the couple connected as soul mates -- something very rare today.
People cry at the end because they relate it to their own losses and lack of connection, love and intimacy.

Kathryn E. Dolan, Kevin J. Wall
Kathryn Ellen Dolan, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Bach and Big Brass Band Cap Caramoor Festival
AT Caramoor, the musical stars are still shining as the 48th Festival summer draws to a close.
Today at 5:30 P.M., members of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center -- the clarinetist (and artistic director) David Shifrin, the violinist Ani Kavafian, the cellist Gary Hoffman and the pianist David Golub -- disport themselves in trios of Brahms and Beethoven, plus Mendelssohn's D major Sonata for Cello and Piano.
Ushering in the final weekend is a solo recital by the guitarist Manuel Barrueco, making his Caramoor debut with a program on Friday at 8:30 P.M. in the Spanish Courtyard listing works of Weiss, Sor, Rodrigo, Albeniz and Lou Harrison, whose "Air, Sonata in Ishartum, Serenado por Gitaro and Round" sounds like a strong contender for most intriguing title of the year.


Focus: Philadelphia; Filling Downtown's Bank-Financing Gap
SEVERAL older office towers financed by GECapital Services have undergone significant renovations in this city's downtown, where one estimate puts the Class B vacancy rate at 37 percent, even as competing buildings are mothballed or auctioned.
GE Capital's moves are evidence of the change in real estate financing to more long-term investors -- primarily finance companies and real estate investment trusts that can tolerate greater risk and wait longer for their returns.


Deadlines for the Dilatory
Some 104 million Americans filed Federal income tax returns by April 15 this year, like they're supposed to.
Another 5.5 million filed Form 4868, giving themselves four more months to get their act together.
For them, the moment is now at hand.
Unless they want more time.
In which case, there's Form 2688.
It used to be that a deadline was a deadline.
File a return by March 15, or else; extensions were the exception and needed written approval in advance.
Then in the 1950's Washington wisdom moved March 15 to April 15, shattering one of life's absolutes in a single stroke.

The Clinton Arkansans And the Penalty of Power
FOR the close-knit group who traveled from Arkansas to work in Bill Clinton's White House, the coveted link to the power of the Presidency has often come disturbingly close to feeling like a trap.
The kinship among the Arkansans who worked for Mr.
Clinton could not help them answer why their old friend and colleague Vincent W. Foster Jr. killed himself, leaving a cryptic and wrenching note saying that in Washington, "ruining people is considered sport."


Rail Pass For Baltics
Travelers to Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania can now use the Baltic Rail Card, a pass good for unlimited train travel throughout the three Baltic republics.
The passes are available for 8 and 15 days; the prices in early August were $50 and $100, respectively, plus a $15 handling fee for each card if bought in the United States.
The American companies that sell the passes said the prices might fluctuate slightly.
The passes, which were introduced last month, may be obtained from Eurocruises and Uniontours, both based in New York.
They are also available at approximately the same prices at railway offices in Finland, Norway and Sweden.
In addition to providing unlimited train travel, the passes are good for free reserved sleeping accommodations and discounts on some Baltic ferries and on connecting routes to the Baltic republics from Sweden, Norway, Finland, eastern portions of Germany and parts of Poland.


The True Story of M. Butterfly; The Spy Who Fell in Love With a Shadow
There is a little alarm that goes off in us, a small inner voice that senses danger.
And on Thursday, June 30, 1983, on a busy commercial street in Paris, Bernard Boursicot -- an attache in the French Foreign Service who has always dreamed of being a man of distinction -- is hearing that alarm in his head.
It is odd.
Usually Boursicot returns to Paris after being posted abroad the way a hungry man sits down at the table.
Old friends, good food, all-night bars, the possibility of a brief and amusing love affair -- he approaches it all with cheerful greed.
But this morning, walking down Avenue Bosquet on the Left Bank, all Boursicot feels is the tension.


Anne Montesano, Dan Scheibe
Anne Hale Montesano, a daughter of Lane and Diane Montesano of Buffalo, was married there yesterday to Robert Daniel Scheibe, a son of Dr.

The Rev.

Ms.
Montesano, 25, is keeping her name.
She and her husband teach English at Blair Academy, a preparatory school in Blairstown, N.Y., where Mr.
Scheibe is also the dean of international students.
The bride graduated from Hamilton College.
Her father is the founder of Wolf Views, a poster design company in Buffalo.


Towns Resist State's 'Big Daddy' Role
FRANK B. CONNOLLY said he got very nervous when the General Assembly was in session.
"We don't know what they're going to do there." Those legislators, said John Weichsel, "can say anything and do anything. They have a super home-court advantage." And Lorette Russell warned that if the legislators did not start listening to the folks back home, an amendment to the State Constitution might bring them to their senses.
All three are chief executive officers of Connecticut towns, Mr.
Connolly as town manager of North Branford, Mr.
Weichsel as town manager of Southington and Ms.
Russell as First Selectwoman of Suffield.


Filling Philadelphia's Bank-Financing Gap
Several older office towers financed by GE Capital Services have undergone significant renovations in this city's downtown, where one estimate puts the Class B vacancy rate at 37 percent, even as competing buildings are mothballed or auctioned.
GE Capital's moves are evidence of the change in real estate financing to more long-term investors -- primarily finance companies and real estate investment trusts that can tolerate greater risk and wait longer for their returns.
In 1990, GE Capital took back two 1920's medical office buildings with more than 200,000 square feet of Class B space from Allan Pullman, who defaulted on $35 million in loans.
The buildings were sold to GMH Associates of Wayne, Pa., for $24 million and then renovated at a cost of $5.5 million.
GE took the mortgage for both the building and the renovation costs.


Egyptian Court Clears 24 Fundamentalists of Murder
An Egyptian civilian court today cleared 24 Muslim fundamentalists of murder charges in the assassination of the Speaker of Egypt's Parliament in 1990, citing evidence that some confessions in the slaying had been extracted under physical abuse.
Prosecutors had demanded death sentences in the slaying of Rifaat al-Mahjoub, a decision that is bound to aggravate the enmity between supporters of secular government and their fundamentalist opponents in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world.


The Water Rule: An Inch a Week
Keep giving the garden and lawn an inch of water a week, if you are short on rain.
It's too late to prune or fertilize trees and shrubs, because doing either activates new growth, which might not become hardy enough to survive the winter.


Keeping Downtown Hartford Alive
ON any given day, Michael J. Kerski is likely to be found at the offices of the Greater Hartford Architecture Conservancy, of which he is executive director, or at the downtown farmers market, which the conservancy runs, or at the Hartford Civic Center, where the conservancy operates a gallery for Russian crafts, or on downtown streets talking to members of the Hartford Guides, of which he is a founder.
Even when at home in a city condominium development he can't escape.
He is head of the condo association.


New Jersey Q &amp; A: The Rev. Jean Smith; Helping the Troubled at the Waterfront
ON the waterfront here, the gritty mini-city that is a port of call for more than 5,000 ships a year, seafarers from all over the world mingle -- sometimes in confusion or despair.
The Seamen's Church Institute's center on the pier offers them respite.
"In a world of danger on the high seas, a world which can be fearful and lonely," said the Rev.
Jean Smith, 50, the Episcopal minister in charge of the center, "we try to provide the mariners with a safe harbor."

Iowa Area Floods While the Corps Takes a Break
After four weeks of maintaining 24-hour flood-watch shifts at its regional headquarters in Rock Island, Ill., the Army Corps of Engineers thought it could take a break.
It was wrong, say residents along the Iowa River here.
They found their homes and businesses inundated on Tuesday after frantic calls to the corps went unanswered.
Heavy rain overnight on Monday raised the river two and a half feet, flooding 14 neighborhoods and several University of Iowa buildings here and 150 businesses and 160 houses or apartment units across the river in Coralville.


When Banks Make Currency Go Up and Down; No Boon to U.S.
To the Editor:
Re "Money Woes in Europe May Aid U.S." (Business Day, Aug. 5): Some North American economists interpret the European currency crisis as having a positive effect for the United States.
They argue that other European states have finally followed Britain's decision of 1992 and distanced themselves from the problems of a dominant, ailing Germany.

During two of the last four years, Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor, was able to qualify the smaller of her two estates as farmland to reduce her taxes by selling cords of firewood to several relatives and friends, according to public records made available by the campaign of Gov.
Jim Florio.
In a continuing effort to turn Mrs.
Whitman's wealth in general and her farms in particular into a damaging political issue, the Florio campaign has distributed copies of Mrs.
Whitman's applications for the state's farmland-assessment program for 1988 through 1991.

She is an assistant editor at Red Car-New York, a postproduction company for television commercials.
Her father is a director of sales for the Dataproducts Corporation, a computer- printer manufacturer in Washington.
Her mother, Mary Jane Woodward, is the administrator of Cardiac Consultants, a cardiology practice in Bethesda, Md.
Mr.
O'Neill, 26, a graduate of the University of Virginia, is an associate in New York at SPP Hambro &amp; Company, an investment bank.
His father is a senior vice president in Jericho, L.I., of the National Westminster Bank.


CONNECTICUT GUIDE
STORY IN SONG
An unusual two-character musical called "John and Jen" is onstage at the Norma Terris Theater in Chester through Aug. 29.
The music is by Andrew Lippa, lyrics by Tom Greenwald, and the book, which is minimal, is by both men.
The story is moved along almost entirely in song, beginning in 1952 when John is an infant and his 7-year-old sister Jen sings to him in the opening scene.
Accompanied by a five-piece instrumental ensemble, the brother and sister play out 40 years of their lives, passing through a dramatic event at the end of Act One, which the producers do not want to reveal in advance, and progressing through the birth of Jen's son, whom she names John.
The influence of the brother on the sister and the son, through comic and tragic periods of their lives, are the heart of the story.


King Edward I's Palace Opened
A palace at the Tower of London that was the home of King Edward I of England in the late 13th century has been opened to visitors for the first time.
The palace, situated above the Traitor's Gate, overlooking the Thames, has been restored by the Historic Royal Palaces Agency.
The palace is the only surviving medieval one in Britain and, in working on it, the agency tried to re-create the atmosphere of the King's household in the 1280's, when the court was the center of government.
Visitors can consult guides dressed in period costumes.


Berlin to Gdansk: Two Days, $123
THIS summer I found out what many East Germans discovered right after the Berlin wall came down: bus trips are an inexpensive and efficient way to see Europe.
On a recent trip from Berlin to Gdansk, those sights included vast yellow fields of rape flowers covering the Polish countryside like a blanket, and tiny villages with their new-car dealerships and Coca-Cola signs.
Perhaps more important, the bus also offered a camaraderie that quickly led to discussions that went well beyond polite chitchat.
Bus trips, I discovered, throw passengers together in a camping spirit that just doesn't happen on planes or trains.


Kahane Suspect Remains Focal Point in Bomb Plots
Only days after the World Trade Center bombing last February, law-enforcement officials began referring to El Sayyid A. Nosair, a militant Muslim imprisoned in connection with the killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane, as "the hub" of the wheel of suspected bombers, a "central figure" in the terrorist plot, or a rallying point for the men arrested in the case.
Now, nearly six months and another bomb plot later, Mr.
Nosair still has not been charged either in the World Trade Center case or in what authorities say was a second plan, to bomb the United Nations and other sites.
But he has remained a focal point for investigators, despite their concession that they are still laboring over how or if they can bring him into a larger conspiracy case.

She teaches first grade at the Southfield School, a private elementary school in Brookline, Mass.
Her father teaches English at the Belmont Hill School, a private high school in Belmont.


The Land of Endless War
THE FATE OF AFRICA Trial by Fire.
By Jeremy Harding.  368 pp.
New York:  Simon &amp; Schuster. $25.


Don't Dodge Issue
To the Sports Editor:
For years, we have observed the unending vilification of the so-called greedy Dodgers and diabolical O'Malleys, who moved their team to California.
George Vecsey now finds himself cursing the late Walter O'Malley 36 years later, blaming him for potholes and graffiti, and for suing the Brooklyn Dodger bar.
O'Malley was just a little ahead of his time.
As to the Brooklyn Dodger lawsuit, it's not a sports issue but a legal trademark issue.


Fanciful Dreams of Africa's Past and Future
The fantasy works of today's African artists often bear no resemblance to those of their ancestors.
The dreams of the past are expressed in the miniature clay huts by one contemporary Ivory Coast artist; those of the future in the colorful cardboard skyscrapers by a sculptor in Zaire.
And these architectural objects are as dynamic as the human images that characterize so much of traditional African art.
"I'm not sure people in Africa would recognize these objects as art," says Susan Vogel, executive director of the Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, where the works are exhibited in "Home and the World: Architectural Sculpture by Aboudramane and Bodys Isek Kingelez," through Sept. 26.
"They are not traditional figures or masks. And since these artists work with their hands, they might be viewed as manual laborers."


Giant Force Sets Record In Winning International
Giant Force, cashing in on the home-track advantage, lived up to his name tonight by winning the $500,000 International Trot at Yonkers Raceway in record-setting fashion.
Driven by John Patterson, Jr.
Giant Force, one of two American horses entered in the eight-horse field, used a burst of speed down the stretch to catch Meadow Prophet on the outside.
And just yards before the wire, he dashed past the Swedish champion.


Tap, Tap, Tap That Old Selectric
To the Editor:
Peter H. Lewis offers several good reasons why people still use typewriters ("An Impressive Line From Lexmark Breaks Old Ground," The Executive Computer, Aug. 1).
I can offer several more: A typewriter is energy efficient; in order to produce the same document a typewriter can, a computer also needs a monitor and a printer.
A typewriter is more portable than a typical PC and printer (laptops excluded).
It requires no memorizing of passwords and complex software commands, or reading 500-page user manuals.
It can accomplish, at far lower cost, what many PC users do exclusively: simple letter writing and word processing.


Ian Lustbader, Dana Bernstein
Dr.
Dana Robin Bernstein, a daughter of Prof. and Mrs.
Theodore Bernstein of Madison, Wis., was married yesterday evening to Dr.
Ian Jay Lustbader, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Irving Lustbader of New York.
Rabbi Eric Polokoff officiated at the St.
Moritz in New York.
Dr.
Dana Lustbader, 30, is a fellow in critical care at St.
Vincent's Hospital in New York.
She graduated from the University of Wisconsin, from which she also received a medical degree.
Her father, a professor emeritus of electrical and computer engineering at the university, is a consulting engineer based in Madison.


Setting Sail, But Not Too Far
Under a tent decorated like a cruise ship, guests dined and danced at Southampton's largest summer benefit, Aug 7.


With All Plants Drooping, What to Do?
UNTIL steady rainfall comes to assuage the dry ground and fill the reservoirs once again, gardeners will have to remain watchful during the Northeast drought.
Many homeowners have been saddened.
Instead of velvety greenswards, suburban lawns are for the most part crunchy strawlike mats.
Huge shade trees are dropping their leaves to reduce the number that have to be supported by a lengthy root system.
Rhododendron leaves are hanging; some are dead.
Even the pachysandra, a stalwart groundcover, is wilting.
Woodlands are dangerously dry.


Church Mirrors Neighborhood's Hope
When Bushwick came into its own a century ago as a brawny Brooklyn neighborhood of factories, breweries and blue-collar bustle, the construction of St.
Barbara's Church served as a metaphor for its ascendance.
And when Bushwick was virtually consumed in the worst urban deterioration of the 70's, St.
Barbara's once more stood as a metaphor, with its school closing, attendance at Mass falling by half, $800,000 in reserves exhausted, and, for the first time in its history, its doors locked at night to protect against theft and vandalism.


Morality Debates Don't Rain Out the Pope's Woodstock
FOR the national media, Pope John Paul II's visit to the United States has been a story with two themes: disagreement within the Catholic Church over questions of sexuality and gender and discord between the pontiff and the American President over abortion.
Something entirely different, and not easy to explain, has been the story in the streets of Denver, however, where 150,000 people have gathered from more than 70 nations to join with the Pope in the fifth annual World Youth Day.


Aid in Sicily
To the Editor: The international press is quick to report incidents in Italy ranging from petty street crimes to major scandals.
Less frequently told are the many positive experiences of tourists.
One such incident occurred in Sciacca, Sicily, recently when I thought my wallet had been stolen at the San Michele Saturday market.
While shopping, I noticed my wallet missing from a shoulder bag.
The wallet contained credit cards, identification and $500 in currency.
I asked a truck driver where to find the nearest police station.
He offered to lead me to the station and helped me to report the incident.


It's 1986 Again for Norman, Or Is It?
On a pyrotechnical afternoon full of spectacular shots from impossible places, Greg Norman took a narrow lead over a horde of great names today going into the final round of what could become a PGA Championship for the ages.
Drawing on the kind of play and positive outlook he used to win the British Open three weeks ago, the 38-year-old Australian shot a four-under-par 67 at the Inverness Club for a 54-hole total of 10-under-par 203.


Overpraised Children Can Find They Have Problems Fitting In
To the Editor:
"Down From the Self-Esteem High" (The Week in Review, Aug. 1) and "Reading, Writing, Narcissism" by Lillian G. Katz (Op-Ed, July 15) elicited strong agreement from me, as I teach in a metropolitan area high school.
Professor Katz notes that "children are not fooled all of the time" by undeserved praise meant to bolster their self-esteem.
During the course of last year, my sophomore classes and I had occasion to discuss the problems caused when children are routinely told that everything they do is "the greatest." Playing devil's advocate, I asked: "So what's wrong with that? Don't you like being applauded?"


Little Yellow School Bus
To the Editor:
President Clinton is allowing his biggest foreign policy opportunity to slip by -- lifting the embargo against Cuba.
The United States public is ready for re-established relations with Cuba.
President Clinton can be sure history will be as kind to him as it was to President Richard Nixon for opening relations with China.


Another Reason For Covering Up
To the Editor:
The writer of the letter that appeared under the heading "Beach Fears? So Stay Home!" did not recognize the value of the clothing known as Frogwear, described in the Dressing Room column (Aug. 1).


Jenny B. Jones, Roger Mack Jr.
Jenny Beth Jones, a portfolio manager, was married yesterday to Roger Derver Mack Jr., a mutual-fund sales representative, both in New York.
The Rev.
Kent Organ officiated at the Fairmount Presbyterian Church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
Ms.
Jones, 35, is keeping her name.
She is a vice president of the Oppenheimer Capital Corporation, a money-management company.
She graduated from Yale University and received an M.B.A. from New York University.
The bride is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Theodore W. Jones of Lyndhurst, Ohio.


Winners as Well as Losers in the Great Flood of '93
THE losses from the flooding in the upper Midwest this summer continue to grow.
So, in other cases, do the profits.
On the negative side, there has been damage estimated at $12 billion.
Experts say the economic toll could continue to mount for weeks to come, even as the Mississippi River and its swollen tributaries slowly subside.
Barge traffic is not expected to resume on much of the river system before the end of the month, even under the best of circumstances.
Railroads may need several months to return to their finely tuned schedules.
Truckers will be slowed by road and bridge repairs.


Bayonne, Rail Service And the Aldene Plan
A letter to the editor by Robert J. Burrows of Bayonne on July 18 states that Bayonne "reluctantly acceded to the Federal Government directive known as the Aldene Plan" and that "rail service was discontinued in order to benefit the expansion of Port Newark and Port Elizabeth."
Actually, the Aldene Plan was a state plan -- one of five points made by the New Jersey Highway Commissioner, Dwight Palmer, in 1960 when he was charged by Gov.
Robert Meyner to prepare a plan to save rail commutation in New Jersey.


A New Variation, Thanks to Computers
PAIRS events scored by imps used to be ruled out, except on a small scale, by the enormous number of calculations involved.
Since computers became the normal way to score bridge events, imp pairs have been standard fare.
They are popular with many players because the strategies involved resemble those needed for rubber bridge or team play.
The artificialities of the standard duplicate game, requiring players to jeopardize the contract occasionally by straining for an extra trick, and to worry about what is happening at other tables, disappear.


Parisian Bistro Style From Another Time
ENTERING the cozy new Figaro in Greenwich is like stepping back into la belle epoque.
Le Figaro has mastered the period perfectly, with Art Nouveau flourishes in the woodwork, Tiffany-like tulip sconces, rose-decorated ceiling-light covers, mirrors, brass racks, lace cafe curtains and the bronze Moreaux sculpture holding center stage in the main dining room.
Even most of the staff members are French.
This kind of recreation of an epoch has to be carefully done to avoid a theme-park atmosphere.
At Figaro every detail is perfect, even to the framed Figaro magazine covers on the walls.


NEWS ABOUT THE MAGAZINE
Interactive: It's the buzzword of the moment, describing electronic devices by which people can respond to their television and computer screens.
For half a century, New York Times readers have interacted the old-fashioned way, in writing.
Every day, the crossword puzzle turns Times readers into Times writers.
Every day, one on one, thousands engage the puzzle editor who, sometimes devilish and sometimes pedantic, becomes a friend.
A few days ago, we lost such a friend.
Eugene T. Maleska, our puzzle editor since 1977, died in Daytona Beach, Fla., at the age of 77.
His death followed by only three months that of Will Weng, his predecessor and fellow cigar lover, at the age of 86.
Will served as puzzle editor from 1969 till 1977, succeeding Margaret Farrar, who started the Times Sunday crossword in 1942.


Beverly Sills Was Right
To the Editor:
In his article on City Opera, Allan Kozinn stated that I said the artistic quality of the company in the early 1980's was "appalling." I would never have assumed the position of chairman of the board in 1981 had I felt that way.
Rather, I believed that Beverly Sills was improving artistic quality dramatically compared with the previous years.
To be sure, the board of directors decided to raise standards even more under Christopher Keene when he became general director in 1988.

A Crude 1,000-Yard Tunnel Is Sarajevo's Secret Lifeline
Day by day, for the past 500 days or so, Sarajevo's 380,000 people have grown a little hungrier.
The food and emergency supplies that have rolled through and flown over the siege lines have never amounted to more than a fraction of the people's needs, and it has been a mystery how, months after the capital was expected to fall, it survives.


Corrections
Because of an editing error, a report in the Northeast Notebook column on Aug. 1 about a development in Wilmington, Del., referred to the city incorrectly.
It is not the state capital; Dover is.
The report also carried an incorrect byline.
It was by Maureen Milford.


David R. Rivera, Sharon L. Werning
Sharon Louise Werning, a daughter of Elizabeth Werning of Modesto, Calif., and Theodore W. Werning of Sonora, Calif., was married yesterday to David Ralph Rivera, the son of Mary Rivera of Malba, Queens, and Ralph Rivera of the Bronx.
The Rev.

Her father, now retired, was an orthopedic surgeon in Sonora.


Mysteries of One Kind or Another
AT the Jersey City Museum here are exhibitions by Mac Adams, Robin Kahn and Teresa Bramlette, all of them seeming like playlets about mysteries of one kind or another.
In Mr.
Adams's photographs, titled "20 Years of Virtual Crime" -- he could have called it "visual" crime -- the mystery ranges from the whodunit to the sociological.
The first image, "Three Part Pop," a 1972 triptych in black and white that is hung vertically, warns the viewer with its lighting, as do the opening frames in most "Twilight Zones."


Miss Fraser-Reid And Mr. Farr
Andrea Cheryl Fraser-Reid, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Bertram O. Fraser-Reid of Durham, N.C., was married yesterday to Alec Winfield Farr, the son of Drs.

Dr.
Francis Wade officiated at St.
Alban's Episcopal Church in Washington.
Mrs.
Farr was until recently an associate in the Washington office of Willkie, Farr &amp; Gallagher, the New York law firm.
In September, she will become an associate in the Washington office of Baker &amp; Botts, the Houston law firm.

Her mother, Lillian Fraser-Reid, is a nurse at Duke Hospital.


The A B C's Of Music -- And How!
Gather three inhabitants of the contemporary-music world in one place, and you may very likely have assembled four or five different opinions on nearly everything.
But there will be only one opinion on education.
Nobody is against it.
Everybody is for it.
Few, however, are getting it, and this is one reason for the low-grade anxiety that now permeates the classical-music scene.
Whatever minimal infrastructure once existed for the teaching of music in public schools has been dismantled during the last 20 years with almost horrific nonchalance.
And without music education, the art-music traditions of the world come to seem merely sonic entertainments competing in a crowded aural marketplace for the right to provide pleasure.


Bosnian Sees His Hope For West's Help Vanish
The threat of NATO air strikes may have helped to persuade Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from two mountains overlooking Sarajevo this weekend, but the President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, appears to have given up hope that the West will come to the rescue of the Bosnian Muslims.
Indeed, even before the break in the negotiations, Mr.
Izetbegovic felt that he had been forced to accept the Serbian-Croatian proposal that Bosnia and Herzegovina be divided into three autonomous ethnic republics held together by a weak central administration.


Corrections
An article and a chart on March 21, about the U.S.
Trust Company's quest for customers among the new rich, included erroneous figures for millionaire households supplied by PSI, a financial services research firm in Tampa, Fla.
The number of such households, based on investable assets only, was 2.5 million in 1989, according to corrected figures from PSI, not 834,000.
That means the number of such households in 1992, 3.2 million, represented a gain of about 28 percent during that period, not an increase of nearly fourfold.
The error came to light when PSI was asked to clarify its data for the article appearing today on page 1 of this section.


Karen Lonergan, John T. Rollins
Mr. and Mrs.
Patrick Lonergan of Mendham, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Karen Marie Lonergan to John Thomas Rollins, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

An October wedding is planned.
Ms.
Lonergan, a graduate of Kutztown University, is the associate corporate event manager in New York for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.


U.S. MOVES TO REGULATE TISSUE TRANSPLANT INDUSTRY
Concerned that infectious diseases like hepatitis and AIDS can be spread by tissue transplants, the Food and Drug Administration will seek expanded authority to regulate bone, skin, cornea and other human tissue used for more than 400,000 transplants a year.
Federal health officials and spokesmen for the growing tissue transplant industry say the transplants, which also include blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and heart valves, are generally safe and have rarely been the cause of infectious disease.


Diane and Woody, Still a Fun Couple
It is strange to see Woody Allen and Diane Keaton together again, still flip and Freudian 16 years after "Annie Hall." There is one especially startling moment in their new screen collaboration, "Manhattan Murder Mystery," opening on Wednesday, when Mr.
Allen carps that Ms.
Keaton has turned into a nutty, superannuated Nancy Drew fixated on "The Case of the Lethal Neighbor."
Besides saying there is nothing wrong with her that "a little Prozac and a polo mallet wouldn't cure," Mr.
Allen advises his sleuthing spouse to mind her own business: "Save a little craziness for menopause."


Carl Gardiner, 88, a Former President of Elizabeth Arden
Carl W. Gardiner, the retired head of the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics and fashion company and developer of the elongated nail-polish cap for easier application, died on Friday at a nursing home in Atlantic Highlands, N.J.
He was 88 and lived in Rumson, N.J., and Palm Beach, Fla.
The cause was kidney illness, his family said.


On Sunday; In the Bronx, A Sportsman Named George
WHO needs the Yankees for intimations of home-town sportsmanship when a fan can stand on a corner of Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx and watch George Vazquez connect at stickball?
He lofts a home run a block length of Avenue St.
John, way up above the street kids, up onto the roof of the six-story apartment building that waits across Timpson Place as aloof as centerfield bleachers.
The hit is a beautiful fact of urban life, an arc above the asphalt on the very same Bronx streets that lately George Steinbrenner, the boss of the Yankees, says are not attractive enough to customers from elsewhere.
He threatens to move his club somewhere more sedate, to the landfill stadia of New Jersey, perhaps.

THE MODEL T'S
What was the point of Rona Berg's Fashion feature "The Model T's" (July 18)?
Was it to illustrate that beautiful women age beautifully?
And what are the "perceptions of age and beauty" that she suggests are being changed here?
There are none that I can see.
She says the six women pictured look wonderful for their age.
In fact, they don't look their age at all.
What is wrong with looking 40 or 50 or 60?
In a society that has dozens of negative words for aging women and precious few positive ones, the message of articles like this is clear: deny the process as long as possible.

'Black Hands of Beijing'
To the Editor:
"There is no Chinese equivalent of an Andrei Sakharov, and one of the greatest challenges Chinese dissidents face in winning sympathy abroad is that few Westerners can even pronounce their names," says Nicholas D. Kristof in his review of "Black Hands of Beijing: Lives of Defiance in China's Democracy Movement," by George Black and Robin Munro (July 25).

Her mother, Prudence Borland, is a sales associate and an architectural designer at Schweppe &amp; Company, a real estate brokerage in Upper Montclair, N.J.


As Nynex Jobs Depart Changes Are Made
ON the surface, Nynex's announcement last month that it was moving 600 workers from an office building here to Manhattan appeared to be just another piece of bad news for Westchester, which has been hit hard in recent years by job losses because of corporate restructuring.
The global telecommunications company said it was moving the employees to streamline operations and cut costs.
Local officials, who said they were at first dismayed that yet more jobs would be lost in the county, recently learned that a developer planned to include Bloomingdale's in plans for a major shopping mall adjacent to the Nynex site -- and that in the long run, economic growth and more jobs could result.


ONE-WEEK STAND
For us middle-aged characters in "servitude of dreary domesticity," "Bridges" is a near-perfect way to spend a lazy evening -- a bit of technical information about photography, a soupcon of self-sacrifice, acceptably erotic sex in simple language, all this in an easy-to-read typographical format and pleasant to the hand.

Brazil Seeks to Return Ancestral Lands to Descendants of Runaway Slaves
Backed by lawyers and land titles, a rancher recently drove black peasants from their traditional lands here, bulldozing their houses, shooting their horses, burning their fences and running cattle through their crops.
But drawing on a centuries-old spirit of resistance, the farmers stubbornly refuse to surrender lands that their ancestors first settled as fugitive slaves.


You Never Know What's Below the Surface
THE passion pit of Long Island beaches is Sunken Meadow State Park.
"I've come upon a lot of lovers there," said Karen Craft of Sayville.
"And they don't stop what they're doing. Even with our spotlights shining and our machines bearing down on them."
In Ms.
Craft's line of work, bodies in the throes of passion are but a few of the nighttime obstacles she happens upon.
A while back she happened upon half a body washed up on the Jersey Shore.
"It was part of a surfer that had been missing," she said.
"It caused quite a stir." Fortunately it didn't go through her hopper.
Treasures in the Sand
The hoppers, attached to the giant sand-sifting machines that Ms.
Craft owns and operates, reveal a wealth of treasures.
"I guess the wallet was the biggest find," she said.
Not the wallet itself, but the cash inside.
How much will be left to the imagination.
It's not what Ms.
Craft finds on the beaches, it's how well she cleans them that offers her satisfaction.


40 Cents a Mile To Acapulco
The long and winding road from Mexico City to Acapulco -- notorious for its puttering trucks, sharp turns and endless weekend traffic -- is no longer the only road between the capital and the Pacific coast.
The remaining 82-mile stretch of a 202-mile toll road opened last month, cutting the driving time to Acapulco from as long as seven hours to about three and a half.
As a result, some of Mexico's most popular Pacific resorts, including Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo and Puerto Escondido, will become much more reasonable destinations for trips by car.
There is, however, a hitch: The fee for cars driving the length of the highway will be $82 each way.
At an average of 40 cents a mile, it is one of the most expensive toll roads in the world.
Most buses running between Mexico City and Acapulco are continuing to use the older road to avoid paying the high toll charges.

Kind Words and Chaos in Country
Pam and Tommy Hall drove up the street in their silver family van, their hands full with a dozen biscuit-and-sausage sandwiches and their eyes full as well, with tears.
They were neighbors of Michael Jordan's father, James, who was found dead of a gunshot wound to the chest 11 days ago in a South Carolina creek after last being seen on July 22.
They had come to the Jordan house in this tiny, close-knit community where the death of a neighbor can have a devastating and lasting impact.


Family Leave Is Law; Will Things Change?
HAILED by some as a savior of American families and pilloried by others as a destroyer of business, the Family and Medical Leave Act nonetheless became law this month with barely a whisper.
The law, which was passed in February but has gone into effect in the sleepy season, requires employers with 50 or more workers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family medical emergencies, childbirth or adoption.
While many large companies already have similar policies, some small businesses, who fought the law as expensive, intrusive and unnecessary, have been considering ways to get around it.


. . . but I Know What I Like
But is it art?
In a project called "Art Rebate," three conceptual artists are searching out illegal immigrants just north of the Mexican border and giving them each a $10 bill.
They say they are honoring the immigrants' hard work and reimbursing them for sales taxes they pay.


ALTMAN ACQUITTED OF BANKING FRAUD
Robert A. Altman, a Washington lawyer charged with trying to defraud regulators about the secret acquisition of First American Bankshares Inc. by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was acquitted of all charges by a jury last night.
The jury forewoman, Barbara Conley, wept as she read the verdict in open court.
It was delivered at exactly 7 P.M., and came at the end of four days of deliberations.


A 'Phantom' True to a Tradition
IN contrast to the Broadway phantasmagoria, "Phantom of the Opera," a motivationless technological marvel, the show at the Candlewood Playhouse in New Fairfield, simply called "Phantom," is a throwback to the traditional virtues of musical theater.
Here, a melodious score with an involving story is the thing, not the set construction, mobilized candelabras and a crashing chandelier.
By now, it's no news that Maury Yeston (music and lyrics) and Arthur Kopit (book) were ready to go with their own take on the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel, "Le Fantome de l'Opera," the source of seven films and at least as many stage adaptations.
But the Andrew Lloyd Webber spectacle got there (London 1986, Broadway 1988) first.


Helping Hand For Nepalis
Among the varied Himalayan treks now available in Nepal, one of the most unusual is a package for medical professionals that combines a camping adventure with volunteer service to poor mountain villages without medical care.
The treks, begun less than a year ago by Himalayan Healthcare, a Nepali-American nonprofit service organization based in New York, invite physicians and other medical professionals of all specialties to join small parties trekking into areas off the normal tourist paths, where Nepali doctors set up ad hoc clinics with medicines and equipment carried in by porters.
In some remote regions, these clinics become the nucleus of permanent rural health centers.
Himalayan Healthcare will offer two treks in the fall, Oct. 3 to 16 and Oct. 31 to Nov. 12.
The cost of each trek is $1,200, which is tax-deductible for doctors and other health care professionals.
Air fares are extra.
The villages selected by the organization this year are in a region known as the Ganesh Himalaya, north of Katmandu.
There, as in many other mountainous parts of Nepal, there are many cases of severe malnutrition, respiratory disease and intestinal problems spread by poor sanitation.


Vietnamese, Identity Split, Wait for Pope
Awaiting their Sunday visit with Pope John Paul II, Vietnamese Catholics today brought carpets to spread on the ground and blankets to keep the children warm as they prayed and listened to music that fused rock and the Orient.
But as they gathered in a Denver suburb last night in anticipation of their historic meeting, they also brought with them a dilemma: after the fall of Saigon 18 years ago and their immigration to the United States, how are these new Americans to persuade their children to maintain old ways and beliefs in a secular society that challenges them profoundly?


Hard-Core Rap Lyrics Stir Backlash
In his latest hit song, the rapper L.L.
Cool J rhapsodizes about the erotic promise of the back seat of his jeep to a girl he has lured there to "give it" to her "real raw."
During a recent appearance at the Palladium in Manhattan, MC Lyte rapped about the "ruffneck" attributes she prefers in a man, among them, an "evil grin," a penchant for trouble and a habit of urinating in public.


Black Life on TV: Realism or Stereotypes?
From the beginning, television -- the image mill for the mainstream -- has not known quite what to do with black characters.
It has struggled, as has the country, to find a place for them that white Americans could find comforting and digestible from the safe distance of their living rooms.
Reality had nothing to do with it.
Were real blacks ever the docile buffoons depicted on "Amos 'n' Andy," or jolly sycophants like Beulah?
Could blacks on television be palatable if they were anything less than Rhodes scholars who speak seven languages, like Bill Cosby on "I Spy," or the properly powdered nurse Julia?
Most seasons, old stereotypes pass for shorthand sociology, broken only by contrarian moments like "Roots" or "The Cosby Show." Now, after the success of street movies like "Boyz N the Hood," television, particularly in a few bold steps by HBO, is making black dramas with the highest production values and an edgy pseudorealism, in which violence and pathology are inherent in being black and crack is a required character.

The Wood Will Meet The Wind
A group of yachtsmen who are mostly content to let time stand still when it comes to their boats gather each year for a race off Nantucket Island, Mass.
Known as the Opera House Cup, the competition has become a classic in yacht racing.
This year's race, scheduled to begin at noon today, is likely to draw as many as 70 yachts.
They include any monohull sailboat 32 feet or larger.
The only caveat is that the boat be built of wood, an increasingly rare material in these days of fiberglass and carbon fiber hulls.

States Head for a Clash Over Company Benefits
The move by states to take the lead in creating their own health care programs puts them on a collision course with the nation's largest companies, which want to offer uniform benefits to their employees.
Impatient with the Federal Government, many states have created a patchwork of innovative health care programs, which means that large employers face different requirements in different states.
But the proliferation of state initiatives, while showing broad political support for the idea of overhauling the health care system, will complicate President Clinton's task in designing a uniform national system of health insurance.

Mutual Funds; Middle Years, Middle Road
PEOPLE in their 40's and 50's are often called the "sandwich generation," squeezed by competing needs to finance their retirement, pay for their children's education and maybe support their elderly parents.
For emergencies, they should keep three months of living expenses on hand, and more if they lack disability insurance and secure employment, said Harold R. Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla.
An umbrella policy that extends their auto and homeowner's insurance also can help protect their growing net worth.

Air Fares: Poor Case, Good Verdict
Predatory pricing.
That's what Continental and Northwest accused American Airlines of doing last summer when it cut air fares.
American, it was alleged, set prices below costs in an attempt to drive competitors out of business; then, having monopolized the market, American planned to raise prices to, well, sky-high levels.
The accusation was feeble.
And the jury needed only a couple of hours to say so.
The jurors figured out that American wasn't stupid enough, first, to intentionally rack up huge losses to eliminate current rivals and then lose much more to keep future rivals from competing after it tried to recoup its losses by raising its fares.

Counters of Plastic Laminate Call for Tender, Loving Care
ORDINARY kitchen and bathroom counters are surfaced with plastic laminate (Formica and Wilsonart are well-known brands).
The material consists of paper sheets saturated with plastic resin, which are pressed together and heated to form the finished product.
Plastic laminate is tough and durable in many ways, but easily damaged in others.
Unfortunately, repairing damaged laminate is often impossible, and patching or replacing it is the only solution.

AUG. 8-14: Babbitt's Grazing Fees; Ranchers Have Heard The Discouraging Word
With the stroke of a pen, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt last week took the first step toward reversing a century of Federal land policy by more than doubling user fees for 27,000 ranchers who graze their cattle and sheep on public ranges.
As they are phased in over three years, the new regulations will bring in only about $20 million a year in added revenue.
But Administration officials promised that this was the beginning of something bigger: a series of new policies that will gradually withdraw subsidies for miners, timber companies and farmers who extract riches from public lands in the West.


SURFACING
VANITY -- Tinted chest hair: Oh, yes.
At upscale salons, some men are shading their grays, and others, mostly bodybuilders, are giving new meaning to the phrase "bleached blond" as they try to make their chests look hairless.
REVIVAL -- Jacqueline Susann: The video of "Valley of the Dolls," released in May, is this summer's rage among camp-loving couch potatoes.
The "Dead Jackie Susann Quarterly," offers satirical fluff about the late author and other celebrities.
VANDALISM -- Graffiti etchings: The Transit Authority says that teen-agers are using pocketknives and other sharp-edged tools to scratch graffiti "hits" into the windows of subway cars and buses.


Who Should Define A City?
Hold the moral indignation.
Don't blow it on Universal Citywalk, the new pedestrian shopping mall at Universal Studios that has become an instant symbol of our eagerness to seek refuge from urban crisis in escapist entertainment.
A lively mix of shops and eating places set within a colorful collage of urbanesque fragments, Citywalk does make every effort to dispel signs of conflict.
But it is too rich a subject to toss away in a snit.
Along with scoops of Haagen-Dazs and Wolfgang Puck's tasty pizzas, the place serves up fine food for thought.
Citywalk is not in a class with the first-rate buildings Los Angeles architects have produced in recent years.
It's in a class with the "Psycho" house.
Though created by the Jerde Partnership, a Los Angeles architectural firm, Citywalk's zippy collage of signs and storefronts is more likely to be nominated for an Oscar than for a Pritzker.
No one would mistake the mall's overscaled facades for a row of storefronts.
Even so, the place is less an escape from Los Angeles than a further mutation of its hyperactive urban genes.


Easy Points Make Tough Path Smoother
IF you want to succeed in a tough tournament like the World Open, held at the Adam's Mark Hotel in Philadelphia June 29-July 5, you need at least some easy games.
Otherwise a schedule like the nine-game Swiss system the 200-plus entrants faced might prove too much.
Alex Yermolinsky, a Piscataway, N.J., grandmaster who won the $12,000 prize with a 7 1/2-1 1/2 score, got one break -- and from an unexpected quarter.
In Round 7, Gennadi Zaichik, a Georgian grandmaster, tripped into a nice positional trap and presented him with an almost effortless point.


Buying Health Insurance With Overseas Coverage
FOR many Americans, retirement is the occasion for fulfilling travel dreams long deferred, with a new freedom from family and career responsibilities, and the luxury of time.
But a youthful sense of adventure may be accompanied by unwelcome infirmities of age.
And when the retiree's wanderlust encounters down-to- earth medical concerns, the issue of health insurance for the older traveler arises.


Viewpoints; The Energy Tax: Its Time Will Come
NOW that the budget battle is over, the nation can pick up the pieces of the broad energy tax.
After long debate, Congress wound up with a narrow transportation fuel tax instead of President Clinton's across-the-board B.T.U. plan.
The funny thing, though, is that during the long national budget discussion, the proposed energy tax was portrayed solely as a deficit-reduction tool.
It surely was that, but it was also much more.
It took an important new approach to taxation.


A FOCUS ON CARING AS WELL AS CURING
Medical schools around the world need to revamp their curriculums to deal with AIDS and many other chronic incurable diseases, an official of the World Health Organization said last week.
Doctors "need to consider their patients as knowledgeable allies, not as passive recipients of care, and involve them fully in the entire care process, including decision-making about treatment," said the official, Dr.
Michael H. Merson, who heads the organization's global AIDS program.


For Fresh Air Fund Campers, a Carnival in the Woods
For almost two weeks, the 216 girls at the Fresh Air Fund's Camp Anita Bliss Color had concentrated on camping in the woods, playing games and hiking in the lush Hudson Highlands.
But this afternoon was different.
This was carnival day, and the girls had transformed a meadow into a raucous carnival ground.
They trampled on the grass -- and each other -- racing from a watermelon seed-spitting contest to face painting to other activities.


Of Betrayal and Seduction


New Worry for Historic Lighthouse Fans
PRESERVATIONISTS like Joel Helander and Joe Arnold have long been concerned about erosion eating away at the foundation of the lighthouse on tiny Falkner Island, three miles off Guilford, Conn., in Long Island Sound.
Now they have a new worry.
They believe that the Coast Guard, which owns the 191-year-old lighthouse, intends to "excess" it, or remove it from its jurisdiction.
This, they fear, would endanger efforts to raise $3.4 million needed to save the 43-foot-high historic lighthouse, the second oldest in Connecticut (the New London lighthouse is older).


Corrections
Because of an editing error, an essay on July 18 about the sin of envy mis rendered Iago's final words in Shakespeare's "Othello." The line should have read "From this time forth I never will speak word," not "From this time forth I never will speak a word."


Farm Stand vs. Neighbors May Test State Law
A CONFLICT has arisen here between a farmer's right to sell produce and other farm goods and the interest of homeowners who oppose that right on the ground of preserving the residential character of their neighborhood.
Some say the result could affect the future of small farming in the state.
Those involved include the farmer, Edward Kielblock, who wants to sell his produce; a group of families who don't want him to relocate a farm stand to a site near them, and the members of the Harding Township Zoning Board of Adjustment.


When Opera Is Home-Grown
JOYCE JONES sings in church choirs and has sung in a gospel group.
When urged to audition for an opera in her hometown, however, she demurred.
"A friend said, 'Go! Try out!' " she recalled.
"I said, 'No!' Then another friend knocked on my door. Finally I went down there, hoping I wouldn't get the part."
But she got it.
So this weekend, along with other local singers who did not plan to do such a thing, Mrs.
Jones is appearing in the New London production of "The Errols," a new opera with music ranging from lilting arias to stage-shaking gospel choruses.


49er's Line Forms At the Whirlpool
Just when the San Francisco 49ers' offensive line appeared on the road to recovery, another serious setback occurred yesterday.


School Asbestos Inquiry Is Focusing on Choice of Labs by Contractor
A joint Federal and New York City inquiry into possibly fraudulent asbestos tests in the school system is concentrating on why school authorities awarded $1.4 million in contracts to two previously untried laboratories, investigators say.
The investigators said that a central focus of their inquiry was whether there was any conflict of interest in the allocation of $1.4 million to the Envirosafe Corporation, a Manhattan concern that was the major test contractor from 1988 through 1990, and in the laboratory deals.


Death Toll Rises to 88 in Thailand Hotel Collapse
Rescue workers in northeastern Thailand searched today for scores of people believed to be trapped in the ruins of a six-story hotel that collapsed on Friday, killing dozens of people.
Using crowbars and jackhammers to dig through the rubble, rescue teams in Nakorn Ratchasima said several people still in the flattened remains of the hotel were able to call on mobile phones to plead for help.


Airlines Emerging From Denial
FINGER-POINTING has become a popular sport among United States airlines.
They regularly blame something or someone else for their heavy losses, trotting out reports that say the culprits are unfair taxes, competitors protected by bankruptcy courts or uncooperative foreign governments.
But the blame game has been ineffective of late.
The airlines have gotten signals both from Congress and from a Texas jury that they cannot look elsewhere for quick fixes.
And the airlines, which have lost more money in the last three years than they had earned since the first flight at Kitty Hawk, may be getting down to overhauling their businesses.
The changes, they hope, will result in fewer fare wars and perhaps make the industry less of a blood-soaked gladiatorial arena.


Cycling Michigan
To the Editor: I very much appreciated Laura Mansnerus's article on cycling in Michigan (June 6).
I have cycled in parts of about 15 states in this country and in a few foreign countries, including Canada.
In 1985 a friend and I cycled along much the same route described in the article, except that we started in Milwaukee and took the ferry across to Ludington, Mich., before proceeding north along the dunes and eventually beyond Traverse City.
I enjoyed every minute of the ride.

White House Memo; Weary Clinton Takes Break From His Own Frenetic Style
After a whirlwind first stretch that has lasted seven long months, President Clinton has finally gone on vacation today.
He has left Washington weary; even worse, much of his support is exhausted.
Not for two generations has a new President sought to do so much, so fast and so directly.
And not since modern polling began has popular approval of a new occupant of the White House declined so precipitously and failed to rebound.


A New and Expanded Death Penalty Measure
BEYOND its gun control proposal, the Clinton Administration's crime bill contains two provisions dealing with another issue that provokes ferocious debate: when and if the Government should put criminals to death.
The bill expands from one to 47 the number of crimes for which the Federal Government may seek the death penalty.
It also restricts prisoners' use of the only legal means of challenging their state court convictions in Federal court -- writs of habeas corpus.

Sugar on Top
Nothing captures the mood of a moment like smell.
Blasts of glitzy, spicy "floriental" fragrance played perfectly to the 80's, with their overpowering sweet smell of excess.
Remember Giorgio, and Poison?
Deliberately cloying, pungent, so pushy that they barged into a room before their wearer and tended to leave well after she had gone, shouting "Do you think I'm sexy?"


Vegas On the Green
DINNER conversation at Tavern on the Green came to a halt one evening earlier this month, as "I'm Every Woman" began to play on the sound system and a male voice announced: "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We bring you our evening's entertainment -- Camille, Sanna and Greg!"
"Oooh," Whitney Houston sang, as three figures stepped into a bath of blue and red lights, out onto a ground-level outdoor stage facing the tables.
Dressed like Victoria's Secret models in a run-in with Jimi Hendrix, they arched their backs and raised their hands to the disco ball above.
When the up-tempo wash of "I'm Every Woman" kicked in, the dancers started gyrating wildly, flailing their arms, acting out vignettes.
The male dancer folded his hands as if in prayer, then crossed his arms to his chest as the women clasped at him competitively.
It was a mutation of memories.
It was "Saturday Night Fever" and "Dance Fever" by way of "Solid Gold" and "Soul Train" with some Janet Jackson "Rhythm Nation" crackerjack moves thrown in for good measure.


Crime
You can always feel the anger of the city in the jumpy dialogue and jangling rhythms of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct procedurals.
But in those series novels in which the cops' archenemy, the Deaf Man, is abroad, as he is in MISCHIEF (Morrow, $20), you also get a whiff of the madness that can send an angry city reeling into chaos.
"This was a city waiting to erupt," the author observes, with a certain relish, of the metropolis he calls Isola.
"Ready to flare. Ready to take offense. Ready to strike out. The Deaf Man liked all that." The criminal flare-ups assigned to the various detectives at the precinct are clever and cruel: for Andrew Parker, a murderer with a mission who is systematically executing graffiti writers; for Meyer, a sobering case involving old people who are being dumped on the streets to die; for Eileen Burke, an unnerving hostage situation.


Dressing Madonna
Madonna won't be packing trunks of clothes by Jean-Paul Gaultier when she goes on tour next month.
The singer, who was dressed by Mr.
Gaultier on her last tour, has just picked the Italian fashion duo Domenico Dolce (left foreground, below) and Stefano Gabbana (in vest) to design the wardrobe for her new tour.
Called "The Girlie Show," it opens in London on Sept. 25 and comes to the United States in October.

Gardening Success Without the Sweat
To the Editor:
"Oh, for a Sharp Spade and a Soft Glove" (Cuttings, Aug. 1) left out a digging implement my family and I have been using since 1918 with great success and without the great labor described in the article -- the digging fork.


In the Region: Connecticut; Stamford Turns Focus to a Satellite Area
THE continuing evolution of Stamford has entered a new phase.
The focus is shifting from the established downtown business district toward satellite areas where population and business growth have accelerated but retailing has lagged.
Most prominent is the venerable Ridgeway Shopping Center, bounded by the major north-south thoroughfares of Bedford and Summer Streets, by Sixth Street to the south, and by an apartment complex to the north.
It is less than a mile north of downtown and the Town Center mall and a few blocks south of Bull's Head, where there is Lord &amp; Taylor and a retail plaza.


A Backstage Visit As a Play Is Born
LOOKING cool in hot-red walking shorts, Lois Teich anxiously repeated the words, "The last two weeks in August." A terrible time to introduce a play with an unknown star -- at summer's end, when half the world is on vacation -- but a terrific time to try out something new -- when those left behind are looking for a pick-me-up.
The last two weeks in August -- from Thursday through 29, to be exact -- is when "Smiling Through," a one-character musical starring Vicki Stuart, will have its run here at the Emelin Theater.
Ms.
Teich is producing the play, a first-time venture for her, so her anxiety was understandable.


The Gods Hunker Down For Another Nasty Twilight
In dead earnest, the participants compare it to the House of Atreus or, closer to home, Wotan and his extended family of Germanic gods.
The less reverential might invoke "Dallas" or a typical afternoon with Oprah.
Either way, the family squabbles among the heirs of Richard Wagner over who will next run the Bayreuth Festival are complex and bitter.
They have led to a situation in which no one -- not even the current chief, Wolfgang Wagner, who turns 74 in two weeks -- has any real idea what will happen next.
It was Richard Wagner who built the Bayreuth Festspielhaus and opened the first festival in 1876, as an annual shrine devoted to his works.
He ran the festival until his death in 1883 and was succeeded by his wife, Cosima, and his son, Siegfried, both of whom died in 1930.
Winifred, Siegfried's English-born widow, ran Bayreuth from 1930 to 1934.
She was (and, at 96, still is) a great admirer of Hitler and was barred by the Allies from having anything to do with the festival.


Candidates Fight for NOW's Support
No sooner had Christine Todd Whitman picked up a political plum in her Republican campaign for New Jersey governor by winning the support of the state chapter of the National Organization for Women than Gov.
Jim Florio tried to persuade one and all that it was more like sour grapes.
Then Mr.
Florio spent the rest of last week trying to steal the plum from Mrs.
Whitman's plate, or at least to force her to share it.
NOW's state political action committee announced its qualified support of Mrs.
Whitman on Monday, but by the end of the week, Mr.
Florio and his Democratic political allies were buoyed by a wave of defections among local NOW chapters.


Hudson Mansion
To the Editor: William Weaver's description of Wilderstein ("Two Hudson Valley Mansions," July 18) evoked memories of two visits, one in which my wife and I had the pleasure of meeting the gracious Margaret Suckley.
It was in the mid-80's and we had arrived on the wrong date for a public tour.
Miss Suckley answered the door and could not have been more accommodating, even though she was entertaining guests at the time.
Her short tour of a few first-floor rooms is something we will always treasure.


Fans Dashing Off to 100-Meter Trials
On opening day of the world outdoor track and field championships, the only finals were the men's marathon, won by Mark Plaatjes, a 32-year-old American, and the women's 10-kilometer walk, won by Sari Essayah, a 26-year-old Finn.
But for many spectators at Gottfried-Daimler Stadium today, especially those who relish the psychological as well as the physical combat of the sport, nothing was more exciting than the first two rounds of the men's 100-meter dash.


With All Plants Drooping, What to Do?
UNTIL steady rainfall comes to assuage the dry ground and fill the reservoirs once again, gardeners will have to remain watchful during the Northeast drought.
Many homeowners have been saddened.
Instead of velvety greenswards, suburban lawns are for the most part crunchy strawlike mats.
Huge shade trees are dropping their leaves to reduce the number that have to be supported by a lengthy root system.
Rhododendron leaves are hanging; some are dead.
Even the pachysandra, a stalwart groundcover, is wilting.
Woodlands are dangerously dry.


Carrie Chorba, Robert Shein
Carrie Christine Chorba, a daughter of the Rev.
Dr.
George E. Chorba 3d and Merle A. Chorba of New Vernon, N.J., was married yesterday to Robert Stuart Shein, a son of Irving and Daphne Shein of Providence, R.I.
The bride's father officiated at the First Presbyterian Church of New Vernon, where he is a senior minister.


A Surprise On the Screen
At a screening of HBO's new film, "And the Band Played On," on Tuesday, some people in the audience were surprised to see the late Steve Rubell, a co-owner of Studio 54, included in a photo montage of people who died of AIDS or who have H.I.V.
The film, which is based on Randy Shilts's book about the early years of the AIDS epidemic, will debut on HBO on Sept. 11.
Rubell died in 1990 of toxic shock, friends and family say.
"It seems irresponsible of anybody to do that without verifying what in fact Steve died from," said Ian Schrager, the hotelier who was Rubell's long-time friend and business partner.
"It's sort of outrageous to me that people take liberties like that. I feel bad."


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; At DDB Needham Worldwide, the birth of an offspring agency proves a difficult delivery.

The fledgling is big for its age, with 25 employees and billings of more than $75 million from Volkswagen of America, Ore-Ida Foods and The Washington Post.


O'Connor Plans A Youth Day
John Cardinal O'Connor announced on Friday that the archdiocese of New York would hold a youth day modeled on the huge Catholic youth meeting in Denver.

To loud cheers of agreement, he said, "All right, then we'll do it."

CHRONICLE
Senator ROBERT C. BYRD of West Virginia, the powerful Democrat who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, is remembered by former classmates at Mark Twain High School in Beckley, W. Va., as a bookworm who thought more about studying than sandlot baseball games.
"He wouldn't play basketball or football with us. He stuck to himself and stuck to his studies," a classmate, Joseph Sieboda, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying Saturday at a reunion for the class of '34.
"But he caught a baseball game for me one time. We won that game. It's probably the only one we ever won."

The cause was kidney illness, his family said.

The bride's stepfather, Irving Blumhof, is a partner in Binks Stern, a London law firm.


Depressed Riverhead Looks to a Riverboat for Salvation


Health Card Would Bar Illegal Immigrants
An Administration idea of issuing "health security cards" to all citizens and legal residents would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving benefits under the proposed health care overhaul, a senior White House official said today.
But the official added that the Justice Department must first study the Constitutional implications of such a move before a final decision is made and it is introduced to Congress.
Civil liberties groups have long argued that such cards would infringe on the privacy of citizens and facilitate greater Government surveillance of individuals.

The Building Blocks Of Newspaper Networks
Television has its national networks.
Electronic newspapers, it seems, are about to have theirs.
Newspaper executives say the industry has begun an evolution toward a handful of national electronic networks that will offer local "brand name" newspaper services.
For instance, one of those networks, America Online, now carries "Chicago Online," the service of The Chicago Tribune.


U.N. Commanders Take Up Plan to Lift Siege of Bosnia's Capital
With their optimism buoyed by the withdrawal of Serbian nationalist forces from two strategic mountains overlooking the city, United Nations commanders turned their attention today to a plan to lift the siege of the Bosnian capital before the second winter of the war.
For weeks, senior peacekeeping officials have been warning that failure to break the blockade of Sarajevo and other cities and towns will lead to suffering more severe than anything Bosnia has endured so far.

For Sale: All Those Fabulous Prizes
For as long as game shows have existed, contestants have taken home valuable cash and prizes.
The viewing audience at home has rarely partaken, except vicariously, of the fabulous goodies from the Spiegel catalogue ("Chicago, Illinois 60609!") and the furs from Dicker &amp; Dicker of Beverly Hills.
"Sports Snapshot" changes that one-way formula.
The weekly half-hour program, which will appear at various times -- often after major sporting events -- on more than 70 stations, including WNBC-TV/Channel 4 in New York, represents the mating of two profitable television genres: the game show and the home-shopping broadcast.

Review/City Opera; Revisiting the Scene Of a Royal Heartbreak
How is one to present "The Student Prince"?
Perhaps just as the New York City Opera did on Saturday night: respectful of its sentimentality, alert to its occasional beauties, happy to leave success or failure in the hands of an audience that will inevitably waver between uncritical embrace and guarded contempt.
The distance between us in 1993 and Sigmund Romberg in the early 1920's is more than a matter of 70 years.
Even at its conception, this tale of royal heartbreak in old Heidelberg pined for a fanciful and romantic past.
What it offered City Opera patrons on Saturday -- and will continue to offer in a near-unbroken two-week string of performances continuing tomorrow night -- is yearning doubled and once removed: a nostalgia for an earlier nostalgia that was powerful enough to keep the original production going for 608 performances.

Sports of The Times; For Jordans, Arrests Provide No Solace
THE last time I checked, being in the wrong place at the wrong time is neither a crime nor a sin, just incredibly bad luck.
James Jordan, the patriarch of the Jordan family, had the sheer misfortune of being vulnerable in a luxury car, off a highway in the middle of the night in the United States of America, 1993, and he paid with his life.
It could have happened to anybody, but it happened to the Jordan family of North Carolina, and the first thing anybody should say is, I am terribly sorry.


Police Hit During Greenwich Village Fight
Thirteen people were arrested yesterday morning on riot and other charges during a street disturbance in Greenwich Village in which police officers were pelted with bottles, the police said.
The disturbance, which eventually involved about 500 people, erupted after the police responded to a fight between several off-duty police officers and another group.


Claude Rimington, 90, Biochemist And Theorist on a King's Ailment
Claude Rimington, a British biochemist who suggested that King George III had suffered from an inherited abnormality, died on Aug. 8 in Askeroy, Norway, the British press said last week.
He was 90 and had retired to Norway in 1968.
Professor Rimington held a chair in chemical pathology at University College Medical School in London from 1945 until 1967.
He was an authority on the biochemistry of porphyrins, pigments that are vital components in hemoglobin, an element in blood.

Bob Ojeda, seriously injured in the March 22 boating accident that killed two of his teammates, Steve Olin and Tim Crews, is scheduled to make his first start of the season Monday night for the Cleveland Indians.
It will be a tough assignment for Ojeda, made even more difficult by the fact he will be facing the Toronto Blue Jays, who share first place in the American League East with the Yankees.
The game is the first of three that Toronto will play at Cleveland Stadium this week.

Japanese Bankruptcies
The number of Japanese businesses that fell into bankruptcy declined last month.
There were 1,167 cases of bankruptcy in July with debts of more than 10 million yen ($98,000) each, down 1.3 percent from June and 1.4 percent from a year earlier, according to the Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Company.
The bankrupt companies had debt of 644.25 billion yen ($6.3 billion), up 3 percent from the previous month but down 6.8 percent from a year earlier.
Business failures have numbered more than 1,000 a month for six consecutive months.


Essay; Weighing On Foster's Mind
In the weeks before Vincent Foster's death, he was working on overcoming ethical concerns about one of Hillary Clinton's assets by putting the Clintons' financial holdings into a blind trust.
The guilt-ridden Deputy Counsel may have mishandled a potential conflict of interest in Value Partners, an investment group in which Mrs.
Clinton held nearly 1 percent; her estimated share is $100,000.


Despite New Budget, Fed Is Unlikely to Ease
The Federal Reserve's 12-member group that sets short-term interest rates will meet on Tuesday for the first time since Congress passed the President's budget.
But despite fears that higher taxes and spending restraint will crimp economic growth, the committee is not likely to provide the kind of quid pro quo -- easier money for tighter fiscal policy -- that the Bush Administration received in the fall of 1990.
Back then, the Fed lowered rates a couple of days after the budget passed -- after promising ahead of time that it would do so.
Now, the widespread expectation is that when the monetary-policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets on Tuesday, it will do nothing.


Altman Verdict Is Stinging Loss For Prosecutor
The acquittal of Robert A. Altman of all criminal charges by a New York State jury early Saturday night was a stinging defeat for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which indicted the Washington lawyer on nine counts of fraud and bribery a little more than a year ago.
But lawyers familiar with the case said it was a loss that might have been avoided if the District Attorney's office had sought a much narrower indictment.
That was the approach taken by the Justice Department when it indicted Mr.
Altman in an alleged scheme to deceive banking regulators about the takeover of First American Bankshares Incorporated by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.


Injuries Leave Giants In a Jam
A visiting reporter watching the Giants for the first time this season -- when they lost by 23-17 to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday night at Giants Stadium -- had a vision for the lead in his story when the Giants meet the Washington Redskins in Week 6 at Washington.
He scribbled and passed along a note in the press box, after watching five different Steelers make runs of 10 or more yards, after watching the Steelers finish with 188 rushing yards and after watching a makeshift Giants defensive front mount little to no pass rush.

Demjanjuk Ruling Due Wednesday in Israel
The Supreme Court is to rule Wednesday whether John Demjanjuk should stand trial on other war-crimes charges even though the court has overturned the 1988 conviction that he was "Ivan the Terrible" at the Treblinka death camp.
The Government said last week that there was no public interest in pressing new charges against Mr.
Demjanjuk, 73, a retired auto worker from Cleveland, despite evidence that he had been a guard at other Nazi camps.
The court is hearing petitions from survivors of the Holocaust and others that Mr.
Demjanjuk stand trial again.


Two Men Are Charged With Murder Of Jordan
After two days of intensive investigation, authorities from the Cumberland County Sheriff's office said today that two 18-year-old North Carolina men had been arrested in an adjoining county and charged with the murder of James Jordan, the father of the basketball star Michael Jordan.
At a news conference early this morning, the county's chief of detectives, Art Binder, described a random act of violence that investigators believe had no connection to any wider plan or conspiracy.
Jim Coman, an agent from the North Carolina Bureau of Investigation, said at the briefing that the homicide was "the kind of random violence that all the public was concerned about and afraid of."

On Wheels: America at 10 M.P.H.; Rugged North Holds No Smooth Ride
Judy Garland and Bob Dylan were both born in northern Minnesota, about 35 miles apart, she (nee Frances Gumm) in Grand Rapids, he (Robert Zimmerman) in Hibbing.
It's hard to find traces of his roots in Hibbing, at least for someone just passing through, but in Grand Rapids there's a museum for her, on the third floor of what was once a school.
The exhibit is particularly good on Judy's Grand Rapids years, age 0 through 4.

Review/Television; For Nostalgia Buffs, Yesterday's Hollywood
"Hollywood on Hollywood" is an account of how the movie industry has treated itself on screen from the 1930's to yesterday.
The hourlong tour begins with scenes from movies about starlets becoming stars and stars throwing tantrums and newsreels of actors and actresses giving their all, approximately, for World War II bond drives.
After the war, according to Richard Schickel, who wrote, produced and directed, the business changed and Hollywood turned on itself, as evidenced particularly by a couple of sizzling scenes with Rod Steiger and Shelley Winters from "The Big Knife." Now actresses playing actresses were complaining on screen about what they had to do for producers to get there.


Giuliani Calls For Replacing School Board
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, said yesterday that the New York City public school system was performing so poorly that the city's Board of Education should be abolished and replaced with separate boards for each of the five boroughs.

Giuliani joined a growing number of politicians who say the city's school system has become an unmanageable behemoth.
He took aim at Mayor David N. Dinkins's record on education, contending that the schools have deteriorated and could be reformed only by drastically revamping the school bureaucracy.

Pope Edits His Most Critical Language to End Visit on Positive Note
On the last day of his stay in the United States, Pope John Paul II scaled back criticism of American moral values, apparently seeking to recast the image of his visit as that of a pastor to his flock rather than a chastising prophet of decline.
Addressing the final Mass of his four-day visit, the pontiff departed from the prepared text of a speech to nearly 400,000 worshipers at Cherry Creek State Park, deleting emotive language about abortion and other "horrible crimes against humanity" and skipping a passage that spoke of America's "confusion about what is right and what is wrong."

PULSE: Consumer Spending
Metropolitan-area consumers spent an average of $34,538 per household in 1990-91, up 10 percent from 1988-89, according to the Labor Department.
Despite the increase, expenditures in many discretionary categories, like new cars and entertainment, wer down because of the region's sluggish economy.
Consumer spending in the region was higher than the national average in most categories.
One exception is transportation - because area consumers spend almost three times more than the national average on public transportation and less on new cars and gasoline, their total outlay for transportation is 4 percent less. *26-county area including New York City and surrounding suburbs in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

The Phony Retroactivity Scare
Repeal retroactivity.
The mantra isn't quite as catchy as, say, "no taxation without representation." But that hasn't stopped the Republicans from using it to rouse voter anger at the budget bill passed by the Democrats and signed by President Clinton.
The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, and friends are incensed that the bill backdates the tax increases to the first of the year, three weeks before Mr.
Clinton took office and months before he sent the legislation to Capitol Hill.
The backdating may not be fair play. (In a slightly macabre twist, the bill raises taxes on the estates of about 1,000 individuals after they died.) But it's not illegal, and the damage is minor, hardly enough to justify Mr.
Dole's raucous outrage.

Christie's Run to Glory Is Second-Best 100 Ever
If it was not the race of the century, it was close.
It was the men's 100-meter final tonight in the world outdoor track and field championships, and it brought together four superstars -- three from the United States and one from Britain.
And when it was over, Englishman Linford Christie was the victor in the second fastest time in history.
The 33-year-old Christie, who is the defending Olympic champion, outran 32-year-old Carl Lewis, who captured the 100 in all three previous world championships; 24-year-old Andre Cason, the new phenom who gets faster with each race, and 27-year-old Dennis Mitchell, who is as intense as he is gifted.
Christie's time of 9.87 seconds was just one-hundredth of a second slower than the world record Lewis set in winning this title in Tokyo in 1991.

A History of Pollution in Mexico Casts Clouds Over Trade Accord
With mounds of lead waste smoldering at an abandoned battery-recycling plant outside town, toxic garbage piling up at the local dumps and industrial discharges flowing untreated into rivers and sewers, a new environmental enforcement agency opened offices here last fall promising to crack down as never before.
Ramiro Zaragoza, the young lawyer in charge, hired 33 inspectors, outfitted them in green windbreakers and began training them to take on the malfeasants.
In Mexico City, officials announced a new dawn in the country's fight against pollution, new proof that if Mexico was allowed to join Canada and the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement it would not sacrifice its environment to attract business across the border.
Toxic Legacy of Decades
But in Tijuana it was not that easy.
Other agencies would not lend their files on the city's 700 industrial plants, officials in and outside the enforcement office say.
Laboratory studies could not be done for lack of equipment or supplies.
Then, for five months and without explanation, paychecks did not arrive.
Mr.
Zaragoza says he is as determined as ever, but only five of his inspectors are still on the job.
"We've been bluffing," he said, sitting behind his desk and doing his best to smile.
"If they knew how few people we had, they would just laugh at us."
Faced with the toxic legacy of four decades of almost unregulated industrialization and desperate to win approval for the pending trade agreement, Mexico has taken extraordinary measures in the last few years to strengthen its environmental controls.
On Friday, Mexico, Canada and the United States also announced supplemental accords intended to insure the enforcement of Mexican labor and environmental standards under the agreement, which would eliminate most barriers to trade and investment among the three countries.
Supporters of the trade pact say the side accords will force compliance by investing three-nation labor and environment commissions with the power to impose fines and trade sanctions as penalties of last resort against Mexican violators.
The proposed arbitration process is complicated and long, however, and many environmentalists emphasize that it will ultimately be up to the Mexican Government to see that its goal of rapid economic development for the country's 84 million people does not come at an enormous environmental cost.
The Problem Is Huge
But despite hundreds of new inspectors, millions of dollars in environmental projects and many speeches by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari declaring Mexico's commitment to protecting the environment, even some in the Government acknowledge that the country has only started, somewhat haltingly, to confront a problem of staggering proportions.
"We have just begun to scratch the surface of what needs to be done," said the director of the National Institute of Ecology, Sergio Reyes Lujan.
Mexican ecological laws are viewed by many environmentalists as good and getting better.
But a close look at Government environmental programs suggests that those laws are being undermined for reasons that may persist despite the new threat of trade sanctions.
While new environmental inspectors have fanned out across Mexico, their work continues to be hampered by insufficient and uncertain resources, political considerations and, at least occasionally, by corruption.
Where the Government has cracked down on polluting industries, it has barely started to follow up with alternatives for those put out of business or incentives for steady compliance.
Glaring Lack of Services
Strategies to limit the use of hazardous materials or otherwise prevent pollution are almost unheard of.
And the public disclosure of information about companies' environmental practices is almost unimaginable.
As officials evoke images of a vast consumer market with boundless opportunities for investment, Mexico's lack of basic environmental services is glaring: in the Valley of Mexico, home to the capital and some 16 million people, almost nine-tenths of the waste water still goes untreated, according to Government figures.
For some 60,000 industrial companies, there is a single toxic-waste landfill.
There are no commercial incinerators for toxic wastes.
Mr.
Reyes, a blunt-spoken physicist who has led Mexico's environmental efforts since 1986, can recall an agency that performed no inspections, did not even measure the air in Mexico City and got its first computer when he borrowed it from his 21-year-old son.
He is astonished by "the rate of change," a phrase that has become his public mantra.
The Border The Boom Is Clear, So's the Blight
Public debate in the United States is being driven largely by the experience of the border, where Government promises of a better tomorrow have a long, bitter past.
Here, the dangers have already been vivid for two decades, as Mexico has drawn hundreds of foreign-owned industrial plants, called maquiladoras, with tariff, tax and other incentives.
In Ciudad Juarez, the problems are as plain as the great brown banks of smog that drift across the Rio Grande into El Paso, Tex.
Elsewhere, they are sometimes less visible but more frightening: In Brownsville, Tex., an inexplicably high incidence of babies who are delivered stillborn without brains has led people to suspect contamination from industries just across the border in Matamoros, where the same phenomenon has appeared.
One fear that American environmentalists draw from the industrial boom along the border is that freer trade will mean more traffic, more industry and thus more pollution.
But that focus underscores how little the accord's potential impact has been studied and how narrowly it has been seen.
Some economists believe that the crush of industry along the border could actually diminish under the agreement.
But scant attention has been paid to the possible environmental effects on the Mexican interior of new activity in areas like agriculture, mining and forestry.
The new "U.S.A.-style" dry-cleaning outlets popping up around Mexico City hint at the vast range of problems.
Unlike American dry cleaners, which are closely monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, nearly all the Mexican operations dump their hazardous wastes in the trash, a franchise manager, Alberto Shamosh, said.
He told of searching for months and then paying dearly to have a waste company from Guadalajara take away his chemical sludge.
Upholding the demands of some American environmental groups for a fuller accounting of the trade agreement's effects, a Federal judge ordered the Clinton Administration last month to provide a complete environmental impact assessment.
The Administration has appealed the decision, which could delay carrying out the pact well beyond Jan. 1, when it is supposed to take effect.
A ruling on the appeal is expected in late September.
Hoping to dispel pressure for such a study, the Bush Administration released a report last year dismissing the other major fear of American environmentalists: that a trade agreement might turn Mexico into a haven for industries trying to escape tougher environmental regulations to the north.
Environmental Protection Agency officials acknowledge that some furniture manufacturers, automobile paint shops and other businesses have already moved to Mexico for just this reason.
They insist, though, that cheaper labor and lower environmental-regulation costs might defray the expense of relocation only for a tiny handful of industries that could be easily controlled.
The Newcomers Laws Are Flouted, Reforms Touted
Tijuana is not convinced.
"They have come here from all over, saying they are going to invest, that they are going to help us," said Maurilio Sanchez, a community organizer in Ejido Chilpancingo, a dusty sprawl of tarpaper and brick that sits just below a big maquiladora park on the city's outskirts.
"But when it comes to complying with the ecological laws, they say they cannot speak Spanish."
For the most part, Mr.
Sanchez said, the authorities ignore him.
But they have been paying more attention since March 8, when sewer openings in the neighborhood exploded and he led a clutch of firemen and inspectors to a waste recycling business in the industrial park.
Just as the posse arrived, the company's owner and two workers were pouring barrels of toxic chemicals down a sewer drain.
Investigators concluded that they had been doing so for years.
By law, the foreign-owned plants are obliged to ship their hazardous wastes back out of Mexico for disposal.
In practice, officials say, there is a flourishing traffic in waste-dumping.
A United States Congressional study last year found that fewer than one-third of the plants even reported on their wastes as required and that the reports went virtually unchecked.
Compared with even two years ago, Mexican officials assert, their ability to track and control such problems has taken a giant leap forward.
At one point in 1991, according to Government figures, the country's environmental agency had seven inspectors assigned to 15,000 industries in Mexico City.
Under the new agency set up last fall, the office of the Attorney General for Environmental Protection, inspections officially jumped from 1,380 in all of 1989 to 6,937 in the first four months of this year.
While many environmentalists consider those figures suspect, there is no dispute that tens of millions of dollars have been committed to new sewage treatment plants, new landfills, new air-quality monitoring programs.
More than 200 new environmental regulations are being written or rewritten with the help of international consultants.
The Inspectors Paltry Resources (And No Paycheck)
In their campaign to push the trade accord through the American Congress this fall, Mexican and American officials have promised to channel billions more dollars to clean up both sides of the 2,000-mile border.
And World Bank officials say they will lend as much as $600 million to support Mexico's environmental projects and agencies over the next several years.
But to follow two conscientious young federal inspectors on their rounds is to wonder about the effectiveness of the new force.
Puttering up Tijuana's hills in a Volkswagen bug, the inspectors -- Aidee Solano, clad in her green windbreaker and jeans, and Carlos Padilla, clad in just the jeans -- make their way to Bronzart S.A., a maker of bronze statuettes that moved in eight months ago from Southern California.
They tell the plant manager they simply want to take a look around, see the manufacturing process, check on the disposal of wastes.
"Just like in Los Angeles," he says, "right?"
But after that welcome comparison, the manager indicates that he expected things to be a little different.
Unlike in California, he has not bothered to clean out his waste water or have it treated.
He is not sure what to do with the refuse from his smelting operation, he says, so it is piled up in a big mound behind the plant.
Shouting over the roar of machines, Miss Solano, who studied biology in college, questions a supervisor about the chemicals in the big drums.
She asks for and receives information on each, but does not bother with samples; there is no laboratory to perform the analysis.
After five months without a paycheck, it seems heroic that the inspectors show up for work at all.
In similar straits, two inspectors in the Ciudad Juarez office were recently dismissed after complaints that they unsuccessfully solicited big bribes at a local engine plant.
The head of the Juarez office was dismissed as well.
But according to some Mexican and American environmental officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, his more serious failing may have been to push hard for inspections against the wishes of superiors afraid of angering local businessmen on the eve of a national presidential campaign.
Government officials denied that charge.
They do not dispute, however, that the minister in charge of development programs and environmental affairs, Luis Donaldo Colosio, is considered a leading contender for the governing party's nomination and many of his subordinates campaign intensely, if quietly, on his behalf.
The Prospects Some Pray the Pact Will Bring Converts
Much as they have complained about the shortcomings of Mexican enforcement, many environmentalists acknowledge that more rigorous inspection of manufacturing plants is only one of the needed improvements in the country's environmental controls.
"The question is whether, when the factories reopen, anything has really changed," J. Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, said in an interview in Washington.
Among the statistics that Salinas Administration officials routinely hand out, there is no count of follow-up inspections.
Efforts are under way to make industries pay for their own waste treatment, and in what supporters of the trade agreement hail as a sign of the environmental cooperation it will encourage, Mexican officials and Los Angeles County prosecutors in June forced an American company to pay $2.5 million to clean up lead wastes from the battery-recycling plant it operated outside Tijuana.
But for now, pollution-prevention efforts are almost nonexistent, and incentive-based solutions to specific pollution problems are just getting off the drawing board.
In a 1991 study often quoted by Mexican officials, two Princeton University economists, Gene M. Grossman and Alan B. Krueger, conclude that "economic growth tends to alleviate pollution problems once a country's per capita income reaches about $4,000 to $5,000" -- Mexico's level now.
To many Mexican and American environmentalists, the study, prepared for a conference sponsored by the Mexican trade ministry, smacks of wishful thinking.
But if changing attitudes is more complex a matter than the average amount of money in people's pockets, more and more American environmentalists have come to support the trade pact on the ground that it might strengthen Mexicans' environmental awareness along with their economy.
Just across from El Paso, where the pressure is building for binational solutions to the air-pollution problem, a brickmaker in Ciudad Juarez, Pedro Gonzalez, lent support for this thesis.
He was describing the Government's insistence that he stop burning tires and sawdust in his kiln and start burning propane gas.
"The truth is, all of this is happening because the gabachos are pressuring us," he said of the move toward cleaner fuels, using slang for Americans.
"But we have families, too. The owners may not care. But we have to live here."


Joey Coyle, 40, Dies; Philadelphian Took Armored Car's Cash

EARLIER this year as part of his campaign for a new health care system, President Clinton fired a salvo at pharmaceutical companies, criticizing them for the high price of drugs.
The Administration is now gearing up for a national fight over a health care package that will include lower medical costs as a goal.
A new biotechnology patent could help drug manufacturers meet that goal on their own.
Perseptive Biosystems of Cambridge, Mass., won a patent last week for a tool to purify molecules that it says shaves hours -- and therefore dollars -- from the usual method.
The process, called chromatography, is a first step in making groups of drugs like human-growth hormones, insulin and medication for heart disease, anemia and hemophilia.

CHRONICLE
DAVID KENNEDY, 22, from Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., has had his dibs in for a number of scholarships and grants in the last few years but, he said, the process of becoming a Luce scholar could only be described as "hyper-competitive." Mr.
Kennedy graduated from Harvard this year with a bachelor's degree in social science.
He'll be one of 18 Americans, all under 30, who will be honored Aug. 26 at a "send-off" lunch given by the Henry Luce Foundation at the Asia Society.
The 18 men and women, from across the country, chosen from 125 nominated by U.S. colleges and universities, will spend a year in an Asian country learning the culture as an insider.
Mr.
Kennedy said he would be affiliated with a South Korean university social policy center, working with a professor involved in community poverty programs.
Mr.
Kennedy has taught himself the Korean alphabet but, he said, "part of me is very scared" of not being able to communicate well for at least four months.

FEDERAL money is tight.
Corporate underwriting is tough to find.
How can a popular public television program survive these troubled times?
Syndication may be one way.
Starting next month, "Motorweek," a long-running show produced by Maryland Public Television, will be shown first on commercial stations, and then, later in the week, on public television stations.
Officials at Maryland Public Television hope to recoup the costs of "Motorweek" -- roughly $1.5 million a year -- through this arrangement, which they say is a first for a public television program.

Critic's Notebook; Ritual and Performance: Sampling the Exotic On Its Home Ground
Opera and chamber music hold the spotlight here, but a recent visit also yielded a very different kind of music experience.
One afternoon, a few hours before settling into the Santa Fe Opera's production of two rarely heard Kurt Weill operas, I drove about 30 miles south, through breathtaking high mesa country, to see the annual Corn Dance at the Santo Domingo Pueblo.
The Corn Dance is a daylong ritual in which the Indians of the pueblo pray for rain, and by extension, a bountiful harvest.
It is one of several seasonal ceremonies that take place during the year, each with a different purpose and form.
Under the blazing desert sun, about 1,000 dancers filled the pueblo's large central plaza, and nearly as many onlookers watched from roofs and balconies of the surrounding adobe houses and from every available bit of standing room at the plaza's entrance.

Officials for the cellular carriers in the Lumberton, N.C., vicinity that presumably cooperated with the police could not be reached.

Getting Down With Nature


Review/Theater; An 'All's Well' Ruled by Karma and Mortality
From the very beginning of the New York Shakespeare Festival's iconoclastic production of "All's Well That Ends Well" at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park there are plenty of clues as to what the young British director Richard Jones is up to.
Votive candles border the entire, considerable length of the front of the stage, and a child, wearing a skeleton mask and clasping a scythe, holds vigil before the corpse of an old man.
We are in the very maw of death and of the opaque mysteries that lie beyond.
But the real tip-off as to what Mr.
Jones's intentions are comes from the ethereal music, by the composer Jonathan Dove, which underscores every significant turn of plot and every statement that might be construed as cosmic in this prickliest and least cohesive of all of Shakespeare's comedies.
A mystical, fairy-tale blend of harp, chimes and celestial trumpet calls, the score immediately brings to mind such memorable Shakespearean lines as "We are such stuff as dreams are made on," and "A sad tale's best for winter."

Nigerian Star Blames Politics for Murder Charge
About the only facts on which all sides in the case agree is that the body of a man was found here in January, not far from the house of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, Nigeria's most popular musician and an outspoken critic of the military Government.
Fela, as the 54-year-old singer and saxophonist is known, has since been arrested, jailed, charged with murder and released on bond.
He vigorously denies any involvement in the killing, and he calls the charges ludicrous and politically motivated.


Blending Kindness With Sternness
It is the task of Popes to talk about religion, and for that very reason their religious messages are often considered newsworthy only when they can be distilled into immediate political or moral directives.
That is all the more likely when the Pope is known to be as politically minded as John Paul II.
Given that fact as well as the code language of American politics, it might have been inevitable that the Pope's speeches here came across to many people as highly political and confrontational, a severe critique of the United States.

"This is one of the biggest moments in my life," said the 33-year-old Eriksson, who was beaming after his 4-year-old trotter from the United States scorched the mile and a quarter in 2:27 flat, shattering the world record set by the French horse Reve d'Udon in the 1990 International Trot and equaled by Sweden's Peace Corps the following year.

Birdonthewire Is Latest On Saratoga Upset Rolls
On a race track where Sky Beauty and a few other favorites have survived the omens, a pair of long shots restored Saratoga's image as the house of upsets today when Birdonthewire won the Forego Handicap over Harlan, with both of them outrunning the favorites.
It was textbook Saratoga: the 8-5 choice, Lion Cavern, a star in France last year and in America this year, finished ninth and last with Julie Krone riding.
And Fly So Free, the juvenile champion of 1990 and the 9-5 second choice today, reared in the starting gate and was still trying to recover when the doors flew open.
He and his jockey, Jerry Bailey, were caught by surprise, spent the rest of the race closing the distance and somehow managed to finish fourth.

Royal Crown Cola Picks Texas Agency
The Royal Crown Cola Company's review of its $8 million to $10 million account, previously at Crispin &amp; Porter in Miami, had a surprise ending.

'Misplaced Reliance' Cited on Asbestos
When the Federal Government imposed a law in 1986 requiring the nation's school districts to scour their classrooms, cafeterias and gymnasiums for asbestos, it relied on a basic assumption: that districts under pressure to comply with the law and the companies they hired to help to do so would tell the truth.
It was that assumption that allowed rampant mismanagement, incompetence and possibly fraud to continue unchecked in New York City's program to test for asbestos -- even as a series of warnings about discrepancies in the Board of Education's program raised troubling questions from the start.

Though they may charge a fee for administering the vaccine, they cannot turn away a child whose parents are unable to pay.

Failure in Pop Music Breeds Success on the Stage
While Brian Friel is still the king of living Irish playwrights, one of the dauphins is Billy Roche, 44, a failed pop singer and band leader turned actor and writer.
Mr.
Roche, whose "Cavalcaders" is a hit at the Peacock Theater here, is Ireland's hottest new playwright.
His reputation is rising rapidly in Dublin after his plays, depicting love and hurt and laughter among working-class people in his hometown of Wexford, were ignored here for years while London was gradually discovering and lionizing him.
Mr.
Friel's new play, "Wonderful Tennessee," is filling the 628-seat Abbey, Ireland's national theater, most nights and is scheduled to move to Broadway in October, even though it received mixed reviews.
Just around the corner from the Abbey, "The Cavalcaders," Mr.
Roche's fifth play, in which he acts and sings his own deliberately mediocre pop songs, is packing the 158-seat Peacock.
In recent weeks, three of his plays have been shown on BBC television, which is widely received in Ireland, and the BBC has commissioned him to write at least five new 50-minute screenplays.

(Until he was 7 years old and his family left the city for suburban Long Island, he was, he recalls, "the only Yankee fan in Brooklyn.")

Garth said, he wished he had been responsible and that "if I had the brains and skill, I would have designed it." The caps are part of a promotion for a movie called "Rudy," to be released in October.
The film, starring Sean Astin, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton, is the story of Dan (Rudy) Ruettiger who, against considerable odds, fulfills his dream to play football for Notre Dame (school colors are blue and gold).
Mr.
Garth said he has ordered 50 more for the campaign staff -- "I think they're terrific."


A.T.&amp; T. Is Expanding 'Pentop' Role
A.T.&amp; T., intent on playing a leading role in wireless communications and computing, has set the stage for a direct confrontation with Apple Computer and other companies in the emerging market for small machines that recognize handwriting.
A.T.&amp; T. announced late Friday afternoon that it would increase its investment in the Go Corporation, the leading maker of pen computing software, and turn it into a subsidiary of Eo Inc., the maker of a notebook-sized wireless communicator that runs Go's Penpoint software.
A.T.&amp; T., which recently gained a 51 percent stake in Eo, will retain majority ownership of the new company.
Trade Editor's View
"This is a poker game where A.T.&amp; T. is quietly assembling all the cards," Esther Dyson, publisher of Release 1.0, a computer-industry newsletter, said of the competition for primacy in the so-called Pentop computers.


Bridge
A large number of deals focus around the queen of trumps: can the declarer guess where it is?
Even when it is located, it may still prove to be a thorn in declarer's flesh, as witness the diagramed deal from the Life Master Pairs Championship in Washington last month.
The declarer was Lenore Server of River Vale, N.J., and her admiring partner was Leonard Karp of Tenafly, N.J.
He was revisiting the scene of a triumph in the Markus Cup at his first Nationals almost 40 years earlier.
The partnership was playing the fourth-suit bid of two diamonds as game-forcing, an idea that is now popular although theoretically dubious: There are many hands with about 11 points that need to use a fourth-suit bid at the two-level to invite a game without guaranteeing one.
The alternative is to use it as forcing to two no-trump or until a suit bid is raised.

Braving Fickle Fashion; Donna Karan's Public Stock Offering Is a Risky First for U.S. Haute Couture
The investment bankers who have signed up to sell 11 million shares of the Donna Karan Company to the public should have an easy day's work.
Most, if not all, of the shares of the fashion company, which tapped into the psyche and physique of American career women with easy-to-wear clothing cut for a real woman's figure, are almost certain to be spoken for by the time the offering hits the market.
The offering, which was rumored for months and officially announced late Friday, is one of the most eagerly anticipated of the year, and even the skeptics are angling to buy shares.

New Delhi Journal; In India's Society, Laundry Is No Longer Destiny
When Mark Twain stumbled into India late last century, he looked around a bit and concluded, in his memoir "Following the Equator," that Indians were people who break rocks with their clothes.
Today, from India's southern tip to the foothills of the Himalayas, there are still men and women virtually everywhere who beat clothing against rocks, driving dirt from saris and kurta pajamas by brute force.
They are India's dhobis, its washermen and women, most of whom are untouchable outcastes who have been despised and shunned by other Indians, but whose services have been as central to Indian life as those of its farmers, politicians and Brahman priests.

The deportees, accused Islamic militants sent into exile after five Israeli servicemen were killed, had insisted defiantly for months that none of them would go home until all could, a situation that Israel says will not be possible until this December.

Books of The Times; Laying Bare a Potpourri of Lives
Come to Me  By Amy Bloom  175 pages. HarperCollins. $20.
While he was working on his case studies, Freud found himself amazed that they read so much like short stories, and it's certainly true that when we read him on Dora or Anna O. or Little Hans, part of our excitement comes from knowing we walk the line between actual fact and fictional fact.
You can't help having a similar frisson when you open "Come to Me," Amy Bloom's book of short stories, and discover that its author is a psychotherapist "who divides her time between writing and her practice." But it wouldn't be a frisson worth having if Ms.
Bloom made too much of it; if, say, the narrator of each story was a young, female psychotherapist or the patient of a young, female psychotherapist.

Review/Music; Sufi Devotional Concert Draws a Rousing Crowd
The audience crammed into Rumsey Playfield in Central Park on Sunday afternoon was standing on chairs, clapping raised hands, dancing in place, twirling scarves and T-shirts in the air and shouting approval for favorite lines of songs, like a heavy-metal crowd.
But onstage were eight seated musicians and singers led by a middle-aged man, without a guitar or an electrified instrument in sight, playing traditional music that dates back centuries.
It was just one more jubilant show by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Party, the world's best-known group performing the Sufi devotional music known as qawwali.
The group played a free concert, presented by the Association of Pakistani Professionals, in honor of Pakistan Day.
Qawwali is music with a purpose: bringing ecstasy to listeners so they can experience the divine.
Like ecstatic music from gospel to Moroccan joujouka to techno, it has short, clear melody lines and a steady, driving beat, and it gathers intensity through repetition and improvisational flights.
In his qawwali ensemble, Mr.
Khan's voice is accompanied by tabla drums, harmonium and singers, sometimes as a chorus, sometimes as soaring soloists.

Nazi Propaganda Film Proves Long-Lived
To the Editor:
"Suss" is German for "sweet," but "Sweet Jew" is a mistranslation of "Jud Suss" (The Week in Review, Aug. 1).
The Nazi propaganda film was based on the similarly titled novel by Lion Feuchtwanger, dealing with the life of Joseph Suss Oppenheimer, the 18th-century "court Jew," who was tried and hanged after the death of his patron, the Duke of Wurttemberg.
He was commonly known as "Jud Suss," that is, "Jew Suss."  LOUIS JAY HERMAN  New York, Aug. 6, 1993


Excerpts From President's Speech to Governors on Health Care
Following are excerpts from a speech on health care that President Clinton gave today in Tulsa, Okla., to the National Governors' Association, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a transcription company:
I never want to go through another six months where we have to get all of our votes within one party, and where the other party has people that want to vote with us, and they feel like they've got to stay, and the whole issue revolves around process instead of product, political rhetoric instead of personal concern for what's going to happen to this country.
There's plenty of blame to go around.
As far as I'm concerned, there'll be plenty of credit to go around.
I don't much care who gets the credit for this health care reform as long as we do it.
. . .
Nobody wants to mess up what is good with American health care.
We must preserve it and preserve it with a vengeance.
But we also know what is not so good.

A Setback for Israel To Its Hope to Open A Dublin Embassy
Israel's recent bombardment of dozens of villages in southern Lebanon, which wounded six Irish soldiers serving as United Nations peacekeepers, has seriously strained relations between the two countries and probably delayed the achievement of Israel's principal diplomatic goal here: permission to open an embassy in Dublin.
Dozens of countries, mostly from the third world, have chosen not to have embassies in Dublin because of the expense.
But Israeli diplomats have sought for years to have one here and have been refused, making Ireland the only country in the 12-member European Community without a resident Israeli ambassador.
Ireland and Israel have had formal diplomatic relations since 1975.


Dangers To Forests Seen From Warming

COMPANY NEWS;
Investors led by the Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass completed the purchase of eight food companies from a Dutch conglomerate today for $1.1 billion.
The deal, the largest leveraged buyout in almost a year, forms one of the largest specialty food companies in the United States.

They are Stella Foods Inc., a maker of Italian and ethnic cheeses based in Green Bay, Wis.; the Metz Baking Company, a leading Midwestern baker based in Sioux City, Iowa, which makes Country Hearth and Roman Meal bread, and the Pacific Coast Baking Company in Oakland, Calif., which owns the San Francisco French Bread Company and Gai's Seattle French Baking Company.


CLINTON OUTLINES HEALTH CARE PLAN PAID BY EMPLOYERS
Appealing for support from the "vital center," President Clinton today put forward the broad outlines of his plan to guarantee health care for all Americans, in part by requiring every employer to provide insurance coverage for employees.
While Republicans and small-business advocates warned that the plan could result in the loss of millions of jobs, the White House said it intended to ease the burden on employers by recommending that the plan not take full effect for five to seven years.

Stop Nibbling at Nafta
Finally, President Clinton has completed the easy job: negotiating supplemental accords to the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.
But that leaves him the hard job of negotiating with the people down the block -- members of Congress intimidated by fear-mongering attacks by Ross Perot and the stalwart opposition of some powerful Democrats like the House majority leader, Richard Gephardt.
Congressional opposition is unfortunate because Nafta would have a positive, though small, impact on the U.S. economy even without the supplemental accords.
The accords make Nafta even better by adding a thin layer of protection for U.S. companies facing potentially unfair competition from Mexico.

Enlisting Termites To Fight Infestation
USING a new technique, exterminators may soon be able to rid homes of destructive termites by turning the wood-eating pests into assassins.
The new method first enlists unwitting subterranean termites by luring them with food, in this case, corrugated cardboard tubes, said Dr.
Tim Myles, director of the urban entomology program at the University of Toronto, who conducted the research.
When they enter the tube, the termites release hormones, called pheromones, which attract more termites.
Within a week, more than 5,000 subterranean termites are in each six-inch-wide, six-inch-long tube at any given moment.

Sports of The Times; Horse Racing Is Clearly Confused
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y.
HERE is your annual tip from the summertime home of horse racing, and it has nothing to do with Saratoga: No change will be made next year in the spacing of the Triple Crown races.
Ever since Union City and Prairie Bayou broke down on national television last spring, the people who stage the Triple Crown races have been reviewing the rigors of running three landmark races in five weeks' time.
They have decided it would be tampering with history to stretch out the classics, and it would not necessarily be more humane.
So, the Kentucky Derby still will be run on the first Saturday in May, the Preakness Stakes two weeks later and the Belmont three weeks after that.

The 68-year-old chairman of the nation's largest manufacturer of tuxedos was found buried alive in a barrel-shaped bunker between the Hudson River and a heavily traveled highway in Manhattan yesterday after being kidnapped 12 days earlier, the police said.
Detectives who followed two suspects as they hauled more than $2 million in ransom money from a park later arrested a longtime employee of the victim, Harvey Weinstein, and the employee's brother.

U.S. Seeking New Asian Trade and Security Links
Reflecting what Secretary of State Warren Christopher calls a new "primacy" for Asia in American policy, the Clinton Administration is quietly working with the economically vital region to forge links through security and trade agreements.
But State Department officials and Asian leaders concede that even as Washington turns more toward Asia, it is difficult to keep its gaze focused across the Pacific with Bosnia and the Mideast soaking up its attention.


Placebo Effect Is Shown to Be Twice as Powerful as Expected
"HURRY, hurry -- use the new drugs while they still work!" a 19th-century French physician urged his colleagues.
He may not have known why faddish drugs work on credulous patients, but the fact that they do has been borne out by scientists studying the power of the placebo to cure.
New findings show that the placebo effect -- in which patients given an inactive treatment believe it can cure them -- is most powerful when a trusted physician enthusiastically offers a patient a new therapy.
In a study of more than 6,000 patients being given experimental treatments for asthma, duodenal ulcer and herpes, two-thirds improved, at least temporarily, even though rigorous tests later found the treatments medically useless.
They were then abandoned.


Group of Governors Supports Trade Accord
A group of Republican and Democratic governors announced their support today for the North American Free Trade Agreement as President Clinton embarked on a tough battle to push it through Congress.
Several governors said they were satisfied with the side agreements reached last week on environmental and labor issues after discussing them today with Mr.
Clinton, who was in Tulsa for the annual conference of the National Governors' Association.


Review/Music; Diving Into Dvorak And His Milieu
One of the great joys of attending an overstuffed, varied and inventive music festival is also one of the great frustrations: you never know when a truly enlightening and memorable moment may occur. (So however weary you get, you had better not miss anything.)
The Bard Music Festival, Rediscoveries, in its fourth year at Bard College here, is devoted to Antonin Dvorak and his world.
The first weekend, which closed this evening, offered no fewer than seven concerts, each with a preliminary talk, and two panel discussions.
Rumor had it there was also an exhibition of photographs, scores and memorabilia across campus, but with breaks between observances little longer, and sometimes shorter, than concert intermissions, this pilgrim feared to stray far from the fold.


To Governors, All Eyes on Clinton's Fight Ahead

Clinton declared: "Surely, we can do it without the kind of rhetoric and air-filling bull that we hear so often in the nation's capital."


Review/Jazz; Joey Baron Leads Odd Trio
The drummer Joey Baron brought an oddly configured group to the Knitting Factory on Thursday night, and he made the most of it.
The group -- Mr.
Baron on drums, Steve Swell on trombone and Ellery Eskalin on tenor saxophone -- played music that at times seemed to be coming through a stereo operating on half its channels.
At other times Mr.
Baron tried to sound like a band, full and complete.
And since there isn't much literature for this instrumentation, Mr.
Baron was referential, drawing on jazz and soul and funk.
It's an old conceit, to be catholic in one's sources, but Mr.
Baron pulled it off, in part because he's so gifted a drummer.
He would spell out ideas with just a ride cymbal, or use his hands quietly on the skins of the drums, or tap out figures with one wooden stick on a metal rim.
Everything he did was small, as if he'd distilled the few gestures it takes to suggest a style.

Discus Star Banned; Morceli to Run
Erik de Bruin of the Netherlands was supposed to start competing today in the world outdoor track and field championships in the discus throw, in which he won the silver medal in 1991 and was again a favorite.
Instead, he was suspended for four years for using banned body-building drugs.
At the same time, Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, who had pledged not to run here unless he received appearance or prize money, relented and said he would compete.
Morceli, as the defending champion and world- record holder in the men's 1,500 meters, is the most glamorous middle-distance runner in the sport.

Bradley's Toughest Lift: His Plate
SHAWN BRADLEY of the Philadelphia 76ers says the hardest part about training for the National Basketball Association is eating enough food to bulk up his 7-foot-6-inch, 245-pound frame.
"People have told me a million times, I'd love to go on your diet," said the rookie center, who has been training privately with 76ers officials after two years away from basketball.
"But it's hard to get that many calories in your body."
Bradley has been trying to eat between 6,000 and 7,000 calories a day to gain weight in the off season.
"I eat anything," he said.
But he's only gained between 1 and 2 pounds since beginning the regimen.
"But I've lost body fat, which is good," he said.


Big Payouts in Donna Karan Offering
As much as anything, the proposal to sell the public shares in the Donna Karan Corporation is a lucrative way for its founding investors to loosen and perhaps eventually break their ties to the red-hot fashion business.

Comptroller Is Accused Of Neglect By Opponent
Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for New York City comptroller, charged yesterday that the incumbent, Elizabeth Holtzman, had repeatedly neglected her duties because she was more interested in obtaining higher office than cracking down on government waste.
With only a month left before the primary, Mr.

But his accusations quickly became bogged down as each side insisted that the other was slanting its facts.


Suspects In Killing Appear In Court
The two men accused of killing Michael Jordan's 57-year-old father, James Jordan, made their first public court appearance here this morning, drawing far more attention than such perfunctory legal proceedings normally receive.

Woman Says Poverty Made Her Abandon Children for a Night of Prostitution
A 25-year-old single mother has told the authorities that she left her 7-month-old daughter and 2-year-old son alone overnight and went to work as a prostitute in New York City because she needed the money after being cut off from welfare.
The woman, Krista Koopman, who lived in a tiny, two-room apartment with the children in Sayville, L.I., said she was forced into prostitution after being dropped from welfare rolls and losing financial support from her estranged husband. 'I Love the Kids'
"I love the kids," Ms.
Koopman said today after spending a weekend in jail.
"I didn't do it for any other reason than financial reasons."

Ship the Mets to New Jersey
Although New York Mets' outfielder Vince Coleman has been sent on an extended vacation for throwing a small explosive at fans, a nagging problem remains: the rest of the team is still here.
Meanwhile, the Yankees, a team in an actual pennant race, have threatened to leave.
Ironies like these give rise to ugly necessities.
It's time for a pre-emptive strike: Let's keep the Yankees and send the Mets to New Jersey.
As someone who grew up in the shadow of Shea Stadium and was 9 years old in the miracle year of 1969, I say this with a heavy heart.
But we all know that it is not fear of the Bronx or limited parking that keeps New Yorkers away from Yankee Stadium.
Rather, most of us are recovering Mets fans, people who just can't let go of the glory that was Mookie.

"But we'll see. You can never tell with these things."

Apple Offers Teachers An Extra-Value Deal
STUDENTS aren't the only ones looking for back-to-school computers.
Judging from the mailbag, many teachers and school administrators are also shopping, or at least yearning, for computers of their own to use at home and in the classroom.
By far the most interest seems to be in Apple Macintosh computers, which are traditionally more popular in schools than they are in the business world.
Apple deserves an "A" for its recent introduction of an excellent new classroom computer, the LC 520, perhaps the best value in the entire Macintosh product line.
It also deserves extra credit for allowing elementary and secondary teachers to buy new Macintosh equipment for personal use at a discount.
But Apple also deserves a "D" -- for disappointment -- because the new LC 520 is not sold to the public.
Only schools can buy it.


Market Place; Drug makers are already feeling a cut in Puerto Rico tax breaks.
SEVERAL dozen health care and drug companies that have factories in Puerto Rico are expected to pay at least $1.88 billion in additional Federal income taxes in the next five years, because of a provision of the new budget law.
The health care companies are expected to generate 50 percent to 75 percent of the additional $3.75 billion in revenue projected for the Treasury from the changes involving Puerto Rico, industry analysts said.
The estimates are rough, they said, because some companies have understated their Puerto Rican credits in financial reports.

Reform-Minded Finance Minister Is Rejected by Iranian Parliament
Parliament today rejected President Hashemi Rafsanjani's choice for Finance Minister, in what was seen as a rebuff to the President's free-market reforms and policies to attract foreign capital.
After two days of debate, broadcast live on the state-run radio, Mohsen Nurbakhsh, the American-educated Finance Minister in the previous Cabinet and a close ally of the President, fell four votes short of the majority needed.
Six other appointees were approved.


Mr. Giuliani and the Schools
The New York City mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani is right when he says the city's troubled school system badly needs an overhaul.
But his prescription -- abolishing the central Board of Education and creating five borough boards -- would create new problems to replace the old.
The system is obviously a mess.
The recent crisis involving botched asbestos investigations to comply with Federal law is only another dismaying example of the board's inability to monitor what goes on in the schools.


Angered by Japan's Barriers, U.S. Apple Growers Retaliate
As pampered and protected as nothing else on the American farm, Columbia River apples grown specifically to break a 22-year Japanese trade ban are taking on a blush of red, a few weeks shy of harvest.
But what was supposed to be a celebration of fruit and free trade is fast becoming a major source of friction between Washington and Tokyo.
The apple farmers here in the nation's most productive fruit-growing region, who have spent more than decade setting up 3,500 acres of orchards to meet Japan's standards, now say they have been betrayed.
Isolated Apple Orchards
Concerned about protecting its own highly lucrative apple-growing industry, Japan has long insisted that American fruit be free of any insects that might cross the Pacific.
American farmers say most of Japan's pest concerns are phony, used as a convenient trade barrier.
Still, until now, the Americans have dutifully done everything the Japanese said they would have to do to get their fruit into Japan.
American apple growers planted trees that were isolated from other orchards to minimize possible contact with insects.
Special traps for bugs were set up.
And some of the fruit has been individually wrapped in paper while still on the tree.
All was set for this year's breakthrough crop.
But then, earlier this summer, Japan raised fresh concerns about pests that the American growers say are nonexistent.
Infuriated, the apple farmers of Washington State, who raise half the nation's crop and ship their fruit to 24 countries, including several in Asia, have taken the first step to bring trade sanctions against Japan.
They are also talking about smashing Japanese electronic products in symbolic acts of defiance.
And at a recent food fair in Japan, American apple growers had a barren display with a sign that read, "Empty boxes, empty promises."
"We have gone through every hoop they have asked us to go through, and we're just fed up," said Doug Pauly, an apple grower and shipper here.
"We've had people tearing out pear trees and vineyards and rose bushes so they wouldn't be near these special orchards. Then, we get this close and the Japanese move the goal posts again. We can't win."
Apples are to Japanese and American trade policy what intercontinental missiles were to the cold war.
Both sides have them.
They have long been a bargaining chip.
And now one side says it is time to put up or shut up.
In Japan, where a single apple can cost up to $5 at a fruit stand, American apples are forbidden by a long-standing agricultural policy that requires importers to prove that the produce is free of insects.
The Americans say they have done this, but the Japanese say other scientific concerns remain.
The Americans, from the growers here to the highest reaches of the Clinton Administration, say it is a clear-cut issue.
As such, apples have become the symbol of President Clinton's effort to open Japanese markets by appealing to the consumer.
Gains for Both Countries
American apples would be a bargain to the Japanese consumer, while bringing huge profits to growers here.
The growers had expected to sell up to 700,000 42-pound boxes, offering Japanese consumers the red and golden Delicious variety of apples at roughly half the price of Japan's major domestically grown variety, the Fuji.
If, as expected, the growers were to get from $75 to $100 a box, it would bring them more than four times what they would receive in this country.
Two weeks ago, the Administration demanded that Japan take steps to import American apples beginning with next year's crop.
"The U.S. side, for its part, has bent over backwards to accommodate Japanese concerns," Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, and Mike Espy, the Secretary of Agriculture, wrote in a letter to Masami Tanabu, Japan's Agriculture Minister.
The American officials demanded a "written Japanese commitment" of all the steps needed for apples to get into Japan next year.
The Japanese, who already import a small amount of apples from New Zealand, have yet to respond to the specific complaints of the letter.
Nor have they explained why these new insect questions were raised at the 11th hour.
In a brief letter to the Clinton Administration they said the recent change in Government in Japan would delay an answer to the questions.
In the past, Japanese agriculture officials raised concerns about the possibility of pests infecting their own fruit if American apples were allowed into Japan.
And they have denied that apples were being kept out for political reasons.
"What Japan needs is for the the United States to prove that its apples are safe," KenjiNOr Nakano, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington, said in an interview.
"This is not a political issue. It is purely a technical one."
With the United States running a $50 billion trade deficit with Japan, apples are a relatively small item on the bargaining table.
But, as Mr.
Kantor said in his letter, the issue has become "highly symbolic."
He raised the issue last month in talks between the two governments during Mr.
Clinton's trip to Japan.
In the American view, Japan bans United States apples for only one reason: to protect their own farmers.
Washington State's 3,500 apple farmers produce twice as many apples as their Japanese counterparts.
But Japan has more than 10 times as many apple farmers, who raise their fruit on small plots and receive high prices for the produce, primarily Fuji apples.
Nor do they see any market logic behind Japanese protectionism.
They contend that Washington apples, marketed for lunch buckets and snacks, would not cut into the markets of Japanese growers because the addition of American varieties would complement the more delicate Japanese product, change eating habits and expand the market.
They point to past food barriers on cherries and beef, which were lifted to the satisfaction of farmers in both countries.
The success of Pacific Northwest cherries, which sometimes sell for as much as $1 a cherry in Japan, has fueled the drive by American growers to get into the lucrative Japanese market.
"Here you have an industry that has played by the rules, done everything right, and in the end still cannot get into Japan," said Bill Bryant, an agricultural trade consultant in Seattle.
"Now it's becoming symbolic of blatant, unfair trading policies."
Of particular concern to the Japanese officials in the past has been whether American apples might carry a pest known as the coddling moth.
The growers here say any such pests are killed during cold storage, when the apples, before shipment, are kept in a dark room at near freezing temperatures with almost no oxygen.
But after the coddling moth issue was satisfied, the Japanese raised a new concern about fire blight, a bacteria that typically infects pears.
They wanted to make sure that no pear trees were grown near the apples; the Washington growers complied, planting orchards that were at least 500 meters, or nearly 1,641 feet, from pear trees.
Since then, new pest issues have been raised.
"We call it the bug-of-the-month club," Mr.
Pauly said.
The Japanese say that even if these pests have not shown up in American fruit, their precaution is warranted by the need to protect their own produce from foreign insects.
Although they demanded that Japan take steps that would lead to apple imports by next year's harvest, some growers here have given up hope that diplomacy will work.
They want to use the stick of reciprocal trade sanctions.
As for all those well-tended apples fattening on isolated trees near the Columbia River -- perhaps as many as 25 million pieces of fruit -- the growers say they will try to sell them to some other country.
But given the cost it has taken to grow them, they say, they may not break even.

Representatives of Chris Dudley, Toni Kukoc and Craig Ehlo met with officials from the National Basketball Association and the N.B.A.
Players Association in Manhattan yesterday to begin discussions concerning disputed multiyear contracts recently signed by the three players, all of whom are heading to new teams.
The three cases, each of which the N.B.A. feels are attempts at circumventing the league's salary cap, were presented before the league's special master, Merrell Clark, a lawyer who will decide whether the contracts are to be upheld or rejected.
If Clark finds that the salary cap rules were violated, heavy fines could be levied.

Early in his career, Ted Parker astonished fellow scientists by walking into a Peruvian forest cold and immediately identifying 15 species of birds that biologists working there for years had never noticed.
In time he could recognize nearly 4,000 tropical species solely by their calls.
Al Gentry was often introduced on the speaking platform simply as the man who knew more about tropical plants than anyone who had ever lived.

A.T.&amp; T. Paying $12.6 Billion for McCaw Cellular
In a move that could profoundly alter telecommunications in the United States, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced today that it would acquire the nation's biggest cellular telephone company for $12.6 billion.
The takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. of Kirkland, Wash., would give A.T.&amp; T. control of a vast wireless network, rapidly blurring the traditional line between local and long-distance service.
The deal, which is subject to Federal approval, would be the fifth-largest takeover in the nation's history.
And for A.T.&amp; T., which has been busily investing in or acquiring a wide range of communications and computing companies, today's announcement represents an aggressive step beyond its previously stated plan to buy only one-third of McCaw for $3.8 billion.
Getting Away From Wires
The outright acquisition is A.T.&amp; T.'s response to the explosive growth in wireless communications -- a field embracing cellular telephones, two-way paging devices, hand-held computers and mobile fax machines, all of which use radio waves to send and receive information.

Zoning Rules Altered to Cover the Waterfront
Approving the first zoning rules specifically for the waterfront, the New York City Planning Commission yesterday said it was signaling its desire for more public access and less high-rise development along the shoreline.
The rules could shape decades of construction on the city's 578-mile waterfront by requiring that developers of certain large residential projects open 15 percent to 20 percent of their land to the public.
The rules also limit building heights in certain zoning districts from 110 to 350 feet, or about 11 to 35 stories.
Sending a Message
Although the text of the zoning amendment, which was approved unanimously, did not specify the areas in which given rules would apply, planners said a general message was intended.

Skembris won twice with White and drew twice with Black.
He is a solid journeyman on the tournament circuit, but was not expected to ridicule Timman's preparation thusly.
Anyone who achieves the status of challenger for the world title is supposed to dispatch such opponents handily.


New York's Chief Judge Imposes Strict Rules for Divorce Lawyers
Looking to protect women whose divorce lawyers take advantage of them, New York State's top judge imposed a sweeping new set of rules yesterday to give clients far more rights.
The rules, believed to be the most comprehensive in the nation, provide a sort of Miranda warning for clients while imposing new restraints on lawyers.
For instance, clients will be entitled to a written fee schedule and itemized bills, and lawyers will no longer be able to take a client's home for unpaid fees.
In addition, a new disciplinary rule explicitly prohibits sexual relations between a lawyer and a client during a case.
Comprehensive Rules
The new rules, which take effect Nov. 1, were announced yesterday by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye of the Court of Appeals, who adopted most of the recommendations made by a committee that had studied the issue earlier this year.
But Judge Kaye went beyond that committee, establishing another committee that would also examine whether the new rules should be extended to other lawyers and their clients.

Arguing that Joel Rifkin cannot get a fair trial in Nassau County, his lawyer today proposed bringing in a jury from upstate New York to hear the murder case against him.
Mr.
Rifkin is the unemployed landscaper who the New York State Police say has admitted killing 17 women.
He was arrested on June 28 when the police found a body in his pickup truck after stopping him for a traffic violation.


Pottery Barn Is Returning to Basics
Pottery Barn might have taken a lesson from Coca-Cola in the dangers of tinkering with a good thing.
Just as the soda maker had to quickly return to the classic Coca-Cola formula after a sweeter version was rejected by customers, Pottery Barn has been forced to go back to the basics on which its loyal following was built.
Customers strayed and sales sank in recent years after Pottery Barn, in an attempt to update its product line, replaced many of its moderately priced tableware and kitchen and home accessories with fancier housewares like Mexican-style vases and Caribbean-style flatware.


Bridge
One of the undoubted geniuses in the history of the game abandoned New York City last month and settled in Boca Raton, Fla.
He is Alvin Roth, who devised many of the key features of modern bidding.
Those who use, for example, a forcing no-trump response to a major suit; game-forcing two-over-one responses, or negative doubles, owe a debt to Roth and to the Roth-Stone system, which he introduced with Tobias Stone half a century ago.
Roth has retired after nearly 30 years as proprietor of the Mayfair Club, which has long ceased to be a home for bridge and has provided for other card games.
In Florida he expects to organize a high-level imp game, to lecture and, he says, "to coach qualified players interested in winning."


Devers Leans Into Her Victory Over Ottey in the 100
Gail Devers beat Merlene Ottey of Jamaica by an eyelash tonight to win the women's 100-meter title in the world outdoor track and field championships.
The time was 1 hour 40 minutes -- the first 10.81 seconds of that for Devers to run the race and the rest for a jury of appeals to decide on a protest by the Jamaicans, who insisted Ottey had won or at least had tied for first.
The 26-year-old Devers is as famous for her conquest of Graves' disease as she is for winning the gold medal in this event and almost winning another in the 100-meter hurdles in last year's Barcelona Olympics.
The 33-year-old Ottey is famous for her always-a-bridesmaid finishes -- third, third, third, fourth, third and fifth in the Olympics events and second, fourth, third, third, third and third in world outdoor championships.


Review/Theater; 2 Aspects of the H.I.V. Experience
If evidence is needed of the good that ill wind sometimes blows, then it may be found through Aug. 29 at the Theater Row Theater, at 420 West 42d Street in Clinton, in the form of "A Better Life."
The author of this aptly titled and benevolent play about mankind's potential for reconciliation and understanding is Louis Delgado Jr., whose past is colored by drug addiction and jail, which ruptured his marriages, warped his relationships with his children and nearly destroyed his self-esteem.
The production is financed with assets seized in drug-related crimes and distributed by the State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services.
And the presentation is a project of Hospital Audiences Inc., now in its 25th year of providing access to the arts for the disabled, the elderly, the homeless, troubled adolescents, participants in drug-abuse treatment programs and people with AIDS.


Heavy Storm Closes Roads And Subways
Torrential rainfall during rush hour caused flooding on several streets and highways yesterday and knocked out service for at least part of the evening on three subway lines, delaying thousands of commuters, the authorities said.
A mile-long section of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive on the East Side of Manhattan was closed, and all westbound traffic on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway was stopped near the Atlantic Avenue exit for much of the evening.
Several highways in northern New Jersey were closed for part of the afternoon.

U.S. Expected to Place Sudan on Terrorist List
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 --
The United States has evidence that the Sudan played a role in the plot to bomb the United Nations and other targets in New York in June, a State Department official said today.
In part because of that finding, Washington has decided to put the Sudan on its list of terrorist nations, the official said.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not provide any information on what the evidence was that linked the Sudan to the plot.


Absent Since March 1984, Austin Ranked
TRACY AUSTIN, the youngest-ever United States Open champion and a former No. 1-ranked women's player, is ranked after more than a nine-year absence.
After two victories at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles last week, Austin is ranked for the first time since March 19, 1984.
She's No. 159, just ahead of the Bulgarian ELENA PAMPOULOVA-WAGNER and just behind BARBARA MULEJ of Slovenia.


Hofstra Loses Co-Captain Safety
Hofstra University's football program received a damaging blow yesterday when it was announced that the 1993 co-captain and starting free safety LEE HARRIS, would miss the coming season because of a herniated disk in his lower back.
"Losing a player of Lee's caliber is a big loss for our defense," said Coach JOE GARDI, "We will certainly feel the loss of his talent and leadership this year." Harris, who would have been entering his third season, led the Division I-AA Flying Dutchmen last year in tackles, with 108, and in inteceptions, with 4.


RESULTS PLUS
GOLF  Schreyer Edges King by a Stroke  Cindy Schreyer made a 3-foot putt for par on the final hole yesterday to earn her first career victory, a one-stroke triumph over Betsy King in the rain-delayed L.P.G.A.
Chicago Sun Times Challenge in Naperville, Ill.
Schreyer shot a one-under-par 71 to finish with a 272 total on the White Eagle Club course.
Her previous best showing this year was a 24th-place finish at the Dinah Shore Open, and she doubled her year's earnings with $71,250.
For King, it was another disappointment, her 20th consecutive tournament without a victory.
Schreyer and King were tied at 14 under when they got to the par-3 16th hole.
Schreyer's tee shot on the 185-yard hole stopped in the left rough, and she chipped within 8 feet and made the putt.
King's tee shot went over the green, and she three-putted from the fringe, her second putt missing from only 3 feet.
The swing gave Schreyer the lead and the confidence she needed to go on to victory.
King finished with a final-round 72, and Gail Graham was third with a 275 total after a closing 68.
Kris Monaghan, Marta Figueras-Dotti and Dale Eggeling wound up tied for fourth. (AP) TENNIS  Cherkasov Upsets Pernfors  Andrei Cherkasov upset 14th-seeded Mikael Pernfors, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), yesterday in the opening round of the $1.04 million United States Men's Hardcourt Championships in Indianapolis.
After losing the first set, Pernfors squandered two set points in the second before falling in the tie breaker.
Pernfors, the 1984 and 1985 college champion from the University of Georgia, suffered his second straight early loss.
The 30-year-old Swede was beaten in the first round of last week's ATP Championship in Cincinnati.
The featured evening match at the Indianapolis Tennis Center, pitting No. 13 Brad Gilbert against Aaron Krickstein, was delayed because of rain.
The other three seeded players won.
No. 10 Andrei Chesnokov beat Thomas Enqvist, 6-2, 6-4; No. 12 David Wheaton downed Francisco Clavet, 6-4, 6-2, and No. 16 Fabrice Santoro defeated Kenneth Carlsen, 6-2, 6-4.  (AP)
HARNESS RACING  Cambest Shatters a Mark in a Time Trial  Cambest became the fastest horse in harness history yesterday, pacing a mile in 1:461/5 during a time trial at Spring Field Fairgrounds in Spring Field, Ill.

U.S. Presses for More Concessions From the Serbs
Despite the Bosnian Serbs' withdrawal of most of their troops from two mountains near Sarajevo, the Clinton Administration says Serbian forces have not done enough to lift the siege of the city and it continues to threaten to use air strikes.
Over the weekend, Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote letters to the 15 other NATO foreign ministers saying that the pullback of Serbian troops, tanks and artillery from Mount Igman and Mount Bjelasnica were a necessary step, but not entirely a sufficient one.
In the letters, Mr.
Christopher laid out other actions the Bosnian Serbs must take in order to forestall allied bombing raids.
Conditions Listed
"We need to see the strangulation of Sarajevo ceased," said the State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry.
"We need to see food, electricity, water, medicine and necessary relief obtained by the citizens of not only Sarajevo, but other safe areas in the region, and those are precisely the criteria we'll be watching very, very closely and carefully, as we have been, in the coming days.

Dollar Drops Against Yen, Trading Near 100 in Tokyo
The dollar continued to sink against the Japanese yen in trading here today, coming extremely close to reaching 100 yen to the dollar before rebounding in the late afternoon.
Indeed, at one point today the dollar hit 100.20 yen, another record low.
But by late afternoon, the dollar had surged to 101.35, which was a tenth of a yen above its Tokyo close on Monday.
The dollar finished at 101.62 yen in New York on Monday, down 0.23 yen.

The choice is stark: reactivate a nuclear power plant that has been shut down for four years for safety reasons, or drain water from a lake for hydroelectric power and risk losing the lake.
Just about everyone agrees that the Government has to act, or thousands of Armenians are going to perish.
They also agree that whatever action the Government takes, thousands may still perish.

The Trials of Setting Up A New Home Computer
A COMPUTER is not a joy forever.
Nearly three years ago, the home office cheered the triumphant appearance of a 33-megahertz 386, which outran the resident 16-megahertz 286 at a pace that seemed unbeatable.
But, then, the four-minute mile was also once a, well, milestone.

Blue Cross Tries to Push Network Care
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield has notified patient groups that it is prepared to seek increases of as much as 35 percent for 125,000 customers with the broadest health insurance coverage -- or may cancel their policies altogether -- in an effort to push them into health-care networks that limit their choices of doctors and tightly control medical costs.
The action, which could take effect early next year, is the first step in an ambitious plan by Empire, the state's largest health insurer, to cut costs by moving as many as half of its 7.6 million customers into "managed care" plans.


Review/Fashion; Swimsuits That Aren't Just for the Beach
Back in the days when the bikini dominated the beaches and tanning was the prevalent sand sport, the more flesh the swimsuit exposed, the better.
Times change.
The one-piece suit, thanks to flesh-clinging stretch nylon no thicker than an onion skin, has caught up with the bikini.
It can be long enough to cover the hips; it can have cap sleeves or a halter neckline.
Baring all is not top fashion.
Even the bikini is no longer a thing of triangles held together with string.
The bra provides adequate cover, even a bit of control when wired.
The bottom is not as low at the waist or as high at the hips as before, and a small skirt or a scarf often ties over it.


CHRONICLE
In Denver last Friday, during his third visit to the United States, POPE PAUL II stepped out of the conservative black shoes he and his predecessors have traditionally worn and slipped into a pair of white tennis shoes.
They gave him a firmer foothold when he walked through Camp St.
Milo in Cherry Creek State Park and he also wore them during Sunday's lengthy religious ceremonies.
But that's not the whole story, said JACKIE SAGE, the manager of an Athlete's Foot store in Denver, where a papal delegation showed up Thursday to buy the shoes.
After rejecting two brands -- Ms.
Sage wouldn't name them but said she suspected they might have supported issues opposed by Roman Catholic doctrine -- the delegation settled on a pair of American-made K-Swiss shoes, which were size 10 1/2 and cost $49.88.


Women's Work -- and Men's, Too
This month the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires employers with 50 or more workers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family medical emergencies, childbirth and adoption, finally became law.
The act was controversial and remains so.
A common misgiving was expressed the other day by Tama Starr, president of Artkraft Strauss in New York City.
"If you're an employer," Ms.
Starr told a Times reporter, "you will look at a young woman and say, 'Can we really entrust her to do crucial responsibilities that no one else can do because she's going to take three months off?' "


In Katydids, Male Rivalry Poses as Synchrony
AMONG the natural world's most spectacular sound and light shows are synchronized courtships, displays in which groups of males all croak or flash simultaneously to show their romantic intent to females.
In Asia, a group of male fireflies can blink on and off together in the branches of a tree like long, perfect strings of Christmas lights.
All around the world, male frogs, katydids, crickets and cicadas fill the night with the deafening alignment of their love songs.
So impressively precise is the orchestration of these courting males that biologists have long assumed that they must be cooperating to keep their signals closely matched.
But in a new study published in this week's issue of Nature, researchers say they have found that the males, rather than cooperating, are actually competing fiercely.


Viacom Interactive TV Unit
In a move to coordinate its efforts in interactive cable television, Viacom International Inc. named Thomas E. Dooley president of its interactive television division yesterday.

Some of Viacom's cable networks are also involved in interactive projects.


Special Treatment? Game Owes It to Ryan
Mike Stanley was 3 years old when Nolan Ryan first pitched in the major leagues.
When Ryan was into his third decade of pitching in the major leagues, Stanley was one of his catchers with the Texas Rangers.
Stanley was asked yesterday, the beginning of Ryan's last visit to New York as a player, if catching Nolan was different from catching any other pitcher.
"You're catching a legend, a Hall of Famer, someone who is one of the best pitchers the game has ever seen," Stanley said.
"Other than that, it wasn't any different than catching anyone else."


McCall Dismisses 4 Aides for New Deputy

Request From Sheik For Custody Release Is Denied by Court
A Federal judge yesterday denied Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman's request to be released from Federal custody, saying it was reasonable to regard the Egyptian cleric as a "danger to the security of the United States."

Abdel Rahman could be forced to leave the country.


Azinger Arrives At Top
Major championships, for all their importance to the game, are often inconclusive once the cheering stops.
But the 75th PGA Championship at Inverness, besides adding to the hard-luck saga of Greg Norman, seems destined to be remembered as Paul Azinger's launching pad into the elite.
With a series of quick thrusts at crucial moments, the 33-year-old Azinger conquered his own doubts and the two top-ranked players in the world -- Norman and third-place finisher Nick Faldo -- on Sunday to win his first major championship.

They're the ones wearing the wrong shoes and carrying the wrong tents.
The New Yorkers.


Amid Maze of Signals, Bats' Brains Can Form Precise Images of Prey
PEOPLE who grew up before television had little difficulty "seeing" the Green Hornet, the Lone Ranger or Baby Snooks on radio.
But can insect-eating bats, relying solely on sound signals to find food, form comparable mental images of their prey to help them distinguish a delicious moth, say, from the leaves it flutters through?
Neurobiologists at Brown University have found that a bat can in fact form quite precise acoustical images of the many objects in its aerial environment.
In the so-called tonotopic area of the auditory cortex, the part of the brain that processes sound signals, the scientists have pinpointed nerve cells that enable the bat to discern the exact size, shape and movements of insects in its path.


Talking With the P.L.O.; Israelis Are Approaching, Albeit Gingerly, Direct Contacts With Group They Despise
At the opening conference of the Middle East peace negotiations in Madrid two years ago, the Israeli delegation was led by Yitzhak Shamir, then the Prime Minister, who has only contempt for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Yet the moment he took his seat at the large conference table, he was in effect talking with the P.L.O.
Mr.
Shamir, former leader of the Likud Party, would deny that was the case.
One demand he made before going to Madrid was that Israel would talk only with Palestinians from the occupied territories -- no one from "outside," and certainly no formal member of the P.L.O., a group Mr.
Shamir and many other Israelis regard as nothing but a band of terrorists intent on Israel's destruction.

Lead in Greenland Is Traced To the U.S.
LEAD deposits, which accumulated in soil and snow during the 1960's and 70's, were primarily the result of leaded gasoline emissions originating in the United States.
In the 20 years that the Clean Air Act has mandated unleaded gas use in the United States, the lead accumulation worldwide has diminished significantly.
A study published recently in the journal Nature shows that airborne leaded gas emissions from the United States were the leading contributor to the high concentration of lead in the snow in Greenland.
The new study is a result of the continued research led by Dr.
Charles Boutron, an expert on the impact of heavy metals on the environment at the Laboratory of Glaciology and Environmental Geophysics of the National Center for Scientific Research in St.-Martin-d'Heres, France.
A study by Dr.
Boutron published in Nature in 1991 showed that lead levels in arctic snow were declining.

The gross profit margin declined to 23.3 percent of sales, from 23.9 percent.


School Asbestos More Extensive Than Expected
The emergency inspection of the New York City public school system has found at least some exposed asbestos in every school checked so far, indicating the scandal over the school testing program is more severe and costly than officials initially expected.
Inspectors scouring the city's 1,069 public schools have received results from 25 schools showing asbestos contamination in each one, while officials have also determined that 69 other schools already undergoing renovations also have asbestos hazards -- for a total of 94, officials heading the inspection said yesterday.

CLINTON MAY LET U.S. TROOPS SERVE UNDER U.N. CHIEFS
Shifting away from the longstanding tradition of American commanders for American troops, the Clinton Administration is considering an expanded role in United Nations peacekeeping operations that would include having Americans serve under foreign commanders on a regular basis.
Administration officials say a presidential policy directive to allow for such an expansion of the American role has been drafted and is expected to be signed by President Clinton next month.
It has the backing of the Defense Department, the State Department, the National Security Council and Madeleine K. Albright, delegate to the United Nations.


Man's Nemesis: Dotted Line on Map; Trying to Rebuild, Bronx Store Owner Faces Phantom Road
Among the biggest fears for any businessman hit by catastrophe is that he'll wind up on the street.
But for one Bronx landlord trying to rebuild after a devastating fire, the problem is that the street is on him.
Lazar (Bernie) Berkovits, the owner of the largest property destroyed in a five-alarm fire 13 months ago on East Tremont Avenue says that although he is ready to build a bigger store on the site, the city says he can't just yet.
A dotted line planners drew on a map half a century ago has East Tremont Avenue cutting through his property, meaning that even rebuilding on the site requires a ruling from the city.
And $8,000 in legal fees. 'This Is Impossible'
The city's stance vexes Mr.
Berkovits, considering that to help him with his expansion plans the city sold him a small parcel next to his original lot without, he said, telling him that the street is plotted through the land.
Even more perplexing to him, and most people, is that East Tremont Avenue is where it has always been -- on the street in front of Mr.
Berkovits's land.


Budapest Journal; Gentrifiers March On, To the Danube's Banks
Nearly four years after the Communist system collapsed, a sharp debate is developing in this grand city of broad boulevards and opulent buildings astride the Danube: how the metropolis, still grand but faded, should be restored and renewed.
The debate is similar to those that have long absorbed New York, London and Paris.
But what used to be an almost entirely Western phenomenon, urban gentrification, has come to the fore here as city leaders and citizens alike confront decades of Communist neglect of an eclectic architectural heritage that ranges from a graceful Neo-Gothic Parliament building to fanciful Art Nouveau bathhouses.


Polishing A Quirky Setting for Letterman
Like an ancient apparition around a modern veneer, the ornate Gothic shell inside the Ed Sullivan Theater has already given "Late Show" an eccentric personality, even without David Letterman onstage.
Not every modern television studio -- probably not any modern television studio, come to think of it -- has four-story-high, apse-like recesses flanking the main stage, with luxuriant plasterwork flora and 18-foot window bays topped by quatrefoil traceries filled with cobalt and ruby and emerald stained glass.


Old Ball Game Has New Demands for a Town
This is a story about how the warm and fuzzy mythology of baseball can collide with the cold and calculating business of baseball.
It's about a community whose love affair with a team may soon end because its aging stadium is no longer good enough for the people who pay the salaries.
Remarkably, this story is not about George Steinbrenner.


Bridge
Winning a team event in two consecutive years is always a rare event.
It is particularly rare in the Greater New York Bridge Association's Harter Cup, for players below life master rank, because winning players often become life masters en route and become disqualified for the following season.
But the 1992 Harter winners repeated that success on Monday.
Playing the final at the Manhattan Club, at 27 West 72d Street, Robert Stayman, Bonnie Gellas, Stan Sterenberg and Laura Schisgall, all of Manhattan, won by 33 imps against a group led by Ettore Bianchi of Manhattan.
The diagramed deal contributed largely to the victory.


Pollution Debate at Vast Russian Lake
Less than 100 yards from where the Baikalsk paper mill flushes its industrial waste into Lake Baikal, Raisa M. Zaikova, the plant's chief environmental engineer, dipped a tin cup into the lake and boasted, "Our backwash is cleaner than what comes from Moscow taps."
For 10 years Miss Zaikova has been sipping from this spot, a sunny strip of shore where children swim beneath the plant's three smokestacks, to prove the mill is not poisoning the world's biggest and deepest lake.


Rangers Take Any Victory, No Matter Its Looks
Some years back, Doug Rader, then the manager of the Texas Rangers, coined a phrase: "winning ugly."
That term referred not to his team, but to the 1983 Chicago White Sox, the team the frustrated Rangers chased all the way to the finish line.


Ottey Gets Reprieve for Race
Merlene Ottey finally scored a victory of sorts today, but Gail Devers still won the race.
In Monday night's 100-meter final for women in the world outdoor track and field championships, the judges ruled that Devers, the 26-year-old American, had beaten Ottey, the 33-year-old Jamaican, by an eyelash.
Jamaican officials protested, saying that Ottey had won or had at least tied for first.


In Bosnia, Air Strikes Alone Won't Do the Job; Help for the Children
To the Editor:
Thank you for "Bosnia Girl's Life Hangs on Procedural Tangle" (news article, Aug. 9).
We have been trying to evacuate wounded Bosnian children since last April without success.
In June, I attempted to enter Bosnia to determine why wounded children were not being evacuated, but United Nations officials in Split prevented me from doing so.
Veterans for Peace, an organization of United States military veterans with official United Nations nongovernmental organization status, has received commitments from hospital executives around the country to provide free beds, services and medical treatment for more than 100 wounded Bosnian children.
Thus far United Nations agencies have refused to assist our efforts, even though United Nations planes delivering aid to Sarajevo daily leave empty.

A Challenge for Kids -- and the Military
America's military forces are redefining themselves in the post-cold-war era.
At the same time, many poor and minority youths aren't succeeding in school or in life.
That's why a new National Guard initiative seems like a good idea for the military, for troubled youths and for society.
The initiative is the Youth Corps ChalleNGe program (the capitalized NG is for National Guard), which enlists current and former military personnel to teach and counsel young men and women who have dropped out of school.
The teaching is aimed at preparing them to obtain a high school equivalency diploma.
The counseling is to help them cope with life.


Stewart Granger, 80, Star in Swashbuckler Roles
Stewart Granger, the handsome leading man in more than 60 films, including adventure tales like "King Solomon's Mines" and "The Last Safari," died on Monday at St.
John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif.
He was 80 and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
The cause was prostate and bone cancer, said his agent, Sid Craig.

Frustrated Mets Send Young To Minors
A 27-game losing streak got Anthony Young on the "Tonight Show." A two-game losing streak got him to Norfolk.
Carrying a 1-15 record and a 4.23 earned run average, the Mets' right-hander was tapped on the shoulder this afternoon, sent to Manager Dallas Green's office for 45 minutes and told to pack for the minor leagues.
He will start for the Class AAA Norfolk Tides on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio; he is not guaranteed a return trip to the Mets this season.

METRO DIGEST
FIELD OF DREAMS, REALITY OF MONEY
Auburn, N.Y., is part of a story about how the warm and fuzzy mythology of baseball can collide with the cold and calculating business of baseball.
It's about a community whose love affair with a team may soon end because its stadium isn't good enough for the guys who pay the salaries.

NEW YORK CITY  A GRIM MERCY FOR KIDNAP VICTIM
Eventually, there was one touch of marginal mercy when the kidnappers unshackled the legs and waist of Harvey Weinstein as they buried him in the darkness of a pit six feet underground.
But they kept his hands tightly lashed to a pinion in the pit, according to the police, and they made no other concessions across the 12 days that the 68-year-old millionaire was grotesquely imprisoned.

For Homeless, A Last Haven Is Demolished
Bulldozers yesterday plowed through one of the oldest and last shantytowns in New York City, crushing into bits of plywood and muddy rags one of the most visible symbols of homelessness in Manhattan.
Officials said the encampment at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge -- known for an 18-foot teepee that towered over wood and tar paper shacks -- had become a fire hazard and was increasingly plagued with drugs.
The site, a knoll called the Hill, was one of many semi-permanent communities created by homeless people in the 1980's in spots from Columbus Circle to Tompkins Square Park to the United Nations.


In Bosnia, Air Strikes Alone Won't Do the Job; Myths and Murders
To the Editor:
Re Joseph Brodsky's "Blood, Lies and the Trigger of History" (Op-Ed, Aug. 4): Yes, let's get history out of the Balkan debate, as Mr.
Brodsky suggests.
He's right to argue that in the former Yugoslavia the myth makers are also the murderers.
But let's not forget whose myths have caused the most murders.
When the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, wanted to shut down the autonomous region of Kosovo, he harked back to Serbia's defeat there in 1389.
When the Slovenes and Croats, fearing for their own status in a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, chose independence, Mr.
Milosevic's regime resurrected the ghosts of World War II collaboration with the Nazis.


Reds Trade Milligan to the Indians
The Cincinnati Reds traded first baseman-outfielder RANDY MILLIGAN to the Cleveland Indians yesterday for a player to be named.
Milligan, 31, hit .274 with 6 homers and 29 runs batted in in 83 games for the Reds this season.
He spent four years with the Baltimore Orioles before signing with Cincinnati as a free agent in February.
The Reds' general manager, JIM BOWDEN, said that Milligan had requested a trade more than a month ago.


In the Hurricane Belt, A New, Wary Respect
A year after Hurricane Andrew's record-setting $25 billion rampage, coastal areas along the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf Coast are entering the heart of the hurricane season with a new respect for nature's wrath, but with only modest changes intended to lessen the effect of the next killer storm.
After a 30-year period in which the value of property in hurricane-prone areas has risen by at least 600 percent, and at a time when many experts say the nation is moving from a period of unusually mild hurricane activity to one in which severe hurricanes are likely to be far more common, Hurricane Andrew has focused attention on such storms like nothing in decades.

Gap Ads to Feature Celebrities in Khakis
For those curious about, or annoyed at, a recent spate of "teaser" ads about khaki clothing, Gap Inc. is revealing what the fuss is about: a baker's dozen of celebrated people -- Chet Baker, the jazz musician, is one -- wearing khaki in archival photographs.
In issues this week of three national magazines, the apparel retailer begins a six-week campaign, created in-house, that seeks to sell its casual khaki pants to a broader, somewhat older audience.
A "Gap khakis" logo appears in the bottom right hand corner of the series of black-and-white photographs, which are accompanied by a page of text likening the Gap's slacks to those worn by "legendary writers, actors, adventurers with style."

Suffolk Legislature Passes a Bill To Limit Elected Officials' Terms
The Suffolk County Legislature today passed a bill that would set up a referendum to make Suffolk the first county in the state to limit the terms of its elected officials.
The bill, approved by a vote of 14 to 3, would limit all elected county officials to 12 years in office.
Legislators would be limited to six two-year terms, while the county executive, the district attorney, the treasurer and the county clerk, would be limited to three four-year terms.


Protecting Water From the Birds
New York City has to cover two of its reservoirs to prevent contamination.
Sounds pretty straightforward.
But this is New York, where the public has become so accustomed to government bungling that skepticism greets every decision.
In this case, the choice is between flexible plastic covers and fixed concrete covers for the Hillview and Jerome Reservoirs.
The plastic membrane would cost about $4 a square foot, compared with $45 for concrete, not counting an unspecified additional amount if the city also builds a reflecting pool atop one of the concrete platforms.


An Uneven Corporate Tax Bite
No two industrial giants fit identically into the folds of the new tax law, any more than two portly accountants would share the same custom-made suit.
The profitable will feel the pinch one way, the unprofitable another; manufacturers and service industries will enjoy different tax breaks.
A company might find itself heavily affected by international tax provisions, by the arcana of financial accounting rules, by increased fuel taxes or by the loss of deductions for the lobbying expenses with which corporations defend their interests whenever their tax burden is at stake.


In Bosnia, Air Strikes Alone Won't Do the Job; Join the Ground Forces

I fully support this as a last-resort option.


An agency shift for Tanqueray marks a growing restlessness in an intensely competitive category.
THE Schieffelin &amp; Somerset Company yesterday ended a 26-year relationship with Smith/Greenland Inc., moving its remaining spirits brands there to two other shops.
Schieffelin, a subsidiary of Guinness P.L.C., named Deutsch/Dworin Inc. in New York to handle the Tanqueray gin and Tanqueray Sterling vodka brands, with combined billings estimated at $12 million to $15 million.
And Avrett, Free &amp; Ginsberg in New York, which was awarded Johnnie Walker Red Scotch whisky from Smith/Greenland in late 1991, received the rest of the House of Walker line, with combined billings estimated at more than $7 million.

Boggs Leads It Off and Shows the Way Home
No one watches Wade Boggs collect a base on balls and opines that you might as well score it a double.
Wade Boggs is not that kind of leadoff hitter.
But that does not mean that Wade Boggs isn't a leadoff hitter.
He is.
And quite a good one at that.
Just ask the Yankees.
For years, they saw signs of what he brought to that position when Boston would occasionally insert him at the top of the batting order.
Nowadays, the Yankees get to see it on a more up-close and personal basis, and by all indications are enjoying it all the more.

Deal May Quicken Pace Of Wireless Evolution
When the chairmen of A.T.&amp; T. and McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. were asked on Monday what the $12.6 billion combination of their companies meant for the average consumer, the tongues of the normally articulate men seemed to twist from information overload.
There are thousands of potential applications for the typical customer, Robert E. Allen of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said.
"I'm not sure I can give you just two to excite you," he added.
And Craig O. McCaw puzzled perhaps even the telecommunications cognoscenti by saying, "We want to build a hierarchy of the least intrusive technologies."

Officials Dismiss Some Asbestos Inspectors in Schools
The officials conducting the emergency reinspection of New York City's school system for asbestos said yesterday that they had dismissed a number of inspectors, significantly slowing the effort to examine each of the city's 1,069 schools for asbestos hazards.
The dismissals, which took place on Saturday morning, stemmed from questions about the inspectors' training and experience, the officials said, declining to provide more details.
One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were dismissed because they received their training from a subsidiary of the consultant now under investigation for mismanaging the schools asbestos program.

Frenchman Is Favored for Europe Bank
Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the French central bank and a former head of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to be elected this week as the new president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, officials of the lending institution said today.
Mr. de Larosiere has been the leading candidate for the job at the European Bank, which was established two years ago to finance private enterprise in former Soviet bloc nations.
He had faced opposition from two other candidates, Leszek Balcerowicz, a former Polish Finance Minister and an architect of his country's shift to a market economy, and Giuliano Amato, a former Italian Prime Minister.
Rivals Withdraw
With support having coalesced around Mr. de Larosiere, Mr.
Amato withdrew on Monday.
Mr.
Balcerowicz, who had hoped to be the compromise choice if the Western European nations split between Mr. de Larosiere and Mr.
Amato, pulled out of the race today.
The directors of the bank are to vote no later than Wednesday, and an announcement of the result is expected Thursday.

In Bosnia, Air Strikes Alone Won't Do the Job; War Crimes and Law
To the Editor:
"Foot-Dragging on War Crimes" (editorial, Aug. 5) hits the mark by calling for the war crimes tribunal in the former Yugoslavia to pick up its pace.
As you observe, through the tribunal, "the world can still deploy the nonlethal but devastating weapons of truth, law and shame." However, to become a proponent of truth, trials must be conducted according to the strictest standards of due process.
This means that defendants should not be tried in absentia.
Criminal trials held without the presence of the accused would deprive alleged war criminals of the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers.
Some argue that defendants waive these rights when they fail to appear for trial.
This argument, however, should be rejected in light of the importance of setting a standard of scrupulous compliance with the rule of law.


Mariners' Martinez on Disabled List Again
For the third time this season, the Seattle Mariners have put EDGAR MARTINEZ, the 1992 American League batting champion, on the 15-day disabled list because of an ailing left hamstring.

Review/Rap; A Change in the Image for a Change in the Voice
Puberty is hard on everyone.
And it's especially tough on Chris Kelly and Chris Smith, the two 14-year-old rappers who make up Kris Kross.
Their voices have changed, from boyish piping to teen-aged nasality, since the group made its first album, "Totally Krossed Out" (Ruffhouse/Columbia).
And with the changed voices, the duo has changed its act, trying to grow up on its new album, "Da Bomb" (Ruffhouse/Columbia).
At the Westbury Music Fair on Monday night, Kris Kross made a highly professional effort to reposition itself from from teen novelty act to assertive young men.
"Totally Krossed Out" sold four million copies, cannily presenting the rappers as unsmiling "Li'l Boys in Da Hood" (in one song title) and packaging them with their own fashion trend: baggy jeans and oversize shirts, both worn backward.
They rapped about missing the school bus and sneaking into clubs, part tough, part cute.
They called themselves Mack Daddy (Mr. Kelly) and Daddy Mack (Mr. Smith), although "mack" can mean pimp.
And with catchy hooks like the one that squealed through "Jump," a single that sold two million copies, no one minded that the material was written by the pair's 19-year-old producer, Jermaine Dupri.

Big Award Is Ordered For Hughes
The United States Court of Claims has ruled that the Government owes the Hughes Aircraft Company royalties that could total well over $1 billion in a dispute involving satellite-technology patents.
The decision is one of the last steps in a lengthy legal battle between Hughes and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration over technology that made it possible to launch geosynchronous satellites, which appear to hover over a spot on the surface of the earth.
What remains is determining how much the Government owes Hughes. 84 Satellites Involved
The Court of Claims is a Federal court that deals with civil claims against the Government.
In a ruling issued late Monday, Judge James Turner said the Government would have to pay royalties and back interest on 84 satellites.
These satellites, many of which are no longer in use, had a total value of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, and Hughes is seeking a 15 percent annual royalty on each, as well as more than a billion dollars in back interest.


Easy Does It
Turn to fiction -- TV commercials and print ads -- and ours is a country of tennis players, joggers, skiers and weight lifters.
Turn to fact, however, and ours is a nation of people who seldom get off their duffs.
That's why the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with assorted doctors and exercise experts, faced up and recently issued a new prescription for physical fitness.
If you won't run, walk.
Or rake leaves.
Or samba.
Or something.
Being told to get out there and use those muscles, it seems, has made millions of Americans take to their couches instead.
Who can blame them?
On the whole it is sweeter by far to contemplate athletes than it is to emulate them.
Furthermore it is only human to resist orders, especially if they involve lifting iron or breaking a sweat.
But if one is told that taking the staircase rather than the elevator adds up to a decent daily workout, then one might act accordingly.


One Swat Foils the Yankees' Bid for a Sweep
Everything was progressing so smoothly for the Yankees.
They already had one victory behind them, and Melido Perez was cruising toward another in the second game of the doubleheader.
They were dreaming of a sweep over the Rangers and of regaining a share of first place with Toronto.
But in the sixth inning last night, Juan Gonzalez did what Juan Gonzalez does.
Gonzalez unloaded a monstrous three-run homer off Perez that spoiled his shutout attempt and ruined the chance for a sweep as the Rangers snatched a 3-2 victory.
Don Mattingly clubbed a three-run homer, and Bernie Williams had four hits and a three-run homer to help a sub-par Jimmy Key and the Yankees finally defeat nemesis Kevin Brown and Texas, 11-4, in the opener.

"No one here can remember the last time the Hudson seriously overflowed its banks," writes Michael T. Kaufman (About New York, Aug. 7).

Personal Health
AN enormous amount of attention is being paid to the amount of calcium consumed by middle-aged and older women, many of whom will develop the weakened bones of osteoporosis and suffer debilitating, costly and sometimes fatal fractures as a result.
But mounting evidence indicates that this late-in-life concern about bones is like shutting the barn door after the horse has escaped.
For it turns out that many, if not most, women enter adulthood with their bones already on the losing side because they failed to consume enough calcium during adolescence, when bone development reaches its biological peak.
And if calcium intake by today's youth is any indication, the current "epidemic" of osteoporosis is likely to reach gargantuan proportions in the decades to come, when the girls who grew up on diet soda pass through menopause.

Review/Film; After the Riot, at Ground Zero
"112th and Central: Through the Eyes of the Children," a documentary about the effects of the 1992 Los Angeles riots on the lives of the young people who lived through them, has one strikingly unusual feature.
When the film-making team of Jim Chambers, Hal Hisey and Vondie Curtis-Hall undertook the project, they invited their subjects to be their creative collaborators.
They equipped 25 mostly black and Hispanic students from the Los Angeles Achievement Center, a youth guidance program in South-Central Los Angeles, with super-8 video cameras and had them interview one another and their friends and families.
The result is a documentary film that is crude, and occasionally rambling and inarticulate, but one that captures a more intimate sense of community than could probably have been conveyed through more conventionally polished methods.


Lies and Rigged 'Star Wars' Test Fooled the Kremlin, and Congress
Officials in the "Star Wars" project rigged a crucial 1984 test and faked other data in a program of deception that misled Congress as well as the intended target, the Soviet Union, four former Reagan Administration officials said.
The deception program was designed to feed the Kremlin half-truths and lies about the project, the former Administration officials said.
It helped persuade the Soviets to spend tens of billions of dollars to counter the American effort to develop a space-based shield against nuclear attack proposed by former President Ronald Reagan in 1983, they said.


Some Production Soon, Warner-Lambert Hopes
Officials of the Warner-Lambert Company said yesterday that the drug manufacturer might be able to resume production of some nonprescription products within days, in the wake of its agreement with the Food and Drug Administration to suspend most manufacturing.
But some of the company's lower-volume prescription drugs may be out of production for months, executives said.
On Monday, Warner-Lambert reached a consent decree with the F.D.A. to halt production of drugs, except for medically necessary ones, until the company clears up a broad range of practices in its plants and laboratories that are not in compliance with Federal regulations.

Teachers in U.S. Trail Those Elsewhere in Pay
American schoolteachers make less money, receive less training and spend less time preparing for their classes than their peers in many other countries, according to a new study by the American Federation of Teachers.
The study, which combines reports from other countries and original research in the United States, paints a portrait of a profession under stress.
The A.F.T., the nation's second largest teachers' union, asserted that despite improvements in teacher salaries, training and preparation in many states, failure to do more might discourage bright young people from starting teaching careers.


Campus Journal; Back to School (Wearing Galoshes)
With a week to go before classes start, flood-weary officials at the University of Iowa have been keeping an eye on the skies.

At Hancher Auditorium, the marketing director, Judy Hurtig, and the rest of the staff began another workday today in the lobby.
Flooding in early July knocked out the ventilation system of the 20-year-old building, and the staff, seeking fresh air, relocated to the entrance.

There was a time in the not-so-distant past when young Republicans easily roamed the halls of the White House, confident in their place at the center of power.
But now, while their Democratic counterparts occupy prime positions in the new Administration -- the personal aide to President Clinton, for example, is a mere 24 years old -- Republicans in their 20's are toiling in obscurity, struggling to get their own businesses started or scrambling for jobs.

To my taste, lamb is one of the best meats for grilling.
It absorbs the flavor of a marinade yet retains its character when grilled.
The smoky tinge of charcoal always enhances but never overpowers lamb.
To get the best results, it is important to know which cuts of lamb are best for grilling or broiling.
Meat from the rib cut, which is the most tender and most expensive, can be buttery and delicious.
But this extravagance is not necessary.
The loin yields excellent kebabs, as does the leg.
Both are tender and succulent if cooked properly.


DOLE IS CAUTIOUS ON HEALTH PLANS
In a speech that was more conciliatory than confrontational, Senator Bob Dole said today that Republicans wanted to cooperate with the Clinton Administration on health care.
But he warned that he had "genuine concerns" about the President's proposal, particularly one that would require employers to provide health insurance for workers.
Addressing the National Governors' Association from the same stage where Mr.
Clinton outlined the basics of his health plan a day earlier, Mr.
Dole, the Senate Republican leader, warned the President not to "get set in concrete" with his plan.


Political Memo; The Governors' Untouchable Subject
Talk about touchy.
Ask Republican governors about health care or welfare or Federal mandates and they won't stop talking.
Ask them about their ambitions for the White House and there is dead silence.
Then they back away.
That's just what happened the other day here at a news conference by Republicans attending the summer meeting of the National Governors' Association.
The question-and-answer session was dominated by four Republican Governors who are widely thought to harbor visions of national office: Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, Pete Wilson of California, William F. Weld of Massachusetts and John Engler of Michigan.


Union May Be Attaching Strings to Playoff Plans
The owners' no-lockout pledge, announced publicly last week and delivered in writing to the union yesterday, was designed to secure labor peace in baseball.
But union officials are expected to announce this week a position on the expanded playoffs proposed for next year that will add another element of potential dispute between the two sides.
Although the players don't flatly oppose the added round of playoffs, they are apparently prepared to agree to it only if three divisions in each league are created at the same time.
The owners themselves eventually want to realign the clubs into three divisions, but not before 1995.


Citicorp's Executive Carrot: Stock Options With a Twist
Citicorp has granted its top executives stock options that could be worth as much as $200 million if the price of Citicorp stock doubles over the next five years.
The program is unusual in that the options are worthless until the bank's stock, which now trades at about $32, reaches $50, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Agassi Easily Eliminates a Big Admirer
It is a good thing that Kelly Evernden enjoys playing against Andre Agassi.
"Andre is one of the few colorful players left in the game and I have a ball playing him," Evernden said in advance of his first-round match against Agassi today in the $1 million Volvo International.


Ambiguous Salvo on Health Care
With the budget battle won, President Clinton launched an even more bruising battle this week over health care.
Addressing the nation's governors, Mr.
Clinton was, well, vintage Clinton: reassuring to everyone and satisfying to no one.
He promised bipartisanship, flexibility, no new taxes and universal coverage.
All that sounds terrific.
But how these pieces would fit together remains as much a mystery today as it was when he first appointed Hillary to figure it all out.


Real Estate
A FLAGGING urban redevelopment project here, promoted as the state's largest single real estate undertaking when it was announced in 1986, has received a much needed lift from a lending giant that for years had only a limited presence in the state.
The Beneficial Corporation, whose headquarters are now in a suburban Wilmington office park, in June signed a lease with an option to buy on a long-vacant office building in Wilmington's downtown Christina Gateway Financial District near the Christina River.


In Bosnia, Air Strikes Alone Won't Do the Job; No Break in Arms Flow
To the Editor:
The rhetoric surrounding imminent American military intervention against Bosnian Serbs shows that both the Clinton Administration and the Bosnian Muslim Government of President Alija Izetbegovic are much more concerned with maintaining the arms flow into Sarajevo than with relieving its population's suffering.
For the last 15 months we have been lied to.
We were told that all the supply routes into Sarajevo were held by the Serbs and that they were responsible for preventing humanitarian convoys from reaching the besieged city.
We now learn that all this time the Bosnian Muslim Government had a supply route over Mount Igman, which it used to bring in arms and ammunition for the soldiers, not food and medicine for civilians.


Ross Roy to Decide On Chief's Successor
The board of directors of the Ross Roy Group in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is expected to meet shortly to name a successor to Glen W. Fortinberry, the chairman and chief executive, who died yesterday at age 65.
The agency, in a statement, attributed the cause of death to a form of leukemia.
A likely successor to Mr.
Fortinberry, who formed Ross Roy in 1987, is Peter R. Mills, who earlier this month became the president and chief executive of its largest company, Ross Roy Inc.
Mr.
Mills joined Ross Roy in June from BBDO North America in Southfield, Mich., where he had been the president and chief operating officer.


Perrigo
Shares of the Perrigo Company jumped yesterday after the maker of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and private-brand personal care products posted record earnings for the fourth quarter and the year.
Perrigo's earnings have been helped by the growth in private brands, as price-conscious consumers increasingly turn to generics.


Vietnam Denies Making Offer
Vietnam denied Monday that it had offered Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown $700,000 to help get the American economic embargo lifted.
A foreign ministry spokesman said the accusation, reported in the Aug. 23 issue of U.S.
News &amp; World Report, was groundless and was aimed at hurting relations between the United States and Vietnam.
Mr.
Brown described the accusation by a Vietnamese business consultant in Florida as ridiculous.


Turner Buying New Line and Castle Rock Film Companies
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. agreed yesterday to buy both the New Line Cinema Corporation and Castle Rock Entertainment for a total of more than $667 million in stock and cash.
The acquisitions would give Turner a long-sought stake in the film production business, providing it with programming for its entertainment channels, Turner Network Television and the WTBS superstation.
The deals reflect the increasing vertical integration of the entertainment business as companies seek to control both production and distribution of entertainment programming.


Corrections
An entry in the Company Earnings listing in Business Day on July 28 about the second-quarter financial results of the Consolidated Edison Company of New York misstated the company's total revenues for the 1993 quarter and the comparable quarter in 1992.
Con Edison reported total revenues of $1,396,010,000 in this year's second quarter, compared with $1,280,110,000 a year earlier.
It was electric revenues, not total revenues, that amounted to $1,169,280,000 in the 1993 quarter, compared with $1,072,000,000 in the 1992 quarter.


Coin Toss Says ABC
A coin toss yesterday determined that ABC will televise the World Series in 1994, the first year of the new partnership among Major League Baseball, NBC and ABC.
NBC gets to televise the All- Star Game next July 12 and the two playoff series that will determine the league champions.


Metropolitan Diary
DEAR DIARY:
It was around 7 A.M., and the Lexington Avenue subway was so densely packed that I wasn't even able to read my newspaper.
Suddenly, a man next to me shouted, "You stepped on my toes!"
A second fellow replied: "I'm sorry, but I couldn't see. I'm sorry." The more he apologized, the more the first man continued with his vitriolics.
Finally, the accused man offered, "Sir, if it would help you, why don't you step on my toes?"


Devils Sign Two Players
The Devils yesterday secured the services of Brian Rolston and Mike Dunham, their two top prospects at center and goaltender, respectively, by signing them to multiyear contracts.
Details were not disclosed.
The 20-year-old Rolston is the Devils' best long-term hope to become the dominant center they have been missing so dearly since trading Kirk Muller to Montreal for Stephane Richer three years ago.


Jacob D. Beam, Envoy to Soviets At Start of Detente, Is Dead at 85
Jacob D. Beam, a diplomat who served in the United States' most sensitive foreign post in the 1970's as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, died on Monday at a hospital in Rockville, Md.
He was 85 and lived in Washington.
The cause was a stroke, his family said.


Wielding Incumbency, Dinkins Visits Hispanic Neighborhood
Trying to shore up support among Hispanic New Yorkers, Mayor David N. Dinkins forayed into the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Sunset Park in Brooklyn yesterday, picking up a significant endorsement, announcing the opening of two more "beacon" schools and reassuring supporters that he was still very much alive politically.
Mr.
Dinkins, looking relaxed and confident, put on a model demonstration of the advantages of incumbency -- even while peppered with questions about a new poll by The Daily News that showed he may be slipping behind his Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani.


Enrolled as Disabled but Ousted for Refusing Help
Justin Fruth of Indianapolis is a talented, well-traveled 17-year-old.
He has studied acting in England, gone mountain climbing in Washington and fly fishing in Colorado.
When he was 8 he biked 100 miles.
He was on his high school golf team, enjoys scuba diving, wind surfing and skiing and is a ballroom dance instructor.
He is also disabled.
In third grade he was diagnosed with a dyslexia-type learning disability.
His mother, a lawyer, hired a typing tutor to help him compensate for his writing problems.


Computer Maker's Net Hurts Stock
The Hewlett-Packard Company surprised Wall Street today with fiscal third-quarter earnings well below the consensus estimate, sending its share price plummeting.
While earnings, revenues and orders all grew in the quarter, profit margins hit a new low, a victim of price cuts, primarily in personal computers and printers.


Players United for Their Nation
The dormitory at the French national training center is dimly lit, but the atmosphere inside Room 114 is far from somber.
African music, percussive and buoyant, bursts from a portable stereo.
The new Zambian soccer team is resting between practices, and a muscular 21-year-old named Andrew Tembo is stretched out in his bunk and explaining how his life has been spared.


CHRONICLE
Does being angrily reprimanded by PRESIDENT CLINTON automatically entitle the offender to an apology and a fancy dinner later?
For WENDY SMITH, the White House aide in charge of the President's travel plans last week, it certainly did.
After she was scolded by Mr.
Clinton at Lambert-St.
Louis International Airport last Wednesday for misplacing his briefcase, her name was added to those of a small group of White House staff members who joined the President at an expensive French restaurant in Washington for a private dinner that evening.

Taylor Comes On As Mentor for Giants
There have been times during this training camp when Lawrence Taylor has looked around and noticed a lot of young faces on the defense.
Lots and lots of baby faces.
And some of these faces, naturally, look up to Taylor the way Ralph Macchio did to his martial arts teacher in the "Karate Kid" flicks.
To some of these guys, Taylor is a walking instruction manual on how to play linebacker.
Step 1: Listen to your football elders.
Marcus Buckley is the guy voted by some as most likely to succeed Taylor as the Giants' outside linebacker of the future.
He is one of those guys who has gone to Taylor for advice.
L.T., how do you shed a blocker if he is hooked your arm?
L.T., when they come out in this formation, what's going to happen?
L.T., why is the sky blue?


The Pop Life
Durante From 'Seattle'
The gravelly-voiced Jimmy Durante crooning on MTV?
It could happen, thanks to the popularity of the soundtrack from the romantic comedy hit "Sleepless in Seattle" (Epic Soundtrax), which this week strutted its way to No. 1 on Billboard's top albums chart.
It is the fastest-selling soundtrack since the huge success of "The Bodyguard" last year.
Heavy on nostalgia and not-so-familiar renditions of old standards, the album has produced a hit single, a remake of "When I Fall in Love" by Celine Dion and Clive Griffin.
Just released as the second single is Durante's version of "As Time Goes By."


I.B.M. Unit Narrow Review to 5 Agencies
The IBM PC Company has narrowed the review on its estimated $40 million American advertising account to five agencies including the incumbent, Lintas New York, advertising executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said yesterday.
The executives confirmed a report yesterday in the Advertising Age Daily Fax edition that the review was narrowed to Lintas; the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago; Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif., and New York; Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein in San Francisco, and Merkley Newman Harty in New York.
Trade publications have made Chiat/Day an early favorite in the review, which was announced unexpectedly in June.


Stein Is Scratched as N.H.L. Immortal
Gil Stein won't be entering the Hockey Hall of Fame after all.
Stein, who served last season as president of the National Hockey League, was elected to the Hall last March 30 amid allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors and by urging them to change the rules for selection.


U.S. ENVOY'S DEATH A 'CHANCE KILLING'
The Georgian authorities said today that they had arrested the man who shot the American diplomat Fred Woodruff this month, but described his death as a "chance killing."
Mr.
Woodruff, who according to unconfirmed American press reports was working for the C.I.A., was killed with a single bullet to the head on Aug. 8 while traveling in a car with the security chief for the Georgian leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.


With First Loss, Dell Shifts Gears on Pursuing Growth
The Dell Computer Corporation, one of the nation's fastest-growing companies, is easing up on the accelerator as it tries to regain profitability.
Michael S. Dell, the 28-year-old founder and chairman, said in an interview yesterday that after two years of pushing "full speed ahead" for growth, the new game plan would place financial liquidity and profits ahead of growth.
Product planning, procurement and incentives for the sales force will all be changed in line with the new approach, he said.

Life of Deng, By Daughter, Diverts China
It is not quite a recipe for a typical best seller: a doting biography of an old man by his daughter, with no sex, scandal or gore.
Still, since the old man is Deng Xiaoping, the world's most powerful 88-year-old, a fellow who almost single-handedly keeps expressions like "paramount leader" alive, the biography is causing a sensation even before it is published.


Germany's Anti-Terror Unit Buffs Its Image
As recently as last week, the fate of Germany's fabled anti-terrorist unit looked bleak.
A team of commandos from the unit had badly botched an arrest of two terrorists in June, and one member of the team had apparently killed one of the suspects in cold blood.
Calls for the unit's dissolution were growing in Bonn.
But today, the unit, known as GSG-9, is suddenly the toast of Germany, enjoying congratulations from politicians and a spate of gushing newspaper editorials.
What made the difference was hijacking of a K.L.M. airliner to Dusseldorf last weekend, and the unit's role in capturing the hijacker.


COMPANY NEWS
GENERAL ELECTRIC CO., Fairfield, Conn., said its plastics division had formed a unit in China, because of expected strong demand for thermoplastic resins.
GENERAL MOTORS CORP., Detroit, said its German unit, Adam Opel A.G., would get state, government and European Community cash for opening a new diesel engine production line in Rhineland Palatinate, Germany.


Nigeria General Makes His 5th Offer to Step Down
Nigeria's military ruler, Gen.
Ibrahim Baba ngida, offered today to end his eight-year reign and allow the formation of a new government.
"Following lengthy deliberations with my service chiefs, I offered as my personal sacrifice to voluntarily step aside as the President and commander in chief," he told members of the National Assembly in Abuja, the capital.
But he did not say when such a decision would be made.


Harkes Moves to New Team in England
JOHN HARKES, the first American soccer player to score a goal in an English cup final at Wembley, transferred from Sheffield Wednesday to Derby County yesterday after failing to come to contract terms.
Harkes, from Kearney, N.J., played for Sheffield Wednesday since 1990 and scored the team's only goal in a 2-1 loss to Arsenal in the League Cup final last season.
Arsenal went on to win the Football Association Cup final. (AP)


Democrats' Challenge in Senate Race Fades
The chances for a Brooklyn Democrat to win a State Senate seat have faded after a judge rejected efforts to disqualify the Republican candidate and the Governor declined to set an election date that might give an edge to the Democrat.
The special election in the 23d Senate District, which includes Bay Ridge and parts of Staten Island, is important because it could weaken the Republicans' 34-to-26 majority in the Senate.


Market Place; McCaw's impact on A.T.&amp; T.? A tale of 2 accounting methods.

Or maybe it should be known as the mystery of the immediate profits.

Space Station Work Gets Tight Controls
NASA headquarters consolidated its grip yesterday on the sprawling $20 billion effort to build an outpost in space for astronauts by singling out one company to be the prime contractor.
As part of the sweeping realignment, a new NASA center will be set up to oversee the venture, an old center will be closed, and the number of NASA space-station workers will drop by more than half, to 1,000 from 2,400.
The consolidation is part of President Clinton's plan to streamline the unwieldy station project, which has cost nearly $9 billion in nine years but still exists mainly on paper.
In February, he ordered NASA to produce a cheaper and less complex outpost than the $30 billion design then on the drawing board.


Full Speed Ahead on New York Electronic Tolls
To the Editor:
Over the last generation, the per capita car ownership in the New York City metropolitan area has more than doubled.
More people are driving to work, and more of them are driving to work alone, than ever before.
The installation of Electronic Toll and Traffic Management systems like the E-Z Pass system to be implemented by the New York State Thruway Authority can play a major role in reducing the congestion this auto-dependence has caused.


Rough Emotional Seas for Flood Victims
RECENT research on coping with disaster indicates that what may be the most emotionally troubling period for the victims of the Midwestern floods has yet to come.
Social psychologists believe that only after the flooding recedes will victims begin to experience the most serious symptoms of stress.
"The day the floods are no longer on the front page is the day it becomes a psychological risk for the people involved," said Dr.
James W. Pennebaker, a professor of psychology at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, who has studied the ways in which victims cope with disaster.
"Things will get difficult about three weeks after the waters recede."


The Military Is Not a Social Program
Our society is becoming ever more divided between people of thought and people of action.
Thus, it is not surprising that a wide array of politicians and commentators found the order by the Marine Corps Commandant that would have limited enlistments to unmarried recruits an object of easy derision.
Administration officials concede that Gen.
Carl E. Mundy Jr. possesses the authority to change Marine recruitment policy without their approval.
Nonetheless, the order was quickly rescinded, and he was subjected to a public dressing-down for having exercised his judgment without their concurrence.

JEFFREY ARCHER that's Lord Ar cher, actually is having the last laugh.
It's an understated laugh, really more of a long, drawn-out chuckle.

Testimony Conflicts At Military Hearing On Abuse by Fliers
In a calm voice, Lieut.
Paula Coughlin testified at a military hearing today about her searing experience going through the infamous Tailhook gantlet.
She pointed to a Marine captain sitting a few feet away in the austere courtroom and identified him as the most brazen of her molesters that Saturday night two years ago in the hallway of the Las Vegas Hilton.
Then, in an equally calm voice, the accused man, Capt.
Gregory Bonam, offered an equally harrowing story: the ordeal of an innocent man wrongly accused of a crime he did not commit.

McEnroe Allocating His Time
His last official match was in November, but John McEnroe just can't keep himself far away from tennis.

He is also dabbling in coaching again, with Boris Becker the beneficiary.


Pleasant Young Man Returns Home, Bitter
Just about everyone here remembers Andrew Wilson as an affable and handsome young man who went off to college a decade ago with a lot of promise.
But he changed; his life did not go well, and he came back to settle an imagined old score.
That, Greenwich residents say, is the nightmare that the family of John E. Peters has endured.

Review/Film; Satiric Look at the Tito Era
"Tito and Me" was shown as part of the 1993 New Directors/New Films Series.
Following are excerpts from Vincent Canby's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 23, 1993.
The film opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, Broadway at 63d Street.
As he remembers himself years later, the narrator of Goran Markovic's full-bodied, initially charming, farcical memoir, "Tito and Me," is a rather impossible little boy named Zoran (Dimitrie Vojnov), who is 10 and fat.
He's not just "rounded" as his grandmother says, but overweight in the big-bellied, multi-chinned way of children who consume too many sweets and, in Zoran's case, plaster.


Surviving 12-Day Abduction: A Marine's Foxhole, Revisited
Eventually, there was one touch of marginal mercy when the kidnappers unshackled the legs and waist of Harvey Weinstein as they buried him in the darkness of a pit six feet underground.
But they kept his hands tightly lashed to a pinion in the pit, according to the police, and made no other concessions across the 12 days that the 68-year-old millionaire was grotesquely imprisoned.
Down below the roar of the Henry Hudson Parkway traffic, the kidnapping victim remained hunched in the four-foot-wide pit across days and nights of captivity as his family and police detectives frantically sought his freedom in nightmarish negotiations over ransom drops that proved fruitless until his release on Monday.


Dow Climbs 7.83 to Reach Another High
In picking stocks yesterday, investors seemed to have pulled a line from Emma Lazarus's Statue of Liberty poem: "Give me your tired, your poor."
Drug stocks drew interest, with their prices at battered-down levels that analysts said might have been too good to pass up.
Some big-name stocks that have been weak recently, including Philip Morris and I.B.M., also rose.


Many Patients Unhappy With H.M.O.'s
A nationwide study of more than 17,000 patients has found widespread dissatisfaction with health maintenance organizations, adding fuel to a growing national debate over the merits of managed health care.
Patients were more likely to be satisfied with the explanations of their treatments from doctors working in their own offices or in small single-specialty groups than from H.M.O.'s, the researchers said.
The patients also said that independent doctors had showed more interest in their well-being.

In Bosnia, Air Strikes Alone Won't Do the Job
To the Editor:
While we are happy to see reports of President Clinton's willingness to use air strikes to break the siege of Sarajevo and his moves to protect the United Nations forces providing humanitarian aid to Bosnia, we are concerned that this policy will not sufficiently address the problem.
To pursue a policy that is limited only to retaliatory strikes on the aggressors in only the affected areas allows Bosnian Serb forces to determine the rules of engagement.

The Devils yesterday secured the services of Brian Rolston and Mike Dunham, their two top prospects at center and goaltender, respectively, by signing them to multiyear contracts.

The 20-year-old Rolston is the Devils' best long-term hope to become the dominant center they have been missing so dearly since trading Kirk Muller to Montreal for Stephane Richer three years ago.


Review/Television; New Breed of Hombre Populates the Old West
Ned Blessing is a western hero for the 90's.
In a few minutes, he proves himself to be no racist, sexist, ageist, ethnicist or speciesist.
Having subdued a rattlesnake, he tosses it back to its natural habitat, and he stands up for the speech impaired.
Moreover, the main bad guy in the two-hour premiere of CBS's "Ned Blessing: The Story of My Life and Times" is alleged to have killed his wife and abused his children.
Whether Bill Wittliff, the writer and executive producer, intends his upscale series to be a shoot-'em-up with an up-to-the-minute sensibility or a sendup of the latest television conventions, I cannot be sure.
But it's more fun if you think of it as a deadpan Deadwood gag.


CHRONICLE
Norway's environment minister, TORBJORN BERNTSEN, also has a quick temper, and it showed Monday when he used an insulting scatological expression and then said the British agriculture minister, JOHN GUMMER, was the biggest one "I have ever met in my life."
Mr.
Berntsen's remark, made at a political rally and widely reported in Norwegian newspapers, was another chapter in a blistering feud between the two governments: Norway says that acid rain from Britain is ruining the country, while the British are furious with Norway for its planned resumption of commercial whaling despite an international moratorium.

A coin toss yesterday determined that ABC will televise the World Series in 1994, the first year of the new partnership among Major League Baseball, NBC and ABC.

New Book Describes F.B.I. War Against Soviet Agents in the U.S.
A new book says the Federal Bureau of Investigation bugged cars belonging to Soviet intelligence officers, disguised its agents as store clerks to befriend K.G.B. officials and installed devices to detect Soviet vehicles at street crossings in the nation's capital during the agency's spy war against Moscow in the 1980's.
The book "The F.B.I.: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency," is being published on Thursday by Pocket Books.
It was written by Ronald Kessler, a former reporter for The Washington Post who has written several books on intelligence matters.

The cause was heart failure, the center said, adding that he had had cancer.


METROPOLITAN GOLF REPORT
The majority of the contenders for the Met Open, the stroke-play championship of the Metropolitan Golf Association, kept saying before the tournament that the Quaker Ridge course in Scarsdale, N.Y., was so difficult that par would be enough to win.
P.
J.
Cowan of Lake Success (L.I) Golf Club, who shot 59 in a noncompetitive round at Montauk (L.I.) Downs in 1991, was one of five players who proved everyone wrong -- at least after yesterday's opening round.


Sports of The Times; The Derby Is History To Sea Hero
In his first major league start, the kid was the king of the world.
He stood on the mound and fired the old hardball and nobody could solve him.
The next day's headlines said "No-Hitter -- Bobo Holloman." That was the first week of May the spring of 1953.
IT'S beginning to look as if Sea Hero is the Bobo Holloman of racing.
He had that one glorious day on the first Saturday in May, finding a hole in the pack and running until he could smell the roses.
Winning the Derby is far more important than pitching a no-hitter, but we are talking here of flash-in-the-pans we have known.
All over the world, wherever horses are raced, only one stall is honored with a placard saying: "Kentucky Derby 1993 Winner."


McEnroe Allocating His Time
His last official match was in November, but John McEnroe just can't keep himself far away from tennis.
He is scheduled to play in several fund-raising events in the next two weeks while he prepares for his role as a USA Network commentator at the United States Open.
He is also dabbling in coaching again, with Boris Becker the beneficiary.


Talks on Bosnia Bog Down Over Borders
With a final agreement on the future status of Sarajevo still pending, negotiations to end the war in Bosnia turned today to defining the borders of the country's future ethnic republics.
The talks immediately bogged down in differences among the three parties to the conflict.
Each of the delegations has presented a map showing how it envisions a fair partition of the country under a peace accord, but there are major disagreements between the Muslims and Serbs over eastern Bosnia and between the Muslims and Croats over central Bosnia.


NBC Deal On Cable TV Transmission
In the latest move to resolve the fight over the retransmission of network-owned television stations on cable systems, NBC reached an agreement yesterday with Time Warner Cable, the nation's second-largest cable TV operator.
NBC will gain distribution for America's Talking, a new all-talk cable channel it owns, and Time Warner systems will pay an undisclosed amount for the right to carry it.
In return, the network will not charge Time Warner's cable systems any fee for the right to continue carrying stations owned by NBC.

Short-Term Issues Still Alluring
Despite the persistent rally in the long end of the Treasury market, there are signs in the corporate bond market that many money managers still prefer the safety of shorter maturities.
Stephen Clark, senior corporate market analyst at Technical Data, notes that the spreads between the yields on shorter-term corporate bonds and comparable Treasury securities have narrowed recently, which is a sign of strong demand for corporates.
At the same time, he said, the yield spread on longer-term corporate debt has held constant in the new-issue market and, in some cases, has widened when issues begin trading in the secondary market.


Egypt Fights Militant Islam With More of the Same
Sheik Mohammed al-Ghozali is Egypt's model of the mainstream Muslim cleric, a scholar given ample television time by the Government to expound the merciful virtues of Islam.
But when asked last month on a witness stand whether people who espouse secularist views should be punished, his answer was simple: they should die.


Reflections of Reality Found in the Mind's Eye
"OH my God, look," jubilated Catherine Starkey.
"Can you believe it?" she asked standing on a desolate and dirty street in Red Hook and pointing at what seemed to be nothing at all.
"It was right here, No. 193 Bush Street," said the 71-year-old mother of five who lives in Tyler, Tex.
"This is where I lived until I was 17 years old."


Israeli Court Clears Way to Deporting Demjanjuk
John Demjanjuk, the central figure in the "Ivan the Terrible" case, was ordered set free today by Israel's Supreme Court, which said he should be deported and not face new charges of having committed war crimes as a Nazi death-camp guard.
But the court immediately heard arguments that implementation of its decision be delayed pending still further review.
So it ;was not clear when the Ukrainian-born Mr.
Demjanjuk, a 73-year-old retired auto worker who was stripped of his American citizenship 12 years ago, would leave for the United States.
His family hopes he will be able to do so on Thursday.


Food Notes
New York Winners
The annual City Gardeners' Harvest Fair will be held Saturday and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn.
Admission is free.
Anyone who grows vegetables or flowers in the five boroughs can compete for prize ribbons in 34 categories.
Contestants must register their entries from 4 to 6 P.M. on Friday or from 10 A.M. to noon on Saturday.
For information, call (212) 233-2926 or (718) 338-3799.
Gelati of Every Type
Although the Italian term gelato generally refers to ice cream, it is also used for ices, as in Zabar's Gelato, a new line of fruit ices.
These frozen confections are made with fruit, sugar and vegetable gum in British Columbia and come in fairly tart raspberry, sweet mango (with the emphasis on the sweet), Dutch chocolate that is dairy-free but not fat-free and a rousingly refreshing icy lemon flavor that tastes just like perfect frozen lemonade.
Calories range from 101 in 4 ounces for the lemon to 179 calories and about 9 grams of fat for the chocolate.
The ices sell for $2.98 a pint.
If Zabar's Gelato raises no cross-cultural eyebrows, how about Rosenbloom's Gelato?
Unlike the Zabar's product, this is rich ice cream made with Ronnybrook Farms' excellent skim milk and heavy cream.
Jonathan Rosenbloom, a chef who once owned the Col Legno restaurant in the East Village, retreated upstate to Amenia in Dutchess County with his wife, Audrey, and last fall began making gelato to sell to restaurants.
Now Rosenbloom's Gelato is available in pints at retail.
The flavors, none of which are excessively sweet, include fairly intense chocolate, delicate but fruity wild strawberry, rich hazelnut and rather subdued vanilla.
Within a week or two a heavenly creme caramel flavor and a superb tiramisu, complete with a layer of cocoa on top, will also be available.
Rosenbloom's Gelato is $3.50 a pint at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street), and at Dean &amp; DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street).
Meanwhile, Ronnybrook Farms is about to introduce its own ice cream, also made by Mr.
Rosenbloom, which will be on the market by the end of the month.
Steven James, one of Ronnybrook's owners, said that the Ronnybrook ice cream was being made in in vanilla, raspberry and hazelnut double-chocolate flake.
A Peach Like a Doughnut
The white peaches have been excellent this year, and now Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (71st Street), has started selling a new kind of white peach, called a Donut peach.
Compared with the usual spherical peach, these look positively deformed, about the size of a lady apple but with the top and bottom squashed into the center.
If it weren't for the tiny pit in the center, they would, in fact, be shaped like doughnuts.
These peculiar peaches, grown in California and distributed nationally by Frieda's Finest, are juicy and luscious, priced at $4.98 a pound.
Chefs at the Greenmarket
A series of cooking demonstrations at the Union Square Greenmarket will begin today at noon and continue through Nov. 6.
Michael Romano, the chef at the Union Square Cafe, will be the first in the lineup of guest chefs and cookbook authors.
On Saturday, Charles Kiely, the chef at Abby restaurant, will demonstrate cheese making.
The remaining schedule is a random one, with some of the events on Wednesdays, others on Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays.
Among the chefs scheduled are Gray Kunz of Lespinasse, David Bouley of Bouley and Maury Rubin of City Bakery.
The demonstrations are free, but a $1 donation is requested for tasting samples.
When cookbook authors are scheduled, they will arrive by 10 A.M. to autograph copies of their books, which will be on sale.
Information on the schedule is available by calling the Greenmarket office at (212) 477-3220.
One Saturday demonstration -- on Oct. 9, by Leslie McKen, the chef at New Prospect at Home in Park Slope -- will be held at the Grand Army Plaza Greenmarket in Brooklyn.
Judging the Picnic Fare
Friends of the Arts, a nonprofit organization associated with the Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay, L.I., will hold its annual picnic contest on Saturday night.
Prizes will be awarded for the picnics judged to be the most delicious, most elegant and most unusual.
Anyone wishing to compete must register by 6:30 P.M. upon entering the park, before the Dave Brubeck concert at 8 P.M.
Tickets for the concert are $15 to $25 and will be sold at the door.
For more information: (516) 922-0061.
Learning About Wine
Even though Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the World Trade Center, is still closed, the popular wine courses conducted by Kevin Zraly and his staff are continuing.
They are being held in the 45th-floor conference center at 7 World Trade Center, on Vesey Street near Church Street.
Applications for the complete wine course, taught with great flair and showmanship by Mr.
Zraly in eight weekly two-hour sessions, are now being accepted.
There are two series, Mondays from 7 to 9 P.M. beginning Sept. 20, and Tuesdays from 6 to 8 P.M. beginning Sept. 21.
Two spring series are also scheduled.
The cost for the course is $425.

Review/Film: Manhattan Murder Mystery; Allen and Keaton, Together Again And Dizzy as Ever
No one could cling to the notion that Woody Allen's art simply imitates his life after watching "Manhattan Murder Mystery," the mild, middle-aged, atypically blithe comedy Mr.
Allen was busy directing when his private difficulties became front-page news.
Nor could anyone watch this latest film of Mr.
Allen's in a vacuum.
Reuniting Mr.
Allen with Diane Keaton, this time to play a nagging, hopelessly neurotic Nick and Nora Charles investigating the disappearance of their neighbor, "Manhattan Murder Mystery" cannot help conjuring up the rapport these two shared so memorably, several lifetimes ago.
At its amiable best, the new film offers glimmers of its stars' charming, quarrelsome old teamwork, although their exchanges are now dampened by the down-to-earth realities of long acquaintance.
But in its less successful moments, hamstrung by the demands of a dated detective story, "Manhattan Murder Mystery" ignores its own obvious possibilities.
It would be far more interesting to watch these two work out the aftermath of "Annie Hall" than to hear them theorize endlessly about an empty, genre-bound crime.


Ottey Gets Reprieve for Race
Merlene Ottey finally scored a victory of sorts today, but Gail Devers still won the race.
In Monday night's 100-meter final for women in the world outdoor track and field championships, the judges ruled that Devers, the 26-year-old American, had beaten Ottey, the 33-year-old Jamaican, by an eyelash.
Jamaican officials protested, saying that Ottey had won or had at least tied for first.


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS
Austin, Progressing Nicely, Wins Again  Tracy Austin, playing in a tournament she won 12 years ago, took another step in her comeback yesterday with a 7-5, 6-2 victory over Audra Keller in the first round of the Matinee Ltd.
Canadian Open in Toronto.
"I'm enjoying what I'm doing and I feel I'm progessing with each tournament," said Austin, her right arm wrapped in a sling with ice after the match.
"I feel a little bit more comfortable on the court." Austin, a two-time United States Open champion, now has a ranking for the first time in 10 years, No. 159.
In second-round matches, Jennifer Capriati, seeded No. 6 and the 1991 Canadian Open champion, advanced with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Chanda Rubin, and No. 15 Naoko Sawamatsu of Japan won the last 12 games en route to a 7-5, 6-0 decision over Patricia Hy of Canada. (AP) Courier and Becker Advance: Second-seeded Jim Courier celebrated his 23d birthday with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Jaime Oncins of Brazil in the second round of the United States Hardcourt Championships in Indianapolis.
Third-seeded Boris Becker had a tougher time, defeating Andrew Sznajder of Canada, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, in an earlier match.
Courier, ranked No. 2, lost his opening match in the ATP Championship last week and lost in the third round of the Canadian Open in his first event since Wimbledon.
But he handled Oncins with ease, serving two aces to lead, 5-2, in the second set.
Becker, ranked No. 4, battled through six deuces before finally holding serve and winning his final game.
Sznajder was unable to take advantage of 53 unforced errors by the German.
Last week, Becker withdrew from the ATP Championship because of an inflamed left foot.
"I just battled 2 hours and 45 minutes, and the foot is no problem at all," he said.
Todd Martin, seeded fifth, lost a second-round match, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-0, to Jaime Yzaga of Peru.
Martin, who reached the finals in Washington and Montreal, has moved from 92d to 14th in the ranking.
But yesterday's loss was his second straight to the Yzaga, ranked 64th. (AP)


'Ghost Riders' Are Target of an Insurance Sting
For some time, mass transit operators have worried about a growing phenomenon: "ghost riders," people who file insurance claims for injuries they never sustained in public transit accidents.
When there is a bus or train accident, people from the neighborhood often race on board and claim they were victims.
New Jersey decided to do something about it.
It set up a sting operation, and staged more than 10 accidents around the state, which it filmed.
Then, it watched the claims pour in.


In America; Michael's Chance
The youngsters on the basketball court on the Upper West Side of Manhattan were trying to figure out a way to pull a kernel of opportunity from the death of James Jordan.
The afternoon was appropriately gloomy, a sullen gray, humid.
The ball rattled off the backboard and into the hands of Dyam Jennings, who is 15.
A moment later, standing beside the court, he and a few friends asked how Michael Jordan was doing and said they worried that he would have a hard time next season when he will have to go onto the court without his father nearby.


Gregory d'Alessio, 88, Cartoonist and Painter
Gregory d'Alessio, a cartoonist, painter and teacher, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 88.
He had suffered from emphysema for the past three years and died in his sleep, said Hilda Terry d'Alessio, his wife.


Sanity of Defendant in Slaying Questioned
At his first court appearance since he was found fit to stand trial for the killing of a woman walking her dogs, a homeless man yesterday made claims that led a judge to question his sanity once again.
The defendant, Kevin McKiever, 36, charged with killing Alexis Ficks Welsh, claimed that his lawyer had withheld evidence favorable to him, referred insistently to hearings that were never held and cited tests that were never conducted.


Don't Rob Schools to Pay for Boot Camps
To the Editor:
Has our society become so desensitized that no one questions it when the military is used to educate our youth ("Military Regimen for Teen-Age Dropouts," front page, Aug. 11)?
We are constantly told that the military can bear no more budget cuts.
At the same time, inner-city school boards are making hard decisions to close schools, cut programs and lay off personnel.
Isn't there something wrong here?


Book Notes; General Powell to Trade the Sword for the Pen
For months, New York's big-bucks publishers have been working themselves into a frenzy over Gen.
Colin L. Powell, who is to retire as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Sept. 30 and then, at least in the publishers' minds, immediately begin working on his memoirs.
Yesterday, his agent, Marvin Josephson of International Creative Management, announced that Random House had acquired world rights to the general's autobiography.
Rival publishers familiar with the negotiations said the final price was about $6.5 million, which would make it $1.5 million more than Gen.
H.
Norman Schwarzkopf reportedly received for his vastly successful autobiography, "It Doesn't Take a Hero" (Bantam), which sold more than a million copies.


U.S. Plans to Offer Aid, Not Protection, in Chips
In a closely watched test of the Administration's approach to strategic industries, the Commerce Department has drafted a plan to subsidize research on certain computer chip devices but has refused to protect the industry from foreign rivals, American officials said today.
The decision is the clearest sign yet of the Administration's desire to help high-technology industries in the international marketplace through technical assistance rather than through protectionist tariffs on imports.
An Administration official said that while the nation's reliance on imports of the devices "doesn't present an immediate threat to national security, improving the capabilities of the domestic industry is desirable for both economic and national security." Legislation Not Needed
The Administration official insisted on anonymity because the White House was told only on Monday evening about the research assistance plan, which the Commerce Department could undertake with its own resources and without special legislation.


Cassell Signs 5-Year Pact With Rockets
SAM CASSELL, a Florida State guard drafted in the first round, signed a conditional five-year contract yesterday with the Houston Rockets that will guarantee him $2.53 million in the first three years.
The fourth and fifth years could be guaranteed if Cassell achieves certain incentives.
If the Rockets do not guarantee the fourth year, he could become a free agent in his fifth year.


76ers Seek a Master to Tutor Bradley
SHAWN BRADLEY can look forward to working with MOSES MALONE in Bradley's first season with the Philadelphia 76ers.
Now, he may also benefit from tutoring by KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR.

Getting the two together "is a possibility down the line," Lynam said.


Sudanese Deny Any Tie To Bomb Plot
The Sudanese Mission to the United Nations today denied any role in a plot to bomb the U.N. headquarters and other targets in New York last June.
The denial came after a State Department official said Monday that the United States has evidence that the Sudan played a role in the plot, although he would not give details.
The evidence is one reason Washington has decided to place the Sudan on a list of terrorist nations, he said.
A law-enforcement official, though, today said there was no "hard evidence" of Sudanese government involvement, just possible indications of involvement on tapes made by a Government informer.


Capital's Political Culture Destroys the Best; To Comprehend Suicide

Egyptian Cleric May Drop Fight Against Deportation
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the imprisoned Islamic cleric whose followers include suspects in two New York bombing conspiracies, might abandon his fight against deportation if the United States allows him to leave for Afghanistan, his lawyer said yesterday.

Aspin Says Inquiry Is Set on 1984 'Star Wars' Test
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin said today that the Pentagon would investigate reports that a "Star Wars" test was rigged and test results manipulated in 1984.
But the Secretary of Defense at the time, Caspar W. Weinberger, and the officer who ran the experiment for the missile defense program each denied the accusations today.
Mr.
Aspin said the accusations, made by four former Reagan Administration officials familiar with the program, raised serious questions.


Weight Charges Filed Against Stew Leonard's
Customers at Stew Leonard's Dairy store in Norwalk were overcharged on a variety of foods ranging from ham salad (3 cents on a one-pound package) to lox ($1.76 on a one-pound package), according to a detailed report on short-weighting released today by the state.
At any other store that might seem like small change, but Stew Leonard's -- which touts itself as the world's largest dairy store -- is a Connecticut institution that has been cited as a model of entrepreneurial genius.
The store has also been in the news because its founder, Stew Leonard Sr., and three company executives pleaded guilty to skimming more than $17 million from sales in an elaborate tax-fraud scheme.


At Northwest, Chairmen Defend a Turbulent Ride
This much seems certain about Northwest Airlines' co-chairmen, Alfred A. Checchi and Gary L. Wilson: They have a knack for making something better out of a bad situation.
In the face of an apparently inevitable bankruptcy filing this summer, for example, they orchestrated a swap of concessions with labor to restructure Northwest's troubled finances.
The airline's competitive position is now improved with lower costs, and its labor deal is mentioned frequently as part of a laudable industry trend toward employee ownership.


Heart Patients Weigh Risks for Themselves

Rene Dreyfus, Auto Racer, 88
Rene Dreyfus, winner of the 1930 Grand Prix of Monaco and founder of Le Chanteclair restaurant in Manhattan, died on Monday of an aneurysm of the aorta at New York Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 88.
Mr.
Dreyfus, who was born in Nice, France, was an international driver of such distinction from 1925 to 1950 that he was awarded the Legion of Honor by President Charles de Gaulle in the early 1960's.
In 1938, he became the Race Champion of France.
In 1940, he placed 10th in the Indianapolis 500 after he came to the United States on special leave from the French Army to represent France in the race.
He joined the United States Army when Germany invaded Paris that year, and later brought his family to the United States.

Third World Economic Gains Give a Lift to U.S. Exporters
The third world is giving the American economy an unexpected and much-needed lift, by increasing its imports of American goods by almost one-third over the last two years, with another large jump anticipated this year.
American sales to the nonindustrialized world rose to $167 billion last year, up 14 percent over the previous year and largely offsetting weak demand from Europe and Japan, both plagued by economic slumps.
Exports to the third world jumped to more than 37 percent of total United States exports last year, from 32 percent in 1990.
Several Factors Cited
Administration officials attribute the export boom to several factors.
The rapidly industrializing countries of Asia are growing at a phenomenal pace, enabling them to purchase more American metal-cutting machines and Madonna records.
Mexico, Argentina and other Latin American countries have recently lowered many tariffs and removed other trade barriers, while the region's growth is picking up after years of stagnation.


A Designer's Inspiration Is Booed in Miami Beach
There were bravos all around for Gianni Versace when the Italian fashion designer paid $2.95 million for a historic but dilapidated apartment building in the Art Deco District here last year, promising to restore the palazzo-turned-tenement to its original state and to make it his home and his base of American operations.
But now that Mr.
Versace has also bought the Revere Hotel next door for $3.7 million more, things have turned sour.
Taking advantage of loopholes in a local ordinance, he plans to demolish the hotel, which, like the beachfront mansion, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and build a pool and a garage on the cleared property.


McRae to Play in Turkey
The former Syracuse center CONRAD McRAE, facing long odds at making it in the N.B.A., has signed a one-year contract with a professional team in Turkey.

Germany May Allow Imprisoned Terrorists to Meet
Seeking to avoid a threatened new wave of leftist terrorism, German officials may allow jailed terrorists to meet together for the first time in the hope that they will urge their comrades outside to refrain from further violence.
The issue is being hotly debated by politicians and prosecutors.
Some are strongly opposed to giving the convicted terrorists any concessions, but others say the idea is worth pursuing because it could save lives.

Orange Farm Journal; In South Africa's Chaos, a Do-It-Yourself School
Along with the obvious headaches of helping administer the largest school in South Africa, Peter Kekana has a few unusual handicaps.
Most of his 10,000 pupils live in shacks of scrap lumber and corrugated asbestos.
A third of his teachers lack the minimum credentials.
The state refuses to give him any textbooks.
The neighbors steal his windows and light fixtures.
And, by the way, his classrooms are converted chicken coops.


Corrections
An article last Thursday about a Dutch panel that studies the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt misstated the position of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on two paintings in the museum.
The paintings, "Portrait of a Man" and "Portrait of a Woman," are labeled "By Rembrandt." The museum did not revise its attribution after the Dutch panel, the Rembrandt Research Project, attributed them to Rembrandt's studio assistants rather than to the artist himself.

In reading "The Clues Left by Vincent Foster" (editorial, Aug. 12), I hoped to find some thoughtful reflection on the social and political decay of a city created to serve this nation and its people.
You fail to acknowledge that public service in Washington inflicts a brutal toll on individuals who enter it and on their families.


Coleman Situation And His Future Put Mets in Quandary
The Mets' front office will let Vince Coleman explain himself in a meeting tentatively set for Friday and will then either suspend him with pay, suspend him without pay, void his contract or release him, the team's legal counsel, David Howard, said tonight.
Based on those developments, it is unlikely Coleman will play another game for the Mets this season.

SOMEONE forgot to tell the Chrysler Corporation about the decline of brand names.

Yet Chrysler is redoubling efforts to bolster the brand images of its five lines of cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles.


The Perils of Peacekeeping
The news that the Clinton Administration is considering an expanded role in United Nations peacekeeping operations is cause for concern.
The plan would allow American soldiers to serve under foreign commanders on a regular basis.
Before adopting any directive embracing this policy, the Administration should allow Congress to debate it thoroughly.
If the plan is carried out, we would face more than the dubious prospect of sending U.S. troops into battle under foreign command.
We might also become militarily involved in operations that the American people don't properly understand or support.


Sorry, New York, 'Yo' Was Born in Philadelphia
To the Editor:
As a displaced Philadelphian, I feel duty-bound to defend the honor of the city of my birth.

'Searching' Still Seeking Expected Audience
Few films have opened this summer to higher critical praise than "Searching for Bobby Fischer" did.
Yet the movie -- which is without major stars, without violence, without sex and without high-tech gimmicks -- is also, for the moment, without a big audience and struggling at the box office.
The movie, based on a true story about a boy in New York who is both a chess prodigy and an average kid, opened at 219 theaters last week in major cities to decent, if slightly disappointing, crowds.

Inside Out at the Beach
Her new store is called Inside Out, because that is how Zina Glazebrook says she was feeling when she moved to the East End of Long Island a few years ago.
With experience in the toy business and as a designer of window displays, Ms.
Glazebrook, far left, decided that a small store of her own would be the best way to communicate her quirky and stylish point of view.
Now ensconced a few yards from the A.&amp;P. in East Hampton, Ms.
Glazebrook's colorful emporium draws people who seem to be either on their way to or just back from grocery shopping.
Inside the tiny store, you can stand in one place and take it all in.
On one wall are Tor Lundvall's misty paintings of Long Island scenes ($400 to $1,500 apiece).
Scattered around are the store are ceramics by the California artist Polly Frizzell: mugs are $30 each and a cookie jar in the shape of a hotel is $150.
And all ready for play is Jack Stapleton's "Gourmet Chess Set," left, the white pieces filled with rock salt, the black with peppercorns ($125.) The shop is at 74 Park Place in East Hampton -- telephone (516) 329-3600 -- and is open every day from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., but closed from noon to 4 P.M., "so I can get my other design work done," Ms.

When asked why she needed the loan, she finally admitted that she was so far behind in her payments on about 20 credit cards that collection agencies were calling her.
Each card was at its credit limit and she was unable to pay even the minimum amounts the creditors demanded.
Her solution was to borrow more money. His was to hold what he called "a funeral."


Justice Dept. Is Pressing U.S. Court to Keep Demjanjuk Out
Seeking to block the return of John Demjanjuk to the United States, Justice Department lawyers have been sending an almost daily stream of letters and briefs to a Federal appeals court in recent days exhorting the judges to delay or reverse an earlier order that permits him to come back.
The department has asked the 14 active judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, to intervene in the case.


N.F.L. TRAINING CAMP REPORT
Los Angeles Raiders
Los Angeles Raiders Coach Art Shell was released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles early yesterday, less than 48 hours after being admitted for tests and treatment for a form of diabetes.
"I discharged him a few minutes ago," said Dr.
Stephen Corday, internist for the Raiders.
"He's back to full strength and energy. He will be at practice tomorrow morning and on the airplane tomorrow afternoon."


Concern Grows Over Reopening of Schools
With school scheduled to begin in just three weeks, anxiety is building among New York City officials that asbestos inspections of the city's 1,069 schools may not be completed on time and that superintendents and principals may have to draw up emergency plans for the fall term.
Thousands of concerned parents have been phoning neighborhood schools and district offices across the city, demanding information about which schools will open this fall, and superintendents and principals have so far been unable to respond because an emergency inspection program is just beginning.


S.A.T. Scores Improve For 2d Consecutive Year
For the second year in a row, the average scores of students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test have risen, prompting test officials to be optimistic about continued improvement.
The average S.A.T. verbal score this year was 424, one point above last year's score, while the mathematics average was 478, a two-point rise over 1992, for a total of 902.
The highest possible scores are 800 on each, and the lowest are 200.


Stars Are Still Shining At Halfway Point of Meet
The show is half over in the world outdoor track and field championships, with four days of competition done, a day off today and four days of competition to come.
And as exciting as the first four days have been, with memorable performances by Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Gail Devers, Michael Johnson and Linford Christie, there are more big performances in sight.
Consider, for example, Dan O'Brien, the world record-holder attempting to become the first man to reach 9,000 points in the decathlon.
Consider his fellow American, Mike Powell, trying to convince everyone that someone could beat him in the men's long jump.
Consider Carl Lewis and Merlene Ottey pursuing the gold medals in the 200 meters that eluded them in the 100.


Classical Music in Review
Bronx Arts Ensemble  Van Cortlandt Park
The Bronx Arts Ensemble, a loose confederation of chamber players and soloists, has presented a broad array of repertory in its 20 years.
Mostly it stays within the bounds of classical music, but now and then it indulges other passions.
In its free concert on Sunday afternoon at Rockwood Drive Circle in Van Cortlandt Park, the ensemble presented itself as the Silks and Rags Concert Band in a program of works that included standards by Scott Joplin, Eubie Blake and John W. Bratton, as well as a few novelties.


Russian Hardball: Rutskoi Accused of Corruption
A presidential commission investigating charges of high-level corruption accused Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi today of involvement with a Swiss bank account containing millions of dollars of state funds.
The charges, made at a nationally televised news conference, were a particularly vivid example of how politics is played these days in Russia.

Companies
Several big companies announced an alliance to stimulate the market for recycled paper.
Prudential Insurance, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Time Warner, McDonald's, Nationsbank and others will work with the Environmental Defense Fund to study ways to use more recycled paper in their products and printed materials to help reduce the burden on solid-waste landfills.  [ Page A1. ]
Lockheed's Information Management unit received special favors from the Dinkins administration when it sought a $150 million city contract to take over many operations of the Parking Violations Bureau, according to investigators.  [ A1. ]


Report Says Top Dinkins Aides Showed Favoritism to Contractor
Senior members of the Dinkins administration repeatedly gave unusual time and attention, and other special treatment, to a company seeking a $150 million contract to collect parking ticket fines for New York City, city investigators said in a report yesterday.
Late yesterday afternoon, just hours after the report's release, Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was canceling the contract, which was awarded tentatively last January to Lockheed Information Management Services.


To Sarajevo, Writer Brings Good Will and 'Godot'
A charged silence settled over the theater as actors and audience took a long, painful pause, digesting a message of hope deceived that is a defining passage of a new dramatic production performed here for the first time on Tuesday.
To hear the silence of the packed house in the small theater in the city center was to feel the grief and disappointment that weigh on Sarajevo as it nears the end of its second summer under siege.


CHRONICLE
The tennis star Arthur Ashe died in February of complications of AIDS.
At a luncheon today at the first Bronx Pro Tennis Classic, being played this week in Crotona Park, MARGARET E. MAHONEY, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, one of the country's oldest philanthropies, will award $175,000 in Ashe's memory to the New York Junior Tennis League.
The money will help build an $800,000 indoor tennis center on White Plains Road.
The league already provides 900 tennis courts in the city for more than 170,000 youngsters.
Ashe was a founder of the league, which was established in 1969 to help poor city youths learn to play tennis and then train to compete successfully against the best.

Jordan Suspects on Videotape
A videotape seized by authorities in Lumberton, N.C., investigating the slaying of MICHAEL JORDAN's father, James, shows one suspect performing a rap song while flashing an N.B.A. championship ring, an investigator said yesterday.
Authorities have also recovered a .38-caliber pistol believed to be the murder weapon.


Brazil's Army Casts U.S. as Amazon Villain
If Brazilian newspaper headlines were to be believed last week, the United States Government was plotting the biggest land grab since the Louisiana Purchase.
"U.S.A. Builds Two Military Bases in the Amazon Region," one headline read.
Another announced, "U.S. Bases Surround the Amazon."
What was really going on, political analysts say, is that Brazil's military was flexing its political muscles, seeking to win support for a plan to extend air traffic control over the Amazon.


Corrections
A picture caption on Tuesday about a police investigation at the site where a kidnapped executive had been confined in a pit along the Henry Hudson Parkway in Manhattan misstated the location.
It was near West 161st Street, not at West 158th Street.


Clutch Hit Somehow Carried Yanks Away
How distant it all seems, now, that Don Mattingly home run against Baltimore on Sunday, a hit that brought 15 minutes of fame to the Connecticut Yankee fan who caught it.
The hit that was supposed to galvanize the drive to the division crown.
The Mattingly home run not only defeated Baltimore, 1-0, but was also supposed to provide the snapshot for the ages in The Yankees Pennant of 1993.
But the photo has faded, its image supplanted quickly by somber Yankee faces following lost opportunities and a lost series against the Texas Rangers.


Will Wideouts End Up Left Out In Jets' Offense?
In the Jets' first two exhibition games, 12 passes have been caught by tight ends and 11 by running backs.
Wide receivers have caught just six and the only man with more than one is Mario Bailey, a rookie listed as a backup on the depth chart.
He has caught 2 for 17 yards.
Does this mean the Jets' offense of 1993 will have more of a ball-control attack featuring shorter, safer passes?
Does it mean that Boomer Esiason, the veteran who is their new starting quarterback, won't throw deep the way he once did with Cincinnati?
Does it mean the Jets lack confidence in their wideouts?

Sorry, New York, 'Yo' Was Born in Philadelphia; Refined Usage
To the Editor:
Michael T. Kaufman's claim that "Yo" has been made notable by its use by New Yorkers is off base (About New York, Aug. 4).
"Yo" is Philly idiom and, like cheese steaks, has been spread to the four corners of the country, if not beyond.


Yen's Rise Is Pressing Japan To Deregulate the Economy
Japanese officials said today that they would prepare plans to deregulate Japan's economy so that the benefits of the stronger yen could be passed on to the nation's hard-pressed consumers and businesses in the form of lower prices.
The statements, lacking in detail, followed an emergency meeting of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his economic ministers that was held this morning to discuss how to contend with the rising yen.


Special Squad: 'Heroes' in an Ordeal
In the end it came down to self-interest.
Detectives needed to find Harvey Weinstein and only the suspects could tell them.
At Police Headquarters Monday afternoon, Detective Ruben Santiago explained the situation to Fermin Rodriguez.
"You can go to prison for kidnapping," Detective Santiago is said to have told him, "or you can go to prison for a homicide."


Jail Incident In Westchester Is Called Fake
The Westchester County Executive today accused guards at the county jail in Valhalla of staging a hostage-taking incident on Sunday.
The county executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, said that county police investigators had "received statements from both corrections officers and county jail inmates" that the four-hour confrontation "was a setup" staged with the cooperation of the inmates.


Robert C. Maynard, 56, Publisher Who Helped Minority Journalists
Robert C. Maynard, a trailblazer for minority journalists who was the first black editor and owner of a major daily newspaper in the United States, died at his home in Oakland, Calif., on Tuesday.

He died of prostate cancer, a family spokesman said.


Looking Back: From a Crypt to Freedom
Lean, grizzled and grateful for life, Harvey Weinstein described yesterday his frightening passage from kidnapping crypt to freedom regained, lingering over a despairing plea that his kidnappers at least leave his dead body to be claimed and reinterred by loved ones.
"I begged, I pleaded with my captors to take me out and shoot me and leave me on the road where my family would have to find my body and I could be buried properly next to my parents," the 68-year-old ransom victim declared in a low, shaky tone at a news conference that ranged from the joyous to the macabre as he recounted his 12 days buried underground.


U.S. Embargo of Cuba Has a Human Cost
To the Editor:
Cuba's epidemic of optic neuropathy, which has resulted in the visual and neurological impairment of thousands of Cubans, marks a new and dangerous point in the United States embargo of Cuba.
As of June, total reported cases had reached 45,584, which is considerable for Cuba's population of 11 million.


Plan Offered By Giuliani On Reducing Hotel Taxes
Resurrecting a theme that he has touched upon in campaign stops throughout the summer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, yesterday provided his most specific proposal yet for reducing hotel occupancy taxes that he described as the highest in the world.
Appearing outside the Market Diner at 43d Street and 11th Avenue yesterday morning, Mr.
Giuliani said he would cut the city's hotel tax in half, to 3 percent from 6 percent, and would challenge the State Legislature to match or exceed that reduction to attract more tourism and to end a boycott of the city led by the Professional Convention Management Association.


Israeli Court Rules for Demjanjuk but He Stays in Jail
Although a second set of Supreme Court justices ordered his deportation, John Demjanjuk remained today in an Israeli prison cell, where he will stay at least two more days while the court hears still more appeals flowing from the "Ivan the Terrible" case.
The judges said today that Mr.
Demjanjuk should be set free, but they then ordered another hearing for Friday at the request of Israelis demanding that new war crimes charges be brought.


McCall's Actions Provoke G.O.P. on Autonomy Issue
Since being chosen State Comptroller in early May, H. Carl McCall has worked diligently to shore up his most obvious political vulnerability -- the perception that he is not independent enough to challenge longtime allies like Mayor David N. Dinkins and Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo.
But in the last week, the Democratic Comptroller has taken several actions that have led to a barrage of Republican criticism.


WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO COMBINE F.B.I. WITH DRUG AGENCY
In a move that has touched off a ferocious debate within the Government, the Clinton Administration is proposing to consolidate the fight against drugs by merging the Drug Enforcement Administration into the Federal Bureau of Investigation, officials said today.
The idea has drug agency officials preparing to wage war to preserve or enhance their status, and scurrying to find allies in Congress, where significant opposition has already surfaced.


Space Job Benefits For Boeing
The Government's selection on Tuesday of the Boeing Company as the prime contractor for the redesigned space station will mean more in terms of pride and prestige for the aerospace giant than it will in jobs and revenues.
In a clear endorsement of the ability of Boeing to integrate large complex systems, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration chose the contractor over the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the Rockwell International Corporation, and the Grumman Corporation, which had served as equals on the project.


New York City Council Sees Little Upheaval in Elections
If any member of the New York City Council was vulnerable to a challenge this year, it was Lucy Cruz of the Bronx.
In just two years on the Council, Ms.
Cruz has been branded with scandals that would make any political opponent's mouth water, from using school workers to repair her home to handing out patronage jobs.
But Ms.
Cruz has no challengers in the Democratic primary this year, nor does she have any significant challenge from Republicans, Conservatives or Liberals in the general election.


Jerkens Calls Virginia Rapids 'Not 1,000 Percent' and Pulls Colt Out of Travers
Allen Jerkens broke his own chance for a historic streak at Saratoga today when he withdrew Virginia Rapids from the $1 million Travers Stakes on Saturday because the colt "just wasn't 1,000 percent."
It was the second time in three weeks that Jerkens had withdrawn a star from a major race because he wasn't satisfied with the horse's sharpness.
He took Classy Mirage out of the Test Stakes for fillies on July 31, and said then: "I don't know what's wrong, but she's not at her best."


Classical Music in Review
Shu-Ching Chen and Ju-Ying Song  Pianists Museum of Modern Art
The sculpture garden at the Museum of Modern Art has reverberated this summer with the sounds of contemporary Latin American composition.
Joel Sachs, the conductor of the contemporary-music ensemble Continuum and the organizer of Juilliard's Focus festival, has put together "Summergarden 1993," an ambitious nine-week series sampling 57 Latin composers, familiar and unknown.
It gives a good sense of a vital compositional tradition that has finally begun to receive wide notice in the United States.


Flapping Shoe Unglues Nike
Nike officials here seemed embarrassed today by the flap over the flap.
In the final Tuesday night of the men's 400 meters in the world outdoor track and field championships, Quincy Watts, the American who won the Olympic gold medal last year, finished fourth.
He was hampered because his left shoe had broken midway through the race, sending the heel flapping.


Abbott Hangs a Curve, Then Hangs His Head
There was urgency in Jim Abbott's voice and seriousness in his eyes.
That was after the game.
There was frustration in his actions as he screamed and tossed some equipment in the dugout.
That was during the game.
Abbott was upset and he wasn't alone.
The Yankees wasted several opportunities against a pitcher of meager distinction named Roger Pavlik yesterday, Abbott threw enough faulty pitches to get into early trouble and the Yankee bats failed to come to his rescue.
The result was a damaging 4-2 loss to the Texas Rangers at Yankee Stadium.
That made it two straight losses in the Bronx, which is rare for the Yankees.


TERRORISTS HELPED BY SUDAN, U.S. SAYS
The Administration's decision to add the Sudan to the list of countries that sponsor international terrorism was based on evidence that the Sudan harbors terrorists, and not because of any Sudanese links to a reported plot to bomb targets in New York City, United States officials said today.
The State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said evidence indicated that the Sudan had allowed its territory to be used as a sanctuary for groups like the Abu Nidal organization, the Party of God and the Palestine Islamic Holy War.
The State Deparment considers all three groups terrorist organizations.


Sports of The Times; Mattingly In the Flag Race
YESTERDAY, on a day when the Yankees were trying to climb back into first place in the American League East, on a day that started bleak and gray in the sky and ended bleak and gray in the Yankee dugout, Don Mattingly was their last best hope.
He came to the plate with the crowd giving him a warm cheer, with two outs and none on in the bottom of the ninth and the Yankees down by 4-2, and he stood at the plate with his customary crouch and wiggle of the bat, with his eyes above the lampblack fixed narrowly on the Rangers' pitcher, Tom Henke.


Hawks Sign No. 1 Pick
The Atlanta Hawks signed forward DOUG EDWARDS of Florida State, their top draft choice, to a multiyear contract yesterday.
Terms were not released.
Edwards was the 15th player chosen in the National Basketball Association draft last month.
He averaged 17.2 points a game at Florida State.


The Star Wars Hoax
The revelation on yesterday's front page was enough to rouse even the most cynical student of official mendacity: at great cost, The Times's Tim Weiner reports, the Reagan Administration back in 1984 designed an elaborate deception to mislead the Soviet Union about the "Star Wars" space-based missile defense.
The scheme deceived not only the Kremlin but Congress, defrauding the American people of billions of dollars that could have been spent on real defense and domestic programs.
By willfully misleading Congress about the system's capabilities, Pentagon officials did more than damage their own credibility; they may have committed a crime.
Congress must call those responsible to account.

2 Tallies Show Senate Got Earful on Clinton Budget
The phones are quiet on Capitol Hill now, but tallies show that the Senate may have heard more from America in the week leading up to the passage of President Clinton's budget than ever before.
More than 3.6 million calls were routed through the Senate switchboard from Monday, Aug. 2, to Friday, Aug. 6, said Patty McNally, the Senate sergeant-at-arms.
On Aug. 4 and 5, the final days of the President's "do or die" budget debate, nearly one million calls came through each day.

Competition starts each day at 1 P.M., with finals beginning about 7 P.M.
Sixteen of the United States' top-ranked athletes will try for a medal in their respective divisions, and they include three New Yorkers: Lai Vo, Bobby Leach and Peter Bardatsos.
It will take about six fights to advance to the medal round, with a loss bringing elimination from the tournament.


Can My Baby Sleep Upright Safely?
To the Editor:
Re "Sleeping Face Down Seems to Put Babies at Risk, Studies Say" (Science Times, Aug. 10):
As the parent of a newborn, I both craved and loathed sleep.
Sleep may have served to restore my spirit, but it could take my child.
While I was awake, I could continually check to see if my prone baby was still breathing.
But if I slept while my baby slept, who would be the sentry?
If I slept, I thought, my baby might die.


Tax Break to Aid Museums
In large part because a van Gogh portrait of a troubled 19th-century doctor is now on the wall of a Japanese collector instead of in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the United States tax code has been substantially revised to encourage donations of artworks to museums instead of their sale on the market.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, pushed through the change in the law, which President Clinton signed this month as part of the budget package.

Judge Calls Summons In Nassau 'Defective'
Ira J. Raab concedes that he was breaking the law when he pulled into a crowded parking lot last March and chose a police-only spot.
He says upon returning to his car and seeing the $15 ticket issued by the Nassau County police, he was not surprised and was prepared to pay it.
But then, Mr.
Raab, a former New York City Parking Violations Bureau judge, noticed something that might not only save him money but that he thought would also ultimately invalidate every parking ticket the county has issued for years.

The End of the B.C.C.I. Case?
After years of investigation and four months of trial, a New York State jury has acquitted the Washington attorney Robert Altman of misleading bank regulators about the dealings of the notorious Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The verdict is a major defeat for the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert Morgenthau, who clearly failed to deliver on his promise to prove that Mr.
Altman and his mentor, Clark M. Clifford, helped cover up the illegal takeover by B.C.C.I. of First American Bankshares in Washington D.C.
Both Mr.
Altman and Mr.
Clifford, who was too ill to stand trial, claim vindication.
Yet their satisfaction needs to be tempered by remorse.
Both men put their good reputations on the line for some obviously shady characters.

Giants Are Striving for Team Chemistry

Schools Try to Tame Violent Pupils, One Punch and One Taunt at a Time

When the United States Open gets under way in 11 days, the show will have to go on without three familiar champions who share 11 Open titles.
For differing reasons, the five-time champion JIMMY CONNORS, the four-time champion JOHN McENROE and the two-time defending champion MONICA SELES will not be competing when the Open celebrates its 25th anniversary.
The 40-year-old Connors, now ranked 187th, is concentrating on starting his Champions Tour, a three-stop senior series that debuts in New Albany, Ohio, Aug. 25-29.
But Connors has not offically turned down the wild card offered him by the tournament's director, STEVE DEVOE.
The unofficially retired McEnroe, ranked 179th, is pursuing an exhibition-and-broadcast-only tennis schedule and has not requested a singles or doubles wild card.
Seles, the Open's defending champion, is still recovering from the knife wound she received in Germany on April 30 and doesn't plan to rejoin the Kraft Tour until October.


New Era in Design Materials
FOR the 1990's, materials for the background of a home -- the walls, floors and windows -- are as alluring and richly colored as the furniture that usually dominates any imaginative room.
In the living room, the kilim on the floor may have to compete for attention with the curtain -- a translucent panel of nearly weightless cloth with a subtle shimmer of stainless steel.
In the bathroom, the footed tub may look very plain against a slate floor in pale gray streaked with colors ranging from honey to gold to garnet.
A window in the foyer may be a mosaic of panes tinted in blues that shade from the hue of a winter sky to robin's egg blue to cobalt tinged with purple.


Corrections
A chart on the Education page yesterday comparing teachers' average salaries omitted a key in some editions.
For each country or city shown, the shortest bar showed starting salary, the middle-length bar was the mid-career salary, and the longest bar was the top salary.


EGYPTIAN MILITANTS BLAMED IN ATTACK ON SECURITY CHIEF
A bomb that Government officials said had been planted by Islamic militants exploded near Cairo's busiest square today, apparently in an attempt to assassinate Egypt's new Interior Minister as his motorcade drove past.
The explosion was one of the boldest and best planned in the continuing war between the militants and the Government.
Four people were killed and at least 15 wounded, the Government said.


CHRONICLE
There must be something the monumentally prolific QUINCY JONES has not done since he started out in the late 40's playing jazz on the trumpet for the likes of Count Basie and Lionel Hampton.
He went on to become a song writer, an arranger and a conductor and eventually composed the scores of 47 movies.
He has been nominated for 96 Grammys and has won 25 times.
He produced the Michael Jackson album "Thriller." He has produced many movies and television shows.


Pledging Allegiance to Earth
MARION LEONARD has been an environmental activist for more than 60 of her 84 years.
She recalls her father saying that the environment was being polluted.
"People thought we were crazy," she said.
That was in the 1920's.
She said her current goal is "to see an Earth Flag flying with an American flag on every flagpole."


Kisio Finds a Home at Calgary
KELLY KISIO, looking to go home and be close to his family, signed a multiyear contract as an unrestricted free agent with the Calgary Flames.
Last season, with the San Jose Sharks, Kisio matched a career best with 78 points (26 goals, 52 assists). (AP)


Tapes Bring Auburn Penalties
Two years after Eric Ramsey, a former Auburn defensive back, revealed that he had spent three years secretly taping various coaches discussing illicit payments to him and other players, the National Collegiate Athletic Association imposed heavy penalties on the school's football program yesterday, including a two-year ban on post-season play and a one-year ban on televised games.
Relying heavily on Ramsey's tape recordings, the N.C.A.A.'s Committee on Infractions cited a series of "very serious major violations" in placing Auburn on probation for two years.


Tanana Gets a Triple, A Thrill and Triumph
Forty-year-old Frank Tanana hit his first career triple tonight.
It occurred with the bases loaded, and by the time he hoofed into third base, dizziness had set in.
By comparison, Tanana's 239th career pitching victory was unexhausting.
He yielded five hits in eight innings, had an eight-run cushion by the sixth inning and eventually a 12-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds at Riverfront Stadium.


Seth Kantor Is Dead; Reporter, 67, Fought To Protect Sources
Seth Kantor, a Washington correspondent whose steadfast refusal to disclose his sources led to court tests that defined the concept of "qualified privilege" for journalists under the First Amendment, died on Tuesday while undergoing tests in a Washington hospital.
He was 67.
The cause was cardiac arrest, the hospital said.


Critic's Notebook; Diminishing Returns in Misery Race
High among the reasons given by Palestinian deportees for accepting Israel's offer to let about half of them back into the occupied West Bank and Gaza next month was the deportees' lack not of food or shelter but of coverage by the news media, meaning television.
The hundreds of men stranded in rough country between Israeli and Lebanese army checkpoints aroused initial sympathy from television news, but viewers have not seen much of them in recent months.
A Palestinian spokesman attributed the diminished attention to a purposeful blackout by the United States, but it probably has more to do with the competition for the camera's interest in a time of upheaval around the globe and hard going at home, and possibly with a developing viewer resistance to powerful images on the screen.


Market Place; BTR Realty's Plan to Convert to a REIT Attracts Arbitragers.
AFTER BTR Realty Inc. reported abysmal second-quarter results earlier this month -- revenues fell and per-share losses more than tripled those of a year earlier -- its stock hit a 52-week high two days later.
What's going on?
The answer has two parts.
First, the ailing patient is a real estate company, so earnings are less important than other numbers, like cash flow.
Second, the company is converting from a traditional corporation to a real estate investment trust, taking advantage of the market's current adoration of anything with the initials REIT.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY  DINKINS AIDES CRITICIZED ON CONTRACT
The city's Department of Investigation has said that senior members of the Dinkins administration improperly granted special access to a data-processing company that was seeking a contract to take over many operations of the city's Parking Violation Bureau.
A1.
The company involved in the parking bureau scandal that dogged the Koch administration in the 1980's is again the subject of criticism.

Bond Yields Continue Their Slide
With long-term yields plunging to another record low yesterday, John R. Williams, the managing director of global market economics at the Bankers Trust Company, thinks defense when he looks at the bond market rally.
This does not mean that he is being defensive because he expects the rally to end soon.
Rather, defense means military budgets and the cuts in them that have been made here and abroad.
For Mr.
Williams, those cuts are a major reason the economy has slowed here and will continue to be sluggish.
That, he said, is the main reason the 30-year bond yield has plunged to new lows.


Swimmers' Rash Is Traced to a Sea Creature
The cause of an itchy rash called seabather's eruption, which can appear after a swim in the ocean, has apparently been found, two scientists on Long Island are reporting in a medical journal today.
The rash, which appears where the skin had been covered by a bathing suit, has been traced to the larvae of a sea anemone, which use their stingers to inject a toxin after they become trapped in the bathing suits, Dr.
Anita R. Freudenthal and Dr.
Paul R. Joseph reported in The New England Journal of Medicine.


Dow Above 3,600 in Wide Rally for Stocks
Falling interest rates, rallying stock markets in Europe and strengthening investor interest in drug and consumer-product issues combined to lift American stock indexes to record highs yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed above the 3,600-point level for the first time, gaining 17.88 points, to 3,604.86.


Economic Scene; The Justice Department is Trying to Spread the Antitrust Blanket.
CONSPIRACIES to restrain trade are illegal.
So when, say, a tractor maker is caught leaning on retailers to keep the price of a new model above $30,000 or frowning on one dealer who tries to take away business from another, it must be in trouble.
Right?
Not necessarily.
Economists have never worked up much enthusiasm for untangling "vertical" restraints between producers and distributors, as opposed to "horizontal" restraints among sellers in the same market.
And in the Reagan and Bush years, that ambivalence became official policy.


'Dateline NBC' Is Again Accused of Being Unfair
For the second time this year, the broadcast news magazine "Dateline NBC" has come under fire from one of its subjects, this time a North Carolina eye clinic that notified NBC yesterday that it intended to sue the network.
Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, said the network considered its reporting on the clinic to be fair and accurate.


Bridge
The only operational computer network bridge game, so far, is the Sierra Network, now renamed the Imagination Network after being acquired by Sprint.
It is still one of the last refuges in North America of traditional rubber bridge, although Chicago scoring is expected to be introduced soon.
On the Imagination deal shown, the South player, Phillip Martin of Bronxville, N.Y., was able to convert a part-score into game and rubber with the help of an Imagination play.
In view of the part-score, East should no doubt have bid four diamonds, knowing that his partner held minor-suit length.
That contract would have failed by just one trick, and three hearts was headed for the same fate.


8 Finalists Named In IBM PC Review
The IBM PC Company said yesterday that it had narrowed to eight finalists the review for its estimated $80 million American and European advertising account.
The finalists, which include the incumbents, were culled from a list of 11 American and 16 European agencies.
The eight are: BDDP Worldwide in Paris; the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago; Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif., and New York; DDB Needham Worldwide in Paris; GGT/GGK in London; Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein in San Francisco; Lintas Worldwide in New York and London, and Merkley Newman Harty in New York.


Reporter's Notebook; Europe's Passion for Baroque
The dominant composer at this summer's Salzburg Festival is Claudio Monteverdi, and that is no accident.
Gerard Mortier, the festival's artistic director, is a modernist, and the modernist sensibility has long prized music from before the Romantic era.
Modernists since between the world wars have prized old music in general and Baroque music in particular because they heard its clean-lined, rigorous structuralism as a welcome antidote to the bathos of Romanticism.
But the modernist enthusiasm hardly accounts for the plethora of prominent, critically applauded stagings of Baroque opera that have taken place all season throughout Europe.


High-Tech Golf Scene: A World of Par Wars
It is Year 3 of the Big Bertha Epoch, in honor of the oversized metal wood driver (and subsequent 7-wood, or Heaven Wood) that has turned the Callaway Golf Company into a 10-year-old enterprise worth $850 million by the calculations of its Georgia-bred founder, Ely Callaway.
So here was the 73-year-old Callaway, relaxing in a director's chair in the Anaheim Convention Center, three Berthas and a Mizuno oversized wood grasped in his left hand, rambling on about why his legal staff spent considerable time at the PGA International Golf Show last weekend slapping legal papers on clonemakers and counterfeiters allegedly infringing upon Bertha's uniqueness.


Essay; Court's Greatest Hits
If the Supreme Court gets angry at you, can it take you to court?
Yes.
In 1906 the Court ordered a stay of execution of a black man found guilty of raping a white woman in Tennessee, pending its review of an appeal.
When a mob then lynched the defendant, the angry Supreme Court issued a contempt citation against the local sheriff for not protecting the accused.
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, in U.S. v.
Shipp, made clear the Court had the power to direct discipline on its own motion.


Barna Ostertag, Theatrical Agent, 91

G.M. and VW: A Summer Laff Fest
Ever since the Investment Banker Follies lost their appeal, it's been hard to find diverting entertainments of the commercial sort.
But Volkswagen and General Motors have been trying hard to fill the gap.
It seems the two wounded auto giants have something in common besides difficulty in competing with the Japanese.
They have settled on a Basque engineer named Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as the King Midas of small-car profitability.
Mr.
Lopez had turned G.M.'s Opel into a money maker in Europe.
VW, which loses money every time it sells a Golf, set out to woo him.
The story has everything, including pork-barrel politics.
G.M. had reneged on fulfilling Mr.
Lopez's boyhood dream by building a super-modern auto plant in his hometown in Spain.

Housing Progress Demanded; Child of the Public Projects, She Now Runs Them
One of the first things that Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero did after she was pressed into service as head of the nation's largest public housing agency last year was to take a series of unannounced trips around her realm.
What she found, she says, was a far cry from the public housing of her childhood.
Mrs.
Hernandez-Pinero, who in the 1960's lived with her family in the Twin Parks West project in the Bronx, saw a succession of crumbling walls, broken appliances, leaking pipes, stairwells without lights and tenants who complained that crime had made them prisoners of those same dreary homes.
Those sights, she says now, defined her sense of what she had to do.


Corrections
A chart on Monday, with an article about the acquittal of Robert A. Altman on charges stemming from the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, rendered the name of a defendant in a related case incorrectly in some editions.

Zabriski Shoots a 66 For Met Open Lead
Bruce Zabriski has won just about every major golf tournament in the metropolitan area this season.
Now he is out to capture the Met Open, whose list of winners includes Walter Hagen, Gene Sarazen and Byron Nelson.
Zabriski took a giant step toward joining that list today at the Quaker Ridge Golf Club with a course-record four-under-par 66 that gave him 137 for a three-shot lead going into Thursday's final round of the 78th Met Open.


A 2-Pound Gym (Sweat Optional)
A HOME exercise "gym" these days can fit into an overnight case and have the versatility of a weight machine many times its size.
The jury is still out on whether these systems, which use stretch cords for resistance, build strength to the same degree as free weights or weight machines.
The home exercisers are portable, of course, and cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars less than machines, but do they do the job?
One company, Lifeline International of Madison, Wis., says its apparatus works as well as weights.
It began producing its stretch-cord apparatus in 1977.
Through the years, its product has been revamped into a sophisticated, durable exercise tool.


SARAJEVO STATUS SETTLED IN TALKS
The three parties negotiating an end to the Bosnian war formally approved a plan today under which the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, would be demilitarized and administered by the United Nations for two years.
The plan, which was developed by international mediators, would go into effect only as part of an overall peace agreement.
But the agreement reached today removed an important stumbling block in the latest round of peace talks here among the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, nationalist Serbs and nationalist Croats.


A Former Insurance Executive Is Named New Chief of Empire
Moving to end a period of management turmoil, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield yesterday named G. Robert O'Brien, a former executive of the Cigna Corporation, as its fourth chief executive in three months.
The appointment of Mr.
O'Brien, who was in charge of managed care networks at Cigna, underscores Empire's intention to transform itself into a leader in managed care.
The networks limit the choices of doctors and hospitals and tightly control costs.
Currently nearly all of Empire's 7.6 million customers hold traditional insurance policies, which permit them virtually unlimited choice.


In Its Staid Way, Island Is Agog Over Clinton
Vernon E. Jordan was trying to be discreet.
True, of all the shirts in his wardrobe, the President's close friend and adviser had chosen to wear the blue polo with the White House insignia.

Jordan, who has been coming to Martha's Vineyard for 20 summers, is the point man for the Presidential visit.
Everyone, that is, except Mr.
Jordan.


Robert Engel, Banking Executive And Church Leader, Is Dead at 61
Robert G. Engel, a retired executive of J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, died Tuesday night in El Paso while visiting friends.
Mr.
Engel, who was president of the Cathedral Church of St.
John the Divine, was 61 and lived in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J., and Manhattan.
The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.
He was en route to a board meeting of the Raychem Corporation in Menlo Park, Calif.


S.A.T. Scores Improve For 2d Consecutive Year
For the second year in a row, the average scores of students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test have risen, prompting test officials to be optimistic about continued improvement.
The average S.A.T. verbal score this year was 424, one point above last year's score, while the mathematics average was 478, a two-point rise over 1992, for a total of 902.
The highest possible scores are 800 on each, and the lowest are 200.


A Different Kind of Stand-Up Comedy


Brooklyn Man Shoots 2 Officers and Is Arrested
Two police officers, responding to a call that a building superintendent had attacked a woman and then armed himself with guns inside his apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, were shot and wounded yesterday afternoon when the man fired at them through his door, the police said.
With scores of backup officers poised across the street, facing his windows on the first floor, the man, identified as Sebastian Sipila, maintained a silent standoff with the police that began around noon and continued until 8:15 P.M., when officers took him out of the apartment strapped in a gurney but uninjured.
Negotiators placed calls to his apartment only to have someone answer the telephone but not say anything.
Later, the police said, the phone was taken off the hook. 3 Calls to 911
Meanwhile, one of the wounded officers, Andrew Hill, 29, was in serious but stable condition at Bellevue Hospital Center with a gunshot to the groin area.
The other, Richard Bosetti, 41, was treated and released after suffering a graze wound to his right forearm.


Florida Girl, 14, Wins Right Not to See Biological Family
A Florida judge ruled today that Kimberly Mays, the teen-ager who has been the focus of a child custody dispute since it was discovered she was switched at birth with another child, may remain with the man she considers her father and has no obligation to maintain contact with her biological parents.
The judge, Stephen L. Dakan of the Sarasota County Circuit Court, declared that Ernest and Regina Twigg, who want visitation rights to the child they consider their own, "have no legal interest in or right to Kimberly Mays" and that the 14-year-old girl's wish never to see them again must be honored.


Capital's Political Culture Destroys the Best; Which Antidepressant?
To the Editor:
Many years ago, when a play of mine bombed on Broadway and I was feeling understandably blue, my doctor prescribed the then-popular antidepressant Miltown.
A few days later, finding myself for the first time in my life on the verge of jumping out the window, I decided to stop taking the stuff.
Within hours I felt better, and have never felt remotely suicidal again, not even after what Paramount did to my novel "Sliver."


10,000 Jobs To Be Cut By Kodak
The Eastman Kodak Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 10,000 jobs throughout the company by the end of 1995, but the plan may be a precursor to more drastic cost-cutting by a new chief executive.
The plan, intended to save $2.6 billion from the beginning of this year through the end of 1995, was announced by Kay R. Whitmore, who was deposed as chief executive by outside directors on Aug. 6.
He is remaining on an interim basis until a successor is named.

Father of 12 Shot to Death Near Home In Brooklyn
A father of 12 who was returning home from work as a dishwasher at an expensive French restaurant was shot and killed in a robbery yesterday, less than a block from his front door in Brownsville, Brooklyn, the police said.
Watching from a window of the first-floor apartment for his father's nightly return minutes after midnight, one of the man's eight sons saw his father clutching his chest, then collapse on the sidewalk.


80's Scandal Unraveled In a Suicide
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the New York City investigators' report released yesterday is not the finding that city officials showed favoritism in how they awarded a municipal contract, but the fact that the award went to one of the very same companies that helped plunge city government into scandal in the mid-1980's.
How could this happen?
Yesterday's report devotes more than 200 pages to trying to explain.
The original scandal entangled the Parking Violations Bureau, the same agency involved in yesterday's report.


NPR Names New President
National Public Radio today named Delano E. Lewis, a telephone executive, as its president.
He succeeds Douglas J. Bennet, who left NPR to join the Clinton Administration as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations.
Mr.
Lewis is president and chief executive officer of the Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Company, the Bell Atlantic subsidiary that serves the Washington metropolitan area.
Mr.
Lewis, who is 54, has been with the telephone company for 20 years.
Before that he worked as a lawyer for the Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, served in the Peace Corps and worked as a Congressional aide.


Dr. Charles P. Bailey, 82, Pioneer In New Methods of Heart Surgery
Dr.
Charles Philamore Bailey, an innovative heart surgeon, died yesterday at his home in Marietta, Ga.

Bailey formerly worked, said the Bailey family had reported only that the doctor had died of natural causes.


A Different Bo Jackson Is Back With White Sox
Bo Jackson sat at his locker in the Chicago White Sox clubhouse yesterday with a bandanna around his head and a small bandage on his hand.
Jackson was getting ready to return soon to the White Sox lineup, from which he has been absent for the last six games because of injury.
The injury has nothing to do with his famous hip.
It had more to do with his infamous motorcycle, or one of the three he owns.
Jackson was repairing his vehicle when it fell.
As he tried to catch it, it ripped his right hand.
"It was a dumb, dumb thing to do," said Jackson.


Edberg Is Bombed in New Haven
Even though he has won only one tournament this year and played in only one event in the past six weeks, Stefan Edberg did not appear to face any danger against the relatively unknown David Vacek tonight in his opening match in the Volvo International.
After all, Edberg is ranked third in the world and was both the defending Volvo and United States Open champion.
In addition, the 27-year-old Swede has won 37 titles, including six Grand Slam singles championships.
The 22-year-old Vacek, from the Czech Republic, is ranked 105th and has never won a pro tournament.


More Troops Needed in Somalia, U.N. Chief Says
Somalia is returning to normal, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today, but there is still a need for 3,000 more troops for the United Nations peacekeeping force there.
"Humanitarian assistance is reaching its destinations, protected from attacks and looting," the Secretary General said in a report to the Security Council.
"People are going about their normal business. Schools are reopening. Land is being tilled, crops are being planted and livestock even being exported."


CHRONICLE
Despite a sisterly warning that Washington can be an unforgiving place, BETSY MYERS, a sister of DEE DEE MYERS, the White House press secretary, is joining the Clinton Administration as executive director of the Office of Women's Business Ownership in the Small Business Administration.
In a joint interview conducted at their parents' home in Santa Clarita, Calif., and published yesterday in The Los Angeles Times, Dee Dee Myers, who is a year younger than Betsy, 32, warned her sister that Washington left "no margin for error" and that "there is no tolerance for trying to do things differently."


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Ailing Sanchez Vicario Gains  After a five-minute rubdown to soothe an injured right shoulder, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, the defending champion, beat Laura Golarsa of Italy, 7-5, 6-2, yesterday to reach the third round of the Canadian Open women's tennis tournament in Toronto.
Sanchez Vicario said she suffered a stretched muscle early in the match, an injury that all but eliminated her service game.
Her Italian opponent broke serve three times in the first set and once in the second.
But Sanchez Vicario broke Golarsa four times in the first set and three times in the second.
Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina made her first tournament appearance a winning one with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 decision over Lisa Raymond.
In a disappointing match for the fans, Helen Kelesi of Canada was beaten, 6-2, 6-3, by 11th-seeded Amanda Coetzer of South Africa.
Tracy Austin's heralded return to the professional tour after playing sparingly in the last 10 years was dealt a setback in a 6-4, 6-1 loss to 12th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France. (AP) Ferreira and Reneberg Gain: Eighth-seeded Wayne Ferreira and No. 11 Richey Reneberg wasted little time yesterday in advancing to the third round of the $1.04 million United States Hardcourts tournament in Indianapolis.
Ferreira routed a qualifier, Cristiano Caratti, by 6-0, 6-1 in 43 minutes, losing only six points on his serve.
Reneberg capitalized on 33 unforced errors and needed 65 minutes to eliminate Derrick Rostagno, 6-1, 6-4. (AP)


Rangers Sign Defenseman
DOUG LIDSTER, the 32-year-old defenseman whose rights the Rangers obtained from Vancouver on June 25 as part of the trade for JOHN VANBIESBROUCK, was signed to a new contract by New York yesterday.
Terms were not revealed.
Lidster has played all nine of his National Hockey League seasons with the Canucks.
Also, BOB FROESE, the Rangers' goaltending coach the last two seasons, changed teams but not states yesterday.
The 35-year-old Froese was hired by the Islanders to coach their goaltenders, one of whom is RON HEXTALL, the netminder who took over from Froese in Philadelphia in the 1986-87 season.


Chavez Drawing a Crowd
More than 42,000 tickets have been sold for the Sept. 10 triple-header boxing championships in the Alamodome in San Antonio.
DON KING, the promoter, says a capacity crowd of 75,000 will attend the pay-per-view event.
It features JULIO CESAR CHAVEZ challenging PERNELL WHITAKER for the World Boxing Council welterweight crown.


Vatican Hopes to Widen Influence With U.S.
Since Pope John Paul II's recent visit to the United States, the Vatican senses an opportunity to forge a new relationship with the Clinton Administration that will enable it to exert a "moral authority" in world affairs, officials in the papal entourage say.
"Now that there is no longer an ideological battle, what dimensions are there in world affairs apart from the political and the economic?" asked an official who insisted that he not be named.


Corrections

Books of The Times; Examining the Insidious Effects of Computers
The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality  By Michael Heim
175 pages. Oxford University Press. $21.
Back in the momentous year of 1968, an image from Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi epic "2001: A Space Odyssey" summed up society's fears of the dawning computer age: HAL, the cozily named renegade computer, quietly running amok and trying to seize control of a spaceship for its own diabolical ends.


Ismail Nears Signing
RAGHIB (ROCKET) ISMAIL will sign with the Los Angeles Raiders in the next 7 to 10 days, his agent said yesterday.

Nuggets-Magic Trade
In a trade involving three players troubled by injuries, the Denver Nuggets today sent TODD LICHTI, ANTHONY COOK and a second-round draft pick in 1994 to the Orlando Magic for BRIAN WILLIAMS.
Lichti, a 6-foot-4-inch guard, averaged 6.9 points and 2.1 rebounds a game last season.
He missed the last 27 games after tearing a knee ligament March 2.
Cook, a 6-8 forward, missed all of last season after rupturing a knee tendon during training camp.

Texas Instruments Plans Large Expansion
Texas Instruments Inc. today became the latest American chip manufacturer to announce plans for a huge new factory in anticipation of continuing strong worldwide demand.
The company said it planned to spend $750 million to $1 billion through 1998 to build a 624,000-square-foot factory at its headquarters complex in north Dallas that will produce next-generation microchips, which store and process information in computers and other electronic products.
The first phase of the plant will cost $300 million and will be paid out of the company's internal cash flow.


O'Neil Is Leaving NBC To Join Investor Group
After four years as executive producer of NBC Sports, TERRY O'NEIL resigned yesterday to join a group trying to buy a major sports franchise.
With his contract having expired recently, O'Neil said he had been musing about becoming part of an investor group, an effort that "generated its own energy in the last two to three weeks."
And the chance to acquire a sports franchise superseded O'Neil's desires to remain at NBC, even though he will be giving up a chance to be part of NBC's return to baseball next year and to produce NBC's telecast of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
O'Neil has jumped from ABC to CBS to NBC over the last 22 years.
Continuing as a producer, O'Neil said, "certainly is not a present interest for me."


Review/Rock; Edgy, Cool Steely Dan Back on Stage and Tour
As timing goes, now would hardly seem to be the right moment for the first Steely Dan tour since 1974, which came to Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night.
Pop music has veered sharply away from everything the group's core, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, cared about most.
Instead of Steely Dan's cool, subtle, meticulous, elegantly ironic songs, matching oblique lyrics to harmonically ambiguous jazz chords, the rock mainstream has turned toward noise, simplicity and blunt impact.
Where Mr.
Becker and Mr.
Fagen could agonize for months over perfecting a smooth transition, hip-hop has brought sudden jump-cuts instead.
The band's influence has survived mostly in pop-jazz tunes that saunter along, half-heard, on background-music radio stations.
Steely Dan camouflaged its subversive edge a little too well.


Review/Art; A Multi-National Approach to Characterizing the Americas
Although "Ante America" ("Regarding America"), at the Queens Museum of Art, is billed as a show of Latin American art, it could easily be subtitled "contemporary art from a few countries in the Southern Hemisphere, sort of." Artists from Colombia, Cuba and Mexico account for more than half of the 27 participants, while, somewhat mysteriously, artists from Haiti, Jamaica and North America who are not of Hispanic descent are also represented.
Eccentricities of distribution matter little, however, given the strength and variety of the work on view.


For Haitian Immigrants, Radio Remains a Passion
When Guy Victor planned a protest three years ago to rally Haitian-Americans against a Federal Government policy that barred them from donating blood, he estimated that, at most, 2,000 people would participate.
Instead, more than 50,000 showed up.
"Sincerely, I was shocked," said Mr.
Victor, the former president of Haitian Enforcement Against Racism, a Brooklyn-based human-rights organization.
"We did not anticipate such a large crowd."


X Marks the Spot for Elliott
Left tackle Jumbo Elliott has apparently agreed to terms on a three-year contract and is expected to join the Giants on Sunday, according to his agent, Marvin Demoff.
Demoff said yesterday that Elliott was made a "fair and good offer" by Giants General Manager George Young.
Demoff described Young's offer as a "breakthrough" in negotiations and said Elliott would sign.
Demoff would not say how much money was offered, but the amount apparently would make Elliott one of the highest-paid offensive linemen in the National Football League.


Review/Film; Recalling Tosh's Music, And Its Pointed Message
When the Jamaican reggae star Peter Tosh was slain by three gunmen at his home in September 1987, there were rumors of a conspiracy to silence the singer and songwriter, whose music cried out against colonialism and racial injustice.
Tosh, who was 42, had been hoping to buy a Kingston radio station in order to broadcast Rastafarian reggae music full time.
Some speculated that his enemies, alarmed at the prospect, had him assassinated.
The murder, which was officially ruled to be robbery related, is re-enacted near the end of "Stepping Razor-Red X," Nicholas Campbell's flashy but confusing biography of the singer.
In pseudo-cinema verite style, the camera lurches wildly up the stairs of his house to the room where Tosh and his common-law wife, Marlene Brown, were having dinner with friends.
Screams and gunfire erupt.


Inmates Volunteering for Execution: California Killer's Case Fan Debate
David Mason abandoned his appeals, dismissed one lawyer determined to save his life and hunted for another willing to fend off what he called the anti-death penalty "industry." Then he declared that he had found "a pool of peace" by rushing toward his scheduled execution.
But now the convicted serial killer is seeking to take a step back from the gas chamber.
In court papers filed today, Mr.
Mason asked for a stay of his execution, scheduled for Tuesday.
Instead, he said, he wanted a new trial because of alleged misconduct by his original lawyers -- a conflict discovered by the very "industry" the condemned man has criticized.


Oil Spills as Nuclear Sub Hits a Tanker Off France
A French nuclear submarine has collided with a supertanker off the south coast of France, tearing a hole in the tanker's hull and causing oil to spill into the Mediterranean, officials said today.
A spokesman for the French Navy said the accident occurred on Tuesday night while the submarine was surfacing and that it had failed to detect the enormous vessel overhead.
He said the navy sub, the Rubis, which normally carries missiles and torpedoes, had damaged its nose but suffered no nuclear leakage.


A PENNANT TRIES TO GROW IN THE BRONX
Can the Yankees catch the first-place Blue Jays?
Will the Blue Jays allow themselves to be caught?
Can the American League East even be called a two-team pennant race yet?
Maybe, maybe and probably not are the answers to the above questions.
They are questions that will linger as the final 40 games of the season are played and the Yankees, Red Sox and maybe the Orioles continue pursuing the Jays.
The second-place Yankees, who have not spent even a day alone in first place this season, could be boosted or buried by certain developments as they attempt to slice their two-game gap.
Ways to Boost Yanks' Chances ABBOTT AND PEREZ
Significant contributions from Melido Perez and Jim Abbott.
The excuses are growing old.
Solid starts and games that could have or should have been won by these two underachievers are no longer important, only victories are.
With about eight starts each left, both Perez and Abbott need to pitch supremely better than .500 for the Yankees to continue contending.
They are a combined 15-21 with a 4.38 e.r.a. after both had e.r.a.'s under 2.90 last season.
They need at least 10 victories in their last 16 starts to make their winter bearable.
GETTING CLOSER TO A CLOSER
Rob Dibble, Rick Aguilera, Dennis Eckersley and Bryan Harvey.
Those intriguing reliever names have been floated and others are likely to follow, but none are likely to float onto the Yankee roster before it is set for post-season play in 11 days.
General Manager Gene Michael has been adamant about not trading away prospects so the new-look bullpen with Bob Wickman and Paul Assenmacher in prominent roles could remain intact.
DEPENDING ON DON MATTINGLY
Perhaps this is finally his year, the year when he finally plays in the post-season.
Perhaps, but his robust bat cannot stop spraying hits just yet.
Enjoying a 53-game splurge that has seen him hit .369 with 12 homers and 54 runs batted in, Mattingly must do more and more.
Or, at least more of the same over the final 40 games.
ROAD WARRIORS
Playing above .500 on the lonesome road.
They have lost 16 of their last 25 on the road.
They play 22 of their last 40 on the road.
Figure out the statistics and the odds are not good for a stylish conclusion to their road schedule, but it is needed.
Starting Monday in Chicago, the Yanks must play better than their .475 percentage and win at least 12 of their last 22 away from home.
That includes a journey to Toronto on Sept. 24-26, which they hope will still be meaningful.
Ways to Bury Yanks' Chances A SLUMP BY JIMMY KEY
He is the best the Yankees have.
He is 15-4 with a league-best 2.83 earned run average and is fighting Jack McDowell for the Cy Young Award.
But his glorious season has not been so glorious lately.
Key is 3-2 with a 4.47 e.r.a. in his last six starts after surrendering 22 earned runs and 50 hits in 44 1/3 innings.
For Jimmy Key, he is struggling.
The Yankees need him to regain his form he displayed so consistently for much of the season.
A LOSING STREAK AT HOME
The Stadium has been a haven for the Yankees.
They have won 30 of their last 40 games in the Bronx and have the second finest home record in the league.
That cannot change.
The Yankees and Blue Jays have a somewhat similar schedule over the final six weeks, with each playing 22 of their final 40 games onthe road but New York stil has to play the A.L.
West-contending White Sox, Royals and Rangers 15 times while Toronto plays the lowly A's and Angels and stumbling Mariners 19 games.
OFFENSE PETERS OUT
Mike Stanley and Paul O'Neill have provided the Yankees with timely hits all season.
Make that until the last two weeks.
Stanley, who could end his season today with the best statistics of his professional life, has no homers, three runs batted in and a .205 average in his last 14 games.
Is the grind of the season catching up with the former backup catcher?
O'Neill, once second in the league in batting, is 5 for his last 31 to shrink 13 points off his average and lower it to .312.
Is .300 still within reach?
INJURY TO TARTABULL
Manager Buck Showalter can burn inside about Tartabull playing only one game in the outfield since July 15 because of a shoulder injury, but he should really just be thankful that Tartabull can swing a bat.
If Tartabull remains healthy enough to hit, the Yankee lineup remains healthy.
Do you think Mattingly's resurgence has anything to do with having Tartabull behind him?
Sure it does.
Since the last time Tartabull played right field, he has hit nine homers and driven in 32 runs to help the Yankees go 21-11.
Ignore that Tartabull is clogging up the designated hitter slot and leave him there.


Beijing Journal; China Raises a Great Wall: Can Dissident Scale It?
Han Dongfang's greatest hope is not the stuff of most people's dreams.
He simply yearns to be deported back to China.
But Mr.

Hours after he returned to China, the Chinese police seized him, roughed him up and ejected him to Hong Kong.

We Must End Crowded Housing, a TB Breeder
To the Editor:
The decision of New York City to require families to remain doubled up or tripled up in overcrowded, dilapidated housing (news article, Aug. 12) has another dimension, which should not be overlooked -- the contagion of tuberculosis.


PLEA ON SANCTIONS BY YUGOSLAV CHIEF
The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia has accused the United Nations of "genocide against the people" in continuing to enforce economic sanctions against his country.
In an interview the Prime Minister, Radoje Kontic, angrily condemned what he considers the injustice of continuing the sanctions, which were first imposed in May 1992 and were tightened in April.
They had been imposed because Serbia, one of the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia, was deemed an aggressor in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
But he said the United Nations force there had said "not one Yugoslav soldier" was in Bosnia.


No Time For Aguiar To Shank A Punt
Louis Aguiar thought he did a good job of punting for the Jets last year.
His net average of 37.6 yards and 22 punts downed inside the 20-yard line was third best in the American Football Conference.
But on draft day Aguiar found out just how much security he had when the Jets selected Craig Hentrich of Notre Dame in the eighth round.
Punters are not the kind of players that teams select with draft picks.
Most come as free agents.
This was serious.

Member states of the United Nations have heaped new responsibilities on the organization.
The danger, expense and scale of new operations exceed anything in the U.N.'s history and are unique in the record of international affairs.


Uncovered Short Sales Rise 5.5% on Big Board
Spurred in part by merger activity, the number of shares sold short rose to a record on both the New York and American exchanges in the latest month, the exchanges reported yesterday.
The New York Stock Exchange said the overall short position for trades in the month's period ended Aug. 6 was 1.096 billion shares, up 5.5 percent from the previous period's figure of 1.039 billion.


Saudi Jetliner Deal Is Seen
Senator Patty Murray of Washington said today that President Clinton had told her the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation were expected to win a $6.2 billion aircraft order from Saudi Arabia's national carrier.

At the Bar; Want to improve your marketing skills? Ask for advice from an Ann Landers for hapless lawyers.
You've heard of "Sleepless in Seattle." But how about "Clientless in California" or "Hustling in Houston"?
Deep down, many of those lawyers attending a party given by the Morristown, N.J., law firm of Pitney, Hardin, Kipp &amp; Szuch at the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum during the recent convention of the American Bar Association in New York were not all that happy about their work.
Only 44.4 percent of them, in fact, said they would "definitely or probably" encourage their children to follow in their footsteps.


Egypt Says Two Guerrillas Were Killed by Their Own Bomb
The police said today that two of the men responsible for a bombing attack against Egypt's Interior Minister on Wednesday died from the explosion that killed three other people and wounded 16.
Security officials arrested 20 other suspects in connection with the assassination attempt.
One of the two dead bombers was at the top of Egypt's most-wanted list of terrorists and was actually being tried in absentia for an earlier terrorist attack, the police said.


Champion Freedom in Peru
Peru's present version of democracy is the most restricted in South America, thanks to President Alberto Fujimori's 1992 coup that abolished an elected congress and intimidated critical voices in the press.
And its human rights record is also the continent's worst, as Mr.
Fujimori's actions to eliminate judicial independence and abolish procedural safeguards compound problems generated by a notoriously abusive military.
Prisoners are often held incommunicado, tried in secrecy before faceless judges and denied effective legal representation.
And while fewer people mysteriously "disappear" from streets and villages than in the recent past, many still do, often with apparent military involvement.


Coal Mine Sends Polluted Water Into Ohio Creeks
Here in this economically depressed Appalachian region of Ohio, the Southern Ohio Coal Company is saving a flooded coal mine by pumping a billion gallons of polluted waste water into 75 miles of streams and creeks that flow into the Ohio River.
Now in its 19th day, the waste water is painting the creeks the color of coffee or tea with cream, and in its wake the discharge is killing all aquatic life and posing a threat to an endangered species of mussel in the Ohio River.


Raise Capital Gains Tax and Cut Deficit
To the Editor:
The extraordinary buoyancy of the stock market, now trading at its highest levels, gives the Government an opportunity to reduce the deficit without hampering economic growth.
Americans are estimated to hold something like $1.25 trillion in unrealized capital gains.
The wealthy, who hold most of this, don't need to sell to pay the rent or other living expenses.
They will hold on to their appreciated assets -- and pay no capital gains taxes, perhaps ever -- unless they have incentive to do so.


A Nemesis Revisited; For Dinkins, the Toughest Question In a Scandal Is What Took So Long?
As Mayor David N. Dinkins responded this week to an official report that harshly criticized his senior aides for giving preferential treatment to a company that won a $150 million contract to collect New York City parking fines, he said, "New Yorkers may well feel angry," and added: "That is understandable. I am angry, as well."
But yesterday Mr.
Dinkins's opponents, and more than a few of his own aides, were asking in one way or another, "What took you so long?"

2 Picked to Promote Health Care and Trade Pact
President Clinton and the Democratic National Committee picked party veterans today to rally support for two top Administration goals this autumn -- overhaul of the health care system and Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
President Clinton chose William M. Daley, a Chicago banker and brother of the city's Mayor, Richard M. Daley, to head an Administration task force to sell the free-trade agreement on Capitol Hill and to the public.


Review/Design; Women, Machines And Sexual Revolution
"MECHANICAL Brides," the new show at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, presents a feminist interpretation of 20th-century appliances for home and office.
More important, perhaps, the show offers a revealing look at the museum itself.
As the first show organized by Ellen Lupton, Cooper-Hewitt's new curator of contemporary design, "Mechanical Brides" suggests that the museum is eager to experiment with new curatorial approaches.
And that is a very welcome sign.
The field of design is in desperate need of fresh perspectives.
Historically, Cooper-Hewitt's mission has been to celebrate design.
Its shows have held up objects its curators have found worthy of public esteem.
But, like other arts institutions in recent years, the museum now aspires to take a more critical stance toward its subject matter.
That aspiration holds particular significance for a museum of design.
If it wants to be more than a trade show for market commodities, a design museum must find effective ways to demonstrate that a curator's role differs from a salesman's.

She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla.
Mrs.
Martineau had been visiting a friend in Washington, Conn., when she entered the hospital.
The cause of her death was complications from bronchial pneumonia, her family said.


Isles' Mullen Will Have Heart Surgery
Brian Mullen of the Islanders, who suffered a mild stroke on Aug. 11 at his Long Island home, learned yesterday that he will have to undergo minor heart surgery sometime next month and will be forced to miss hockey's upcoming regular season, and maybe even the post-season.
Mullen, a popular 31-year-old forward, was a key to the Islanders' playoff success last season.
He is being treated at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, and doctors said he had returned to normal health after experiencing problems with his motor skills.

Metropolitan Opera To Adjust the Score On Using Supertitles
After years of refusing to consider the use of supertitles -- projected translations of opera texts -- the Metropolitan Opera has abandoned its objections.
In a major change of policy, the company has been experimenting with a title system that its officials hope will overcome both technical and philosophical problems.
The system may be in place for the opening of the 1994-95 season.
The company's attitude change was reflected in a speech that Bruce Crawford, the president of the Metropolitan Opera, made in June to a group of donors.
A transcript of Mr.
Crawford's speech appears in the September issue of Opera News and was reported yesterday in Newsday.


Large Increase In Trade Deficit Startles Experts
The nation's trade deficit widened sharply in June to $12.06 billion, the largest in more than five years, as exports shrank and imports rose, especially in trade with Western Europe.
The sheer size of the June shortfall startled trade experts, who had expected only a modest increase from the May deficit.
"That's just unimaginable -- holy moly," said Wayne L. Berman, a former Commerce Department official and senior campaign aide for President George Bush, when told of the June deficit.


Review/Dance; In Celebration of Philadelphia
In a continuing celebration of Philadelphia and its artists, Lincoln Center Out of Doors presented three soloists and one company on Wednesday afternoon at the Fountain Plaza.
All were winners of Pew Fellowships in the Arts.
To judge from the three solos that opened the program, dance in Philadelphia is a matter of quiet, rather abstracted musings on movement and its expressiveness.
Steve Krieckhaus's "Entering and Spreading," performed to a peaceful hum of a score by Steve Berkowitz, offered a chance to watch a gifted artist work his way through the smallest curls, leans and lilting walks.
The solo was a minimalist journey through time, with surprisingly strong dynamic changes and even a sense of building drama given the refinement and slow pace of the dance.


Bonds Rally On Report Of Trade Gap
The bond market rallied across the board yesterday on the back of surprisingly downbeat economic news in the June merchandise trade report and on some relief that the Clinton Administration may have moved to halt the decline of the dollar against the Japanese yen.
The yield on the 30-year bond, in what is becoming a routine development, dropped to another 16-year low.
But more importantly, the rest of the bond market rallied, pulling the yield on the 10-year note to a new 20-year low and the yield on the 5-year note to its lowest level since 1967, according to monthly averages kept by Salomon Brothers.
Exports Fall
The unexpectedly large jump in the June trade deficit to $12.06 billion came, in part, at the expense of American exports, which fell 3.3 percent.
And economists were quick to conclude that the surprisingly steep drop could mean that the growth in the second quarter of the year, which was initially reported to be 1.6 percent, will be cut back to as low as just six-tenths of 1 percent at an annual rate after adjustment for inflation.

Letter; Demise of Egyptian Tourism Is Exaggerated
To the Editor:
"Islamic Guerrillas Take to the Hills in Egypt" (news article, Aug. 12) states that, as a result of extremist activities, tourism to Egypt has been "wiped out." This is untrue.
From January to June 1993, 1,197,753 foreigners visited Egypt, 74,695 from the United States.
In June alone, 201,119 foreigners visited the country.

Last Salvos to Be Fired In Iran-Contra Inquiry

Walsh.

Abortion Doctor Wounded Outside Kansas Clinic
Dr.
George R. Tiller, whose clinic in Wichita, Kan., was at the center of a series of fiercely emotional protests over abortion in 1991, was shot outside the clinic yesterday by a woman whom the police said was seen passing out anti-abortion literature earlier in the day.
Dr.
Tiller, who was dressed in operating garb, was wounded in each arm but was not seriously injured and was released several hours after minor surgery, the Associated Press reported.
He was apparently backing his car out of the clinic driveway when the woman approached him and fired several shots.
She fled and was not immediately caught.


Bronx Series Finale
The Bronx Arts Ensemble's concert series Summermusic '93 ends on Sunday with two free chamber-music concerts in the Bronx, at 2 P.M. at the Rockwood Drive Circle in Van Cortlandt Park (near Broadway and Mosholu Avenue), and at 4 P.M. at the McGinley Center of Fordham University, Rose Hill Campus, at Southern Boulevard.
The pianist Kenneth Cooper and the soprano Josephine Mongiardo are the guest soloists.
They will be accompanied by members of the Bronx Arts Ensemble: Gerald Tarack, a violinist; Mitchell Kriegler, a clarinetist, and Leo Grinhauz, a cellist.
The ensemble will perform Milhaud's Suite for Violin, Clarinet and Piano, Rimsky-Korsakov's "Hymn to the Sun" from "Le Coq d'Or," Beethoven's Trio in B flat for Clarinet, Cello and Piano, and two mazurkas by Chopin, arranged for voice and piano by Pauline Viardot-Garcia.

Review/Music; Scriabin, Chopin and More In Pianist's Debut Recital
Alan Gampel is a cultured, beautifully educated young American pianist who appears to thrive on complexity and become somewhat undone by music that is nakedly simple.
With a velvety sound that gauged the small playing space perfectly, Mr.
Gampel made his New York City recital debut at the Frick Collection on Wednesday afternoon.
He thrived on the Scriabin Second Sonata and Chopin's Variations on "La ci darem la mano," but seemed more than a little uneasy in Schubert's Impromptus (D. 899) and the Schumann "Faschingsschwank aus Wien."
When Scriabin's florid, ever-moving detail or Schubert's rhythmic left-hand accompaniments locked Mr.
Gampel's melodic movement into place, the pianist became a sound interpreter.
When confronted with unadorned melody, however, he seemed at a loss.
The Intermezzo from the Schumann, for example, is phrased in one dramatic breath: an upward leap and downward swoop toward dissonance and resolution; Mr.
Gampel draws back in mid-plunge, totally dismantling the effect.
Similar interruptions undid the tensions of the earlier Romance section.
Ritards, accelerations and accentuation, in other words, must sound absolutely necessary to a performance.
Mr.
Gampel sprinkled them around Schubert as if by whim, like an interior decorator rearranging tchotchkes.

TV Weekend; Whitaker Directs Tale of Walking on the Wild Side
Around the housing projects of Brooklyn, as you can learn tomorrow night if you listen carefully, "strapped" means carrying a gun.

Diquan (Bokeem Woodbine), who has done time upstate, is resolved to stay out of trouble, but his messenger job doesn't pay enough for him to put up bail.
What follows in this two-hour HBO movie is a fairly simple moral tale, despite plot complications drawn from local headlines.


New High for Dow in Heavy Trading
Stocks were mixed yesterday, as investors consolidated their positions after strong gains the day before.

The stocks that led the rally on Wednesday, including drug issues, came under early selling pressure from profit taking yesterday, but recovered.


Conservative Candidate: Angry Elbow to Giuliani's Right
When George J. Marlin called himself "the conservative Republican candidate for mayor" at a recent housing forum, the partisan audience erupted in catcalls and laughter.
But Mr.
Marlin, who is actually the Conservative-Right to Life candidate for mayor, was not joking or mistaken.
He was firing a barb at the man who would follow him on the podium, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor.

The boys from Egypt arrived in New York City on Tuesday, the ones from Jordan on Wednesday and the Palestinians and Israelis on Thursday.
There are 50 boys in all, and they will spend more than two weeks in the United States getting to know each other.

In a revival effort, Thom McAn's new campaign tries to overcome childhood memories.

The Thom McAn Shoe Company must be thriving in today's back-to-basics Zeitgeist.
Or it would be had its owner, the Melville Corporation, not let the look of the stores -- and the shoes they sell -- decline into outdated, frumpy unfashionableness.


Norman Becomes Shock Resistant
No one in golf has had more practice at getting over major disappointments than Greg Norman, and from all indications, he is getting very good at it.
While it took the 38-year-old Australian several years to completely get over his shocking losses in the 1986 PGA Championship and the 1987 Masters, his words and actions in recent days point to complete recovery from his sudden-death loss to Paul Azinger last Sunday at the PGA Championship.

Review/Film; Two Women With Secrets Talk and Talk
Claude Chabrol's slow, deliberate, exceedingly strange "Betty," which opens today at Cinema Third Avenue, has the feeling of a short story building up to one all-important twist.
As based on a novel by Georges Simenon, "Betty" does culminate in a discovery, but still its closing moments do not entirely illuminate what has come before.
Mr.
Chabrol's talky, contemplative study of two women, strangers whose lives become unexpectedly intertwined, is finally incomplete and not entirely satisfying.
But to a large extent its eerie intelligence compensates for that.
Mr.
Chabrol finds a quiet fascination in these two women and their slowly revealed secrets.
Betty (Marie Trintignant), first seen in a state of extreme dissipation, was once the prim and ladylike Elizabeth.
But the facts of her previous life seep out very slowly, as she throws herself into the process of hitting bottom.
Drinking and smoking furiously, bedraggled in her once-matronly clothes, Betty winds up in a bar called the Hole being picked up by a man who, quite matter of factly, tells her she has worms under her skin.
The whole film has the quality of a dream that may be interrupted any moment by a different reality.

Long-Secret Navy Devices Allow Monitoring of Ocean Eruption
For the first time, scientists have closely monitored the explosive fury of a deep-sea volcanic eruption, thanks to a super-secret system of underwater listening devices that the Navy has recently begun to share with civilian experts.
"This technology is opening a whole new window into a dark ocean," said Dr.
Stephen R. Hammond, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration program that made the observations.
He spoke at a news conference here today.


Company Resurrected Itself With the Arrival of Dinkins
In 1986, the president of the Datacom Systems Corporation admitted in Federal court that his company had paid bribes to obtain a data-processing contract with New York City's Parking Violations Bureau.
The company was precluded from further city contracts.
But early this year Datacom -- renamed Lockheed Information Management Services, headed by a new president and sporting a self-described new image -- re-emerged from its exile as the Dinkins administration awarded the company a contract, valued at $150 million to $200 million over five years, to run many operations of the Parking Violations Bureau.
A Lobbying Campaign
How a company that was disgraced just seven years ago, when it was implicated near the heart of the municipal corruption scandals, managed to resurrect its standing and ultimately win an extremely lucrative city contract is the story of a well-calibrated corporate lobbying campaign, one that begins within days after Mayor David N. Dinkins assumed office in January of 1990.


Mets Seek a Meeting Before a Coleman Move
The Mets' legal counsel, David Howard, said today that he is trying to arrange an "investigatory interview" with Vince Coleman in New York on Monday or Tuesday.
The interview presumably would be attended by Gene Orza of the Players' Association and Richard Bry, Coleman's agent, along with representatives of the commissioner's office and the Mets' ownership.
Howard said the Mets were "more than willing to listen" to Coleman's view of the incident last month in which he ignited and threw an explosive device out of a parked car at Dodger Stadium.
Three people were injured in the blast, and Coleman's arraignment on a felony charge was postponed until Oct. 8, after the baseball season.

1994 Cap Is Influencing 1993 Giants
The National Football League's salary cap hasn't even been put into effect yet, but it has already become a source of dread for teams across the league.
The Giants are included in this group and with good reason.
Right now, at least, they are so far over the projected cap that it will very likely have a drastic effect on roster decisions this year and could prevent them from seriously entering the free-agent market after this season.
According to a salary survey obtained from the Players Association this week, the Giants' 1993 veteran payroll is $38,533,500, the fourth highest in the league and over $4 million above the projected salary cap of $32 million to $34 million.
The figures, dated July 30, do not include draft picks and unsigned veterans.

Democratic Fortress Speaks Up for Whitman
Mayor Bret Schundler, a Republican, today threw his support to Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor.
He said his endorsement "largely forecloses any possibility that Jim Florio will be re-elected."
A Republican's endorsement of a Republican is not ordinarily news, even on the slowest summer news day.
But this is Jersey City, the Cooperstown of political hardball in New Jersey.
Mr.
Schundler is a former Democrat, all nine of his successful running mates for City Council in the election in May are Democrats, and four were on hand today to announce the formation of a Democrats for Whitman organization.

Carvel Foundation Is Sued Over Sale of Stock
Executives entrusted with doling out part of the Carvel ice cream fortune to charity squandered hundreds of thousands of dollars and created a sweetheart stock deal for Carvel Corporation employees, State Attorney General Robert Abrams charged yesterday.
Mr.
Abrams sued the Thomas and Agnes Carvel Foundation and two of its directors in a bid to remove them from the charitable foundation's board and force the repayment of more than $1 million.


U.S. Tries To Halt Fall Of Dollar
The Clinton Administration seemed to put out a stop sign yesterday on the precipitous decline of the dollar against the Japanese yen, trying to halt it through dollar-buying by the Federal Reserve and jawboning by the Treasury.
The apparent sudden shift in the Administration's outlook and the Fed's dollar purchases in the currency market caught traders by surprise, causing a sharp rally in the dollar.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar jumped 4.22 yen, or 4.15 percent, to 105.85 yen, the strongest the American currency had been since the end of July.
In Tokyo early on Friday, the dollar slipped to 104.60 yen.

An Advanced Technology To Read Data
A group of I.B.M. scientists has developed a new method for manufacturing a sensitive device for reading magnetic information stored on computer disks, making it possible to store and retrieve 30 times more information than on today's disks.
The discovery is likely to accelerate the rate at which disk-drive manufacturers are able to increase the density of the information on their magnetic disks.
Currently it is possible to store information at densities of about 350 million bits a square inch.
I.B.M. researchers predict, however, that they will now be able to reach densities of 10 billion bits a square inch by the end of the decade.

The nation's trade deficit widened sharply in June to $12.06 billion, the largest in more than five years, as exports shrank and imports rose, especially in trade with Western Europe.
The size of the June deficit startled experts, who had expected only a modest increase from the May figure of $8.38 billion.  [ Page A1. ] Markets

Israel Drops the Veil
There will be something startlingly different, in form if not substance, when the stalemated Mideast peace talks resume in Washington at the end of the month.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has bravely consented to the breaching of one of Israel's most emotional taboos.
Israelis will negotiate directly with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Mr.
Rabin says Israel is meeting with individuals, not an organization, but all parties recognize this as a significant change.
There's still a big gap between Israeli and Arab bargaining positions, and Secretary of State Christopher's recent trip to the region didn't do much to narrow it.
Yesterday's bloody exchanges with Party of God guerrillas in Lebanon didn't help either.
But for Mr.
Rabin, talking to Palestinians with P.L.O. titles is a political and diplomatic gamble worth taking because it just might open some previously locked doors to peace.


Market Place; Shaky Ground Beneath the Peaks

Hidden Bombs Kill 9 Israelis On Patrol in South Lebanon
Islamic militants renewed their attacks on Israeli forces in southern Lebanon Thursday, killing nine soldiers on patrol in two separate bomb attacks in the most deadly assaults on Israel's troops there in years.
After the first attack, which killed seven soldiers and wounded two, Israeli warplanes retaliated with strikes against bases near the Syrian border of the Iranian-backed Party of God, whose guerrillas said that they had killed the Israelis.
Two guerrilla deaths were reported but not confirmed in the air raids, which Israel said took place away from civilian areas.


Alternatives Are Studied On Class Sites
New York City's Board of Education began yesterday to search for other places where children might attend classes when school starts next month, as the prospect of completing an emergency inspection for asbestos by the opening day of Sept. 9 appeared increasingly unlikely.
The board's president, Carol A. Gresser, and the interim Schools Chancellor, Harvey Garner, joined officials heading the emergency inspection to reassure parents of the city's 1 million schoolchildren that the school year would begin on time.
But they acknowledged that some classrooms and even entire schools would be closed, raising the specter of double sessions of classes and chaotic shuffling of students to other buildings like libraries, colleges, museums and office buildings.

Nutri-System Franchisees Consider New Course
As two new potential buyers have emerged for Nutri-System Inc. -- which is operating under bankruptcy-law protection -- the owners of Nutri-System franchise centers, which are not controlled by the company, are independently pursuing an affiliation with other diet companies.
At a bankruptcy court hearing in Philadelphia on Wednesday, a lawyer representing Physicians Weight Loss Centers of America and the Calorie Shop Weight Loss Centers in Akron, Ohio, which are national franchise companies with a combined 134 centers, said the companies were prepared to pay at least $15 million in cash to acquire Nutri-System.


Pop/Jazz; The Fall Is Heading for a Rise, With a New Album
"We're very popular in Greece," says Mark E. Smith, the waspish lead singer of the Fall.
"They don't like anything over there, but they like the Fall. I mean, people like Sting can't get gigs there. No one knows how it happened." Speaking by phone from his home in Manchester, England, Mr.
Smith quickly telegraphs the mordant, skewed outlook that has given him and his band legendary status in the indie-rock world.
After 16 years and two dozen records, the Fall, which will perform at the Grand in the East Village tonight, defies all odds and keeps on going.
Its sound and personnel have changed many times; there was a grating-noise period, a sort of Minimalist anthem period, experiments in pop stylings, a ballet score and recently a tendency toward techno and reggae.
All along, Mr.
Smith has been the mainstay, seeking out like-minded musicians and maintaining his priceless vocal swagger.
Lyrics as Weapons
The man has a remarkable way with the English language.
He hoards words in spooky clusters -- "Jawbone and the Air Rifle," "Who Makes the Nazis?" -- and fires them at assorted targets, far and near.
The resulting damage can be either scattershot or frighteningly precise.

Back to School, Bearing Tales of the Flood

But one August ritual survived.
Today, school started at the appointed hour in a Baptist church a state and a river away from their own flooded school.

GlenFed Stockholders Back Bailout, Ceding Most Equity
In the largest private-sector bailout of a distressed savings and loan, GlenFed Inc. said yesterday that it had completed a plan to raise $425 million in new capital.
Shareholders of the ailing California savings institution narrowly approved the plan, under which they are to give up most of their interest in the company to keep it from being seized by Federal regulators.
GlenFed is the parent of Glendale Federal Bank, the country's fifth-largest savings institution, which faces a takeover by the Office of Thrift Supervision if it does not meet minimum capital standards by Sept. 30.
The bank must raise its core capital from 2.65 percent of its assets to more than 4.5 percent.
If this goes as intended, Glendale Federal would have core capital of 4.81 percent.


Medvedev Is Too Much For the Upset-Minded Ho
When he upset 34th-ranked Marc Goellner in the first round of the Volvo International tennis tournament on Tuesday, Tommy Ho said it was probably his biggest victory in a six-year professional career that has been marked by unfulfilled promise.
Today, the 20-year-old Ho was on the verge of an even bigger triumph, against 12th-ranked Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine.
Ho was serving for the match against the 18-year-old Medvedev and, at 30-30, was within two points of an upset.
But the 6-foot-4-inch Medvedev, the fastest-rising young player on the men's circuit, broke though at 30 to make it 5-5.
He then won the ensuing tie breaker, 7-2, and, against little resistance, swept all six games of the final set to prevail by 2-6, 7-6, 6-0 and gain the quarterfinals of the $1 million tournament.

The actress KIM BASINGER married the actor ALEC BALDWIN last night inside a circle of torches on a beach in East Hampton, L.I.
Among about 100 guests for the brief ceremony by the Atlantic were PAUL NEWMAN, BILLY JOEL, CHRISTIE BRINKLEY and CHYNNA PHILLIPS.
The wedding was held in front of the waterfront estate of the fashion designer JOSEPHINE CHAUS.
The 39-year-old bride and the 35-year-old groom entered a circle of smoothed sand at the water's edge at 8 P.M.
Seven minutes later, rose petals flew in the air as the couple enjoyed a long, romantic kiss.
The couple starred together a few years ago in "The Marrying Man."
The reception was held in a tent next to Ms.

U.S. BOMBS IRAQIS FOR FIRING AT JETS
In what the Pentagon called one of the most serious clashes since the end of the Persian Gulf war, Air Force jets today bombed an Iraqi battery that fired two missiles at American planes.
Allied jets patrolling the zones over northern and southern Iraq that are banned to Iraqi flights have engaged in a long-running cat-and-mouse game with Iraqi antiaircraft crews, trading missile and ground fire.


Easing the Pain of Divorce
Conceding that the legal system too often exacerbates the pain of divorce, New York State's Chief Judge, Judith Kaye, announced a strong set of reforms this week designed to protect matrimonial clients against unscrupulous lawyers and to expedite judicial treatment of divorce cases.
Her plan embraces most of the recommendations made earlier by a special 10-member committee of both judges and divorce lawyers.
It also owes much to a 1991 report by New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs.
That report detailed serious abuses, mainly against women clients, by lawyers who apply pressure tactics to collect fees, drive up prices by delaying tactics and keep clients uninformed about their cases.


Anheuser-Busch Plans an 'Ice Beer'
Anheuser-Busch Inc. said yesterday that it would become the first American brewer to introduce an "ice beer" in the United States.

King Case Sentences Focus Legal Debate
To the Editor:
Whatever view you take of Judge John Davies's treatment of the Los Angeles police officers Laurence Powell and Stacey Koon in "Tepid Justice in Los Angeles" (editorial, Aug. 7), the sentences bring to the fore the mechanics and complexities of Federal criminal sentencing guidelines.
Conflicting views over the judge's downward departure from the guideline range illustrate the difficulty of applying the guidelines to offender characteristics and the specifics of the offense.
Too often the debate is confined to offenders and circumstances that engender little public interest.


Miners Kill 20 Indians in the Amazon
Gold miners killed 20 members of a remote Indian tribe near Brazil's Amazon border with Venezuela on Sunday, officials of the Indian protection agency said today.

"What causes us great indignation and repulsion is that the murders were carried out with touches of cruelty and savagery."


Travers Entries Reflect Balance of Nonpower
Yogi Berra couldn't have said it better: Larry Robideaux Jr., the trainer of the speed horse Foxtrail, watched today as 11 rather evenly matched colts were entered in Saturday's $1 million Travers Stakes and observed: "Everyone has a 50-50 chance of winning this race."
In so many words, that seemed to be the consensus of the trainers who entered their horses in the 124th running of "the summertime Kentucky Derby." The primary reason for the unusual balance of power was that so many horses had fallen by the wayside en route to the Triple Crown last spring, and even now the 3-year-old class of 1993 has produced no dominant horse.

Review/Film; A Feminist Cross-Dresser in the Old West
It isn't every day that a movie reimagines the Old West in a vision as acute and provocative as Maggie Greenwald's astonishing film "The Ballad of Little Jo." In this feminist interpretation of the West, the frontiersmen have been stripped of any vestiges of a traditionally heroic machismo.
Instead of rough-hewn conquerors braving the unknown, they are pictured as dangerously unsocialized beasts stomping rapaciously through a rustic paradise.
And pity the woman who asks for their help.
Into this treacherous environment slips Josephine Monaghan (Suzy Amis), a young woman from a genteel Eastern family whose father has turned her out of his house for having an illegitimate baby.
Josephine heads West, and on the road she discovers that a woman alone is fair game.
In defense, she dons men's clothing and carves a vicious scar on her cheek.
Eventually arriving in Ruby City, a shabby mining village, she carries off a precarious male impersonation that becomes a lifelong charade.


The Mets Like Jones's Sharp Learning Curve
Bobby Jones threw his first curveball at the age of 9.
His Little League had outlawed the pitch.
But one day while his father, Bob Sr., was mowing the lawn, he stopped him, flipped him a mitt and asked him how to make a baseball dive.
A year or so later, the curveball ban was specially lifted for the Fresno (Calif.) Little League Championship game, and Bob Sr. -- a tobacco-chewing former catcher -- whispered to his son, "Since you can throw it, go ahead and throw it."


2 Years After Coup Attempt, Yeltsin Warns of Another
Two years after the attempted coup that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that another "reactionary putsch" was still a possibility, but that he was confident that the Russian people would reject a return to the past.
"Very painful transformations are in progress," Mr.
Yeltsin said.
"But the Russian people continue to be loyal to the choice made that August."
At a news conference in the Kremlin, Mr.
Yeltsin, in a jaunty mood, said he had already begun "an artillery barrage" against his opposition in the holdover Parliament.
He said he has prepared documents to force through new elections this fall to break the paralysis of government that has afflicted Russia for months.

Jordan Thanks the Public, but Scolds the News Media for Speculation
In his first public statement since learning last week that his father had been shot to death, Michael Jordan expressed gratitude yesterday for an outpouring of public sympathy, but chided some members of the news media for speculating that the death might have been linked to his own well-publicized gambling activities.
"Throughout this painful ordeal I never wavered from my conviction that Dad's death was a random act of violence," Jordan said in a statement issued through his lawyer in Washington.
"Thus I was deeply disturbed by the early reports speculating that there was a sinister connection to Dad's death. I was outraged when this speculation continued even after the arrests of the alleged murderers."

Review/Music; Contrasting Soloists at Mostly Mozart
The Mostly Mozart concert on Tuesday night at Avery Fisher Hall began ominously.
At the outset of Schubert's "Unfinished" Symphony, the festival orchestra's principal oboe and clarinet did not seem to be altogether in tune.
Paleness of tone plagued all the winds thereafter, and the strings occasionally wavered as well.
Gerard Schwarz signaled ambitiously broad pacing from the podium, but a flat, static performance was the result.
The opening and closing sections of the first movement held only a hint of Schubert's pervasive mystery and melancholy.
Next, Eugene Istomin came onstage for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4, and the situation stayed grim.
Mr.
Istomin's playing was clattery and uneven, shifting continually toward the loud end of the spectrum; he found the work's tensely reflective tone only in the closing measures of the second movement.
Despite wild applause from the capacity audience, which had earlier made its presence felt by dropping dozens of small to medium-size objects on the floor, this performance was not one for the scrapbooks.


Review/Film; A Holocaust Witness, Eloquent in His Silence
"The Last Butterfly" is one of the quietest movies about the Holocaust ever made.
Although many of its characters are Jews caged in the Czechoslovak ghetto city of Theresienstadt and face imminent deportation to death camps, you wouldn't know it from the way they talk.
Musing on their fate, they adopt the sorrowful-to-sardonic tone of Chekhov aristocrats lamenting the boorishness of modern life.
Everybody in the movie, including the Nazis, speaks in an impeccable "Masterpiece Theater"-style English that rarely rises above the volume of drawing-room conversation.
The mood of calm despair that hangs over the film lends it a disquietingly surreal aura.
But it also plays into the story, which describes an attempt to deliver a horrifying message without stating it in words.


Creepy Crawlies Are a Hit at Camp


Hunting to the Death When the Prey Is Human
Swishing, whooshing, lovingly photographed weaponry.
Nasty gurgles from the wounded.
The clonking sound of a head hitting wrought iron.
A bullet in the eye.
These are the cornerstones of "Hard Target," one of this summer's few super-bloodthirsty action films, and the one that actually stood a chance of rising above its genre.
"Hard Target" was an opportunity for both John Woo, the Hong Kong-born action-film director with an ardent cult following, and Jean-Claude Van Damme, the self-appointed Muscles From Brussels, to reach a mainstream audience.
"Hard Target" had a hard time getting past the Motion Picture Association of America's rating board without an NC-17 rating.
But even in this somewhat adulterated form, Mr.
Woo's film remains overwhelmingly violent and not always stylish enough to give its excesses the appearance of wit.
Not even when its star bites the tail off a rattlesnake and then slugs the snake for good measure.

Who's Behind the Lawyer-Bashing Campaign; I Take Pride in It
To the Editor:
I take great issue with Lincoln Caplan's negative portrait of lawyers and the legal profession (Op-Ed, Aug. 6).
Among other generalities espoused by Mr.
Caplan, he states:


Shoreham's Last Gasp Brings Issue of Options
As an army of workers prepares for the last stage in the painstaking process of decommissioning the Shoreham nuclear-power station, officials in charge of the project are beginning to grapple with perhaps the final question in the long struggle over Shoreham:
What do you do with an empty nuclear-power plant?


Murphy Returns
Two weeks after being dismissed by the Houston Rockets, CALVIN MURPHY is returning to the team's front office.
Murphy was dismissed Aug. 5 from his job as the team's community relations liaison and special assignments coach.
The Rockets said Murphy's charitable community service activities will be almost the same, although his marketing duties will be expanded. (AP)


Sensormatic
Shares of the Sensormatic Electronics Corporation gained in active trading yesterday.
Sensormatic, the world's largest manufacturer of electronic security systems for retailers, reported record results for the fourth quarter and the year.
The company said revenues from sales to supermarkets in the United States had more than doubled.


47 Candles and 3 Cakes for President
If this is what 47 looks like, imagine what 50 will be.
President Clinton celebrated his birthday for at least the third time today as he began the third leg of his vacation at a secluded seashore estate here.
He has been feted by his staff, by his old friends in Arkansas and received a birthday cake today aboard Air Force One.
He arrived here today with his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, to attend yet another celebration, this time at the summer home of his Washington friend Vernon E. Jordan.


The Asbestos Mess: Only the Tip
An emergency review of New York City's 1,069 school buildings has already identified 16 schools with potentially harmful asbestos.
But as the scandal unfolds -- replete with evidence of botched inspections and dismissals -- it's becoming clear that asbestos is only part of a much broader problem.
Just as the closing of the Williamsburg Bridge in 1988 dramatized the sad state of the city's bridges, the asbestos crisis has exposed the abysmal physical condition of the schools.
For example, a crumbling wall in which asbestos is found may be deteriorating because of a leaking roof.
But it hardly makes sense to contain the asbestos by re-plastering the walls without fixing the roof.


Creative Team Set For Mercedes Work
Scali, McCabe, Sloves Inc. of New York named a creative team yesterday for its portion of the Mercedes-Benz of North America account.


White House Moves on Easing Food-Pesticide Law
The Clinton Administration has detailed its opening position in a tussle to rewrite a longstanding law that prohibits cancer-causing substances from being added to food.
As signaled last February, the Environmental Protection Agency plans to weaken the law's absolute prohibitions but has now added ingredients that it says will bring about more efficient regulation of pesticides.


CHRONICLE
CONSTANTINE XII, the exiled King of Greece, said he has felt like a villain in a James Bond movie, hounded at sea by missile-firing vessels and a military airplane, The Associated Press reported yesterday.
Constantine was deposed after a coup in 1967, and he went into exile in London.
He is barred from setting foot in a populated area of his former country.
The ban was lifted briefly in 1981 so that he could attend his mother's funeral.


Connors's Mom Says He'll Play
What?
They're going to stage a United States Open without the tournament's own Peter Pan, Jimmy Connors?
Not if Gloria Connors, the tennis star's coach and conscience, has anything to say about it.
Whenever Jimmy runs home to mother in Belleville, Ill., it can mean only one thing: He's ready for her to whip him into shape for a major tennis tournament.
And this time, Gloria Connors said yesterday between monitoring her 40-year-old son's practice sessions, Jimmy has set his sights on returning to the tournament in which he has accumulated a resume that includes five titles.


Unemployed Man, 22, Is Arrested in Four Sex Assaults in Queens
An unemployed man from Queens was arrested on Wednesday in four sexual assaults since January that were primarily in Jamaica Estates.
The police said the man was under suspicion in other cases.
The suspect, Gary Heeralal, 22 years old, who has worked as a livery driver, messenger and mechanic, was seized at his house in Jamaica and identified in a lineup, the police said.
He faces charges of first-degree rape, first-degree sexual abuse, attempted sodomy, second-degree robbery and endangering the welfare of a child.


City Section Is Announced By The Times
The New York Times is creating a weekly section aiming to help readers more easily navigate life in New York City and its neighborhoods, the publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., announced yesterday.
The section, titled The City, will appear each Sunday, beginning Sept. 12, in copies of The Times distributed in Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.
The section is intended for readers and advertisers in New York City.
Its features will range from how-to columns to neighborhood news reports and in-depth examinations of issues affecting life in the city.

Dr. Leon Resnekov, 65, Is Dead; Leader in Treating Heart Disease
Dr.
Leon Resnekov, a cardiologist and Frederick H. Rawson Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago, died on Tuesday at the university-run Bernard Mitchell Hospital.
He was 65 and lived in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago.
He had long been ill but had kept teaching and seeing patients until a few weeks ago, the university said.


Review/City Opera; A 'Prince' With Debuts By 3 in Cast
The City Opera's two-week exhumation of Sigmund Romberg's "Student Prince" has two sets of singers in the principal roles, switching off from night to night.
The second group performed on Thursday night: Michael Hayes as the itinerant Prince, Laura Claycomb as his spring fling Kathie, and Robert Perry as the doomed Dr.
Engel.
All three young singers were making their City Opera debuts; given the particular demands of the Romberg manner, it's hard to pass judgment on their general operatic skills, but two of them showed promise.
Mr.
Hayes had a confident and accurate tenor, wooden at times but thoroughly idiomatic.
His acting was hardly less impressive; alongside his three Heidelberg buddies (of whom Gordon Gietz's Detlef deserves to be singled out), he artfully conveyed the obnoxious collegiate drunkenness crucial to Act II.
Ms.
Claycomb, a soprano, did not do quite as well, struggling with the high notes and making her character seem strangely feckless.
She missed the rousing, buoyant spirit appropriate to a number like "Come Boys, Let's All Be Gay Boys."


For Children
Queens County Farm Museum
73-50 Little Neck Parkway  Floral Park  (718) 347-3276  Recommended for all ages
Two Hampshire pigs and one Yorkshire pig in their muddy pen squabbled over a dead pigeon recently at this bucolic spot.
In a pasture, an Ayrshire dairy cow dozed while a Rhode Island Red pecked around its feet.
Muscovy and Pekin ducks, wild mallards and African, Toulouse and Canada geese roamed free around the seven-acre farmyard, which is a national and city landmark. (There are 47 acres altogether, with interconnecting paths.) French Alpine, Nubian and Toggenburg goats and Suffolk and Hampshire sheep nuzzled their fences for attention, or, perhaps, food.


Iraqis Fire Missiles, U.S. Jets Retaliate
In what the Pentagon called one of the most serious clashes since the end of the Persian Gulf war, United States Air Force jets bombed an Iraqi battery that fired two missiles at American planes.
Allied jets patrolling the zones over northern and southern Iraq that are banned to Iraqi flights have engaged in a long-running cat-and-mouse game with Iraqi crews, trading missile and ground fire.


A Weapon in Waiting; States Seek Approval to Test Rabies Vaccine Scattered in Bait
For seven years, as the wildlife rabies epidemic crept up the East Coast, infecting raccoons and threatening rural and suburban residents, Federal officials have been studying a weapon that stemmed the spread of rabies in Europe: vaccine-laced oral bait.
Now, with New York, Texas and other states pressing for permission to test the vaccine, the Federal Agriculture Department says it is still six months from granting final approval.


On Display in a Show at the Whitney, A Question of Ownership of Images
The artworks in "The Subject of Rape," an exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, are intended to be disturbing.
One untitled work certainly was for Donna Ferrato, because it includes, without crediting the source, four copyrighted images from her book "Living With the Enemy," a photographic essay on battered women and their children.
The book was published by Aperture in 1991.
The work at the Whitney, by Eva Rivera Castro, is a collage on canvas with images arranged in horizontal bands.
Along the top of the canvas are five identical photocopies of an image of a child pointing his finger angrily at a man who is being led away by the police.


BUDGET DIRECTOR OF NEW YORK CITY IS FORCED TO QUIT
The New York City Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, resigned at the request of the Mayor yesterday, one day after a city investigation determined that he had shown favoritism to a company seeking a $150 million contract to collect parking ticket fines.
Mayor David N. Dinkins announced Mr.
Michael's resignation yesterday at City Hall after a tense day of meetings with his top staff to fashion a response to the report, which asserted that his administration gave the company, Lockheed Information Management Services, unusual time and attention and special treatment.


King of the Hill; A Boy of the 30's With Grit and Wit
WHEN present-day movies try to recreate the Depression, they tend to concentrate on period details: old cars, quaint costumes, dusty rugs on boarding-house floors.
"King of the Hill," the new film by Steven Soderbergh, which has been adapted from A. E. Hotchner's boyhood memoir, captures something more basic: the way it felt to have that rug pulled out from underneath one without warning, and the recognition that most of one's acquaintances were trapped in similar situations.
With warmth, wit and none of the usual overlay of nostalgia, "King of the Hill" presents the scary yet liberating precariousness of life on the edge.
There is a point in the film at which Aaron Kurlander (Jesse Bradford), the story's 12-year-old hero, is so hungry he cuts out magazine pictures of food, arranges them on a plate and digs in.
In another film such a moment might be milked for either humor or pathos.
But Mr.
Soderbergh, as a film maker who keenly appreciates the idiosyncrasies of any situation, has a way of defying the usual expectations, and he turns that image into something surprisingly buoyant.
"King of the Hill" bears no substantial resemblance to either Mr.
Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies and Videotape" or his impenetrable "Kafka," but it does reaffirm the iconoclasm of both those earlier works.


Fisher-Price to Be Bought by Mattel
In a move that further consolidates the toy industry, Mattel Inc. and Fisher-Price Inc. said today that they would merge in a stock swap valued at about $1 billion.
Fisher-Price, a leading maker of toys for preschoolers -- including its chattering telephone and bubble-blowing saxophone -- would become a division of Mattel, the nation's second-largest toy company, which makes Barbie, Hot Wheels and Disney infant toys.


Review/Film; Brothers Fight Fire With Fire, in 'Wilder Napalm'
Somewhere on the cusp between the inspired and the flat-out unreleasable there is "Wilder Napalm," a bizarre romantic comic strip about two brothers and the woman they love.
Both Wilder and Wallace Foudroyant (Arliss Howard and Dennis Quaid) have the power to start fires telekinetically, which is why Wilder happens to be hairless beneath his proper-looking wig.
As for Vida (played buoyantly by Debra Winger), she wears only green and is stuck in her trailer under house arrest, so she has troubles of her own.
Wilder works timidly in a photo-processing booth in the middle of a parking lot.
Wallace makes his first appearance in a brightly colored clown suit, cursing his brother and playing to the rafters.
Wilder and Vida clearly live in their own little world of super-cute affectations, as when Vida says "Last night I dreamed we were Elvis and Ann-Margret in 'Viva Las Vegas.' " "Again?" Wilder asks wearily.
It takes a while to get past the realization that the whole film will be trying to sustain this level of whimsy.


George Brooker, 67, Real-Estate Official And Civic Advocate
George M. Brooker, a real-estate executive who served on New York City and state boards and led civic causes, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital.
He was 67 and lived in New Rochelle.

Who's Behind the Lawyer-Bashing Campaign; Caring Individuals
To the Editor:
The vilification of lawyers, as in "The Lawyers' Race to the Bottom"(Op-Ed, Aug. 6), fascinates and yet eludes me.
I grew up in a family of lawyers.
From my grandfather to uncles, my father, brother and cousins, I have always known this to be a profession of caring individuals who had the desire to help others and a commitment to jurisprudence.


Review/Photography; Discovering a Range of Motion in the Still Image
Whether it is considered a strength or a weakness, the fact that photography records single moments is usually regarded as a defining characteristic of the medium.
But "Multiple Images: Photographs Since 1965 From the Collection," the ambitious show now at the Museum of Modern Art, demonstrates that in recent years artists have worked eagerly and effectively to undermine that assumption.
"Multiple Images" shows how pervasive the idea of including more than one image in a single work has become.
The show, the first organized by Sheryl Conkelton, the museum's new associate curator of photography, includes work by Jan Groover, Andy Warhol, Robert Cumming, Richard Avedon and many other artists.
Judging from the works on view, perhaps the most frequent use photographers have made of multiple images has been to create what are in effect mini-movies, sequences of images that describe an event not in a single glimpse but as a series of moments.
Some of these works are explicitly narrative, using dramatic staging and lighting that suggest conventions of Hollywood genre films.


Cuomo Signs Clean Air Bill


Many Indian Movies in One
Movies rarely offer more rip-roaring action per minute than does "God Is My Witness," a three-hour epic adventure from India that is as crude as it is energetic.
The movie, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, wants to be an Indian answer to "Ben Hur," "Duel in the Sun," "The Desert Song," "Giant" and "The Seven Samurai," all rolled into one churning, palpitating package.
It opens with a game of buzkashi, a dangerous equestrian sport involving a dead goat, and closes with a version of the same game played with a live human.
In between, enough plot is jammed in to fill several seasons of "Dallas," along with a musical's worth of songs.


Another New Look for an Ever-Changing Cityscape


Review/Theater; A New Traveler Makes a Classic Journey Home
It is slightly disconcerting to realize that Ellen Burstyn is now playing old ladies.
Like most people who achieved their broadest fame in movies, she seems frozen in memory at the point when that fame was greatest, and one still thinks of her poised resiliently on the cusp of middle age, as she was in her Oscar-winning performance in "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore," nearly 20 years ago.
Still, if Mick Jagger can go ahead and turn 50, why shouldn't Ms.
Burstyn -- who has publicly sworn she will do one play a year, come what may -- be allowed to play Alfred Uhry's Miss Daisy, as she did in Chicago five years ago, or Carrie Watts, the slyly willful old woman in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful"?
The latter has been revived in a cleanly staged, sincere-minded production that began life at Theaterfest in Upper Montclair, N.J., and has now been brought by the Phoenix Theater Company to its Performing Arts Center on the State University campus here.
The laconically sentimental story of an aging Texas woman's dogged attempt to return to the country house of her youth before she dies, it has become legendary as a vehicle in which venerable actresses can soar.


Trial Starts in Beating of Truck Driver
This city's ugliest moments came back to life today in a hushed and darkened courtroom as a prosecutor opening a trial of two men charged with beating a truck driver in last year's rioting showed video images of bloodied people being dragged from vehicles, beaten and kicked and struck in the head with bricks and bottles.
"Certain days stand out in history," the prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Lawrence Morrison, said in his opening statement to jurors.
"We the citizens of Los Angeles will never forget April 29, 1992. We saw vicious and horrible crimes broadcast into our living rooms. In the next few weeks we will relive and experience some of those crimes through the testimony of the people that suffered."


Zabriski Notarizes It: He's Easily the Best
Any skepticism about Bruce Zabriski's superiority among metropolitan-area golfers will have to be erased after the way he captured the 78th Met Open today at Quaker Ridge Golf Club.
Every serious contender said before the tournament that a score of even par would be terrific and would probably win the $75,000 tournament at a course that is one of A. W. Tillinghast's marvelous creations.


Watch It, That's the Champ Who You're Calling Fat
Riddick Bowe brought his heavyweight title to Harlem yesterday, stepping out of his white stretch limousine to applause and some jeers.
"You're fat," someone in the crowd of about 200 shouted.
"He's out of shape," another fan called out in front of Sylvia's, the soul-food restaurant on Lenox Avenue and West 126th Street.





Review/Film; Of Miracles and Visions In the Realm of the Everyday
"Dinner time approaches and the paintings are getting hungrier and hungrier," warns Ellic (David Warner), one of many eccentrics who wander through Raul Ruiz's film, "Dark at Noon." The character is the superintendent of a very unusual factory in Portugal that manufactures one-size-fits-all prosthetic limbs.
Ellic is also a realist painter whose creations require regular doses of a potion brewed in his Frankensteinesque laboratory.
Such strange goings-on constitute the very texture of daily life as it is imagined in the newest surreal comedy by Mr.
Ruiz, the exiled Chilean film maker who has lived and worked in Paris since the late 1970's.
"Dark at Noon," which opens a one-week engagement at the Walter Reade Theater today, is one of the more complex and provocative of Mr.
Ruiz's absurdist fantasies.
Although it has many amusing moments, there is so much happening in the film that even viewers familiar with Mr.
Ruiz's inventive cinematic imagination may find it mystifying.

Who's Behind the Lawyer-Bashing Campaign
To the Editor:
In "The Lawyers' Race to the Bottom" (Op-Ed, Aug. 6), Lincoln Caplan gives the opinion that the public lacks esteem for the legal profession because lawyers are seen as greedy.
This is not the real cause of public discontent with lawyers.


Bosnia Peace Negotiators Continue Border Debate
With international mediators and the presidents of Serbia, Croatia and Montenegro trying to nudge them toward agreement, the Muslim, Serbian and Croatian parties to the Bosnian war spent six hours today debating the borders of their future ethnic republics.
There were conflicting reports whether any progress was made.
"A successful end to the negotiations is something I do not expect very soon," Alija Izetbegovic, the President of Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government, said tonight.


Diner's Journal
Yes, We Have No Pasta
In Italy, a rosticceria is a combination restaurant and catering shop, with different areas for roasted meats, antipasto dishes and other prepared food, pizza and desserts.
The ultimate example is Peck in Milan.
Now there is a place in Manhattan designed along these lines.
Da Nico, at 164 Mulberry Street, in Little Italy, opened two weeks ago with suckling pigs and rabbits turning on spits in full view, more than 20 dishes on the antipasto list, with many of them on display at the counter, and a coal-fired brick pizza oven.


Investments Can Offer Surprising Rewards
A BARGAIN is a bargain, even in the stock market.
Temporarily casting aside investing fundamentals like growth potential, individuals may find convincing reasons to buy a single share in some companies that offer discounts and other perks to shareholders.
Companies throw in these extras to make stock-owning pleasant, not to attract investors.
But if you're the kind of a person who's never opened a bank account without getting a toaster, consider this guide to getting your money's worth.
Remember that the broker's commission may add to the stock's price.
Cut-rate computers.
Although it is not a permanent policy, the Tandy Corporation has offered shareholders a 10 percent discount on purchases of up to $10,000 at its Radio Shack stores at Christmas.
In other words, one share of a $30 stock could save you up to $1,000.
Visit the track.
Horse-racing fans buying a single share of Santa Anita Realty Enterprises get six complimentary clubhouse tickets each year to its Santa Anita Race Track in Arcadia, Calif. -- a $39 perk for a stock trading at about $17.
Skiing for cheap.
A share of the Ralston Purina Company qualifies you for significant savings on skiing, lessons, equipment rentals and lodging at the company's resort in Keystone, Colo.
Two adults and two children skiing seven days could save almost $200 on lift tickets, and 20 percent on lodging if booked in advance.
Not bad for a $39 stock.
A break from Mickey.
This year, shareholders in Walt Disney can buy an annual gold-card membership in the Magic Kingdom Club, which offers discounts throughout the Disney empire for $39 instead of the regular price of $49.
A $10 break for a $40 stock.
If you keep the stock for four annual trips to Disneyworld and if the discount continues, you will make back your money, no matter what happens in Hollywood.
Lodging for less.
Depending on how often you stay at a Marriott Corporation hotel, buying the company's stock might be worth your while.
Shareholders are entitled to weekend discounts at many hotels and up to 50 percent off at Residence Inns.
Discounts vary greatly by location.
Potential savings: $10 off a weekend package at a standard Marriott, for a $28 stock.
Holiday gifts.
General Mills offers its shareholders a holiday gift box, priced last year at $19 (including shipping) but valued at twice the cost.
The box might contain goodies like Multi-Grain Cheerios, a Betty Crocker cookbook and the newest flavor of Hamburger Helper.
Saving about $20 a box, you will earn back the price of the $61 stock if you send the care packages to three people.
Vacation with Shamu.
Shareholders in the Anheuser-Busch Companies not only get a 30 to 50 percent discount on items in its merchandise catalogues (which can really fill out your collection of stuffed Clydesdales), they also get a 15 percent discount on admission each year to its entertainment parks, including Sea World, home to the whale Shamu, and Busch Gardens.
The stock is about $46, which means it would take two trips to the Orlando Sea World, saving a family of six about $27 each time, to cover your investment.


Military Falters On Prosecution In Sex Scandal
As they move forward with the Tailhook case, the Navy and Marine Corps are having trouble turning the initial accusations of sexual harassment and abuse at an aviators' convention into criminal charges or administrative punishment.
A Pentagon report in April accused 140 fliers of indecent exposure, assault and lying to investigators under oath, among other violations, but the Navy has already dropped half of its 120 cases outright, largely for lack of evidence.
Only five Navy cases and one Marine case have so far gone to a military grand jury or to a court-martial.


A Fight Over Altman's Legal Bills
No one looks forward to a lawyer's bill, and in that respect lawyers are no different from anyone else, particularly when the bill may reach well into the millions.
Consider Robert A. Altman.
Mr.
Altman was acquitted by a New York State jury over the weekend after a five-month trial on charges that he helped deceive banking regulators about the true ownership of First American Bankshares of Washington.


The Sound of Snoring at Empire
The board of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield slept while its chief executive, Albert Cardone, mismanaged the company and brought it to the brink of financial collapse.
The board failed to monitor Mr.
Cardone's performance, failed to intervene early when losses mounted and failed to dismiss him until adverse publicity left it no other choice.
Mr.
Cardone is now gone -- replaced by chairman Philip Briggs and chief executive G. Robert O'Brien, two energetic former executives of major commercial insurers.
But the somnambulant board remains.
By some accounts, members come to meetings late, indulge in trivial discussions and leave early.


Police Identify Body Linked to Joel Rifkin
The New York State police today identified the remains of a woman whose body they were led to by Joel Rifkin, the accused serial killer.
Lieut.

Advice and Philosophy With Provocative Edge
LET Peter Lynch argue that people can merrily find investment ideas among the products in their shopping carts.
Jack Bogle warns that even picking a mutual fund is a perilous venture, best handled by meekly settling for an index fund to match the market's returns.
The title of his new book, "Bogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent Investor," is meant to be exclusive.
"An intelligent investor, not a moron, is going to get a lot out of it," Mr.
Bogle said.


Regulated Senseless in New York City
Concerned about his children's health, Tony Benjamin asked the city for help.
It turned out to be a big mistake.
A year ago, in the midst of a lead-poisoning scare in the New York public schools, he and his wife had five of their eight children tested by a private lab.
Their youngest son, Elisha, now 2 years old, had a lead level of 25 micrograms per deciliter of blood -- right at the threshold of what is considered dangerous. (The other children's counts were high, but not dangerously so.)


Repairs Continue at the Bomb-Damaged Vista Hotel


Review/Pop; Singer as Songwriter, Admirers as Before
Because she has scored only one major hit in her 15-year recording career, the pop-soul singer and songwriter Brenda Russell is still not well known to the public.
That 1988 hit, "Piano in the Dark," a worshipful love song to a musician, stands as one of the more memorable adult pop ballads of recent years.
To connoisseurs of pop-soul music, however, Ms.
Russell, who performed at the Bottom Line on Thursday evening, was much admired before "Piano in the Dark." Earlier, Roberta Flack and Luther Vandross had popularized her ballad "If Only for One Night," and Donna Summer had recorded her brash angular dance tune, "Dinner With Gershwin." During the Persian Gulf conflict, Oleta Adams's recording of "Get Here," a pensive pop-gospel ballad of separation and longing, became a popular wartime anthem.


Don't Blame Sea Gulls For Bacteria in Water
To the Editor:
I found the solution to the mystery of the source of the bacteria in the New York City water supply system amusing.
Blaming sea gulls as the source is akin to certain historians attributing the fall of the Roman Empire to the use of lead water pipes.
It certainly strains credibility.
An equally plausible scenario could be the contamination of the Croton reservoir system.
Fortunately, only 10 percent of New York City's water is derived from this source.
Were it not for its dilution with other water from the Delaware system and the use of heavy chlorination, this water would not be usable.


Microsoft Antitrust Case Shifts
The Federal Trade Commission officially closed its antitrust investigation of the Microsoft Corporation today, but the Justice Department announced an inquiry of its own.
The F.T.C. told Microsoft in a letter dated today that it would take no action on accusations that the software manufacturer had engaged in unfair competition.
But the Justice Department, which asked earlier this summer to examine the evidence the commission had collected, said it would take up the case.

In a memorandum to President Clinton, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has made a strong case for a 25-cent rise in the Federal minimum wage to $4.50 an hour and an automatic annual adjustment in the minimum wage linked to inflation, the Labor Department said today.
But Mr.
Reich stopped short of recommending a specific course of action and said the agency would report on the pros and cons of such a policy before Oct. 20.


Nigeria Acts Properly to Contain Unrest
To the Editor:
Re your Aug. 11 and 13 news articles on Nigeria: There was no strike action in Lagos this month.
Some elements in support of Chief M. K. O. Abiola, who claims victory in the June 12 election, circulated statements threatening anybody who came out on the streets with death.
Bus and taxi drivers were warned their vehicles would be set on fire.
Consequently, many people did not go to work on Aug. 11, not in protest of the election but for fear of their lives.
The Government cannot stand by while these elements continue to create panic and insecurity.
Those responsible had to be detained to protect society's interests.


Israel-Lebanon Border Quiet on Day After Killings
A day after Islamic militants killed nine Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, the border was quiet today, confirming that Israel did not plan large-scale reprisals for now against guerrillas of the pro-Iranian group responsible for the deaths, the Party of God.
Security officials said the Israelis would most likely seek to avenge the roadside bomb attacks on Thursday that produced the highest single-day death toll for Israel's forces in southern Lebanon since the army carved out a strip of terrain there in 1985 and proclaimed it a "security zone" against strikes in northern Israel.


Israeli Chief Justice Blocks Deportation of Demjanjuk
Israel's Chief Justice blocked John Demjanjuk's deportation today, giving groups pressing for new war-crimes charges two weeks to make their case for a second trial of the man who was acquitted on appeal of being the Nazi death-camp guard known as Ivan the Terrible.
The Chief Justice, Meir Shamgar, gave no clue as to whether he thought a new trial was warranted, based on evidence that even if Mr.
Demjanjuk was not the monstrous Ivan, operator of the gas chamber at the Treblinka camp, he may have served as a guard at Sobibor, another Nazi extermination camp in occupied Poland.


Review/Pop; Minimal but Relaxed, And Very Out of Doors
This week the bravely eclectic Lincoln Center Out of Doors series is presenting visitors from Philadelphia.
Thursday evening brought members of Relache, a Philadelphia contemporary-music ensemble inclined toward Minimalism.
The name, meaning relaxation in French, has a sturdy Minimalist lineage: Erik Satie took it as the title for his 1924 ballet project with Francis Picabia.
"Relache" is also an appropriate term for late-August music making, since French stage bills have long used it to indicate "no performances, on vacation."
The first work on the program was the strongest: Robert Ashley's "Outcome Inevitable," written especially for this group and exploiting its distinctive array of instruments (flute, oboe, English horn, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, viola, double bass, percussion and keyboards).
A hypnotic pulse -- monotone quavers on the keyboard, soft syncopations on the drums -- provides the piece's rhythmic backbone.
Over it, the winds unfold short, sad tendrils of melody, one by one.
The bassoon is last in line, inflecting its somewhat broader solo with a jazzy warmth.
Mr.
Ashley is best known as a master of voice textures, but here he displayed a brilliant grasp of pure instrumental atmosphere.


Tokyo Journal; Admitting Guilt for the War: An Outraged Dissent
Half a century after World War II left more than 20 million people dead across Asia, Japan seemed to have turned a historical corner with its long-delayed admission that the brutal policies of the imperial Government brought on the suffering.
Accounts of atrocities that were long suppressed, admissions of responsibility and expressions of condolences finally broke through the decades of evasions.
"I myself believe it was a war of aggression, a war that was wrong," the new Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, said in a deceptively simple statement, the first of its kind.
It was just part of an outpouring of remembrances of the horrors Japan inflicted on the region in a war that is still the subject of surprisingly ambiguous feelings here.

Stocks Rise Near Close, Pushing Dow Up 3.35

CHRONICLE
The Walk of Fame at Madison Square Garden celebrates some of the most enduring stars in the fields of sports and entertainment.
The 25 plaques, set into the lobby floor near the box office, include the names of the basketball players Patrick Ewing, Larry Bird, Bill Bradley, Wilt Chamberlain, Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and the heavyweight boxing champions Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.
There is even a plaque in honor of Elton John.
But there are no women.


Tax Changes Shake Reliability of Trusts
The new tax law sharply increases income taxes on the trust funds commonly used by families to set aside money for minors and young adults.
The change, which has received little attention, raises questions about whether it makes sense to create a trust and how existing trusts should be managed.


No Confirmation Is Offered On Saudi Aircraft Orders
Despite signals this week from President Clinton that he helped get a $6.2 billion aircraft order from Saudi Arabia's national carrier for the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, no confirmation emerged yesterday.
Spokesmen at both companies had no comment on reports of the pending order, and officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington said they had no announcement to make.


Dinkins Blames 'Overzealousness' for Parking-Bureau Furor
Trying to put the furor over a parking-fine collection contract behind him, Mayor David N. Dinkins said he had no plans for further action against City Hall officials and angrily insisted the affair was not a "scandal" in the first place.
Speaking to a crush of reporters after a speech at Martin Luther King Jr.
High School in Manhattan, Mr.
Dinkins said news organizations had overblown a Department of Investigation report that accused his administration of giving preferential treatment to a company seeking a $150 million contract to collect city parking fines.


Sports of The Times; Sunshine? Baseball? Together?
MORE than three and a half decades after their departure from the Polo Grounds, the San Francisco Giants may have discovered a formula that can help a team and its fans find happiness near the banks of the Harlem River.
Their bold and surprisingly successful concept is as old as Doubleday's first game, and apparently not too outdated for our harried, computerized, microwaved existence.
Can day baseball be catching on?
In a creative effort to build upon the work that saved the franchise for San Francisco, the new Giants management handled a preoccupation with Candlestick Park's parking and security problems -- where have we heard this before? -- by listening to the customers.


World Hurdles Mark Falls to Welshman
For the American athletes in the world outdoor track and field championships, this was a night of glory, but not all of the glory.
Gail Devers won the women's 100-meter hurdles and achieved the sprint-hurdle doubles that eluded her in last year's Barcelona Olympics.
Dan O'Brien won the decathlon and Mike Powell the men's long jump, as they did two years ago in the last world championships.

SPORTS PEOPLE: FOOTBALL;
JEFF GEORGE, the Indianapolis Colts' disgruntled quarterback, will finally report to work and will pay $144,000 in fines for missing practice, the team said yesterday.
"The most important thing is to win," Coach TED MARCHIBRODA said.
"If we can do that, I think most of this will be forgotten."
George will be paid for last night's game against the Los Angeles Raiders, a check worth $111,000, but will still owe the $144,000 in fines accumulated in the month he's been out of camp.


O'Neal and Chargers Agree to 3-Year Pact
Defensive end LESLIE O'NEAL, who led the American Football Conference with a career-high 17 sacks last year, signed a three-year contract with the San Diego Chargers yesterday.
Financial terms weren't announced, but O'Neal reportedly was seeking $3 million a year.
He made $1.5 million last season.
Unable to get O'Neal into training camp, the Chargers had gambled by lifting the franchise designation on O'Neal on Tuesday, making him free to negotiate with other teams. . . .
A key player in the Cincinnati Bengals' offense, running back HAROLD GREEN, ended his 28-day holdout yesterday by signing a three-year contract worth at least $4.1 million.
Green, the team's only Pro Bowl player last season when he rushed for 1,170 yards, will miss the season opener Sept. 5 in Cleveland because he was not signed by last week's deadline. . . .
The Detroit Lions bolstered their defense by signing as an unrestricted free agent TIM McKYER, the defensive back who started 15 games with Atlanta in 1992.
McKyer played for San Francisco from 1986-89, Miami in 1990 and was traded to the Falcons in 1991. . . .
Running back TERRY ALLEN, who rushed for 1,201 yards and 15 touchdowns for the Minnesota Vikings last season, is out for the year after having knee surgery yesterday. (AP)


Beliefs
For the better part of a mid-August week some of the nation's most prized broadcast time, from morning shows to evening newscasts, was devoted to Pope John Paul II's visit to a large gathering of Roman Catholic young people in Denver.
So were front-page stories in most newspapers and at least one news magazine.
No one can dispute that this reporting and commentary conveyed some powerful images of a charismatic religious leader and exuberant teen-agers.
The news media's task was accomplished in the face of logistical difficulties, endless waits for admissions tickets and security clearances, transportation bottlenecks and East Coast deadlines that seemed to arrive just as the major late-afternoon and evening events in Denver were getting under way.


Singapore Academic Can Indeed Get Justice
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis says that Dr.
Chee Soon Juan, a neuropsychologist at the National University of Singapore and former parliamentary candidate, was dismissed by the university "ostensibly" for misusing $130 in university funds ("A Tale of Two Cities," column, Aug. 6).
Dr.
Chee had used university funds to mail his wife's thesis for her Ph.D. examination when she was neither on the staff of the university nor his research collaborator.
He only admitted this when confronted by his department head and dean of the faculty, who is not a politician.


Attack on Brazilian Indians Is Worst Since 1910
Investigators searching smoking ruins of two Amazon Indian lodges said today that the number of Yanomami Indians killed Sunday by gold miners was more than 30, making the attack the largest massacre of Brazilian Indians since 1910.
Original estimates of the number of dead in the Hoximu settlement were 20, including 10 children.


From Outrage, Recruitment of Civilian Officers in South Bronx
Just after dark last week a crackling police radio sent Lois Glenn and her husband, Frederick, dashing up the littered stairs of a housing project in the South Bronx.
The Glenns live two blocks from the project, Forest Houses in Morrisania, but they had never dared to venture into one of the buildings at night, when broken light bulbs turn hallways into shadowy gantlets.
"I never even walk through the courtyard here at night, period," said Mr.
Glenn.
"Somebody might take a shot at you."


It Took a Community to Save Burial Ground
To the Editor:
An Aug. 13 news article announced the long-awaited signing of a contract between the General Services Administration and Howard University for an anthropological study of the remains taken from the African Burial Ground in lower Manhattan.
But you miss an important element: this struggle's unsung heroes, the community.
It is a diverse group made up of Americans of African, European and Asian descent from New York and across the country.
These people canvassed friends and neighbors, stood on streetcorners and at church and school doors to collect the 80,000 signatures asking the Government to do the right thing regarding the African ancestors.

Review/Film; Making Waves in Asia
"Surf Ninjas," the movies' latest Kiddie Flavor of the Week, is another of Hollywood's efforts to prove that the American mall mentality is at home in any corner of the globe.
This mock-Turtle adventure brings fast-talking, wisecracking Santa Monica surfer boys to a remote Asian kingdom, where they are happy to behave as if they were still at home.
A plot development that has the boys, who turn out to be crown princes, leveling a local rain forest to make surfboards is the film's one nontrendy move.
"Surf Ninjas" opened yesterday to a bustling audience that was essentially pre-sold, because its title is one any child-friendly computer might have devised.
Doing its best to appeal to young children in every other way, the story throws in gimmicks like a video game that shows 11-year-old Adam (Nicolas Cowan), who has been brought to Asia with his teen-age brother Johnny (Ernie Reyes Jr.), what the bad guys will be doing next.
The bad guys dress in military gear and practice the usual jokey-violent martial-arts moves.
In the course of fighting them, and in the interest of offering children one more bit of excitement, little Adam gets to drive a car.


Comex and Nymex Reach Accord on Merger Proposal
The leading exchanges for trading oil and gold futures announced a merger plan yesterday under which the New York Mercantile Exchange would pay $50 million to members of the Commodity Exchange of New York.
The agreement, which could help keep the Mercantile Exchange from moving to New Jersey, would enable the two exchanges to cut expenses by reducing duplication in computer systems and in the work force that handles marketing, accounting and product development.


Observer; Heidi, Joe And the Catnip
Americans have always been of two minds about curiosity.
On one hand, children were warned against it.
Curiosity killed the cat, didn't it?
On the other hand, curiosity was also at the heart of all science, therefore to be treasured.
The consequence of Isaac Newton's foolishly childish question -- Why does the apple fall down, instead of up or sidewise? -- explained why only adult nincompoops dismissed childish curiosity as foolish.


Too Many Costly Aircraft Carriers
The "bottom-up review" at the Pentagon has turned into a bottoms-up celebration for the Navy.
The review was supposed to determine where to save billions of dollars by pruning excessive force levels.
Instead of seriously questioning the Navy's case for aircraft carriers, however, the reviewers skimmed the surface.
As a result, the Navy has reason to celebrate, even if no one else does.
It will get to keep all 12 of its carriers, which is at least two more than it needs.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin needs to review the reviewers' conclusion.
The Navy's case for carriers rests on three questionable premises: first, that it has to maintain a permanent presence around the globe; second, that it needs carrier battle groups with a full complement of escort ships to establish that presence; and third, that those carrier battle groups must be modernized at the same pace they were during the cold war.

About New York; A Museum's Eskimo Skeletons and Its Own
Six weeks ago employees of the American Museum of Natural History packed four skeletons into separate boxes and shipped them to Greenland.
These were the remains of Eskimos whom Robert E. Peary brought to the museum in 1896 to be interviewed, examined and measured.
Their return for a traditional burial in the Arctic permafrost brings to a close a tragic and shameful tale of aboriginal people victimized by scientific zeal.
It is a story of human beings brought here as specimens, who with no natural immunities quickly succumbed to diseases of our latitude.
It is also a story about the one who survived, a young boy named Minik, who grew up in the Bronx, enrolled at Manhattan College and fruitlessly challenged the Museum, its directors and the lionized discoverer of the North Pole, demanding his father's body so he could bury it.

Mercer Seeks Dismissal of Bribery Charge
RAY MERCER, who has been charged with repeatedly offering JESSE FERGUSON a $100,000 bribe during their heavyweight bout at Madison Square Garden last Feb. 6, has asked for a dismissal of the indictment, saying that prosecutors violated his right to due process by hoodwinking him into thinking he would have a chance to tell his side of the story before a grand jury acted against him.
In papers filed Tuesday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mercer's lawyer, DOMINIC AMOROSA, argued that investigators lied to Mercer as part of a plot to keep the grand jury from hearing evidence, including testimony by Mercer, that would have established his innocence and prevented his indictment.


Michigan Law on Aided Suicide Violates Rights; Legalize Aid in Dying

The assistance of Dr.

Paying Health Premiums  Q. My wife and I eat carefully, do not smoke and exercise regularly to stay in good health.
Are we paying health insurance premiums based on the poor health habits of others under the new New York State law that mandates community rating rather than experience rating?
TOBY McAFEE, Yonkers, N.Y.
A.
In any workable health insurance system, policyholders with relatively few claims tend to subsidize those in poor health.
Furthermore, a healthy life style may reduce your odds of getting sick but does not guarantee that your risk will remain low.
"When it comes to health insurance, there really are only two types of risks -- poor risks and those who will become poor risks," said John Calagna, a spokesman for the New York State Insurance Department.
"It's a fact of life that as we grow older, our need for medical services intensifies."
New York's community-rating and open-enrollment law states that no individual or small-group insurer is permitted to discriminate by age, sex, occupation or health history.
Insurance companies are, however, allowed to impose a waiting period of up to a year on claims relating to a pre-existing condition.
Saving for College Q. How can a zero-coupon bond be used to save money for my grandchild's college education?
MYRON DUBRO, Riverdale, the Bronx A. In contrast to most other types of bonds, zero- coupon bonds do not pay interest to holders on a regular basis.
Instead, a zero-coupon bond -- usually a government or corporate bond -- is bought at a discount from face, or par, value, and redeemed at face value on the date of maturity.
The difference between what you pay and what you receive is the total interest on the bond.
"This type of bond is an excellent way to save for a grandchild's educational expense or for any large expense you may envision in the future," said David J. Corcoran, president of York Securities.
"I would purchase the bonds in a custodial account for your grandchild." In addition, look for a bond with the highest possible rating.
Disability Insurance Q. Are disability insurance policies available with a two-year elimination period?
MARGE TEILHABER, Fort Lee, N.J.
A.
An elimination period is the period between the day you become disabled and the day that benefit payments begin.
The shorter the elimination period, the higher the cost of a disability insurance policy.
Most individual disability policies include a 90-day elimination period.
That is because such a time span is considered a reasonable period for the average person to wait for financial relief, and a policy with a shorter elimination period would be more expensive.
"There are some policies available with a two-year elimination period," said Leigh Canfield, director of product development of the UNUM Life Insurance Company of America.
"However, they are most applicable for people with either a group insurance policy or a self-insured plan that already covers you for two years."


Rookie of the Night: Jean Shuts Down Royals
Domingo Jean arrived early and ready to pitch last night.
No taxi trouble, no traffic jams and no sprints across the George Washington Bridge, obstacles he encountered before his last start six days ago.
He was just a rookie pitcher embroiled in a pennant race, a rookie looking to make an impact.
Jean succeeded.
Pitching with flair and without a hint of trepidation, Jean stifled the Kansas City Royals on five hits in seven innings and benefited from a revived offense as the Yankees sauntered to a 7-2 victory in a battle of second-place teams at Yankee Stadium.

The doctor, who was wearing his surgical garb at the time of the shooting, was treated for superficial wounds to his arms.


Michigan Law on Aided Suicide Violates Rights
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 5 news article on Dr.
Jack Kevorkian and Michigan's efforts to criminalize assisted suicide so abbreviates the status of that state's law as to be inaccurate.
You say "a county judge struck down the law on technical grounds in May, ruling that it had been passed before the required hearings had been held." Failure to hold sufficient legislative hearings has little to do with what is happening in Michigan.


Too Timid on the Police Corps
Tucked into the big anti-crime package recently unveiled by President Clinton is an overdue innovation for law enforcement called the Police Corps.
The idea, championed for years by Adam Walinsky, a New York lawyer who was one of Robert Kennedy's Senate aides, and taken up by Mr.
Clinton during the 1992 campaign, is to offer college scholarships to students willing to serve four years on a local police force after graduation.
Mr.
Clinton wants to establish the corps, but his boldness stops there.
The $100 million he proposes to spend over four years is much less than both the House and Senate approved for the Police Corps as part of an anti-crime bill that died for unrelated reasons.
It would provide for fewer than 5,000 recruits, far short of the 80,000 corps recruits envisioned by the bipartisan group of senators who supported last year's plan.


Accused Didn't Kill Jordan, Lawyer Says

One Siamese Twin Survives An Extraordinary Separation
In a feat of surgical wizardry, surgeons at Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania yesterday separated 7-week-old Siamese twin girls who relied on a common heart.
Only rarely have surgeons successfully divided twins who shared this vital organ.
It was a bittersweet triumph since, as had been predicted before surgery, Amy Lakeberg had to give up her life so that her sister, Angela, might have a chance to live.
Even with the highly technical surgery, doctors thought it unlikely that either twin would live, some putting the odds as low as 1 percent.
With the help of some creative surgery, Angela has so far beaten the odds, but the next three to five days pose a particularly dangerous period.

The Lure of Splashes in the Night; With Safety in Mind, Parks Dept. Battles Young Trespassers
Until a lone police officer arrived at Mullaly Pool in the Bronx recently, its murky, dark waters were an aquatic playground for dozens of teen-agers and young children who had slipped -- illegally -- into the pool's welcoming waters each night.
After a few minutes of gentle urgings by the officer, the boys reluctantly pulled themselves out of the pool.
They lumbered, cold and wet, through holes in the pool's fence created precisely for the regular evening ritual of breaking and entering municipal swimming pools after closing hours for an unsupervised swim.

The man, Charles Steir, had been questioned in his sister's death, but the Bronx District Attorney's office had declined to prosecute him.


Critic's Notebook; Palatial Gain for Russian Museum
Just about every major museum in the world has lately been in the business of expansion.
But the jackpot in this context has surely been won by the Russian Museum here.
Although it has been housed since 1898 in the Mikhailovsky Palace, one of the largest and most beautiful palaces in the city, it has since the fall of the Communist regime in 1991 been allocated no less than three more of the most striking buildings: the Marble Palace, the Engineer's Castle and the Stroganov Palace.
These extensions represent a considerable coup for the director of the museum, Vladimir Gusev.
Mr.
Gusev had two very important things going for him: One was the backing of the strong-willed Mayor of St.
Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak.
The other was the fact that, with the political changes, palace after palace throughout the city was going to be released from the uses to which it had been put.

Fed Affirmed Its Bias Toward Higher Rates
The Federal Reserve's main policy-making committee voted in July to maintain its bias toward raising short-term interest rates, even though some members urged it to drop that bias because economic growth was so weak.

A Small Price for Big Art
Although it's easy enough to hang a price tag on fine art, it's impossible to gauge its value to the viewer.
Looking at a Rembrandt, for instance, can provide pleasure past calculating.
And surely all Americans are better served when great works of art hang on museum walls for all to see, rather than in private salons, here or abroad.
They wouldn't be hanging in museums, however, were it not for the extraordinary stream of donations from rich and not-so-rich Americans.
But after the 1986 tax reform act, which allowed donors a tax deduction only on a work's acquisition cost, and not its market value, the stream came perilously close to drying up.


Cadbury Raising Stake in Dr Pepper

The contract was headed for defeat on any lead, barring the implausible diamond king.
But West led a club, and set a trap for his partner.

Widower Carries Burden of His Past Life
To the Editor:
That paragon of prospects, a widower, as described by Emily Yoffe in "Hollywood's Widower Fantasy" (Op-Ed, Aug. 8), has indeed had one good marriage (as far as we know), but he also has children and a home that is furnished in his first wife's taste and financial obligations and friends who knew him as half of a couple.

Deep South and Down Home, But It's a Ghetto All the Same
This forlorn little town of rickety shotgun shacks and 1,467 people, surrounded by the table-top-flat cotton fields of northwest Mississippi, has the spent air of a place that history has passed by.
But throughout this forgotten corner of America and in the other poorest parts of the South, hamlets like Jonestown are writing a bitter epilogue to integration.
Small towns that were once economically stable and racially mixed are becoming pockets of poverty and overwhelmingly black -- 75 to 100 percent so. 100 With Jobs
The pattern is so striking that some experts say a new kind of ghetto is evolving: rural instead of urban, but sharing many conditions of the inner city: white flight, black poverty, a disappearing job base, reliance on government welfare payments, rising crime and social isolation.

New Choices From Blue Chips to Small Caps
The Stratton Small-Cap Yield Fund invests in smaller companies, generally with market capitalizations of less than $500 million.
It seeks to reduce the risk of small-capitalization stocks by sticking with well-established companies that pay dividends.
The fund, which plans to pay quarterly dividends, aims for an annual yield of 3 percent or more, compared with 2.4 percent for the S.&amp; P. 500.
The name is somewhat misleading because the fund's objective is capital appreciation, not income; dividend yield is used instead of price-to-earnings ratios to identify undervalued stocks.
The Montgomery Global Communications Fund buys shares of companies in the information business worldwide.
Industries include broadcasting, wireless communications, data systems and multimedia development along with traditional telecommunications manufacturing and services.
The new fund's portfolio is split among companies in the Americas, 55 percent, with 11.8 percent in Latin America; Asia, 26 percent, and Europe 18.5 percent.
The remainder is held in cash.
The fund does not hedge currency risks.

Faster Search For Asbestos Is Promised
With 19 days until classes begin for New York City's schoolchildren, officials directing the inspection for asbestos in the schools sought to reassure Board of Education officials yesterday that they were stepping up the pace of their work so that all 1,069 schools would be inspected by Sept. 9.
The officials said that 76 teams of inspectors -- each with two or three people, one of whom must be certified by New York State -- would be working by Monday to examine the 751 schools that have yet to be inspected, still more than two-thirds of the total number of schools.


The Public Theater's Boost For Italian Film Making
Film at the Public has signed an exclusive 18-month agreement with Italy's film board to present recent Italian films at the Joseph Papp Public Theater.
The first film to be shown under the new agreement will be "Acla," a 1992 movie by Aurelio Grimaldi.
It will open in early December.
"The distribution of Italian product in the United States has been very poor in the last few years," said Fabiano Canosa, the director of Film at the Public.
"Only four or five titles get picked up each year, and there are a much greater number of deserving films that have never been seen here."


CHRONICLE
The Yeshiva University Museum in Washington Heights is planning an exhibition in October depicting the recent life of Ethiopian Jews.
The exhibition, to be called "Faith and Survival: Ethiopian Jewish Life 1983-1992," will include a replica of a typical Ethiopian house, called a tukul, a round structure with walls made of the trunks of young trees.
But when PAUL KATZ, a retired architect who is supervising the construction, began calling tree nurseries from New England to Florida, he found the cost of appropriate saplings would be at least $1,500, more than the museum could afford.

New York City Police to Replace Revolvers With Semiautomatics
New York City police officers will begin this fall to phase out their .38-caliber revolvers for 9-millimeter semiautomatic handguns, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday.
The move reflects a change of position for the department, which had resisted the quicker, more powerful weapons, and for the Commissioner, who had expressed reservations that the guns might be too dangerous in crowded urban settings.

"The horse has improved," he said.

Striving to negotiate an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina before winter sets in, international mediators today presented a draft peace accord to Bosnian Muslim, Serbian and Croatian leaders and gave them 10 days in which to accept or reject it.
Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's President, and Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's President, who joined the peace talks on Thursday, immediately backed the plan.
Leaders of Bosnian Serbs and Croats said they had reservations about the plan, although they indicated that they were also willing to accept it.

CHANGES ARE MADE AT AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARDS
American Express yesterday gave Frank Skillern, who had turned around its ailing Optima revolving credit card, the task of running its flagship green, gold and platinum charge card business.
Mr.
Skillern, 57, replaces Kenneth I. Chenault, who was promoted last month to president of American Express Travel Related Services U.S.A., the unit that operates the company's domestic credit card and travel agency business.
The company has been retrenching to encourage its core customer base of business travelers to use its cards for personal spending, and its most effective tool has been a program that offers frequent-flier miles for purchases.
"We want more cards, more spending, less attrition and lower costs," Mr.
Skillern said.
The company also named Phillip J. Riese to replace Mr.
Skillern as head of the Optima and other consumer-lending products.
Mr.
Riese oversaw the development and introduction in 1987 of the Optima card, which was plagued by unusually high loan losses until Mr.
Skillern tightened credit standards.

An Anti-Marriage Tax
To the Editor:
Has anyone at the White House or in Congress noticed that the newly passed budget and tax bill significantly penalizes married people and discourages the institution of marriage by raising income taxes on single people with incomes of more than $115,000 a year and married couples with an income of $140,000 a year (much less than twice $115,000)?
It will discourage married women from working, or from working full time at their peak earning capacity, because that only puts them in a higher tax bracket.

Some Old-Time Favorites From the Sea
DESPITE all the newfangled foods and ingredients on the market there are a number of time-honored classics that never cease to tempt.
No amount of radicchio salad can quite compare with a well-crafted coleslaw, for example.
Smoked scallops are intriguing but lack the irresisti-ble nibble power of crisp, golden rings of fried calamari.
Littleneck clams or mussels steamed open in a broth bolstered with sharply briny Chinese fermented black beans are delicious, to be sure, but given the choice, a simple bowl of mussels steamed in white wine and garlic might be even more appealing.

Making Pitch for Planning Careers at Camp
David Acevedo wants to be a reporter.
Rechard Omar Newman wants to be a doctor.
And Adinah Bradberry wants to be the first black female Attorney General of the United States.
All three young people attend the Fresh Air Fund's Career Awareness Camp in Fishkill, N.Y., and they say the camp has influenced them more than their schools, helping them escape the often difficult existence of their city neighborhoods and to set goals.

Prosecutors Expand Case Against Texas Cult
Four months after the fiery end to the Branch Davidian standoff near Waco, Tex., the struggle between surviving members of the religious cult and the Government is moving slowly toward the next battlefield, a courtroom.
Federal prosecutors have expanded the indictments to charge 12 sect members with murder and conspiracy.
Six defendants had previously faced the same charges.
Named in the new indictments, handed up on Aug. 6, were Paul G. Fatta, Ruth Ottman Riddle, Woodrow Kendrick, Norman Allison, Graeme L. Craddock and Renos Avraam.

On Wheels: American at 10 M.P.H.; A Western Aura in an Eastern State
Michigan, with an area of just under 57,000 square miles, is the nation's 22d largest state.
But it is laid out so peculiarly -- a mitten-shaped base and an Upper Peninsula (the U.P., in local parlance) that looks a little like a fish swimming in the confluence of Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron -- that to enter at the northwest and exit in the southeast one covers in the neighborhood of 600 miles.
It is an Eastern state with Western breadth, and the Western quality of vast and impressive outdoors.
There are national forests, national parks, a national wildlife refuge.
Onaway, a town about a hundred miles northwest of here, proudly calls itself the Sturgeon Capital of Michigan.
Just south of Onaway, Atlanta is the Elk Capital.
And south of Atlanta is Fairview, the state's Wild Turkey Capital.
The state itself is apparently the nation's jerky capital.
Roadside shops from north to south offer beef jerky, deer jerky, whitefish jerky and the inevitable turkey jerky.


A MILD CASE
My husband and I recently returned from Israel, where we visited our 16-year-old daughter, who is attending a summer high-school program, along with 250 teen-agers from across the United States.
She, too, was diagnosed as having mild cerebral palsy when she was 7 months old, and we experienced many of Jack Hersch's fears and anxieties.
Our concern about her environment led us to consider selling our multi-level suburban home, until she began to crawl the steps when she was 2.


Spies &amp; Thrillers
In his latest novel set in turn-of-the-century Cairo, Michael Pearce introduces us to a gorilla of a man.
He is the bodyguard of a pasha, and he represents the old virtues.
So when he goes into battle it is with the bubbling happiness and invention of Rossini writing "Il Barbiere di Siviglia." He gets into a fight, merely doing his duty, and when Capt.
Cadwallader Owen, the Mamur Zapt, comes upon him, he is holding something in his hand:
" 'What's that you're holding?'


Some Old-Time Favorites From the Sea
DESPITE all the newfangled foods and ingredients on the market there are a number of time-honored classics that never cease to tempt.
No amount of radicchio salad can quite compare with a well-crafted coleslaw, for example.
Smoked scallops are intriguing but lack the irresisti-ble nibble power of crisp, golden rings of fried calamari.
Littleneck clams or mussels steamed open in a broth bolstered with sharply briny Chinese fermented black beans are delicious, to be sure, but given the choice, a simple bowl of mussels steamed in white wine and garlic might be even more appealing.


Making a Driveway Last Years Longer
AN asphalt driveway will last 20 years or more with minimal care and remain reasonably attractive for the duration.
Without attention, signs of aging can appear in as few as five years, and minor damage can quickly become a major problem.
Minimal care consists primarily of repairing cracks as they develop.
Also, the driveway should be coated with sealer every three to five years; this helps to protect it from sunlight and chemicals like road salt and bolsters water-resistance.


'A Realist, Not a Romantic'
To the Editor:
Tina Packer, artistic director of the resident acting troupe at the Mount, Edith Wharton's home in the Berkshires, errs when she says that Wharton's female characters "almost always triumph in the end"  [ "Edith Wharton's Novels Were Theatrical Long Before the Movies 'Discovered' Them," July 18 ] .


For Children, Pop Goes The Museum
It would seem a truism that children's museums should be joyous works of architecture, but so few are.
Even many that are wonderful inside do little to reveal their pleasures to the world outside; their architecture is more of a neutral enclosure than an enticement to passers-by.
No one could call the new Children's Museum of Houston a neutral enclosure.
This building, designed by Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates of Philadelphia along with the Houston firm of Jackson &amp; Ryan, is dazzling, exuberant and witty.
It manages the trick of being seductively attractive to children without seeming even slightly too cute to adults.
Like all Venturi and Scott Brown's work, it is a building of considerable sophistication, full of games and tricks and visual puns to entertain the cognoscenti -- but this time the wit expands, gently and graciously, to a point at which it becomes accessible to almost everyone.
It is a building that children want to enter, and so do adults.

France's 3-Star Cats: A Vanishing Breed
MOST people lunching or dining at the venerable three-star restaurant Troisgros are too absorbed in such dishes as rouleaux de crabes dormeur a l'huile de Maussane to notice a small, solemn calico cat with only half a tail making her quiet tour of inspection around the splendid dining room.
But this cat, Tricotine, is one of the most beloved and respected members of the famous family of chefs, the Troisgros of Roanne, near Lyons.
And she is one part of that quality that has created and sustained the great older restaurants of France: their roots, as the food writers Gault and Millau once put it, "in the familial soil and in the sensuality of things."
There are signs that French grande cuisine is losing touch with its roots and their concomitant cats.
For most of French restaurant history, which began in 1789, the cat has been an essential member of kitchen personnel.
But of the 19 restaurants awarded the accolade of three stars by the Michelin Guide this year, only two, both in Burgundy, have resident cats: Mitou of L'Esperance and Tricotine.

Gramercy Park
To the Editor:
An erroneous statement was made in your article on the Gramercy Park area on July 11 relative to the Brotherhood Synagogue, formerly the Twentieth Street Meeting House of Orthodox Friends.
The building, which dates from 1860, was not a station on the Underground Railroad.
Although individual Friends did help escaping slaves, in New York Yearly Meeting, at any rate, they were scrupulous not to involve their Meetings in this concern.

Dubbing Isn't The Answer
To the Editor:
As a devotee of French films, I was appalled by one line in Roger Cohen's article "Barbarians at the Box Offices" (July 11).
Mr.
Cohen reports that the French want to dub their most successful films into English to make them more accessible to Americans and therefore more successful financially.
By doing this, the French movie industry could counteract and possibly pre-empt Hollywood's remaking their films.

August 15-21; Long Distance Meets Wireless: A.T.&amp; T. Buys Cellular Giant And Nobody Blinks Twice
Are corporate conglomerates back in fashion?
It almost seems that way, judging from reaction to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company's agreement last week to pay $12.6 billion for the country's biggest cellular telephone company, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
The deal means that A.T.&amp; T., which controls more than 60 percent of the long-distance market and is the country's biggest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, will soon have a massive new wireless network that covers 35 percent of the American population.

Editorial Notebook; Two Hospitals, Two Attitudes
For months I've been trying to follow the debate on how to provide decent health care for all Americans.
At this point I'm still confused about the merits of this system or that, but I am certain of one thing: that in the course of trying to cure the body, a hospital can kill the spirit.
Several years ago a friend was a patient at a famous hospital in New York.
Like many New Yorkers who can afford to do so, she had hired a private nurse -- not because she needed constant attention but because she had been advised that a private nurse was the best way to insure her getting any attention at all.

Wilkinson Goes the Distance To Win With 2 Tie Breakers
No matter how far down, never give an inch.
That is how Chris Wilkinson plays the game of tennis.
Not when you're losing in a first-set tie breaker.
Not when you've double- faulted at love-40 to fall behind by 1-5 in the second set.
Not when you're forced into a second-set tie breaker on your serve after rallying for a 6-5 lead.
Not even when you're down three points in the tie breaker.
Not ever.
"The longer I stay on the court, the better the chance I have to win," Wilkinson said.


A Value Judgment
To the Editor:
At the time of Nazi Germany, Bela Bartok said: "If anyone stays on here, when he could leave, he can thereby be said to acquiesce to everything that is happening here." Those who chose to stay and perform were aware that their international reputation would be exploited to legitimize their evil government.
Under the circumstances, one must make a value judgment.
Are these Teldec recordings really of such historic importance and artistic value that one cannot do without them?


Johnson Gives the Jets A Full Set of Backs
The last time Johnny Johnson faced the Giants he was running for the Phoenix Cardinals and it was the regular season.
Johnson had a career-high 156 yards on 36 carries that day last year and left an indelible impression on a few people -- Jets player personnel officials included.
So, when the opportunity presented itself during the draft this past spring, the Jets worked a deal with the Cardinals to get Johnson.
New York flip-flopped spots with Phoenix in the first round, giving the Cardinals their No. 3 selection for Phoenix's No. 4 spot and Johnson, who went to the Pro Bowl as a rookie.

Perot Assails Clinton Economic Plan
In his first speaking tour of New York State since becoming a political force, Ross Perot today criticized the Clinton economic plan, called for rejection of the North American Free Trade Agreement and urged his supporters to make a difference in elections at all levels.

August 15-21; Jersey's Insurance Sting: Cashing In on a Crash Without Pain and Suffering
It seemed like a normal traffic collision in East Orange, N.J., last March, when a bus carrying 15 passengers was rear-ended by a slow-moving car.
No one was hurt.
But by this summer 19 people claimed they had been on board and were filing personal injury claims for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Some of the phony claims came from people who had been scanning police emergency radio channels the day of the crash and had rushed onto the bus before police arrived.
Unfortunately for them, the bus, the car, and the 15 passengers were all part of a sting operation by New Jersey law enforcement officials.
In more than 10 faked bus crashes over three years, the state caught more than 100 people, state officials said, who were notified last week they face civil fines or prosecution.
And two Newark police officers and a physician were indicted on Federal charges of insurance fraud.
The officers were charged with adding a name to the list of the injured and the physician was charged with billing for nonexistent treatment.

A Multitude of Sins and Egocentric Traits
To the Editor:
I was delighted with William Trevor's tender and beguiling short story about gluttony (June 27).

For the uninitiated, the translation is "frosted cookies."  LIANE KEEN  Encino, Calif.


Brazil Plans to Expel 2,000 Goldminers After Indians Are Massacred


On English Supermarket Shelves, Edible Souvenirs
SEARCHING for affordable souvenirs in England is not always easy.
Even with the pound devalued, cashmere sweaters are still stunningly expensive, and a skirt-length of Harris tweed or Scotch tartan might, for a cost-conscious tourist, involve giving up a long-awaited tea at the Dorchester. (And who do you know who wants a tartan skirt?) Most of the fairly inexpensive trinkets at street stands -- little soldiers in tall fur hats, miniature British flags, dish towels depicting the Tower of London, smart-alecky T-shirts -- are either flimsy or tacky, or both.
So what can a traveler on a limited budget find?
Plenty -- not behind the quaint pseudo-Tudor storefront of Liberty's, but in mundane, well-stocked supermarkets such as Sainsbury, Safeway, Gateway, Tesco, Wait rose or Asda.
Although London and country towns still abound in small shops, the fruiterer, butcher and baker are hard-pressed by American-style chains, some so ambitious they even include hardware sections, fast-food counters and children's play areas.
Inside these emporiums of food and drink, and even in some smaller grocery stores, a souvenir hunter can quickly fill a cart with distinctive reminders of England that cost only a few dollars or less.
Since many American supermarkets (and specialty shops in metropolitan areas) carry selected English imports -- After Eight mints, for example, Carr's Water Biscuits, Twining's Earl Grey tea, or Baxter's Orange Marmalade -- I avoid such obvious choices.
Many other possibilities await, however, including less ordinary variations on familiar themes: Dundee Three-Fruit Marmalade (orange, lemon and grapefruit, $1.70, or Hovis Butter Puffs, 75 cents, or Mint Humbugs, $1, calculated at $1.44 to the pound.

U.N. Trims List of Candidates for Tribunal on Balkan War Crimes
The United Nations has moved a step closer to setting up a tribunal to prosecute war criminals in the former Yugoslavia by narrowing down a list of candidates to 23 potential judges.

The General Assembly is to elect 11 to serve on the tribunal within the next month.


Conversations/David Card and Alan Krueger; Two Economists Catch Clinton's Eye By Bucking the Common Wisdom
A CONTROVERSIAL memorandum from Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor, has been making the rounds here recently.
It urges the President to propose not only a rapid 25-cent increase in the $4.25 Federal minimum wage but automatic annual increases in the minimum pay of everyone from McDonald's kitchen crews to Marriott chambermaids.
That may seem a bit strange from someone who says he is a New Democrat and considers himself a champion of disadvantaged workers.
Economists, neoliberals and advocates for the poor have long believed that making it more expensive for business to hire the young, the least-skilled and the least-educated means fewer jobs for people who most need a break.

Center of Ottoman Power
SOME of Istanbul's monuments, the soaring mosques of Sinan and the venerable Hagia Sophia among them, are said to have changed the history of architecture.
Certainly, many places here have more grace, more age, more harmony than the Palace of Topkapi and its mesh of pavilions and styles.
But there is no single site that has as much to tell us about the values, tastes and aspirations of the Ottoman Empire, which kept its headquarters here for 400 of its more than 600-year reign.
The Saray was more than the residence of the reigning Sultan and his court -- his women and slaves, grand viziers and eunuchs, teachers and executioners.
This was the center of power.
Taxes and tributes poured into Topkapi from an empire that extended from Ethiopia to Central Asia and to Bosnia.
Records were kept here, heads rolled here and orders were carried far and wide.
After Sultan Selim I assumed the title of Caliph in the early 16th century, these precincts even became a kind of Vatican of the Muslim world.
And over the centuries, Topkapi swelled with gifts, adornments and war booty.


August 15-21; Read This Seat, Hear This Opera
James Levine, the artistic director of the Metropolitan Opera, was so vehemently opposed to the use of supertitles -- the projected translations used at many opera houses -- that he once declared that the Met would use them "over my dead body." He still doesn't love them, but in the hope of making opera accessible to more listeners, he has dropped his opposition.
Met officials said last week that the company hopes to install a supertitle system by the start of the 1994-95 season.


Diphtheria in Russia Worsens, Killing 100 in '93
Russia's diphtheria epidemic is worsening, with more than 4,000 cases already reported this year, the same number as for all of 1992, and more than 100 deaths.
This fallout from the collapse of the Soviet Union and its increasingly creaky system of health care prompted Russia last week to announce a mass immunization program over the next two years.
By contrast, in the mid-1970's, there were fewer than 200 cases a year of diphtheria in the entire Soviet Union.
In the United States last year, there were four cases.


A 'Phantom' That Is True to a Tradition
IN contrast to the Broadway phantasmagoria "Phantom of the Opera," a motivationless technological marvel, the show at the Candlewood Playhouse here, simply called "Phantom," is a throwback to the traditional virtues of musical theater.
A melodious score with an involving story here is the thing, not the set construction, mobilized candelabras and a crashing chandelier.
By now, it's no news that Maury Yeston (music and lyrics) and Arthur Kopit (book) were ready to go with their own take on the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel "Le Fantome de l'Opera," the source of seven films and at least as many stage adaptations.
But the Andrew Lloyd Webber spectacle got there (London 1986, Broadway 1988) first.

Compact Simplicity In a Full-Size Model
HAS the age of the unburdened photographer arrived?
Is picture taking with 35-millimeter cameras so simple now that one doesn't have to read an instruction book to produce a good image?
Not quite, but photography is now another step closer.
Yashica has added to the category of lighter, simplified, yet feature-packed 35-millimeter designs.
The company is betting that consumers are ready to move up from pocket-size point-and-shoot cameras to full-size 35-millimeter cameras with the simplicity of their pocket-size relatives.
But Yashica is also hedging its bet by producing lighter and smaller point-and-shoot cameras, too.

First Place Revisited: Yanks Are Tied Again
Scott Kamieniecki might want to send a memo to George Steinbrenner concerning this business about the Yankees possibly leaving the Bronx.
Bad idea, big guy, Kamieniecki might utter.
Parking problems can be alleviated, the New Jersey Yankees sounds silly and the tradition of baseball's most storied franchise would be severely tarnished, he might continue.
Finally, Kamieniecki might beg the owner: Please don't move the team, I never lose at Yankee Stadium.
Never.
Well, Kamieniecki has lost in the Bronx, but not for 54 weeks.
The extraordinary home streak for the previously ordinary pitcher continued yesterday when he halted the Royals on five hits in eight innings and carried the Yankees to a 3-2 victory at the Stadium.
He has now won his last 12 decisions at the Stadium and is only the second Yankee in the last 25 years to fashion such a nifty stretch.
The other is Ron Guidry, who did it twice.
Two months ago, it would have been laughable to include the two pitchers in the same paragraph.
Not anymore.


Danger for Mayor Dinkins
Mayor David Dinkins had no choice but to dismiss Philip Michael after an investigative report criticized the budget director for showing favoritism to a company seeking a $150 million city contract.
He had become a danger to the Mayor's re-election campaign.
But Mr.
Michael's questionable conduct is hardly the sum total of what went wrong at City Hall as it tried to privatize most operations of the Parking Violations Bureau.
As the report by the Department of Investigation so amply demonstrates, the city's effort was sloppy and amateurish at best, unethical and riddled with cronyism at worst.
Although there are troubling implications, so far there is no evidence of criminality.
But once again, the Mayor has seemed able to bestir himself only when licked by the flames of crisis.
By inviting his opponents to depict him as detached, Mr.
Dinkins allows them to distract voters from the humane instincts that undergird his approach to government.


Liz Wright, Scott Segee
Elizabethada Amanda Wright, the daughter of Ada L. Smith-Wright of Arlington, Mass., and David E. Wright of Oak Bluffs, Mass., was married yesterday to Scott Howard Segee, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Merrill Segee of Millinocket, Me.
The Rev.
Lawrence Estey performed the ceremony at St.
Peter's-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Ogunquit, Me.
Ms.
Wright, 33 and known as Liz, is keeping her name.
She is a doctoral student in communication and rhetoric at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
She graduated from Hamilton College and received a master's degree in English literature from Columbia University.


Airport Neighbors Wary After Crash
Wanda Vogel often drives down Beaver Brook Road accompanied by the shadow of a small plane making its final landing approach to Lincoln Park Airport.
"I always keep an eye on the plane, in case it might come down on top of me," Mrs.
Vogel said.
"I say that with tongue in cheek, because I don't know what I could do if it did."
On Sunday, the unthinkable happened.
Two small planes preparing to land collided, and both fell along Beaver Brook Road next to the airport.
One pilot was killed.
The other, whose plane landed in trees along the road, suffered head and eye injuries.
And a husband and wife driving on Beaver Brook Road were slightly injured when a wing torn off one plane went through their windshield.


Pride and Residence
If you can't vacation in the English countryside, THE WORLD OF JANE AUSTEN (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson/Trafalgar Square, $29.95), a charming look at the stately homes and splendid walkways frequented by Jane Austen and her family, provides an excellent alternative.
This is not a biography of Austen, Nigel Nicolson explains, but an attempt to help us see the world that she saw.
Nonetheless, Mr.
Nicolson, who is best known as the biographer of his parents, Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West, presents an engaging introduction to Austen's life, as well as a portrait of the architectural styles and taste of the age, engagingly illustrated by Stephen Colover's photographs.
Moreover, in guiding us through the houses, estates and landscapes that Austen knew in Kent, Hampshire, Bath and a variety of seaside resorts, Mr.
Nicolson succeeds in his purpose of considering her novels "as a product of her experience." Austen (1775-1817) was the daughter of a parson of modest means who nonetheless had frequent social contacts with families on all levels of the social scale, including the nobility.
Mr.
Nicolson chronicles the Austen family's moves from one part of the country to another, along with Jane's frequent visits to nearby friends and relatives, and describes the ways in which her novels and letters reveal her preference for country over urban life and classical architectural styles over the ornate and romantic.
Wisely, he refrains from claiming specific homes as models for any of the fictional residences in Austen's novels, pointing out that they were composites of her imagination's making.
Mr.
Nicolson, who lives in Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, displays a keen critical eye for architecture and design and a respectful appreciation for Austen's art.


'All's Well' and the Sweet Mystery of Life
It isn't just Richard Jones's astonishing staging that makes "All's Well That Ends Well" one of the more compelling manifestations of the New York Shakespeare Festival in Central Park.
It's the unorthodox stage he's working on.
I'm not referring to the stage of the Delacorte Theater, although that's the production's official abode through next Sunday.
If you stop to think about it, there really is no Delacorte stage.
The facility consists of little more than a wedge of seats clustered not quite in a semicircle around an open, non descript space.
The director and his designers get to build the stage they want.


Your Home: Co-op Sponsors; Boards Get New Power In Defaults
DOZENS of New York City co-ops that are still dealing with sponsors who have yet to fulfill their financial obligations under the terms of the original conversions will be in a far stronger position as a result of an appeals court ruling in June.
The case, ALH Properties Ten Inc. v. 306 (West) 100th Street Owners Corp., involved a sponsor who pledged his unsold shares as collateral for a loan and who later defaulted on his loan payments to the lender as well as on his maintenance payments and other obligations to the co-op.


Miss Brooks, Mr. Rouviere
Sara Lloyd Brooks, the daughter of Valerie Gladstone of New York and Daniel J. Brooks of Bangkok, was married yesterday to Jean-Francois Rouviere, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Michel Rouviere of Paris.
The Rev.
Rene Brault, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated at l'Eglise St.-Pierre in Montford-l'Amaruey, France.
The Rev.
Gerald Brittenden, an Episcopal priest, took part in the ceremony.
Mrs.
Rouviere graduated from Simmons College.
She is to begin work as an English teacher at the St.
Jean de Passy primary school in Paris next month.
Her father is the regional director of Unicef in Bangkok.
Her mother is an author and journalist based in New York.


A SENSE OF PLACE
IT is an establishment that the folks in this town take pretty much for granted.
They shouldn't.
But it's that kind of place: steak-'n'-fries homey, a cross between Alice's Restaurant and the "Cheers" bar.
You go there in shorts for dinner with your family on graduation night, as we did; or you find yourself there with your teammates telling tall tales, as my next-door neighbor Bert Bronander does on bowling night.
Outwardly it's a garden-variety restaurant, with its nondescript cedar-shingled entrance hidden behind the Bellevue cinema.
It's just to the west of the firehouse and Cadeaux Gifts by Renee.
Its only advertisement?
The small circular logo over the steps, the friendly one with the woodcut showing two hands in mid-shake.
The letters say: Charlie Brown's.


Bronx River Parkway On Historic List
The article "Safety vs. Esthetics on Bronx River" in the Westchester section on Aug. 8 failed to mention that the Bronx River Parkway is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The county of Westchester, in accepting this designation (the owner must approve being listed), accepted the stewardship of preserving the nation's first public parkway.
National Register status does not necessarily prevent alterations.
The county could use non-Federal funds to make changes, but this would go against the spirit of the law.
Before any capital improvements are made in county parks (whether or not they are on the National Register), plans are reviewed by the county's Historic Preservation Advisory Committee, which is appointed by the County Executive.
The proposed changes in the Bronx River Parkway paths are on our agenda, and we will advise the county on the best way to retain the historic character of the paths without compromising the environmental and safety issues discussed in the article.


POSTINGS: Woodstock Renovation; Brightening the Scene Just off Times Square
Dismally gray and decrepit, the ground floor of the Woodstock Hotel dulled the street between Times Square and Town Hall for years.
But now, having been steam cleaned and stripped of its thick coat of paint, the rusticated limestone base virtually brightens its surroundings.
There is more to come, said Cynthia Dial, executive director of Project Find, which owns and operates the 285-unit single-room-occupancy hotel at 127 West 43d Street.
"We're going to have trees, planter boxes, colorful awnings and new doors," she said.
"You're not going to walk by there and feel this is a distressed property. You're going to walk by and feel there's this very pleasant space. It will clearly help the street scene."


ALL PAIN, NO GAIN
Penn Jillette has spent entirely too much time dwelling on the issue of pain (Workbook: "All Pain, No Gain," July 18).
A few weeks ago, I received a tattoo, and, yes, it did hurt, but what an experience!
For a rational (and sober) person, there is a sublime excitement that builds in intensity as the tattooing process unfolds.
The pain is a part of what makes the tattoo fun.

A Life Undone -- A special report.; Portrait of a White House Aide Ensnared by His Perfectionism
Vincent W. Foster Jr. was in the middle of another oppressive White House workday on Thursday, July 15, when a friend from Little Rock, Ark., stopped by and explained how the people back home pictured his Washington life.
"They think all you folks up here sit at the right hand of the President," said the friend, Skip Rutherford, a former Clinton campaign aide.
He told Mr.
Foster they imagined him having lunch at the mess with the President each day, adjourning at 5 for cocktails on the Truman balcony, and spending weekends cruising the Potomac or relaxing at Camp David, Md.


Oilers Hold On Against The Best
When the Houston Oilers battle the Dallas Cowboys in their annual preseason skirmish, the Oilers usually find a way to earn the Cowboys' respect.
Hey, don't mess with Texas.


Wheelplanter, Wheellibrary, Wheelbarrow
The wheelbarrow as lawn ornament doesn't have to be the gnome-driven variety.
It could be this bright green wooden example made in Syracuse around 1910.
Antique wheelbarrows, seen rarely these days, can also serve as planters, firewood boxes or magazine racks.
This one brought $25 at Roberts Auction Service.


Laura Dieffenbach, A. R. San Miguel
Laura Elizabeth Dieffenbach, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Rix A. Dieffenbach Jr. of Wilmington, Del., was married there yesterday to Alejandro R. San Miguel, the son of Mrs.
Raul San Miguel of New York and the late Mr.
San Miguel.
The Rev.
Luis Leon performed the Episcopal ceremony at Brantwyn, a mansion at the Du Pont Country Club.
Mrs.
San Miguel, 25, is a nurse in the pediatrics department of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, as did her husband.


On-the-Job Injury
To the Editor:
Thanks for the timely article "Faulty Data Play Down Job Injuries" (Viewpoints, Aug. 15).


Britain's Spy Agencies Begin To Come Out From the Cold
In the 20 months since she was named the chief of M.I.5, Britain's domestic security service, Stella Rimington has rung up several firsts: She is the first woman to head one of Britain's secret agencies, the first M.I.5 director to appear before cameras at a news conference, the first British intelligence chief to publish a booklet disclosing the organization's goals and staffing, and the first person from the secret world ever to have her photograph appear in a gossip magazine.
The photograph appeared this summer, when Hello!, a breathless weekly filled with glossy celebrity pictures and tattle, showed the 58-year-old Mrs.
Rimington sipping white wine at the Royal Academy, a photographic indiscretion that did not sit well with some Government ministers.


Pressure on Sudan Can't Do Any Good
To the Editor:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has announced that the United States is adding the Sudan to the list of countries that support terrorism.
This means the United States will end all foreign aid except for humanitarian reasons and veto all new proposals for international loans to the Sudan.
The Sudan's poor human rights record and the Khartoum Government's continued war against Southern Sudan are despicable.
A trade embargo is the next likely step, should the United States desire to put more pressure on the Sudan.


If You're Thinking of Living in: Marlboro
GARY VOORHEES, who used to shag fly balls in the cow pastures of Marlboro Township in Monmouth County, has watched his hometown change from a rural agricultural center to a pleasant suburban community.
"When I was young I had a little red wagon that I would pull up and down Main Street, which at the time was the village's only sidewalk," said Mr.
Voorhees, who lives in an 1854 farmhouse his grandfather bought in 1921.


In the Region: Westchester; Hospitals Expand and Add Facilities
A ROOFLESS, boarded-up supermarket that has been an eyesore for years on South Broadway in Yonkers is being transformed into a medical mall with a family health center on the top floor and programs for the elderly on the ground floor.
To meet an increasing demand for medical services in the neighborhood, nearby St.
Joseph's Medical Center in September 1992 bought not only the supermarket, but also the 1.8-acre shopping center it was in, for $1.775 million.
In addition to the supermarket the center had a bank, whose building has been sold back to the bank; a pharmacy, which will be expanded and operated jointly by the hospital and the pharmacist, a vacant building and a 110-space parking lot.


Q and A
Cruise Line Hosts
Q.
I am told single middle-aged men are sometimes given free trips by cruise lines if they will act as social hosts for single female passengers.
Is this true or merely a pipe dream? -- Jim Clayton, Roswell, Ga.


Nuns Have a Stake in a Trotter's Success
SISTER ELLEN KELLY of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd here carries a datebook filled with constant reminders.

Tera Hirsch, Douglas Hoffman
Tera Gretchen Hirsch, the daughter of Corinne and Dr.
Martin Hirsch of Newton, Mass., was married last evening to Douglas Michael Hoffman, the son of Gail and Richard Hoffman of Larchmont, N.Y.
Rabbi David Kudan officiated at the Harvard Faculty Club in Cambridge, Mass.
Ms.
Hirsch, who is keeping her name, is a psychiatric social worker at Central Montgomery Mental Health Center, a nonprofit community health center in Norristown, Pa.
She graduated from Cornell University, as did her husband, and received a master's degree in social work from Bryn Mawr College.
Her father is an internist at the Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, both in Boston.
Her mother is a lawyer at the Massachusetts Appeals Court there.


A Steady Flow of Support For Mullen and Family
Joey Mullen drove down from Boston as soon as he heard the news.
His kid brother and childhood teammate, Brian, an 11-year veteran of the National Hockey League, had suffered a mild stroke on Aug. 11 at his Long Island home and had been rushed to Huntington Hospital.
"Joey got there real quick," the 31-year-old Brian said yesterday from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, where he was transferred last Monday.
"So did the rest of my family."


As to Those Medical Files . . .
To the Editor:
I empathize with your concern for business stimulation.
Reading the article on M.I.B., complete with the bureau's address for readers to secure information on their files, my initial response was to access my file, should it exist.
Then came a second thought: Why stimulate a file if none exists?
You have provided quite a service to M.I.B. to add to its files covering 15 million people.
Please do not, however, forward my name or address to M.I.B.
ROBERT ROWAN Lebanon, N.J., Aug.2


From Work to Workout
Like a treadmill on a finely calibrated program, the search for the perfect workout runs in cycles.
There was the 10-year aerobic cycle of bounce, jump and sweat that spawned Lycra, baggy ankle warmers and high-cut leotards.
Then, target heart ranges auspiciously lowered and knees creaking, the fit sought muscle.
For almost five years, there was a mass bonding with the personal trainer, hours of grunt, strain and push, and shorter tights and tank tops.


Robin Bodell, Henry Fisher 2d
Robin Aldred Bodell, a vice president and corporate trust sales specialist at Bankers Trust Company, was married yesterday to Henry Johnson Fisher 2d, a partner in Hovey, Youngman Associates Inc., investment advisers.
Both work in New York.
The Rev.
J.
Daniel Burke, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony at St.
Peter's Church in Wianno, Mass.
Mrs.
Fisher graduated from Trinity College in Hartford.
She is a daughter of Joseph J. Bodell Jr. of Providence, R.I., and the late Patricia A. Bodell.
Her father was the president of the Providence (R.I.) Investors Company, a mutual fund that merged into MFS Total Return Fund, a Boston mutual fund.


August 15-21; Courts to Solomon: It's Not So Simple
Children's rights, one of the murkiest areas in the law, grew a little more clouded last week because of two Florida court decisions.
In one, a Sarasota judge granted the request of Kimberly Mays, switched at birth with another infant, to remain with the man who has raised her and not to be forced to have contact with her biological parents.
In the second case, an appeals court in Daytona Beach reversed the adoption of "Gregory K.," who last year was allowed to sever all ties with his birth mother.
George Russ, a lawyer who represented Kimberly Mays and also adopted Gregory K., remained optimistic.
"Biology has been paramount until now, but judges and attorneys are starting to realize that the psychological relationship is what can and should be constitutionally protected," he said.
"The trick is to try to translate that into law all over the country."


Four Friends
In Mogadishu, there is no way to avoid the crowds.
Wherever you go, people surround you.
They push, shove and suffocate you -- sometimes curious but often nasty.
They do not trust the United Nations; they do not trust you.
This is the new Mogadishu, starkly different from the one I was introduced to when the American troops landed in December, now three years into civil war and filled with bitterness.
On the streets, it is like a game.
Somalis rub up to you.
Many are either high on khat and grinning or angry and taunting as they motion that they want to slit your throat or shoot you.
Ten-year-olds throw stones and build roadblocks; I've seen women pull out knives.


ONE-WEEK STAND
'The Bridges of Madison County" was given to me by a 44-year-old neighbor who said: "Here.
You'll hate this book" (Public Stages: "One-Week Stand," by Frank Rich, July 25). I think I know how she feels. In light of the book's perplexing popularity, she says that she fears for the future of our country. For me, it has become a litmus test of taste. Perhaps it would be wise to include something about it on computer-dating questionnaires. Think how ghastly it would be to find out on your honeymoon that your spouse loved the book.

Singing the Praises of Sweet Alyssum
SOME may think it a waste of space.
Others not.
But it is time to sing the praises of a dainty, yet undaunted annual.
So here goes.
The lucky plant is none other than that somewhat lowly garden favorite, sweet alyssum.
This has not been an easy summer for any plants.
The heat coupled with high humidity and lack of good soaking rainfall has seared many ornamental plants including some valuable shrubbery.
Some plants are thirsty and drooping.
Some have wilting leaves and no flowers.
Some plants have even died.


Ira Bogner and Amy Eisenberg
Dr.
Amy Eisenberg, the daughter of Alan and Hannah Eisenberg of Princeton, N.J., was married last evening to Ira G. Bogner, the son of Allan and Sandy Bogner of Irvington, N.Y.
Rabbi Martin Freedman officiated at the Headquarters Plaza Hotel in Morristown, N.J.
Dr.
Eisenberg, 26, is keeping her name.
She is a first-year resident in pediatrics at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.
She and her husband graduated cum laude from Brandeis University.
She received her M.D. from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.


What Should Take Precedence?
To the Editor:
After reading Edward Rothstein's essay "Rare Beauty From a Time of Horror"  [ Aug. 1 ] , about the release by Teldec of disks featuring performances recorded in Nazi Germany, I wondered if the artistry of the performance should take precedence over the ghastly circumstances that created the performance in the first place?
Many of the artists Mr.
Rothstein mentioned got their start in the business because of Nazi racial laws that terminated employment for others. (The lucky ones came to the United States; the fate of the unlucky need not be reiterated.)


Susan D. Blackman, Whitney R. Tilson
Kenneth and Meryl Blackman of Armonk, N.Y., have announced October wedding pland for their daughter, Susan Dana Blackman, and Whitney Richard Tilson, the son of Thomas and Susan Tilson of Washington.
Miss Blackman, 25, graduated magna cum laude from Brown University and received a law degree from Harvard University.
She will join the New York law firm of Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel as an associate in October.
Her father is a partner at the New York law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson.


Man Killed and Boy, 6, Injured In Separate Random Shootings
Random gunfire erupted in two Brooklyn neighborhoods yesterday, killing a 60-year-old man as he chatted with a friend about going fishing today and wounding a 6-year-old boy sitting on his grandmother's lap on the way to buy sneakers for his first day in first grade, the police and witnesses said.
The two unrelated incidents occurred within 15 minutes of each other.
No one was arrested in either shooting, the police said.

Sound Bytes; At Micrografx, Adversity Embraced as the Spice of Life
AS chairman and chief executive of the Micrografx Corporation of Richardson, Tex., J. Paul Grayson runs the maker of Designer, Windows Draw, Picture Publisher and other highly regarded Windows graphics programs.
The company also wrote the graphics portion of I.B.M.'s OS/2 2.1 operating system.
Micrografx is a classic American software story, with highs and lows: brothers Paul and George Grayson started the company in 1982 at a kitchen table.
A decade later, the company had gone public and had 1992 sales of $63 million.
But it was losing money and the company's stock has been battered, falling from a high of over $20 last year to less than $7 last week.

August 15-21; The B.C.C.I. Trial: Without a Smoking Gun, Robert Altman Is Acquitted
After a state court trial lasting nearly five months, a Manhattan jury last weekend acquitted Robert A. Altman of criminal fraud charges in the international scandal surrounding the activities of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which included money laundering and illegal capital transfers on behalf of governments and individuals worldwide.
Depositors lost an estimated $12 billion.
But the case against the Washington lawyer was notable as much for what did not go into the voluminous record as for what did.


Ms. Taliaferro and Mr. Hiland
Cassandra Lee Taliaferro, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Leland L. Taliaferro of New York, was married yesterday to Christopher Page Hiland, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Early Success for a Late Entry
She has only recently entered the sport and, at age 28, is a relatively late bloomer.
But just the fact that she is here is an accomplishment.
Robin Umphrey of Huntington Beach, Calif., was about to become a police officer four years ago so she began training in a self-defense class.
She tried taekwondo, became hooked, and after training with Roland Ferrer, the 1988 national champion, she is California's three-time state champion in the heavyweight division.


Clinton Among the Swells
Has Bill Clinton, restlessly seeking a summer White House he can call his own, found his Casa Atlantica in Martha's Vineyard?
The fit is pretty good, if not perfect.
Mr.
Clinton likes policy, and Martha's Vineyard is loaded with policymakers.
He likes celebrities, and Martha's Vineyard has them, too.
He doesn't much like media folk, which the Vineyard is also full of, but then again nobody's ever found a picnic spot without bugs.
Parts of Martha's Vineyard are basically Washington moved upstream.
There are plenty of people there who do not consider themselves movers and shakers.
But with Walter Cronkite and Kay Graham and Bob McNamara and Vernon ("I'm just another islander") Jordan as neighbors, no one is going to confuse the place with Lake of the Ozarks.


Quiet White Sox Could Use Some of That Great Chicago Fire
Gene Lamont was discussing the enigma of the American League West -- the Chicago White Sox -- the other day, searching for reasons that have prevented the team he manages from taking a commanding lead.
"Probably as much as anything," Lamont said, "we haven't been real consistent offensively."
That evening, as if to support their manager's assessment, the White Sox got only one hit against Danny Darwin at Fenway Park, where no one has pitched a no-hitter in 28 years.
It was the 11th time the White Sox had been shut out, the most in the league.


From Dr. Welby to Dr. Giggles, a Steep Slide
The blood of budget battles washed from his hands, President Clinton is finally focused on health-care reform and promises a sweeping package of proposals sometime around the autumnal equinox.
But if recent movies and television shows are any indication, the nation's medical system needs more than a Government action plan to salvage its reputation.
It needs more than managed competition or a single-payer system to make people trust the health-care business again.
What medicine really needs is a delicious blockbuster of a movie about a doctor who is not evil or arrogant or lewd or avaricious.
It needs a film in which nurses are neither ditsy and sexy nor imperious and sadistic.
A television show about a hospital in which the right operations are done on the right people at the right time, and the ailments of the system do not exceed those of the patients.
A hard-working, soft-spoken hero who battles life-threatening illness, not a malevolent bureaucracy.


Sea Hero Turns the Travers Into a Rerun of Kentucky Derby
Sea Hero, who won the Kentucky Derby last spring but then lost three races in a row, made a smashing comeback today when he won the $1 million Travers Stakes by two lengths over Kissin Kris and reclaimed the leadership of racing's 3-year-old division.
It was sweet success for the colt, who touched racing people across the country when he won the Derby for his 86-year-old owner, Paul Mellon, and his 71-year-old trainer, MacKenzie Miller.
But he also puzzled people across the country when he ran fifth in the Preakness, seventh in the Belmont Stakes and fourth in the Jim Dandy only three weeks ago.


A Bookie-Licensing Bill Argues a Senator's Point
Wending its way through the New Jersey legislative process is a bill that would require bookies, including office pool operators, to be licensed.
State Senator C. Louis Bassano, a Republican from Union, is sponsoring the legislation, which would require a person to obtain a license from the State Treasurer at a cost of $1,000 a year "prior to conducting bookmaking."


Why Late-Night TV Is a Man's World
It's a male, male, male, male world.
Later this month, late-night comedy will undergo perhaps its biggest shake-up since Ed McMahon first hollered "Here's Johnny" back in 1962.
On Aug. 30, David Letterman will make his much-discussed, intensely analyzed and heavily promoted move to CBS.
Two weeks later, Conan O'Brien, the nation's most famous "virtually unknown" comic, will replace him on NBC, following Jay Leno.


Cyberpunk Tenets
To the Editor:
In "The Evolution of Cyberpunk" (Aug. 8) your reporters listed four "fundamental tenets" of this techno-cultural movement, attributing them to "Mondo 2000, a User's Guide to the New Edge." Among them were verbatim elements of my 1984 book "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution." The "Mondo" book credited the source, but the Times article did not.
I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight.

Making a Driveway Last Years Longer
AN asphalt driveway will last 20 years or more with minimal care and remain reasonably attractive for the duration.
Without attention, signs of aging can appear in as few as five years, and minor damage can quickly become a major problem.
Minimal care consists primarily of repairing cracks as they develop.
Also, the driveway should be coated with sealer every three to five years; this helps to protect it from sunlight and chemicals like road salt and bolsters water-resistance.


Man's Work?
To the Editor:
Francis X. Clines's article about Peterborough, N. H.  [ "Through the Looking Glass and Into 'Our Town,' " Aug. 1 ] , reminded me that I used to like Thornton Wilder's play, both in reading it and in performance.
I still do, up until that last scene.


Say Mike &amp; Mike Five Times
To The Editor:
We at Mike &amp; Mike were pleased to see our Bandanna Cap featured (Surfacing, Aug 8).
However, we were disappointed to see that the article did not mention Mike &amp; Mike as the creator of the cap.
We are sure that this omission was an oversight and that it can be corrected by printing this letter (which contains five Mike &amp; Mike mentions).
Thank you for including Mike &amp; Mike in your paper.

Saberhagen Goes Down Again; Mets, Too
The Mets suffered more misfortune today, both at home and away.
On Long Island, pitcher Bret Saberhagen -- on the disabled list because of a knee injury -- was hurt in a boating accident.
He called the Met clubhouse at Mile High Stadium to alert the team while it was out on the field kicking the baseball around in a doubleheader loss to the expansion Colorado Rockies, 4-3 and 8-6.

She graduated from Connecticut College.
Her father is the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey in Trenton.


A Severe Modernist's Surprising Lyricism
Maybe you can't judge a book by its cover but what about its title?
The most influential book of photographs by the German modernist master Albert Renger-Patzsch (1897-1966) was published in 1928 under the catchy title "Die Welt ist schon" ("The World Is Beautiful").
To many in photography today, this breezy phrase is better known than the book itself, or even Renger-Patzsch's sharp-focus, geometrical images.
The catalogue for the survey of Renger-Patzsch's work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (through Sept. 26) points out that the book was given this title by its publisher, Kurt Wolff; Renger-Patzsch himself wanted to call it simply "Die Dinge" ("Things").
For him, photography was a way of recreating the order of things through the order of the photograph.
His pictures of factories, mines, architecture, even flowers and animals, have an unwavering precision that is almost painful in its purity, like the obsessions of a saint.


Corrections
An article and a picture caption on Aug. 8 about the evolution of cyberpunk misattributed the invention of the "data glove" and misstated the date.
Thomas G. Zimmerman, not Jaron Lanier, was awarded a patent in 1985, not 1989, for an "optical flex sensor," which he had sewed into a glove in 1981, enabling him to manipulate objects on a computer screen.


BEIJING PROMISES CORRUPTION FIGHT
The Communist Party announced a major crackdown on corruption today, with President Jiang Zemin warning that graft threatens the future of the party itself.
"Corruption is the virus that has eroded the healthy body of the party and the state," Mr.
Jiang, who is also Communist Party leader, said in a keynote address to a six-day official conference called to attack the problem.
"If we lower our guard and let it run wild, our party will be ruined, the people's power will be lost, and the great cause of socialist modernization will be forced off track."

The Regional Approach To Library Use
This is in response to the recent article on Robert White ("Looming Colossus of the Library World").
Although I have enormous respect for Mr.
White's abilities and achievements, it is my opinion that his technological plan, which focuses on resource sharing among public libraries, will, if implemented, set library services back at least 10 years.
The philosophy of the public library as the main materials resource ended when state legislation established the concept of multitype libraries cooperating within a specified area, to provide all libraries in that area with the widest possible information base.

Will a Seminole Wind Blow Come Autumn?
The house that Bobby Bowden rebuilt is a work in progress.
Giant brick facades and majestic archways have begun to obscure the Erector Set architecture of Doak Campbell Stadium, making the home of the Florida State Seminoles suddenly appear stately enough that Red Grange could have played there in the days when the school was a college for women and the business of high-stakes football was conducted elsewhere.


A Big-City Horror in a Small Town
When searchers found the bludgeoned body of Derrick Robie, age 4 years, 10 months, in a clump of trees on the edge of a park, the residents of this upstate village overcame shock and horror to behave with all the virtues that are associated with small towns.
Ministers consoled the parents of the boy and made arrangements for his funeral.
Friends and neighbors came by with home-baked cakes and food while others made plans for a Labor Day country-and-western concert to help pay the costs of saying farewell to Derrick.


A Multitude of Sins and Egocentric Traits
To the Editor:
I find myself much in sympathy with Gore Vidal on the subject of pride, "when it defies those dominations and powers that enslave us" (July 4).
I would argue, however, that his summary of the plot of "Paradise Lost" has been colored by his own image of a Lucifer who "blazes most attractively while God seems more arbitrary and self-regarding than ever."


At Work; Man, Office and Mechanical Bride
SOMETIMES a cigar is just a cigar, said Sigmund Freud, but usually it's not.
Everyday objects have meaning as well as utility, a point made wittily by the exhibit that opened last week at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York.
"Mechanical Brides: Women and Machines From Home to Office," as the exhibit is called, juxtaposes objects used in what is typically regarded as "women's work" -- the washing machine, telephone and typewriter -- with images used over the years to sell the objects.
It is a painless, fascinating nutshell history of America's romance with consumption, socio-economic changes associated with that romance in the last century and the different experiences of men and women.
In the late 19th century, technological innovations transformed the middle-class household.
Women who had labored at -- or supervised -- the production of food, clothing and furniture or housewares became consumers of mass-produced goods.
The male-dominated world of commerce learned to sell its products to women, or rather, to the prevailing cultural stereotypes of women, appealing to emotions as well as utility.
"Everything your heart desires," promised a Eureka swivel-top vacuum cleaner ad reprinted in a book called "Mechanical Brides" published by the Cooper-Hewitt and the Princeton Architectural Press.
"So quiet!" "Adjustable suction!" "Gets it all!" "Follow your heart (and commonsense, too)."


Company's Failure Strands 4,000 Tourists in U.S.
Wiebke Johannpeter was supposed to be flying back to Germany today after a relaxing three-week vacation in Southern California.

Ms.
Johannpeter is among about 4,000 Germans who purchased cut-rate trips to the United States and are now stranded here and in other cities.

The Real Reason for Sweeping Yards Is Snakes
To the Editor:
"In Georgia's Swept Yards, a Dying Tradition" (front page, Aug. 8) never really tells why old African-Americans sweep their yards.
I was born 41 years ago in the low-country region of South Carolina and raised within the swamp-ridden region of Walterboro, near the sea islands, where all the old-time blacks swept their yards with daily persistence.


Wall Street; A Gift for Buying Low on the Bayou
THE cajun chefs of the bayou country are known for their aptitude at cooking up a spicy repast.
But their seasoning is bland compared with the hot stock of one local Louisiana operation.
Shares of Skylink America Inc., a Dallas-based operation whose most valuable asset is a permit to run a Baton Rouge gambling boat, soared to $5.625 a share by Friday's close, up 1003 percent from a puny $.50 a share on May 3.


A Multitude of Sins and Egocentric Traits
To the Editor:
From the reference to Cain and Abel in A. S. Byatt's essay on envy (July 18), one might infer that God made the psychological mistake of showing favoritism to one of Adam and Eve's two sons.
But a close examination of Genesis reveals that the Creator knew (in some way that is not revealed) that Cain had presented an "offering" without sincerity.
Then, like a dutiful parent, upon observing Cain's anger and downcast appearance, He lectured Cain, telling him that if one puts honest effort into what one does, good will come of it.
God was guiding and correcting after He saw Cain's sour face.

Summer of Reflection and Renewal Restores Rangers
It's never too warm or too early to think Pucks.
Even as we speak, the Rangers are running their thumbs over their skate blades.
The team reassembles in 16 days.
"I can't wait to get started," said Mark Messier, staring at the sea from his beach house in Hilton Head, S.C.
His voice was fuller, less strained than it had been when the team's involuntary vacation began last April 18.
"We all went around with a pit in our stomachs last season, and there've been a lot of sleepless nights this summer," he said.
"It took me a long time to heal -- the inner wounds, too."

Mickelson Leads The International by 3
With a game built for birdies in a format that amply rewards them, left-handed Phil Mickelson took command of The International going into today's final-round shootout.
In the modified Stableford system that counts 5 points for an eagle, 2 for a birdie, 0 for a par, minus 1 for a bogey and minus 3 for a double bogey or worse, Mickelson, 23, compiled 11 points today over the Castle Pines Golf Club for a 54-hole total of 29 points.

Mourning the Funeral Industry's Ethics
To the Editor:
Upon reading Allen R. Myerson's "This Man Wants to Bury You" (Aug. 1), I dusted off Jessica Mitford's 1963 best-seller, "The American Way of Death." Ms.
Mitford correctly predicted that 1) the "Dismal Trade" was so overcrowded and inefficient that high-volume supermarket types of funeral establishments would evolve; 2) resulting cost efficiencies would not be passed on to consumers, and 3) exposes of the high cost of dying and the industry's secrecy and purposeful promotion of misconceptions (i.e., that embalming is required by law) would appear every decade or so and not have the slightest effect on the upward spiral of the cost of a funeral.


A MILD CASE
I feel sorry for young Sam Hersch.
My feelings have nothing to do with cerebral palsy, mild or otherwise.
They are directly related to his father's perception of him: "muscles"; "normal child"; "fathers"; "park"; "ball"; "daughters"; "not the same."


Trying Other Methods
WHILE Pleasantville has taken one innovative approach to the perennial problem of youth employment, other communities in the county have tackled the situation with different methods.
In Peekskill, the quest for meaningful summer employment that would address the needs of the community as well as those of the area's youth has taken the form of Project Echo, a program of the Peekskill Area Health Center.
Intended for youth 14 through 20, this program, now in its second year, has 24 participants.
They earn $5 an hour for a 20-hour workweek; the program lasts six weeks.

They'll Always See Fit to Change Writers' Babies
To the Editor:
Would you mind making just one change to Jill C. Wheeler's story, "Martin the Copywriter's Office Reverie" (Viewpoints, Aug. 8)?
Where the wall poster says man's greatest weakness is "the overwhelming desire to edit another's copy," change that to, "No passion in the world is equal to the passion to alter someone else's zdraft." -- H. G. Wells.
Now doesn't that improve it?

Deaths of Wild Horses Brought to Jersey Prompt U.S. Review
A FEDERAL sale of wild horses and burros here was called off last Saturday after three mustangs died of an unknown ailment hours before the event.
Then, when a fourth horse that became ill shortly afterward had to be destroyed, officials started a review last week of the transportation and boarding procedures for the wild horse program and are already making some changes.
The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, which sponsors the program, is investigating the possibility of a connection between the deaths here and those of five wild horses in May at a similar sale at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.


Peel Her a Grape

"Who is that woman with the bubble wand?" one man asked his companion.


It All Comes Out in the Wash
Once, at the end of a drought-stricken summer, I traveled a great distance to visit a friend with terminal cancer.
As befits such an occasion, the trip took on the nature of a quest.
First, the 125-mile drive across the burnt-brown grassland to the Bismarck, N.D., airport; a plane to Minneapolis and then to La Guardia, where I waited nearly two hours for my suitcase; a bus into Manhattan; a taxi to a crowded Penn Station, where I stood for another two hours waiting for a train.
It was August, and all the city's heat seemed concentrated in that room.
But I am so unused to crowds of strangers that I felt a strange contentment in their midst.
Contentment turned to bliss on the train ride to Rhode Island; the trees seemed tropically luxuriant, the Atlantic Ocean a wonder.
My friend's husband met me at the small-town station near their farm and filled me in on his wife's condition.
She was recovering from a round of chemotherapy, weak but in good spirits.
She was reading in bed when I arrived, but soon roused herself and led me to a cramped room off the kitchen.
The ovarian tumor had made her bloat like a starved child, and she moved and spoke slowly.
"I've been saving this for you," she said, gesturing to three large baskets full of clothes.
"Dimir would wash it all together," she went on, "and he fills the machine too full. And," she concluded, lowering her voice, "he'd put it in the dryer. Men don't understand that laundry must be hung on the line."


A New Approach for Marvin Hamlisch
MARVIN HAMLISCH is easy -- and calming down.
Sure, he will talk of the chemistry of his historic collaboration with Joe Papp, Michael Bennett and Ed Kleban on "A Chorus Line," although he says he is still devastated by the deaths of those members of "a team that has been impossible to re-create."
And he will reminisce about other legends that shaped his life, including Groucho, Judy, Liza and Barbra .
When it comes to honest-to-God name dropping, nobody does it better.


James A. Leynse, Wendy L. Hunnewell
Wendy Lee Hunnewell, a daughter of Lila and Charles G. Hunnewell of Rockaway Township, N.J., was married there yesterday to James Aaron Leynse, a son of Judith L. Leynse of New York and the late Humphrey W. Leynse.
The Rev.
Paul Ratzlaff, a Unitarian Universalist minister, performed the ceremony at the White Meadow Lake Country Club.
Mrs.
Leynse, 24, will begin studies for a master's degree in French cultural studies next month at Reid Hall, Columbia University's center in Paris.
She graduated from Cornell University.
Her father is a sales administration analyst for the Warner Lambert Company in Morris Plains, N.J.
Her mother is a writer and an editor in Rockaway Township.


Political Memo; Troubled Mayor Seeks to Shift Campaign's Focus to Giuliani
Mayor David N. Dinkins had a bad week.
He's also had a bad month.
In fact, he's had a pretty bad year, and even his friends agree that he badly needs a couple of weeks of favorable breaks -- and soon -- if he is to avoid the worst break of all: defeat on Nov. 2.
By last week Mr.
Dinkins's problems had accumulated to such a degree that a consensus, building among the city's politicians for months, seemed to have crystallized: that the race for mayor might well be Rudolph W. Giuliani's to lose.
Problems and a Paradox
But paradoxically, the Mayor's supporters and opponents agreed, that very consensus could be an asset for Mr.
Dinkins, by changing the dynamics of the campaign and intensifying the focus not only on his fitness to be mayor, but on Mr.
Giuliani's.


Our Itinerant Houdini Took a Silver Pot From His Black Box
To the Editor:
For daily subway commuters, it is an uncommon ride when buskers and beggars are not packed in with us, silently waiting until the doors close out our only means of escape.
Some people sell a homeless newspaper, telling us they are willing to work for what they get; others have a variety of afflictions, from AIDS and tuberculosis to blindness.
Each has a story to tell and a cup in his or her hand.


In Torrington, Spicy Subcontinental Fare
INDIAN restaurants are so rare in Connecticut that discovering Indo-Bangla in Torrington comes as a treat for any fan of the hot, well-spiced food of the subcontinent.
That's the good news.
The less happy report is that one wishes it were better.
It's not just that the restaurant itself is so lackluster -- a large, characterless room in a freestanding building, with wood-veneer booths, low ceiling and tile flooring.
None of that would matter if the food tasted fresher and had more zest and zip.
It wasn't bad; in fact, a few dishes were actually delicious, but many others tasted as though the kitchen were just going through the motions.


Istanbul, the Capital of Carpet Shops
Ibought my first Oriental carpet five years ago at a small shop called Pasha's Carpet Gallery off Taksim Square in Istanbul.
The name alone, emblazoned in English, should have tipped me off.
But dazzled by the beauty and feel of the thick wool pile, I laid out two or three hundred dollars more than I should have and lugged my purchase, a wool Hereke of indifferent quality, home in a bulky vinyl bag.

Hiring a New Boss? Look No Further
Gerard R. Roche and Thomas J. Neff could not exactly be called birds of a feather.
While Mr.
Roche is a registered Democrat, Mr.
Neff is a staunch Republican.
A former McKinsey consultant, Mr.
Neff approaches his craft like a scientist, while Mr.
Roche is a born storyteller who came close to becoming a Jesuit priest.
But there is one thing on which Mr.
Roche and Mr.
Neff firmly agree: When it comes to recruiting the nation's chief executives, they own the market -- and would rather not have to share it.


Metamorphosis
Picasso's "Demoiselles d'Avignon" is regarded as a masterpiece.
But its qualities were not immediately apparent -- as Howard Gardner relates in this excerpt from "Creating Minds," published this month by Basic Books.
Picasso's ambivalence toward "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" was heightened by the reaction of his acquaintances and friends.
Even those who had admired his earlier work did not know what to make of it.
Reactions ranged from confusion or mystification (Gertrude and Leo Stein, Braque) to downright rage (Matisse).
Only two dealers, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and Wilhelm Uhde, showed interest.
Kahnweiler later recalled: "What I'd like to make you realize at once is the incredible heroism of a man like Picasso, whose moral loneliness was, at the time, quite horrifying, for none of his painter friends had followed him. Everyone found that picture crazy or monstrous."


SAUDI STABILITY HIT BY HEAVY SPENDING OVER LAST DECADE
Saudi Arabia, long seen as one of the world's wealthiest countries, has undermined its financial stability with a decade of unrestrained spending, huge military purchases and irregular banking practices.
The $121 billion in financial reserves amassed by Saudi Arabia less than a decade ago have almost vanished, drained by expenditures for weapons, social programs, foreign aid and the Gulf war.
The spending has far outstripped the tens of billions of dollars earned annually from the largest oilfields in the world, which the Government owns.


Streetscapes: 4 East 54th Street; A Debit, or Added Interest?
THE Banco di Napoli has proposed a two-floor addition on the five-story landmarked McKim, Mead &amp; White town house at 4 East 54th Street.
The addition will not touch the facade, but will noticeably change the building's character.
The Landmarks Preservation Commission will hold a hearing on the project Tuesday.
Should it permit the addition, and concentrate on the existing building, or should it protect both the architecture and the ambiance?


Waivers: More Than a Warning
WHEN Dan and Sylvia Larsen of Oriental, N.C., visited Alaska last month, they signed up for a three-hour rafting trip with Nenana Raft Adventures on the Nenana River adjoining Denali National Park.
On the bus, they were given a "participant agreement, release and acknowledgment of risk," which indemnified the outfitter from liability, even for negligence.
"When I returned the forms to the representative unsigned," Mr.
Larsen wrote, "and told him we wanted to withdraw, he said in amazement, 'You mean you actually read those sheets?' "
"We did not make the trip, and learned later that we missed a great experience," Mr.
Larsen said.
"I have no idea whether we did the right thing, because friends have suggested to us that release forms are largely unenforceable in most states when negligence is actually a factor. If so, then what purpose do they serve?"

Wall Street; A Gift for Buying Low on the Bayou
THE cajun chefs of the bayou country are known for their aptitude at cooking up a spicy repast.
But their seasoning is bland compared with the hot stock of one local Louisiana operation.
Shares of Skylink America Inc., a Dallas-based operation whose most valuable asset is a permit to run a Baton Rouge gambling boat, soared to $5.625 a share by Friday's close, up 1003 percent from a puny $.50 a share on May 3.

Cervantes on Leisure
To the Editor:
Reading "Relax? Relax and Do What?" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (Op-Ed, Aug. 12), which compares the value-satisfaction levels of work versus relaxation, I was reminded that Cervantes said it four centuries ago: "The road is better than the inn."  MARK FRENCH  Forest Hills, Queens, Aug. 17, 1993


Q and A
Unwanted Subtenants Question: I own a co-op apartment on the Upper West Side and am about to sublease to a young couple for two months.
If the new tenants refuse to vacate at the termination of their two-month sublease is there anything I can do short of a protracted and expensive suit? . . .
Marvin Sochet, Manhattan Answer: Maybe.
According to Barry Werbin, a Manhattan lawyer, if the subtenants refuse to vacate the apartment your only option may be to proceed with litigation.
Eviction, however, can be accomplished by way of a summary proceeding, which, in many cases, according to Mr.
Werbin, is not terribly protracted or overwhelmingly expensive.
Mr.
Werbin added that you should not take matters into your own hands by changing the locks or in any way trying to take back your apartment.
If you do, he said, you may expose yourself to a lawsuit from your sub-tenants.
Even though there is no written sublease or agreement, Mr.
Werbin noted that the subtenants, by virtue of their occupancy of the apartment for more than 30 days, have what is, in effect, a month-to-month lease and an oral contract.
Reserve-Fund Assessment Question: My Brooklyn co-op apartment building has recently been assessed for $150,000 to build up our reserve fund, which was depleted after some capital improvements.
I know assessments for capital improvements are within the board's province, but is is legal for them to assess us just to have a larger reserve fund with no capital improvements pending? . . .
Leonard J. Katz, Brooklyn Answer: Yes.
According to Carl Schwartz, a Manhattan lawyer, typically, proprietary leases permit a co-op's board of directors to assess shareholders for all of the cash requirements of the corporation.
Cash requirements, Mr.
Schwartz added, usually include any so-called "cash on hand" that the co-operative's board of directors determines to be necessary and proper.
Loan on 5-Unit Building Question: My home is a unit in a five-unit building, which I own.
There is no mortgage on the property at present, but it seems to be impossible to secure a home equity line of credit or a mortgage.
The only thing I have found is a very limited mortgage through the Chase Development Corporation.
Bank, credit-union and saving-institution loan officers have told me that the building can only contain four units to qualify for the home equity line of credit or a regular mortgage.
Is this true?
Why is this? . . .
Constancia Romilly, Manhattan Answer: Yes.
According to Margaret Scott, president of the Mortgage Advisory Service, a mortgage broker in Manhattan, lenders generally won't grant home equity lines of credit or make residential mortgages on properties with more than four units.
She said that the four-units guideline has been adopted by most lenders because that is the standard set by Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Association, a quasi-governmental agency that is the primary buyer of mortgages in the secondary market.
Incidentially, Ms.
Scott noted, home equity lines of credit are, in essence, nothing more than new mortgages.
Ms.
Scott also said that you would might be eligible to apply for commercial loan.
This kind of loan, however, would almost always carry a higher interest rate and take longer to process.
Moreover, the income qualification will also be based on your rental income from the units, not your own income.
"It is a major problem that I deal with," Ms.
Scott said.
"It is too bad that more lenders won't finance five-unit houses.
"There used to be a few lenders that used to do that," she added.
"But as things have tightened up, they no longer will."

Rhode Island Legislator Wants Top Judge Out
In the first indication that a scandal involving the State Supreme Court is dividing Democrats, the Speaker of the Rhode Island House has called for the resignation of the Chief Justice to remove what he called a cloud hanging over the state's judiciary.

At SUNY Purchase, 'The Trip to Bountiful'
NOTHING much happens in "The Trip to Bountiful," only that a woman replenishes her soul.
Mrs.
Carrie Watts, cooped up in a two-room Houston apartment with a wimpy son (Ludie) and a pestering, thoroughly unpleasant daughter-in-law (Jessie Mae), dreams of returning to Bountiful, her hometown, once more before dying.
Heaven knows she's tried, over and over, to run away.
But Ludie and Jessie Mae keep getting her back from the train station.
This time Carrie heads for the bus though there's no Bountiful stop; the town, with no one now in it, is 12 miles from Cotton or Harrison.
But for Carrie it will be enough to look at her house, what's left of it, to smell the ocean breeze that wafts from the Gulf and to put her hands in the soil.
To Jessie Mae, a shack in an ugly swamp is all it is.


Two Myths About Mexico
Will the North American Free Trade Agreement unleash economic growth throughout the Americas, as proponents promise, improving environmental and labor standards in the process?
Or will it undermine U.S. jobs and wages, as critics charge?
Much of the debate is based on two myths: that Mexico's export sector is limited to low-tech and low-productivity operations and that world-class wages in Mexico will automatically follow world-class productivity.

2 Months of Downpours and Surging Rivers Redraw Map of Midwest
Every major flood is a cartographer, and this year's two-month surge of water, the worst in recorded history for the Upper Mississippi Valley, has been particularly hard on the map and the bridges, roads and railroad tracks that stitch it together.
In rearranging much of the land and the modern human trappings in the Midwest, the Great Flood of '93 has forever altered the way some people live and work, carrying landmarks out of communities and severing age-old links between one town and the next.

IF any more evidence were needed of his huge stake in the North American Free Trade Agreement, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari offered it generously as negotiations finally came to an end.

When that wasn't enough for some congressmen in Washington, Mr.
Salinas promised to give millions of Mexican workers a pay raise by linking the minimum wage to productivity.

The Dissents From Russia's Frayed Edges
THE predominant tone of Moscow commentary on the anniversary of the failed coup of Aug. 19-21, 1991, has been the plangent sound of opportunities missed -- the chances to secure Russian democracy, to write a new constitution, to elect a new parliament, to create real political parties and so on.
But Russia's provinces, beyond the beltway of Moscow's tortuous politics, have in fact seized their opportunities.
They have made the most of Moscow's nasty, noisy, self-reverential struggle -- and the power vacuum it created -- by grabbing as much autonomy as they can.


Toward a Department of Extremely General Services
LAST week, Vice President Al Gore proposed merging two overlapping and competing agencies -- the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration -- into a single lean, mean supercop for the war on crime, crime being pretty much related, it turns out, to drugs.
Actually, Richard Nixon created the Drug Enforcement Administration two decades ago from his own patchwork of overlapping and competing agencies, reasoning that drugs were too insidious to leave to ordinary cops.
No matter; it's time once again to reorganize and streamline Government.


Brooklyn Shootings of 6 Are Linked to Same Gun
Investigators believe that a gun used to kill one man and critically injure a woman in a Brooklyn neighborhood 10 days ago was also used in three other shootings a few blocks away two days later in which three men were killed and a fourth was seriously wounded.
Ballistics tests determined that the same 9-millimeter gun was used in all the shootings, said Officer Merri Pearsall, a police spokeswoman.
In one instance, the gunman demanded money, she said, but investigators have been unable to establish a motive in the rest.

They'll Always See Fit to Change Writers' Babies
To the Editor:
Once, as an editor and writer for an important human relations agency, I pointed out to some of the organization's executives that there was a slight problem in the slogan, "Who's Threatening Who?" on an agency poster.
The last who, I explained, should be whom.
I was curtly told to my mind own business; whom had been pondered -- and proscribed.
The agency wanted to reach the masses, and it was felt that whom would turn them off; it was too refined.
It seems that writers who work for nonliterary or antiliterary types (quillistines?) are doomed to endure doses of near-lethal aggravation.

Parking Bureau Issue Gives Giuliani What He Sought
For weeks, Rudolph W. Giuliani had been chipping away at the theme that Mayor David N. Dinkins was an ineffective leader not given to focusing upon the details of governing.
He had charged in one news conference after another that the administration was prone to cronyism and overprotective of incompetent assistants.
Then the Lockheed affair fell into the headlines last week like fruit from a tree.
Mr.
Giuliani could hardly resist the chance to gloat.
Calling the awarding of a Parking Violations Bureau contract to Lockheed Information Management Systems a "total mess-up," he used the issue to raise broader questions about the competence of the Dinkins administration.
In appearance after appearance, he trotted out questions about a pending lease between the city and the United States Tennis Association, the asbestos cleanup in city schools and the management of the Offtrack Betting Corporation.
He repeatedly urged reporters to "get out there and dig." He suggested that the Parking Violations Bureau situation, in which the Mayor's top aides were criticized for giving preferential treatment to Lockheed, was "a good place to start."

In America; Favoring One Company
In his inaugural speech, on Jan. 1, 1990, Mayor David Dinkins promised that his administration would "never lead by dividing, by setting some of us against the rest of us, or by favoring one group over others."
While he was offering this promise to a huge crowd assembled in the cold outside City Hall, top officials at a company called Lockheed Information Management Services had other matters in mind.
They were already plotting their variation on the theme of favoritism.


A Multitude of Sins and Egocentric Traits

Updike then comments, "The singleness of flesh is itself a vivid metaphor for copulation."

Air Terminal For Hawaii
A new Interisland Terminal has opened at Honolulu International Airport on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.
More than eight million passengers a year fly among the state's six largest islands: Hawaii, Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Lanai.
According to a spokesman for the airport, the new terminal will be used by Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines and will accommodate approximately 90 percent of interisland traffic.


In an Off Year, Some Collectors Are Still Going Over the Top
This may well be remembered as the year two bidders seemed out of control, raising the price of a 19th-century calculator, valued at $30,000, to $11.8 million.
Edgar Mannheimer, the Swiss dealer who bought the mechanism by telephone in May at Christie's in London, later reneged on his purchase, claiming he was ill and on medication during the auction.
Thus, the only spectacular price achieved in an auction of artifacts this year was never paid.
The sale was indicative of the continued problems in the market for period objects.
Prices are down, sales are off, and the records at auction are far fewer in number and less impressive than in many years.


Yvonne Galindo and Stephen Case
Yvonne Galindo, a daughter of Anibal and Georgina Galindo of Coral Gables, Fla., was married on Friday to Stephen Thomas Case, the son of Reginald and Bonnie Case of Peekskill, N.Y.
The Rev.
Heidi Hoskin, a Congregational minister, and the Rev.
Rene Lima, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated at the Plymouth Congregational Church in Coconut Grove, Fla.

She and her husband received master's degrees in architecture from Yale University.


Next Best Thing to the Dance Floor
At the newly formed National Croquet Gallery in the Newport Art Museum, there is an exhibition called "The Art of Croquet." It is not, and does not pretend to be, an exhibition of major art, but it will give pleasure and amusement to every amateur of that most insidious of summer games.
In terms of painterly achievement, the show (on view through March 1) is dominated by a small masterpiece of precocity, the "Game of Croquet" by Louise Abbema.
Abbema in adult life was a fascinating and controversial figure, best known for her long association with Sarah Bernhardt.
But in 1872, when she was still only a schoolgirl, she astonished many people in Paris by painting the "Game of Croquet," in which nothing is either childish, tentative or immature.


Assertions of Sexual Harassment and a Teacher Is Dismissed
For more than a year, the 15-year-old said, she had been uncomfortable in the presence of a social studies teacher who pulled her into unwanted hugs, made comments like, "You look delicious," talked about taking her out on a date and called her "my wife."
Last September, she filed a formal complaint with the school district after the teacher, Ronald Cappello, allegedly asked her to stay after a class at Saunders Trades and Technical High School and then physically blocked her from leaving the room as he badgered her to allow him to drive her to work.
When other students finally opened the door, she said, she ran out in tears, leaving her books and coat behind.

RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Becker to Play Courier  Third-seeded Boris Becker, who has never lost to second-seeded Jim Courier in six previous meetings, will get a chance to extend the streak today in the championship match of the RCA Hardcourts championships in Indianapolis.
Becker, ranked No. 4 in the world, advanced to the final by holding off the challenge of No. 139 Patrick Rafter of Australia, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, in yesterday's first semifinal at the Indianapolis Tennis Center.
Courier, who will reclaim his designation as the world's top men's player when the new rankings are released tomorrow, defeated Luiz Mattar of Brazil, 6-3, 6-2, in the other semifinal. (AP)


Jazzy Love Songs Tinged With an Oceanic Feeling
Bjork exploded into public consciousness with her starburst vocals on "Birthday," the 1987 debut single by the Sugarcubes.
Bjork's ethereal voice and elf-girl image had critics and fans bewitched.
Rave reviews predicted imminent world conquest for the Icelandic band.
But it didn't happen, and the Sugarcubes never quite scaled the heights of their debut again.
Over three albums, the group veered from moderately captivating dream pop to quirky, negligible new wave and gradually whittled down its cult following rather than expanding it.
Now Bjork (who doesn't use her last name, Gutmundsdottir) has gone solo, as some devotees always felt she should.
In recent interviews, the 27-year-old singer has professed that she never much cared for the alternative-rock qualities of the Sugarcubes' music.
With "Debut" (Elektra, 9 61468-2; CD and cassette), she set out to combine her love of jazz with her ardor for rave music.
To this end, she hooked up with Nellee Hooper of Soul II Soul, who produced most of the album and co-wrote five of the 11 songs.
Mr.
Hooper's rhythmic expertise provides the kind of groovy settings Bjork's voice has always deserved.
The collaboration has proved effective; the album is rapidly climbing Billboard's pop chart.

August 15-21; For Gold or Politics: Miners Slaughter Indians In Brazil, and Guerrillas Attack Them in Peru
Thatched huts aflame and Indians falling to the sword: these brutal scenes from Europe's 16th-century conquest of South America returned last week to haunt Brazil and Peru.
In Peru, 200 Shining Path guerrillas rampaged through seven Ashaninka villages Thursday morning, killing 63 villagers and wounding 34 more.
The Maoist guerrillas have long fought to control Peru's forest people, trying to force them to abandon their language, customs and political autonomy.

August 15-21; Notes From Underground: Surviving a 12-Day Ordeal, Executive Puffs With Pride
It started off as just another Wednesday for Harvey Weinstein, a 68-year-old formal-wear manufacturer.
But as he left a Queens diner after breakfast on Aug. 4, two men pushed their way into his car, put a hood on his head and manacles on his legs, and drove off.
They forced him into a barrel-sized crypt beside the Henry Hudson Parkway in Manhattan.
Then they demanded ransom.
They got $3 million last week, but only briefly.
After hauling two duffel bags stuffed with bills from a park in upper Manhattan, two suspects, one of whom was an employee, were arrested and a third was arrested later.
One kidnapper expressed relief that Mr.
Weinstein had survived, and said that he was a nice man.


A Multitude of Sins and Egocentric Traits
To the Editor:
Richard Howard's poem about avarice (July 11) focused on Balzac as the creator of "such unflagging monsters of avarice as / a Grandet, a Gobseck, a Goriot!" Grandet and Gobseck fit this description admirably.
Pere Goriot does not.
Far from being an avaricious monster, he was a martyr to the greed of his daughters.

'I Remember Washington': Memoir Track Records in the 1990's
Publishers, like generals, use the lessons of the last war to fight the next one.
And the lesson of the last few book wars was that the memoirs of an articulate, popular and telegenic military hero are a tactical weapon worth a high price.
So, after H. Norman Schwarzkopf rocketed himself and publisher Bantam Books to 25 weeks of bestsellerdom with "It Doesn't Take A Hero," another Gulf War commander, Colin L. Powell, last week gave Random House world rights to his autobiography for a reported $6.5 million.

Making a Driveway Last Years Longer
AN asphalt driveway will last 20 years or more with minimal care and remain reasonably attractive for the duration.
Without attention, signs of aging can appear in as few as five years, and minor damage can quickly become a major problem.
Minimal care consists primarily of repairing cracks as they develop.
Also, the driveway should be coated with sealer every three to five years; this helps to protect it from sunlight and chemicals like road salt and bolsters water-resistance.

Your Mother!
ON Tuesday night, Vibe, the new magazine devoted to urban music and youth culture, had its debut party at Webster Hall in the East Village.
Inside the nightclub, b-boys with business cards, dance-hall ragamuffins with big hats, "gangsta" rappers with date books, street-smart producers and stylemongers in motorcycle chains stuffed themselves into the V.I.P. lounge.
Standing among them, Jonathan Van Meter, the monthly magazine's 30-year-old editor in chief who was wearing a chic black suit, brushed his long blond hair out of his big blue eyes.
He directed his mother, Judy, to sit down on the photo-opportunity couch with Quincy Jones, the musician and entrepreneur, who collaborated with Time Inc.
Ventures in creating Vibe.

Church Fights Drugs and Bureaucracy
The egg spattered a few feet from his black shoes, and the Rev.
John J. Jenik jerked his head up to scan the building behind him.
He knew he was not popular: for a month now, he and his congregation in the Bronx had led a boycott against the bodega on the building's ground floor, since a raid in July when the police seized over $1,000 worth of cocaine and a pistol.
"Thank God it was an egg and not a brick," Father Jenik said recently, in front of Jorge's Supermarket at 2839 Decatur Avenue in the Fordham-Bedford section.
"The atmosphere is really hostile."


Kitchen Sink Gives A Party
The benefit committee for last night's joint fund-raiser for Naked Angels, the well-connected theater company on West 17th Street, and the Creative Coalition, the political action group, was nothing if not inclusive.
William Baldwin, the actor (right), and Michael Berman, a public relations executive, were the chairmen of the party, at the East Hampton (L.I.) Airport, Hangar 1.
But who were the 143 others listed on the invitation?
There were more than two dozens actors, including Stockard Channing, Mercedes Ruehl and the newly wed Alec Baldwin.

City Cancels Another Lockheed Contract
The city's Transportation Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio, said last night that he had decided to rescind a $2.4 million contract with Lockheed Information Management Services to enter parking-ticket information into the city's computers.
The company figured prominently in a report released last week by city investigators, who found that several senior members of the Dinkins administration had given special treatment to Lockheed when it sought a $150 million contract to take over most of the Parking Violations Bureau's operations.


CONNECTICUT GUIDE

The New Haven Symphony Orchestra opens its 100th season today with a gift to the city of music and entertainment performed on the green.
A concert at 7:30 featuring an all-American program conducted by Peter Sacco will contain music by Aaron Copland, Ferde Grofe, Leonard Bernstein, Duke Ellington and George Gershwin.
In addition, Bess Daniels will narrate a specially commissioned symphonic fairy tale for children called "Drakestail," by Mario Lombardo.
The finale will be a medley of familiar tunes for the audience to sing-along.


U.S. Men Equal World Record in 400-Meter Relay
The six finals in the world's outdoor track and field championships today produced all kinds of performances -- good, bad and indifferent.
But the preliminaries produced something completely different as the United States men's 400-meter relay team, minus Carl Lewis, equaled the world record of 37.40 seconds.
The American team in that semifinal race consisted of, in order, Jon Drummond, Andre Cason, Dennis Mitchell and Leroy Burrell.
Lewis, who has anchored American or Santa Monica Track Club teams to five world records in nine years in this race, said before the meet that he was having a difficult year and would not run the relay here.


Profile: Herbert M. Baum; Quaker State's Quick-Change Artist
HERBERT M. BAUM, the new head of the Quaker State Corporation, and the first outsider to lead the oil company since it was founded in 1931, refused when the board asked him to add his picture to a row of portraits of past chairmen.
"This is stifling," he said, gesturing toward the display lining a hall on the top floor of the company's headquarters here.
So he ordered that the pictures of the solemn-faced executives be moved into the boardroom and replaced with lively photos of the company's products, employees and customers.

Interface: People and Technology; Pain? Picture, If You Can, a Digital Swan . . .
IT has been nearly two years since Jacqueline K. Korbar, a school bus driver in Vestal, N.Y., severely injured her back when she fell while getting out of the bus.
Persistent pain has kept her from working since then.
But, thanks in part to a new type of computerized biofeedback system, Ms.
Korbar hopes to be back in the driver's seat when school opens next month.
The system, called Mindscope, uses video scenes like sunsets or swimming swans, to help patients learn to associate the images with a state of physical relaxation that reduces pain naturally.
With sufficient practice, patients wean themselves from Mind scope, learning to form the images and relax on their own, says the neurologist who developed Mindscope, Barry B. Bittman, of Meadville, Pa.


Designing the Future at SUNY Purchase
THE fragrant aroma in Bill Lacy's office could be traced to a bowl of oranges, a distinctly personal touch for the new president of the State University's college here.
Although boxes of books remained unshelved in the spacious room recently vacated by his predecessor, Dr.
Sheldon N. Grebstein, Mr.
Lacy had unpacked the reassuring objects he called his toys: a kinetic sculpture made by a student at Cooper Union, where Mr.
Lacy served as president from 1980 to 1988; a wooden head sculptured by his great-aunt and a wooden leg splint fashioned during World War II by his mentor and friend, the architect and furniture designer Charles Eames, who also gave Mr.
Lacy one of his famous chairs.


Wealth Not Always Fatal Handicap in New Jersey Politics
From the earthy, pipe-smoking Congresswoman Millicent H. Fenwick to former Gov.
Thomas H. Kean, who traced his family wealth and political lineage to Colonial times, politics has long been a popular calling for some of New Jersey's wealthiest citizens.
And while their opponents occasionally took aim at their wealth or patrician backgrounds, the attacks seldom caused any lasting damage.


Building Slump Is Seen as Brake On a Recovery
Construction, normally an important engine in America's economic recoveries and a big creator of jobs, is continuing its slump and acting as a drag on the rebound, economists say.
In every other business cycle over the last 20 years, real estate construction -- especially commercial construction -- has helped lead the economy into recovery.
But this time, the overbuilding of the 1980's and the subsequent crash in values have slammed the commercial real estate industry into its worst depression since the 1930's, sending total construction to its lowest level in years.
And most real estate analysts see no immediate change ahead.


Tourism in Egypt
To the Editor: In June, my husband and I experienced firsthand the effectiveness of the fundamentalists' attempt to damage tourism in Egypt.
We had sailed from Athens aboard the Stella Solaris and were on our way to Port Said and Alexandria for a long-awaited trip to the Sphinx and the Pyramids.
On the morning of our scheduled arrival, we looked out the porthole and were surprised to see a rugged terrain not usually associated with the Egyptian landscape.
We were right.
It was Turkey.


Red Tape Cut for Bronx Man Rebuilding Store After Blaze
Lazar Berkovits has reached the end of the line, and for once, he's happy.
In recent months, his efforts at rebuilding a store after a fire last year were stalled by a dotted line on an old city map indicating that East Tremont Avenue ran through his property.
Even though the road does not really overlap the site, he could not start construction without city permission, a step that would cost him $8,000 in legal fees and valuable lost months in construction.

G.M. Tests a New Marketing Tactic: Head-On Collisions
THE General Motors Corporation, which was once the envy of the industrial world, is now trying to prove that it isn't the patsy of the automotive industry anymore.
In Europe, the company is waging a legal and public relations assault on a former executive it accuses of passing secrets to Volkswagen A.G.
Back home, its aggressive reaction to a report that one of its pickup trucks was prone to burst into flames helped lead to the resignation of a network news chief.

The Devil in Long Island
"He wondered every once in a while what life would be like without a second story and how it was people managed to get along in ranch-style or split-level houses without running amok once a year or so." Thomas Pynchon, from "Low-lands"
It would be foolish to believe that a single story could sum up the entire range of bizarre and sensational behavior that is Long Island Babylon.
Particularly a story that doesn't even mention Amy or Sol, Joey or "Joel the Ripper," little Katie Beers or Howard Stern, much less the "Homeroom Hit Man," the "Angel of Death" nurse, the Islip Garbage Barge or Geraldo Rivera.


On Sunday; A Fatal Silence And a Chance To Address It
IN the weeks since Vincent Foster took his own life in Washington and set off rounds of necroscopic punditry and power-lunch sleuthing in that most self-centered of cities, 21 New Yorkers have taken the same way out in Manhattan alone.
They were barely noted in departing and occasioned far less posthumous wonder than President Clinton's late counselor.
Eleven Manhattanites jumped to their death, three hanged themselves, three more donned plastic bags to achieve asphyxia, three shot themselves in the head and one slashed his wrists.
The 12 men and nine women ranged in age from 17 years to 80 when they died, a gamut reflected similarly in the other boroughs and steadily out across the nation, where most of the living would rather not think about this.

A Multitude of Sins and Egocentric Traits
To the Editor:
John Updike still doesn't get it.
Men are not the sole possessors or arbiters of lust.
It's in our drinking water.
Surely he remembers Jennifer Jones in "Duel in the Sun," or Emma Bovary.
With all the lusty women in literature and history, all the women who have been blessed by it, insulted by it, physically harmed and maimed by it, how come this, again, comes to a male forum?

As he overthrew another general, he said soldiers had no business dictating to elected civilians how to run their governments.
He talked of the need to end authoritarian behavior, of the need for a free press and for guarantees of free expression.
In so doing, he raised hopes that Nigeria was at last about to become a genuine democracy and, as black Africa's richest and most populous nation, a powerful beacon for the rest of the continent.
This Friday is the deadline General Babangida originally set for the transfer of power to elected civilians.
But the promise that deadline once held seems empty after a numbing year of disappointments.


Alexandra Whyte, Bradley Sperber
Alexandra Woodside Whyte, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
William H. Whyte of New York, was married yesterday to Bradley Robert Sperber, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Raymond Sperber of Denver and Los Angeles.
The Rev.
Libby Smith, a Unitarian Universalist minister, performed the ceremony at the First Church Congregational in Cambridge, Mass.
Ms.
Whyte, who is 28, is keeping her name.
She is a production supervisor at the Investext Group, which produces financial-industry publications and data bases in Boston.
She graduated from Barnard College and received a master's degree in theological studies from Harvard University.


What They're Wearing
What they're wearing is next to nothing.
Filmy fashions and lacy looks have been stepping out and will move into winter, as these women make abundantly clear.


Glimpses of Long-Ago Tokyo
THE visitor to Tokyo who is curious about what the city was like before skyscrapers, traffic jams and McDonald's faces a daunting task.
Twice in this century the city has been virtually leveled: once by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and then by American bombers in World War II.
Although little of early Tokyo survives, a handful of small, jewel-like museums have recaptured portions of the old city.
Collectively they evoke the look and feel of pre-modern Tokyo.
At two museums visitors can even wander through exquisitely detailed, full-scale recreations of long-gone urban settings.
These reconstructions have proved so popular that the Edo-Tokyo Museum was opened in March to accommodate more of them.
Tokyo, originally called Edo, has been Japan's de facto capital since 1603.
In that year Tokugawa Ieyasu, the nation's paramount warlord, assumed the title of shogun and made Edo his seat of government.


Dissenting Opinions On 'Merry Wives'
If "Merry Wives of Windsor," as played at Boscobel in Garrison this month, were even a little less than the delightful production it is, we should say that Alvin Klein had done it a serious injustice in his review of July 18  [ " 'Merry Wives' Outdoors at Boscobel" ] .
Instead, we consider the review a comic injustice, to be taken as lightly as the wrath of Dr.
Caius (in his strutting green suit), the jealousy of Mr.
Ford, and the pathetic lechery of Sir John Falstaff.
If "interpretation, characterization, charm and, most of all, intelligibility and high spirits" are the criteria by which Mr.
Klein judges a performance of "Merry Wives," why, then, the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival cast has triumphed this season -- at least according to the many theatergoers who listened, laughed, and clapped throughout the evening, and pitied Sir John at his final humiliation.


For Papa Chabrol, It's All in the Family
Visiting Claude Chabrol on the set of his latest film was a bit like intruding on a family vacation.
His stepdaughter, Cecile Maistre, was scurrying around as assistant director.
His third wife, Aurore, was in charge of the script.
And his son Thomas was playing a waiter in the movie, "L'Enfer," or "Hell." Warm weather, scanty clothes and a bucolic lakeside setting here in southwest France added to the relaxed mood.
And, of course, there was Mr.
Chabrol himself, jovial as ever, puffing away at his pipe, presiding over the scene like a benevolent squire.
Not that he makes relaxed films.
His 45th, "Betty," which opened in New York on Friday, is the tale of a wife and mother, played by Marie Trintignant, who tumbles into alcoholism and disgrace after being chased from her home in Paris for infidelity.
His 46th movie, which has yet to be released in the United States, was about the Vichy regime's collaboration with Nazi Germany.
The film he is now shooting is also no sidesplitter.
In "L'Enfer," Emmanuelle Beart, seen most recently in Claude Sautet's "Coeur en Hiver," plays Nelly, a beautiful young woman whose husband is driven to distraction by jealousy.

Phillips Takes the Broncos for a Spin
Without Dan Reeves, the Denver Broncos have the house all to themselves.
Reeves, who is now shaping up the Giants, was an unbending vice principal here for 12 seasons.
But he has been replaced by a coach who needed four attempts to tie his necktie Friday night.
That new coach, Wade Phillips, is the only son of Bum Phillips, and he comes with most of the trappings.
His accent is Texan; he wears either snakeskin boots or sneakers and N.F.L.
Films should mike him on the sidelines.


Louisa Smith, Colin J. Ives
Louisa Morris Smith, a daughter of Mary V. T. Cattan of Stamford, Conn., and F. Clawson Smith of Greenwich, Conn., was married yesterday to Colin James Ives, a son of Philip and Joan Ives of New Canaan, Conn.
The Rev.
Terrence Elsberry officiated at Christ Episcopal Church in Greenwich.
The Rev.
Andrea Smith, the bride's aunt, took part in the ceremony.
Mrs.
Ives, 26, graduated cum laude from St.
Lawrence University and is studying for an M.B.A. at Harvard University.
Her father is a partner in the New York executive-recruiting firm of Johnson Smith &amp; Knisely.
Her mother is the director of spiritual life at Christ Episcopal Church.


Remote Hudson By Wooden Boat
The upper reaches of the Hudson River ring with the screams of day-tripping rafters during spring runoff, but now there's a more subtle way to float this remote Adirondack waterway.
Michael Wilson, who is probably the first guide to run wooden boats through the Hudson River gorge in six decades, is offering two overnight trips in his gleaming dories this fall.
The wooden boats, sturdy McKenzie River dories, seat two passengers and are designed to be easily maneuvered in fast-moving water.
Rowed by an Adirondack guide, they offer the chance to get through the roughest rapids with hardly a splash, and in the rarely traveled calm stretches above the gorge they serve as an elegant platform for peeping at leaves no other travelers are likely to see. (Participants will also view the most jarring addition to the otherwise wild river, an ugly paper company bridge granted a controversial permit by the Department of Environmental Conservation two years ago.)


A Multitude of Sins and Egocentric Traits
To the Editor:
What does Joyce Carol Oates mean, in her essay on despair (July 25), by "the Catholic Church, as the self-appointed voice of God on earth"?
Did not Jesus say to Peter and the apostles, "Whatever you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden"?  (Rev.) VINCENT A. BROWN  Rego Park, Queens


Putting Youths to Work, and Saving Too
THE blare of rock music from a boombox offered a driving background beat that accompanied the steady rhythm of the workers painting the Pleasantville Middle School cafeteria.
While some of the painters carefully taped the edges of the walls to separate the two-tone color scheme, others brandished paint rollers with expertise.
These scenes of routine refurbishings are unremarkable summer sights in the buildings and on the grounds of the county's schools, as maintenance staffs take advantage of students' absence to repair the wear and tear of the academic year.
What makes Pleasantville's ordinary landscape chores and classroom remodelings different is that many of the tasks are performed by recent high school graduates, as well as by some current students, in a distinctive program that combines cost-cutting measures with a summer employment plan for teen-agers.


What Are The Rules, Anyway?
In the mixed up world of fashion today, what are the rules, anyway?
Be comfortable.
Be Clean.
Dress to suit yourself.
Dare to experiment.
But, if almost anything goes, what doesn't?
Untidiness: Dowdy is fine.
Frowzy can be fun.
But unkempt is not only ugly, it's also unhealthy.
Going overboard: It's great to be first -- but not if you look ridiculous.
Too much of anything: One rose to many is always one rose to many.

Olympic Lessons
To the Sports Editor:
In "China Needs 4 More years to Be Host," (The Times, July 28), George Vecsey seems somewhat amiss when he emphasizes the lingering backlash of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 and the criticism by Olympic officials citing Beijing on its stadium sites and its pollution.


Asbestos Checks Proceed But Pace Continues to Lag
With 18 days until classes begin for New York City's one million schoolchildren, inspectors continued yesterday to search public schools for asbestos as officials again reassured parents that the job would be completed by the first day of school, Sept. 9.
But their prospects continued to appear dim, with more than two-thirds of the city's 1,069 schools awaiting inspection and officials still scrambling to assemble at least 75 inspectors by Monday.
One official called Monday the "zero hour" and said he thought officials would realize then they would not be able to finish.


Painful Choices for Bosnia's Muslims, Painful Politics for the West
A draft peace accord presented by international mediators here on Friday has given Bosnia and Herzegovina's Muslims just over a week to choose between accepting defeat disguised as compromise and pursuing a war they cannot win.
But the plan also poses a tricky problem for Western Governments.
They too must decide whether to endorse a peace that recognizes the annexation of territory by force and rewards "ethnic cleansing," or to become more deeply involved in a war they are eager to see brought to an end.


Style War: English vs. Murkin
Whose English language is it, anyway?
From the tone of the new "BBC News and Current Affairs Stylebook and Editorial Guide," you'd think the Brits invented it.
With unmistakable disdain, the broadcastocrats in London call what we speak "American." As a user of Murkin English, I rise to the defense.
"English is a language that is constantly evolving," writes Tony Hall, the British Broadcasting Corporation's managing director of current affairs, "and we must recognise when change has taken place. That is a task that requires judgement. Hence this style book."


Mutual Funds; 60 or Older? Aim to Preserve Wealth
AFTER investing for growth in their 20's and 30's, then building wealth in their middle years, 60's-plus investors -- on the verge of retiring or already there -- should structure their fund holdings to provide cash flow and preserve wealth.
"People need to understand that at 70 they still have a substantial life expectancy," said Harold R. Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla.
So they need income to cover expenses and protection from inflation.
Equity could provide that protection, but stocks are more volatile than bonds.
Thus retirees must balance three conflicting goals: income, growth and low volatility.

Jill Grossman, Steven Walder
Jill Grossman, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Kenneth Grossman of Great Neck, L.I., was married last evening to Steven Gary Walder, a son of Justin P. Walder of Short Hills, N.J., and Ellen Walder of North Miami, Fla.
Rabbi Barry Greene officiated at the St.
Regis in New York.
Mrs.
Walder, 25, graduated from Boston University and received a master's degree in art history from New York University.
She is the production coordinator for the Brownstone Studio, a women's clothing catalogue in New York.
Her father is the chief executive of the company, and her mother, Joan Grossman, is the director of product development.


Officials Testify on Crown Heights Response
Under sharp questioning by lawyers for Hasidic Jews, two former Dinkins administration officials have maintained that they were told later than the Hasidim contend they were that the police were responding inadequately to attacks on Hasidim in the 1991 racial violence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
In depositions taken in a lawsuit filed by the Hasidim against the city, the former officials continued to insist that there was no decision by Mayor David N. Dinkins to restrain the police in their response to the four-day outbreak of violence.

The restaurant's two numbers are 413-4314 and 413-4098.


Canada Chief In Fast Start On Campaign
Trying to distance herself from her unpopular predecessor, Kim Campbell, Prime Minister of Canada for the last two months, is presenting herself as a populist who rides subways, worries about her mortgage and the price of milk and wants to change politics here.
Comparing Ottawa, the capital, to the Land of Oz, she has been telling Canadians in gatherings from coast to coast that if she wins an election this fall, she will review pensions of federal politicians, require more disclosure by lobbyists, do away with budget secrecy and reform the process of political appointments.
She has already trimmed the Cabinet and laid off some civil servants.


Mugabe Finds Useful Target in White Farmlands
President Robert Mugabe has a familiar dilemma for an African leader.
The misery index is up.
The Government's popularity is down.
He can't reverse course because he just did that two years ago, renouncing Communism in favor of a World Bank austerity program.
He can't blame the opposition, because he runs a virtual one-party state.
And so, many Zimbabweans say, Mr.
Mugabe has settled on a familiar solution: Take on the whites.


For Some Groups, Early Fall Season
EVERYBODY knows that the fall arts season doesn't begin until September -- even October, for many organizations -- but don't tell that to the Emelin Theater in Mamaroneck, the Paramount Center for the Arts in Peekskill or the Performing Arts Center at the State University at Purchase.
Emelin activities are already under way, with Vicki Stuart starring in a new musical, "Smiling Through" (remaining performances are Wednesday through Saturday evenings at 8 o'clock and next Sunday at 7).
The Paramount begins what the executive director, Numa Saisselin, proclaims "a simply sensational season" with the appearance of the singing star Lou Rawls on Friday at 8 P.M.
Friday.
And at SUNY, the Phoenix Theater Company is rounding out its sixth season with Ellen Burstyn featured in Horton Foote's "The Trip to Bountiful," with the curtain at 8 P.M. on Tuesday through Saturday, matinees on Wednesday and Saturday at 2 P.M. and a final show next Sunday at 5 P.M.


Deborah Harry Is Low-Key -- And Unblond
When Deborah Harry performed last Labor Day at Wigstock, the annual all-day drag party in Tompkins Square Park, the audience's response was lukewarm.
"That was the real Deborah Harry," Lady Bunny, the event's organizer, pointedly told the crowd afterward.
Ms.
Harry, the former lead singer of Blondie, doesn't pretend that she has repeated the success she had in the late 70's and early 80's with songs like "The Tide is High" and "Heart of Glass."


WHAT IS IT ABOUT AUGUST?
As a quarter-century resident of Dallas (with its interminable, brain-frying, world-class Augusts), I thoroughly enjoyed Bruce Handy's "What Is It About August?" (Aug. 1).
He did, however, skimp a bit on the literary treatment of the curse of August by failing to mention Ford Madox Ford's "Good Soldier," in which all the significant events -- meetings, marriage, madness, birthdays, betrayal, suicide -- occur on the fourth day of August.
Aug. 4 was, of course, the date in 1914 when the British Parliament declared war.

The Rev.
Joseph P. Trombley performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at St.
Agnes Church in Lake Placid.
Mrs.
Cutone, 25, is a law student at Northeastern University.
A former national collegiate figure skating champion and a national skating and World University Games competitor, she is on the board of directors of the United States Figure Skating Association in Colorado Springs, for which she serves as a judge.
She graduated cum laude from Harvard University.
Her father, a former partner in the law firm of Hooley, Butler, Defrancesco &amp; Kelly in Westfield, N.J., is an estate planner in Westfield.


Ruling Due on Huskies
It's judgment day for the Washington Huskies over allegations of dozens of National Collegiate Athletic Association rule violations that could cost them a chance at their fourth straight Rose Bowl.
In addition, the recommended recruiting limitations "are far more severe than anyone had anticipated; that's really what's going to hurt the program," an unidentified source told The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash.
The Pacific-10 Conference will announce the penalties today after reviewing charges ranging from improper loans to players to booster-provided jobs that allegedly didn't require the players to work hard.
The 30-member Pac-10 Council -- three members from each of the conference's 10 schools -- was scheduled to meet yesterday to consider undisclosed penalties recommended by the league's enforcement committee.


Memories of 'Mignon' From Long Ago
In "What to Perform at an Outdoor Concert" (July 18), Frederica von Stade remarks on the "disappearance" of the opera "Mignon" from the standard operatic repertory.
Indeed, I recall a Saturday matinee performance, on radio and from the Metropolitan, in the 30's (1936 or 1937, I believe).
And nothing since!
That long-ago performance included Tito Schipa, Lucrezia Bori and Lily Pons.


Read Both the Cards And the Opponents
SOME suit combinations look simple, but can become highly interesting in certain circumstances.
Study the diamonds in the North-South hands in the diagram, and assume that the contract is three no-trump.
Assume also that dummy has no entry in the other suits, and that the success of the contract rests on whether or not the declarer can run the diamonds.
South, let us say, has plenty of entries.
The routine play is to lead the ten and to finesse, playing low from the dummy.
If the king appears from either opponent, the problem is solved.
But if the ten wins and he plays his small card, what should he do when West follows suit?
Did West begin with three cards including the king?
Or has East held up the king?


Changes at a Sculpture Park
AT Grounds for Sculpture here, the roses continue abundant and Joel Shapiro's man made of bronze beams is still fleeing across the grass as if to escape them.
But as might be expected in a sculpture park, started from scratch four years ago, plenty has changed.
Trees have been added, the birds have multiplied, a platoon of rabbits has taken up residence and there are elegant wood benches from which the scene can be observed in comfort.
One of these is labeled for Bruce Carey, the architect who landscaped the 16-acre plot, seemingly under the influence of the Mound Builders.


A Bowling Alley Strikes Back After Hurricane Andrew
Next door to Paula Carter's Pro Bowl, a health-care center is operating out of a trailer, its former building an empty shell.
Across the street, a onetime fast-food restaurant stands like some remnant of a ghost town.
Almost everywhere one turns in a ride along U.S. 1, there are other stark examples of the devastation still evident from Hurricane Andrew, the monster that leveled this heavily agricultural community of 31,000 last Aug. 24.


Walking in Fields Where Sculpture Holds Sway
WITH his spectacles, wristwatch and ruddy complexion, Elizabeth Hill's "Scribe" seems more American than Asian.
Yet he sits on his green and white cushion with a border of blue lotuses, radiating a serenity that is both un-Western and slightly humorous.
The 27-inch figure is set on a pedestal at eye level under a maple tree and, were it not for the bronze medium and the skillful modeling, it could be folk art in some Indian village shrine.
In fact, "Scribe" reposes in the Ridgefield shrine known as the Kouros Sculpture Center, where it rates as one of the more memorable pieces.
It is also symptomatic of a trend toward smaller works, although that is not immediately apparent.


Christine Loo and Martin Flaherty
Christine Kelly Loo, a lawyer, was married yesterday to Martin Stephen Flaherty, an associate professor of law at Fordham University.
The couple work in New York.
The Rev.
Gerard Lair officiated the Roman Catholic ceremony at the Chapel on the campus of Princeton University in Princeton, N.J.
Mrs.
Loo Flaherty, 28, graduated from Cornell University and received a law degree from Fordham.
She was until recently an associate in the New York office of Phillips, Lytle, Hitchcock, Blaine &amp; Huber, a Buffalo law firm.
She is the daughter of Jack and Charlene Loo of New York.
Her father is the vice president of the Ever Ready Blue Print Corporation in New York.
Her mother is the company's president.


A Multitude of Sins and Egocentric Traits

Erica A. Keen, Gregory C. Thomas
Erica Ann Keen, a foreign affairs officer in the Office of Ocean Affairs of the State Department, was married yesterday to Gregory Chapman Thomas, a teacher of English as a second language at Cardozo Senior High School.
Both work in Washington.
The Rev.
Harry Quiett officiated at the All Souls Unitarian Church there.


Whisky Mac
To the Editor: Sherry Friedman's mention of a Whisky Macdonald in "The Surprising Fruit and Flower Wines of Scotland" (July 25), brought back memories of my introduction to that most effective warmer-upper.
During a hike on the rain cloud-darkened Yorkshire moors one blustery afternoon, we stopped at a pub for a restorative drink.
The hospitable publican insisted we have Whisky Macs, as they are called in West Riding.
The ginger wine and whiskey combine to create a superb hot toddy.
After two of these even our fingernails were perspiring.


Gail Aidinoff, Edward Scovell
Gail Margaret Aidinoff, the daughter of M. Bernard Aidinoff of New York and the late Celia S. Aidinoff, was married yesterday to Edward Philip Scovell, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Melvin E. Scovell of Waltham, Mass.
Judge Michael Mukasey, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, officiated at Wave Hill in New York.
Mrs.
Scovell is an associate in the New York law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton.
She graduated from Harvard University, from which she also received a law degree.
Her father is a senior partner in the New York law firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.


So Many Criminals Trip Themselves Up
In North Carolina and New York, two high-visibility crimes provided a chilling demonstration last week of how vicious the nation's outlaws can be -- and also how foolish.
In one case, the father of basketball star Michael Jordan was shot dead.
He was picked at random, the police said, by two armed 18-year-olds who were simply looking for someone to rob and found him taking a nap on the edge of a highway in his expensive car.
The other case ended triumphantly as detectives pulled Harvey Weinstein, the scrappy 68-year-old owner of a Queens tuxedo factory, from the muddy crypt where he had been buried alive for 12 days by kidnappers.


Managua Fails To Make Gains In Hostage Talks
Government officials and Sandinista leaders met today to try to resolve a standoff in which two separate groups of armed men who are holding the country's Vice President and nearly 80 other officials hostage.
One of the groups stormed into a meeting of conservative politicians in Managua on Friday night and took Vice President Virgilio Godoy Reyes, five legislators and 27 other people hostage.

Julie Harris Takes East Hampton Stage
IN "The Fiery Furnace" at the John Drew Theater in East Hampton, the playwright Timothy Mason is trying to ignite a once-popular genre known as kitchen-sink drama.
A deceptively dawdling first act hardly prepares one for the incendiary intentions of the second, with its eruptive domestic violence and muddled details.
And beware of rampant symbols.
Mr.
Mason shades a story of personal unfulfillment on a broader canvas of spiritual crisis and sexual oppression.
But "The Fiery Furnace" remains a small play trying for size.


30 Years of 'Pink Panther': A Primer
Released almost 30 years ago, the first Pink Panther movie spawned an industry -- sequels (with and without Peter Sellers, who remains indelibly identified with the role of the bumbling Inspector Clouseau), tie-in products, and more than 200 cartoon shorts.
And more is coming.
A new movie, "Son of the Pink Panther," directed by the Panther veteran Blake Edwards and starring the Italian Roberto Benigni as Clouseau's illegitimate son, opens on Friday.
An animated television series, "The Pink Panther," has its premiere on Sept. 13.
Herewith, then, a Panther primer.
*
Peter Ustinov was originally cast as the clumsy Clouseau but backed out and Sellers came aboard.
Voila!


Big Little Movies Stand Up To Summer's Blockbusters
For certain movie studio executives, the lazy, hazy days of summer have been anything but, as they've labored to keep their art-house hits in the public eye.
This summer, three such films have ridden the enthusiasm of critics and public to sustained box-office success against the onslaught of big-budget Hollywood action movies.
The Mexican black comedy "Like Water for Chocolate" has surpassed $13 million, "Much Ado About Nothing" has taken in $15.6 million, and "Orlando" $2.3 million.
Grosses like these are no small feat when considering that these movies have had to rely primarily on word-of-mouth rather than intensive advertising to attract filmgoers.


As to Those Medical Files . . .
To the Editor:
Regarding "This Is Your Life, Mr. Smith . . ." (Aug. 1) describing the Medical Information Bureau:


United Fights for Its Health as Unions Fight for United
LEAN and fit, Stephen M. Wolf, the 52-year-old chairman of United Airlines, works out every chance he gets in the personal gym adjoining his office here.
And he's attacking the problem of getting the carrier into fighting trim with an equal zeal.
United became the nation's largest airline in June, edging out American by the crucial measure of miles flown by passengers.
But far from celebrating, Mr.
Wolf is looking critically at what industry analysts agree is an unhealthy amount of fat.
Indeed, United's parent, UAL Corporation, posted an operating loss of $538 million last year, far more than AMR, American's parent, which posted a $25 million operating loss.


Making a Driveway Last Years Longer
AN asphalt driveway will last 20 years or more with minimal care and remain reasonably attractive for the duration.
Without attention, signs of aging can appear in as few as five years, and minor damage can quickly become a major problem.
Minimal care consists primarily of repairing cracks as they develop.
Also, the driveway should be coated with sealer every three to five years; this helps to protect it from sunlight and chemicals like road salt and bolsters water-resistance.


'I Remember Washington': Memoir Track Records in the 1990's
Publishers, like generals, use the lessons of the last war to fight the next one.
And the lesson of the last few book wars was that the memoirs of an articulate, popular and telegenic military hero are a tactical weapon worth a high price.
So, after H. Norman Schwarzkopf rocketed himself and publisher Bantam Books to 25 weeks of bestsellerdom with "It Doesn't Take A Hero," another Gulf War commander, Colin L. Powell, last week gave Random House world rights to his autobiography for a reported $6.5 million.


Elizabeth Miller, Douglas Pierpont
Elizabeth Gregory Miller, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas W. C. Miller of New York, was married yesterday to Douglas Carlson Pierpont, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
William S. Pierpont of Waterbury, Conn.
The Rev.
John Macort performed the Episcopal ceremony at the Watch Hill (R.I.) Chapel.
Mrs.
Pierpont, a graduate of Connecticut College, is a portfolio manager at Community Assets Management in Denver.
Her father is the senior vice president and an owner of Goodrich &amp; Sherwood, a management consulting firm in New York.
The bride is a great-granddaughter of the late George M. Laughlin 3d, a founder of the Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation in Pittsburgh.


POSTINGS: China Trust Building; East Meets West in Flushing
Except for the Chinese signs in its windows -- and its being in the heart of Flushing's Chinese district -- China Trust Plaza, the China Trust Bank's new three-story, 44,000-square-foot building at 41-99 Main Street, could easily be taken for the offices of any American company.
Its entrance atrium and its white enameled aluminum facade seem to have no suggestions of specifically Asian culture.
But anyone with knowledge of Taiwanese traditions would spot some telling differences.
For one thing, there's the fountain in the entrance vestibule.
Since the building's entrance spans a corner, people enter it on a diagonal -- a configuration that never bodes well, according to Feng Shui, a Chinese belief that the juxtaposition of buildings and nature has an impact on business success.
Flowing water is a sure antidote to negative Feng Shui.


From Russia to the World: The Complete Cosmopolite
In 1924, Nathan Milstein and Vladimir Horowitz, then "Children of the Soviet Revolution," accepted special passports to perform abroad "for the purpose of artistic refinement and cultural propaganda." They fully expected to return to Russia -- until evidence of the Stalinist nightmare reached them.
And so Milstein and Horowitz eventually wound up New Yorkers.
This transplantation tellingly altered the career paths of both artists.
Horowitz found himself acclaimed the world's greatest pianist -- and subject to pressures that excitingly exacerbated his already high-strung artistic personality.
For Milstein, whose musical temperament was as equable as Horowitz's was nervous, geographical displacement reinforced an innate patrician detachment.


'Pack Burros'
To the Editor: Being a casual bicycle tourist myself, I was excited to read Dianna Waggoner's "Cycling Down California's North Coast" (July 25).
That is, until I found that I was one of those "other riders," something Ms.
Waggoner describes ungenerously as a "pack burro." Yes, one of those unfortunate few, cursed to struggle and wobble with 25 to 40 pounds of "stuff" while the Ms.
Waggoners of this world are free to ride like birds, carrying only windbreakers and credit cards.
I read Ms.
Waggoner's article upon returning from my most recent tour: through the Catskills to Ithaca, N.Y.
Packed neatly in my saddlebags and on my rack, I carried about 35 pounds of "stuff," including food, a tent, a stove and fuel, and averaged 70 miles a day. .

The Executive Computer; From Ambra and Dell, a New Burst of Nerd Appeal
CALL it the revenge of the techno-nerds.
After spending the past two years in a nearly obsessive quest to make low-cost and easy-to-use personal computer systems for the mass market, several computer companies are once again trying to win the affection of advanced computer users.
The Ambra Computer Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the IBM PC Company, and the Dell Computer Corporation both introduced computers earlier this month aimed at the sandals-and-socks crowd who got the industry started in the first place.
The new products blend hot-rod performance with prices just high enough to widen profit margins.


Works by American Indian Artists Brighten a New Mexico Town


BOMBAY HAUNTED BY RIOT MEMORIES
A dozen men, women and children, some Hindu, some Muslim, huddled in a tiny room and spoke of the fear that haunts the slum neighborhood of Tulsiwadi even as it recovers from sectarian riots that left homes in ruins last January.
"When people shout suddenly, or bang a door loudly, or somebody smashes a bottle, we feel afraid; the children rush inside," said Chayaraje Goswami, who sat nursing a baby in the small dwelling.
Others on the floor around her nodded.


At Home on an Island
I wake up at dawn in book-tour panic.
What city am I in?
What time is it?
Have I slept through a major media market, left a zillion book buyers hanging -- finally, after two months on the road, blown it?
Lying here, I try to unscramble a tired brain before opening exhausted eyes.
The acrid-sweet scent of salt drifts into my nostrils, the seductive back and forth of waves stroking sand curls into my ears, and even before I open my eyes I know I am home at last, on Martha's Vineyard.
Thanks to the presence of the Clintons and their entourage, the island where "Jaws" was filmed is under attack by media sharks. (It's happened before.) Big-city reporters in leisure wear do live broadcasts from one of the six small towns that make up Martha's Vineyard.
Hype, anticipation and paranoia reign.
I wonder if the man outside my window, who has tended the flowers in Ocean Park for decades, is himself or a member of the Secret Service in disguise.


English to Join Wolves
The former South Carolina shooting guard, JO JO ENGLISH, will sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves next week, his agent and a Minnesota assistant coach say.
English, a free agent who played for South Carolina in 1991-1992, played in six Chicago Bulls games last season, scoring 6 points.
In the Continental Basketball Association, English averaged 14.5 points for the Tri-City Chinooks and led all C.B.A. players in scoring during the playoffs with a 27.7 average. (AP)


At What Price?
To the Sports Editor:
I have read with great concern and disgust reports that the Mets are considering paying Vince Coleman the balance of his contract ($3 million) to be rid of his negative influence on the team.
As a loyal supporter asked to pay rising and consequently exorbitant ticket prices for such an unrewarding commodity, I find the prospect of the Mets' generosity extremely offensive.


Kelly Details His Reversal On Weapons
Over years of debate about whether the New York City Police Department should adopt the semiautomatic handgun as its weapon of choice, Raymond W. Kelly was consistently one of the gun's most vocal opponents, using reams of statistics to make one basic point: The old .38-caliber revolver did the job just as well and posed less danger to bystanders and officers.
But when it came down to a decision, Mr.
Kelly, now the Police Commissioner, pushed aside any sort of probing scientific analysis, and relied instead on conversations with the officers on the beat.


Elizabeth Horwich and Jay Lurie
Elizabeth Ann Horwich, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.

New Clothes, Tattered Clothes
To the Editor:
"The Emperor's New Clothes" has been revived in your Aug. 1 article on deconstructionist fashions (July 25).
Many of us may eventually be forced to dress in tatters and scraps from rubbish cans, but choosing to pay big bucks to wear garments with unfinished seams and makeshift sleeves is at the very least an act of hypocrisy.

Sports of The Times; The Spin On Pitching Rotations
DAVID CONE sat in the Kansas City clubhouse at Yankee Stadium yesterday and discussed the division race, not the one the Yankees are in but the one involving the Royals.
In his year away from New York, Cone has lost nothing off his fastball or his candor.
"This is a tough road trip for us," the former Mets pitcher said.
"And this is the series that really scared us because we knew myself and Kevin Appier wouldn't be pitching here. It makes this game all the more important. Magnante is a fine pitcher, but when you're basing your hopes on a guy making his first major league start this year, you're really hoping."


Technology; A Toll Collector on the Information Highway
MATTHEW P. LAWLOR, whose phones have rung almost nonstop lately, sounded a bit giddy when he fielded yet another call about his company's new patent.
"It's a very broad patent," he explained for perhaps the 10th time that day.
Mr.
Lawlor, 45, is president of the Online Resources and Communications Corporation, a small privately owned company in McLean, Va., which early this month received a patent that could make him and his investors fabulously rich.
On the face of it at least, the patent appears to cover any at-home transaction in which consumers debit their bank accounts through an automated teller machine (A.T.M.) network.

Again, That Hankering
At the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, the historian Frederick Jackson Turner startled the intellectual establishment when he read a paper asserting that "the true point of view in the history of this nation is not the Atlantic Coast. It is the Great West." And it was now closed, according to a United States Census Bureau report of the same time, fully restrained by reservations, barbed wire, mining claims, civil disputes over grazing rights and the railroad.
A century later, the West is further hobbled by planes, automobiles, rest stops and all-night minimarts whose offerings of lottery tickets allow them to pose as 20th-century gold mines.
Yet in the country's heart of hearts, the frontier remains forever open, waiting to be rediscovered whenever America needs to go home.
Judging from the bafflement that attends the mind-boggling riddles of today -- is it O.K. to lie, cheat, steal? -- this is just such a time.

Hints on Health Care, But Not on Its Price Tag
PRESIDENT CLINTON kicked off his campaign to remodel the nation's health-care system with a speech last week to the National Governors' Association in Tulsa, Okla.
But he did not divulge many new details of his proposal, which is tentatively scheduled for submission to Congress next month.
The President's speech reverberated with broad political themes as he reaffirmed his commitment to health insurance coverage for all Americans.
Mr.
Clinton put no price tag on his proposal, said nothing about new taxes, and rejected concerns that a Federal requirement that employers provide health insurance for their employees would dry up jobs.


Giants Win, but Grumbling Surfaces
The Giants beat the Jets tonight, 14-13, but it's only the preseason, so that victory was not that important.
What might be important, though is a rift that seems to be developing between some of the older Giants players, used to their way of doing things, and the new Giants coaching staff, which is trying to create something special of its own.
Apparently, the transition to the Dan Reeves era isn't going smoothly.
Several of the Giants veterans have publicly complained that they don't understand the way the new coaching staff works.
The latest to express some discontent is nose tackle Erik Howard, who after the Jets game fired several shots at the coaching staff.
One member of the staff, defensive coordinator Mike Nolan, returned the volley.

With Business Weak, Stocks Are Strong
AFTER the Mississippi flooded and New York boiled in July, August has finally produced a summer rally.
And not just on Wall Street.
Europe also is clanging along.
The economies may not be growing much, meaning that there is no great need to build plants or buy equipment.
But cash has to go somewhere, and now it is going into stocks and bonds.
Every major U.S. stock index moved to a new high last week, with the Dow Jones industrial average topping 3,600.
But it is hard to find much joy among investors.
Perhaps that reflects the fact this rally has not been like the barnburners of old.
"We have crawled higher," says Hugh Johnson, the strategist at First Albany.


Dinosaurs In Two Cities
This summer and fall, dinosaur enthusiasts can see the next best thing to the T. rex and raptor clones in "Jurassic Park" -- computerized robotic versions.
In New Haven, the Peabody Museum's exhibit "Dinosaur Visions: Science and Fiction in 'Jurassic Park"' features 10 roaring, robotic saurians, from a Velociraptor to a baby T. rex.
In displays and in an accompanying booklet, the exhibit ponders some of the scientific issues raised in the Michael Crichton book and subsequent film and discusses dinosaur biology and behavior.
The museum, at 170 Whitney Avenue (I-91, Exit 3, Trumbull Street), is open daily.
The exhibit runs through Oct. 31.
Admission, which includes entrance to the museum's permanent exhibits, is $8 for adults, and $5 for children ages 3 to 15.

A MILD CASE
I have worked in the field of developmental disabilities for the past 24 years and can appreciate Jack J. Hersch's concern about his son (About Men: "A Mild Case," Aug. 1).
However, subjecting a 3-year-old child with a diagnosis of "mild" cerebral palsy to eight hours a week of therapy, as well as to a father's doubts about whether or not he will ever be "normal," will ultimately prove to be far more debilitating than the disability.


Iran's Shadow; Fundamentalism Alters the Mideast's Power Relationships
THE bomb explosion that killed five people and wounded Egypt's Interior Minister in downtown Cairo last week added a sense of urgency to Washington's concern over the challenge of Islamic fundamentalism to the West and its allies in the Muslim world.
A group known as al-Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack on the minister, Hassan al-Alfi, but so far Egyptian police have made no arrests.
From his hospital bed, Mr.
Alfi condemned the attackers and questioned how true Muslims could plot murder against their brethren.
His harsh tone mirrored the stern measures Egypt has taken against radical Islamists.
Since December, Egyptian military courts have sentenced to death 25 Muslim fundamentalists who have been engaged in violent anti-Government activity, including four condemned yesterday for murder and plotting to overthrow the Government.


Some Old-Time Favorites From the Sea
DESPITE all the newfangled foods and ingredients on the market there are a number of time-honored classics that never cease to tempt.
No amount of radicchio salad can quite compare with a well-crafted coleslaw, for example.
Smoked scallops are intriguing but lack the irresisti-ble nibble power of crisp, golden rings of fried calamari.
Littleneck clams or mussels steamed open in a broth bolstered with sharply briny Chinese fermented black beans are delicious, to be sure, but given the choice, a simple bowl of mussels steamed in white wine and garlic might be even more appealing.

Another Development In Cable Competition
Your article about cable TV  [ "Greenburgh Residents Seek Better Cable TV," Aug. 8 ]  accurately depicts the situation here.
Furthermore, it showed insightful reporting of the meeting details as well as the subtle qualities of our local politicians.
Paul Feiner is receptive to new ideas and is a can-do leader who offers great hope for future progress.
While your article was being produced, a further development in cable television competition was announced.
Bell Atlantic has teamed up with a cellular television transmitting company and will invade Nynex's New York area to provide wireless cable that can be received with a small, flat disk antenna at about half the cost of cable TV.
This new venture has also been invited to compete in the Greenburgh Cable TV "sweepstakes."


Woman Dies After Being Found in Limo
A Queens woman died early yesterday after being found unconscious in the back seat of a stretch limousine parked outside a Brooklyn restaurant, the police said.
The woman, Kathleen Palumbo, 30, of 253-31 148th Road, in Rosedale, Queens, was taken to Long Island College Hospital after the driver of the limousine flagged down a passing police car.
She was pronouced dead on arrival at 5:15 A.M, a hospital administrator said.

Singing the Praises of Sweet Alyssum
SOME may think it a waste of space.
Others not.
But it is time to sing the praises of a dainty, yet undaunted annual.
So here goes.
The lucky plant is none other than that somewhat lowly garden favorite, sweet alyssum.
This has not been an easy summer for any plants.
The heat coupled with high humidity and lack of good soaking rainfall has seared many ornamental plants including some valuable shrubbery.
Some plants are thirsty and drooping.
Some have wilting leaves and no flowers.
Some plants have even died.


Croats Keep Food Convoys From Muslim Half of a City
United Nations officials delivered a single truckload of medicine to the besieged Muslim half of Mostar today, but Bosnian Croats again refused to allow a convoy of food through to an estimated 55,000 Muslims who officials say are within days of starvation.
The single truck of medicine, which was described as a mere token delivery, was allowed through to the bedraggled Muslims during a visit to the encircled eastern side of Mostar by the chief political officer of the United Nations military force in the Balkans, Cedric Thornberry.


Lure of Dracula In Transylvania
For years, the Government of President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania tried to play down the figure who for many foreigners was the country's most famous native son: Vlad Tepes, the 15th-century Romanian prince famous in his own time for impaling his enemies, and who was immortalized for later generations as the bloodthirsty Count in Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula."
Now, Romanian tour operators are happy to use the legend to lure visitors to Transylvania, a beautiful, mountainous region in western Romania.
The tours, developed by the Transylvanian Society of Dracula, are all centered around the Castle Dracula, a modern hotel, built on the edge of the Borgo Pass.
Highlights include visits to historic castles and monasteries and a heavy dollop of theatricality: masked balls, twilight visits to cemeteries, and "diplomas" certifying participants have survived their encounter with the Count.
The society also emphasizes the folklore around the Dracula legend.
Tours, which range from about $300 to $1,000 a person for 4 to 15 days, including bus and plane transport from Bucharest are custom designed and may be scheduled for any time.
Group size is flexible.
For more information contact Bravo Tours in Bucharest, Romania, at (40-1) 312-5439.
That number is also the fax number.

Wall Street; Looking to the Index Peak Is Comfort for the Bulls
WALL STREET'S technical analysts feel best about stock markets in which all the key indexes set new highs at around the same time, confirming a trend is in place.
Last week, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other closely watched indexes hit all-time highs, the bulls finally got some comfort when one stubborn laggard -- the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 -- finally bettered its previous high.
The S.&amp; P. 500 hit its previous all-time high of 456.33 on March 10.
On Thursday, it finally got past that benchmark, closing at 456.43.
Even the laggard S.&amp; P.transportation index, which hit an all-time high of 405.65 on April 15, moved past its previous high, closing at 408.39 Thursday.
On Friday, the S.&amp; P. tranports closed at 402.50; the 500 at 456.16.


Business Border War Heats Up
THE Westchester Industrial Development Agency's latest radio ads are pitching the county's $25 million budget surplus, its hold-the-line policy on taxes and its green parks, scenic shorelines and "unsurpassed quality of life."

"If you're ready, here's today's question: Why is Westchester a great business location?"

August 15-21; Demjanjuk Remains in Prison: Israeli Holocaust Survivors Win a Stay of Extradition
John Demjanjuk has moved closer to getting back to the United States, but the Israeli courts are not through with him yet in the "Ivan the Terrible" case.
A panel of Supreme Court justices saw no reason last week to interfere with conclusions reached before by other judges and the Israeli Government: that reasonable doubt warrants reversal of Mr.
Demjanjuk's 1988 conviction of having been "Ivan the Terrible," the gas-chamber operator at the Nazis' Treblinka death camp; and that strong evidence exists that he was a guard at another extermination camp, but legal realities argue against another war-crimes trial.


Josephine Esquivel, Joseph Murphy
Josephine R. Esquivel, a senior vice president at Lehman Brothers, was married yesterday to Joseph M. Murphy, a vice president and a manager of retail products at Smith Barney Shearson.
Both work in New York.
The Rev.

Thomas More in New York.
Ms.
Esquivel, 38, is keeping her name.
She graduated cum laude from the University of Miami and received an M.B.A. from Harvard University.
She is the daughter of Hildelisa Cabezas of Miami.


After the Trade Clouds, A Rainbow for Gallego
Mike Gallego does not like to recall the dark days of April.
It was only four months ago when he had a permanent seat in the dugout and the Yankees were trying to trade him.
Spike Owen was the $7 million shortstop, Gallego was the $5.1 million statue beside the bat rack.
His mind often wandered.
"I wondered where I was going to be living the next day and where I was going to send my family," said Gallego, who had two at-bats in the first 17 games of the season.
"It was one of those situations you had to deal with. It wasn't peachy."


For Susan Marshall, Eloquence Is Movement
The characters in Susan Marshall's dances can be bitter rivals one moment, only to give one another mutual support the next.
Sometimes she finds it surprisingly difficult to draw distinctions between friends and foes.
Ms.
Marshall concerns herself with human relationships and, over the past decade, has returned to certain themes again and again.
Her obsessions were especially apparent this summer when Susan Marshall and Company, the troupe she directs, presented two premieres and several pieces from its repertory at Alice Tully Hall in the Serious Fun festival.


Life With Both Daddy and Father
COMING UP DOWN HOME A Memoir of a Southern Childhood.
By Cecil Brown. 222 pp.
Hopewell, N.J.: The Ecco Press. $24.95.
AN ineluctable element of the African-American tradition, and indeed now a part of the American tradition, is the representative nature of autobiography.
Well before the slave narratives established an "I" as "we" in the black experience, the speaker in autobiography spoke for the community in many essential ways.
From Frederick Douglass to Arthur Ashe, the record of plight and travail and triumph speaks to "our" lives as a group, as Everyman and Everywoman, singing an infinity of riffs on the sorrow and the Gospel.
As the tradition has endured, it has continued to create surprising modulations and variations on the themes of racism, struggle, womanhood and manhood.
James Baldwin (in his novels and essays), Maya Angelou, Lorene Cary, Gordon Parks: all have been giving us, in these later decades, new ways of singing a song echoing through 300 years.

It isn't just the wagon wheels and pine furniture about to be sold (or the detritus of more recent times, like used Christmas ornaments and plastic clocks) that evoke the feeling of participating in a peculiarly American ritual.


New Airlines Offer Schedules Around the U.S.
There are at least three new additions to the bumper crop of companies starting scheduled air service.
They include Private Jet, an Atlanta-based charter company, (800) 949-9400, which has begun regular service between Atlanta and Miami, and between Miami and Chicago.
On the Atlanta-Miami route, Private Jet offers four daily flights, and charges $99 one way for walk-up passengers.
It also charges a $15 fee for a reservation one way; $25 for a round trip.


Thriving Plants In Late Summer
Keep cutting annuals, to promote continued blooming until frost.
Fertilize annuals and potted plants monthly.
Plant and transplant evergreens, especially hollies.
Water thoroughly, and continue to water these plants deeply each week if there is no rain.


The Ice Capades
Like a plunge into icy waters off a parched dock, a spoonful of ice cream is a joy and a shock on a summer day.
Its chilly improbability delivers a jolt that awakens the mouth.
On a sultry day, its airy texture is a reprieve.
But like any deliverance, ice cream is an ephemeral one, at least physiologically.
In seconds, the confection can go from a proud, firm freeze to a dribbling mess.
And no sooner has ice cream shocked the palate than it numbs the senses.
Of course, after the initial plunge, one gets used to icy waters, too.
So one continues to dive, continues to press tongue to frozen cream, searching for that delicious jolt.


Provence
To the Editor: "Glimpses of the Real Provence," by Catherine Texier, (Feb. 14) was very useful to my husband and me in choosing a place to stay in Provence.
I wrote to several of the inns listed, received replies, and chose Hostellerie Les Gorges de Pennafort, from which we have just returned.
Our room was comfortable, the restaurant was excellent and the staff charming and helpful.
The location permitted us to visit many of the places mentioned in the article as well as many other attractions in Provence.


Environmentalists Try To Move the Markets
INSTEAD of just climbing smokestacks, holding demonstrations, filing lawsuits, and twisting the arms of legislators and regulators, environmental groups keep finding other ways to advance their goals.
One approach, unheard of just a few years ago, is to cooperate with major corporations.
Last week, the Environmental Defense Fund announced that it would team up with five big companies and a university to promote the use of recycled paper.


Commercial Property: The Electronic Revolution; Behind the Fast Decisions and Designs -- Computers
WHEN Anthony E. Malkin, president of W &amp; M Properties, negotiates a lease in a W &amp; M-managed building, he doesn't talk about net present value or internal rate of return or cash flow.
He barely discusses how the cost of commissions or of customizing space affected his asking rent.
He just quotes a rent for move-in-ready space, and a couple of escalations.


A Multitude of Sins and Egocentric Traits
To the Editor:
Few would deny John Updike's erudition or his engaging style as a writer, but reading widely and writing well are not enough to sustain his effort to wash clean the deadly sin of lust (June 20).


Arms Industry Yields to Show Business
JOHN C. MARKOWICZ was walking through his company's 7,000-square-foot sound stage in Waterford recently explaining how Sonalysts Inc. had achieved the quietest studios in the nation by employing the same technology it used to make American submarines the quietest in the world.
But it took a construction crew to force home his point.
As Mr.
Markowicz opened a dividing door and stepped into a second sound stage, the din of hammers and drills filled the air.
Six men were working on a sliding overhead door, but so perfectly are the studios insulated for sound that there had been no hint of the work in the next room.
That kind of quiet is expected to give the company an advantage in attracting film productions because producers will not have to worry about errant noise ruining a "take."


Odd Instruments From Everyday Objects
MUSICAL instruments constructed from domestic and found objects are sending joyful noises throughout the Hudson River Museum here.
The source is an interactive exhibition, aptly titled "Hit It!" in defiance of the usual museum admonition not to touch.
It consists of more than 30 instruments assembled by Katherine Teck, a White Plains musician.
Metal washtubs, saucepans and tubing; scraps of wood and marble veneer; plastic gadgets, wooden spoons and seashells are among the objects -- chosen for their sound when struck, scraped or shaken -- from which these instruments are made.


Peel Her a Grape
FOR the finale there were bubbles -- big beautiful bubbles with Technicolor touches.
They floated silently past the heart-shaped floral tribute of white carnations and orchids and up, up to Mae West's crypt.
"Who is that woman with the bubble wand?" one man asked his companion.


Corrections
A picture caption on the Technology page last Sunday, describing how tiny glass balls known as "Heller's beads" convert petroleum into white, nontoxic granules, misstated the time needed to clean the material shown in five petri dishes.
The beads remove the oil's toxicity in four days, but it took 90 days to achieve the clean white granules seen in the fifth dish.


Cheaper Chic
Here are the accesories that help to make the fall look.
And get a load of the prices.
A flippy brimmed hat and snappy boots are some of fall's finishing touches.


Andre Meets Andrei: New One Wins
There they were, the next Andrei, a bionic beanstalk of an 18-year-old boy from Ukraine, forcing the issue with the inimitable Andre, the splashy sight-and-sound bite from Las Vegas who's trying to reassure himself his better days are not, at 23, behind him.
The newcomer, the fifth-seeded Andrei Medvedev, took tonight's prize, a berth in the final of the Volvo International, with a 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-4 victory that pitted his uncanny serving prowess against the cagey return repertory of Andre Agassi.


THE (BRUISED) EMPEROR OF THE OUTDOORS
In "The (Bruised) Emperor of the Outdoors" (Aug. 1), Timothy Egan nicely captures Bruce Babbitt's vision for a new design at Interior, but he errs in reporting that Babbitt has not shown his hand on the question of adding new units to America's national park system.
Twice this year, I have listened to Babbitt eloquently testify before Congress in support of the California Desert Protection Act.
The largest national parks acquisition bill since the Alaska Lands Act of 1980, the Desert Protection Act would create a 1.5-million-acre Mojave national park and would add more than 1.5 million acres to Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Monument, redesignating both units as national parks.


Corrections
A picture caption last Sunday about the impact of a Saturn Corporation plant on the town of Spring Hill, Tenn., mislocated Peter Hudson's bar, which depends on the business from Saturn workers.
It is in Columbia, a nearby town that has also been changed by the plant, not in Spring Hill.


More on the Question of Buying Black
To the Editor:
Bravo to Bernard W. Kinsey ("Nothing Else Has Worked. Buy Black," Viewpoints, Aug. 1) for the courage to say what we have privately thought for years -- that the minority community has enough capital and consumers to almost guarantee success to small minority store owners in the inner city.


Giner E. Mendez, 56, High-Wire Performer
Giner E. Mendez, a high-wire performer for 30 years in circuses and for television and films, died at his home in Orlando, Fla., on Aug. 11.

NOTES
The women's boxing trend has hit the workout-video market.
"Boxout: The New Way to Exercise" is a new hourlong video that combines boxing and aerobics.
It shows Sugar Ray Leonard, the former middleweight and welterweight champion, coaching Jill Good acre (both left), a 29-year-old model and the fiancee of the singer Harry Connick Jr.
Miss Goodacre thinks most women are not natural pugilists.
"Girls tend to do the chicken when they punch," she said.
"The elbows go out. Sugar Ray taught me how to keep your elbows in, your guards up, and punch with your wrists perfectly straight."


Refugee Has Rare Chance to Be in 'Heaven'
When 657 smuggled immigrants were sent back to China from three crowded ships off Mexico last month without formal hearings, the United States authorities brought just one man ashore to plead his case for asylum, a 22-year-old teacher named Liu Jiang.
Mr.
Liu, dressed in bright orange prison clothing, now waits in an immigration detention center here, smiling and bewildered at his luck, a reminder of the complexities of immigration issues and the difficulty of tightening border controls without sacrificing human rights.


Arrest in Boy's Starving Death
A 13-month-old boy was found dead of starvation in his crib in a Yonkers apartment Friday night, and the boy's mother was charged with murder yesterday in his death, the police said.
The boy, Saleem Groom, was found about 5 P.M.
Friday after officers responding to a 911 call saw his mother, Rebecca Groom, 28, in a frantic state in front of her apartment building at 55 Ravine Avenue, Detective Sgt.
William Rinaldi said.


Sophie McNabb, Charles Dowling
Sophie Ray McNabb, the daughter of Mary R. McNabb and Jerry G. McNabb, both of Dallas, was married yesterday in Providence, R.I., to Charles Tappan Dowling, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Joseph L. Dowling Jr. of Providence.
The Rev.
Robert J. Randall performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at the Manning Chapel at Brown University.
Mrs.
Dowling, 25, is an account executive at the Alfstad Blank Group, an advertising agency in New York.
She graduated cum laude from Wellesley College.
Her father is a financial consultant in Dallas.
Her mother is an associate in the Dallas office of the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges.


The Wharton School of Design
When the movie version of Edith Wharton's "Age of Innocence" opens in September, its turn-of-the-century sets will be crammed with furnishings the novelist abhorred: heavy drapes, tufted velvets, lace doilies and memorabilia-encrusted tables.
Wharton (1862-1937) couldn't stand the interiors of wealthy old New York, and often had her heroes and heroines trying vainly to liberate themselves from their claustrophobic embrace.
In her fiction, and especially in her first book, "The Decoration of Houses," which she wrote in collaboration with her architect, Ogden Codman, in 1897, Wharton assumed the role of an upper-crust subversive whose mission was to topple the dominant esthetic.


Logical, But Stylish
To the Editor:
I would like to commend Emily Prager on her article concerning the sunscreen suit (The Dressing Room, Aug. 1).
I found it refreshing to hear of a stylish, logical alternative to oiling up and basking.

Wolverines Set, But the Schedule Is Troublesome
With Elvis having left the building, can Michigan still be the king?
A smooth succession at quarterback, where Todd Collins would step in for the departed Elvis Grbac, combines with a swift and powerfull running game and a defense with eight players that have at least part-time starting experience to give the wolverines a chance for their first national championship since 1948.


Ubiquitous Umbilicus
The exposed navel is back, with a cool attitude that discourages unsolicited remarks and whistles.
The fashion world has been uncovering the midriff for eons: the style's origins date to ancient Rome.
In this century, the bare midriff reappeared in the 1930's strictly for beach wear, and it has been in and out of fashion ever since.
It is now an everyday sight on Fifth Avenue.
Young women are teaming minuscule tops with hip-huggers that expose the navel or with skirts whose waistbands hit just above the navel, although they can also take a stylish dip below it.
The exposure can be anywhere from a few inches to a foot deep.
For some young women, the effect is achieved by tying a common T-shirt into a front knot (lower far right).
One of the most creative looks (left of the T-shirt) combines a sleeveless, transparent net overdress that veils the wearer from the neck to the ankle.


World Markets; Puzzling Over Market Performance
TWO things Jay Pelosky does with Morgan Stanley's Latin American Discovery Fund illustrate the difficulties money managers and investors have measuring the performance of emerging markets, like those in Latin America.
The markets are still risky, but are among the world's fastest growing.
How performance should be measured has become a hot issue, and investment firms are competing to produce indexes that will be used by money managers around the world.


Wall Street; A Gift for Buying Low on the Bayou
THE cajun chefs of the bayou country are known for their aptitude at cooking up a spicy repast.
But their seasoning is bland compared with the hot stock of one local Louisiana operation.
Shares of Skylink America Inc., a Dallas-based operation whose most valuable asset is a permit to run a Baton Rouge gambling boat, soared to $5.625 a share by Friday's close, up 1003 percent from a puny $.50 a share on May 3.


It All Comes Out in the Wash
Once, at the end of a drought-stricken summer, I traveled a great distance to visit a friend with terminal cancer.
As befits such an occasion, the trip took on the nature of a quest.
First, the 125-mile drive across the burnt-brown grassland to the Bismarck, N.D., airport; a plane to Minneapolis and then to La Guardia, where I waited nearly two hours for my suitcase; a bus into Manhattan; a taxi to a crowded Penn Station, where I stood for another two hours waiting for a train.
It was August, and all the city's heat seemed concentrated in that room.
But I am so unused to crowds of strangers that I felt a strange contentment in their midst.
Contentment turned to bliss on the train ride to Rhode Island; the trees seemed tropically luxuriant, the Atlantic Ocean a wonder.
My friend's husband met me at the small-town station near their farm and filled me in on his wife's condition.
She was recovering from a round of chemotherapy, weak but in good spirits.
She was reading in bed when I arrived, but soon roused herself and led me to a cramped room off the kitchen.
The ovarian tumor had made her bloat like a starved child, and she moved and spoke slowly.
"I've been saving this for you," she said, gesturing to three large baskets full of clothes.
"Dimir would wash it all together," she went on, "and he fills the machine too full. And," she concluded, lowering her voice, "he'd put it in the dryer. Men don't understand that laundry must be hung on the line."

'The Trip to Bountiful,' Round Trip
NOTHING much happens in "The Trip to Bountiful," only that a woman replenishes her soul.
Mrs.
Carrie Watts, cooped up in a two-room Houston apartment with a wimpy son (Ludie) and a pestering, thoroughly unpleasant daughter-in-law (Jessie Mae), dreams of returning to Bountiful, her hometown, once more before dying.
Heaven knows she's tried, over and over, to run away.
But Ludie and Jessie Mae keep getting her back from the train station.


2d Verdict Reached in Detroit Beating Case
A second verdict was reached today in the cases of three former Detroit police officers accused of fatally beating a motorist.
But the decision, like the first verdict, will not be announced until the last verdict is decided.
Separate juries heard the cases against two of the former officers, Walter Budzyn, 47, and Larry Nevers, 53.
As one jury announced that it had reached agreement in Mr.
Budzyn's case, the other jury continued to weigh the evidence against Mr.
Nevers.
It will resume on Monday.


Byrd's Recovery
To the Editor:
As an orthopedic surgeon since 1946, I have seen many kinds of spine fractures incurred in many different settings, from the battlefields of World War II and Korea to the playing fields of many sports teams.
The professional management of such injuries has changed profoundly in their immediate care and in securing immobilization during transport until diagnosis and effective treatment can be delivered.


Bridget Brennan and Douglas Jensen
Bridget Gale Brennan, an assistant district attorney, and Douglas Raymond Jensen, an assistant United States attorney, plan to be married in October.
Both work in New York.
Miss Brennan, 38, graduated from the University of Wisconsin, where she also received a law degree.
She is a daughter of Mary Brennan of Wauwatosa, Wis., and the late Gale P. Brennan.


Rethinking the Rules
Hemlines are down.
Then again, many are up.
Pants seem to be the better bottom half of a suit.
But not necessarily.
There is a rush of romantic fashion echoing the Edwardian era.
Yet there is an equally strong movement toward clothing as stark as that worn in a seminary.
Fabrics that used to signify formality -- like velvet or satin -- now look fine for day, whereas tweed is suggested for evening.
Shirttails hang out instead of tucking in.
Jackets swing with only one of their buttons fastened.
Chunky boots stick out under evening get-ups, and sneakers have become a favorite for footgear anytime.
These are just a few of the fashion ideas floating around this fall, in a season that looks as if style has loosened its moorings, blown caution to the winds and is just possibly spinning out of control.
Long gone, of course, are the days when simple rules governed the way women dressed.
This fall, there seem to be no rules at all.
The new laissez-faire attitude has brought a group of previously avant-garde designers practically into the mainstream.
In Paris, there are the so-called "deconstructionists," like Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester, and the masterful mix and un-matchers such as Lamine Kouyate for Xuly-Bet, Dries van Noten and Jean Colonna.
From Germany, Jil Sander has emerged as a superb exponent of pared-down sophistication, while in New York, Calvin Klein almost seems to have been reborn as a stylist of stark simplicity.
But many familiar designers are floundering as this everything and anything atmosphere is promoted as a plausible way to dress.
And while young women accept it as delightful, many older ones seem confused if not dismayed by the turn of events.


West of Ireland
To the Editor: The article "Mountain, Sea and Story at Clew Bay" (June 20), and particularly the picture of the small chapel atop Croagh Patrick, brought back a wonderful memory.
About 30 years ago, my Irish cousins talked me into climbing Croagh Patrick.
Needless to say, I had no idea of what I was letting myself in for -- my "climbing" experience being limited to the New York subway stairs.

In the Pink
Honoring Blake Edwards, the director, Aug. 16


Some Old-Time Favorites From the Sea
DESPITE all the newfangled foods and ingredients on the market there are a number of time-honored classics that never cease to tempt.
No amount of radicchio salad can quite compare with a well-crafted coleslaw, for example.
Smoked scallops are intriguing but lack the irresisti-ble nibble power of crisp, golden rings of fried calamari.
Littleneck clams or mussels steamed open in a broth bolstered with sharply briny Chinese fermented black beans are delicious, to be sure, but given the choice, a simple bowl of mussels steamed in white wine and garlic might be even more appealing.


Robert R. Williams, Navy Captain Who Rescued Bush, Is Dead at 82
Robert R. Williams, the commander of the submarine that rescued George Bush when the Japanese shot down his bomber in World War II, died Thursday at a hospital in Bethesda, Md.
He was 82 and lived in Rockville, Md.
The cause was pneumonia as a complication of emphysema, his family said.


Move Over, Alabama: This Season's Top Spot Points to Michigan

In addition to each school's 1992 record and position in the final Times 1992 computer ranking, the graduation rate represents the percentage of players earning athletic financial aid to earn degrees in the four freshman classes that arrived from 1983 through 1986.
Those figures are from the 1993 N.C.A.A.

Singing the Praises of Sweet Alyssum
SOME may think it a waste of space.
Others not.
But it is time to sing the praises of a dainty, yet undaunted annual.
So here goes.
The lucky plant is none other than that somewhat lowly garden favorite, sweet alyssum.
This has not been an easy summer for any plants.
The heat coupled with high humidity and lack of good soaking rainfall has seared many ornamental plants including some valuable shrubbery.
Some plants are thirsty and drooping.
Some have wilting leaves and no flowers.
Some plants have even died.

Huskies' Don James Quits Over Penalties
The Pac-10 Conference today placed the University of Washington's football program on a two-year probation and prohibited the team from playing in post-season games for the next two years.
Hours after the announcement, Don James, the winningest football coach in the school's history, resigned.
The conference, which also barred Washington from receiving football television revenue during the coming season and reduced its football scholarships, penalized Washington for a "lack of institutional control" that allowed violations of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules by Huskies players.


Review/Dance; Black and White Rendering Of Love, Hate and the Blues
In "Black and White and Blue," presented on Saturday night at Performance Space 122, James Adlesic explores love and hate in sprawling but often poignant theater-dance pieces.
Mr.
Adlesic was an amusingly innocent lost soul looking for love in "Blue," which opened the program.
Set to popular blues songs sung by Jimmy Scott, the solo has Mr.
Adlesic flirting with an elegant mannequin who suddenly appears on stage.
Even a pair of red glittery shoes -- Dorothy's in "The Wizard of Oz" -- don't make this romance any smoother or more possible.
But "Blue" is a touching, often very dark picture of loneliness and dating games, performed by a dancer who knows how to use his distinctive presence to the fullest.
"Black and White," danced to music by the Tango Project, does not accomplish its goal of comparing homophobia to racism.
Instead, Mr.
Adlesic, who is white, and Niles Ford, who is black, move through a flowing series of vignettes about both forms of hatred with almost the approach of a diary writer.
Though Mr.
Adlesic wrote and choreographed "Black and White," the new piece seems most of all a project created by two friends to examine, onstage, shared memories, conversation and arguments about being gay and being black.


Ms. Falk, Mr. Leibowitz
Lisa Jane Falk, a daughter of Robert H. Falk of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Susan M. Falk of New York, was married yesterday to Lawrence David Leibowitz, a son of Dr. and Mrs.

Rabbi Mark Winer performed the ceremony at the Sunningdale Country Club in Scarsdale.
Mrs.
Leibowitz, 27, graduated from Emory University, as did her husband.
Her father is a principal of Apollo Advisers, an investment firm in New York.


Merchants Say Revival Bid Has Hurt, Not Helped
John Butler's grandfather opened the family paint store here on June 25, 1876, the day Custer made his last stand at the Little Big Horn.
Now it is the 58-year-old grandson who says he is making a last stand to keep Butler Paint open.
Mr.
Butler and other downtown merchants say they are the victims of a $24 million redevelopment project that, instead of reviving downtown retailing, they say, has crippled it.


Frenchman Rallies to Win Bronx Classic in 3 Sets
When you've been doing this for nine years, you learn not to panic.
You throw away balls that are no longer perfectly round.
You ask the people in the stands and around the fence to please be quiet.
And you break your opponent's serve in a crucial second set, thus breaking his confidence.


Mets Dig Deeper Hole In Rockies
The Mets had a change of altitude here, but not of attitude.
After they made a hero of skinny Freddie Benavides today and were swept three straight by the expansion Colorado Rockies, Manager Dallas Green questioned their desire and threatened to turn next spring training into a boot camp.
He said he might even outlaw all golf clubs next spring.


Inquiry in Parking Contract Puts Bureaucrat in Spotlight
The controversy over the way senior aides to Mayor David N. Dinkins chose a scandal-tainted company for a parking-violations contract has put an unaccustomed -- and uncomfortable -- spotlight on a little-known career bureaucrat, who was the only official investigators accused of violating the City Charter.
The official, Ellen Baer, the 39-year-old chief of staff to the First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, is one of the invisible but influential members of the city's permanent government, that large cadre of officials who operate the machinery of the city no matter who is in office.


Bridge
The leading winner at the American Bridge Association's Summer Nationals, which ended a week ago in Detroit, was Bobbye Caldwell of Chicago, who took three titles.
One of them was the Women's Pairs, partnering Dorothy Sides of Cincinnati, who also won the Bellsaw Open Pairs with Dr.
Arnold Jones of Chicago.
Jones was the declarer on the diagramed deal and faced a tricky problem in four spades.
With two immediate diamond losers, he had to hold his trump losers to one.
A diamond was led to the jack and East continued with the king and ace.
South ruffed low and was glad to avoid an overruff.


Soccer Success Forges New Bolivia Optimism
They come to the games with their faces painted in the national colors -- red, yellow and green -- and dance down the central boulevard, El Prado, to celebrate victories with a new pride and greater social unity than Bolivia has ever known as a country.
And all because of a soccer team.
This land-locked country is the poorest in Latin America, sets the record for military coups in the region and is often mocked by neighbors of fairer complexion for its large Indian population.
But Bolivians dare to dream the impossible -- qualifying as one of the 24 teams in next year's World Cup in the United States.


Feats of Skill Attract a Crowd


New York City Needs Its Consumer Agency
To the Editor:
Rudolph W. Giuliani's suggestion that as mayor he might stir New York City's economy by merging the Department of Consumer Affairs with a state agency (news article, Aug. 11) suggests an inadequate grasp of the purpose of both agencies.


Capital for Human Services
In East St.
Louis, Ill., one of the nation's poorest communities, the doors of a new Family Support Center will open in a few weeks.
Infants and preschoolers from very low-income families will receive high-quality, subsidized child care, enabling the parents to become or remain employed.
At the same location, parents will receive health-care services, parenting training and educational opportunities.
This initiative was made possible because capital improvement dollars were available from the Illinois Facilities Fund, a private, nonprofit lender, to help construct the facility.
Throughout Illinois, the need for capital to bring or expand human services in poor neighborhoods is acute.
These services, whether for the elderly, the disabled or infants of working mothers, are an integral part of any economic development plan.


Review/Dance; Nerve, Abandon and Good Manners
Ballet British Columbia, which performed on Thursday night at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival here, has had a tumultuous seven-year history, including frequent changes of directors and an alarming brush with a deficit and near-disbandment.
Now under the direction of John Alleyne, the company has maintained a daring goal for so young a troupe: to present only modern ballet choreography, with a little modern dance, choreographed after 1975.
Unsurprisingly, the company style is equal parts nerve and restrained theatricality, the latter a quality that, coupled with careful classical training, recalls Mr.
Alleyne's formative years as a dancer and choreographer with the National Ballet of Canada and the Stuttgart Ballet.
The troupe's 18 dancers display a physical abandon that never loses sight of good ballet manners.
It is an odd combination that worked well in Mr.
Alleyne's 1990 "Go Slow, Walter," the highlight of a program that was repeated through Saturday.
The piece gets off to a striking start with its brilliant yellow set and costumes and its score, John Cage's invigorating, rollicking Three Dances for Two Prepared Pianos.

Kidder's subject, perhaps too closely.


The Romance Novel: A World of Dreams And Tough Realities
Lynne Chandley of Elizabethtown, Ky., is a 35-year-old legal secretary who once dreamed of dating a rock star, so it seemed natural for her to write a book about a romance between a legal secretary and a rock star.
He's her dream boyfriend, with a drug problem that was cured long ago and flowing blond hair that is scrupulously clean.
Of course, their relationship is threatened when their worlds collide.
"She's the guardian of her 16-year-old sister, Cassie, and her sister becomes pregnant by the drummer in the band," Ms.
Chandley said.
That's not all: the heroine, to the alarm of her fancy-free beau, ends up pregnant, too, even though she had thought she was infertile.


The Faithful Persevere One Year After Hurricane Andrew


New Survey Planned Of Black Americans
Essence Communications Inc. and Simmons Market Research Bureau Inc. have teamed up for a national survey intended to provide marketers with demographic and behavioral data about black American consumers.
The study, called the Essence/Simmons African-American National Survey, begins this week with a panel of 1,000 people in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.
It will be broadened to survey 10,000 respondents in urban, suburban and rural areas.


One Year After Storm, Victims Still Struggling
Victor and Diane Brantley thought their lives would surely have returned to normal by now, that a year after Hurricane Andrew ripped through South Florida they and their four children would not still be living in a cramped trailer in their backyard.
But they say the contractor they paid $44,305 to rebuild their storm-damaged house absconded with their money and then went bankrupt, and Mr.
Brantley, a 44-year-old prison guard, had a stroke that forced him to give up his job.
Mrs.
Brantley, 42, earns $9,800 as a teacher's assistant, but says she is staggering under the weight of being the family's sole breadwinner as well as her own contractor on a shoestring budget.


Philadelphia's Newspapers Prepare for Possible Strike
Labor strikes have deprived residents here of their daily newspapers 11 times since 1970.
The most recent walkout, in 1985, was the longest, lasting 46 days and costing the local economy millions of dollars through the loss of the city's principal channels of print advertising.
With 14 contracts for 10 unions expiring at midnight on Aug. 31, about 3,000 employees of the city's major dailies, The Philadelphia Inquirer and the tabloid Philadelphia Daily News, may be ready to walk again.
So far, three unions have voted to authorize a strike.
But this time, the publisher of both papers, Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., which is owned by the Knight-Ridder chain, intends no disruption of service.

4 People Critically Injured in Four-Alarm Tenement Fire
Four people, two of them young children, were in critical condition from smoke inhalation following a four-alarm fire of suspicious origin that destroyed their five-story tenement in upper Manhattan yesterday.
Twenty-five firefighters were injured battling what one fire official called "an incredible amount of fire" in a brick building containing two stores and 10 dwelling units at 1966 Seventh Avenue at West 118th Street in central Harlem.

Review/Music; Cecilia Bartoli Sings A Survey of Mozart, And a Pinch of Rossini
The 26th Mostly Mozart Festival ended on Saturday evening, and with a flair for showmanship otherwise rarely evident in this year's seven-jweek series, Lincoln Center saved its biggest drawing card for last.
The soloist was Cecilia Bartoli, the 27-year-old Italian mezzo-soprano who in the last few years has become the opera world's darling, and not without reason.
Her performances in New York have been uncommonly musical, and she has the stage presence to make arias and songs the self-contained dramas they ought to be.
What's more, Mostly Mozart can claim her as a trophy, having presented her American debut in 1990.
Miss Bartoli's contributions to the program were Mozart's "Exsultate, jubilate," "Lungi le cure ingrate" from "Davidde Penitente," and "Parto, parto," from "La Clemenza di Tito." She added a couple of fiery Rossini arias as encores: "Tanti affetti" from "La Donna del Lago," and "Una voce poco fa" from "Il Barbiere di Siviglia."


METRO DIGEST
NEW TWISTS IN CHINESE IMMIGRATION  Undeterred by the fate of their countrymen who struggled ashore from a stranded freighter off the Rockaway Peninsula in June, or by a crackdown ordered by President Clinton soon afterward, growing numbers of illegal Chinese immigrants are coming to the United States, immigration officials and lawyers say.
But as law-enforcement authorities have focused their attention on stopping more boats from landing, many smugglers have turned to airplanes as their favored route of passage, and have developed new schemes to camouflage the small groups that arrive by plane each day.

NEW YORK CITY RETIREES HEAD BACK TO NEW YORK  Despite the fear of crime, grime and hassles in the city that never sleeps, experts say a growing number of retirees are bucking decades-old migration patterns by moving to New York for its quality of life.
Older and sicker than when they left, they have returned to be closer to family and for the city's plentiful services.
The retirement migration has contributed at least in part to an explosion in the city's elderly population, officials say.

SEARCHING FOR A KILLER AND A MOTIVE  In the tense neighborhoods of Crown Heights and Brownsville, the police are searching for a man who has killed four people and critically wounded two more.
Investigators say they are not able to determine either the motive or determine how the gunman chose his victims.
All they have been able to do is establish, through ballistics tests, that the same 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol was used in the shootings, which began Aug. 12.
In most cases, the victims were left with their valuables.
The killer, the police said, simply walked up to his victims and began to shoot.

East Harlem Woman Dies When Hit by Stray Bullet
It was getting dark Saturday evening when Anna Ruiz finished praying with neighbors in an apartment of a building next to hers in the Robert F. Wagner Houses in East Harlem.
She passed up coffee and sweets to get home before nightfall.
But the 61-year-old widow did not complete the short walk to her building across the courtyard.
Less than 50 yards from the front door, she was struck and killed by a stray bullet, one of at least three New Yorkers who were struck by random gunfire in a few short hours on Saturday.


Alison Smithson Dies; British Architect, 65
Alison Smithson, a British architect who was prominent in the modern movement, died on Monday in London.
She was 65 and lived in London.
Miss Smithson worked in partnership with her husband, Peter, for the last 43 years.
Their position in the history of architectural modernism was summed up in The New York Times in June by Herbert Muschamp, who wrote that with the passage of time, "the pioneers of the modern movement (Gropius, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe)" were still active and vocal, but were "joined in the forum by younger colleagues with ideas of their own (Peter and Alison Smithson, Louis Kahn, Aldo van Eyck)."

Her father is the president and chief executive of the LVI Environmental Services Group, an asbestos-removal company in New York.


Chavez Holds Glove-Fest for Fans
With the Hudson River as a backdrop and chants of "Meh-ee-co" as a rhythm section, Julio Cesar Chavez pounded four sparring partners for 40 minutes yesterday, seemingly unaffected by the bright sun and clearly energized by adoring fans.
Chavez, the Mexican fighter who has won five titles and is the World Boxing Council junior-welterweight champion, was as comfortable in front of a microphone as he was doing battle in grueling four-minute rounds.


U.S. Relay Teams Romp to Three Titles
The United States won the men's 400-meter relay tonight with a comb sticking out of the leadoff man's hair.
It won the men's 1,600-meter relay with a world record polished off by the fastest 400 meters ever run.
It won the woman's 1,600-meter relay easily and lost the women's 400-meter relay to Russia by an inch, maybe less.
Noureddine Morceli of Algeria won the men's 1,500 meters and Javier Sotomayor of Cuba the men's high jump, reaffirming their status as world-record holders.
A Chinese, Liu Dong, won the women's 1,500 meters, giving her nation a sweep of the three longest races for women.


Don't Look for the Elderly in Nursing Homes
To the Editor:
When you think the whole world is small, like the community of a nursing home, then you think the ills of old age are large.
Tracy Kidder falls into that trap in "The Myth of Successful Aging" (Op-Ed, Aug. 10), his compassionate but myopic portrayal of aging in America.
Mr.
Kidder bases his observations on really old people, whom he interviewed in a nursing home.
To look there for "successful aging" -- or, more specifically, "ideal" aging, as Mr.
Kidder sees it, is like spending a year in a children's hospital and asking, "What's this myth about healthy, active kids?"


Market Place; Luby's Cafeterias now serves up some interest from investors.
IT is pretty difficult to find a more unassuming company than Luby's Cafeterias Inc., a San Antonio-based chain of 162 low-priced cafeterias that dot the Southwest.
The 45-year-old company is known for conservative management and relatively healthy profit margins resulting from strict cost containment.
But its core customers are, well, mature.
The price of its average meal is a modest $5, and earnings over the last five years have been relatively flat.
Lately, however, Luby's stock has been hitting new highs, as some analysts predict that a turnaround is at hand.


Editors' Note
An article yesterday about Vincent W. Foster Jr., the deputy White House counsel who killed himself on July 20, was accompanied by a chart headed "Key Events in Mr. Foster's Last Months." The chart listed, as separate events, four editorials in The Wall Street Journal that were critical of Mr.
Foster.


Topics of The Times; Passing for White in Hollywood
Remember those grinning black jockeys that once decorated lawns and driveways?
As symbols of racism, the statues have largely disappeared.
In a northeastern suburb, a few that remained were stolen and returned with their faces painted white, courtesy of a mysterious outfit called the Jockey Liberation Army.
That prank came to mind recently when The Times interviewed the African-American actor Forest Whitaker, who received critical acclaim for his portrayal of a British soldier in "The Crying Game" and made his directing debut over the weekend in "Strapped," an urban drama made for television.


Junk Bond Sales Surge As Interest Rates Fall
Sales of junk, or high yield, bonds -- those below investment grade -- have smashed last year's record sales less than eight months into 1993.
And analysts and junk bond portfolio managers said that they expected the surge to continue.
So far this year, new issues of junk bonds have totaled $37.4 billion in the public market, compared with $37.3 billion last year.
And when a new wave of private placements of these low-grade corporate debt instruments is added, the total for the year is already about $48 billion, according to the Duff &amp; Phelps/MCM Investment Research Company.

New Guidelines for S.&amp; L.'s Require Extra Capital
Federal regulators expect to issue new rules this week requiring savings and loan associations to maintain extra capital to keep them from going broke when interest rates shift unpredictably, according to Administration officials.
The rules are among the most important regulations called for by Congress in response to the costly wave of bankruptcies in the 1980's, when many savings and loans found themselves paying higher interest on deposits than they received for mortgages and other loans.
The ensuing crisis has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.


For Its Ease and Excitement, Retirees Return to New York
Edith Markson stumbled and crash-landed on the sidewalk in Greenwich Village shortly after her return to New York more than a year ago.
The badly injured 80-year-old woman was spotted by two homeless men, one of whom swooped her in his arms and majestically carried her one block to a nearby medical laboratory.
Even in old age, with a mending broken hip and a metal valve in her ailing heart, Mrs.
Markson is surprised at how uplifting New York City can be.
Coaxed back here from San Francisco by anxious relatives who wanted to keep an eye on her, she has found that the city has much to offer an "old lady" like herself.


Review/Performance Art; Macho Woman Parodies A Man of Pop Anthems
When Neil Diamond released his popular concert album "Hot August Night" 21 years ago, who would have foreseen that two decades later a self-proclaimed "all-American Jewish lesbian folk singer" would dress up like Mr.
Diamond and parody his macho style to the delight of a New York avant-garde audience?
That is exactly what Phranc (pronounced frank), a thirtysomething folk singer who has released three albums on Island Records, is doing at Dance Theater Workshop in her show "Hot August Phranc." Wearing a man's wig and a glittering silver shirt unbuttoned to reveal a forest of fake chest hair, Phranc offers a brilliantly funny impersonation of the singer whom she calls "The Great One" (Mr. Diamond's name is never actually mentioned).


Starting the Climb -- A periodic look at summer interns; Career Preview Also Works As Mirror for the Job Hunter
As the time to return to classes fast approaches, summer interns, seasoned by two or three months of working at jobs in New York, share two realizations: it's a tough world out there, but they are a step ahead of the game.
"A job isn't going to fall in your lap," said Brett Grossman, an intern with the Avrett, Free &amp; Ginsberg advertising firm.
"You're going to have to work on it, and you get a lot of rejection."


David Fleay, 85, Whose Specialty Was the Platypus
David Fleay, an Australian zoologist who was a specialist on the strange Australian animal the platypus, has died in Brisbane, Australia, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported last week.
He was 86.
Mr.
Fleay was for some years the director of the Healesville Wildlife Sanctuary in Victoria State in southeastern Australia.
In that capacity, he became a celebrity in New York in 1947 by delivering three platypuses to the Bronx Zoo, which had not had once since 1922.


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS No. 1 With Racquet: Courier Solves Becker Jim Courier, making the most of a powerful forehand and an outdoor court, won the United States Hard Courts title yesterday in Indianapolis, beating Boris Becker, 7-5, 6-3, for his first victory over the German star.
Courier, who officially reclaims the No. 1 ranking in the world today, had lost six previous matches to Becker, the past five indoors.
This was Courier's fifth tournament victory of the year, carrying a prize of $152,000.
Becker was playing in a title match for the first time since he defeated Sergi Bruguera on Feb. 14 in Milan, Italy.
He had won this tournament twice and was in the final for the fourth time.
Courier didn't lose a set and lost only two of his 46 service games during the tournament.
He lost only 20 points on his serve yesterday and only 8 came on his first serve. (AP)


Mickelson Birdie Binge Quells Doubters
Playing with the smooth power and velvety touch that have marked him for greatness, left-handed Phil Mickelson blew away the competition today to win the International.
Under the modified Stableford scoring system in which eagles are worth 5 points, birdies 2, pars zero, bogeys minus 1 and double bogey or worse minus 3, Mickelson put up 16 points today for a four-round total of 45 points, 8 better than Mark Calcavecchia.

Jets' Passing, Not Quite; But the Running, Oh, Yes
The Jets have played three preseason games, and lost three, and several things about their offense stand out: The passing game is limping along, the running game is going to be dangerous and the offensive line appears to be back on track after a penalty-plagued 1992 season.
The Jets' running backs averaged 4.1 yards per carry in Saturday night's 14-13 loss to the Giants, and the starting offensive line controlled the line of scrimmage.
Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason was sacked just once in two and a half quarters of play.
Heading into their final preseason game, in Washington on Friday, the Jets are averaging 4.7 yards per carry.
Meanwhile, Esiason, who threw 7 of his 14 completions to wide receivers Saturday night, is trying to get the wideouts involved.
"Last night, on a couple of plays, I'm thinking a guy is going one way and he's going another," said Esiason, who was 12 for 24 over all for 129 yards but no touchdowns.
"It's just a matter of seeing the reads and learning the reads and getting comfortable with one another. Hopefully, as time goes on we'll all be able to do it. I'm talking about tight ends and wide receivers down the field. We have to have a real feel for each other." Thomas Coming Around
At the same time, the running backs and offensive linemen are getting a good feel for slamming into defenders and making plays.
Johnny Johnson and Blair Thomas, who are competing for the starting running-back job, are averaging 5 yards a carry.
Adrian Murrell, a rookie, is averaging 6.8 yards.

Brazil's Outrage Intensifies As Toll in Massacre Hits 73
As outrage mounted over the massacre of 73 Indians by gold miners, President Itamar Franco today called a meeting of the National Defense Council for Monday to enlist the help of the military in hunting down the killers.
The council, made up of civilian and military officials, advises the President on national security.
The military has been hostile to Indian rights, but public calls for justice have been growing since Saturday, when the death toll in an attack on Yanomami Indians on Aug. 15 roughly doubled, to 73, making it the largest massacre of Indians in Brazil in this century.

Double Sword For President
For months it was a sleeper issue in the health care debate.
But last week, after President Clinton's initial sales pitch for his plan-in-progress, his proposal that all employers be required to pay for health coverage emerged as one of the most fiercely contested aspects.
The employer mandate, as it is known, presents Mr.
Clinton with a dilemma.
This President certainly does not want to harm the hundreds of thousands of small-business owners who say, with backing from economists, that the proposal would cause job losses and bankruptcies.
And he hardly wants to hand the Republicans a convenient club for attacking his proposals.


Wireless Communication
The New York metropolitan area is now the country's second largest cellular-phone market, with about 678,160 subscribers, more than three times the number in 1989.
And experts see even more growth, partly as a result of recent moves to accommodate the increase in such traffic.
Last year an additional area code was created in Manhattan to handle a huge rise in cellular phones and pagers, and in recent weeks the Port Authority said it was considering a plan to equip the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels with antennas to allow the use of the phones.
Experts expect to see similar rises in portable fax machines and lap-top computer modems.

Star TV Extends Murdoch's Reach
Rupert Murdoch, the man who brought "The Simpsons" to an American television audience and satellite television to much of Britain, is on the verge of bringing both to tens of millions of viewers in Asia.
With his $525 million takeover last month of Star TV, Asia's pioneer satellite television service, Mr.
Murdoch has bought himself at least the potential of reaching two-thirds of the world's population.
And as a result, he is now close to creating the first truly global television empire.


NASA Loses Communication With Mars Observer
An abrupt, inexplicable loss of communications with the Mars Observer spacecraft, just before it was to orbit the planet tomorrow, has threatened the prospects of success for the nation's first mission to Mars in 17 years.
Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said yesterday that the $400 million spacecraft failed to respond to messages radioed by ground controllers on Saturday night.
Further efforts to communicate, made every 20 minutes since then, have been met with nothing but silence.

Sea Hero's Course Is Not Charted
MacKenzie Miller stood outside Sea Hero's stall in Barn 80 this morning, fed carrots to the horse who won the $1 million Travers Stakes and said he had no idea what route they would take to the Breeders' Cup and the honors beyond.
Sea Hero munched the carrots with the assurance of a horse who had just been anointed the leader pro tem of the 3-year-old division of racing.
He got there by winning just two races this year, but they were blockbusters: the Kentucky Derby on May 1 and the Travers Stakes more than three months later.


Chief Justice Buell A. Nesbett, 83; Headed Alaska's Supreme Court
Buell A. Nesbett, who headed the Alaska Supreme Court immediately after statehood and directed the start-up of the new state's judiciary, died Tuesday at a daughter's home in Anchorage.
He was 83 and moved back to Anchorage in June after living in retirement near San Diego.
The cause was leukemia, The Associated Press reported.


Navy Listening System Opening World of Whales
It is hard to track the blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus, at up to 170 tons the ocean's largest creature, which has almost been killed off by commercial whaling and is now listed as an endangered species.
Attaching radio beacons to the behemoth is difficult, and visual sightings are too sporadic to give real insight into its behavior.
So biologists were delighted early this year when, with the help of the Navy, they were able to track a particular blue whale for 43 days, doing nothing more intrusive than monitoring its sounds.
The feat was possible because of the Navy's formerly top-secret system of underwater listening devices spanning the oceans.

To most people the analogy would be far-fetched, but at a conference of central bankers at this Rocky Mountain resort, the bankers often compared themselves to generals waging war.
The reason offered is that those who forge monetary policy, like those who wage war, have to grapple with an unending torrent of chance and change.


Talk of a Nuclear Dump Again Splits a Community
For three decades, things nuclear have preoccupied this sparsely settled town of rolling hills and dairy farms 35 miles south of Buffalo.
First there was a grandiose plan for an industrial park for the nuclear power industry.
Then came a factory that recycled used reactor fuel, whose legacy has been a $1.39 billion cleanup.
And two years ago, the town's main hamlet, West Valley, was torn by debate over its offer to become the home of a low-level nuclear waste dump.


Topics of The Times; Men in Uniform
On one day of last month's Big Heat, a New Yorker who was at the time happily lazing in an air-conditioned room finally faced an unpleasant fact.
She could not put off going to the post office any longer.
In short, she had to brave the inferno -- where once again she was reminded that when it comes to heat waves, female is better.
She wasn't wearing very much.
Neither were the other women plodding along 43d Street.
But except for people like Marky Mark, whose pants were puddled around his ankles (he was on a billboard, selling underwear) and guys who figured they didn't have to dress up to unload trucks or push dollies, the men were up to their ears in wardrobe.


Microsoft Confronts Its Success
In seizing the mantle of computer industry leadership from I.B.M., the Microsoft Corporation is earning the headaches of power as well as the influence.
The extent of the software publisher's legal problems became clearer on Friday.
Shortly after the Federal Trade Commission ended a 38-month investigation into Microsoft's business practices, the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department said that it would pursue its own inquiry.


Conquering the Rift on Puerto Rico; Mainland Residents Stung by Exclusion From Vote on Island
For many years Puerto Rico's leaders paid but passing attention to people of Puerto Rican descent living on the mainland, making a few courtesy calls and campaign stops in the Northeast.

U.S. Cavalry for Soviet Borders?
A lively controversy rages inside and outside the Clinton Administration over what role America should play in the messy military conflicts now igniting the periphery of the former Soviet Union.
Several of these conflicts directly involve Russian troops.
Next month the Administration plans to outline its formal policy as part of the guidelines it has promised on contributing U.S. military forces to future United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Already Washington has assigned a senior diplomat to lead a high-profile American drive to achieve negotiated solutions to these conflicts.


The Talk of Hollywood; Movers and Shakers Shaken Up By a Move
Loyalty is not exactly embedded in the local code of conduct.

It's a Question of Judgment, Not Zeal
HE still does not get it.
Philip R. Michael was forced to resign as the New York City's Budget Director last Thursday after investigators concluded that he had shown favoritism toward a company trying to win a city contract.
Mr.
Michael maintains that he did nothing improper, and he said in his resignation letter that he was stepping down only because "some may think that the report reduces my effectiveness."
But this is what the Department of Investigation reported finding in its five-month inquiry: Mr.
Michael met repeatedly with a company that was pursuing a lucrative city contract, and in a crucial meeting in November 1990, in front of the company's executives, he pressured the Transportation Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio, to give the company a small, related contract.
Mr.
Michael said that if Mr.
Riccio went along, he would ease budget cuts for Mr.
Riccio's department.


CRACKDOWN FAILS TO STEM SMUGGLING OF CHINESE TO U.S.
Undeterred by the fate of their countrymen who died trying to swim ashore from a freighter stranded off the Rockaway Peninsula in June, or by a crackdown ordered by President Clinton soon afterward, growing numbers of illegal Chinese immigrants are being smuggled into the United States, immigration officials and lawyers say.
As law-enforcement authorities have focused their attention on stopping more boats from landing, many smugglers and their human cargo have turned to commercial air flights as their favored means of passage, the officials and lawyers say.


Empire's Problems Suggest Hurdles for Managed Care
As Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield sets off on an ambitious plan to reduce costs by limiting the choice of doctors and medical care for millions of customers, the troubles that have plagued a similar company program suggest how formidable the new task will be.
Empire's existing foray into so-called managed-care plans, the health maintenance organization Healthnet, has lost $115 million over the last six years because, as even Empire officials concede, it was too hastily conceived, often provided poor service and had troubled relationships with its doctors.

Bosnia Chief Won't Urge Parliament to Accept Accord
Bosnia's Muslim President said today that he would not recommend that the republic's Parliament accept a brokered peace plan that would divide this country into three ethnically defined republics.
"I will not recommend that they vote for such a proposal," President Alija Izetbegovic said at a news conference here.
He said his Government would seek changes in a map delineating the proposed borders of republics dominated by Muslims, Serbs and Croats.

Last Call to Arms on the Trade Pact
Just a week after trade ministers from Canada, Mexico and the United States struck labor and environmental deals related to the North American Free Trade Agreement, members of Congress and interest groups from across the nation are choosing sides, rallying grass-roots supporters and churning out press releases.
U.S.A.-Nafta, a coalition of 2,300 businesses that support the pact, sent executives to meet members of Congress in their home districts this week.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. mailed 1,500 letters to state and local union leaders on Friday, telling them that the labor and environmental side agreements would not protect workers.
It assembled for mailing another 700 packages of bumper stickers, balloons, pamphlets, buttons and petitions.
Ross Perot, the Texas businessman and Presidential aspirant, made a swing through New York and Pennsylvania over the weekend, condemning the agreement in speeches as an arrangement to ship American jobs to Mexico.


Review/Television; Brooklyn Then and Now, In Arthur Miller's Eyes
"The American Clock" is Arthur Miller's try at capturing the spirit of the Depression in 90 busy minutes.
Moving from real-life figures to made-up characters (who seem more real) and back and forth between past and present, this fifth offering in the striving if unfulfilling "TNT Screenworks" series is a touch scattered, particularly in its early scenes.
And it never does make a stimulating connection between America today and in the 1930's or between viewers and anyone on the screen.
Easiest to keep track of is the Baumler family, which the stock market crash sends reeling from a fancy apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan to a Brooklyn tenement.
There's Grandpa (Eddie Bracken, with a Jewish accent yet); his son, Moe (John Rubinstein); Moe's wife, Rose (Mary McDonnell), and their son, Lee (Loren Dean).
There's also Lee as an old man (John Randolph), ruminating in the present about his younger self, and there may be some cousins around, too, but it's easy to lose track.

During the month of August and especially over the last weekend, the hotel has been celebrating the centennial of Dorothy Parker, who was one of the Round Table's most famous members.
People were singing songs to her memory and recalling the life she shared at the Algonquin with the likes of H. L. Mencken, Booth Tarkington, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Thurber, Robert Benchley, Ring Lardner, Heywood Broun, Robert E. Sherwood, Edna Ferber, Alexander Woollcott, George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly.

Biology Doesn't Make the Parent
It's no secret that many children would be healthier and happier with adoptive parents than with the parents that nature dealt them.
That's especially true of children who remain in abusive homes because the law blindly favors biological parents.
It's also true of children who languish for years in foster homes because of parents who can't or won't care for them but refuse to relinquish custody rights.
Fourteen-year-old Kimberly Mays fits neither description, but her court victory this week could eventually help children who do.
Kimberly has been the object of an angry custody battle between the man who raised her and her biological parents, with whom she has never lived.
This week a Florida judge ruled that the teen-ager can remain with the only father she's ever known and that her biological parents have "no legal claim" on her.


Headless Body in Suitcase
A large suitcase containing the headless remains of a man was found on the sidewalk of a Brooklyn intersection early yesterday morning.
The body, which was discovered at 4:16 A.M. near an abandoned lot at St.
Mark's and Howard Avenues in Bedford-Stuyvesant, appeared to be that of a white or Hispanic man, said a police spokesman, Sgt.
Anthony Barlanti.
An anonymous person called the police to report seeing a suitcase with feet sticking out of it, he said.
When officers arrived, they found the body intact, except for the head, in a gray suitcase.
The head was not found.
Sergeant Barlanti said the case did not appear to be connected to the killings of five gay men whose bodies were found dismembered in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania over the last two years.


White House Ad Complaint
The New York University School of Continuing Education said it would stop running newspaper advertisements displaying the Presidential seal after the White House complained.
The ads, by Biederman, Kelly &amp; Shaffer in New York, have appeared in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.
They show a stethoscope resting on a loose-leaf notebook bearing the seal, under a headline, "The Clinton health care reforms: What's the prognosis for your career?"


U.S.-Saudi Deals in 90's Shifting Away From Cash Toward Credit
Saudi Arabia's financial decline, the consequence of a decade in which the country lived beyond its means, is fundamentally reshaping the relationship between Riyadh and Washington.
When the Saudis were flush with so-called petrodollars, they bought whatever they could from the United States -- warplanes, missiles, jetliners.
The purchases generated tens of thousands of jobs for American military and aerospace workers.


This Week's Treasury Sales Offer Only Bills and Notes
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week is confined to the bills and notes markets, beginning with today's regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills.
On Tuesday, the Government will auction two-year notes followed by Wednesday's 5-year notes auction.
According to traders, by the close of the New York cash market on Friday, the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 2.97 percent, and on the six-month bill, 3.09 percent.
In when-issued trading, the two-year note was being offered at a rate to yield 3.96 percent and the five-year note at a rate to yield 4.98 percent.


Killing of 9 Israeli Soldiers Sets Off Bitter Dispute
The deaths last week of nine Israeli soldiers in Lebanon touched off a bitter dispute over the weekend after right-wing opposition figures accused army commanders of playing politics and the Government of signaling to Islamic militants that "it was permissible" to kill Israeli troops.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who is also Defense Minister, was reported to be outraged by the criticism.
The accusations included a remark by his predecessor, Yitzhak Shamir, that army commanders were "dedicating themselves to politics" and "follow like blind men after those who are leading us to a national disaster."


British Army's Job in Bosnia: To Keep Risky Lifeline Open
The face-off on a narrow dirt road above this old Bosnian town said it all.

If the Shoe Doesn't Fit, Don't Win
The men's 10,000-meter final in the world outdoor track and field championships today proved that a man with two shoes can beat a man with one.
The theory was tested when Moses Tanui of Kenya, the 28-year-old defending champion, was leading with one 400-meter lap remaining.
Then Haile Gebresilasie of Ethiopia ran up on his heels, as he often did in the race, and Tanui's left shoe became loose and then half off.


Unmaking the G.O.P. Court Legacy
Although he started it slowly, President Clinton has begun his campaign to reshape the Federal judiciary, moving the courts away from the resolutely conservative direction of the last 12 years of Republican control of the White House.
In addition to an ideological shift, White House officials said, the make-over now under way will emphasize a change in demographics as a large number of women and several minority candidates are named to the bench.


Abu Dhabi Repayment
A Federal judge has ordered the trustee for First American Bankshares Inc. to expeditiously address the issue of repaying Abu Dhabi the $190 million the emirate invested in the Washington bank.
The main operations of First American, which had been secretly controlled by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, were sold recently to the First Union Corporation for $453 million.


Cementing Stardom, Medvedev Wins Volvo
He says he not only performs a slam dunk, but can do a maneuver he calls a "380" beneath the basket.
He wants to use his tennis earnings to import his favorite brand of soda, Coke, to his native Russia, which he claims is sadly overstocked with Pepsi.
Fanatical about signing autographs, he usually travels with a stack of signed photos, just in case he runs into anybody prescient enough to realize they've just met the next great prodigy of men's tennis.
And he says that once he reaches a final, he'll stop at nothing, cheating excepted, to win it.
Precocious in all respects, from the firepower of his racquet to the poise of his repartee, 18-year-old Andrei Medvedev used the final of the Volvo International today to capture his first hard-court title after playing just 18 professional matches on the surface that makes his legs "hurt" and his feet "burn."


Yardsticks Almost Vanish As Science Seeks Precision
Two centuries ago even common folk could grasp the metric system of measurement.
Based on the distance between one of the earth's poles and the Equator and on some simple properties of ordinary water, the metric system that emerged from the French Revolution was simplicity itself: self-consistent, comprehensible and decimally tidy.
But with the growing demands of science, the metric system has been gradually shorn of nearly all its formerly simple definitions.
In the next several years, even the humble kilogram, the last metric unit of measurement based on an object made by human beings, may be redefined in the daunting language of quantum mechanics.
Never a Horse in Horsepower
The reason for the assault on the system created in the Age of Reason is an ever-increasing need for precision, say the scientists who are redefining the world's measurement standards.
Where once a bar of corrosion-proof metal seemed able to stand as an immutable reference weight, an invisible mote of microscopic dust or a straying atom can now degrade its value as a standard.


Reeves Zings Howard, Who Raises the Ante
Dan Reeves, known as one of the most blunt coaches in professional football, didn't hesitate today to fire back at nose tackle Erik Howard, who complained Saturday night of both a lack of playing time and a lack of communication from the coaching staff.
In speaking directly about Howard, Reeves became entangled in what can only be described as his first controversy as the Giants' head coach.
And the controversy wasn't put to rest by Reeves's comments, in which he criticized the veteran lineman for going to the news media with his problems instead of going to the coach.


Tatiana Troyanos Is Dead at 54; Mezzo Star of Diverse Repertory
Tatiana Troyanos, an American mezzo-soprano whose enormous repertory covered the full range of operatic history, from Monteverdi to Philip Glass, died on Saturday evening at Lenox Hill Hospital.

Her manager, Janice Mayer at Columbia Artists, said the cause was cancer.


Comedians' Copyright Suit Is No Joke
When 120 stand-up comedians are gathered together, there should be nonstop laughter.
But two whose work appears on 12 audiocassettes bearing the name of the Improv comedy club are not smiling.
Robert Schimmel and Carol Siskind say their stand-up work at the Improv on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, the flagship of a chain of 15 comedy clubs, was taped without their knowledge or consent and then sold to Score Productions, an Atlanta company, which packaged the material in two series of six tapes each, "Live From the Improv" and "Comedy After Hours."

Arles Journal; Bull Fever Is Back, and Foes See Red
Hubert Yonnet breeds bulls and horses on the Camargue's wild marshlands, where the Rhone meets the Mediterranean.
Cowboys ride his ranch, birds squawk overhead and change comes with the cadence of the seasons.
But the steady life on the Yonnet ranch is now affected by a turnabout of tastes in this earthy part of southern France.
The tradition of bullfighting, which had diminished to a trickle, is coming back with vigor.
It has already increased the demand for Yonnet bulls, and for several seasons filled this region's arenas with roaring spectators.


Inching Toward Metric System
In the United States, which, with Burma and Liberia, is still holding out against the metric system, revisions of the system of measurements do not loom large in public consciousness.
Despite an act signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 that specifies the metric system as the preferred system of measurement for trade and commerce in the United States, road signs are still in miles, people still buy fish by the pound and swelter in 100-degree Fahrenheit heat.


Patents; An energy clock to tell homeowners when to turn up or turn down the electricity.
IF Norman E. Chasek's idea for monitoring electricity comes to full fruition, an energy clock will hang in every American home.
Depending upon how much community-wide demand is being put on a household's electrical utility at any given time, green or red lights will light up.
"Three greens would mean now is a good time to use lots of electricity," Mr.
Chasek said.
"Three reds would mean it's time to turn off the air- conditioner."


Japan's New Prime Minister Vows Major Changes in Election System
Japan's new Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, today pledged a fundamental reshaping of what he described as the corrupt electoral system and stronger efforts to reduce Japan's yawning trade surpluses.
At least in terms of oratory, Mr.
Hosokawa's first policy address offered a remarkable shift from the statements of the conservative governments of the postwar era.
He criticized Japan's narrow-minded pursuit of economic gain and the collusive institutions that excluded outsiders and worked against the interests of Japanese consumers.


Are We Willing to Pay Price in Somalia?
To the Editor:
"Back to Basics in Somalia" (editorial, Aug. 10) concludes that the United States should get back to its basic "peacekeeping mission" in that East African country.
This is at best naive, as Ronald Reagan may have learned when he folded his tents after having lost more than 300 marines in one blast in Lebanon.


Clinton and His Ties to the Influential Saudis
The conventional wisdom in Washington in the election last year was that George Bush was the great friend of Saudi Arabia -- after all, he went to war to defend the kingdom.

Nicaraguan Rightists Release 20 After Leftists Take 9 New Captives
A group of right-wing former rebels was reported tonight to have released 20 of the 41 hostages they were holding in a remote mountain area, but a band of leftist ex-soldiers continued to hold the country's Vice President and other conservative politicians here in the capital after taking additional captives.
Late this evening, a Managua radio station broadcast a statement by an official of the Organization of American States saying the former contra rebels had released 20 hostages in the northwestern village of Quilali.
But the freed captives were not expected to reach here until tomorrow.

Essay; The Fourth Man
The political polls on both sides of the Atlantic may be accurate, but the judgment we draw from them is all wrong.

Dead Heat: Krone and Smith Vie For Title
The fifth and final week of the Saratoga racing season opened today with booming betting handles, with star horses like Devil His Due and Dehere preparing for their next performances and with Julie Krone and Mike Smith riding toward a photo finish for the jockey championship.
If Krone wins, she will add the most elusive of riding titles to her record, which already includes those at Belmont Park, Monmouth Park, Atlantic City, the Meadowlands and Gulfstream Park in Florida.
Two years ago, she and Smith rode to another photo finish for the Saratoga title, which Smith won by one race.
It was the closest that any woman had come to capturing the crown at Saratoga.


Arleen Auger Memorial
A memorial service for the soprano Arleen Auger will be held on Monday at 10 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.

More G.I.'s Going to Somalia
In a move to increase American firepower in Somalia, the Clinton Administration has ordered about 400 elite Army troops to the war-ravaged African nation, Pentagon officials said tonight.
The deployment of the additional Army Rangers, who could be sent as soon as Tuesday, comes a day after six American soldiers were wounded in an explosion in Mogadishu, the Somali capital.
It was the third explosion aimed at United States forces since four Americans were killed on Aug. 8.


Of Memories and Memory and Yet More Memory
BOB K., an electrician, was in the dark.
He had received a used computer in barter for his services and called for advice.
"It has 40 megabytes of memory," he said, revealing that he is one of many novice computer users who are understandably confused by the difference between system memory and storage memory.
Personal computers can have several types of memory, each of which performs a separate function.
Random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), video RAM (VRAM) and storage memory are the most common memories a user will encounter these days.


Editorial Notebook; Revisiting Monticello
I had to drive home from a family vacation in North Carolina to New York.
I didn't have much time, but I was tempted to sidetrack a bit.
There was a historic exhibition on at Monticello.
In honor of the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth, the house is now filled, as never since his death, with the objects he collected and displayed there.
On loan from museums and private collectors, most of the stuff will have to be returned after the end of the year.
This might never happen again in our lifetimes.
I pointed the car northwest and arrived late and (bad planning) low on cash.
I spent our last $20 for the admission, and the kids weren't happy.
They were hungry.
I'd refused to stop for lunch.


Marvin Fisher Is Dead; Pop Composer Was 76
Marvin Fisher, who composed "When Sunny Gets Blue," "Destination Moon" and other songs, died on Saturday at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, L.I.
He was 76 and lived in Southampton.

Rival Hostage-Takers in Nicaragua Stand Firm
A hostage crisis that has deepened Nicaragua's sense of political paralysis dragged on today as rightist former rebels in a northern village and leftist former soldiers here in the capital both refused to free most of the dozens of politicians and others they seized last week.
The tensions appeared to ease somewhat after both groups met with representatives of a special mediation panel and released some of their hostages.
This afternoon, the country's Roman Catholic Primate, Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo, also agreed to the mediators' request that he intervene to help resolve the situation.


Harold Wright; Clarinetist, 65
Harold Wright, principal clarinetist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Marlboro, Vt.
He was 65 and also had a home in Newtonville, Mass.
A spokeswoman for the orchestra said the cause was a heart attack.


Serious About Vacation, Clinton Keeps It Casual
"Whoa, mama, stay up!"
This was the President of the United States speaking, and he was addressing a pockmarked white ball that he had sent sailing on a long drive toward the right.
After taking a similar golf shot on his first Presidential vacation four years ago, George Bush said, "Oh, golly darn, get up there!" Exact Opposites
But Mr.
Clinton has been demonstrating a casual golfing style that is almost the exact opposite of the frenetic pace Mr.
Bush set on his vacations.


Female Gerbil Born With Males Is Found To Be Begetter of Sons
FOR many a young girl, a childhood spent with brothers has moments of fear and exasperation.
Yet the most overbearing human brothers cannot begin to compare with Mongolian gerbils, creatures that can utterly change the fate of their sisters before any of them have even been born.
Scientists studying the blond, fuzzy-tailed rodents have discovered that when a female fetus matures in the womb with a male fetus on either side of her, the impact of all those male hormones on her development has a startling consequence: the female grows up and bears litters with a significantly higher proportion of sons than do females who spend their prenatal days sandwiched between two sisters.


Inquiry Finds Many New York Cabdrivers Illegally Snub Riders
A sting by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission found that almost 20 percent of yellow-cab drivers in certain areas refused to take passengers where they wanted to go.
Although it is illegal for drivers to refuse fares, city inspectors found that many cabbies would not go from Manhattan to the other boroughs, apparently either unwilling to return with an empty cab or wary of neighborhoods they considered unsafe.
Other drivers, particularly at hotel cab stands, were unwilling to accept fares for short distances, preferring to wait for a passenger going to an airport.
Anywhere and Everywhere
City rules require drivers to take passengers anywhere in the five boroughs of New York City, to Newark Airport or to Westchester and Nassau Counties.
The 11 exceptions have nothing to do with geography: A driver does not have to go anywhere, for instance, if someone else is already in the car or the taxi is officially off-duty.


Three Miners Released as Search for Suspects Continues in Indian Massacre


Two Old Friends Share Island, but Nothing Else
The last time Bill Clinton was on Martha's Vineyard it was to attend the wedding of a Yale Law School classmate, Lani Guinier.
That was seven years ago, when he was the Governor of Arkansas.
Now he is here again, and she is here with her family, as she is every summer.
This time the two have not seen each other.


Chess
Boris Gelfand has won the International Chess Federation's Interzonal Tournament for world title aspirants that finished in Biel, Switzerland, in early August.
The 25-year-old grandmaster from Minsk, Belarus, scored 9-4 in the 73-player Swiss-system competition.
This was the second consecutive time that Gelfand had achieved top honors in an Interzonal; in Manila, 1990, he shared first prize with Vasily Ivanchuk of Ukraine.
Eight grandmasters tied for second place with 8 1/2-4 1/2: Paul Van der Sterren of the Netherlands, Gata Kamsky of Brooklyn, Michael Adams of England, Leonid Yudasin of Israel, Joel Lautier of France and Aleksandr Khalifman, Valery Salov and Vladimir Kramnik, all of Russia.
As a result, they, along with Gelfand and the Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand, who tallied 8-5 and got preference on tiebreak points over five other players, have qualified for the elimination matches in Wijk-aan-Zee, the Netherlands, in January, which will produce the next challenger for the world championship.

The General Motors Corporation declined yesterday to confirm reports in trade publications that it was accelerating plans to consolidate the media services on its $1.4 billion advertising accounts.
"We don't have any announcement to make at this point," said John Maciarz, a G.M. spokesman in Detroit.
He repeated his statement when asked to discuss the reports in Adweek and Mediaweek that G.M. would follow the Chrysler Corporation by forming a stand-alone subsidiary to handle media services that would be staffed by executives from its various agencies.


Stocks Down on a Day of Lowered Volume

A listless bond market helped to put pressure on stock prices and renewed some concern over higher interest rates and their potential impact on corporate profits.


Timberland
Shares of Timberland, a maker of outdoor footwear now in great demand, reached a 52-week high yesterday despite Merrill Lynch's reduction Friday of its intermediate-term rating to "neutral" from "above average." The brokerage said its change reflected only the rapid run-up of Timberland shares, which have nearly doubled since July.


Off-Duty Officer Is Suspect in Woman's Death
A New York City police officer faces charges of second-degree murder in the shooting death of a young woman found yesterday at his parents' Brooklyn home.
The officer, Michael Garcia, 26, who is assigned to the 71st Precinct in Crown Heights, was arrested yesterday morning.
Officer Garcia was also charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance, which the police believe is cocaine.


Tennis Center Plan Challenged in Council
Some City Council members yesterday criticized a Dinkins administration proposal to expand the National Tennis Center in Queens as too favorable to the center.
They also inquired about the role in negotiations of a senior official, Ellen Baer, who has close ties to a lobbyist for the United States Tennis Association.
But administration officials said the 99-year-lease agreement reached with the association, which sponsors the United States Open, was one of the best deals in the nation between a city and a major sports organization.


Kings Re-sign a Tough Guy, Rychel
Left wing WARREN RYCHEL, one of the most physical players in the Los Angeles Kings' drive to the Stanley Cup finals last season, signed a three-year contract with the club.
Salary terms for Rychel, a free agent after last season, were not released yesterday.
The 6-foot, 202-pounder scored just 6 goals and 7 assists in 70 regular-season games in 1992-93, but in 23 games of the Stanley Cup playoffs he matched those scoring totals.


Berlin Journal; Germany Warms Up to 'a Fossil of the Cold War'
For decades Rainer Hildebrandt was one of Germany's quintessential outsiders, reviled on both sides of the Berlin wall.
The East German Government regularly denounced him as a "criminal provocateur," and politicians in his native western Germany dismissed him as a naive and cantankerous meddler.
At various times, the authorities on both sides of the wall issued warrants for his arrest.

Toshiba Sale to East Germany Under Inquiry
The authorities here are looking into a report that Toshiba Corporation, which was involved in the sale of equipment to the Soviet Union in the 1980's, might have also illegally provided advanced semiconductor technology to East Germany.

Courthouse Melee Injures Court Officers in Brooklyn
Violence erupted in a Brooklyn courthouse yesterday when supporters of a man awaiting sentencing on manslaughter charges clashed with friends and relatives of the man he killed.
Two people said they were slashed with a razor blade wielded by the defendant, and up to a dozen court officers were injured in the ensuing fracas.
Authorities said some 30 to 40 court officers arrived to quell the melee, which involved about 40 other people, evenly divided between friends and relatives of the victim and of the defendant.
The court officers described a scene of general bedlam, with several skirmishes occurring in the hallway.
Afterward, large blotches of blood stained the floor and a bench.

Old Friend Goes: Giants Drop Baker After Poorly Run Pattern
The first sign of trouble for wide receiver Stephen Baker came when he showed up in camp this year out of shape and, on the first day of practice, nearly threw up after running wind sprints.
Baker was never able to regain his composure, and today the six-year veteran who had a touchdown reception in the 1991 Super Bowl was cut by the Giants.
It wasn't really a big surprise.
For one thing, Baker didn't participate in the team's off-season conditioning program.
In addition, Baker, who turns 29 next week, led all receivers in dropped balls during practice sessions and didn't play a single down in Saturday night's victory over the Jets.
And then there was the fact that in a time when teams are watching every penny because a salary cap is approaching, Baker was set to make $650,000 this year, along with a $25,000 roster bonus.


At Sarajevo Swimming Hole, Life Thrives in War's Shadow
In peacetime, the swimming hole here might be a scene from Mark Twain.
Children wade and skip stones on hot summer days.
Pubescent boys do cannonballs and jackknives from an embankment to impress Becky Thatchers.
Old men and women near the mouth of a cave gaze down on it all.
But this is Sarajevo, not Hannibal, and people here are still woefully short of water, shelter, food and other essentials deep into the second year of a Serbian siege.
The human waste piled below sewers opening onto the Miljacka River's stoney bank and the dead rat floating in the water nearby do not seem to bother those who have come to swim, to bathe themselves and their babies and to wash their clothes and carpets.
A Lament for Running Water
"It's the only safe place to swim," said Zuhdija, a 36-year-old off-duty Bosnian Army soldier.
Looking out at a short stretch of the river shielded from Serbian howitzers by a rocky bluff, he lamented the days when Sarajevans still had running water, public swimming pools and easy access to mountain streams just a few miles outside town.

Blue and Brown Eyes
Q.
When one parent has blue eyes and the other has brown eyes, do their children have blue or brown eyes?


CHRONICLE
In a move that has the cat-and-mouse trappings of an espionage adventure, SALMAN RUSHDIE, who was condemned to death in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran for writing "The Satanic Verses," and AZIZ NESIN, an iconoclastic Turkish newspaper editor and writer, appear to have ended a bitter quarrel.
Mr.
Rushdie, who lives largely in hiding in Britain, had accused Mr.
Nesin of publishing excerpts of "The Satanic Verses" without permission in his newspaper, Aydinlik.
Writing in The Observer, the London newspaper, Mr.
Rushdie said that by publishing excerpts from the controversial book, Mr.
Nesin was partly to blame for the deaths of 37 people killed in a hotel fire in southern Turkey following militant Islamic rioting.
Mr.
Nesin was staying in the hotel at the time of the riot and fire.


A Fatal Case of Rabies, and How It Nearly Went Undetected
RABIES is the deadliest of many infections that can be transmitted from animals to humans, and although the viral disease is epidemic among raccoons and other wildlife in the United States, human cases are rare.
Since 1972, only 32 human cases have been reported in this country.
The latest case was 11-year-old Kelly Ahrendt of Bloomingburg, N.Y., whose death from rabies on July 11 was the first in the state since 1954.
Her case was particularly difficult to detect for two reasons.
First, because she was not known to have been bitten by an animal, her doctors did not suspect rabies.
Second, a flawed autopsy delayed the diagnosis for more than three weeks.

Investigators Question a Man In Rash of Brooklyn Shootings
Investigators seeking a man who killed four people and wounded two others in a series of shootings with a 9-millimeter pistol in Brooklyn were questioning a man last night about the cases, a law-enforcement official said yesterday.
The police declined to call the man a suspect.
But the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that tests had linked a 9-millimeter pistol taken from the man with the shootings, which occurred within about 48 hours on Aug. 12 and 14 within blocks of each other in Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville.
Questioning 'Kevin'
The official also said the man's first name was Kevin, the name that the police revealed yesterday was given by a gunman to a woman he had sexually assaulted moments before the first two shootings early Aug. 12 in what the police believe was a basement crack den.


Jail Uprising Was Not Staged As Alleged, Four Guards Say
Seeking to counter accusations that a hostage-taking incident at the Westchester County Jail last week was rigged, four guards insisted today that the episode had been very real and that they had been held captive by inmates armed with homemade blades.
Last week the Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, said that county police investigators had "received statements" from inmates and corrections officers that the confrontation, which occurred on Sunday Aug. 15, "was a setup," staged with the cooperation of the inmates.


Peer Down and Say Cheese


AIRLINES FIGHTING PASSENGER TAXES USED BY AIRPORTS
A tax imposed at a growing number of airports across the country for projects like noise abatement, security, and new or improved runways and terminals is inspiring a budding revolt -- not among the passengers who pay the tax, but among the airlines that collect it.
The passenger facility charge, as it is formally named, has proved hard to resist for airport authorities.
In the 19 months the tax has been in effect, 130 of the 428 primary airports in the United States -- those with at least 10,000 passengers a year -- have been authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration to impose more than $7.3 billion in taxes.
Thirty-eight more applications are pending.


Judge Scoffs at Defense of Bush on Iraq
A Federal prosecutor said in court today that a Clinton Administration investigation had concluded that there was no conspiracy by President George Bush and senior aides to arm Iraq secretly and then cover up their actions.
But the statement by the prosecutor, John Hogan, a special assistant to Attorney General Janet Reno, was greeted with skepticism bordering on outright disbelief by Federal judge who has presided over the matter for nearly four years.
The judge Marvin H. Shoob of Federal District Court, said such a conclusion was possible only "in never-never land."


MORGAN STANLEY GROUP INC. (N)
Morgan Stanley Group continues to thrive in what may be near-ideal conditions for securities firms.
The company reported yesterday that earnings for the second quarter were up 88 percent from a year earlier, to $224.2 million.

Festive Evening Out Ends in Carjacking Nightmare
An elderly couple's Saturday evening, which began with an ethnic feast at a Stamford church, ended with a violent carjacking as they were robbed, beaten, separated from each other and left bloodied and dazed.

On the back porch were the bloodstained clothes they wore the night of the assault.


AFGHANS JOINING REBELS IN KASHMIR
Hundreds of battle-hardened Afghan rebels have slipped into Jammu and Kashmir, the northern state, and are fighting alongside local Muslim separatists and raising the level of the insurgency against Indian troops, intelligence officials said today.

Review/Fashion; Galanos Has the Last Word for the Fall
James Galanos came East last week to have absolutely the last word on fall fashion.
Ten large metal trunks were filled with the Los Angeles-based designer's 176-piece fall collection.
Prominent in the collection were suits with long jackets, one flaring below a shapely high waistline.
The skirts extended just a few inches below fingertip-length jackets.
There were three different shapes of pants, each cut with varying degrees of fullness.
All of these styles were in the mainstream of the top designers' collections for fall.
Mr.
Galanos showed his designs to retailers as their stores were beginning to fill up with clothes ordered months ago from other fall collections.


Nation's Land of Promise Enters an Era of Limits
Almost from the time modern Americans discovered Southern California, it has been the ultimate symbol of hope, opportunity and escape: hope for the aged looking for a nice climate in which to retire; opportunity for those on the make; sunny escape for the beautiful and the indolent.
But now, as the nation looks to this region for clues to the American future, utopian hopes have turned into cautionary tales.


Collapse of Earliest Known Empire Is Linked to Long, Harsh Drought
UNDER the renowned Sargon and his successors, the Akkadians of Mesopotamia forged the world's first empire more than 4,300 years ago.
They seized control of cities along the Euphrates River and on the fruitful plains to the north, all in what is now Iraq, Syria and parts of southern Turkey.
Then, after only a century of prosperity, the Akkadian empire collapsed abruptly, for reasons that have been lost to history.
The traditional explanation is one of divine retribution.
Angered by the hubris of Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson and most dynamic successor, the gods supposedly unleashed the barbaric Gutians to descend out of the highlands and overwhelm Akkadian towns.
More recent and conventional explanations have put the blame on overpopulation, provincial revolt, nomadic incursions or managerial incompetence, though many scholars despaired of ever identifying the root cause of the collapse.

Review/Music; A Tuneful Inauguration for a New Concert Hall
Attending the opening of a new concert hall has tended to be dreary business in recent decades.
Understandably, the backers are invariably puffed with civic pride over the glittery, fresh-smelling structure, but the sound of the thing is often sorely deficient if not truly dreadful.
So after arriving here on Friday and reading all about the "Heaven of a Hall" proclaimed in a banner headline of The Aspen Times, this interloper slathered on the hype repellent, ingested a stiff dose of critical bile and trudged off to the opening.
The surprise could hardly have been happier.
The 500-seat Joan and Irving Harris Concert Hall, designed by the Aspen architect Harry Teague and constructed by the Aspen Music Festival and School at a cost of $7 million, seems a little gem in the making.
An excellent first impression, at a concert by the Aspen Chamber Symphony on Friday evening, was largely borne out by a varied weekend of listening: to chamber music, solo piano, large orchestra and jazz performed by some high-powered artists on hand for the occasion.
Among them were Pinchas Zukerman, Misha and Cipa Dichter, the soprano Renee Fleming, the jazz guitarist Larry Coryell and Justice Harry A. Blackmun.


Caucasus City Falls to Armenian Forces
The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry acknowledged today that Azerbaijani forces had been forced to withdraw from the crucial city of Fizuli in the face of continued Armenian pressure from the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
The loss of Fizuli, which is south of Karabakh and controls roads into southwestern Azerbaijan, is the most recent setback for the oil-producing former Soviet republic and threatens to send more refugees across the Aras River, the frontier between Azerbaijan and Iran.


Huskies on the Screen Puts ABC on the Spot
The Pac-10 Conference's two-year punishment of Washington's football program isn't all bad: Huskie (or is that husky?) folks can still watch 'em because they weren't banned from appearing on regular-season television although the team cannot collect any regular-season TV money this year or appear in post-season bowl games for two years.
The Pac-10 conceivably could have levied a harsher treatment; earlier this month, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, ruling on violations by Auburn University, banned all TV appearances by its football team for a year.

But many airlines are protesting the tax, fearing that the resulting increase in fares is putting them at a competitive disadvantage.  [ Page A1. ]
An economic upturn caused by lower interest rates has not occurred.
Many economists believe the reasons are the weakened banking system, corporate restructurings and layoffs, weak housing construction and reluctance by businesses and consumers to make financial commitments.

Papers on Kennedy Assassination Are Unsealed, and '63 Is Revisited
Pages from the raw record of a national nightmare, committed to paper, stamped top secret and filed away for 30 years: a 1959 urinalysis of Lee Harvey Oswald; frantic requests for dossiers on the man arrested as John F. Kennedy's assassin; ballistics tests on the mail-order rifle; a scale model of the grassy knoll.
The National Archives' huge cache of Government documents on the assassination of President Kennedy was opened today, offering a treasure trove for conspiracy theorists, a wealth of arcane details for historians and a bottomless pit of memory, loss and mystery for those who recall the President's murder.
Included were 90,000 pages of documents from the Central Intelligence Agency, thousands of Presidential papers, investigative files, photographs and memorandums.
Hearsay, Rumor and Innuendo
The files show how the C.I.A. scrambled in the hours after the assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, to locate dossiers on Oswald (they found 30).
They record a C.I.A. official's fear that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was tailing him as he met with the mobster the C.I.A. had hired to kill Fidel Castro.
They include a thousand shards of evidence, and thousands more of hearsay, rumor, gossip, innuendo and nonsense.

PRO FOOTBALL  Wilson Lays Claim to Saints Job  Wade Wilson boosted his bid for the New Orleans starting quarterback spot last night in the Saints' 20-14 victory over the Chicago Bears at the Superdome.
Wilson, playing a complete half for the first time since the Saints acquired him this summer, completed 13 of 22 passes for 134 yards and a touchdown.
He also threw one interception and led New Orleans to a 10-0 halftime lead.
Quinn Early caught a 30-yard scoring pass from Wilson early in the second quarter and Morten Andersen kicked a 47-yard field goal as time expired in the first half.
Against the 0-3 Bears' first-string defense, the Saints (4-0) had 163 total offensive yards on 32 plays in the first half.
They ran for only 29 yards but Wilson completed passes to eight receivers, including running backs Dalton Hilliard and Derek Brown, and fullback Brad Muster.

The country music industry climbs on the anti-AIDS bandwagon.
IT would be hard to determine which took longer to make serious commitments to fighting AIDS, corporate marketers or the country music industry.

One sign of the growing involvement of the country music industry is "Red Hot and Country," a cassette tape and compact disk to be released in February by the Mercury Nashville label on behalf of the Red Hot Organization, which funnels funds to anti-AIDS programs through popular culture projects.
Participating with country musicians like Mark Chesnutt and Kathy Mattea are the Clairol subsidiary of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and New Woman, the women's monthly published by the K-III Magazine Corporation.

On a rainy night when baseball probably should not have been played and probably should not have been played too well, the weather subsided long enough and the Yankees played just well enough to win.

It took a 10th-inning rally and a ball that rolled about 40 feet in front of the plate to deliver two crucial runs as the Yankees inched to a 6-5 victory over the White Sox.
It also helped that Scott Radinsky fielded Pat Kelly's roller with runners on first and second and whipped it low past first baseman Frank Thomas to allow Bernie Williams and Mike Gallego to scurry home.

"This girl," he said, "can write rings around all of us who consider ourselves as writers."


GLOOM IS GROWING OVER THE OUTCOME OF MISSION TO MARS
After an 11-month, 450-million-mile voyage, the Mars Observer spacecraft should arrive at its destination today, primed to swing into orbit around Mars.
But there has been nothing but silence from the craft since Saturday night, and puzzled flight controllers were becoming more fearful yesterday that the $1 billion mission might be doomed.
Mission officials said there had been one "ray of hope" when engineering studies suggested that a faulty clock aboard the spacecraft could be responsible for the recent loss of communications.
But attempts to switch the craft to a backup clock proved unsuccessful.


Their Coach Is Out But Huskies Carry On
This morning, for the first time in more than 18 years, a University of Washington football team assembled in Husky Stadium without the man in the tower looking down on it.
Don James, the top-winning coach in the history of the Pac-10 Conference, was gone.
He resigned on Sunday in protest of conference sanctions levied against his team.
The empty tower was apt, for in quitting, James left behind a program that may be hollowed-out by a two-year ban on post-season bowl appearances, a 40 percent reduction in scholarships and a one-year loss in television revenue.

Europe Created Its Own Immigration Problem; Safety Net's Pull
To the Editor:
Your front-page articles on Aug. 9 and 10 on immigration and welfare benefits in Europe omit the crucial link: Europe's social security systems make it a perfect target for foreigners who want an easier life.


Seeking Support of Gay Voters, Dinkins Canvasses the Village
In a day of campaigning that underscored his effort to win the support of gay New Yorkers, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday made several stops in Greenwich Village, where he picked up some endorsements and toured a clinic that cares for people with H.I.V.
While in the Village, Mr.
Dinkins demonstrated again that a major weapon in his campaign strategy is to highlight the power of being Mayor.


Croats to Let Convoy Enter Bosnian Town
Croatian military leaders have given the United Nations refugee-relief agency permission to send an aid convoy to about 55,000 hungry Muslims trapped in the eastern part of the city of Mostar, a Bosnian Croat spokesman said today.
Veso Vegar, a spokesman for the Bosnian Croats' militia, told The Associated Press that a United Nations aid convoy would be allowed to enter eastern Mostar on Wednesday.
But United Nations officials here said they had no knowledge of any agreement to allow a convoy to bring food and medicines to the Muslims, some of whom were reported earlier this week to be on the brink of starvation.


FINANCE BRIEFS
Debt  *
Carbide/Graphite Group Inc., Pittsburgh, is offering $115 million of senior notes due in 2003 at 100 to yield 11.50 percent through Bear, Stearns.
Redeemable in five years, the notes are rated B-3 by Moody's Investors Service and B+ by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
*
Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, is offering $300 million of medium-term notes due in 2003 at 100 to yield 6.08 percent through Merrill Lynch.
The issue is callable in three years.


Tax Law Expected to Bring Little Shift in Executive Pay
The Clinton Administration took aim at executives' pay and stock packages in its new tax law.
While the law is likely to lead many companies to make changes in compensation plans, most experts say it probably will not drastically change the way public companies pay their top talent.
The new law is "more symbolic than anything," said Anne Hansen, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a group of 85 large pension funds that has fought for more shareholder influence.
"We applaud it, but we don't want to sign onto it because of the loopholes."


Yanks Savor Deal Outfoxing the Sox
The story is told in the Yankees' clubhouse that before the Yankees played the Chicago White Sox earlier in the season, George Steinbrenner asked -- ordered? -- Buck Showalter not to start both Melido Perez and Bob Wickman in the series.
"It would embarrass my friend Jerry," the owner is quoted as telling the manager.


Reliving Crown Heights Violence; Under Oath, Dinkins Is to Describe Handling of 1991 Clash
In the pale yellow ballroom of Gracie Mansion, under the orders of a Federal judge, Mayor David N. Dinkins will be required to raise his right hand today and under oath relive once again the four days of violence in Crown Heights in 1991.
In many ways the face-off, prompted by a lawsuit filed against the city by Hasidic Jews, is the culmination of two years of passions, grudges and misunderstandings that have festered between the Dinkins administration and the Crown Heights Hasidim, some of whose leaders endorsed him in 1989 over his Republican-Liberal opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani.


Patterns
Hip-Hop Style Takes Charge
Like the rap music that inspired them, some of the harder-edge hip-hop clothing companies are facing censorship in their own industry.
And it's forcing hip-hop fashion to find an identity beyond the mainstream.
The annual Action Sports Retailer Trade Expo, to be held Sept. 10 to 12 in San Diego, is the 1,000-booth trade show for buyers of sports specialty stores and surf shops, and it's been the venue for hip-hop street wear as well.
But in January, some companies complained that the show had become more rave than wave.
Hip-hop clothing manufacturers brought their own disk jockeys, break dancers, smoke machines, laser lights, concert speakers and groupies.
And often, they brought the sort of tough graphic imagery that rapper Ice-T put in words on his album "Body Count": in logos depicting drive-by shootings, grenades, guns, drugs.


10-Year Note's Yield Hits a 1993 Low
After weeks of grinding long-term interest rates to lower and lower levels, the bond market finally seemed to realize yesterday that it was summer.
Trading slowed and little happened as Labor Day loomed just two weeks away.
The day's biggest action was in the 10-year Treasury note, whose yield fell to another 1993 low.
The price was up 1/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.60 percent, from 5.61 percent Friday.


Cars That Are Not Are Hot
The Big Three's singular ray of sunshine these days comes from the mushrooming popularity of noncar cars: the pickups, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles that are classified by the Government as "trucks" for purposes of energy and safety regulations.
Because trucks are one of the few segments that Japanese rivals have been slow to exploit and because they are more profitable than cars, Detroit's auto makers are devoting ever more money and thought to developing them and to thinking about the reasons they are so popular.


Inquiry by Mandela's Group Finds Abuses by Its Forces
In an act of self-scrutiny the authors called "a first in the annals of human rights enforcement," the African National Congress published an independent report today detailing torture and death in its own military camps in the years of guerrilla war against apartheid.
The report named accused torturers, some of whom still hold posts in the congress's security apparatus, and said the congress should pay reparations to surviving victims.


Asbestos Promises
Day after day since they began their task in early August, officials heading the emergency inspection of New York City's public schools for asbestos have set new targets: more inspectors, more inspections, more schools inspected.
And each day, they have missed them.
They have drawn bar graphs, staged tours of schools and labs and done whatever else they could to assure parents and anyone else that school would open on time on Sept. 9.
And each day, everyone has seemed a little less assured.


Search Continues for Architect Who Disappeared at L.I. Beach
The police continued to search today for Norman Jaffe, a prominent architect in Manhattan and the Hamptons whose clothing was found Thursday morning at an unguarded Atlantic Ocean beach where he frequently swam alone.
The police said friends and family members described the 61-year-old architect, a Bridgehampton resident known locally as a designer of contemporary summer and year-round homes, as physically very fit but a poor swimmer.


State Dept. Expert on Croatia Resigns to Protest Policy in Balkans
Saying he could no longer countenance a policy that he believes legitimizes aggression and genocide in Bosnia, the State Department's specialist on Croatia resigned today, bringing to four the number of officials who have quit in the last year to protest the United States' Balkan policy.
In a two-page letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the official, Stephen W. Walker, said Washington's failure to take a harder line against the Bosnian Serbs had resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties and undermined vital United States interests.


In Yugoslavia, Austerity Drifts Into Despondency
War, which has barely touched this city, has turned what was once a carefree and Western-oriented capital into a sour, aggressive and fearful place.
A hardship that has awakened memories of the German occupation of Yugoslavia in World War II, and the hostility of most of the world to a country that once enjoyed exceptionally good relations across ideological divisions, have stunned the Serbs who dominate here.
Except for those who profit from the war in Bosnia and a seemingly small group of Western-oriented professionals and intellectuals, shortages overshadow life for everyone else.


A Beach for the Ages, Namely Those Under 25
THIS is a seaside resort.
The name says so.
And when the sun comes out, as it has just about every day this summer, it's hard to find a spot on the beach to spread a towel.
But at night: whoa Nellie.
Between the screaming signs for Lucky Leo's arcade, the psychedelic lights of the Ferris wheel and the fun-seekers -- thousands of them, tan and wrinkle-free -- the ocean almost becomes irrelevant.
Stepping onto the boardwalk is like hopping on a moving merry-go-round.
It helps to be 18 to do it right.


Bridge
The Grand National Team Championship, working up from the grass roots to national playoffs, is on three levels.
Flight C, for players below life master rank, was a triumph for New Jersey in July.
In Washington the title went to Stephen Arshan of North Brunswick, Richard Ross of Highland Park, Feng Liu of New Brunswick, Steve Pessin of East Brunswick and George Shamy of Cranbury.
Liu played well to bring home six spades on the diagramed semifinals deal.
He expected to be the dummy when his partner, Pessin, overcalled one diamond with one no-trump and he made a transfer bid to show spade length.
But North's bid of three clubs, showing a doubleton club with a maximum hand and a fine fit in spades, led South to plunge into six spades.


Charles Scorsese, 80; Presser Turned Actor
Luciano Charles Scorsese, a raspy-voiced garment worker who appeared in eight films directed by his son Martin, died yesterday at New York University Hospital.
He was 80 and lived in New York City.
He died after a long illness, said Elizabeth Petit, a spokeswoman for his son.

Consider What Star Wars Accomplished
At a meeting not long ago, I asked Ambassador Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Foreign Relations Committee in the 1980's, what role U.S. policy in general and the Strategic Defense Initiative in particular played in the Soviet Union's collapse.
His answer was straightforward: "You accelerated our catastrophe by about five years."
Remarkable.
More than remarkable in that an investment of about $26 billion saved us and our allies at least five years of much higher defense budgets -- certainly more than $100 billion -- not to mention ending an era in which all humankind lived under a balance of terror.


By Design; Pants? Yes, but . . .
Confused about skirt lengths?
Don't worry.
Just wear pants.
Pants are the most important fashion trend for fall, said Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus.
Of course, that is not revolutionary.
Even women who don't wear pants to work practically live in them after hours and on weekends.
The cut of pants and the way they are worn do change, though.
The most fashionable styles now are stovepipe narrow or slightly flared.
Classic trousers are fuller and softer.

Rushing Game Is Jets' Way to Go
Coach Bruce Coslet is "cautiously optimistic" about the Jets' season.
Even though the Jets have an 0-3 record heading into their final preseason game, against the Redskins on Friday night, Coslet has seen enough to know that his team is capable of reversing the misfortune of the 4-12 record in 1992.
With a little less than two weeks to go before the regular-season opener against Denver at Giants Stadium, here are a few observations about the Jets coming out of training camp and some things to keep an eye on as the year unfolds.


Lyme Disease: Does It Really Linger?
FROM her bed at Northern Westchester Hospital Center, Vicki Logan begs to differ with academic scientists who claim that there is no such thing as chronic Lyme infection and that Lyme is cured with at most four weeks of antibiotics.
Since 1987, Ms.
Logan has battled headaches, fevers, fatigue, progressive paralysis, seizures, periods of dementia and memory loss so severe that she remembers only the previous three weeks out of the last year.
For much of her illness doctors told her she could not possibly have Lyme disease and prescribed no antibiotics.


Bloody Algeria
Algeria, with all opportunities for peaceful change rapidly disappearing and its unpopular Government clinging to power by military force, slides deeper into the sterile politics of death.
Saturday night gunmen ambushed and killed Kasdi Merbah, a former Prime Minister who had recently pleaded for reconciliation between the ruling military and the outlawed Islamic movement.
The authorities were quick to blame his murder on Islamic militants, who have resorted to terrorism in the past.
But Mr.
Merbah's followers aren't so sure.
Last year's assassination of President Mohammed Boudiaf, another conciliatory figure, was also officially blamed on Islamic militants but has yet to be satisfactorily investigated.

I.B.M. Said To Focus on Intel Clone
In a move that could put new profit pressure on the Intel Corporation, I.B.M. has been quietly developing a clone of the Intel microprocessors used in most personal computers, industry analysts said yesterday.
The effort by the International Business Machines Corporation could generate badly needed sales and ease its dependence on a key supplier for the chips that act as the "brains" for I.B.M. personal computers.


Seismologists Debate Los Angeles's Faults
BURIED deep beneath the freeways, shopping malls and luxurious homes of Los Angeles there lies a network of faults that could literally turn parts of this city upside down.
The faults are oriented in such a way that should they suddenly snap and produce a large earthquake, energy would be focused upward, moving like rockets fired from millions of submerged submarines.
Objects and people directly overhead would be lifted into the air, momentarily weightless, as the earthquake waves shuddered past.


A New Chief For Miller Brewing Co.
Less than a year after he was plucked from the Anheuser-Busch Companies to become president of the Miller Brewing Company, John N. MacDonough was named chairman and chief executive yesterday, succeeding Warren H. Dunn, who is retiring after 27 years with the brewery.
The announcement was one of several executive changes within divisions of the Philip Morris Companies.
Succeeding Mr.
MacDonough as Miller's president and chief operating officer is John D. Bowlin, who has been president of the Oscar Mayer Foods Corporation, a division of Kraft General Foods, which is owned by Philip Morris.


Kamieniecki's Start Is Still in Doubt
Scott Kamieniecki did not hesitate today when he arrived at Comiskey Park.
He walked past the television, past his teammates and into the training room.
Kamieniecki, who strained his right hamstring running sprints Sunday, had an important appointment.
After trainer Gene Monahan treated what has become the most watched hamstring on the Yankees, Manager Buck Showalter still did not know whether Kamieniecki would start Thursday in Cleveland.


New British Pact for Nynex
As part of its planned expansion of operations in Britain, Nynex entered into a new working agreement yesterday with Mercury Communications, Britain's second-largest long-distance carrier.
The agreement lets Nynex as well as other telecommunications companies eventually keep more than 50 percent of service revenue for calls completed through Mercury, rather than just the 25 percent under a previous pact.
The accord also provides for greater cooperation with Mercury on sales and marketing.


Moments Amid the Medals
MOST COURAGEOUS PERFORMANCE Jackie Joyner-Kersee of the Unites States winning the women's heptathalon despite fever and weakness "because I learned to test my strength, my character and my heart." MOST SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE Gail Dever's sprint-hurdles gold medal double, a monumental achievement if only because the long strides used in the sprint must be changed to shorter strides to clear the hurdles.
MOST CONSISTENT SPEED Andre Cason of the United States running the three fastest 100 meters of his life - 9.96, 9.94 and 9.92 seconds - within 26 hours, earning him a silver medal.
BOLDEST PERFORMANCE BY NONWINNING AMERICANS Sandra Farmer-Patrick's blazing speed in the women's 400-meter hurdles (she finished second) and Meredith Rainey's swift pace in the women's 800 meter (she finished fifth).
It helps that Bob Kersee, who coaches Farmer-Patrick, and Brooks Johnson, who coaches Rainey, are two of the wisest.
WORST PERFORMANCE BY AMERICANS Mark Everett and Johnny Gray giving up and trotting home last after bumpings in separate semifinals of the men's 800 meters, another example of two of the best sometimes being two of the worst.
BEST BREAKTHROUGH BY YOUNG AMERICANS Jearl Miles and Natasha Kaiser-Brown, one-two in the women's 400 meters, and Mark Croghan, fifth in the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase.
CROWD FAVORITES Maerlene Ottey of Jamaica for preservering 13 years before winning a gold medal in a major championship and Carl Lewis for 10 years of world-class excellence.
BEST LESSON LEARNED Annette Peters, the American distance runner, said: "There's such a difference racing here from the Grand Prix circuit, where you have a pacemaker, the place is fast and even. Here, you've got to be ready to change gears any time at any cost." QUICKEST LEARNER A year ago, Ana Biryukova's best triple jump was 43 feet 11 1/4 inches.
Two months ago, the Russian gave up the long jump to concentrate on the triple jump.
Here, she world women's triple jump record of 49 feet 6 1/4 inches.
BEST LAST LAUGH "In sports school," siad stanislav Tarasenko of Russia, "thay told me I have no future in this event." The event was the men's long jump.
Here, he won the bronze medal.


President of Computer Maker Quits
The president and chief operating officer of the Thinking Machines Corporation, a supercomputer maker in Cambridge, Mass., has resigned after only seven months on the job.
Harvey L. Weiss, who resigned last week, was a 20-year employee at the Digital Equipment Corporation before joining Thinking Machines in 1991.
He was promoted earlier in the year with the assignment to cut costs at the company.


Wal-Mart on Trial on 'Predatory Pricing' Charges
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its pricing practices went on trial yesterday in an Arkansas courtroom, where three independent pharmacies are trying to prove that the nation's largest retailer sold merchandise below its costs in an effort to drive competitors out of business.
The retail druggists in Conway, Ark., north of Little Rock, contend that their business suffered from Wal-Mart's "predatory prices" on items ranging from toothpaste to mouthwash to over-the-counter drugs sold at its Conway superstore.


No Deal: Hampton and Giants a Million Miles Apart
The Giants have made Rodney Hampton, who wants to renegotiate his contract, their first offer: a three-year deal worth about $6.6 million.
But the running back has soundly rejected it and the whole situation appears to be getting ugly.
Fast.
Hampton and the Giants are still almost $1 million apart.
Ralph Cindrich, the agent for Hampton, said they were looking for a three-year deal worth more in the range of $3 million a year.

Encapsulating That Elusive Thing Called Humor
In the beginning was the joke. And verily, it was a knee-slapper.
As told at the inaugural exhibition of this city's newest cultural institution, the International Museum of Humor, low-forehead man emits his first laugh when a bored Neanderthal drops a stone on the head of a sleeping buddy.
The rest of the clan watches, curious, then doubles over with laughter when the butt of the joke howls with pain and rubs his bleeding head.


Pedestrian Crossings As Game of Chicken
To the Editor:
As a summer visitor to New York City and a pedestrian, I find that my negotiations with traffic are a nuisance.
My biggest problem is with vehicles that have a green light making turns onto perpendicular streets on which pedestrians like me have a "Walk" sign.


Sports of The Times; Coach James Should Have Stuck It Out
QUITTERS NEVER WIN. WINNERS NEVER QUIT.
You see that sign, or variation thereof, in every football locker room in this pigskin-kicking land of ours.
That sign is there to remind every fifth-string cannon-fodder lineman that the team, that Coach Himself, that the future of the free world depends on him.
And if he quits the football team out of frustration, "Well, son, that means some day you'll just plain quit on life, too."


Chinese and British Are on Heels of U.S. Prowess
The world outdoor track and field championships left no doubt that with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the dismantling of state-run sports schools in Eastern Europe, the United States is the world's strongest nation in the sport.

When the nine-day championships ended Sunday, Chinese distance runners and British sprinters had scored impressively.

Researchers Study Tracer to See How Oceans Disperse Heat
IN a study that has implications for the understanding of global climate patterns, marine productivity and the spread of pollution, a team of researchers has shown that the dispersion of heat, salt and other substances in the oceans appears to be dominated by mixing along gently sloping horizontal density layers.
By mapping the spread of a nontoxic chemical tracer released about 1,000 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, researchers from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in Plymouth, England, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Mass., showed that the tracer rapidly dispersed along and across the horizontal surface of the targeted density layer.


Dreaming of Lucy
Maybe August is not going to be a news-free month after all.
The New York Post reports that Marla Maples wants to star in a remake of "I Love Lucy."
The original "Lucy" was such a great show that it's tempting to say that not even a theatrical genius should attempt a remake.
But let's rise above such cavils and tune to a higher channel.
In that spirit, it can be said that the ever-resourceful Ms.
Maples invites us to contemplate something more profound than the riveting subject of her own career.


The New-Age Mailbox Now Sits on Your Desk
ELECTRONIC mail, messages sent from computer to computer directly or through a company network or commercial intermediary, is becoming an indispensable tool of business, education and government.
In a strong indication of the role that E-mail is taking, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled on Aug. 13 that the Federal Government must preserve such messages.
But E-mail is also personal, as many letters used to be.
A recent request for anecdotes about E-mail, printed with this writer's access codes for MCI Mail, Compuserve and Genie, inspired more than 50 responses within a few days.
Compuserve provided the largest number, with MCI Mail a strong second and Genie a distant third.
A notably large number came to Compuserve from the Internet, the system that links perhaps 12 million people around the world.

2 Ex-Police Officers Convicted in Detroit Killing


Ethics at Midnight
Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada, the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, warned that the move could "mortally damage" the Senate's integrity.
But that did not deter the majority leader, George Mitchell, from quietly rallying his fellow senators earlier this month to come to the aid of an indicted colleague, Senator David Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota.
Mr.
Durenberger was indicted in March for hiding his ownership of a Minnesota condominium in order to collect reimbursement from the Senate when he visited his home state.
Earlier, in 1990, Mr.
Durenberger had been called to account by the Senate for the same reimbursement scheme.
He pleaded no contest to the Ethics Committee and the Senate "denounced" him for the condo deal and other serious ethics violations.


Ex-Officers in Detroit Guilty In Beating Death of Motorist
Two former police officers were convicted of second-degree murder today in the beating death of a black motorist, ending the country's latest racially charged trial involving the police.
A third former officer was acquitted of assault with intent to do great bodily harm in the case, which has haunted this city for nine months with its parallels to the beating of Rodney G. King in Los Angeles.
Like the officers in the King case, the defendants here were white, and some officials feared that the outcome could touch off a firestorm in Detroit.


Gay Protesters Rejecting Deal on Parade Arrests
Like many of the other people who sat down on the rain-puddled asphalt of Fifth Avenue last St.

Russia-Lithuania Talks Over Troops at Impasse
Russian officials reacted calmly today, with only a touch of nationalist bravado, after President Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania canceled a visit to Moscow.
Mr.
Brazauskas announced the cancellation Sunday in a modulated protest over Russia's decision to suspend talks on withdrawing its last 2,500 troops from Lithuania.
Russia, scheduled to pull out the last of those troops by Aug. 31, now says it will withdraw the troops "at a time convenient to the Russian Federation."


Market Place; Many explanations are possible for the rise in UJB's stock.
WHY did the stock of the UJB Financial Corporation shoot up by more than 10 percent two weeks ago on unusually high volume?
Investors certainly were not attracted by UJB's fundamentals.
UJB, New Jersey's third-largest bank, is among the least profitable banks of its size, largely because it was late to acknowledge its unprofitable real estate loans.


W. Side Open House: 30 Rms, Riv Vu, Lots of Light
After decades in the stormy seas off Cape Fear, N.C., a failed career as a museum and a three-year sojourn at the bottom of a North Carolina harbor, John Krevey's ship, the Frying Pan, probably deserves a rest.
Instead, the former Coast Guard lightship, whose strange appearance and homey name have piqued the curiosity of many New Yorkers since it first appeared here in 1991, has continued to wander from berth to berth in the harbor.
Its latest home is as the resident ghost ship in a summer program at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum.


Two Jets Running Backs Go Down to the Wire
Blair Thomas is still listed at the top of the Jets' depth chart at running back.
Thomas, according to Coach Bruce Coslet, will start Friday night in Washington when the Jets take their 0-3 record into their final exhibition game.
Does this mean that Thomas has won the starting job, despite three disappointing seasons that followed his selection as a first-round draft choice?
Will Thomas get the nod over Johnny Johnson, the pleasant surprise of training camp, who was acquired last spring in a draft-day deal with Phoenix?


Environmentalists Sue Over L.I. Water Policy
Reopening a conflict over how best to safeguard water quality, an environmental group is charging that a state-approved plan to protect groundwater in nine areas covering nearly one quarter of Long Island is grossly inadequate.
In a suit filed in State Supreme Court in Albany late Monday, the Nassau Suffolk Neighborhood Network charges that the nearly $1 million plan, completed by the Long Island Regional Planning Board in April, offers a mishmash of advisory measures but no clear guidance to local governments for protecting the nine areas and the groundwater beneath them.

One of the most satisfying experiences for any player is to surprise the pundits by scoring a victory in a major event against a team that is stronger on paper.
It happened just before the start of the Summer Nationals in Washington last month, when a fancied Chicago group lost in the quarterfinal of the Grand National Teams.
The winners, by a slender margin of 6 imps, were a New England squad: Steve Becker of Cos Cob, Conn., Rich De Martino of Riverside, Conn., Bob Schwartz and Peter Lieberman, both of Framingham, Mass., Perry Trilling of Ashland, Mass., and Bob Barr of Lynn, Mass.


Sales Up 5.2% For Vehicles Built in U.S.
Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America rose 5.2 percent in mid-August, compared with a weak period last year, the nation's auto makers reported today, as dealers scraped the bottom of their inventories to meet demand.
After a slow start to the month, sales climbed back, suggesting that the recovery by domestic auto makers, while not robust, remains on track.


Two Magazines Name Publishers
Two major New York-based magazines appointed publishers yesterday.
Gourmet magazinesaid Peter King Hunsinger, its advertising director, had been promoted to publisher, succeeding Richard B. Barthelmes, who resigned after six years.


What's With Coleman? Decision Coming Soon
The Mets have heard Vince Coleman.
Now, the Mets will act on Vince Coleman.
The lawyers can likely begin preparing their briefs immediately.
The Mets' ownership was briefed last night on the club's interview with Coleman earlier in the day and will announce its plan for the left fielder within 48 hours, perhaps as early as today.


Maryland Contract Awarded to Doner
The Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development in Baltimore said it had awarded W. B. Doner &amp; Company in Baltimore a three-year contract, with a two-year renewal option, to promote tourism and business development in the state.
Billings on the contract, previously handled by Earle Palmer Brown in Bethesda, Md., were estimated at $3 million a year.


Corrections
An article by The Associated Press in Business Day on Thursday, about mortgage lending in inner cities and minority neighborhoods, referred incorrectly to loans made by the Chase Manhattan Corporation in 1992.
Chase reported a 24 percent increase in lending last year to minority customers in New York City and Westchester County, not nationwide.


Publisher Plans to Revive Dial Press
While many publishers have been closing specialty imprints that had functioned as small publishing boutiques, Dell Publishing announced yesterday that it would do the opposite, restarting an old and respected imprint that had been shut down at the end of 1985.
The revived imprint, Dial Press, will open on Sept. 7 and be run by Susan Kamil, who most recently worked as an editor at Turtle Bay Books, until that imprint was closed by Random House.
Ms.
Kamil will serve as the editorial director of Dial and as the executive editor of Delacorte Press, the hardcover division of Dell.


Yoga, a 60's Survivor, Is Luring New Converts
WHEN he was in high school, Rudd Simmons learned a few yoga poses.
But only this year did Mr.
Simmons, a 40-year-old film producer in New York, begin using yoga regularly to stay fit.
"A lot of the stigma people may have felt in the 70's and 80's is relaxing," Mr.
Simmons said.
Yoga, he said, perfectly accommodates his erratic schedule.
"It is sometimes difficult for me to get to a pool or go out for a bike ride, but this is something I can do at home."

Clinton and Kennedys: In 30 Years, a Full Circle
Thirty years ago, Bill Clinton the boy stood staring at John F. Kennedy, his hero, in the White House Rose Garden.
Today, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and other members of the family welcomed Bill Clinton the President to the seas off the Massachusetts coast that his murdered predecessor loved so well.
The Kennedys, who give New England the nearest the nation comes to royalty, turned out in force to escort Mr.
Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, on a nearly five-hour luncheon cruise out of Menemsha Harbor toward the red clay bluffs of Gay Head at Martha's Vineyard's western tip.


Bridgeport Redistricting Challenged in Court Suit
The Connecticut Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit, apparently the first of its kind in Connecticut, arguing that a Bridgeport City Council redistricting plan approved this spring is so flawed that the November municipal elections should be postponed or canceled.
The suit, filed last month in Federal District Court in New Haven, says that racial bloc voting is deeply entrenched in white, black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the city and that the white-dominated City Council redrew district lines in May with the specific goal of maintaining white control.


CHRONICLE
America's political odd couple -- JAMES CARVILLE, the chief political strategist for President Clinton's election campaign, and MARY MATALIN, his counterpart in the Bush campaign -- have finally set a date to be married, The Baton Rouge Advocate reported yesterday.
The newspaper said Mr.
Carville, 48, had confirmed that he and Ms.
Matalin, 39, will be married on Thanksgiving in a private evening ceremony at the Omni Royal Orleans Hotel in New Orleans.
They will live near Front Royal, Va., where Mr.
Carville recently bought a home.
He is also the chief political campaign adviser to Gov.
Jim Florio of New Jersey, who is running for re-election this year.


Another Horn Is Added to the Sounds of the Bay


In Kremlin, Hints and Allegations
The spectacle of senior Russian officials hurling mud at one another, alleging corruption without evidence and citing documents that they refuse to release, is undermining the already weak authority of the state.
Russia is paralyzed by open conflict between the executive and legislative branches and the inability to agree on a new Constitution or new elections.
But if the warfare were merely between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Parliament, led by the Speaker, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the current battle would have the somewhat tedious character of the recent past.


Kiss Those Burritos Adios! Real Mexican Food Is Here
THE SMELL of cornmeal and chiles, beef tongue and pinto beans rushed through the door of Rinconcito Mexicano as Maria Hinojosa edged into the narrow storefront on West 39th Street in Manhattan.
The crowd in front of the steamy cafeteria counter was packed as tight as a tamale and Ms.
Hinojosa, a 27-year-old reporter for National Public Radio, closed her eyes, took one long sniff and exhaled.
"Ay yai!" she said.
"It smells like the streets of Mexico City. I'm in heaven."
At last.
Since arriving in New York City 15 years ago, Ms.
Hinojosa (pronounced een-oh-HO-sah), like most Mexican emigrants, has suffered what she calls "absolute culture shock," as well as culinary duress.
"No tortillas, no chiles, no real Mexican restaurants," she said.
"I walked around looking for Mexican people, listening to hear an accent like mine, trying to catch a whiff of the food I grew up on."


Dinkins Says Board of Education Shouldn't Handle Maintenance
Mayor David N. Dinkins proposed yesterday that responsibility for maintaining New York City schools be shifted from the Board of Education to the School Construction Authority, which is heading the emergency inspection and cleanup of schools affected by asbestos.
Saying that years of lapsed repair work was a principal cause of airborne asbestos contamination in the schools, Mr.
Dinkins asserted that the poor conditions in schools could only be reversed with state aid.
The construction authority is financed by state bonds.


A Way to Take On a Giant
Telephone industry executives say the Bell Atlantic Corporation is trying to assemble a wireless consortium that could rival A.T.&amp; T. by bidding on radio licenses for a coming generation of wireless offerings called personal communications services.
The effort is being led by Mark Fowler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now president of Bell Atlantic Personal Communications.
People familiar with the effort, who spoke on the condition they not be identified, said Mr.
Fowler was in talks with the BellSouth Corporation and was also hoping to woo a large number of smaller independent telephone companies.
"It's a serious effort," said an executive of one Bell company that is not joining in.


Big Bond Sale For Authority
To take advantage of lower interest rates, the New York Power Authority yesterday sold $1.1 billion of general-purpose bonds, the largest bond issue in the agency's history.

Weicker's Mother Dies
Mary Bickford Paulsen, the mother of Gov.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, died in her sleep yesterday at the Governor's Residence in Hartford, his office announced.
She was 88 years old.
Mrs.

For many years she had been active in the American Red Cross, serving as an ambulance driver during World War II.


Review/Film; Mel Gibson in Directorial Debut
When a man has a face like Mel Gibson's, a movie studio is apt to want to keep that face happy.
That's one explanation for "The Man Without a Face," with which Mr.
Gibson makes his directorial debut.
Following the time-honored tradition whereby handsome performers prove their seriousness by camouflaging their looks, Mr.
Gibson appears in the title role as a hermit half-disfigured by scar tissue. (The other half, the one more often on camera, looks just fine.) A former teacher, he enjoys speaking Latin and listening to opera in a book-lined, wood-paneled lair.
This is the "Hamlet" Mel Gibson, not the "Lethal Weapon" guy.
The best that can be said about Mr.
Gibson as a director -- and this is no mean achievement -- is that it's often possible to forget he was the man behind the camera.
Most of this film has a crisp, picturesque look and a believable manner.
Set in 1968 in a charming Maine coastal village, the film tells why 12-year-old Chuck Norstadt feels like such an outsider in his own family.
Chuck's much-married mother (Margaret Whitton) and his bickering half-sisters (Gaby Hoffman and Fay Masterson) make him ill at ease, and his father is long gone.


Why the Marines Declared War on Marriage; He Stopped the Buck
To the Editor:
No one is surprised when a politician expounds upon the success of a program he's introduced, one seen as total failure by every unbiased eye.
We've become inured to such blather.
Gen.
Carl E. Mundy Jr., the Marine Commandant, deserves better than the ad hominem attack in "Marine Madness" (editorial, Aug. 13) for accepting and admitting culpability for a plan to recruit only the unmarried for the corps.


BUSINESS DIGEST
A Federal court overturned a law barring telephone companies from providing television programming over their networks.
The ruling, which is certain to be appealed, could clear the way for an all-out race between telephone and cable television companies to provide hundreds of channels of television and two-way communications services over fiber optic networks.  [ Page A1. ]
The regional Bell telephone companies are split on how to respond to A.T.&amp; T.'s planned acquisition of the nation's biggest cellular carrier.
They also disagree on technical issues, which could make it hard to match A.T.&amp; T. in advanced new services.  [ D1. ]


Why the Marines Declared War on Marriage
To the Editor:
As an experienced civilian counselor and advocate for enlisted members of the Armed Forces, I was surprised to see Gen.
Carl E. Mundy, the Marine Commandant, put into writing the longstanding military policy of discouraging marriage or committed emotional relationships by enlisted people, especially males.


Pupils Find Jump-Rope Rhymes Leapfrog Oceans
Anyone who has ventured onto a playground knows the scene.
Facing each other on the pavement, two little girls swing a rope in broad circles.
A third girl hops delicately over the rope as it slaps the ground, again and again.
Their friends clustered nearby chant a rhyme that provides a counterpoint to the jump-rope's gentle beat:
Cinderella dressed in yellow,
Went upstairs to kiss a fellow.
Made a mistake and kissed a snake,
How many doctors did it take?


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Baseline View: Lendl Up, Wilander Out  Ivan Lendl, the top-seeded player, defeated Guillaume Raoux, 7-5, 6-3, in the opening round of the OTB International Open yesterday in Schenectady, N.Y.
Javier Sanchez, seeded fifth, was a 7-5, 6-2 winner over Mats Wilander.
Lendl, who controlled play throughout from the baseline, broke Raoux at 6-5 to win the first set and broke again at 4-3 in the second set, then served out the match in the next game.
No admission is charged to the $350,000 event, and more than 3,000 packed the center court at Schenectady's Central Park for Lendl's match. (AP) BOXING  Toney Celebrates 25th With a Victory  Super middleweight champion James Toney celebrated his 25th birthday last night with a unanimous 10-round decision over Larry Prather at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich.

WHITE HOUSE ASKS REVISION OF RULES TO SAVE WETLANDS
The White House proposed a package of measures today that would affect millions of acres of wetlands, offering some additional protection to the fragile ecosystems, particularly in Alaska, but easing some restrictions on their use.
While the Bush Administration was considering a plan that would have exempted up to 1.7 million acres in Alaska from Federal protection -- or 1 percent of the state's total wetland acreage -- the Clinton plan would protect all such land in the state.

B.
FUQUA, the retired chairman of the former Fuqua Industries, Inc., a Fortune 500 company, is in the habit of giving millions to schools and then giving them his name.
In 1980, he gave nearly $20 million to the business school at Duke University, which promptly changed its name to the Fuqua School of Business.
At a news conference on Monday in Richmond, Mr.
Fuqua announced he was giving $10 million to the Prince Edward Academy in Farmville, Va., a private elementary and high school, and that it would be renamed the Fuqua School.


A Chair Is Still a Chair and a Deal Is Still a Deal; After a Three-Year Absence, Public Seating Is Restored to Le Parker Meridien Atrium

Eighteen spindly black chairs, vaguely neo-classical and marginally comfortable, now line the mirrored hall at 119 West 56th Street, or "56ieme Rue," as the sign says.


U.S. Determines China Violated Pact on Missiles
The Clinton Administration has determined that China has violated an international arms control agreement by shipping sensitive missile technology to Pakistan and therefore must be subjected to United States economic sanctions, officials said today.
Officials said that the Administration has yet to decide on the nature of the sanctions that will be imposed on China as a result of the violation of the agreement, the Missile Technology Control Regime.


New Report in Jordan Case
A convenience store clerk said that she saw James Jordan and the two men accused of his murder in her Brunswick County store more than three days after the father of Michael Jordan was believed to have been shot.
Helen Norris, 52, the morning clerk at DJ Mini Mart on U.S. 17, gave her account to a Brunswick County detective, who has relayed the information to the Robeson County Sheriff's Department, which is handling the case.
Detective Mark Locklear of the Robeson County Sheriff's Department said today he plans to interview Mrs.
Norris and two other witnesses in the store.
But he said the state still believes the 56-year-old Jordan was shot while in his red Lexus early July 23 near Lumberton after he had pulled off U.S. 74 to rest.
Larry Martin Demery of Rowland and Daniel Andre Green of Lumberton are charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery.
Neither Detective Locklear nor Hugh Rogers, Demery's lawyer, could imagine why the suspects would have kept Jordan alive at least three days and allow him to be seen in public.
The DJ Mini Mart is about 50 miles east of Lumberton.


U.S. Appeals Trade-Accord Requirement
The Clinton Administration asked an appeals court today to overturn a ruling that United States trade officials must prepare an environmental-impact statement, a task that would seriously delay and possibly doom the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The tribunal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is expected to rule by late next month.
If it does not reverse the lower-court decision, the prospects for approval of the agreement darken considerably.


BORLAND SHIPS REVISED SOFTWARE AT A CUT-RATE PRICE
Borland International Inc. said yesterday that it was shipping versions of its Quattro Pro software spreadsheet program which eliminate a feature that a Federal court last week found infringed copyrights for the 1-2-3 spreadsheet by the Lotus Development Corporation, of Cambridge, Mass.
Borland, of Scotts Valley, Calif., plans to appeal the ruling.


Judge's Order Bars Walkout On Amtrak
A Federal judge signed a temporary restraining order yesterday that prevented today's rush hour from going nowhere on rail lines tied to Amtrak.
The order, from Federal District Judge Stanley Harris in Washington, came near the end of a day that rail officials spent scrambling to make sure they were prepared for a threatened walkout that would have affected 62,000 riders on Amtrak throughout the country, as well as commuters on Metro North and the Long Island Rail Road.


Governor Finds Down Follows Up in Alabama
Nearly four months ago, when Gov.
Guy Hunt was convicted of ethics violations and removed from office, Lieut.
Gov.
James E. Folsom Jr. was thrust into the job with few things in his favor beyond a well-known name from this state's turbulent political past.
Beyond being the son of Gov.
James E. (Big Jim) Folsom, who looms large in Alabama political legend as a progressive force in the 1950's, the image of Little Jim Folsom was fuzzy.
He was generally regarded as likable but somewhat disengaged and ineffectual.


Mazda Dismisses 5 Officials In Cutback at U.S. Operation
In another executive shake-up reflecting the soaring yen and hard times for Japan's auto makers, the Mazda Motor Corporation dismissed its top American executive today and said it would reduce its headquarters staff in Irvine, Calif., by about 35 percent.
Clark J. Vitulli, who left the Chrysler Corporation in 1989 to run Mazda's American sales operations, was let go along with four other top executives.
Mr.
Vitulli's title, executive vice president of operations, was eliminated, Mazda said.


For Becker in Hamlet, Everything Comes Up Mostly Weeds
Maybe it was because he really did not want to be here, something he said earlier this week.
Perhaps, it was that his opponent was having a great night.
Or it could merely be that Boris Becker was a little bit off.
Whatever it was, it was wonderful theater tonight, as Andrei Chesnokov pulled off the first major upset of the Waldbaum's Hamlet Cup with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 victory over the second-seeded Becker.


Did a Town In Germany Pay Firebug For Attack?
Few eyebrows were raised last year when a firebomb destroyed an unoccupied building near Berlin that was to become a hostel for asylum-seekers.
Gangs of rightist youths regularly set such fires in Germany, and the fact that no one was inside the building in this hamlet before dawn on Nov. 1 kept the episode off the front pages.
This week, however, the people of Dolgenbrodt suddenly found themselves under harsh scrutiny.
State prosecutors are investigating reports that some residents in the village of about 250 people secretly collected money to pay the arsonists.


Morrow Cancels Plans For Lincoln-Era History
William Morrow &amp; Company, which had reportedly been prepared to pay $1 million to publish a book purporting to be the memoirs of Abraham Lincoln's laundress, has canceled its plans because of questions about the manuscript's authenticity.
The manuscript, called "A House Divided: An Oral History of Mariah Vance 1850-1860," is owned by Lloyd Ostendorf of Akron, Ohio, an artist and a collector of Lincoln memorabilia.
It was submitted to a number of Lincoln scholars, who raised such serious questions that Morrow felt it could not go ahead, said Liza Dawson, a senior editor and vice president at Morrow.

Dinkins Moves to Block Company From Contracts
Mayor David N. Dinkins took the first steps yesterday to ban Lockheed Information Management Services from doing business with the city, six days after a city investigation found that the company received preferential treatment from his senior aides when it won a lucrative contract earlier this year.
The move was the latest in a series of incremental steps the Dinkins administration has taken as the Mayor has struggled each day to find ways to dispel the controversy, which has rattled his senior aides and forced the resignation of his Budget Director and the suspension of some duties of another official.


60-Minute Gourmet
IN parts of the country where the summer has been warm and sunny, with neither too little nor too much rain, the tomato crop has erupted in recent weeks.
As usual, home gardeners now face a windfall that needs to be used quickly.
So how to take best advantage of this fleeting treat?
Many cooks make tomato sauce and freeze it for later use, while the more impulsive indulge with abandon as long as the good times last.
To my taste, there are few foods as pleasing as a vine-ripened tomato that has been sliced, drizzled with olive oil and garnished with basil and perhaps a slathering of fresh goat cheese.


A Long Night of Miscues in the Mud for the Yanks and the White Sox
No guarantee comes with a game between contenders for division championships.
Just because the teams are good enough to be in or near first place doesn't make the game automatically a thing of artistic and professional beauty.
Foul weather and equally foul play can make the game as dreadful as a late August game between the Mets and the Padres.
The Yankees and the White Sox demonstrated that Monday night into early yesterday morning.
With rain, thunder, lightning and errant play befogging the air surrounding Comiskey Park, the first-place White Sox and the on-the-verge-of-being-tied-for-first-again Yankees staggered and sloshed their way through a 3-hour-32-minute game that took 6 hours 22 minutes to complete.

Radio Shack Review Draws 40 Agencies
Radio Shack said yesterday that 40 to 45 agencies have got in contact with it to compete in a review for a creative assignment to help change shoppers' perceptions of the retail chain.
Though billings were not disclosed, Adweek estimated them this week to be at least $50 million.
Radio Shack, a division of the Tandy Corporation in Fort Worth, , wants to be seen as "a convenient, user-friendly store that demystifies technology," Len Roberts, Radio Shack's newly appointed president, said in confirming a report on the review in Adweek.
He added that as part of its efforts to appeal to consumers, the 6,700-store chain would offer services like making repairs after warranties expire.

"We'll try to hone in on what the issues might be, but it will be good to get started."


Tap-Water Tasters Give Nod to New York City's
The tasters swished.
They smacked.
They gargled and gurgled.
Some stared pensively into the greenness of Central Park before finally swallowing cool dollops yesterday from pitchers of tap water lined up in front of the American Museum of Natural History.
"Actually, I have a water filter at home," said one taster, Rodney Beaton, of Manhattan.
"Just in case there's something in it, you know?"
But after all the paper cups were crumpled, it was New York City's tap water that thirsty passers-by chose as the tastiest of five water samples from around the area in the regional finals of the seventh annual Statewide Water Tasting Contest.

Brisk Sales at 2-Year Note Auction
If you want a good explanation of why investors -- big or small -- are assuming more risk to get higher yields in the Treasury market, just look at the results of yesterday's two-year Treasury note auction.
The high yield at the auction was 3.94 percent, the lowest since the April auction.
But what is more important for the investor in two-year notes is this: Someone who bought two-year notes in August 1991 got a yield of 6.46 percent on the money invested.
Today, there is no Treasury security -- even the 30-year bond -- that has a yield that high.


Market Place; Hyundai gambles on a rebound in the disk-drive industry.
THE Hyundai Electronics Industries Company bought a 40 percent stake last week in one of the most battered victims of the price wars in the computer disk-drive business, the Maxtor Corporation.
With its $150 million investment, the big South Korean company is ignoring the falling prices and big losses recently in the disk-drive industry.
Daniel Benton, a portfolio manager at Dawson-Samberg Capital Management Inc., thinks the Koreans have the right idea, but probably the wrong company.
Mr.
Benton believes the producers of disk drives for personal computers are set to rebound after a terrible first half of losses and sliding share prices.

Dinkins, in Testimony, Defends His Response on Crown Heights
Mayor David N. Dinkins stood his ground yesterday during a grueling daylong questioning by a lawyer trying to show that the Mayor permitted violence against Hasidic Jews to go unchecked in Crown Heights two years ago.
The lawyer was representing the Hasidim of Crown Heights, who are suing Mr.
Dinkins and the city.
During a break in the questioning, conducted at Gracie Mansion, the Mayor suggested that the lawsuit had been brought, in essence, to do him political damage by keeping questions about Crown Heights alive as he seeks re-election.


Sports of The Times; The Barking That Follows Mary Pierce
WHEN you arrived at the door of the nightclub -- the Palace on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan -- the large, grim man not only checked the guest list, he also looked over your face.
Was this the face he had seen on the photograph given him earlier, the man he was instructed to keep out?
The one for which security guards had already sealed the other ways into the building?
No.
O.K., enter.
Shortly after, in the dimly lighted club, three beefy men hurried to escort several people including a tall young woman -- over 6 feet tall in high heels -- with straight blonde hair flowing halfway down the back of her elegant black dress.
They moved at a jog through the bar area to a small old elevator that was being held for them.
The elevator took them to a room on the third floor to a party in honor of the young woman, Mary Pierce, the 18-year-old tennis player.
She was with her mother, Yannick, and brother, David, 17.

Then he was off for a meeting in Kenya to encourage increased relief operations by the United Nations in Somalia.
Since departing the White House in 1981, he has left the impression that there are several Jimmy Carters, all running around the world supervising free elections, helping to build houses for the poor, Johnny Appleseed-ing crops in drought areas and promoting human rights.
Of the five living ex-Presidents, Mr.
Carter is the only one who doesn't appear to be devoting his energies to riding, golfing or rewriting his history.


A Mystery, a Pitcher, Numbers, Questions
The scoreboard holds many mysteries for Frank Tanana, among them these: 1) Why are the numbers he puts up never good enough for triumphs? 2) Why are the numbers he puts up, regardless of how few triumphs they translate into, not good enough for some contender to roll the dice on?
Last night, Tanana held the Cincinnati Reds to three hits and two runs through seven airtight, strategically sublime innings.
He departed and didn't win.
The Mets wasted a 4-2 lead for Tanana in the ninth, their sorry surrender including a walk, an error, an uncontested double steal, a balk and a two-out double.

Drug Inquiry Into Officers In Brooklyn
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said last night that Federal and state prosecutors were investigating allegations that a group of police officers ran a drug trafficking ring on their beats in the 73d Precinct in Brownsville, Brooklyn, systematically stealing drugs from drug dealers.
The investigation has been led for the last year by the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, other law enforcement officials said.
It has focused on a group of between 10 and 15 officers suspected of holding up the dealers, sometimes at gunpoint, in one of the most crime-racked areas of the city.


M-G-M Names a President For United Artists Division
In a move to accelerate movie production at troubled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., John Calley, a former Warner Brothers executive, has been named president of United Artists Pictures, a revived M-G-M division.
Frank Mancuso, who was recently named chairman and chief executive of M-G-M, the parent of United Artists, made the announcement Monday, saying Mr.
Calley's experience as a film maker, producer and studio executive would be an impetus to rebuilding United Artists.


City Council Member Cleared Of Allegations of Carpetbagging
The Bronx District Attorney's Office yesterday cleared City Councilman Israel Ruiz Jr. of allegations of carpetbagging, saying that he lived in a Bronx cooperative within the 14th councilmanic district at least part time.
Oscar Serra, Mr.
Ruiz's press secretary, said the Councilman was happy with the report but maintained that the address, 8 Fordham Oval, was a full-time residence.
He said, however, that the Councilman occasionally spent weekends at a house in Middletown, N.Y,. that his wife owned before their marriage.


U.S. TROOPS RAISE STAKES IN SOMALIA
President Clinton's decision to send about 400 elite Army commandos to Somalia signals a rise in Washington's efforts to help a United Nations-led force quell Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid's disruptive faction in Mogadishu, Administration officials said today.
Senior officials sought today to avoid personalizing the conflict with General Aidid, who has been blamed for attacks on peacekeeping troops since June.
"This is not an effort to go after one man," the Pentagon spokeswoman, Kathleen deLaski, told reporters.
"It's an effort to improve the overall situation in Mogadishu."


A Digital Preservation For Decaying Newsreels
Before there was the evening news on television, there was the weekly Movietone News at the movie theater.
Between 1919 and 1963 the short films presented vignettes of the world's current affairs to millions of Americans.
But today, what remains of this vast visual history is in danger of turning to cellulose fiber or plastic shards.
And preserving it by conventional means -- transfering to new film or videotape -- would take at least a decade and cost $50 million or more.


Trevignano Journal; Who's Burning Italy? In 2 Months, 10,000 Fires
All through a long, hot summer, the fires have come, crackling through Italy's byways, marching like bright armies, scorching the earth -- and making money for some out of the devastation of others.
By some Government estimates, the summer's tally could reach a record one million acres of burned woodlands, four times the figure 10 years ago.

Stepping Out to Harlem And Its New Park Place
AT its most pernicious, the term "color line" means a barricade that denies darker-skinned people access to jobs, housing and even cabs.
But in New York City there are also other color lines -- geographical boundaries across which it is white people who move only rarely and usually timidly.
There are divisions like this in every borough but the most striking is along the southern perimeter of Harlem, arguably the most famous urban concentration of black people in the world.
Above ground it runs along 110th Street on the East Side before it swings up around Morningside Heights to 125th Street on the West Side.
But it is below the surface, at the 96th Street subway station, where racial filtration becomes most apparent.
There, the uptown Broadway locals carry the full spectrum of New Yorkers while the expresses, heading for Harlem and the South Bronx, generally leave the station with few if any whites.


A Welcome for Immigrants Turns to Resentment
Rich and poor, legally or not, they came to Southern California by the millions over the last decade, foreigners in search of a better life or political refuge.
The immigrants were mostly welcome at first, filling unwanted jobs in a robust economy, opening businesses and sweetening the good life in sunny California by working cheaply as maids, gardeners and dishwashers.
But today the welcome has worn out.


No Gloating as Bahr Keeps Giant Job
With the departure of Todd Peterson today, the Giants stripped their place-kicking department down to just one, the veteran Matt Bahr, who will handle the kickoffs and field-goal attempts in the forthcoming season.
Although cracking jokes at his locker before practice, the 37-year-old Bahr would admit to no glee or relief at having assured himself a place on a National Football League roster for the 15th consecutive season.

Legs, Legacies and a Florida State Freshman
He had his choice of legacies.
Scott Bentley, the top high school kicker in the nation a year ago, could have gone to Notre Dame as his father did.
Bentley could have gone there with the knowledge that the Fighting Irish had the need for a kicker and he had the ability to hold the job for four years.
But there was this other legacy, the one that kept appearing on the television screen at his home in Aurora, Colo.
Bentley was watching Florida State's basketball team late last February in a game at Duke.
He watched a Florida State player go to the foul line for the first time.
As the player held the ball for the first free throw, Bentley saw a sign under the basket:


A Festive Roundelay In Bernstein's Honor
Today would have been Leonard Bernstein's 75th birthday, and although the composer and conductor is no less an icon of American music now than he was when he died in October 1990, the anniversary is shaping up as an occasion to celebrate the breadth of his musicianship.
Free concerts are being presented today and Friday, and Bernstein's works and performances will rule the airwaves at WNYC (93.9 FM).
So an admirer can bask in Bernstein's music making this week without spending a dime.
Most of the celebrations are purely musical, although one of the major events is also partly civic: in a ceremony outside of Alice Tully Hall at 5:45 P.M. today, the section of West 65th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue is to be named Leonard Bernstein Place.
Representatives of the music world and of the New York City government will speak, the Manhattan Brass Quintet will play a fanfare, and Bernstein's children -- Jamie Bernstein Thomas, Alexander and Nina -- will unveil the new street sign.


Bookshelf Space at Toys 'R' Us
After years of introducing American children to cutting edge interactive video games and the latest variety of Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtle, Toys "R" Us is gearing up to sell a more traditional form of entertainment: books.

Why the Marines Declared War on Marriage; A British Imperial Relic
To the Editor:
I was speaking with a Harvard Business School professor and took the opportunity to say to him that I thought that at the core of American business practice was the inefficient military model of personnel management.
The problems of enlisted-officer barriers, gender discrimination in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as well as many other ancient, but less than honorable personnel practices are dinosaurs, relics of British imperial practices and pretensions to empire.
Having not an iota of military experience, this professor looked at me blankly.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY  DINKINS DEFENDS ACTIONS ON UNREST
Mayor David N. Dinkins stood his ground during a grueling day-long questioning by a lawyer trying to show that the Mayor permitted violence against Hasidic Jews to go unchecked in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, two years ago.

It was a David N. Dinkins not often seen by the public -- stubborn, focused and direct as he answered questions aimed in part at showing that he was out of touch during four days of interracial violence on the streets of Brooklyn.

Hunger On the Farm
Even at the height of the harvest season, around one-third of American farm workers are unable to find jobs.
Although the Federal Commission on Agricultural Workers reported this spring that there were surpluses of farm workers all across the nation, the Labor Department continues to allow growers to employ about 19,000 temporary agricultural workers from Mexico and the Caribbean.
These jobs can and should be filled by domestic workers.
The "H-2A" visa program, which is part of the immigration law, allows agricultural employers to temporarily hire resident foreign workers (although not illegal aliens) when they can't find American citizens for the job.
The law also requires growers to offer the aliens wages and working conditions comparable to those available to domestic workers.


The Clams That Deserve to Be Steamed
I HAD never had steamers, which are also called soft-shell clams, until I came to the United States.
Plentiful and inexpensive during the summer, especially in the Northeast, steamers are one of the great treats of the season.
Although like little-neck clams they are good raw, steamers are usually cooked.
Plain, steamed clams are my favorite, although another popular way to prepare steamers is to remove them from their shells, roll in cracker crumbs and deep-fry.

Campus Journal; What's in a New Name? Image, and Lots of Hope
Deep in this tiny state, pickup trucks and horse-drawn Amish carts share a two-lane highway that meanders past cornfields, silos and frame houses with screen porches flying the Stars and Stripes, until it reaches the brick gates of that most venerable of American institutions, the local college.
Graceful lettering announces it as Delaware State College.
But for the first half of its 102-year life it was known as the State College for Colored Students.
Now the school's name is changing again.
This summer the Legislature named it a university.


Roper Industries
Shares of Roper Industries reached a 52-week high yesterday after the maker of industrial-fluid and gas-control systems reported that third-quarter earnings tripled.
The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
The improved earnings were principally a result of the acquisition of the Compressor Controls Corporation in September.


Playing Tug-of-War In Gracie Dining Room
It was a David N. Dinkins not often seen by the public -- stubborn, focused and direct as he answered questions aimed in part at showing that he was out of touch during four days of interracial violence on the streets of Brooklyn two years ago this month.
On trial in his own house, the Mayor was by turns tight-lipped and combative, quietly sincere and sarcastic, as he endured five hours of harsh questioning by Franklyn Snitow, a lawyer for the Hasidim from Crown Heights.
The handful of spectators in the ballroom of Gracie Mansion could almost see the wheels of the Mayor's mind whirring to skirt pitfalls of both substance and style.


Fresh Vegetables to the Rescue
At the end of the day, a tired cook often copes with dinner by buying some prepared foods and filling in with a bit of cooking at home.
There is no better time to rely on such assistance than in the summer, when fresh vegetables are so good and so plentiful they don't need much help.
Kitchen work can also be reduced by cutting down on the number of pots.
In the following recipe for smoked turkey tortellini, you need just one.


Texas Instruments Sees Job Cuts
Texas Instruments confirmed today that it anticipates work-force reductions in its defense and strategic electronics unit of 4,800 jobs by the end of 1997 because of cuts in military spending.
The unit, which accounts for 27 percent of the company's revenue, now employs 13,500 people, down from a high of 25,000 in 1988.


U.S. Woman Says Demjanjuk Was at Nazi Camp

"He was there," Esther Raab, 71, of Vineland, N.J., told The Associated Press.
"He was miserable like all of them. He wasn't any different. What were they there for? To kill."

"Indonesia Reduces Separatist's Prison Term" (news item, Aug. 15), reports that the life sentence imposed upon Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the resistance leader of East Timor, was reduced to 20 years because, according to Indonesian authorities, the defendant acknowledged Indonesia's "sovereignty" over East Timor.


Resignations at Treasury Raise The Question: Is Bentsen Next?
Three of the closest aides to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- his chief of staff, his press spokesman and his personal secretary -- are leaving the Treasury, fueling speculation that Mr.
Bentsen may soon step down.
Mr.
Bentsen's time as Treasury Secretary has been rockier than expected because of the huge difficulties that President Clinton's budget plan encountered and because of criticism that Mr.

New Trouble in Prince William Sound
This is an anxious time for Alaskans who live and work on Prince William Sound, scene of the Exxon Valdez oil spill four years ago.
The Government Accounting Office has found blatant mismanagement of the fund that is supposed to restore and protect the Prince William habitat.
In addition, this year's salmon harvest is the smallest in 20 years, raising fears that damage to the sound might be far worse than was previously thought.


Poor Peru Stands By as Its Rich Past Is Plundered
Two hours north of Lima, a dirt road off the main highway runs into the desert, past a chicken farm and up to a series of rounded hills.
At the base of the hills, in an area the size of a football field, the ground is pockmarked with holes, some 12 feet deep.
Strewn around are pieces of ancient pottery and fragments of human bones from the Chancay culture, which flourished between 700 and 1400 -- worthless items diggers left behind.
In the holes are the remains of passages and burial chambers that have nearly been demolished.


Review/Television; Browsing the Newsmagazines and Happening Upon a New One
To judge by last week's opening edition, "Now" aspires to a place in the crowded network newsmagazine racks closer to the heartstring-tugging "20/20" than to the punchy "60 Minutes." But in this genre the similarities are more marked than the differences.
Most of the favored stories -- human-interest items, crime cases, exposes or their facsimiles, celebrity puffers -- might, with minor adjustments, fit into any of the dozen or so such shows now on the air or soon to be there.
The easiest way to tell which of them you happen to be watching is by the hosts.
"Now" is presided over by Katie Couric and Tom Brokaw, NBC's answer to ABC's Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson and Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs.
Seated outdoors before a glowing Rockefeller Center, the new couple began somewhat stiffly last week with scripted small talk.
Ms.
Couric neatly one-upped the predictable reviewer response by cracking that another newsmagazine was "just what America needs."


South Africa Ends Conscription of Whites
The South African military tonight announced the end of compulsory military service for whites.
Kobie Coetsee, the Minister of Defense, issued a statement saying the next white draft in January would be canceled and conscription of whites would give way to a volunteer army open to all races.
Nonwhites have never been drafted.

Showalter Couldn't See Burks For Trees
Borrowing a page from Sparky Anderson's dog-earred book, Manager Buck Showalter was not going to let the opponent's best hitter beat him, no matter what the circumstance or inning of the game.
In the very first inning of tonight's game against the Chicago White Sox, the Yankees walked Frank Thomas intentionally.
The manager succeeded; Thomas did not beat the Yankees.
But Ellis Burks did -- after Thomas walked a second time.


Metropolitan Diary
DEAR DIARY:
After reading all those articles about the fatal dangers of a high-fat diet, I've decided that since I'm over 40 I should stop eating like a teen-ager.
After two months on the new regimen I went to a neighborhood coffee shop on 45th Street between Fifth and Madison.
Proud of myself, I ordered a salad with no dressing, a broiled piece of chicken and a plain baked potato.
The waitress hesitated, and after putting in the order came back to my table, looking very concerned.


Bosnian Croats Again Deny A Food Delivery to Muslims
Bosnian Croat leaders refused again today to allow a United Nations convoy deliver food to an estimated 55,000 Muslims who are reported near starvation in the eastern half of the city of Mostar.
Just hours after giving permission for the 19-truck convoy to deliver some 200 tons of food and medicine to eastern Mostar, the Bosnian Croats reneged, demanding first the return of the bodies of Croatian militiamen killed in the fighting that has raged in the city since early May.


The Nicaraguan Tragicomedy
The sad recent history of Nicaragua has turned into a tragicomic opera in the past week.
Leftover militants from each side of the civil war of the 80's have taken hostages, and dozens of people are still being detained by both groups.
It started last Thursday when Jose Angel Talavera, the leader of a "re-contra" group calling itself Northern Command 3-80, invited a delegation that included two Sandinista legislators to talk about reintegrating his disaffected followers into civilian life.
It was a ruse.
Mr.
Talavera's group took at least 38 members of the delegation hostage, demanding that President Violeta Chamorro dismiss a prominent Sandinista, army chief Humberto Ortega, from her Government, along with Minister of the Presidency Antonio Lacayo.


Duckens Likely to Enter a Drug Program
MARK DUCKENS, the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive end, is expected to enter a drug-treatment program and avoid conviction on charges that he conspired with Giants offensive guard ERIC MOORE to distribute steroids.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; A Fast Change in The World of Fast Food: Hardee's Decides to Divide Its Account.
CHOMP!
Chomp!

That's the sound of a fast-food feeding frenzy among hungry agencies.
The dinner bell was heard yesterday with the unexpected announcement that Hardee's Food Systems Inc. and the flagship New York office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide would end their relationship on the estimated $75 million Hardee's account.
Ogilvy New York and Hardee's, the nation's fourth-largest fast feeder in revenues as ranked by Nation's Restaurant News magazine, described their split after eight and a half years as a mutual decision.
The breakup came, they said, after Hardee's determined that it would rather divide the account into creative and media portions than have Ogilvy New York handle it all.

NBC's O'Neil Is Said to Have Been Ousted
Despite reports last week that TERRY O'NEIL had resigned as the executive producer of NBC Sports to join an investor group trying to buy a sports franchise, he was apparently dismissed during contract talks, according to television industry sources.

But he subsequently said he wanted to renegotiate.

Open Positions on Short Sales Are 5% Higher on Nasdaq
The number of Nasdaq shares sold short and not yet covered rose to another record high in the latest month, as more traders placed bets that prices would tumble.
The National Association of Securities Dealers reported yesterday that the short interest in Nasdaq stocks climbed 5 percent, to 587.4 million shares, from 558.4 million shares a month earlier.
The figure includes trades through Aug. 6.
The figure has risen 39 percent the last year.

Arrest Made In Slayings In Brooklyn
A parolee who served prison sentences for manslaughter and burglary was arrested yesterday by New York City detectives who said he was the gunman wielding a 9-millimeter pistol that killed four people and wounded two others in several incidents in Brooklyn this month.
The suspect, identified as Eban Robbins, 32, of Brooklyn, was described by Chief of Detectives Joseph R. Borrelli as a man feared in his neighborhood as a crack addict who becomes "pretty violent and loses control" after using drugs.


Some Are Looking for Crime; Michael Jackson Sees a Plot
If nothing else, this summer is keeping Hollywood's gossip mills churning.
First it was the uproar over Heidi Fleiss, the alleged madam to the rich and famous.
Now it's Michael Jackson, the childlike pop singer who has tongues wagging.
Mr.
Jackson was in Thailand today, opening his latest world tour, "Dangerous." But back in California, the Los Angeles Police Department searched his ranch in Santa Ynez, near Santa Barbara, and his condominium in Los Angeles on Saturday, looking for evidence -- if a local television report is accurate -- that he had abused a child.


From China to America, Via Moscow
It's well known that illegal Chinese immigrants are being smuggled into the United States by boat, by air and over land.
What is still virtually unknown is that a number of the estimated 100,000 Chinese being smuggled here each year are routed first through Moscow.
If the U.S. ever hopes to stop this flow, it must develop a comprehensive international policy to thwart the smuggling closer to its source.
"We have information that Moscow is a very important staging area, one of the more important in Europe," said Jeannette L. Chu, who coordinates Chinese alien smuggling investigations involving air travel and land crossings for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.


Review/Music; The Contemporary at Tanglewood
Evaluating a contemporary music festival is a little like reading tea leaves: there is always the risk of making too much of too little.
In the works of young composers, questing ears seek the promise of development; in the works of mature composers, they seek the insights and subtleties of familiar languages; in the festival as a whole, they seek signs of the times, hints of what is yet to come as this most peculiar 20th-century institution, the contemporary-music festival, evolves.
On those counts, at least on paper, the festival at Tanglewood offers encouraging prospects.
The composer Oliver Knussen, the festival's director, has typically presented an eclectic sampling of new music during his seven-year tenure.
For his final season, he split the activities in two, beginning earlier this month with a series of concerts centered on works by Alexander Goehr.
The second half, which began on Sunday night and will extend through Thursday, includes a recently composed Chamber Symphony by John Adams, a rare performance of Stockhausen's "Gruppen fur Drei Orchester," and the American premiere of Peter Lieberson's "King Gesar." Mr.
Knussen has also scheduled, for the first time, works by students at the Tanglewood Music Center, composers in their 20's who are beginning to find their own voices and styles.


AT DINNER WITH: Leslie Nielsen; For His Hamlet, A Whoopee Cushion, Not a Skull
COULD this be the once-elegant Leslie Nielsen?
Inside the restaurant, waiters didn't know whether to eject the actor or to dissolve in embarrassed laughter.

A movie actor making such undignified noises!
Mickey Rourke might do this, but here was the cinematic captain of the S.S.

"I've done it on almost every network, at the White House, in Japan, Denmark, Holland, Australia," he said.

Sure, Italians Make Westerns. But in Russia?
Enzo G. Castellari, a director of 36 films, including spaghetti westerns of the kind that made Clint Eastwood famous, is beside himself with rapture.
After all those years, he sighs, and on a Russian army base of all places, he finally has a Wild West village of his own.
"Before, I always had one used in a thousand other films," he said.
"It was always somebody else's design, Sergio Leone's or somebody. But at last," he continued, gesturing expansively around the muddy streets and raw lumber buildings marked Feed and Grain and Saloon, "at last, this is my village, this one's mine, the design, the details."


In Nicaragua, Fewer Hostages but Same Demands
Rearmed former rebels in northern Nicaragua released most of the hostages they have been holding early today, but held fast to their most important captives and to their demands for the dismissal of the country's Defense Minister and other officials.

Press Is Tough on Democratic Presidents
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 13 front-page news analysis of Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s suicide states, "It defies credibility to suggest that the Clinton Administration has taken anything resembling the pounding from political opponents or from the news media that other Administrations have endured." You note that President Johnson's term after the 1964 election was crippled by the Vietnam War and that President Nixon's second term was cut short by the Watergate scandal.


Craft Nearing Mars Sends Back Only Silence, and Hope Dwindles
The Mars Observer spacecraft failed yesterday to transmit any radio signals from its scheduled rendezvous with Mars, leaving disappointed flight controllers even more in the dark about the condition and whereabouts of their interplanetary phantom and diminishing the prospects of success for the $1 billion mission to explore the planet that has always fascinated humans.
"We've come up negative on our search for a signal," a flight director reported to mission officials late yesterday afternoon, minutes after the craft should have been announcing the completion of firing its rockets to swing over the icy north polar cap into orbit around Mars.
Hoping It Followed Orders
With the continuing loss of communications, which began mysteriously on Saturday, project engineers did not know if the craft automatically put itself into orbit but could not report this because of some transmitter failure, or whether it simply cruised by the planet on a trajectory back around the Sun.
In either case, the mission, the first to Mars by an American craft since 1976, would be a total loss if communications could not be restored.


N.F.L. TRAINING CAMP REPORT
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Keith McCants, considered by many to be the best defensive prospect in the 1990 draft, was released yesterday after three mostly unproductive seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The linebacker-turned-defensive end from Alabama returned to linebacker this summer, but Coach Sam Wyche said the 25-year-old McCants no longer fits into Tampa Bay's defensive scheme, which relies more on linebackers who can cover receivers than run-stop and pass-rush specialists like the 6-foot-3-inch, 265-pound McCants.


Ruling Frees Phone Concerns To Enter Cable TV Business
A Federal court in Virginia today cleared the way for telephone companies to provide television programming over their networks, overturning a Federal prohibition and setting the stage for a billion-dollar competition in the video marketplace.
The decision, handed down by the United States District Court in Alexandria, is certain to be appealed, but it still has broad implications for the telecommunications industry.
If it is upheld, the decision could lead to a full-blown race between the telephone and cable television industries, both of which want to provide hundreds of channels of television, on-line shopping and two-way communications services over fiber optic networks.


Merging of Fortunes for the Fan and the Hockey Star
Hockey first brought them together in 1977, when Brian Mullen was a 15-year-old stickboy for the Rangers and Chris Donohue was a 14-year-old Rangers fan who would sneak into Madison Square Garden to root for his favorite team.
Sixteen years later, Mullen, who grew up in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan and who skated all the way to the National Hockey League, and Donohue, who grew up in Washington Heights and who never stopped rooting for the Rangers, have been reunited by personal tragedies.


Sentence in Break-Ins
A black man who said that he was beaten in a racial attack by a group of Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights last December was sentenced yesterday to two years in prison for criminal trespass and petty larceny in a separate case.
Before Ralph Nimmons, 26, was sentenced in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, his lawyer, Paul Lieberman, contended that Mr.
Nimmons had been treated differently because of his involvement in the highly publicized Crown Heights incident.
But Justice Carolyn DeMarest responded that the crimes for which he was sentenced yesterday, stemming from two separate break-ins at a Crown Heights apartment building last February, were "more egregious" than Mr.
Lieberman said.


Joan Rivers, Daily Shopper
An alliance between the QVC cable-shopping channel and Tribune Entertainment will bring a daily home-shopping program, starring Joan Rivers, to the broadcast-syndication market starting in January, the companies said yesterday.
The hourlong weekday program -- to be called "Can We Shop?" -- will be offered to stations free, and they will also share in profits from products sold on the show.
In addition, the programs will carry commercials.

Dr.

The cause was AIDS-related, said Judith Walz, a longtime friend.


Palestinian Critics Accuse Arafat Of Secret Concessions to Israelis
After three decades of steering the P.L.O. almost single-handedly, Yasir Arafat is coming under increasing criticism from other Palestinian leaders who accuse him of making new concessions to Israel without consulting them.
Mr.
Arafat, who for years has been seen as Israel's implacable foe and whose organization was prevented by Israel from officially taking part in peace talks, is now being charged with being too willing to strike deals with the Labor Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.


Nassau Urges Courts to Sentence Graffiti Vandals to Cleanup Jobs
It winds its way along the south wall of the Long Island Rail Road embankment at Sunrise Highway in Bellmore, a serpentine splash of letters in blue, red, black and green spelling out "ELF," "BURNT," "ABONE" and other code names, graffiti signatures all painted by teen-agers.
Many of the vandals carry cameras, snapping photos of their work and placing them in scrapbooks that they take to school to show their friends.


Braves Give First-Place Giants That Shrinking Feeling
The San Franciso Giants did not move to Florida, but they still might be headed south.
What was a 10-game lead over Atlanta in the National League West one month ago is now only five and a half games.
The Braves cleared the right-field fence three times this afternoon, did a superior job flipping down their sunglasses and won, 6-4, for the second time in 16 hours.

Shaq Attack Is Unveiled in Tokyo
Forget finesse.
Forget subtlety.
When SHAQUILLE O'NEAL met the Japanese news media for the first time yesterday, the subject was breaking backboards.
And how to dunk.
"I've broken five backboards and fractured one," O'Neal, in Tokyo as part of a promotional tour for Reebok, told a standing-room-only crowd consisting mostly of Japanese reporters.
"And I plan to do it a couple times more."


Doing Jobs Citizens 'Would Never Do'
Miguel Morales, a Mexican day laborer, knows that many Southern Californians see him as a symbol of the region's problems.
But he says he is just filling the jobs that Americans spurn and as such is both needed and disdained.
Mr.
Morales, 24, recalls the recent day he and six other Mexicans earned $5 an hour each to scoop mud out of a house in the hills that was flooded when a water main burst.
"We do all the hard work," Mr.
Morales said in an interview in Spanish.
An American, he said, "would never do hard work like that for $5 an hour. They get paid $7 or $8 an hour for the kind of work we do."

Mentally Ill Homeless Man Goes to Bridgeport
Larry Hogue, a mentally ill homeless man who for years frightened residents of the Upper West Side, was released from a Queens psychiatric center yesterday with the understanding that he would not have to return if he stays drug free and does not cause trouble.
Mr.
Hogue, 49 years old, left the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center with his lawyer and headed for his new home in Bridgeport, Conn., where he will live with his son and three grandchildren.
"I just want to get the hell away from here and go to the beach with my grandkids," he said before driving off with his lawyer, C. Vernon Mason.

News Corp. Profit Surges
The News Corporation reported yesterday that its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 had more than tripled.
The media company, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said its net income surged to $153.2 million, or 67 cents a share, compared with $47.9 million, or 18 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago.


Personal Health
MOST patients with Lyme disease are cured by a single round of antibiotic therapy at an early stage, but the small number who nevertheless become chronically ill may find their lives thrown into disarray by devastating symptoms.
Those plagued by fatigue and pain may be forced to stop working.
Others have to find jobs that are part time or less taxing physically or intellectually and that usually involve lower pay.
Women may fear pregnancy because the spirochete that causes the disease could damage an unborn child.


Food Notes
A Tomato Cornucopia
Can anyone remember a summer when the tomatoes have been better?
The weather has been a crucial factor, but there also seems to be more variety than ever in the tomato bins at farm stands, in Greenmarkets and in fancy produce shops.
The assortment ranges from tiny, currant-size sugar-sweet yellow tomatoes, perfect for nibbling with a glass of white wine, to massive Jersey beefsteak beauties, as meaty as their name implies and excellent for slicing in thick slabs and searing on a hot grill.


2 IRAQI DIPLOMATS DEFECT IN BRITAIN
Iraq's Ambassador to Canada and the former Ambassador to Tunisia said today that they were deserting the Government of President Saddam Hussein, and joining other Iraqi exiles pledged to the overthrow of the Baghdad leadership.
The defections of the two senior diplomats bring to five the number of Iraqi ambassadors who have defected from Iraq since the Persian Gulf war ended in February of 1991.

The A.T.&amp;T. Deal's Big Losers
Few companies may be more threatened by A.T.&amp; T.'s $12.6 billion pact to buy the country's biggest cellular carrier than the seven regional Baby Bell telephone companies.
But just when it might be worth putting up a united front, the Bells are deeply split over how to respond -- and in some cases seem to be working at cross-purposes.
They also disagree on technical issues, and that could make it hard for them to match the American Telephone and Telegraph Company on advanced new services.


Abbott Comes Out and Bullpen Comes Apart
Buck Showalter had seen enough of Frank Thomas for one night and enough of Frank Thomas against Jim Abbott for a lifetime.
So when Thomas was striding to the plate with the score tied and the potential lead run on first base in the seventh inning, Showalter walked to the mound to replace Abbott with rookie Bobby Munoz.
The strategy failed miserably.
Munoz fired one fastball past Thomas and then tossed four out of the strike zone to walk him.
The Yankees did not want Thomas to beat them.
Fine.
Instead, Ellis Burks followed by ripping a misplaced 0-1 fastball off the left-center field fence for a two-run double that vaulted the White Sox to a 4-2 victory over the Yankees tonight at Comiskey Park.


Saudis Without Dollars
Remember when economists stayed up nights worrying about how the world would ever be able to recycle Saudi Arabia's huge petrodollar surpluses?
Today's worry in Washington, as Times reporters documented in a pair of articles this week, is about the dangers that flow from Saudi Arabia's equally huge deficits.
Financial reserves that less than a decade ago totaled $121 billion have melted away, spent on lavish social programs, eccentric development schemes, subsidies to domestic and foreign friends of the Saudi royal family -- and weapons.
Since the Persian Gulf war, the largest share has been going to weapons, especially those bought from the United States.

Market Place; Airline stocks rising as investors detect numerous positive factors.
IN the muggy days of late August, a flight somewhere -- anywhere that's cooler -- is the stuff of daydreams.
So maybe it was in pursuit of a vicarious vacation that deskbound investors loaded up on airline stocks in recent days.
Another and perhaps better explanation for the modest rally begins with the fact that in this record-setting market, otherwise small blips on Wall Street's radar screen can loom large, particularly for fund managers looking for direction as they move into more cyclical stocks.
"A lot of people are looking for a place to go," said Raymond E. Neidl, airline analyst at Furman Selz.

The Nines Arrive -- Too Fast
When he reversed himself and authorized New York City police officers to carry semiautomatic handguns, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly cited departmental tests.
But when pressed, he couldn't rely on much hard information about the use of those guns -- for a very good reason.
There isn't much.
And that's the problem.
If the experiments in New York, and experience elsewhere, could allay strong reservations about their safety in this crowded, high-pressure city, fine.
But the city police department has conducted only limited tests, and the statistics from other cities whose police departments use 9-millimeter semiautomatics are spotty.


New Charges Give U.S. 2d Chance to Try Kahane Suspect
A wide-ranging conspiracy indictment returned yesterday gives prosecutors a second chance to try El Sayyid A. Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant who was acquitted in the 1990 killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane in a jury verdict that the judge denounced as "against the overwhelming weight of evidence" and "devoid of common sense and logic."
Mr.
Nosair, who has been serving time in the Attica state prison on gun possession and assault charges arising from the Kahane killing, was charged yesterday with murdering the rabbi to bolster his position in an organization involved in racketeering.


No. 1 Pick Is No. 2 on Depth Chart
When the Jets made Marvin Jones their No. 1 draft pick, and the fourth player taken over all, he was expected to have a chance to break into the starting lineup in place of Kyle Clifton at middle linebacker.
But the 6-foot-2-inch, 240-pound Jones, an all-American out of Florida State, staged a salary holdout that did not end until the day before the first preseason game, at Pittsburgh on Aug. 7.
He signed a five-year, $6 million pact and dressed but did not play against the Steelers.


Terrorist Acts Can't Stop Quest for Peace; Jewish Survival
To the Editor:
Milton Viorst operates under a misconception in "Sharing Jerusalem" (Op-Ed, Aug. 19) when he wonders if Israel wouldn't be better off without having to rule 100,000 unhappy Palestinians.
Israel's ultimate goal is not conquest, nor is it peace.
Its most essential purpose, articulated by every Zionist leader of the last century, is to be a safe haven and home for worldwide Jewry.
Israel's loftiest goal is to be that place, not to make Palestinians happy.


Philip Morris Stock Drops in Selloff
An announcement by the Philip Morris Companies yesterday that its quarterly dividend would remain at 65 cents a share prompted a selloff of its stock, which fell $2.25, to $48.875.
The stock traded as low as $47.875, and more 7.5 million shares changed hands, making it the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange.


Arts Vigilantes Find a New Quarry to Pursue; Everyone Is an Artist
To the Editor:
Reading your report that three experimental artists are handing out $10 bills to illegal immigrants from Mexico (front page, Aug. 12), I felt shortchanged.
To David Avalos, one of the three federally supported artists, "the act of giving the money is a work of art." Really?
As a sculptor, and not a particularly conservative one, I am insulted by the readiness of people to call themselves and others artists and their acts works of art.
Is anyone who applies a Band-Aid a physician?
Anyone who fixes an outlet an electrician?
Anyone who takes a holiday in August a psychiatrist?


Man Slain After Robbery at Gambling Den
A man was shot and killed last night as he and three others fled from a gambling den in Chinatown that they robbed, the police said.

Review/Pop; Tears for Fears, Part 2, From Plural to Singular
Ten years ago, the English pop duo Tears for Fears caught the world's ear with music that infused the mechanized drone of technopop with echoes of the late-1960's Beatles.
Like John Lennon, Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith, who formed the duo, were intrigued by the primal-scream theories of Arthur Janov.
Their most famous song, "Shout," a catchy all-purpose exorcism of adolescent pain, became a popular sing-along at concerts.
A decade and three successful albums later, Mr.
Orzabal, the duo's principal songwriter, has gone solo, keeping the name Tears for Fears for himself.
He recently released an album, "Elemental" (Fontana), whose song lyrics and oracular style bear the Tears for Fears signature.
And on Tuesday evening, he appeared at Town Hall with a five-member band to perform his recent songs (most of them written with a new collaborator, Alan Griffith), along with a selection of Tears for Fears hits.


In The Studio With Roger Tory Peterson; Reluctant Earthling
ROGER TORY PETERSON, author of "A Field Guide to the Birds," has often thought how lovely life would be as an albatross.
"They can wander the oceans of the world," he mused at his studio here, his limpid blue eyes lost in a faraway look.
But born as he was into another class of vertebrates, he was forced to rely on mass transportation and was destined, it seems, to admire birds -- every last one -- from the ground.
He can wax poetic about pigeons and even has kind words for vultures.
"Vultures are homely, but they clean up all the garbage and that's good," he said.
"And they're elegant in the sky."


Another Hope to Save Mars Craft Is Dashed
Another critical moment for the $1 billion Mars Observer mission came and went yesterday in frustrating silence.

Charlie Ward Is a Point Guard in Pads
As Charlie Ward learned the intricacies of playing quarterback at Florida State a season ago, his coaches were learning something about him.
He was making mistakes -- eight interceptions in the first two games -- but he was also making up for them.
His errors led to a discovery.
A sense of desperation led to innovation.
The evolution of Florida State's fast-break offense, driven by the quarterback's combination of athletic skill and decision-making ability, has given Ward a chance to make the greatest impact of any multisport athlete at the college level in recent years.

Rhode Island's Top Judge, Facing Ethics Charges, Leaves the Bench
The Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court was accused Tuesday of using his position to funnel legal work to a business partner, and he stepped down from the bench today until the case is resolved.

LOS ANGELES has its Watts Towers.

What these structures have in common is that they were built by self-taught artists.
Religious grottoes of concrete, embedded with stones and shards of glass and built by priests, are scattered throughout the upper Midwest, as are parks filled with concrete sculptures of Paul Bunyan and of American Indians, made by farmers.
"Sacred Spaces and Other Places: The Artist in the Landscape of the Upper Midwest," a show of 500 photographs, paintings and artifacts, runs tomorrow through Oct. 13 at the Betty Rymer Gallery at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.


Cruel Flood: It Tore at Graves, and at Hearts
When the Missouri River barreled through town like white-water rapids this summer, and grain bins and City Hall and the Assembly of God church and houses and barns gave way and there were no telephones or electricity or running water, people in this tiny farm town thought they knew all about the power of nature.
Then the unthinkable happened.
The river washed away about two-thirds of the graves at the cemetery where just about anybody who ever lived and died here was buried.
The river carved out a crater 50 feet deep where the cemetery used to be.
It took cottonwood trees and the brick entryway and carried close to 900 caskets and burial vaults downstream toward St.
Louis and the Mississippi.


American Vanguardists Find Audience in Europe
The 1960's and 70's were the golden age for American performers to find work in Europe.
Conservative American arts institutions stifled the vanguardists, while the underdeveloped American regional opera scene forced singers abroad.
Now, even with the lingering recession at home, American singers can find work with American companies and the evolution of trendy performance spaces around the United States has created a network for contemporary musicians, theater directors, choreographers and performance artists.
At the same time, the recession in Europe, combined with the development of local talent and an increasingly nativist attitude, has curtailed job offers here for Americans.
Yet Americans still do get overseas, and not just high-profile directors like Robert Wilson.
Two interesting, veteran New York performance artists, Connie Beckley and Joan Jonas, appeared in France and Germany in June, while all season long Mr.
Wilson has been busy with new European projects.

Future Face of Berlin Awaits a Fateful Month
A series of decisions to be made next month could change the face of Berlin for years to come.

Cutoffs would probably lead to the closing of both institutions.


Ketchum Executive To Join TV Venture
William B. Perkins, president at the New York office of Ketchum Advertising for the last 16 months, said yesterday that he would leave to join a company that hopes to bring television programming -- and commercials -- to the food courts of large shopping malls.

He joins two other former New York agency executives, Bob Lenz, chairman, who was a founding partner at Backer Spielvogel Bates, and Stephen G. Bowen Jr., president and chief executive, who was president and chief executive at Geer, DuBois when that shop closed in April.


Bond Prices Head Higher Despite Traders' Reluctance
Bond traders on Wall Street are not enthusiastic about the market.
They think that prices have moved too high and yields too low.
But that has not stopped the other buyers -- the portfolio managers with cash on hand and the money managers scrambling for alternatives because the mortgage-backed securities they invested in are suddenly being paid off as more homeowners refinance at lower interest rates.
Also, states and cities are buying Treasuries for accounts they set up to pay off old, higher interest rate bonds, now that they can borrow anew at the lowest interest rates in two decades.


SPRINT INTRODUCES COMBINATION SERVICE
The Sprint Corporation yesterday became the first of the leading long-distance telephone carriers to introduce a nationwide high-speed communications service capable of carrying a combination of video, audio and data simultaneously.

Seneca Nation Files Suit To Reclaim Grand Island
Invoking a law from the Presidency of George Washington, the Seneca Nation of Indians filed suit in Federal District Court in Buffalo today seeking return of this 27-square-mile island in the Niagara River.
The Senecas claim that New York State's purchase of the island in 1815 violated a 1790 law requiring Federal approval for all Indian land transfers.
The suit seeks return of the entire island, now home to 17,561 people, and unspecified monetary compensation, said Joseph F. Crangle, the attorney representing the tribe.

Yeltsin 'Understands' Polish Bid for a Role in NATO
On his first visit to Poland as the leader of Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin was shown today how much this former Warsaw Pact nation wants to join the West, specifically NATO.
In the past, the Russians have expressed reservations about Poland's ambitions to join the alliance.
But in an appearance in the gardens of the presidential residence here, Mr.
Yeltsin and President Lech Walesa issued a joint statement that repeated Poland's desire for NATO membership and pointed to Mr.
Yeltsin's "understanding."

Parolee Is Arraigned in Two Brooklyn Shootings
Eban Robbins, a suspect in seven shootings with a 9-millimeter pistol earlier this month in Brooklyn, was linked yesterday to yet another killing, even as he was being arraigned in his hospital bed on murder and attempted murder charges.
The victim was identified by authorities as Anthony Butts, 27, a Brownsville construction worker.
Mr.
Butts was shot three times in the head about 2:30 A.M., Aug. 12 at Legion Street and Blake Avenue in Brownsville -- about 25 minutes after, and more than a dozen blocks away, from the scene of the shootings in Crown Heights with which Mr.
Robbins was charged yesterday.


Books of The Times; Reflecting Fashion Without Neglecting the Music
Benjamin Britten A Biography By Humphrey Carpenter Illustrated. 677 pages.
Charles Scribner's Sons. $30.
Benjamin Britten's music is in some ways an emblem of the 20th-century compositional predicament.
Britten was born in 1913, and his diaries and letters show that from an early age he was enthusiastic about certain avant-garde musical trends.
But although he used dissonance, angularity, contemporary orchestral coloration and even Serial techniques to expressive ends, his music was firmly tethered to the 19th-century tradition of lush textures and sweeping lyricism.


Stock Strategy Under Scrutiny
A small Midwestern investment firm earned at least $25 million in a few weeks by selling more shares than existed of a virtually worthless stock in trades that threatened the financial health of the Chicago Stock Exchange, according to documents, lawyers, traders and exchange officials.
The sales in May and June by the firm, the Scattered Corporation of Chicago, continued long after exchange officials realized the magnitude of the potential problem and even though they believed the firm was violating numerous trading rules.
Traders for Scattered ignored orders by the regional exchange that would have effectively halted its sales of shares in the LTV Corporation, which at the time was in bankruptcy.


Unhappiness by Itself Doesn't Cause Suicide
To the Editor:
Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s apparent suicide has exposed a popular myth about the reasons people commit suicide, captured in your Aug. 13 front page about life in Washington: "Is the pressure at the top levels of power in the city so intolerable that suicides are inevitable?" The notion that people commit suicide because they are merely unhappy or under stress is almost always wrong.


The House and the Hatch Act
An important test of character awaits the House when lawmakers return to the Capitol after Labor Day.
At issue is how far Congress will go in weakening important Hatch Act protections against partisan political activity in the Federal work force.
Different versions of Hatch Act reform have now passed the House and Senate.
Both go too far to please the Federal and postal unions, whose political action committees funnel millions of dollars to Congressional campaigns, mostly those of Democrats.


A Street Serenade for Strings


Qualifying for the Open Often a Matter of Luck
For Martin Blackman, it was a successful homecoming.
But for Jimmy Arias and Justin Gimelstob, yesterday's start of qualifying for the United States Open at the National Tennis Center was a painful reminder.
Gimelstob, from Essex Fells, N.J., the national 16-and-under champion, was playing in his first Open qualifying, against a world-class player, 10th-seeded Jeremy Bates of Britain.
Unbeaten (25-0) against his peers this year, Gimelstob bowed to Bates, 6-2, 6-2.


Terrorist Acts Can't Stop Quest for Peace; Jerusalem as Symbol
To the Editor:
In "Sharing Jerusalem" (Op-Ed, Aug. 19) Milton Viorst seeks a nontraditional solution to conflicting aspirations to Jerusalem.
But, especially in light of the exclusion of Jews from Eastern Jerusalem during 1948-67, any suggestion of territorial division is unlikely to command sufficient support in Israel.


A Memorable Summer for Children in the Bargain; Prime Camp Sites in Harriman State Park Leased to Nonprofit Groups at Cut Rates
Quietly scattered across this majestic, 47,000-acre public park are 35 summer camps that cannot really afford to be here.
That they are bustling with activity is a tribute to a longtime program in which nonprofit organizations, unable to purchase campsites of their own, are allowed to lease prime lakefront property at bargain-basement prices.

Anti-Beijing Message Mailed to Sponsors
A human rights group has taken its campaign against Beijing's Olympic bid directly to the people who would foot the bill for the Games.
Human Rights Watch said yesterday that it had sent letters to top officials of 17 international companies with strong sports-sponsorship records, urging them to help defeat the Beijing candidacy for the 2000 Games.
Citing the Chinese Government's record of political and religious repression -- specifically Tiananmen Square in 1989 and more recent arrests of pro-democracy activists -- the human rights group said a Beijing Olympics could backfire on companies trying to crack or expand in the world's largest market.

A Thin Volume by Perot Puts No Stock in Trade
The first copies of Ross Perot's forthcoming book on the North American Free Trade Agreement have begun circulating among trade specialists here, provoking a flurry of meetings within the Clinton Administration today as officials began drafting responses to the book's criticism of the accord.
Mr.
Perot, the Texas businessman and Presidential aspirant, is waging a personal crusade against the trade pact.
In his often-repeated comment, now a chapter title in the book, approval of the accord would be followed by a "a giant sucking sound" -- American jobs being drained into Mexico.

Dow Gains 13.13 to Reach Another High
Stocks traversed record territory yesterday for the second consecutive day, fueled by gains in cyclical issues, which are among the first to benefit in an economic recovery, and lower interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 13.13 points, to 3,652.09.
It was the sixth time in seven trading sessions that the Dow closed at a new high.


Northrop Chooses BBDO Los Angeles

Chancellor's Search Troubled As One Finalist Withdraws
One finalist in the search for a new schools chancellor for New York City has abruptly withdrawn from consideration and another has said he will not show up for a scheduled interview tomorrow with the city's Board of Education, raising new uncertainties in the final days of the board's six-month search.
Dr.
Walter G. Amprey, the Superintendent in Baltimore announced his withdrawal in a letter to the board on Tuesday.
Hours later, Dr.
John A. Murphy, the Superintendent of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools in North Carolina, told the chairman of his local school board that he would not be interviewed for the New York chancellorship after his local board awarded him a $44,000 increase in his compensation package.


CBS Makes Its Peace With Cable As Power Shifts in the TV Industry
In a striking demonstration of how the balance of power in television has shifted from the broadcasters to the cable industry, CBS has joined the other networks in abandoning demands that cable systems make large payments in order to carry the programs of network-owned stations.
Federal legislation that was passed last year allowed the networks and other broadcasters to demand cash from cable operators for their broadcast signals.
The cable industry refused, threatening to drop the broadcast stations.


Cable and Phone Companies: Foes or Allies?
The question of who will build and control the "information superhighway" to deliver interactive television, hundreds of channels and telephone service to the consumer's home in the future, has long been regarded as a pitched battle between the giant local telephone and cable television monopolies.
But if a Federal court decision on Tuesday is upheld, it is likely to usher in an era of cooperation between the two industries that can be expected to vastly change telecommunications competition.
Such cooperation could accelerate the use of interactive television and other services.
It might lower the fearsome price for replacing today's limited-capacity phone system with an advanced fiber-optic network, a price estimated at $275 billion -- more than $3,000 a household.


Braves Turn Pressure Up With 3-Game Sweep
Dusty Baker, the only manager in the major leagues who wears sweatbands, has use for them now.
The Atlanta Braves beat Baker's Giants, 9-1, at Candlestick Park today, completing a three-game sweep and moving within four and a half games of first-place San Francisco in the National League West.
It's the closest the Braves have been to first since May 31.
The teams will play their last three games against each other next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in Atlanta.


Shipping Company Assessed Largest Election Fine Ever
State and local officials have levied an $895,000 fine against a foreign-owned shipping company that admitted funneling laundered money to dozens of politicians since 1989, including the gubernatorial campaigns of Gov.
Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein.
Officials said the fine on Tuesday against the Evergreen America Corporation was the largest for a political ethics violation in the nation's history.
The previous record, also in California, was $292,500 in 1988 against William Bryan, a Sacramento County Supervisor, for failure to disclose economic interests.


PARENT &amp; CHILD
ADULTS live in a world of delayed gratification.
Our paychecks come days or weeks after we've done the work.
We put in many hours practicing musical instruments or driving golf balls to improve our performance.
We wait until the end of a meal to savor dessert, or shun it so that we can lose five pounds by the end of the month.
Investments of time and effort come much harder to young children.
Toddlers and preschoolers often appear to live by the motto "I want it, and I want it now!" Given the choice between eating one jelly bean immediately and getting two jelly beans 10 minutes later, many young children find they just can't wait.

A sampling of replica knobs (from top left to bottom right) includes an 18th-century-style gray knob ($8), a Craftsman-style oak knob ($1.75) and Victorian glass knobs in clear or red ($8.25 to $11.50).


State Dept. Balkan Aides Explain Why They Quit
It was the kind of gut-wrenching cable that came across Jon Western's State Department desk every day for almost a year: a 9-year-old Muslim girl raped by Serbian fighters, then left in a pool of blood while her parents watched helplessly from behind a fence for two days before she died.
"This was pretty indicative of the type of things we were getting on a daily basis," Mr.

2 Studies Report Heart Care Lags for Blacks
Black Americans are far less likely than whites to receive bypass surgery or other advanced treatments for heart disease and are also more likely to suffer heart attacks, two new studies have found.
Doctors based at the Pittsburgh Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center found that among veterans who were treated for heart ailments, white males were much more likely to receive advanced X-ray imaging, undergo a balloon procedure for opening clogged arteries and have bypass surgery.


Picture This: Unfaded Snaps
PHOTOGRAPHS and other mementos often fade faster than the memories they're supposed to preserve.
Most of us have been unpleasantly surprised to find that color snapshots taken several vacations ago now look amber and that clippings in old scrapbooks give a new meaning to yellow journalism.
These changes are caused by chemical deterioration, which can be brought on by a host of substances.
The best way to avert the damage is to be aware of the usual suspects.
Many household materials -- glue, masking and cellophane tapes and wood products -- contain sulfur and other substances that can do harm.
So if you have stowed pictures in a shoe box or wooden drawer, remove them now.
You can stash them more safely in a metal file cabinet or stainless-steel container.


The Last Guffaw: Mets Are Eliminated
Late during yesterday afternoon's game, when the Mets' Bobby Bonilla caught an easy pop-up, the fans at Shea Stadium hooted.
A few minutes later, when Bonilla's ninth-inning home run averted a shutout in a 4-1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, those remaining from the crowd of 19,483 offered a halfhearted cheer.
Bonilla's home run raised his season total to 29.
His three errors at third base boosted his total in that department to 14.
On a sultry day, on which the Mets were officially eliminated from the National League East race, Bonilla's goofs helped symbolize a season of organization-wide mistakes.

CHRONICLE
PETER L. MALKIN, a lawyer who is the chairman of the Grand Central and 34th Street Partnerships, and DONALD JONAS, the chairman of Lechters, the housewares chain, are lifelong friends.
So when one agreed to give $2,000 to the New York City Police Foundation, the other also gave $2,000.
The money is to pay for two mounted police horses, as an element in the city's efforts to curb crime by making the police presence more visible.
But the friends made their gifts conditional, asking that the horses be named for their mothers, GERTRUDE MALKIN and BESSIE JONAS, who have been friends for 60 years.


U.N. Counts on U.S. Rangers to Find Warlord
After more than two months of guerrilla attacks against United Nations peacekeepers, their commanders say the arrival of 400 elite United States Army troops Thursday will not only help in the capture of a fugitive clan leader but will also be critical in regaining control of the streets of Mogadishu.
The deployment of the Rangers is part of a move by the United Nations to capture Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, who has stymied the United Nations mission here, officials say.

New Format Stores Films On CD Disks
Four of the world's leading consumer electronics companies said today that they had agreed on technical specifications for a new product that would play movies stored on compact disks.

The promised format suggests that there will be a new and potentially confusing battle for consumer dollars.


Film Festival '93: An Emphasis On the Epic, as Seen Personally
The New York Film Festival, now in its 31st year, will lead off on Oct. 1 with Robert Altman's "Short Cuts," a three-hour panorama of life in contemporary Los Angeles that is based on the short stories of Raymond Carver, and close two and a half weeks later with "The Piano," Jane Campion's bizarre love story set in 19th-century New Zealand.
The Campion film, to be shown on Oct. 17, shared the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in May with Chen Kaige's "Farewell, My Concubine," which will also be shown here.
The festival comprises 32 films, which will be shown at Alice Tully Hall.
About half the films are from the United States, France and Britain.
In a departure from past festivals, Eastern Europe and Latin American film makers are barely present, their place usurped by film makers from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.


With a Boom in the Desert Over, Transplants Are Feeling Stranded
The desert that stretches east from Los Angeles shimmers with mirages: brand-new cities like this one that replicate the Southern California ideal, with miles of identical single-family homes, each with its small green lawn and two-car garage.
Just three or four years ago, riding the California boom, these homes were being built so fast that the newcomers sometimes had nowhere to shop.
The area became known as the Inland Empire -- San Bernardino and Riverside Counties -- the most rapidly growing region in the United States.


Critic's Notebook; In Aspen, a Metaphor for Change
No question, the fascinating $7 million Joan and Irving Harris Concert Hall of the Aspen Music Festival and School, which opened over the weekend in Aspen, Colo., and is to conclude its dedicatory series this evening, stands as a metaphor.
But a metaphor for what, exactly?
"The hall is for our students to rehearse and perform in," Ms.

"The building becomes the symbol, because it's more than a building; it's a metaphor for the faith and planning for the future of the music school and festival."

HOME IMPROVEMENT
REMODELING a home for the convenience of elderly or physically disabled people takes thorough planning and usually the skills of an architect and a contractor who specialize in such projects.
But many adaptations can be made by amateurs who have moderate remodeling or home-repair experience.
Accessibility for elderly or disabled people in private homes is not required by law.
But if homeowners want to make adaptations, most local building inspectors suggest they follow the Uniform Federal Accessibilities Standards, the Government's guidelines for public buildings.

WHERE TO FIND IT
CROWN MACHINE SERVICE, George Grossman's cluttered repair shop on the Upper West Side, offers a concise history of the sewing machine.
In the back sits a tiny Singer, circa 1900.
Nearby is a 1993 computerized sewing machine.
And on adjoining shelves are portables from almost every decade in between.
"Most older machines can be put back in working order," said Mr.
Grossman, who opened the store more than 30 years ago.
Motors can be replaced or rebuilt.
Parts that are no longer made can often be cannibalized from the shop's collection of aging sewing machines.
Most repairs cost less than $100, Mr.
Grossman said, while new machines cost $139 to more than $3,000.


Cardboard Comeback
GREAT furniture never dies.
It is reissued.
In 1972, Frank Gehry, the architect, introduced "The Easy Edges," 25 tables and chairs made of bonded corrugated cardboard.
The pieces were graphic, sturdy and inexpensive -- $35 to $100.
The line was discontinued the next year, only to come back in 1993.
"I'm always interested in materials where there's so much denial," Mr.
Gehry said.
"People used cardboard for throwaway boxes but not in their consciousness."


Economy Of Stops And Starts
In this stop-and-go economy, as soon as one engine starts to rev up, another seems to sputter.
That was borne out in new data released today: Sales of existing homes spurted 5.4 percent in July to the highest level since December, the National Association of Realtors said, but the Commerce Department reported that factory orders for big-ticket items like cars and planes fell an unexpectedly hard 3.98 percent last month.
The drop was the sharpest in 19 months and indicated that manufacturing, stuck in a rut for months, was not near a rebound.

Prosecutors Pick a Law From Past
The first charge in the 20-count indictment against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and his followers is a rarely used law banning seditious conspiracy, or plotting to overthrow the government.
By allowing prosecutors to charge a defendant with the broad crime of plotting against the Government, and avoiding the necessity of pinning a specific act of violence on an individual, the law enables prosecutors to seek longer sentences and to cast a wider legal net.


Review/Television; Seeing the Bright Side of Castro's Cuba
In the dear, dire days when there were two sides to the cold war, journalists of a certain bent ranged the world and brought back rhapsodies to countries like Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China and Sadinista Nicaragua.
When one such People's Paradise fell into disfavor, there was always another to celebrate.
Among the minor side effects of what tonight's offering in the "P.O.V." documentary series delicately calls "the collapse of the socialist camp" has been the drying up of that once rich vein of inspiration to television documentary producers.
But take heart: Cuba remains.
"Miami; Havana" begins with snatches of interviews on attitudes of Cuban-Americans in Miami toward their motherland and of Cubans in Cuba toward the United States.
Hard political lines and softer personal feelings are expressed on both sides.
The program's point of view is represented by Wayne Smith, a former State Department official in Havana and a longtime critic of American policy.
He wants an end to the economic embargo of Cuba and a resumption of normal relations.

Schools Aren't the Only Buildings With an Asbestos Problem
To the Editor:
While New York City has clearly botched carrying out the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, the procedures it outlines provide a prudent, conservative model for dealing with asbestos in all buildings.
Unfortunately, there is no law protecting the city's building occupants from asbestos.
When New York adopted its Asbestos Control Law of 1983, which regulated the disturbance of asbestos, the City Council appointed a commission to determine how to manage asbestos-containing materials in buildings.
After a two-year study that found that two-thirds of the city's buildings contain asbestos, the commission recommended legislation essentially extending the process developed under the asbestos act.


Ford Offers Union a Contract Plan
Leading off for the Big Three auto makers, the Ford Motor Company offered a 15-page contract proposal to the United Automobile Workers union today that addressed the concerns of the company, from controlling health care costs to freeing Ford to buy more components from nonunion plants.
While saying the negotiators were making significant progress, Ernest Lofton, the vice president of the U.A.W. who leads the union team at Ford, received the proposal coolly.


Bridge
When world championship play for the Bermuda Bowl begins on Sunday in Santiago, Chile, there will be four teams from Europe.
It happens that they are all from the northern half of the continent: Poland, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.
They finished in that order in the European Championships in Menton, France, two months ago, and their closest pursuers, in fifth and sixth positions, were Sweden and Iceland.
This was a surprising shutout of Britain, France and Italy, which have in the past dominated European play.
A victory by the maximum margin over the experienced Polish squad, to which the diagramed deal contributed, helped a young Dutch team to snatch the crucial fourth position and qualify for Santiago.
The Dutch North-South were Wubbo De Boer and Bauke Muller, and they climbed to six spades.
The double of one heart was negative, promising a four-card spade suit, and the eventual five-club bid in response to four no-trump showed three key-cards.


A Man and His Wishbone Call It Quits
EMORY BELLARD, the man who invented the wishbone offense that taunted college defenses in the late 1960's and 1970's, is retiring after 45 years of coaching.
But his offense isn't.
"It's still as viable as it ever was," Bellard said yesterday, beginning his final season as coach at Spring Westfield High School in Houston.
"It's as sound an offense, in my option, that's ever been devised."
Bellard first fielded his pet triple option as offensive coordinator at the University of Texas in 1968 and helped the Longhorns win national championships in 1969 and 1970.

The Texas Tech president, ROBERT LAWLESS, said Bockrath agreed on Monday to a five-year contract at $125,000 a year.
Jones, Tech's athletic director for eight years, resigned with more than 14 months remaining on a contract that paid him $107,112 annually.


Giuliani Faulted on Education Plans
Offering his vision of how to improve New York City schools, Rudolph W. Giuliani formally endorsed the breakup of the central Board of Education yesterday, but then came under attack for what one political opponent called a "180-degree flip-flop" on the issue.
His proposal appeared to be a reversal of his previous stance that breaking up the central board would only increase the bureaucracy.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, a Democrat who has proposed a similar breakup of the board, accused the Republican-Liberal candidate of reversing views that he offered as recently as July.

As a young man, my husband worked in manufacturing and installing asbestos products.
Many times he would grind it for making a paste.

These operations took place when there was no knowledge that asbestos was a hazard.
I believe industrial masks weren't even on the market in the late 1940's.

White Sox Throw Yet Another One the Yankees' Way
Joe Carter was probably sleeping by the time the Yankees and White Sox finished playing tonight, but the Yankees were thinking about the Toronto right-fielder.
They hoped he saw them beat the Chicago White Sox, 7-5, at Comiskey Park.
Carter claimed recently that the remaining schedule favored the Blue Jays because the Yankees still had to play the better teams in the American League West.
That is all Carter said.
He did not call the Yankees nasty names or make fun of their relatives, but his comments have circulated in the Yankee clubhouse and have made them an ornery bunch.

He will be driven by Jack Moiseyev as one of three horses to leave from a second tier in a field of 11 3-year-olds.
Presidential Ball's chief rival, Life Sign, drew the No. 11 post.

Avoiding a Values Test, County Cuts All Art Funds
Facing a proposal to limit arts financing to groups that support "community, family-oriented values," the Cobb County Commision here has voted instead to cut off all money for the arts next year.
The vote on Tuesday, coming after the commission's condemnation of homosexuality two weeks earlier, has turned up the volume again on a dispute over homosexuality and community values that has deeply divided this suburban county of 450,000 people north and west of Atlanta.

Three-Division Playoff Format Likely Next Year
Negotiations between baseball owners and players for expanded playoffs and three-division play very likely will be brief and successful, given the public positions of the two sides, and the new format should be implemented for the 1994 season.
Boston's John Harrington, chairman of the owners' schedule format committee, said today that the owners are prepared to move quickly to realign the National and American Leagues from two divisions each to three divisions each.
The Players Association has indicated it would approve an additional round in the pennant playoffs if the owners took that step.


Opposing Groups Free Last Hostages in Nicaragua
Captors freed the last of more than 70 hostages held by two rival groups tonight, Government officials said, bringing to an end a crisis that has shaken Nicaragua like no event since the country's civil war, which ended more than three years ago.
Nearly a week after some 38 members of a peacekeeping commission were seized by re-armed former contra rebels on Thursday, mediators said the last five of those captives were released in a remote northern village.

Reno Sees Growing Evidence and Makes Call
Two months after she turned down recommendations to charge Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman as a terrorist, Attorney General Janet Reno reversed herself and approved an indictment based on a broad approach to the case.
The indictment charges the sheik not with a direct role in any specific terrorist act, but with complicity in a conspiracy beginning with the shooting death of Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1989 and continuing through the World Trade Center bombing in February and the bombing and assassination plot uncovered in June.


U.S. INDICTS EGYPTIAN CLERIC AS HEAD OF GROUP PLOTTING 'WAR OF URBAN TERRORISM'
The Federal Government charged yesterday that Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, an Egyptian cleric known for his fiery Islamic sermons, led a terrorist group that orchestrated the World Trade Center bombing, a second plot to blow up New York City tunnels and buildings, and the 1990 killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the Jewish militant.
In a sweeping new indictment, a Federal grand jury for the first time linked those terror plots together, along with plans for murders, kidnappings and the bombing of American military installations.
Beginning as early as 1989, the indictment said, the men aimed "to levy a war of urban terrorism against the United States." Seditious Conspiracy Charged
Twelve men had already been arrested in the foiled plot to blow up the United Nations building, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, and the Manhattan offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The 27-page indictment tied that plan to others and brought in three new defendants: Mr.
Abdel Rahman; El Sayyid A. Nosair, who was charged with murdering Rabbi Kahane but acquitted; and Mohammed Abouhalima, the brother of one of the Trade Center bombing defendants.

Officials Assert Asbestos Tests Are Progressing
As the opening of classes approached, inspectors scouring New York City's public schools for asbestos made substantial progress yesterday, beginning inspections in 50 more schools and declaring 17 others ready to open on time on Sept. 9, officials said.
The officials with the agency heading the emergency effort, the city's School Construction Authority, also reported that inspectors had completed tests on eight schools and for the first time discovered no exposed asbestos, clearing these schools for opening without repairs or cleanup.

Ozone-Depleting Chemicals Building Up at Slower Pace
The buildup of the industrial chemicals most responsible for depleting the earth's protective ozone layer has slowed substantially, Government scientists are reporting today.
If the trend continues, they say, the buildup should stop before the end of the decade.
As a result, the worst of the ozone destruction should come around the turn of the century, when the peak load of chemicals, now slowly wafting upward, finally reaches the stratosphere, where ozone depletion occurs.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY  THE SHEIK IS CHARGED: CLERIC CALLED CENTER OF CONSPIRACY
The Federal Government charged that Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, an Egyptian cleric known for his fiery sermons, was at the center of a terrorist group that orchestrated the World Trade Center bombing, a second plot to blow up New York City tunnels and buildings and the 1990 killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane, a Jewish militant.

Freedom Is Relative
To The Home Section:
I'd love to embrace the argument of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum: that "labor-saving" machines just free women up for more dumb work ("The Age of Convenience, but for Whom?" Aug. 12).
But I remember my mother relaxing over coffee with her friends Gert and Zina while the new Westinghouse Laundromat churned away in a corner of the kitchen.
I also remember the grudging hours we spent hanging tons of damp wash in the backyard because we didn't have space or money for a dryer.


To Be Precise
Some time a little before 8 this past Monday morning -- was it Aug. 22 or 23?
It was the 23d -- while waiting for a pot of coffee to boil, we unfolded The Times and found an intriguing article near the bottom of the front page.
"Yardsticks Almost Vanish as Science Seeks Precision," said the smallish headline.
The story, by Malcolm W. Browne, explained that due to the scientific community's ever-growing need for precise standards, nearly all the measurements that affect daily life are being redefined in the language of quantum mechanics.
Where a meter used to be fixed as one-10-millionth of the distance from one of the earth's poles to the Equator, it's now measured as the distance that light travels in one-299,792,458th of a second.
Where a second was once one-60th of a minute, it's now clocked as the time it takes a microwave-excited cesium atom to vibrate 9,192,631,770 times.


Ex-Official Has No Recollection Of Warnings on Crown Heights
Bill Lynch, the former New York City deputy mayor, has maintained under oath that he does not recall receiving graphic warnings from two City Hall aides during the 1991 Crown Heights violence that the situation was "out of control" and that the police were not responding effectively.
Mr.
Lynch made the statements in a deposition he gave Monday in a lawsuit brought by Hasidic Jews against the city over the four-day outbreak, which included attacks by bands of black youths on Hasidic resident of the Brooklyn neighborhood and the fatal stabbing of a Hasidic visitor from Australia, Yankel Rosembaum.


CHRONICLE
In upstate New York, in the forests of the Akwesasne, the 14,000-acre Mohawk reservation near the Candadian border, Chief JAKE SWAMP of the Mohawks is searching for an Eastern white pine to become the centerpiece of a Thanksgiving ceremony on Nov. 20 at the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine in Manhattan.
The annual ceremony began five years ago as a way of honoring the Americans who helped the Pilgrims survive their first harsh winter in their new homeland, but this is the first year that a tree will figure prominently in it.
The tree was selected as this year's theme, Chief Swamp said, because it symbolizes peace.
"It carries the spirit of my people," he added.

Shakedowns Are Suspected In 2 Precincts
Law-enforcement officials are investigating two groups of New York City police officers who are suspected of running separate drug-trafficking operations in Brooklyn and Manhattan, senior Federal and state investigators said yesterday.
Both sets of officers, working out of two of the most violent, drug-prone areas of the city, are suspected of routinely shaking down drug dealers for drugs and cash, stealing guns from drug dealers and then turning around and selling the drugs to other drug dealers.

Mayor David N. Dinkins, seeking to rebound from the unwelcome glare of his deposition on the Crown Heights violence, won the endorsement yesterday of the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and announced the hiring of one of the Speaker's top aides for his campaign staff.
The announcement on the steps of City Hall was part of a broader strategy to reach out politically to the city's white middle-class neighborhoods -- a constituency that Mr.

House Republican Leaders Assert Health Plan Will Push Taxes Up
House Republican leaders today made a preemptive assault on President Clinton's health plan, asserting in a new report that the Clinton approach would lead to major new taxes, burdensome new government regulations and a huge loss of jobs among small businesses.
The document, released by the House Republican Conference, signaled the intensity of the coming struggle over revamping the health care system.

Nigeria Gas Price Rise Ignites Fury at Government
In an oil-producing country accustomed to having some of the world's cheapest fuel, the decision this week by the military authorities to raise gasoline prices ten-fold has set off anger, anxiety and panic buying.
The move to introduce a new higher-priced grade of gasoline and make fewer pumps selling lower-priced fuel was even seen as part of a diabolical scheme by the military ruler, General Ibrahim Babangida, to foment chaos as an excuse to retain power.


A Second City Star Craves the Big Award
Frank Thomas hits like Reggie Jackson no, better than Reggie Jackson -- and he speaks words that sound like Reggie.
But the tone of the words is different.
When Jackson talked about himself -- "the magnitude of me," for example -- he always came across as boastful.
Thomas talks about himself and sounds earnest, not boastful.
That's the way he came across when he talked about the candidates for the American League Most Valuable Player Award.
In discussing that topic, many people don't get beyond John Olerud, the Toronto Blue Jays' star who is threatening to hit .400.


Economic Scene; A Free-Market Jolt May Stir Asia's Lagging Economic Giant at Last.
The economy underperformed for decades, hobbled by Government planners whose careers depended on the continuing worship of false prophets.
National savings rates had always been high.
But much of the money had been squandered on subsidies for hopelessly inefficient state monopolies and grandiose public investments to feed the egos of bureaucrats and generals.
Only in the 1980's, after the contrast with Asian and Western economic growth became too obvious to ignore, did the ruling elite look to the outside world for the ideas to rescue it from disgrace.

Indeed, in a newly released report commissioned by India's Finance Ministry, he and T. N. Srinivasan, another Indian expatriate who teaches at Yale University, conclude that the world's most populous democracy is well along the runway to an economic takeoff.

Bat Rabies Killed 11-Year-Old Girl, Health Officials Say
An 11-year-old Sullivan County girl who died of rabies on July 11 was infected by a strain of bat rabies, and not by a strain that originated among raccoons, New York State health officials said yesterday.
Authorities had earlier thought that an epidemic of raccoon rabies, which emerged in New York and most of the Northeast in 1990, was the probable cause of the child's death.


TJ INTERNATIONAL APPROVES A 2-FOR-1 STOCK SPLIT
TJ International, which is based in Boise, Idaho, and makes composite wood products that are in great demand because of the shortage of large logs for structural lumber, yesterday approved a 2-for-1 stock split and a plan to expand the manufacturing capacity of its Trus Joist MacMillan joint venture.
The stock split will be distributed as a 100 percent stock dividend to stockholders of record as of Sept. 7, and will be paid on Oct. 1.
Adjusting for the split, the board also voted to increase the stock dividend by a quarter-cent, to 5.5 cents, payable on Oct. 20 to stockholders of record as of Sept. 24.
The shares closed up 50 cents yesterday, to $41.75, in Nasdaq trading.
The directors of the other partner in the venture, MacMillan Bloedel of Vancouver, British Columbia, will consider the expansion plans at a meeting on Sept. 15.

Giants Give 2 Young Backs a Crack at Starting
The Giants' starting lineup when they take on the Dolphins in Miami Saturday night will basically be the same starting lineup that will begin the regular season against the Bears in Chicago eight days later.
So said Coach Dan Reeves today, and that bodes well for two defensive backs, Lamar McGriggs and Phillippi Sparks.
Sparks, a second-round draft choice out of Arizona State in 1992, will start at right cornerback on Saturday.
He has been battling veteran Perry Williams for a starting role after spending most of last season as a nickel back and special-teams player.

General Details Altered 'Star Wars' Test
A retired general who helped oversee a disputed 1984 "Star Wars" test says the target missile in the test was artificially heated to make it a bigger target for a heat-seeking sensor on an interceptor missile, and thus easier to hit, but he denies that the action meant the test was rigged.
The retired Army major general, Eugene Fox, then the deputy program manager for the test, also denies that Congress was misled about the experiment, in which the interceptor missile hit the target missile over the Pacific.
The experiment was a crucial technological milestone for the fledgling missile-defense program, which had been under attack by scientists and skeptics since its inception in 1983.


Yankees Return to First After Winning Hitchcock-Ojeda Duel
Bob Ojeda was searching for his first victory since last year, his first victory since surviving the boating accident that killed two teammates in March, his first victory with Cleveland.
Sterling Hitchcock was pursuing his first major-league victory for the Yankees in his first major-league pennant race.
They were two left-handed pitchers who seemed to have little in common tonight except that both were feeling pressure.
Ojeda is 35 years old and nearing the end of his career.
Hitchcock is 22 and just starting his.
But, on this muggy evening when Cleveland's depressing memories from the spring collided with New York's refreshing pennant chase, Ojeda and Hitchcock had a lot in common because they were responsible for zeros filling the scoreboard for six innings.

A longtime assistant, JIM LAMBRIGHT, has been given a four-year contract to succeed DON JAMES as head football coach of the Washington Huskies.

James resigned in anger Sunday to protest the severity of the bowl penalty.


China Calls American Sanctions Unjustifiable
China today branded as "entirely unjustifiable" the Clinton Administration's decision to impose economic sanctions over the sale of ballistic missile technology to Pakistan.

Sheik, in Court, Denies Terror Charges
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who for more than a decade has defied allegations that he inspired terrorist acts, was taken before a Federal judge in Manhattan yesterday and arraigned on charges that he led a conspiracy that was bent on waging a war of terror in the United States and Egypt.
Mr.
Abdel Rahman, wearing his clerical robes and dark glasses, sat silently in court as the judge entered a plea of not guilty to the indictment.
On Wednesday, after months of suggestions that the blind Egyptian cleric had encouraged the bombing of the World Trade Center and other plots, he and 14 co-defendants were formally charged with seditious conspiracy.


Up From the Computer Underground
The bustling Interop computer-network trade show, running here through Friday, was once the sole province of hackers in jeans interested in fashioning ways to make the gear of different manufacturers work together.
But in recent years, marketing vice presidents in suits have become a reliable staple, demonstrating how the Internet -- a global collection of computer networks on which the show is based -- has transcended the techie underground to become one of the world's largest computer exhibitions.


How American 'Sister' Died in a Township
It was daylight still when Amy Elizabeth Biehl steered her old orange Mazda with the peace sticker on the bumper into the black township of Guguletu.

Her work as a Fulbright scholar was finished, her bags packed for a Friday flight home to California, and now she was driving three black friends home for the last time.
At her farewell party on Sunday, she had switched easily between English and her hard-studied Xhosa, and danced the phan tsula, a sort of township jive.


Bergen Stores Try to Repeal Blue Laws
A Bergen County law that has kept stores closed on Sundays since 1959 in the heart of New Jersey's mall country came under official attack today by a merchants' group.
The group says voters would repeal the law if given a chance and they gave the Bergen County Clerk, Kathleen A. Donovan, a four-inch stack of petitions asking that the future of the Sunday closings be placed on the ballot in November.
About 10,000 Bergen voters signed the petitions, repeal proponents said; only 2,500 valid signatures are necessary to get on the Nov. 2 ballot.


Nor Will Trade Pact Aid Mexicans Much
To the Editor:
"The Trade Pact Is Our Best Deal" (Op-Ed, Aug. 17) by Carla A. Hills makes highly questionable assertions in support of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Ms.
Hills says that we sold almost $41 billion in goods to Mexico last year and that per capita purchases from the United States amounted to $477 in 1992.
She must know that Mexican trade data, more detailed than our own, paint a totally different picture.
Their data show United States exports to the Mexican consumer market constituted less than 20 percent of the total reported exports.

Nor Will Trade Pact Aid Mexicans Much; Welcome, Pesticides
To the Editor:
If the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are approved, all states in the United States will be required to adopt international standards for pesticides on food.
These standards will allow 10 to 50 times more DDT on fruits and vegetables than now.
Milk will be allowed to contain Endrin, banned in the United States.
Some fruits and vegetables will be allowed to contain Aldrin, also banned.
These are just a few examples of the pesticides that will be above currently allowed levels.


CHRONICLE
WYNTON MARSALIS, the jazz musician, entertained about 60 cancer patients yesterday when he and a small band performed at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
The concert was organized by the Kristen Ann Carr Fund, which was created earlier this year in memory of the 21-year-old daughter of Bruce Springsteen's co-manager, Barbara Carr, and David Marsh, an author.
Ms.
Carr died last January of a form of sarcoma that most often attacks children and young adults.


The U.S. v. the Sheik
Attorney General Janet Reno surely made a popular call when she approved the indictment of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 14 others on charges of conspiring "to levy a war of urban terrorism against the United States," and other crimes.
Since the deadly February bomb attack at New York City's World Trade Center, New Yorkers especially have felt vulnerable to international terrorism.
For many, the sheik, with his inflammatory preaching and the bloody deeds attributed to his followers, has come to symbolize the danger.


Honda's Star Gets Another Sequel
Since January, when the Ford Taurus eclipsed the Honda Accord as the nation's best-selling car model, the auto industry has been waiting for Honda's counterpunch, the new Accord.
The first public demonstration of that model takes place Wednesday at a Honda assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio.
Even rivals concede that the Accord has been the benchmark against which family sedans are measured, raising this question: Can the Accord do it again?


Police Seeking 3 More Men In Kidnapping of Executive
The New York City Police Department yesterday disclosed the identities of three more men who it says aided in the kidnapping of Harvey Weinstein, the formal-wear manufacturer who was rescued after his abductors kept him in a pit for 12 days in upper Manhattan.
With two men and a woman already under arrest for the crime, one of the lead investigators on the case said the department was searching for three additional men.
While it was feared that the men may have fled the country, the investigator, Lieut.
Joseph Pollini of the Major Case Squad, said they were likely still in New York City.


Security for All of Europe, In Seven Tricky Steps
Whether Europe unravels for a third time this century depends on whether the West summons the political will and strategic vision to address the causes of potential instability and conflict before it is too late.
A new U.S.-European strategic bargain is needed, one that extends NATO's collective defense and security arrangements to those areas where the seeds for future conflict in Europe lie: the Atlantic alliance's eastern and southern borders.
The end of the cold war wiped away the strategic distinction between Europe's center and periphery.
Whereas the potential locus of conflict in Europe in the cold war was along the old inner-German border, Europe's new strategic challenges exist almost exclusively along two arcs of crisis: the eastern arc, the zone of instability running between Germany and Russia from northern Europe down through Turkey, the Caucasus and middle Asia; and the southern arc, running through northern Africa and the Mediterranean into the Middle East and Southwest Asia.


At the Bar; A successful prosecutor of war criminals may be remembered for the case that fell apart.
Considering that he heads the office that must make cases out of crimes that are 50 years old, Neal M. Sher has a remarkable track record.
For the last decade he has been the Government's top Nazi hunter, the head of a group of prosecutors, historians and polyglots at the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations.
They sift through old war records to catch those who fell through the cracks and made it to the United States after terrorizing and murdering a generation at places like Auschwitz, Dachau and Bergen-Belsen.


Woman Is Accused of Using 3 of Her Children in Burglary
A Manhattan woman was arrested after using three of her children to help carry out a burglary in the family's Washington Heights apartment building, the police said.
The woman, Tonya Ortiz, 26 years old, ordered the three children to descend a fire escape from her fifth-floor apartment in upper Manhattan and enter the window of a neighbor's third-floor apartment, the police said.
Once inside, the children, aged 5, 6, and 9, unlocked the door for their mother, who slipped in and removed a Walkman, a camera, a VCR and $300, investigators said.


Review/Art; Hopper's Views of the City of Light
EDWARD HOPPER is famous as the 20th-century painter of American light; at least a certain kind of American light.
It isn't the finicky, scientifically correct light of a naturalist like Andrew Wyeth, or the light of a fantasist like Charles Burchfield, for whom illumination had an emotive, metaphysical charge.
Sunlight falling on the exterior of one of Hopper's Gloucester houses or into one of his bare city bedrooms is as artificial and sculptured as stage lighting, and it sets the scene for a drama called American Loneliness.
Viewers for whom American-ness is the very meaning of Hopper may be somewhat surprised to see the 25 paintings in "Hopper in Paris" in the Lobby Gallery of the Whitney Museum of American Art.
Yet the exhibition -- drawn from the museum's extensive Hopper holdings and the first of a "Collection in Context" series intended to re-evaluate a wide range of work in the museum's permanent collection -- does everything possible, even when history isn't squarely on its side, to demonstrate that Hopper's signature images of bleak insularity had their origins not in his home country but in France, which he visited three times between 1906 and 1910.


Critic's Choice/Dance; Both Near and Far at Jacob's Pillow
The Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival brings its 1993 season to a typically eclectic close this weekend with performances by a major American modern dance company and a relatively unfamiliar duo, augmented for the occasion, from Spain.
Jeraldyne Blunden and her Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, celebrating its 25th season, have been responsible for encouraging many gifted black dancers to become professionals.
The 16-member company, performing at the Pillow's Ted Shawn Theater, is committed to presenting new and landmark dances created by choreographers who are black or have some association with black American culture.


Landlady Found Guilty Of Murdering 3 Tenants
A Sacramento landlady accused of murdering nine of her tenants to collect their government benefit checks was found guilty today in three of the slayings.
The jury took 24 days to reach a verdict, a record for a murder trial in California.
The landlady, Dorothea Montalvo Puente, was convicted of first-degree murder in two of the deaths and of second-degree murder in a third.


Dinkins Ads for TV Show a Calm Leader Of a Troubled City
Drawing on time-tested incumbents' tactics, Mayor David N. Dinkins begins his television advertising campaign today with commercials that seek to blame others for many of New York City's problems and portray him as making brave headway against them at City Hall.
The three commercials, one 60 seconds and two 30 seconds, stress his hiring more police officers, opening schools at night, extending library hours and starting new health clinics, and two end with the tag line, "It takes more than tough talk to run a tough city." At the same time, a silent slogan flashes on the screen below a facsimile of his signature: "One city. One future." Intended to Defuse Complaints
In nearly four years in office, Mr.
Dinkins has often argued that he is doing the best he can in tough times.
The main commercial embroiders on that theme with a defensive needle, as a narrator intones in its opening line: "Along with the oath of office, they gave him a massive deficit, a hostile administration in Washington, and a city at the boiling point."


All-Bernstein Concert
To celebrate the 75th birthday of Leonard Bernstein, the final program of the Bryant Park Young Performers Series is to be devoted to works by the composer and conductor, who died in 1990.
The free concert, today at 12:30, is to offer music from "On the Town," "Peter Pan," "Mass," "Arias and Barcarolles" and other Bernstein works.
The performers are Joyce Castle, a mezzo-soprano, and Kurt Ollmann, a baritone, accompanied by Alexis Gerlach, a cellist, and Shu-Ching Chen, a pianist, both students at the Juilliard School.
The park is at 40th Street and Avenue of the Americas; rain date is Monday.
Information: (212) 983-4142.


Summergarden Finale
Summergarden, the series of free concerts at the Museum of Modern Art, ends its season of music by Latin American composers with two performances this weekend by the Belvoir Quartet, tonight and tomorrow night at 8 o'clock in the museum's Sculpture Garden, 14 West 54th Street.
Quartets by Silvestre Revueltas, Mario Lavista, Julian Orbon and Aurelio Tello are on the program, as well as Alberto Ginastera's settings of poems by Lorca and others, to be sung by Cheryl Marshall, a soprano.
Information: (212) 708-9500.


Wife Dead, Husband Indicted, Atlanta Is Transfixed
In a case first depicted as an act of random violence that has since evolved into a darker story of drugs, money laundering and murder, a prominent tax lawyer was indicted today on charges of arranging the killing of his wife, who was shot in the head last November as their two young sons looked on.
The lawyer, Frederic Tokars, 40, who was arrested in Florida on Wednesday night, was accused in state and Federal indictments of being behind the abduction and slaying of his wife, Sara, last Nov. 29.


Audit Planned in School Asbestos Inspections
Two independent investigators have begun an audit of the emergency inspection of New York City's school system for asbestos in an effort to guarantee that the inspection is done properly and that the schools are safe.

Buchanan Joins the Foes Of Trade Pact
The tangled politics of the North American Free Trade Agreement became enmeshed in Republican Party politics today, as a former conservative Presidential aspirant, Patrick J. Buchanan, denounced two fellow Republicans who support the agreement and who are seen as front-runners for the party's 1996 Presidential nomination.
Mr.
Buchanan, a hard-line rightist, offered an unexpectedly strong challenge to President George Bush last year.
Today, he announced that he would form a group to distribute essays and other criticism of the pact.


Review/Film; Incestuous Dreams And Real-Life Results
"Careful" was shown as part of the 1992 New York Film Festival.
Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 7, 1992.
The film opens today at the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, East Village.
"Careful" is the third full-length movie by Guy Maddin, an eccentric Canadian film maker who achieved cult status with his two earlier films, "Archangel" and "Tales From the Gimli Hospital." Both were spoofs of early talkies that caught the look and sound of a bygone era while telling virtually impenetrable stories.
Although "Careful" shares some of those films' obsessions, it is by far Mr.
Maddin's most polished and coherent work.
The film is one long and amusing pun on German Expressionistic film imagery, Freudian psychology and quasi-Wagnerian storytelling, all carried to absurdist lengths.
The plot concentrates on a star-crossed family of four.
Zenaida (Gosia Dobrowolska), the beautiful widow of an oafish swan feeder, tends a home she shares with her three sons, Johann (Brent Neale), Grigorss (Kyle McCulloch) and Franz (Vince Rimmer).
The family's orderly little world begins to crumble when Johann, who has just become engaged to Klara (Sarah Neville), has an incestuous dream about his mother.
Suddenly mad with forbidden passion, he drugs his mother, slits open her bodice and places his lips on her breast.
Then in a paroxysm of guilt, he sears his mouth with hot coals, cuts off several fingers and leaps off a precipice.
That's just the beginning of the sexual Sturm und Drang that rises in the characters like an avalanche from within.
The movie's biggest strength is its knowing burlesques of antiquated cinematic techniques.
Its biggest weakness is its acting.
Most of the players, including Mr.
McCulloch, the director's regular leading man, go about their chores with an amateurish enthusiasm that gives the movie a homemade quality.


Arbitron Sued On Technology
The Pretesting Company, a market research firm based in Tenafly, N.J., said yesterday that it had sued the Arbitron Company for using a technology to measure television and radio audiences that infringes a patent held by Pretesting.
The suit, which was filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, asserted that Pretesting had demonstrated a technology in June 1992 that could be incorporated in a "wristwatch-like" device to determine what radio or television program or commercial the wearer would be watching in and out of the home.
Five months later, the suit said, Arbitron announced it would develop a pocket-sized meter, similar to a pager, that would measure audiences.

It is not certain which thumb 49er fans mourn more: the one Steve Young fractured or the one Joe Montana used to hitchhike out of town.

The city of San Francisco wishes he were here, not in Kansas City, because he would be the starting quarterback right now.

Shift in the Psychology of Inflation
Interest rates continued to plunge yesterday, sending a strong signal that the stubborn inflation expectations of millions of Americans are falling with them.
Expectations that higher prices are lurking around the corner -- a hard lesson of the double-digit inflation era -- have been difficult to shake, despite the fact that inflation has averaged 3.8 percent the last 10 years and could wind up below 3 percent for both 1992 and 1993.


Community Reinvestment Is Right and It Pays; Getting the Job Done
To the Editor:
In "Fresh Money for Poor Communities" (editorial, Aug. 13), you miss the point of the Community Reinvestment Act and President Clinton's proposal to finance community development banks.
The Community Reinvestment Act, passed in 1977, says banks must make a fair share of loans in all communities they get deposits from.
Federal and state banking regulators have not adequately enforced that law.
However, challenges under the law have led to negotiated agreements that have totaled tens of billions of dollars of loans for our neighborhoods.


Eyeball to Eyeball in Tie Breaker, and Stich Blinks

Michael Stich of Germany is one of the best all-round players on the tour and is ranked sixth in the world.
He is also the tour leader in tie-breaker victories this year.
But tonight, in a 3-hour-7-minute struggle of nerves, Pioline took a page out of Brad Gilbert's new book "Winning Ugly," made Stich blink in a final tie breaker and emerged with a 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) upset victory.

Creative Use of Leisure Begins in Childhood
To the Editor:
When people work, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi states In "Relax? Relax and Do What?" (Op-Ed, Aug. 12), they "report feeling generally strong, creative and satisfied; when free to do whatever they want in their free time, they tend to feel weak, dull and unsatisfied." But, "given a choice, few would want to work more."
Yet juxtapose this with another of his statements: "children report that they prefer situations when they are doing something resembling both work and play . . . activities that require use of disciplined skills: sports, music, art, computers, hobbies."

Tyson in New Appeal
MIKE TYSON pleaded with Indiana's top justices yesterday for one more chance to win a new trial.
Attorneys for the former heavyweight champion filed motions asking the Indiana Supreme Court to review his rape conviction.
The State Court of Appeals rejected his arguments for a new trial earlier this month.
The five-memeber Supreme Court is not obligated to hear the case.
Lawyers cited as grounds for a new trial a lower court's refusal to let three defense witnesses testify and to allow evidence about the sexual past of Tyson's accuser.
Prosecutors have 10 days to respond to the petition.
Tyson was sentenced in March 1992 to six years in prison after his conviction in the rape of DESIREE WASHINGTON, a Rhode Island beauty contestant, in an Indianapolis hotel room.
Tyson is incarcerated at the Indiana Youth Center some 20 miles west of Indianapolis. (AP)

United Air Buyout Plan Is Confirmed
The pilots' union at United Airlines has confirmed speculation that its labor leaders want to gain control of the airline through an employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, and that they propose granting $3.35 billion in wage and other concessions from the carrier's 83,000 employees over five years.
Some details of the proposal, included in a letter mailed this week to pilots, shed new light on discussions of a buyout effort by United's three largest unions.
People familiar with the details of the talks added that in return for the concessions discussed in the letter, the unions wanted a 60 percent stake in the UAL Corporation, United's parent.

Art in Review
'John Ferren, the Formative Years' 'The 1930's in Paris and Spain'  Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center1 830 Fireplace Road  East Hampton, L.I.
Through Oct. 30
John Ferren's early geometric work, with its prismatic colors, hard edges and clear debt to Kandinsky, is something of an anomaly at Pollock-Krasner House, where the turbulent myths and more spontaneous painting methods of Abstract Expressionism's most famous couple are palpable.
Ferren, who died in 1970 at the age of 65, was a regular on the New York art scene starting in the late 1930's, and was active during the 50's in the Club, that legendary Abstract Expressionist forum.
But he was not, in his own words, "one of the red-hot brush-throwers."

For Seles, the Wound Still Hurts
Outside Monica Seles's home base, the Meadows Racquet Club, a late-summer thunderstorm is raging, sending up a ghostly vapor from the steaming parking lot and scaring the lizards from their usual resting places beneath the placid palm and cypress trees that surround the courts where Seles used to come to perfect the tennis strokes that made her the most dominant player of this decade.
But Monica doesn't come here anymore, because Monica doesn't play tennis anymore, not since a deranged German man stabbed the world's best player in the back four months ago in Hamburg, and later claimed a fanatical devotion to Steffi Graf, then No. 2, as his excuse for trying to ruin Seles's career.
Not One Swing
Under normal circumstances, with the United States Open just days away, Seles should have been putting the final polish on the double-fisted strokes that carried her to the Open championship in 1991 and 1992.
But this year instead of defending her title, Seles is confined to the sidelines.
She hasn't hit a tennis ball since she was stabbed on April 30.
And in an emotional two-hour interview on Wednesday, during which she wasn't always able to prevent her tears from undermining her talk, Seles admitted she wasn't sure she would ever rekindle the stellar career that was shattered by a man known as Gunther P.


Hidden Giant -- A special report.; Indonesia Improves Life for Many But the Political Shadows Remain
Hari Darmawan barely had rags to wear at the start of his rags-to-riches story.
His childhood home on the northern Indonesian island of Sulawesi was a bamboo hut, and he recalls years of hunger in which the evening meal was little more than a bowl of watery rice.
"In those days, everyone was hungry, everyone was poor," he said as he led a tour of his newest home: a 25-acre estate centered on several man-made lakes and four museum-quality antique houses that he moved here from other parts of Indonesia.
"People tell me I should also invest in Singapore, in China, in Australia. But I think the future is in Indonesia."

"He got his wish: I didn't do anything wrong except be the No. 1, and now I'm being punished for it. I've lost the ranking, I'm missing the Grand Slams, which kills me inside, and for me, 1993 is over, gone. It's a lost year." -- MONICA SELES, referring to the man who stabbed her on a tennis court four months ago.  [ B9:3. ]


Philadelphia Doctors to Be Offered Data on Patients Who Have Sued
Philadelphia doctors will soon be offered a new service that may have been inevitable in a society in which both lawsuits and computers are commonplace: For $80 a month, they can find out whether a prospective patient has ever filed a malpractice suit against another doctor.
The service, Courtscan, is to begin direct-mail marketing to Philadelphia-area doctors next week, said William J. Benedict Jr., president of Courtscan Services in Greenwich, Conn.

Review/Art; Works From Iowa and Vassar at the I.B.M. Gallery
When institutions of higher learning compete, the contest is usually between ball teams or debating squads, and battle is traditionally met in a stadium, field house or college auditorium.
It's less usual that two schools go head to head in a museum setting, but to some degree this is what is happening at the I.B.M.
Gallery of Science and Art, where selections from the widely respected art collections of the University of Iowa in Iowa City and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., can be seen.
The result, one of the sleeper art events of the summer, is best described as a no-lose situation from which everyone, most of all the viewer, emerges a winner.
Devotees of the art of this century may claim that "20th-Century Works From the University of Iowa Museum of Art," a show of 54 paintings, sculptures and works on paper that range from Robert Delaunay to Robert Motherwell, has a slight edge over "Highlights from the Vassar College Art Collection," which starts in 18th-Dynasty Egypt and ends in the early 1950's with Jackson Pollock and Francis Bacon.
But this is only a matter of personal taste and focus; both shows are so impressive they can almost make one want to sign up for classes at their respective schools.
Well, almost.


Repairing a Breach, and Building Another, on L.I.
Welcome to Westhampton Dunes, the fastest-growing would-be village in the state, the country and, perhaps, the world.
At a rate of 55,000 cubic yards of sand each working day, this two-mile section of barrier island, cut adrift from the rest of the island by a storm on Dec. 11 that put it on the far side of a widening breach, just keeps growing.


BUSINESS DIGEST
Companies
National Medical Enterprises' offices and hospitals across the country were raided by Federal agents as part of a wide-ranging investigation of health insurance fraud.
National Medical, one of the largest hospital operators, has been sued by more than a dozen large insurance companies, which say that the company defrauded them of more than $750 million.  [ Page D1. ]
Shares of Novell fell in reaction to earnings that were below Wall Street expectations.
Novell's results for the third quarter marked the first time that the networking software company's earnings had fallen on a year-to-year basis since late in 1989.  [ D1. ]


New Chief And a Loss At Egghead
Egghead Software Inc., an operator of a chain of retail software stores, today reported a loss for its first quarter and said that Timothy E. Turnpaugh had resigned as chairman and chief executive.
Mr.

Good Will and Its Limits in Somalia
Four hundred U.S.
Army Rangers arrived in Somalia yesterday, bolstering the 25,000 U.N.  troops already there as part of a peacemaking effort that will cost more than $1.5 billion this year.
At the same time, the U.N. and private development groups are scaling back handouts of free food, replacing them with food-for-work projects that will in turn be replaced with cash-for-work projects.
On the surface, this seems very positive: The food emergency is over.
The harvest, largely sorghum but also other produce, looks good.
Charity is being phased out.

Plea Deal Puts a Prosecutor on Trial
The chief prosecutor in Richmond has been acquitted of bribe charges in a case that legal experts say raises troubling questions about the potential for abuse in plea bargaining.
The defendant, Joseph D. Morrissey, the Richmond Commonwealth's attorney, was acquitted on Friday of charges that he took a bribe to settle a rape case and gave part of the money to groups that could help him win re-election.

Dr.
Robert W. Holliday, a heart surgeon, died on Tuesday at his home in Mount Kisco.
He was 71.

Kevorkian's Prosecutor Could Almost Defend Him
Nobody was surprised last week when the Wayne County prosecutor charged Dr.
Jack Kevorkian with violating a new Michigan law that makes assisting in a suicide a felony.
The man widely known as "Dr. Death" had sought a showdown since Aug. 4, when he drove a patient to a Detroit island park and for the 17th time since 1990, helped someone commit suicide.
But the prosecutor, John D. O'Hair, startled reporters at a news conference on Aug. 17 by announcing not only that he would charge Dr.
Kevorkian but also that he was proposing a bill to legalize doctor-assisted suicide.
He went on to say that if he himself were terminally ill, he would not have "a moment's hesitation" in seeking a doctor's help to end his own life.


Review/Theater; In the Rarefied Air, Shakespeare Accessible to All
In the summertime, there is a distinctly collegiate charm about the Mount, the former Edith Wharton estate in the Berkshires.
The home base of Shakespeare and Company, an organization devoted principally to the production of and training in Elizabethan drama, it is steeped in an atmosphere that is equal parts academia and bohemia.
Snatches of blank verse float into the woodland air, as fresh-faced actors perform and rehearse amid stands of pines and on hillsides, and the views are truly idyllic.
It all has the effect of making one want to be 19 and reciting something lyrical, preferably with a Gitane and a moody gaze.
There is nothing adolescent or dilettantish, however, about the work that is being done in the four indoor and outdoor spaces that the company has carved out for its summer repertory.
Since assuming residency here in 1978, Shakespeare and Company, led firmly by its artistic director, Tina Packer, has created a strong, cohesive and sui generis language-based style in its approach to Shakespearean text, which stresses the relevance of the plays to audiences of all backgrounds.
It is the company's credo that the beauty of the language should always be subordinate to its meaning, and that the meaning is topically evergreen.
During the nonsummer months, the company takes its plays and its teachers on the road, into schools and community outreach programs throughout New England, and its function always seems to be to explain as well as to entertain.
Perhaps as a consequence, subtlety is not the troupe's strong suit; clarity and accessibility very definitely are.


U.S. Mission in Somalia: Seeking a Clear Rationale
As Army commandos began arriving in Somalia to help search for the fugitive warlord Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, the Clinton Administration was still groping today for a clear rationale for the American presence in the African nation.
President Clinton's decision to send 400 Army Rangers has raised fears that the United States is being gradually pulled back into a longstanding military commitment it had been trying to escape since May, when United States soldiers turned their role over to the United Nations.


Mother Killed in Crossfire as She Tries to Save Son
A young mother was shot and killed in Brooklyn last night when she tried to save her child from the crossfire of a gun battle and was struck by a bullet herself, the police said.
The mother, Toyatwenda Gillard, was relaxing on a bench in the courtyard of her home in East New York in the early evening as her 2-year-old son, Donovan, played on a jungle gym a dozen yards away when she heard gunfire, witnesses said.


TV Weekend; The Road to Tutankhamen's Tomb
"The Face of Tutankhamen" begins by retracing the path that took Howard Carter into the Valley of the Kings in Egypt and, climactically, to the tomb of King Tutankhamen in 1922, setting off fits of Tutmania in the West.
Carter is pictured as a mixture of artist, explorer, scientist, dreamer and adventurer, "the Indiana Jones of his generation," as the narrator describes him with pardonable exaggeration.
Using excerpts from Carter's notebooks and photographs from the archeological archives, Sunday's program, the first installment of an elaborate four-part documentary on A&amp;E, tells of the riches and the history he found in the ancient tombs despite centuries of despoilment.
It ends with the excitement of his great discovery.
"Strange animals, statues and gold," Carter wrote.
"Everywhere the glint of gold!"


PROGRESS IS HINTED FOR MIDEAST TALKS
When the Middle East peace talks resume in Washington on Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are expected to discuss mixtures of new and old ideas that have senior officials on both sides speaking optimistically about a possible breakthrough.
Perhaps the most talked-about new plan would quickly give the Palestinians authority over the tumultuous Gaza Strip and the quiet West Bank city of Jericho, with Israeli forces pulling back from those areas.
More sensitive questions of control over the rest of the West Bank and -- thornier yet -- the future of Jerusalem would be left for later.


Warner Weighs Formation of TV Network
Time Warner Inc. is exploring the creation of a new television network, several company executives confirmed yesterday.
The company, which already distributes a number of programs to 150 independent television stations around the country, has been talking to Jamie Kellner, the former president of Fox Broadcasting about managing its efforts to expand those efforts.


Community Reinvestment Is Right and It Pays
To the Editor:
"Fresh Money for Poor Communities" (editorial, Aug. 13) promotes several harmful myths about community reinvestment lending.
First, low-income borrowers are not necessarily "credit-risky." Available data from private mortgage insurance companies suggest that low-income homeowners are far less likely to default on mortgages than high-income borrowers, in part because low-income borrowers view homeownership as shelter, rather than investment.
And, after a decade of record losses on speculative investments in commercial real estate, we have yet to see a bank or savings and loan institution go belly up because of too much lending to poor people.


Review/Film; About America as a Family That's Dysfunctional
In "The Last Party," a documentary filmed during last year's Presidential election, Robert Downey Jr. plays interviewer, commentator and soul-searching everyman trekking across America to meet the people.
The goal of a trip that takes him to the Democratic and Republican National Conventions and from Washington to Wall Street is nothing less than the diagnosis of the malaise at the heart of American society.
Everybody from the Rev.
Jerry Falwell to the Rev.
Al Sharpton, from Oliver Stone to Oliver L. North is given a sound bite on the subject.
More than an interviewer, Mr.
Downey has the impossible task of being the emotional and spiritual grounding wire for the film, which Mark Benjamin and Marc Levin have directed in the style of an jeans commercial on MTV.
The film is so jumpy that no one, including Mr.
Downey, gets to say much of anything.
Adopting a cheery, guy-next-door attitude, he offers autobiographical tidbits about his parents' divorce, his sexual problems with women and his enrollment in a 12-step program, which are supposed to be emblematic of the "Less Than Zero" generation.


Tennis Camp: In Pursuit of Perfection
SOMETIMES in the darkness of the early morning, back when I was experiencing a sixth grader's first miseries of insomnia and existential dread, I used to panic about the imminent possibility of flunking French.
I had a theory then that someday I would glue electrodes to my head so that the language could be automatically imprinted in my brain.
I saw myself awakening refreshed and saucily self-confident, coolly conjugating the most difficult of verbs and cracking wicked little jokes en francais about the iron-willed, white-haired Mme.
Jinx, my nemesis.
The trouble was, I couldn't sleep.
There was no such machine.
I did not awaken refreshed.
And Mme.
Jinx quickly caught on to my one pathetic little ruse, which was to chirp the same sentence in every class -- "Ah, oui, Monsieur. J'aime le jus d'orange!" -- at high volume with a lilting accent.


Sworn to Uphold It, Justice Ginsburg Beholds It


Target Was Heated For 'Star Wars' Test
A retired general who helped oversee a 1984 "Star Wars" test said the target missile in the test was artificially heated to make it a more visible to a heat-seeking sensor on an interceptor missile -- and thus easier to hit than a Soviet missile would have been.
But he denied that the test was rigged.
The retired Army major general, Eugene Fox, who was the deputy program manager for the test, also denied that Congress had been misled about the experiment, which Pentagon officials said at the time proved that a missile could hit another missile in mid-flight.


Editorial Notebook:; The Politics of Gangster Rap
The most dangerous myth facing African-Americans today is that middle-class life is counterfeit and that only poverty and suffering, and the rage that attends them, are real.
Anyone who doubts the power of this myth need only think back to the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, and how Judge Thomas's status as "a sharecropper's grandson" was put forth as a qualification for the Supreme Court.
The poverty fetish is also dangerous; anyone who doubts this might recall Edmund Perry, the black Exeter graduate who was shot to death by an undercover cop in Morningside Heights.
At Exeter, Edmund had played the swaggering tough without risk.
On the streets of New York, the role reared up and killed him.


Home Video
The Call of the Child
With a large demand for family entertainment, studios and other suppliers are responding with a rush of children's titles.
Dominated by Disney, Barney and other big names, the children's category is already the video's industry's second largest (after feature films), and again the emphasis is on the big and well-promoted.
On Tuesday, for example, Sony Wonder will release its first Nickelodeon titles, among them episodes from "Ren and Stimpy." Last month, Republic released several tapes produced by the Children's Television Workshop, including five "Ghostwriter" shows and the Emmy-winning animated feature "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."


Lawyers Can Spark Hostility in Clients
To the Editor:
As a lawyer in a public interest practice, I chafe at the persistent, negative perception of lawyers, as your Aug. 20 letter writers did in answer to Lincoln Caplan's Aug. 6 Op-Ed article.
Their search for the origins of this misperception missed an important point: the American adversary system is designed to create animosity toward its practitioners.
One out of two litigation clients is primed to be anti-lawyer because every case has a loser, and who better to blame for a lost case than a lawyer? (No losing client truly believes the case was lost on the facts or the law.)

Dinkins is seen leaning forward over a chair, his fists clenched intently, and walking down the street with black, white and Asian campaign volunteers.

Restaurants
When Gotham Bar and Grill opened in the early 1980's, it epitomized the high-living, brash-spending decade.
The warehouse space on East 12th Street was an eclectic meld of new-wave Americana and Italian moderne.
There were the stenciled checkerboard wood floor, the Arts and Crafts painted chairs, the gauzy, billowing parachute lamps hanging from the ceiling, the stippled walls and the faux capitals on the soaring columns that punctuate the rambling room.
The music boomed.
The crowd hollered to converse and windmilled in vain for absentee waiters.
The kitchen stumbled.
In its first month, I had two of the worst meals of my life at Gotham Bar and Grill.
Still, there was something compelling about the place.
Maybe it was the restaurant's overblown ambition and its dogged commitment to live up to its own grand vision.
Ten years later, Gotham Bar and Grill has done that, and more.


Sounds Around Town
Mark Murphy Sings
Mark Murphy, Tavern on the Green, Central Park West at 67th Street, (212) 873-3200.
Mark Murphy, a 61-year-old jazz singer who has maintained a devoted cult following for years, is a romantic eccentric who takes more emotional chances than almost any other singer of his generation.
His husky, scat-inflected torch singing is at once dreamy and world-weary.
His long-lined phrases and artfully slurred enunciation bring in echoes of Beat poetry.
Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11 P.M. and Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M.
There is a $17.50 music charge and no minimum.
A Phranc Performance
"Hot August Phranc," Bessie Schonberg Theater, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500.
Expanding from folk singing into performance art, Phranc, a self-proclaimed "all-American Jewish lesbian folk singer," impersonates Neil Diamond in concert.
Wearing a wig, a silver shirt and fake chest hair, and accompanied by a rock trio, she delivers a dozen of his hits, mostly from the 1960's, in a stentorian growl accompanied by appropriate fist-shaking and macho gyrations.
Shows are at 8 P.M. tonight and tomorrow, and tickets are $12.
Betty Carter's Back
Betty Carter, the Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592.
A consummate vocal improviser at the peak of her powers, Betty Carter projects a deep, brooding lyricism that maintains a farsighted view of life and of music.
Her stylistic signature, especially effective in ballads, is her downward bending of notes to evoke longing, loss and the plumbing of inner depths.
Her backup trio consists of Cyrus Chestnut on piano, Christopher Thomas on bass and Clarence Penn on drums.
Shows are tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11:30 P.M.
There is a $25 music charge.


Diner's Journal
A Chain With High Hopes
"Something along the lines of Spago" is how Dennis Riese, the president of the Riese Organization, described his company's latest restaurant.
He hopes to accomplish this none-too-modest goal by backing Richard Krause, a chef who worked not only at Spago, Wolfgang Puck's flagship celebrity haunt in West Hollywood but also at Mr.
Puck's Chinois-on-Main in Santa Monica before moving to New York City, where he was the chef at Batons, Melrose, Rose Cafe and until a few weeks ago at Silverado Bar and Grill.
Attempting a Spago clone or, for that matter, any restaurant designed to showcase a chef is not typical of the Riese Organization, which specializes in mass-market chain restaurants.
It owns about 200, including many "food court" clusters of fast-food stands as well as places like Houlihan's and T.G.I.
Friday's.


RESULTS PLUS
LITTLE LEAGUE  Long Beach Advances  Sean Burroughs pitched his second no-hitter of the Little League World Series and went 4 for 5 with two home runs yesterday as defending champion Long Beach, Calif., muscled into the title game with an 11-0 victory over Bedford, N.H., in Williamsport, Pa.
On Saturday, Long Beach will play Panama, which beat Germany, 5-0, on Carlos Arauz's no-hitter, the fifth of the series.
Burroughs, whose father, Jeff, is his coach and a former major leaguer, had 16 strikeouts for the second game in a row, meaning that only four of the 36 outs in his two no-hitters came by means other than a strikeout.
The no-hitter was Burroughs's third in a row.
He also no-hit San Ramon Valley, Calif., in last week's West tournament, then struck out 16 in an 8-0 no-hitter over Hamilton, Ohio, on Monday.
He has not allowed a hit in 20 innings, but he can't pitch in the final because Little League pitchers aren't allowed to throw in consecutive games. (AP) FOOTBALL  Vikings Beat Steelers  Sparked by special-team members Qadry Ismail and Fuad Reveiz, the Minnesota Vikings rebounded from their only exhibition defeat under Coach Dennis Green with a 30-13 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers last night in Minneapolis.
Ismail, Minnesota's second-round draft pick from Syracuse, had kickoff returns of 55 and 42 yards to set up 10 points, including a 51-yard field goal by Reveiz.
Reveiz, who missed the last two games with an ankle injury, added field goals of 34 and 26 yards. (AP) GOLF  A Tie in Akron  Jim Gallagher took advantage of a monster drive, birdied the final hole and tied David Edwards for the first-round lead yesterday in the World Series of Golf in Akron, Ohio.
Gallagher and Edwards each shot four-under-par 66 despite the fast fairways and quick, tricky greens that made the Firestone Country Club course play at its toughest. (AP) Coe-Jones Leads duMaurier Classic: Canada's Dawn Coe-Jones double-eagled the fourth hole and shot a course-record 64 yesterday to take a one-stroke lead in the duMaurier Classic in London, Ontario.
Coe-Jones sank a 4-iron approach from 179 yards on the par-5 fourth to get to five-under par in the final major of the season on the LPGA Tour.
She finished eight under in getting six birdies against one bogey on the 6,331-yard, par-72 London Golf and Country Club course. (AP) SOCCER  U.S.
Trounces Qatar  Judah Cooks scored three goals and led the United States to a 5-1 victory over Qatar yesterday in their Group C preliminary match at the FIFA Under-17 World Soccer championship in Tokyo. (AP) BOWLING  Williams Seeded No. 1  Walter Ray Williams Jr. won five consecutive matches Wednesday night to secure the top seeding in the $125,000 Paula Carter's Homestead (Fla.) Classic and a chance at his seventh Professional Bowlers Association title of the season.
Williams, 33 years old, of Stockton, Calif., finished with a pin fall of 11,040 for 48 games to grab the top qualifying spot in the final stop of the P.B.A.'s summer tour. (AP)


The Least of the East Beats Worst of West
Six months ago, the Mets would have probably laughed if told they would hold a lot of the same wants, desires and fears as an expansion team like the Colorado Rockies.
But there they were last night, two clubs each in last place in their respective divisions harboring the same goals: not to finish 28th and last in the overall major league standing and not to wind up with the ignominious total of 100 or more losses.


Martial Gymnastics in High School
Martial-arts styles in the movies come and go like dance crazes.
One year, karate is the fashion, the next it's tae kwan do.
"Only the Strong" is the first Hollywood film to feature capoeira (pronounced cop-WAY-ruh), the fusion of dance and combat that was developed by Brazilian slaves in the 16th century as a defense, masked as entertainment, against white colonials.
Introduced by Mark Dacascos, a gymnastic wonder without a trace of acting ability, capoeira looks suspiciously like the lambada of martial-arts styles.
Although it outdoes competing forms in show-business flash, capoeira is a wildly impractical form of self-defense.
Capoeira can deliver lethal blows, but only after an elaborate windup involving quadruple handsprings or multiple cartwheels.
A percussive musical accompaniment featuring the berimbao, a bow-and-arrow-like traditional instrument of Brazil, is often called for.


Market Place; Information was the key in the selloff of BJ Services stock.
SELL on the rumor, buy on the news.
That's Wall Street's advice for individual investors.
But the pros have a different refrain: sell when company officials tell you the news, buy when they tell everyone else.
Such was the case the last two days with the BJ Services Company, an oil and gas services concern.
After rising fairly steadily since the middle of last month, the price of BJ stock began to fall precipitously on Wednesday, dropping $1.875 to close at $26 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The selloff continued yesterday morning, with the shares falling as much as $4.25, to $21.75, before trading was halted.

Israeli warplanes fired missiles today at a mountainside base of Islamic militants in southern Lebanon, but no casualties were reported in the raid, apparently a reprisal for the killing of nine Israeli soldiers a week ago by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Party of God.
Israeli military officers would confirm only that there was "air force activity" in southern Lebanon, but gave no details.


CHRONICLE
The 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, was ratified on Aug. 26, 1920.
Last night, the New York City Commission on the Status of Women celebrated the anniversary by honoring DONNA SHALALA, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, at a reception at the Museum of the City of New York on Fifth Avenue and 103d Street.
The commission said it was honoring Ms.
Shalala because "she represents an important voice for all women," and because "she has sought to understand the changing dynamics of the human family and the role of women in sciety."


With Observer Silent, NASA Now Envisions 'Star Wars' Explorers of Mars
With nearly all hope gone for the recovery of Mars Observer, space officials and engineers began casting about yesterday for new ways to explore the red planet.
One of the most intriguing ideas calls for modifying small, inexpensive satellites being built for the "Star Wars" missile defense system and launching a fleet of them toward Mars in 15 months.
The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, the new group running the "Star Wars" project, has been asked by civilian space officials to determine if such an emergency mission could be prepared that soon and report its preliminary recommendations next week, Government officials and outside experts said.


Critic's Notebook; Beyond Iron John? How About Iron Jane?
IN the 1980's, the women's movement begat the men's movement, which in 1990 begat a boisterous best seller by the poet Robert Bly called "Iron John." Now, "Iron John" has indirectly begotten two other best sellers that attempt to transfer Mr.
Bly's shamanistic advice from the world of men to the world of women.
"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype," by the Jungian analyst Clarissa Pinkola Estes, has just celebrated a year on the New York Times best-seller list.
"A Woman's Worth," by Marianne Williamson -- the popular New Age guru, who wrote the best seller "A Return to Love" -- recently passed its third month in residence there.
Certainly it's no secret that books about the gender wars fly out of bookstores.
There is a lot of anxiety out there about the shifting roles of men and women, not to mention the time-honored difficulties of courtship and marriage, and that anxiety sells a lot of books.

U.N. Chief Asks for End to Haitian Oil Embargo
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked the Security Council today to lift a trade embargo it placed on Haiti in mid-June in an attempt to force the Haitian military rulers to return the nation's exiled President to power.
The Secretary General's recommendation followed by a day the Haitian Parliament's approval of a new Prime Minister, Robert Malval, who had been the choice of the ousted President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.


Statues in Silent Grief Bring Terrorism Home
EACH day, hundreds of commuters who would ordinarily zip past the Morristown Muncipal Hall stop in their tracks, round the parking circle out front and warily approach the west lawn.

Then they freeze.
If the sculptures look provocative from the road, they are positively unnerving up close.


Dehere's Sights Are on Juvenile Record
Dehere, widely regarded as the early favorite for next year's Kentucky Derby, was cast in a new role today as he headed for his next major race, the $200,000 Hopeful Stakes on Sunday.
If he wins, he will become the first horse in 77 years to win the three stakes for 2-year-olds at Saratoga Race Course: the Saratoga Special, the Sanford and the Hopeful.
It's noteworthy enough for any horse to win three stakes races in one month's time.
But nobody has swept the three juvenile stakes at Saratoga since Campfire did it in 1916, and so Dehere has a chance to add some history to his perfect record.


Dinkins and Lawyer for Hasidim Spar on Crown Hts.
Mayor David N. Dinkins and a lawyer representing Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights faced off for a second day yesterday in a session that became so combative that a Federal judge directed the Mayor to simply answer his interrogator's questions about the violence that racked the Brooklyn community two years ago.
"I think it would be best if the witness answers 'yes,' 'no' or 'I don't remember,' " Federal Judge Reena Raggi said after lawyers for the city and the Hasidim broke off an acrimonious session at Gracie Mansion and rushed to her Brooklyn courtroom with their grievances over the Mayor's deposition.

Eddie Bauer Inc., the Redmond, Wash., purveyor of outdoor apparel and gear, and Quintessence Inc., a Chicago company that sells mass-market fragrances like Jovan Musk and Aspen, are teaming to introduce a line of men's fragrance and grooming products called Eddie Bauer Adventurer.


Old Favorite Produces New Trick
The sentimental hero of Saratoga racing, the 8-year-old gelding Fourstardave, ran his 83d race today and made it a melodrama.
He buckled coming out of the gate, nearly fell to one knee, straightened up and ran the race of his life.
He won it by a neck, but was then disqualified for bumping another horse in the homestretch.
The scenario proved a huge disappointment to Richard Migliore, who rode the old star; to Richard Bomze, who owns him; to Leo O'Brien, who trains him, and to the thousands of fans who cheered him.
This was the same 8-year-old who ran second to the renowned Lure a month ago, then came back to win his next race and keep his streak alive, winning for the seventh year in a row at Saratoga Race Course.


Keep Sound of Real Strings in Broadway Pits
To the Editor:
Contract negotiations regarding Broadway musical productions between the League of American Theaters and Producers and Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians will soon be upon us.
Among other issues, the most significant item on the negotiating table is the league's demand to eliminate 40 percent of the size of all theater pit orchestras on Broadway.
This could remove all acoustic strings (violins, violas, cellos) in future Broadway productions and replace the sound of strings with a synthesizer.


Death in the Rain Forest
The details remain sketchy, necessarily so.
It was only in the 1970's that Brazil's Yanomami Indians first came into contact with the modern world; even today their ability to communicate with outsiders remains limited.
But Brazilian authorities believe that earlier this month gold miners illegally prospecting on the Yanomami reservation sadistically massacred 73 Yanomami men, women and children with machetes and guns and burned down their village -- Brazil's worst such incident in nearly a century.
Journalists have been barred from the scene while the investigation continues, a worrisome sign given Brazil's long record of indifferent protection of Indian rights and its failure to punish any culprits in 16 previous Yanomami massacre incidents.


Review/Jazz; Take a Trio And Send In The Horns
It's an old idea, but one that's not done that often: pair up a working piano trio with some horns and try to make a group out of it.
At Sweet Basil, the Cedar Walton trio is supporting a front line that includes Philip Harper on trumpet, Steve Turre on trombone and Javon Jackson on tenor saxophone.
The group's first set on Tuesday night, not surprisingly, had the trio producing more music than the soloists.
Mr.
Walton works regularly with the bassist David Williams and the drummer Billy Higgins, and for the first set it was their interplay, and especially the performance-shaping improvisations of Mr.
Higgins, that defined the show.
He put on an often astonishing performance, changing textures and dynamics with ease.
He puffs up his sound and slims it down, moving from his bass drums and toms to the steely swing of his ride cymbals.
He's fascinated with quoting different rhythmic ideas and grooves, and he'd switch rhythms not only from section to section, but within eight-bar phrases as well.


Coleman's Tarnished Met Career Is Finished
The Mets ownership, in the first step of what it promised would be a significant cleanup of the clubhouse, announced yesterday that Vince Coleman's playing career with the Mets was over.
The decision effectively brings to a conclusion the abjectly unsuccessful project embarked on when the Mets signed the outfielder to a controversial four-year $11.95 million contract before the 1991 season.


Rhode Island Justice Denies Ethics Charges
Thomas F. Fay, the Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, pleaded not guilty today to charges that he used his position to funnel legal work to a business partner.
State District Judge Robert Rahill, who presided at the arraignment, released the Justice on his own recognizance.
Justice Fay stepped down from the bench on Wednesday, pending resolution of the case against him.

Clues Hinting at Terror Ring Were Ignored, Officials Say
Important clues pointing to a Muslim terrorist ring that the Government charges was centered around Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman came to the attention of authorities more than a year before the bombing of the World Trade Center, but were not followed up for reasons that remain unclear or disputed, according to court papers and Federal officials.
As far back as November 1991, Wednesday's sweeping new indictment said, Mr.
Abdel Rahman tried to get a secret Government informer to kill President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
But investigators who learned of the approach discounted it as just another manifestation of the fundamentalist cleric's well-known antipathy toward the secular Egyptian regime, officials said yesterday.

Art in Review
'Indian Territories' '20th-Century Native American Artists Dismantle 19th-Century Euro-American Myths'
Renee Fotouhi Fine Art  16R Newtown Lane  East Hampton, L.I.  Through Sunday
This flawed yet provocative group exhibition is more rough outline than finished show.
Crowding together works by contemporary artists of American Indian descent and 19th-century images of their ancestors by Europeans and European-Americans, it is too often sketchy and imprecise, short on the dreaded Q word (quality) in either century, and plagued by a number of fashionable tics.
The most prominent of these are the tedious and simplistic labels explaining the sins of the 19th-century photographs and paintings and the deconstructive intent of the contemporary efforts.


Shift Expected on Computer Exports
In a review that is likely to lead to substantial liberalization in the control of computer exports, the Commerce Department said yesterday that it had found machines widely available internationally that are five times as powerful as the current international export limits.
The report came just a day after the Clinton Administration banned some technology exports to China for violations of an international arms control agreement.


For Children
'Grave of the Fireflies'  Recommended ages: 8 and up
Toward the beginning of this elegiac and riveting video, Seita, who is 14, and his 4-year-old sister, Setsuko, sift through the rubble of Kobe, Japan, left heavily damaged by American firebombs.
"Grave of the Fireflies," a 1988 Japanese video with English subtitles, was recently released in the United States.
The animated story, about two children orphaned at the end of World War II, is not for every child.
Based on an autobiographical novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, the video, with its muted, delicate colors, almost like a Japanese brush painting, softens the ugly reality the children face.
After their mother dies (as she dies, she is shown wrapped in bloody bandages), they eventually settle in an abandoned bomb shelter.


Another Season of Sounding Off

A Crucial Battle In the Revolution
A vast enemy fleet -- twice the size of the Spanish Armada -- lay in wait in New York Harbor the last week of August 1776, poised for a battle that, but for the bravery of a band of Marylanders and the gales of a fortuitous northeaster, would have left the new American nation stillborn.
There was H.M.S.
Asia, a 64-gun man-of-war; nine other tall ships of the line, 20 frigates, a swarm of armed sloops and cutters, more masted landing craft than the eye could count, and 45,000 soldiers and sailors from England, Scotland and the Germanic principalities.
Waiting for them were 12,000 Americans.

Turner's Interest in AMC

Death of an Idealist
To Amy Biehl's relatives, friends and professors in California, the death of the idealistic, apparently fearless, 26-year-old Fulbright scholar was an act of stupefying senselessness.

12 School Districts Selected for Work Programs
Seeking to address concerns that public schools fail to prepare students for the workplace, the New York State Education Department announced today that it has chosen 12 school districts, including 4 in New York City, to develop pilot programs that make work a part of classroom study.
In announcing grants for the pilot program, state officials said they were motivated by growing evidence that high-paying careers were available only to college graduates while most high school students were qualified only for low-paying, low-skilled jobs.


WAL-MART AND TOYS 'R' US ARE CLEARED OF FRAUD
A Federal district judge in Dallas yesterday dismissed a consumer fraud lawsuit that accused Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Toys "R" Us of selling used merchandise as new.
But the lawyers who filed the complaint said they planned to bring a class-action lawsuit against the retailers on the same charges.
The Dallas lawyers filing the case, Steve Gardner and Marc R. Stanley, contended that Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us intentionally resold returned goods that were used, damaged, defective or missing parts.
The retailers denied doing anything fraudulent.


DEVICE FOR HEART LINKED TO DEATHS
A consumer group said yesterday that the Food and Drug Administration had received 322 reports of deaths in a 15-month period that were associated with defects in an electric defibrillator device.
The devices, made by the Physio-Control Corporation, are used to deliver a shock to revive patients after a heart attack.
The group, the Public Citizen Health Research Group, said the agency received 1,000 reports of defects in the devices from Jan. 1, 1992 to March 31, 1993, including those involving deaths.


Review/Music; Being Surrounded By Stockhausen In a Tanglewood Hall
By the time the second half of the concert began at Tanglewood on Wednesday night, there was an exuberant, almost celebratory atmosphere in the theater concert hall.
Most of the left and right banks of seats had been removed and stage platforms built surrounding the audience on three sides.
Some 109 student players, who had been rehearsing for three weeks, were grouped into three independent orchestras, each led by a different conductor: Reinbert De Leeuw, Oliver Knussen and Robert Spano.
Then, for the next 22 minutes, in an extraordinarily virtuosic display of coordination and dedication, the swells and exclamations of Karlheinz Stockhausen's "Gruppen fur Drei Orchester" (1955-57) swept around the hall.
A clarinet in one orchestra was answered by a muted trumpet in another.
A sudden percussive stroke simultaneously sounded in all three groups.
Waves of marimba patter were followed by almost saucy, improvisatory responses.
An electric guitar sprayed a riff at stage center; an enormous Chinese gong sounded off at the left; delicate, almost fragile harp pluckings came from the right.
Fragments and fillips were passed back and forth; glints of Serialist patter were followed by tonal harmonies or jazzy roulades; intimate chamber moments were answered by bombastic proclamations.


End of the One-Liners on the IRT; Subway Conductor and His Underground Travelogues Are Heading for Retirement
In a city that can, at times, feel oppressively anonymous and automated, Harry Nugent has put a human spin on things, his particular thing being the subway.

Yugoslavs Tell World Court They Have No Bosnian Role
Lawyers for Yugoslavia told the World Court today that their Government had no territorial ambitions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and was not supporting any militia forces there.
"Yugoslavia cannot be held responsible at all for the course events have taken on the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Hezegovina, nor for any crimes, including the crime of genocide," said Miodrag Mitic, chief legal officer of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry.
"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has no paramilitary of any kind, either within or out of its territory."


Martinez Rejects Trade
In one of the most intriguing off-field moves of the season, the Atlanta Braves have successfully prevented the San Francisco Giants from getting Dennis Martinez for their pitching staff.
But the Braves also failed to get Martinez because he snubbed them, opting to remain with the Montreal Expos instead of accepting a trade.
According to two baseball sources, the Braves, Giants and Philadelphia Phillies claimed Martinez this week when the Expos placed him on waivers.
The second-place Braves, the sources said, claimed him not because they wanted him but to prevent the first-place Giants from getting him.


NUCLEAR INDUSTRY SEEKS INTERIM SITE TO RECEIVE WASTE
After decades of pushing for a permanent repository for radioactive wastes from power plants, the nuclear industry is reluctantly concluding that a central temporary storage site will be needed before a permanent one can be ready, and that a pile of money is waiting for anyone who provides the land for it.
The industry, with 110 plants producing electricity across the nation, is paying hundreds of millions of dollars a year into a fund managed by the Department of Energy that can be used for an interim site.

My recent talks with NBC failed to produce an agreement; ergo, there was no attempt to renegotiate. As announced last Tuesday, my departure from NBC was a voluntary resignation."

Washington Sit-In Leads to Arrest of Mayor Kelly


Review/Film; The Devilish Side of Max von Sydow
In the wide spectrum of films made from Stephen King's novels -- the spectrum with "The Shining" at its high end, "Misery" a few slight notches down, and all manner of misfires in the middle -- "Needful Things" occupies an unfortunate position.
Though this is by no means the grisliest or most witless film made from one of Mr.
King's horrific fantasies, it can lay claim to being the most unpleasant.
Why?
Because when you strip away the suspenseful buildup to a King story, you're often left with mechanical moralizing and crude, sophomoric small talk.
"Needful Things" has more of both than any film could ever need.
The alarm bell goes off immediately, with an opening sequence that presents Amanda Plummer acting wide-eyed and loco, forcing her odd, wispy speaking voice into an even stranger Maine accent.
When a film like this starts out at full throttle, subtlety is sure to be in short supply.
So when Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) arrives in Castle Rock, Me., to open the antiques shop of the title, it is instantly clear that Gaunt is one debonair devil.
Regrettably, the local sheriff (Ed Harris) takes an hour and a half to figure out what the audience knows from the start.

Fernandez Delivers His Sign-Me Pitch
The lines of communication within the organization haven't always been reliable or clear recently.
And so perhaps Sid Fernandez, wanting to make his intent and his talent clear, will make a fax of his pitching line from last night and send it himself to General Manager Joe McIlvaine in California.
The line read: 8 innings, 3 hits, 2 runs, 9 strikeouts.
It was good enough for a 3-2 triumph over the Rockies.
It ought to be good enough to force the Mets to agonize a bit more about what they want to do regarding their future contractual relationship with the left-hander.


School Board Split on Choice Of Chancellor
The members of the Board of Education's four-person majority disclosed yesterday in a closed meeting that they intend to support Ramon C. Cortines, a former Schools Superintendent in San Francisco, as New York City's next Schools Chancellor, school officials said.
The surprise announcement, which came after nearly two months in which the four members had publicly voiced no clear preference, led to an immediate schism on the seven-member board and set the stage for a final showdown between the majority faction and the three board members aligned with Mayor David N. Dinkins, who have said they support Gerald N. Tirozzi, the former State Education Commissioner in Connecticut.

Sports of The Times; Suddenly, Trouble In Paradise
FOR those who envision and perhaps predict a Dallas Cowboy dynasty, the most comical play of Super Bowl XXVII may prove to be the most instructive one.
It took place midway through the fourth quarter.
With Dallas leading, 52-17, Leon Lett, a second-year defensive tackle from Emporia State, scooped up a fumble and rumbled toward the goal line.
A touchdown would have given Dallas the Super Bowl scoring record.
But with 10 yards to go, Lett palmed the ball with one hand, spread his arms as if to embrace the world and began an exaggerated cakewalk to the end zone.
Just before he reached it, Don Beebe, a Bills wide receiver, ran him down and jarred the ball loose.
The ball rolled through the end zone for a touchback, and Buffalo took over.
Dallas fell 4 points short of breaking San Francisco's Super Bowl record.

When the dummy offers the possibility of a quick discard, it is often right for the declarer to seize the opportunity to dispose of a loser immediately.
But there are also some more subtle hands on which the key to success is to hold the discard in reserve.

North and South were Brady Righter of Cherry Hill and Blair Seidler of Manhattan, who finished second in the event.

U.S. Is Appealing Sentences In Rodney King's Beating
Adding another wrinkle to a case that has kept this city on edge for more than two years, Federal prosecutors announced today that they would appeal the two-and-a-half-year sentences imposed on two police officers convicted of violating Rodney G. King's civil rights.
The announcement, in the form of a notice of appeal filed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles, begins what could be a laborious phase in the protracted legal battle that began shortly after the March 3, 1991, videotaped beating in which a group of white officers clubbed, kicked and stomped Mr.
King, who is black.

All week long at the Waldbaum's Hamlet Cup, Sergi Bruguera has been saying he thinks he can win the United States Open from 10 feet behind the baseline.
The reigning French Open champion might have to rethink his strategy after tonight's 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 quarterfinal loss to Michael Chang, another baseliner, who showed he can play at the net when he has to.

Carolina's Lynch Signs With Lakers
The first-round draft choice GEORGE LYNCH, a 6-foot-8-inch forward who helped North Carolina win the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship last spring, has signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lynch, the 12th pick over all in the National Basketball Association draft, averaged 12.5 points and 7.8 rebounds in four years at North Carolina.


U.N. Lifts Haitian Oil Embargo As Junta Prepares to Step Aside
The Security Council voted unanimously today to suspend its oil embargo against Haiti, and diplomats said the first oil tankers should reach the Caribbean country within days.
The oil embargo and other sanctions placed on Haiti two months ago had a devastating effect on the country's already shattered economy and were, diplomats said, a major factor behind the ruling military junta's agreement to step down and permit the return of the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President.

CHRONICLE
Physicians at a New Delhi hospital gave MOTHER TERESA just what she said she wanted for her 83d birthday yesterday: they discharged her after treating her for a week for malarial fever.

"She was on her feet blessing other patients in the ward."


BOSNIANS CONDEMN U.N.'S PEACE PLAN
With almost all of their Croatian and Serbian colleagues on the opposite sides of this country's criss-crossing battle lines, members of the Bosnian Parliament, mostly Muslims, today overwhelmingly advocated rejecting a United Nations peace plan.
They said formerly Muslim-majority districts must be joined to a proposed Muslim-dominated Bosnian republic.
The peace plan, drawn up in Geneva earlier this month by two international mediators, Lord Owen of the European Community and Thorvald Stoltenberg of the United Nations, would reorganize Bosnia and Herzegovina into a loose union comprising a Serbian, a Croatian and a predominantly Muslim republic.


Prudential Cuts Top Tier From 5 to 2
The Prudential Insurance Company of America said yesterday that it was changing its top management structure by reducing its executive office from five members to two.

Kings Keep McSorley, Then Trade Him
MARTY McSORLEY, whose illegal stick led to a defeat for the Los Angeles Kings in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals with Montreal last spring, was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins yesterday for center SHAWN McEACHERN.

Louis Blues before trading him away.


Seeking Harsher Sentence, Judge Delays Ruling in Fraud Case
Allan David Harris did not go to prison today as expected, but that was not necessarily good news for him.
The Federal judge in Mr.

Stocks Mixed as Selloff In Bonds Limits Gains
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, with selling concentrated in blue- chip issues.
Weakening bond prices and rising interest rates played a role in limiting the market's advance, analysts said.
Anthony Ludovici, senior investment analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc., said weakness in the bond market prompted some profit taking in stocks, which have benefited from a recent surge.


Elise Reiman, Teacher Of Ballet, Dies at 79
Elise Reiman, a longtime teacher at the School of American Ballet, died on Thursday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Miss Reiman, who lived in New York, was taken to the hospital after she became ill on vacation in Winthrop, Me.


NIGERIAN DEBUNKS NEW GOVERNMENT
Moshood Abiola, who is widely believed to have won Nigeria's annulled presidential elections in June, said today that he intended to form a new government when he returns to this West African country possibly at the end of next week.
At a news conference in London, Mr.
Abiola dismissed the interim administration installed on Thursday by the departing military leader, Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida, as an attempt to continue his rule by "subterfuge."


A Powerful Typhoon Brushes Tokyo


'The West' Is Only a Flag of Convenience
Recent proposals that NATO should make guarantees or grant membership to the new states of East and Central Europe reflect a philosophical inertia, an unwillingness to jettison old concepts and modes of thought in the face of utterly changed circumstances.
Proposals for what amounts to a new NATO are based on a most questionable premise: that "the West" continues to exist as a political and military entity.
Over the last half century or so, most of us have come to think of "the West" as a given, a natural presence and one that is here to stay.
It is a way of thinking that is not only wrong in itself, but is virtually certain to lead to mistaken policies.


Putting New Strings on Long-Term Care
Many people plan for retirement, but not for the possibility that they may someday need care in a nursing home.
They often expect to fall back on Medicaid for such coverage.
The new budget law, however, has considerably tightened the restrictions on Medicaid coverage for nursing-home stays, making it more difficult for people to preserve their assets for their heirs and receive government assistance.

Charlotte Singer Morrell, co-founder of Morrell &amp; Company, wine and liquor merchants in New York City, died on Thursday at Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan.

What's Love Got to Do With It?
B.
F.
Skinner was right, it seems.
A little bit of positive reinforcement goes a long way -- witness the success of a blood drive in Paramus, N.J.
A bad economy was cutting into corporate bloodmobile donations and, combined with the slow summer months, had led to a 300-unit shortage at the Bergen Community Regional Blood Center.
But earlier this week, after just one night, a flock of donors put a big dent in that shortage.
The secret?
Singles Night at the blood bank.
Well, why not?
Revulsion at the bar scene has led to all sorts of alternate pickup venues.
First it was the gym, then the supermarket or Laundromat, then the bookstore -- anything to meet someone who is (a) unattached and (b) not an ax murderer.
No doubt it was just a matter of time before some clever soul seized on this compulsion and used it to get people to do something they'd rather not.

Belgrade Journal; They Laugh at Hatred Over the Air
Nationalist passions and the government of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, which together rule this capital, would seem nothing to laugh at.
But a band of young people armed with little more than deep sorrow at events in the Balkans and an irreverent wit have turned a semiprofessional, semilegal radio station here into a vital voice of opposition.
B-92, as the station calls itself in allusion to the emergency call number of the Belgrade police, has joined reliable, independent reporting -- rare in the media world dominated byMilosevic loyalists -- with twice-a-day rebroadcasts of news from the BBC, the latest Western rock and rap music and a steady flow of spirited satire at those on all sides it holds responsible for the Balkan tragedy.


Brooklyn's Spirited Council Race; Diverse Neighborhood Produces a Contest of Real Choices

Rivera, a candidate for City Council in the 38th District, said to most every passer-by, as if she were speaking a mantra that would help lead her to victory over the Democratic incumbent, Joan Griffin McCabe.


U.S. FORCES TO STAY IN SOMALIA TO END WARLORD VIOLENCE
American troops will remain in Somalia until violence is quelled in Mogadishu, Somali faction leaders give up their heavy weapons and the country has a national police force capable of keeping the peace, Defense Secretary Les Aspin said today.
Mr.
Aspin's remarks were the Clinton Administration's most extensive explanation of its strategy in Somalia, what it views as its successes and shortcomings, and its plans for future action.
In effect, Mr.
Aspin said there will be no quick or easy way out of a mission that began nine months ago as a relief operation but has turned into a more difficult and ambitious effort to rebuild a devastated country.


Tartabull Dresses Up In His Best Power Suit
Danny Tartabull may not ever wear the same set of clothes twice in his life, a luxurious habit that opens him up to a lot of kidding from his Yankees teammates.
The one outfit that Tartabull isn't kidded about, the one that the Yankees are desperate for him to wear -- and wear out -- is Yankee pinstripes.
For Tartabull, an instrumental part of one of the game's most finely tuned offenses, is the one Yankee depended upon to hit the ball hard as well as consistently, depended upon to keep the top-of-the-order singles hitters from colliding with the spray hitters at the bottom of Buck Showalter's lineup.
The fact that Tartabull is doing that job more than respectably is one of the key reasons the Yankees still linger near the top of the American League East.


Kevorkian Asks Judge to Dismiss A Charge of Assisting in a Suicide
As prosecutors argued that Dr.
Jack Kevorkian should stand trial under a new state law against assisted suicide, his lawyers moved today to dismiss the charge on the ground that the law is unconstitutional.
"It's not that we don't want to go to trial," Geoffrey N. Fieger, the doctor's principal lawyer, told reporters today after the opening session of a preliminary hearing in Michigan's 36th District Court.
In the past, Mr.
Fieger has said he wanted a precedent-setting trial on the issue of assisted suicide, but today he said it was possible "a trial would be more spectacular than important" if the judge did not strike down the law.


Review/Dance; The Challenge of Reviving Isadora Duncan's Art
Isadora Duncan's dances -- or what has survived of them -- look deceptively easy to perform.
A little wafting here, a little hopping there, and Isadora lives again.
But Duncan's work is actually very hard to re-create.
Hers is a technique of the heart as much as the body.
And that was proved, once more, by a program presented by the American Heritage Dance Company on Thursday night at the Theater of the West Side Dance Project.
There was no mention in the program copy of where Maria Boscaino, who re-created the evening's 11 Duncan dances, had trained in that style or who her dancers' teachers were.
The revivals relied a great deal on a rather circumscribed vocabulary of little skips with arms raised in a circle, small hops and quick arabesque jumps.
After a while many of the dances began to look too much alike.


Devil His Due Shows No Sign of Slowing
Allen Jerkens watched Devil His Due take his final warm-ups today for the Whitney Handicap, and said: "Horse of the Year? I don't even think about it. What I think about is that he hasn't raced in five weeks, he's got three more races to run and we'll go from one to the next."
Jerkens admitted that he was also thinking about the 122 pounds his star 4-year-old colt will carry for a mile and one-eighth Saturday in the 66th running of the Whitney.
He will be carrying up to 15 pounds more than his six rivals, including the Loblolly Stable's Sand Lizard, winner of the Upset Stakes here two weeks ago, and the John H. Peace entry of Dignitas and West by West, who outran Devil His Due in the Nassau Handicap at Belmont Park in June.


China Protests U.S. Trade Sanctions
China summoned the American Ambassador to Beijing today and delivered a blistering protest against the Clinton Administration's decision this week to impose sanctions over China's sale of missile technology to Pakistan.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and the official New China News Agency said the resumption of sanctions on high-technology exports would cause China "to reconsider its commitment," as the agency put it, to abide by the Missile Control Technology Regime.
Under that 1987 accord, the United States and other major powers have been trying to stem the spread of ballistic missile technology.

U.S. Subpoenas Blood-Test Files In New Health Care Fraud Inquiry
In a rapidly widening effort to root out health care fraud, Federal officials have subpoenaed Medicare and Medicaid billing records of at least five of the country's largest medical laboratory companies.
Although no charges have been brought against the companies, the investigation of the $32-billion-a-year blood-testing industry is the latest of several inquiries by law-enforcement agencies.
Federal officials have said that medical fraud may account for $80 billion to $100 billion of the more than $900 billion that Americans will spend on health care this year.
Companies Confirm Subpoenas
Corning Inc., which has the nation's largest blood-testing business, confirmed yesterday that both its Metpath subsidiary and Damon Clinical Laboratories, which it acquired last month, had received subpoenas from the office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.

Brewing Efficiency in Argentina

War in Azerbaijan Spurs Exodus
Renewed fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the last week has prompted a new wave of refugees fleeing southwest Azerbaijan and has forced the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to discontinue relief work in the region.
The new exodus is estimated at some 200,000 people along a 90-mile stretch of highway running from the town of Zengelan, on the Armenian frontier, to Imishli, about halfway to Baku, the Azerbaijan capital.
It brings the total of refugees from the war to nearly one million, according to United Nations figures.
At least half of the total have been driven from their homes during the last six months.

Judge W. CURTIS SEWELL ruled that the money should be paid into an escrow account for Reynolds, who last December won a $27.3 million judgment against the I.A.A.F. for damages he said he suffered when the federation wrongfully imposed a performance-enhancing drug suspension on him.

What's the Worst Place To Keep Art? A Portfolio
WITH the Dow industrials, the S.&amp; P. 500, the Nasdaq composite, the 30-year bond and virtually every other benchmark hitting records this week, only a contrarian would even think about collectibles.
They have been among the most disheartening investments of recent years, down there with commercial real estate and Charles Keating's junk bonds.
Everything from modern art to antique cars to ancient coins has crashed, and these disinflationary times favor no recovery.
But for someone hankering for a Greek decadrachm or a shimmering Degas, is now finally the time to buy?
Not as an investment, now or ever.
True art lovers might find value in some categories never swept by global bidding wars.
But many people who had peddled art or antiques as investments have withdrawn.


Review/Jazz; A Guitarist Who Straddles A Wide World of Styles
The guitarist and singer Bobby Parker stands somewhere between blues, jazz and rhythm-and-blues, and his show at Manny's Carwash on Thursday night, redolent of early 1960's black popular music, was an example of the synthetic nature of music from that period.
Mr.
Parker, a native of Louisiana now living in Washington, opened his show with a blues shuffle; he'd play beautifully formed blues ideas, then throw in be-bop lines worthy of George Benson.
He and his band riffed through Thelonious Monk's "Straight, No Chaser" and Sonny Rollins's "Sonnymoon for Two," and the band's bass player walked his bass lines.
Mr.
Parker, who recently released his first album, "Bent Out of Shape" (Black Top), is gifted in other ways as well.
His phrasing just makes people feel good.
Though slightly ruffled by distortion, his notes, pearly and fat, skip along to their own undulating rhythms.
And his singing, a high tenor moan, conveys more musical authority than emotional weight; on Thursday he was showing off his virtuosity there, as well.


New York City Must Preserve Heritage Better
To the Editor:
"The Brooklyn Brownstone Bluestone Blues" (Op-Ed, Aug. 14), Amy Kallman Epstein's outcry over the impending destruction of her century-old bluestone sidewalk at the hands of city-hired contractors is a sentiment shared by many who live in New York's historic neighborhoods and districts.

Contract Furor May Stall Efforts To Do New York's Work Privately
New York has done less than other cities in turning municipal services over to private companies, and its efforts may be further slowed by the recent trouble involving the Parking Violations Bureau, say city officials and government analysts.
Compared with New York's vast municipal bureaucracy and budget, the work that has been transferred to private companies under Mayor Dinkins has been modest: managing 330 centers for the elderly, custodial services at 99 public schools, and boiler inspections at the city's commercial office buildings.
A wide spectrum of New Yorkers say more should be done, from contracting out clerical work to hiring private businesses to run bridge tolls and handle water treatment.
The issue unites some members of Mr.
Dinkins's staff with business executives and critics of city government.


Aerospace Industry Seeks Weaker Sanctions on China
Aerospace industry officials said today that they would press the Clinton Administration to soften the blow of trade sanctions announced on Wednesday that bar the sale of American satellites to China.
The officials argue that the satellite sanctions -- part of a broader ban on high-technology exports that the State Department ordered to penalize China for shipping missile parts to Pakistan -- unfairly punished the satellite industry and would stop it from selling goods to China that would not be used for military purposes.


Review/Theater; An 'Othello' Outdoors, With Sirens
The main satisfaction in attending a performance of the Kings County Shakespeare Company's "Othello" in Prospect Park in Brooklyn may be akin to what Londoners felt when they flocked to the Strand to hear Shakespeare during the Battle of Britain: a sense of having done one's civic duty and paid homage to the language's greatest poet all in one fell swoop.
It is a curious compulsion in contemporary American culture to enact the plays of Shakespeare in outdoor settings during the hot summer months.
Is there a park left in America that does not have a company of actors declaiming Elizabethan blank verse over the distractions of crying babies, restless children, barking dogs, singing crickets, police car sirens and even the odd helicopter on sweltering August nights?

Conspiracy Case Against Sheik Is Risky, Experts Say
The conspiracy charges brought against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman this week were brought under an infrequently used sedition law that measures guilt by the plotting, and not the actual damage, a terrorist does.
Because the law does not require the Government to prove that the defendants committed any overt acts to further their conspiracy -- or even that they knew of all the acts the others committed -- some criminal defense experts say the law comes perilously close to punishing people for their beliefs or speech.

Schools May Be Safe, but Is the Board?
How messy can New York City's asbestos mess get?
The interim Schools Chancellor, Harvey Garner, has overruled a Queens district board that voted to delay opening its schools because of the asbestos scare.
The vote was a gesture of defiance and Mr.
Garner was right to take such decisive action.
But this clash underscores once again the lack of public confidence in the school system.
Two independent investigators are now auditing the emergency asbestos inspections.
As the Sept. 9 opening date for schools approaches, the audit may be the most reliable way to reassure parents and staff that buildings are safe.

The controllers planned to suspend all efforts to reach the spacecraft to give it 65 hours in which to respond to the most recent instructions, assuming those instructions were received and the craft is capable of radio transmissions.
Such a signal from the spacecraft would be received early Monday.

A sure topic, Israeli officials said, was a new plan that would quickly give the Palestinians authority over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho, with some form of accompanying withdrawal of Israeli forces from the two areas.


Richard Furgatch, 59, Insurance Firm Chief
Richard J. Furgatch, an insurance executive in New York for 37 years died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 59.
The cause was a heart attack, his family said.


District Told To Open Its Schools On Schedule
New York City's interim Schools Chancellor yesterday overruled a local school board's decision to postpone the opening of school for nearly a month because of its concerns about asbestos contamination.
The action came as officials heading the emergency inspection of the city's 1,069 schools for asbestos reported that the effort, which had been bolstered this week with the arrival of more inspectors, was now bogging down in mountains of paperwork.


Wetlands: Will Clinton Be Bush?
Land-use issues are always contentious, none more so than that of wetlands.
The Clinton Administration's new wetlands policy is not without unnerving flaws, including a misguided provision to turn some enforcement duties over to the Department of Agriculture.
That needs to be reversed, but otherwise the new policy makes good sense on both environmental and political grounds.
It keeps most of the important protections for the 100 million or so wetland acres that scientists agree are genuinely worth saving.
And by striking a reasonable balance between preservation and economic growth, it is likely to remove some of the heat from an issue that led to doctrinal warfare within the Bush Administration and nearly made a liar of Mr.
Bush himself.


Look for Danger Signs When Baby Gets Shots; Where New Law Fails
To the Editor:
"U.S. to Guarantee Free Immunization for Poor Children" (front page, Aug. 16), which describes the Federal Government's plan to purchase vaccines and make them available to physicians at no cost, states that some pharmaceutical companies strenuously objected to "establishing a program guaranteeing free vaccine for millions of children who are poor or uninsured." I would like to set the record straight for Merck.


These Cards Can Shop Without Using Credit
DO you dislike using a credit card to pay for a simple dinner?
Do merchants wrinkle up their noses when you pull out a checkbook?
Are you forever making a mad dash to a bank machine to get cash for a purchase?
If so, a debit card may provide some relief.
The latest versions not only let you debit your checking account at an automated teller machine, but also allow you to make purchases at a number of places.
Because these enhanced cards carry Visa or Mastercard logos, some people mistakenly believe they are intended for cash advances or credit when in fact card olders don't borrow at all.


DEMOCRATIC WHIP IN HOUSE TO FIGHT FREE-TRADE PACT
In a setback for President Clinton and the prospects for the North American Free Trade Agreement, the senior Democrat normally charged with mobilizing support in the House of Representatives for party measures says he will use the resources of his office to oppose the pact.
The Representative, David E. Bonior of Michigan, the majority whip and the third-ranking Democrat in the House, said in a telephone interview that he planned to use the staff, computers and other facilities of the whip's office to organize opposition to the pact in the House.
His decision is the latest step in an unusually public revolt against the Clinton Administration by a House Democratic leadership that is deeply divided on the merits of the free-trade agreement.


Where Kids Don't Jump; In South Africa, Basketball Languishes
Visiting South Africa earlier this year, Bob McAdoo, the American basketball master, was amazed by an apartheid anomaly: a black country where the winning basketball teams are all white.
McAdoo, a five-time All-Star in the National Basketball Association who now plays in the Italian league, was here advising the producers of a forthcoming Hollywood movie about an American coach who recruits basketball talent from Africa.
They filmed the movie, called "The Air Up There," in South Africa, but McAdoo had to import his ball-handlers from Kenya and Zaire.


Chang Finds Key in Not Standing Pat
All week long at the Waldbaum's Hamlet Cup, Sergi Bruguera has been saying he thinks he can win the United States Open from 10 feet behind the baseline.
The reigning French Open champion might have to rethink his strategy after tonight's 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 quarterfinal loss to Michael Chang, another baseliner, who showed he can play at the net when he has to.


Low Birth Rate Is Becoming a Headache for Italy
Beyond its woes of bombs and corruption, strikes and recession, Italy is slowly coming to acknowledge a far more insidious challenge that will remold society by the turn of the century, creating a land where the old outnumber the young and the big, close families of myth and tradition are gone forever.
The reasons are simple: Italians live longer than most other Europeans, statistics show, and despite the pervasive presence of the Roman Catholic Church and its dogmatic stance against birth control, Italian women now have fewer children than women in any other nation.


Met Broom To Sweep Murray Out Door
Vince Coleman is not the only member of the Mets who will be gone before the Shea Stadium cleanup is over.
The fact has been certain for a while, and it was given dramatic emphasis and clear articulation this week by the club's owner, Fred Wilpon.
To date, no names have been officially attached to the promise.
For political or personal or strategic reasons, the Mets haven't made public their departure list, and Wilpon said on Thursday he "absolutely would not" name names at the moment.


Review/Film; Clouseau Jr. Follows In Father's Missteps, But Not in His Style
The future of Blake Edwards's "Pink Panther" series, which has resumed after a 10-year absence with "Son of the Pink Panther," will depend largely on whether audiences find Roberto Benigni, the talented comic actor who has appeared in two Jim Jarmusch films, as funny as Peter Sellers.
It almost goes without saying that Mr.
Benigni's character, Jacques Clouseau Jr., the French detective who follows in his famous father's bumbling footsteps, has inherited many of the elder Clouseau's qualities.
He is indefatigably self-confident but hopelessly clumsy.
Although given to literary airs, he slaughters the language (once again a parody of French-accented English), turning flowery oratory into farcical mush.


U.S. Seeks to 'Fix' Mining Provisions of Sea Treaty
The Clinton Administration has joined more than 60 countries in a drive to renegotiate a complex and bitterly disputed section of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a treaty that has been in legal limbo since President Reagan rejected it more than a decade ago.
Negotiators at the United Nations, some of them veterans of the grueling Law of the Sea talks of the 1970's, say there is a widespread feeling that failure to resolve the lingering dispute could seriously undermine future application of the pact, which covers virtually every aspect of human activity on, over and under the ocean.


General's Father Fought for Nazi Unit
The father of Gen.
John Shalikashvili, President Clinton's choice as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, fought in World War II in a Nazi-organized unit commanded by the Waffen SS, according to documents on file at Stanford University's Hoover Institute.
Clinton Administration officials and Congressional aides said the disclosure, first reported today by the newsletter Defense Daily, was unlikely to affect General Shalikashvili's chances for Senate confirmation.


Jets Finish Exhibition Season Without Showing Much
Bruce Coslet entered tonight's game against the Redskins at R.F.K.
Stadium with three intentions: To see improvement in his team, to not show Washington too much of what might be in store when the two teams meet on Dec. 11, and to get away with one victory in the preseason.
Well, one out of three isn't bad.


Crime Rate Dropped In Meditation Period
To the Editor:
In "Genetics and the I of the Universe" (Op-Ed, Aug. 16), Robert L. Park discusses irrationality in science and refers to our recent crime reduction project in Washington, using transcendental meditation.


Florio Staff Releases List Of Bond Sellers and Fees
The Florio administration released a report on bond underwriting fees today in the hope of avoiding a threatened Republican investigation this fall when the gubernatorial race is in full swing.
But the Speaker of the Republican-controlled Assembly urged that the inquiry go forward.
He said the information given today did not go to the heart of questions about the state's bond business: What factors influenced the choice of underwriters and other firms who shared in the deals?


For Relatives of Slain Mother, Grieving Resignation
When Toya Gillard's grieving family and friends heard that a 13-year-old boy with a gun was arrested yesterday for her killing, there was no surprise or shock, only a listless resignation.
"We knew it was one of the kids," a friend said.
"We just knew."
Ms.
Gillard, a high school junior, died Thursday evening in front of her Brooklyn home as she made a frantic effort to reach her 2-year-old son, Donovan, who was in the line of fire when a gunfight erupted between teen-agers.
She was scaling a small playground fence, her arms stretched out to her son, when a single bullet struck the back of her head, the police said.
Ms.
Gillard was 17.


Lane-Switcher Is Held On Paperwork Charges
THIS is an actual story from the annals of crime and law enforcement.
On the morning of June 22, at 8:45, Linda Walbridge and her husband, John, were driving to work.
Mrs.
Walbridge was behind the wheel.
Her husband usually drove on the trip back home.
They were on their way from their home in Bergenfield, N.J., to Columbia University, where Mrs.
Walbridge was the assistant director of the Middle East Institute, and her husband worked as a Persian scholar.


Hearst Signs With Cardinals
The last of the National Football League's 29 first-round draft choices came to terms Friday when running back GARRISON HEARST agreed to a multiyear contract with the Phoenix Cardinals.
LARRY WILSON, the Cardinals general manager, said Hearst would practice Saturday and play in the opener Sept. 5 at Philadelphia.
"There's not much coaching in teaching a guy how to run," Wilson said. (AP)


COMPANY NEWS;
Noble Affiliates Inc., an independent energy company based in Ardmore, Okla., said today that its Samedan Oil Corporation had agreed to buy the oil and natural gas properties of FM Properties Inc. for $305 million in cash.

Challengers Sharpen Attacks on Holtzman in Heated Debate
The two challengers for New York City Comptroller sharply stepped up their attacks against the incumbent, Elizabeth Holtzman, in a debate yesterday, tying her to a host of government failures ranging from the city's budget deficit to faulty asbestos-removal in its schools.
In tones that made the first debate of the race seem tame, the challengers, Alan G. Hevesi and Herman Badillo, also questioned Ms.
Holtzman's integrity by recounting allegations that she had helped a financial company get city business in return for a campaign loan last year.

CHRONICLE
The 30th anniversary of the historic 1963 civil rights march on Washington is being celebrated this weekend in the nation's capital.
As part of the celebration, black lesbians and gay men will honor the memory of Bayard Rustin, a leader of the civil rights movement and a major force behind the 1963 march.
Mr.
Rustin, who died in 1988, was openly gay.
The Bayard Rustin Commemorative Alliance will sponsor a rally at 9:30 A.M. today at McPherson Square.
At 11 A.M., the gathering will march to the Ellipse, where it will join forces with the main anniversary march.
On Sunday the alliance will stage a performance of "Lift Ev'ry Voice" at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.


Corrections
A picture caption yesterday about the mayoral campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani misstated the affiliations of corrections and court officers who endorsed him.
They did not represent unions; they were members of fraternal organizations -- the Maccabee Association for the Department of Correction, the Columbia Society of Corrections Officers and the Shomrai Tzedek Society of Court Officers.


Carmine Cincotta, Television Producer, 41
Carmine Cincotta, who won eight Emmy Awards while producing the local sports reports of Sal Marchiano, Warner Wolf and Len Berman, died of Hodgkin's disease Thursday night.
He was 41.
Mr.

Fatal Fall Investigated
A Bronx man who fell to his death from the roof of a six-story building was pushed by two other men, witnesses told the police last night, according to a police spokeswoman.
The victim, who had not been identified early this morning, died after a fall about 6 P.M. yesterday from the roof of 2518 Webb Avenue in the Kingsbridge section, Sgt.
Tina Mohrmann, the spokeswoman, said.
Sergeant Mohrmann said the witnesses told investigating officers that they saw a struggle, heard the man screaming and saw him fall.
She said the victim died at North Central Bronx Hospital.


Chrysler Seeks Union Concessions on New Hires
Following the lead of the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation proposed a contract to the United Automobile Workers today that would reduce pay and benefits for newly hired workers and require current workers to pay part of their health care.
In making their proposals, the Big Three auto makers traditionally ask for more concessions than they hope to gain.
On receiving the proposals, the union traditionally grumbles.


Banks Said To Be Freer In Lending
In a strong sign that the credit crunch may be easing, banks have become noticeably more willing to lend to businesses, including small companies, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Bank executives surveyed by the Fed said they had relaxed their terms and requirements for a wide variety of loans.
Even as standards for commercial real estate loans stayed restrictive, the bank executives reported what the Fed called a "fairly significant net easing" of standards and terms for commercial loans.
A Broad-Based Shift
About a fifth of the respondents in the August survey eased standards for approving loans for medium and large businesss.
And about 12 percent eased standards for small borrowers.


Perez Still Losing, but Yanks Still Sharing First
Melido Perez trudged to the mound every five days last season, pitched valiantly and usually was starved for run support.
Perez could have contended for the Cy Young Award if the Yankees had scored more than the 28 runs they furnished in his 16 losses.
He struggled to discuss his misfortune.
His story was sad.
Perez's story is sad for another reason this season because he cannot make important pitches when he needs to, cannot even win two straight decisions and cannot really validate his spot in the rotation.
With 32 games left in what could be a final month of scoreboard watching, waiver watching and roster jockeying, Perez continues to be miserable and continues to force the Yankees to ponder removing him from the rotation.


Review/Pop; Shades Of the Dead, With Rap
God Street Wine's fans came to dance on Thursday night at Irving Plaza, wearing their hippie clothes (plus a backward baseball cap here and there) and moving with the free-form psychedelic sway and flail.
The band, a New York club staple, is part of the wave of Grateful Dead disciples that thrives on the college circuit, along with better-known groups like the Spin Doctors, Blues Traveler and Phish.
God Street Wine's lineup almost mimics the Dead's, with two guitars, keyboards, bass and drums, and its arrangements use the Dead as a touchstone for brisk, bluegrassy rhythms and shimmering major chords.
God Street Wine has customized its jams.
Around its Dead center, it uses twin-guitar riffs out of the Allman Brothers and jazzy chords by way of Steely Dan; for a more current touch, there's some rapping.
And while the songs do stretch out for solos and group doodling, they usually have more prearranged landmarks than the Dead's repertory.
There are key changes, parallel lines for guitars and keyboard and gentle shifts of meter.


N.A.A.C.P. Rallies Against Discrimination


Review/Music; A Modern Voicing of Myth and Buddhist Belief
It was both weird and fascinating on Thursday night, in the final concert of this year's festival of contemporary music at Tanglewood, to hear a United States premiere of a work by the gifted composer Peter Lieberson that was really a kind of 19th-century monodrama.
The monodrama appealed to some 20th-century composers, like Poulenc, Strauss and Schoenberg, but in its prime, it had an almost popular following.
A poem telling a highly charged and Romantic story would be declaimed, supported by music atmospherically commenting upon the tale.
The monodrama was a sort of film score for spoken text.
Contemporary sensibilities do not react well to the form; it seems too exposed and too manipulative to be taken too seriously.


A Rare Appearance on the Links


First Exit From Open: Electronic Judge
The TEL, the tennis electronic line, will not be used during next week's United States Open, the tournament director, Steve DeVoe, said yesterday.
"Based on the number of matches we were able to run TEL and the extensive data we did on it, we encountered the normal start-up problems," DeVoe said after three days of experimentation during the qualifying rounds.
"We also had new problems we had not seen before."


A Late-Summer Rite: City Meets Country
It's nearly summer's end, and the farm families of Dutchess County are gathered at the fairgrounds here as they have gathered for generations, to celebrate together a way of life.
The poultry barn is a bedlam of crowing and honking, as noisy as a college dormitory the night that freshmen arrive.
In the sheep barn, passive-aggressive Oxfords and Dorsets and merinos sulk in their pens, taking turns at maintaining a steady ceaseless bleating.
Trying to Hold On
In the dairy barns, ranks of Holsteins, huge land-cruising milk machines, keep their owners running for shovels and pitchforks and wheelbarrows.
It is a perfect division of labor, perfectly understood: their job is to eat and produce; the farmer's is to feed and clean up.


Shakedown Cruise: Giants Carry Questions to Miami
Saturday night's game against Miami may seem to be just another preseason contest for the Giants, but it will have a bit more meaning than the other exhibitions the team has played.
Besides being the final tuneup for the regular-season opener against Chicago, it will be the first time in the preseason that the starting left side of the offensive line -- left tackle Jumbo Elliott and left guard William Roberts -- will be together.


Observer; Man Here Can't Jubilate
Another excited newspaper piece about the revolution in communications.
Something about telephones.
Fiber-optic wires.
Wires?

Maybe all it said was just plain simple "fiber optics." Wires are old hat.
People still say "old hat"?
Nobody wears a hat anymore.
Not for ages.
Except baseball caps.
Backward.
Why kids wear baseball caps backward?
Shields neck from sun that way.
Maybe kids afraid of turning into "red necks."
Should "red necks" be one word?
"Rednecks" without capital "r": "rednecks"?
Reminder: Can't call Indians "redskins" anymore.
Not politically correct.
Can "rednecks" be politically correct?
How about "the noble red man"?
Wants to run a gambling casino nowadays.
Just like ignoble paleface politicians.
Everybody muscling in on the old rackets all over the country.

U.S. Is Considering a 'Revolution' in Flood Control
In the aftermath of the worst flooding in American history, the Clinton Administration is seriously considering proposals to convert entire towns and some large tracts of farmland to wetlands rather than rebuilding levees to protect them.
The idea of buying up towns and leasing some farmland would be a sharp break from decades of national flood-control policy that has relied almost exclusively on the construction of levees and dams.
But faced with more than $12 billion in damage and more than 800 levees that either crumbled or were overrun by water, Administration officials are now looking at alternatives.

POSTINGS: 10 West Side Stories; Old Hotel Goes Rental
Back at the turn of the century, when the 10-story Orleans Hotel was built at 80th Street and Columbus Avenue, it numbered among its neighbors the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park and the dirt and noise of the Ninth Avenue el.
The el was demolished long ago; the museum and the park, of course, remain -- and so does the Orleans, making it one of the oldest surviving taller buildings on the Upper West Side.
For the last 13 years the former hotel, designed by Buchman &amp; Deisler, architects, provided student housing for Columbia University.
But the Columbia lion left the den in May, and the building's owners, Nora Lavori and David Sterling, are renovating their French Renaissance-style antique -- and turning the Orleans into 45 studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom rental units.

Trimmer and Seasoned, Pork Makes a Comeback
PORK has been out of fashion in recent years.
But when I was growing up, we probably ate it once a week.
A favorite method of preparation was to bake a pork chop in the undiluted contents of a can of Campbell's mushroom soup.
A cinch, every time.
But, as people began to discover other meats such as lamb and venison, pork gradually fell into disfavor.
You didn't see it on many restaurant menus anymore, unless barbecue was being served.


With Business Weak, Stocks Are Strong
AFTER the Mississippi flooded and New York boiled in July, August has finally produced a summer rally.
And not just on Wall Street.
Europe also is clanging along.
The economies may not be growing much, meaning that there is no great need to build plants or buy equipment.
But cash has to go somewhere, and now it is going into stocks and bonds.
Every major U.S. stock index moved to a new high last week, with the Dow Jones industrial average topping 3,600.
But it is hard to find much joy among investors.
Perhaps that reflects the fact this rally has not been like the barnburners of old.
"We have crawled higher," says Hugh Johnson, the strategist at First Albany.

Correction
A Travel Advisory report on July 4 about a computerized luggage dispatching system at Terminal 2C at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris referred incorrectly to its starting date and misstated the number of counters available.
The system will start functioning in the fall; it is not in operation yet.
Passengers will be able to check baggage at from 3 to 10 Air France counters, not 62.
A reader's letter dated July 25 led to research that uncovered the error.
This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

On Wheels -- American at 10 M.P.H.; Canadian Blues: Few Road Signs and Warm Soda
In this summer of confounding weather, it is no surprise that it was hotter cycling across Canada than the Idaho desert.
For three days, southern Ontario was awash in bleach bright sunshine and palpable humidity.
I felt I was pedaling draped with a damp shawl.
Early one morning, in fact, a fog settled in, hovering so low and so thick that for an hour or so the bike became a submarine, parting the mist and, I swear, leaving a wake.
My arms were painted with silvery dew drops and the only way I knew I was riding through farmland was from the white noise of insects singing in the corn.

Her mother, Sue Aiken, is the director of early-education services for the Allegan County Intermediate School District in Allegan, Mich.


Rain Brings Sudden Relief From Late-Summer Sizzle
At 1 P.M. yesterday, most New Yorkers who dared to venture outside felt something like Rhoda Healey, who decided to leave her air-conditioned apartment to buy vegetables at a farmers' market near Times Square, where mangos are had for a song.
"I thought, 'It's never too hot when you're saving money,' you know?" Ms.
Healey said.
But as the sweat trickled from beneath her wide straw hat on the downtown IRT subway platform, she was having second thoughts.
According to a hand-held thermometer, it was 94 degrees.

That Letter
To the Editor:
The Times, like other newspapers, has a code precluding the publication of obscenity.
Why, then, did you choose to publish Kirk S. Nevin's letter?
Surely it qualifies as obscene.
I have no doubt that a letter of the same tenor about blacks, women or homosexuals would not have been chosen for publication.


For Those Who Read Before They Dig
THERE is a familiar phrase, "Look it up." Every school child soon learns this command whether it comes from a teacher or a parent.
Gardeners have to look it up, too, and they usually have a stack of reference books handy.
If not, answers are often difficult to find.
The easiest way to solve this problem is to own a sturdy garden library.
A few general reference books will prove their merit over time.
Several books may be out of print and either the library or a second-hand bookstore would be possible sources.


Let's Keep Political Coercion Out of Religion; Growing Secularization
To the Editor:
Stephen L. Carter (Op-Ed, Aug. 15) recognizes an increasing hostility toward religion in the public sphere, but his examination of its causes and dynamics is too narrow.
Our "culture war" over the role of religious values in public life is the most recent battle in a centuries-long process of secularization, the contraction of religion from its dominant role in Western civilization to a private concern.
Professor Carter oversimplifies this long struggle by reducing it to a reaction to a single Supreme Court decision, Roe v.
Wade.


Your Home: Caveat Emptor; Buying A New House
SEVERAL years of recession and a weakened marketplace have created a host of critical but unfamiliar concerns for buyers of new and yet-to-be-built homes.
For one, it may be dangerous to assume that only the good guys are left and all the shoddy builders went under.
"Some of the quality builders were hurt badly too," said Barry Warren, a real estate lawyer in Smithtown, L.I.
"It's not necessarily a safer place than it was when real estate was booming."


County's Anti-Gay Move Catches Few by Surprise
There are not many counties in America more conservative than this one, where the main stretch of interstate highway is named for a former John Birch Society president who represented the area in Congress and where the town of Kennesaw made national news a few years back by enacting an ordinance that required all residents to keep a firearm and ammunition at home.
So it was not entirely out of character when the Cobb County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution this month condemning homosexuality, and then decided to cut off all arts financing rather than have to decide what art offended community values.


The Heat And Chang Gang Up On Edberg
After a grueling week of tennis, Stefan Edberg ran into an opponent with a little more stamina, a little more drive, a little more desire.
The result was a surprising 6-1, 6-2, victory for Michael Chang in the semifinals of the Waldbaum's Hamlet Cup this afternoon.
Chang ran down balls he had no chance on and blasted winner after winner from the baseline.
For Chang, who took only 1 hour and 9 minutes to dispose of Edberg, it marked the first time here at the Hamlet Golf and Country Club that he had not been forced into a third set.
Chang will now face Marc Rosset of Switzerland in Sunday's final.


Close Up the Summer House With a Plan
VACATING a summer home can be less hectic if a closing strategy is mapped.
The goals should be to secure the house against the elements, prevent indoor damage from pests, dampness and poor air circulation and minimize the likelihood of break-ins.
Outdoor tasks can usually be carried out well ahead of time.
They consist mostly of ordinary chores like painting, repairing siding and mending window screens, but make a point of examining the roof and chimney for damage and give priority to fixing those if time grows short.


Spreading The Wealth?
To the Editor:
I was saddened by Jill Nelson's reflections on her summers at Martha's Vineyard ("At Home on an Island," Aug. 22).


At Work; The Employee Side of Health Care
PRESIDENT CLINTON no doubt bowed to political reality two weeks ago when he announced that employers would be the linchpins of health care reform.
His alternatives were to ask people to buy health insurance on their own, a turkey sans wings, or to institute a national health plan, which surely would have snapped back into reality anyone who thought anti-Communism was dead.
The "employer mandate," as the plan is known in its current form, simply makes the current voluntary system a mandatory one, bringing into the fold employers who, for whatever reason, decline to pay for "fringe" benefits like health care.
No one can say how many policy mutations will occur before the Administration delivers a proposal next month, much less how nibbling by Congress will reconfigure it.
The debate will likely be driven by the anxieties of small-business proprietors, who have learned the value of paying dues to leather-lunged organizations that bear their standard in Washington.
Companies of all sizes are helping to float the impression floating over the debate -- which resembles a raucous graduate-school seminar -- is that employers will simply eat the cost of increased benefits and deduct the total from the bottom line.
Bad for profits, bad for competitiveness and bad for growth, if true.

Hong Kong officials have arrested the reputed leader of a New York Chinatown gang involved in smuggling immigrants, authorities said.

Low on Cash, U.N. Cuts Back on Travel and Talk
Warning that the United Nations could run out of cash by next week, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has outlined an austerity program to curtail night and weekend meetings, trim down travel and reduce the use of translators and consultants.
"The organization runs from hand to mouth," he told the General Assembly's committee on financial matters on Thursday.
"There is nothing new about that. But today the situation is unprecedented and it is intolerable."


Annemarie Reilly, Peter Papazoglou
Annemarie Reilly, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Francis S. Reilly of Cobleskill, N.Y., was married yesterday to Peter Papazoglou, a son of Peter Pappas of Dallas and Athina Lassanianos of Athens.
The Rev.
John R. Roos, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated at St.
Mary's Church in Cooperstown, N.Y.
Mrs.
Papazoglou, a graduate of Marymount College, is an assistant vice president at the Bankers Trust Company in New York.
Her father, a retired surgeon, is the supervisor of the Town of Cobleskill.
Her mother, Caroline Reilly, is a patient care coordinator at Schoharie County Community Hospital in Cobleskill.


Craftsmanship For Penny Pinchers
NORMAN BLECKNER'S apartment in Manhattan is a dynamic private photo gallery.
He is an amateur photographer whose primary interests are panoramas and multiple images.
Yet he does not own a panoramic camera; he creates everything using a standard 35-millimeter camera.
Although he is an executive for a company that creates exhibits for trade shows, in his own photography he uses inexpensive and widely available tools and materials.
He does not have shelves of camera equipment or a darkroom, yet his work is printed, mounted and framed with craftsmanship.
He simply knows how to get the most from photographic retailers.


Let's Keep Political Coercion Out of Religion
To the Editor:
"Conservatives' Faith, Liberals' Disdain" (Op-Ed, Aug. 15) by Stephen L. Carter of Yale Law School, a rambling article on the role of religious activism in public life, suffers from historical misreading, as well as conceptual confusion.
Professor Carter declares that the young Republic deemed religion "so important that the Constitution was amended to protect its free exercise," adding that "America once gloried in the smart show of religion in the public square."
On the contrary, the nation's founders were deeply mistrustful of "enthusiasm," and in constitutionally protecting religious expression, they also hoped to confine it mainly to the pulpit and to safeguard the public square from sectarian squatters.


Legal Gambling Faces Higher Odds
STEP UP and bet those dollars.
Roll the dice at the Indian casinos.
Try the state lottery.
Climb aboard the bobbing riverboats.
Who cares what.
Just gamble!
That seems to be the cry across the land as politicians embrace games of chance to prop up their economies and bring in more revenue.
Ever since New Hampshire adopted the first state lottery in 1964, and especially in the last few years, legalized gambling has come increasingly into the mainstream of American leisure activity.
In 1992, a record $329.9 billion was bet on all its forms.
Once winnings were deducted, that left gross revenues of $29.9 billion for governments and gaming establishments, more than six times what people spent on movie tickets.


Sign Him, Then Trade Him?
The rumored trade of guard KENDALL GILL from Charlotte to the Seattle SuperSonics seemed closer to reality yesterday when the Hornets announced the signing of Gill to a long-term contract.
With Gill no longer a free agent, his chances of finding a team interested in trading for him are paradoxically greater.
Terms of the pact were not revealed.


FIGHT SLEEPISM. NAP NOW!
James Gorman's refreshing article has done a tremendous service.
As a law student, I find few things more pleasurable than taking a nap following class.
After years of disapproving glances from sleepist roommates ("Geez, I just read all of next week's material, took a run around Central Park . . . and you're still sleeping?"), I can finally nap in peace.
ERIC LEMONT New York, N.Y.


Making Music


Seeing Britain From a Biplane
Tourists can now get an aerial view of London, Cambridge, Ely and Newmarket aboard a 1930's biplane, the De Havilland Dragon Rapide.
The aerial sightseeing tours were started this summer by a British company called Classic Wings, which has restored the biplane to comply with modern regulations.
The plane, which can carry eight passengers, cruises at 1,500 feet and travels at 100 miles per hour.
The flight over Cambridge, Ely Cathedral and the Newmarket race track lasts 30 minutes and costs about $70.
The London tour takes 75 minutes and costs about $130.
Both flights take off from Duxford airport, formerly a Royal Air Force base, 48 miles northeast of London.


UNCLE MILTY'S LOST KIDS
You report that "Hershey figures that an extremely intelligent child is likely to do well enough in life almost regardless of the neighborhood." That misperception has cost this country many intelligent students whose gifts were never nurtured in an environment appropriate to their intellectual needs.
Our prisons are peopled with an inordinate number of "extremely intelligent" individuals whose gifts were diverted to antisocial pursuits.


Take That!


Saving Taxes and Open Spaces, Too
JULIE ZAYKOWSKI and her family had a novel response when she learned last year that, because of a radical change in how assessments are calculated, the property taxes on the 77-acre swath of woods and wetlands that her family has owned for 42 years in North Haven on the East End of Long Island would soar by 1,300 percent.
They gave away most of their development rights.


The Week Couldn't End Too Soon


Currency Crisis In Europe Lifts Dollar
Europe's latest bout of currency turmoil should mean that American travelers will get a little more for their dollars in Europe.
This month the European Community finance ministers and central bankers agreed to let their currencies rise or fall as much as 15 percent above or below target rates -- far wider swings than in the past.
For European nations, the move means governments now have more leeway to lower interest rates to try to lift their economies out of recession, and that should reduce the value of European currencies against the dollar.

A Hose-Down on the Run


It's All In the Delivery
To the Editor:
Having read Molly Haskell's tribute to Mae West  [ "Mae West's Bawdy Spirit Spans the Gay 90's," Aug. 15 ] , I should like to point out that in the play "Diamond Lil," as in the film version, "She Done Him Wrong," Mae's line is: "Come up some time and  [ pause ]  see me." I saw a revival of the play in the early 50's and the scene went like this:


Evelyn Lovett, Jeffrey Shumlin
Evelyn deHaven Lovett, a daughter of Mrs.
Robert S. Lovett 2d of Greenville, Del., and the late Mr.
Lovett, was married yesterday to Jeffrey Prins Shumlin, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
George J. Shumlin of Putney, Vt.
The Rev.
Adam Lewis performed the Episcopal ceremony at Christ Church Christiana Hundred in Greenville.
Ms.
Lovett, who is keeping her name, graduated from Wesleyan University, as did her husband.
Until recently she was with the School for International Training in Brattleboro, Vt., where she was the admissions counselor for the college semester abroad department.
Her father was a manager of the biomedical department of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company in Wilmington, Del.
Her paternal grandfather, the late Robert S. Lovett, was Secretary of Defense in the Truman Administration.


Weary of the Hostility, a City's Blacks Will Go
Six months ago, John DecQuir Sr. moved into a public housing project in Vidor, becoming the first black resident of the southeast Texas town since the 1920's.
"Faith can move mountains," he said then.
"This ain't nothing but a molehill."
Now, his faith shaken, Mr.
DecQuir plans to move.
The optimism he had when he arrived has been eaten away by the hostility in the complex and around town, said his lawyer, Tom Oxford.


Overconfidence Is One Thing Jets Don't Worry About
The Jets are hoping that the old cliche that preseason records have little or no bearing on the regular season will hold true for them, particularly since they dropped all four exhibition games this season, including a 17-3 loss to Washington on Friday night.
"At least we won't go into the season with a false sense of security," said quarterback Boomer Esiason, alluding to the team's 5-0 finish in preseason play last year.


Rachel C. Eisler, Geoffrey H. Genth
Mr. and Mrs.
Colin Eisler of New York have announced the engagement of their daughter, Rachel Charlotte Eisler, to Geoffrey Hawthorne Genth, the son of Jane W. Genth of Riverdale, the Bronx, and Michael Genth of Miami Beach.
A December wedding is planned.
Ms.
Eisler, 29, graduated from Yale University and received a master's degree in writing from Johns Hopkins University.
She is to become an English teacher in September at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore.


Stephanie Zolet, Alan J. Fineman
Linda and Lee Zolet of Wellington, Fla., have announced November wedding plans for their daughter, Stephanie Jo Zolet, and Alan Jeffrey Fineman, a son of Helen and Ted Fineman of Clearwater, Fla.
Ms.
Zolet, 26, graduated from the University of Maryland.
She is a gerontologist at the Parkway Regional Hospital in North Miami, Fla.
She received a master's degree in gerontology from the University of South Florida, from which her fiance received an M.B.A.
Her parents own the Zolet Arts Academy, an art and drama school in Wellington.


Pain Is Still There for Ryan
NOLAN RYAN's return to the Texas Rangers' rotation remains on hold after he threw for five minutes yesterday in Arlington, Tex.
He said the pulled muscle in his left rib cage gave him discomfort after only a few pitches and he stopped throwing to avoid further damage.


FIGHT SLEEPISM. NAP NOW!
Not to harp on an old refrain, but James Gorman fails to mention any of history's great feminine nappers.
Did Lillian Hellman doze off during opening night?
Did Georgia O'Keeffe catnap while Stieglitz fiddled with the lights?
In my experience, every great napper needs an enabler: someone to hush the children, field the phone calls, get dinner started.


Joseph DePietro Jr. and Molly Mone
Maureen Reidy Mone, a model, and Joseph Vincent DePietro Jr., an institutional government bond broker, both in New York, were married yesterday in Oyster Bay, L.I.
Msgr.
Charles Ribaudo performed the ceremony at St.
Dominic's Roman Catholic Church.
The bride, who is 22 and known as Molly, is a daughter of Mathias and Maureen Mone of Plandome, L.I.
She attendedVillanova University and works for Liz Claiborne Inc., the clothing manufacturer.
Her father is a partner in the New York law firm of Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel.


Poisoning The Well?
To the Editor:
As an art historian completing a doctoral dissertation about Harold Rosenberg at CUNY Graduate School, I should like to add a comment to Michael Kimmelman's essay on the biography of Elaine and Willem de Kooning by Lee Hall, "Elaine and Bill: Portrait of a Marriage"  [ "The Peephole Approach to Artist Couples," Aug. 15 ] .


Caroline T. Oolie and Marc J. Gross
Caroline Tamar Oolie, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Sam Oolie of North Caldwell, N.J., was married last evening to Marc Jonathan Gross, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
C.
Alan Gross of Boca Raton, Fla.
Rabbi Norman Patz officiated at the Metropolitan Club in New York.
Mrs.
Gross, 25, is studying for a master's degree in occupational therapy at New York University.
She graduated from Ithaca College.
Her father is the chairman of Oolie Enterprises, a venture-capital company in Fairfield, N.J.


Views of Spain, Through Foreign Eyes
An unsung treat in the summer exhibition season in New York is "Spain, Espagne, Spanien: Foreign Artists Discover Spain 1800-1900." Housed in the Equitable Gallery at Seventh Avenue and 51st Street, and organized by Suzanne L. Stratton for the Spanish Institute, its 50 or so items offer some quiet enjoyment in a neighborhood not overstocked with serious art.
The title says something specific.
This is not a show about foreigners who were bowled over by Spanish art.
It is a show about painters -- French, German, American, British -- who discovered Spain itself at a time when it was not yet on the standard tourist routes.


Everything Is Great! Just Great!
Anybody planning to read brochures about the coming music season should first check his or her hospitalization insurance.
It's like stepping off the curb and getting hit by a truckload of hyperbole.
America's wondrous ethnic diversity continues to enrich the English language, but its weakness for mountainous molehills undermines a lot of the effect.
Everyone, for example, is pretty much hardened to Lincoln Center's calling its concerts the work of Great Performers, but it still makes one yearn for Garrison Keillor and Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery Store.
Great Performers 1993-94, some 71 events by my count, does offer a fair amount of pretty good, a broad spectrum of not bad at all and smatterings of simply terrific.


Saturns And Such
WHEN it comes to buying cars, I am a slow study.
I dither.
I think about my wallet and shift from foot to foot.
I go away and come back, and the whole thing takes a while.
But a surprising number of people are like my friend Joe Burke, who told me three weeks ago that he had to have a car right now.
Instantly.
When he turned the wheel of his old car, Joe said, the vehicle only sort of ambled in that direction.
Dangerous, he said, and he didn't want his wife, Gladys, driving it.


Back When Antiques Were New
Jane C. Nylander, the director of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, invites her readers to enjoy her copious knowledge of the interiors and domestic management of late-18th-century New England homes.
The imaginatively illustrated OUR OWN SNUG FIRESIDE: Images of the New England Home, 1760-1860 (Knopf, $30) is dedicated to the notion that the details of everyday life form the core of human experience.
The author uses artifacts and literary and graphic recollections of 19th-century New Englanders to describe in rich detail a ceaseless round of household activities.
She explicates the laborious processes by which New Englanders produced their food, clothing and light and kept themselves clean and warm.
Ms.
Nylander walks the reader through heating a New England home in winter, preparing an 18th-century dinner and washing and ironing the colonial laundry.
Although Ms.
Nylander warns of the 19th-century antiquarians' tendency to idealize and sentimentalize an undemocratic age, she does not screen her own firesides from these same weaknesses.
Here and there a disturbing shadow flickers across the cheery, blazing hearth -- for example, the black mother who retrieves her daughter from service with a white family despite the mistress's protests.
These and other scenes go unremarked upon, but the shadows remind us of other New England firesides, not so snug yet equally our own.


Syracuse Bans Professor in Lacrosse Case
A sociology professor at Syracuse University has been banned from teaching there after a lacrosse player said he had been given an "A" before he did any course work.
The professor, GUNTER REMMLING, will spend his time doing research, then retire in about two years, said JOHN L. PALMER, dean of the university's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.

Jennifer Nelsen, Andrew Colao
Jennifer Kay Nelsen, a daughter of Dolores Nelsen of Lombard, Ill., and the late Reese Nelsen, was married yesterday to Andrew Joseph Colao, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Anthony Colao of Cliffside Park, N.J.
The Rev.
Jack Peterson officiated at St.
Catharine's Roman Catholic Church in Spring Lake, N.J.
Ms.
Nelsen, 26, is keeping her name.
In September, she is to begin as an associate at the New York law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, where her husband is an associate.
She graduated magna cum laude from Smith College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and received a law degree from the University of Virginia.


Power Mower
WEST 71st Street comes to a halt at a chain-link fence high above the biggest parcel of vacant land in Manhattan.
Ailanthus trees, piles of concrete and hunks of metal poke up from the weeds six stories below.
Looking down on this miserable plot that seemed tailor-made for a toxic waste dump, Stanley J. Herd saw a rich canvas ready to be primed.
He could start this fall by sowing three of the 74 acres in winter wheat that would sprout rich and green.
Come spring, the wheat would turn into golden waves ready to be cut.
Using nothing but a weed trimmer and push mower, he could carve the undulating image of trees and clouds that has occupied his mind since childhood.

SOUTHERN NOVEL THE LAUGHING PLACE By Pam Durban. Scribners, $21.


A Beauty, And Beast
A beetle that loves Asiatic lilies -- and eats all the leaves right down to the stem -- has somehow entered the United States and is proliferating in the Boston area.
Lilioceris lilii, the lily-leaf beetle, is a beautiful tomato-red insect with black legs.
A lot of people mistake it at first for a ladybug, but it has no spots and it is shaped more like a lightning bug -- oblong rather than round.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
THE TRENCH: Volume 2 of the "Cities of Salt" Trilogy By Abdelrahman Munif.
Translated by Peter Theroux.
Vintage International, $14.
Originally published in Lebanon, and banned in Saudi Arabia, this novel chronicles the life of a fictional Arab town as it is transformed by the discovery of oil.
In 1991 our reviewer, Francine Prose, said, "Mr. Munif's wonderful novel is a welcome corrective" to the stereotypes of Arab culture.
"One wishes that it were required (or at least suggested) reading for every American."


Is Economic Integration A Constitutional Right?
With regard to your article on the Yonkers Housing situation  [ "Years After Bias Ruling, Yonkers Still a House Divided," Aug. 15 ] , no one has as yet addressed the most important point of the housing issue: Is economic integration a constitutional right?
If it is, why do not all Americans have the same right?
If it isn't, why are some Americans afforded this as a right while others are not?
Some people have called attention to the fact that these Americans have suffered greatly and have been severely wronged and so we are making an exception to make amends.


AUGUST 22-28: Fact, Rumor, Innuendo; Michael Jackson's Home Raided for Evidence
In Hollywood, press agents mold the public images of the entertainment industry's superstars , controlling information spooned out to an often pliant press.
But once in a while, the monster they have created turns on the celebrities, and that was Michael Jackson's unfortunate fate last week.


Tolchin Lashes Out, But Feiner Is Elusive
ON the surface, Susan P. Tolchin says she is running for town supervisor here because a municipality with a $36 million annual budget needs an experienced administrator like herself at the helm.
The 48-year-old Hartsdale resident, a Democrat who has served for 14 years as Greenburgh's Town Clerk, says she is a competent, professional manager who can "identify goals, set priorities and follow through with action."
But Mrs.
Tolchin's campaign also has another side to it -- a desire to finally put to the test her ongoing criticism of the incumbent Town Supervisor and fellow Democrat Paul J. Feiner, of Hastings-on-Hudson, who is serving his first term in office.


AUGUST 22-28: High-Tech Exports Cut Off; Washington Penalizes China For Missile Technology Sales
President Clinton is reluctant to use trade as a foreign policy lever, as he showed in May when he decided to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status in spite of concerns about human rights violations.
But last week, citing evidence that the Chinese had violated an international arms control agreement by selling sensitive missile technology, the Administration imposed limited sanctions.
The State Department said it would ban $1 billion in American high-technology exports to China over the next two years to penalize Beijing for selling components to Pakistan that could be used to build a missile to carry nuclear warheads.
Such sales are barred under the Missile Technology Control Regime, which China has not signed but has promised to follow.
United States law requires trade sanctions against a country that violates the treaty.

C.I.A. Will Open Its Files On Cold War Operations
The Central Intelligence Agency has decided to release thousands of files on its most politically charged cold war operations, including the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, the overthrow of the President of Guatemala in 1954 and the 1953 coup that installed Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi of Iran, Government officials said.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agency would make public historically significant files on every major covert operation from 1950 through 1963.
The files should be released by next year, they said.


Riyadh Spoils the Rivalry, Breaks Cane Pace Record
Presidential Ball and Life Sign entered tonight's $432,800 Cane Pace at Yonkers Raceway with the worst seats in the house, and both paid dearly for their poor starting positions.
Riyadh, who left from the No. 2 post in the first of two tiers needed to accommodate the crowded 11-horse field, went wire to wire in 1:512/5 to set a stakes record.
Driven by James Morrill Jr., Riyadh withstood a challenge from Life Sign at the half and pulled away at the three-quarter mark to capture the first leg of pacing's triple crown, beating stablemate Presidential Ball by three lengths, with Life Sign finishing third, five and three-quarters lengths back.


Don't Walk
When a wheelie-popping motorcyclist killed 82-year-old Maria Ramona Perez on Audubon Avenue at 6 P.M. on Aug. 10, she became just another casualty in the war against New York pedestrians.
The unlicensed 22-year-old motorcyclist who killed Perez is part of an alarming new trend -- an increased incidence of drivers with suspended licenses knocking people to their death.
There are eight million pedestrian horror stories in the Naked City.
Here are some of them.
The most likely place to die walking is on wide arterial streets with traffic signals.
The leading streets on New York's cavalcade in 1992 were the Grand Concourse in the Bronx (10 deaths), Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan (6 deaths), Northern Boulevard in Queens (6 deaths), Queens Boulevard (5 deaths) and Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn (5 deaths).


Psychology's New Interest in the World Beyond the Self
YOU called it a vacation when you went camping.
Maybe you even told friends it was good therapy.
But you were righter than you know.
Psychology, a science born to heal the ills of alienated urban man, is taking a leaf from the books of Rousseau and Outward Bound and even the ancient Greeks.
This one goes by a new name, ecopsychology.
The movement reaches beyond psychology's conventional turf to examine the human connection -- or lack of it -- to nature itself.
In a return to Thoreau, ecotherapists see psychological uplift in wilderness experience; some are taking clients outdoors, and others take groups into the wild for extended pilgrimages.


Remedial Eating
Like eager students buying new school supplies, eaters who would be healthy begin to buckle down in fall, investing in health-minded cookbooks and nonstick skillets, exotic spice blends and oil sprays -- all in the service of stocking a low-fat larder.
Hope springs eternal.
But autumn's dietary hope is less ill-founded, say, than January's, with its repentant, post-holiday gloom, or spring's moment of panic, when swimsuit season dawns.
Smart, back-to-school eating seems to affirm the slow and steady accumulation of knowledge and to suggest, at least by association, the wisdom of slimming down at a gradual pace.


Subtle Forces And Racism
Robert Leikind, director of the Connecticut Anti-Defamation League, attributes what he sees as the rise in racism and anti-Semitism to such things as competitiveness brought on by a declining economy and the difficulty of adjusting to people who are different ("Working to Combat the Messages of Hate," Aug. 1).
While these are undoubtedly contributing causes, Mr.
Leikind does not address the much more subtle forces at work.
In the first place, the increase may well be illusory and due to a distortion of definitions.
Racism is defined by Webster as "An excessive and irrational belief or advocacy of the superiority of a given group . . . on the basis of racial difference and having no scientific validity."


Preparing for Fall, and Beyond
Continue to plant evergreens, but hold off planting deciduous trees and shrubs until they have lost most of their leaves, which will probably be in another month or so.
Water new plants thoroughly and mulch well to conserve moisture.
Finish ordering bulbs and perennials for fall planting.
If you want a new perennial bed, dig it up now rather than in the spring when the rush is on to do so many other chores.
Work in plenty of compost and manure.


Gary Chryst: A Dancer With a Distinct Difference
Gary Chryst has always been different.
Mr.
Chryst stood out even among the distinctive body shapes and personalities that once made up the Joffrey Ballet, where he performed from 1967 to 1980.
He established a reputation as one of the finest character or dramatic dancers in American ballet.
Small, slender and wiry, he looked out at the world through eyes that seemed to flame, like his dancing, with passion.
Those eyes were set in a chiseled, somewhat remote face with an exotic cast.


If Roseanne Confided in Joel and Darlene Met Dylan
When the Fall television season officially begins next month, ABC's "Civil Wars" won't be around.
But two of its characters -- Eli (Alan Rosenberg), the attorney on the verge of a breakdown, and Denise (Debi Mazar), the legal secretary with attitude -- will have moved west and joined the cast of NBC's "L.A. Law."
Meanwhile, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), who had already moved from CBS's "Golden Girls" to "Golden Palace," is expected to turn up on NBC's "Empty Nest." Her retirement home just happens to be near Dr.
Harry Weston's (Richard Mulligan's) house.


Deborah Dawn Snyder, Rick Michalek
Deborah Dawn Snyder, a principal dancer with the Joffrey Ballet in New York, was married last evening to Rick Michalek, a lawyer in New York.
Rabbi Michael Paley officiated at the Pelham Manor (N.Y.) Club Theater.
Ms.
Snyder, 34, is keeping her name.
She began dancing with the North Carolina Dance Theater in Winston-Salem, N.C.
She is the daughter of Benjamin Snyder of Lake Charles, La., and Madeline Snyder of Blytheville, Ark.


Setting Forth to Beat the Odds (Again) at College
On the long bus ride to Canton Technical College in upstate New York, where Q'hana Gethers will soon start classes, she picked at the sack lunch prepared by her grandmother and stared out the window at the unfamiliar countryside.
"I don't want to go," she said suddenly, though she has strived for years to get there.
She was headed for an orientation weekend at a school she had never seen, a weekend that was supposed to help urban freshmen -- particularly black and Hispanic students from the New York City area -- "not be as shocked when they get here in the fall," says Kahan Sablo, coordinator of the college's office of multicultural affairs.
Some of the surprises are simple, like seeing cows for the first time; others are more complicated, like being in a largely white town in the heavily agricultural "North Country" near the Canadian border.


County Westchester Still a Destination
JOHN CONCANNON, the stocky, white-haired owner of Morley's Supermarket, points with pride to three large hand-colored photographs from 1962 that hang on a wall in his store -- long an institution on Yonkers Avenue, one of the main thoroughfares of this city.
"That's my uncle, the original owner of Morley's," he said.
"And that's me, the young man holding up the bananas."
Mr.
Concannon's uncle has since died, and the years are beginning to show on the current proprietor's face.
The market itself, though, looks much the same as it did 31 years ago -- the main difference being that a new generation of Irish immigrants is helping customers nowadays as they pick over bins of vegetables and fruit outside Morley's front door or order cold cuts and soda bread inside at the deli, where the affable Mr.
Concannon presides.

As Commissioner of the Department of General Services, the city agency responsible for preserving New York's vast inventory of fine civic architecture, I must take exception to the spirit of "Streetscapes: A City-Owned Palazzo Now in Disarray" on July 25 concerning 346 Broadway.


'Men's Lives' as Cogent as Ever at Bay St.
A YEAR ago an indelible three-way link between life and art was formed in Sag Harbor.
Consider the opening of the Bay Street Theater Festival, the advent of its premiere play, "Men's Lives" and the off-stage protests over legislation that severely restricts Long Island's commercial fishermen in their lives and livelihood -- the very issue at the heart of the play.
To end the second Bay Street summer season, "Men's Lives" has returned to its birthplace in time to coincide with another chapter in living history, the settlement of a legal battle in favor of baymen's associations against General Electric over dumping chemicals in the Hudson.


Preparing for South Africa's First Multiracial Elections


Anne Fazier, Owen Dempsey
Dr.
Anne Lindsay Frazier, a pediatric oncologist, was married yesterday to Owen A. Dempsey, the president and chief executive of Endogen Inc., a biotechnology company, both in Boston.
Canon Brian Kelley performed the Episcopal ceremony at the Christ Church of Cambridge in Cambridge, Mass.
Dr.
Frazier is keeping her name.
She works at Children's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
She is also an instructor in pediatrics at Harvard Medical School there.
She and her husband graduated from Dartmouth College, from which she also recived her M.D.
She received a master's degree in public health from Harvard University.


A Mighty Hot Time for No. 1 Seminoles
The moral of the story is that we all should listen to our legends.
Gale Sayers, the most famous football player in the history of the University of Kansas, underestimated the impact of a game against Florida State when he offered the opinion that a 40-0 loss could create discouragement at the start of a long season.
He missed by 2 points.


In Feud Over Retail Empire, Family Splits in Public View
It is the stuff of television mini-series.
Street-smart dad faces off with Harvard M.B.A. son over who is in charge of family business.
Dad called philanderer by wife of 45 years.
She wants divorce.
Younger son sides with dad, older son with mom.
Midnight confrontations.
Dueling lawyers.
Millions at stake.
In the dog days of August, the capital is mesmerized by Haft vs.
Haft, the messy, titillating, back-stabbing, power-grabbing, name-calling, finger-pointing court case of the Haft family, owners of a retail and real estate empire known for getting big profits out of discounted goods.


THE GUIDE
RIVERFEST IN YONKERS
More than 12,000 people showed up at Yonkers Hudson Riverfest last year, and even more are expected Saturday when it will be held at the Larkin Plaza Recreational Pier from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M.
The event focuses on the need for environmental and cultural cooperation in Yonkers, the state's fourth-largest city.
The Sojourner Truth, a 32-foot sloop built in Yonkers as a floating educational unit, will be docked at riverside, with volunteers aboard to discuss the history and problems of the river with visitors.
Cruises can be taken aboard the the passenger yacht Port Imperial Manhattan, and other tall ships will be on display.


Reva C. Shwayder, Painter, 91
Reva Clamage Shwayder, an artist who was the subject of a documentary film that won an Academy Award, died at her home in Franklin, Mich., on Thursday.
She was 91.
The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.


Shadow Play
As August fades, the sidewalks are filled with long black shadows suggesting Giacometti sculptures.
Or could it be that Morticia, the macabre Charles Addams character, is putting out her own line of dresses?
The wearers, many of them with straight hair parted in the center and black platform shoes or Doc Marten boots, have produced a startling imagery that has gained in popularity as fashion leaders abandon summer clothes for the darker transitional colors that signal the post-Labor Day look.
What's new with this year's all-black day look is the ground-skimming hem that represents a generation gap between older women who are holding out for short skirts because they feel long ones make them look older and younger women who are forging their own identities with the novelty of longer lengths.
Two designers who have spearheaded this striking look are the Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and the Belgian deconstructionist Martin Margiela.
Whether it's with satiny one-piece black dresses or any combination of black sportswear, the effect is the same: an inky silhouette to the ground.
What many wearers have created is a surface of multiple textures that gives the all-black look depth and character.


A 'Soap' Mogul With an Eye for the 90's
Rich?
Oh, yes.
Douglas S. Cramer is rich.
The veteran and prolific -- television producer gracefully concedes the point.
Not that a denial would serve any purpose: Mr.
Cramer is, after all, seated in the living room of one of his several residences -- a gated, columned and exquisitely furnished Bel Air mansion.
His house is fully staffed with servants.
Its walls are covered with works by Roy Lichtenstein, Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Motherwell, Andy Warhol, Jim Dine and Frank Stella, among others -- just a fraction of his collection of American modern masters.
There is also a ranch near Santa Barbara, an apartment in New York, a beach house in St.
Martin.


Once More Unto la Difference
To the Editor:
"The Debate Over la Difference" (Aug. 15), an interesting piece on sex differences in corporate leadership, contains a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship of the answers to two different questions:


The Trials Of Bob Packwood
While running for reelection in 1980, Bob Packwood was eager to meet his campaign chairwoman for Lane County, Ore.
The Senator invited Gena Hutton to dinner at the motel where he was staying in Eugene for a get-acquainted meeting.
Hutton, a 35-year-old divorced mother of two, had brought along pictures of her children and even her cats.
Then it was time to go and Packwood offered to walk her to her car.
"As I started to put the key in the car door," Hutton recalls, "he just reeled me around and grabbed me andpulled me close to him." For an instant, she thought he was offering a good-night hug.
But then the Senator planted a full kiss on her lips, wriggling his tongue into her mouth.


Perspectives: Multifamily Mortgages; The Federal Role in Refinancing Perks Up
A SUBTLE SIGN of the times in housing has emerged on the East Side of Manhattan.
The Federal Government has signed a commitment to insure new long-term financing on two apartment buildings, Regency Towers at 245 East 63d Street and Ambassador East at 330 East 46th Street.
Both are unsubsidized rentals built with conventional financing by Carlyle Construction Corporation of Manhattan in the 60's.
Both, when it came time to refinance the mortgage debt, took advantage of the Government's Section 223f multifamily mortgage insurance program, available for the purchase or refinancing of buildings that are at least three years old.


Sound Bytes; So, You're a Rocket Scientist -- But Can You Program a VCR?
WHEN she hears someone say, "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to . . . (fill in the blank)," Dan Dumbacher's 8-year-old daughter, Erin, frequently replies, "Well, my daddy is a rocket scientist, ask him."
So we did, in an effort to find out whether rocket scientists do indeed have an edge in figuring out how to program their video cassette recorders or in getting a printer to work correctly with a personal computer.

When Art Becomes A Public Spectacle
In Phoenix, the old order has fallen by the wayside.
In this vibrantly adolescent city, where people dine al fresco in shopping malls beneath clouds of mechanically created mist, a fertile new vision is reshaping the land and the roads that pass through it.
Here, highway and landscape have begun to enter into a new civic partnership, one that fuses their traditional roles.
Roads, enriched with landscape and art, have become empathetic.
Land has begun to function as an engineer: a force from which the city's builders take their cues.
What gives this vision such pivotal importance is the renewed prominence of public works on the national agenda.
It's been scarcely a year since the Presidential campaign plucked the word "infrastructure" from relative obscurity and propelled it into popular consciousness.
Yet, sadly, in this brief time the word has passed from being a symbol of hope to a synonym for pork.


Rose B. Johansson, Frederick Kessler
Rose Bridget Johansson, an accountant, was married yesterday to Frederick Reed Kessler, a lawyer, both in New York.
The Rev.
Raymond Daley, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated at St.
George's Church in Hopewell, N.J.
Mrs.
Kessler, 29, graduated from Villanova University.
She is a daughter of Henry J. Johansson of Fort Lee, N.J., and Margaret M. Johansson of Yardley, Pa.
Her father is a senior partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accounting firm, in New York.


Pamela Stark, Sheldon Guyer
Pamela Norris Stark, the daughter of Kathi N. Caruso of Venice, Fla., and Wilbur B. Stark of Los Angeles, was married yesterday to Sheldon Joseph Guyer, the son of Benjamin Guyer of Margate, Fla., and the late Anna Guyer.
Judge Robert Straus of New York City Criminal Court officiated at the home of the bride's stepsister, Susan Caruso, in Glen Head, L.I.
The bride, 47, is the deputy director of the Volunteer Consulting Group in New York, consultants to nonprofit organizations.
She graduated from Goddard College and received a master's degree in education from Harvard University and an M.B.A. from Northeastern University.


Commercial Property: Auctions; An Old Way of Selling Takes on New Respectability
ON Sept. 20, people from all over the world will gather at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and bid on commercial properties scattered across New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
They will get a chance to buy a couple of warehouses, an office complex, an apartment complex, a research building, even a department store on Brooklyn's Fulton Mall.
Some of the properties are for sale, others have potential for lease takeovers.
They have just one thing in common: Their owners, the International Business Machines Corporation and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, think they have a better chance to get a decent price for those properties at auction than through a conventional sale.
"An auction brings all the buyers together in one room and that gives you a definite read on the market," said John Gorham, vice president of equity investments for the Prudential Realty Group.


Anica Alvarez, Yoshi Nishio
Edna R. S. Alvarez and Rodolfo Alvarez, both of Los Angeles, have announced the engagement of their daughter Anica Alvarez to Yoshi Nishio, the son of Keiko Nishio and Hiromichi Kubou, both of Toyko.

Miss Alvarez, a graduate of Yale University, is the director of development for Martha Coolidge Productions, a feature film production company in Los Angeles.
Her father is a professor of sociology at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Her mother is a lawyer in private practice in Los Angeles.


Karen P. Fullam, Timothy Brennan
Mr. and Mrs.
Eugene J. Fullam of Lattingtown, L.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter Karen Patricia Fullam to Timothy Runyon Brennan, a son of Mrs.
James A. Brennan of Westbury, L.I., and the late Mr.
Brennan.
A November wedding is planned.
Miss Fullam is the advertising director for Maurice Villency Inc., a furniture retailer in New York.
She graduated from Boston University.

Charles J. O'Shea of Point Lookout, L.I., have announced December wedding plans for their daughter Aileen Therese O'Shea and Dr.
Mark Berger Anderson, the son of the Rev.
Dr.
Herbert B. Anderson and Mary Lou Anderson of New York.
Miss O'Shea, a graduate of Northwestern University, was until recently a sales representative at Crossroads Films in New York, a production company for television commercials.
Her father owns the funeral homes bearing his name in East Meadow and Wantagh, L.I.
Her mother, Eugenia O'Shea, is a member of the Zoning Appeals Board of the Town of Hempstead, L.I.


Mutual Funds; Hunting in the Dual-Purpose Patch
DUAL-PURPOSE funds, one of the most esoteric and misunderstood types of closed-end funds, will be winding up in just over three years, so investors who want one last crack at them must move quickly.
Are there bargains in the group?
It depends on whom you ask.
Analysts' sentiments range from the wildly bullish to bearish.


A Familiar Custody Case, a Different Decision
In what is described by all sides as a creative solution to a difficult problem, an adoptive mother and a biological father will share legal custody of a 9-month-old boy.
After two days of hearings in Addison County Probate Court here, the settlement announced last week gave the adoptive mother, Donna McDurfee, physical custody of the child she has reared since birth.
But she will share legal custody with Daniel Harriman, the father, who is assured of visitation rights and a say in his son's upbringing.


All Hail!
At the American Museum of Natural History, a reception (free and open to the public) for the King of the Akyem in Ghana, Aug. 21.


Connecticut Coppers At Auction
COINS of small denomination -- pennies and halfpennies -- were scarce after the Revolutionary War, so American merchants were hard pressed to make change for their customers.
To ease the problem, Spanish silver dollars were cut into eight pieces, and these "pieces of eight" functioned as coins.
But they could never be used as pennies or threepence because the smallest denomination was, of course, 12 1/2 cents.
Several of the former colonies began producing small-denomination tokens instead of legal tender coins.
In 1785, Connecticut contracted for the minting of its own copper tokens.


Susan Galbraith, Jeffrey Weinstein
Mr. and Mrs.
Robert H. Galbraith of Centerville, Ohio, have announced October wedding plans for their daughter Dr.
Susan Colleen Galbraith and Dr.
Jeffrey William Weinstein, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Joel D. Weinstein of Englewood, N.J.
Dr.
Galbraith, 32, and her fiance, 29, are research fellows at Yale-New Haven Medical Center, she in endocrinology and he in infectious diseases.
She graduated from Graceland College and received an M.D. from Ohio State University.
Her father is the director of business development in Dayton, Ohio, at the Delco Chassis division of the General Motors Corporation.


UNCLE MILTY'S LOST KIDS
After 10 years of house chores, schooling and barn work, I graduated (1983) from Milton Hershey School.
I found Mark Cohen's article "Uncle Milty's Lost Kids" (Aug. 1) to be accurate and inspiring.
My mother committed suicide when I was 8 months old.
My father was a gambler and never had enough money to feed my two older brothers and myself.
If it wasn't for Milton Hershey, I'm sure I'd be on the streets, in jail or dead.


On the Road


Egypt's Civilian Court Acted With Justice
To the Editor:
"Egyptian Court Clears 24 Fundamentalists of Murder" (news article, Aug. 15), on the 1990 murder of Rifaat al-Mahjoub, Speaker of the Parliament, twice alleges that Egyptian civilian courts are not competent to deal with cases involving Islamic extremists.
First you report that "some Egyptian newspapers" say that civilian courts are reluctant to punish extremists because the judiciary has been intimidated.
Then you state that the court system is "subject to manipulation by lawyers and judges with fundamentalist sympathies."
Nothing substantiates these grave charges.
The State Security Court acted properly in this case in refusing to admit as evidence confessions it deemed to have been obtained through torture during interrogation.


In Cold Spring, Unsettling Images by a Dispassionate Observer
IN one picture, a fat man with pants fit to burst is losing himself -- and perhaps his money, too -- in a prizefight; in an other image, a man, institutionalized, proposes a lonely toast with a plastic foam cup.
Two people unlikely to meet in real life have come together in a show of photographs by Toby Old, at the John Froats Gallery, here.
Mr.
Old, who has been on the scene since the late 1970's but mostly in group shows staged by museums and galleries in New York City, fills this large space with his black-and-white observations of life.
He deals with sporting events or their audiences or, in the case of the panorama of Madison Square Garden, packed and ready to go for the 1984 Marvin Hagler-Mustafa Hamsho fight, both.
The center of attention in this image is the ring all but dissolved into the harsh lighting; the action is on the perimeter in the gesturing silhouettes of excited onlookers.

When, Catholics Ask, Is One Out of the Fold?
IN 1974, Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz saw Pope Paul VI break off in the middle of a speech to plead with a French youth group in the front of the crowd.
"He begged them, 'Don't leave the church, don't leave the church,' said Ms. Isasi-Diaz, a Catholic theologian in New York. "I was standing quite near and I could see that he was actually weeping.
And I have always gone back to that as an all-encompassing cry: Don't leave."

Books From The Times
QUOTH THE MAVEN, by William Safire. (Random House, $25.) What are we going to call the decade after the 90's?
Where did George Bush learn to say "like ugly on an ape"?
How should people pronounce the abbreviations "v.," "vs.," and "viz."?
These and many other urgent issues of language are captured, dissected and anatomized in "Quoth the Maven," the eighth collection of material from William Safire's weekly column, On Language, in The New York Times Magazine, augmented, corrected or denounced in correspondence from alert readers and occasional collaborators, the Lexicographic Irregulars, the Gotcha!
Gang and the Squad Squad.


Kendall L. Losee, C. E. Graebner Jr.
Kendall Louise Losee, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas P. Losee Jr. of Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., was married yesterday to Clark Edward Graebner Jr., the son of Carole C. Graebner of New York and Mr.
Graebner of Southport, Conn.
The Very Rev.
Robert V. Wilshire officiated at the Episcopal Cathedral of the Incarnation in Garden City, L.I.
Mrs.
Graebner, 25, was until recently a sales representative at a Polo/Ralph Lauren store in Washington.
She graduated from Mount Vernon College.
Her father is the publisher of Architectural Digest in New York.


Football at Monmouth College: It's a Whole New Ball Game
THE first game is not until Sept. 11, but the advent of intercollegiate football at 60-year-old Monmouth College has already gripped this picturesque 125-acre campus with an excitement seldom felt since the protest days of the 1960's or since the filming of "Annie" here in the early 1980's.
Since Aug. 15, 87 members of the Hawks, as the new team is known, have been hard at work in the shadow of a $250,000 stadium under construction.
Their first opponent ever will be Stonehill College in North Easton, Mass.
Four home games and two other away games will follow.


World Markets; The Tokyo Exchange as a Free Market?
FOR years now, foreign and Japanese market analysts have invented reasons in explaining why share prices and most measures of share value in Japan should be many times higher than comparable measures in the West.
Some said it was the tax structure, or the accounting system.
Others argued it was a sort of unique cultural chromosome deep in the Japanese psyche.
Shoichi Royama has looked at this question on behalf of the Finance Ministry, and he has another conclusion: the stock market here is not really a market.


Cleaning Up College Football
The college football season is starting with a familiar flurry of resignations and probations.
At the University of Washington, Don James resigned as head coach after failing to notice that his quarterback owned three cars.
Of course, the athletic staff was not part of the money-lending scheme that ensnared the player and brought down the coach.
It was one of those pesky "boosters" who always seem handy when blame is assigned.


As Easterners Try to Save West, Westerners Blanch
The West is crowded with vacationing Easterners this time of year, including a small posse of senators on horseback, members of Congress wading through trout streams and earnest young political aides sampling clean air and ungarnished food.
But when Eastern politicians take their holidays to the wide open spaces, many Western politicians tend to get nervous.
To hear some senators from the West tell it, a visiting representative from an eastern state is held in about the same regard as a missionary by a defiant pagan.
Lifting the Drawbridge
"They come to see the intrinsic beauty of Montana, but then they go home and want to save it all in perpetuity," said Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana.


30-Year-Old Echoes From Slaying of 2
On the pleasant morning of Aug. 28, 1963, a cat burglar sprang through an open kitchen window into a third-floor apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.
What began as a burglary erupted into a double murder, a vast manhunt, the imprisonment of an innocent man, and, ultimately, the conviction of the admitted killer.
That same August day, 30 years ago, the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech at a mammoth civil rights rally in Washington -- an event that was pivotal in establishing the innocence of the black youth falsely accused of killing two young women, Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert.


In the Heat of Men's Qualifying, an Upset Is Served
In the sweltering heat at the National Tennis Center yesterday, neither player could break the other's serve.
Both looked exhausted, dehydrated, exasperated.
But because a spot in the main draw of the United States Open was at stake, neither would budge.
Patrick Rafter, an Australian seeded No. 1 in qualifying, was playing some of the best tennis in his life coming into the Open.
He beat Pete Sampras two weeks ago in Indianapolis, and his ranking had risen to No. 84 in the world.
This week's qualifying tournament in Flushing Meadows was supposed to be just a tuneup.


That Letter
To the Editor:
The New York Times Book Review has really gone over the edge this time.
I am sure that in your editorial mind, you justify the publication of Kirk S. Nevin's hallucinatory letter (Aug. 1) by convincing yourself that readers would discredit his Holocaust denial because he also denies the truth of the "moon landings." But just as two wrongs do not make a right, two falsehoods do not justify your providing important and limited space to an anti-Semitic and anti-astronaut kook.
A decision by The Times to publish a letter carries with it some degree of responsibility.
A letters page is not like the speakers' stand in Hyde Park, since you reject most of the letters submitted to you.
Unfortunately, some of your readers will never get to the last paragraph of the letter, and a few may even believe it because it has the imprimatur of a great newspaper.
ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ  Cambridge, Mass.


A New Generation Triumphs at Biel
THE Internation al Chess Federation's Interzonal Tournament, which finished in Biel, Switzerland, in early August, was a triumph for the younger grandmasters.
Of those who took the top 10 places and thus qualified for the world-championship-candidates matches in Wijk-aan-Zee, the Netherlands, in January, not one was over 37 and their average age was 25.3 years.
Players with such long and illustrious careers as Lajos Portisch of Hungary and Viktor Korchnoi were shut out.


Brick Sidewalks And the Test of Time
I was pleased to see the Aug. 1 article "Preservation Battle Over a Firehouse." While the Ridgewood Firehouse issue has many pros and cons, may I take a moment to refer to another aspect of Ridgewood that most people would probably feel is a positive step in the revitalization of downtown Ridgewood: new sidewalks.
The use of a red brick border motif gives a unique character to an otherwise prosaic project -- mundane sidewalks.
While the laying of a concrete sidewalk exhibits a high level of industrial art, the proper placement of red bricks reflects pure artistry.


U.S. Should Resume Medicare Operation; Healing Itself?
To the Editor:
Re "Health Care Is Healing Itself" (Op-Ed, Aug. 17):
Two weeks ago I had a cataract removed and a new lens placed in the eye.
I was at the hospital for two hours, the first devoted to filling out forms and having an electrocardiogram.
Then drops were put in the eye.
Then came the operation, followed by "recovery," which included a sandwich and a cup of coffee.


'Tommy' Is Human, and Don't You Forget It
To the Editor:


Gang Leader Is Arrested In Hong Kong
In what Federal officials described as a major strike against Asian organized crime, the authorities in Hong Kong have arrested the reputed leader of a gang in New York's Chinatown who has been a linchpin in the smuggling of illegal Chinese immigrants into the United States, law-enforcement authorities said last night.
The suspect, Guo Liang Chi, was arrested in Hong Kong on Friday, the officials said.
He is believed to have been involved in organizing the voyage of the Golden Venture, which drew international attention to the problem of alien smuggling when it ran aground off the Rockaway Peninsula in June.
Ten people died, most trying to swim to shore.
Yesterday, Federal authorities struck at 7 locations in New York City and arrested 13 of his associates, including several who were in the midst of attending a burial ceremony at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, the officials said.


Democracy on Your Dial
Frank Gannon and Laurie Sykes, who book guests for "Politically Incorrect," a panel discussion show on the Comedy Central channel, take a wild-card approach to their job.
The show, with Bill Maher, a comedian, as host, is on Sundays at 9:30 A.M. and 8 P.M.
As in the offices of most talk shows, Mr.
Gannon and Mrs.
Sykes have a bulletin board covered with notecards with names of possible guests.
Their goal is to make the four-person panel as wildly divergent as possible.
They mix and match people -- like Roseanne Arnold, Richard Viguerie, Doctor Dre and Ted Nugent -- until they find the right imbalance.


Paris, Haute &amp; Mighty
The fall '93 couture will probably go down as the one that brought back high hemlines.
But there was more.
Ungaro's exquisite oeuvre was proof that couture exists not only to exhibit the occasional derring-do, but also to display superb talent, craftsmanship and ravishing fabrications.


East Europe Curbs Eased
Travelers who want to drive a rental car from western Europe into eastern Europe still face stringent requirements, but restrictions are being eased a bit.
Avis Europe has announced it is now allowing clients who rent cars in Austria to drive into the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia.
Renters may still not take the car into the former Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Croatia or any other parts of the former Yugoslavia except Slovenia.


Other Practices That Need Reform
The practice of senatorial courtesy, whereby a state senator acting alone can block an appointment, seems to have become the primary focus for governmental reform in New Jersey ("A Senate Tradition Faces Wide Attack," July 18).
Governor Florio, former Governor Kean, Speaker Haytaian and Chief Justice Wilentz have all condemned the practice of senatorial courtesy.
While this practice is probably in need of reform, surely there are more pressing issues calling for such united support for good government changes.


Hooping It Up for a Good Cause


When 'Hold That Line' Is Taken to the Extreme
With a thermometer on the wall of Giants Stadium registering 117 degrees, Derrick Brooks suddenly found himself defending his goal line midway through the second period of the Kickoff Classic today.
Brooks, the linebacker and catalyst of the Florida State defense, dug in at the Seminoles' 2-yard line, a place the Kansas Jayhawks had quickly, and unexpectedly, reached with the score 14-0 against them.
A game that everyone expected to be a rout -- and one which eventually became just that -- had just taken on a different look.


Problems Are Harder Now, House Speaker Says
The Congressman comes to reassure.
Most people's income taxes did not go up.
The health care proposal will be carefully studied and employers will not be crippled.
Old forests can be protected without destroying the lumber industry.
But as Thomas S. Foley, the single most important member of the House of Representatives, travels Washington's Fifth Congressional District, he also conveys a sense of personal discontent, a sense that the problems of the 90's are harder and more complicated than those of the 60's when he came to Congress, and that the tone of politics is nastier, more simplistic, more extreme.


For Mets, All Signs Still Point To Failure
It hasn't been a banner year at Shea Stadium, but it will be a Banner Day this afternoon when the annual sign parade takes place before the game with Colorado.
What messages might the home fans have for the worst team in baseball?
Following Colorado's 7-5 victory over the Mets last night, perhaps a sign might say: "Watch Out, Rockies. We're Still Only 3 1/2 Games Behind You in the Race for 27th Place."


What's With You, Too?
To the Editor:
I enjoyed the article "What's With U?" (Aug. 22).


Letter: On Gun Control; Seat Belts, Bullets and American Lives
To the Editor:
In a letter you published in 1960, I wrote to say that epidemiologists were trying to redefine automobile safety as a public health problem with greater attention to "passive" measures such as vehicle design.
Such views were then generally greeted with skepticism, if not derision, since conventional thinking then saw the problem as driver behavior and the solution as law enforcement.
Yet by 1966 Congress had enacted legislation establishing the National Highway Safety Bureau, headed first by William Haddon Jr., M.D., who had begun his career in the New York State Department of Health.
Automobile safety is now a recognized field of scientific research and technological innovation with results to show for it.


New Mexico's Mecca for Peppers
AS a transplanted native of Arizona, I have never indulged in food fantasies of unlimited foie gras or caviar.
My notion of nirvana has more to do with chilies -- for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and maybe a few snacks in between.
Unfortunately, I live with a Buffalo boy raised on pirogi and chicken wings, and there is no way we are ever going to start the day at home with huevos rancheros and end it with enchiladas.
But for one brief shining sojourn in Hatch, N.M., last fall, our choices were reduced to green chili or red at every meal.


JAPAN'S COMPANIES MOVING PRODUCTION TO SITES OVERSEAS
Sanritsu Electric, a small electronics company, got the bad news earlier this month.
Its largest customer, Sanyo Electric, canceled orders for portable cassette players.
"We were told by Sanyo that they cannot make a profit on products manufactured in Japan," said Hiroyuki Nakamura, the head of the Sanritsu factory in Tokushima.
Sanyo is expected to procure the portable tape players in Southeast Asia, where labor costs are lower.
And Sanritsu will close its factory, putting 168 people out of work.

Trimmer and Seasoned, Pork Makes a Comeback
PORK has been out of fashion in recent years.
But when I was growing up, we probably ate it once a week.
A favorite method of preparation was to bake a pork chop in the undiluted contents of a can of Campbell's mushroom soup.
A cinch, every time.
But, as people began to discover other meats such as lamb and venison, pork gradually fell into disfavor.
You didn't see it on many restaurant menus anymore, unless barbecue was being served.


On the Rhine
To the Editor: Craig R. Whitney's "On the Rhine, Commerce and Romance" (Aug. 1) gave us the opportunity to relive our Christmas cruise on the Koln-Dusseldorfer Line's Deutschland.
In 1990, we spent a week sailing from Cologne to Strasbourg and back -- one of our most memorable travel experiences.
We have both lived and worked in Europe and were delighted to discover that, with fellow passengers representing 12 countries, this was a European's experience of the Rhine, not a canned, sanitized American group tour.
The staff regarded us as international travelers, not as American tourists.
The author's reference to the 9-year-old boy as the only one to brave the small heated swimming pool on the top deck brought to mind a Christmas morning swim with a couple from England, who were our tablemates.
On Christmas Eve, we arranged to have our dining steward deliver a bottle of Champagne and four glasses to poolside promptly at 9 A.M.
The following morning, clad only in swimwear, we raced up the steps to the pool, braving the 20-something-degree outside temperature and a light frozen mist.
The 85-degree pool water temperature made the mad dash worth the effort.
Moments later, the steward arrived with the Champagne, which he served with European flair.


U.S. Peacekeeping Policy Debate Angers Russians
When President Clinton returns to Washington on Sunday from his vacation, he is expected to approve a Presidential directive that would set out the United States' policy toward peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union, beset by ethnic and nationalist strife.
But this attempt by the United States to clarify its role in keeping the peace in the post-cold-war world has had unintended consequences, prompting an angry reaction among Russians opposed to President Boris N. Yeltsin.

Once More Unto la Difference
To the Editor:
Your article suggests a chasm of understanding even deeper than that between the genders -- the one between practicing managers and the academics who write about them.
The intricacies of the debate over research methodologies on this topic must seem irrelevant, if not surrealistic, to practitioners of both genders struggling to perform effectively in today's increasingly diverse workplace.

Streetscapes: Central Park's 'Hooverville'; Life Along 'Depression Street'
PERHAPS the character of shantytowns, and the homeless who occupy them, change little over generations.
But the episode of the encampment at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge, demolished by the city on Aug. 17, recalls the "Hooverville" of shacks housing more than a score of homeless people in the emptied Central Park Reservoir in 1931-1933.
The stock-market crash of October 1929 occurred just as the large rectangular reservoir in Central Park north of Belvedere Castle was being taken out of service.
In early 1930, the reservoir was drained, preparatory to its transformation into what is now known as the Great Lawn.
But a slowdown in construction and excavation made clean fill scarce.

Viewpoints; If Cultures Don't Fit, Mergers May Fail
AFTER rising to great heights during most of the 1980's and then declining after 1988, mergers and acquisitions have picked up again.
And it's not just the A.T.&amp;T.-McCaw megadeal, either.
As of mid-June, the number of these combinations was running about 30 percent higher this year than last.
It's not hard to imagine the appeal of these combinations for business leaders.
They hope for more market power, greater profits and more organizational synergy.
But they are often disappointed because, despite the great promise, most mergers and acquisitions fail to meet expectations.
A 1988 study by McKinsey &amp; Company, for instance, found that most companies would have profited more by banking their money instead of buying another company.
Many other studies, here and abroad, have reached similar conclusions.


A Viewer's Guide to Open-Vision
THE WAY WE WERE (ZEN AND NOW) -- The public flirtation between Barbra Streisand and Andre Agassi caught fire a year ago at the Open, when we learned that the Funny Girl admired the Zennish side in Agassi that none of us knew existed.
Watch for CBS and USA Network's cuts to adoring, New Age looks between the odd duo.
Stay tuned also for Jim Nantz's infomercial on Zen and the Art of Body Hair Shaving, preceding the first Saturday of action.
THE BORE-O-METER -- Electronic gimmickry has brought tennis closer to the viewer, and CBS will reportedly unveil an innovative gadget to gauge the boredom of the Stadium Court crowd by how loud their snores get during matches between big hitters like Pete Sampras and Jim Courier as they whack the balls at supersonic speeds from the baselines.
The bottom right corner of the screen will show the CBS Bore-O-Meter's needle rising.
When the hyperkinetic CBS analyst Mary Carillo falls asleep, the Bore-O-Meter sets off a piercing alarm that trips a hypnotic suggestion instantly compelling the players to rush the net, whether they need to or not.


Rays of Hope for North Fork Women
"WHEN you live out here on the North Fork, it's not so easy to get places, and for many women it can be very lonely," a mother of four from Greenport, Barbara Heaney, said.
"If you're lucky enough to find a place with support services, it's never down the road, but always a few towns away."
Last year, when Ms.
Heaney learned that she was pregnant with her fourth child months after she had a miscarriage, she did not know where to turn, she said.


Defense Lawyers Question Informer's Part in Bomb Plot
Nearly two years after he infiltrated the circle of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, an enigmatic Federal informer and the tactics he used in making taped conversations with Mr.
Abdel Rahman and others are emerging as a growing issue in the sweeping terrorist case surrounding the militant Egyptian cleric.
The informer, Emad Salem, a former Egyptian Army officer who became a close aide to Mr.
Abdel Rahman, is a central figure in two sets of audio tapes likely to play an important role in the prosecution of the terrorist bombing and murder cases.


English as a Precious Language
Riverside Church was packed with immigrants hoping their number was up.
Hairdressers, plumbers and mathematicians from Russia, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, they formed lines that snaked through a cavernous assembly hall, 500 people desperate for the luck of the draw.
A lottery had drawn them to this spot beneath stained-glass windows, but it was no ordinary cash-prize game.
This was a lottery to win one of 50 coveted spaces in the free intensive English classes offered at the Manhattan church.

Why Chide Clinton or the Vineyard for His Vacationing There?
To the Editor:
"Clinton Among the Swells" (editorial, Aug. 22) is an unfortunate misrepresentation of Martha's Vineyard, as well as a mindless and snide attack on President Clinton.
The Vineyard is not only celebrities.
The real island population consists of fishers, farmers, tradespeople and professionals, with large numbers of seasonal visitors, who come to enjoy its natural beauty and solitude.
The character of the Vineyard can be measured by a glance at the twice-weekly Vineyard Gazette, which emphasizes the environment, human interest stories of ordinary local folks, outstanding photography and local business and political news.
Celebrities appear in print on occasions when they have volunteered themselves for a local cause.


All Choked Up
Will choking, that involuntary art of performing a demolition derby on one's domination of a match, continue to be the scourge of the women's tour when the United States Open gets under way tomorrow?
Probably.
After all, every player, male or female, is susceptible to the biochemical event that occurs in the hormones when pressure produces fear.
The difference is, some players are better than their peers at being able to stifle fear, usually by replacing it with aggression or, in rarer Connorsesque cases, with humor.
And it's usually the stiflers who find a way to be winners.


When Mystic Meets Mystic
That ostensibly reclusive maestro Sergiu Celibidache says audio recordings distort the spontaneity of the music-making moment, and he has forsworn them for decades.
Video documentation on laser disk does not seem to trouble him, however, even though one can turn off the image and listen to the sound.
On the other hand, a purchaser needs access to a laser-disk player, and that limitation of the potential audience may tickle the conductor's sense of elitism.
In any case, the release of video disks by Mr.
Celibidache (pronounced chell-ee-bee-DAH-kay) continues.
The latest are the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Symphonies of Anton Bruckner (SLV 48348, SLV 48316 and S2LV 48317; the Eighth fills three sides of two disks).
Mr.
Celibidache's Munich Philharmonic plays all three performances, which were recorded in concert.
The Sixth was taped at the Gasteig in Munich in 1991, the Seventh and Eighth at Suntory Hall in Tokyo a year earlier.


Colleges That Don't Make Grade
It is almost time for the dinosaurs to come back from their vacation.
They have had a busy summer, defending college football from the forces that could cause its demise.
We know that the failure to extend the season into mid-January, to construct a national championship playoff, will destroy any chance for an exciting ending and prevent universities from making the zillions that will go directly back to pay for those shiny new supercomputers they really need.


Beirut Reborn/A special report.; Stirring From Nightmare of War, Lebanon Renews Its Zest for Life
A man with a wasted look steps into Joseph Chaker's downtown pharmacy, clutching a worn-out prescription in a trembling hand.
He leans on a cane, a trace of saliva running down his chin as the pharmacist observes him with a mixture of compassion and disgust before leading him gently out the door.
"He's another drug addict who can't afford the drug," Mr.
Chaker says.
There are thousands like him, victims of 15 years of civil war that left social miseries like fractured families and increased drug addiction in the poverty and rubble of Beirut.
Seizing the Initiative
About half a mile away, in the trendy Ramlet al Beida neighborhood overlooking the Mediterranean coast, Najib A. Mikati, president of Investcom Holding, speaks in his air-conditioned office of the bright idea he had during the darkest period of the war: cellular phones.


Removing Barriers for the Handicapped
IT is a temptation that snares many otherwise upstanding citizens.
The shopping center parking lot is full and that errand won't take more than five minutes, so what harm can it do to park in a spot reserved for the disabled?
That attitude prevailed for years around the county.
Although it was illegal for nondisabled drivers to use such spots, few police departments enforced the sanctions that existed.
No longer.
Many communities are now following the aggressive lead of Greenburgh, which began an active campaign in June to enforce disabled-parking regulations.
For all of 1992 the Greenburgh Police Department issued 195 handicapped parking violations; as of July 1, 1993, it had already issued 300.


Renaissance Footwear
To the Editor:

Dwight Harken, 83, the Pioneer of Surgery on the Heart, Is Dead
Dwight E. Harken, the father of heart surgery and the creator of intensive care units for critically ill patients, died on Friday at a hospital in Cambridge, Mass.
He was 83 and lived in Cambridge.
The cause was pneumonia, his family said.


Giants Playing Eggshell Game
There are going to be times this season when the Giants have their fingers and toes crossed while quarterback Phil Simms is on the field.
Everyone assumes that if Simms goes down with an injury, the season could come crashing down around them.
The team got one of those scares tonight in their final exhibition game against the Miami Dolphins.
It was a minor scare, but when it comes to Simms, even small ones can be frightening.
Facing a second-and-30 at their 36-yard line in the second quarter, Dolphins defensive end Marco Coleman crashed the left side of the line, beating a slightly rusty Jumbo Elliott, who was playing in his first game of the preseason.
Coleman, all 6-foot-3-inches and 260 pounds of him, crushed Simms for a 15-yard sack, the quarterback's head hitting the turf hard.


Will Stamford Attract A Yankees Farm Team?
THOUGH its most popular summer game nowadays is slow-pitch softball, Stamford has always been a good baseball town.
Its Little League and Babe Ruth League programs have produced world and national champions, respectively, and it lays claim to having the oldest continuous Twilight baseball league in the state.
And in the 1940's there were four men's hardball leagues in the city, including a strong industrial league, along with a Class B minor league team in 1947 and 1948.
With the strong baseball tradition in mind, coupled with its location and numerous corporate headquarters, a group that includes the city's Commissioner of Public Works is trying to determine whether the Albany Yankees of the Double A Eastern League might be interested in moving to Stamford.

Wall Street; Arbitragers Are on the Rise -- Again
BELL bottoms and platform shoes are back, so why not arbitragers?
Wall Street's takeover speculators began to go the way of the leisure suit when stocks crashed in 1987, knocking a first round of arbs out of the business.
The round two knockout came in 1989, when UAL lost its financing for a leveraged buyout, taking other merger stocks -- and the arbs -- down with it.
Now, though, there's a glimmer in the eyes of the battered survivors of arbitrage -- those who haven't filed for bankruptcy or gone to jail.


Growing Metaphors
IF you ask inhabitants of Provincetown, Mass., about local celebrities, they'll tell you, first off, about Norman Mailer, who is rarely seen on the front lawn of his waterfront brick house at the eastern end of Commercial Street, the town's main drag.
After that, they'll tell you, often with great fondness, about the 88-year-old poet Stanley Kunitz, the Pulitzer Prize winner, who has been working the little terraced garden in front of his modest house at the western end of Commercial Street for more than 30 years.
Last Monday evening, Mr.
Kunitz, who is a founder of the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center and of Poets House in Manhattan, where he also lives, was looking out his front window.
"My garden is more famous in Provincetown than I am," he said.
"One of the great satisfactions of the garden is that you're the priest and attendant through this annual ritual of birth and departure."

AUGUST 22-28: Echoes of a Bush Plan; Clinton's Wetlands Package Tries to Find High Ground
In an attempt to end years of squabbling between conservationists and property owners over Federal regulation of wetlands, the Clinton Administration last week proposed a new package of protections for the delicate and diminishing ecosystems.
The plan would affect all of the country's wetland areas -- 170 million acres in Alaska and 100 million acres in the lower 48 states.
The White House hoped to win broad acceptance by offering sweeteners to interest groups.
For environmentalists, the plan would abandon the Bush Administration's proposal to permit development in 1.7 million acres of Alaska wetlands, placing all such land under Federal regulation.
For farmers, the plan would exempt from Federal regulation 53 million acres of wetlands drained for cultivation prior to 1985.
For developers, the plan proposed streamlining procedures used to appeal denials of construction permits.

Given that baseball is well on its way to mediocrity in its emphasis on financial rather than field statistics, Pat Jordan's article on Turk Wendell was a refreshing reminder of why the game has held our attention for decades ("What Makes Turk Tick?" Aug. 8).

Q and A
Mortgage Brokers Question: I am having difficulty refinancing the mortgage on my co-op.
I am considering using a mortgage broker and would like to know how to locate and select one, specifically what services a broker provides, what the fees are and when they are paid and by whom. . . .
Herb Simon, Manhattan Answer: According to Margaret Scott, a mortgage broker with the Manhattan Mortgage Company, the best way to find a broker is from a referral from friends, real estate agents, accountants or lawyers.
The next best way is through the Yellow Pages or newspaper ads.
She added, though, that you should be wary of advertised rates, because so many variables exist that could alter how much you will pay.
"Beware of the points you might have to pay with low rates," she said.
Also, Ms.
Scott said, check to see if the broker is a member of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and your state's association.

To the Editor:
In what must rank as one of the most unedifying, unintelligible (or unintelligent?) runs of words ever set to print, Michael Lewis informs us that Lewis H. Lapham, in "The Wish for Kings: Democracy at Bay" (Aug. 1), writes sentences (every one, in fact) that are 33.33 percent too long, and "arched"; that the clash of style and content in Mr.
Lapham's prose produces frisson, like "Jeremiah as played by David Niven in black tie"; that Mr.
Lap ham "co-opts his readers . . . by encouraging them to feel superior"; that Mr.
Lapham is a defensive, socially ambitious snob -- a "journalist who casts himself as an upper-class observer"; and that, by the way, Washington is less pretentious than New York and Los Angeles.

Profile: Jan Thompson; Mazda's Hard-Driving Saleswoman
JAN THOMPSON created quite a stir on her first day of work at the Chrysler Corporation 20 years ago.
She was the first female management trainee at the big auto maker's field services division, and the workers there almost tripped over each other to get the lowdown on her.
"I'll never forget that first day," she said.
"People were staring at me, car dealers were calling, the regional managers were stopping by the office, all wanting to know what it was going to be like having a woman out in the field. At the time, I was oblivious to the whole thing. It was just a job to me."

Rotation Trembles as Key Loses
There is no question that Jimmy Key has proved to be the quintessential stopper among the Yankees' starters this season.
Only three times in 11 attempts has he failed to follow a Yankee loss with a victory, No. 3 occurring yesterday when Key was boxed around by the Cleveland Indians in an 8-4 defeat.
The loss, magnified because the Yankees are in a pennant race, also emphasized again how important Key is -- and what it means to the cut-and-paste rotation if the left-hander loses.
For a Jimmy Key loss casts a cloud over the Yankees for an entire swing through the rotation, so shaky and uncertain has the rest of the Yankee starting corps become.


Lisa M. Marks, Tonio M. Scali
Lisa Marie Marks, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The bride, who will retain her name, graduated from Smith College and is an art dealer in New York specializing in contemporary art.
Her father, a lawyer, is a private investor in Manhattan.
Her mother, Emily M. Marks, is the executive director of United Neighborhood Houses of New York, the umbrella group for the city's settlement houses.


Producing Heroines On Demand
Few lives have been better connected musically, from start to finish, than that of the singing teacher Mathilde Marchesi, nee Graumann.
She was born into a well-to-do Frankfurt mercantile family in 1821.
One of her paternal aunts was the pianist Dorothea von Ertmann, an intimate of Beethoven (thought by some to have been his enigmatic "immortal beloved"), who for a time taught the young singer a Beethoven sonata every day, "as my great master wanted it done." Mendelssohn and Liszt, Otto Nicolai and Pauline Viardot took an early interest in Graumann's singing, and some of them also became friends.
She married an Italian baritone (of good birth, she carefully points out in her memoirs), Salvatore Marchesi de Castrone, and had some successes as a singer, mainly in concert.
But she quickly found her true calling: her principal teacher, the great Manuel Garcia Jr., was so impressed with Fraulein Graumann's understanding and industry that he confided beginning pupils to her and let her substitute for him when he was ill.
By the end of the century, after holding posts in Vienna and Cologne, she was celebrated, honored and just a tad feared in Paris as the great Mme.
Marchesi.


Back to the Round Table With Dorothy Parker and Pals. . .
It's not hard to imagine how Dorothy Parker would have responded to the current fuss surrounding her 100th birthday.
Most likely, she would have greeted each new tribute -- the centennial stamp bearing her waifish likeness, a proclamation by the City of New York dedicating the day (Aug. 22) in her honor, a Dorothy Parker Weekend Package at the Algonquin Hotel -- with a whisky-soaked "What fresh hell is this?"
Privately, of course, she would have relished these developments, because Dorothy Parker loved attention.
So, too, did about 20 of her closest friends, including the theater critics Robert Benchley and Alexander Woollcott, the playwright Robert Sherwood, the columnist Franklin P. Adams and the novelist Edna Ferber.
For the better part of the 1920's, they lunched together at the Rose Room of the Algonquin Hotel on West 44th Street in Manhattan, nursing one another's hangovers and matching witticisms.
These "board meetings," as the members called them, came to be known as the Algonquin Round Table.


U.S. Appeals a Case Defying Sentence Guides
The Justice Department has appealed a Federal district judge's ruling that the guidelines for mandatory minimum sentences in crack drug cases disproportionately affect blacks.
The judge, Lyle E. Strom of Omaha, ruled on July 27 that blacks convicted in crack cases "are being treated unfairly in receiving substantially longer sentences than Caucasian males who traditionally deal in powder cocaine."

Keeping In Step With the 50's
Matching shoes and handbags were a fetish of the 1950's -- a nonnegotiable fashion rule for women.
But the existence of snazzy combinations like this one made it easier to toe the line.


Good Deeds, Too
To the Sports Editor:
I continually find reports of misbehavior by athletes in The Times.
These items are invariably accompanied by discussions of whether athletes should even be held to higher standards as role models.
I do not begin to defend the misdeeds of overpaid, immature, pampered, yet still worshipped, athletes.
But I care even less for journalists who devote pages to these stories and pompously take the moral high ground by decrying the fall of their heroes, but then show little concern when an athlete goes above and beyond the standards of a true role model.
I refer to the part played by Miami Dolphins linebacker John Offerdahl in the rescue of an elderly couple whose car was knocked into a pond.
Despite these true heroics, your paper chose to allot only eight sentences to this story, taken directly from The Associated Press wire.


FIGHT SLEEPISM. NAP NOW!
There are not many rules for napping, but there are a few: You cannot nap in bed.
That's sleeping.
One should only nap on couches, in chairs, on benches, etc.
You must remain fully clothed.
The idea is to be spontaneous.
Finally, if you need something to keep you warm, you cannot use a blanket or even an afghan: you must use a newspaper.

The Geography of AIDS
To the Editor:
Erik Eckholm can call me whatever he likes in reviewing my book "The Slow Plague: A Geography of the AIDS Pandemic" (July 18), but he should be careful with his accusations.
"Kenya . . . is certainly well down the list" of AIDS cases, he says scornfully, deploring the exaggeration of my "unlikely assertion." Granted the difficulty of computing rates in Africa, where many countries have not had a reliable census for decades, what I wrote was that "even by official figures" reported to the World Health Organization, "Kenya has the third highest rate in Africa, and that means in the world (excluding three or four Caribbean islands)."


Heather Furlong, James H. Kirby
November wedding plans have been announced by Mrs.
John F. Arndt Jr. of Gladwyne, Pa., and Stewart S. Furlong of Sellersville, Pa., for their daughter Heather Vaughn Furlong and James Harrington Kirby, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Miss Furlong, 25, is a cum laude graduate of Georgetown University.
She is an investment associate at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Company, a private bank in New York.

Her mother, now retired, was a manager at the Opera Company of Philadelphia.


A la Carte; Presenting a New Gimmick for the Promotional Minded
FORGET those free dinner mints.
The Cold Spring Harbor Cafe, 134 Main Street (367-6060), is celebrating its first anniversary with an unusual promotion, free massages.
Restaurants are always trying to capture the public's interest and imagination, and they intensify their efforts at anniversary times.
Promotions run the gamut from magicians who perform tableside tricks to artists who sketch pictures of diners.


Ex-State Senator Is at Center of Embezzlement Charges
Angry residents of Rockland County find themselves with a lot of unanswered questions this summer about how the county's only gas and electric company has been spending consumers' money.
The talk has nothing to do with the cost of air-conditioning, but rather with allegations of campaign fraud, commercial bribery and embezzlement.


Bosnian Parliament Votes 65 to 0 to Reject the U.N. Peace Proposal
Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Parliament voted tonight to reject a United Nations peace plan and return the Bosnian negotiating team to Geneva to seek territorial and constitutional adjustments to the proposal, which would reorganize this country into three ethnic republics.
The 65-to-0 vote portends a prolongation of the war in Bosnia, since earlier this week the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, threatened new Serbian military action unless Parliament accepted the United Nations plan.


Yankees' Ace Puts Them In the Hole
This could not have been Jimmy Key.
It must have been an impostor.
Key had never been removed in the fourth inning while pitching for the Yankees.
He had never allowed three homers in one start and had allowed two in the same inning just once.
It could not have been Key.
Could it?
The Yankees wished that it wasn't their ace getting hammered today at Cleveland Stadium, but it was and it was ugly.
The Indians scored two runs in the first, three more in the third on two homers and another in the fourth on the final homer Key yielded.
Then came a deliberate stroll to the mound from Manager Buck Showalter to end Key's shortest outing of the year after three and one-third innings.
Showalter did not ask for a driver's license.
It was definitely Key whose location was poor and who was battered as a result.

Instead, President Clinton and his family depend on the Washington Fire Department's Engine Company 13 and its four trucks, housed 13 blocks away.

East Europe Waits for the West's Welcome Wagon
Since the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, many politicians in the region say they have been looking for Western Europe to fulfill promises they believe were made four years ago.
The pledges, they say, were along the following lines: Get rid of the Communists and we will welcome you back to the fold.
The welcome had been less than was expected during those euphoric days.
The Czech Prime Minister, Vaclav Klaus, had complained that Western Europe has put up a "Do Not Disturb" sign on its door.

Warsaw Ghetto
To the Editor: As a sometime professional visitor to Warsaw, I read with interest Jane Perlez's "What's Doing in Warsaw." I was distressed by the absence of any mention of the Warsaw ghetto in the "Sightseeing" section or, for that matter, any other site of Jewish interest.


Dinkins Hopes to Lift Spirits in Rainbow Room
The last time a New York City mayoral candidate held a party in the Rainbow Room, he didn't get very far.
City Council President Andrew J. Stein, with the help of Joan Rivers, rode 65 stories above Rockefeller Center at Christmastime for a fund-raiser, but by Memorial Day he had dropped out of the race.
Now Mayor David N. Dinkins hopes to exorcise those ghosts from the Art Deco aerie by asking 1,000 donors to join him for supper after the Oct. 19 show of Bette Midler at Radio City Music Hall.
The co-chairmen of the party are Robert De Niro; Robert J. Morgado, the Warner Records executive and former aide to Gov.
Hugh L. Carey, and Jonathan M. Tisch, the president and chief executive of the Loews Hotels and the head of New York's host committee for the Grammy Awards.


Trimmer and Seasoned, Pork Makes a Comeback
PORK has been out of fashion in recent years.
But when I was growing up, we probably ate it once a week.
A favorite method of preparation was to bake a pork chop in the undiluted contents of a can of Campbell's mushroom soup.
A cinch, every time.
But, as people began to discover other meats such as lamb and venison, pork gradually fell into disfavor.
You didn't see it on many restaurant menus anymore, unless barbecue was being served.

A MILD CASE
I found Jack J. Hersch's About Men column "A Mild Case" (Aug. 1) disturbing.
I was born with a cleft lip and palate, not a crippling disability but a serious disfigurement.
My parents' unresolved feelings of shame and anger when I was born damaged all of us.
Sensing the disappointment they tried to hide, I grew up feeling I should never have been born.


Frances Moore, Peter J. Hirzel
Frances Turman Moore, the daughter of the Rev.
Linda T. Moore of Lewiston, Me., and Robert T. Moore of Washington, was married yesterday to Peter Jacob Hirzel, a son of Margaret Cox of Weare, N.H., and Conrad Hirzel of Ridgewood, N.J.

Dallas
After the summer swelter, September and October bring two much-awaited events to Dallas: cooler temperatures and the State Fair of Texas.
During the fair, which runs from Oct. 1 to Oct. 24 and is one of the largest such expositions in the United States, Dallas casts aside its cosmopolitan pretenses and celebrates small-town traditions like pie-baking and jelly-making contests, pinto-bean cookoffs, cattle and horse shows and quilting bees.
As it celebrates the cowboy culture, though, Dallas also displays its passion for refined culture.
The city's downtown arts district is growing, with a new wing at the Dallas Museum of Art to open Sept. 26.
Western influences mingle with the European, even in the arts: Cezannes hang with O'Keeffes at the art museum, Shakespeare and Sam Shepard share a stage at the Arts District Theater and country-Western bands play to outdoor crowds while orchestras perform at the Meyerson Symphony Center.
Expensive Continental and French restaurants are easy to find, but the real treasures are places that grill a perfect steak, smoke a rack of thick barbecued ribs or dish up a zesty plate of Tex-Mex food.
Events
The State Fair of Texas is the biggest annual celebration in a state where big is almost always better.
This year's fair runs from Oct. 1 to Oct. 24 at Fair Park, about 277 acres of fairgrounds and Art Deco buildings dating from the 1936 Texas centennial.


Conversations/Stanley Crouch; A Jazz Critic Stretches His Solos, Not Caring Who Winces in Pain
THE words tumble out urgently, often poetically, from a man whose spiritual tattoo is jazz.
He sees himself as the voice of the people rather than as the provocateur that some think he is.
"I've been applauded by black bus drivers, subway drivers, mechanics, various people who have come up to me and said, 'I'm sure glad somebody is saying it.' That's enough for me. I don't care what some trickle-down Negro Marxist says. That means nothing to me. And I don't care what some confused group of what a friend calls 'lumpen bourgeoisie middle-class black folks who want to be street' say."


Indications of the Year of the Camera
THE photographic orgy promised for the fall by the Art Museum at Princeton University has already begun -- in the form of three concurrent shows drawn from the permanent collection.
They are "Contemporary Photographs," "Ray K. Metzker: Photographs 1957 to 1989" and "Empire: British 19th-Century Photographs."
On Tuesday, they will be joined by pictures of ancient Athens taken by an archeologist, Alison Frantz -- these an adjunct to the season's biggie, "Goddess and Polis," a display of classical art pertaining to Athena.
Less than a month later, there opens "What Photographs Look Like," a show related to the survey course taught by Peter C. Bunnell, who is faculty curator of photography at the museum and professor of the history of photography at the university.


Teacher Is Relieved of Classes After Showing Abortion Film
A teacher who showed an anti-abortion film to seventh graders will not return to the classroom while awaiting a state disciplinary hearing.
William Wienecke, who required students to watch the documentary in June, is to work on special projects at Somers Middle School until further notice, said Dr.
Gary M. Loewenberg, interim superintendent at the Somers Central School District in northern Westchester County.


That Letter
To the Editor:
As the editor of a Jewish newspaper, I have often wondered -- not idly but with a powerful desire to penetrate an intellectual mystery -- why some people deny the Holocaust.
The letter in your Aug. 1 issue gave me part of the answer.
It was a breathtaking model of wrongheadedness and sheer nuttiness.
The high weirdness of this letter was driven home by the final paragraph: "Another costly tale: the 'moon landings' (filmed in Nevada and complete with 'moon rocks') from Tricky Dick's reign in Washington. The subsequent costs include scores of billions of dollars in welfare payments to scientists and engineers at NASA," etc.
Besides being a hoot, this accusation illuminates the nature of at least one segment of Holocaust deniers.
They are racked by suspicion, to the point of clinical paranoia.


Theresa Ward, W. J. Mendrzycki
Theresa Ward, the daughter of Mary Ward of Monroe, N.Y., and the late Michael Ward, was married yesterday to William John Mendrzycki, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward C. Mendrzycki of Bronxville, N.Y.
The Rev.
John Deary, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated at the Sacred Heart Church in Monroe.
Mrs.
Ward Mendrzycki, 27, is a research analyst for Bohbot Communications Inc., a media-buying service in New York.
She graduated from Hartwick College.
Her father was a retired packaging engineer at Avon Products in Suffern, N.Y.
Her mother is an account representative at Troll Associates, a textbook publisher in Mahwah, N.J.


'What a Dump!'
To the Editor:

Hindsight on Bosnia
Acknowledging errors in policy on Bosnia and Herzegovina, U.S. officials now say a 1992 partition plan that won agreement and was later abandoned may have been preferable to a policy that failed to avert war.
Article, page 10.


American Law Tackles Terrorism
THE striking thing about Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman as he was led by guards into Federal court in Manhattan last week was not that he seemed a strange and exotic figure in his clerical robes, dark glasses and red and white turban.
Rather, it was that he was entirely familiar -- the one of the 15 defendants accused in a terrorist conspiracy on American soil who was immediately recognizable.
In that sense, Mr.
Abdel Rahman symbolized how quickly the United States has absorbed and reacted to the idea that it faces a threat once associated only with faraway places.


O Brave New World, That Has Such a Silence Around It
IF only life imitated the art of science fiction.
It was a snap getting to Barsoom, the local name for Mars in the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs.
All the adventurer-gentleman John Carter had to do was stand in the Arizona desert, close his eyes and wish himself up and all the way out to Mars.
With ease he visited the spired cities, traveled along the canals and wooed and won the fair Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.
Carter did have his run-ins with a tall green fighting man named Tars Tarkas.
But nothing so mundane as a recalcitrant transistor could stay his course, as may have happened to Mars Observer, lost in space for a week now and presumed to be a dead piece of complex machinery.
Any setbacks going to Barsoom were nothing compared to the disappointments of real-life travels to Mars.


For Conway Twitty, Gems Are Humble
Back in 1957, when Conway Twitty began his recording career as a rockabilly hip-swinger in the mold of Elvis Presley, the 23-year-old singer's perception of what it would take to be a star was blissfully innocent.
"I thought I'd be as big as Elvis in two or three weeks," he once told an interviewer.
"I thought that was all it took -- put a record out."
As it turned out, Twitty was to become as big a star as Elvis, but only for two or three weeks.
His feverish 1958 classic, "It's Only Make Believe," became a No. 1 rock-and-roll hit -- but Twitty was unable to duplicate its top-of-the-charts success until he traded in his rock-and-roll shoes for a pair of old cowboy boots in the mid-60's.


AUGUST 22-28: Detroit Police Beating; Two Murder Convictions, And a City Heaves a Big Sigh
When two former Detroit police officers were convicted of second-degree murder last week in the beating death of Malice Green, a black motorist, there was some sorrow expressed by religious leaders for the disgraced officers and their families.
But for the most part, there was relief.
Ever since Nov. 5, when Mr.
Green died after being stopped by police and repeatedly hit over the head with heavy metal flashlights, the city had anxiously awaited the trial and the verdicts, fearful that an acquittal could spark a firestorm similar to the one that blazed through Los Angeles following the 1992 Rodney King trial.


In Quest of His Vanished Crown
The complete Pete Sampras is a formidable tennis weapon who has, at least to the naked eye, no apparent flaws as he takes aim at the United States Open, the tournament that has historically been as much of a breakdown as a breakthrough event for him.
This year's Open is especially pivotal to Sampras not only because he wants to avenge the most traumatic defeat of his career, last year's four-set final-round loss to the two-time defending champion Stefan Edberg, but also because an Open championship is the bookend he needs to balance his 1993 Wimbledon title and regain his No. 1 ranking.


Holly Hegener, J. B. Cummings
Hilary Robinson Hegener, the daughter of Peter and Karen Hegener of Princeton, N.J., was married yesterday to Jonathan Benton Cummings, a son of Dr.
Nancy B. Cummings and Milton C. Cummings Jr., both of Washington.
The Rev.
Daphne Hawkes performed the Episcopal ceremony by the Beaverkill River in Lewbeach, N.Y.
The bride, 28, is known as Holly.
She is an associate in the Washington office of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, a Los Angeles law firm.
She and her husband graduated from Yale University, she cum laude and he magna cum laude.
She received a law degree from the University of Chicago.
Her parents are the founders and chief executives of Peterson's, a publishing company in Princeton.


Making Japan Cheaper For the Japanese
PRIME MINISTER MORIHIRO HOSOKAWA finally brought his campaign for sweeping change to Parliament last week, only to get heckled, then challenged for being vague in his prescriptions for giving the long-suffering consumer a break from Japan's famously high prices.
But if there was a lesson in this bruising start, it was that the best place to watch for real reform may not be the imposing Parliament building but Yukio Higuchi's liquor stores.
Mr.
Higuchi runs that rarest of Japanese companies, a discounter.
He also relies heavily on imports, and so the soaring value of the yen recently has been a godsend, allowing him to undercut domestic spirits producers and the legions of stodgy retailers who refuse to pass along the benefits of the strong currency to their customers.


Rachel L. Sterns, Brent M. Becker
Mr. and Mrs.
Joel E. Sterns of Washington Crossing, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Rachel Lee Sterns to Brent Michael Becker, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard D. Becker of Fairfield, Conn.
An October wedding is planned.
Miss Sterns, 30, a graduate of Tulane University, is a film production coordinator in Los Angeles.
Her father is the president of Hannoch Weisman, a law firm in Trenton and Roseland, N.J.
He was the chief counsel to Gov.
Richard J. Hughes of New Jersey from 1966 to 1969.


Barneys Bets the Store
Gene Pressman is like an expectant father, anxious but proud, as he threads his way through the construction activity at his family's new store in uptown Manhattan.
Platoons of workers are lugging Sheetrock and lumber, power tools whine and electrical coils hang every few feet.
On a crisp June day, less than three months before the scheduled opening of this new Barneys on Sept. 8, the nine-floor store is still very much a work in progress.
But as he climbs an unfinished staircase here, or ducks under a workman's ladder there, Pressman is familiar with every floor, every fixture, every piece of furniture that is on its hurried way.
On the first floor of the women's department, perfumes will be in the back instead of the front.
"I hate it when you get spritzed when you walk into a store," he says.
Pressman likes aquariums, so there will be three big ones.
He's a boxer, and the store's ninth-floor health club will have a ring.
He's also a golfer, so maybe the putting green will come later.


About the Energy Tax
To the Editor:
The article advocated that farmers reduce their energy use by "no tillage" practices.
Most people outside the farming industry do not realize that no-till farming is inherently chemical-intensive farming.
Tillage inhibits the growth of insects and weeds.
If the soil is not tilled, it is typically sprayed with herbicides and insecticides.
No-till reduces soil erosion, but increases chemical pollution of water and crops.
These chemicals are also very expensive.


Ghost Story
"Did you read Beryl Markham's book, 'West With the Night'?" Ernest Hemingway wrote his editor, Maxwell Perkins.
"I knew her fairly well in Africa and never would have suspected that she could and would put pen to paper except to write in her pilot's log book. As it is, she has written so well, and marvelously well, that I was completely ashamed of myself as a writer."
Dear Mr.
Hemingway: Would that you were alive today to know that you were right the first time.
Beryl Markham probably didn't write that book.
And the person who probably did write it was influenced not only by memories of Isak Dinesen, whom you once said should have won the Nobel Prize in your stead, but -- dare one say it? -- Ernest Hemingway.


Marcella Gilbert, Pieter Boelhouwer
Marcella Ayers Gilbert, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
John N. Gilbert Jr. of Brooklyn, was married yesterday to Pieter James Alexander Boelhouwer, a son of Mrs.
Cornelis Boelhouwer of Wethersfield, Conn., and the late Dr.
Boelhouwer.
The Rev.
F.
Goldthwaite Sherrill, an Episcopal priest, officiated at the Wardsboro (Vt.) United Methodist Church.
The bride and bridegroom, both 26, are law students, she at Boston University and he at Yale University.
She graduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania.


Tennis and Queens: Uneasy Partnership
When tennis officials first proposed a $172 million expansion of the site of the United States Open, they hoped the deal would sail through with the efficiency of a Steffi Graf straight-sets triumph.
Indeed, the proposal to add 25 acres to the site of the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park was embraced by city officials, including the chief negotiator of the accord, who called it "the best municipal sports deal in the country."


Let's Keep Political Coercion Out of Religion; Reed's Stealth Agenda
To the Editor:
"The Religious Right Reaches Out" (Op-Ed, Aug. 22) by Ralph Reed Jr. demonstrates why the Christian Coalition is one of the most dangerous forces on the American scene today.
Mr.
Reed's organization is not dangerous because its ideas are persuasive or its supporters numerous, but because it operates through a calculated effort to deceive the public about its fundamentalist objectives.
The Christian Coalition has recognized that many of its theocratic principles, especially its restrictive views on women's rights, are abhorrent to a majority of Americans.
Mr.
Reed's organization has employed a strategy of "stealth candidates," who conceal their true agendas and pretend to be concerned citizens with moderate social views.
Such candidates are coached to finesse questions about separation of church and state and their adherence to a literalist interpretation of the Bible.


Rest Easy, Mr. Jordan
To the Editor:
In many of the ghost movies Kenneth M. Chanko discussed in his article "When It Comes to the Hereafter, Romance and Sentiment Rule"  [ Aug. 8 ] , the deceased return to earth to do their good deeds, as we all know.
Then, their mission accomplished, they go back to wherever it is they came from, this time for good.
But apparently, as not all of us knew, ghost movies themselves can follow the same path.


Woman, Computer Nerd -- and Proud
INTRODUCTORY computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is called 6.001, or "double-o-one" for short.
It is to aspiring computer scientists what anatomy is to first-year medical students.
One of M.I.T.'s most demanding courses, 001 is the initial filter for students bold enough to embark on electrical engineering/computer science, the most popular major at what is arguably the most difficult science school in the nation.
The class, which starts again when M.I.T. opens next week, frightens many students, women in particular.
Indeed, fields like computer science and engineering have never attracted many women.

The Executive Computer; In a Battle of the Spreadsheet, Borland Acts the 'Barbarian'
FOR the self-styled barbarians at Borland International Inc., who have been besieged and bloodied all year by lawyers and disappointed stockholders, it may come as a relief to face some simple, brutal competition once again in the hotly contested Windows spreadsheet market.
Borland introduced a new version of its Quattro Pro for Windows spreadsheet last week, a few months after the introduction of the rival spreadsheet Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4.0, and a few months ahead of the next major update of Microsoft Excel.
The three programs dominate the Windows spreadsheet category, with Excel the defending sales champion, Lotus a strong second and Borland trailing in third place.


RESULTS PLUS
LITTLE LEAGUE  Long Beach Wins The United States has its second straight Little League title, and this one was won on the field.
Pinch-hitter Jeremy Hess, batting .167 for the week, hit a bases-loaded, two-out single to right field in the bottom of the sixth and final inning yesterday, giving Long Beach, Calif., a 3-2 victory over Panama in the championship game of the Little League World Series at Williamsport, Pa.
Long Beach became the first United States team to win consecutive titles.
It was awarded last year's championship, 6-0, after the Philippines team was found to be using overage players.
The Californians lost last year's title game on the field, 15-4. (AP) TENNIS

For Those Who Read Before They Dig
THERE is a familiar phrase, "Look it up." Every school child soon learns this command whether it comes from a teacher or a parent.
Gardeners have to look it up, too, and they usually have a stack of reference books handy.
If not, answers are often difficult to find.
The easiest way to solve this problem is to own a sturdy garden library.
A few general reference books will prove their merit over time.
Several books may be out of print and either the library or a second-hand bookstore would be possible sources.


FIGHT SLEEPISM. NAP NOW!
Three z-z-z's to James Gorman for his sonorous, witty defense of my lifelong passion: napping ("Fight Sleepism. Nap Now!" Aug. 8).
For me, it started when, as a child, I was frequently dunked, like in slam, into the net-lined luggage racks of European trains.
My technique was perfected, not to say tested, in World War II while riding in the turret of a Sherman tank, rumbling across the flatlands of France toward the Rhine -- an experience akin to napping in a rotating cement mixer.
And now I continue to be "in a meeting" daily, between 2 and 3 P.M., for my regular 28 minutes of restorative napping.

A Working Playwright Edges Into Fame
The playwright Terrence McNally says that he habitually beats up on himself, and most of his friends confirm it.
"I'm a major self-flagellator," he admits.
"I never feel up to the mark. I should be better. Every play should be better. It's my Irish-Catholic background. I can find something wrong with everything. Someone tells me, 'You have a nice house,' and I say, 'Yeah, but it's not near the ocean. Larry Kramer has a beautiful house, right near the ocean. And have you seen Edward Albee's house? He has a self-contained resort.' "


Questions Raised in Amazon Killings
Brazilian gold miners relentlessly pursued the inhabitants of two Indian lodges through the Amazon jungle, killing dozens in a series of ambushes and skirmishes from early July through early August, according to survivors' accounts compiled here.
But 10 days after the first reports of the massacre filtered out of the forest 180 miles west of here, there is still confusion over such basic facts as the death toll and whether the attacked lodges were in Brazil or Venezuela.


Looking to the End Of Another Plague
SINCE Biblical times, leprosy has been a disease so frightening that the word "leper" has come to signify not just the infection but the ostracism of its mutilated victims.
Now the World Health Organization has a goal that as little as 10 years ago seemed impossible -- to virtually eliminate leprosy by the year 2000.
At the 14th International Leprosy Congress, which meets in Florida this week, how realistic or optimistic that goal is will be discussed.


Pamela Lawrence, Raymond Endreny
Pamela C. Lawrence, a daughter of Dr.
Constance Lawrence and John B. Lawrence Jr. of Weston, Conn., was married yesterday to Raymond M. Endreny, a son of Mary Diamond of Interlaken, N.Y., and the late Richard Endreny.
The Rev.
Henry Yordon, a Congregational minister, officiated at the Meadowlands, a community estate, in Darien, Conn.
The bride, 29, graduated a magna cum laude graduate from Brown University and is a third-year law student at Columbia University.
Her father is a freelance writer.
Her mother is a psychotherapist in Weston, and the director of the Christian Counseling Center in Norwalk.


Bachelor of Arts
FOR Calvin Klein, Bianca Jagger and Ian Schrager, it must have seemed like old times.
Fifteen years after the heyday of Studio 54, they were together again on a dance floor, surrounded once more by the kind of pretty men and handsome women who somehow manage to look polished even when sweaty.
But Ross Bleckner, who was dancing with them in the backyard of his new summer house, which used to belong to Truman Capote, was hardly having a flashback.


Miss Ravitch, Mr. Luu Van Lang
Dina Suzanne Ravitch, a daughter of Beverly and Stanley Ravitch of New York, was married yesterday to Jean-Claude Luu Van Lang, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Robert Luu Van Lang of Paris.
Magistrate Naomi R. Buchwald officiated at Estherwood in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
The bride graduated from Oberlin College and is to receive an M.B.A. from Columbia University in the fall.
Her father recently retired as the production manager for Pilgrim Too Sportswear in New York.
Her mother is a principal attorney for the New York State Power Authority in Manhattan.


Second Time Around
To the Editor:
I enjoyed Caryn James's essay on "Robin Hood: Men in Tights"  [ "Mel Brooks vs. the Boyz N the Wood," Aug. 1 ] .
What Ms.
James didn't mention is that this film is Mr.
Brooks's second Robin Hood spoof.
The ABC series "When Things Were Rotten" (1975) starred Dick Gautier as the famed archer of Sherwood Forest and Dick Van Patten as Friar Tuck.
The television show lasted about a dozen weeks.


FIGHT SLEEPISM. NAP NOW!
I was disappointed that James Gorman failed to list, along with the opera house and the lecture hall, what is for many of us the ideal place to nap -- a house of worship.
The somniferous sentences that stream from the mouth of the sermonizer, whether in Latin, Hebrew or King James's English, lull me gently to dreamland.

AUGUST 22-28: A Defiant Gesture; Seeking More Territory, Bosnia's Parliament Rejects U.N. Peace Plan
As Muslim and Croat fighters pounded away at each other in the towns of Mostar and Gornji Vakuf despite a three-week-old cease-fire, Bosnia's Parliament rejected yesterday a United Nations peace plan that would divide the country into three ethnically based republics.
Charging that the peace proposal would legitimize the Bosnian Serbs' brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing, the Bosnian Parliament decided to send the country's delegation back to Geneva to seek adjustments that would restore formerly Muslim-majority districts to the proposed Muslim-dominated republic.


Acupuncture, Homeopathy And Chiropractic at the Vet's
POOR Prince.
Like many of his breed, this 8-year-old German shepherd has chronic arthritis caused by a hereditary malformation of his hip joints.
Prince needs relief from his constant pain, but long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, Tylenol or cortisone have had undesirable side effects, like upset stomach, dizziness and loss of appetite, which shouldn't happen to a dog.
What can be done?
Homeopathic medicine, acupuncture, chiropractic and nutrition, say veterinarians who are committed to using alternative therapies in their practices.


U.S. Policymakers on Bosnia Admit Errors in Opposing Partition in 1992
Almost a year and a half ago, the United States opposed a partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina that had been agreed to by leaders of the republic's Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
The idea was to stave off a civil war.
Now, tens of thousands of deaths later, the United States is urging the leaders of the three Bosnian factions to accept a partition agreement similar to the one Washington opposed in 1992.


Ads to Die For? To Gene Kelly, It's Yes and No
A new Gap advertisement featuring Gene Kelly is giving some people the wrong impression.
The ad is part of a campaign that shows archival black-and-white photographs of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe, Ernest Hemingway, Rock Hudson and Amelia Earhart wearing their own pairs of khakis.
Mr.
Kelly, who celebrated his 81st birthday on Monday, and Arthur Miller, who didn't respond to a request for an interview, are the only two living people included in the campaign.


That Letter
To the Editor:
Despite the cries of outrage that will doubtless be pouring into your mail room, you nevertheless must absolutely continue to publish such scurrilous filth as the letter submitted by Kirk S. Nevin.
Mr.
Nevin had the comfortable temerity to describe the Nazis' photographically documented annihilation of millions of innocents as "the alleged misdeeds of the midcentury German efforts against select minorities."


A Sad Lesson
To the Sports Editor:
I think we all have a tendency to look for the lesson that can be learned from a tragic event; it seems to be the American way.
The killing of Michael Jordan's father is one of those tragedies.
For example, I have seen a number of concerned officials and citizens talk about how this murder should drive home the need for gun control.

Haute Couture Is Never Passe
A glamorous preview recently took place here at the auction house Drouot Richelieu.
Lined up on tiers amphitheater-style were rows of mannequins exquisitely decked out in haute couture dating mostly from the 1920's to the 1960's.
"The Art in Fashion: Modernity of Yesteryear" was the theme of the exhibition and sale, which highlighted pivotal styles in the evolution of 20th-century fashion.
Creations by some 43 designers included 23 flowing geometric constructions by Vionnet, 12 of Chanel's youthful outfits inspired by street clothes, and 20 by Givenchy, notably his 1950's bouffant blouses that revolutionized separates.
Several of the more desirable pieces sold for more than $20,000 each.
In many ways, the annual Paris sale -- this was the third -- crystallizes a market that recognizes couture as fine art, not simply wearable fashion.
The catalogue has established a new level of scholarship, including provenances, that will be difficult to ignore in the future.
The preview was on a par with costume shows mounted by the Metropolitan Museum in New York or by the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan.
The next such exhibition at the Metropolitan, "Versailles 1973: American Fashion on the World Stage," which opens on Sept. 9, will recreate the historic debut of contemporary American couture in Paris.


Cheryl Eley and Joel Council
AS a couple, Cheryl Eley and Joel Council share an enthusiasm for carrot cake, hip-hop music, colorful African-inspired clothes, three-course picnics in Central Park, aerobics and the Bible.
They think of themselves as proof that one can be both cool and devoutly religious.
They met about two years ago at a Tuesday night prayer meeting at the Brooklyn Tabernacle, a nondenominational, interracial church surrounded by storefronts on Flatbush Avenue in Park Slope.
The church has no spire and little architectural drama.
The drama here comes from the church's evangelical spirit and its 250-member choir, both of which draw large crowds to the Sunday services.

Boonton Journal; Antiques Shoppers or Corporate Development?
PLANS to revitalize Main Street here to take advantage of a new stretch of highway that could speed antiques shoppers into town are facing an uncertain future under a new administration that will take office in January.
The opening of the final section of Interstate 287, which could come as early as November, will link this Morris County town of 8,300 with the New York Thruway.
Community leaders say the opening will provide an important opportunity to attract new customers to the antiques stores and specialty shops along Main Street, a half-mile shopping district that winds up a hill past turn-of-the-century buildings.


Late Night Fun to Rival Letterman
SUDDENLY this summer, several late-night cafes on West Broadway between Broome and Grand streets in SoHo have turned that once-desolate stretch into a block that never sleeps.
And with the opening last month of What Comes Around Goes Around, you can shop for vintage clothing at all hours, too.
The 1,250-square-foot store, featuring about a century's worth of fashion, officially closes at midnight during the week and 2 A.M. on weekends.


Cuomo Adding 5 Judges To a Busy Appeals Court
In an effort to reduce a growing backlog in appeals court cases from most of New York City and its suburbs, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo has agreed to appoint five more judges to the swamped state appellate bench that covers the area.
The Governor's office and officials of the state court system say the move to expand the Appellate Division in Brooklyn is a vital step to cope with an outmoded, century-old state appellate structure.


Close Up the Summer House With a Plan
VACATING a summer home can be less hectic if a closing strategy is mapped.
The goals should be to secure the house against the elements, prevent indoor damage from pests, dampness and poor air circulation and minimize the likelihood of break-ins.
Outdoor tasks can usually be carried out well ahead of time.
They consist mostly of ordinary chores like painting, repairing siding and mending window screens, but make a point of examining the roof and chimney for damage and give priority to fixing those if time grows short.


Holocaust Sculpture Sets Off Dispute at Washington Museum
TWENTY-SIX years ago William Tarr, a sculptor in East Hampton, began work on a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.
He had no commission and no assurance that the piece would be seen outside his studio.
He had just a vision of a set of gates "bristling with points, seething, angry, defiant." They would be menacing, as he later described them, "reminiscent of the hell these people went through and yet representing escape."

Jennifer Ann Whyman, the daughter of Frank and Susan Whyman of Fair Haven, N.J., was married last evening to David Nelson Greene, a son of Joseph and Elizabeth Greene of Purchase, N.Y.
Rabbi Sally Priesand officiated at the Ocean Beach Club in Elberon, N.J.
The bride, 31, graduated from Mount Holyoke College and received an M.B.A. from the University of Miami.
She is a partner in Einhorn &amp; Company in New York, a stockbrokerage at which her father is the managing partner.
The company was founded by the bride's maternal grandfather, the late Benjamin Einhorn, who was also a governor of the New York Stock Exchange.


Supporters of Public Toilet Plan Dismayed by Advertising Kiosks
In a four-month trial last year, six public toilets installed on Manhattan sidewalks in self-contained kiosks won raves from the public, prompting promises from city officials to install the units in all five boroughs.
But now, as the city has presented its proposal for companies interested in the franchise to install the toilets, some people are beginning to have second thoughts.
Members of local community boards were surprised to learn that a plan for 200 toilets in the first five years could actually mean 600 structures fighting for space on crowded sidewalks.


Louise Burnham, George Packard
Mr. and Mrs.
David C. Burnham of Providence, R.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Louise Campbell Burnham, to George William Warren Packard, the son of Mrs.

Ms.
Burnham, 32, is a development officer at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business in Stanford, Calif.
She graduated from Yale University, as did her fiance, and received a master's degree in English from Middlebury College.
She and her fiance are the authors of "Central Park: A Visit to One of the World's Most Treasured Landscapes" (Crescent Books, 1993).


Aliens' Advocates See Peril In a Restrictive Health Plan
Advocates for immigrants and officials from some cities and hospitals warn that President Clinton's proposal to exclude the nation's more than three million illegal aliens from his health-care plan could endanger public health.
They note that viruses do not respect citizenship status and that failure to treat sick illegal aliens could therefore endanger many Americans who rely on immigrants, both legal and illegal, to prepare and serve food, clean homes and hotel rooms and care for children.
In addition, some hospital and city officials fear that they could be impoverished by the Clinton proposal because they intend to continue to provide health care to illegal aliens but without the Federal money they now receive under a variety of programs.


Learning Never To Say Never
To the Editor:
The passing of a biographer of the stature of Louis Sheaffer, who died earlier this month, is apt to go unnoticed if only because he was a reticent writer laboring under the shadow of the preeminent writer, Eugene O'Neill.
Although Sheaffer's Pulitzer Prize-winning two-volume biography is critically regarded as a definitive work, his subject's fame has obscured Sheaffer's accomplishment.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Valet Parkers Sans Space
SOUTHAMPTON has a new way of parking.
That's thanks to two merchants on Main Street who grew tired of including in their overhead the cost of paying their customers' $25 tickets.
"I absorbed parking tickets," Judy Hadlock said, "because the parking is not adequate in Southampton. You can never find a spot." And if you do, she added, the hourly restrictions don't offer enough time to shop.

And the Band Plays On
A THURSDAY, NOON: An awful thing happens to Lester Lanin.
Near his apartment on the Upper East Side, the diminutive man who has led society orchestras since 1925 shoulders his burdens -- a hanging bag containing a $2,000 tailored tuxedo, a Samsonite suitcase filled with patent-leather shoes and stomach tablets, and his personal traveling pillow.
He pulls himself up the steep stairs of a chartered bus and encounters evil.
It takes the human form of the bus driver, who is probably thought by most people who know him to be a nice enough guy.
But on this day in early August he will somehow become locked in a death struggle with the positive life force of Lester Lanin.

Riots Relived As Jury Views Beating Tapes
Under tight security in a wood-paneled courtroom on the ninth floor of the Criminal Courts Building here, the horror of last year's riots is being relived.
The legal precision of the courtroom stands in contrast to the chaos of the early hours of the rioting when, prosecutors say, Damian Monroe Williams, 20, and Henry Keith Watson, 28, converged with several dozen others at the corner of Florence and Normandie Avenues and attacked motorists and bystanders.


The Disappearing $2,000 Book
ONCE upon a time storytellers perpetuated the tales of the tribe by memorizing them.
With the invention of books, memory became less important: if you forgot something, you could look it up.
Then came the computer; to access its electronic memory, all you had to remember was which key to press.
Now this evolution has come full circle with a story-on-a-disk that destroys itself as you read it, leaving nothing but the memory of words glimpsed briefly on a computer screen.
The author of the self-sabotaging story is William Gibson, whose 1984 novel "Neuromancer" gave birth to the terms "cyberpunk" and "cyberspace." Cyberpunk is science fiction with an attitude; it imagines a future in which people use the latest technology to do nasty things to one another.
Mr.
Gibson's characters, who spend the better part of their lives literally plugged into supercomputers, experience electronic data-flow as sensory input; they live in a "consensual hallucination" that Mr.
Gibson has dubbed cyberspace.


In Coupons, It's Catalina at the Checkout
CONSUMERS are growing tired of all those coupons stuffed in Sunday newspapers.
They're a time-consuming hassle, and even when properly clipped, are often forgotten at home or in the car when the shopping is done.
Last year, redemption rates were roughly flat.
So makers of consumer products, who rely on coupons to introduce new products and to encourage brand switching, are turning to coupons issued at the supermarket checkout.
While they cost about six times more than those in newspapers, their redemption rate is much higher.

She is to become an English teacher in September at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore.


Sports of The Times; Frat-House Baseball Has Limits
THE players are different today.
That's what baseball managers keep saying, and maybe they always did.
Dallas Green was saying it recently to explain the assorted shenanigans with the Mets.
Heaving a firecracker toward fans.
Spraying bleach in the clubhouse.
"Oh, very different," Green said with a knowing smile.
He suggested that today's manager has much less control over players than back in the good old days of 1980, when Green won a World Series with the Phillies.
Back then a manager could bellow in a closed clubhouse and writers could hear every malediction.


U.S. Should Resume Medicare Operation
To the Editor:
Further to the discussion of Medicare's origins in "Get Blue Cross Out of the Medicare Business" (letter, Aug. 12) by Israel A. Jaffe: When Medicare was enacted under the Social Security Administration in Baltimore in 1965, the Division of Direct Reimbursement was formed and operated under my direction.
In the beginning, the Government was the fiscal intermediary and disbursed funds to more than 300 providers, including New York City's hospitals.


CONNECTICUT GUIDE
HOWLIN' JOE
Howlin' Joe Warner was a self-styled cowboy-photographer from Hartford who got the sobriquet by signing one of his self-portraits that way while on a sojourn in the Wild West.
His real name was Frank G. Warner and his father was a prominent businessman; one of his uncles was a newspaper editor, Charles Dudley Warner, and another was the actor William Gillette.


That Letter
To the Editor:
I was both saddened and amused to read Kirk S. Nevin's epistolary example of shooting oneself in the intellect.
While he seems to be a Holocaust denier, his argument points to Germany's payments of reparations.
Now, why would a major democratic nation admit to having perpetrated such horrible atrocities and attempt financial mitigation if the Holocaust never happened?
Mr.
Nevin proves that you don't have to think clearly to fantasize.

About the Energy Tax
To the Editor:
Messrs.
Morris and Lewis state that "the funny thing" is that when a broad-based energy tax was proposed in the budget discussions, it was cited as having only a deficit-reduction benefit.
They may have been napping during the long debates, but it was proposed as having three benefits: reduction of the budget deficit, of the foreign trade deficit and of carbon dioxide emissions.
And it still lost.

Giants Get Deshaies to Bolster Rotation
The slumping San Francisco Giants helped their shaky starting pitching yesterday by acquiring left-hander JIM DESHAIES from the Minnesota Twins for three minor leaguers.


Home From Camp, Trailing Fond Memories
Maria Lugo stood behind a barrier at the George Washington Bridge bus terminal waiting anxiously for her son, Joshua Velez.
Although this was Joshua's second year at camp, Ms.
Lugo said she missed him even more than last summer.
"I have been crying for two weeks," she said, watching the gate where he was to emerge.


Summer's Message: No Baloney
The two best-received thrillers of the summer certainly look as if they have a lot in common.
Their stories are different, being about an assassination attempt and a doctor fleeing unjust imprisonment; yet on a scene-by-scene basis their similarities are remarkable.
The main characters of both "In the Line of Fire" and "The Fugitive," for example, rent rooms from heavily accented landladies.
In both films, authorities kid around when the phone rings at headquarters, then frantically try to trace conversations once they realize their quarries are on the line.
Both films feature middle-of-the-night raids on the wrong suspects, scenes used to catch an audience off guard.
And then there are the endings: both build up to showdowns staged in hotel ballrooms.
Incidentally, the ballroom confrontation is such a staple of this genre that Andrew Davis, the director of "The Fugitive," included another ballroom showdown in "The Package," one of his earlier thrillers.
Like Wolfgang Petersen's "In the Line of Fire," "The Package" is about an attempted political assassination.


A Ray of Hope For the Ozone
Government scientists reported last week that they had detected a slowdown in the rate at which chemicals that deplete the earth's protective ozone layer are accumulating in the atmosphere.
The chemicals, called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, have been used in producing foam packaging and as cooling agents in air conditioners and refrigerators.
Their manufacture has been banned by international agreement as of Jan. 1, 1996, but last week's announcement indicated that industries are phasing them out faster than the agreement requires.


Hop Goes the Island
11th annual Morning Party, Fire Island Pines, Aug. 22.


The New Season's Symphonic Lineup
LOOKING forward to forthcoming programs by the county's orchestras -- which are, in alphabetical order, the Chappaqua Chamber Orchestra, the New Orchestra of Westchester, Philharmonia Virtuosi and the Westchester Symphony -- one must remember that early subscribers get the best seats, highest discounts and other perks.
The first symphonic event of the fall season will be offered by the New Orchestra of Westchester, which begins its 11th year at the Performing Arts Center at the State University at Purchase.
The opening concert -- on Sept. 18 at 8 P.M. and repeated on Sept. 19 at 3 P.M. -- features Berlioz's "Roman Carnival" Overture, Beethoven's "Pastoral" Symphony and Prokofiev's Second Piano Concerto (with Tedd Joselson, a Westchester native and Rye resident, as soloist).
"Tedd brings an extraordinary personal power to the keyboard," Mr.
Dunkel said.
"He will no doubt bring down the house with the Prokofiev."


The Hunt for the Tourist Dollar
THE firefighters' parade here had brought people onto the streets, so there was quite a crowd on hand last Sunday when four enormous air-conditioned tour buses wound through the downtown area.
There were also a lot of surprised faces.
The buses held more than 300 tourists from New York City and New Jersey who were being ferried through town as part of a daylong outing to two Historic Hudson Valley sites.
They had taken a boat cruise up the Hudson River from Weehawken, N.J., and Manhattan to Tarrytown, and then boarded the buses for visits to Philipsburg Manor, a working Dutch Colonial farm, and Sunnyside, the home of Washington Irving.
"I noticed the local people were looking at us like 'Why are they here?' " said Christina Chiang, who with her husband, Matthew, came from North Bergen, N.J., to take the tour.
"But I think it's very nice here, very romantic and natural. We like to travel, especially to places that have an interesting history."  One-Day Tourists to Conventions
Increasingly, the county is being marketed as a tourist destination, surprising residents who see their communities as just places to live.
The Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau, a partnership between the county and the Westchester Chamber of Commerce, coined the term "the Golden Apple" more than a decade ago to promote what they say is the county's unique charm: an appealing balance of bucolic countryside and suburban sophistication.


NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Philadelphia; Failed Stores Now a Cabaret
LATE next month, a 300-seat cabaret is scheduled to open here in what once was an 8,000-square-foot The Limited clothing store in a failed retail center known as Newmarket.
The first production by the cabaret's owners, Shelly Gross and Allen Shore (the latter was an original co-producer of "Driving Miss Daisy"), will be "Forever Plaid." Mr.
Gross would discuss neither the terms of the five-year lease nor the cost of the renovations.


Bending Reggae's Past Toward Its Future
New rhythms wrapped around old messages constantly revive pop music, and few styles have staged more imaginative revivals than reggae.
Nobody can follow all the myriad permutations in reggae fashion, not only in Jamaica but in New York and London as well.
Yet broad currents are evident.
Right now, reggae permeates pop more than it has since the death of Bob Marley in 1981, and interest in both classic and progressive reggae runs high.
Club hits like Mad Cobra's "Flex" and crossover numbers like Snow's "Informer" arrive too frequently to be isolated phenomena anymore.
By coincidence, two acts that bend reggae's past toward its future have recently released superior albums.
Shaggy's debut, "Pure Pleasure" (Virgin 87953; CD and cassette), has enough outsized vitality and infectious tunes to show that the reggae variant called dancehall is more than an erratic singles factory.
With the runaway hit "Can't Help Falling in Love" in tow, UB40's "Promises and Lies" (Virgin 88229; CD and cassette) updates the band's 15 years of subtle arrangements and seductive vocals into a collection that, now at No. 8 on the Billboard pop chart, promises to become one of the best-selling reggae albums of all time.

Abortion Doctor's Slaying Is Baffling Police in Mobile
The struggle outside the black 1993 Cadillac Eldorado lasted only seconds, but when it was over, the second abortion doctor to be shot in two days lay dying in a parking lot behind an X-rated movie theater in downtown Mobile.
Almost a week later, the police in this Deep South city are still searching the business records and personal history of the physician, Dr.
George Wayne Patterson.
They want to know whether the killing on Saturday night was a robbery gone awry or a consequence of his work.
Dr.
Patterson, 44, owned and operated four abortion clinics in Florida and Alabama.


NEW JERSEY GUIDE
ENCAMPMENT WEEKEND
An authentic 1779 wedding ceremony on Saturday will result in the official 1993 union of Darrow G. Koutis and Sandra Bravick of Milltown, as the Spy House Museum in Port Monmouth presents its 17th annual Revolutionary War Encampment Weekend.
Before the 2:30 P.M. outdoor wedding, there will be square dancing, and after it there will be a re-enactment of the 1779 skirmish at Shoal Harbor, where the Spy House has stood since 1663.
Those attending the encampment can see the wedding.


For Those Who Read Before They Dig
THERE is a familiar phrase, "Look it up." Every school child soon learns this command whether it comes from a teacher or a parent.
Gardeners have to look it up, too, and they usually have a stack of reference books handy.
If not, answers are often difficult to find.
The easiest way to solve this problem is to own a sturdy garden library.
A few general reference books will prove their merit over time.
Several books may be out of print and either the library or a second-hand bookstore would be possible sources.


Celebrating the Rustic Look and Feel
LONG ISLAND'S love affair with Italian restaurants continues.
Despite recent flirtations with French bistros and American grills, our hearts still belong to Italy.
And casual storefront cafes featuring pastas and pizzas are still popping up.
This summer's harvest has a country air.
Neon and mirrors are out, rustic reed baskets are in.


Sports of The Times; A Trip for Profit, Not for Dreams of Glory
HINDSIGHT renders Kansas' long journey yesterday as unnecessary, self-defeating and downright masochistic, but we're not talking about the Jayhawks' expedition across half a continent to get swamped by Florida State in what should have been billed as the Kick Butt Classic.
The Jayhawks went home mumbling to themselves not about losing, not even about the magnitude of their defeat.
They went home lamenting their inability to gain a yard or less on half-a-dozen goal-line pops, and, let's face it, that's a mighty humbling experience, no matter who is on the other side of the line.


New Wildlife in San Diego
Visitors to San Diego will find several new wildlife exhibits awaiting them at two of the city's most popular attractions.
The San Diego Zoo has expanded its primate population with the addition of five pygmy chimps, or bonobos.


On Coverage
To the Sports Editor:
I expect the tabloid magazines to have reporters sitting outside the Jordan's' residence waiting for a glimpse into their family's anguish; they specialize in fulfilling the public's sadistic tendencies.


Long Shot Brunswick Captures Whitney
The house of racing upsets was at its demon best today.
The heavily favored Furiously ran fourth in one race and the heavily favored Devil His Due ran third in the next, the 66th Whitney Handicap, which was won by the unranked Brunswick, scrambling the standings for year-end honors all over again.
Allen Jerkens, the master of the racing upset, the trainer who beat the great Secretariat in the Whitney exactly 20 years ago with a horse named Onion, considered the fate dealt to his star colt Devil His Due on the same Saratoga track, and said with regret: "He just wasn't good enough today. He gave it a shot. He had no problems. Brunswick was just the better today."


AUGUST 22-28: Defining Goals in Somalia; Washington Sends Soldiers, Sets Terms for Withdrawal
President Clinton's decision to send 400 Army commandos to Somalia last week ups the ante in Washington's effort to capture the fugitive warlord Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid and quell violence in Mogadishu.
But the decision also prompted Republican and Democratic lawmakers to question what appears to be an open-ended American military presence there.


Nigerian Unions Begin Strike Over Voiding of Vote
Nigerian trade unions and professional associations began an open-ended nationwide strike today to protest the military Government's annulment of presidential elections held in June.
Other demands include reversing a decision this week by the authorities in effect to raise gasoline prices 10-fold, a move that has outraged motorists.


Confronting a Great Tragedy, and Losing All Your Friends
ON the living-room shelf stands a row of pictures -- all of young men.
Individuals in close-up, twosomes with arms casually draped around each other, all smiling at the camera.
All now dead.
"They're gone," Doris Taussig said, gently touching a photo.
"You want to see more pictures of my friends? I have them in my bedroom." A walk down a short hallway in her rustic house in Fire Island Pines, and another group of photographs comes into view.

The Real Losers of '93? Taxpayers, Of Course
To the Editor:
"Winners as Well as Losers in the Great Flood of '93" (Aug. 15) conspicuously omitted a major loser: the taxpayers.
Congress has already passed a $6 billion appropriation and more may be on the way.
Since it is unlikely that other spending will be cut, the money will be borrowed, the taxpayers will be on the hook for more interest, and the economy will be further distorted.
A 25-year "super-hurricane" cycle is just beginning, so in the coming years, taxpayer exposure for disaster could rival the savings and loan debacle.


Slow Going for Disabled on Private Buses
"THE disabled have been trained in how to deal with society," Randy Isaacs, a consultant to the American Bus Association, said to a group of bus company managers in Newark this month.
"Now society must learn how to deal with the disabled."
That, Mr.
Isaacs said, is the premise of the Americans With Disabilities Act, the far-reaching civil rights law that he was explaining to 13 workshop participants who were there to learn more about it.
Since it was signed by President George Bush on July 26, 1990, the law has been taking effect gradually in bus transportation, employment and training, public accommodation and telecommunications.
The usual estimate given for the number of disabled in the United States is 43 million.
The Office of Technology Assessment of Congress estimates that in 1990, 1.4 million people used wheelchairs, 1.7 million used walkers and 3 million one or more "mobility technology devices," not counting canes and braces.
Lifts Called Crucial
The managers at the workshop represented the part of the travel industry that was given the longest time to comply with the law -- private-bus operators.
The requirement considered the biggest burden by bus operators, that they buy only lift-equipped buses, does not take effect until 1996 and 1997.
While current rules require boarding assistance and storage of wheelchairs aboard the bus -- help that allows those with some mobility to take a bus trip -- most wheelchair-users consider lifts crucial.
Lifts, they say, are essential to those with no mobility and they permit passengers to sit in their own chairs or scooters, and thus to travel autonomously.
But few private bus companies are leaping ahead on this.
The only nationwide intercity company, Greyhound, has no lift-equipped buses among the 1,850 in its active fleet.
The American Bus Association says seven companies among its 600 members have lift-equipped long-distance buses.
Part of the reason for this inaction is that the laws do not go into effect for a long time, a delay that was allowed by Congress on the ground that private long-distance bus companies were in bad financial shape.
"Congress did not do you any favors," Mr.
Isaacs told the bus managers, because final specifications for private companies' wheelchair-accessible long-distance buses have not yet been written.
Mr.
Isaacs, who has been in the transportation field for 16 years, and who was involved in the passage of the disabilities law, said that those who bought or refitted buses before seeing the regulations, which are due in draft form next year, might have bought something inadequate.
He said, however, that an interim report already released by the Office of Technology Assessment probably could be read as a outline for the regulations.
Public transit systems were affected by the law immediately; as of August 1990, a month after the law was enacted, public systems could only buy or lease buses with anchors for wheelchairs and wheelchair boarding lifts, or devices at the bus stop for boarding wheelchairs.
Since municipal buses usually remain in use for 12 years or so, the 1990 start of the law means that by 2002 all public buses will probably be lift-equipped.
There were no retrofitting requirements in this law; an earlier law requiring retrofitting had been found unconstitutional.
Some city systems, notably Denver's, were already putting lift-equipped long-distance buses into use when the disabilities law was enacted.
New York City also started early making its buses lift-equipped, having been sued in 1979 by James J. Weisman of the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association.
Mr.
Weisman says that New York City Transit Authority buses are virtually 100 percent lift-equipped now.
New Jersey Transit, a public agency, has 1,921 buses and 514 of these are lift-equipped.
None of its long-distance buses have lifts because none have been bought since 1987, said Armando Arrastia, a spokesman.
By contrast, private bus companies will not be required to buy or lease lift-equipped buses until 1996, if they are large companies, and until 1997 if they are small.
What constitutes large companies and small companies will be specified in the law.
Long-distance, or over-the-road buses, defined in the law as buses with an elevated passenger deck over the luggage compartment, do not need to be replaced for as many as 20 years, their owners say, meaning that United States intercity buses may not be all lift-equipped until 2017.
No One Is Suing
Enforcement of the disabilities law is done through lawsuits.
For example, in the first 11 months that the employment sections of the act were in effect -- from July 1992 to June 1993 -- 11,760 complaints of employment discrimination were brought.
The successful plantiffs won $11 million.
In sharp contrast, there have been no court complaints against private bus companies since the bus regulations began to come into effect, in 1991.
This does not mean everything is satisfactory to advocates for the disabled.
One reason they do not sue is that the delay in implementing the law provides narrow grounds.
Under the rules now in effect, bus companies must help people who have some mobility get onto the bus and must transport their wheelchairs; the rules also require that the deaf and blind, as well as others defined as disabled, be accommodated.
Mr.
Isaacs also explained that while lawsuits brought under the new act can result in court injunctions, individual plaintiffs cannot collect for damages, as they can in employment cases.
A bus company is required to pay penalties only if the suit is joined by the Department of Justice.
Moreover, Mr.
Isaacs said to his audience of bus company officials, "I don't know anyone in a wheelchair who wants to undergo a trip with you to sue you."
The bus regulations, current and future, are complex because not only are they different for public and private companies, but they are also different for companies with schedules and those that provide service on request, and companies that are mainly involved in providing transportation and those that provide transportation as part of some other business, such as motels that pick up customers in vans at airports.
So far, 128 companies out of the 600 that belong to the American Bus Association have signed up for or have attended one of the 10 seminars nationwide.
Mr.
Isaacs believes attendance signifies interest, rather than a wish to learn how to evade the law.
He said that the competitive marketplace might even push companies ahead of the law.
Few Services Volunteered
But rare is the company owning a lift bus that is not required to do so.
The participants in the seminar described meeting customers' needs by sending vans, or taking passengers by taxi to a bus station where a platform or a ramp is available.
Bill Kula, a spokesman for Greyhound, said that despite his company's lack of wheelchair-lift buses, "We are in compliance." With 24 hours' notice, he said, his company "can meet the vast majority of requests." Greyhound's "helping hands" policy, Mr.
Kula said, allows a companion of a disabled person to travel free to provide help at stops.
Tauck Tours, a bus-tour operator in Westport, Conn., that owns no buses but leases them from other companies, has about 200 buses in use at a peak season, according to a spokesman, Phil Otterson.
They all "lean" or "kneel," but none has a lift.
"We are fulfilling our obligations by providing boarding assistance," he said.
The Peter Pan Bus Company of Springfield, Mass., one of the seven companies with lift buses, owns 175 long-distance buses, 9 of them lift-equipped, according to a vice president, Bob Schwarz.
A Massachusetts subsidy plan helped the company buy them, Mr.
Schwarz said.
Despite the paucity of companies like Peter Pan that have lift buses, Mr.
Weisman of Eastern Paralyzed Veterans remains optimistic.
"People are beginning to realize that inaccessibility is stupid," he said.


An Old Battle Flares Up in Nicaragua
More than three years after rightist contra rebels began laying down their arms in hopes that President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro would settle the conflicts that sent them to war, the hostage crisis that gripped Nicaragua last week left the country wondering if it would ever be at peace.
On Aug. 19, Jose Angel Palavera, a 32-year-old former contra who calls himself "The Jackal," seized 38 members of a delegation that had come to convince his men to seek amnesty under a new law.

Lips That Linger
Anyone who watches late-night television has probably seen it, the commercial for Lasting Kiss, which goes something like this: Put it on.
Eat.
Work out.
Eat.
Go to the office.
Eat.
Sleep with your man.
Eat.
Repeat the cycle.
And guess what?
Your lipstick lasts until you take it off.
You can kiss those lipsticks stains good-bye!
Lasting Kiss, which comes with a "sealer" that smells like shellac, and a "lip cleanser," that looks like Windex, is perhaps an extreme response to a universal urge.
Ever since Cleopatra first colored her lips with orange henna, women have employed all sorts of trickery to make that potent emblem of desire -- their lipstick -- last.


Trolling Turkey Bones for Summer Stripers in the Sound
The sunset's last rosy traces were fading as Ike Wirgin and I dropped our strange presentations into the boat's wake.
This was my first attempt at using a turkey bone rig -- an offering that Ike swore was the ultimate in reliability for catching striped bass during summer in Long Island Sound.
Turkey bone rigs are named after their principal feature -- a short piece of white plastic piping that bears just enough resemblance to a small bone to warrant the label.
The single hook that runs through the tube is normally baited with one or more sandworms; when trolled through the water, a worm-laden turkey bone rig reminds me more of a rocket ship trailing smoke tendrils than any known sea creature.
We were fishing the Scotch Caps, a small chain of bedrock islands that juts out of the coastline off Rye, N.Y.
These features are typical of the north shore of Long Island Sound, which is made up of a mosaic of small harbors, points, islands and submerged reefs.
It is this abundance of structure and resultant tide rips that draw striped bass to these shallows, and over most of this century the quiet trolling of sandworms in only a few feet of water remained the traditional approach to catching them.

Dimwitted or Downright Witty?
To the Editor:
I always enjoy the Book Review and appreciate the selection of books and reviewers.
What I really enjoy, though, are those Sundays when you juxtapose books and writers in ways I would never have imagined -- for example, Michael Lewis reviewing the latest books by Ross Perot and Lewis Lapham.
I laughed out loud.  PHYLLIS GUEST  Dallas


The Disappearing $2,000 Book
ONCE upon a time storytellers perpetuated the tales of the tribe by memorizing them.
With the invention of books, memory became less important: if you forgot something, you could look it up.
Then came the computer; to access its electronic memory, all you had to remember was which key to press.
Now this evolution has come full circle with a story-on-a-disk that destroys itself as you read it, leaving nothing but the memory of words glimpsed briefly on a computer screen.
The author of the self-sabotaging story is William Gibson, whose 1984 novel "Neuromancer" gave birth to the terms "cyberpunk" and "cyberspace." Cyberpunk is science fiction with an attitude; it imagines a future in which people use the latest technology to do nasty things to one another.
Mr.
Gibson's characters, who spend the better part of their lives literally plugged into supercomputers, experience electronic data-flow as sensory input; they live in a "consensual hallucination" that Mr.
Gibson has dubbed cyberspace.

About the Energy Tax
To the Editor:
David Morris and Michael Lewis argued themselves right out of their position in "The Energy Tax: Its Time Will Come" (Viewpoints, Aug. 15).
They chose not to notice that their tax on "bads" is also a tax on what everyone cannot do without: heat, air-conditioning and the power to run the businesses for which they work.
If they are the bads, I wonder what are the "goods"?


POSTINGS: Andy Warhol's 'Factory'; The Foundation's Moving
It was Aug. 17, 1981, and Andy Warhol was in the real estate market.
That day, he looked over a former Con Ed substation, a T-shaped structure with entrances on Madison Avenue, 32d and 33d Streets.
These were his thoughts, as recorded in "The Andy Warhol Diaries," edited by Pat Hackett (Warner Books, 1989): "It's a beautiful building, but buying it would be like buying a beautiful piece of art, this beautiful space. And it has a main big T-shaped room that could be a great Interview office, but you can't rent anything out. It goes up five floors and there's no heat, it's just like one shell, but it's so perfectly beautiful. I could put in hot air and toilets and it would be an artist's space."
Mr.
Warhol bought the building later that year and it became his fourth, and final, Factory.
"The purpose of this space was to put under one roof all of his various endeavors," recalled Vincent Fremont, a longtime associate.
Mr.
Warhol's painting studio had its entrance at 22 East 33d Street; his television studio at 158 Madison Avenue and his magazine, Interview, at 19 East 32d Street.


Rage Has Its Own Rules in South Africa
HER friends and parents say Amy Biehl would have been embarrassed by the attention drawn to her chilling murder last week in a black township near Cape Town.
Why, she would probably have asked, should the death of one white woman somehow outweigh the black lives ended daily in killings equally pointless and brutal?
But for Americans, those watching South Africa casually from afar and the thousands who live here, the death of the 26-year-old Californian was jarring, not just because she was American, vivacious and good-hearted, but also because she had devoted herself to relieving the misery of the very mob that chased her down and stabbed her to death.


FIGHT SLEEPISM. NAP NOW!
Though James Gorman doesn't mention it, the picture accompanying his article shows one of the great aids to napping -- a cat.
Cats serve as superb examples by napping at the drop of a hat.
When they nap in your lap, as in the photograph, the invitation to doze with them is irresistible.
Their purring soothes the ear and their touch warms the hand.
Maybe it's the sleep researchers to whom President Clinton is paying attention, but maybe it's to Socks.

Curse of Silverman And Luck of Lipsitz
THERE are many theories about why the nine of diamonds is popularly known as the Curse of Scotland.
Is it, perhaps, connected with an early card game -- either Pope Joan, in which the nine of diamonds was the Pope, or Cornette, brought by Mary Queen of Scots and featuring that card?
Were the orders for a Scottish disaster written upon it -- Flodden Field, or the Massacre of Glencoe?
Or is it derived from the nine lozenges on the arms of the Earl of Stair, much loathed in Scotland for his connection with Glencoe and the union with England?
But there is no doubt at all about why the eight of diamonds is known as the Curse of Silverman.
A year ago that card cost Neil Silverman and his team a victory in the Spingold Knockout Teams.
He was playing in seven diamonds, with a trump suit of K-7-6-3-2 opposite dummy's A-Q-10-9.
Impulsively and needlessly, he ruffed an opening heart lead in dummy and found that his right-hand opponent held J-8-5-4.
The lack of the eight in his hand doomed the grand slam.


Why Chide Clinton or the Vineyard for His Vacationing There?; Helped Local Hospital

'What a Dump!'
To the Editor:
In his essay "Bartlett Updated: Renewing the Idea of a Shared Culture" (Aug. 8), James Gleick admits to being thrilled by Lenore Coffee's line "What a dump!," spoken on screen by Bette Davis in "Beyond the Forest" (1949).
He might be surprised to know that the line was spoken on screen 17 years earlier by Anita Page in "Night Court." And she delivered the line in an even more deadpan fashion than Davis did.

SURFACING
THE SUPERNATURAL -- Bat Boy (again): The Weekly World News first screamed about him last summer when he was "discovered" in a cave in West Virginia.

FIRE ISLAND
In the Aug. 1 Letters column, a reader finds homophobic offense in the designation "adopted son and lover" in the article "Castles in the Sand" (July 11).
What the letter writer chooses to interpret as sleazy or sexual is in reality a way of circumventing the inequality built into the inheritance laws.
Unmarried lovers have no standing in surrogate court, but "adopted" children automatically obtain inheritance rights.

Baseball Confidential: Piercing Waiver Wire's Code of Silence
Baseball's waiver rules are only slightly better understood than the plans for the design and operation of the $1 billion Mars Observer spacecraft.
The waiver system burst into characteristic confusion the other day when the Atlanta Braves tried to acquire Dennis Martinez from the Montreal Expos.
The Braves failed to get the veteran pitcher, but they succeeded in preventing the San Francisco Giants from getting him.
And that, after all, was the Braves' No. 1 reason for putting in a claim when the Expos placed Martinez's name on the waiver wire.


King's Speech Commemerated by Thousands
The Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. was remembered today by tens of thousands of marchers who braved the grueling August heat to commemorate the day 30 years ago when "I have a dream" entered the nation's consciousness.
They gathered round the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, where the minister from Georgia had sketched his vision of a truly integrated democracy and helped lay the groundwork for the civil rights laws of the 1960's.
Marching under the banner of "Jobs, Justice and Peace," this was a varied crowd, ranging from veterans of the movement, like Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King, to leaders of organized labor, feminists and other causes that seek to capture the movement's spirit.


Bhutan Offering Tours This Fall
Several tours of Bhutan, the reclusive independent kingdom in the Himalayas, are being offered this fall.
With a population of under a million, Bhutan, which borders India and Tibet, has laws limiting tourism in order to preserve its culture and natural resources.
Bhutan Travel, a private company based in New York, is offering two walking tours of Bhutan, a two-week trip starting Oct. 21 and a three-week trip starting Nov. 1.
Both itineraries include several day hikes and overnight camping trips to monasteries and villages in the Paro and Thimphu valleys in western Bhutan and the Bumthang valley in central Bhutan, including one to the Tiger's Nest, a monastery built into the side of a cliff at 10,000 feet.
According to legend, the Buddhist teachings were brought to Bhutan by Guru Rinpoche, patron saint of Bhutan, who transported them on the back of a flying tiger.
On the shorter tour, visitors will go to the Jambe festival commemorating Guru Rinpoche in Bumthang where they will see Buddhist myths re-enacted by dancers in silk costumes and masks.


New Jersey Men Held in Beating of a Greenwich Village Couple
Three New Jersey men driving in Greenwich Village early yesterday jumped from their car and hit two men with golf clubs while shouting anti-gay remarks, the police said.
The police said they were investigating the attack as a possible bias incident.
The two victims, who were treated at a local hospital and later released, were holding hands when they were attacked, the police said.


Warsaw Ghetto

An Epiphany in Jogjakarta's Airport
LONG trips.
I crave long trips.
Not just long distances, far-flung destinations, but trips that go on for more than a couple of weeks.
Trips in which traveling is not just a brief escape from your real life, but actually becomes your way of life.
Understand, I am not talking about living abroad for the academic year, a perfectly pleasant tradition, and a familiar one to an anthropologist's daughter like me.
I am talking about a peculiar hybrid of "On the Road" and "Across Asia on the Cheap," the famous Lonely Planet yellow bible that pointed hip young travelers in the 1970's to the right crash pads in Istanbul, Teheran, Kabul and, above all, Katmandu.
Long trips, long periods of time in motion, a speck crawling in an eccentric path around the globe, that intoxicating sense of no one knows exactly where I am, the salutary dislocation that comes from months of one new temporary resting place after another, the educational perspective of the wanderer, the journeyer, the voyager.
It is a travel ideology that celebrates the rucksack, the backpack, the sleeping bag.
When I was 18 years old, I more or less saw the world that way.
It was the almost statutory 70's Year Off From College in Europe With Boyfriend.
We slept in tollbooths (well, once), hitchhiked our way across Iran (we were idiots), carried only what would fit in our backpacks (the world's largest portable collection of battered paperbacks -- just ask me about the time we threw away our camp stove to make room for a three-volume history of France).


On Sunday; In Crown Hts., A Dinkins Man In the Trenches
MAYOR David N. Dinkins does indeed have a re-election headquarters in Crown Heights, scene of his most bare-knuckled battle to survive in office.
It is a Spartan storefront a few blocks from the Hasidim's powerhouse heart on Eastern Parkway, where believers have festooned apartments and businesses with countless banners of Messianic, not mayoral, hopes.
"I'm conceding nothing here," says Mark S. Pendarvis, the Brooklyn campaign manager for Mr.
Dinkins, who works out of this small shop, just across the wide parkway and down Kingston Avenue from the Hasidim.


In the Italian Style, Old and New
IF Waterbury's downtown revival centered solely on Diorio Restaurant and Bar, it would be a sure thing.
The new restaurant is doing so much that's right, one hopes it may be a harbinger of happier days ahead for the Brass City.
Diorio is in the sturdy 1884 red brick Griggs Building, carefully restored inside and out.
Inside, we momentarily felt we had entered a time warp: the long bar with 13 bentwood stools along it, backed by a bar-wide mirror (with etched and gilded renderings of 13 landmark local buildings), an old-fashioned tiled floor, polished wood wainscoting, a pressed-tin ceiling and roomy wooden booths all evoked an earlier era.
In point of fact, the space has been host to various restaurants since the 1930's.
Left of the barroom is a smaller, airier dining room also with paneled wood wainscoting, palms and the same tiled floor (plus a third room for parties) that seems more in keeping with Diorio's modern Italian menu.


First Look at the Orchestral Season
THE orchestral season in Connecticut does not hit its stride for well over a month but since early subscribers get better seats, higher discounts and other benefits, it is not too early to look at the season.
Opening on Oct. 2 are the Greenwich, Norwalk and Waterbury symphonies, the Norwalk beginning first, at 8 P.M. in the Concert Hall.
Following the trend toward thematic programming, the group's music director, Jesse Levine, has dubbed the season "Around the World," and the first of the four subscription pairs "The Grand Tour" since its composers represent Germany, Italy and France.

Bears' Dent Crosses Many Lines for Chicago
Five blocks west of the 94 freeway on the South Side at 60th and Green Streets sits a tired old building with barred doors, broken windows and shattered dreams.
It is the old Englewood Hospital, built in 1905.
For the last 10 years, it has sat and wilted.
It represents much of the Englewood neighborhood, one of the roughest and toughest and poorest in this city.
Few outsiders cross the line into this bleak neighborhood.


In the Region: Connecticut; Fairfield's Large-Space Market Revives
FOR the first time in more than three years companies from Manhattan, Westchester and Connecticut are looking for large blocks of office space in Fairfield County.
To meet the demand, office buildings that had been constructed as corporate headquarters but have been mostly vacant in recent years are shedding their white elephant skins and entering the competition.


Desired


Cars in Europe
To the Editor: In discussing European car renting ("Figuring the Cost of Car Rentals in Europe," May 9), one cost not mentioned arises when the rental agency insists on a deposit in lieu of a collision damage waiver that is refused.
In 1991 we reserved a car through Auto Europe in Camden, Me., using a gold Mastercard, which provides coverage for collision damage.
When we picked up the vehicle from Kenning Car and Van Rental in London, using the same card, we declined the C.D.W., whereupon the agency insisted on a deposit of $2,700 to be credited on return of the vehicle.


For Those Who Read Before They Dig
THERE is a familiar phrase, "Look it up." Every school child soon learns this command whether it comes from a teacher or a parent.
Gardeners have to look it up, too, and they usually have a stack of reference books handy.
If not, answers are often difficult to find.
The easiest way to solve this problem is to own a sturdy garden library.
A few general reference books will prove their merit over time.
Several books may be out of print and either the library or a second-hand bookstore would be possible sources.


A Second Shot at Summer
The sun sets earlier.
The lawn is a lost cause.
That giant-sized bag of charcoal briquettes you thought you'd never see the bottom of is almost empty.
The tube of sun block, all but gone.
Some 200 miles from New York, a relaxed man -- the President -- steps onto a golf course, shanks his first shot into the trees and asks for the one thing so many of us long for at this time of year:


Brazilian Justice and the Culture of Impunity
ACCORDING to Brazilian legend, a 16th-century Portuguese bishop coined a novel recruiting pitch to lure skeptical colonists to settle in faraway Brazil.
Addressing his devout flock, the cleric decreed: "No sin exists south of the equator."
Almost five centuries later, modern Brazil at times seems to have incorporated this motto as its moral cornerstone.


In Fields Where Sculpture Holds Sway
WITH his spectacles, wristwatch and ruddy complexion, Elizabeth Hill's "Scribe" seems more American than Asian.
Yet he sits on his green and white cushion with a border of blue lotuses, radiating a serenity that is both un-Western and slightly humorous.
The 27-inch figure is set on a pedestal at eye level under a maple tree and, were it not for the bronze medium and the skillful modeling, it could be folk art in some Indian village shrine.
In fact, "Scribe" reposes in the shrine here known as the Kouros Sculpture Center, where it rates as one of the more memorable pieces.
It is also symptomatic of a trend toward smaller works, although that is not immediately apparent.
Visitors enter the park -- which is also the country branch of the Kouros Gallery in Manhattan -- to find themselves on a trail leading up to the house through a field.
Previously, Daniel Wurtzel's V-shaped trough of wood, supported by a pair of granite boulders, was the dominant work in the space.
But now the 19-foot structure has been upstaged by a black rectangular form roughly 10 1/2 feet long, 14 1/2 feet wide and 6 1/2 feet high.


ISRAELI REPORTS AGREEMENT TOWARD PALESTINIAN RULE IN GAZA STRIP AND JERICHO
Israeli and Palestinian leaders have agreed in principle during secret talks that the Palestinians will gain authority over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho as a first step toward self-rule across the Israeli-occupied territories, a senior Israeli official said today.
The official's remarks were the clearest Israeli statement thus far that the two sides had quietly reached basic understandings that are to be fleshed out in the next round of Middle East peace talks, which is to begin in Washington on Tuesday.


The U.S. Open: It's Not the Grandest, but the Gaudiest
On the eve of the 25th United States Open tennis championships, Arthur Ashe is being honored at the National Tennis Center today and again tonight with a benefit for the Safe Passage Foundation.
As the Open's first men's singles champion, Ashe established the spirit that has carried this tournament from the clubby confines in Forest Hills to the corporate carnival in Flushing Meadows.
Like it or loathe it, the Open dances to its own music as a sports event.
It plays day, night and weekends, and is a survival test for players, officials, fans and, yes, even the news media.


Michelle Sagalyn, C. C. Pederson
Michelle Anne Sagalyn, a daughter of Avital Sagalyn of Amherst, Mass., and the late Robert Sagalyn, was married yesterday to Christopher Cameron Pederson, the son of Dona Pederson of Livingston, N.Y., and the late Kenneth G. Pederson.
Ellen Davidson, a justice of the peace in Amherst, officiated at the home of the bride's mother.
Mrs.
Sagalyn Pederson, 37, is a director of audiotex and new media services at United Media, a newspaper syndication company in New York.
She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College.
Her father, a former theatrical producer and actor, was the president of the Industrial Buildings Corporation, a real estate management company in Chicopee, Mass.
Her mother is a painter.


NOTES
Melissa Etheridge, the rock singer, will premiere a song from her forthcoming album, "Yes I Am," next Saturday on "In A New Light '93," a two-hour ABC special about AIDS.
The song, "Silent Legacy," while not about AIDS, discusses societal difficulties in dealing with sexuality.
It was inspired by the story of a 14-year-old girl.
"This fella -- I didn't know him too well -- was telling me that he caught his daughter in bed with somebody and kicked her out of the house," Ms.
Etheridge said.
"I was just overwhelmed with the way that we handle sexuality today. It's bad."
The special, with Paula Abdul and Arsenio Hall as hosts, will also feature appearances by Elizabeth Taylor, Elton John, Cindy Crawford and Lily Tomlin.
ABC is donating its commercial proceeds to Diffa, the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS.


Close Up the Summer House With a Plan
VACATING a summer home can be less hectic if a closing strategy is mapped.
The goals should be to secure the house against the elements, prevent indoor damage from pests, dampness and poor air circulation and minimize the likelihood of break-ins.
Outdoor tasks can usually be carried out well ahead of time.
They consist mostly of ordinary chores like painting, repairing siding and mending window screens, but make a point of examining the roof and chimney for damage and give priority to fixing those if time grows short.

Reva Clamage Shwayder, an artist who was the subject of a documentary film that won an Academy Award, died Thursday at her home in Franklin, Mich.
She was 91.
The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.


Health Planners at White House Consider Lid on Medicare Costs
Less than a month before President Clinton is to unveil his proposal for a national health insurance program, disputes have broken out among Administration officials over how to finance it and how tightly to limit overall health spending.
Officials said that the White House, seeking to avoid new taxes, was seriously considering a proposal to squeeze more than $100 billion of additional savings from Medicare, the Federal health program for the elderly, by holding down increases in the program through the year 2000.
The savings, along with a possible increase in the tax on cigarettes, would help pay for Mr.
Clinton's promise of guaranteed coverage for all Americans.


Television; For CBS, David Letterman's premiere is more than 'event TV.' It's the key to life after prime time.
THE decision by CBS to invest more than $100 million over three years to build a late-night franchise around David Letterman is being called an astute, bold move that has already paid off in excitement and attention, and is almost certain to pay off in profits.
"I think they surely have a success on their hands," said William Croasdale, who runs the network department of Western International Media Inc., a media buying service.
"It looks like it's already worth the investment for them."


To Reeves, A Little Success Isn't Enough
The laugh came instantly, as if someone had told him one of the funniest jokes he had ever heard.
Tom Landry simply had been asked about the competitive nature of his good friend, Giants Coach Dan Reeves, and you would have thought the Hall of Fame coach was being tickled to death.
"Boy, oh boy, competitive? Dan?" Chuckle.
"I can't tell you what it was like having him around, probably the most competitive guy I know." More chuckling.
"First of all, he's a great person, but, boy, oh boy. You don't ever want to go against Dan in a game of golf. No way. He'll try to beat your pants off."


Skate Like a Duck, Quack Like a Duck, Market Like Disney
First came the film, which grossed $50 million.

Yankees Pitch Softly and Carry a Big Stick
Every time Cleveland's Carlos Baerga stepped to the plate this weekend, the speakers blared out a little rock 'n' roll ditty called "Too Legit to Quit," by Hammer.
Maybe, just maybe, the Yankees' hitters took a hint.

Elle Tries to Broaden Its Appeal
Once the darling of the fashion industry, Elle magazine has suffered the trauma of the trendy moment: judging by advertising pages and newsstand sales, Elle has apparently lost some of its panache.
Now, with its September issue, it is trying to regain ground.
The issue will be the first for the new editorial director, Amy Gross, who was hired from Mirabella in March to give Elle, the flagship of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, a broader range of features.


Anna M. Moleski, Craig M. Cohen

Cohen graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology.
She is a daughter of Wendy Moleski and Jesse Moleski, both of Syracuse.


Good Victory, but Still a Bad Taste for Trainer
Bill Robinson, the trainer of Presidential Ball, is not upset that his 3-year-old superstar colt must now take a back seat to his stablemate, Riyadh, who went wire to wire to win the $432,800 Cane Pace in record-setting time at Yonkers on Saturday night.
What really has Robinson upset is the fact that Presidential Ball, who finished second, as well as his chief rival, Life Sign, who finished third, had a back seat to Riyadh even before the race began.

Dr. Murray Luck, 93, Expert on Population
Dr.

He was 93.
The cause was cardiac failure, his family said.


BBDO Is Awarded Chrysler Neon Job
The Chrysler Corporation has selected the Southfield, Mich., office of BBDO Worldwide to handle the national creative portion of the assignment to introduce its Neon subcompact car, due in January as a 1995 model.
Billings were not disclosed.
Chrysler is, however, expected to spend more to introduce Neon than the estimated $30 million to $40 million it will spend on a BBDO campaign for the 1994 Dodge Ram full-size pickup truck.
The decision about the Neon on Friday came after a creative shootout that pitted BBDO, which handles Chrysler's Dodge car and truck account, against Bozell Inc. in Southfield, which handles three assignments: the Chrysler corporate account, the Chrysler-Plymouth division and advertising for the company's mini-vans.


Auto Union Set to Aim at One of Big Three
Douglas A. Fraser, the former president of the United Automobile Workers, vividly remembers the moment his union discovered it could no longer squeeze more money and benefits out of the nation's auto makers by playing one off another during contract negotiations.
It was 1958, and the auto makers were presenting their three-year contract proposals to the union in different locations at the same time.


Machine Tool Orders Down for July
The machine tool industry learned again last month that what Detroit giveth, it can also taketh away.
Machine tool orders slid for the third straight month in July as large automotive orders continued to level off, the Association for Manufacturing Technology reported yesterday.


Tirozzi's Skills Fit Needs Of Schools, Backers Say
In Gerald N. Tirozzi's eight years as Connecticut Commissioner of Education, a gallery of framed news articles grew on his office wall.
Most chronicled his successful reforms: tougher curriculums, higher salaries and standards for teachers, innovative multicultural programs and more money and even national recognition for the state's public school system.
During his tenure from 1983 to 1991, state education spending rose to $1.3 billion from $685 million; teachers' salaries became the highest in the nation; universal tests measuring student proficiency in math, writing and other areas were established, and Dr.
Tirozzi seemed ubiquitous, meeting with parents and teachers, legislators and local school boards, seeking consensus and money.

Essay; The U.N. Entraps Clinton
More than 10,000 American troops, drawn mainly from the First Armored Division in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, were on the verge of being sent as part of a NATO force to Bosnia to impose the wrong peace in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Had the Bosnian Muslims bowed to Western pressure to accept the latest surrender terms proposed by the U.N. -- a humiliation that Bosnia's Parliament unanimously rejected over the weekend -- American forces would have become guarantors of a Munich-style sellout that would have created a gulag of ghettos and encouraged future ethnic cleansing.


Nina Hoffman, Howard Blatt
Nina Hoffman, a publisher, was married yesterday to Howard Blatt, a reporter.
Both work in New York.
Rabbi Paul Brickman officiated at the Water's Edge restaurant in Long Island City, Queens.
Ms.
Hoffman, who is 40, is keeping her name.
She is the president and publisher of Prentice Hall General Reference, a division of Paramount Consumer Publishing.
She graduated from the State University at New Paltz.
Ms.
Hoffman is the daughter of the late Milton and Minnie Hoffman.


Bond Reporting Rules Take Shape
The spotlight is more intense than it has been in years on the workings and weaknesses of the municipal bond market.
And as the end of the August Congressional recess nears, an outline is emerging of what might be done to curb political contributions and increase financial disclosure.
It appears that the new rules on reporting might reduce the flow of political contributions to mayors, treasurers, comptrollers and other officials who choose the underwriters who can make millions of dollars in fees from the sale of the tax-exempt bonds.


Marriage Imposes Special Burdens on Marines
To the Editor:
As a chaplain who has dealt for years with military marriage problems, and as one of those "officers sitting in front of word processors in the Pentagon" involved in efforts to improve the quality of married and family life in the Marine Corps, I take strong exception to "Marine Madness" (editorial, Aug. 13).


Market Place; A hot technology stock gets hotter after a court ruling.
WHO said television is boring?
Not the people at Broadband Technologies Inc., a small company in North Carolina that hopes to be a big player in bringing the much-touted "information superhighway" to the home.
Based in Durham, Broadband went public on June 30 at $18 a share and its stock has been hot, hot, hot ever since.
After topping $34 a share on Tuesday, the shares climbed above $42, closing on Friday at $41.50.


Dinkins Assails Board Members
Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday denounced the plans of a four-member majority on the Board of Education to support Ramon C. Cortines for Schools Chancellor, calling it a "pure political power play." The Mayor reiterated his support for Gerald N. Tirozzi, the former State Education Commissioner in Connecticut.
Mr.
Dinkins, in an interview after an appearance in the First Baptist Church in Far Rockaway, Queens, said the decision of four of the seven members of the board to support Mr.
Cortines, a former school superintendent in San Francisco, was based on a desire "to be opposite Dinkins."


Showalter Lets 4 Pitchers Know Just Where They Stand
Scott Kamieniecki is back.
Sterling Hitchcock is in.
Domingo Jean is out.
Melido Perez is barely in.
In his state of the starting rotation before a 14-8 victory today over the Indians, Manager Buck Showalter disclosed his plans for these four pitchers.
Since Hitchcock pitched superbly in a 4-0 victory over the Indians on Friday and because Chicago is vulnerable to left-handers, the rookie will oppose the White Sox Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.


Elizabeth Barnett, M. A. Batterman
Elizabeth Ann Barnett, a daughter of Bert and Carol Barnett of Memphis, was married yesterday to Michael Andrew Batterman, the son of L. Robert Batterman of New York and Nancy Batterman of New Rochelle, N.Y.
Rabbi Harry Danziger officiated at Temple Israel of Memphis.
Ms.
Barnett is keeping her name.
She and her husband graduated from Dartmouth College.
She is a candidate for a master's degree in art history at the University of Chicago.


A Different Sort of Quiet on the Set With Andrew Bergman in Charge
In a hastily constructed fake coffee shop in TriBeCa, Bridget Fonda and Nicolas Cage are busy doing what movie people call "meeting cute." He's a cop, she's a waitress.
He's a kidder, she's had a bad day.
He's giving her his "A" material, asking for venison, then lobster thermidor, with a poker face.
She's not laughing.
It's a pivotal scene in "Cop Gives Waitress $2 Million Tip," a souffle of a moment, easy to get wrong, and Andrew Bergman, the director, is clearly feeling the pressure as he bends over to talk to his producer, Mike Lobell, between takes.
Mr.
Bergman's brow is knit, his voice hushed and worried.


Trammell Crow, Alive but Humbled
Once the country's top real estate developer, a $15 billion empire with scores of partners who shared in the ownership of hundreds of buildings, the Trammell Crow Company has shrunk and split into two parts: a company that manages properties for others with a paltry $19 million in profits last year and a separate private corporation that owns $5.5 billion in assets.
In just four years, two-thirds of the 180 partners lost their ownership interests in all buildings, and about that many left the company.
In the same period, the company's work force was cut to 2,400 from 3,500.
About 20 of the 90 offices nationwide were closed.


U.S. Tries to Restore the Once-Friendly Skies
German and United States officials will meet today in Bonn to begin talks that they hope will salvage their threatened aviation agreement.
This is the first of many tests in coming months for the Clinton Administration as it contends with a growing list of countries that believe American airlines carry more than their fair share of international traffic.
It is widely believed that the outcome of the talks will set a precedent for those with other countries -- including Japan, France and Australia -- that have signaled a desire to slow the rapid expansion overseas by United States airlines like American, Delta, United and Northwest.


Yankee Stadium Needs Satellite Parking Lot With a Shuttle Bus
To the Editor:
A Yankee fan coming from New York City's northern suburbs or New Jersey faces a difficult time driving to and parking at Yankee Stadium, worse now that attendance is up.
No matter where in the city the stadium might relocate, highway overload would persist as a problem.


Bosnia Aides Ask U.S. Guarantee As Peace Talks Are Set to Resume
As Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim negotiators prepared to resume peace talks in Geneva on Monday, the leaders of Bosnia's Parliament called today on the United States and NATO to enforce any peace agreement that might come from the negotiations.
Late Saturday, the mostly Muslim Bosnian Parliament rejected the latest United Nations peace proposal, which calls for reorganizing this country into a loose union of three ethnic republics.
They said the plan would legitimize the takeover of more than half of Bosnia's territory by the nationalist Serbs' militia.

Patents; A blood cell therapy is designed to act as a decoy to lure HIV away from the immune cells it kills.
MEDICAL researchers around the world are racing to develop new treatments for AIDS, hoping to find a cure or vaccine.
Yet an antidote to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is probably years away, and may come as a combination of medications rather than a single remedy.
One technique could be a new red blood cell therapy patented this month by Sheffield Medical Technologies Inc.
Based on work done at the Harvard Center for Blood Research by Dr.
Yves-Claude Nicolau, the invention inserts a protein called CD4 into red blood cells to lure HIV away from the human immune cells that it kills.


Sukhumi Journal; War Makes a Ghastly Visit to a Black Sea Resort
Until 1988, the last year this resort city had anything like a tourist season, Sukhumi was known as one of the most beautiful spots on the Black Sea coast, with seaside hotels and cafes, palm trees, oleander bushes and turn-of-the-century buildings that gave it a faint hint of elegance.
Now, Sukhumi -- the prize in an ugly, yearlong war between Georgia and the breakaway region of Abkhazia -- is a city half in ruins, whose few remaining residents joke bitterly about renting their houses out as sets for war movies.
Bone-thin dogs sniff around the blackened rubble, and old men in their pajamas sit in the shade outside their gutted apartments, sharing a smoke with younger menwho have Kalashnikov rifles slung over their shoulders.


Corrections
A review in Weekend on Friday about "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and other productions by Shakespeare and Company in Lenox, Mass., referred incorrectly to a playwright who adapted short stories by Edith Wharton for the troupe.
She is Sharon Werner, not Weaver.


Boomer Surfers; Back to the Waves of Youth
Two years ago on a brisk spring day, when the water off Montauk was roughly 38 degrees, Roger Feit was pursuing his life's obsession: he was surfing with a friend in turbulent conditions that Mr.
Feit described as "not makable."
The first wave he caught provided no ride, collapsed on top of him, spun him around like a top, drilled him into the sand and then pinned him there.
Ice-cold water coursed beneath his wet suit, and he wondered if he was going to drown.

2 Wieden Ex-Clients Select New Agencies
Two former clients of Wieden &amp; Kennedy have disclosed their plans for replacement agencies.
Jockey International Inc. said it had selected Fairman, Schmidt &amp; Cappelli in Chicago to handle its national account.
The announcement on Friday came two weeks after Jockey and Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., ended a two-month relationship because they could not agree on the financial terms for handling the account, previously handled in-house.

Laura Zinn, Stephen Fromm
Laura Jeanne Zinn, the daughter of Ruthi G. Zinn of Short Hills, N.J., and Dr.
Stephen A. Zinn of Warren, N.J., was married yesterday to Stephen Arthur Fromm, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Eli Fromm of Broomall, Pa.
Rabbi Carole Balin officiated at the Highlawn Pavilion in West Orange, N.J.
The bride, 28, is an editor at Business Week magazine in New York.
She graduated from Wellesley College.
Her father is a neuroradiologist in Union, N.J.
Her mother is the president of Zinn Graves &amp; Field, a public relations firm in Florham, N.J.


The Book on Agassi Now Has Tennis Plot
Why is Andre Agassi chock-full of commitment toward winning the United States Open, which gets under way today and represents his final chance to capture a Grand Slam tournament in 1993?
For starters, his reputation depends on it.
This hot dog has, he swears, turned into a devoted dog.
He's never been one to take a page from anyone else's book, but just last week, upon hearing Jim Courier link his return to the No. 1 ranking to his decision to again make tennis "the essence of his life," the quipster from Las Vegas experienced the thrill of recognition.


Dawn Steel Muses From the Top of Hollywood's Heap
Although Dawn Steel insists that she's "an ordinary middle-class girl from New York," it doesn't seem quite that simple.
One of the few women to climb to the highest ranks in Hollywood, she lives in a hilltop home with startling views of Los Angeles; she's a fixture in the town's top tier; her bank account is decidedly un-middle class, and her rise and fall and rise are hardly an ordinary tale.
"Yes, I see it as a fairy tale, but not a glamorous fairy tale because of the enormous amount of hard work, persistence and perseverence," said Ms.
Steel who is now an independent producer and whose first film, "Cool Runnings," is to be released in October.
The perseverance is perhaps the central theme of Ms.
Steel's autobiography, "They Can Kill You . . . but They Can't Eat You: Lessons From the Front." To be published next month by Pocket Books, the book is not a slash-and-burn Hollywood expose that's going to keep her from eating lunch in this town again.
It has some personal gossip (before her marriage, she had affairs with Richard Gere and Martin Scorsese) and plenty of celebrity names.


A Young Perspective on Management
When Alan Webber and William Taylor were editors at the widely respected but staid Harvard Business Review, they thought of the publication as the "bran muffin of magazines: good for you but hard to swallow."
So Mr.
Webber, 44, and Mr.
Taylor, 34, decided to create a new business magazine that would combine the managerial insights of the Harvard publication with the writing and jazzy graphics of Rolling Stone.


Critic's Notebook; What's Newsworthy Is in the Eye of the Beholder
The latest altercation between "Dateline" and an object of its unwanted attentions is not likely to cause NBC the sort of embarrassment it suffered early this year when it had to apologize to General Motors for certain explosive tricks of the expose trade.
But the current dispute with a North Carolina eye clinic, which is suing the network and Brian Ross, a "Dateline" reporter, for $6 million, will not enhance the shine of NBC News.
The complaint this time is over a few minutes of a "Dateline" report shown on May 4.
"Cataract Cowboys" began by putting viewers on notice that "authorities believe some doctors are cashing in no matter how the eyes check out," that is, unnecessary surgery is being committed on unsuspecting patients.
The theme of the report was established by the case of a multi-millionaire ophthalmologist in California whose license has been suspended and who is being investigated for Medicare fraud.


More Sought After Raid On Smugglers
In the final thrust of a major strike against Asian organized crime, law-enforcement authorities said last night that they were searching for six more associates of a powerful gang leader arrested in Hong Kong on Friday who was deeply involved in smuggling Chinese immigrants into the United States.
The sweep has already netted 19 suspects, 6 of whom were arrested during a burial ceremony on Saturday at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn and 5 of whom were already in prison on other charges.
The raids followed the Hong Kong arrest of Guo Liang Chi, the reputed leader of the Fuk Ching gang, whom one law-enforcement official referred to as "the crown jewel in this operation."


Abbott Gets Shelled, but Yanks Shock Indians
It was still early in the afternoon and the Yankees had seen their third straight starter depart before the sixth inning ended.
A third straight setback to the Indians loomed.
Another rout was happening at Cleveland Stadium.
It was another day to wonder whether the Yankees are serious about this pennant chase.
But before the day ended, and before the Indians could complete their choke hold, the Yankees answered the pennant question robustly.
Stuck in a 7-2 ditch after Jim Abbott allowed eight hits in three innings, the Yankees climbed out of their precarious position with a blizzard of hits, a flake of good fortune on a controversial call and 12 timely runs to snatch an improbable 14-8 victory.
They may have to win games in September with their offense, but they definitely are serious about winning.

Religious Leaders Hold A 2d World Parliament
With two hours of invocations and blessings that should have roused the heavens -- or possibly created stupor there -- religious leaders from every corner of the globe and virtually every imaginable faith opened a once-in-a-century Parliament of the World's Religions this weekend.
On Saturday, Buddhist monks, Hindu swamis and Muslim imams, along with Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Bahais, Theosophists and goddess worshipers, joined more familiar religious figures like Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Chicago, to begin eight days of prayer, meditation and dialogue with 6,000 participants at the Palmer House Hilton Hotel.


Zimbabwe Whites Find The Good Life Is in Peril
When they sip their whiskies in the Harare Club and count the blessings that have made them the envy of Africa's settlers, the whites of Zimbabwe consider among their assets not only the banks and tobacco plantations, the servants and swimming pools, the polo ponies and boating weekends on Lake Kariba, but also the good opinion of men like Trevor Ncube.
For it is an essential part of the Zimbabwe mystique that 13 years after independence blacks here not only tolerate white wealth, but they also accept the white man, treasure his expertise and defer to his European values.


Fate of a Virus -- A special report.; Scientists Debate Destroying The Last Strains of Smallpox
The execution of one of the biggest killers in history, the smallpox virus, is being planned for the end of this year.
The virus's death sentence comes 13 years after the World Health Organization declared that it had eradicated smallpox, a disease that killed, blinded and disfigured uncounted millions of people.
The organization's global vaccination campaign broke the chain of person-to-person transmission of the disease, which occurred only in humans.


Reporter's Notebook; Working Hard at Relaxing, Clinton Hates to Quit
President Clinton finally tore himself away from his island vacation today, returning to Washington from what has certainly been his most restful, consistently trouble-free week in nearly two years.
There is a distinct possibility that the problems that await him, which include the unveiling of a long-awaited health care plan and a potential Congressional revolt over the free trade agreement he has championed, could wipe away the residual benefits of his 11 days off.


Yankee Stadium Needs Satellite Parking Lot With a Shuttle Bus; The Train to the Game
To the Editor:
Much of the discussion of whether or not to move the Yankees from the Bronx has focused on the assertion by the team owner, George Steinbrenner (and others), that parking and security for drivers and autos are inadequate at Yankee Stadium.


Decision Is Near For Schools Chief
As the New York City Board of Education begins its final deliberations to choose a schools chancellor, two men have emerged as chief contenders.
Ramon C. Cortines, former Superintendent of Schools in San Francisco, espouses middle-of-the-road views on education and has won backing from the board majority.
Gerald N. Tirozzi, former Education Commissioner in Connecticut, generated praise and controversy in his tenure there, and has support from Mayor Dinkins.

Review/Rock; A Sound With a Sense Of History, and Humor
For somebody not in the Mekons cult fan club, an introduction to the band through a concert invites suspicion of the adulation it gets from its inner circle.
The band, put together in Leeds, England, in 1977, started as a punk group, went through a country phase and now has come out a new- wave band, circa 1983.
The music at first seemed indistinct, noisy rock that 100 bands could have played better.
The attraction seemed obvious: at the Grand on Friday night, the Mekons put on a nostalgia show for the thirtysomething audience who had come to intellectual maturity listening to the group.
But after a while the group's elements started to separate themselves.
The band is funny: after the show, the group's lead singer and guitarist, Jon Langford, let himself be carried by fans across the club, mocking rote rock-star moves.
Onstage he and the band made no attempt to differentiate themselves from the audience, looking just like the average bohemians next door, and talking the same, too; Mr.
Langford tossed off jokes about Marxism.
And the band is literary without ever becoming proud of itself: one song conflated cliches with politically redolent fragments, mixing "It was a dark and stormy night," with phrases like "White House," "Mississippi," and "1964."


Dina Taylor and Paul Brewer
Dina Taylor, a daughter of Alvin and Judit Taylor of Bayside, Queens, was married yesterday to Paul Edward Brewer, the son of David Brewer and Jean Denton, both of Los Gatos, Calif.
Rabbi Donald Pollock officiated at the Cathedral of the Pines in Rindge, N.H.
Ms.
Brewer, 26, was until recently a law clerk to Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. of Federal District Court in Los Angeles.
She is to join the New York law firm of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell as an associate in November.
She graduated cum laude from Princeton University and received a law degree from Harvard University.
Her father is an engineering manager for the Telephonics Corporation, an audio equipment manufacturer in Huntington, L.I.
Her mother is the director of the Bayside Early Childhood Center.

The bride and the bridegroom own and manage commercial property in Cambridge.
Both graduated from Connecticut College.


A Truce on Wetlands
The package on wetlands released by the White House last week was touted by Clinton Administration officials as an important shift, one that moved the issue beyond polarization and paralysis.
Overall, the "new" Federal policy is balanced and commendable, but, with a few important exceptions, it is neither novel nor, unfortunately, likely to be the last word.

Small-Time Gold Miners Scrape By
Mickey Rees, an independent gold miner working on the Trinity River, ignores the people who lean out of their speeding cars to shout mockingly, "Get a job."
But when tourists pull over to photograph him, shirtless and smoking on a floating dredge the size of a limousine, the 43-year-old miner and Vietnam veteran takes out binoculars and stares back.
Though he may seem like an anachronism, Mr.
Rees says he is not ready to become a souvenir.


What Is a River Worth?
Montana's Yellowstone River is the longest undammed river left in the 48 contiguous states.
It is a national treasure, tumbling out of our oldest national park in a blue cascade until it joins the Missouri River 671 miles downstream.
But the Yellowstone River is about to be placed in danger.
Sometime in 1994, Noranda Minerals, a Canadian company, through its partner, Crown Butte Resources, is planning to start construction on a huge gold mine two and a half miles from the northeast entrance of Yellowstone National Park.


Joshua Greenberg and Kathryn Dulit
Kathryn Laura Dulit, a daughter of Drs.

She graduated from Oberlin College.
She and her husband received law degrees from Northeastern University.


Southeast Alert as Zigzagging Hurricane Nears Coast
Hurricane alerts were raised along 450 miles of the East Coast today as the latest Atlantic storm zigzagged toward land.
Some residents of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the area that seems most likely to be hit, began stocking up on storm supplies.
But many residents and vacationers treated today as just another lazy late-summer day.


Fundamentalist Critic Arrested in Teheran

CHRONICLE
In celebration of this week's beginning of the United States Open tennis championship at Flushing Meadows, Queens, the Women's Tennis Association is honoring its founder, Billie Jean King, at a benefit dinner tonight at the Marriott Marquis Hotel.
The organizers of the honor say it is supposed to be a surprise -- as long as Ms.
King does not read the newspaper, and as long as Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who are scheduled to join the festivities, do not tell her either, all of which appears to be a long shot.


Leading Contender for a Schools Job Few Want
A continent away from the bustle of New York City, where the months-long search for a schools chancellor may soon be over, Ramon C. Cortines enjoyed the simple pleasures of a weekend by the bay and pondered the ultimate question:
Why would a man who has already run three school districts, who quit his job as head of the San Francisco schools last year because of a grinding work schedule and a painful ulcer, eagerly await a summons to New York and a thankless job that has bowed several distinguished educators before him? 'I'm Not Willing to Give Up'
"Attempting to make urban school districts work challenges me," said Mr.
Cortines, a 61-year-old Mexican-American who is now the top choice of the four-member majority on New York's Board of Education.
"People say New York can't be done. Well, I'm not willing to give up on our big cities."


Christopher Is Said to Have Given Impetus to Israeli-Palestinian Deal
The breakthrough in the Middle East peace talks gained momentum from the shuttle diplomacy of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, with help from an international cast that included the Foreign Minister of Norway and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, American officials said today.
The officials gave the Palestinians and Israelis full credit for their role in reaching preliminary agreements that could turn into historic accords.
But they said that secret talks in Oslo between senior Palestinians and Israelis, begun earlier this summer, were moving slowly until Mr.
Christopher's trip to the Middle East this month.


BERLINERS SEEKING HOLOCAUST CENTER
Inspired in part by the recent opening of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, a group of prominent Germans is pressing for construction of a similar museum here.
Although there are memorials to victims of the Nazi regime in various parts of Germany, and although some concentration camps have been turned into powerfully moving monuments, there is no museum here that fully documents the Nazis' murder of millions of civilians.


Anyone Could See Japan's Steady Change; Buddhist Power Grows
To the Editor:
It has been little noted in this country that Japan's change of Government has brought the Komeito (Clean Government Party) into the governing coalition and new cabinet.
The Komeito is an avowedly religious political party, close to the Soka Gakkai, an evangelical fundamentalist Buddhist organization with more than 8 million members in Japan and more than 200,000 in the United States.


Health Care Quandary: Will Coverage Cut Jobs?
The Clinton aides finishing up his health plan are wrestling with a devilish quandary: how to keep the creation of universal coverage from costing low-wage workers a pay cut or even their jobs.
At first glance, it would seem that these workers would be the plan's biggest winners.
Domestics, farm workers, sales clerks and others with modest earnings account for most of today's 16.3 million uninsured workers.

Miami and Notre Dame Are Banged Up Already
Miami and Notre Dame, two of college football's titans, incurred blows over the weekend, one an allegation of violations by former Hurricane players and the other a setback for the Fighting Irish at the quarterback position.
The two schools open their seasons on Saturday, Notre Dame facing Northwestern at South Bend, Ind., and Miami playing Boston College at Chesnut Hill, Mass.
The Hurricanes were ranked eighth in The New York Times preseason rankings and the Irish 12th.

She and her husband received law degrees from New York University.


Wasting the Voters' Time
All government officials must be held accountable for their actions, from the President of the United States on down the line.
But the grilling Mayor David Dinkins of New York got last week during the latest inquiry into the Crown Heights violence was neither substantive nor to the point.
It was politically motivated, repetitious and transparently designed not to illuminate but to embarrass.
Mr.
Dinkins has to take the blame for his administration's mishandling of the riots in Crown Heights.
And perhaps there is still something to be learned about what went on between the Mayor and his police commanders during the riots two summers ago.
But the lawyers in this case were not looking to learn.

U.S.C. Thinks Big, Then Loses Big
The freeway billboards here say, "Be a Trojan, Beat Notre Dame." North Carolina would have been a nice start.
Instead, the Tar Heels were the ones who executed Student Body Right here, while John Robinson spent the evening thinking about an an X-ray.
U.S.C.'s top tailback, Dwight McFadden, broke his ankle in the first quarter, and Robinson, beginning his second tenure as Trojan coach, saw his game plan dwindle to flare passes in a 31-9 loss to North Carolina in the Disneyland Pigskin Classic.


Family Leave Law Will Hurt Women
To the Editor:
"Women's Work -- and Men's, Too" (editorial, Aug. 17) implies that I am a "dinosaur" because I stated the obvious: since more women than men are likely to make use of the Family Leave Act, this well-intentioned law will result in increased discrimination against women.


How Four Survive, Alone in Sarajevo
Colorful sketches of milk cartons, cookie boxes, chocolate bars, fresh fruit and vegetables and a luxurious garden of flowery plants and butterflies are steadily conquering the walls of Stefica Miljkovic's apartment.
"These are things we want and haven't got anymore," said Mrs.
Miljkovic, a 66-year-old widow who has survived the 17-month siege of Sarajevo alone.
"I always drew pretty well," she said after answering her door wearing a swimsuit in the summer heat, her eyes bright and smiling.
"But it never crossed my mind to draw anything on the wall before."


Treasury to Auction Bills
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week is confined to the bills markets, beginning with today's regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills.
According to traders, by the close of the New York cash market on Friday, the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 3.02 percent, and the rate on the six-month bill was 3.11 percent.


New Battles Flare Over Mexico's Past
Along the elegant Paseo de la Reforma and all across the huge central square known as El Zocalo, workmen are stringing lights and hanging immense banners where thousands of Mexicans will shout "Viva Mexico!" on Sept. 15, the 183d anniversary of the start of the country's struggle for independence from Spain.
It is a dazzling demonstration, but in a country where the past is as tangible as a Mayan pyramid, or a colonial church, it is just one of many celebrations and vivid displays of Mexico's fascination with its own eventful history, or at least parts of it.


Bridge
The Connecticut Double Knockout Team Championship, which began almost a year ago, was completed last month.
The winners were Dr.
Ed Etkind and David Richheimer, both of Woodbridge, Conn., Judy Prescott of Trumbull, Conn., and Richard Moss of Westport, Conn.
The margin of victory in the final was 20 imps, almost all provided by the diagramed deal.
In one room Etkind and Richheimer bid the East-West hands to four hearts, which presented no problems.
In the other, as shown, Moss as North emerged from the bushes with a four-spade bid over four hearts.
This was doubled, and West made an unfortunate choice of opening lead: the diamond jack.


Beer Company Plans To Reassign Work
The G. Heileman Brewing Company said it was planning to reassign the beer and malt liquor accounts that it withdrew last week from its two New York agencies.
Though billings were estimated at $20 million, Heileman is expected to reduce spending later this year and into 1994.
Henry Gerfen, the executive vice president of marketing for Heileman in Rosemont, Ill., said on Friday that the Rainier beer brand would be consolidated at the Richards Group in Dallas.
Richards, which has handled advertising for Rainier outside the brand's Pacific Northwest marketing territory, will add responsibilities for the Pacific Northwest market from Deutsch/Dworin Inc. in New York.

U.N. Told by U.S. It Will Send Troops for a Bosnian Accord
The Clinton Administration has assured the United Nations that it will provide most of the 30,000 or so new troops who would help enforce any Bosnian peace agreement that may emerge from the crucial round of talks that are to open in Geneva on Monday, diplomats and United Nations officials say.
But prospects appear increasingly poor for the current peace proposal, which has been drawn up by Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United Nations and Lord Owen for the European Community.


Development Bank Shifts on Hungary
When the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development started doing business in Hungary two years ago, privatization was humming along and the bankers who were sent to make investment deals thought their task would be relatively easy.
It has not worked out that way.
Begun by Western countries as a way of helping Eastern Europe convert to a market economy, the development bank has had difficulty finding large private companies to support.
This has been the case even in Hungary, where foreign investment came early and strong and where the Government was eager to sell off business assets.

Giants Try to Plot Cuts That Might Not be Permanent
This is the time of year when being a football coach is like being a traffic cop.
Take Dan Reeves, for instance.
Not only does he have to deal with trying to direct his team off its bumpy preseason road, he must now take the Giants through the complicated and winding path that is the process of cutting players.
This is not easy stuff.
Reeves said today that the Giants haven't yet made any final decisions regarding the roster, but they do have a pretty good idea who is getting cut for good and who will be cut with the idea of bringing the player back for the inactive or practice squads if he clears waivers.
Teams must reduce their active rosters to the 47-man limit by noon on Monday.


Banner Season! Well, Sort of
It was Banner Day at Shea yesterday, and some Mets fans put more effort into their signs than some of the Mets players displayed during the game that followed.
Among the notable banners: "It's Lonely at the Bottom" and "Mets, You're Not Last. We're Behind You." One couple chided their fellow customers with: "We Bought Season Seats; Why Are You Here?" One fellow carried a sign that said: "I Made This Banner Just to Get on the Field."


A School Board and State
In four separate votes, the Board of Education in this blue-collar town has refused to institute a state-mandated free-breakfast program at one of its elementary schools.
Cost is not the issue because the state and Federal governments say they will pay for the program.
Instead, the board says it is standing on principle, fighting state mandates, the intrusion of big government and the ever-expanding welfare state.


For Former Partners, a Bitter Aftertaste
Betrayal, grief, love, trust, villainy, trauma, faith and hope: The language used by former partners of the Trammell Crow Company somehow seems more appropriate to romance novels than to business.

Some Names Withheld On Open's First Day
If you purchased an opening-day ticket to today's United States Open tennis championships, with the hope of seeing any of the top male players -- Jim Courier, Pete Sampras, Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Michael Chang, Ivan Lendl or Andre Agassi -- disappointment will greet you at the National Tennis Center.
Today's program does feature two big names, Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, but none of the other stars of the women's tour.
The most interesting matches on the show courts will be Petr Korda, at No. 9 is the highest-seeded man playing, versus Wayne Ferreira, and Patrick McEnroe against Marcos Ondruska.
But most of the marquee names on the men's and women's tours will not play until tomorrow or Wednesday.

Sports of the Times; A Fight Continues for Ashe's Sake
WITH her daughter, Camera, on one side, and friends and officials on the other, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe left the tent where she had autographed hundreds of copies of her husband's autobiography and made her way to the Stadium Court at the National Tennis Center yesterday.
In a few minutes, the first of several celebrity matches were scheduled for the beginning of the second-annual Arthur Ashe AIDS Tennis Challenge, sponsored by the United States Tennis Association.
In the opening match, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Jana Novotna faced Evander Holyfield, the former heavyweight champion, and Hana Mandlikova.
Comedian Alan King served as master of ceremonies.
Riddick Bowe, the current heavyweight champion, served as umpire and alternated with Holyfield as the celebrity matches continued.

Britain's Zany Way to Start the Day
It is inspired, in part, by the anarchic, clattering style known as "zoo" radio, which originated in the United States.
It is fired by a red-haired, bespectacled host who looks like one of Wally Cleaver's hipper friends.
And it is more wired than the most frenetic household on a weekday morning.
It is "The Big Breakfast," a program that has widened the reach of British morning television by breaking the breakfast television mold.
It is produced for Channel 4, one of Britain's two commercially financed networks, by Planet 24, an independent production company owned in part by Bob Geldof, the Irish rock musician.


Long Island Drive-In May Play Its Last Reels
At one time, it was just another outdoor movie theater in suburbia, a vast, bumpy blacktop where children snoozed through the second feature in the backs of their parents' station wagons, and animated hot dogs danced with hamburgers across a screen 80 feet high.
In those days, there was not much to distinguish the Westbury Drive-In from the dozens of others that were a mainstay of cinematic life in New York's suburbs.
But today, the Westbury, with its marquee missing light bulbs and its asphalt scarred by potholes, is distinctive in one respect: It is the last of the great outdoor picture shows in the metropolitan region.

Marriage Imposes Special Burdens on Marines; Stabilizing Effect
To the Editor:
As a former division officer, assistant department head and drug and alcohol counselor on a Navy amphibious assault ship during the late 1970's, I must respectfully disagree with Bernard Trainor's "Answer to a Marine Chaplain's Prayer" (Op-Ed, Aug. 13), which repeats the tired canard that unmarried men make better soldiers, sailors and marines.
I spent nearly four years training and counseling hundreds of young sailors during two extended deployments to the Western Pacific under highly stressful shipboard conditions, and my observations are different from General Trainor's.


Shamed by Publicity, Banks Stress Minority Mortgages
Shamed and embarrassed by their poor lending records, mortgage lenders are finally opening their doors a little wider to poor people and members of minority groups seeking home loans.
Newly released figures from a handful of big banks suggest that they are starting to reduce the obstacles that have led them to reject minority-group applicants and poor people.
Although complete information will not be available until October, many banks are showing sharp increases in the number of these loans.

NEW YORK CITY TWO MEN CHARGED IN GIRL'S DEATH An 18-year-old man who was tried and acquitted in the arson murder of six people two years ago was arrested yesterday with another man in the killing of an girl whose badly burned body was found underneath a highway overpass in the Bronx.
The victim was believed to be an 11-to-13 year-old black female, but her identity remained a mystery yesterday as investigators wondered why no one had come forward to report a missing person answering her description.

New Leader of Nigeria Plans to Free 3 Dissidents; Strikes Continue
The head of Nigeria's new interim Government announced tonight that he was ordering the immediate release of three leading pro-democracy advocates who had been detained by the military authorities since early July.

Group's Trade in Bodies Reaped Wealth and Power
Police raids in New York and Hong Kong over the weekend took aim at a Chinese gang that has become New York City's most powerful Asian crime organization, gaining wealth and influence through the smuggling of Chinese immigrants, investigators say.
The gang, known as the Fuk Ching, has been operating in New York for several years, but came under increased police scrutiny recently because of its role in helping to organize the ill-fated voyage of a tramp steamer that ran aground off Queens in June with nearly 300 Chinese men and women aboard.


A Long Shot Is Running For Office, And Respect
A recent campaign appearance at a sultry center for the elderly in Brooklyn drew a mere dozen women who came to see State Senator David A. Paterson, a candidate in the Democratic primary for Public Advocate, the job that used to be called City Council President.
Afterward, Mr.
Paterson acknowledged that he had grown accustomed to gatherings with only a handful of people.
But by attending such events, holding fund-raisers that net no more than $75 and enduring the rejections of his requests for endorsements, he said, he hoped to prove once and for all that he was serious about wanting to be the city's Public Advocate.

Homosexuals Turn Mass Into Silent Protest of Pastoral Letter
In a silent protest, 29 lesbians and gay men demonstrated during Mass yesterday at St.
James Cathedral in downtown Brooklyn, condemning what they called hypocrisy in a pastoral letter on homosexuality by Bishop Thomas V. Daily of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens.
But when he began Mass, Bishop Daily surprised the demonstrators by reordering the service, beginning with the "Rite of Peace," in which everyone in attendance is asked to greet those around them.
For 15 minutes, the demonstrators found themselves engulfed by members of the cathedral's congregation and clergy, including the Bishop himself, all of them offering handshakes and good wishes.

REPORT TO FAULT FIREARMS BUREAU FOR RAID ON CULT
Senior officials of the agency that conducted the botched raid on a cult near Waco, Tex., in February were "too detached" from the operation, leaving the main decisions to agents who had no training in large paramilitary missions, internal investigators reviewing the operation have found.
The findings, part of a review to be made public in mid-September, cast new doubt on the future of Stephen E. Higgins, the longtime director of the agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a division of the Treasury Department.


Leading Contender for a Schools Job Few Want; Nearing a Decision
Today the New York City Board of Education begins its final deliberations to choose a new schools chancellor after a six-month search that has appeared to deepen the antagonisms between the board's two factions.

The board's other three members are backing Gerald N. Tirozzi, the former state Education Commissioner in Connecticut.


IN DRAFT ACCORD, ISRAELIS AND P.L.O. NEAR RECOGNITION
Israeli and Palestinian officials said today that an imminent agreement -- the first in the two sides' long, tortured history -- would lead to mutual recognition by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and a form of Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied territories within six months.
They said a declaration of principles could be signed this week in Washington, where the Middle East peace talks are to resume on Tuesday, and would outline a planned shift of authority starting in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho.


Two Held in Death of Girl Found on Fire by Highway
An 18-year-old man who was acquitted in the arson deaths of six people two years ago was arrested yesterday with another man in the murder of a young girl whose body was found on fire beneath a highway overpass in the Bronx on Aug. 22.
The victim was believed to be 11 to 13 years old, possibly from Brooklyn, but her identity remained a mystery yesterday.
Investigators said no one had reported a missing person fitting her description.

TRACK AND FIELD Czech Sets a Record  Jan Zelezny of the Czech Republic had his fans and rivals gasping in admiration yesterday as he broke his world javelin record with a throw of 313 feet 10 inches, at the Sheffield International meet in Sheffield, England.

A Deposition in a Grudge Match
WHEN the shaken Hasidic residents of Crown Heights first sat down in the autumn of 1991 to consider a Federal civil rights suit against New York City, they were still shocked by the four days of violence against them that a state investigator would later call the city's worst racial disturbances in more than 20 years.
But two years have passed since then, and the four days of terror, confusion and official bungling have festered and grown into a permanent grudge match between Mayor David N. Dinkins and the Lubavitch Hasidim who cluster around Brooklyn's Eastern Parkway.


Good News, for Once, on Ozone
It's not often that science, industry and government can agree on the causes of a complicated problem and then work to solve it.
When they do, there's reason to celebrate.
Last week an issue of Nature, a British journal, carried some unexpected good news that is directly traceable to a collective effort: The invasion of the stratosphere by chemicals that thin the earth's protective ozone layer is slowing down.
If the trend continues, the buildup of ozone-destroying chemicals should stop by the year 2000.
The worst of the destruction -- and it will get worse for a while -- should come around the turn of the century when the peak load of chemicals, now wafting upward, reaches the stratosphere.
At that point, assuming no new assaults, the ozone layer should begin a slow recovery.

Chang Can't Handle What Rosset Delivers
Just when it seemed that Michael Chang might have worked up this summer's most consequential head of hard-court steam on the eve of the United States Open, he found himself deflated by unseeded Marc Rosset today in the final of the Waldbaum's Hamlet Cup.
More to the point, the fifth-seeded Chang found himself brutalized by the harsh serve and humbling forehand of the 30th-ranked Rosset, whose 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory earned him his second title for 1993 and ended Chang's nine-match winning spree.
With Chang, nearly a foot shorter than his opponent, reduced to warding off Rosset's serve rather than returning it in damaging fashion, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist from Switzerland said he felt he held the upper hand throughout the match.


Critic's Notebook; Honoring Bernstein: Just Count the Ways
It has been nearly three years since Leonard Bernstein's death, but in a way he set the tone for the programs offered in his honor last week.
Bernstein, who would have been 75 last Wednesday, was the music world's most openly emotional, self-revealing, culturally omnivorous figure.
Those qualities suffused his conducting and his own works, to say nothing of his books, his lectures and his television shows, particularly the "Omnibus" and "Young People's Concerts" that made him a kind of musical father figure for the generation that grew up in the 1960's.
So it was very much in the spirit of his expansive personality that the celebrations spilled out of the concert halls and into the streets and parks.
And it was wholly in character that the main event -- an Alice Tully Hall concert on Wednesday, organized by the conductor's family -- was broadcast live in Japan and by tape delay in Germany, with an American showing scheduled for Sept. 9 at 9 P.M., on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network.
Very much a man of this anxious age, Bernstein believed in documenting his work.
Now the commemorations are being documented as well.


Review/Theater; Exploring Sexes and Identities
Kate Bornstein, the creator of and sole performer in "The Opposite Sex Is Neither" at Performance Space 122, could be an entire discussion panel on "Donahue" all by herself.
A former man who became a woman and is now a lesbian, Ms.
Bornstein has constructed a series of mystically connected monologues in which she embodies a host of characters on different levels in the twilight zone of sexual identity: a male impersonator, a "she-male" drag queen and five others who have, through surgery and sartorial camouflage, crossed the gender line from both directions.
In fact, Ms.
Bornstein has actually appeared on both "Donahue" and "Geraldo," and she seems, in an odd way, well-suited to a mainstream medium.
Looking a bit like the film actress Julie Hagerty, with a stronger jawline and bigger teeth, Ms.
Bornstein emanates a sunny, nonthreatening wholesomeness and rationality.
And she tends to speak in neatly shaped homilies that emphasize the importance of finding peace within one's own skin.


FOR PALESTINIANS, RANGE OF REACTION
The possibility that a major breakthrough in peace talks with Israel is on the horizon captured the attention of Palestinians today.
Reactions to a proposal that would put Palestinians in charge of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho, occupied by Israel since 1967, ranged from elated embrace to utter rejection.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Campaigns for magazines show a world of teen-age girls without sugar, spice or anything nice.
HOW times have changed since 1958, when Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote "I Enjoy Being a Girl" for "Flower Drum Song." A woman's younger years, once portrayed as a carefree roundelay of cheer, are now presented in far more sober fashion.
Nowhere is that more evident than in the advertising for YM, one of the main titles dominating the fecund field of magazines aimed at female teen-agers.
According to the provocative trade campaign by YM's new agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy, young women confront a life fraught with more perils than ever faced Pauline or Indiana Jones.

Blaming TV for Son's Death, Frenchwoman Sues
A Frenchwoman is suing the head of a state-owned television channel for manslaughter after her 17-year-old son was killed by a home-made bomb that she said he learned to make from the American television series "MacGyver."
Marine Laine said her son, Romain, and his friend, Cedric Nouyrigat, also 17, mixed crystallized sugar and weed-killer, stuffed it into the handlebar of a bicycle and ignited it to test a technique used by MacGyver, a television hero who is part adventurer, part scientific wizard.

On the trail with MICHAEL JACKSON: The singer canceled a concert in Singapore yesterday after suffering a severe headache and vomiting as he prepared to go on stage.
Mr.
Jackson, who was not hospitalized, was taken back to his suite at the Raffles Hotel for an examination.
The show was rescheduled for tomorrow.
"He was well this afternoon, but as we went to the stadium, he slowly developed this acute headache or migraine," Dr.
David Forecast, Mr.
Jackson's physician, said to The Associated Press.
"He is dizzy. He is vomiting. He is being attended to by a neurology specialist. He was in no condition to perform, in my medical opinion."


Clinton Sets Out Conditions For Sending G.I.'s to Bosnia
Drawing comparisons between Bosnia and Somalia, President Clinton said today that he would support a Bosnian peace agreement only if it was "enforceable," but would continue to support international peacekeeping efforts in Somalia.
Setting out conditions for the use of American troops in Bosnia, Mr.
Clinton said he was willing to pledge his support for a peace plan only after he decided that the details were acceptable.


How a Betrayal Snagged a Chinese Gang Leader
Guo Liang Chi thought he was talking to a friend when he described how he had ordered the murder of two of his trusted lieutenants in Chinatown last January.
"Do it," he said, according to Federal transcripts of a secretly taped conversation.
"Do a clean job."
Speaking by telephone in February from a hiding place in China, he recounted how he had given the command, and explained why they had to die -- they had challenged him for a heftier cut of the huge profits their gang was earning from smuggling Chinese immigrants.
But the friend, it turned out, was an informer, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation taped the call.
Rare Look at Gang Life
The brutal simplicity of that execution order was just one of the elements about life within a violent Chinatown gang that emerged yesterday as Federal authorities, after more than two years of investigation, unveiled what they described as conclusive evidence that will finally put Mr.
Guo, the leader of the Fuk Ching gang, away for life.
The smoking gun, described in the Federal complaint against Mr.
Guo, is a taped conversation in February between the gang leader and a confidential informer.
Mr.
Guo was already in Fujian Province in China, where he fled in January after the killing.


CABINET IN ISRAEL BACKS AUTONOMY FOR PALESTINIANS
Accompanied both by hopeful forecasts and angry warnings, the Israeli Government approved a draft agreement with the Palestinians early today that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said could be signed before nightfall in Washington.
In Tunis, a senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization also said the two sides were on the brink of a breakthrough and would be able to announce a deal in the next day or two.


New York City Offers A Women's Health Line
To the Editor:
Poor women or recent immigrants who wish to terminate an unwanted or ill-timed pregnancy should be aware of a valuable New York City Department of Health resource to help them.


Review/Television; New Time, New Place, Same Humor
The gap between 11:35 and 12:35 turns out to be one that can be measured only in minutes, not in light-years.
David Letterman's new "Late Show," the version of his talk show reinvented for a larger, presumably more wide-awake audience, turns out to be as savvy and caustic as its NBC incarnation.
Although Mr.
Letterman began his new stint with obviously rekindled energy, the show's actual format was remarkably close to its predecessor's.
Actionably close, as a matter of fact -- and of course Mr.
Letterman made his legal skirmish with NBC one of the night's main sources of fun.
Striding onto the stage of a handsomely refurbished Ed Sullivan Theater, to an introduction wittily patched together from old Ed Sullivan clips (Mr. Letterman was variously "a fabulous boy prodigy," "my handsome Italian paisano" and "the most amazing of all the chimp acts ever to come on the show"), CBS's new star wickedly took aim at his old employers.
"Legally, I can continue to call myself Dave," he explained, while also claiming to have found a peacock's head in his bed.
Along came the NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, obviously a man who enjoys living dangerously, to wish Mr.
Letterman "reasonably well" and to confiscate a couple of cue cards, saying they were the intellectual property of NBC.
Not surprisingly, Mr.
Letterman found a lot to work with there, too.


CHRONICLE
HARUKI KADOKAWA, the flamboyant Japanese movie mogul and publisher who co-produced the short-lived "Shogun: The Musical" on Broadway, could face the unraveling of his considerable power following his arrest Sunday on suspicion of cocaine smuggling.
The seizure of the 51-year-old president of the Kadokawa Publishing Company in the middle of the night Sunday at his home in Tokyo has caused a sensation in Japan, which has few drug problems and little tolerance for narcotics use.


Stocks Edge Upward as Dow Gains 3.36
Stocks notched slight gains in light trading yesterday, with strength in utilities and telecommunications issues.
Interest-rate sensitive sectors benefited from lower interest rates, as the bond market firmed in reaction to weaker than expected new home sales in July and the report of a large second-quarter trade deficit.


White House Counsel Suffers Unfair Attack
To the Editor:
"The Clues Left by Vincent Foster" (editorial, Aug. 12) disserves readers by calling for the removal of Bernard Nussbaum, counsel to the President, in the wake of Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s suicide.
You ask for appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the complaints of a man in the midst of clinical depression, as if those comments were not only credible but also so serious that the normal organs of government cannot be trusted to review them.


Sports of The Times; A Mountain Out of Tennis Minutiae
ALL RIGHT, enough of this squealing about how Monica Seles ought to have been frozen as the No. 1 player in the world after being stabbed on the court in Hamburg last April 30.
The argument is beginning to sound awfully specious, especially after hearing Seles make it herself.
Who's No. 1?
Judging by the number of news media bodies that were crammed into Seles's news conference yesterday on Day 1 of another Grand Slam she's not playing in, it's still Seles, the tennis Garbo, no matter what the agate print on the results pages of the sports sections says.


Bridge
The World Team Championships were declared open here Sunday night by Robert Wolff of Dallas, the president of the World Bridge Federation.
Play began here this morning with 16 teams in the Bermuda Bowl, for open teams, and 16 in the Venice Trophy, for women's teams.
In one Bermuda Bowl qualifying group, the United States No. 1 team is starting against Norway, one of its most dangerous opponents together with China and Denmark.
In the other group United States No. 2 is opening against Mexico, and will probably find Brazil, the Netherlands and Poland to be its strongest adversaries.


G.M. Said to Start TV-Buying Review
The General Motors Corporation has begun a long-expected move to consolidate the media services on its $1.4 billion advertising accounts by placing in review its national television-buying budget, advertising executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said yesterday.
The executives, in confirming a report this week in Adweek, said the review had started with the assignment to buy $500 million to $600 million in network, cable and syndicated television commercial time.
It involves three G.M. media agencies: the Leo Burnett Company, D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles and Lintas Worldwide.
Once the review is completed, the report said, G.M. is expected to turn to consolidating its print-buying assignment, with billings estimated at more than $250 million.


Alan P. Smith, 48; Ecologist Analyzed The Forest Canopy
Dr.
Alan Paul Smith, a plant ecologist for the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, died on Thursday at Doctor's Hospital in Miami.
A resident of Balboa, Panama, he was 48.
The cause was complications from cancer, the institute said.


Mariners Sign No. 1 Pick
Faced with the prospect of losing the rights to Alex Rodriguez, baseball's No. 1 draft pick, the cash-tight Seattle Mariners today enticed the 18-year-old shortstop into signing by guaranteeing him a three-year major league contract.
The deal includes a signing bonus estimated at $1 million and is reportedly worth between $1.5 million and $1.9 million over all.
That total is well short of the $2.5 million bonus Rodriguez, from Miami Westminster Christian High, had been seeking.


3 Japan Auto Makers' Debt on Credit Watch
The Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation placed more than $25 billion of debt of the top three Japanese auto makers on credit watch with negative implications today, in a move that could eventually raise the borrowing costs for the Japanese automobile industry.
S.&amp; P.'s move was further verification of the deteriorating financial position of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Company, which have been hurt by the soaring value of the yen and sharper competition from Detroit's Big Three auto makers.


Haiti's Premier Is Installed, but in Washington and Amid Heat
It was a peculiar setting for a ceremony marking the installation of a new head of government: an embassy in a foreign capital.
But given the turbulent politics of Haiti, it was hardly surprising for Prime Minister Robert Malval.
Rather, the occasion today at the Haitian Embassy here marked a reconciliation of bitterly divided political, military and business leaders that is intended to end violence and restore democracy to Haiti.


Making Do in Difficult Times
On a recent, typical afternoon in the Lucille Lortel Viewing Room of the Theater on Film and Tape Archive, the 10 video monitors glowed with images of Broadway's recent past.
On one, the Irish sisters of "Dancing at Lughnasa" were once again dancing out the frustrations of parochial life; on another, Stockard Channing was exquisitely exhaling rich-liberal angst in John Guare's "Six Degrees of Separation"; on a third, the original cast of "A Chorus Line" was strutting through its legendary paces of show-biz neurosis and ambition.
For the roughly 5,000 people -- largely theater professionals and students -- who will use the resources of the archive in the next year, there is plenty more to choose from.
From among the archive's more than 2,000 offerings, they will be able to select such relatively esoteric fare as Richard Burton's "Hamlet," Charles Ludlam's "Galas" and even the notorious flop "Moose Murders," as well as taped interviews with actors, choreographers, directors, playwrights, and scenic and costume designers.

21 Shot Dead in Rio Slum; Policemen Are Suspected
With Brazil's urban carnage looking increasingly like guerrilla warfare, squads of hooded men invaded a shantytown today and shot 21 people dead.
"What is happening to this country?" Aparecida Prazeres da Costa lamented as she stared at the body of her 25-year-old son, Jussara.
"What kind of hell are we living in?"


U.N. Aides in Somalia 'Captured' in Ranger Raid
Elite United States Army Rangers mounted their first major operation in Somalia today, storming several Mogadishu houses only to find one deserted and another full of United Nations workers whom they tied up and briefly detained, United Nations and Pentagon officials said.
Officials would not formally specify the goal of the two-hour mission, which involved more than a dozen helicopters and about 50 United States Army Rangers and soldiers from the Army's Quick Reaction Force.
The United Nations military spokesman in Mogadishu, Maj.
David Stockwell of the United States, said the raid showed that the United States and the United Nations would "increasingly respond to attacks and will ultimately return Mogadishu to a more peaceful state."


Standard Set For Unix Interface
The suppliers of the powerful Unix operating system have agreed on a common standard that will allow software applications to run on virtually all Unix-based machines.
The move is an effort to make Unix more attractive to independent software developers as it competes for their support with the Microsoft Corporation's new high-end system, NT.
More than 50 companies, including I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems, will announce tomorrow the single specification for application programming interfaces, or A.P.I.'s, which link a software operating system to applications like spreadsheet, data base and graphics programs.
An operating system is the set of basic internal commands that enable a computer to function.

AHMANSON &amp; CO., Irwindale, Calif., appointed Kevin M. Twomey executive vice president and chief financial officer of Ahmanson and its principal subsidiary, Home Savings of America.

When a Cut Is Not a Cut
Cut one day, back the next.
To some extent, that explains yesterday's roster maneuvers by the 28 National Football League clubs.
Each team had to get down to 47 players by noon.
Those players cut with fewer than four years in the league were placed on waivers for 24 hours, during which they could be claimed by another team.
Players with more than four years became immediate free agents and could sign with any team, including the one that cut them.
It was to a team's advantage to protect younger players, instead of exposing them to waivers, and cut veteran players, who could be quickly re-signed.


COMPANY NEWS;
Health Net, the largest for-profit health maintenance organization in California, said yesterday that it had agreed to merge with Qual Med Inc., a Colorado-based H.M.O., in a deal that analysts valued at $500 million in stock plus $225 million in debt.
Roger F. Greaves, chairman of HN Management Holdings Inc., Health Net's parent company, will share chief executive duties in the merged company with Dr.
Malik M. Hasan, a London-trained neurologist from Pakistan who is Qual Med's chairman.


And Reeves Re-created the Giants in His Image
Talk about shaking things up.
Dan Reeves took hold of the Giants today, turned the team upside down and inside out, and when the smoke cleared a few notable veterans were packing their bags.
The biggest name was Pepper Johnson, a Pro Bowler who has been to two Super Bowls.
He found out today that when you battle the coach, the coach pretty much always wins.
He is no longer a Giant and almost surely will never be again.
Today was cutdown day as the Giants trimmed their roster to 47 players.
But this was actually more than a trimming of the roster, this was Reeves beginning to shape the team in his own image.
It was simply one of the most amazing and stunning days in recent Giants history.


But, of Course! It's Christmas in August


They're Smart, for Fish, And a Model of Diversity
THE date is a dud and both parties know it.
Yet as long as they are stuck with each other for a time they make a wan effort to flirt.
He lunges lazily toward her.
She quivers gently in response.
He flaps his tail against her.
She flares her gills to show their provocative red undersides.
He circles around, charges her again and tries to nip her, but now she's getting bored with the charade and moves away from him.
Reacting likewise, he drifts off to the opposite end of the tank.
For a few moments they are each lost in the inscrutable vastness of fish thought.
And then it happens.
The female opens her plump, sensuously carved lips into the widest, roundest, most perfect, least courteous gape of mouth that can be imagined: a fish yawn.
"The female doesn't seem very interested, does she?" said Suzanne Henson, a student carrying out an experiment on the mating habits of cichlid (pronounced SICK-lid) fish.
"She's not doing the sort of things you'd expect from a receptive female. She's not doing the slip motion, gliding her whole body along the body of the male."

Vanbiesbrouck Plans to Get Even
He says he holds absolutely no resentment against the Rangers, the only National Hockey League team he has ever played for in his 10-year career, but JOHN VANBIESBROUCK conceded yesterday that Jan. 3 already has been circled on his calendar.
For the 29-year-old goaltender, that marks his next appearance at Madison Square Garden, only this time it will be as a member of the expansion Florida Panthers.
Vanbiesbrouck was traded to Vancouver in June, then selected days later by Florida in the expansion draft.


Corrections
An article on Sunday about a resolution in Cobb County, Ga., condemning homosexuality referred incorrectly to findings of a study on the county's share of Federal spending.
Common Cause magazine found that Cobb had received more Federal money than all but two suburban counties per capita, not in total.


A Historic Deal in the Middle East
What seemed unthinkable only weeks ago could become a tangible reality before this year is out.
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization report that they have agreed in principle to begin dismantling Israel's 26-year military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, erecting in its place interim arrangements for Palestinian self-rule.
Important details need to be nailed down, but a formal agreement could be announced any day now at the Middle East peace talks, which reconvene in Washington today.


Lessons of Andrew Prepare Agency for Emily
One year after Hurricane Andrew leveled much of South Florida and damaged the reputation of the Federal agency charged with helping disaster victims, that agency says it is much better prepared to take on Hurricane Emily.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency made few preparations for Andrew and was widely criticized for taking weeks before helping people with housing and financial aid.
But by midday today, some 24 hours before Hurricane Emily was expected to brush the North Carolina coast, agency officials had met with President Clinton, set up an equipment-staging center in Fort Bragg, N.C., talked with disaster officials of states that might be affected and dispatched 12 trailers loaded with tents, generators and other emergency equipment.


Letitia Ide, 84, Dies; A Jose Limon Dancer
Letitia Ide, who performed with the Humphrey-Weidman and Jose Limon modern-dance companies in the 1930's and 40's, died on Sunday at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.
She was 84.
The cause was cancer, said her son, Timothy Ratner of Manhattan.


Observer; Frequent Liar Program
The Government's story, which may be a lie, is that the scheme to make illegal loans of $5 billion to Iraq was the work of five branch-bank employees in Atlanta.
They worked for the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro with headquarters in Rome, and the deed was done back during the Bush Administration when Washington still thought Saddam Hussein was one of the good guys.
Five billion seems a considerable sum for an American branch of an Italian bank to be dispensing without so much as an "O.K. by you?" to the home office in Rome, but the Justice Department says, believe it or not, that's the way it happened.


Mellower Clinton Returns to White House
President Clinton returned to work today with a ruddy tan, an easy laugh and a mellow attitude that spilled over into a bit of Presidential meditation this morning at a White House prayer breakfast.
Gone, for the moment, was the slashing criticism of Congress, the bitter digs at the press and the pointed complaints about Washington that came from the pre-vacation President.


Board of Education's Majority Chooses Cortines as Chancellor
The New York City Board of Education, divided by 4 to 3, decided yesterday to appoint Ramon C. Cortines, the former Schools Superintendent in San Francisco, as the city's next Schools Chancellor.
The board split along the same lines as it did last February when it ousted the former Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, suggesting that the new Chancellor will inherit a polarized board as he seeks to impose order on a school system besieged by surging enrollments, a declining budget, classroom violence and crumbling school buildings.


Hardly Like Old Times For Robinson's Trojans
John Robinson, the sequel, is already getting mixed reviews.
He last coached the University of Southern California as far back as the Ford Administration, returned Sunday night gray around the temples and found his old offensive scheme in cobwebs.
He used to have his way with the North Carolinas of the world, but the Tar Heels showed him their progress in a 31-9 season-opening defeat.
Classes began today on the U.S.C. campus, but Robinson had already been taught a lesson: opponents no longer shiver at the sight of the Trojans.
Great tailbacks always used to follow him, or vice versa, but on Sunday, his top running back, Dwight McFadden, was in the hospital instead of the end zone after he broke his ankle in the first quarter.
Robinson could have traded for a new halfback if he were still the Rams' coach, but he instead spent the second half of the Disneyland Pigskin Classic "holding tryouts."

The N.A.A.C.P. Means Business
Officials of Hughes Aircraft were stunned this month when the N.A.A.C.P. publicly lambasted the aerospace contractor for what the group called a dismal record of hiring members of minorities.
But more shocking than the accusations, Hughes officials said, was the way the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People made them: at a news conference, without first giving the company a chance to defend itself.


Bronx Boy, 10, Wounded By Gunmen on His Street
A 10-year-old boy, sitting with his older sister outside a restaurant across from his home in the Bronx, was hit in the head by a stray bullet on Sunday night when two gunmen opened fire in what was believed to be a drug-related shooting.
The boy, Luis Rivera, who was in critical condition yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, was hit as he scrambled to get away when the shooting began at 11:35 P.M. at the intersection of 167th Street and Grant Avenue in the Melrose section, the police said.


Books of The Times; On Being Young, Hot And Literary in the 60's
New York Days  By Willie Morris 396 pages. Little, Brown &amp; Company. $24.95.
The tale of the small-town boy who leaves the provinces for the bright lights of the big city is a familiar one, told over and over again by successive generations of writers.
It was the subject of Willie Morris's first book, "North Toward Home," published some 25 years ago, and it's also the subject of his latest book, "New York Days," a memoir that more or less takes up where "North Toward Home" left off in the late 60's.

The resemblance is unmistakable.
She has the same look, giggle and fierce ground strokes as Monica Seles.
"The Americans always say that," Iva Majoli of Croatia said yesterday.

Market Place; What's an investor to do when market data prove worthless?
FEW things are more important on Wall Street than good stock data.
Every day, a virtual data industry chugs out new numbers on earnings, stock yields and trading levels that Wall Street's horde of analysts pick through in search of the best -- and the worst -- investments.
Among the most eagerly awaited of those statistics are the monthly short-interest figures, which essentially tell investors how heavy the bets are that individual stocks are headed for a fall.
Those numbers carry particular weight because they are among the handful released by the stock exchanges themselves.

Carlo Lifavi Menotti, a voice coach whose students included Judy Garland, Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett and Bobby Darin, died on Friday in Poconos Medical Center in East Stroudsburg, Pa.

The cause was congestive heart failure, said Gasper Como, a friend.

Indoors And Out, A Big Show
David Letterman finally opened on Broadway last night, bringing much of his old NBC show with him to his new address: CBS and the Ed Sullivan Theater.

Much of that excitement spilled out into the streets.


Judge Says Yonkers Lags In Integration
Seven years after he ordered the city of Yonkers to create a program to desegregate its school system, a Federal judge found today that the effort had so far proved incomplete and that "vestiges of segregation" remained throughout the city's schools.
While praising Yonkers school officials for their "enthusiasm" and "sincere" attempts to eradicate segregation since his order was issued in 1986, Judge Leonard B. Sand said that their efforts had been imperiled by low teacher salaries, repeated city budget crises and a backdrop of "political and social turmoil."


Move Over, Gutenberg, for the Electronic Book
To the Editor:
I would like to amplify the observations of Lee van Laer in "Computers Alter the Job Market Forever" (letter, Aug. 16) about computers and their impact on publishing.
Twenty years ago I worked at a typesetting house just as "cold type" was vanquishing legions of linotype operators using the "hot type" method.
At our house, a typewritten manuscript from a publisher's editorial department would pass through an assembly line of typists, proofreaders, page makers and camera operators.
About 50 people, including management and secretarial staff, were churning out a much larger volume of type at a much lower cost than a similar-size staff using hot type.


Political Memo; Clinton's September Agenda: A Month of Policy Overload?
Nobody expects the health care overhaul to be easy.
Nobody expects the struggle over the North American Free Trade Agreement to be neat.
Both measures require an enormous amount of public education, some delicate coalition-building and a hard and complicated sales job in Congress.
Now, a capital that has barely recovered from the battle over President Clinton's economic plan is watching with some wonderment as the Administration begins to tackle both these issues in a single month.
Plus, by the way, Vice President Al Gore's proposals to "reinvent Government." September, in short, may be the quintessential Clinton experience, the month of policy overload.


Haarhuis Surprises Wheaton
Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands had yet to win a game last night against David Wheaton.
He was trailing, 6-0, 2-0, before he finally held serve.
Haarhuis raised his arms in triumph, looking as if he had won the United States Open, as the crowd at the Stadium Court erupted in celebration.
Little did both players know that Haarhuis would go on to win the first-round match, 0-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-4, 6-4, in a 3-hour-and-16 minute marathon.

COMPANY NEWS: Encountering The Digital Age -- An occasional look at computers in everday life.; The Keyboard Becomes a Hangout For a Computer-Savvy Generation
Sixteen-year-old Jon Leger, a high school student in Port Arthur, Tex., does not consider himself a computer whiz.
In fact he doesn't see himself as particularly special in any way.
"People at school treat me like I'm nothing," he said.
But on the Internet, the network of networks, accessible to anyone with a personal computer modem, he has found his place in a world that extends far beyond his home city in southeast Texas.
"On the net," he said, "people are willing to talk to me. It's a huge self-esteem booster."


Cuzco Journal; Archeologist Wants to Reconquer Shrine for Incas
Raymundo Bejar Navarro, an archeologist, climbs the adobe wall up onto the grounds of the Santo Domingo monastery here in the center of town.
Shaking his head, he complains that the four resident monks are refusing to let his scientific team dig in the area.
Defiantly, looking up at the towering, 350-year-old Spanish church, he hisses through his teeth, "They should tear this down."


So Why Is This Jet Not Weeping?
Moments after he had been informed that the Jets had terminated his contract, effectively cutting him loose from the team, center Jim Sweeney, a 10-year veteran, sat on a big wooden box outside the equipment room and talked about his future plans.
First, he was going to pick up his wife, Heather, at the airport.
Next, they were going to move his belongings out of a hotel near the Jets' headquarters and into a house on Long Island.
Then, he was going to get some sleep and get ready for the team's practice on Wednesday in preparation for the regular-season opener against Denver at Giants Stadium on Sunday.

"The horizons to peace are open. There is a stirring in the entire Arab arena in their readiness to make peace. Not that there aren't obstacles, not that there aren't difficulties. But I'm convinced that the horizons to peace are open." -- YITZHAK RABIN, Prime Minister of Israel  [ A1:6. ]


Here's Baby. Dad Stays Home. Dad Gets Antsy.
Now that millions of working men and women are guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for the birth of a child under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which took effect Aug. 5, will America begin to see new fathers staying at home?
Is Dad more likely to be around the house in the first few months, taking the newborn out in the baby carriage while Mom gets a chance to nap or read?
It sounds nice.
The image conforms to our collective notion that men are more sensitive to the needs of women and more interested in children than they used to be.
But the answer, mostly, is no -- at least not any time soon.


Panel Led by Gore Is to Propose Using 2-Year Federal Budget Plan
The panel studying reorganization of the Government intends to propose that Federal budgets cover two years rather than one, as is current practice, an Administration official said tonight.
A report of the draft plan was published in The Washington Post and confirmed later by the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

New Chancellor, Old Politics
A divided New York City Board of Education has chosen Ramon Cortines, the former Superintendent of Schools in San Francisco, as the next Schools Chancellor.
Mr.
Cortines may yet win the hearts, and votes, of all seven board members, and he may yet prove to be an excellent choice.
But he'll have to fight hard to dispel the cloud of mayoral politics that shadows his selection.
Mr.
Cortines comes to the job with some impressive credentials.
He served as superintendent of schools in Pasadena and San Jose before heading the San Francisco system, with 62,000 students, for six years.
During his tenure in San Francisco he was credited with reducing staff and programs while improving attendance and test scores.
And had he not taken the New York job he would almost certainly have become an assistant secretary of education in the Clinton Administration.


Emily to Rage Under a Full Moon
A full moon will rise and the tide will be high just a few hours before Hurricane Emily is expected to whip the Outer Banks of North Carolina with strong winds, but weather experts said yesterday that the convergence of events was not likely to add greatly to the effects of the storm.
"If Emily were to come ashore at a time of high tide, then that would exacerbate coastal flooding," said Lee Grenci of the Weather Communications Group at Pennsylvania State University.
But because the times will not coincide closely, he said, the effects will be slight.


Marinovich Handed a One-Way Ticket
The National Football League's new two-day process for shaping squads began yesterday with a number of well-known players being cut.
And at least a few were left wondering if they would have jobs when the regular season begins on Sunday.
Some players, like Dallas Cowboys safety Bill Bates, were told they would be rehired today, when the 28 clubs can start expanding their rosters from 47 to 53.
"All this means is a day off for golf," said Bates, an 11-year veteran.


Windows Widens Its Lead
WINDOWS applications, particularly those for word processing, spreadsheets, databases and presentation graphics, are now outselling plain DOS programs.
The sales figures for the first quarter of this year, according to the Software Publishers Association, were $669 million for Windows software, as against $502 million for DOS.
These figures mean more than those from Microsoft, which says that roughly a zillion copies (actually, about 30 million copies) of Windows 3.0 and 3.1 have gone out into the world.
There is no way of knowing whether half a zillion of the buyers, many of whom got Windows thrown in with a new computer anyway, are actually using or continuing to use the product.
They are using it, however, if they are paying money for programs that require the "gooey," which is GUI, or Graphical User Interface.


A Senator, a President and a Benefit Game
"This is fun," said Senator ALPHONSE D'AMATO, Republican of New York, trading one-liners with FRANK LAYDEN, president of the Utah Jazz.
"We have to keep politics out of this."
The Senator and Layden were speaking at a news conference at D'Amato's office in Manhattan, helping to promote tomorrow night's New York All-Star Basketball Classic.
Proceeds of the game, which will be played at Madison Square Garden between a team of local pros and a select squad of other pros, will be donated to Wheelchair Charities Inc..


Jericho Hoping It Will Become An Oasis Again
Some folks already know where Yasir Arafat will settle in Jericho if the ballyhooed agreement with Israel comes true and Palestinian self-rule begins here and in the Gaza Strip.
He will move from Tunis into the big white house with green trim, they say, the one that sits in relative isolation on a low hill and could be easily cordoned off.


Aldus Founder to Give Up Two Jobs
Paul Brainerd, the founder of the Aldus Corporation and the father of desktop publishing, said today that he planned to step down as president and chief executive but remain with the company by assuming the newly created position of chairman.
Mr.
Brainerd, who is 45, said in a telephone interview that he began planning this move two years ago, to coincide with Aldus's 10th anniversary this January.
Aldus said it had retained Heidrick &amp; Struggles, an executive search firm, to find a successor, and that Mr.
Brainerd would remain president and chief executive until a successor was found.
Aldus shares closed today at $17.75, up 75 cents, in Nasdaq trading.


Gene Experiment Offers Insight Into the Basis Of a Childhood Cancer
IN seeking to understand the role of genes thought to be essential to human health and development, many molecular biologists have lately turned to an approach they call mouse-knockout experiments.
Through an intricate series of manipulations, they breed mice that lack copies of the genes under study and then see how the rodents fare.
But as promising as the approach is in theory, in practice it has yielded many uninterpretable and frustrating results.
Sometimes the mice with the missing genes end up dying too early in embryonic development for scientists to figure out what went wrong, while in other cases the manipulated mice do just fine without the genes scientists had deemed necessary for survival.


Things Are Looking Up for Bluebirds
From March through November, Schoharie County is the bluebird capital of New York State.
"We fledge one-third of all the bluebirds in the state here," said Raymond Briggs, president of the New York State Bluebird Association.
The county, he added, had more bluebird nesting boxes and bluebirds than any other county in the state.


White Noise: Ranking the Talking Heads Who Follow the Bouncing Balls
Is there a worse sports broadcaster in New York than Carl White of WNYW-TV/Channel 5?
Can you go anywhere else and find someone who stumbles over his lines more or narrates highlights more ineptly than White?
Is there a better overall local talent or stronger personality than Bob Page of the MSG Network?
Yes, he's acerbic and unlikely to yuk it up, which hurts his likability quotient, but can you find someone who speaks his mind more openly and with more conviction than Page?


Riding a Beat, Tall in the Saddle
As a girl, Kathy Ryan loved anything and everything having to do with horses.
Her childhood in Brooklyn was filled with horse books and figurines, movies about horses, and calendars picturing appaloosas and palominos.
But it was not Brooklyn that kept her from actually getting in the saddle -- there are stables, after all, in Prospect Park.
Her father, then a battalion chief with the Fire Department, refused to let her ride until she was 18.
"My father believed it was a very dangerous sport," Ms.
Ryan said.
"He was protective."


Miriam I. Eolis, 80, Lawyer and Producer
Miriam Irene Eolis, a lawyer, accountant and theatrical producer, died Wednesday at St.

Gallego, Forgotten in April, Looks Toward October
Mike Gallego has that feeling again, a pennant race feeling.
It is a feeling that actually made Gallego dance while he fielded pre-game grounders Sunday in Cleveland, that made him donate a bat to a child wearing a Yankee cap and made him think that he could be playing important baseball games in October.
Gallego knows the feeling.
He played on pennant winners in Oakland for three straight years before joining the Yankees as a free agent 20 months ago.
He knows when it is appropriate to stare at the scoreboard to see whether Toronto is ahead and when he is better off staring at his shoelaces because it is premature.
Guess what?
Even Gallego has glanced up from his shoes lately.


The President of Visa U.S.A. Resigns in a Surprise Move
In a surprise move, the president and chief executive of Visa U.S.A., H. Robert Heller, said yesterday that he had resigned from the credit card organization.
Mr.

Visa U.S.A. is one of the five regional organizations under Visa International, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.


Federal Appeals Court Denies Bail To Officers in Rodney King Case
A Federal appeals court has denied bail to the two police officers convicted in the beating of Rodney G. King, confirming that they must begin their prison sentences in four weeks.

Talk, Talk, Talk
How many late-night talk shows can television bear?
Johnny Carson warned that half the people in the world would soon have their own, and he wasn't far from wrong.
For years, Mr.
Carson had the night pretty much to himself.
His replacement, Jay Leno, will soon be working in Grand Central Terminal by comparison.
With David Letterman, Chevy Chase and Conan O'Brien joining Mr.
Leno and Arsenio Hall, there'll soon be five hosts jawing through the night, with Mr.
Letterman, Mr.
Chase and Mr.
Leno all banging heads at once.
That's a lot of chat and channel-surfing.
Watch the skies for the vultures; they'll surely be circling soon.


Some Mets May Detour Off Team's Road to Nowhere
The Mets won't be in the post-season this year, but some of their current players might be.
They could know as early as today because the deadline to qualify for a post-season roster is midnight.
Teams contending for divisional titles will be checking the waiver wire to see who is available.
"We had a couple of calls today and a few discussions," Gerry Hunsicker, a Mets vice president, said last night before his team beat the Houston Astros, 5-4, with home runs from Ryan Thompson, Bobby Bonilla and Joe Orsulak.
"Something could happen by tomorrow night." He added that he wasn't overly optimistic.


One Marketing Unit at Coke
After years of having separate global and domestic marketing efforts, the Coca-Cola Company has combined its marketing division into one unit.
The consolidation was presented to senior Coca-Cola officials in a memorandum circulated through the Atlanta headquarters on Thursday by Sergio Zyman, who returned to the company last month as its first chief marketing officer.


Target Practice for Life As Human Cannonball
AS always, Laura Weiss had the jitters.
It did not matter that she had stood at this very control panel, her hands on the different colored levers, a thousand times before.
It was no consolation that the routine goes like clockwork, that legs had not been fractured or arms broken or vetebrae crushed.
No, nothing could soothe her nerves.
And maybe that was the way it had to be.
How would it look, after all, if Mrs.
Weiss had no qualms about shooting her husband out of a cannon?


Broken Ankle in Final-Day Saratoga Spill Ends Krone's Year
Julie Krone suffered multiple fractures of the right ankle today during a violent spill on the final day of Saratoga's racing season and was not expected to ride again for the rest of this year and possibly longer.
The 30-year-old jockey, a tiny dynamo who has won riding titles at Belmont Park, Monmouth Park, Atlantic City and the Meadowlands, also suffered severe cuts and bruises on her left elbow.
She underwent surgery at Saratoga Hospital to stabilize the ankle joint and will undergo more surgery in New York City to repair the fracture.


Where Bluebirds Fly


For Starters, It's Bledsoe and Mirer
First, Coach Tom Flores of the Seattle Seahawks learned that his starting quarterback would be a rookie, Rick Mirer of Notre Dame.
Yesterday, Coach Bill Parcells of the New England Patriots conceded that his starting quarterback would be a rookie, Drew Bledsoe of Washington State.
So when the National Football League season opens Sunday -- the Patriots against the Bills in Buffalo and the Seahawks against the Chargers in San Diego -- two rookies will start at quarterback against sophisticated defenses.
It is part heresy, part necessity and part history.


Mandela's Group Won't Punish Its Rights Abusers
The African National Congress issued a blanket apology today for torture, executions and other abuses committed in its exile camps during the guerrilla war against apartheid, but said it would not punish past human rights violators or pay compensation to the victims.
Responding to an independent report that detailed abuses and cited men who still hold positions in the organization, Nelson Mandela, the president of the congress, said it would be unfair to discipline those accused within the anti-apartheid movement when officials who committed atrocities in support of apartheid remain free.


Sony's Times Square Jumbotron has begun to attract advertisers.
ELABORATE billboards and electronic signs, from Pepsi-Cola's splashy waterfall to Coca-Cola's glitzy bottle, have long helped make Times Square a commercial showplace.
Now the cacophonous crossroads of the world is also becoming known as a place for showing commercials.
That's a result of the arrival three years ago at 1 Times Square -- site of the apple's descent on New Year's Eve -- of a Sony Jumbotron video screen, 23 1/2 feet wide by 4 stories, or 32 feet, high.


Global Mutual Funds Set Sales Record in July
Foreign stock mutual funds are all the rage, but the domestic variety seems to be attracting less money, according to figures released yesterday.
And while bond funds are taking in record amounts of money, market timers appear to be growing worried that interest rates may begin to rise.
"Investors are on vacation from U.S. equities and are traveling abroad," said Bruce Speca, a spokesman for the TNE Fund Group.
"The international equity market is just exploding."


Mirror of Divisions
After a bitterly divided New York City Board of Education ousted Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez in February in a fight over social issues, board members picked up the pieces and pledged to work together to choose his successor.
Now, six months later, as the board moves to appoint Ramon C. Cortines as the new chancellor, the chief policy making body for the nation's largest school system seems as divided as ever -- and divided into the same factions.


Rutgers' Fortay Loses Out Again
BRYAN FORTAY has lost another starting job at quarterback.
This time it's not at Miami, though.
Rutgers Coach DOUG GRABER yesterday gave Fortay the bad news, telling the senior that a sophomore, RAY LUCAS, will start for the Scarlet Knights in the season opener against Colgate on Saturday.
Fortay, who transferred from Miami more than two years ago after getting beat out for the starting job by GINO TORRETTA, shared the starting assignment with Lucas last season as Rutgers went 7-4.
With Fortay starting, Rutgers had a 5-2 record, but Lucas is considered more mobile.


Critic's Notebook; A Modern-Music Festival Asks: Who's Listening, and Why?
Not a bad sampling for one of this country's most important new-music festivals.
And if some musical styles were underrepresented -- the recent experimentation with vernacular forms, or samplings of new West Coast or Eastern European composition, for instance -- and if too many minor works were included, this was nevertheless an effective farewell for Oliver Knussen, the British composer who began directing the festival seven years ago.
Without becoming too clearly identified with any single school, he has given a fair hearing to all.
His tenure has been marked by notable highlights and has earned obvious respect from students and colleagues.


Limited Inc. to Close and Scale Back Stores
The Limited Inc. has had enviable success building specialty-apparel chains -- so successful that the chains eventually began competing for the same customers.
Yesterday, moving to address those problems, the Limited announced that it would close as many as 100 Lerner New York stores and shut, scale down or remodel 260 of its Limited stores.


Air France Discusses Its Creative Account
The American marketing operation of Air France said yesterday that it had been informally talking to agencies about the creative portion of its estimated $4 million account.
Nils Peyron, Air France's director of advertising and corporate communications in New York, said that the agencies he was discussing the assignment with included Ketchum Advertising in New York; Lois U.S.A. in New York; Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass., and Publicis in New York.


Russia to Complete Troop Pullout in Lithuania
After a brief dispute last week, Russia and Lithuania announced today that Russia would complete the withdrawal of its remaining 2,500 troops from the Baltic nation "in the nearest future," perhaps as soon as Tuesday.
President Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania said in a national radio address today that he had agreed in a telephone conversation with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to keep to the original schedule for withdrawal and to postpone negotiations on any compensation.


Air Force Drawing Flak Over 'SWAT Team' Plan
As part of its reorganization after the cold war, the Air Force is creating a set of quick-response wings to dispatch to world crises on a moment's notice.
But Congressional auditors say the new units will cost $200 million to field and add little in combat ability.
They have called on Defense Secretary Les Aspin to halt the plan until the Air Force conducts more studies.


Seeing and Imagining: Clues to the Workings Of the Mind's Eye
CLOSE your eyes and consider these questions: What shape are a German shepherd's ears?
Which is darker green: a frozen pea or a Christmas tree?
If you rotate the letter "N" 90 degrees to the right, is a new letter formed?
In seeking answers to such questions, scientists say, most people will conjure up an image in their mind's eye, mentally "look" at it, add details one at a time and describe what they see.
They seem to have a definite picture in their heads.


Basic Gear Gives Access To Network of Networks
Connecting to the global Internet is now within the reach of anyone with a personal computer and a communications device called a modem that connects directly to the telephone network.
The most basic Internet service is electronic mail, and many commercial on-line services now offer electronic mail gateways to the Internet.
An electronic letter sent from your on-line service will be automatically routed to any other Internet user anywhere in the world.
All of the leading on-line services -- including Compuserve, MCI Mail, America Online, Genie and Prodigy -- now offer Internet electronic mail as part of their basic service.
Pricing varies.
MCI Mail, for example, charges 50 cents per short message, in addition to a $35 annual fee.
America Online charges $9.95 as a monthly fee, which includes five hours of network time.


Take Firmer Line With China on Missiles; Deng's Three Wives
To the Editor:
"Life of Deng, by Daughter, Diverts China," your Aug. 18 dispatch from Beijing about the publication of Deng Xiaoping's biography by Deng Rong, the daughter of China's 89-year-old paramount leader, is right to correct the name of one of Mr.
Deng's wives, Zhang Xiyuan.
But it is wrong to state that "she divorced him in 1933 because he was in political disgrace."


Patterns
Squeeze on Young Designers
Most young designers were making about $14,000 a year in their first jobs as atelier assistants only a short time ago.
Now, they're expected to spend that much to rent a runway show space for an hour.
That's the estimated price for the small tent in Bryant Park, with the smaller Celeste Bartos Forum in the library going for about $10,000, when the Council of Fashion Designers of America organizes its first New York collections there in October.


Review/Fashion; Under a Sportswear Influence
Toss a tiny embroidered lace bolero over a halter-neck crepe jump suit -- or use it to decorate a stark black jersey dress.
Wear a striped silk sweater with a short black linen skirt for day or with navy faille "fancy pants" at night.
The idea of separates dressing is an old American fashion institution, but it has usually been confined to sportswear.
Now it is being integrated into the resort collections introduced this month by designers of the country's most expensive and prestigious lines.
It adds flexibility to clothes whose price tags run to four figures, and occasionally beyond.


Move Over, Gutenberg, for the Electronic Book; Computer Shopper
To the Editor:
"The Trials of Setting Up a New Home Computer" L. R. Shannon's humorous Aug. 17 column in Science Times, epitomizes what many a home computer shopper experiences when the long-awaited computer finally arrives: the initial, hard-to-conceal excitement at having bought a state-of-the-art blockbuster and, immediately following that, a deep sense of despair when the machine refuses to come to life at power-up.


Review/Pop; Musical Idioms From the Road To New Orleans
When Snooks Eaglin sings, he sounds casual, and his guitar solos never hurry.
But there's a steely intelligence and a sly sense of timing behind every note the New Orleans bluesman generates.
Mr.
Eaglin, who was born in 1936 and was blinded by glaucoma as an infant, has forged his own technique: he plays like two guitarists at once, picking out lead lines in between strummed rhythm-guitar chords.
While featuring songs from his current album, "Teasin' You" (Black Top/Rounder), he made his early set on Saturday night at Tramps a playful survey of down-home idioms from blues to swing to country to rhythm-and-blues, as he carried them all to New Orleans.


Where Politics and Poverty Intersect In Nicaragua, Signposts Are Missing
Like any Nicaraguan who is 73 years old, Juan Mayrena has known an unusual amount of revolution and war.
He says it is always the same.
"They kill the boys, then they come and dump their bodies here," he said.
But Mr.
Mayrena says he has never seen things as cruel as they have gotten on the sprawling hacienda that gives this hamlet its name, which means hope.


Transcripts In Bombing Are Debated
Defense lawyers and prosecutors in the case of the alleged plot to terrorize New York City offered a prelude yesterday to the kind of battle that will likely dominate the trial -- jousting over the merits of often elliptical conversations among defendants that were secretly recorded by a government informer.
At a bail hearing for one defendant, Mohammed Abouhalima, prosecutors argued that transcripts of those recordings show that the Mr.
Abouhalima, 29, an Egyptian, was part of a terrorist group that planned the assassination of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and trained for terrorist acts at a paramilitary camp.


Guess Names Specialty-Store Chief to Lead Its Retail Unit
Guess Inc., the apparel company that brought fashion to the jeans business, said yesterday that Bernard Zeichner, president and chief executive of the specialty store chain Contempo Casuals, would join the company to oversee retail operations.
Mr.

Union Settles on Ford as Target in Contract Talks
The United Automobile Workers union picked the Ford Motor Company today to be the lead company in negotiating a new basic labor contract with the Big Three auto makers.
In choosing the No. 2 auto maker over the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation, the union settled on the financially strongest American auto maker, indicating that it has little interest in giving back gains it has made on issues like health care benefits and job security.
That is bad news for G.M., which is in worse shape than Ford and had hoped to lead the negotiations, a position that might have allowed it to tailor the industry's contract to reduce its own burdens.
Resistance Expected at G.M.
Indeed, the selection of Ford caused some analysts today to predict that G.M., which can ill afford the new pension benefits or job-security provisions the union wants, will resist significant parts of whatever Ford and the union hammer out.
That could make it more difficult for the union to preserve its "pattern bargaining" tradition, and perhaps provoke a strike at G.M.


A Tough Time in the Mayoral Race Sloganeering
New York is a tough town, and it takes a tough media strategy to win a mayoral race in it -- so tough, apparently, that even your campaign slogan can be turned against you.
Mayor David N. Dinkins took to the airwaves Friday with commercials portraying him as a caring steward of a troubled city and ending with the tagline: "It takes more than tough talk to run a tough city."


Genetic Therapy Found For Dystrophy in Mice
IN what is being called a major step forward in the fight against muscular dystrophy, researchers have shown that gene therapy prevents muscle destruction and loss of muscle function in mice that carry the genetic flaws that cause two forms of the disease.
By inserting a gene for the protein dystrophin into mouse embryos that lacked a functioning form of the gene, the researchers, from the Universities of Michigan, Iowa and Washington, were able to correct the defect and cure the diseases.


GE Capital Set to Rescue GPA Group
The GPA Group P.L.C. expects to complete a deal within a few days under which it would be rescued from its financial difficulties by a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, aviation industry executives said today.
The executives said that on completion of the deal, to which the companies agreed in principle in May, Tony Ryan, GPA's founder and chairman, would relinquish his duties overseeing the finances of the aircraft-leasing company.
But they said he would be appointed chairman of a new company, GE Capital Aviation Management Ltd., which would be in charge of the commercial aircraft-leasing activities of both GPA and GE Capital, which is based in Stamford, Conn.


Koch Unbound; Musings on the Mayor's Race From a Not-So-Private Citizen
Sitting in a corner office on the 30th floor of a building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Edward Irving Koch, the master of the game, is watching the early skirmishes of the political melee that is the New York City mayoral race.
And he is grinning.
After a dozen years in the city's hottest seat, the man who became the epitome of New York's cranky style clearly delights in his ability to take the broadest of political potshots without fear of harmful ricochets.
So he kibitzes and philosophizes as he squints at the latest controversies and talks about a city "deteriorating in every way."


Science Takes a Lesson From Nature, Imitating Abalone and Spider Silk
INCREASINGLY, scientists designing new materials are looking to nature as a source of inspiration.
In their search for ways to make substances that are harder, stronger, lighter and more durable, they are mimicking nature and enhancing it.
Some scientists have discovered how to "petrify" wood to make it more resistant to pests, while others are duplicating the multilayered structure of seashells to make new ceramics that are tough without being brittle.
Still other researchers have recently made fundamental discoveries about spider web silk, capping decades of study and raising the hope of mass-producing threads stronger than Kevlar, the substance used to make bulletproof vests.
And scientists have begun studies of reindeer antlers to see why this tough, light material absorbs shock so well.

Q&amp;A
A Cat's Senses
Q.  When my cat stalks her prey, she opens her mouth and seems to pant. Why?
A.
Cats, like many other animals, have an extra olfactory organ, called the vomeronasal organ or Jacobson's organ, that helps them sense scents and excretions both from other cats and their prey.

Europe's Ryder Cup Wild Cards Picked
Two of three golfers picked yesterday for Europe's Ryder Cup team haven't won a tournament in 17 months.
The third made the team by only one stroke.
Chosen as wild cards by the captain, BERNARD GALLACHER, the Spanish pair of SEVE BALLESTEROS and JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL have formed a successful Ryder Cup partnership.
They've lost only once in 12 matches together at the biennial competition against the United States.

Thousands Flee Coast As Hurricane Nears
As Hurricane Emily bore down on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, 150,000 people there and in low-lying areas of the mainland fled westward in response to evacuation orders.
A hurricane warning was posted for 200 miles of seashore, from the Virginia border southward to halfway down the North Carolina coast.
Meteorologists said that the storm, still the mildest type of hurricane, was expected to shift to the north and that its center might get no closer than 50 miles east of the Outer Banks.

MIDEAST ACCORD: The First Step; More Realism Will Be Needed Before Pact Between Israelis and P.L.O. Is a Done Deal
The draft agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization is the Middle East equivalent of the fall of the Berlin wall -- seemingly irreconcilable foes, who demonized one another for decades, suddenly breaking down a barrier to peace few thought would ever be breached.
But as with the fall of the Berlin wall, this agreement is just the beginning of the reconciliation process, not the end of it.
It is a triumph of realism over fanaticism and political courage over political cowardice, but it cannot stand on its own.
Even more realism and courage will be required to translate this agreement in principle into a detailed and sustainable structure.


150,000 Flee as Hurricane Nears North Carolina Coast
Hurricane Emily bore down on the Outer Banks of North Carolina early today, and 150,000 people there and in low-lying areas of the mainland coast fled westward in response to an evacuation order on Monday by the authorities in four of the state's northern counties.
A hurricane warning was posted for 200 miles of seashore, from the Virginia border southward to a point roughly halfway down the North Carolina coast.
Forecasters said gales would probably begin buffeting the Outer Banks about midday today and be followed at nightfall by winds of hurricane force -- that is, sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour.

BOXING  A Strange First Defense for Morrison  After what may be the only heavyweight title fight in which the champion did not know the name of the challenger, Tommy Morrison was as confused as everyone else.
"I didn't know I was fighting whatshisname till I got out there," he said.
Morrison made a singularly bizarre defense of his World Boxing Organization crown last night, scoring a fourth-round technical knockout over Tim Tomashek, a flabby, last-minute replacement.
About an hour before the 12-round bout, Mike Williams withdrew, prompting his own manager to call him "yellow." Promoter Bob Arum said Williams refused to take the pre-fight drug test.
It was the first defense for Morrison (38-1), who is to fight Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council champion, in March.
He was hoping for a good fight before his hometown Kansas City fans.
"It's an odd feeling; it's a bad feeling," Morrison said.
"There's not much I can say. . . . At least it was not my fault."
Williams is a former sparring partner of Morrison's who lost to him in a fictionalized fight in the movie "Rocky V." "The official word is Mike turned yellow and left," Williams's manager, Bob Jordan, said.
After three rounds, the 28-year-old Tomashek's eyes were puffy and bruised and the ringside physician and referee would not allow him to continue.
Fans threw ice chips into the ring when the announcement of the technical knockout was made.
On the undercard, a former world champion, Iran Barkley of The Bronx, N.Y. stopped Dino Stewart, whose corner threw in the towel in the eighth round. (AP)


U.N. Aide Says Bosnia Mediators Oppose Changes in Partition Plan
Bosnian Muslims are to return to the bargaining table here on Tuesday, vowing to seek new concessions from their Serbian and Croatian enemies.
But a United Nations official gave them little hope today, noting that the international mediators were reluctant to renegotiate a peace plan drawn up 10 days ago.
The official, who briefed reporters on condition that his name not be used, said it might be possible "to fiddle a little bit here and there" with the draft peace agreement.
But he said the mediators felt that it would be "dangerous" if any of the parties arrived with a list of new demands.


By Design; The Velvet Touch
If you buy only one fashion item this fall, it should be velvet.
Just about anything velvet will do.
It's the fabric of the season, one easy step to being a la mode without breaking the bankroll.
The one piece might be a squishy hat, a long muffler, a beau brummel jacket to wear with your old flannels, or wide-legged pants to pair with a sweater.
The plush fabric comes in many guises.
Choose smooth cotton velveteen, shiny rayon or silk velvet, crinkly crushed velvet, delicate cut velvet, sexy stretch velvet or even knitted chenille.


Before We Set This Seagull Theory in Concrete
To the Editor:
"Protecting Water From the Birds" (editorial, Aug. 18) is restricted to a concern about the most efficient and inexpensive way to ban birds and their droppings from New York City reservoirs.
But no evidence has been presented that such "contamination" has resulted in clinical disease among New Yorkers.


Take Firmer Line With China on Missiles
To the Editor:
"U.S. Determines China Violated Pact on Missiles"(front page, Aug. 25) details the impending imposition of United States sanctions on China for its sale of M-11 missile technology to Pakistan.
Your report refers three times to the Missile Technology Control Regime as a "treaty," although it is actually an agreement that is not legally binding upon the nations that subscribe to its terms.


IMC Fertilizer
Shares of IMC Fertilizer fell after Dean Witter Reynolds cut its rating on the stock to neutral from buy.
The firm also forecast an IMC loss for the fiscal year ending next June because of weakening sales and prices, citing wet weather in the Midwest, which has delayed planting and lowered demand for fertilizers.


Teachers Approve a Tentative Contract
Mayor David N. Dinkins and the leaders of the union representing 65,000 public-school teachers said yesterday that they had reached a tentative agreement on a new four-year contract calling for raises averaging 9 percent over the length of the deal.
The tentative settlement, reached on the eve of both a new school year and the general election campaign, could help Mr.
Dinkins win the endorsement of the powerful union, the United Federation of Teachers.
Mr.
Dinkins was elected four years ago with the enthusiastic support of the union, which also represents 20,000 guidance counselors, teachers' aides, secretaries and other employees of the New York City school system.


With Gambling Expert in Capital, a Casino Rolls
As a boom in legalized gambling rolls across America, no politician has stepped up to the table with more prescience and gusto than Gov.
Edwin W. Edwards, a rather fabulous crapshooter who likes to risk $5,000 a roll in the casino and far more in the statehouse.
"Sounds like I won again," the gray-haired Governor declared with Cajun ease in his office this week.
He had just learned that his threat to throw the gambling issue back to the machinations of the Legislature had prodded an end to a profit-sharing dispute among gambling entrepreneurs, clearing the way for the world's biggest casino to be built in New Orleans.


Can Bonds Be a Man For All Seasons?
Today is the last day of August.
Tomorrow and Thursday are the first two days of September.
For the San Francisco Giants, though, the only relevant date is what month it is on Barry Bonds's calendar.
When the Giants played the Atlanta Braves in San Francisco last week, Bonds's calendar said it was October.
If it is still October these next three nights, the Giants will be in serious trouble in their effort to win the National League West championship.

A Lukewarm Opening Day For Tennis's Hottest Ticket
Under a deadening film of humidity, and under fire for a deadly opening-day program that was nearly seed-free, the United States Open got off to an inauspicious beginning yesterday.
Logical or not, United States Tennis Association officials maintained that their hands were tied because of tournament commitments preceding the Open made by many of the top players.
The U.S.T.A. constructed an opening program that managed to be anticlimactic unto itself and was unanimously described as the worst schedule in memory by players, officials and fans alike.


Chess
What would the players a half-century ago or earlier make of today's strategy?
At first glance, they would surely fail to comprehend it.
Chess, like any science based on constant experimentation, is constantly evolving.
Of course, geniuses like Emanuel Lasker, Jose Raul Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, Wilhelm Steinitz and Paul Morphy would surely catch on quickly and adapt to it.
A hurdle they might face arose in the game between the grandmasters Johann Hjartarson of Iceland and Zdenko Kozul of Bosnia in Round 6 of the International Chess Federation's interzonal tournament for world title aspirants in Biel, Switzerland, which concluded in early August.
