Sounds Around Town
'Songs of the 40's'
Phillip Officer, "Hit the Road to Dreamland: Songs of the 40's," Russian Tea Room, 150 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-0947.
In his memorable 1992 show devoted to the lyrics of E. Y. (Yip) Harburg, Phillip Officer displayed an emotional steadiness that was matched by his deep empathy with Harburg's populist sensibility.
Singing in a strong, serene baritone, Mr.
Officer never goes for melodrama or easy pathos.
Among the songs in his new show, in which he is accompanied by piano and violin, are "Look to the Rainbow," "This Time the Dream's on Me" and "My Foolish Heart," all ideal showcases for Mr.
Officer's no-frills soulfulness.
Shows are tonight at 9 and 11.
There is a $15 music charge and a $10 food and beverage minimum.
STEPHEN HOLDEN A Dual Talent
Annie Ross, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300.
One of the finest jazz singers of the 1950's, Annie Ross, now 63, has built a second career as a film actress.
And in Robert Altman's "Short Cuts," in which she plays a jazzy torch singer, her two careers finally mesh.
Ms.
Ross will be performing with a quartet that appears in the film, consisting of Terry Adams on piano, Bruce Fowler on trombone, Bobby Previte on drums and Greg Cohen on bass.
The set will feature torch songs from the movie written by Bono and the Edge, Doc Pomus and Dr.
John, and Elvis Costello, among others.
Also expect to hear Lambert, Hendricks and Ross favorites like "Twisted." Shows are tomorrow at 8 and 11 P.M.
Tickets are $15.

Peteski Going South To Bring Title North
Is this the year you can swoop down on the Breeders' Cup and strike gold in horse racing?
A lot of people think so, including the racing officials at Santa Anita, where the $10 million day of seven races will be staged Nov. 6.
They believe this year's championships are so wide open that even racing owners from abroad won't be stopped by the memory of last fall's Breeders' Cup.
That's when 40 horses from Europe took a turbulent trans-Atlantic flight to Florida, and went home with nothing but agita after a week of high heat and humidity.


Turgeon's Still in Doubt For Opener
Still suffering from a sore left wrist, Pierre Turgeon continued to skate alone on Long Island Thursday while his Islander teammates continued their exhibition season with a game at San Jose.

Braves to Giants: The Key's in the Mailbox, Come On In
San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker was in a continuous state of applause tonight.
First, the Atlanta Braves' score came in, then some Giants runs came in and then the National League West standings came in: A first-place tie.
The Giants wish Bill Swift could pitch every day, but every fourth day will do for now.
Swift (21-8) tossed a two-hitter before leaving in the eighth inning, his teammates fortunately found Los Angeles shortstop Jose Offerman and San Francisco had a compact 3-1 victory before 36,409 at Dodger Stadium.


When a Continent Moves, Houses Fall and Many Die
The Indian earthquake and its devastation are rooted in the slow collision of the Indian subcontinent with the Asian landmass, which created the Himalaya Mountains and causes residual tensions in the Indian tectonic plate that are periodically released in bursts of violent energy.

Lynn R. Sykes, a geologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y.
"Compared to similar areas, it has one of the higher rates of seismic activity."

'De Kooning-Dubuffet: The Late Works'
Pace Gallery  32 East 57th Street, Manhattan  Through Oct. 16
The history of art has contributed its share to the mythology of aged geniuses whose last years were pinnacles of achievement (Titian, for instance).
Neither Willem de Kooning nor Jean Dubuffet can fairly be added to that list.
This ambitious exhibition, a follow-up to one three years ago at Pace that combined depictions of women by the same two artists, tries to argue the case.
There may be better late de Koonings than the ones here, but to judge from what is on view, much of which is borrowed from museum collections, Mr. de Kooning and Dubuffet each conform more to the model of Picasso, whose late paintings are often better and more substantial than common wisdom has it without rising to the levels he achieved in his earlier years.

William L. Hawkins
Ricco/Maresca Gallery  152 Wooster Street (near Houston Street)  SoHo  Through Oct. 23
William L. Hawkins was a self-taught artist from Kentucky who died in 1990 at the age of 94.
He began producing a solid body of paintings only in the 10 years before his death.
By that time, he had amassed a vast collection of images clipped from magazines and newspapers, examples of which he often put directly into his paintings.

Although he was certain to be the Devils' top goaltender the moment Craig Billington was traded in June, there has been nothing lackadaisical about the way Chris Terreri has approached the job since the first day of training camp.
"I haven't been this excited to play in a long time, and I have no trouble pushing myself to the limit," Terreri said.
"I think it's the responsibility of everyone to push to the limit, even those who are more or less guaranteed a place on the team."

Snapshots From Mets' Blight Album
The Shea Stadium clubhouse was being unpacked and unloaded.
Evacuated, really.
But for the Mets, of course, there were some things that couldn't be buried deep enough in bags -- images, memories, singular snapshots of comedy or despair or embarrassment.
How about Anthony Young's 27 straight defeats or, perhaps more to the absurd point, his one victory?
How about General Manager Al Harazin saying he deplores scapegoating one breath after announcing that he'd just fired Jeff Torborg with nearly three seasons left on the manager's contract?


At This Firm the Clients Hire Inside Consultants
What's a gaggle of recent business school graduates doing at a corporate-litigation law firm like Bickel &amp; Brewer?
Analyzing cases, poring over documents, choreographing evidence for jury presentation -- in short, doing much of the pretrial preparation that lawyers generally hand over to outside consultants.
Oh, and not so incidentally, saving clients money, lots of money, says William A. Brewer 3d, co-founder of the Dallas-based firm.
"We saved one client, Bellcore, some $100,000 in a telecommunications patent dispute," he said.
"We saved American Medical International Inc., a hospital corporation, $200,000 in a dispute with Creighton University in Omaha. And there was $500,000 in savings for Robert Woolley, chairman of a hotel properties group, in a dispute involving the Embassy Suites hotel chain."

Criticism of Raid Heartens Cult Members
While the Treasury Department's review was categorical in condemning the mistakes by top officials in charge of the Feb. 28 raid on the Branch Davidian compound, the impact on the coming trial of 11 cult members accused of murdering Federal agents was the subject of sharp dispute today.
Lawyers for some of the surviving Branch Davidians were quick to predict that the Treasury review's general depiction of Government failures, confusion and lies would bolster the Branch Davidians' case that bullets fired by cult members during the shootout came in self-defense.
Four agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were killed in the shootout and 20 injured.

U.S. Seeks Less Risk In Pensions
Seeking better protection for the retirement benefits of millions of American workers, the Clinton Administration proposed legislation today to strengthen the Government's system of pension insurance by requiring companies with insufficient funds in their pension plans to make larger insurance contributions.
"The financial future of many American workers and retirees may be at risk because their pensions are underfunded," Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, said at a briefing to explain the proposal, developed by a task force he appointed soon after taking office early this year.


Critic's Notebook; A No-Apologies Woman for the 90's: Harlow
JEAN HARLOW represented everything that straitlaced 1930's America was supposed to despise.
She played platinum-haired prostitutes, gold diggers and other trashy types with no apologies.
In "Red-Headed Woman," she strategically places a picture of her rich, married boss under her garter and says, "It'll get me more there than it will hanging on the wall." In "Red Dust," she decides to take a bath in a rain barrel, the better to get Clark Gable's attention.
And in "Hold Your Man," she fights a rival for Gable's affections by belting the other woman with a left to the jaw, twice.
Yet in her seven-year career, Harlow was wildly popular with both men and women, who found more to envy than to scorn.
The Harlow retrospective that begins today at the Film Forum is a vastly entertaining reminder of a brief and fascinating career, one that ended when Harlow died of kidney failure in 1937, at 26.
And the series suggests something more.
Harlow's garishly dyed hair, pencil-thin eyebrows and heavy eye makeup mark her as a sex symbol left over from the day before yesterday.
Yet in film after film she sails into the present carrying along her most prized and timeless possessions: a clear conscience and a sense of humor.
Harlow was an exaggerated symbol of what middle-class America wouldn't dare embrace in real life: sex without guilt.
In the AIDS-aware 90's, the allure of that persona and the wit with which she brought it off hit with the fresh force they must have had five decades ago.

Review/Theater; Theirs Is A Marriage Made on Broadway
It's not quite a half-century yet, but who's counting?
Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson -- stage partners for 48 years, husband and wife for 46 -- have had a full life in the theater.
They met while performing in a Tennessee Williams one-act play ("This Property Is Condemned") and more than four decades later are still together on and Off Broadway.
After a detour to Hollywood, they always came back to New York, or signed up for a new hitch on the legitimate theater's dwindling road.
There's no long-running sitcom in either of their Who's Whos.
"In Persons" is the Wallachs' casual stroll down memory lane.
At the tiny Kaufman Theater, which one imagines to be smaller than their living room in real life, they reminisce, perform excerpts from favorite past productions, make mild personal confessions (Miss Jackson tends to lose her eyeglasses) and celebrate their marriage.

Consultant Buys the Shop
If Terrance Brennan ever comes walking into your restaurant looking for a job, you may want to show him the door.
Less than three months after being hired by Guy Pascal as the consulting chef at Brasserie Pascal, 35 West 64th Street in Manhattan, Mr.
Brennan bought the restaurant.
"It was an amicable arrangement," Mr.
Brennan said.
He has closed the restaurant and is redecorating it with textured stucco walls and darker wood trim for a more rustic look in keeping with his concept, a contemporary Mediterranean restaurant.
It will be called Picholine (which is a kind of olive) and should open in about two weeks.
Mr.
Brennan, who has been the chef at Prix Fixe and Steak Frites, had been looking to open his own place since the spring.


USAir Plans 2,500 Layoffs By Mid-1994
The effort by many major airlines to shrink and restructure themselves to a profitable core continued yesterday with USAir's announcement that it would eliminate 2,500 jobs by mid-1994.
Underscoring the challenge facing USAir, the company also said it expects a pretax loss for the third quarter of roughly $180 million and a net loss for the year.
Most if not all major carriers except USAir are expected to report a profit for the third quarter.
USAir has not reported profits since the second quarter of 1989.


Sarajevo May Be Settling Into Stalemate
Sporadic artillery bursts from Serbian positions exploded around Sarajevo today, but there was no sign of a major assault despite warnings from Serbian nationalists that they would resume their bombardments when the Muslim-led Government rejected an international peace plan.
Reports from elsewhere in Bosnia indicated that Serbian forces had continued attacks near Tesanj and Maglaj, in north-central Bosnia, but that Serbian units in other areas mostly honored a cease-fire drawn up two weeks ago.

Hillary Clinton Raises Tough Question of Life, Death and Medicine
Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she hoped the nation would engage in a serious discussion about what is appropriate medical care in cases where very expensive treatments do nothing for the patient's quality of life.
The First Lady, completing her testimony before the Senate Finance Committee -- her fifth Congressional hearing in three days on the President's health care proposals -- was prodded by Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri.
He asked her whether the system would have "somebody at some level in a position to say no."

U.S. Blockade of Workers Enrages Mexican Town
For years, as thousands of undocumented workers floated openly across the Rio Grande each day from this sprawling border metropolis to jobs in El Paso, Tex., illegal immigration became a symbol of tolerance, even brotherhood, between the two cities.
That immigration agents stopped relatively few of the nannies and gardeners and busboys was taken as a sign that Ciudad Juarez and El Paso understood each other's needs.
Federal law, it seemed, was no match for the forces of economic interdependence.


Quake in India Levels Villages and Kills Thousands
The most devastating earthquake in India in more than 50 years rocked a remote sugar-cane-growing region of central India early this morning, killing thousands, Indian officials and Government news reports said.
Twelve thousand people were feared trapped in the rubble of their homes.
Estimates of the dead and injured varied widely.
Late this evening the Government-controlled Press Trust of India reported that more than 6,500 people had died, but the inaccessibility of many villages and the extent of destruction suggested that the figure was far from final.


Martin Marietta to Eliminate 11,000 Jobs
The Martin Marietta Corporation, which last year bought the General Electric Company's aerospace electronics division, said yesterday that it would close 12 production sites and eliminate 11,000 jobs nationwide this year to consolidate the two businesses.
The move, which had been expected for months, is the latest sign that the pain and layoffs of a shrinking weapons industry are far from finished.
The announcement came the same day large layoffs were announced in the airline and hazardous-waste disposal industries.  [ Page D3. ]


Review/Film Festival: Short Cuts; Altman's Tumultuous Panorama
THE night skies over Los Angeles, which is in a medfly siege of bibical proportions, are filled with helicopters flying in formation as they indiscriminately spray everything below: people, swimming pools, royal palms, trailer parks, stretch limos, possibly also medflies and their larvae.
The helicopters menace as they pretend to protect.
Their rotors chop the air and puncture the eardrums.
With bright red and green wing lights ablink, the machines have the cold precision of android policemen, waggishly festooned.
These images and sounds usher the audience into the world of Robert Altman's big, tumultuous, very fine new film, "Short Cuts," which opens the 31st New York Film Festival tonight at Lincoln Center.
The film will be shown at 7:30 at Alice Tully Hall and at 8 P.M. at Avery Fisher Hall, and begins its commercial run on Sunday in Manhattan.


2 Parties, 1 Goal
With each passing year, fewer members of Congress are willing to work with their colleagues in the opposing party.
Those who do are met with increasing criticism and suspicion in their own party caucuses.
The culmination of this 20-year trend was passage of the budget without a single vote in Congress from the opposition party.
Party and partisanship have become more important than policy and partnership.
If this pattern is allowed to continue, no one has more to lose than President Clinton.
He was elected as a centrist, a "new kind of Democrat." But he cannot succeed as a centrist if the Administration continues to follow a "Democrats only" strategy.
Swings to the left, necessary for votes in the House, will only shrink the President's political base and damage his credibility.


Safety Over Nostalgia: New Bike-Helmet Law
THOSE of us who grew up in the 60's remember the dead-girl songs on the radio, the drag races, the close calls, the black-bordered "In Memoriam" pages in the back of our yearbooks, the football hero who never walked again.
Turn back a few more years, and we remember our first taste of dangerous speed, those heavy single-speed Columbias, bikes with as much chrome as our father's Chevys.
We had to pump hard to get them going, and then we stood on the pedals and jammed the brake even harder, to see who could leave the longest skid mark.
We crashed, we got up, we picked gravel out of our knees and knuckles.
We dreamed of GTO's.

In Shift, Massachusetts Governor Backs Gun Law
With voters growing increasingly fearful of gunfire on the streets, Gov.
William F. Weld of Massachusetts reversed course this week and proposed some of the most stringent gun control laws in the country.

His proposed legislation would also limit the number of handguns an individual could buy and would impose tough penalties for illegal gun sales and gun-related crimes.

Jane, a middle-aged delegate from the Midlands, recalls Labor Party conferences of the mid-1980's with nostalgia.
Those were the days.
The party had a red flag.
The speeches were fire and brimstone.
And the enemy was clear: the banks and boardrooms of the Tories and their lackeys in Parliament.
The internecine battles as the party veered leftward were fierce.
"Ah, a real blood bath it was," said Jane, who asked that her last name be withheld in deference to her union's commandment to steer clear of the press.
"We had real Socialists then -- militants. Not like these here today. I call 'em plastic Tories." She gave out a dismissive laugh.

"The financial future of many American workers and retirees may be at risk because their pensions are underfunded," Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, said.  [ Page D1. ]
Personal income rose strongly in August, and a measure of joblessness edged down last week -- two indications that the economy is doing better than during the first half of the year.

Theory vs. Practice; Clinton's Stated Foreign Policy Turns Into More Modest 'Self-Containment'
The contrast between the theory and practice of the Clinton Administration's foreign policy has never been more starkly apparent than in recent days.
In a series of four speeches this month, Secretary of State Warren Christopher; the national security adviser, Anthony Lake; the delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, and President Clinton himself laid out their "vision" of America's post-cold-war foreign policy.
At its core was the idea that the old policies of containment of Communism should be replaced by a new policy of enlargement of the family of free-market democracies.

Its curriculum, according to school officials, "presupposes that God impressed upon His creation an objective order that man is bound to obey." All classes begin with as much as 10 minutes of prayer.
Every three years, faculty members must acknowledge by contract that they have a "personal relationship" to Jesus Christ; every year, they must subscribe to a seven-point "statement of faith" and are expected to leave if they cannot comfortably do so.

Ty Cobb Batted Here (and Struck Out)
His eyesight has faded a bit over 102 years, and when you ask Chet Hoff a question these days, you have to speak up.
But when he answers there is thunder in his voice, and when he grasps your hand after a ceremony in a hospital garden in upper Manhattan, the full, surprising force of his arthritic grip makes it easier to appreciate an unlikely historic fact:
It was on this very ground 82 years ago this month that this lively little man with snow-white hair took the mound for the Yankees against the Detroit Tigers and fanned Ty Cobb with three pitches, the last a roundhouse curve that caught Cobb looking as it cut across the center of the plate.


Reviews/ Film; An Idyll Shattered By Rape and Murder
"Malice" could turn out to be the new season's pop mystery-suspense melodrama you won't want to miss.
The film is deviously entertaining from its start through its finish, when most such movies go as irretrievably to pieces as Margo's face at the end of "Lost Horizon." "Malice" stays the course.
If it were a car, it could be called a mean machine.
Though light of weight, it hugs the road around every hairpin curve in its cruel and twisty narrative.
Cruel?

TV Weekend; A Perpetual Outsider and a New Host
Russell Baker makes his entrance as the new host of "Masterpiece Theater" on Sunday evening at 9 with a 90-minute BBC drama called "Selected Exits." The New York Times columnist clearly has no intention of shucking his piquant sense of humor.
"Selected Exits" is adapted by Alan Plater from a memoir by Gwyn Thomas, a crusty Welsh writer and raconteur who died in 1981 at 67.
Established as a writer of novels, short stories and plays, Mr.
Thomas became a television celebrity in the 1960's on the BBC talk show "The Brains Trust." That's when this dramatization begins, with Anthony Hopkins grumblingly playing the wittily provocative Thomas.
"All writers are liars," he declares, explaining that the lie is a compulsory social tactic.
Then, with Hopkins assuming the role of narrator, the story goes back to Thomas's adolescence in South Wales.

Reviews/ Film; In a Scary Future, Babies Who Decline to Be Born
Could the world be so terrible that in the near future unborn babies refuse en masse to leave their mothers' wombs?
That is the bizarre supposition of Marion Hansel's deadly earnest film, "Between Heaven and Earth," which opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse.
An uneasy hybrid of science fiction and medical information, the movie follows the mood swings of Maria (Carmen Maura), a television journalist in her 40's who becomes pregnant after a one-night encounter with a man in a stalled elevator.


QVC Is Seen as Ready To Prove Bid Financing
QVC Network Inc., the home shopping service, may present Paramount Communications as early as today with proof of QVC's ability to pay a $9.8 billion bid for Paramount, two executives close to QVC said yesterday.
An executive close to the talks said Chemical Bank had agreed to assemble a syndicate of banks that would lend QVC $3 billion.


How Death Penalty Has a Deterrent Effect
To the Editor:
"In Texas, the Death Penalty Still Fails to Deter" (letter, Sept. 19) by David Leven requires an answer because it is wrongheaded in several respects and repeats errors that appear quite often.


For a 60's Radical, Temper Justice With Mercy; Our Vietnam Blunder
To the Editor:
You are to be commended for "Now Shake Hands With Vietnam" (editorial, Sept. 17).
This gesture is long overdue, especially now that we have an evaluation from our former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm.
William Crowe Jr., telling us that Vietnam was "a war in which neither America's survival nor its future was at stake." In my vocabulary that is close to admitting Washington was wrong to get involved in Indochina, especially with our absymal ignorance of the territory.


Magazine Honors Ramirez
Although outfielder Manny Ramirez has struggled with major league pitching since joining the Indians last month, he accomplished plenty in the minors this year.
Enough, in fact, to be named minor league player of the year yesterday by Baseball America magazine.
Ramirez, a 21-year-old Dominican immigrant who has become a hero in the Washington Heights section of upper Manhattan, won the Class AA Eastern League batting title while with Canton-Akron, where he hit .340 with 17 home runs with 79 runs batted in before his promotion to Class AAA Charlotte in mid-July.
In only 144 at-bats at Charlotte, he hit .317 with 14 homers and 36 r.b.i.

Judith Joy Ross
James Danziger Gallery  130 Prince Street (near Wooster Street)  SoHo  Through Oct. 23
Like a post-office display of mug shots, Judith Joy Ross's portraits of visitors to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington ring the walls of a small room in this gallery's new space.
The portraits, taken in 1983 and '84, have a shallow focus and purplish color that give their subjects a dreamy, intense air.

Taylor Gives Coaches His Support
Lawrence Taylor talked today about The Program.
Not the movie, but the seemingly new and improved New York Giants.
He gave Coach Dan Reeves and his staff another stamp of approval.
Unlike last season, he doesn't foresee any player mutinies.
Unlike last year, when things started going bad and players began bad-mouthing the coaches at every turn, Taylor thinks that a sudden string of losses wouldn't trigger a rush of complaints.
Knock on wood.

American Relief Worker Killed in Bosnia


For a 60's Radical, Temper Justice With Mercy
To the Editor:
I was moved by your Sept. 16 and 17 front-page articles on the voluntary surrender to the police by Katherine Ann Power after 23 years underground as an anti-war radical wanted for bank robbery.
Your sympathetic study of how a middle-class college girl got caught up in the 1960's guerrilla youth struggle against an unending Vietnam War evoked an era.


COMPANY BRIEFS
QUANTUM CHEMICAL CORP., New York, said its shareholders had approved a $3.3 billion buyout by Hanson P.L.C.


Abroad at Home; The Price of Surrender
By rejecting terms for the dismemberment of their country, members of the Bosnian Parliament have given the West a last chance to understand the consequences of its policy there: a chance to draw back from folly and danger.
What is the policy?
For months now, however clothed, it has been to accept the ethnic partition of Bosnia.
Western publics as well as the Bosnians have been told in effect that partition is inevitable.

Dinkins on Giuliani: Accentuating the Negative
ON THE SCREEN
Color photograph of facade of the United States Justice Department with an inset of Rudolph W. Giuliani, followed by a series of unflattering black and white photos of Mr.
Giuliani.
As a male narrator's voice is heard over ominous music, blocks of text scroll on the screen repeating his words.
At the end, a final question freezes on the screen, with a big picture of Mr.
Giuliani and a small picture of Mayor David N. Dinkins, noting his campaign paid for the ad.
PRODUCER
Doak Shrum Harris Carrier Devine of Washington. THE SCRIPT
Mr.
Giuliani was the Associate Attorney General, the No. 3 post in Justice, in the early Regan Administration, and the department was widely criticized on the issues the ad cites.
In 1983, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee against a ban on armor-piercing bullets, arguing that it was impossible to cover all kinds capable of penetrating a bullet-proof vest "without being overinclusive," and proposed instead mandatory five-year sentences for the use of such bullets in the commission of Federal crimes.
In 1981, he called proposed gun-control laws that would impose waiting periods for handgun purchases "sensible and moderate" but more recently has said gun control laws are not especially effective.
Roughly 10 percent of the laywers Mr.
Giuliani hired as United States Attorney in Manhattan were black or Hispanic, comparable to the hiring in the city's Law Department at the time but roughly one-third the average level of hiring there since Mr.
Dinkins took office.
Many defense lawyers accused Mr.
Giuliani of excessive zeal in his years as United States Attorney, Federal judges several times cited him or his office for "overzealousness" and some of his most celebrated prosecutions ended in acquittals or reversals on appeal.
SCORECARD
This ad, unusually pointed for a low-key politician like Mr.
Dinkins, is part of his campaign's continuing effort to paint Mr.
Giuliani as a hard-hearted Reaganaut, unyielding and out of step with the liberal swing voters who are likely to help decide the election.
It spans issues that have long been liberal touchstones.
Virtually all the stands it cites predated the 1989 mayoral campaign, and were issues four years ago, but the Mayor's camp argues that Mr.
Giuliani's record is little known or understood by most New Yorkers and must be attacked.
The intent of the ad is to make the whole of Mr.
Giuliani's sometimes shifting stands greater than the sum of its parts, though voters may find some of his past positions only marginally relevant to the next Mayor's job.
TODD S. PURDUM


Corrections
A report in the Currents column in The Home Section yesterday, about three new furniture stores in SoHo, omitted the address of one of them, GVG Editions, and the price of a rug on sale there.
GVG is at 97 Wooster Street, near Spring Street, and the rug, shown in the photograph, costs $3,200.
The report also misspelled the name of the artist who painted the rug.
He is Michael Stromar.


Standoff Ends With Arrests And Freedom For Hostages
Two robbers, lying in wait outside a tiny bank branch in Park Slope, Brooklyn, accosted three bank workers as they arrived for work yesterday and held them hostage in a nerve-racking standoff with the police that lasted all day, law-enforcement officials said.
The impasse was resolved just before 8 P.M., when a security guard -- the last of the three hostages -- was released unharmed.
Police officers and F.B.I. agents finally relaxed, slapping one another's backs and shaking hands in congratulation.


COMPANY NEWS: Skirmish of Screen Savers; Toaster-Blasting Penguin And Parody Go to Court
Opus the Penguin, of "Outland" and "Bloom County" fame, is in trouble again.
This time for shooting at flying toasters.
The cartoonist Berke Breathed has moved his iconoclastic comic strip characters into the competitive world of computer screen savers.
The Opus 'N Bill program, distributed by Delrina Inc. of Toronto, parodies a number of sacred cows, including President Clinton; the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, and even Socks, the Presidential cat.


Mademoiselle Names a New Editor in Chief
Elizabeth Crow, who resigned last month as president, chief executive and editorial director of Gruner &amp; Jahr USA Publishing, was named editor in chief of Mademoiselle yesterday.
She will replace Gabe Doppelt, who resigned Wednesday after differences with officials at Conde Nast Publications, the parent company, about how the magazine should evolve.
Ms.
Doppelt, a former editor at Vogue, was brought in a year ago today to enliven Mademoiselle and make it more relevant for hip women in their 20's.


It's Official: Becker Out of Davis Cup
BORIS BECKER confirmed yesterday that he won't play in Germany's Davis Cup final against Australia in December.
"I'll keep my fingers crossed for our team," he said.
Becker said last January that he didn't want to play in the event this year, but there had been speculation he might change his mind. (AP)

On My Mind; New York to Clinton
President Clinton came to New York, carried out his political assignment and departed happy and smiling, leaving lots of the people who happen to live here angrier, surlier, more paranoid, more disgusted with politicians than ever.
In this city, that is not easy to do, in just one night's work.
Mr.
Clinton accomplished all this by talking about race and politics and telling only part of the story, the platitude part.
New Yorkers know the rest, know he knows, and he should avoid treating them as idiots.


Empire Blue Cross Shuns Rate Increase
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, New York State's largest health insurer, said yesterday that because of better-than-expected financial results, it would not impose a previously approved rate increase that was scheduled to go into effect at the beginning of next year.
The state Superintendent of Insurance, Salvatore R. Curiale, had cautioned Empire last month that he would sue if Empire tried to collect the increase, which was the last phase of a 25 percent series of increases granted last year.


Battle for The Post: Worker vs. Worker
After not publishing for three days, The New York Post came back to life as the paper's production unions broke ranks with the striking Newspaper Guild and returned to work.
The return of the Post signaled yet another victory on the labor front for Rupert Murdoch, who managed to isolate the Guild from The Post's other unions.
The production workers said they could not afford to side with the striking news, advertising and circulation workers because it could cost their jobs.


Whitman Says Florio Policies Led to Crime
Christine Todd Whitman's campaign for governor took on a sharper edge today as she attacked Gov.
Jim Florio for failing to stem the tide of violent crime in New Jersey.
At a news conference called to announce her own proposals for reforming New Jersey's criminal-justice system, Mrs.
Whitman said that not only had Mr.
Florio failed to halt violent crime, he had actually contributed to it.
Trying to link crime to the issue of economic growth, Mrs.
Whitman said Mr.
Florio's economic policies had cost New Jersey residents thousands of jobs.
The loss of jobs, she said, has, in turn, fostered the spread of crime.


Timothy Gordon; Actor, 71
Timothy Gordon, the founder of the S.R.O.
Hotel Touring Players and an actor who took theater to shelters for the homeless in New York City, died on Monday at Concord Hospital in Concord, N.H.
He was 71 years old and lived in Pembroke, N.H.
The cause was pneumonia, said his sister, Teresa Heywood of Salem, N.H.
Mr.
Gordon worked for many years as an actor in television soap operas and on theatrical tours.
He created the S.R.O. group in 1979, he said, to take to "people who have no magic, and actors have magic at their fingertips."





Hillary Clinton Raises Tough Question of Life, Death and Medicine
Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she hoped the nation would engage in a serious discussion about what is appropriate medical care in cases where very expensive treatments do nothing for the patient's quality of life.
The First Lady, completing her testimony before the Senate Finance Committee -- her fifth Congressional hearing in three days on the President's health care proposals -- was prodded by Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri.
He asked her whether the system would have "somebody at some level in a position to say no."


Seduction and the Impossible Dream
The film version of "M. Butterfly" introduces a critically important new element into David Henry Hwang's play: the camera.
The artifice that was possible on stage, in Mr.
Hwang's daring, multi-faceted meditation on the love affair between a French diplomat and the Chinese transvestite he mistakenly believed was a woman, is simply out of the question on screen.
For some film makers that might constitute an insurmountable problem, but this "M. Butterfly" is the work of David Cronenberg ("Dead Ringers," "Scanners," "Naked Lunch").
Mr.
Cronenberg's idea of a dramatically viable situation is a man's metamorphosing into a giant fly ("The Fly").


Powell Retires With Presidential Medal of Freedom
Gen.
Colin L. Powell, who defined American post-cold-war military doctrine, retired yesterday at Fort Myer, Va.

Cuban Officials Don't Foresee a Thaw With the U.S. Anytime Soon
Despite recent agreements with Washington on immigration and narcotics matters, senior Cuban officials say they do not foresee any imminent advance in relations with the United States, which have been marked by open hostility for 34 years.
Instead, the Cuban officials say, they hope that by cooperating in areas of mutual interest, the Clinton Administration will eventually strike a more positive attitude toward Cuba as it gains a stronger political foothold for itself.


Jets Are Content to Leave The Bulldozing to Baxter
Boomer Esiason knows that if the Jets are going to beat the defensive-minded Philadelphia Eagles (3-0) on Sunday, they will almost certainly need to pick up short yardage in critical situations.
"Sometimes, that's the most difficult yardage to overcome," the Jets quarterback said today.
"Especially against a team like Philadelphia, which has so much talent on defense."

Colin Powell, Who Led U.S. Military Into a New Era, Resigns
Gen.
Colin L. Powell, who defined the United States' post-cold-war military doctrine, retired today as popular with America's armed forces as with the average American who never served in harm's way.
That appeal, which has drawn speculation that the final chapter in General Powell's soldier-statesman career may yet be written in the White House, derives from his commitment to the armed services as well as to his stature as the first black to serve as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.


Dow Drops 11.18 Points to Close at 3,555.12
The stock market turned in a mixed session yesterday, after suffering a little when a series of relatively good economic reports caused bonds to slide and bond-market performance affected stocks.
Technology stocks continued a retreat begun this week after a strong run-up, but beyond that there were few clear indications of what investors think about the economy or about the markets.


Murdoch Gets The Post Out Despite Strike
Three days after a strike stopped its presses, Rupert Murdoch's New York Post roared back to life last night, with a new issue of the paper on New York streets and a new victory against newspaper unions on Mr.
Murdoch's resume.
With the cooperation of the leaders of The Post's production unions, whose members had spontaneously supported the striking employees of the New York Newspaper Guild on Monday, Mr.
Murdoch managed to isolate the striking union and demonstrate his dominance over the others.
Through the day, the production union leaders walked many of their members through the picket lines as the strikers yelled picket-line epithets like "scab" and "traitor."


Reed Wants Schintzius to Remain a Net
If Nets General Manager Willis Reed has his way, reserve center Dwayne Schintzius will not be headed to the Milwaukee Bucks in the next two weeks.
"You can't say it's a done deal, but you can say Willis Reed will recommend to our owners that we match the offer, probably at a meeting tomorrow," Reed said yesterday after suddenly being forced to put the Schintzius contract on the front burner when the Bucks submitted a three-year, $4.8 million offer sheet to the free agent late Wednesday.


Derailment in Bronx Snarls Morning Commute for Metro-North Passengers


Tasting and Toasting Connecticut Wines
IN Robert Frost's poem "Mending Wall," we're told that good fences, the historic boundaries of New Englanders' farmland and the expression of their personal reserve, make good neighbors.
In Connecticut vineyards, where the autumn foliage will soon go red and gold, the piled-up stones also symbolize the grit and patience that go into making good white wines, the state's strong suit.
Wines from Connecticut?
Absolutely.
And the best are as polished as the fieldstone walls at most of the five top wineries are crude.


Corrections
An article yesterday about a New Jersey trial in a 1992 strangling misstated the Italian word for "now," which the defendant reportedly said at the time of the slaying.
It is "adesso," not "odessa."


Harold Zarowitz, 70, An Expert on Diabetes
Dr.
Harold Zarowitz, a pioneer in the treatment of diabetes in the New York area, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan.
Dr.
Zarowitz, a tive and resident of Brooklyn, was 70.
The cause of death was complications from diabetes, said his son, Ronald.
He said his father had been insulin-dependent from age 18.


Manufacturers Quit a Project For Pay Toilets
A plan to put 30 public toilets with advertising kiosks in New York City parks was hobbled yesterday when two leading operators withdrew their names from the search.
The operators, J. C. Decaux U.S.A. and Gannett Outdoor New York, both said that the city's limit of two ad kiosks for every toilet would not generate enough revenue for a private concessionaire to install and maintain the facilities.


Hillary Clinton Raises Tough Question of Life, Death and Medicine
Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she hoped the nation would engage in a serious discussion about what is appropriate medical care in cases where very expensive treatments do nothing for the patient's quality of life.

Guards Force Louvre to Close
Angered by plans for a new night shift, guards blocked the entrance to the Louvre today, leaving hundreds of people outside the glass pyramid that leads into the museum.
With an average of 13,000 people a day visiting the museum at this time of year, a spokesman, Christophe Monin, estimated that the protest cost the Louvre about $50,700.


U.N. Force to Rely on Haitians to Keep Order
Despite growing violence, the 1,300-member United Nations mission that is being sent to Haiti will rely on the Haitian military and police to maintain order.
Those groups have been held largely responsible for the politically motivated killings in the first place.
Clinton Administration officials and other Western diplomats say the troops and police officers who will make up the United Nations force will be lightly armed and will have no mandate to stop Haitian soldiers and paramilitary elements from committing atrocities.


Kosar Said to Sign for $27 Million
Cleveland quarterback BERNIE KOSAR, who has been benched part way through his last two outings, has received a $27 million, seven-year vote of confidence from the Browns' owner, ART MODELL, The Akron Beacon Journal reported yesterday.
The newspaper said Kosar agreed to a new contract worth an average of $3.85 million through 1999.
Under his previous contract, he was to receive $2.2 million this year, $2.25 million in 1994 and $2.5 million in 1995.


Rogue Cops
New Yorkers who live in safe, middle-class neighborhoods often don't understand how law-abiding citizens can fear and hate the police.
New Yorkers from violent, drug-infested neighborhoods understand quite well.
Renegade cops like Michael Dowd, Bernard Cawley and their fellow criminals in blue have worked mightily at teaching them.
In Brooklyn, Mr.
Dowd sold drugs and protected drug dealers, charging a princely fee of $8,000 a week.
In the Bronx, Mr.
Cawley made sport of bludgeoning people with lead-lined gloves.
His robber band of officers stole from dealers and sold the drugs and guns to other traffickers.

Steelers Make Haselrig Ineligible
Pittsburgh has placed Pro Bowl guard CARLTON HASELRIG on the National Football League's list of players with non-football injuries.
The move means he will be out indefinitely.
The team would not comment yesterday.


Rifkin Pleads Not Guilty In Deaths of Two Women
Joel Rifkin, the former landscaper from East Meadow, L.I., who told the police he had killed at least 18 women, pleaded not guilty today to killing two women whose bodies were found not far from the criminal courts building here.
Mr.
Rifkin, 34, head atilt and wearing a cowboy shirt, stood impassively during his arraignment before Judge John J. J. Jones Jr. of Suffolk County Court, who ordered him held without bail.


French Clothier Opening in New York
Another combatant has entered the suit war raging in midtown Manhattan.
Faconnable, the French men's apparel company, today opens its first store in the United States, on Fifth Avenue at 54th Street at a location formerly occupied by Gucci.
The store, a joint venture with Nordstrom's Inc., is just a few blocks from the new Barneys New York store on Madison Avenue and 61st Street, which opened recently and raised the stakes in the competition to clothe well-heeled professional men.


Gov. Weicker Exits in Good Form
Lowell Weicker is known for his risky positions and unpopular causes.
His decision not to stand for re-election as Governor of Connecticut will leave the state poorer -- and politics less lively.
As a three-term U.S.
Senator Mr.
Weicker made his mark early, as the prickly Republican on the special committee that investigated the Watergate break-in.
When he won the governorship as a political independent three years ago, he moved early and forcefully against public resistance to a state income tax.


Executive Leaves Rotando Agency
One of the top three executives at Rotando Lerch &amp; Iafeliece in Stamford, Conn., has left the agency, prompting its renaming as Rotando Partners.
John A. Lerch, 42, who joined Rotando in August 1991 as vice chairman and chief creative officer, left "to seek other opportunities," the agency announced yesterday in a news release.
In a telephone interview, Lynn Rotando, 50, chairman, president and chief executive, described Mr.
Lerch's departure as a "mutual decision."


RESULTS PLUS
FOOTBALL  Redmen Edge Marist  Anthony Russo, who gained 146 yards in 29 carries, scored on a 1-yard run with 2 minutes 38 minutes left in the game as St.
John's overtook Marist, 31-30, last night at Redmen's Stadium in Jamaica, Queens.
Sean Sharkey, St.
John's quarterback, threw four touchdown passes, three of them to Tom MacPherson.
Dan Phalen scored twice for Marist, first on a 27-yard reverse and then on a 10-yard pass from Brian McCourt.
The Redmen (3-1) had lost to Marist (2-2) in their previous three meetings.
U.C.L.A.
Romps: J. J. Stokes, held in check in the previous three games, caught five passes for 164 yards and three touchdowns and U.C.L.A. held Marshall Faulk to just 53 yards in a 52-13 victory over San Diego State last night in San Diego.
The Bruins (2-2) improved to 16-0-1 against San Diego State (3-2).
Faulk, the two-time national rushing leader and 1992 Heisman runner-up, was held to his second-lowest rushing total in three seasons, excluding two games cut short by injury. (AP) TENNIS  Eltingh Upsets Courier  Jacco Eltingh of the Netherlands pulled off a major surprise yesterday, upsetting Jim Courier, 6-4, 6-3, in the second round of the Malaysia Salem Open tennis championships in Kuala Lumpur.
The 23-year-old Eltingh, unseeded and ranked 75th in the world is known more for his doubles play, but he used an attacking style to eliminate the second-ranked player, a baseliner who has won four Grand Slam tournaments. (AP)


Senate Gives the Supercollider Another Chance at Survival
The Senate rejected efforts to cut off money for the Superconducting Supercollider today, giving the Texas-based proton smasher a breath of air, at least temporarily.
The high-energy physics project has been at the center of annual battles between Congressional deficit hawks and lawmakers who say the country should not sacrifice scientific research to cut the deficit.
The House voted to kill the project, 280 to 150, three months ago, and the Senate vote today, 57 to 42, may only slow its demise.


Weicker Rejects Re-election Bid In Connecticut
Gov.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the one-time liberal Republican who built a career out of going his own way, announced today that he would not seek re-election to a second term.
Mr.
Weicker, who is 62 and has more than 15 months left in office, said he wanted more time with his family, less intrusion by the demands of campaigning, and, perhaps, a job in private industry.
He avoided the word "retirement" and vowed a vigorous final year in office.


Hard Lessons on Competitive Bids
If the recent scandals in the municipal market force more states and local governments to rely increasingly on competitive bidding in the sales of their tax-exempt bonds, it appears that Merrill Lynch &amp; Company may already have an edge on its Wall Street competitors.
This advantage is evident in the rankings of underwriters for the first three quarters of the year.
Merrill's lead in its competitive bidding victories was enough to beat Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company to the top slot, although Goldman was No. 1 in negotiated bids.

Box-Office Fraud Inquiry Is Stopped
The Manhattan District Attorney's Office announced yesterday that it was dropping its investigation into allegations of fraud at the box office of the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.
The investigation was started in March 1992, during the run of "Catskills on Broadway."
In a letter made public yesterday, the District Attorney's Office said that despite evidence that $200,000 had been stolen, "we were not able to develop legally sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt who committed the crime."

IN "Baseball Without Me," an essay that appeared in last Sunday's New York Times, Fay Vincent made a case for the need for a baseball commissioner, a position that has not been filled since he was deposed in a bloodless coup by the owners one year ago.
The fact is, the commissioner of baseball had become like the Queen of England, but without a handbag.
And except for the pomp and ceremony, he hasn't been missed.


ESPN's Hip Kid Brother
ESPN2, the ostensibly hip, irreverent new companion to ESPN, starts tonight at 7:30 with the loosely structured, three-hour SportsNight news, update, interview, humor and commentary show.
SportsNight stars ESPN2's marquee personality, Keith Olbermann, who shifted from ESPN; Suzy Kolber, and either Mitch Albom or Bill Patrick.
It will be followed at 10:30 P.M. by Talk2, a one-hour talk show; Jim Rome will be the host.
ESPN2 hopes the brand name established by ESPN will help it snare an audience of viewers 18 to 34 years of age.
To lure that audience, ESPN2 is relying on college basketball, National Hockey League games, motor sports, roller hockey, volleyball, extreme sports, cutting-edge graphics and contemporary music.


From Hearings, Portraits of Disgrace
When the Mollen Commission hearings on police corruption are long over, its policy recommendations a matter of record, New York police lore will still be haunted by the young faces of the disgraced officers and the way their numbing, ugly admissions spilled out, one after the next.
Today, after a day's recess, more tales of brutality and carousing and drug use and indifference to basic police work are scheduled to resume.
Over three days of testimony so far, the former officers have lined up to offer their mantras on corruption.


Market Place; Some Baby Bells may be angling for a role in a Paramount deal.
WHILE Viacom and QVC Network race to line up money in their battle to buy Paramount Communications, all eyes are now turning toward the Baby Bells as potential partners.

Reviews/ Film; Not-So-Tough Sledding From 4 Unlikely Olympians
The usual high-concept film is one that can be described in a sentence or two.
But "Cool Runnings" boils down to just three words: Jamaican bobsled team.
Since nothing about that phrase says "stroke of genius," there's reason to wonder what kind of film can have been spun out of it.
The answer: a cute, buoyant sports fantasy, jolted along by a reggae soundtrack and playfully acted by an appealing cast.
This new Disney comedy is slick, funny and warmhearted, very much in the old-fashioned Disney mode.
Though this film's vision of Jamaica is about as authentically Caribbean as Sebastian the crab, it is picturesque and bright.
In sunny Jamaica, a champion sprinter named Derice Bannock (Leon) joins forces with the comical Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) and two other friends to form an unlikely Olympic team.
Derice, the bald-headed Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) and Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) have all crossed paths, quite literally, in the Olympic trials for Jamaican runners.
And they have lost their chance to qualify as runners.


Clinton Says He's Met Pledge to Cut Staff by 25%
President Clinton said today that he had met his campaign pledge to reduce the White House staff by 25 percent, but Republican critics in Congress immediately said he had met his goal by using gimmicks.
White House officials said 1,005 employees were working at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- or 389 fewer than in November 1992, when Mr.
Clinton was elected.


Welfare Fingerprinting Becomes Law in Suffolk
Despite possible state opposition, Suffolk County Executive Robert J. Gaffney signed into law today a measure that will require fingerprinting for welfare recipients.
The law, the first of its kind in New York State, directs county welfare officials to seek bids immediately for a computer system that can store and compare fingerprint images to guard against recipients who try to collect benefits under more than one name.


U.N. Chief Warning U.S. Against Pullout Of Force in Somalia
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has warned the United States that a withdrawal of American troops from Somalia would destroy the United Nations peacekeeping operation there.
In a blunt letter delivered Monday to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Mr.
Boutros-Ghali also said a Security Council resolution obliged him to continue to try to bring to justice a Somalia faction leader, Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, despite the new American strategy to move away from the goal of capturing him and to focus instead on creating a political process that would allow an American withdrawal.


18 Inspectors Arrested on Bribe Charges
New York City investigators arrested 18 current and former plumbing inspectors yesterday on charges that they extorted dozens of payoffs from plumbing contractors in return for expedited inspections and quicker city approvals at construction sites.
Eleven inspectors were arrested yesterday when they reported to the Buildings Department for what they had been told would be a computer training session.
Colleagues looked on in disbelief as the inspectors were taken away about 9:30 A.M.
One plumbing inspector who was not arrested said the city was partly responsible for the problem.
"They create it," the inspector said.
"They put you in a position that basically is a no-win situation. They don't give you any increase in salary. Plumbers are making $55,000 a year and the city plumbing inspectors only get $28,000." Payoffs at 88 Work Sites
The inspectors, responsible for insuring that pipes, sprinklers and gas lines are safe in buildings being constructed or under renovation, were accused of taking dozens of payoffs and bribes from contractors since 1988, ranging from $50 to $1,000.
Prosecutors said they had evidence of payoffs at 88 work sites, including Police Headquarters, the World Trade Center, a condominium development on Staten Island and a row of three-family houses in Queens.
For the bribes, prosecutors said, the inspectors speeded approvals for plumbing work, arranging special appointments for inspections and taking pains to make sure the paper work was done quickly.
Because plumbing contractors are generally not paid until their work passes inspection, the contractors were willing to make illegal payments just to speed up the city bureaucracy, prosecutors said.
"These city inspectors were demanding payoffs to insure that their official duties were performed expeditiously," said the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.
"Their power to extort payoffs lay in the fact that their signatures made the difference between getting paid or not getting paid."
The city's Investigation Commissioner, Susan E. Shepard, portrayed the bribes as part of endemic corruption in the plumbing industry.
She said plumbing contractors had come to expect that they would have to pay cash bribes to get city inspections done on time and without hassles.
Since the plumbing inspectors are required to be licensed plumbers, most come from the companies they regulate, creating a cozy breeding ground for corruption, she said. 'A Real Fraternity'
"There is a real fraternity here," she said.
"A fraternity that practices corruption almost as an art form. Corruption so deeply ingrained it has become common practice. No guns pointed. No strong-arm enforcement. People pay. The contractor gets his sign-off. The job continues. Everyone smiles."
About half of the city's 38 plumbing investigators were arrested in the sweep yesterday, crippling the department's ability to perform inspections.
In addition to 11 inspectors arrested at the department's headquarters, one was arrested at his office and five others were still being sought.
Six retired inspectors were arrested at their homes.
It was not the first time that corruption has cropped up in a building inspection program.
In 1991, a similar investigation resulted in the arrest of 14 construction inspectors in the Buildings Department on Federal charges of extorting more than $150,000 over a three-year period from contractors.
In 1992, city investigators arrested 30 taxi inspectors at the city's cab inspection center in Queens on charges that they accepted bribes to pass unsafe taxis.
The inspectors arrested yesterday were charged with multiple counts of grand larceny, extortion, receiving bribes and receiving unlawful gratuities.
The most serious charge, grand larceny, carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.
Ms.
Shepard said the 18-month inquiry uncovered no evidence that the inspectors overlooked or approved work that would create hazards.
Among those indicted were the chief plumbing inspectors for Queens and Brooklyn and the acting chief inspector in Manhattan, Ms.
Shepard said.
The chiefs were paid between $300 and $500 per inspection and in a single instance, $1,000, for a fast approval, augmenting their income by as much as $25,000 a year, she said.
The assistant inspectors and line inspectors were collecting about $5,000 a year in illegal payments, she said.
Mayor David N. Dinkins said he had submitted two bills to the City Council that would replace city-paid inspectors with private inspectors supervised by a board of city officials.
He also said the Buildings Department had taken some steps to discourage corruption: computerizing inspection schedules to make sure the sites are visited within three days after a request and rotating inspectors from borough to borough to break down personal relationships with plumbing contractors.


President Moves to Loosen Grip Of White House on Regulations
President Clinton today gave Federal agencies greater authority to write regulations on pollution, safety, business practices and the like without White House intervention, saying his order would "eliminate improper influence, secrecy and delay."
The move is meant to reverse the pattern under Presidents George Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, who had ordered their staffs to scrutinize and frequently to overrule the agencies, often with an eye to making regulations more palatable to business.

In 1985, Schnellenberger accepted the head coaching job at the University of Louisville and declared that the program "was on a collision course with the national championship."

Yanks' Peaks and Valleys of '93
lthough it might not seem like a successful season now because the Yankees are still absorbing the sting of being bounced from the pennant race, they actually played stellar baseball in 1993.
A team that was not supposed to match the Blue Jays matched them until September and is likely to finish second.
That will depend on how the Yankees fare in their final three games, against Detroit starting tonight at the Stadium.
Here are some of the reasons why the team soared and then struggled:
THE PITCHER: JIMMY KEY Crafty.
Consistent.
Commanding.
From his first spring training start in Vero Beach, Fla., to his last start in Baltimore Wednesday, Key was a consummate professional.
With a career-best 18 victories, he might have been favored for the Cy Young Award if relievers had not mishandled six games in which he had left with a lead.
"I don't know what we would have done without him," Manager Buck Showalter said.
Probably lost a lot more often.


Black Cleric Says Giuliani Is Attracting 'Fascist' Ilk
As Mayor David N. Dinkins stood at his side, a prominent black minister charged yesterday that the Mayor has been falsely branded a "murderer" for the death of a rabbinical student in Crown Heights and that these "fascist" elements have gravitated toward his rival, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"Elements that can best be described as fascist seem to have grown up and flowered around Mr. Giuliani," said the Rev.
William A. Jones, senior pastor at Bethany Baptist Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
He was acting as spokesman for the Baptist Pastors Churches Union, which represents 64 churches in Brooklyn and Queens.


Reviews/ Film; The Opportunist School Of Hotel Management
"For Love or Money" begins by having some fun with the notion of Michael J. Fox as Mr.
Big, riding around Manhattan in a long white limousine and indulging in a big-ticket shopping spree.
This is Mr.
Fox as no one particularly wants to see him: cold, aloof and corrupted by power.
He is much more at home when he is revealed to be Doug Ireland, the sneaky, quick-witted concierge at a grand New York hotel, working hard to parlay each guest's needs into a golden opportunity of his own.
"Don't confuse yourself with all these small denominations," he tells an out-of-towner (Michael Tucker) who tries to give him a $5 tip in gratitude for a big favor.
"You wait until I feel like the best friend you ever had. Then you give me a tip so big it feels like passing a kidney stone." Doug Ireland, a dyed-in-the-wool cynic who describes himself as "a genie in a suit," should probably do something to change his life, but the viewer will wind up hoping that he doesn't.
Doug's Machiavellian hotel-management tricks are much more gratifying than his inevitable decision to clean up his act.


Suspect Says He Was Unaware of Strangling Plot
He marched to the witness stand with the confident stride of a soldier.
Then, in calm, self-assured tones, James P. Wanger told a packed courtroom about his religious faith, his plans to enter the Marines and his complete ignorance of a plot to kill his old friend Robert A. Solimine Jr.
But by the end of the day, the 19-year-old Clifton, N.J., man accused of garroting Mr.
Solimine on Feb. 16, 1992, was continually repeating the prosecutor's questions before haltingly answering.
And Mr.
Wanger seemed unable to say definitively where he was around the time the authorities say Mr.
Solimine was strangled.


Insurers Fear They'd Be the Big Losers in a World of Managed Health Care
Since the President gave his health care speech last week, employees have lived with fluttery stomachs in the offices of the Bartmon Shapiro insurance agency, a thriving business high above Central Park South whose windows offer panoramic views of the park and the midtown Manhattan skyline.
Under President Clinton's health care plan, the profession of health insurance agent could virtually cease to exist.
"People are very, very nervous," said Joel Shapiro, whose 17-year-old company employs 10 people.
"But we are going to have to adapt. We are going to have to change."

Hannelore Baron
Barbara Mathes Gallery  41 East 57th Street, Manhattan  Through Oct. 16
In the last few years, there have been several shows of the art of Hannelore Baron (1926-1987), including one at the Guggenheim Museum, and the latest may be the best of them.
The story of Baron's escape from Nazi Germany as a child is by now familiar, as are the small collages and constructions she produced over the course of several decades in America, work made for herself and without regard for the marketplace or public display.


Art in Review
Maureen Gallace
Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery  51 Greene Street (near Broome Street)  SoHo  Through Oct. 16
Maureen Gallace's charming little paintings mine the unlikely overlap between Fairfield Porter (or early Edward Hopper) and Allan McCollum.
Their red barns and white houses nestle comfortably and comfortingly in fields of green against trees of darker green, but they are strangely geometric, devoid of doors or windows or any signs of life.
They are also rendered a bit awkwardly, almost naively: the colored planes of the buildings never quite form convincing volumes; the greenery has a filled-in generality.
Above all, as in Mr.
McCollum's work, the motifs repeat with only minor adjustments in painting after painting.

C.I.A. Releases Files on Korea and Cold War
A document released by the Central Intelligence Agency today as it began to unseal its archives from the cold war era shows that American intelligence agencies failed to recognize that the Korean War was imminent six days before it began.
Despite a buildup of North Korean troops along the 38th parallel, a formal estimate dated June 19, 1950, and approved by the then Director of Central Intelligence, Gen.
Walter Bedell Smith, said an invasion of South Korea by North Korea had been put off in favor of a campaign of propaganda and subversion.

Inside Art
The Getty and the Graces
Once the J. Paul Getty Museum sets its sights on an important work of art, it doesn't give up.
It's been five years since the museum in Malibu, Calif., first tried to buy Antonio Canova's "Three Graces," a nearly five-and-a-half-foot-tall marble statue of Venus's handmaidens commissioned by John Russell, the sixth Duke of Bedford, in 1814.
And it's still trying to clinch the deal.
What has held up the sale is the British Government's refusal to grant an export license.
The Getty first entered into negotiations to buy the sculpture in 1989 and was turned down in 1990 because of a stipulation that works of art considered part of Britain's national heritage could leave the country only if no public or private parties in the country wanted to buy the works. (Earlier, only public institutions had to turn down a work of art for an export license to be granted.)


PRIVATIZING URGED TO IMPROVE ROADS
The Federal Government's top highway official proposed today that private businesses operate portions of the 42,500-mile Interstate System, charging tolls and providing money to repair decaying highways and bridges.

State Unveils Its Plan For Yanks in Manhattan
New York State unveiled its plan yesterday to keep the Yankees from jumping to New Jersey, proposing a $319 million, 50,000-seat stadium and a $211 million, 7,000-space parking garage that would be built on the Long Island Rail Road storage yards south of the Jacob Javits Convention Center.
Short of keeping the team in the Bronx at Yankee Stadium, the state believes that a sleek new waterfront ball park west of midtown is the last, best way to keep the Yankees from moving to the New Jersey Meadowlands.
Privately, state officials are convinced that the Yankees will leave the Bronx.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; The Partnership for a Drug-Free America accentuates the positive in a new campaign.
THE Supreme Court, it is said, follows the election returns.
So, too, it seems, does the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.
The partnership, a seven-year-old volunteer coalition of advertising agencies and media companies, is about to introduce a series of television commercials, aimed at inner-city youth, that takes a strikingly different tack than was popular during the Reagan-Bush era.
Gone are the negative strategies typified by the slogan "Just say no" -- hard-sell castigations of drug use, infused with menace and melodrama, that perfectly complemented Presidential rhetoric of a "war on drugs."


The Limp Blimp Bashing Castro
Will Congress finally ground the blimp in the Florida Keys that relays TV programs to Cuba, where they get the most dismal ratings?
The balloon is operable only in fair weather, its signal is easily jammed by the Castro regime and its broadcasts are beamed only from 3:30 A.M. to 6 A.M. to avoid violating global agreements.
Yet since 1990 the U.S. has spent $67 million -- $60,000 a day -- to transmit Spanish-language news and entertainment shows, because neither Congress nor successive Presidents wanted to wrestle with an aggressive anti-Castro exile faction.


V.M.I.'s Unacceptable Remedy
For years the Virginia Military Institute claimed the right to offer its uniquely stressful, oppressive martial education program to men only.
Then last year the Federal Court of Appeals in Richmond, ruling in a suit by the Justice Department, held that whatever the program's virtues, the state institution must offer them to women as well.
Constitutionally speaking, that was the easy part, and the Supreme Court summarily denied V.M.I.'s petition for review.
The Court of Appeals, in a separate pronouncement that the high court also did not review, said Virginia could integrate, establish parallel programs for both sexes or abandon state funding of V.M.I.

Excerpts From Report on the Waco Raid
Following are excerpts from the Treasury Department's report on the raid by agents of the the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on David Koresh's compound near Waco, Tex.
Among the principals cited in the report were Phillip J. Chojnacki, special agent in charge of the bureau's Houston office, and Charles D. Sarabyn, assistant special agent in Houston.
Although the raid on the Branch Davidian Compound had originally been set for March 1, 1993, no one had even started to draft the mandatory documentation of the raid plan by Feb. 23, 1993, when  [ Acting Special Agent in Charge ]  Dartell Dyer (Kansas City) arrived in Waco and was assigned to be the support coordinator for the operation.
Dyer's past military service led him to assume that there was a detailed written raid plan, but, when he asked the raid planners for a copy he was advised that none existed.
Thereafter, Dyer and agent William Krone took it upon themselves to produce one, even though they started with little knowledge about the work of the tactical planners.


Giving Addicts Clean Needles Cuts Spread of AIDS, U.S. Study Finds
The Federal Government's first comprehensive study of whether giving clean needles to addicts can help prevent the spread of AIDS has concluded that it does and that the Government should finance a significant expansion of such programs.

The chief object of these programs is to end the drug abuser's need to share syringes that may have become contaminated with blood carrying the AIDS virus.

Schumann is very young; at 23 he has lived in New York for only about two years. (He was born in Rhode Island, reared in Texas and educated at the San Francisco Art Institute.) He's also very talented, possessed of a graphic ability and a sense of color and composition that is, in its own sometimes oppressive way, unerring and authentic.


Dan Rather Scolds TV News As Pandering to Get Ratings
In an unusual condemnation of television news by one of its stars, Dan Rather, the CBS anchor, told a group of news directors that "we all should be ashamed of what we have and have not done, measured against what we could do."
Mr.
Rather made his remarks Wednesday to the Radio and Television News Directors Association at a meeting in Miami.
The remarks were widely circulated yesterday among the three major networks' news divisions in New York.

Finalists for Book Awards
"The Shipping News," by E. Annie Proulx, and "United States: Essays 1952-1992," by Gore Vidal, are among the 15 books of fiction, nonfiction and poetry chosen as finalists for the 1993 National Book Awards, the award's administrators announced yesterday.
The three winners of the prizes, to be announced on Nov. 17, will each receive $10,000.
The awards, administered by the National Book Foundation, are given for books written by American citizens and published in the United States between Dec. 1, 1992, and Nov. 30, 1993.
The Foundation said that this year, 149 publishers submitted a record 609 books for consideration.


Art in Review
Louise Fishman
Robert Miller Gallery  41 East 57th Street, Manhattan  Through Oct. 16
One becomes accustomed to Louise Fishman's latest abstractions in the way one acclimates to seeing objects in the dark.
Her large canvas called "Mars" is at first a forbidding wall of black and gray wrapped in a grid whose painted lines are like straps of black leather.
Then the darkness yields up patches of red and flecks of white like light dimly glinting on the edges of the straps.
This yielding up is a beautiful, slow process, and it means that "Mars" intensifies in the variety and impact of its effects.


COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT
Pride Bowl
This event has meaning for John Culver and Keith Smith, key players for Montclair State and both from Newark.
The Pride Bowl, now in its 15th year, benefits after-school programs within the city of Newark and has reached out to hundreds of youths including Culver, the fullback, and Davis, a cornerback, for the Red Hawks.
In this year's Pride Bowl, Montclair State will be the host to Fairleigh Dickinson-Madison at Sprague Field with the kickoff scheduled for 7 P.M.
A record crowd of 7,000 is anticipated.
The Red Hawks are off to an impressive start with two victories over upstate New York powers, Cortland and Ithaca, while the Jersey Devils are undefeated after three games, somewhat to the astonishment of longtime Coach Bill Klika.


Supreme Court Faces a Docket Heavy With Unfinished Rights Cases
The Supreme Court's docket for the term that begins on Monday is sparse in numbers but heavy with the unfinished business of past years, particularly in the area of civil rights.
The newest Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who made her mark as a pioneer for women's rights in arguing landmark sex discrimination cases before the Court, has arrived to find an unusually wide array of discrimination cases already accepted for argument.
Most raise questions that the Court itself has left unanswered in earlier rulings.


Report on Initial Raid on Cult Finds Officials Erred and Lied
Law-enforcement officials botched virtually every aspect of their plan to capture David Koresh, the leader of the heavily armed cult near Waco, Tex., then misled investigators and Congress about their mistakes, according to the Clinton Administration's first official assessment of the affair.
In a brutally detailed report of mistakes and mendacity in the top ranks of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Treasury Department offered a wealth of new information today about one of the deadliest law-enforcement operations in modern times.
It is a devastating critique of an obscure Treasury agency already teetering on the verge of extinction under an Administration proposal to hand its duties to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.


Edwin Crawford, 68; Ran Counties Group
Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties since 1977, died on Monday at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Binghamton, N.Y.
He was 68 and had lived in Binghamton and in Brewster, Mass.
The cause of his death was prostate cancer, his family said.
Mr.
Crawford was a leader in efforts to modernize county governments through the United States.
A longtime resident of Broome County, he led a drive for an elected county executive there, and held the post himself for eight years, elected initially in 1968.

Settlement for $371 Million By Prudential Unit Expected
Prudential Securities has agreed to pay about $371 million to settle Federal and state charges of securities law violations stemming from its sales of money-losing limited partnerships during the 1980's, people with knowledge of the talks said yesterday.
Under terms of the deal with regulators, reached after almost a year of negotiations, Prudential would pay about $345 million to settle Federal charges, and about $26 million for state charges.

5 Key Nations Urge Prudence In Setting Peacekeeping Goal
The five permanent Security Council members said today that the demands being made on the United Nations exceeded its capabilities and that proposed new peacekeeping operations must be reviewed very carefully.
The statement, issued after a meeting here tonight with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, showed that Britain, France, Russia and China all now back the cautious approach President Clinton spelled out toward the explosive growth of peacekeeping operations in his address Monday to the General Assembly.
What the Ministers Want
The foreign ministers of the five members, whose governments have a veto over Council decisions, said a gap existed between the "demands on the United Nations and its capabilities." They affirmed that "new commitments" should be made only after "fundamental questions" are resolved regarding the objectives of a proposed force, the resources available, the risks to personnel and the expected duration of the operation.


OFFICIALS EXPECT HARD FLU SEASON
Warning that a severe flu season is at hand, Federal public health officials said yesterday that they were urging older Americans and others at risk to get flu shots right away.
"This year's flu, the Beijing strain, is expected to hit very hard," the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, said at a news conference in Washington.
She said 10,000 to 45,000 Americans die from influenza every year, mostly older people who could have been saved by flu shots.


Review/Art; Channels to the Sacred, From Africa to the West
"Face of the Gods: Art and Altars of Africa and the African Americas," at the Museum for African Art in SoHo, is a show of both great ambition and ambitions fulfilled.
Visually and emotionally stirring, it not only documents a wide assortment of crucial connections between African and African-American religious art.
It also imaginatively explores the sensitive issue of how non-Western sacred art can be displayed in a secular Western context.
Organized by the art historian Robert Farris Thompson, the exhibition includes more than a dozen assemblages, some of astonishing complexity, that are used as vehicles for spiritual communication or worship in African and African-derived New World religions.
They range from a 19th-century wooden figure pierced by metal instruments, from the old Kongo region of Central Africa, to a full-scale tree festooned with plastic bottles, a sight familiar in black neighborhoods in the South of the United States, to a closetlike African-Cuban altar to the spirit Sarabanda, created and sanctified for the exhibition by the priest and ritual artist Felipe Garcia Villamil, who lives in the Bronx.


Restaurants
"Have some bread," says Emily Rapp.
"It's just out of the oven." You have just settled into one of the cozy seats at Etats-Unis, and in her hand is a bowl containing warm, slightly crusty bread so delicious that your slice vanishes before everyone at the table has been served.
Then she hands you a menu.
This is handwritten each day and comes wrapped up in one of the quirkiest, most personal wine lists in the city.
The little package also has a separate listing of "interesting wines for tonight's menu," with the notes of an inspired taster.
If you show any enthusiasm for wine, Ms.
Rapp will reappear with extra information.
"My brother was interested in your wine choices," she said one night, "and would like to suggest that you try the Hugel Pinot Noir."


Heads Lean to Lewis, But Hearts Are Bruno's
The bookshop window along St.

The Lewis book, just out in hardback, sells for $:15, or $22.68; the Bruno book, just out in paperback, sells for $:4.99, or $7.54.
"We are selling more Lewis actually," Glen James, a middle-aged woman with kindly eyes, said from behind the cash register.
"But my heart is with Frank."


YELTSIN AND FOES SIGN PACT TO EASE PARLIAMENT SIEGE
Representatives of Russia's warring President and Parliament agreed early today to a phased lifting of the armed confrontation at the headquarters of the legislature, the Interfax news agency reported.
Interfax said both sides, meeting also with Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, signed an agreement at 2:40 A.M. under which electricity, heat and some telephones would be immediately restored to the headquarters, known as the White House, and arms held by the defenders of the building would be put in storage.

The manufacturing sector appears less robust, however, with two other reports showing relatively little improvement.


Reviews/Film Festival; A Question of Incest, Posed Quietly
Aline Issermann's "Shades of Doubt" ("L'Ombre du Doute"), a French film about a wrenching family crisis, is set forth with remarkable restraint.
The subject is incest, but the story's potential for tawdriness is never exploited.
Instead, Ms.
Issermann presents a discreet, methodical account of how 12-year-old Alexandrine (Sandrine Blancke) comes to bring and then recant charges against her father, Jean (Alain Bashung).
If the director's approach is at all representative, then the cultural differences between French and American approaches to this subject are fascinating.
The American impulse toward tabloid sensationalism is nowhere evident; nor is the urge to air all the family's dirty laundry in the interests of catharsis.
If anything, the LeBlancs feel profoundly embarrassed by their problem and wish it would simply go away.
In a climate of sexual sophistication and naturalness, the charge of incest is perhaps even more devastating than it would be in dysfunction-conscious America.


Music Notes
Orchestral Negotiations
The Philadelphia Orchestra's recent last-minute settlement saved its season as well as Carnegie Hall's opening night.
But other orchestras have been less lucky.
The Kennedy Center Opera House Orchestra, on strike since Sept. 1, has made no progress in its talks with the center but has had moral support from the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Baltimore Symphony and the National Symphony, which have refused to cross picket lines to play there.
The Boston Ballet and the San Francisco Ballet, for which the orchestra would normally have played, have postponed their October appearances at the Kennedy Center.
The next negotiation session is on Monday.


President of Peru Says He Is Confident of Defeating Guerrilla Group
In a display of confidence that his Government is finally winning the long struggle against the Shining Path guerrillas, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru said today that he had rejected a peace offer from the movement's imprisoned leader.
In an address to the General Assembly largely devoted to his Government's efforts to defeat Shining Path, Mr.
Fujimori said its leader, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, who was captured and sentenced to life imprisonment last year, had written to him from prison offering to negotiate a "peace agreement."

His wife, Carolyn, said he died of a heart attack.


Lufthansa And United Deal Is Set
Culminating a lengthy courtship, United Airlines and Lufthansa will announce on Monday that they are joining forces as marketing partners.
The latest in a long line of airlines to pair off, the two carriers will end months of guessing about which of America's two largest carriers -- United or American Airlines -- Lufthansa would pick.


Russia Delaying U.N.'s Vote On Troops in Ex-Yugoslavia
Russia delayed Security Council action today against President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia by objecting to efforts intended to encourage him to press separatist Serbs in Croatia to resolve their conflict with the Government in Zagreb.
Because of Mosow's objections, the Council was unable for the second day in a row to agree on renewing the mandate for the 22,000 United Nations peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia for another six months.
Instead, the Council renewed the mandate for four days, until Tuesday, to allow more time for negotiations.
This action came after the Council extended the peacekeeping mission for 24 hours on Thursday.


CHRONICLE
An Indonesian lawyer fighting for the rights of 250 indigenous tribes in Irian Jaya, the Indonesian controlled western half of New Guinea, has been chosen to receive the 10th annual Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, it was announced in Washington yesterday.
The lawyer, BAMBANG WIDJOJANTO, will come to Washington on Nov. 18 to receive the award, which carries a $30,000 stipend.
"Part of the reason that he was chosen for this award is that this is the United Nations Year of Indigenous People," KERRY KENNEDY CUOMO, executive director of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights, said yesterday.
"He has brought together a group of tribes in Irian Jaya and become the voice of reason objecting to the Government, challenging it on development practices and human rights violations."


Review/Film Festival; What Bob Does for A Few Bob
Ken Loach, the English film maker, first came on the international scene in the early 1970's with such films as "Poor Cow" and "Kes." With "Riff-Raff" (1991) and now "Raining Stones," which will be shown at the New York Film Festival at 9 tonight, it's abundantly evident that he's on a new roll.
Like "Riff-Raff," a bitterly comic response to the policies of Britain's Tory governments, "Raining Stones" focuses on working-class folk who have somehow failed to benefit from trickle-down economic theories.
The setting is a medium-sized city in the north of England where Bob (Bruce Jones), a youngish, balding man who's no better than he should be, is trying to make ends meet in a depressed job market.


Observer; In Russet Mantle Clad
Baseball as we have known it ends as the baseball season ends tomorrow, and I'm sorry, Willy, but I can't cry.
I was ready to tell baseball "So long, Sweetheart" a year ago.
That's when they played the World Series just before dawn.
I know Hamlet prowled battlements at that hour to talk with his father's ghost, but I doubt he would have done it to watch a baseball game.


Romanians Don't See King as Figurehead
To the Editor:
You report that Romania has sued King Michael in New York and Switzerland for the return of works by El Greco, Rembrandt, Bruegel and other old masters (news article, Sept. 14).
You state that Michael "from 1940 to 1947, was, except for a few months before the Communist takeover in 1945, only a figurehead."
The facts do not support this view.
From 1941 to 1944, King Michael collaborated with his mother, Queen Elena, in diplomatic and political efforts to save Jewish lives.
Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust center has named Queen Elena a righteous among the nations.
A ceremony to honor her memory and commemorate those efforts is scheduled by the Israel Embassy in Switzerland Nov. 4, with Michael present.


Retirement Portfolios: The Experts Hold Fast
Shirking off market jitters and October fears, five mutual fund experts are holding fast to the hypothetical retirement portfolios that they created three months ago for The New York Times.
The experts emphasized that the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years.
Only one of the five recommended a change in his portfolio -- and that a slight shift in weighting.


As Mormon Church Grows, So Does Dissent From Feminists and Scholars
The Mormon Church, whose early leaders feared the wrath of outsiders, has lately viewed its gravest threat as coming from within: intellectuals and feminists in the temples.
In what dissidents have described as a purge, church leaders took severe disciplinary action in September against six Mormon scholars and feminists.
The transgressions fit into two categories: academic research that raises questions about official church history, and the call for opening the priesthood to women, which is granted to males over the age of 12.


Turndowns Turned Down
Turndown horseshoes, which became popular this year as a means of giving race horses extra traction, will no longer be allowed in New York State starting with Wednesday's races at Belmont Park.
Racing officials said yesterday that the ban was being ordered to protect jockeys and horses from injuries and the track from the added impact.


Celtics Add Some Backcourt Depth
Trying to rebuild their backcourt after the death of Reggie Lewis, the Boston Celtics have signed former National Basketball Association guards TRAVIS MAYS, RODNEY MONROE and LAMONT STROTHERS.
Boston announced the signing of the three yesterday along with that of 7-foot-1-inch MATT WENSTROM, the third-string center on North Carolina's N.C.A.A. championship team last season. (AP)


RESULTS PLUS
GOLF  Trevino After a Payday  Lee Trevino and Jim Dent matched bogey-free 65's and shared the first-round lead yesterday in the richest event on the Senior PGA Tour, the $1.5 million Vantage Championship in Clemmons, N.C.
"I'm clicking on all cylinders right now; I'm awfully relaxed out there," Trevino said after scoring nine 3's for a seven-under-par effort in a tournament that offers $225,000 to the winner.
But he will have to contend with Dent, a runner-up in this event the last two years.
Dent tied Trevino with birdies on three of the last four holes and a 31 on the back nine.
Jim Albus was third with a 67, and Isao Aoki of Japan was next at 68. (AP)

CHRONICLE
BOYD GAINES, who plays the leading man in "She Loves Me," became so exuberant during Wednesday evening's preview performance that he danced right off the stage and into the audience during the first act.
"I have a quick change of clothing in the dark on stage, and I start the song 'Three Letters' while in the dark with scenery moving all around me," Mr.
Gaines said from his dressing room at the Brooks Atkinson theater yesterday.
"I had a marker on the floor but couldn't see it, and when the lights went on I was completely blinded by the spots. As I walked back, I went right off the stage and luckily, landed in the aisle. I was stunned but went right back on the stage, and a lot of people thought it was part of the show. Thank goodness, I didn't fall on anyone."


Don't Rush a Bad Crime Bill
There is a dangerous section in the new crime bill being promoted by Senator Joseph Biden and the Clinton Administration.
Its title calls it a "reform," but it would lock in court rulings that have watered down the laws under which state court prisoners get their cases reviewed by Federal courts.
This section of the bill has to do with the body of law built around the concept of habeas corpus -- literally "you (might) have the body."
When a prisoner secures a writ of habeas corpus from a Federal court, the state authorities must show that the prisoner received a fair trial and that they are therefore authorized to "have the body" in prison.
This body of law has ancient roots.
It was intended to curb the power of monarchs to keep citizens under arrest and in custody.
Yet Mr.
Biden sees no necessity for debate over the habeas corpus section of the crime bill.


Bridge
Beginners are advised to avoid trump suits with fewer than eight cards in the combined hands, but the experts are alert for exceptions.
The right time to play in a 4-3 fit is not easy to spot.
The practice is long associated with Alphonse Moyse Jr. who recommended it on every possible opportunity.
Delicate bidding maneuvers are often called for, and were forthcoming on the diagramed deal.
It was played in a money team game which used to be, but is no longer, played at the Young Men's Philanthropic League, 4 East 80th Street.
North and South were Fred Chang and Ira Rubin, and their problem was to find a suitable 4-3 fit at the six-level.
Since no fit had been discovered, the raise to four no-trump was natural and so was five spades.
South relied on his partner to bid six of any suit in which he held K-x-x, and the partnership duly reached six hearts, the best spot -- decidedly better than six no-trump.


A Series Will Celebrate The Viola's Versatility
"Voila Viola," a three-part series celebrating the versatility of the violin's big brother, will begin at 2 P.M. tomorrow at Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan.
The first part will feature works for viola and voice, with Wendy Hoffman, a mezzo-soprano, and Robert White, a tenor.
Part two, at 4:30, features Peter Schickele (of P. D. Q. Bach fame).
The final event, at 8 P.M., includes works by Mozart, Bach and Mr.
Schickele.


A Pioneer of Mutual Funds Takes a Look at Today
Walter L. Morgan, a young Philadelphia accountant, had just founded one of the first American mutual funds when stocks rose to dizzying heights in the summer of 1929.
His portfolio was heavily invested in common stocks, including such speculative favorites as Curtis Publishing at about $125 a share and U.S.
Steel at more than $250.
Applying the then-novel idea that adding bonds to stocks for "balance" would create a fund that could better withstand bear markets, he and his fledgling Wellington Fund survived the ensuing stock crash and Depression.


On Trying Alternative Medicine for Migraine; Not a Major Risk
To the Editor:
Re "Mystery of Migraine Begins to Yield Genetic Clues" (Science Times, Sept. 14): Attention to migraine research is encouraging.
But clarification is needed on two issues, the theory of spreading depression and migraine, and the alleged effect of sumatriptan on the coronary arteries.
The theory of spreading depression as the source of migraine is predicated on data from one study, which has been impossible to duplicate.
On analysis by other investigators, spreading depression is probably due to false readings of scattered radiation (Olsen et al., Archives of Neurology, 1987, pages 156-61).
Research has been expended, and a plethora of articles have been published based on the questionable findings of the initial study.
The vascular theory originated by Harold G. Wolff of Cornell University is the most widely accepted for the origin of migraine.


Bonds Swings the Pressure Back Toward the Braves
How does Barry Bonds like October now?
On the first day of his reputed least favorite month, Bonds crushed the first two fat pitches the Los Angeles Dodgers offered him tonight.
One landed over the wall in dead center, one landed over the wall in right field, and the only fingers pointed at him this evening were out of envy.
Bonds is well known for his October swoons, but that was in Pittsburgh.
Tonight, with the National League West title on a pendulum, Bonds tied this game with his three-run homer and shattered it with his second one.
He drove in a career-high seven runs, his San Francisco Giants held on to win, 8-7, before 51,860, and the Giants and Braves go back to the drawing board again Saturday.


New York Rivals Differ Strikingly On Dealing With City's Poorest
In the four years since they last ran for mayor, David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani have refined their positions on what should be done for the city's impoverished multitudes and now present voters with distinctly different approaches to homelessness and welfare reform.
But even as they have become more sophisticated about the issues, the already staggering scale of the city's social ills has worsened, fueled by a deep, prolonged recession, rising numbers of people with AIDS, a virulent drug crisis, a persistent low-income housing shortage and the spread of tuberculosis.


Japanese Starting to Link Pay To Performance, Not Tenure
In Japanese festivals, dozens of people together hoist a heavy portable shrine, known as a mikoshi, and chant as they carry it through the streets.
Since it is impossible to tell who is actually doing the lifting, it is only natural that some shrine carriers shirk off, shifting more weight onto others.
Japanese companies, too, have what is called "mikoshi management." People work as a group and the achievers often carry the laggards along.
Salary depends much more on how long one has worked for the company than on how much one contributes to it.


In India Quake Zone, a Land of Funeral Pyres
Two days after the largest earthquake to hit India in 50 years savaged these placid rolling farmlands, flames from dozens of funeral pyres glinted in the dawn, dotting fields of newly cut sugarcane like fireflies.
Here and there a solitary figure was faintly visible squatting by the crackling fires.
As villagers struggled to come to terms with the loss of their world, estimates of the death toll from Thursday's devastating quake oscillated wildly.
Local officials suggested that as many as 30,000 people may have died during those few moments of terror, while the national authorities hewed to the figure of 10,000.


Victory Is Sour for Lawyer Fighting Nassau Parking Tickets
Ira J. Raab won't have to pay the $15 parking ticket he received last March when he pulled into a crowded lot and parked in a spot reserved for the police, a judge has ruled.
But the decision was nonetheless a defeat for Mr.
Raab, a former New York City Parking Violations Bureau judge, who thought he had found a way to challenge the validity of every parking ticket Nassau County has issued for years.


Yeltsin Opposes Expansion Of NATO in Eastern Europe
President Boris N. Yeltsin, apparently under pressure from his armed forces, has sent a letter to President Clinton opposing any expansion of NATO to include East European nations like Poland or the Czech Republic, Western diplomats said today.
Sent after President Yeltsin dissolved Parliament on Sept. 21 and embarked on a collision course with members opposed to his reforms, the letter amounts to sharp retreat from the position the Russian leader outlined during a visit to Warsaw in August.
At the time he expressed understanding of Poland's desire to join NATO and said it did not threaten Russian interests.

Toronto Journal; Russians Are Coming, but for Money
Thanks to relatively loose entry policies, tens of thousands of Russians have settled in Canada in recent years.
Many are Jews who sought refuge from oppression in the former Soviet Union.
But now Toronto is feeling a new wave of Russian immigration: the wheeler-dealers.
They are among the new economic immigrants and are young, aggressive, ambitious capitalists using Toronto as a base for deals with the mother country.


Reizl Bozyk, an Enduring Star Of the Yiddish Stage, Dies at 79
Reizl Bozyk, an actress who received top billing in the Yiddish theater for more than 60 years, died on Thursday at St.
Vincent's Hospital Medical Center.
She was 79 and lived on the Lower East Side.
Mrs.
Bozyk was an enduring star of the Yiddish stage here and earlier in Poland and Argentina, appearing in hundreds of productions, often as a comedian and later as the familar mother or mother-in-law character who often stole the show.


Lewis Stumbles Early, but Bruno Crumbles Later
He certainly looked like a heavyweight champion, as he stood there in the frosty early-morning air with his long arms thrust high and his Agassi-sized entourage milling around him.
But no matter how good a left hook Lennox Lewis threw in the seventh round to send countryman Frank Bruno reeling into yet another championship-bout funk, his performance at Cardiff Arms Park should not be enough to trouble the hearts and minds of his real heavyweight competition.

Rose Bowl? Northwestern? Laugh Track Is on Pause
The convincing continues.
Several extremely un-Northwestern things have happened in only Gary Barnett's second season as the football coach of the Wildcats, more than a year after his challenge -- "EXPECT VICTORY" -- attracted skeptical wisecracks as it confronted decades of disappointment.
First, an impressive defeat at Notre Dame was looked upon as a loss.
The powerful emotions of a come-from-behind victory over Boston College -- a team that defeated the Wildcats 49-0 a season ago -- were eventually replaced by a realization of the flaws that had created the deficit.
Then last week, as a businesslike victory over Wake Forest was greeted with cheers, the goal posts remained in place at Dyche Stadium.


Yeltsin's No Jefferson. More Like Pinochet.
President Boris Yeltsin's move to dissolve the Russian Parliament came as quite a surprise, considering that he narrowly escaped impeachment last March when he tried the same thing.
But even more surprising is the insensitivity of so many Western leaders and experts who have rushed to justify his actions.
The universal excuse is that Mr.
Yeltsin is "the democratically elected President of Russia." Does election thereby give him the right, any more than President Clinton, say, to rule by decree and dispense with the democratically elected legislature?

The Real Costs of Mideast Peace
After a rousing sermon, the astute preacher passes the plate.
So, after the historic Rabin-Arafat handshake, the Clinton Administration yesterday raised more than $2 billion in pledges of international aid for Palestinians, including an unexpected $100 million offer from Saudi Arabia.
That's a splendid start.
But open borders and freer trade are what will truly make the West Bank bloom.
On that score, Israel's Arab neighbors still seem unwilling to take the smallest risk for peace.

"Nigeria's Leader Deplores 'Stigma,' " (news article, Sept. 19) reports an interview with Ernest Shonekan, who succeeded Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida, at the general's approval, after the former military ruler annulled last June's election.
The claim by Mr.
Shonekan that he is not "somebody's puppet" is debatable, but his remarks to your correspondent betray a lack of commitment to democracy that bears a striking resemblance to that of his military predecessors.


Officers Describe Police Watchdog Agency as Ineffectual
As hearings into corruption in the New York City Police Department resumed yesterday, two former narcotics officers described the department's internal watchdog agency as disorganized, incompetent and so ineffectual that honest police officers feared reporting their crooked colleagues.
In steady voices that at times cracked with emotion, Sgt.
James Dowd and Lieut.
James Wood told a vivid tale of how they came forward last year with evidence that two colleagues were selling heroin, only to despair as, they said, the department's internal investigators bungled the inquiry and finally turned the investigation toward them.


Armed Standoff Continues as Russian Parliament Disavows a Pact
An early-morning agreement to disarm the irregular defenders of the besieged Russian Parliament collapsed after a few hours today when hard-core legislators disowned their negotiators and threw out the pact.
The agreement, reached at 2:40 A.M., was the first break in the tense standoff, promising at least to lift the threat of a lethal clash between heavily armed defenders inside the Parliament building, called the White House, and a huge ring of security forces outside.

Japan Hails Clinton's Approval of Tokyo's Plutonium Project
After fearing for months that its multibillion-dollar civilian plutonium project could be scuttled, the Japanese Government is expressing relief that the Clinton Administration's new nonproliferation policy contains an exception that will allow Japan and Western Europe to keep producing near-weapons grade material for a new generation of nuclear power plants.
The Administration's declaration, which had been the focus of intense Japanese interest and lobbying, was contained in a policy statement released after President Clinton's speech at the United Nations on Monday.
While calling for an end of plutonium production for weapons, it stipulates that while "the United States does not encourage the civil use of plutonium," it will "maintain its existing commitments" permitting Japan and several European nations to turn nuclear waste into plutonium fuel.

Asbestos Crisis Is Exposing Broader Neglect in Schools
The plumbing is so decrepit in one New York City school that the toilets will not flush and the bathrooms stink.
A leaking roof in another sends rainwater seeping through classroom walls.
And because the lunchroom is sealed off in a third school, children sit on the ground in the schoolyard to eat cold lunches.
Parents of public-school children recounted those and other dismal stories at a City Hall rally yesterday, one of several recent outpourings of anger by parents who, aroused by the asbestos crisis, have begun to express broader concerns over the crumbling state of the city's school buildings.


U.S. Aides Call for Pressing U.N. on Somalia Settlement
Mapping out details of the new strategy on Somalia, Administration officials agreed today to press the United Nations to move faster to reach a political settlement and deploy troops of other nations, but set no deadline for the withdrawal of American forces, Administration officials said.
The recommendations of a high-level group of Somalia specialists, from the Pentagon, State Department, National Security Council and American mission to the United Nations, now go to senior Administration policy makers, who will probably use the positions to try to influence top United Nations officials.

After 45 years of meeting secretly, disguised by wigs, Arab headdresses, floppy hats and dark sunglasses, Israeli and Jordanian leaders finally came in from the cold today and shook hands at the White House to confirm to the world that they are indeed normalizing their diplomatic and economic relations.
Israel's Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, and Crown Prince Hassan -- the younger brother of King Hussein of Jordan -- met jointly with President Clinton in the Oval Office this afternoon.
Then, escorted by Mr.
Clinton, each addressed a small group of reporters gathered on the South Lawn, explaining plans to set up committees to promote economic cooperation between their two countries.

Review/Film; Custom-Making Freaks With the Use of Chemicals
In "Freaked," a rambunctiously slobbering entrant in the "Toxic Avenger" school of gross-out movie comedy, Alex Winter plays Ricky Coogin, a greedy television star who is chemically transformed into a freak-show attraction for a South American carnival.
Ricky's altered appearance is his comeuppance for agreeing to be the $5 million spokesman for the nefarious E.E.S. (Everything Except Shoes) Corporation, which markets a toxic fertilizer called Zygrot-24 in the third world.
When Alex and two companions stumble upon a mysterious sideshow on a South American hillside, its mad-scientist proprieter (Randy Quaid) imprisons them and hooks them to a computerized monster-making machine.
After swabbing them with Zygrot-24, a noxious green slime that spews throughout the movie, he presses "enter" on the junk-heap contraption and turns them into custom-made freaks.

Blanchard Kicks Away Jets' Doubts
The good news about the place-kicking of the Jets this season is that there is no bad news.
Cary Blanchard, the second-year pro out of Oklahoma State, is leading the team in scoring for the second straight year, with 23 points.
He has been 11 for 11 on extra points and 4 for 5 on field goals.
He's doing his job, and that's no big deal for a kicker.
It's quite a contrast from last season, when the Jets lost their first four games until Blanchard arrived after being waived by New Orleans and replaced Jason Staurovsky.
In his debut, Blanchard kicked 3 field goals and 2 extra points in a 30-21 Jets victory over New England.


Oils Lead Stocks Rally, With Dow Rising 25.99
Following a weak performance in its previous session, the stock market bounced back yesterday, rallying ahead of a firm bond market that was reacting to a batch of economic reports that confirmed the economy was still on a slow-growth path.
The smaller-than-expected September rise in the index of the National Association of Purchasing Managers, helped lift bond prices, which generally rally on weak economic reports that, traders think, may influence the Fed to keep interest rates low.


City Councilman Accused in Report
A veteran New York City Councilman repeatedly violated ethics rules in the City Charter by lobbying city officials in the mid-1980's on behalf of private garbage haulers with whom he had business dealings, a report by the Department of Investigation has concluded.
The investigation of the Councilman, Michael DeMarco, Democrat of the Bronx, found "substantial evidence" that the 23-year Council veteran violated conflict-of-interest rules in at least five separate instances by representing several private haulers before the Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates the garbage industry.

Filling a Hole Left by Mother Nature


On Trying Alternative Medicine for Migraine
To the Editor:
I was very impressed with "Mystery of Migraine Begins to Yield Genetic Clues" (Science Times, Sept. 14).
For the 25 years I have practiced medicine, I have done a lot of study of this topic because I suffer from migraine myself.
Whenever the cause of a disease is not clearly defined, more and more expensive medicines are poured into the market to give symptomatic relief.
Under these circumstances, it would be prudent to look at other time proven alternative medicines, such as homeopathy.
Homeopathy believes in providing relief from a condition by giving very small doses of drugs that in large doses would produce symptoms like that condition.
What homeopathy believes to be the cause of the condition remains unestablished, as far as Western medicine is concerned.


Bonds Swings the Pressure Back Toward the Braves
Atlanta Braves Manager Bobby Cox didn't want the last weekend of the season to be this way, of course -- sitting and watching games from the West Coast, hoping for help from forces out of his control.
"I'd rather have a lead -- I was looking for a five- or six-game advantage, but you can't do anything about it, so here we are," Cox said bravely today, before sending his team out in search of a victory over the Colorado Rockies.

Classical Music in Review
Guy Klucevsek  Accordionist Dance Theater Workshop 219 West 19th Street Chelsea
Guy Klucevsek has taken the accordion deep into unaccustomed experimental spaces, commissioning pieces from various downtown composers.
He is also a composer himself, a Minimalist with gentler pop leanings.
On Monday night at the Dance Theater Workshop, he led the New York premieres of two recent works: "The Palatine Light" (1985), a song cycle on an 18th-century maritime theme, and "Fallen Shadows" (1993), a musical and theatrical meditation on aging opera singers.
The instrumentalists in each piece were Phillip Bush, pianist; Mary Rowell, violinist and violist, and Mr.
Klucevsek; the soprano soloist was the remarkably versatile Dora Ohrenstein.


Searching for a Haven With Safety and Reward
THE last time the stock market dropped as much as 10 percent, Saddam Hussein's tanks were storming across Kuwait.
Saddam ultimately retreated, and since that 1990 invasion, stocks have surged without pause.
Only one other time since 1915 has the Dow gone three years without a 10 percent fall, according to Philip Smyth of Birinyi Associates -- and that streak ended in 1987.
The rally in the mid-80's was much sharper than the current one, so a decline now probably wouldn't be as terrifying.
Still, many mutual fund investors are looking for havens.
Most of the available shelters appear flimsy.
Stocks are pricey by almost any measure, but the most obvious alternatives are either risky, unrewarding or unfamiliar.


A Legislative Infant, Needing Care
Two years ago Congress established a modest but imaginative program to underwrite the overseas study of critical non-Western languages like Arabic, Chinese and Japanese.
It would plug a huge hole in America's education system.
Some Congressmen voted for the bill in the belief that America's intelligence failures over the years had been caused partly by the shortage of people qualified in non-traditional languages and area studies.
Others, looking to the future, hoped the program would sharpen America's skills in a competitive global economy.

Review/Opera; Older Productions Stir Memories, Memories
Before the Metropolitan Opera gets down to the season's real agenda with an interesting run of new productions, it is putting some old ones back on the stage.
On Thursday evening, it was the turn of Beethoven's "Fidelio," in Otto Schenk's production from 1970.
Boris Aronson's sets and costumes for this prison opera were purposefully sparse and gray to begin with, in telling contrast to the luminous music, and have grown only dingier over the years.
But they evoke wonderful memories, not so much of whole evenings as of individual efforts: Jon Vickers's riveting Florestan, manic yet noble; moments of vocal and dramatic splendor from Leonie Rysanek and Hildegard Behrens in the title role; an account of the "Leonore" Overture No. 3 so compellingly paced by Klaus Tennstedt as almost to justify its awkward use as entr'acte.


Corrections
A picture yesterday with an article about the impact of the Clinton health plan on drug companies, showing a man standing in a doorway, was published in error.
It showed Joseph Vitale, deputy director of Gov.
Jim Florio's Council for a Drug-Free Workplace, not G. Kirk Raab, chief executive of Genentech Inc.


43 Nations Promise Palestinians $2 Billion in Aid
Delegates from 43 nations today promised about $2 billion in aid over the next five years for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as Saudi Arabia put aside its anger at the Palestinians for supporting Iraq in the Persian Gulf war and pitched in $100 million.
Recognizing that peace is firmer when buttressed by prosperity, the nations promised $600 million in aid for this year alone, and American officials said they were confident that the contributions would ultimately far exceed their $2 billion goal.


Corrections
Because of a production error, part of an article headlined "Star Ready for Off Broadway" appeared on some copies of the Law page yesterday.
It was a duplicate of material that had appeared on Wednesday, on page C13; the space it occupied yesterday was intended for an advertisement.


Hotel Business Is Waking Up
After 11 consecutive years of losses totaling more than $33 billion, the United States hotel industry is heading for its first profit since 1981.
Occupancy rates are rising almost everywhere, with many hotel chains reporting their best year for a long time.
"Our forecasts indicate that the lodging industry will show a profit of a half-million to $1 billion this year," said Bjorn Hanson, the industry analyst for the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.


A New Member for a New Term


A Sizzling Third-Quarter Performance, at Home and Abroad
Investors may be living dangerously, but what a living.
As skepticism mounted in the third quarter about whether the rallies in the stock and bond markets could continue, mutual funds posted especially strong returns.
They were aided by a surge in stocks of small companies and continuing declines in interest rates, both domestically and abroad.
Funds that invest in stocks of American companies turned in their best performance of the year.
The average domestic stock fund had a total return of 5 percent in the latest quarter, more than twice the return in the second quarter.
Foreign stock funds did even better, returning 8.8 percent.


REPORT ON SIEGE IN TEXAS IS SAID TO BLAME AGENTS
A Justice Department report on the fire that consumed a cult compound near Waco, Tex., and killed most of the group's members criticizes mid- and lower-level Federal agents there who recommended that negotiations be abandoned in favor of a tear-gas assault, according to law-enforcement and Administration officials who have read the report.
But the report is said to clear senior officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Attorney General Janet Reno of making any significant mistakes, even though Ms.
Reno, acting on the advice of the senior bureau officials, ordered the assault on April 19 in which armored vehicles punched holes in the compound and filled it with tear gas.


New Issues Were at Record Pace in Third Quarter
Corporations issued new stocks and bonds at a record pace in the third quarter, producing more than $2.2 billion in fees for securities firms that are in the midst of their third consecutive year of record profits.
After three years of rising stock prices and falling interest rates, the financial markets are as hospitable as many corporate treasurers have ever seen.
Increasingly, American investors' strong demand is attracting foreign borrowers.
Italy, for example, sold about 30 percent of its $5.5 billion global bond offering to Americans earlier this month, and YPF Sociedad, the Argentine oil company, had a $3 billion stock offering in late July that was bought largely by investors in America and Europe.


Lighting Up the Lawyers
Clients who lodge a complaint against a New York lawyer often feel as if they're "sending a letter to the Bermuda Triangle," observes the state's Chief Administrative Judge, Leo Milonas.
Judge Milonas is among the bar leaders now calling on the State Legislature to allow public access to disciplinary proceedings against lawyers.
In 28 states, disciplinary proceedings are open to the public once a grievance committee files formal charges.
Three other states -- Oregon, Florida and West Virginia -- open proceedings to the public even earlier.


Watch for Distributions As Year Winds Down
NOVICE mutual fund investors can slide into tax traps, particularly in the fourth quarter.
But with a modicum of knowledge about how funds work, they can play the tax laws to their own advantage.
Funds distribute three kinds of income to shareholders: capital gains the fund has received selling securities in its portfolio, dividends paid by securities it holds and interest earned on bonds or similar holdings.
An investor who sells fund shares at a profit also earns capital gains directly.


Classical Music in Review
Maria Bachmann  Violinist Weill Recital Hall
In the six years since Maria Bachmann made her New York debut, she and her regular recital partner, Jon Klibonoff, have offered several pleasingly challenging programs.
Some have been laden with contemporary works, which Ms.
Bachmann plays with facility and expressivity; others have offered standard repertory in refreshingly individualistic readings.
The surprising yet consistently persuasive interpretive turns Ms.
Bachmann and Mr.
Klibonoff took in a Beethoven "Kreutzer" Sonata four seasons ago made a lasting impression.
And their performance on Wednesday evening reminded a listener that making new works sound familiar and familiar works seem new is a talent to be prized.

An Area Of Mutual Discipline
Salvatore Centino of Piscataway, N.J., was not particularly concerned about how much he would pay in sales commissions when he chose to buy a contractual mutual fund 10 years ago.
He was -- and remains -- sold on the performance.
"All I know is that I have put in $6,000 over the last 10 years, and it's now worth $12,353," he said.
"That's not bad!"
Sold exclusively through brokers, contractual funds require someone to make a long-term commitment -- usually 15 years -- to invest a certain sum each month, say $100.


HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL REPORT
Scouting the Top Teams  Following are the scouting reports for this weekend's top games in the Public Schools Athletic League and Catholic High Schools Football League as well as for New Jersey, Connecticut, Westchester County and Rockland County.
The teams' records are in parentheses.
P.S.A.L.
Sheepshead Bay (2-0) at Lafayette (1-2) Key Players: Both teams feature a ball-control offense and rely on hard-hitting defensive units.
"Brooklyn football is like the Midwest," said Sheepshead Bay Coach Dick Reilly.
"It's bang-bang football." Lafayette's linemen may have trouble moving defensive end Elvis Abellard (19 tackles) and Company off the ball, as the Frenchies are significantly smaller than the Skippers up front.
Lafayette will probably have to throw the ball to create running lanes.
Sheepshead Bay features a more balanced attack, as Michael Reilly, the coach's son, is a smart quarterback with an accurate arm to complement the fine running combination of Kwesi Daniels and Joe Coffey.
Daniels received Sheepshead Bay's game ball last week after rushing for 145 yards on 18 carries and 1 touchdown in the 15-14 victory over Curtis.
Daniels also registered 15 tackles and 2 sacks as a linebacker.
Comment: Lafayette has won the last two meetings against Sheepshead Bay in the closing seconds.
Lafayette defeated the Skippers, 13-6, last year and by 19-17 in 1991.
"Those are the ones that put the white back into your beard," said Reilly, Sheepshead Bay's coach.
Lehman (1-1) at South Shore (0-2) Key Players: What South Shore quarterback Adrian Nazario lacks in size (5 foot 5 inches, and 150 pounds), he makes up in heart.
"He's a tough kid," said Coach Stan Feldman.
"He gets knocked down and he pops right back up. He's our leader." Nonetheless, the Vikings' offense still depends on the running of Tracey McDonald, Carlos Cromwell and Dwayne Bennett.
Lehman needs Robert Talley to rebound from last week's 30-7 loss to Canarsie, in which he was limited to 27 yards rushing on 10 carries.
Comment: South Shore has yet to score a point this season, losing by 26-0 in its opener against Curtis and by 20-0 to Lincoln.
"I'm really proud of the boys," said Feldman.
"They haven't given up, and they've been gung-ho in practice."  C.H.S.F.L.
Spellman (2-1) at St.
John the Baptist (3-0) Key Players: St.
John the Baptist's offense is ranked No. 1 in the A Division, averaging 271.3 yards a game.
Eric Martin (31 of 55 for 533 yards, 5 touchdowns, 1 interception), who is the division's leading passer, has three sure-handed targets in tight end Robert Kelly (11 receptions for 219 yards, 2 touchdowns), wide receiver Dennis McGuire (6 for 100 yards, 1 touchdown) and running back Mike Grippo (11 for 163 yards, 2 touchdowns).
Martin's counterpart, David Rodriguez, is a pretty good signal caller himself, passing for 2 touchdowns and rushing for 2 others.
Rodriguez's favorite receiver is Michael Baptiste (4 catches for 71 yards, 1 touchdown).
Comment: Jay Byrne Gamble, the St.
John the Baptist coach, is back after a 10-year hiatus.
He has returned to the school where he had three consecutive Metro Bowl titles after serving part of the time as an assistant coach at Hofstra University.
His presence, along with a new staff of assistants, has helped turn around a program that had a 12-35-1 record over the past three years.
St.
Anthony (3-0) vs.
Nazareth (2-0)  at Canarsie Key Players: St.
Anthony has averaged a league-best 369 yards on the ground a game, while the Kingsmen defense has allowed a league-low of 89 yards rushing.
The Friars' offense, which averages over 30 points a game, revolves around the backfield of Tony Williams (38 carries for 615 yards, 6 touchdowns), who is the league's leading gainer, and Dan Shea (22 carries for 268 yards, 6 touchdowns).
Nazareth boasts a good inside (Julien Dale) and outside (Gordon Tunison) running attack.
Dale, a 6-foot, 220-pound fullback, has carried 28 times for 182 yards and 3 touchdowns.
Tinson is a 5-5, 140-pound tailback who has rushed 17 times for 218 yards and 3 touchdowns.
Comment: St.
Anthony's backfield is quick and has been aided by playing all of its games on Astroturf, an advantage that St.
Anthony's runners will enjoy once again this afternoon.
Long Island  Longwood (1-0) at Brentwood (0-1) Key Players: Longwood's backfield of Jason Schuster (4.6 for 40 yards), John Lange (4.7 speed) and quarterback Eric Brown (4.5 speed) is lightning quick.
The threesome combined last week for over 400 yards rushing in a 35-7 victory over Ward Melville.
Felipe Sabino will do most of Brentwood's running behind Carl Matzen (6-2, 286-pound tackle) and John Alvarado (6-2, 250-pound guard), both of whom anchor the right side.
Comment: Longwood is ranked No. 2 in Suffolk County and 21st in New York State by the Sports Writers Association.
Last year, Longwood lost to Connetquot, 28-7, in the county's final.
"I think that experience is going to help us," said Schuster.
"We experienced what it's like, and hopefully we're going to learn from it." New Jersey  Elizabeth (1-0) at Linden (1-0) Key Players: Elizabeth is once again loaded with Division 1 talent: tailback Kaream Bowser, Sharod Williams (wr-db), Hector Sepuleeda (dt-og) and linebacker Frank Chmiel are all being heavily recruited by colleges.
This talented bunch is directed by sophomore Al Hawkins, who is a "scary quarterback who could throw the long ball off his heels," said Linden Coach James McDonald.
Linden's two blue-chip prospects are two-way ends Mike Pringley (6-4, 218) and Dave Biles (6-4, 275).
Comment: Last year, Elizabeth had eight Division 1 players but only managed a 5-4 record.
"We had a bunch of superstars that were only interested in themselves," said Coach Jerry Moore.
He added that this year's team works better together.
"I like the chemistry of this group. They work hard and are very aggressive. And when we hit you, you stay hit. They are playing Elizabeth's style of football."  Fieldston (1-1) at Dwight-Englewood (0-2) Key Players: "To let Gus Ornstein set up is to set yourself up to get beat," Englewood Coach Dave Hansburg said of Fieldston's quarterback.
Ornstein (16 of 35 for 219, 1 touchdown, 1 interception), who is being recruited by Michigan, Notre Dame and Miami as a quarterback and first baseman, has the ability to pick apart opposing defenses if given the time.
Sam Gilbert (4 catches, 122 yards, 1 td) is Fieldston's deep threat.
Fieldston will have to contain the Bulldogs backfield of Josh Walsky, Rick Komotar and Steve Milo.
Comment: The outcome will be determined on the line of scrimmage, where Fieldston's over-matched line will be called upon to hold back the rush of tackles Luis Locuroto and Matt Seiff.
Connecticut  Bassick (1-1) at Darien (1-1) Key Players: Johnny Barnes (23 carries for 154 yards, 3 touchdowns) is the best of Bassick's speedy backs capable of springing at any time.
James Hanford (172 yards rushing and 3 touchdowns) and Vince Childress (181 yards, 2 touchdowns) share the running duties for Darien.
Jeff Eaton's (13 for 32 for 221 yards, 2 touchdowns) ability to complete the short passes gives the Blue Wave's offense a more diversified attack than Bassick's.
Chris Robbins (9 catches for 193 yards, 1 touchdown) is Eaton's primary target.
Comment: Darien Coach Mike Sangster says he plans to drop a few plays from the teams' playbook after losing by 21-20 to Greenwich last week, snapping the teams' 16-game unbeaten string.
"I just think that we made too many mistakes last week and that we need to go back to the basics," he said.
Westchester and Rockland  North Rockland (3-0) at Roosevelt (3-0) Key Players: While both teams are comparable in size, North Rockland's linemen hold the advantage over the Indians' less experienced big men.
Tom Morreira (tackle, 6-2, 270), Conrad Bartosik (guard, 6-0, 200), Ed Teitz (center, 6-2, 260), Tom Johnson (guard, 6-0, 200) and Rajah Winn (tackle, 5-9, 260) will need to gain maturity in a hurry and find a way to open holes for Roosevelt's star runner, Franklin McBride.
He has rushed for 4 scores and over 100 yards in each of the teams' games.
McBride's counterpart is Marcus Larkins, a 5-8, 170-pound runner who has rushed for 344 yards and 5 touchdowns.
Raiders quarterback Jeff Becker (12 of 25 for 281 yards, 5 touchdowns) is a quality drop-back passer who sees the whole field and delivers the ball with accuracy.
Comment: "This could be the biggest game ever played in Westchester and Rockland County," said Roosevelt Coach Tony Dematteo.
The teams have never met during the regular season.
The game will be carried live on Channel 3 on TCI Cable.


Synchronized Swimmer May Yet Win Gold
SYLVIE FRECHETTE, the synchronized swimmer from Canada who was denied a 1992 Olympic gold medal because of a judge's mistake, has gained the backing of swimming's world governing body in getting one now.
Canadian Olympic officials said yesterday they were informed by the world organization FINA that it would recommend to the International Olympic Committee that Frechette be awarded a duplicate gold medal for the solo synchronized swimming competition at the Barcelona Games.


Chrysler Settles on a Tentative Labor Pact
The United Automobile Workers union and the Chrysler Corporation reached a tentative agreement on a three-year labor contract shortly before dawn today.
The pact, which mimics an agreement reached by the Ford Motor Company last week, sets up the union's final round of bargaining, scheduled with the General Motors Corporation next week.


Gas Tax Hits, and Drivers Aren't Happy
With resignation and skepticism, the public began making its first contributions to reducing the Federal budget deficit today when around the country motorists woke up to President Clinton's new gasoline tax and slightly higher prices at the pump.
There was chaos at some service stations Thursday night before the 4.3-cents-a-gallon increase went into effect, with some people idling in lines to save a dime or two.
There were reports of truck drivers protesting the tax and disrupting traffic by driving the speed limit in tandem on highways in the Midwest.


Yankees Clinch Second But .300 Eludes Boggs
Wade Boggs had a gorgeous chance in the eighth inning.
A single would have scored Bernie Williams from third base with the go-ahead run, would have increased Boggs's average to .301 and probably would have finished his season.
With a .300 average and two games left, Boggs probably would not have lifted a bat again.
But he botched the chance.
In a scrappy at-bat against Detroit's Bob MacDonald, Boggs fouled off four two-strike pitches before he struck out, left two runners stranded and also left his baseball calendar open for at least one more day.
A .300 average eluded him.


Well, They All Do Wear Numbers
Last year, when former Red Sox Manager JOE MORGAN compared some baseball players unfavorably to race horses in a radio commercial for Suffolk Downs, the Red Sox took offense.
This year, the team is doing more than just grumble.
Its law firm sent a letter to the track's chairman, saying "any unauthorized use of the name and trademarks" of the Red Sox or the making of "any false or disparaging statements" about them in a new radio spot to be aired on Sunday "will not be tolerated."


American Express Gets Big U.S. Card Account
American Express strengthened its corporate card business yesterday, announcing that it had been awarded the worldwide charge card contract of the General Services Administration, the agency that buys equipment and services for the Government.
The contract, covering 900,000 employees who charge some $2.5 billion annually on travel and entertainment, is the largest commercial travel card account in the world.
It is a one-year contract, effective Nov. 30, and contains four one-year extension options.


Sale of Post To Murdoch Is Completed
Rupert Murdoch formally bought The New York Post yesterday and, ignoring the lone striking union, planned to force its members to apply for their jobs.
With the striking New York Newspaper Guild clearly defeated and appearing near surrender after Mr.
Murdoch and The Post's production unions joined together on Thursday, the guild's only remaining choices appeared to be among various forms of damage control.


There Are Cheaper and Better Ways to Win the War on Drugs
To the Editor:
The National Security Council has concluded what every cop in America has known for years: the Pentagon's programs to fight drug smuggling don't work (news article, Sept. 17).
This year, the Pentagon will spend $1.1 billion to stop the supply of drugs into this country.
A lot of this money goes to radar planes and Navy cruisers to detect drug traffickers along the southern United States border.
The Coast Guard and Customs Service spend $1 billion more.
And we've spent $1.5 billion to date fighting drug production in the Andes.


Not Vietcong's Fault
To the Editor:
The brief Associated Press article on the retirement of the aircraft carrier Forrestal (Sept. 12) repeatedly refers to a "Vietcong firebombing" in 1967.
This is in error.
At 10:51 A.M. on July 29, 1967, the Forrestal was in the fifth day of its first (and last) period off the coast of North Vietnam.
Fire broke out at the aft end of the flight deck as the ship was preparing to launch the second strike of the day.
Fed by fuel and exploding ordinance, the fire spread forward, almost as far as the island structure, eventually causing the death of 134 crewman.


In Suburbs, Voters' Minds Wander; Candidates Say New York City Still Gets Residents' Attention
When Michael G. Cherkasky and Jeanine Pirro compete for votes on Westchester County's train platforms, they share a challenge peculiar to suburban politicians: trying to seize the attention of many people whose political hearts and minds are in New York City, where they cannot vote.
These commuters live, vote and pay most of their taxes in Westchester, but many if not most seem far more beguiled by the mayoral race between David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani than by any Westchester race, including the one between Mr.
Cherkasky and Mrs.
Pirro for district attorney.


Collagen-Bard Treatment Of Incontinence Is Approved
The Collagen Corporation and C. R. Bard Inc. said today that the Food and Drug Administration had approved the marketing of their treatment of stress urinary incontinence.
Collagen, based in Palo Alto, Calif., will manufacture the Contigen Bard Collagen Implant, which is an injectable protein.
The product will be marketed by Bard, a medical supplies company based in Murray Hill, N.J.


Brooklyn Man Dies Trying to Save Daughter From Fire
A father who raced back into his burning Brooklyn home to rescue his 12-year-old daughter died early yesterday, hours after flames from what was apparently an electrical fire swept through the house, leaving every wall charred or blackened by smoke, fire officials said.
Neighbors said that in the chaotic first moments of the predawn blaze, the girl, Jennifer Lundgren, had gone back into the house to save her dog.


Giuliani's Affirmative-Action Plan Steps Up Policy Fight
By saying he would eliminate New York City's affirmative action program for minority contractors, Rudolph W. Giuliani has waged his most direct assault on Mayor David N. Dinkins's economic development policies and targeted a program that has won wide support among black, female and Hispanic voters.
Mr.
Giuliani, who is campaigning on a platform of cutting city spending and taxes, has also underscored a personal philosophy that precludes the use of economic incentives to promote social advancement at the expense of government efficiency and free-market competition.


To Russians, Ballet Appeals At Least as Much as Politics
The Seventh Moscow International Ballet Competition, which ends Saturday night with a gala concert, has been memorable for filling the red velvet and gilt stalls at the Bolshoi Theater for two weeks straight, despite swarms of grim militiamen blocking off city streets in the battle for Parliament.
The competition, dedicated to the choreography of Marius Petipa, may also be remembered as much for the prizes that were not awarded as for those that were.
Top winners in the competition were Yelena Knyazkova, a Russian who won the women's gold medal in the couples category, and Morihiro Ivata from Japan and Bernard Gourteau de Bouteille from France, who shared the gold in the men's soloist category.
No gold medals were awarded to men in the couples competition or to women in the soloist category, and no grand prix was awarded; it rarely is in Moscow.


Review/Film Festival; In China, The Personal Is Political
In China it can't be easy being a film maker, someone who wants to explore onscreen the contradictory events that have shaped not only the Communist revolution but also his own life.
It's a delicate, complicated task.
The film maker is dependent on Government departments created by the same system whose legacies he's examining.
The production and release of any film of this kind thus become something of a triumph.
Such a film is "The Blue Kite," which will be shown at the New York Film Festival this afternoon at 2:30.
Co-produced by the Chinese Government and private Hong Kong movie interests, it's the work of Tian Zhuangzhuang, whose "Horse Thief" was seen at the Film Forum in 1988.


Reviews/Film Festival; A Movie Where All the Motion Is Metaphorical
The sole visual content of Derek Jarman's film "Blue" is the color blue projected uninterruptedly and without variation for the movie's entire 76 minutes.
Against this field of color so evocative of sky, ocean, blindness, heaven and eternity unfolds a soundtrack of music, poetry and scalding excerpts from a diary by the English film maker who has been living with AIDS for several years.
"Blue," which the New York Film Festival is presenting at Alice Tully Hall tomorrow evening at 9:30, is by turns heartbreaking, enraged, boring, pretentious and riveting.
The narration, delivered with a stately equanimity by John Quentin, Nigel Terry and Tilda Swinton, is interwoven with music and sound effects to suggest a stream of consciousness that is continually changing levels.
There are moments when the film maker's spirit seems on the verge of taking leave of his body and drifting into the ether.
At other times the writing is so incendiary that he seems ready to jump out of his sickbed and burn down the hospital.


Classical Music in Review
Symphony for United Nations  Carnegie Hall
The Symphony for United Nations Benefit Concert for Bosnian Refugees on Wednesday night surrounded Marvin Hamlisch's "Anatomy of Peace" with works by Beethoven -- both, in the main, not very peaceful at all.
It was an interesting contrast in strategies: Beethoven shaking listeners by the shoulder and compelling attention, Mr.
Hamlisch wooing them with comfortable familiarities.


Latin America. Eastern Europe. Smaller Investors Expand Reach
Americans' hot romance with foreign stock funds shows no sign of cooling off.
"The American investor has always had an interest in foreign funds, but it's been heightened," said John R. Horseman, investment manager of Global Asset Management's International Fund, in a telephone interview from his London office.
"As we go into 1994, increasingly, that investor is looking around and putting bigger shares of money outside" the United States.


Critics Dismiss State Proposal For a Stadium in Manhattan
Opposition to a proposal to build a new stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan sprouted yesterday like mushrooms on Miracle-Gro, with community advocates predicting an almost endless series of lawsuits that would delay the project for years, perhaps decades.
Neighborhood leaders and community advocates, including veterans of the successful battle against Westway, dismissed the state plan as a diversion and little more than grasping at straws.
They said it would hurt the area by adding to rush-hour commuting delays, worsening pollution and cutting off access to the riverfront.


G. Brillembourg, 35, Tax Lawyer, Writer And Alpine Climber
Gustavo E. Brillembourg, a tax lawyer at the New York firm of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, died on Tuesday night after he fell 120 feet from a mountain ledge he was climbing in the Yosemite Valley in California.
He was 35 and lived in Manhattan.
Mr.
Brillembourg took part in a number of large corporate mergers and acquisitions in the 1980's, including the formation of the drug company SmithKline Beecham.


Classical Music in Review
New York Philharmonic Avery Fisher Hall
Listeners unaccustomed to Bruckner's music are startled if not vaguely repelled by its generosity.
So much of the repertory they have learned to value celebrates concision and momentum.
The message of Bruckner's Fourth Symphony, which Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic played on Thursday night, says something different: that nothing will be hurried and that there will always be more time.


Thomas F. Jones, 71, Waterfront Investigator
Thomas F. Jones, former chief investigator of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, died on Tuesday at Lakeland Regional Medical Center in Lakeland, Fla.
He was 71.
The cause of death was heart failure, said a daughter, Kathleen Ogle.


NAVY OFFICIAL ASKS OUSTER OF ADMIRAL IN TAILHOOK CASE
Navy Secretary John H. Dalton has asked for the removal of the Navy's top officer, Adm.
Frank B. Kelso 2d, for failing to show proper leadership at a convention of naval aviators in 1991 where scores of women were assaulted, Pentagon officials said tonight.
In a sweeping indictment of senior Navy leadership, Mr.
Dalton has also notified Defense Secretary Les Aspin that he will seek disciplinary action against 12 other admirals and Marine generals who attended the 1991 Tailhook Association convention, damaging if not effectively ending their naval careers.


Lawyer Pounces on Gaps In Murder Suspect's Story
For a second day, James P. Wanger was bombarded today with tough questions about inconsistencies and gaps in his accounts of where he was and what he did on the day Robert A. Solimine Jr. was strangled.
And once again, the 19-year-old Clifton man, who is charged with garroting Mr.
Solimine on Feb. 16, 1992, tried his best to counter the testimony of three youths who said he had killed his former friend.


In Her Majesty's Service, but Without Free Soap
For the small army of courtiers and chauffeurs, stable hands and servants who attend Britain's royal family, the edict delivered this week by Buckingham Palace's management consultants was blunt and unsparing: Off with their perks!
It is all part of a plan "to rationalize and streamline" palace pay and administrative costs and bring its tradition-bound operations in line with modern business procedures.
Those include a plan announced last month to tie staff pay increases to performance instead of seniority.
Traveling Clothes
The staff that serves Queen Elizabeth II will now receive small annual cash stipends in lieu of an elaborate and ancient system of royal perquisites, which have ranged from free shoe repairs and bars of soap for household staff, to free suits for the senior courtiers who accompanied the Queen on overseas trips.


At This Care Center, Childhood Never Ends
THINGS were busy at the Day Care Center on the top floor of the Van Etten building of the Bronx Municipal Hospital.
In the intermediate class, the one for 3-year-olds, a little boy in brown overalls who said his name was Superman took a visitor by the hand and led him to a box with plastic animals.
"This is the biggest dinosaur," he said.
"Grrrrr," he said showing his own teeth.
Then he picked up a zebra and had it fight the purple dinosaur, making the creatures dance and bashing their heads together.
When the fight stopped he brought the animals close so that their faces touched and he made a kissing sound.


Man Found Guilty of Selling Arms To Groups of White Supremacists
A man with ties to white supremacists was convicted today of making illegal weapons and selling them to hate groups.
In the trial, the first growing out of a series of raids in July against local hate groups, his wife was also convicted of conspiracy.
The man, Christian Nadal, 35, and his wife Doris, 41, were among nine people arrested in the sweep that also uncovered a plot here to assassinate prominent blacks and blow up churches and synagogues.


A Keycorp-Society Merger Is Expected to Be Disclosed
Two large banking companies, Keycorp, based in Albany, and the Society Corporation, based in Cleveland, are expected to announce on Monday that they will merge, investment bankers said yesterday.
If completed, the transaction would create a bank that would nearly blanket the Northern United States from Maine to Alaska.
With $55 billion in assets, the combined bank would be the country's 10th largest and would have a stock market capitalization of nearly $8 billion.


Corrections
An article on Monday about a New York State mental-health bill referred incorrectly to the position of state legislators on Long Island who are concerned about the proposed closing of Kings Park Psychiatric Center.
They want assurances from the state that local planning officials will have a significant voice in determining the future use of the site, rather than wanting another state use, like a prison or a substance-abuse center.


Corrections
The obituary of James H. Doolittle on Wednesday, and in late editions on Tuesday, misstated his rank.
He was promoted by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 from lieutenant general to full general.
The obituary also described B-25 bombers incorrectly.
They were medium bombers, not attack bombers.
In some copies, because of an editing error, the obituary misspelled the name of an airfield in Nassau County, L.I.
It was Mitchel Field.


Reviews/Pop; A Turn Toward Country
"We all have stories, I suppose," Joe Henry sang on Wednesday night at Fez.
"But in mine she always goes." He did have a few other topics, but as he does on his current album, "Kindness of the World" (Mammoth), he kept returning to the image of a lover left behind.
Mr.
Henry is steeped in Bob Dylan; his tunes aim for a folky simplicity, and his voice catches in his nose and the back of his throat.
Over the course of five albums, he has gradually pared away self-consciously poetic imagery and overwrought self-pity.
Although he hasn't exactly cheered up, his songs have moved toward the terse, homespun approach of country.


No Favors From Reeves for Moore
If there's one thing about Giants Coach Dan Reeves, it is that he doesn't mince words.
Today, with a big game against Buffalo looming on Sunday, he was asked about guard Eric Moore, who will become eligible on Monday after serving a four-game suspension for violating the league's substance-abuse policy.
What will the Giants do when Moore comes back?


Basically Bach
Basically Bach, an all-day festival, begins today at 1 P.M. at St.
Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street.
The festival starts with five 45-minute organ recitals performed on the hour by Judith Hancock, Christopher Creaghan, Thomas Schmidt, Walter Hilse and McNeil Robinson, respectively.
At 7:30 P.M. the St.
Peter's Choir and Orchestra, conducted by Mr.
Schmidt, will perform the cantatas No. 140 ("Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme") and No. 4 ("Christ lag in Todesbanden").
Tickets are $20 for the entire series, $5 for each organ recital and $10 for the evening concert.
Information: (212) 935-2200.


Giuliani Says Dinkins Ally Made an Anti-Italian Slur
Rudolph W. Giuliani asserted yesterday that a prominent black minister's charge that he is supported by "fascist elements" seemed intended as an anti-Italian slur and may have been part of a coordinated effort by the Dinkins campaign to use supporters to inject race into the campaign.
Mr.
Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, also said that Mayor David N. Dinkins appeared "to acquiesce" in the comments made by the Rev.
William A. Jones during an endorsement news conference on Thursday, and should have denounced Mr.
Jones forcefully.


Trombonists in a Variety Show of Traditions
The opening concert of Highlights in Jazz, at Pace University in lower Manhattan on Thursday night, was all amiability.
The show brought together the trombonists Al Grey, George Masso and Slide Hampton, and in various combinations with their rhythm section, the three produced a concert that never quite took off but didn't wither away either.
As with most of the concerts in the Highlights series, this one presented the idea that musicians from different generations and working in different styles can find a common ground, and it was fascinating to hear all the contrasts and clashes.


Beliefs
When Laurence O'Connnell was told one day last February that the White House was calling, he thought it was a practical joke.
If Dr.
O'Connell had been a medical economist, he might not have been surprised.
But instead he is a medical ethicist, president of the Park Ridge Center, a Chicago institute that studies the intersection of health care and religious beliefs.
And the call, he says now, "came out of the blue."


Romanians Don't See King as Figurehead; He Flew to England
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 14 article on King Michael describes him as being, except for a few months, "only a figurehead." Such is the nature of constitutional monarchy.
However, for the courageous 1944 action of the 23-year-old King Michael in overthrowing Ion Antonescu, the pro-Nazi dictator, he received the Legion of Merit from President Truman.
King Michael was forced to abdicate by the Communists at gunpoint in 1947.
For many Romanians he remains the one hope of a return to "freedom and democracy."


The Ad Campaign; Gulotta on the Attack
Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta has begun broadcasting a 30-second commercial and two 15-second commercials on five New York City-based television stations.
The spots charge that Mr.
Gulotta's Democratic opponent, Benjamin L. Zwirn, Supervisor of North Hempstead, has not kept his promises to cut taxes.
The campaign says it is spending $125,000 to run the ads for 10 days, not counting the purchase of time on cable.
A typical Long Island viewer is expected to see the commercials three times over the next week.
ON THE SCREEN All three commercials begin with a fairy-tale motif, with a rainbow over some hills.
Text appears at the bottom, and pages turn on screen as if it were a children's book.
Then, the commercial cuts to an unflaterring picture of Mr.
Zwirn set against a black background.


Demonstrators Seize Project In Brooklyn
About 250 Hispanic residents of the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn took over a nearly completed public housing project last night, moving in television sets, blankets and their children because they said they fear that Hasidic Jews in the neighborhood might get special treatment in gaining apartments when the project opens.
By early this morning, the protest was peaceful, and the police made no effort to evacuate the demonstrators from the 150 units at the project, at South 10th and Berry Streets.
The four buildings in the boxy brick project, developed by the New York City Housing Authority, are to be completed by November, although some units already have electricity and running water.


Microsoft To Display New Line
The Microsoft Corporation plans to introduce a new product line on Monday focusing on the home computing market.
The creation of the Microsoft Home brand will bring together a variety of the company's software applications into a single product line combining the categories of home business, games and multimedia.


Clinton and China's President Will Meet to Discuss Disputes
As part of a strategy to improve the increasingly troubled relationship between Washington and Beijing, the Clinton Administration has scheduled a number of high-level meetings with Chinese officials.
President Clinton will meet with President Jiang Zemin of China for the first time at a meeting of heads of member states of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization, a forum devoted to economic cooperation, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in New York on Thursday.
The meeting is planned for November in Seattle.


Philharmonic Seasons
To the Editor:
A Sept. 21 article on the opening of the music season erroneously refers to the New York Philharmonic's new season as its 151st.
Actually, coming 151 years after the orchestra's first season, that of 1842-43, this is its 152d.


4 Straight, But Aide For Mets Keeps Hair
It seemed somehow grotesquely apropos that on the Mets' most glorious night of 1993 -- their first four-game winning streak of the season -- there was some bad news.
Catcher Todd Hundley, in making a run-saving tag of Florida Marlins catcher Bob Natal at the plate in the third inning, suffered a nondisplaced fracture of a bone in his left wrist.
The wrist was put in a temporary sling, and Hundley will be examined in New York Tuesday.
He is expected to wear a cast for six weeks.


One More Lap for Mario Andretti
MARIO ANDRETTI will drive one more Indy-car season for the Newman-Haas Racing team and then retire, he announced yesterday.
Andretti, 53, said that he was grateful to his car owners, CARL HAAS and PAUL NEWMAN, for "giving me a job for another year."


Rangers and Devils Leery of Waiver Draft
With talent superior to the vast majority of teams in the National Hockey League, the Rangers and the Devils are susceptible to losing a player or two each in Sunday's waiver draft.
"It's the price you pay for being deep," Neil Smith, the general manager of the Rangers, said last night before the Rangers concluded their preseason with a 4-1 victory over the Devils at Madison Square Garden.
"I think we'll lose at least one."


Female Goalie to Get a Tryout
ERIN WHITTEN, the second woman to play professional hockey, will get a tryout next week with the Toledo Storm of the East Coast Hockey League.
The Toledo coach, CHRIS McSORLEY told The Glens Falls (N.Y.) Post-Star that he planned to start Whitten, a goaltender, in an exhibition game next Saturday.
"She's a great athlete, she's quick," McSorley said.
"She'll definitely contend for a job,"


Times-Affiliated Merger
The New York Times Company announced yesterday that it had completed its merger with Affiliated Publications Inc., parent of The Boston Globe, by issuing 36.4 million shares of Times class A stock in exchange for Affiliated shares.
Shareholders of each company approved the $1 billion merger at separate meetings Tuesday in New York and Boston.


Inquiry on Commerce Secretary Finds Vietnam Bank Account Plan
Federal investigators examining a Vietnamese businessman's assertion that Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown sought $700,000 to help end a trade embargo against Vietnam have uncovered evidence that the Vietnamese were preparing to establish a special bank account in Singapore, Administration officials said today.
The evidence, in the form of transfers of an undisclosed sum of money in East Asian banks, appears to corroborate portions of the account of Ly Thanh Binh, the businessman who told the Federal authorities that a former associate approached Mr.
Brown last fall to enlist his help to improve trade relations between the United States and Vietnam.


Commercial Property:/Asset Managers; Mixing Hands-On Knowledge With Strategic Savvy
A COUPLE of years ago James Maurer saw the writing on the wall.
Working for a local developer at a time when development work was close to zilch, he decided to make a career switch.
He presented himself to Mutual Benefit Life as a workout specialist, someone who could help whip the properties that were coming to them through foreclosures into financial and physical shape, and create a strategic plan for eventually leasing or disposing of them.


Printmaker Captures Victorian Charm
JOSEPH PENNELL died in 1926 at the age of 69.
Yet, like his English contemporary Arthur Conan Doyle, the graphic artist belongs among the robust Victorians.
He was a prodigious traveler, drawing his way through Europe and all over his own country.
And, in addition to producing more than 1,500 prints and a score of illustrated books, he was active as a juror of exhibitions and a lecturer.
As a native Philadelphian, Pennell was commemorated there in the year of his death by a bumper exhibition but except for a recent restrospective at the Library of Congress, he has received remarkably little attention.
These are among the facts ingeniously worked into the three long columns of blank verse that accompany the Pennell show now hanging in the Benton Museum at the University of Connecticut in Storrs.
Norman Kraeft is the poet and, with his wife, June, the show's guest curator.
Print fanciers will recall the displays that, during the 1970's and 80's, the Kraefts dispatched from their gallery in Bethlehem -- first to Washington, D.C., and then on to motels in farther flung places -- and, of course, their bimonthly newsletters.
Though the two remain devoted to prints, specifically the early 20th-century American variety, they have given up dealing and are devoting their energy to the production and appreciation of poetry.
Mr.
Kraeft is president of the Connecticut Poetry Society.


Novels for the Computer
To the Editor:
When I come upon the word "hyperfiction," my mind rebels.
A decade or two ago, I was deluded into making some attempt to understand deconstruction.
After reading two books and some articles and comments on the subject, and after many conversations with others who might have understood but didn't, I have come to a couple of conclusions about that hopeful doctrine.


CRIME
Originality is a tough concept to nail down in genre fiction.
Sometimes it means the kind of writing that breaks conventions -- by making a villain of a hero, as Agatha Christie did so subtly, or, like Thomas Harris, by taking readers so deep into a killer's mind that we share the madness.
But originality can also mean working the same old conventions in the same old ways while allowing the characters unconventional responses, which is what James Preston Girard does in his mesmerizing novel, THE LATE MAN (Atheneum, $20).
Surely we've read this plot before: a reporter and a police detective are both obsessed with a series of unsolved murders.
Capt.
L.
J.
Loomis of the Wichita Police Department attributes the crackup of his marriage to his failure to find the person who strangled five women, leaving broken flowers by their corpses.
Sam Haun, a newspaperman who has been traumatized by the accidental death of his unfaithful wife, is haunted by the killings in a way he can't explain.
"I'm not personally involved with wanting to catch him," Haun tells Loomis after the strangler strikes again.
"I'm just trying to understand."


Conversations/Charles W. Adams; The Rise and Fall of Civilization According to Tax Collection
THE Constitution and the ballot may protect Americans against overreaching tax collectors, but some of the ancients enjoyed even better security.
An extortions court created by the Romans enabled Cicero and others to prosecute overzealous tax men.
The code of laws (313 A.D.) under Constantine provided civil remedies for judges derelict in defending taxpayers against abuses.
The penalty: 30 pounds of gold assessed against the judge and payable to the taxpayer.


It's Russian Penguins and Mighty Ducks
The National Hockey League begins its regular season Tuesday night with a new alignment and 26 teams, up by two teams from last season, up by five from three years ago and up by 20 since 1967.
So, what else is up?


Daly Among Entries in England
JOHN DALY will make his debut in the Toyota World Match Play Championship, to be held at Virginia Water, England, Oct. 21-24.

One Killed and 7 Injured in Bronx Shooting
A man was killed and seven people were wounded yesterday in a shooting at a busy intersection in the Hunts Points section of the Bronx when at least two gunmen drove by and opened fire as passers-by scurried for cover, the police said.
A bystander, Douglas Velasquez, 22, of 601 Prospect Avenue in the Bronx, was shot two times in the back and died near a newsstand on Southern Boulevard.


One Prodigy Itches to Become an Adult
Leila Josefowicz's Period of grace as a precocious novelty is almost at an end.
At 15, Ms.
Josefowicz is a step further down the road than Sarah Chang.
A student at the Curtis Institute of Music here, she wears two diamond studs in one ear and plays the 1708 "Ruby" Stradivarius, on long-term loan to her by the Stradivarius Society.
She has been a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the National Symphony and the Academy of St.
Martin-in-the-Fields; she did the Johnny Carson show and a Bob Hope special.
A teen-ager with the apple-cheeked freshness of a young Ann-Margret, Ms.
Josefowicz is itching to leave prodigyhood behind.
"You're playing serious music, and you want to be taken seriously," she said.

Deaths of Basque Suspects Stir Public Sympathy
The deaths of two Basque guerrilla suspects in police custody last weekend has stirred sympathy for Basque separatism just as public support for the E.T.A. separatist group appeared to be dwindling.
Until the deaths prompted charges of police brutality, E.T.A. -- the initials stand for "Basque Homeland and Freedom" in the region's language -- had been on the defensive after the capture of several leaders and its kidnapping of a Basque industrialist.

Could the Sun Ever Set On the BBC?
DENNIS POTTER, THE WRITER of some of the British Broadcasting Corporation's most critically acclaimed programs, is an acerbic sort.
But reminiscing recently about growing up with the BBC, the 58-year-old Mr.
Potter seemed at times positively misty-eyed.
"I'll admit that I'm quite ready to be a churl in sharpened hobnails," Mr.
Potter, the writer of "Pennies From Heaven" and "The Singing Detective," told an audience at a television industry conference.
"But it would be graceless of me not to acknowledge with an open heart the significant part the BBC played in my life and the lives of the people I came from. Millions of our fellow citizens feel the same way, for there have been all too few British institutions of any size of which one could say with hand on heart that they truly work, that they are the best that is."

Olympic Deals Still Available
Package tours are still being offered for the 16-day Olympic Winter Games, which open in Lillehammer, Norway, next Feb. 12.
Many packages do not include tickets to events, which can be bought in the United States only from Cartan Tours.
In late September, Cartan said it had fewer than 3,000 tickets left for the games, which will be held in Lillehammer, Hamar and Gjovik.
A Cartan spokesman said tickets ranged from $20 to $165.

Paddling the Connecticut River: Cleaner but Still Threatened
PEOPLE who grew up along the Connecticut River recall a time in the 1960's when rats and seagulls seemed the only wildlife that could survive on its shores.
Some referred to the river as one of the nation's best landscaped sewers.
But on a canoe trip in Whalebone Cove recently, Juliana Barrett, an ecologist with the Nature Conservancy, pointed out ospreys and herons that now ply the river's rich fishing grounds.
Snapping turtles abound amid huge stands of wild rice and sedge.
Wildflowers also abound: purple pieweed, white arrow leaf, reddish orchid-like groundnut and red cardinal plant.
The water was crystal clear and the fragrance that of a healthy marsh.


Ecuadorean Immigrants Finding Obstacles in Their Path
"I HOPE to go home someday," said the neatly dressed young man.
"The problems of this country are too great for me to stay. There is too much discrimination here."
Francel Aguirre, a slightly built 27-year-old Ecuadorean, spoke quietly about his life as a member of the village of Ossining's largest group of new immigrants.
He was surrounded by the friendly faces of fellow members of his English-as-a-second-language class, in the Ossining School District Office on Croton Avenue.
The village of Ossining has one of the largest concentrations of Ecuadoreans in the county; there are also growing populations in Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill.
The teachers of English as a second language had organized a lunchtime party to celebrate their students' progress and allow them to share native foods.
The 20 people included a man from Mexico City, a woman from Korea, a woman from Japan and a man from Bangladesh.
Mr.
Aguirre said: "The different races cannot live together here. They must always stay apart. Ecuadoreans are victims of so many things, and we can say nothing. We don't do anything bad. We just work hard, and they give us a hard time." Census Figures Analyzed
Outside the shelter of such institutions as the English-as-a-second-language classroom, Mr.
Aguirre and his fellow Ecuadoreans say they are often victims of crime and discrimination.
According to 1990 census figures, the white population in the village of Ossining grew at a rate of 2 percent between 1980 and 1990.
The population of nonwhites, as the census report puts it, grew by 44 percent, and the Hispanic population (which can be of any race) increased by 113 percent.
By 1990, there were 3,692 Hispanic people in the village, whose population at that time was 22,582.
Many village residents estimate that there are at least several thousand Ecuadoreans living and working in Ossining, legally or illegally, making them the largest group of recent immigrants in the village.
Of the village's 22,000 or so residents, 4,350 in 1990 were foreign born.
Ossining Union Free School District statistics show that, as of last March, Ecuadorean children represented the largest immigrant group, with 35 newly arrived students in a school population of 3,281.
The next largest groups were from Jamaica, Colombia, Peru, Portugal and Haiti.
Students who have lived in this country for longer than three years are not counted in the yearly school district new-immigrant census, so the actual number of immigrant students is much higher.
Officials at St.
Ann's School, one of two Roman Catholic schools in Ossining, also say that their largest group of new immigrants is from Ecuador, with 11 children out of a total of 285 in the last school year.
But many Ecuadorean men come to Ossining without their families, work at transitory jobs in landscaping and construction and are uncounted.
As large as the Ecuadorean population seems, it is hard to gauge without census designations more specific than "Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican and other Hispanic" and without children to be counted in the school census.
There were 2,312 "other Hispanic" residents in the village, according to the census.
Like many of them, Mr.
Aguirre left his parents, two brothers and a sister at home in Ecuador and has lived with his uncle and brother in an apartment near the Sing Sing Correctional Facility for five years.
A baker who works nights, he said he had been denied a green card (the common name for the alien registration card), but he said he would try again.
The card is obtained when either a close family member is a legal resident or an employer files a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service asking that the person be granted lawful permanent resident status.
Some applications are processed quickly.
Some are more complicated.
Many illegal immigrants fall prey to fraudulent schemes promising a green card.
Mr.
Aquirre said he was attacked while walking along Spring Street in the village.
His attackers yelled, "Speak English!" before roughing him up, he said.
He added that banks will not open accounts without Social Security numbers and that Ecuadoreans are frequently beaten and robbed for their savings, which they carry with them.
Anibal Gonzalez Jr., who is of Puerto Rican descent, is one of two Hispanic police officers in the village of Ossining who have tried to explain American life to the newest Spanish-speaking immigrants.
He said, "If they're going to get into trouble, it's because they're drinking and then driving, or sometimes they wander into certain areas and guys will hassle them."
Mr.
Gonzalez added: "We see them with their pockets torn and their faces bloody, or the victims of a car crash, and they refuse medical care. They think the hospitals won't treat their emergency needs.
"Or they refuse to report a crime to us. They're afraid of being found out if they're here illegally and being deported. We try to straighten them out and tell them that they have to trust the system a little more."
Reacting to the Ecuadoreans' fear of authority, Dr.
Emil Nigro, director of emergency medicine at the Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in neighboring North Tarrytown, said, "We never, never turn anyone away." He said that not only does his emergency room evaluate everyone who comes to them and treat them if needed but that it also does not require identification or insurance.
Only a few simple questions are asked at admission and, Dr.
Nigro added, "All records are confidential." He added that in most cases hospitals must absorb the cost of emergency room visits by illegal aliens.
Diego Santiago, a Colombian-born police officer who lives in Ossining, has visited St.
Ann's Roman Catholic Church on Eastern Avenue to tell Hispanic men how to protect themselves.
St.
Ann's is known as the immigrants' church in the community.
"Walk in groups, never alone," Officer Santiago said.
"Don't drink to drunkenness. Don't carry large amounts of cash. Don't be afraid of the police." The Rev.
Frank Oliverio has told these groups that they may feel free to keep their strongboxes with their savings in his rectory, just across the street from St.
Ann's.
About 350 Hispanic families attend the Spanish Masses at St.
Ann's, but the church also offers special Masses in Italian, Portuguese and Korean.
St.
Ann's also serves many second- and third-generation Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans.
Father Oliverio said he hopes to form a support group for Ecuadoreans and other Hispanic men in this country without their families.
Not all Hispanic men are disillusioned.
Luis Pani, a 31-year-old laborer, said he has never been assaulted.
"Maybe that's why I'm so happy here," he said.
Although he has been unsuccessful in obtaining a green card, Mr.
Pani, a bachelor, has formed a network of friends and made a life for himself in Ossining.
He has become active in St.
Ann's Church and has become a familiar and popular figure in his English-as-a-second-language classes.
"America is a country of green fields, blue-eyed blond girls, wonderful summers and houses with green gardens and lawnmowers," he said.
"That is my dream, to have a house in the suburbs, a wife, a couple of kids and a lawnmower that can blow the leaves in the fall."
Marcia Siguenza, an Ecuadorean who recently moved to North Tarrytown after nine years in Ossining, worries about the social havoc caused by the mostly male migration from Ecuador.
"It is sad, very sad," she said.
"The men are coming to this country without their wives. Sometimes they remarry here, but it is not really a marriage. They do this because it helps them get a green card.
"It is breaking up the families in Ecuador. In some places in southern Ecuador, there are no men, only women. And there are bad men who are selling visas for too much, $4,000, which takes many years to pay off with interest."
Ms.
Siguenza, who has an Alien Registration Card, the so-called green card, is the supervisor of housekeeping at Kings College in Briarcliff.
Her four grown children have done well in life, she said.
But she said she failed to understand why so many young Ecuadorean men chose this country over their own.
"They have a nice, simple life in Ecuador," she said.
"Maybe not with TV or cars. But there's too much here. It's a big transformation for them, and they're not really ready for it. They come mostly from the farms, from the countryside."
Jose and Zoila Illescas have four children they left in Ecuador in the care of grandparents.
The Illescases are both working, he in construction and she as a housecleaner.
They have green cards and eagerly await the day they can afford to bring their children to the United States.
An Unofficial Protector
Carlos Castro, a constable and court officer, is a second-generation Colombian-American who has lived in Ossining for 25 years.
He is an unofficial protector and adviser to the newest Hispanic immigrants who end up in the village courtroom.
He said he is appalled by their living conditions.
"Many homes have them stacked up inside," Mr.
Castro said.
"But you wouldn't know it from the street."
Frank Vardy, an immigration authority from the New York City Department of City Planning, suggested that the Ecuadoreans are similar to the immigrant groups who preceded them.
Those Ecuadoreans who choose to return to their native country are "much like the Italian 'birds of passage' from the late 1800's and early 1900's," he said.
"Those men came and lived cheaply and sent money home to the wife and children," Mr.
Vardy said.
"Then, after 5 or 10 years, they went home with a bankroll and bought a farm or opened up a business."
Despite his steady job as a baker, Mr.
Aguirre said he has been disillusioned and feels estranged.
He added that he must continue working hard, living simply and watching his back if he is ever to be able to return home with anything to show for his time here.

Novels for the Computer
To the Editor:
Readers intrigued by Robert Coover's remarks on hypertext should consider looking into Theodor Nelson's "Computer Lib/Dream Machines," which first appeared in 1974; a recent edition was published in 1987.
Not only does the physical design of the book lend itself to browsing, it also contains quite a number of "links" in the old-fashioned form of bibliographies.

2 Largest Hospital Chains in U.S. Merge
In the latest consolidation reflecting powerful pressures for change in health care, the nation's largest hospital chains, Columbia Healthcare Inc. and HCA-Hospital Corporation of America, said yesterday that they had agreed to merge.
The new company, which would operate 190 hospitals, would be the largest investor-owned hospital chain in the world.
Richard L. Scott, the chairman and chief executive of Columbia, who will be the president and chief executive of the new company, said the value of the deal was $10.25 billion, making it the seventh-largest merger in any industry since 1981.
He said it would be accomplished in a tax-free exchange of shares.
No cash will be involved.


Private Money for Science Buys Hypotheses and Hype
GALILEO had the Medicis.
Darwin had the Wedgwoods and their porcelain wealth via his maternal grandparents and wife.
And modern ecology, for better or worse, has Edward P. Bass, the Texas billionaire who bankrolled the $150 million planet-in-a-bottle from which eight very thin people emerged last Sunday.
Private patronage, as old as science itself, is becoming a new force in the world of research as the Federal Government tightens its belt and as tycoons, foundations and businesses sink billions into pushing back the frontiers of knowledge.
But as the Biosphere 2 hoopla in the Arizona desert makes clear, a lot of ideological baggage can come with the money.


NOTES
Elton John's upcoming "Duets" album will have a debut of sorts at Gianni Versace's fashion show in Milan today.
As the designer's spring offerings go down the runway, the fashion press will be the first audience to hear Mr.
John's collaborations with singers like K. D. Lang, Stevie Wonder and Bonnie Raitt.
"Duets" is due out in November from MCA Records.
Art meets fashion all the time, but the Interart Center, a nonprofit gallery at 167 Spring Street, is trying to make more than just an introduction.
Its current show, "The Rag Trade (Right Off the Rack)," features sculptures and installations by artists who use clothing in their work.
Organized by Saul Ostrow, an independent curator, it runs through Oct. 30.


No Excess Baggage in This Collection
"French master drawings" at the Pierpont Morgan Library is an exhibition that treads lightly and firmly across five centuries.
Its 125 drawings carry no excess baggage, never bog down and owe nothing to showmanship.
Nor has any one of them been sold at auction for a record price.
This is in line with the history of the drawings collection in the Morgan Library.
It got off to a flying start.
Already in the first years of this century J. Pierpont Morgan was buying rarities like the sketchbook of boxwood leaves now dated circa 1400 and attributed to the circle of Jacquemart de Hesdin, court painter to Jean, Duc de Berri.
This is item No. 1 in the present show (on view through Jan. 2), and it is a touching experience to see what the unidentified artist made of those six little pieces of boxwood close on 600 years ago.


Meatloaf, for the Back-to-Basics Crowd
MEATLOAF has been attracting considerable attention in recent years.
It is the darling of the back-to-basics food movement, whetting the appetites of those with retro tastes.
It is also cheap and, when combined with mashed potatoes, it may be the ultimate comfort food.
And there are thousands of ways to make it.
I'll never forget the first meatloaf I ever made.
I was newly married and vaguely remembered how my mother put a meatloaf together.
I recalled onions, green pepper, egg and seasonings like ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS A Graf-Novotna Rematch in Final Top-seeded Steffi Graf and Jana Novotna won semifinal matches yesterday at the Volkswagen Card Cup in Leipzig, Germany, setting up a rematch of their dramatic Wimbledon final.
Graf won her 39th straight match but struggled in slipping past Judith Wiesner of Austria, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-3.
Novotna celebrated her 25th birthday by trouncing Conchita Martinez of Spain, ranked fifth in the world, 6-1, 6-1.
In today's final, the two will meet for the first time since the Wimbledon final in which Novotna led by 4-1 in the third set before her game collapsed and she ending up losing.
"I hope it turns out better than Wimbledon," Novotna said. (AP)


Novels for the Computer
To the Editor:
Your essay on hyperfiction recalled my own introduction to "Finnegans Wake" many years ago.
Intimidated by the Joycean epic, I left it in the bathroom unread for several months until one day I found myself idly thumbing through it and laughing out loud.
Thereafter I would pick it up whenever I went to the bathroom, starting from midway through the text or somewhere near the end or the beginning, and reading backward and forward and without any particular order at all.
Outside the "proper" order, the book was a terrific read, revealing its extraordinary scope and design in nooks and crannies of stupefying language, brilliant humor and dreamlike myth.
Hypertext awaits its own creative genius to raise it above the electronic soap opera level.

Debunking the Myths About Public Schools
To the Editor:
As a public-school teacher and a parent of two children attending public school -- all of us in District 2 in Manhattan -- I wholeheartedly support the main idea of Eric Rothenberg's article on his daughter's switch from private to public school: "I can't help but wonder what might be accomplished citywide if those of us who have been running away from the public schools stopped running" ("When a Product of the Private Schools Goes Public," Sept. 19).


Native Plants Survive Amid Adversity
FALL is here.
There is no better time to reflect on the summer gone by and judge how well the garden grew.
Besides, it is more pleasant to be outdoors, to take a closer look now that cooler weather is here.
According to this year's weather summaries, 1993 was among the hottest summer on record.
And for many who live in the Northeast, it was also one of the driest summers with little rainfall to spur growth.
As for the hot weather, there was a record-tying number of days in the 90 degree range or higher than ever before.
In fact, this summer tied a record of 39 hot days that was set just two years ago.
The month of July was singled out as having 20 days when the temperature was 90 degrees or higher.

Lifts for Buses
To the Editor: In the Practical Traveler column "Slow Going for Disabled on Private Buses," Betsy Wade (Aug. 29) properly points out that there are virtually no wheelchair-lift-equipped intercity buses, while all the new transit buses now have wheelchair lifts.
The reason for this is simple: the Federal Government pays 90 percent of the cost of federally mandated equipment for disabled travelers on transit buses while it pays none of the cost for over-the-road buses.
In the last few months, I have testified in Congress and written to Transportation Secretary Frederico F. Pena urging Federal funding of an expedited research and development program to develop a cost-effective lift.


THE TRIALS OF BOB PACKWOOD
Bob Packwood, like many men who are awkward and shy, may have assumed that women respond to visual and tactile stimuli with instant arousal.
The rejections he received may have been less painful than rejections to "real courting" may have been.
After all, men are used to having their faces slapped for being fresh.

Gains Cited at U.N. on Cutting Infant Deaths
Representatives from more than 60 developing countries reported significant progress this week toward meeting health goals that are expected to prevent some two million infant deaths a year by 1995.
Achieving those mid-decade targets, which include immunizing at least 80 percent of the children in those countries against six major illnesses, would improve the odds of achieving goals set three years ago at the World Summit for Children.
A total of 149 countries were represented at the summit meeting here in September 1990, 71 of them by their heads of state or government.


'Belmont Avenue Social Club' Opens
THE Belmont Avenue Social Club is the sort of political back room where you can count on Fran Barelli, the big boss, to fix your parking ticket or squeeze your mother into an overcrowded old-age home.
If you're loyal.
Forget about the bad guys versus the good guys.
Here, everyone is bad (or "too old or indicted").
And one, Doug, is worse than everyone else.
Only Tommy may be the best of the bad, because he makes a show of reluctance as a captive candidate for small-time councilman to replace Pete, who died.


Their 15 Minutes
RUDOLPH GREY has the wary, unshaven face of a New Yorker who finds sunlight irritating.
Even in the dimness of his apartment, a second-floor walk-up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in New York, he squints.
His hipster threads -- olive jacket with thin collar turned up, white shirt with big cufflinks, black jeans -- are nicely wrinkled.
He chain-smokes thin brown Sherman MCD cigarettes, the ashes from which have, over time, formed a kind of fossil layer on his thousands of LP's and 45's.
Most of his adult life ("just say I'm in my late 30's," he insists) Mr.
Grey has existed on the tattered fringe of New York's art and music scene.
Since 1972, he has been known professionally and to his friends as Rudolph Grey, a persona chosen because "Rudolph is colorful and Grey is sort of neutral," he says.
He won't give his real name.


Novels for the Computer
To the Editor:
Robert Coover's essay signals the coming of age of computer-mediated media as staples of contemporary life.
But the question remains, as with all genies liberated from their bottles: will this new approach to information delivery assume the role of master or servant?


Ann Cummings, William Kissinger
Mrs.
Ellis Cummings of Providence, R.I., and Robert Cummings of Little Compton, R.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter Ann Devlin Cummings to William David Kissinger, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

A December wedding is planned.
Ms.
Cummings, a graduate of Brown University, is a lawyer for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in San Francisco.
She received a law degree from the University of California at Berkeley, as did her husband.
Her father is a partner in the Providence investment firm of Brown, Lisle, Cummings.


A Free-Spirited Survivor Lands on Her Feet
For Annie Ross, living on the edge has become a fine art.
In 1958, this cool-yet-sultry redhead earned a place in jazz vocal history when she became the female third of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross, the trio famous for setting bullet-fire lyrics to jazz instrumentals.
Ms.
Ross's octave-leaping, sweet-and-sour voice intrigued Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and other musicians who had little time for female singers.
So did her capacity for partying -- until drugs nearly ended the fun permanently.
But her instinct for self-destruction was exceeded by a knack for survival.
After beating heroin addiction, bankruptcy and chronic unemployment, the 63-year-old singer and actress has landed on her feet again.
In Robert Altman's new film "Short Cuts," she plays a ravaged jazz singer named Tess Trainer who tries to block out reality with booze, pot, cynical love songs and bittersweet memories of a rocky past.


Relief for Victims of Indian Quake Comes Slowly
As the precise dimensions of India's worst earthquake in more than five decades remained uncertain today -- official death tolls ranged from 9,000 to 21,000, with tens of thousands of others homeless -- the shortcomings in the official relief effort became more glaring.
In many villages devastated by Thursday's tremors, it was the survivors themselves who dug for the dead, who stacked the funeral pyres, who began the slow task of rebuilding their lives.
Rain hampered the cremation of bodies that were being rushed to funeral pyres for health reasons.

In September during the United States Open, the United States Tennis Association and the Tennis Industry Association announced the formation of an alliance to cooperate on a program aimed at increasing the number of new tennis players in the United States


Sports of The Times; For Pro Football, Hard Hits of a Different Sort
Taking a hit in the National Football League is now financial as well as physical.
Just as the players have been liberated by football's new free-agent era, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has been liberated in disciplining them.
Instead of merely slapping their wrists, he's now able to at least smudge their portfolios with substantial fines.


Curbing Guns To Deter Violence
After I read the article, "When Women Decide Not to Be Easy Targets" (Aug. 22), I had two responses.
On the one hand, I was outraged that women are being visualized by carjackers, robbers, burglars, etc. as "easy victims." On the other hand, I was shocked that an increasing number of women, as well as men, are apparently choosing to arm themselves in case they are victimized by a carjacker, robber or intruder.
The writer specifically mentioned Horretta Wilkins of Stamford who was sideswiped by some individuals in another car.
She thought they were attempting to force her off the highway, presumably as a prelude to robbing her.
Her call to the police on her car telephone got no response from the police because she did not know specifically in which town she was.
Her disappointment with the lack of police interest in the case, and her fear she might have been killed, prompted her to buy not one gun, but two.
She now has a permit to carry a gun, and does so almost everywhere she goes.


THE LOOK OF THE NINETIES
What retired beauty parlor operator could splurge on a $4,500 wool and cashmere coat by Romeo Gigli?
Although huge disparities between designer prices and actual consumer buying power are commonplace in the fantasy world of fashion, the disparity assumes a kind of tragic obscenity in your photo essay, given the economic reality of most older consumers: a struggle to survive on a small, fixed income.


More Speed, Fewer Whacks, Extra Aches
Martha Graham helped to create American modern dance and to define American culture.
Her dancers were gods and goddesses.
So there was surprise -- and consternation -- when the Martha Graham Dance Company announced that Twyla Tharp had been chosen to create a dance that was seen as a centerpiece in the troupe's yearlong celebration of the centennial of Graham's birth.
Twyla Tharp?
That wise-cracking whippersnapper who wouldn't know a god from a guppy?
That choreographer who set her dancers slithering across the floor to popular music, throwing a hat or two into the air for good measure, and declared herself early on to be the next Martha Graham?
That woman who had the nerve to demand megabucks for her work and the unseriousness to choreograph for film and the Broadway musical?


Technology; New Crusader in Software's Holy War
IT was less than four months ago that Novell Inc. acquired Unix System Laboratories from A.T.&amp; T. in a stock swap valued at about $320 million.
Within the next few weeks, Novell intends to give the Unix trademark away.
Bizarre?
Not in the context of Unix, the software system with a troubled past.
Created in 1969 by Kenneth Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at A.T.&amp; T.'s Bell Labs, Unix is an operating system -- basic software that controls the movement of data within a computer from processor to memory or to disk, and within a network from one computer to another.


THE LOOK OF THE NINETIES
The photos of nonagenarians in their Sunday finery just about took my breath away.
What a relief from postpubescent waifs who look like children and prepubescent children made up like women.
You simply allowed these wonderful people to be themselves.

The Executive Life; A Penchant for Prose In the Corner Office
ASK Harriet Rubin, a vice president at Doubleday, about the job of editing books by top executives, especially those from the high-speed world of high-tech, and she takes off.
"It's like going through a cloud bank at 7,000 miles an hour," she said.
"It's bumpy and you may pass out along the way, but you're so happy when you pass through to the other side."


In America; Dangerous Turf
President Clinton came to town last week, made a pass at the race issue in an effort to help get Mayor Dinkins re-elected, and then moved on.
Speaking last Sunday night to a crowd of Dinkins supporters at the Sheraton New York Hotel, the President lamented that "too many of us are still too unwilling to vote for people who are different than we are."


Vivid Expressions From a People Scarcely Known
The richly figured murals, sculpture and ceramics of Teotihuacan, which were widely imitated by the Aztecs but virtually unknown to all but pre-Columbian historians, are now recognized as some of the most innovative of the ancient Americas.
Teotihuacan (pronounced tay-oh-tee-wah-kahn) was Mexico's first urban state.
It lay 25 miles northeast of what is now Mexico City and flourished from the first century A.D. to 750, when it collapsed for unexplained reasons.
But now examples of emblematic art from this mysterious society, which left no written language, can be seen in "Teotihuacan: City of the Gods," at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, through Oct. 31.


Seeking A Chance For a Home
Lydia Watt stuffs pillows, blankets and sheets under the door to keep rats out of her bedroom at night in her small apartment in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
Some mornings, she wakes up to find her small kitchen ransacked by the rodents, with cereal, sugar and flour spilled everywhere.
"I just got fed up," she said, speaking through the window of a second-floor, two-bedroom apartment that she invaded with friends on Friday in a nearly completed public housing project at South 10th and Berry Streets in Williamsburg.
"What we've done here should put everyone on notice that we're not going to tolerate these living conditions. It's not by choice that some of us live like this. The system forces it on us."


Trade Agreement Means Fat Cats Get Fatter; The March of the Jobs
To the Editor:
One problem with the analysis of the North American Free Trade Agreement by the academic community is summed up in a revealing phrase by Prof.
Paul Krugman, "on the average" (front page, Sept. 17).
Like the river whose average depth is one foot, there are some very deep areas that cannot be easily crossed.

Rain Puts 2 Strikes On London Exhibition
On Friday, there was supposed to be an outdoor baseball clinic for British schoolchildren, but it rained.
Then, today, minor league players from the Mets and Boston Red Sox organizations were scheduled to play a nine-inning exhibition game at the Oval, one of London's oldest cricket venues.
But it rained again.


Kim Kassel, Markus Diethelm
Kim Jordana Kassel, a daughter of Alvin and Doris Kassel of Roslyn, L.I., was married yesterday to Markus Ulrich Diethelm, the son of Adrian and Jolanda Diethelm of Zurich.
The Rev.
Lewis Poag performed the Presbyterian ceremony at the Church of St.
Pierre in Ermenonville, France.
Mrs.
Diethelm is a lawyer at the Societe Internationale de Telecommunications Aeronautiques, a Paris concern.
Her father is a special counsel to the New York law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.


COMMERCE LEADER FACES MAJOR TEST
Ronald H. Brown, who easily weathered questions about ties to wealthy and powerful interests when he was confirmed as Commerce Secretary, is facing the most withering scrutiny of his career.
Mr.
Brown is confronting accusations by a Vietnamese businessman that he sought $700,000 in return for his help lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam, at a time when he was moving from his quasi-official role as a political party official to the Government.


Public &amp; Private; Bad and Blue
Walk the streets of Brownsville, Brooklyn, where even in a steady downpour people line up outside a bricked-up building that might as well have a neon sign that says "CRACK HOUSE," and you know what bad scene means.
Blocks and blocks of burned-out houses, drugs and crime, funerals for little kids.
Inside the Soap Suds Laundromat, which shares a strip of Pitkin Avenue with the Revelation Temple of Jesus Christ and the Bargain Hunters Home Center, tired women watch the wash go round and round, making the laundry a hundred times cleaner than the streets.
This they all agree upon: the sound of gunshots at night, the need to stay safe indoors, the impossible desire to get out for good.


Amy J. Rosenberg, John L. Slafsky
April wedding plans have been announced by Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Rosenberg of Denver for their daughter, Amy Jill Rosenberg, and John Lawrence Slafsky, a son of Dr. and Mrs.

She graduated from Tufts University.
Her father is a wage investigator in the auditor's office at Denver International Airport.
Her mother, Marilyn S. Rosenberg, is the director of the home-detention program of the Denver Department of Safety.


SEPT. 26-OCT. 2: Vice Cycle; Another Generation Of Police Corruption
Testifying last week before an investigative commission, a parade of wayward New York City police officers -- and some honest colleagues -- gave graphic portraits of clusters of New York City officers committing narcotics-related crimes since 1986 with little fear of exposure by Police Department internal watchdogs.
A renegade officer, Bernard Cawley, said colleagues nicknamed him "the Mechanic" for his zeal in brutally assaulting dealers, addicts and innocent people in the Bronx.
A former officer, Michael Dowd, said he had split $8,000 a week with a police partner to protect Brooklyn drug dealers from arrest and harass rival dealers.
After testifying that higher-ups had hampered his efforts to stop a ring led by Mr.
Dowd, Sgt.
Joseph F. Trimboli retired.
He suggested that his anti-corruption efforts had ruined his career.

Bosnia's Desperate Gamble: Winter in Time of War
When the Muslim-led Parliament of Bosnia walked away from a peace plan this week, some members said they had given up their last chance of salvaging a territory of their own from the wreckage of their country.
As the Parliament dispersed, one legislator after another spoke of the agonies of conscience involved in rejecting a chance for peace.
Several said that the Parliament's decision could mean life or death for tens of thousands of people, mainly Muslims.


Trade Agreement Means Fat Cats Get Fatter
To the Editor:
"Caterpillar Sees Free-Trade Boon" (Business Day, Sept. 21) shows a disturbing class conflict arising in the United States over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It is between the organized money class and the disorganized masses.
Working class, middle class, manufacturing and clerical workers, even white-collar professionals like schoolteachers, lower management people and engineers, all have a nagging fear that the treaty will further redistribute income and jobs from them to the executives of large corporations, Wall Street bankers and brokers, corporate lawyers and politicians.


Caroline Pasman and Richard Craig
Caroline Ellen Pasman, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
James S. Pasman Jr. of Pittsburgh, was married yesterday to Richard Paul Craig, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

A June 1994 wedding is planned.
Dr.

She received bachelor's and medical degrees from Brown University.


FISHING WITH PRESIDENTS
Howell Raines's article "Fishing With Presidents" (Sept. 5) was an amusing example of the use of sports as political metaphor.
I feel compelled, however, to correct him on one point.
Under Carter, both interest rates and inflation soared, as both Ronald Reagan and George Bush have never tired of reminding us.
By contrast, during the Depression, prices actually went down (for some items, drastically) and interest rates dropped as well.
My grandparents, for instance, took out a mortgage at under 2 percent interest in 1938 to finance building a summer home; after World War II, the bank constantly pestered them to pay it off and take out a new (higher-interest) one.


China in the Year 2000 -- Repressive? Expressive? Anarchic?
The emperor appears to be dying.
Deng Xiaoping is a fighter, and it is possible he will hang on for months or even years.
But each time China's 89-year-old paramount leader hobbles a few steps in one of his rare television appearances, his trembling hands and blank stares invite a fundamental question: what next?
When an emperor last died in China, in 1976, the country changed course.
Mao Zedong's death led to basic changes in the way people lived: black miniskirts replaced Mao jackets; angry rock music succeeded tunes like "The Party Is My Mommy"; living standards surged so that many peasants could enjoy a measure of prosperity for the first time in thousands of years.


How Good Are Jets? Eagles and Cunningham Will Tell
For most National Football League teams there is a game, usually early in the season, that indicates the direction the team is heading.
The Jets (2-1) have reached that time in the season, and their game against the Eagles today will give them a good idea of just where they stand.
Are the Jets, currently in a four-way tie for first place in the American Conference East division, a playoff contender?
After the 4 P.M. game at Giants Stadium, the Jets will know.

The Cost of Medicine
To the Editor:
We all notice that American pharmaceutical companies are beginning to voice their fears that President Clinton's health plans may curb their profits, so necessary, they say, for their medical research.
It is perhaps illuminating then to compare prices for a common medication in France and the United States.
In Paris, the current price in a pharmacy for 50 Endoxan pills is $7.50.
In the United States, the pharmacy price for the same product, known here as Cytoxan, is $135, just 18 times the cost of the French product.

THE BULLY OF THE SKIES CRIES UNCLE
Robert Crandall isn't having fun anymore so he threatens to pull American out of the airlines business ("The Bully of the Skies Cries Uncle," by Stephen D. Solomon, Sept. 5.) As an American Airlines flight attendant whose wages have declined nearly 40 percent in the last decade, and who has also "worked like hell," it's been no picnic.
Now I find out that the "growth plan" has failed and Crandall has tried everything.
It doesn't take a Wharton graduate to figure out that eventually the market would be saturated with airline seats (after all, United and Delta were expanding, too) and adjustments would have to be made.
Crandall needs to stop griping and do his job or step aside.

Neighborhood Report: Park Slope; Pressure Growing Against Former Sponsor of a Racial Talk Show
Bitter protests have erupted along the shaded streets of Park Slope in recent weeks.
Their focus is Ian Lipner, a neighborhood resident who until last spring sponsored a talk show whose host urged the deportation of blacks to Africa and described the Holocaust as fiction.
At synagogues, over coffee in neighborhood diners, on morning jogs and in the parlors of brownstones, people are talking about Mr.
Lipner.
And many of them want him to leave.


CALL FOR REMOVAL OF CHIEF ADMIRAL SHAKES PENTAGON
A call to remove the Navy's top officer for failing to prevent a sexual harassment scandal two years ago has stirred turmoil among senior Pentagon and White House officials, who today sought a way of punishing offenders without disgracing a distinguished Naval officer.
The fate of the officer, Adm.
Frank B. Kelso 2d, remained undecided today, even after he met with Defense Secretary Les Aspin for about 20 minutes.
Navy Secretary John H. Dalton has asked that Admiral Kelso be dismissed and that 12 other admirals and Marine generals be disciplined, but Pentagon officials said Mr.
Aspin would make no final decision before Monday.


Failing Grades on the First Waco Attack
The Clinton Administration concluded last week that Federal law enforcement officials lied about, and tried to cover up, the mistakes in their initial failed effort to capture David Koresh, the apocalyptic leader of the heavily armed Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Tex.
That raid, on Feb. 28, ended in a gun battle in which four agents and six cult members died.
A 51-day standoff followed; it ended when fire consumed the cult's compound during a Federal assault and dozens died.
For months, senior officials of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, led by Stephen E. Higgins, said the Feb. 28 raid was well planned and executed.


On Sunday; No Creature More Durable Than Blattidae
AMID the various life rhythms of the city -- currently, the 20-year police corruption cycle is back upon us -- none is so impervious to probing and reform as the vast cockroach population cycle on which L. Randy Dupree is about to lecture once more for the new class of aspiring integrated pest managers at Bronx Community College.
"That's the term they use now instead of exterminators," says Mr.
Dupree, the city's expert on the cockroach, who offers no demurral at the political fanciness of the title, for it acknowledges the city can, at best, only manage its roaches, never defeat them.


The House of Windsor? Don't They Make Sheets?
WATERLOO aside, Napoleon may have been right -- the British are a nation of shopkeepers.
But it was always thought their gracious Queen was above all that.
No longer.
Now, doing its bit for British exports, the royal family is lending its name to a retail enterprise -- a catalogue filled with choice knick-knacks.


Modern Cowboys Riding for a Cause
THE Black Cowboys Association of Brooklyn will deck itself out in full Western regalia today and trot along Linden Boulevard, riding for pledges to raise money for the Pediatric AIDS program at Brookdale Hospital.
The Brooklyn organization, a branch of the American Black Cowboys Association, began as a small group of horse owners who wanted to do research and educate others on the history of black cowboys in America.


Army's Quarterback Takes to the Air to Defeat Akron
Army 35, Akron 14
AKron's defensive game plan was simple: stop the Army running attack.
After all, the Cadets were averaging 319 yards a game on the ground, second best in the country, and a mere 58 yards through the air.
In fact, the Zips were so concerned about the Cadets' wishbone attack that they used linemen as stand-ins for Akili King, Army's bruising fullback, in practice this past week.


Alexandra Birle and Scott Clifford
Alexandra Lea Birle, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The Coffee-Table Book Enters the TV Age
HAVE you played a good picture book on your television lately?
Rick Smolan, a photographer in Mill Valley, Calif., has created a multimedia book, "From Alice to Ocean: Alone Across the Outback" (Claris Corporation Publishers), which tells the story of Robyn Davidson's solo camel ride across Australia, a trek she first wrote about in National Geographic in 1978.
Along with the traditional hard-bound volume, "Alice" comes with two disks, one playable with a photo CD player on any TV screen.
The second disk can be played on a Macintosh CD Rom player and a computer.


Some Exhaust Fans Are Tricky to Install
INSTALLING an exhaust fan in a poorly ventilated bathroom, laundry or kitchen can help prevent indoor condensation and problems like mildew, peeling paint and damaged woodwork.
Mounting a fan on an outside wall may be reasonably easy, but mounting one in a ceiling can be difficult unless the ceiling is accessible from an attic.
That is because ceiling fans require separate and sometimes lengthy ducts to carry exhaust air outside.
In all cases, electrical wiring has also to be installed.


Neighborhood Report: Bayside; Police Scope Out Night Writers
The battle against graffiti writers in Bayside has taken a high-tech turn: police officers with a night-vision telescope.
Last week, the 111th Precinct added the telescope to its arsenal of weapons as part of a pilot program to snare the vandals, who often work under cover of darkness.

Annie's Gun Goes P.C.

At least Ethel Merman couldn't in the original version of "Annie Get Your Gun." Back in the 40's, for Annie-Ethel to get her man, a male chauvinist named Frank Butler, she had to lose a shooting contest intentionally.


In Islamic Music, a Search for Ecstasy
Robert Browning, artistic director of the World Music Institute, remembers the first concerts of Islamic music that the institute presented, years ago, at Merkin Concert Hall in Abraham Goodman House.
"Some of the members," he said recently, "suggested that this was not the right thing to have in a Jewish hall. But obviously, the tides are changing fast."
Long before Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization formally recognized each other, Mr.
Browning had already planned "The Musical World of Islam," the most comprehensive festival of Islamic music ever held in New York.
The series of a dozen concerts was to begin last night, with the Pakistani Sufi singer Abida Parveen, and will conclude on March 11 with Alem Kassimov, a fiery singer from Azerbaijan.

Looking to Courts for Catharsis
THE land of the endless summer seems to have become the home of the endless Rodney King trial as one legal proceeding unfolds from another like waves rising in the surf.
Beating begets trial begets acquittal begets riot begets trial.
Suit spawns countersuit.
Victim becomes plaintiff, plaintiff becomes defendant.
Appeal counters appeal.
All flow from an 81-second videotaped beating of a black motorist by white police officers more than two years ago.
And yet there is no closure, only periodic strokes of theater that inflame a city that continues to seek, and fails to find, a catharsis in the legal system.
In the absence of successful social programs or economic renewal or inspired political leadership, the city has sought to come to terms with its ailments through courtroom drama.


The Haydn Opera Revival Died Too Soon, but It Lives on Disk
ONE OF THE MAJOR musicological events of the 1970's was the rediscovery of Haydn's operas.
The critic H. C. Robbins Landon reconstructed some scores that had been thought to be lost; several were successfully staged at the Holland Festival, including a memorable "Fedelta Premiata" directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, and Antal Dorati recorded eight of the operas for Philips to great acclaim (now reissued, 432 413/38; 20 CD's).
And that, it seems, was the end of the great Haydn opera revival.
It is astonishing that none of these operas has found its way into the fringes of the repertory, for they contain some of the loveliest vocal writing of the 18th century, and the orchestrations are continually fresh and inventive.
Haydn, who is now best known as a composer of vocal music for his Masses and the great, late oratorios, had a high regard for the operas he composed as Kapellmeister at Eszterhaza castle.
In a 1781 letter to his publisher, Haydn said of "La Fedelta Premiata": "I assure you that no such work has been heard in Paris up to now, nor perhaps in Vienna either. It is my misfortune that I live in the country."

In Hanoi, U.S. Goods Sold but Not by U.S.
Wandering the narrow streets of what was the enemy capital in the Vietnam War, American visitors to Hanoi can find themselves wondering, what American trade embargo?
Vietnam Airlines flies many of them here on its shiny new Boeing jets.
The city's electronics stores carry I.B.M. and Apple computers, and even the computers that bear Taiwanese or Korean brand names are powered by a computer chip manufactured by the Intel Corporation.
Those familiar yellow boxes of Kodak film are on sale in plenty of photo shops and for Hanoi teen-agers, Coca-Cola is the soft drink of choice.


Target Shopping: A Guide
SAVVY shoppers already know where the diamond district is.

If pressed, could they name exact streets where discounted auto parts can be found?
Could they conduct a tour of the antiques row at the southern tip of the Bronx?


U.S. REACHES PACT ON PLANT CLEANUP
With no hope of meeting deadlines for cleaning up highly radioactive wastes at the Hanford nuclear weapons plant, the Energy Department has struck a new agreement with environmental regulators that will give it another 10 years to get started.
As part of the accord, the department is promising to embed lower-level waste in longer-lasting materials.
The old goal, to start by 1999, was a hard-fought victory for environmental authorities in Washington State, where the plant is.
But earlier this year, the Energy Department said that it could not meet the deadline and that it wanted to do away with deadlines.


These Characters Specialize in Being Glazed and Bemused
IN 1946, THE MOVIE production Code Administration stated that no scenes should "show the use of illegal drugs, or their effects, in detail." Needless to say, the Production Code died a long time ago.
In two new movies, pot smokers are played purely for laughs.
Rory Cochrane is the dope-befogged high school student at the heart of "Dazed and Confused," and in "True Romance" Brad Pitt gives armed mobsters some fairly stoned instructions on how to catch a couple on the run.
Mr.
Pitt's character habitually smokes marijuana in a bong, a kind of pipe, shaped like a honey bear.

THE ANGUISHED POLITICS OF BREAST CANCER
Thank you for Susan Ferraro's important story on breast cancer and on the women who have pushed this epidemic to the front of the nation's political consciousness ("The Anguished Politics of Breast Cancer," Aug. 15).
The outrage felt by 1 in 9's Francine Kritchik and others when a state study dismissed any link between environmental pollution and breast cancer is entirely justified.
A growing body of evidence suggests that environmental contamination by synthetic chemicals and radiation may play an important role in breast cancer.
Especially suspect are the organochlorines, a class of chlorine-based chemicals that include such highly toxic substances as DDT, PCB's, dioxin, pesticides, plastics and industrial chemicals and byproducts.


Neighborhood Report: Washington Heights; A Delay in Dividing the 34th Precinct
In the summer of 1992, after a wave of violent protests aimed at the police, city officials pledged to bisect the embattled 34th Precinct to increase community policing.
But the birth of the new precinct, scheduled for this month, has been pushed back to February at the earliest, Capt.
Terence Monahan of the 34th Precinct said.
The new precinct, to be called either 34th South or 36th Precinct, would run from 155th Street to 181st.
The project was delayed when the owner of a gas station on the planned site of a temporary station house tried to stop the city from canceling his lease.

An Uppity B.C. Takes Starch Out of Syracuse
A tipped interception of Marvin Graves's last pass stopped Syracuse 12 yards short of the goal line with 80 seconds left to play today and let Boston College capture a game it deserved to win, 33-29.
It was some game.
The lead changed hands eight times, including four times in the fourth quarter, and Boston College never had to punt.
Defense remained Syracuse's problem, as the Eagles piled up 558 yards on offense compared with the Orangemen's 315.
"We haven't stopped anybody all year," said Coach Paul Pasqualoni.

Violins Not Welcome


Rebuilt Pittsburgh Economy Braces for New Blow Under a U.S. Health Plan
This city may always be known as Steel Town, but Medicine City would more accurately describe its economy today.
Health care became the dominant industry here after global competition wiped out most of the area's steel mills in the early 1980's.
The health industry's steady growth, adding about 4,000 jobs a year in the last decade, helped revive the economy.
The local hospitals have a worldwide reputation for transplant surgery and high-technology medicine.


Playing Dix-Huit Holes
WHILE vacationing in Biarritz in the winter of 1890, William K. Vanderbilt and two other gentlemen from Southampton, L.I., stumbled upon an exhibition of golf -- a new sport to them -- performed on the Biarritz course by the Scottish professional "Young" Willie Dunn.
After watching young Willie lob several shots onto the green of the Chasm hole, a par three guarded by a deep pit, Vanderbilt turned to his friends and pronounced: "Gentlemen, this beats rifle shooting for distance and accuracy. It is a game that I think would go in our country."
The encounter proved to be an epochal one in the history of American golf, for Vanderbilt and his friends soon founded the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, one of the first in this country, where Willie Dunn arrived in March 1891 to serve as pro and expand the course.
But while the game caught hold in America, it never developed the same appeal in France, where it remained the preserve of an elite few.


A Percussionist Gives Pluck New Meaning
Her biography reads like that of any successful young musician -- perhaps more successful than most.
She was raised on the family farm in Scotland, showed early musical promise and graduated with honors from the Royal Academy of Music in London.
The first recording in which she took part, as percussionist in Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion with Sir Georg Solti and Murray Perahia, won a Grammy in 1989.
She was the first percussionist to give a solo recital at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
She has made several solo recordings and commissioned a spate of percussion scores.
She was voted Scotswoman of the Decade and recently designated a member of the Order of the British Empire, one notch above the honor bestowed on the Beatles.
And she is only 28.
But one tiny detail is omitted.
Since her early teens, Evelyn Glennie has been classified "profoundly deaf."

Are Women's Hearts Different
Elizabeth Rigdon didn't fit the description of a typical heart patient.
She was only 47, she was female and by many objective measures her heart function seemed normal.
Her electrocardiogram showed no significant abnormalities, though there were some suspicious blips when her heart activity was measured as she exercised.
But Rigdon's symptoms were worse than the test results indicated they should be.
She was suffering from angina, a crushing, terrifying pain in her chest, and was sure she was on the verge of a heart attack.
"My cardiologist didn't take me at all seriously," says Rigdon, a surgical nurse in New London, Conn.
She is now 54.
"All he said was, 'A lot of women live with this all the time -- so live with it.' "


A Sounder Pesticide Law
Lost in the hullabaloo surrounding President Clinton's health care speech last month was another important Administration proposal: a comprehensive overhaul of pesticide laws.
The proposal was promptly denounced by environmentalists as too permissive and by industry groups as too restrictive.
But it looks like a reasonable compromise that should make the food supply safer.
The core of the compromise is a swap that makes both sides angry.
The Administration proposes to do away with the 35-year-old Delaney Clause, a law that absolutely prohibits adding cancer-causing substances to processed foods but does not apply to fresh foods, which are allowed to contain cancer-causing residues.

Yale Inaugurates Dean and Economist as Its 22d President
Richard C. Levin was inaugurated today as the 22d president of Yale University in a traditional bell-ringing ceremony.

The new president, who is 46 and the former dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, specializes in technological change, and he sought to reassure those engaged in university-based research that he is their champion.


Trade Agreement Means Fat Cats Get Fatter; Good for Environment
To the Editor:

Put on a Harper's Face
A SLEW of copycats have emerged in the year since Fabien Baron, the creative director of Harper's Bazaar, directed that magazine's type-happy redesign (which in itself pays homage to the legendary Alexey Brodovitch's use of the Firmin Didot and other typefaces in the magazine in the 40's and 50's).
Whether the product is furniture or sneakers, the sell is similar: Words are BLOWN up to POP off the page.
Letters overlap and come in different colors.
Very Harper's Bazaar (or Calvin Klein, another Baron client).
Herewith, a sampling of current imitators: IKEA Mr.
Baron is fond of Firmin Didot.
So is Patrick O'Neal, an art director at Deutsch/ Dworin, the Manhattan agency that created the Ikea campaign.
"We use a similar typeface -- Bauer Bodoni," he said.
"We were trying to come out with a campaign that included people, and we had to blow up some words to get across strategic parts, like the bus that goes from Manhattan to Elizabeth," N.J.
"I guess it's a compliment to say it's influenced by Harper's Bazaar."


Similarities In Inquiries Into Crimes By Officers
Twenty years ago "pads" and "bagmen" were the cornerstones of corruption in New York City's police ranks.
Now the buzzwords for the acts of renegade officers are "scores" and "doing doors."
While the phrases can be confusing for people outside the world of law enforcement, their meanings point to what experts say is a radical and frightening shift in the nature of illegal acts committed by police officers.

Seeking to ease the strain from an influx of new families in Highbridge, the city has contracted a local group to offer new, affordable day-care options for nearly 300 children.

Floating Fiesta Takes to the Air


ABOUT BOOKS
THE New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame is holding its fifth induction ceremony tonight at the Liberty Science Center at Liberty State Park in Jersey City.
The organization is calling the event "Literary Stargazing," so it seems only appropriate that one of the four authors to be honored is Carl Sagan, the Cornell University astronomer and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, who is a native of Rahway.
The other inductees are Patricia Lee Gauch of Basking Ridge, who has written more than 30 children's books; Robert Lipsyte of Closter, a sports columnist for The New York Times and the author of "The Contender," a young-adult novel published by Harper in 1967 and still in print, and Sister Margherita Marchione of Morristown, author of some 30 books in English and Italian and professor emeritus of Italian language and literature at the Florham Park-Madison campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University.
Each honoree will attend the event.


A Princess With A Noble Cause
Since her former country no longer exists, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia has a title that doesn't make much sense.
"I agree it sounds strange," said the Princess, a member of the exiled Serbian royal family, on Monday from her home in Manhattan, "but it's something you are born with. It doesn't change even if the country vanishes."


Stark, Simple Forms in a Picture-Perfect Setting
THE Somerstown Gallery has left Somers to become the Schoolhouse Galleries here.
And its new home really is a schoolhouse, a 1920's building situated on a hill so that the sun pours through its huge windows.
The owner, Lee Pope, does not do things by halves: in addition to three large galleries, the space accommodates a theater and eight artists' studios, at least one of whose tenants commutes from Manhattan.
A more picture-perfect setup can scarcely be imagined.
On view in the galleries now is a show by two sculptors, John Nesbitt and Brett Stern, and two painters, Ann Richardson and Jean Tate.
Mr.
Nesbitt is the most experienced of the four, having shown extensively in his own country, Canada, since the mid-1950's.
He works with the precision of a jeweler, locking together by means of bolts and welds, forms in alabaster, marble, wood and various metals.
An example is the chunky bronze less than a foot tall, which is impregnated vertically by a sliver of lead and bisected horizontally by a layer of gray marble.
In shape and general character the piece recalls Brancusi's kissing couple.
There are other allusions to reality: a block of stained wood ornamented with bronze elements, which suggests a head, African style, and a bronze that could pass as a flowering plant growing out of a tree trunk.
Otherwise, Mr.
Nesbitt remains a nonobjective sculptor deeply preoccupied with his craft, leaving the skins of his carved elements alternately rough and smooth, welding (or soldering) the cast shapes and combining them all into masses that are virtually watertight.
One of his best efforts is a fence of small alabaster blocks.
He is easily the best artist in the show.
Although Mr.
Stern's is by far the largest contribution -- 13 ceramics -- art seems to be the least of his interests.
Having billed himself in a resume as the president of Symagery, a one-man research and new-product development company, he goes on to list numerous accomplishments.
These include a book titled "99 Ways to Open a Beer Bottle Without a Bottle Opener" and a method of manufacturing clothes without human intervention by way of a machine that can produce a garment in 45 seconds.
His achievements as a model maker include an eight-foot telephone for a television commercial, a four-foot brownie for National Kosher Foods and the beetle headdresses worn in the Broadway musical "Cats." Way down at the bottom of Mr.
Stern's remarkable document are listed the five ceramic shows in which he has participated during the last year or so, one of them at the American Craft Museum in Manhattan.
Given credits like these, a viewer might be forgiven for wondering why Mr.
Stern wants to diversify and how he has the time to do so.
But it is possible that he is following the example set by Samuel F. B. Morse when he turned to portraiture as a means of financing his scientific inventions.
In any case, the ceramics are purely exercises in craft, being variations on a bifurcated shape that looks a lot like the lower half of a standing female torso.
They come in black, gray and shades of brown, with a bubbly crater glaze on the outside and a smooth metallic luster applied to the crevices within.
Although not as obsessive as Mr.
Stern, Ms.
Tate also makes much of a small idea.
Each of her five large canvases is stained or lightly sprayed with color and embossed with rectangles, triangles and dabs of impasto applied thick and glossy in irregular rows.
The colors of these include ultramarine applied neat, and viridian seemingly glazed over white, and they generally hang against backgrounds tinted in a paler version of the same hue, accompanied by patches of, say, thin lemon yellow.
Ms.
Tate's canvases are not bad, but they would be better if she considered more carefully the effects that contiguous colors have on each other.
Ms.
Richardson does consider these effects and, hence, has slightly more success with her variations on a single image.
This is a disk enclosed by a rectangle, which in turn, is enclosed by two or three more rectangles.
The disk, usually black, is often rimmed in a contrasting color, as are the squares, which come in various grays, thinly applied, generally over a contrasting hue.
Nevertheless, the works seem more anxious than spontaneous.
It's as if the artist does not want to push them further for fear of spoiling her happy accidents.
Despite its occasional good points, the show on the whole conveys a feeling of emptiness, a feeling that is more often found in suburban than urban galleries.
Whether or not this is yet another side effect of zoning, Renee Kahn, a painter living in Stamford, has taken up arms against the problem by starting a Journal of American Suburban Art.
Having circulated a leaflet with questions like "Do you deny your suburban identity at New York parties?" and "Has living in the suburbs turned your brains to mush?" Ms.
Kahn plans a first issue based on the responses.
In a telephone conversation, the artist explained that $1 mailed to the journal at 78 Webb's Hill Road, Stamford, Conn. 06903, will yield a photocopy of Volume 1, No. 1, mailed unbound in a paper bag.
From little acorns. . .
The show at the Schoolhouse Galleries continues through Nov. 21.
The phone number is 277-3461.

A la Carte; A Secret in Amagansett: Two Impressive Wine Cellars
WHEN the great restaurant wine lists of Long Island are discussed or rated, the American Hotel of Sag Harbor is nearly always mentioned.
So, too, are the Polo Grill in the Garden City Hotel, Starr Boggs of Westhampton Beach, the Chalet in Roslyn, Conrad's in Huntington and Casa Rustica in Smithtown.
But Gordon's, a 60-seat restaurant on Main Street in Amagansett, is rarely if ever recognized.
That is because George Polychronopoulos, the owner and resident wine expert, does not advertise the fact that the two temperature-controlled cellars underneath Gordon's contain one of the largest and most impressive collections of wines on the Island.

There is no better time to reflect on the summer gone by and judge how well the garden grew.
Besides, it is more pleasant to be outdoors, to take a closer look now that cooler weather is here.
According to this year's weather summaries, 1993 was among the hottest summer on record.
And for many who live in the Northeast, it was also one of the driest summers with little rainfall to spur growth.
As for the hot weather, there was a record-tying number of days in the 90 degree range or higher than ever before.
In fact, this summer tied a record of 39 hot days that was set just two years ago.
The month of July was singled out as having 20 days when the temperature was 90 degrees or higher.

To the Editor:
I can imagine more indignant letters than mine, provoked by Robert Coover's diligent overview of hyperfiction, but none more glum.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
MAQROLL.
Three Novellas: "The Snow of the Admiral," "Ilona Comes With the Rain," "Un Bel Morir." By Alvaro Mutis.
Translated by Edith Grossman.
Harper Perennial, $10.
Maqroll the Gaviero (lookout) searches everywhere for a purpose to his life.
Last year our reviewer, Leonard Michaels, said that in relating a tortured man's physical and spiritual wanderings, this Colombian author has produced "a fascinating and original work."  YOUNG MEN &amp; FIRE By Norman Maclean.
University of Chicago, $9.95.
Winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award and named one of the nine best books of 1992 by The New York Times Book Review, this account examines the 1949 Mann Gulch fire in Montana, a disaster that killed 13 young Forest Service smoke jumpers trapped between the flames and a mountain ridge.
The author seeks not only to arrive at the truth of their tragedy, but also to confront his own mortality and the arbitrary nature of the accidents that often govern our fates.
"This great book takes us to that ancient reef blocking us from the summit and then whirls and looks straight into the heart of the fire," James R. Kincaid said here.


Pages Of Their Own?
DEEP inside a Trump Tower suite, from behind a desk the size of a city sidewalk, Steven Hoffenberg, debt-collection magnate and fledgling publisher, held forth about Women and Journalism.
"The New York Post is wrong about women," he said as he put several incoming calls on hold.
"You put a picture of a dead body on the cover? Disgusting! Women stop buying your paper."


Little-Noted Advantages Of Alternate-Side Parking
To the Editor:
As a New Yorker with wheels, I enjoyed "Car Owners vs. the Odds" (Sept. 19).
Alternate-side parking defines my life and makes me nuts, but there are two positives.
I can go grocery shopping from 9 to 10:30 and get back just in time for a safe, easy parking slot at 11.

Gee, That Dress Looks Familiar
To the Editor:
Further proof that there is nothing new under the sun -- or the bust:


Hawaii Check-Ins Behind the Wheel
A typical 10-day family vacation in Hawaii might include five days on Oahu and five on one of the other islands.
The annoying part comes when it's time to get from one island to the other -- dragging luggage and other paraphernalia from the rental car to the airline counter for what will be a very short flight.
Now Aloha Airlines' new Drive-Thru Check-In, which was begun in August, lets travelers check in without even getting out of the car.
Passengers drive to the fourth level of a new interisland terminal at Honolulu International Airport and get in the Drive-Thru Check-In lane, which has a conveyor belt on one side and an office at the end.
The driver pops the trunk and an Aloha employee checks in the passengers; other employees tag the bags.
The luggage goes to ground-level aircraft via a spiral chute.
Passengers then park and head for the gate.


Meatloaf, for the Back-to-Basics Crowd
MEATLOAF has been attracting considerable attention in recent years.
It is the darling of the back-to-basics food movement, whetting the appetites of those with retro tastes.
It is also cheap and, when combined with mashed potatoes, it may be the ultimate comfort food.
And there are thousands of ways to make it.
I'll never forget the first meatloaf I ever made.
I was newly married and vaguely remembered how my mother put a meatloaf together.
I recalled onions, green pepper, egg and seasonings like ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.


Residential Resales
In the following reports, the "listed at" price is the asking price when negotiations began that ended in the sale.
Time on market is from most recent listing to contract.
MANHATTAN

How Rent Law Makes a Difference
To the Editor:
Your article on the extension of rent stabilization  [ "For Almost All Tenants, Little Change," July 18 ]  was, unfortunately, absolutely right: very few rent-regulated tenants will be affected by the new rules on luxury decontrol.
I say "unfortunately" because the Legislature had the chance to begin to lift the albatross of the rent laws off the backs of owners of affordable rental housing and the city itself.


Class, Sex and History
WHILE ENGLAND SLEEPS By David Leavitt. 304 pp. New York: Viking. $22.


Neighborhood Report: Upper West Side; Where, Oh Where, Has the Post Office Gone?
"Where is 10023?" That was the question that bombarded a postal representative at a recent Community Board 7 meeting, in which the residents tried to pin down the floating post office for that ZIP code.
The Ansonia Station post office moved in August 1992, when its building on Broadway between 67th and 68th Streets was demolished to make way for a new tower being built by Millennium Partners and Lincoln Metrocenter Partners.
The post office is eventually to return to the building, probably by the spring of 1995.

Suspension May Be Revised
GARY BETTMAN, the National Hockey League commissioner, is considering easing restrictions on the practice time of the suspended Washington Capitals forward DALE HUNTER.
"I'm focusing on the practicing part of the suspension," Bettman said on Friday, "and the question in my own mind is whether or not I diminish its severity by letting him practice. And that's the only part that I'm reconsidering."

Sauce for The Gander?
To the Editor:
A friend posed an interesting question regarding the film "Sleepless in Seattle"  [ "In a Stab at a Strategy, Hollywood Tries Some Variety," Sept. 5 ] .
Had the roles been reversed, with Tom Hanks's character becoming obsessed with a woman he'd never met, and had he stalked her, hired a detective to investigate her, and finally dumped his fiancee on a romantic Valentine's Day weekend, all for a stranger, what would the audience's reaction be?

POSTINGS: New Bank Headquarters; Independence On the Move
Independence Savings Bank, the largest savings bank based in Brooklyn, last week announced that it would move its corporate headquarters next September into 195 Montague Street, the former headquarters of Brooklyn Union Gas, which has moved to the Metrotech office center.
The bank will take a condominium interest in 69,200 square feet on six floors of the 13-story, 200,000-square-foot structure, which will be renamed the Independence Building.
The bank will open its 21st branch in 6,500 square feet on the ground floor and lower level.


On the Line


Users Outmuscle Investors for Foreclosed Co-ops
IN a matter-of-fact voice, with no sign of regret, Jonathan Barrett described an apartment catch that slipped off his bidding hook at an auction last June.
"The building was in Bayside," he said.
"It was 60 percent sold. The monthly maintenance was reasonable. A nice apartment. We thought it had a resale value of $45,000. We bid $22,500.


CONNECTICUT GUIDE
60's MINIMALISM
Art connoisseurs who believe that the 60's and 70's got it right will enjoy the new exhibition at the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London.
But "Maximal Minimalism: Selected Works from the LeWitt Collection" is a liberal view of the concept, containing pieces by Sol LeWitt, an acknowledged progenitor of the minimalist movement, and numerous works from his collection, executed by other artists whom he inspired.


Luxury-Tax Repeal Encourages Sellers
LAST month, Thomas G. Caruso, owner of Total Marine Ltd. in Mamaroneck, sold a 37-foot Phoenix convertible sports fishing boat for $400,000.
"It's a beauty," he said.
"Sleeps six. Has everything, including air-conditioning, a microwave and two big diesel engines."
Mr.
Caruso added that negotiations for the sale had begun earlier in anticipation of the repeal of the 10 percent excise or luxury tax on boats costing more than $110,000 and on other expensive items like jewelry and furs, but not on automobiles.
"The customer told me he would have never bought the boat if he had had to pay the luxury tax, which would have added $30,000 more to the purchase price," Mr.
Caruso said.


Suspect in Assault Dies in Custody
A homeless man who was arrested for assault died last night in police custody after a three-block ride inside a police car to a precinct house in Manhattan, the police said.
The man, who was not identified, was pronounced dead at 7:15 P.M. inside a bathroom of the 10th Precinct station house at 230 West 20th Street, where the police and emergency medical workers had tried to revive him, said Lieut.
Thomas Naroney of the 10th Precinct.


The Clinton Health Plan Is Alive On Arrival
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON dazzled five Congressional committees last week, advocating health care legislation in the most impressive testimony on a complex program anyone could remember, and raising hopes that an issue that had stymied Congress for 50 years was now near solution.
Again and again she heard, as Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois put it, "the President has succeeded in changing the debate from whether we should have reform to what type of reform we should have."


Corrections
An article last week about Family Advocates, a group that wants to change the way judges and lawyers work on matrimonial disputes, misstated the affiliation of Bonnie Green of East Meadow.
She is president and co-founder of another group, Protection of the Family, not a member of Family Advocates, whose views she says she does not share.

Bad News Comes in Threes As Columbia Folds Late
Columbia squandered a 24-7 lead today, surrendering three touchdowns in the final five minutes as Colgate rallied for a 27-24 victory.
Colgate running back Bill Sparacio rushed 32 times for 168 yards, falling just 1 yard short of his career-high, which he set against Columbia last year.
In the second quarter, he was unstoppable, rushing for 67 yards on one drive, which ended in his scoring on a 5-yard run.

In the Region/Westchester; Updating Corporate Parks to Meet Today's Needs
IN recent years, the physical layouts and landscaping of office parks built in the 70's have proved totally unsuited to the needs of today's highly discriminating and demanding tenants.
Twenty years ago, the emphasis was on putting up office buildings as quickly and inexpensively as possible to meet an ever-growing demand for space.

Recounting Bayside Killings That Occurred Near Officers
A double killing that occurred in Queens near several off-duty New York City police officers, who failed to come forward and volunteer what they knew, is being graphically recounted at the gunman's trial.
The defendant, Patrick Bannon, is accused of murdering two men and trying to murder a third after an alcohol-fueled brawl exploded into lethal gunfire on July 18, 1992, on a bar-studded strip of Bell Boulevard in Bayside.


For Ashley Judd Acting Was The Siren Song
Ashley Judd, kin to Wynonna and Naomi, the country-singing Judds, describes the process of acting as "guts coming from my toenails." The most recent display of her work can be seen in "Ruby in Paradise," which will be shown on Thursday and Friday at the New York Film Festival and will open commercially later this month.
In the film, directed by Victor Nunez, the 25-year-old Ms.
Judd stars as Ruby Lee Gissing, who escapes a small town in Tennessee to seek her identity working in a gift shop in Panama City, Fla.
After the movie's premiere in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where it shared the Grand Jury Prize with Bryan Singer's "Public Access," many people were asking the director, "Where did you find her?"


Triptych Minus Two


Neighborhood Report: Bayside; Across the Great Subdivide
Bayside is a leafy neighborhood of homeowners where most of the residents are, well, homeowners.
That's an important distinction these days.
In a recurring battle, civic groups and residents have pressed their campaign to prevent single-family homes from being subdivided and used as rental properties in violation of New York City's zoning laws.
The laws specify that a home zoned for single-family use cannot be subdivided into a multi-family dwelling.


200 Protesters Leave Project Peacefully
An 18-hour occupation of a newly constructed public housing project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, came to a peaceful conclusion yesterday afternoon when about 200 mostly Hispanic protesters, who were demanding more apartments in the complex, began trickling out, clutching blankets, television sets and the hands of their children.
City officials promised the protesters the right to closely monitor the selection of tenants for the 150-apartment, four-building complex, due to open next month at South 10th and Berry Streets, in the shadow of the Williamsburg Bridge.
But they did not agree to change the selection process.


Police Hearings' Effects Defy the Usual Wisdom
As the Mollen Commission puts an intense spotlight on an underworld where police officers beat the innocent, traffic in drugs and protect the criminal, an intricate political calculus has been added to the mayoral race.
Which candidate suffers more from hearings that leave the corrosive, dispiriting impression that even the city's guardians have gone bad?
By rights it should be Mayor David N. Dinkins, who has been the steward of the police force for four years.
"Anything that happens on an incumbent's watch in recent political history tends to reflect poorly and consistently on the incumbent," said Jay Severin, a Republican consultant in New York.


After Child's Play, What Comes Next?
The line of well-wishers stretched down the hall, and the violin soloist, Sarah Chang, greeted each one with the polite, tired smile of a hostess at a reception.
This late August concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in upstate New York was her last date in what had been a breathless summer: Korea, Italy, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, Aspen, Montreal, the Hollywood Bowl.
This season she will rack up even more frequent flyer miles, with concerts in Toronto, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, London and Tokyo.
On Monday evening she plays Paganini's First Concerto with Wolfgang Sawallisch and the Philadelphia Orchestra, then they record the work for EMI Classics, as part of her third album.
On Thursday she makes her New York Philharmonic subscription series debut, in the Tchaikovsky Concerto with Kurt Masur.


PUMPING IRON IN THE PARLOR
THE MORNING THE GYM disappeared, a small group of us gathered on the sidewalk, our faces numb with winter cold and with the shock of it: the padlocked door, the bankruptcy notice taped to the window.
Orphaned!
By a health club!
We stood there clutching our gym bags, shivering poignantly, as if unable to start the day without a dose of Nautilus-induced endorphins.
But when the shock wore off, I was relieved.
For some time I'd been toying with the idea of installing a home gym -- how nice it would be not to waste time commuting to the gym or waiting in line to use the machines -- but I'd put it off because of the expense.
Now it was time to put the plan into action.
I already owned a set of free weights, which is all the equipment you need for a proper workout.
But I wanted to make a statement.
I wanted a corner of the apartment to proclaim, "Gym."

About the Baby, The Bathwater And Beyond
Long before parent became a verb, mothers and fathers were driving themselves crazy over how best to care for their babies.
That's one lesson of "Total Baby," one of 62 works in the 17th annual Margaret Mead Film and Video Festival.
The six-day event opens tomorrow at the American Museum of Natural History, then travels to half a dozen cities.
"Total Baby," which was written and directed by two New Yorkers, Kate Davis and Alyson Denny, trains an anthropologist's cool eye on the staggering array of new products and programs (womb-simulating pillows, video mobiles, exercise workouts for newborns, cooking classes for toddlers) aimed at perfecting the American middle-class child from birth to 3 years of age.


Walking Away, While He Still Can; Troubled and Fearing Injury, Timm Rosenbach Quit Football
Timm Rosenbach remembers clearly the beginning of the end because everything was pitch black.
He woke up in a dark room with his head strapped to a table, still wearing his Phoenix Cardinals uniform and shoulder pads and hip pads and cleats.
He was frightened and alone, not sure if he was alive or dead.
He couldn't move, didn't want to move.
He knew he had been hurt, but didn't know how badly.
He thought about his friend and former college teammate, Mike Utley of the Lions, who the year before had taken a tumble in a game and been left paralyzed for life from the chest down.


Corrections
Because of a transcription error, an interview with Ron Chernow, author of "The Warburgs," on page 3 of The Times Book Review today, renders a word incorrectly in a quotation from Mr.
Chernow in the third paragraph.
The comment should read, "To the extent that American writers had dealt with this world before, for instance in Stephen Birmingham's 'Our Crowd,' they had dealt only with the American side of the Warburg family." (Mr. Chernow did not say "the arrogant side.")

The Do-It-Yourself Armamentarium
AT FALK DRUG ON EAST 72D STREET in Manhattan, as at many drugstores around the country, the self-appointed home doctor can choose from a growing arsenal of home-care products.
Tucked into the densely packed shelves are the Clearblue Easy pregnancy test, the First Response ovulation test, the Biotel UTI test for urinary tract infections, several blood-glucose tests for diabetics, the Marshall Home Blood Pressure Kit and the Omron Automatic Oscillometer Digital Blood Pressure Monitor.
Even the Harvey Elite stethoscope, the grown-up version of what children get at the toy store, is there.
A snub-nosed man with untamed brown hair introduces himself as a diabetic who has stopped by to purchase some glucose kits so that he can test himself at home.
He is admittedly something of a self-care junkie.
"I've got a blood-pressure monitor at the apartment, too," he announces proudly.
"I hook that up every so often and make sure I'm alive. My wife, of course, has used the pregnancy tests. I hear that the cholesterol test is on the way, and I can't wait. I'm a big believer in keeping a close eye on my body. It may not surprise you that my wife likes to call me Mr. M.D."


Seeing Stars in Midtown
LAST Monday at the Guild Theater in midtown, Jack Lemmon and Matthew Broderick were floating up the aisle together like branches on a river of love.
They had just seen themselves in the intimate and unsentimental David Mamet teleplay "A Life in the Theater," to be broadcast by Turner Network Television on Saturday.
Surrounded by theater artists and professionals who understood every gesture in the movie, they were basking in a warm moment among family and friends.
"I love David Mamet's writing," Mr.
Lemmon said.
"It was a real privilege to work on this." When he saw Gregory Mosher, who directed the show, he gave him a hug and said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you," in a way that was as unaffected as it was sincere.


THE TRIALS OF BOB PACKWOOD
I am tired of hearing women call almost every word or action by a man "sexual harassment" ("The Trials of Bob Packwood," by Trip Gabriel, Aug. 29).
If we continue in this way, men will be so turned off that they will hesitate even to show kindness for fear it will be misinterpreted.

Sonar Maker Offers Gunfire Detector
Using sonar technology developed to detect submarines, a military contractor is proposing putting a system of sound sensors in cities to alert police to gunfire almost instantly.
The company, Alliant Techsystems of Edina, Minn., has asked the Federal Government to help set up a pilot project in the District of Columbia to see if the detection system is feasible and useful.


Civil War Memories In Revenue Issues
REVENUE stamps, far more common in the United States in the 19th century than they are now, sometimes turn up at odd intersections of history.
One little-explored corner occurs where war meets banking.
Revenue stamps show payment of taxes, much as postage stamps are receipts for payment of postal fees.
Designs of 19th-century revenue stamps have a certain sameness, but most are very well engraved.


Ashley Powell, John W. Stanier
Elizabeth Ashley Powell, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
James B. Powell 2d of Asheville, N.C., was married there yesterday to John Woollcott Stanier, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Stanier, 26, who is known as Ashley, is a senior account executive at Burns McClellan, a public relations company in New York.
She graduated from Duke University.
Her father is an otolaryngologist in Asheville.


A Governor Shoots, But His Guilty Plea Is Wide of the Mark
First he shot some raccoons, and then he shot from the hip, but a court has determined that Rhode Island's gun-toting Governor was guilty of nothing more serious than insisting he was guilty.
The episode began one night in July when the Governor, Bruce Sundlun, grabbed a 12-gauge shotgun and headed outside to investigate a racket in the yard of his four-acre waterfront estate in Newport.


From Defiance to Defeat: Union's Struggle Ends in Bitterness
Reporters, editors and advertising workers at The New York Post voted yesterday to end their bitter weeklong strike, but it remained uncertain whether they would have jobs to return to as the paper's new owner, Rupert Murdoch, planned to force them to reapply.
At the headquarters of their union, the Newspaper Guild of New York, the workers who had defiantly walked off the job on Monday, shutting down The Post for three days, voted to take down their picket line at noon on Monday and acquiesce to Mr.
Murdoch's demand.
The vote followed an emotional, at times angry, 90-minute meeting yesterday.


Some Exhaust Fans Are Tricky to Install
INSTALLING an exhaust fan in a poorly ventilated bathroom, laundry or kitchen can help prevent indoor condensation and problems like mildew, peeling paint and damaged woodwork.
Mounting a fan on an outside wall may be reasonably easy, but mounting one in a ceiling can be difficult unless the ceiling is accessible from an attic.
That is because ceiling fans require separate and sometimes lengthy ducts to carry exhaust air outside.
In all cases, electrical wiring has also to be installed.


Miss Williams And Mr. Braff
Margaret Elizabeth Williams, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Fayette Creed Williams of Tupelo, Miss., was married yesterday to Douglas Paul Braff, a son of Mrs.

Mrs.
Braff, an interior designer in New York, graduated from Vanderbilt University, as did her husband, and received a graduate design degree from the Parsons School of Design.

What Were They Chanting? '100 Wins in '94'?
Sid Fernandez gave a meaningless game some meaning for five and one-third innings tonight.
That's how long the Mets' left-hander held the Florida Marlins without a hit.
Bret Barberie ended the suspense with a soft liner to center field.
Later that inning, Fernandez also lost his shutout.
But the victory was no problem, a 7-1 triumph that was the Mets' fifth straight.

Return of Fairness Doctrine to Air Wouldn't Harm Free Speech
To the Editor:
In "The Unfairness Doctrine" (Op-Ed, Sept. 20), Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo attacks regulatory schemes such as the fairness doctrine by conjuring the specter of state censorship.
Yet, Governor Cuomo overlooks the dangers of creating a system of practical censorship based on corporate and consumer patronage.
Certainly a free marketplace of ideas is an agreeable image.
But in the United States -- as opposed to virtually all other western democracies -- we actually rely on the market and private marketing decisions to disseminate political information.

Her father is a senior attending physician in obstetrics and gynecology at St.
John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers.


Jericho, Trumpets, Walls, Etc.
What signing of a peace agreement on the White House lawn -- will it be remembered as a historical moment?
No.
Historical refers generally to history, as in "a historical fact"; the shorter historic, however, means "a moment or event of great significance, to be long remembered."
A second problem: What article belongs before historic, a or an?


SEPT. 26-OCT. 2: No Special Prosecutor; Inquiry Into Dealings By Brown Heats Up
For months, an accusation that Commerce Secretary Ron Brown had sought a $700,000 payment in exchange for help in lifting the United States trade embargo against Vietnam only smoldered.
It seemed vague, having originated with a Vietnamese businessman in Florida, Ly Thanh Binh, who said his information came from a former partner, Nguyen Van Hao, who denied the story.
Mr.
Brown and his aides said the charge was preposterous; the aides suggested that the Secretary did not know Mr.
Hao.


Controversy Flares Over Lyme Disease
"I WANT you to imagine that someone is inside your skull squeezing your brain like a sponge," said Anne Ebert, a Howell Township resident, describing one symptom of Lyme disease, which she has had since the late 1970's.
Ms.
Ebert, whose three children also suffer from Lyme disease, is the founder of a grass-roots organization that is at the center of a controversy surrounding the disease.
The controversy has set physician against physician, researcher against researcher, and victims of the disease against the health insurance companies that pay for the medicine used to treat it.
It touches nearly every aspect, from diagnosis to treatment to cure.

Meatloaf, for the Back-to-Basics Crowd
MEATLOAF has been attracting considerable attention in recent years.
It is the darling of the back-to-basics food movement, whetting the appetites of those with retro tastes.
It is also cheap and, when combined with mashed potatoes, it may be the ultimate comfort food.
And there are thousands of ways to make it.
I'll never forget the first meatloaf I ever made.
I was newly married and vaguely remembered how my mother put a meatloaf together.
I recalled onions, green pepper, egg and seasonings like ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.


Whitman and Florio Issue Pair of Hard-Edged Ads
With a month of campaigning to go in the race for governor, Jim Florio and his Republican challenger, Christine Todd Whitman, have begun pounding away at each other with new ads.
The hard-edged advertisements are a familiar strategy for Mr.
Florio and his campaign.
But they are new ground for Mrs.
Whitman, who had avoided so-called negative advertisements until recent polls showed her losing ground to Mr.
Florio in what had been a dead heat as late as three weeks ago.


Shevardnadze's Fight With Rebels Links His Fate to Georgia's Future
At one point during the 11-day siege of Sukhumi, when Abkhazian separatist forces aided by Russian irregulars were bearing down on the coastal city, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, found out that his own bodyguards, fearing for his safety, had confiscated the keys to his car.
"They said he yelled at them, called them wet rags, cowards and, excuse me, old women," said a top aide, Teymuraz Stepanov.
"And then he jumped into another car and drove off to the front."


Keyboards of a Different Sort
THOUSANDS of aspiring actors, dancers, writers and composers try to break into New York's fiercely competitive creative fields every year, and almost all of them face the problem of supporting themselves during the inevitable years of anonymity and rejection.
But David Pogue, a music major fresh out of Yale in 1985, found a means of financial sustenance that became far more lucrative than most side jobs.
In the process, he brought Silicon Valley to Broadway, met celebrities, and pushed his original career choice into the shadows.


Cracow
To the Editor: We enjoyed "Sprucing Up in Eastern Europe" (July 18).
However, we were disappointed that there was no mention of three easy day trips from Cracow to historically and culturally important sites.
These trips are what made our visit to Cracow so rewarding.
The trips are the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau (about an hour by train); the Jasna Gora monastery in Czestochowa, home of the Black Madonna, an important Catholic and nationalist site (two to three hours by train,) and the Wieliczka Salt-Mine and Underground Mining Museum, a 700-year-old mine still in production, with spectacular carvings and chapels executed in salt, some dating from the 17th century (less than an hour by train).

Ripe for the Picking


Playing Favorites: The Pros and Cons
To the Editor:
Regarding "Hey Boomers: Share the Wealth, Dudes" (Viewpoints, Sept. 26), it's about time for the geniuses in corporate America to wake up and recognize the danger of destroying their customer base as demonstrated by their unwillingness to provide real jobs for the twentysomething generation.
The brain trust of business once again illustrates their wonderful capacity to think solely in terms of short-run profits.
Just who do these companies expect to buy their goods and services in the future?

Her mother was an executive secretary at James Harvie &amp; Partners, a real estate developer in White Plains.


Debunking the Myths About Public Schools
To the Editor:
As a public-school teacher and a parent of two children attending public school -- all of us in District 2 in Manhattan -- I wholeheartedly support the main idea of Eric Rothenberg's article on his daughter's switch from private to public school: "I can't help but wonder what might be accomplished citywide if those of us who have been running away from the public schools stopped running" ("When a Product of the Private Schools Goes Public," Sept. 19).


Trying to Make Molehills Out of Medical Mountains
WHEN Dr.
Stephen P. Kelly hung out his shingle 17 years ago, he had one secretary mailing out bills to patients and answering phones in his busy Dobbs Ferry office.
Today, the 43-year-old general practitioner has an office manager, five full-time secretaries and six computer terminals in an effort to stay on top of what has become a Sisyphean task: processing patients' insurance forms for a myriad of health-care plans.


Cracow
To the Editor: Jane Perlez's otherwise comprehensive "Cracow Emerges From the Shadows" (July 18) leaves the impression that there are no Catholic churches in Nowa Huta, "a soulless satellite city" the Communists built outside Cracow.
As Archbishop of Cracow, Karol Cardinal Wojtyla oversaw the erection at Nowa Huta of a church dedicated to Mary, Queen of Poland.
On his second visit to Poland, in 1983, when he was Pope John Paul II, he consecrated a great church at Nowa Huta dedicated to Father Maximilian Kolbe, the Franciscan friar martyred by the Nazis.

Sports of The Times; Help Save Poor George From Exile
GEORGE STEINBRENNER is not a fool.
A bully, yes.
A blowhard, yes.
An auslander, the Man From Tampa, yes.
But he is not a fool.
George Steinbrenner even reads a history book now and then, and he is bright enough to know that people are eventually remembered and even stereotyped for one single act, one fateful decision, one ultimate defining moment.


Intellectuals in Love: My Speak-Easy Romance With Lionel Trilling
WE met at a speak-easy; it was 1927 and Prohibition was at its height.
The speak-easy was called Mario's; later, it was where Lionel Trilling and I had much of our courtship.
There were more elegant speak-easies in New York than Mario's, converted East Side mansions with handsome iron gates and the imposing air of art galleries that deal only in Old Masters, but they were expensive and intimidating.
Mario's occupied the two lower floors of a rundown brownstone in the West 40's; it could once have been a theatrical boardinghouse and was now a speak-easy only in the sense that it sold illegal liquor and that its owner went through the required ritual of inspecting his customers through a peephole in the locked front door.
In all other respects it was a family-style trattoria, serving excellent home-cooked food at low prices.
Most important, it was safe to drink its liquor.
Every day during the Prohibition years the newspapers published their grim toll of people blinded or killed by wood alcohol.
We were no more deterred by their warnings than a later generation would be deterred from the use of drugs by warnings in the press.
There was no problem in gaining access to a speak-easy in Prohibition; anyone could turn up a "friend" whose name would open some thickly bolted door.
The innocent, as opposed to the sinister, speak-easy scene is wonderfully portrayed in that rarest of American literary achievements, a good comic novel: Elmer Davis's "Friends of Mr. Sweeney." Not the police but death or blindness was what people like ourselves had to fear from Prohibition.


Bourque Decision Is Coming
The Boston Bruins and defenseman RAYMOND BOURQUE met for six hours with a salary arbitrator in Tampa, Fla., on Friday, but a decision isn't expected on the case for another five days.
Bourque, a 10-time All-Star, is thought to be asking for a contract in the range of $4.25 million annually for two seasons.
The Bruins are offering about $2 million a year.


For 3 Tabloid Papers, Some More Tightrope
With the successful completion of Rupert Murdoch's long struggle to buy back The New York Post, newspaper analysts and executives say New York City's three money-losing tabloid newspapers appear to be poised on the brink of a strange new era of resilient nonprosperity.
It is shaping up, these experts say, as an extended period of unaccustomed stability for The Post, The Daily News and New York Newsday, based on the deep pockets of their owners -- a period of labor peace and financial security that seemed highly unlikely even a few months ago.


HOSTILITY LINGERS IN ISRAEL AND P.L.O.
For anyone who thought that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would suddenly melt with handshakes at the White House, the last few days have brought sobering reminders of the hostility and violence that lurk ever around the corner here.
Today Israeli soldiers evacuated dozens of Gazans from their homes and fired hand-held rockets at houses in a search for fugitives of the Islamic militant group Hamas in Gaza City and the nearby Bureij refugee camp.
Two Hamas commanders were killed and 16 members of the movement were arrested, the army said, in what appeared to be a major blow to the group.


A Chance to Meet the Artists
VARIETY is the essence of the 17th Annual Morristown Craftmarket.
Many of the 150 artists, who were chosen by a jury of their peers, are experimenting with new forms and innovative media.
Others are producing handsome traditional crafts, using centuries-old techniques.
More than 15,000 visitors are expected to wander the aisles of the National Guard Armory next weekend.
Shopping for craft items can be an educational and creative experience.
These fairs provide opportunities to talk to the artists, who come from from 31 states, and learn how an object was made.


At Work; Getting Ahead in a Diverse World
AS corporate America slouches toward the millenium, it slouches with the knowledge that the workplace of the future will be increasingly representative of the country's diverse population.
Several books on diversity meant to help corporations in their transition to the new world order have slipped onto book shelves in the last year or so, only to die the death of a thousand glazed eyes.
This year, diversity books are oriented toward employees rather than human resources departments.
The obvious audiences for the books discussed here are members of minority groups looking for jobs or advancement.
Maybe it's a white thing to say so, but much of the information presented transcends race, gender and ethnicity.
"The Minority Career Guide" (Peterson's, Princeton, N.J.) comes with a long subtitle -- "What African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans Must Know to Succeed in Corporate America" -- and a troika of authors: Michael F. Kastre, Nydia Rodriguez Kastre and Alfred G. Edwards.


THE TRIALS OF BOB PACKWOOD
Grabbing arms and waists?
Pulling back hair without warning or invitation?
What is Senator Packwood guilty of?
Plainly, assault.
Why does following this with a gross imitation of a passionate kiss turn it into sexual harassment?
These women could have filed charges with the police.
DOROTHY J. MAGLIOCCA East Brunswick, N.J.


An Elegant Place for a Seafood Lunch
WHEN we heard several months ago that Cafe du Bec Fin in Old Greenwich was eliminating its dinner service and converting its main dining room to a fish store, to be called Bec Fin Fish Market and Cafe, we were dismayed.
Few good seafood restaurants exist in Connecticut, and since 1986 it has been one of the very best.
But, seafood fanciers, we are delighted to report that all is not lost.
Bec Fin continues to serve lunch every day but Sunday, and an elegant lunch it is.
Incorporating the words fish market in its title suggests something less than fancy, but the chef and owner, Joseph Cizynski, has kept intact the front part of his restaurant (where lunch was always served), with a stucco half-wall separating it from the glass display cases of the shop.
The cafe is a bright and cozy place for lunch, with a blue tiled floor, blue and white Mexican tile trim on creamy stucco walls and cafe curtains at the windows.
There is seating for 20 at well-spaced, well-napped tables set with blue and white Villeroy &amp; Boch china and fresh roses.
And at the end of lunch each woman diner is still presented with a single rose, a reminder that lunch can be as comely as dinner.
Service is as careful and the staff as well-trained as ever.
A mural depicts cafe life at Moulin Rouge.
The French theme is appropriate, for Chef Cizynski's skills are French-based, with a few Asian accents and ingredients.


POSTINGS: Transforming a Cinema City; From Show Biz to the Business of Education
When the Fox Film Corporation built it in 1919, 444 West 56th Street was publicized as the world's biggest movie studio under one roof.
It was a veritable motion-picture city, complete with two 40-foot-high, 15,000-square-foot stages, in which numerous silent classics were filmed and screened.
Then talkies came in, and the building's once-budding show biz career got reduced to cameo appearances (William Fox's wood paneled office stood in for a Harvard dining club in the 1971 film "Love Story").
Loath to spend the huge amount it would have taken to convert it to sound stages, Fox instead used the building for offices.
In 1973 Enterprise Development Associates bought it and converted it into a midtown campus for the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which has since moved to the old Haaren High School building a few blocks north on 10th Avenue.


Business Diary/September 26 - October 1
THE ECONOMY Can Anything Resist Hillary Clinton?
Time Will Tell An irresistible force met an immovable body last week; at press time, the world had not ended.
First, one very powerful force, Hillary Rodham Clinton by name, stormed Capitol Hill in search of support for "health security," and even the crustiest of pols were moved to applaud her.
But a day later the health plan hit a wall called the American Medical Association.
After working quietly to shape the plan, the A.M.A. suddenly went public with a long list of gripes, complaining, for example, that "physicians will be given financial incentives to provide less care." Lawmakers no doubt heard this loud and clear, for doctors are big political contributors.
Well, no one said it would be easy.


Corrections
A dance listing on page 44 of the Arts and Leisure section today reverses two performance times for the Pi Dance Theater in some copies.

Only Thing Missing Is an Oompah Band
NEARLY a half-century ago, when Victor Koenig opened Koenig's in Floral Park, servicemen returning from World War II were moving to Long Island with their young families.
Those former G.I.'s still flock to Koenig's with their grown children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Continuity of this sort is a rarity on an island where a restaurant of 10 or 20 years is considered old.

Mandela Looking for Free-Market Investors
Having been viewed as a liberator and a martyr, Nelson Mandela has now cast himself in a new, seemingly unfamiliar role: salesman for his country.
But Mr.
Mandela, the head of the African National Congress, has found himself somewhat frustrated by the hesitancy of some members of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States to back fully the lifting of sanctions on South Africa.


Trailer-Park Chic Is No Joke
To the Editor:
The article on the "trailer-park esthetic" ("Trash Fash," Sept. 12) asked whether dysfunctional behavior was caused by gas fumes (unlikely) and mentioned beer for breakfast (a certainty).


Rink Exchanges Pucks for Big Bird
AS the New York Islanders trained at the Rinx at Hidden Pond Park in Hauppauge, coaches and executives gathered around a conference table in a room above the ice to discuss roster moves, salaries and logistics.
As soon as camp ended, however, the personality of the room changed quickly.
Workers decorated the walls with large pictures of Big Bird and the Cookie Monster.
A rocking horse and toddlers' toys took over part of the space as a preschool set up shop.
Children visited to see where they would spend the next nine months.


FISHING WITH PRESIDENTS
Raines's article does indeed enforce my view that fishing refreshes the spirit as well as the flesh.

Neighborhood Report: East New York; Long Quest for a New School Gets Longer
The students of Intermediate School 171 in East New York may be wondering if they'll ever get a break.
They're sitting in classrooms far from their former, desperately crowded school at 528 Ridgewood Avenue, which has been closed because of asbestos contamination.
But that's the least of their troubles.


When Creation Fills a Deathly Silence
THE EFFECT OF THE VIRUS IS blatant, too blatant even to think of concealing: his skin is a dull copper color and hangs on him "like the shirt of Nessus" -- as he states in "Blue," his latest film.
His right eye is frozen in a surreal, sightless opacity; he is unable to walk a straight line.
Still, this is his show, and he is determined not to be found wanting.
Surrounded by an affectionate entourage, he makes an understated but deliberate entrance in a loose-fitting white linen suit that belies, just for this evening, the pallor of his illness.
Somehow he musters the strength to cross the high-ceilinged hall, to climb the monumental stairs and to smile long enough to charm the several hundred visitors who have come to the opening of "Queer," an exhibition of his paintings during the summer at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni here.


Mary E. Hughes, Peter M. Tevebaugh

Hem. Ahem. Hum!
As the curtain goes up on the fall fashion season, many women are enjoying the freedom to choose the hem length that suits them -- from micromini, left, to ankle-length, lower left, as worn by a mother and her daughter after services on Yom Kippur.
With designers in Paris showing miniskirts and designers in New York showing ankle-length skirts, some women are feeling confused and insecure.
Should they follow their own instincts or rely on designers to decide on a single length?
One woman, at right, answered the question whimsically with a dress that was long in front and short in back.
Three Fifth Avenue shoppers, above right, stopped to discuss the merits of long versus short.
Below right, two women pausing to greet each other represented the coexistence of long and short.
It has taken 20 years for women to gain the freedom to ignore dictated hemlines and to wear the length they please when they please.
On the days they don't choose to wear leggings or pants.


SEPT. 26-OCT. 2: Boutros-Ghali Demurs; Clinton Sets Limits On U.S. Readiness For U.N. Peacekeeping
The Clinton Administration took a big step last week away from its earlier embrace of international peacekeeping as a means of preventing conflicts and maintaining security.
Having absorbed a handful of American casualties in Somalia, and now facing the prospect that 25,000 American troops may be called upon to help enforce an uneasy peace in Bosnia (if one is ever signed), the Administration made it clear that it wants to set its own rules for when and how Americans will take part in peacekeeping missions.
President Clinton's maiden speech before the United Nations included arms control proposals, a lecture on bureaucratic inefficiency, and a pledge that America would remain a leader.
But it pointedly set out conditions for a wise peacekeeping mission, and the sentence that resonated in the delegates' lounge was: "If the American people are to say yes to U.N. peacekeeping, the United Nations must know when to say no."


Sound Bytes; Drawing on Family Values To Fight the Software Wars
AS a graduate student in Utah in 1969, Alan Ashton proposed two summer projects: linking the school's organ to a computer for "music by numbers," or developing a word processing program.
His professors chose the music project.
Nine years later Mr.
Ashton revived the word processing idea as a way to augment his teacher's salary and support his growing family, and today he is president of the Wordperfect Corporation, the maker of the Wordperfect word processing program and the largest privately held company in the personal computer software industry.
The company has estimated sales of more than $500 million a year.


Neighborhood Report: Upper West Side; Room for Books or Cars, Not Both
In Morningside Heights, the love of books is clashing with a more mundane concern: the need for parking spaces.
Since 1936, the neighborhood branch of the New York Public Library has been in the basement of Butler Library at Columbia University.
But during the summer, the university informed the city that, because it was renovating and expanding Butler, the branch would have to move by January 1995.


Andre Watts Joins Stamford Recital
IT is a pretty impressive line-up -- Andre Watts, George Shearing, Joe Williams, the American Indian Dance Theater -- as the Stamford Center for the Arts swings into its cultural programming.
At the Palace Theater, at 8 P.M. on Friday, Mr.
Watts, known worldwide as a superlative soloist, takes on the more modest role of chamber musician, joining five colleagues -- Marcia Butler, Gary Hoffman, Ani Kavafian, Georg Schenk and David Shifrin -- in an evening of sonatas by Brahms and Poulenc, sets of variations by Saint-Saens and Lutoslawski, and Mendelssohn's Trio in D Minor.
Next Sunday at 3 the keyboard spotlight falls on George Shearing while Joe Williams adds his vocal stylings to an afternoon dubbed "Just Friends"; the chants and ritual dances of Indians will be on display at 8 P.M. on Oct. 11 when the American Indian Dance Theater performs.
The colorfully costumed singers, dancers and musicians then stay on for a 10 A.M. program the following day in the center's Young Audience Series.


And on Sunday, Boggs (3 for 4) Can Rest
When Wade Boggs went to sleep Friday night, he was laboring under the misconception that all he had to do was show up for yesterday's game against Detroit at Yankee Stadium, get a hit to guarantee the 11th .300 batting average of his career and then take the rest of the season off.
"When I got here, Buck Showalter called me into his office and told me that instead of needing to get just one hit, I had to go 2 for 4," said Boggs, the five-time American League batting champion.


Time for A Timeout
To the Editor:


Dinkins Disavows Backer's 'Fascist' Remark
Stung by two days of criticism over a supporter's charge that Rudolph W. Giuliani is backed by "fascist" elements, Mayor David N. Dinkins strove late yesterday to put the issue behind him.
"My whole life in public service has been about bringing the people of our city together," Mr.
Dinkins said in a written statement released just before 5 P.M.
"So, again, I will not tolerate nor have I ever tolerated any religious, ethnic or racial statements by supporters of any candidate. I value and appreciate all my supporters, but obviously I do not agree with every statement made by every supporter." 'No Candidate Is Racist'
He added, "No candidate in this election is racist, fascist or anti-Semitic."


Native Plants Survive Amid Adversity
FALL is here.
There is no better time to reflect on the summer gone by and judge how well the garden grew.
Besides, it is more pleasant to be outdoors, to take a closer look now that cooler weather is here.
According to this year's weather summaries, 1993 was among the hottest summer on record.
And for many who live in the Northeast, it was also one of the driest summers with little rainfall to spur growth.
As for the hot weather, there was a record-tying number of days in the 90 degree range or higher than ever before.
In fact, this summer tied a record of 39 hot days that was set just two years ago.
The month of July was singled out as having 20 days when the temperature was 90 degrees or higher.


Fordham, Ahead 24-7, Loses to Penn to Stay Without a Victory
Penn 34, Fordham 30
Penn surrendered 24 unanswered points in the first half to Fordham (0-4), then roared back in the second half yesterday to claim a 34-30 victory in Philadelphia.


Partitioned in Fact, Bosnia Sees Even Its Dream Die
ON a chilly night last week, the alumni of one of Sarajevo's best high schools met for a 20th reunion.
Of the 30 graduates, only six remained in the city, most of the others having fled months before, when it was easier to escape the Serbian siege.
The former classmates made it an occasion, dressing as they hadn't since the war began.
They pooled meager stocks of coffee and food, and walked to the gathering through pitch-black streets.
The six had more than the usual reasons to celebrate a shared youth.
Among them were Croats, Muslims and Serbs, a matter of little significance two decades ago, when most young people defined themselves not by culture or religion but as Yugoslavs.
But that was before the rise of the ethnic nationalism that has fueled the Bosnian war.
All present were conscious that their gathering now, under the Serbian nationalist guns that have destroyed the city, was a symbol of defiance.


Haunting Works From the 60's
IN THE NEW YORK ART WORLD OF the early 1960's, Lee Bontecou was one of the hottest young artists around.
Her glowering canvas reliefs with their aggressively protruding mouthlike orifices were widely seen as offering an alternative to the exhausted formulas of Abstract Expressionism.
She exhibited with Leo Castelli, the city's most prestigious dealer for new art, and museums across the country bought her work.
But by the early 1970's, Bontecou (BON-ta-coo) was fading from sight.
The new work she unveiled in 1971, which consisted of large plastic flowers and fish, was poorly received -- although from today's vantage point it bears a startling resemblance to the popular fish lamps of the architect Frank Gehry.
In the meantime, the artist had married and moved to Pennsylvania.
The museums that owned her work displayed it less and less often.


St. Thomas Gets Triathlon Event
For the first time, St.
Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands is playing host to America's Paradise Triathlon, a sports event that since 1988 had been held on St.

Local Indians Seeking Ways To Aid Earthquake Victims
This was supposed to be a happy time for the Indian community in the New York area.
Hindu groups have been preparing for the fesitival of Navrati, which celebrates the triumph of good over evil.
Sam and Raj, an appliance store that was the first in the "Little India" section of Jackson Heights, Queens, was holding a 20th anniversary sale.
But Thursday's news of a devastating earthquake in India has changed plans.
Some Navrati festivals will be used to collect money and supplies to help the survivors of the quake.

Kasparov Takes an Old Path to Safety
Either Gary Kasparov or Nigel Short was out to probe the opponent's acquaintance with a line of play two decades old in Game 13 of their world championship match yesterday in London.
But neither had any problem with the task, nor with the endgame that ensued.
The result was a draw.
Kasparov reached the score of 8 1/2 points to Short's 3 1/2 and thus continued to creep relentlessly toward the 12 1/2 points that will gain the winner's prize of $1.43 million of the $2.55 million purse in the 24-game series.


Neighborhood Report: Highbridge; Busy Sidewalks, Busy Thieves
East 77th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues is a busy block.
There are four subway entrances, three public garages, numerous medical offices, seven large apartment buildings, five schools in the immediate area and Lenox Hill Hospital just down the street.
Added to the normal congestion, there are quite a few vendors and pickpockets.
"The place has become chaotic," said Nikki Henkin, who heads the 100-299 East 77th Street Block Association, which campaigned for three years to rid the area of vendors.
The sidewalk hawkers sell everything from Oriental rugs to jewelry, often forcing pedestrians to take to the streets.


U.S. Delays Sanctions for Libya in Pan Am Blast
The United States, Britain and France have agreed to delay new economic sanctions against Libya for another two weeks to give that country more time to hand over two Libyans for trial in connection with the 1988 bombing of an American jetliner over Scotland, diplomats said today.
The delay was urged by the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who told those governments last week he was convinced that the Libyan leader, Col.
Muammar el-Qaddafi, was now ready to surrender the suspects but wanted more time to prepare his country for the decision.


F.Y.I.
Avenue Overhaul Q.  Is it my imagination or is the city constantly ripping up, refilling and then reripping up the Avenue of the Americas?
This has been going on for a while, and the effect on traffic is disastrous.
A.
Road construction is done in phases, so digging and redigging is necessary.
In the first stage of major overhauls like the present job on Avenue of the Americas between West 32d and 59th Streets, the contractor rips up the street to get at the sewer lines, 10 to 30 feet below the street.
After the lines are replaced, temporary asphalt is laid down so traffic can proceed -- that is, until the street is ripped up again to accommodate work on the water main, 5 to 10 feet below the street's surface.
"This gives the appearance that they did something wrong and have to go back to fix it," said Lisa Doglian, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation.
"But really this is the best way. Otherwise we would have to close down an entire route for two years, or a few blocks for several months."
The project will stop for a while around Thanksgiving, to avoid holiday traffic tie-ups, and should be near completion by next summer.
A Tree Grows
Q.
How do you go about getting trees for your block?
A.
It's not as hard as you might imagine.
Find the address of your community board in the telephone book.
Then simply file a request with the board, which will work with the street tree coordinator in the Parks Department to put a tree on your block.
Equal Haircuts
Q.
Why do New York salons charge more for women's haircuts than men's?
Why would an otherwise liberal city tolerate sexist scissors?
Is it even legal?
A.
Absolutely not, according to Linda Sachs, the assistant commissioner for the City Department of Consumer Affairs.
"If salons are engaged in setting prices based on gender, it is a violation of the New York City Human Rights law," she said.
The commission has sued various hair salons violating the law, and the salons were forced to equalize their pricing.
The logic behind the difference varies.
Some stylists say that women generally have longer hair; others that men don't get their hair blown dry -- a notion often belied by contemporary hair fashions.
Many salon workers say they don't know how their pricing policy came about.
"It's just always been the rate," said an employee at the West Eighth Street branch of International Haircutters, a citywide chain that charges $13 and up for men, $18 and up for women.
Another salon, Rubann on East 57th Street, charges men $45 and women $50.
If you are charged more for a cut than a man, you can report the salon to the Human Rights Commission at (212) 306-7500.

Honda Rolls Out Its New Accord
IT was noon and traffic was oozing on New York's 42d Street.

'Good' Jobs in Hard Times
ALMOST unnoticed, discount retailers like Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, Venture and Home Depot are becoming a huge source of new employment in America.
The jobs they offer, mostly at $5 to $9 an hour, would have been unappealing in another era.
But in these hard times, the low hourly pay -- sweetened with health insurance and profit sharing -- is turning out to be one of the best deals that corporate America is offering to the mass of Americans looking for "good" jobs.
Leading this process is Wal-Mart, the nation's second-biggest private employer, after General Motors.
In the 30 months since the recession ended, no other company has added so many jobs to the national work force as has Wal-Mart: 153,000 of them, a significant contribution to the net increase of 1.9 million jobs created in the United States during the recovery.
The other 165 or so discount retail chains together accounted for an additional 186,000 jobs, according to Chain Store Guide, a trade publication, which gathers such data.
The Labor Department does not track employment at discount stores.

Novels for the Computer
To the Editor:
Hyperfiction may conceal countless layers of creative computerized subplots, but it is clearly revealing our boredom with decades of hyped but, alas, hollow modern fiction.
The "volumeless imagination" and exaggeration of modern writing, which apparently hasn't satisfied the reader in book form, will ultimately lose its fascination in this new form.

Neighborhood Report: Highbridge; A Bittersweet Season
The growing doubts about the Yankees' future in the Bronx have been especially painful for the small merchants in the shadow of Yankee Stadium.
That's because the new talk comes after a year in which the Yankees played well for a change and helped drum up business for their neighbors along the way.
Indeed, the team's unexpected run for first place, down to the very last days of the season, kept fans and revelers flooding into the economically struggling neighborhood in greater numbers, and for far longer, than in less-competitive years.


His Urban Harvest
BARRY BENEPE is a 65-year-old pit bull.
His tenacity has produced 20 Greenmarkets for New York City, stretching from City Hall to Harlem Hospital, from the Grand Concourse to Grand Army Plaza, enlivening public spaces and providing food so fresh that restaurant owners go out of their way to shop at the markets.
But instead of thanking Mr.
Benepe, the city's bureaucracy -- the Police, Sanitation and Transportation Departments, the community boards, the Port Authority, the Board of Education -- has thrown up obstacles as daunting today as they were in 1976, when the first farmers' market opened at 59th Street and Second Avenue.
Like most visionaries, Mr.
Benepe cannot be deterred, and his stubbornness has produced its share of detractors.
But if he were not so single-minded, there might be no Greenmarkets.


For Florio, Comfort From Other Governors' Distress?
Gov.
Jim Florio of New Jersey may have reason to be grateful for the fiscal problems in New York and Connecticut as he campaigns for re-election, based on research by two Princeton University economists.
In their study of the impact of tax increases on the re-election chances of incumbent governors in 48 states between 1960 and 1989, Timothy Besley and Anne Case said that a governor who has presided over an increase of at least $100 per year in the tax bills of households earning $40,000 or more in 1976 dollars is 15 percent less likely to win another term than governors in states with lower increases or none at all.

In the Venice Cup for women's teams, that streak has been matched by Dorothy Truscott and Emma Jean Hawes.


Judgment Call


FERMAT'S THEOREM
We've learned a thing or two.
We know we live in a small corner of an expanding universe.
We know that matter is made of atoms.
We know that absolute truth is hard to come by.
And now we know -- having spent three and a half centuries on it -- that no number cubed can be the sum of two other cubed numbers, nor any fourth power the sum of two fourth powers, nor any higher power the sum of two like powers.
What a peculiar bit of knowledge!
Yet if anyone is out there judging the galaxy's civilizations according to some handbook of "What Every Bright Species Ought to Know," it seems reasonable to suppose that somewhere on the list will be the fact of arithmetic that we call Fermat's Last Theorem.
It must be a universal truth -- true here, true everywhere, true now, true always.


Playing Favorites: The Pros and Cons
To the Editor:
The suggestion that employers hire more of the members of the generation born after 1961, not as temps but in real jobs with real opportunities, should prompt any fair-minded employer to make the following reply:


What Makes a Building Shrivel Up and Die?
Back in the 1960's, Andy Warhol was invited to participate in a group show, but instead of contributing a painting, Warhol took a broom and swept the gallery floor.
I thought it was one of the smartest works he ever made -- if people could bring themselves to collect soup cans, why not gather dust? -- and I thought of it again recently when the asbestos scare came crashing down, plunging New York City into panic over the safety of its public schools.
The story highlighted the appalling lack of maintenance in the city's school buildings, but it also illuminated a need to refurbish ways of thinking about architecture itself.
This is not the school story we were supposed to be reading this year.
These were not the pictures we were supposed to see.
Instead of the daily deluge of images of decaying floor tiles, falling-down ceilings and distraught parents, we were meant to be looking with pride and amazement at the remarkable new school buildings that have opened their doors this year throughout the city.
The work of the School Construction Authority, a city agency established in 1988 with an appropriation of $4.3 billion, these new buildings represent one of the most important public works programs in the country.
They ought to be illustrating an uplifting narrative about the city's ability to turn itself around.
Instead, the School Construction Authority found itself mired in yet another episode in the continuing saga of urban decrepitude, as the asbestos rained down on its parade.


A Little Dueling Music
When the world's two greatest tenors drew their swords on the Metropolitan Opera stage Monday and began to fight, it might have seemed business as usual.
Operas are full of tenors who, if not actually engaging in duels, often sing as if they are.
And these two -- Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti -- have provided much amusement for lovers of operatic badinage as the numbers of rivals able to artfully master the lyrical roles of the Italian repertory diminished.
Each has asserted that he was above any jealousy of the other but why did the other not share his high-minded view?


Some Exhaust Fans Are Tricky to Install
INSTALLING an exhaust fan in a poorly ventilated bathroom, laundry or kitchen can help prevent indoor condensation and problems like mildew, peeling paint and damaged woodwork.
Mounting a fan on an outside wall may be reasonably easy, but mounting one in a ceiling can be difficult unless the ceiling is accessible from an attic.
That is because ceiling fans require separate and sometimes lengthy ducts to carry exhaust air outside.
In all cases, electrical wiring has also to be installed.


BUTTONED UP
I was not surprised to read that David Dinkins balances his public civility with private fury ("Buttoned Up," by Todd S. Purdum, Sept. 12).
I've always understood the turbulence and anger beneath the Mayor's good manners.
He doesn't try to hide anything.
Rather, he seems to be saying, "My good behavior does not mean I'm pleased by all that discourages and disturbs me." This honesty of image from a politician is Mayor Dinkins's rarest grace.

Neighborhood Report: Park Slope; The Changing of the Guard
The huge, dilapidated brick armory off Seventh Avenue, which houses a women's shelter and National Guard unit, hardly looks worth fighting over.
But the armory is about to change hands -- from the state to the city -- and suddenly ideas for its use are coming thick and fast.
There are proposals to turn the building into a sports center, Police Department outpost, museum of Brooklyn military history, or a combined residential/ commercial structure that would be host to the occasional antique show.
Underlying all the proposals is the assumption that the women's shelter -- now financed by the state and long opposed by nearby residents -- will be gone.
But it seems unlikely that the city will move the women soon.


Story of My Life? Glad You Asked.
EVERY FALL THEY TURN UP: new television characters with new families, workplaces or both, hoping viewers will learn to love them.
But when networks may only give a show six episodes to live or die, viewers had better get acquainted fast.

Here's how six new sitcoms handled things.

Papal Encyclical Says Church Must Enforce Basic Morality
In an encyclical that Pope John Paul II clearly considers one of the most important of his papacy, the Roman Catholic leader asserts that there is a basic morality that transcends all eras and cultures and absolutely forbids certain actions.
The encyclical, named "Veritatis Splendor" ("The Splendor of Truth"), does little to spell out what these intrinsically evil acts are, although it does have an unmistakable subtext referring to sexual themes.


In a Bid for Casinos, Chicago Comes Up With Snake-Eyes
THE tune is familiar, but instead of the lyric "Chicago, Chicago, that toddlin' town . . . ," the advertisement radio listeners throughout the upper Midwest are hearing says, "Aurora, Aurora, that Hollywood town. . . ."
The advertisement aims to lure gamblers to the Hollywood Casino's two new river boats based in a middle-class suburb about an hour's drive west of here on the Fox River.
But the casino's snatching of Chicago's semi-official theme song is a grating reminder that the city's political and business leaders have thus far been powerless to win Chicago a piece of the action as casino gambling spreads throughout the Midwest.

Neighborhood Report: Lower Manhattan; 2 Buildings, 200 Years Old, To Be Rubble
Despite last-minute pleas from preservationists, demolition is to start this week on two of the city's oldest buildings.
City officials have hired a contractor to tear down the buildings, in the South Street Seaport Historic District, as safety hazards.
The landmark buildings at 227 and 229 Water Street, both of which are nearly two centuries old, were doomed by the bureaucratic, legal, political and fiscal stresses of modern New York.


Turkish Carpet
To the Editor: Reading your article on buying carpets in Istanbul (Aug. 22) has made me feel a little bit better about a most humiliating experience I had there just weeks ago.
I, who can negotiate for a used car with expertise and aplomb, became the owner of a Kilim rug I had no intention of purchasing.
I followed my guidebook's suggestion to visit a carpet store where they would teach me all about carpets and serve me apple tea.
In a half hour, I had acquired a carpet at a ridiculously high price.
And my husband, who was born in the Middle East and is a master of bargaining, stood by helplessly.

California Questioning Clinton's Promise of Aid
When President Clinton arrives in California on Sunday evening for his second visit in a month, he will find growing impatience and political rancor over his Administration's response to the battered local economy.
Increasingly, even strong backers of the President among business and political leaders here are saying he must act quickly to reverse California's deepening slide into recession or risk losing the most populous state's 54 electoral votes in 1996.


Norman Jaffee Made a Mark on the Landscape of the East End
NORMAN JAFFE viewed the landscape of Eastern Long Island with the passion of a true romantic.
He talked and wrote lovingly of the farms, of the dunes, of the surf and of the villages and the sky, but he spoke most of all about the light, about that marvelous light that he so aptly called "distilled yet brilliant" and compared to the light in a work by Turner or Vermeer.
Like all architects he worked wherever he could, but he wanted most of all to design buildings that fulfilled the promise of his passion and celebrated the qualities that he had led him many years ago to settle on the South Fork of Long Island.
Over the years of his practice in Bridgehampton he designed a wide range of houses and other kinds of buildings that, taken together, constitute a clear and powerful statement of belief in a place.


Argentines Vote Today, but Menem's Eye Is on '95
Two weeks ago, President Carlos Saul Menem was on the campaign trail in the northern Argentine province of Formosa when the helicopter he was flying in lost power and fell 15 feet to the ground.
It was the second time Mr.
Menem had faced tragedy in an air accident, but no one was hurt.
Outwardly he was serene.
"God doesn't want me to be killed," he said.
"He's saving me for '95."


Rods and Rituals in Scotland
IN the remote highland mountains north of Inverness flow a series of clear, peaty rivers whose names themselves stir vivid images of Scottish firth and strath: Brora, Cassley, Carron, Helmsdale, Naver and, a personal favorite, the lovely River Oykel.
Throughout most of the year, sportsmen from all over Britain line their banks engaged in that keenest of Scottish traditions, fishing for salmon on a colorful, hand-tied fly.
This is not the timid, intellectual angling of North American trout streams but the hearty, two-fisted manhandling of a 16-foot salmon rod along the craggy outcroppings and raging currents of Europe's finest spate rivers -- those that rise and fall rapidly depending upon local rainfall.
It is also not an enterprise for the faint of heart -- or wallet.
The rights to fish salmon in Scottish rivers are often owned separately from the surrounding land, and many rivers are virtually inaccessible because their salmon stocks are held by private individuals or syndicates who reserve fishing rights.
Those wishing to wet a line must book through a hotel with its own fishing rights or rent a private lodge through estate managers who specialize in fishing leases.
A week's fishing on one of the better salmon rivers can cost up to $1,500 a rod. (A rod means one person fishing a full day; two or three anglers often divide a rod, alternating with each other in the course of the day, and split the cost.) It's no surprise, then, that few anglers ever release a catch.
The salmon are earmarked for the table.


Russia's Next if Reaction Wins in Georgia
To the Editor:
On July 18, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, sent an appeal for support for democracy and peace in Georgia to me and fellow artists, Holocaust survivors and leaders of the Jewish and Muslim communities meeting in Britain at the "Wake Up World" concert.
He explained that reactionary forces outside Georgia were backing the secessionist Abkhazian attack on the city of Sukhumi, that a democratic Russia was vital for Georgia and that there could be no democratic Russia without peace and democracy in Georgia.


Typecast


Placing Ballparks in the Sweep of History
THE defining moment of childhood for Michael Gershman of Westport occurred the afternoon he first walked into Ebbets Field in Brooklyn.
He was 6 years old.
"It was my mother's birthday and my parents celebrated by going to Ebbets Field, which they did often," Mr.
Gershman recalled.
"I remember walking through the marble rotunda at the entrance, and how every sound echoed. To me, it was like Grand Central Station. And then I saw it -- the grass on the field. It was like seeing Oz."


Detailing The New Tax Law
AS the dust settles on the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, signed into law in August, the ramifications for homeowners are becoming clear.
Some changes will affect the elderly.
There are also important considerations for anyone in a high-income bracket and for people who own rental property.
And there are equally meaningful implications for shareholders in some New York City co-ops.
"Though the homeowner was not specifically addressed," said Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., and author of "Julian Block's Year-Round Tax Strategies," 1994 Edition (Prima Publishing, $14.95, available this month), "the changes will have meaning for quite a lot of people."


FISHING WITH PRESIDENTS
There is no mention of President Reagan in the article.
Is it possible that Reagan might have the same thing to say about fish that he once said about trees: "If you've seen one, you've seen them all"?

Scientists Put Age of Bones At 8,000 Years
Some 8,000 years ago, a mountain climber in the Colorado Rockies entered a cave at more than 10,000 feet, squeezing through low, narrow passages by the light of a flaming pine torch.
He was a robust man, about 5 foot 5 and 40 years old, possibly an ancestor of the Southern Ute Indians.
Something happened to him in the cave and there he died.
And there his skeletal remains were discovered last year by amateur cave explorers.
With results of a detailed analysis and radiocarbon dating, anthropologists announced yesterday that these were among the oldest human remains ever found in North America and were the earliest example anywhere of people using caves at such high elevations.

Ann Sexton and Paul Foye
Ann Sexton, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Sexton of Brooklyn, was married yesterday to Paul Christopher Foye, a son of Elizabeth Foye of New London, Conn., and the late William L. Foye.
The Rev.
Mark Lane performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at Watch Hill (R.I.) Chapel.
Mrs.
Foye, 27, is a history teacher at the Town School in San Francisco.
She and her husband graduated from Amherst College.
The bride received a master's degree in education from Brown University.
Her father is a lawyer in New York.


Harris Is Tops In Fifth Ave. Mile
Ron Harris, a Navy lieutenant stationed in Arlington, Va., won the men's invitation mile in 3 minutes 58 seconds and Lauren Gubicza, a former Fordham University star, took the women's mile in 4:37.9 yesterday in the 13th annual Fifth Avenue Mile.
The event was staged by the New York Road Runners Club.
Because it lacked a sponsor this year, the club was not able to offer stipends and large prizes to attract top runners.


NEW YORKERS &amp; CO.
I.B.M. Repair Workers Buy Their Brooklyn Plant
Workers at a Bedford-Stuyvesant I.B.M. repair plant bought the operation last week through an employee stock-ownership plan.
The 200 employees of the plant at 585 DeKalb Avenue paid $7 million, with the help of a bank loan.
I.B.M. announced in March that it would pull the plant's operations from New York, and offered to sell the factory to employees.
The new company, now called Advanced Technological Solutions, will continue to provide service for I.B.M. and other computer equipment.

You Read? Me Too!
"PICKUP" seems too rough-edged to describe what happens when one interested party meets another in the sedate confines of a bookstore.
Still, it happens, and not only at the new mega-Barnes &amp; Noble, which has gained a reputation as one of the Upper West Side's most flourishing social scenes.
Here's what some bookstore owners and employees had to say about the action at their shops.
ARGOSY BOOK STORE, 116 East 59th Street.
"There always seems to be a lot of flirting going on. We have this rack of sheet music from the 30's and 40's. You hear them talking about their favorite songs, and sometimes they start humming together." NAOMI HAMPLE, co-owner


Canada's U.S. Trade Experience Fuels Opposition to the New Pact
Debbie Annis came to the door of her gray two-story, vinyl-sided house on Ninth Avenue, in the shadow of the industrial skeletons on Mohawk Street that used to make tractors, electric blankets and woolens in Canada's manufacturing heartland.
Michael Smith, candidate on the political left for Brantford's parliamentary seat in the federal elections on Oct. 25, told her that his New Democratic Party, which has held the seat for 22 years, would jettison both the North American Free Trade Agreement and free trade with the United States.


Adirondacks
At almost any time of year, there is something deliciously isolated about the Adirondacks.
But it is especially so in the fall.
With no cities within a three-hour drive -- New York City is a five-hour drive away -- the leaf-peeping crowds here are smaller than in the Catskills or the White Mountains, and solitude is abundant on the innumerable mountain trails, streams and glassy lakes.
The Adirondacks are, after all, the largest park in America outside Alaska: a six-million-acre region larger than Massachusettes and as wild as many national parks in the West.
This is where Ralph Waldo Emerson, seeking haven from civilization, established his "philosopher's camp" on Follensby Pond.
And this is where a host of 19th-century millionaires with names like Whitney, Vanderbilt and Rockefeller built sprawling villas -- also called camps, no matter what their size -- around distant lakes, giving aristocratic cachet to the notion that remoteness somehow augmented the natural beauty of a place.


Corrections
A map on Sept. 12 with an article about the Montrealer, a train that links Montreal and Washington, included an erroneous section of the route, supplied by Amtrak.

PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SOHO A Cast of Characters Rolled Into One
Nora Cole, who played the character Sweet Anita more than 40 times in the Broadway show "Jelly's Last Jam," brings her one-woman show to SoHo before taking it to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington for the National Black Theater Festival.
In her multi-media play, "Olivia's Opus," Ms.
Cole plays both a young woman living in a small Southern town in the 1960's and a troop of characters who enter her life.
The play is based loosely on Ms.
Cole's childhood in Louisville, Ky.; she was "the fourth child, second girl and blackest of eight." She dances, sings and delivers monologues, against projections of news film and family photographs.
"Olivia's Opus," Castillo Cultural Center, 500 Greenwich Street, between Spring and Canal Streets; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 P.M., Sundays, 3 P.M., through Oct. 24; $20, $10 for children, students and the elderly; (212) 941-1234.
MIDTOWN Jazz Musicians With Style From All Over the Map
Marty Ehrlich and his Emergency Peace Ensemble and Don Byron, a jazz clarinetist, are to perform at Weill Recital Hall on Tuesday night under the auspices of the World Music Institute.
Both men are well-known figures on the contemporary improvisational American music scene.
Mr.
Byron has taken his clarinet to gigs where the music has ranged from rock-and-roll to waltzes, and he has played with everyone from klezmer musicians to Reggie Workman, the bassist, to classical pianists.
Mr.
Ehrlich is a saxophonist, clarinetist and composer who moves between European and American jazz movements, sometimes playing in both styles at once.
He has played throughout the United States and Europe with an array of composers' ensembles.

CHINATOWN/BROOKLYN HEIGHTS Anchoring a Bridge In the River and the Air
It is almost a metaphysical question: What holds up a bridge?
More specifically, what holds up the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges, which many New Yorkers rattle across while praying silently that the roadway not collapse beneath them?
On Saturday, the New York Transit Museum, in Brooklyn Heights, will explain how the bridges stay up.
Engineers from the city Department of Transportation explain the bridges' construction in a Saturday tour called "Bridge Game: Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges Close Up."
The tour begins at the Manhattan end of the Manhattan Bridge, where engineers will explain the function of the anchorages that hold the bridge firmly in the river.
After lunch (egg rolls and won ton soup; participants should take lunch money) the tour continues with the Williamsburg Bridge, where a new set of engineers will give the inside view.
Meet at the Manhattan end of the Manhattan Bridge; Oct. 9, 10 A.M. (tour ends at 2 P.M.); reservations required; (718) 330-5839.
FLUSHING White-Elephant Offerings At a Community Yard Sale
The Lutheran Church of the Redeemer will hold its twice-yearly yard sale with all the required trappings: old clothing, bicycles in various stages of ill repair, mismatched salt and pepper shakers.
About 100 families are expected to set up tables in the Rev.
Ernst R. Pflug's yard on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.
Early birds will have first pick of the many sets of dishes and board games and a wood-burning stove.
The pastor will also flip burgers to sell along with hot dogs, barbecued-beef sandwiches, sodas and coffee throughout the day.
Proceeds will go to church programs.
Yard sale; 185-01 50th Avenue, on the corner of Peck Avenue off Utopia Parkway; Oct. 9; free; (718) 357-5194.

Cracow
To the Editor: Jane Perlez gave an excellent description of the physical side of Cracow.
May I add a postscript.
The student residence halls of the Jagiellonian University were completed 60 years before Columbus arrived in the New World.
The Poles were a studious crowd; they competed with the best of Dresden and Leipzig for academic superiority.
And today that pride is seen and heard in Cracow as taxi drivers and hotel porters discuss Plato and Socrates.
The 11th edition of the Britannica describes it as "the intellectual center of Poland."


The Recycling Scorecard
The recycling race in Manhattan is too close to call.
Two weeks ago, Community Board 8 on the Upper East Side applauded the announcement that it had taken the lead in the recycling effort, with 24.3 percent of its residential waste recycled.
Then last week, the Borough President's office announced that Board 6 has unseated the champions, with 24.5 percent recycled.
Residential recycling became mandatory in New York City in 1989, with the process introduced progressively. (Regulations on commercial wste went into effect just last week.) To encourage recycling in Manhattan, the Borough President's office has turned it into a contest.


THE BULLY OF THE SKIES CRIES UNCLE
As a heavy user of airline services, with over 3 million frequent-traveler miles, of which more than 1.3 million accrued with American, I can state that Robert Crandall has built not only the finest airline in the United States but a world-class competitor.
He has done this despite the absurd situation whereby the Department of Transportation continues to allow bankrupt carriers to operate, thus eroding the franchise value of airlines like American that survived deregulation.

New Questions About Rhode Island Chief Justice
Chief Justice Thomas F. Fay, who faces impeachment proceedings and a criminal investigation of ethics violations, used official Supreme Court stationery to write letters to influence the disposition of speeding tickets issued to friends and relatives.
It is unclear whether the letters written by Chief Justice Fay to lower court officials on behalf of his brother-in-law, a former law clerk, the teen-age children of a friend, a gas station worker and other associates, had any effect on the outcomes of the cases.


Neighborhood Report: East Side; Diplomacy Rare on U.N. Park
It is not often that neighbors fight tooth and nail to prevent a local park's expansion, but when some residents near the United Nations heard several weeks ago that Dag Hammarskjold Plaza would grow, they countered with petitions, fliers and strident speeches in angry meetings.
For the last decade, the plaza has been a popular forum for demonstrators, a refuge for the homeless and a big headache to people who live and work in the area.
The last thing they wanted was to close a lane of traffic, expand the park -- and gain more space for unwanted visitors.


Gunfire Holds Poor Residents of Washington Hostage
One thing Rufus Johnson enjoyed most after retiring was walking about his apartment complex in the city's Greenway neighborhood, chatting with friends, taking the sun on a quiet corner and just being free to do anything, or nothing, after a lifetime of hard work as a tile setter.
Now all that has changed.


Washington Memo; Policy on Jobs Holds Trade Pact's Fate
Every year for at least the rest of the decade, more than two million Americans, most of them solidly middle class, are likely to lose their jobs because of fundamental changes in the world economy.
It is one of the most vexing social and political problems facing President Clinton, and its immediate symbol has become the North American Free Trade Agreement.


Neighborhood Report: Lower Manhattan; A High School That Tries to Tame Wayward Students
A high school that opened in TriBeCa last year worried some neighbors when they learned it was for truants and other troubled students from across the city.
Its name was hardly reassuring: Wildcat Academy.
"Naturally everybody was up in arms," said Ron Tabano, vice president of the academy.
"It sounded like we were running 'Jail House Rock' here." A front-page tabloid headline warned: "Schools to Weed Out Troublemakers."


Neighborhood Report: Bayside; To Catch A Car Thief
In coming weeks, Bayside residents who usually leave their cars behind during the workday will be placing police-issued stickers on their windows -- and hoping they will be pulled over.
The cars, that is.
It's part of a new, sweeping effort by the police to fight car theft throughout northeastern Queens.
Overall, 47,000 cars were stolen in the borough last year.
Of New York City's 10 worst neighborhoods for car theft, 8 are in Queens, and Bayside is one of them.


Death Benefits
LOOKING BACK OVER a career, I wonder whether perhaps the opportunity to come to terms with death was not a major fringe benefit of my calling.
I'm not among the few journalists who grew rich on news, nor among the fewer still who enjoy the public esteem accorded to entertainment stars.
But I wouldn't have traded journalism for another calling; our trade is nearly always fun, it is often enlightening and it is occasionally uplifting.
More to the point, journalism helps its practitioners accept the ubiquity of death, permitting us to enter the heathen equivalent of a state of grace: a gift not to be scorned.

The bridegroom is the son of Mr. and Mrs.

She graduated from Tufts University and received an M.B.A. from New York University.
Her father was a major in the United States Air Force.
Her stepfather is the managing director of the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.


Fallout From '92 Senate Primary Leaves Careers of 3 Democrats
It was, some say, a nasty case of political poisoning.
Last year, the Democratic Party saw three of its most seasoned, well-known politicians, Robert Abrams, Geraldine A. Ferraro and Elizabeth Holtzman, climb into the race for their party's nomination for a seat in the United States Senate.
The Democrats had Bill Clinton's coattails to cling to.
The Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, was believed to be vulnerable.
Party leaders could taste victory.
Then the ugly realities of New York politics turned up like the cancerous underbelly of a dead fish.
The campaigning turned muddy and the candidates turned on each other.
In time, three ambitions were dashed and, it has become clear, three careers derailed.
Instead of another Democrat in the Senate, the party lost three of its best hopes to vicious infighting, residual bitterness and combat fatigue. 'A Terrible Mistake'
"I think they made a terrible mistake in '92," Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo said of the combatants.
"And they have paid a terrible price."


Novels for the Computer
To the Editor:
Robert Coover's essay speaks of "the volumeless imagination" of hyperspace, a place full of hidden riches when the volumes, the books, are left behind.
Perhaps one of our greatest sources of inspiration over the centuries, the ancient Greek myths with their endless variations and reworkings, can be seen as early hypertexts.
Having originated in a "volumeless" world of oral tradition, they are precursors of hyperfiction.

Teachers Go to Class to Learn Economics
AS she has for the last seven years, Ellen Purcigliotti took a course in economics this summer.
Economics was not something the Lakeland High School social studies teacher knew much about, she said, before the state decided, in 1986, to require high school seniors to study the subject for one semester.
About 20 states have a state mandate to teach economics.
Like many other social studies teachers, Ms.
Purcigliotti herself had taken only one college course in economics 25 years before.
"It was a rude awakening," she said of her efforts to master some basic principles before trying to teach them.
"It was scary."

Movies That Push Buttons
This Christmas, along with home video games inspired by Hollywood movies -- "Cliffhanger," "Jurassic Park" -- there will be a new type of entertainment: video games that are Hollywood movies.
The most extravagant one is "Ground Zero Texas," an interactive film that cost more than $3 million and required an unprecedented collaboration between Silicon Valley programmers and veterans of movies like "Robocop."
Their product, to be introduced to the press on Tuesday and in stores next month, could be described as an action movie with a plot guided by the viewer, who watches on a television hooked to a Sega CD game machine.
It could also be described as a video game with real scenery and actors.
Its basic appeal was probably best summed up by Zack Kerns, aged 10, who went to the movie set in July to watch his father, Hubie Kerns Jr., play one of the extraterrestrial storm troopers invading a Texas border town.


Novels for the Computer
To the Editor:
It was a joy to see Robert Coover's front-page essay about hypertext ("Hyperfiction: Novels for the Computer," Aug. 29), a medium I have been extolling for at least four years to my friends, my agent, various New York publishers and anybody else who would listen; and a medium I am working in myself.


Supply-Side Economics Play New Jersey
IF she is elected Governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman says, she will join in the latest revival of supply-side economics, the theory preached by President Ronald Reagan and now proselytized by a small band of G.O.P.

But first she must beat Gov.

Now CUNY can boast of another achievement that will help ease the financial strain.

TALKING to Dr.
James Kuo and Dr.
Geraldine Gutierrez, it's easy to imagine the day when 100th wedding anniversaries or dinner with your great-great-great-grandmother will be ordinary occurrences.
Both Dr.
Kuo, 29, and Dr.
Gutierrez, 27, believe it's medically possible that people a generation or so from now will live to be 150 to 200 years old.
They even think that humans may eventually exist as long as redwood trees (thousands of years) and that the wedding vow, "till death do us part," will take on unfathomable gravity.

Kwitny's book "Acceptable Risks" incorrectly.
Dr.
Kwitny was president of the medical staff at St.

"Acceptable Risks" is not a novel; it is a nonfiction account of two men who fought to alter the Federal rules for drug testing to benefit AIDS patients.

Crime Down in '92 in New York and Nationwide
The number of crimes reported in New York State dropped by 6 percent last year, a trend mirrored in a nationwide decline in crime in 1992, state and Federal officials said yesterday.
The New York figures made 1992 the second year in a row when reported crime decreased in the state.
The largest drop occurred in New York City, which experienced a 7.8 percent decline.
Crime in the suburbs dropped by 6.2 percent, while upstate areas showed a decline of 1.7 percent.


Single-Minded Shopping
Actually, it doesn't look like a place where you can go back in time.
Once a manufacturing district, now a traffic-clogged side street, West 18th between 5th and 7th Avenues is a bleak, industrial-looking stretch.
But tucked between the double-parked trucks is a small colony of antiquarian bookstores, most of them new tenants.
For those who know and appreciate them they provide escape, a communal relief from the blare of bestsellers.
Here is the way books used to be, jumbled on shelves, cloth covers worn to thread by countless other hands.
They conjure a time when information was precious, when reading was learning.
A privilege.
These stores sell out-of print, rare and used books.
An acquired taste, perhaps.
Years ago, when the Strand was still on Fourth Avenue, surrounded by smaller competitors, that area proved a mecca for devotees of dust and Dostoevsky.
But after the Strand moved to its current location at Broadway and 12th Street, most of those stores disappeared.


A Pianist Echoes Prokofiev's Own Fire and Ice
ANYONE WHO ASSOCIATES BUDGET LABELS with scrappy performances and scrawny sound might be surprised to hear some recordings currently appearing on the Naxos label.
The Hong Kong-based concern has flooded stores with 350 titles, more than a few of which are competitive with major-label releases.
The conductor Alexander Rahbari, the Kodaly Quartet and the pianist Jeno Jando have produced estimable accounts of Shostakovich, Haydn and Liszt.
The label's strongest effort so far is a recording of the Prokofiev piano concertos with Kun Woo Paik, a little-known but cultishly admired Parisian pianist who gave a phenomenal recital last year at Alice Tully Hall (8.550565/ 6; two CD's).
Versatile and mercurial, Mr.
Paik tends to adapt his manner to the situation: he can blast through 20th-century Russian repertory mercilessly but draws a diaphanous wash of sound in the French Impressionists.


BASEBALL: 103 and Counting: N.L. West Goes Down to Wire; Giants Receive Needed Relief
Barry Bonds is not swinging for the fences here; he is swinging for the mountain ranges.
The Los Angeles Dodgers finally wised up this afternoon and intentionally walked him twice, but were done in by Dave Martinez.
Martinez -- a late substitute for the injured Willie McGee -- broke this tense game open with a two-run, seventh-inning double, later caught a swerving fly ball as Dodger Stadium fans tapped him on the shoulder, and the San Francisco Giants scraped together enough pitching to win, 5-3.


Bookworm


U.S.T.A. Green
To the Sports Editor:
George Vecsey ("For Two Weeks, the World Looks to New York," The Times, Sept. 10) believes the New York City Council Land Use Committee was wise to recommend approval of a United States Tennis Association expansion in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
The expansion would give the U.S.T.A. 42.2 acres of park land (about 10 percent of the park's usable land) for a 99-year period, and his support appears to be based upon a belief: "The Open is all about New York: noisy, expensive, arrogant, crowded, demanding, even a tad dangerous." He is correct.
The expansion is all about New York.


Strolling the Byways of Rome
Secret Walks in Rome is a new cultural association that offers more than 30 guided walks through the Eternal City.
Organized by English and American scholars and artists, the association has devised itineraries that include a tour of the Aventine Hill and a Talking Statues of Rome walk, which includes visits to the Mastro Pasquino statue, dating from the third century B.C., in the Piazza Pasquino, and the Marforio statue, dating from the first century A.D., on the Capitoline Hill.
There is also a wine-tasting tour in the old city center on Tuesday and Friday evenings.
The guided walks, which are conducted in English, average two to three hours; reservations are not required.
Visitors can call the organization to get information on where a particular walk will begin.
Groups are limited to 18 people.
The guides, who include art historians, actors and musicians, are well versed in anecdotes about the city.

The project will be run by the Village Alliance Business Improvement District, which was created (along with a similar district for 125th Street) by legislation that Mayor David N. Dinkins signed on Thursday.
In all, 31 neighborhoods now have such districts.
The Greenwich Village district and its program were proposed by the Village Alliance, a group formed in 1990 to fight deterioration in the neighborhood.


Planners Say That Early Retirees Might Add Billions in Health Costs
Clinton Administration health planners have begun to acknowledge that a politically important part of their plan could cost billions of dollars a year more than they anticipated.
The proposal would have the Government pay for most of the health insurance for early retirees, or those who retire before the age of 65, at which point they become eligible for Medicare.
The plan is intended to win support from large manufacturers saddled with skyrocketing health insurance bills.

On Wall Street, Some Crooks Get Off Easy
"SOME rob you with a six-gun, and some with a fountain pen." So wrote Woody Guthrie more than half a century ago.
But those who use the first technique are far more likely to wind up in prison than are their more refined fellow crooks.
Last week, in Federal court in Manhattan, a criminal trial began against a former Shearson broker.
The broker supposedly ripped off a customer through unauthorized trades, then used a forged document to cover up his activities.
A Shearson compliance officer is said to have been in on the scheme.


Story of My Life? Glad You Asked.
EVERY FALL THEY TURN UP: new television characters with new families, workplaces or both, hoping viewers will learn to love them.
But when networks may only give a show six episodes to live or die, viewers had better get acquainted fast.
Maybe that's why, when it comes to exposition, some stars are saying it all in one speech.
Here's how six new sitcoms handled things.
ANITA GATES "The Boys" (CBS)
Setting: A book signing.
A customer asks a writer, Doug Kirkfield (Chris Meloni), when his next book is coming out.


For an Analyst With a Bad Stock Pick, Truth Hurts
THE end of a Wall Street research report is usually where you learn that the analyst whose advice you have just trusted is riddled with conflicts.
But investors who plowed through a recent report by Volpe, Welty found a nice surprise: the analyst owned the stock he was trashing.
On Sept. 13, Charles H. Finnie issued a report on the Rasterops Corporation, a computer company.
An important product was late, and the company's outlook basically stank, Mr.
Finnie warned.
In the fine print at the end, the report revealed the author owned the stock.


SURFACING
PROPORTIONS Bigness: Or that which is outsized, like the enormous statues by Fernando Botero on Park Avenue between 54th and 61st streets; the new mega-Barneys; Conan O'Brien, who is 6-foot-4, and Big magazine, which covers avant-garde photography and design.
FASHION "Name" brand clothes: As in your name.
On T-shirts, button-downs, baseball caps and on and on, from the mail-order Perfect Shirt Company in Mount Pleasant, S.C.
LANGUAGE  "Capitalized fear": This ominous term, like many coined by academics, seems at once perfectly succinct and impossible to understand.
In a new anthology, "The Politics of Everyday Fear" (University of Minnesota Press), it refers to the mass production and consumption of fear in a capitalist society.
A publisher's note says that "the aim of the contributors" -- Charles Manson is one -- "is as much to enact fear as to analyze it."

Around Russia's Rim, a Fear of Events at the Center
BY the standards of wars that have already been fought or still rage -- on the periphery of the former Soviet empire, the standoff in Moscow has not been particularly impressive.
A few hundred gunmen inside, a few thousands troops outside, a few tussles with demonstrators, two policemen and a bystander killed in isolated incidents.
There has been nothing to compare, for example, with Georgia, where the unfortunate Eduard A. Shevardnadze, once Foreign Minister of the Soviet empire and now leader of his rapidly disintegrating native land -- barely escaped triumphant Abkhazian separatists in the blazing city of Sukhumi last week, only to have Georgian rebels led by the deposed president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, take another Black Sea port.

Green Shall Return, Like It or Not
Dallas Green took over as the manager of the Mets last May with a reputation as a tough-talking disciplinarian with an intimate, and intuitive, knowledge of the game of baseball.
He could teach as well as demoralize, lead as well as lambaste, New York was told.
There would definitely be order and perhaps success, Green said.
The Mets have gone 44-78 under Green.
It is .360 baseball, by any measure an embarrassing rate of failure.
However one assigns blame or rationalizes results, Green has had no positive impact on the fortunes of the Mets.
It is a blunt conclusion, an unforgiving one.
And Green, a man who likes to say, "All I deal with are facts," does not shy away from it.


Connecticut Q&amp;A: Capt. John H. Wadsworth; Exploring Changes in the Environment
CAPT.
JOHN H. WADSWORTH, simply Captain John to all who meet him, commands a fleet of four sport fishing and nature cruising vessels that are moored in the Niantic River close to his base of operations in Waterford at the river's edge.
His explorations of the Connecticut River, of the Sound and of the Atlantic's waters beyond Connecticut shores create a tale of the modern day explorer who returns to port with revelations of Connecticut's natural environment.

Miniature Village
To the Editor: I read Roger Cohen's article "The Glories of France in Miniature" (July 4) with interest as I had not heard of the park.
In comparing France Miniature with the Madurodam miniature town in the Hague, the Netherlands, Mr.
Cohen refers to Madurodam as "an imaginary Dutch town."
I visited there in 1992 and quote from the brochure: "a marvelous replica of a typical Dutch town with all its charm and bustle, the trains and ships . . . . a lovely city center dating from the Middle Ages with historical buildings, castles and palaces, a newly built district with modern architecture."


Florida Slayings Spur New York On Crime

The 'Flaying' Of a Bickfords
To the Editor:
Your Streetscapes column on July 18 titled "The Flaying of a Midtown East Art Deco Oddity" points up the almost casual loss of part of New York's visual history in the "flaying" of the facade of one of the former Bickfords restaurants.
It also mentions yet another instance of the casual loss of a different form of New York's visual history.

Hey Guys, What About Us?
To the Editor:
"Where the Dangers Aren't Make-Believe" (Sept. 26) illustrates how the "Good Ole Boys" network continues to control Hollywood.
Twenty-two men (no women) gathered to brave the Colorado.
The aim: male bonding, getting to know friends and enemies in the industry and nurturing personal relationships.
What about industry relationships and communication regardless of gender?


The Hopeful Future That Never Arrives
OVER the last several months, economic forecasters have arrived en masse at a somber conclusion: the American economy, with its daily reminders of hard times, won't show a noticeable improvement until next summer, at the very earliest, and perhaps much later.
Only last January, the economy seemed to be shaking off its funk.
"It seemed to many of us to have a nice rosy glow of health about it," said Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"And all of a sudden that nice rosy glow was gone, and I don't know why."
But as the forecasters are scaling back their optimism, they leave two issues unsettled.


On the Scent of Lawbreakers
AS a swarm of jet-lagged passengers from Alitalia Flight 600 out of Milan fought for their baggage recently at Kennedy International Airport in New York, one woman found herself with a new four-legged friend.
He was a peppy little beagle by the name of Bamboo, and he showed a keen professional interest in her carry-on bag.
"Excuse me, ma'am, any food in that bag?" asked Suzanne Koemm an Agriculture Department dog handler at the other end of Bamboo's green leash.
The passenger looked puzzled.
"Mangiare?" asked Ms.
Koemm, who is tall, slim and very serious about meat and vegetables when they happen to be in luggage.
"Frutta?" The passenger shrugged her shoulders sheepishly.
Ms.
Koemm began to search the bag.
Bamboo looked on smugly, already certain of the outcome.


Neighborhood Report: East New York; Hourly Rates Not Welcome
As construction workers put down the foundation for a two-story motel on Atlantic Avenue, residents are campaigning to have the work stopped.
The motel's hourly rates, they say, mean that it is sure to be frequented by prostitutes.
"East New York has other needs," said Sister Peggie Merritt, a member of East Brooklyn Congregations, a coalition of churches in the area.
"Our youths do not have a recreational center, our homeless do not have a facility for single-room occupancy and I would like to see things that would help build up our neighborhood in place of a motel."

Encore for 'Ice Cream' Team
They are in their 60's now.
"She Loves Me," their once-dismissed, once-lost musical, which they wrote 30 years ago, is alive again in a much-praised revival, and they can scarcely believe their good fortune.
A photographer asks them to pose for a picture: Joe Masteroff, librettist; Sheldon Harnick, lyricist, and Jerry Bock, composer.
Suddenly, the three of them burst into song.
Arms around one another, they sing "Vanilla Ice Cream" from the show, boyishly, exuberantly, proudly.
It is, in and of itself, a musical theater moment.
On Thursday "She Loves Me" will have its second opening in less than a year.
This time, it will be at the Brooks Atkinson on Broadway, where it is now in previews.
The Roundabout Theater Company production has transferred almost intact.
The love story is still bittersweet: it is the 1930's, and two clerks in a Budapest parfumerie who disliked each other on sight discover that they have been romantic pen pals all along.
Boyd Gaines is George and Diane Fratantoni, replacing Judy Kuhn, is Amalia, with Louis Zorich as Maraczek, the store's owner.

Wallenda Trumps Peteski In a Jamboree at the Wire
He missed by only a few inches, but he missed.
And so the great Peteski also missed the chance to extend his Canadian dominance south of the border yesterday when he ran third behind Wallenda and Saintly Prospector in a five-horse photo finish in the $750,000 Super Derby at Louisiana Downs.
As a result, five weeks before the Breeders' Cup series, the class of 3-year-old colts was still groping for a leader.
And just when it seemed ready to anoint Peteski, who swept the Triple Crown of Canada this past summer, the colt lost by a bob of the head.

Not Like Dad


Innocent Blood: Beyond Grief to Solutions
ARTHUR P. MASSEY 4th was buried two weeks ago in one of those services marked as much by what could have been as the loss of what was.
Mr.
Massey, described by his family as a Nintendo fanatic with an effervescent smile, never had any trouble with the police or anybody else.
He was just about to start his final term at Manhattan Comprehensive High School.
It was three little words that got Mr.
Massey in big trouble.
He said, "Yo, step aside" to a young man as he left a house party in the Bronx, and the man took offense.
Mr.
Massey ended up in a fistfight with him and another man.
Then one of them shot him dead.
He was 18 years old.


Some Exhaust Fans Are Tricky to Install
INSTALLING an exhaust fan in a poorly ventilated bathroom, laundry or kitchen can help prevent indoor condensation and problems like mildew, peeling paint and damaged woodwork.
Mounting a fan on an outside wall may be reasonably easy, but mounting one in a ceiling can be difficult unless the ceiling is accessible from an attic.
That is because ceiling fans require separate and sometimes lengthy ducts to carry exhaust air outside.
In all cases, electrical wiring has also to be installed.

An Earthquake Brings Calamity in India
An earthquake more severe than India has seen in half a century thundered through the predawn hours in a remote agricultural area of central India Thursday.
"Only when the rubble is removed will we know who died," said a local official.
Early estimates ranged from 10,000 deaths to perhaps 30,000.
Entire villages were reduced to rubble, even as some neighboring hamlets remained untouched.
In one town of 15,000 people, Killari, thousands of bodies were thought to be buried under collapsed homes.


Topics of The Times; Why G.I.'s Eat Big Olives
Someday in America's future, a member of Congress may stand up and demand to know why the Pentagon buys so many Jumbo, Colossal and Super Colossal ripe olives.
This self-appointed watchdog may observe that there are other, less expensive grades.
The Pentagon is wasting money again, he or she will say.
The explanation, according to The Associated Press, is on page 83 of the House Appropriations Committee's report on this year's military money bill.
It says, straight out, "The committee directs the Defense Procurement Agency to increase its purchases of Jumbo, Colossal and Super Colossal ripe olives in future solicitations for ripe olive purchases."

His private life should not be drawn into the public domain.

In the latest three months, the average domestic stock fund rose 5.3 percent, yielding a gain of 10.5 percent from January through September.


A Shift in Rules Guiding Growth Along the Water
WATERFRONT zoning is about to reach New York City's waterfront.
After decades in which shoreline development was guided by the same rules that cover the densest urban neighborhoods, the City Planning Commission has crafted zoning measures that are meant to open the land's edge.
Public space, including shoreline walkways with landscaped borders, would be required in certain large projects.
Building heights and widths would be limited, as would floor sizes.
Development rights could no longer be transferred upland from underwater property.
And suburban-style "big box" discount stores would be prohibited on piers.
"This is an unprecedented zoning text amendment that will, for the first time, put the waterfront into the Zoning Resolution," declared Richard L. Schaffer, the commission chairman, just before his colleagues voted in August to amend the resolution with 200 pages of new text.
What kind of precedent does the amendment offer?
Real estate interests maintain that the zoning would thoroughly dampen development by imposing too many extra costs on private builders.
Meanwhile, neighborhood leaders and environmental advocates say the zoning does not go far enough to preserve openness.
But the true test will not come until it is known exactly where along the 578-mile waterfront these new rules are to be applied -- and, of course, until the real-estate market recovers.
"The issue is, as we begin to come back in this town economically, does this inhibit the development of new sites on the waterfront?" asked Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, Democrat of Queens, who heads the Council's zoning and franchises subcommittee.
Tomorrow, the subcommittee is to hold its second hearing on the subject.
The zoning amendment would be considered next by the Land Use Committee and then, later this month, by the full Council.
Legal challenges are almost sure to follow.
Questions have already been raised about the constitutionality of the public access and underwater zoning rules, as they might be construed as an unlawful taking of property.
Critics have also faulted the overall process, saying that the effects of the zoning measures cannot be adequately evaluated before planners pinpoint the sites.
"WE'RE horrified that no environmental impact statement was deemed necessary and believe it may be actionable," said William P. Bowser of the West Village Committee, speaking to the zoning subcommittee.
Several community boards have also called for a full environmental assessment.
However, the counsel to the City Planning Department, William Valletta, told the subcommittee that the new zoning tools "have not landed anywhere" yet.
"To say 'these are the places and these are the impacts' is just not possible," he said.
In the Comprehensive Waterfront Plan of 1992, city planners generally identified some 20 areas, now zoned for manufacturing, where they believe residential redevelopment would be appropriate.
These include large parcels in Flushing and Long Island City, Queens, and the Red Hook and Mill Basin sections of Brooklyn.
About 5 percent of the manufacturing districts on the waterfront might be rezoned residentially, said Marilyn Mammano, the director of zoning and urban design for the City Planning Department.
Other new rules -- those governing piers and platforms, for example -- would be in force citywide.
Under the new zoning, builders of large projects in medium- to high-density residential and commercial districts would have to set aside 15 to 20 percent of their property for the public, including shoreline esplanades 20 to 25 feet wide, with landscaped "buffer" areas between the public and private space.
Currently, there is no such requirement, although negotiations with developers of waterfront projects like Brighton by the Sea in Brooklyn have yielded even greater amounts of land set aside for the public.
To get people out to the esplanades through private property, connections would have to be run between the shoreline and public streets or parks at intervals no greater than 600 feet.
These walkways would be 12 to 30 feet wide and would be counted toward the overall public space requirement.
A former counsel to the City Planning Department, Norman Marcus, has criticized this approach, in his role as chairman of the New York County Lawyers' Association urban development and land use committee.
"There is a kind of dominant reliance on privately owned property as the vehicle for providing public access," he said.
"After 30 years of conflict and quarreling over plazas and the rights of owners versus the rights of the public, it seemed silly to be expanding this difficulty to such an important goal as public access to the waterfront."
Instead, the lawyers' group proposed that open space and connections be provided through public streets and public parks that were officially mapped as such and, therefore, were the city's responsibility.
Mr.
McCaffrey also noted "a legal issue in terms of takings." The Fifth Amendment prohibits taking private property for public use without just compensation.
But Mr.
Valletta cited the common-law doctrine that lands between high and low tides -- known as "wet sand" -- were held by the state in trust for the public's use for fishing and navigation.
That trust was not extinguished by private ownership, he said.
"Since the public trust is still there," he said, "can we say that the equivalent of the public's historic right to go down to 'wet sand' is, in modern terms, the requirement for public access along a walkway? Our zoning is built on the idea that that's an acceptable and appropriate modern substitute."
On land, building sizes would be regulated several ways by the new zoning.
In medium- to high-density residential districts, there would be height limits ranging from 150 to 390 feet (roughly 15 to 40 stories).
The upper floors could not be wider than 100 feet parallel to the shoreline and floor sizes would have a limit of 7,000 to 8,100 square feet.
The result would be smaller towers and more of them on the site.
The Real Estate Board of New York complained that more towers mean more elevator cores, elevators, fire stairs and building entrances.
That means higher construction costs, less floor space for apartments and more security problems.
THERE would also be fewer apartments with water views, which command premiums up to 20 percent in rental buildings and up to 50 percent in co-ops or condominiums, the Real Estate Board said.
"Manhattan market values may make up for the inherent economic penalties," the board said.
"However, rezoned industrial areas in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island are not likely to command rents to offset these costs."
Mr.
Schaffer said, "We believe these are buildable buildings with a substantial amount of flexibility." Planners point to the broad, wall-like expanse of Shore Towers in Astoria, Queens, as an example of what they do not want to happen again.
Something else they do not want to see again is a proposal like Trump City on the Hudson River, which would have used development rights from under water to generate up to 4.5 million square feet of floor space, for a total of 15.33 million square feet. (The project was later scaled down to 8.3 million square feet and renamed Riverside South.)
Trump City would have taken advantage of the fact that property between the bulkhead and pierhead lines has been recognized as part of the zoning lot.
Development rights from that property -- obviously unusable under water -- can be transferred to sites on land or piers, yielding much more building bulk than would ordinarily be permitted.
The new zoning would end the use of underwater property, beyond the bulkhead line, in the calculation of allowable density.
This, too, might be challenged as a taking.
The Real Estate Board has said the new rule "raises serious constitutional issues."
Mr.
Valletta, however, said the granting of development rights from underwater property was not a matter of law but rather an interpretation of the Zoning Resolution by the Buildings Department -- "a kind of bonus."
"We gave a little extra and we can clearly take it away," he said, "because the constitution protects property rights and this is not a property right."
On existing piers, building sizes would be strictly limited, unless a developer received a special permit.
As a matter of right, structures less than 200 feet long could rise only 40 feet.
Longer, shed-like buildings could rise only 30 feet.
And public space would be required all along the pier.
Developers could seek a special permit to build much larger buildings on piers.
"But given that the as-of-right standard has been significantly reduced," Ms.
Mammano said, "you have something to measure it against." It would seem unlikely, for instance, that planners would approve a structure 10 times higher than the stated limit.
Also on piers, planners have imposed a limit of 20,000 square feet on certain kinds of stores, including "warehouses that provide accessory retail sales areas."
"YOU couldn't have a 100,000- or 200,000-square-foot Rickel's," Ms.
Mammano told the subcommittee at its first hearing.
"Going to a Home Depot and loading up on two-by-four's is not a waterfront experience."
Mr.
McCaffrey asked, "How is that different from going to the South Street Seaport and shopping at Banana Republic?"
"There are no windows, there is no life on the street," Ms.
Mammano replied.
"At the South Street Seaport, when you go to Banana Republic, you don't just shop there. You have a drink. You sit down. You meander."
New piers and platforms are limited to parks, playgrounds or what planners call "water-dependent" uses, including docks, boatels, boat yards, launches, heliports, seaplane bases, sewage-disposal plants and marine-transfer stations for garbage.
By special permit, new piers can be converted to "waterfront-enhancing" uses like hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, arenas, boat showrooms, skating rinks, tennis courts and golf courses -- provided that the original use had ended at least two years earlier.
While critics suspect that this is a loophole through which commercial development can be slipped on to new piers, Ms.
Mammano said: "Who is going to go out and get a Corps of Engineers permit, financing for a water-dependent use, open it, close it for two years, then come in for a special permit? And all you can get is a waterfront-enhancing use, which does not include residential or offices. We thought the downside risk was minimal."
However, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan told the subcommittee, through an aide, that she opposed any rules that would "give city sanction to as-of-right development of new piers or platforms" or "offer a special permit for converting these uses to other more questionable uses."
The vice president of the New York City Audubon Society, Leslie T. Sharpe, urged the city to allow new piers only where there was no practicable alternative.
"Activities that are 'enhanced' by a water-based location, such as an ice-skating rink and a golf driving range are not a proper use of the waterfront," she told the subcommittee.

But if they overplayed their hand by publicly discussing plans for a new stadium in mid-Manhattan, it was because they believed the risk was too great to do otherwise.

I feel these ideas are really not theirs but of their charismatic leader's impressed on them.

On the city's outskirts, apartment buildings with gables and portals are painted in cheerful pastels instead of the old Communist gray.

Her grandfather Lacy Donnell Wharton was an editor of The Reader's Digest.


A Romp for Princeton As Elias Leads Way
Having been beaten by Holy Cross in their last three meetings, Princeton had a score to settle with the Crusaders today.
And the Tigers did so with a vengeance, scoring on their first six possessions en route to a 38-0 rout before a crowd of 7,520 at Palmer Stadium.
The victory was particularly satisfying for Princeton (3-0) since it was actually the Tigers' first triumph over Holy Cross (1-3) since 1916.
In the subsequent 72 years, the teams did not play.
And since 1988, when the series resumed, it was all Holy Cross.
Until today.

Is There Logic to 'Legalaid'?
To the Editor:
The article suggests that bar admission should be linked to an agreement to provide services to the poor without any compensation.
It tries to link this requirement to what is being imposed on doctors but makes some serious errors in fact.


Woodstock Magic Lies in the Field
To the Editor:
I read with interest "The Woodstock War" (Sept. 5).
However, there is a piece of the story missing.
More than 24 years after the music festival, the site remains the same!
Not commercialized, not spoiled and not destroyed by greedy people.
The promoters of the upcoming anniversary festivals can move them to Saugerties or the actual town of Woodstock or any place they choose and they can call it what they like, but they cannot take the magic out of the fields of Bethel!


BASEBALL: 103 and Counting: N.L. West Goes Down to Wire; Braves, Pendleton Trounce Rockies
The Atlanta Braves have known for some time now that it would probably take at least 100 victories to win the National League West.
What they still do not know is if at the end of the 162-game regular season, and after perhaps as many as 104 victories, they will indeed be division champions.
For Atlanta, winner of its 103d victory today in a lopsided 10-1 belting of the Colorado Rockies, is but one of two teams in the National League West with that amazing victory total.
The Braves' equally determined rival, the San Francisco Giants, also won their 103d game today, defeating the Dodgers, 5-3, in Los Angeles.

In eight years in Congress, eight as Brooklyn District Attorney, and two failed Senate campaigns, she was known for fierce integrity, withering intelligence and energy to carry her where charm could not.

He died after a long illness, said his lawyer, Richard Cunningham.

Riot in Moscow Amid New Calls For Compromise
Militant supporters of the Parliament, which has been banned by President Boris N. Yeltsin, clashed with riot police officers in the center of Moscow today while envoys of the warring sides bargained late into the night over conditions for ending their armed standoff at the Parliament building.
Reports from the talks, held under the auspices of the Russian Orthodox Patriarch at his headquarters in the Danilov Monastery, were sketchy.
But a senior Church official said an agreement calling for a mutual stand-down could be reached soon between representatives of Mr.
Yeltsin and the Parliament.

Foreign Policy, Left Unclear
What is the Clinton Administration really trying to tell the American people about its foreign policy intentions?
First, a series of high-profile speeches dutifully affirms the importance of continued U.S. leadership and international engagement.
Then a series of real-world policy decisions signals an unmistakable scaling back of Washington's commitments to participate in actual international peacekeeping operations, starting with Somalia and Bosnia.

It was only after finishing the exam, at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where she was majoring in archeology, that Ms. de Guardiola retrieved the letter, which bore wonderful news.

How-to Books On Living Well And Being Good

A Disease Called 'The Great Imitator'
LYME disease was named after the Connecticut town where it was identified in 1975, said Dr.
Leonard H. Sigal, the chief of the division of rheumatology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick.
But, he said, Lyme disease had already been known in Europe for more than 100 years.
It is now being diagnosed in the United States with more than 90 percent of the reported cases occurring in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota.


THE LOOK OF THE NINETIES
Get real.

Is ESPN2 Reaching for the Young or Just Reaching Too Far?
Warning: All opinions, observations and potentially nitpicky, snide comments in this article about Friday's debut of ESPN2 are suspect.
The 36-year-old author is two years too old to share the tastes and attention span of ESPN2's target demographic of men and women 18 to 34.
IS SILENCE HIP? -- From launch at 7:30 P.M. to 7:46, all is silent on SportsNight, the Friday-Saturday-Sunday (and soon to be Monday) 7:30-10:30 show.
Neither ESPN nor my cable company take the blame.
Is this silence some kind of irreverent, teenage "raving" thing?

You Can Never Be Too Thin, or Bulb-Rich
OCTOBER is the best time to plant bulbs.
The ground is soft from the fall rains, and the air is cool enough for a flannel shirt.
You go out and plant a hundred bulbs of Muscari botryoides -- the species grape hyacinth, which smells like plums -- under the magnolia tree.
You picture how beautiful that carpet of cobalt blue will look beneath the big pinky-white saucers of the magnolia.
But wait.
Maybe the muscari, which bloom in early April, will be too early for the saucer magnolia.
You try to remember just when the magnolia bloomed, and can't.

A New Season Promises Adventure
IT looks like the Connecticut theater season started before it started, and with a thunderclap.
One hopes that the boldness and success of two early openers provided a foretaste of thrilling things and inspired in theatergoers a sense of discovery.
Could the season have had a grander inauguration than "The Madness of George III"?
That the Rich Forum in Stamford sold standing room tickets during the two-week American premiere of a witty English play with a great performance by Nigel Hawthorne shows that people go for class.


After 3 Mini-Tests, Giants Have a Major One

Does the new health-care plan provide coverage for the eyes of Bucs fans who have to watch that monstrosity?


First Person; A Feminism That Speaks For Itself
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee last week to testify about the health care plan she drafted, saying she was there as "a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, a woman." Feminist was not a term she used, but that hasn't kept her from becoming feminism's first mainstream icon: a powerful, smart woman with mass-market appeal.
She was, of course, a powerful, smart woman a year ago.
Back then, her husband's Presidential campaign advisers seemed worried that these attributes had limited appeal.
But after a week in which Mrs.
Clinton appeared before one Congressional committee after another, delivering carefully articulated answers to vexing questions about the cost and practice of medicine, even Congressional Republicans -- whose party convention last year stigmatized her as a radical, antifamily feminist -- complimented her on her grasp of the debate and her service to the country.


Dykstra Is Like a Modern Miracle
Lenny Dykstra, who would be a logical choice for the National League most valuable player award if Barry Bonds were not playing Superman, is on the verge of accomplishing one of the rarest feats in baseball history.
He is about to become the first player in 30 years, the first National League player in 35 years and only the fifth player ever to lead a league in hits and walks.
Dykstra, entering yesterday's games, had 194 hits to 190 for Mark Grace of Chicago and 127 walks to 123 for Bonds.
He thus was poised to join two predecessors in the Philadelphia outfield, Richie Ashburn (1958) and Billy Hamilton (1891), plus Carl Yastrzemski of Boston (1963) and Rogers Hornsby of St.
Louis (1924).


Timman Goes Astray On His Home Turf
THE first game of the International Chess Federation championship match on Sept. 6 in Zwolle, the Netherlands, was a calamity for the grandmaster Jan Timman.
Although he played an opening variation that he invented five years ago, he quickly went astray.
He then put up a struggle only to commit more errors in an end game and hand a victory to Anatoly Karpov of Russia, the former titleholder.

Neighborhood Report: Washington Heights; From Armory to Homeless Shelter to Social Center
For more than a decade it has been a blot on the map, a symbol of the crisis of homelessness and the dangers of large, uncontrolled shelters.
But after more than a year of negotiations, the Fort Washington Armory will soon become another type of model -- one for providing housing and community services on city property.
The armory, on Fort Washington Avenue between 168th and 169th Streets, housed as many as 1,200 homeless men in the late 1980's.
It will be converted into a community center, with a tower built on its west end that will accommodate 200 formerly homeless and low- and middle-income families, according to plans recently announced by Mayor David N. Dinkins.

She graduated from Georgetown University.
Her father is a vice president of J. P. Morgan &amp; Company in New York.


Buttoning Every Vote
IT'S the latest twist on an old tradition: the custom-tailored campaign button.
In this year's mayoral race, it may be the ultimate emblem of the retail politics of post-melting-pot New York.
While campaigns are increasingly waged with connect-the-dot attacks in the pixels of a television screen, these laminated lapel pins are a humble but pointed reminder that every vote counts.
They also seem to say a lot about how divided politicians think the city's voters are, even as they go about trying to unite them behind their candidacies.
They come in five or six tongues, from "MIRA! Yo Estoy Con DINKINS" ("Look! I'm With Dinkins") to "Rudy Giuliani for Mayor" in Russian, Romanian and Greek.
They're in all colors: green, orange and white for the Irish; red, black and yellow for the Germans; red, green and white for the Italians.
Depending on the target audience, others bear the pink triangle for gay voters, the Star of David, the Puerto Rican flag or the biological symbol for woman.


Elizabeth Stamato, John B. Giessner

How Free Can Teachers' Speech Be?
A PHYSICS teacher at the Bronx High School of Science may lose his job because of his activities in an organization for pedophiles, which school district officials say make him unfit to teach.
But more is at stake than the career of Peter Melzer, a leader of the North American Man-Boy Love Association.
The organization is described by a spokesman as a "self-help group for pedophiles tormented by societal conditions" who want to "educate the public at large to the benevolent nature of relationships between men and boys."

China's Fix for Runaway Economy Is Falling Short
Just a few weeks after China's economic czar, Zhu Rongji, opened his 16-point austerity program this summer, Asian and Western financiers were congratulating him on his early success in reining in China's runaway economy.
He had reimposed some central authority over China's bounding expansion by canceling scores of ill-conceived projects to pave over rice paddies with casinos and office towers and by calling in loans that were feeding a speculative frenzy in everything from condos to jetliners.


Israel's Right Wing in the Wilderness
FROM his spare seventh-floor office here, Ariel Sharon can see a thin gray line in the distance that is the Mediterranean.
"The way things are going," the old general and Likud Party elder said, grimly joking, "I'm afraid that's where the Jews of Israel will be pushed."
Actually, if any back is to the sea, it is that of Israel's right wing, dominated by Likud and its young American-style leader, Benjamin Netanyahu.
The right is convinced that Israel has put itself in mortal peril by accepting the legitimacy of the Palestine Liberation Organization and agreeing to Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
But it has yet to figure out how to respond effectively to this dramatic new situation, which caught it unawares and underlined how out of touch it is despite having run the Government for 15 years, until displaced last year by the Labor Party and its leader, Yitzhak Rabin.


Allow Travel to Cuba
To the Editor:
"Dial 1-800-Fidel" by Diana Lady Dougan (Op-Ed, Sept. 25) hails the United States lifting of restrictions on phone service to Cuba.
But more important than phone-to-phone ties are people-to-people ties.
The United States Government still retains restrictions on travel to Cuba, severely limiting dialogue with the Cuban people and also curtailing the civil rights of United States citizens.
The United States is the only Western democracy that makes travel a crime!


Video Chip to Be Introduced
Laying a crucial chip along the digital highway, C-Cube Microsystems of Palo Alto, Calif., will introduce a microprocessor on Monday that can compress and decompress digital video in real time.
Such a chip can compress a videotape or a broadcast as it is played; currently, it takes up to 10 hours to compress a 2-hour movie.
Real-time compression and decompression are important to the delivery of 500-channel cable systems, which have been proposed by companies like Tele-Communications Inc.
In addition, such technology will enable delivery of video on demand, interactive media and other services not yet widely available.

I.B.M. is introducing a family of powerful personal computers today that are intended for the home market and equipped with features ranging from ultra-fast chips to CD-ROM players in some models.

India Doesn't Have to Go the Way of Yugoslavia
To the Editor:
"Hindu Rage Against Muslims Transforming Indian Politics" (front page, Sept. 17) appears just at a time when a partition plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the news.
I cannot help read in the juxtaposition warnings and portents and evils imminent.
The more so since independent India was loosely modeled on the lines of the former Yugoslavia -- as a peaceful socialist mosaic of religions and ethnic identities.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Naked bodies. Oh-my-goodness words. They attract plenty of attention, but can they hold it?
IN a new advertisement for Guess jeans, a shirtless man lies near a woman wearing panties and an open blouse that just covers her breasts.
Calvin Klein presents a couple on the beach in horizontal embrace to sell his Escape perfume and a woman naked from head to thigh on a couch to sell Obsession for men.
A clothing store called Louis, Boston uses three fashionably dressed young people standing behind the words, "Wasp. Jew. Gay."
As if life is not confrontational enough, a growing number of print advertisements are slapping people across their sensitivities.
So much skin!
And what, pray tell, might this line from a Joop jeans advertisement mean?
"In the uterus of love, we are all blind cavefish." Forget what it means.
More jarring is the word "uterus" in capital letters three-eighths of an inch high helping to sell blue jeans.


NORTHEAST DIVISION
Winning the Stanley Cup earned the Montreal Canadiens only grudging respect.
Aside from goalie Patrick Roy, they have little in the way of marquee names, unless you count Jacques Demers, the coach.
With Pittsburgh transferring to this division -- the former Adams -- the competition will be even tougher.
Leadership wears well on Kirk Muller, in the prime of his career.
Fellow Montreal forwards John LeClair, Vincent Damphousse and Gilbert Dionne may be approaching their best years and Brian Bellows still has some scoring punch left.
A young defense anchored by Mathieu Schneider will probably get better.
Mike Keane, a right wing, is an inspiring role player but, like most of his teammates, he is of average size.
For this haughty organization and its demanding fans, anything less than major success will give Demers more chest pains.

RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Chang Proves He Is a Man for All Seasons  Michael Chang won his fourth singles title of the year, beating Jonas Svensson of Sweden, 6-0, 6-4, in the Malaysia Salem Open championship in Kuala Lumpur.
It was the first time in Chang's career that he has won four singles tournaments in a year.
He previously won at Jakarta, Indonesia, in January, Osaka, Japan, in March and Cincinnati in August.
He was seeded second and is ranked eighth in the world.
Against Svensson, Chang faced little resistance in the first set, breaking the Swede three times in winning the set in 31 minutes.
In the second set, Svensson came back strong after Chang broke his serve in the first game.
They were tied, 4-4, after Svensson broke Chang in the sixth game.
But Svensson failed to hold his serve in the ninth game, and Chang won the set in 66 minutes.

A Bit Too Little, A Tad Too Early For the Giants
The Giants will look at the game film from this one and wince.
Their defense couldn't have played better.
It held the Buffalo Bills' offense to just one field goal entering the fourth quarter, but in the end the Giants found themselves on the wrong side of the score.
Should have, would have, could have.
All those things apply to this game for the Giants, but only the 17-14 loss really matters.
If anything, the 3-1 Giants probably proved they belong in the echelon of good teams.
Entering this game there were questions about the legitimacy of their 3-0 record because the caliber of some of the teams they had played wasn't exceptionally high.
But by holding Buffalo -- one of the best home teams in the National Football League -- to just one offensive touchdown and generally dominating the game from start to finish, the Giants proved that their 3-0 record was no fluke.

I.R.A. Welcomes Ulster Plan; Describes It as Basis for Peace
In a move expected to add impetus to a new plan for peace in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republican Army said today that it welcomed the proposal because "it could provide the basis for peace."

Review/Film Festival; 'The Night,' a Memoir of Growing Up in Syria
Mohammed Malas's difficult autobiographical film "The Night" has the distinction of being the first Syrian movie to appear in the New York Film Festival.
Set in the late 1930's and 40's, it portrays a rustic tribal society struggling to become a nation without any compelling nationalistic agenda other than the expulsion of enemies who range from European colonials to Zionist settlers in Palestine.
Until Syria achieved independence in 1946, the country was a mandated territory administered by France under a League of Nations agreement.
After the fall of the Vichy Government at the end of World War II, the British arrived and installed a civilian regime that was quickly overthrown by the first in a succession of unstable military governments.
Unless you have some knowledge of this period of Middle Eastern history, the film, whose time sense is abrupt and difficult to follow, is almost impenetrable.

Salinas Offers Plan to Aid Mexican Economy
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today announced a complex plan to raise Mexican wages and bolster the nation's economy.
His proposals address United States concerns about American jobs displaced by cheap Mexican labor and lay the groundwork for the 1994 presidential election campaign.
At a ceremony in Los Pinos, the Mexican White House, Mr.
Salinas said the complex package of economic measures would allow Mexico to "harvest and use the advantages" it earned in five years of fiscal discipline.

President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered tanks and armored personnel carriers early today to oust armed rebels from their heavily fortified Parliament center, and heavy gunfire echoed through the city as the final showdown opened between the President and his unyielding Communist and nationalist foes.

SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW: Washington; Clinton, Reaffirming Support for Yeltsin, Blames Rutskoi's Faction for the Violence
President Clinton today blamed opponents of Boris N. Yeltsin for the violence in Moscow and vowed that the United States would not waver in its backing for the Russian President as he sought to restore order.
A senior American official described events in Moscow as "a very, very serious crisis." But as the 13-day-old standoff lurched into the streets, Mr.
Clinton made clear he had no intention of lessening his support for Mr.

Review/Television; Methods of Travel For the Trip to the Grave
"Death: The Trip of a Lifetime" is an antic travelogue with pretensions.
The first hour of this four-hour documentary offers cremations in India, fancy coffins in Ghana, glimpses of the Night of the Dead in Mexico, fourth-graders talking about death in a Seattle school, clips from horror movies and other sights.
Whether this sort of tour amounts to something more than colorful pictures from here and there depends on what the guide brings to it.
Lamentably, Greg Palmer, described in the press release as "award-winning broadcaster, playwright and film maker," seems unable to decide what if anything he has in mind besides playing to the camera.

Review/Opera; Season Premiere Of 'Tosca' At the Met
"Tosca" returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday afternoon.
Puccini's larger-and-simpler-than-life melodrama finds a comfortable home in this bigger-than-necessary opera house.
And indeed, any successful "Tosca" is a matter of scale, a process by which day-to-day human responses are escalated to dimensions far beyond the ordinary.
The extraordinary success of Saturday's performance lay largely in how well these proportions were calibrated, how compellingly true unrealistic human behavior set in unrealistic surroundings could be made to seem.
Singing as well as I have heard him sing, Placido Domingo found grandeur with impregnable dignity.
His Cavaradossi occupied fully the space this production provides it.
Maria Guleghina in the title role had the necessary physical glamour and emotional extravagance.
The voice has reserves of power and a dark glow.
Only the upper notes were tested; one heard a few signs of weariness by Act III.

Political Memo; Senators Find Scandal's Tar Leaves Indelible Stain
Nearly three years ago, when five Senators were consumed by one of the most potent financial scandals to hit Capitol Hill, conventional wisdom held that the luckiest of the bunch were Senators Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona.
The other three had re-election campaigns looming in 1992.
Mr.
Riegle and Mr.
DeConcini, both Democrats, would not face the voters again until 1994 -- plenty of time for political wounds to heal.


Unions Gird for War Over Trade Pact
Leaders of American labor unions, who are here to set goals for the next two years, say that nothing -- not health care, not the long erosion of blue-collar wages, not even the Reagan and Bush Presidencies -- has stirred worker passions as has the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement.
The prospect of deregulated trade with Mexico so angers some unions that they are vowing to take the unusual step of making the vote of a member of Congress on the agreement a single-issue test of loyalty to labor.
The unions say they will use their money and skills to drive from office those who support the agreement.

Books of The Times; Guilty Consciences in Old Vienna
Henry James's Midnight Song  By Carol De Chellis Hill
Illustrated. 445 pages. Poseidon Press. $23.
Beneath everything else in Carol De Chellis Hill's extravagantly imagined new novel, "Henry James's Midnight Song," there lies an old-fashioned murder mystery.
In turn-of-the-century Vienna, someone has been murdering women, seemingly at random, dismembering their corpses, hiding the parts around the city and sending notes to the police: "Where oh where is Gertrude Van de Vere? Her hand is in the sandbox and her toes are over there." Special Inspector Maurice Cheval LeBlanc has been called back from a vacation in Paris to investigate the crimes.


SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW: The Background; Amid Confusion, Russians Keep Heads Down
For months now, as Moscow's political warriors have been locked in an increasingly vicious battle for power, each side has accused the other of pushing the country to civil war.
Until Sunday, the threat always seemed idle, even in the days since President Boris N. Yeltsin disbanded Parliament and ringed its headquarters with troops.
Like a deadly delayed reaction, the violence that swept Moscow on Sunday had been a long time in building.
But even as armed mobs were breaking police lines, storming government buildings, and brandishing the red hammer-and-sickle, news of what was happening spread slowly.


PACIFIC DIVISION
So Wayne Gretzky wasn't serious about retiring after all.
And his back is healthy.
And he turns 33 years old in January.
So how much longer will he play?
Probably longer than Jari Kurri, who is already 33 and fading, and longer than Tomas Sandstrom, who just turned 29 but seems to get seriously injured at least once a year.
Strange as it sounds, Los Angeles is one Stanley Cup finalist that might be no better than a .500 team that struggles to make the playoffs in the league's worst division.
On the positive side, the aging of key forwards is balanced by a good, young defense, with Rob Blake now supported by Darryl Sydor and Aleksei Zhitnik.

Market Place; For Rally's shareholders, the disappointments keep coming.
RALLY'S HAMBURGERS INC. has long been known as America's fastest growing restaurant chain.
But last week, its shareholders probably knew it better as one of America's worst investments.
Shares in the chain of double-drive-through restaurants collapsed more than 20 percent on Thursday, falling as much as $3.125, before eventually closing at $11.875 in over-the-counter trading.
The tumble continued on Friday, with Rally's shares losing another 87.5 cents, closing at $11 a share, just pennies above the company's 52-week low.


CENTRAL DIVISION
Almost 20,000 customers a game aren't enough for the Detroit Red Wings.
Their owner, Mike Ilitch, wants a bigger arena and a Stanley Cup championship while Steve Yzerman is still in his prime.
With the cash flow from his fan base, Ilitch is willing and able to hire high-salaried role players like Paul Coffey and a high-salaried coach like Scotty Bowman, if only to look at their championship rings.
Despite a wealth of talent, the Wings always seem to stumble, and last season's first-round exit from the playoffs was most embarrassing.
Part of the blame goes to the goalie, Tim Cheveldae, whose team loses its poise and confidence too easily whenever he falters.
Bowman, in Pittsburgh last spring, showed that even one of the greats in league history can be outcoached, the way he was by Al Arbour of the Islanders.
For all his talent and a strong supporting cast, Yzerman needs a championship to move, in some eyes, from second to first tier among superstar centers, alongside Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.

India Doesn't Have to Go the Way of Yugoslavia; For All, a State of Mind
To the Editor:
"Hindu Rage Against Muslims Transforming Indian Politics" (front page, Sept. 17) is not as distressing as it may seem.
While some of the fringe Hindu extremist groups, such as the Shiv Sena and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh can pose a threat to the security of Muslims in India, the Bharatiya Janata Party does not pose such a threat.
Bharatiya Janata may be a Hindu party, but most of the moderate leaders in the party such as L. K. Advani, A. B. Vajpayee, M. R. Malkani and Jaswant Singh, subscribe to a Hindu philosophy that is basically secular and tolerant.

The wide range of estimates for how much nonfarm payroll jobs increased last month signal that the bond market could be surprised by the report due on Friday from the Labor Department.

And the low-end estimates of about 75,000 would seem to assure that growth is still sluggish.

S.I. Paper Calls For Voting Yes On Secession

New Health Plan, Old Abortion Fight
Helen Alvare, an employee of the United States Catholic Conference, which has supported universal health care coverage since 1919, is an unlikely enemy of President Clinton's health care plan.
Yet she has taken to the streets to organize opposition for one reason: abortion.
The Clinton plan has only a single clause that calls for "pregnancy-related services," but its meaning has prompted just the emotional stampede the Administration hoped to avoid, and it has made enemies of people like Mrs.
Alvare who otherwise would have counted themselves among the plan's staunchest supporters.

Changing at the Top: London's Musical Life Has Some New Leaders
This is a city of tradition and continuity, but the autumn of 1993 is shaping up as a time of sometimes smooth, occasionally bumpy transition in London's classical-music life.
There is an entirely new administrative and artistic team at the English National Opera; a new opera director at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, and new "principals," or directors, at both the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music.
The English National Opera is London's domestic company, devoted to British operas and artists and to foreign operas sung in English.
During the go-go 1980's, the E.N.O., as it is known, rode high, buoyed by a newly affluent young public and critically acclaimed for its innovative stagings.
The company was run by Peter Jonas as general director, Mark Elder as music director and David Pountney as director of productions, and a triumphant troika they made.

Essay; Destroying Confidence
Last week, as a U.S.-sponsored "donors conference" pledged billions to develop Gaza and the West Bank, Arab states and the P.L.O. rejected the Clinton plea to end the boycott designed to stunt the growth of Israel.
The Arab economic war not only denies Arab markets to Israelis, but -- in its secondary boycott -- has effectively frightened all but a tiny percentage of the world's thousand largest companies from investing or locating in Israel.
And not just in oil-dependent Japan: Ask your favorite global bank if it has a branch in Tel Aviv -- you'll be directed to Cairo or Beirut.

Accous Journal; Highway Hits a Roadblock: France's Last 12 Bears
With their mighty walls stretching from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, the Pyrenees hold some of Western Europe's last wild spaces.
Royal eagles and great Egyptian vultures dip along glaciers and waterfalls.
And amid the rangy pine forests the last few bears in France are fighting for survival.
A new truck route linking France and Spain threatens to come thundering through the Aspe Valley, one of the region's most peaceful and spectacular gorges.
The traffic will divide the habitat of the bears and, experts believe, hasten their extinction.
Planners had expected protests over disturbing the valley's medieval villages and polluting the scenery with concrete, noise and car exhausts.
But they had not counted on the power of the legendary brown bear.


Upper Deck Shakes Up Trading-Card Industry
When the Upper Deck Company emerged from nowhere in 1989 with an expensive, premium-quality baseball card that made the other companies' products look like 1950's throwbacks, it jolted a complacent industry accustomed to producing traditional cardboard pictures of ballplayers.
"They're the pulse of the hobby," said Doug Kale, editor of Sports Card Trader, a publication whose readers named Upper Deck the card of the year.

Fans Produced the Biggest Numbers From '93 Season
Contrary to the wishes of the San Francisco Giants, the 25th season of division play in the major leagues came to a close yesterday.
If the owners and the players' union ever get around to agreeing to the proposed three-division alignment and expanded playoffs, this season will have been the last played under the two-division format.
The new system would not necessarily preclude the type of race the Giants and the Atlanta Braves provided.
The loser of a two-team fight for a division championship would not necessarily be the wild-card winner because it might lose out to a team with a better record from another division.
That would make the division race as meaningful as this season's National League West thriller.

In the wake of the recent rapprochement in the Middle East, about 70 prominent law professors have now urged Attorney General Janet Reno to rethink a backward policy.
In 1987 two Palestinian immigrants were arrested at gunpoint in Los Angeles.
They were taken into custody by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and detained in maximum security for three weeks.
Eventually they were released from jail, but their case is still pending.

Judith F. Wolf, Laurence Kurzner
Judith Frohman Wolf, a daughter of Austin K. Wolf of Fairfield, Conn., and the late Beverly S. Wolf, was married yesterday to Laurence David Kurzner, the son of Wilma E. Kurzner of New York, and the late Dr.
Martin M. Kurzner.
The ceremony was performed by Rabbi Marjorie Slome at the Americas Society Mansion in New York.
Mrs.
Kurzner is a senior marketing manager for the DAIS Group, a financial-research consulting firm in New York.
She graduated from Lake Forest College.
Her previous marriage ended in divorce.


Drama (Jets), Highlights (Jets), Anguish (Jets)
The Jets-Eagles game turned out to be a combination Wild West shootout and barroom brawl that spills out into the dark, back alley.
It was football as directed by Sam Peckinpah.
It was as difficult to keep up with the scoring as it is to keep track of the body count of the director's movies.
When the dust settled, the Eagles (4-0), who overcame a 21-0 second-quarter deficit, walked away with 35-30 victory before a crowd of 72,593 at Giants Stadium.
The Jets (2-2) left with a measure of respect for standing toe-to-toe and slugging it out with the best team in the National Football Conference East, but a bad feeling for losing a game they should have won.
There were so many twists and turns, and they happened so quickly, that immediately after the game some Jets players still weren't sure exactly what they had witnessed.


Miss Criscuolo, Mr. Croen
Caroline A. Criscuolo, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Michael Criscuolo of Buffalo, was married yesterday in New York to David M. Croen, a son of Lawrence Croen of Scarsdale, N.Y., and the late Belle-Janet Croen.
Rabbi Peter Rubenstein officiated at the Pierre.
Mrs.
Croen is the manager of the cultural affairs and libraries task force for the New York City Office of Management and Budget.
She graduated from Canisius College and received a master's degree in arts administration from New York University, where she is a lecturer on financial management in the arts.


Glavine Just Wins, Like It or Not
To some, it might have been the ultimate compliment.
To Tom Glavine, what he read on the morning of the day of his most important game of the season was simply more of the same.
Glavine said he read a descriptive phrase saying that all he did was win.
It meant, the pitcher said, that he didn't strike out people, that he didn't win earned run average titles, that he had only one Cy Young Award instead of two or three.
It was a backhanded compliment, he was convinced.
But it was one he tucked away in his back pocket then went about proving to be true.


Fighting Corruption; A 'Blue Wall of Reluctance' Emerges In Testimony to Panel on Police Graft
When a corruption scandal rocked the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn in 1986, Benjamin Ward, then Police Commissioner, responded as commissioners usually did, transferring or demoting 27 supervisors.
The public demanded no less.
The action was known as "rolling heads" and the theory was simple: make the punishment so severe that in the future supervisors would ferret out and eliminate corruption at the first hint of trouble, if only out of fear for their jobs.


Exiled From Pittsburgh, Brister Banishes the Jets
Bubby Brister had an idea of what he was supposed to do when he suddenly became the Eagles' starting quarterback today.
After all, the Eagles let him watch Randall Cunningham in practice.


Susan B. Taman, Eric T. Levy
Susan Beth Taman, the daughter of Arlene and Joel Taman of Hartsdale, N.Y., was married yesterday to Eric Todd Levy, a son of Gail and Alan Levy of Lake Katrine, N.Y.
Rabbi Peter Rubinstein officiated at Tappan Hill in Tarrytown, N.Y.
Mrs.
Levy, a graduate of Cornell University, is a registered dietitian at the New York University Medical Center.


Kidnappings Linked to Fall Of Big Gang
A series of violent kidnappings by Chinatown street criminals in recent weeks appears to be a brutal side effect of turmoil within the Fuk Ching, the gang most deeply involved in smuggling illegal immigrants from China, experts on Asian organized crime and law-enforcement officials say.
After the arrests of the gang's leaders in a Federal crackdown in late August, a leadership vacuum has allowed independent groups in the Fujianese community to take over criminal activities once controlled by the Fuk Ching, the officials say.


Celebrated Birth Aside, Teen-Ager Is Typical Now
In her jeans, floppy rugby shirt and overpriced running shoes, Louise Brown looks like a typical teen-ager.
Her parents complain that she likes "loud music and stupid clothes" and much prefers the company of friends to "us old codgers."
But if life in the Brown household in Bristol, England, is rather routine, the world's memory of Louise is anything but.
Her birth 15 years ago made headlines around the globe as a turning point in human reproduction and gave new hope to countless infertile couples.


College Couples Are Now Asking For AIDS Tests
Elizabeth Rockett, a New York University senior, has gone to the health center on the bustling campus for the usual rites of passage for a modern female student, like getting birth control pills and gynecological care.
Then, two weeks ago, she called there for something that reflects her generation's new approach to sex and mortality: a referral for an AIDS test.
"I had to work up my courage," Ms.
Rockett said of her decision to have the blood test, which detects antibodies to H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
It was a relief but not a surprise to learn that her test was negative.
Her fiance had already tested negative. 'Something You Should Know'
"It seemed like something you should know," said Ms.
Rockett, 24, a politics major who plans to marry in December.
"I would just hate for them two years later to say, 'You're pregnant and you have H.I.V.' Do you want to enter a marriage like that?"


Kelly Calls for Tighter Entry Criteria for Police Officers
Calling the unashamed demeanor of corrupt officers before the Mollen Commission "shocking," New York City's top police official said yesterday that standards for acceptance into the police department might have to be tightened and corruption be addressed more vigorously in the Police Academy curriculum for those who get in.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly also praised as a "hero" a field internal affairs investigator who had testified that his supervisors had given him little support in pursuing corruption.
The hearings go into their second week today at 9:30 A.M. at the City Bar Association.


As Egypt Votes on Mubarak, He Faces Rising Peril
Egyptians, at least some of them, will trudge to voting booths on Monday to take part in a referendum that President Hosni Mubarak hopes will bolster his legitimacy and hold at bay critics who call for democratic reforms.
But to many Egyptians, the referendum signals an end to hopes that Mr.
Mubarak will institute real democratic reform.
Many say they believe that political renewal may come only at the point of a gun, as it has in the past.


Apple Business System
In one of the first indications that Apple Computer Inc. is moving in the direction of separating its software and hardware businesses, the company is planning to introduce an advanced version of its System 7 operating system Monday that will include features for corporate and small-business users.
The new version, called System 7 Pro, will add functions to the standard Macintosh software, including built-in electronic mail that permits users to send messages that include animation, graphics and sound.
System 7 Pro is priced at $149.


No Headline
Today the fate of Russia and the fate of our children is being decided.
The forces of civil war will not suceed.
We will triumph. -- PRESIDENT BORIS N. YELTSIN  [ A10:5. ]


Pregnant Students Prompt Moral Debate
As a pink and crimson sky slowly faded along the horizon, the stadium lights came up over the Texas prairie in La Grange on Friday night and the visiting Fighting Bobcats of Hempstead High charged onto the grass.
But three varsity cheerleaders were not there to greet them, because they had been ordered by the school board to stay off the field.
They are all pregnant.
Whispers and arguments also swirled around another Hempstead girl, the fourth of the school's 15 cheerleaders to be discovered pregnant this fall.
She had an abortion and with no medical reason to prevent her from resuming cheerleading, school officials allowed her back on the squad.


Dance in Review
Nai-Ni Chen Dance  Company  St. Mark's Church
Water seemed to flow through the three new works that the Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company presented on Thursday night.
This water, of course, was purely metaphorical.
The only thirst it could have slaked was a craving for art.
Yet the presence of water was strongly felt, for the dances rippled along with liquid movements.


Dance in Review
Guimond Dance Associates and Mary Seidman and Dancers  Merce Cunningham Studio
A very long program presented by the Guimond Dance Associates and Mary Seidman and Dancers swung dishearteningly from blandness to melodrama and back again on Saturday night.


South Raises Stakes in Fight for Jobs
Last week it was Mercedes-Benz going to Alabama.
Last year it was BMW in South Carolina.
Before that it was Saturn in Tennessee and Toyota in Kentucky.
Increasingly, in large ways and small, manufacturing in the United States has a Southern accent.


Review/Rock; Piano Man at the Garden (With Supporting Cast)
Watching the sold-out house at Madison Square Garden lustily singing along with Billy Joel in hit after hit on Saturday evening, one saw a normally impersonal concert arena transformed into the world's largest piano bar.
The mass sing-along, which was unprompted by the star, began in the show's seventh number, "Allentown," and picked up energy with "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant," a wordy song whose length and complexity didn't faze an audience that seemed to know every syllable and accent.


Aspin to Decide Fate of Admiral This Week
As senior Pentagon officials met to review disciplinary action against Navy admirals who attended a convention of naval aviators, Defense Secretary Les Aspin said today that he would announce the fate of the Navy's top officer, Adm.
Frank B. Kelso 2d, on Monday or Tuesday.
Navy Secretary John H. Dalton has asked for Admiral Kelso's removal as Chief of Naval Operations for what he described as a failure to show proper leadership at the 1991 Tailhook Association convention in Las Vegas, Nev., where 83 women were assaulted.
Mr.
Dalton also wants to discipline 12 other admirals and Marine generals who attended the gathering.


An Accident, a Mistaken Identity and a Family's Confusion
For much of this summer, after Hanif Abdus-Sabr, a counselor at the University of Buffalo, failed to show up for work, his family searched for him.
Told that he might have been the person run over by a trailer at a street festival, they called the county morgue several times, but were told, they said, that his body was not there.
Several weeks ago, family members learned that local authorities had Mr.
Abdus-Sabr's remains all along, misidentified as those of someone who was in fact still alive and ultimately cremated as a body that no one wanted.


Review/Pop; A Voyage Through the Decades With Paul Simon as the Guide
Paul Simon has come a long way since he and Art Garfunkel dissolved their duo in 1970.
So far, in fact, that it has become nearly impossible to look back.
The selling point for Mr.
Simon's monthlong engagement at the Paramount, modestly titled "The Concert Event of a Lifetime" and charging up to $100 a ticket, is the latest reunion of Simon and Garfunkel, performing their 1960's hits.
But on Friday night, the Simon and Garfunkel songs were the only ones that begged for the perceptual haze of nostalgia.
Luckily, they were only part of a three-hour show that confirmed Mr.
Simon's inspiration and ingenuity.
Mr.
Garfunkel turned out to be just one of a large supporting cast of Mr.
Simon's collaborators and fellow singers, including Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the Mighty Clouds of Joy, Phoebe Snow and a remarkable band of American, African and Brazilian musicians.
Steve Martin also turned up, with a comedy cameo that laid to rest the sweetly dated "59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)."


Yankees Now Have the Time Off for Regret or Rejoicing
Their most unattractive month will be remembered more than any other.
Their most disturbing stretch of play will be displayed before them over and over when the Yankee season is reviewed.
Five stellar months, one awful month and one disappointing feeling left lingering.
While the Yankees sorted through their lockers yesterday after their 2-1 victory over the Tigers and tried to decide whether to discard the T-shirts and batting gloves, the ritual was symbolic.
When they return to their off-season homes, the Yankee players must decide whether to discard their September memories, or the images that came before then.


Michele Schipani, James Jeffery
Michele Victoria Baruch Schipani, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Ralph M. Baruch of Stanfordville, N.Y., was married yesterday to James Peter Jeffery, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Perry M. Jeffery of Southbury, Conn.
The Rev.
Louis Gioia, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated at the Metropolitan Club in New York.
Cantor Herbert Strauss took part in the ceremony.
Mrs.
Jeffery is an account supervisor at Grey Advertising in New York.
She graduated from Sweet Briar College and received a master's degree in international communications and law from American University.
Her father founded Viacom International, the New York communications concern, to which he is now a consultant.
The bride's previous marriage ended in divorce.


Rangers Are Busy Team in the Waiver Market
The Rangers were the busiest team yesterday in the National Hockey League's garage sale, formally known as the waiver draft.
They were involved in three of the six moves, losing two players, Paul Broten and John McIntyre, and picking up one, Mike Hudson.
Neither the Islanders nor the Devils made any changes in the draft, which is designed to strengthen weaker clubs.


Dividend Meetings


CHRONICLE
She has been admired as one of the great stars of the screen for almost three decades, but now it seems LIV ULLMANN is giving up acting to become a director and screenwriter.
"This is not really a switch," she said in a phone interview from Boston the other day as she worked on her screenplay adaptation of "Kristin Lavransdatter," a novel by Sigrid Undset, the Nobel Prize-winning author.
She is set to direct the film, which she describes as "a love story written with the blood and experience of a mature woman." It is to be produced by Norsk Films in Norway in May.


Not an Endorsement
To the Editor:
A graphic accompanying a Sept. 27 analysis of the budget views of the New York City mayoral candidates lists me as a person whose views have influenced Rudolph W. Giuliani.


A Focus on Home, Hearth and Profit
As the magazine industry grimly continues to struggle through a recession that refuses to recede, Jack D. Rehm, the chairman, president and chief executive of the Meredith Corporation, is thinking positively.
His demeanor is in keeping with the typically cheerful spirit of the Des Moines-based company, best known for publishing two magazine industry giants: Better Homes and Gardens, with a circulation of 7.6 million, and The Ladies' Home Journal, with 5.1 million.
In addition, Meredith publishes more than a dozen home-and-hearth magazines like Country Home, Country America, Midwest Living, Traditional Home and American Patchwork and Quilting.


Bridge
Making an "impossible" contract often requires help from the defense as well as skillful declarer play.
On the diagramed deal, played in a money game at the Town Club, at 9 East 86th Street, the South cards were held by Judi Radin, a three-time world champion, and she arrived in a decidedly shaky four-spade contract after West had opening the bidding.
Since the bidding indicated that North must have some ruffing power, a trump lead would have been a good choice.
Instead West led the ace and another club, hoping for a ruff in that suit.
The queen won the second trick, and East of course preserved the jack.


'93 Phils Forged in Ashes of '92
When the Phillies assembled for spring training in 1992 in Clearwater, Fla., they represented the sum total of a four-and-a-half-year effort by General Manager Lee Thomas to firmly put in the foundation of a championship team.
But when a pitch in the first inning of the first game of the regular season found and shattered the styloid bone in Lenny Dykstra's left arm, Thomas's grand plan began to cruelly come apart.


Bills Pointing Fingers, at Themselves
At 6 feet 7 inches, with thick strawberry blond hair, Pete Metzelaars could be the king of the lifeguards.
Instead, he is a 33-year-old journeyman tight end for the Buffalo Bills, living proof that pro football players can come from colleges as small as Wabash.
And living proof that pro football players can point fingers at themselves when things do not go well.
As it turned out, Metzelaars's 8-yard touchdown catch from Jim Kelly in the fourth quarter gave the Bills a 17-14 victory tonight over the Giants.
But as good as Metzelaars felt about that, he felt frustrated by the Bills' sputtering offense.


Policing the Police
Cover-ups.
Botched investigations.
Beatings of the innocent.
The "blue wall of silence." Witnesses before the Mollen Commission on police corruption last week painted a terrifying picture of a see-no-evil, hear-no-evil culture in the New York City Police Department that ostracizes whistle-blowers and protects rogue cops.
If the witnesses can be believed, nothing worked to thwart corruption.
Honest cops were ignored, the Internal Affairs Division protected the department's reputation, the brass was disinterested.
A former police officer, Bernard Cawley, an admitted renegade, beat up suspects and innocent bystanders.
Wasn't he afraid of being arrested, a commission counsel asked.
"Who's going to catch us? We're the police. We're in charge," came the chilling answer.


Clinton Offers Domestic Cures To Californians
President Clinton took his entire domestic agenda on the road today, using a rally and televised question-and-answer session to peddle his health care plan, urge the passage of gun-control legislation and promote a trade agreement that he promised would create, not cost, jobs.
Along the way, Mr.
Clinton also pledged that he would appoint to the Federal bench only judges who would uphold the law allowing abortions, even if they are on record as being personally opposed to it.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; With two days remaining to complete cable deals, broadcast stations try to avoid a disappearing act.
IT won't be a television Armageddon, but the outcome of the battle over the dimly understood issue of retransmission consent is still likely to produce confusion, frustration and probably some outrage for television viewers starting Wednesday.
No one in the television industry knows for sure what is going to happen that day, the deadline for cable television operators to satisfy the owners of broadcast stations with some form of compensation in exchange for the right to keep offering the stations on cable systems.


Braves Win N.L. West


Disappointed Black Voters Could Damage Dinkins's Bid
In a mayoral contest that most experts say is now too close to call, one sure bet is that most black votes will go to David N. Dinkins.
But many black ministers, politicians and neighborhood leaders contend that the Mayor's support among black voters is neither as monolithic nor as enthusiastic as it once was, suggesting that more black people than usual might decide not to vote at all.
To be sure, recent opinion polls show the Mayor drawing support from about 90 percent of black people.
It is not considered likely that black Democrats would switch to vote for Rudolph W. Giuliani.
But some who have informally canvassed black voters suggest there is nonetheless disappointment with Mr.
Dinkins and his nearly four years in office.


With Strike Ended at Post, Job Applications Readied
After months of turmoil, The New York Post begins a new lease on life under the stern golden hand of Rupert Murdoch today, starting with the assembling of a new editorial and business staff to replace members of the Newspaper Guild of New York, whose strike fell apart last week.
At the request of the defeated guild's leadership, John Cardinal O'Connor appealed to Mr.
Murdoch yesterday to be fair to 287 guild members -- reporters, editors and advertising and circulation staff -- who lost their jobs in the climactic confrontation, and may or may not be rehired.


Jennifer Lish, Frederic Schwartz
Jennifer Dawn Lish, a research assistant professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr.
Frederic Henry Schwartz, an internist with the American Health Care Groups of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, were married yesterday.
Rabbi Max Hausen officiated at the Willows in Villanova, Pa.
The bride, 35, is a daughter of Gordon Lish of New York and Frances F. Lish of Burlingame, Calif.
A graduate of Brown University, she received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from New York University.
Her father is a novelist and an editor at Alfred A. Knopf, the New York publishing house.
Her mother is a retired social worker.


Stephanie Herman, Richard W. Singer
Stephanie Adeline Herman, a daughter of the late Charles and Charlotte Herman, was married yesterday to Richard Warren Singer, a son of Arnold and Rita Singer of New York.
Rabbi Shiara Milgram officiated at the Chapel in the Woods in White Plains.
Mrs.
Singer, who created and teaches Muscle-Ballet in Palo Alto, Calif., a dance-related workout, was a principal dancer with the Ballet Zurich Opernhaus and the Ballet du Grand Theatre de Geneve of Switzerland.
Her parents were real estate brokers in New York.


Largest Publicly Held Hospital Chain Is Planned
Richard L. Scott, a 40-year-old Texas lawyer who started a small Sun Belt hospital group five years ago by buying a pair of down-at-the-heels hospitals in El Paso, emerged yesterday as the head of the world's largest investor-owned hospital group.
Mr.
Scott's Columbia Healthcare Corporation and the HCA-Hospital Corporation of America announced on Saturday that they had agreed to merge in a tax-free exchange of shares.
It would be the seventh-largest merger in any American industry since 1981.


Gangs in Sarajevo Worry Diplomats
Outside the main surgical clinic at Kosevo Hospital, and along the corridor to the intensive care unit, men wearing steel helmets and carrying rifles and bazookas stand guard 24 hours a day.
Nobody passes without their consent.
Sometimes, even surgeons are turned back.
The men with guns are protecting a patient shot through the heart a week ago, a man who has received the kind of attention accorded to none of the thousands of wounded people who passed through here during Sarajevo's 18 months under siege.
He has been attended by the city's top doctors, and powerful military and Government officials have visited his bedside.


Janice E. Cohen, Jeffrey Beckmen
Janice Ellen Cohen, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard S. Cohen of Martinsville, N.J., was married yesterday to Jeffrey Thomas Beckmen, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Beckmen of Pacific Palisades, Calif.
Rabbi Arnold Gluck performed the ceremony at the Fiddler's Elbow Country Club in Bedminster, N.J.
Mrs.
Beckmen, 27, is an associate in merchant banking at the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.
She graduated from Duke University, from which she and her husband also received M.B.A. degrees.


Eva Normann, Charles Fishman
Eva Martina Normann, the daughter of Inge Normann of New Windsor, N.Y., and the late Walter J. Normann, was married yesterday to Charles Lee Fishman, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Bernard H. Fishman of Hartsdale, N.Y.
The ceremony was performed by Rabbi Amiel Wohl at Temple Israel of New Rochelle, N.Y.
Mrs.
Fishman, 30, is an account executive in New York for Cable and Wireless Communications, a long distance telephone company.


Braves Won't Let Phils Spoil Party, for Now
The Braves know what the goal is.
They know what the impediments are -- guys named Dykstra, Daulton, Hollins and Kruk.
But most of the Braves spent more time in their champagne-soaked clubhouse celebrating their third consecutive National League West championship tonight than they they did worrying about the National League East champion Philadelphia Phillies.


Gay Parents: Living in Fear
When it comes to preserving the two-parent family, some judges are pretty picky.
In Virginia, a judge recently took a child from two parents who loved him and placed him with his single grandmother.
In Oklahoma last week an appeals court judge upheld a ruling that took two girls away from another such family.
The reason?
In both cases, the parents were the same gender.
In the Florida case, the judge said the mother's relationship with her female partner was immoral.
In the Oklahoma case, the judge cited "expert" testimony from a previous case that the child of such a family "might encounter future prejudice by a disapproving society."


Argentine President's Party Leads in Vote for Congress
The Peronist Party of President Carlos Saul Menem seemed headed for victory in mid-term Congressional elections today and the winner over the opposition Radical Party in Buenos Aires, its traditional stronghold.
With more than half of the polling stations reporting, early results showed the Peronists leading in the capital, 33.1 percent to 29.5 percent.
Nationally, as expected, the Peronists won about 40 percent of the votes, compared with 33 percent for the Radicals, according to early returns.


Annette Giacometti, Sculptor's Model, 70
Annette Giacometti, who often modeled for her husband, the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, died on Sept. 19 in Paris, the British newspaper The Independent reported last week.
She was 70.
Her death was announced by the Alberto and Annette Giacometti Association, which did not disclose the cause.


Art World Is Not Amused by Critique
The art world, which is more accustomed to complaining about being ignored by the media than being attacked by it, is still smarting from an unusually biting segment aired two weeks ago on the CBS news magazine "60 Minutes." Entitled "Yes . . . but Is It Art?" the segment, which featured Morley Safer, questioned the very premises of abstract art.
It began with Mr.
Safer quoting P. T. Barnum's legendary statement about a sucker being born every minute.
Mr.
Safer went on to say that most contemporary art was "worthless junk" given value only by the "hype" of critics, auction houses and dealers committed to misleading the public.
As talk of the segment spread through the art world, the furor only grew.
Museum curators, dealers, auction-house experts and collectors are scrambling to get their hands on a tape of the show.


Corrections
A report in the Chronicle column on Sept. 7 about the 1993 Hugo Awards misspelled the name of the author of the book "A Fire in the Deep," which shared top honors with "Doomsday Book" by Connie Willis, for achievement in science fiction and fantasy.
He is Vernor Vinge.


Reactions Are Wary as Dinkins Goes After Jewish Voters
Mayor David N. Dinkins courted the Jewish voters who are crucial to his re-election yesterday, evoking blacks' and Jews' shared history of struggle against discrimination.
But his reception was mixed, ranging from friendly to wary to hostile.
In a speech at Temple Shaaray Tefila at 79th Street and Second Avenue, Mr.
Dinkins took responsibility for the slow police response to the 1991 unrest in Crown Heights, called the stabbing of a rabbinical student there "a lynching" and issued an all-purpose plea for forgiveness "for what has been done wrong."


Clintons' Money Guru Fancies Little Stocks
In the world of money management, there are clients who are big and hand over billions to invest.
And there are clients who are glitzy -- Hollywood stars, for instance.
But there is probably no more prestigious client than the President of the United States.
Bill Clinton's family, one of modest means as Presidential families go, has chosen Joseph C. McNay of Boston, a Yale- and Wharton-educated money manager who is perhaps best known for taking aggressive positions with small and medium growth stocks.
He has made big money for institutional clients that include Wellesley College, Princeton University and the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation of Little Rock.
Yogurt and Other Couture
Now he will be managing the President's portfolio, which consists of a few mutual and money market funds, and the larger account of Hillary Rodham Clinton, a more diversified portfolio that includes shares in Wal-Mart, TCBY Enterprises and Liz Claiborne.
The President's portfolio is worth less than $125,000; Mrs.
Clinton's is valued somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million.
The Clintons have a maximum of $75,000 invested on behalf of their daughter, Chelsea.


A Season When Quick Trips Aren't; Autumn in New York: Trying to Get There With No Detour
When horn-honking, engine-revving, cut-'em-off-at-every-opportunity New York drivers look back on September 1993, what comes to mind almost sounds like a tin-eared rewrite of a song from the musical "The Fantasticks": Try to remember the kind of September when traffic flowed smoothly and roads were not under construction.
Mark Kulewicz tried to remember that far back, but could not.


Season Is History, So Is Stottlemyre
Mel Stottlemyre, the Mets' pitching coach for the last 10 years, always has viewed the season's final day as awkward.
"You wonder who will be back and who won't," he said.
This morning, he walked into the Mets' clubhouse at Joe Robbie Stadium to find himself one of the victims.
The Mets not only fired Stottlemyre, they also reassigned their bench coach, Darrell Johnson, to a scouting role and asked waivers on two players -- third baseman Chico Walker and outfielder Cedric Landrum.


Allen Goes It Alone With a 94-Yard Return
Huffing and puffing in the middle of a criss-crossing-the-field interception run that would become a 94-yard touchdown but was still 40 yards from the Jets' goal line, the Eagles' Eric Allen was counting opponents today.
"Where was the Jets' tight end?" he asked himself as he carried the ball.
And then, all of a sudden, he heard the voice of teammate Ben Smith.


Ohio State Surprise Team at Top of Ranking
Ohio State -- not Florida State or Miami -- is ranked first in The New York Times's first computer rankings of the college football season.
The Buckeyes, unbeaten in four games, were 51-3 victors over Northwestern on Saturday.


Style Editor Is Appointed For The Times Magazine
Holly Brubach, a fashion writer for The New Yorker, has been appointed style editor of The New York Times Magazine, effective next year.
Ms.
Brubach, who is 39, succeeds Carrie Donovan, who has held the position since 1977.
Ms.
Donovan, 65, will retire from regular duties, but will remain as a consultant producing the twice-yearly Fashions of The Times sections and participating in other projects.


2 Questions for the Yankees
The Yankees ended their season triumphantly when Mike Stanley ripped a run-scoring single off Tom Bolton in the bottom of the ninth inning to score pinch-runner Spike Owen and vault them to a 2-1 decision over the Tigers at Yankee Stadium.
"That," said Manager Buck Showalter, "is the way the season should end."


Ana Hernandez, Clifford Nelson
Ana J. Hernandez, a daughter of Emelia Celarie of Freeport, L.I., was married yesterday to Clifford S. Nelson, a son of Vita and Lester Nelson of Harrison, N.Y.
The ceremony was performed by Rabbi Stephen Klein at Le Chateau in South Salem, N.Y.
Mrs.
Nelson is a legal assistant at the New York law firm of Chadbourne &amp; Parke.
She graduated from Skidmore College, as did her husband.
Her mother is a retired nurse who operated a medical clinic in Rosario de la Paz, El Salvador.


Food Store Owners Who Keep Cats Are Breaking the Law
To the Editor:
It is a violation of the New York City Code for food establishments to keep animals.
This includes retail food stores, delicatessens, grocery stores that make sandwiches or have salad bars, and restaurants.
And yet many of these stores keep cats as mousers with the full knowledge that they are breaking the law.


The Jolt That Tourist Deaths Produce
To the Editor:
I applaud "A Murderous Double Standard" (editorial, Sept. 23), which decries our unwillingness to confront the violence in our inner cities until it spills out, as in the murder of foreign tourists.
I can't imagine that if suburban schoolchildren lived in daily fear of death or maiming by crossfire from semiautomatics, we would not find the commitment and resources to end this horror.


Alexander Gralnick, Founder of Hospital And Psychiatrist, 80
Dr.
Alexander Gralnick, the founder and psychiatrist in chief of High Point Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y., died on Thursday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan.
He was 80 and lived in Port Chester and West Palm Beach, Fla.
The cause was complications of heart-bypass surgery, his family said.


Florida State Is Just One Of the Worries for Miami
The annual Armageddon between Florida State and Miami, scheduled on Saturday at Tallahassee, now has the extra seasoning of a quarterback controversy.
Disappointed by an offense that has sputtered, if not gasped, this season, Miami Coach Dennis Erickson lost his patience last Saturday and replaced his No. 1 quarterback, Frank Costa, with his No. 2, Ryan Collins.


Foreign Stocks Proved Wise Choice in Quarter
Foreign stock prices posted impressive gains in the third quarter, aided by falling European interest rates and dynamic growth in a number of the Pacific Rim's smaller economies.
The improvement on foreign equity markets stood in contrast to what took place at home, where market averages, sloshing around at record highs, managed only a marginal increase.


'Sin' Taxes
While increases in "sin taxes" on alcohol and cigarettes have raised revenue in the region in the past five years, officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut predict that declining consumption means this form of taxation will eventually reach the point of diminishing returns.
States have long relied on such levies as politically painless: Cigarette taxes have almost quadrupled in New York in the last ten years and excise taxes on beverages have risen steadily in the region.
President Clinton has said he wants to raise the Federal tax on cigarettes to help pay for his overhaul of the health care system.


ATLANTIC DIVISION
Even if their Paramount parent wasn't the object of a Wall Street bidding war, this would be a season of transition for the Rangers.
With Mike Keenan as coach, the roster may eventually evolve from its current mixture of styles into a united bunch of board bangers who initiate contact first and chase pucks later.
Keenan's better teams put gloves in faces and play three-hour games.
Adam Graves should fit in well.
The young Mark Messier of the 1980's would have, too; the older Mark Messier of today may or may not.
The Keenan-Messier mixture could create a chemical reaction, with good or bad results.
Another strong personality is Mike Gartner, the new president of the Players Association.

'Thicker Than Water'  Stephan Koplowitz and Company Bessie Schonberg Theater
Stephan Koplowitz's "Thicker Than Water," presented on Thursday night, is about a family so ordinary that one is immediately suspicious.
Will Simon, the father, turn out to be a child molester and his daughter, Melissa the victim?

PRO FOOTBALL: Sports of The Times; These Jets Earned More Than a Loss
FOR the Jets, it was a mid-term exam.
Unlike other years, they didn't flunk.
But they didn't make the honor roll either.

"If we don't have two late turnovers in their red zone, that's at least two field goals, and we win going away," Boomer Esiason was saying now.
"But we let them back in it when I throw two interceptions. No excuse for that. Two horrible interceptions."


Viacom Is Said to Seek Help From Nynex on Bid
In seeking a partner to help increase its bid for Paramount Communications, Viacom Inc. has zeroed in on the Nynex Corporation, the company that owns New York Telephone and New England Telephone, according to two executives with knowledge of the discussions.
Spokesmen for Viacom and Nynex declined to comment.
Throughout last week, Viacom's chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, said he was talking with telephone and cable companies about minority investments in Viacom to give his company a cash infusion.
That would allow Viacom to bolster its bid for Paramount without increasing its debt load.

U.N. IS EXTENDING FORCE IN CROATIA
After winning strong backing from the United States and its major allies in his successful showdown with the Russian Parliament, President Boris N. Yeltsin today abruptly dropped his opposition to an American-backed plan to put more pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to end the civil war in Croatia.
As a result, the Security Council voted unanimously today to extend for six more months the mandate for the 22,000 United Nations peacekeeping forces deployed in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia.
But the Council said it was unlikely to relax the trade embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, the remaining republics in the Yugoslav Federation, until they persuade Croatia's ethnic Serbs to make peace with the Croatian Government in Zagreb.

Too Rich a Soil: Scientists Find the Flaw That Undid the Biosphere
THE major flaw in the $150 million Biosphere 2 project has been discovered by a leading geochemist and his student, raising questions of whether the venture in the Arizona desert will be corrected in the interest of serious science or will be doomed to repeated cycles of failure in the years ahead.
In theory, the experiment is to last 100 years.
A mysterious decline in oxygen during the two-year trial run of the project endangered the lives of crew members and forced its leaders to inject huge amounts of oxygen, spoiling the idea of a self-contained ecosystem that was supposedly a way to learn about living in space.


A Prima Ballerina Follows the Path Of 2 Creators of Modern Dance
Natalia Makarova said farewell to dance in 1989 in a performance at the Kirov Ballet in what was then Leningrad, the company and the city in which she became a prima ballerina.
Since then, she has acted in Britain and in Russia and appeared with her 15-year-old son, Andrusha, in a television documentary on great train routes.
But tonight, as part of an opening-night gala that begins the Martha Graham Dance Company's two-week season at City Center, Miss Makarova returns to the dance stage in a decided novelty.
She will dance "The Incense," a solo created by Ruth St.
Denis in 1906, in which a woman becomes the incense that she burns.
Two days before her performance, Miss Makarova put the finishing touches on the solo in an hour of intense and probing rehearsal.
Her sari costume was unavailable, so she put on a black leotard and practice skirt with a colored scarf tied at her waist.
"I have a whole library of scarves," she said gaily in her colorfully accented English.
"I should open a store." Haunted by a Certain Swan
Someone handed her a tin mixing bowl that was close to the shape she would hold in performance.
Then she began to move, watched intently by Peggy Lyman, a former Graham dancer who performed the solo in 1985.
What emerged was not St.
Denis, Graham or Miss Lyman, but a figure of mysterious passion and simplicity.

Puzzle in Somalia: the U.S. Goal
The ill-fated raid on a stronghold of the faction leader Mohammed Farah Aidid casts the United States more than ever in the role of combatant in Somalia, raising doubts about its stated strategy to shift the focus to a political solution for the country.
Faced in recent weeks with mounting Congresssional opposition to the presence of American troops in Somalia, Administration officials said last week that the United States was moving away from the purely military goal of capturing and punishing General Aidid.
Last month, Secretary of State Warren Christopher delivered a paper to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations detailing initiatives that would concentrate instead on political reconciliation.


Court to Consider Repeal of Stock Plan Loophole
Accepting a case that is likely to touch a nerve with many taxpayers this year, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the retroactive repeal by Congress of a tax loophole in 1987 was so unfair as to violate the constitutional due process rights of taxpayers who had relied on the provision.
The budget package that Congress passed two months ago raised income tax rates retroactively to the beginning of the year.
Congress has often made retroactive changes in the tax code, and the Supreme Court has generally upheld the changes against constitutional challenge.

A Snapshot of the Continent's Flora, Invaders and All
BECAUSE of the sheer immensity of the task, botanists have long been thwarted in their attempt to compile a full listing of North America's floral riches.
But a start has at last been made with the publication this week of the first two volumes of a work that aims to describe all of the 20,000 wild plant species in the United States and Canada.
The work, "Flora of North America North of Mexico," describes the startling inroads made by foreign invaders, which now comprise one-fifth to one-third of all North American plant species.
Many of these "exotic" plants spread so easily that along with native weeds, which account for 5 to 10 percent of species, their physical extent is proportionally greater than their species numbers.
And because exotics and native weeds include some of the showiest and most conspicuous species, their visual impact eclipses that of other plants in many parts of the region.

American League Championship Matchups
ON THE MOUND Jack McDowell, Alex Fernandez, Wilson Alvarez and Jason Bere were not supposed to resemble the celebrated quartet that starts for the Atlanta Braves, but they have quickly become the strongest rotation in the American League.
McDowell is a 20-game winner for the second successive season, Fernandez blossomed into an 18-game winner and the youngest pair, Alvarez and Bere, have been hotter than the other two in the past seven weeks, winning 14 and losing none of their last 15 starts combined.
All four are power pitchers, with Bere, a 22-year-old rookie, registering the best strikeout ratio.
Bere was a 36th- round draft pick in 1990, and was not a starter in his first minor league season.
He has developed rapidly, compiling a 2.19 e.r.a. since the all-star break.
The development of Bere and Alvarez have relegated Tim Belcher and Kirk McCaskill, two veteran starters, to relief roles.
Roberto Hernandez has been an effective closing relief pitcher, gaining 38 saves in 43 chances.
In the field As much as they like to run, the Blue Jays have to be wary of Ron Karkovice, who has thrown out 48 of 96 would-be basestealers.
"You can never steal on Karkovice," Sparky Anderson, the Detroit manager, said.
"The only chance you have is if a pitcher allows you a chance and the White Sox usually don't allow you a chance. McDowell is the only one you can take a chance on. Karkovice is the best receiver in either league."
The catcher is the first cog in the smooth defense the White Sox boast up the middle.
Shortstop Ozzie Guillen and second baseman Joey Cora form a good double-play combination and provide good coverage in the middle of the infield.
Lance Johnson covers a lot of ground in center field.
Robin Ventura is one of the best defensive third basemen in the league.
Frank Thomas, the regular first baseman, very likely will be the d.h.
His replacement, Dan Pasqua is better defensively.
At the plate The series could come down to one simple development: Will Frank Thomas have a healthy left arm to swing at Toronto pitches, or will he continue to have the problem that plagued him in his final couple of weeks?
Thomas injured his left triceps trying to catch a foul ball Sept. 19 and slumped badly afterward.
Sitting out five games before playing Sunday, the big first baseman hit no home runs in his last 15 games and drove in two runs in his last 11.
If he is healthy and hitting like the player who batted .316, socked 41 home runs and knocked in 128 runs, the Blue Jays won't let him hit.
That is, they most likely will pitch around him.
"For me, I wouldn't let Frank Thomas get close to a fastball," said the general manager of an American League team not in the playoff.
"Walk him. The Blue Jays' pitchers have to pitch around him. You can't let Thomas beat you."
If the Blue Jays employ that strategy, Robin Ventura (22 home runs, 93 r.b.i.) becomes the key run producer.
If Thomas is the d.h.
George Bell or Bo Jackson won't be.
But neither has hit against Toronto this season (Bell .065, Jackson .048, so that may not be much of a loss).
Tim Raines, the leadoff batter, and Lance Johnson are .300 hitters.
Off the bench Manager Gene Lamont probably will use his bench more than the Blue Jays, but probably not much more.
He has spelled Tim Raines in left with Bo Jackson, and he has started Dan Pasqua in right for Ellis Burks.
Craig Grebeck also gets an occasional infield start.
George Bell, if he is not the designated hitter; Jackson, Pasqua, Warren Newson and Ivan Calderon could hit for someone if the situation calls for it.
Steve Sax is the invisible man.
Blue Jays: On the mound The pitcher who should have been the Blue Jays' best this season pitched in New York instead.
They let Jimmy Key leave as a free agent, and their starting rotation suffered.
Dave Stewart, a veteran of 14 post-season starts with Oakland, has received the assignment of leading the staff, not just because of his experience but because of his recent run of effective pitching.
After struggling to an 8-8 record, he reeled off four consecutive victories.
Juan Guzman (14-3) hasn't lost since July 20.
He has won 7 of his 13 starts since, and the Blue Jays have won three others.
Pat Hentgen, in his first year in the starting rotation, was the team's No. 1 winner with a 19-9 record but, like the other starters, had a high earned run average, 3.87.
Guzman finished at 3.99, Stewart at 4.44 and Todd Stottlemyre (the staff enigma with an 11-12 record) at 4.84.
Jack Morris can't pitch because of a torn elbow ligament, but he couldn't have helped, based on his 7-12, 6.19 e.r.a.
Duane Ward, with 45 saves, has done as well as Tom Henke, his predecessor, ever did as the closer, but no one stepped in to take Ward's spot as as the setup reliever to the closer.
In the field Pat Borders is no Ron Karkovice--he's borderline, a general manager said, jokingly or otherwise--but the Blue Jays' pitchers do a better job than most holding runners on.
The rest of the defense doesn't have to apologize to anyone.
Roberto Alomar is as good a second baseman as there is, and Devon White has the same standing among center fielders Rickey Henderson, snatch catch and all, catches everything on the left field side of center that White doesn't get.
In other words, the Blue Jays are well covered on grass (Comiskey Park) and on artificial turf (SkyDome).
Tony Fernandez, who revived after the Mets traded him back to Toronto, doesn't have the range at shortstop he did in his first seven years with the Blue Jays, but he gets around well enough.
Ed Sprague, in his first year as the third baseman, can be vulnerable, having committed 17 errors this season.
At the plate To beat the Blue Jays, Sparky Anderson says, the White Sox must stop Rickey Henderson and Paul Molitor.
"They don't have to stop the other guys," Anderson said.
"If Henderson and Molitor have good series, they're going to make monsters out of the others. You have to contain them, and I haven't seen anyone contain Molitor all season."
Molitor, who replaced Dave Winfield, he of the World Series-winning hit, outdid Winfield during the season, batting .332, hitting 22 home runs and driving in 111 runs.
During one late-season month, Aug. 15 to Sept. 15, the designated hitter batted .405 and knocked in 27 runs in 28 games.
Henderson, on the other hand, batted only .216 after joining Toronto, highly uncharacteristic for a player who always has played extremely well upon going to a new team.
"This is national attention for him," Anderson said.
"I'm scared of guys who respond to national attention and he does."
The "other guys" Anderson refered to include Roberto Alomar (.323), Joe Carter (33 homers, 120 r.b.i.) and John Olerud, whose .402 average of July 31 dropped to .363 because he batted only .290 since then.
Not to be overlooked are Devon White (.272), Tony Fernandez (.304) and Ed Sprague (73 r.b.i.).
Off the bench With the lineup he has, Manager Cito Gaston doesn't have much need for a bench.
Who would he hit for?
That's why the Blue Jays don't need the kind of pinch-hitters they used to have, people like Pat Tabler and Rance Mulliniks.
Turner Ward was the team's busiest pinch-hitter during the season, and he batted six times.
No one had more than one hit as a pinch-hittter.
Nor does Gaston have any need to substitute defensively.
What the Blue Jays show at the start of a game is pretty much what they'll still be showing at the end.
Pitching--edge to White Sox; Defense-edge to White Sox; Hitting-edge to Blue Jays; Bench--no edge

A Take-Out Lunch at the New Prospect Park Wildlife Center


Dinkins or Giuliani? Voters Equally Unimpressed
Four weeks before Election Day, the race between Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani remains a tossup.
Fewer than half of voters trust either candidate to deal with New York City's problems and nearly half are concerned that each might make serious mistakes, according to the latest New York Times / WCBS-TV News poll.
In a bitter rematch between two well-known contenders, the electorate is strikingly unenthusiastic about both.
Just 38 percent of voters expressed a favorable opinion of the Democratic Mayor, while a scant 31 percent had a favorable view of his Republican-Liberal challenger.
About as many voters viewed each candidate unfavorably as viewed him favorably.


Crusader Remains
In 1179, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria, led his troops in an attack against the Crusaders' largest fortress.
In late August, the Muslim forces overran the fortress in Jerusalem, killing about 800 of its 1,500 defenders.
For centuries, the soldiers' remains lay hidden in the ruins.
Now a team of Israeli archeologists has reported finding a skeleton that appears to be one of the fortress's defenders.
They believe that this will prove to be the first documented discovery of a Crusader soldier at an archeological site.


Keycorp-Society Deal Is Merger of Equals
Some mergers are initiated by high-priced investment bankers or well-connected lawyers, but the bank merger announced yesterday between Keycorp of Albany and the Society Corporation of Cleveland -- the biggest in two years -- was set in motion by a horse in Wyoming.

From his home in Albany, he called Robert W. Gillespie, Society's chairman, and the two of them quickly worked out the outlines of a merger deal that would create roughly the nation's 10th-biggest banking company, with $58 billion in assets spread across the northern section of the United States.


Louis Fugazy, 76, Retired Executive Of Travel Business

He was 76.
The cause was heart failure, his family said.


Market Place; Which companies will suffer if tourists steer clear of Florida?
INVESTORS reacted to a spate of recent attacks on tourists in Florida by temporarily punishing the shares of the Walt Disney Company, on the assumption that some vacationers would stay away from Disney's theme parks in Florida.
In the weeks since, other companies with ties to the state's $30 billion-a-year tourist business have braced for a similar backlash.
Because the fall is generally a slack period for Florida attractions, there is little evidence yet that the number of annual visitors, about 40 million, will decline.
Even so, tourism officials and some amusement park operators expect the blizzard of negative publicity over the 10 visitors who have been killed in Florida since last October will curtail visits by 15 to 30 percent this winter and possibly hurt bookings thereafter.

SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW: Outside Moscow; Provinces Report Calm, but Yeltsin Supporters Call for Stiff Changes in Their Areas
Across Russia, all eyes were on the confrontation in Moscow today.
A sampling of reports tonight from some of the 88 regions that make up the Russian federation indicated that the violence had not spread beyond the capital.
"Everyone has been watching television and listening to the radio all day just to understand what is happening in Moscow," said Stanislav E. Bogomolov, the editor on the news desk at Uralsky Rabochi, a newspaper in Yekaterinburg, an industrial city in the Ural Mountains that is also President Boris N. Yeltsin's hometown.
"It is absolutely calm here."


Upjohn Selects Kobs &amp; Draft
The Upjohn Company said it had moved the account for its Rogaine prescription hair-loss treatment from one Saatchi &amp; Saatchi agency to another, leaving Klemtner Advertising in New York after eight years for Kobs &amp; Draft in New York, which specializes in direct-response advertising.
Ellen Miller, executive director of sales and marketing of the Upjohn dermatology division in Kalamazoo, Mich., confirmed a report of the move in The DeLay Letter, a direct marketing industry newsletter.
She said that as the brand evolved, direct marketing had become more important, adding, "We felt it necessary to bring in greater expertise in this area."


3 Premieres in 3 Nights For City Opera's 50th
On the stage of the New York State Theater one recent afternoon, an enormous photograph of Marilyn Monroe in the nude was projected on Venetian blinds.
The singers, walking through the staging of Ezra Laderman's new opera "Marilyn" for the first time, paid the picture no notice; they were caught up in a discussion with Jerome Sirlin, the director, about where they were supposed to stand.
Out in the house, technicians at computer consoles kept track of lighting cues, and Mr.
Laderman made a list of points to clarify with Mr.
Sirlin after the rehearsal.
While the "Marilyn" crew was in the house, Joseph Colaneri, the New York City Opera's chorus master, was in a basement rehearsal studio leading his singers through the rhythmic thickets of Hugo Weisgall's "Esther," with the composer sitting quietly to his left.
And if not for the vagaries of scheduling, there might have been a third composer in the house as well: Lukas Foss, whose "Griffelkin" had its first stage rehearsals later in the week.


Woes at VW Cross the Czech Border
If Volkswagen A.G. has had anything to cheer about this year, it has been the performance of its Skoda automobile plant in the Czech Republic, where sales and profits have been growing as the German auto maker invests in bringing the old Communist-run operation up to Western standards.
But now, VW's woes have spread to this country as well, raising questions about the plans for Skoda by Europe's biggest auto maker.
Last month, Volkswagen abruptly canceled plans to borrow $860 million to help finance the modernization of Skoda's car factory, in Mlada Boleslav, 30 miles northeast of here.

Regarding Taylor and Hampton, Giants Ponder X-Rays and O's
Injuries probably influence careers more than any other factor in professional football.
For Giants running back Rodney Hampton, a strained left ankle could sideline him for Sunday's game against the Washington Redskins.
But for Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, age and a nasty hamstring injury may force him, at least for the near future, into a role he's not used to: part-time player.
With the 34-year-old Taylor, the Giants find themselves in a difficult position.
On one hand, they want to both respect and honor the dignity of a warrior who would try and play if every bone in his body was broken.
On the other, they want to make plays and win games, going with the idea that younger players like Corey Miller and Jessie Armstead are better than an aging veteran who is ailing.

Fatal Drug Trial Raises Questions About 'Informed Consent'
THE deaths of 5 of 15 participants in a drug trial at the National Institutes of Health over the last few months have focused attention on the process by which patients come to participate in studies testing the safety and efficacy of new therapies.
What seemed, after an uneventful pilot study, to be a safe and promising drug for hepatitis B turned out to have fatal complications.
In addition to those who died, two participants survived only after having liver transplants.
The remaining eight are unaffected so far.
The deaths made the trial the most catastrophic human experiment in many years.
Now it may become the subject of a Congressional hearing.

Review/Television; Testing the System for Testing the Blood Supply
Rest easy.
Tonight's "Dateline NBC" report on the risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion is not contaminated by the sort of impurities that caused a bloodletting at the network.
No explosive devices or staged dramatics.
Instead, it displays in quite pure form the techniques that make the television news magazine an impure child of journalism.
The argument is that blood from the American Red Cross and other major suppliers around the country has not been adequately tested for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
Stone Phillips, who does the interviewing, reiterates reassurances that "the vast majority of blood transfusions are perfectly safe," but his report focuses on two patients who were infected and on findings by the Food and Drug Administration of testing and labeling violations.


For Home, Color Printer That Is Hard to Beat
CANON COMPUTER SYSTEMS INC.'s new BJC-600 color inkjet printer, which was introduced yesterday, offers impressive print quality and ease of use at a relatively low price.
It warrants serious consideration by people who have been thinking about getting a plain-paper color printer, but who have turned green at the high cost and low quality of most color models on the market.
The BJC-600, which works with computers that use Windows software, appears to offer the best print quality in its price range, which is expected to be less than $650 when the $719 list price is discounted in the stores.

In Russia, Disorder to Democracy?
The world exhaled in relief when Boris Yeltsin's hard-line opponents ended a 13-day standoff and, hands over heads, shuffled down the steps of Russia's Parliament building to surrender.
Yet Mr.
Yeltsin's dramatic victory is merely a prelude to a more complex task: to fashion a genuinely democratic coalition that includes not only his reformist allies but his nonviolent critics, who question the course he is charting.
Only then can he permanently outflank the unrepentant Communists and nationalists who may again try to bring him down.
Only then can he give real meaning to December's parliamentary elections.
Only then can he free himself from the army that sprang to his rescue.
Only then can he shore up the fragile foundations of democratic order and justify the resolute support he has received from Washington and the world.


Treasury Prices Little Changed
Treasury prices and yields were little changed yesterday with light volume and cautious trading ahead of the release of September employment data on Friday.
The end to the fighting in Moscow seemed to have little impact in the bond market or other financial markets because, some analysts said, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia seemed to be in control despite the bloodshed.

Grateful for their role in bringing stability to the country's economy, Argentines gave Congressional candidates of President Carlos Saul Menem's Peronist Party a overwhelming victory in nationwide elections on Sunday.
The victory gives Mr.
Menem a big push toward winning approval for a change in the Constitution that would allow him to run for re-election.
But it falls short of giving the Peronists the two-thirds majority in Congress that is needed to change the Constitution.


Poverty in U.S. Grew Faster Than Population Last Year
Despite the end of the recession, the number of poor people in the United States increased last year by 1.2 million, to 36.9 million, increasing three times as fast as the overall population, the Census Bureau reported today.
The number of poor people was higher than in any year since 1962, when John F. Kennedy was President.
In that year, of course, the nation's population was much smaller, and the poor accounted for a larger proportion of the total population: 21 percent in 1962, as against 14.5 percent last year.

Selections from "Hashirim" have been recorded and turn up on choral programs every now and then, yet Rossi's far more copious contributions to the secular repertory are rarely given a hearing.

The Last Gasp Of Russia's Communists
Now begins the arduous task of reconciling the Russian nation and building a democratic state on the rubble of Communism.
The prospects for success look better than at any time since the abdication of Czar Nicholas II in March 1917.
Unless President Boris Yeltsin repeats previous mistakes and seeks compromises with his defeated enemies, who interpret readiness to compromise as weakness, we are unlikely ever again to see a resurgence of a militant antidemocratic opposition.
The events of the past two days are probably the last outbreak of violent counterrevolution in Russia.

Clinton Sending Reinforcements After Heavy Losses in Somalia
President Clinton ordered several hundred fresh United States troops to Somalia today, plus heavy tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters and gunships, in the aftermath of heavy American losses in a United Nations military operation in Mogadishu on Sunday.
The latest Pentagon tally indicated that at least 12 American soldiers had been killed and 78 wounded.
Several others were reported missing and may be captives of the forces of Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, the fugitive Somali faction leader.
That made Sunday by far the costliest day for the United States since American forces arrived in Somalia almost 10 months ago.

Clinton told 915 delegates at convention of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations that he was arguing on behalf of the trade agreement, "not so you'll agree with me, but so you will know what I want you to know, which is that I would never knowingly do anything to cost an American a job."

Panel Is Told of a File on Police Graft Within Internal Affairs
The Internal Affairs Division of New York City's Police Department kept a secret file of allegations of corruption against its own officers, top police officials and their relatives, according to testimony yesterday before a commission investigating police corruption.
Contrary to standard department policy, information about those investigations was not passed along to prosecutors, the commission was told.
In other testimony yesterday, a former police official who headed the division told the Mollen Commission that a pervasive fear of negative publicity and a lack of logistical support stymied efforts to ferret out corrupt police officers.


Archeologists Wonder at a City That Survived the Maya Collapse
ARCHEOLOGISTS struggling to understand how and why the classic Maya civilization collapsed so catastrophically in the ninth century A.D. keep turning up evidence that complicates their task.
Among the ruins of grand cities suddenly abandoned they are finding some others in the Central American lowlands that not only survived but prospered long after.
Such a place was Xunantunich (pronounced Shoo-NAN-too-NEECH).
New discoveries, announced last week by the University of California at Los Angeles, show that this classic Maya city survived the spreading chaos and remained a bustling center of art, religion and culture for another 150 to 200 years after what had until recently been considered a virtually total decline.

Review/Music; How Do You Build Up To Beethoven's Fifth?
As a way to link the seven programs that the New York Chamber Symphony is playing in its 17th season, Gerard Schwarz is leading his 46-piece ensemble in the nine Beethoven symphonies.
The season prospectus gushes with worshipful advocacy of these not exactly underplayed works.
Mr.
Schwarz, for example, is quoted as saying that "their variety makes them the most extraordinary body of work ever written by a single composer."
Depending how oversold on Beethoven they feel, listeners may either nod in assent or wonder whether the Beethoven symphonies are really more varied than, say, the songs of Schubert or the Beatles, the Verdi operas, the Mozart or Schoenberg chamber works, the stage music of Kurt Weill, the explorations of Miles Davis, or for that matter, the Beethoven string quartets.


Cuomo Picks Investment Banker For Municipal Assistance Post
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo today appointed Eugene J. Keilin, a Manhattan investment banker and longtime associate of Felix G. Rohatyn, to succeed Mr.

Rohatyn announced his resignation last month from the agency he helped form 18 years ago to pull New York City from the brink of bankruptcy.
When bankers closed the credit markets to the city in 1975, the state formed the corporation as a vehicle to borrow on the city's behalf.
It continues to manage a large investment portfolio on the city's behalf, and its nine-member board oversees the city's finances in an advisory role.

SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW: The Overview; RUSSIAN ARMY ROUTS REBELS AT PARLIAMENT AS YELTSIN TAKES STEPS TO TIGHTEN CONTROL
Tanks and troops loyal to President Boris N. Yeltsin today crushed an armed uprising by his opponents with a potent show of force that left their white riverside stronghold battered and in flames.
The Parliament building, known as the White House, was shaken by huge explosions from 125-millimeter shells fired from T-72 and T-80 tanks.
As crack airborne troops conducted a floor-by-floor assault, hundreds of legislators, defenders and supporters began filing out of the building shortly before 5 P.M.
Their leaders followed at 6 P.M. (11 A.M., Eastern time).

Viacom said the Nynex Corporation had agreed to invest $1.2 billion in it, giving Viacom new ammunition for its $7.4 billion bid for Paramount Communications.  [ Page D1. ]  Behind the war between Viacom and QVC Network for Paramount lies the wisdom that bigger is better in the media business.

New Zoning For Waterfront Faces Barriers
New zoning rules for New York City's waterfront, which are meant to open miles of shoreline property to the public, may be on the verge of defeat by the City Council, key Council leaders said yesterday.
"My sense is that this proposal could well be going down," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, Democrat of Queens, who heads the Council's zoning and franchises subcommittee, which is to vote on the rules tomorrow.
"The proposal has little support among the members."

Review/Film Festival; Following Flaubert, An Eminent Director Finds a Fresh Ema
At the age of 85, the Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira, who has been making movies since 1931 and is still little known in this country, has brought forth what a number of European critics describe as his chef-d'oeuvre: "Valley of Abraham" ("Vale Abraao"), a contemporary variation on Gustave Flaubert's "Madame Bovary," inspired by Agustina Bessa-Luis's Portuguese novel also titled "Valley of Abraham."
The film is a grand, singularly idiosyncratic work, as austere as Robert Bresson's "Diary of a Country Priest" and as thick with narrative details and chatty asides as "Little Dorrit." It mesmerizes, sometimes maddens and tests the emotional and physical reflexes.


By Design; Shawl Season
What to wear when a jacket isn't enough and a coat is too much?
A cuddly shawl.
Scores of fashionable New York women can be seen dashing around the city with a swath of wool or cashmere wrapped around their jackets.
The wrap might be a folded square or an unlined cape.
Whether so sizable the fringes tease the sidewalk or just big enough to protect the chest and back, it should be worn with insouciance.


Officer Is Given Probation in Beating Case
A New York City police officer was sentenced yesterday to probation, community service and a fine for his assault conviction stemming from the beating of a teen-ager who had slashed the face of another officer.
The sentence was criticized by District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn because it had no jail time.
Officer Thomas Cea, 27, could have been given up to a year in jail.

A New York State Supreme Court Judge has upheld a $170,000 fine against a Long Island doctor who provided 225 patients with questionable mammograms, the Nassau County Health Department announced this evening.
County officials said the decision, which was issued two weeks ago by Judge Harry Kutner, said that Dr.
Padma Ram of Floral Park had committed violations of the state radiation code that "bespeak a casual disregard of the health of patients." These violations were "repeated and continuous," it concluded.

'Synergy': The Unspoken Word
It is the kind of multibillion-dollar bidding war not seen since the go-go 1980's: two big cable television companies fighting to buy Paramount Communications Inc., an entertainment empire that includes professional sports teams, book publishing houses and the last major independent movie studio in America.
Behind this duel between Viacom Inc. and QVC Network Inc. also lies the 1980's conventional wisdom that bigger is better in the media business.
"Synergy" they called it in the 80's, when Time and Warner were courting, Sony was eyeing Columbia and Matsushita was wooing MCA.
As in a good marriage, each partner would bring qualities that when combined would magically create something better than either could achieve alone.

The Hospital World's Hard-Driving Money Man
Richard L. Scott's idea of fun is fixing up rundown hospitals, closing some institutions and seeking to please doctors.
Riding a nationwide wave of health-care consolidations, the 40-year-old lawyer has gone to the top of the world's largest for-profit hospital empire in eight years of nonstop wheeling and dealing.
His eight-year-old Columbia Healthcare Corporation has agreed to merge with the HCA-Hospital Corporation of America to create a 190-hospital colossus stretching across 26 states and two foreign countries.
On Sept. 1, Columbia completed a merger with Galen Healthcare, the big chain of former Humana hospitals.

The 1993 Snake Oil Protection Act
Forget health care reform or reinventing government.
The biggest volume of mail being logged in many Congressional offices these days calls on the lawmakers to block action by the Food and Drug Administration to ban the sale of vitamins and other dietary supplements.
The only problem is, the agency has no such proposal.
Using scare tactics and misinformation, the dietary supplement industry has managed to rally thousands of health-minded Americans to support legislation that would actually deprive consumers of reliable health information.


Mexico Will Phase Out Price Supports for Corn
Mexico said today that it would phase out its politically sensitive system of price supports for corn and other crops and replace it with direct payments to farmers based on the amount of land they cultivate.
Mexican officials called the new system a "transitory scheme" that would last for 15 years and was intended to lead to the development of more economically competitive farms.
The program is meant to complement an economic stimulus package of tax cuts and wage increases that Mr.
Salinas announced on Sunday.


Haiti Police Chief Poses Hurdle to Aristide's Return
On the eve of the arrival of 600 American troops in Haiti, the self-appointed commander of the country's military police stands as a menacing obstacle to an accord aimed at sealing the return on Oct. 30 of the elected President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Catching American diplomats off guard and sending a chill through many Haitians, who were already bracing for a surge in the country's endemic political violence, the commander, Col.
Joseph Michel Francois, has declared that he has no intention of complying with the internationally brokered pact, which calls for his removal.


SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW: TV Critic's Notebook; Commotion and Confusion on the Air as History Is in the Making
It was like a television remake of the Russian Revolution: crowds under the red hammer and sickle driving the outnumbered police and militiamen before them, storming Government buildings, becoming masters of the streets.
Or at least some streets and some buildings, at least for a while.
They were even chanting "All power to the Soviets!"
CNN was there, of course, as it was so dramatically in the Persian Gulf war and the landing in Somalia.
This time scenes of conflict were shown before a bright backdrop of autumn colors.
Steve Hurst, CNN Moscow correspondent, was on the job from the first morning signs of confrontation into the night, calling what he was watching from the the network's studio in the mayor's office "total confusion."


When the Cheering Had to Stop
The 15 girls who lead the cheers for the Hempstead, Tex., Fighting Bobcats -- and, indeed, their counterparts all over the country -- aren't dancers, although they often mimic a chorus line.
They aren't athletes, although their splits and high kicks can be awesome.
They are youngsters who for a few, fleeting years have a moment in the sun.
If cheerleaders are sometimes seen by adults as all-round good kids, role models even, it's because their good looks and vitality grant them status in high school society and give them a certain nostalgia value for their elders.
They embody everything the people in the stands want to believe about youth and its legendary partner, innocence.

Water is different.
It ripples, runs, gleams and shines, mirroring the sky or turning unfathomably black; and more than any form of food it is of course the staff of life.
Not surprisingly, most waters are being overfished nowadays, and not just for protein, but for the sake of "interrupting the invisibility of these shining creatures and existing for a moment with them in their wildness," as Howell Raines explains.


Bosnian Muslims Aren't Simply Victims
To the Editor:
A report from Sarajevo on continued fighting between Muslims and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina despite the declaration of cease-fire states, "the Serbs hold 70 percent of Bosnia, and the Croats most of the rest" (news article, Sept. 19).
This is mistaken.
According to maps used by Lord Owen as a basis for negotiating a partition of the country, at the end of August, Bosnia was divided as follows: Serbs, 73 percent; Muslims, 17 percent; Croats, 10 percent.
The days when the Croats controlled most Bosnian territory that was not held by the Serbs are long gone.
Since last spring Muslim offensives have successfully wrested land away from the Croats.
Those offensives continue today and remain a major obstacle to the signing of a peace agreement.

Review/Music; Courting Ecstasy In Songs Of Pakistan
Toward the end of Abida Parveen's recital of mystical Sufi songs of Pakistan at Symphony Space on Saturday night, men were standing at the side of the hall, swaying and clapping with the beat; others were shouting "Allah!" in response to the singer's cues; still others rushed down the aisle tossing dollar bills on the stage in gratitude.
This was not inappropriate behavior.
The texts, some written by Sufi saints hundreds of years ago, were love poems in Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi and Seraiki that are meant to have mystical religious meanings.
They were similar in that respect to the erotic poetry of "The Song of Songs." The purpose of the music was not to provide pleasure (orthodox Islam, at any rate, frowns on such a secular use of music) but to lead the listener into a state of ecstasy and religious frenzy.

SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW: Tactics; Yeltsin Attack Strategy: Bursts Followed by Lulls
The assault on the Russian Parliament building today was a textbook example of the decisive application of military power.
But for all the firepower -- and the fires burning inside tonight showed that there was plenty -- the attack was punctuated by long lulls as the Russian military waited to see if the rebels would yield.
Strobe Talbott, the American Ambassador at Large to the former Soviet republics, said President Boris N. Yeltsin's aides had indicated that they considered two basic tactics: an all-out attack or a gradual operation that would give the anti-Yeltsin forces an opportunity to surrender.


Can 70 Million Fans Be Wrong?
However the numbers are calculated, major league baseball set an attendance record this season, belying the talk even within the sport that it is losing its popularity.
The commissioner's office confirmed yesterday that the total attendance was 70,257,938, 23.7 percent above the record of 56,813,760 set in 1991.
The total was bolstered by the addition of the Colorado Rockies (4,483,350) and the Florida Marlins (3,064,847) and by a change in the way the National League reported attendance this season.


Justices Turn Down Bail for One Officer In Rodney King Case
A police officer convicted of beating Rodney G. King failed today in his final bid to stay out of prison when the United States Supreme Court rejected his request to remain free on bail.
The officer, Laurence M. Powell, must now begin serving his two-and-one-half-year sentence on Oct. 12.
The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on a similar request for bail by the second officer convicted in the 1991 beating, Sgt.
Stacey C. Koon.

City Splits In Its View Of Accused In Beatings
This city has two images of Damian Williams, the man on trial in the beating of a white truck driver in last year's riot, and these images sometimes seem to have very little to do with each other.
To horrified television viewers, Mr.
Williams is a symbol of the unpredictable violence that menaces this city, the man prosecutors say was captured on videotape throwing a brick at the head of the driver, Reginald O. Denny, and then dancing a victory jig.
But for some black residents, the 20-year-old defendant also represents something else: society's unequal treatment of blacks and whites.

Gene Lamont, the Chicago White Sox manager, and the team's talented trainer, Herman Schneider, left no doubt that Thomas, the heavy favorite to win the league's most valuable player award, would be in the lineup against the Toronto Blue Jays in the playoff opener Tuesday night.
But Lamont left open the question of where Thomas would play.

Review/Film Festival; 3 Views of the Human Comedy and Otherwise
Anyone who has nursed a childhood obsession with a television program -- and who hasn't devoutly wished at one time to escape childhood growing pains by diving through the tube into a magical realm? -- should find a haunting resonance in Todd Haynes's half-hour film, "Dottie Gets Spanked."
The longest and most original of the three short films in the "Avant-Garde Visions" program of the New York Film Festival at 6 o'clock this evening, "Dottie Gets Spanked" observes the world through the eyes of a shy 6-year-old boy named Steven Gale (Evan Bonifant).
It is 1966 in suburban New York, and Steven has a fixation on a Lucy-like television star named Dottie Frank (Julie Halston).
His fervor is so all-consuming that his parents are beginning to worry.


O'Rourke Outlines Proposal to Increase Westchester Jobs
As the heated campaign for Westchester County executive entered its final month, Andrew P.

The sniping underscored the importance of white-collar jobs to Westchester voters, many of whom have been laid off by the struggling Fortune 500 companies that call the county home, including the International Business Machines Corporation.

In WPIX vs. MSG, Benches Have Cleared
Once upon a time, the MSG Network and WPIX-TV/Channel 11 got along quite nicely.
Their executives claimed to be friends.
They even had a three-year deal that made non-cable homes happy: MSG, which controls the rights to all 150 locally televised Yankees games, bought the time to put 50 of them on WPIX.
But that amity expired on Sept. 24.
Now, as hopes flicker that MSG and WPIX will make a new deal to keep Yankees games on free TV, war has broken out.
"They're making it impossible to make a deal," said Michael Eigner, general manager of WPIX.
Yesterday, he released a 31-page analysis of MSG's deal with the Yankees that WPIX says is irrefutable evidence of MSG's reluctance to make a deal with the station.
MSG called it all nonsense.


Passers Take Hits; Eagles Add O'Brien
Such National Football League quarterbacks as Randall Cunningham, Joe Montana, Bobby Hebert and Steve Young took batterings of various degrees Sunday.
Cunningham, the worst off of that group, will be sidelined 8 to 10 weeks, and the Philadelphia Eagles came to terms last night with former Jet Ken O'Brien to replace him on their roster.
Cunningham broke his left leg during the Eagles' 35-30 comeback victory over the Jets.
He flew to California yesterday for an 8 o'clock appointment this morning with Dr.
Clarence Shields, the orthopedist who in 1991 reconstructed Cunningham's left knee.

SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW: The Outlook; As Guns Fall Silent
The defeated leaders of the armed uprising against President Boris N. Yeltsin may not have had a broad popular base.
But the criticism leveled by these men, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi and Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, against Mr.
Yeltsin, his policies and his embrace of one-man rule has resonated with a broad swath of Russians who regard themselves as centrists.
This broad center reacted with disgust to the motley collection of Communists, ultranationalists, fascists, bully boys and anti-Semites who clustered around the Parliament's cause.
But while most Russians are surely relieved to have order restored, they did not stir themselves to rally for Mr.
Yeltsin.

Judging Suburban Nook By Its Used Hardcovers
THAT most aggravating of suburban phenomena, Saturday traffic, was building on the snaking streets of Westchester as families dispatched squadrons of minivans on errands.
The day was crisp, a hint of urgency in its chill.
In the parking lot of the Scarsdale Public Library, acorns popped and rattled off cars as gusts of wind ruffled the oaks along Post Road.
Inside the library, the initial rush was over.
The dealers who had lined up early, before the doors opened, had filled their cartons and taken away their booty, leaving the Scarsdale Book Fair to the amateurs, to the residents of Scarsdale, in many cases the same people who had donated the books.

The day that Boris Yeltsin climbed up on that tank a couple of years ago, the West cheered for joy, and made a great human and political error.
It is embarrassing to think about now, it was so intellectually and politically callous, so we don't.
For all their lives, the people imprisoned under Soviet Communism never read a free newspaper, voted in a free election, made a single free speech, or heard one.
They lived in a state whose captives knew that it was dangerous even to think.

A Singer Overcomes Success
Damon Evans, an actor and operatic tenor who sings tomorrow night on the "American Playhouse" and "Great Performances" presentation of "Porgy and Bess," is an exile from American fame.
In the 1970's, he had what seemed a tremendous stroke of luck: a job on the hit television series "The Jeffersons," playing the son, Lionel.
His three seasons in the employ of Norman Lear handily took care of his music-school tuition.
But he soon discovered that thanks to his television work, American opera companies did not take him seriously.
Now living in England, Mr.
Evans has found work mainly in countries where "The Jeffersons" is unknown.
Snobbishness is not the only obstacle Mr.
Evans faces.
He regularly runs into what he called in a telephone interview "the historically documented resistance to black men in classical music." American opera companies offer him minimum weekly contracts, pegged to particular roles like Sportin' Life in "Porgy and Bess." But he says there is still a general reluctance to engage black male singers for the long term.
In 1989 he turned down an offer from the Metropolitan Opera because it was connected only to the Gershwin opera.
"I am a total package," he said, adding, "I am not going to belittle myself or swallow my self-esteem." Mutual Suggestions
When Mr.
Evans went to England for the Glyndebourne Festival production of "Porgy," the one taped by PBS, he encountered no such problems.
Simon Rattle, the conductor, engaged him as Sportin' Life, then offered him other opportunities, starting with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The singer also found the working atmosphere to be more comfortable and constructive.
"After the first dress rehearsal, Simon had notes for us, suggestions on things we could do differently, and we had notes for him," Mr.
Evans said.
"He accepted them with humility."


Bob Michel's Quiet Leadership
It's not easy being minority leader of the House when your party has been in the minority for nearly 40 years.
Sooner or later, the troops get restless.
That may have something to do with Bob Michel's decision to retire as minority leader next year, at the end of the current Congress.
Representative Michel's stewardship was valuable to Presidents Reagan and Bush, helping to bridge differences between the Republican right and the majority Democrats.
But he kept such a low profile that Mr.
Reagan once called him "Michelle." (It's MY-kel, as in Michael.)


Treasury Vows a Review of S.&amp; L. Agency
Top officials of the Treasury Department, striking a conciliatory tone, promised today to follow up on the complaints of mismanagement at the Resolution Trust Corporation that have stalled the nomination of a new chief executive for the agency.
At a meeting of the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board, a Cabinet-level committee that supervises the agency, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman said they would review every charge made at a September hearing of the Senate Banking Committee, where 13 whistle-blowers testified about waste, fraud and mismanagement at the agency.


In Real-Estate Slump, Some Owners Are Donating Buildings
It sounds like a bad one-liner: The market for commercial real estate in New York City is so bad, they're giving it away.
But in isolated cases, it's true.
The latest example came last week, when a pair of Minnesota investors donated a 15-story office building at 30 West Broadway, in Manhattan's financial district, to the City University of New York.
In June, General Electric donated the 50-story Art Deco masterpiece at 570 Lexington Avenue, at 51st Street, to Columbia University.

Formally opening its 1993-94 term, the Court accepted nine new cases, including an appeal from a St.
Louis suburb that refused to permit a local resident to put up a sign expressing her opposition to the Persian Gulf war.
Two lower Federal courts ruled that the sign ordinance, imposed by Ladue, Mo., violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.

School in Red Hook Unfairly Maligned
To the Editor:
Re "In Defense of 'Bloody' Red Hook" by Brent Staples (Editorial Notebook, Sept. 24): During the school year 1992-93, approximately 20 employees of the children's book division of Random House served as volunteers at Public School 27 in Brooklyn's Red Hook section, which Mr.
Staples uses as counterpoint to Patrick Daly's Public School 15.


Bridge
The expert makes many subtle uses of the suit-preference signal, which often occurs after a different signal has been given in the same suit.
A good example is the diagramed deal from the International Team Trials played in June in Memphis.
East and West were Michael Becker and Ron Rubin, who defended a slightly optimistic contract of three no-trump.
East might have doubled two spades, to direct a lead, and that would have helped his partner.
But it might well have discouraged North-South from bidding game, and landed them in a safe part-score.


COMPANY NEWS: A Mill for High-Grade Pulp; Giving Recycled Paper A New Chance to Shine
Not many mills can turn the waste paper pouring out of the nation's offices into high-quality pulp for recycling.
That weak link in the recycling chain gets a little stronger today with the opening of Superior Recycled Fiber Industries' $76 million mill in Duluth, Minn.
"There are some larger plants that turn office waste into low- grade papers like tissue and some big higher-quality de-inking facilities attached to paper mills, but this will be the largest high-quality pulp producer for the open market," said Gerald Ostroski, president of Synertec Inc., which is Superior's majority owner.
Synertec is a subsidiary of the Minnesota Power and Light Company.

Nassau's Outside Agitator; Republicans Confront 'a Very Scary Guy' in Benjamin Zwirn
Last December, Nassau County was 24 hours from the deadline to pass a budget, and Supervisor Benjamin L. Zwirn, a Democrat, was resisting the latest Republican proposal, even though missing the deadline would mean a drop in the county's credit rating.
Angry about patronage positions, he was either playing a high-stakes game of chicken or was prepared to let the deficit-ridden county's financial position become even more precarious.

The Jets egos weren't the only things left battered and bruised by their 35-30 loss to the Eagles on Sunday.
Philadelphia inflicted a heavy toll on the Jets' roster, putting nine players on the injury list and dealing a severe blow to the Jets' offensive and defensive lines.
Ankle and foot injuries took their toll on five starters.
Center Jim Sweeney, who has started 130 straight games since 1984, sprained his ankle in the second quarter, and the Jets said he would be out for the next three to six weeks.
Starting defensive tackle Scott Mersereau is listed as out for the next two to four weeks with a similar injury.
Dwayne White, the starting right guard, is listed as doubtful for the next one to three weeks with an ankle injury.


30 ISRAELIS HURT BY SUICIDE BOMBER
A Palestinian driving a car packed with explosives blew himself up today in a suicide attack on an Israeli commuter bus outside the Israeli Army headquarters in the West Bank.
Thirty passengers were wounded; most wounds were slight, and none life-threatening.
But the number of casualties was the greatest since Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed an agreement three weeks ago that is supposed to lead to a transfer of authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Israeli to Palestinian hands.


SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW: World Reaction 1; European Leaders Support Yeltsin, Blaming His Foes for Bloodshed
European leaders rushed to express support for Boris N. Yeltsin today even after it became clear that there had been heavy bloodshed as military forces loyal to the Russian President attacked his opponents in the Parliament building.
Foreign ministers of the 12-nation European Community, meeting in Luxembourg, blamed "elements hostile to the democratization process" for the violence in Moscow and expressed support for Mr.
Yeltsin and "the process of reform."

Stocks Close Mixed, With Dow Easing 3.35
The stock market closed mixed yesterday, as many traders sat on the sidelines to focus on the political events in Russia, where opponents of President Boris N. Yeltsin surrendered after a weekend revolt.
"Investors were already nervous because of the valuation levels in the market and because of what happened in previous Octobers," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer of John Hancock Mutual Funds.
"Yesterday they waited to see how things played out in Russia and stocks traded in a very narrow range. Our phones were very quiet."

Navy Secretary John H. Dalton, who took office in July, had called for Admiral Kelso's removal as Chief of Naval Operations for failing to show proper leadership at a 1991 convention of naval aviators where 83 women were assaulted.

Michel, G.O.P. House Leader, to Retire
Representative Robert H. Michel, the House Republican leader, who has preferred consultation with Democrats to confrontation, announced today that he would retire after next year's election, a decision that could clear the way for the more combative style personified by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
The 70-year-old Mr.
Michel said at a news conference in Peoria, Ill., which he has represented since 1957, that Congress today lacked "camaraderie" and complained of House members who indulge in "trashing the institution."

Sales of U.S.-Made Vehicles Inch Up
Dragged down by weak sales by the General Motors Corporation, sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose slightly in late September, gaining only 6.2 percent over the corresponding period last year, when sales were slow.
G.M.'s problem appeared to stem more from supply than demand.
Slow plant retoolings to produce new models and faulty parts from suppliers caused G.M. to fall more than 70,000 units behind its third-quarter production goals, and dealers are feeling the shortfall.

He will be out for a minimum of 10 days and could miss the rest of the season.


Campbell &amp; Wagman Plans to Shut Down
Campbell &amp; Wagman Inc., a seven-year-old agency in Los Angeles, said yesterday that it had decided to close after determining that it would not participate in the review of its largest account, First Interstate Bancorp, with billings of $30 million.
"We were far too dependent on one client," said Craig Campbell, the agency's president, adding, "From a financial standpoint, it doesn't make sense to keep the agency open without First Interstate." He estimated the agency's other billings, from clients like the Italian Trade Commission and the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, at $5 million.


Atlanta Journal; Atlanta: The City Without a Slogan
The erstwhile "Gate City of the South," "Capital of the New South," "City too Busy to Hate," "Black Mecca" and "World's Next Great City" has a problem.
After a year of earnest groping and with Sydney, Australia, already selected as host of the 2000 Summer Olympics, Atlanta's best consultants and image meisters have yet to come up with just the right slogan to market their city before the world comes calling at the 1996 Olympics here.

"Governor Weicker and I have worked hard to provide leadership, and we have established a record of getting things done," Mrs.
Groark said at a news conference at the State Capitol.
"I believe for Connecticut to succeed that that leadership must continue."


Arts World: Many Tiny Economic Stars
For all the acknowledged importance of Broadway theater, Woody Allen's movies or a blockbuster show at the Museum of Modern Art, a new study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has found that the arts in New York exert their greatest economic impact through a myriad of far smaller and more obscure enterprises and organizations.
According to the comprehensive, yearlong research project, the arts and other cultural activities have grown substantially in importance over the last decade.
They now pump at least $9.8 billion a year into the New York metropolitan area and, directly and indirectly, support more than 107,000 jobs.
The arts directly employ some 41,000, appreciably more than the 36,000 employed in advertising.


Women Seeking Asylum
Do women who have been raped or have suffered other gender-related violence deserve special treatment when being considered for political asylum in the U.S.?
Their claims ought to be heard with more sensitivity than they often get now.
But increased sensitivity is possible without making gender a special category for asylum.
In this area of refugee protection, the U.S. might well look to Canada, which offers a reasonable model.
The U.S., like many other countries, has adopted internationally recognized standards for extending asylum to foreigners.
Those standards cover people who were persecuted in their homelands because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinions.
Persecution based on gender can be considered within these categories without carving out a new one.


Hopeful Start for Profit-Making Schools
A year ago, the Harlem Park Community School here seemed to represent the worst of what was wrong in public schools: graffiti covered the halls, crack vials littered the grounds, students did not have enough textbooks and, because the toilets did not work, the children sometimes defecated or urinated in stairwells.
Today, the building is clean, attendance has improved and, while it is too early to see conclusive results in test scores, there are early indications that students are learning faster than expected, and with more enthusiasm.
One mother, Pamela M. Brown, said last week: "A lot of the parents say their kids come home singing. Kids are excited about going to school." School Board Failure
The difference: Harlem Park and eight other Baltimore public schools have been taken over by a private company that runs them for profit.
The Baltimore City School District, unable for many reasons to improve the schools, ceded them to Education Alternatives Inc., which gets the same annual allotment for each student as the public schools -- $5,918 this year.


Review/Fashion; The Look in Milan: Easy
As the spring and summer fashion openings continue to unfold here, interest has begun to shift from the nature of the presentations to the clothes themselves.
There is a growing realization that the prime business of the showings here is the introduction of clothes that stores can sell and women can wear.
The styles that command the most attention are not the ones that rate high in shock appeal but those that make a smooth transition to fresh, new looks.
It is, at any rate, the fabrics of fashion that offer the most news.
They are mostly thin and fluid, with no hard edges.
Many are crushed, crumpled and slashed.
Fluidity is a key to the Emporio Armani collection.
This is something of a tour de force considering that Giorgio Armani's forte is tailoring.
The jackets skim over the body as if they are tunics, and they are paired with trousers with legs wide enough to continue the feeling of ease.
Sometimes there's a lace band at the wrists of a jacket where a cuff might be.
Sometimes there's a line of embroidery down the outside of the trouser legs, where a satin ribbon could be placed if they were dinner pants.
These details are worth mentioning only because there are so few of them.
All the styling is in the shape.

The call brought an end to the lawyer's long search for Mr.

Bellwether Area Cool to Whitman
If Middlesex County is any indication, and Middlesex County usually is, Christine Todd Whitman has run smack into a wall of voter skepticism in her bid to defeat Gov.

Here in the heart of New Jersey, in the blue-collar neighborhoods of Carteret and along the cheek-to-jowl strip malls of Route 1, Mrs.
Whitman's anti-Florio message and promises of economic reform seem to have fallen largely on disbelieving ears.


Study Ties Prostate Deaths to Animal Fat
AMERICAN men whose diets are rich in animal fats, and particularly fats from red meat, face nearly an 80 percent greater risk of developing potentially fatal prostate cancer than do men with the lowest intake of such foods, a major new study has found.
The study, which has been following the medical fates of more than 51,000 male health professionals since 1986, provides the strongest evidence yet linking dietary fat to the chances of dying of prostate cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men, after lung cancer.

Eating Well
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, who is shaping the Administration's health-care reform proposal, believes strongly that nutrition is an important part of health care.
For instance, she said yesterday through her spokeswoman that "good nutrition has proven health benefits and is one of the cheapest ways people can be more responsible about their health."
Because of her often-stated views, nutrition professionals eagerly awaited the specifics of the health-care reform plan last month, hoping to see Mrs.
Clinton's interest reflected.


Kruk Certainly Willing But Is the Slugger Able?
The lineup appeared out of nowhere.
It listed Ricky Jordan as the starting first baseman for the Phillies.
Manager Jim Fregosi, taken aback by the bogus lineup, said it was wrong.
John Kruk was going to be at first base.
The answer seemed definitive, but the odd sequence underlined the nervousness about the physical condition of the player who hit .316 for the Phillies in 1993.
Kruk injured his back last week and has been suffering from spasms since.
He said he'd play.
Fregosi tried to be more eloquent in that special way the Phillies have.

The account for Diet Coke advertising in English-speaking countries, estimated to be worth $95 million in annual billings, was moved from Lintas New York to Lowe &amp; Partners of New York.


Sports of The Times; Gloom On 2 Fronts For Chicago
THINGS were merely ominous for this city, what with the White Sox getting hammered in their first post-season game in 10 years.
And then came the truly miserable rumor that Michael Jordan just might be retiring.
He would not confront those rumors until a news conference scheduled for this morning, but from the pallor of the White Sox owners, who also happen to be the Bulls' owners, there was a grim look of truth to it.
Certainly nobody would deny the rumors.
Jordan is expected to tell people there are "no more challenges" after three straight championships.


Lemaire Is Putting New Life Into Devils
Two significant characteristics are the same as last season for the Devils: They have a new coach and they have a gap the size of the Grand Canyon at center.
But unlike last season, they are viewing one of those facts as a positive.
Coach Jacques Lemaire commands enormous respect among the players as a result of his accomplishments as a center for the Canadiens and because he is an advocate of simplicity.
The same cannot be said of Herb Brooks and his reign as the coach last season when some of the Devils claimed they got confused with Brooks's system.


National League Championship Matchup
ON THE MOUND Can They Get The Final Outs?
The rotation gave the revolution the club staged over the second half in the N.L.
West its momentum.
It's deep and often unmerciful, paid multi-millions to allow as close to nothing as possible.
The team's collective e.r.a. of 3.14 wasted the rest of the competition in the N.L.
Greg Maddux should win his second straight Cy Young Award, Tom Glavine won 20 games for the third straight season and Steve Avery has the most sinister stuff of all of them.
John Smoltz, the man with all the pitches and all too often the habit of wasting a great part of his talent, is a post-season deity in Atlanta.
He seems to find his zone when the October moonlight finds him on the mound.
Avery split his season record against the Phillies, his e.r.a. a full half a point higher versus Philadelphia than it was for the season.
He will also be facing the club's right-handed lineup, certainly its more lethal incarnation.
Maddux simply is the best pitcher in baseball at the moment.
He walks no one, gives up a hit every five innings or so and always takes his club deep into games.
Glavine, who has a mixed post-season resume at best, may enter the scene with the most to personally prove.
The bullpen, as almost virtually all in baseball are, is ordinary.
Mark Wohlers throws hard, but straight, and so is turning around a lot on the mound.
Kent Mercker never seems to throw strikes when he has to.
Steve Bedrosian and Jay Howell have been effective surprises.
But the Braves have not won the World Series the last two seasons because they never seemed able to get the final out.
Greg McMichael, barely invited to spring training, gets the invitation to make history for the Braves as the club's closer.
But the right-hander, whose out pitches are not strikes, has been awfully suspect after a summer-long run of fantasy finishes.
The Phillies, who have faced McMichael six tmes in 1993, stuck him with an 8.53 e.r.a.
At Least They're Healthy Conventional wisdom says the Phillies are at the wrong end of a mismatch in this department.
As usual, there's considerable truth to standard thinking.
The club's starters, a revelation over the first half, were often wounded and worked over across the team's uneven trek to October's promised land.
Tommy Greene has been hurt, and Terry Mulholland was once feared done for the season.
All are now available and certainly capable.
They may have to be much more.
Their track record, though, says the corps, one augmented Danny Jackson's left-handed presence, will give the Phillies innings, keep them close enough for there to be hope that the offensive engine will wear down the opposition.
Certainly, turning the games over to the bullpen will be a mortifying option.
The contingent of relievers, one the front office sought all season to improve and alter, was ranked 11th in the N.L.
They together amassed 24 blown saves.
The Phillies, not surprisingly, were a marginal 23-20 in one-run games.
Mitch Williams, the theoretical closer, is the perfect top man for a below average bullpen.
His final pitching line of the season about captured the perpetually potential downside to his dramatics: 1 IP, 1 hit, 2 runs, 2 walks, 2 wild pitches.
Advantage Braves IN THE FIELD Sometimes Vulnerable You don't win three straight division titles without a line of defense, and the fielding fortifications for the Braves got more imposing when McGriff was added.

Encyclical on Morality Doesn't Stifle Debate, Church Officials Say
Roman Catholic officials at the Vatican and in the United States presented Pope John Paul II's new encyclical, "Veritatis Splendor" ("The Splendor of Truth"), in very conciliatory tones today.
They insisted that his statement on fundamental moral theory was intended to encourage reflection and discussion of basic principles of morality, not to cut off debate.
"Early press coverage of the encyclical has implied its chief objective is to quell dissent," said the Rev.
Augustine DiNoia of Washington, who heads the office on theological doctrine for the American bishops' conference.
"This is a mistake. The encyclical is meant to invite a dialogue between theologians and bishops."

U.N. Says a 2d Serbian Siege Imperils 150,000
As Sarajevo marked 18 months under siege by Serbian nationalist forces today, United Nations officials said 150,000 people trapped by another, little-noticed Serbian siege were facing increasingly desperate conditions because Serbian forces have refused to allow any United Nations relief convoys to the area in more than four months.
The officials said reports from United Nations field officers in central Bosnia and accounts relayed by amateur radio operators inside the besieged pocket indicated that the only thing preventing widespread deaths from starvation in the region around the towns of Maglaj and Tesanj was the nightly airdrops of food by United States military aircraft.

"Radical New View of Role of Menstruation" (Science Times, Sept. 21) describes a new suggestion about the physiological purpose of menstruation.

Clinton Pitch on Health Takes Zigs and Zags
President Clinton's appearance at a picturesque park here today was staged with utmost care to take advantage of all of the things the Administration wanted to emphasize this week.
Most of the crowd was elderly and they all lived in California, a state that remains crucial to Mr.
Clinton's political success.
The topic was health care.
But after little more than half an hour of reassuring his audience that Medicare benefits would not be cut, the President apologized and ducked offstage to his waiting motorcade and rushed back to Washington to meet with his national security advisers on developments in Somalia, leaving a policy adviser, Ira C. Magaziner, behind.


Buttafuoco Admits to Sex With Amy Fisher
Joseph Buttafuoco admitted today what most of America had believed all along: that he had had an affair with Amy Fisher.
Dressed in a dark blue suit, a flamboyant floral tie and his signature black-and-white snakeskin cowboy boots, Mr.

In New York, the age of consent is 17.


Teachers' Pension Fund Asks for Diverse Boards
A big teachers' pension fund that is one of the country's largest investors issued new guidelines yesterday for companies in which it invests.
The guidelines call for an end to all-white and all-male boards but give companies leeway in deciding how, and how much, to pay executives.
The guidelines, issued by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and College Retirement Equities Fund, are the first such detailed description by a large institutional investor of its preferences and come at a time when shareholders are paying closer attention to how they can get companies to improve their performance.


Admiral Kelso Keeps His Command
In deciding not to sack Adm.
Frank B. Kelso 2d from his post as Chief of Naval Operations, Defense Secretary Les Aspin has made a decision based on politics, not principle.
By overruling Navy Secretary John H. Dalton's call to remove Admiral Kelso, Mr.
Aspin spared President Clinton further corrosion of his uneasy relationship with military brass.
Secretary Dalton held Admiral Kelso responsible for the events at Tailhook '91, the seamy Las Vegas convention of retired and active-duty naval aviators, and for the subsequent botched investigation.
"The deficiencies in the investigations," the Pentagon charged in its September 1992 report on the Navy's inquiry, "were the result of an attempt to limit the exposure of the Navy and senior Navy officials to criticism regarding Tailhook '91." In other words, the Navy was more interested in covering itself than in uncovering the truth.

Review/Theater: The Fiery Furnace; Sturdy Midwestern Women Making Compromises With Life
In "The Fiery Furnace," a new Circle Repertory Company production at the Lucille Lortel Theater, dear Julie Harris is the matriarch presiding over a cozy Wisconsin farmhouse kitchen of the 1950's.
Appliances and new miracle products like Reddi Wip are proliferating, promising a new age of homemaking ease.
A casserole is in the oven, the cookie jar is full and Ike is in the White House.
What possibly could be wrong with the picture?
Only everything, of course.
The glossy Brownie snapshot depicting the 1950's as a paradise of wholesome family bliss has long since been exposed as a sham.
Fittingly, Timothy Mason, the author of "The Fiery Furnace," wastes little time before taking a crowbar to the cheery facades once propagated by Life magazine and "Father Knows Best." When father knew best, women often knew depression, loneliness and a battery of other miseries, some of which would not have proper names until the feminist revolution arrived in the decades to come.

The Phillies and Braves Have Bullpens of Doubt
One is a cartoon character of a player.
The other is baseball's latest storybook creation.
Their jobs are to close games, and so an examination of Mitch Williams and Greg McMichael is not a bad way to open the debate on the National League Championship Series that begins Wednesday night between the Phillies and the Braves.
Williams, the Wild Thing who is anything but a sure thing, has got the haircut out of the 1970's and the fastball in the 90's and the brain that goes past the boiling point every now and then.
He never sees where half his pitches wind up, and his manager and teammates on the Phillies as often as not don't care to look.

Badillo and in part by the Republican-Liberal mayoral candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, focuses on two racially charged statements made last week.
In one, Eric Adams, the head of a black police officers group, said that if Mr.
Badillo were concerned about Hispanic people, he would have married a Hispanic woman.
Mr.
Badillo's wife is Jewish.
In the other, the Rev.
William H. Jones, the head of a Baptist ministers group, said Mr.
Giuliani was supported by "fascist elements."

Joseph Warren, a character actor who appeared in dozens of plays and films, died on Friday at the Village Nursing Home in Manhattan.

He had lived in the nursing home since suffering a stroke in 1990.


Columbus Day Again Looks Like a Holiday
At last, after months of politically charged disputes, Mayor David N. Dinkins and the New York City Board of Education have found something they can agree on: closing the schools on Columbus Day.
Only a month ago the Board of Education voted to hold classes for nearly a million schoolchildren on Columbus Day to make up some of the days lost to asbestos testing that delayed the opening of school by 11 days.


Second City Puts Jordan Feelings First
Like the patrons in the America's Bar on East Wacker Drive, the rest of Chicago was stunned tonight by the news that Michael Jordan will announce his retirement from basketball.

Review/Television; Two Law Series Return, With Some Revisions
Despite obvious drawbacks, a television formula can be a thing of wonder.
It depends on the talent and inventiveness of those doing the mixing from week to week.
Two rigidly formularized NBC series returning this season are proving to be in remarkably tiptop shape.
"Law and Order," Wednesdays at 10, is sharper and more provocative than ever.
"L.A. Law," Thursdays at 10, is showing its distinctive spunkiness again after being widely judged dead in the water for the last couple of seasons.
Created by Dick Wolf, "Law and Order" splits its weekly hour into two neat halves.
In the first, a crime is (or seems to be) committed and the police, primarily the detectives played by Jerry Orbach and Chris Noth, track down the perpetrators.
In the second, the district attorney's office takes over, and prosecutors -- portrayed by Michael Moriarty and, new this season, Jill Hennessy -- take the case to trial.
Actors come and go on the series: Mr.
Orbach replaced Paul Sorvino, who had replaced George Dzundza.
But the formula rarely budges.


Health Care Units To Merge at WPP
Two health care communications units of the WPP Group are merging.
The J. Walter Thompson Company's JWT Healthcare unit in New York will become an operating division of the Ferguson Communications Group in Parsippany, N.J.
Jack Stevens, who was chairman and chief executive at JWT Healthcare, will continue in those roles at the division, which has been renamed Deltakos; he will report to Thomas G. Ferguson, chairman and chief executive at Ferguson.
Thomas A. Vargas, who was senior vice president at Thomas Ferguson Associates, a Ferguson unit, joins Deltakos in the new position of president and chief operating officer, reporting to Mr.
Stevens.


Initiative on Northern Ireland Stirs Optimism
A new initiative by two of the most influential Roman Catholic leaders in Northern Ireland has led to a feeling of optimism among many that fresh negotiations could get under way soon to try to resolve the sectarian violence that has killed more than 3,000 people in the last 25 years.
Ten days after the initiative was announced, political leaders, diplomats and academic analysts agree that for the first time since the early 1970's a process is underway that seems to be leading to negotiations involving the Irish and British Governments and the outlawed Irish Republican Army, through its political wing, Sinn Fein.


Dow Gains 9.50 Points in Anxious Trading
Stocks were mixed yesterday in heavy trading, and the Dow Jones industrial average was the only one of the three most widely watched market indicators to close with a gain.
The Dow rose 9.50 points, to 3,587.26.
But the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.14 point, to 461.20, and the Nasdaq index retreated 2.57 points, to 762.27.


Mexico City Journal; 1968, Soaked in Student Blood, Refuses to Fade
Francisco Buendia was not born when angry students shook this city with demonstrations as it prepared to be host to the 1968 Olympic Games.
Although he looks something like a throwback in shredded jeans and long hair, he conceded that he was not much of a counterculturalist, either.
"I agree with the economic modernization of this country," Mr.
Buendia, 20, a student, said, lowering his voice lest other protesters overhear him.
Referring to accords that Mexico has signed with Canada and the United States, he added, "I'm probably one of the only people here who supports the free-trade agreement."

LOAN GUARANTEES FOR ISRAEL ARE CUT
The Clinton Administration has slashed the loan guarantees that it will give Israel next year because of Israel's continued settlement in the occupied territories and its disputed construction in East Jerusalem, officials here said today.
Instead of receiving guarantees on $2 billion, Israel will have to settle for assurances on less than $1.6 billion.
In all, the officials said, the Administration has recommended to Congress that $437 million be sliced from the program, a dollar-for-dollar penalty because of Israeli spending on settlements in the territories.

Stop Subsidizing Arm Sales Abroad
As the cold war recedes, America's need for weapons will inevitably decline.
Military contractors worried about the loss of business have come up with the wrong answer: Sell more arms abroad.
The U.S. increasingly dominates the shrinking world market in arms sales, amassing a 60 percent market share in the third world last year.
But that's not good enough for the contractors.
They want Congress to back $1 billion in Government loan guarantees, subsidizing arms makers who market their wares to foreigners on credit.

Witness Says He Saw Yellow Van Just Before Blast
In a surprise eyewitness account, a Secret Service agent testified yesterday at the World Trade Center bombing trial that he spotted a yellow van parked in the trade center garage just before he was knocked unconscious by a violent blast.
Prosecutors have said that the bomb was contained in a yellow Ryder rental van.
But under hammering cross-examination by defense lawyers, the witness, Jan Gilhooly, acknowledged that he had not mentioned the crucial sighting to investigators who interviewed him a day after the Feb. 26 explosion and that he first told prosecutors about it on Monday night.

A.M.A. Says Compromise Is Possible on Budgets
The American Medical Association soft-pedaled its unhappiness with parts of President Clinton's health plan in Senate testimony today, saying it could even agree to overall national health care budgets if doctors were involved in setting them.
Meanwhile, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, faced a flurry of questions today when she appeared in two House hearings.
She said the Administration would deliver its bill in two weeks, in answer to Republicans who repeatedly complained that it was hard to focus on an unfinished proposal.


Rice Continues Its Surge On Talk of Japan Purchases
Prices for rice futures contracts at the Mid-America Commodity Exchange hit their upward limit today for the third time in a week, driven by excitement over prospects that Japan will import rice from the United States this year for the first time since 1975.
The November contract quickly rose to $8.25 a bushel, up the 45-cent limit, and stayed at that price until the close as traders with short positions scrambled to limit their losses in the face of the strong buying.


Somali General Denounces Further Peace Talks
After the fiercest battle between United Nations and Somali forces in Mogadishu, Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, the fugitive clan leader, said in a radio broadcast Monday night that he would no longer take part in any peace talks and urged Somalis to defend themselves against United Nations "colonialism."
General Aidid, who has been in hiding since June 17, warned the United Nations that bringing in more troops "would not serve peace but worsen the situation," the Italian News Agency ANSA reported.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Turner officials pull back from allowing CNN to run commercials that imitate news interviews.
THE Turner Broadcasting System considered, but rejected, plans to run commercials that resemble segments of news interview programs on its CNN and Headline News cable television networks.
Since CNN began operations in 1980, followed by Headline News a year later, Turner's policies have prohibited carrying sales pitches that imitate programming.
The rationale was that viewers might be confused because such paid messages could blur the line between news content and advertising.


Baby's Painful 2 Years of Life Highlight the High Cost of Futile Medical Care
Portia Davis sits strapped in a wheelchair at the Hospital for Sick Children in Washington, a feeding tube passing through her nose.
Her tiny, pointed head jerks mildly as she passes from seizure to seizure, small convulsive shivers with barely a break in between.
She is 2 years old now and, medical experts say, neurologically devastated.
She has virtually no brain, and although her eyes are open she is completely unresponsive and unaware of her surroundings.
Doctors say she has no prospects for improvement.


Two Who Survived Tell Of Euphoria, and Fear
It wasn't until he emerged from the Russian Parliament at 5:10 P.M. on Monday afternoon that Aleksei Vorobyov realized that the top half of the building was on fire.
All day, he and his colleague, Tatyana Romanenkova, both correspondents for the Russian Parliament's now-defunct newspaper, had heard the sound of automatic gunfire, coming from inside and outside the building.
They had watched as the tanks and armored personel carriers surrounding the White House, as the Parliament building is known, opened fire.
But until the end they were convinced the big guns were firing not shells, but blanks.

The Loneliness of the One-Mushroom Pasta Sauce
SO many kinds of mushrooms are in the markets today, even in ordinary supermarkets, that it is easy to find more than just the standard white variety.
Which is great for pasta dishes, since a variety of mushrooms will play off one another and enhance the otherwise subtle taste of a one-mushroom sauce.
I have seen this dish made with many pasta shapes, but my favorite is pappardelle, available at some Italian markets.
It laps up the sauce so nicely.
If you can't find it, use whatever fresh pasta is available.
To add sharpness to this mild and sweet dish, the salad contains some flavorful black olives.
The dinner will take less than 30 minutes to prepare.


Short Gains an Edge, But a Victory? Not Yet.
Careful, conservative play by Nigel Short brought him to an effortless draw yesterday in London in Game 13 of his world championship match with Gary Kasparov.
In fact, toward the end the Englishman had a slight advantage and was trying to make it count, but the Russian was diligent in restraining him.
The score is now Kasparov 9, Short 4.
This means that 3 1/2 more points will suffice for Kasparov to gain the $1.43 million winner's share of the $2.55 million purse.
But even after a winner is determined, the players are to complete the 24-game series.

Charlotte Signs Johnson for $84 Million
In what the Charlotte Hornets are calling the biggest deal in league history, LARRY JOHNSON signed a contract yesterday that is believed to be worth $84 million over 12 years.
"He's the leader of this team, and he will always be the leader of this team," Hornets owner GEORGE SHINN said of the third-year player who was voted rookie of the year for 1991-92 and made the all-star team last season, averaging 22.1 points and 10.5 rebounds a game.
The Hornets would not confirm terms of Johnson's contract. (AP)

Food Notes
Health Food Branch
Commodities, the well-stocked health food supermarket at 117 Hudson Street (at North Moore Street), has opened a branch called Commodities East at 165 First Avenue (10th Street).
Unlike most health-food stores, Commodities emphasizes food, not dietary supplements.
While smaller than the original store, Commodities East is extremely well stocked with packaged foods, most of them made with organic ingredients.
Anything that is not organic must be all natural and have no refined sugar.
Grains and pastas are sold in bulk, and there is a good selection of dairy products and frozen prepared foods.
The array of produce is also attractive, with prices similar to those for nonorganic items at corner markets.

Fleeing Literary Limelight for Calm Obscurity
Denmark's most successful author since Isak Dinesen is a 36-year-old former ballet dancer named Peter Hoeg who owns no television set, telephone or car and whose idea of a bad time is having to appear in public.
"It's not like I'm a pop star or an actor having to be in the limelight all the time," said Mr.

"I've been in obscurity for the past two years, and I will return to obscurity again."


Einstein Changed World on Office Time
To the Editor:
Yes, Albert Einstein used a pen while working on his theory of relativity (letter, Sept. 25).
However, the famous physicist was working at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, not the post office.
I corresponded more than 50 years ago with one of Einstein's former colleagues, who later rose to the rank of director, in relation to my uncle, who had worked under him.
The letter related to me that my correspondent's superior and fellow workers were well aware that Einstein was working on a private project, hiding it under papers of patent applications, which he had been assigned to work on.
Guessing that he was working on something important, nobody in the office intervened.

Rabin and Arafat to Discuss Details
In yet another sign of how the once unthinkable is fast approaching Middle East routine, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat will meet in Cairo on Wednesday, the first official encounter of substance by an Israeli Prime Minister and the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
In contrast to the symbolic power of these men's famous handshake at the White House on Sept. 13, the meeting this time is billed as more of a nuts-and-bolts session: how to crank up negotiations on translating from principle to reality an agreement to introduce Palestinian self-rule to Israeli-occupied territories, starting in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho.


A Search for Words to Mourn Troops Who Died in Somalia
Nine days have passed since the Rev.
Thomas Jackson got the news, but he is still unsure about what he will say at the memorial service for Sgt.
Eugene Williams at New Original Church of God in Christ on Friday.
Will the pastor say Sergeant Williams was a God-fearing young man who loved his country and honored his parents?
Of course.
That's obvious from the way the 26-year-old soldier died.
He was killed when his Army helicopter was shot down over Mogadishu by Somalian militia fighters on Sept. 25.

In America; The Echoes of Bushwick
Nobody talks much about Bushwick.
It's just a tired, old, poverty-racked neighborhood in Brooklyn where adults without jobs move listlessly from one boring day to the next, and the police have to close off streets to slow the high-energy encroachment of youthful drug dealers, and the children, of whom there are many, find it difficult to dream because their days and their nights are so often disturbed by the sound of gunfire.
The kids in Bushwick grow up knowing that life is a crapshoot, which means you may not grow up at all.
The walls of many buildings are covered with huge and disturbing murals -- elaborate graffiti memorials to friends and playmates who died from a bullet to the head, a knife in the heart, and so on.


Bally of Switzerland Picks DDB Needham
Bally of Switzerland, the maker and retailer of shoes, leather goods and fashion accessories, has selected DDB Needham Worldwide in New York to handle its global account, the agency said.

SENATORS CRITICIZE BOSNIA AID PLAN
Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee expressed reservations today about the Clinton Administration's plan to dispatch 25,000 American troops to the Balkans.
Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who is the committee chairman, said he opposed an arrangement under which the United States would supply almost half of the peacekeepers of an international force in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"It's just too high a proportion of the 50,000 total," he said.
"I think what's in Somalia is correct, where about a fourth or a fifth of the troops are American."

The Man in the Middle: A Trusted Military Aide
Among the security ministers clustered with President Boris N. Yeltsin on Sunday night, pondering how to quell the armed uprising that was taking place at the Parliament center, the Mayor's office, and the television center, Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev was the key official.
Not only was he the senior military officer, who knew best which army units could be trusted to stay loyal to the Kremlin, and the man who would have to organize and order the actual assault.

Fortunately for Guzman, Olerud and Molitor are on his team.
Despite Guzman's eight walks, three wild pitches and one hit batter in a bizarre six-inning performance, the Toronto Blue Jays thumped the Chicago White Sox, 7-3, in the home team's first post-season game in 10 years.


White Supremacists Investigated In 4 Firebombings in Sacramento
The house of a Chinese-American City Councilman was firebombed early this morning, and law-enforcement officials say they are investigating whether the bombing and three other recent attacks against minority targets here are the work of a new white supremacy group.
The police said a man identifying himself as a member of a group called the Aryan Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the bombing of the house of the Councilman, Jimmie Yee.


Bourque Arbitrator Rules for Bruins
In what must be considered a major victory for the Boston Bruins, and National Hockey League owners in general, a league arbitrator yesterday awarded veteran Boston defenseman Ray Bourque $2.25 million for the 1993-94 season, $2 million less than he had requested of the team.
The ruling, made by arbitrator Richard Bloch early yesterday evening, capped a tense period for the Bruins, who arrived at Madison Square Garden last night for their season opener against the Rangers.

No. 1 Tune: Accentuate Ingredients
EXPERIENCED cooks understand that a good dish depends more on selecting fine ingredients and using them with respect than on slavishly following a recipe.
As diverse as the latest cookbooks and food books may be -- the subjects include American, French, Italian and Chinese cuisines plus baking, vegetarian dishes and snacks -- they all sing this refrain.
Sometimes the tune is subtle; other times it provides an incessant, foot-stomping beat.
But it's worth knowing by heart.
The uncompromising cook who finds time at a premium should find ample inspiration in this crop of books along with advice about how to select and care for ingredients.

WORLD MORATORIUM ON NUCLEAR TESTS IS BROKEN BY CHINA
Rejecting a plea from President Clinton, China exploded a nuclear weapon at a test site beneath its western desert today, breaking an informal testing moratorium.
In response, the Administration ordered preparations for a resumption of American tests.
"The United States deeply regrets this action," Mr.
Clinton said in a statement issued this morning after receiving reports that the Chinese had set off a nuclear device in Xinjiang province.
Mr.
Clinton added that he had "directed the Department of Energy to take such actions as are needed to put the U.S. in a position to be able to conduct nuclear tests next year."


Review/Opera; Mozart's Magic Spell, Cast in Bright Colors
The Metropolitan Opera's production of "Die Zauberflote" returned to the house on Monday evening, with its brightly colored storybook sets by David Hockney and a cast of singers so fully in tune with the work's style and substance as to make the passions of Mozart's magical world ring consistently true.
For singers and directors, "Die Zauberflote" is a peculiar balancing act.
Its comic elements are meant to be farcical rather than subtle, yet the opera's main business is to describe the rite of passage from the reactive, egocentric world of childhood to the responsibilities and interactions of a fully adult world.
The path between them is one of spiritual introspection, but even the work's symbolic trials are surrounded by a frivolous filigree of comic vignettes.


Claim by Ex-Army Coach Is Turned Down
The United States Military Academy has rejected a claim by fired basketball coach TOM MILLER for $318,534 in lost salary and benefits.
West Point Athletic Director AL VANDERBUSH turned down the claim in a letter dated Sept. 21.
Vanderbush was supported by the university's top brass.
"It was the athletic director's determination that Coach Miller failed to contribute to the academy's leadership development process after he was counseled that his behavior was unacceptable," Lieut.
Col.
DON McGRATH, an Army spokesman, said.

The Deepest Dive Yet For Gulf of Mexico Oil
The Shell Oil Company announced yesterday that it would spend $1.2 billion to bring into production a giant oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico, a project intended to push offshore-recovery technology to the deepest levels yet and to create 2,200 jobs, most in Texas and Louisiana, and thousands more among subcontractors in 34 states.
The announcement, made in Houston, was welcome news to the domestic oil industry, which in the last year has seen its drilling activity at the lowest level in decades amid falling prices for crude oil and a slowdown in the rate of increased demand for gasoline and other petroleum products.


Group by Group, Dinkins Seeks to Unite Support
Mayor David N. Dinkins went to the Upper West Side one morning last week to mingle with ordinary New Yorkers -- an endeavor that often produces a spontaneity that can be at odds with Mr.

A middle-aged man approached the Mayor, asked him what he was doing next Saturday and then invited him to his son's bar mitzvah.
"I'll see if I can make it," the Mayor said politely.


60-Minute Gourmet
MANY foods can be given a compelling new texture by coating them with something crunchy like seasoned bread crumbs, crushed nuts or sesame seeds.
I recently bought some Cornish hens and decided to crush some toasted pecans for a coating.
Pecans are perfect for this kind of cooking because they are delightfully sweet, and having more moisture than most nuts, they blend well in sauces.
If you are going to broil the hens, flattening them will allow them to cook evenly and the coating will stay on.
Before applying the coating, wet the hens with a thick sauce that will adhere to the surface.
The recipe here calls for a zesty sauce that combines Dijon mustard, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce.
For part of the cooking time, the hens are cooked with just the sauce on them, because the pecans would burn if they were added at the beginning.

In a move that reflects an unexpected change of sentiment in the municipal bond industry, the Public Securities Association called on municipal bond dealers yesterday to stop making political contributions to state and local officials or candidates for government office in hopes of winning underwriting business.
The moratorium would be in effect until Federal regulators finish approving new restrictions on political contributions by bond dealers.

Hurricanes Are Seeing Red Over That Big Point Spread
A six-foot-high sign hangs in the University of Miami football locker room.
On it is the number 14.
That's the amount of points by which some oddsmakers have favored Florida State University to defeat the Hurricanes on Saturday in Tallahassee.
And it's a source of outrage among Miami's players.


Rams' Henley Gets a Leave of Absence
Los Angeles Rams starting cornerback DARRYL HENLEY, reportedly under Federal investigation for his alleged role in a cocaine-distribution ring, has been granted an indefinite leave of absence from the team.
The Rams issued a statement yesterday, saying Henley had been granted a leave of absence and that they would have no further comment.
A day earlier, the team confirmed that Henley is under investigation for drug trafficking.
"We have been aware for sometime of an ongoing investigation involving various individuals as well as Darryl Henley and a former Rams cheerleader," said JOHN SHAW, Rams executive vice president.


Review/Fashion; A Few Artisans Try To Blow the Socks Off
The modern woman, as she is cast on Milan's runways, rolls out of bed with greasy hair, pulls on her boyfriend's white cotton briefs, a thinning T-shirt that barely covers the tops of her thighs, black ankle socks and her father's loafers, and goes to face the world.
Some of this city's most directional designers -- the pack led by Prada -- are working so hard at creating a woman bored by fashion that it's getting pretty boring for everyone else.
Not that there isn't an important message in disinterested dressing.
It's just been going on too long and is now being done entirely too convincingly.
What is not working here -- never has worked, really -- is back-to-basics masquerading as a runway show.
Designers need to make their peace with fashion and start creating beautiful clothes again.


A Passage to Playoffs Through N.F.C. East
When the Jets get down to the last month of the season, they may look back at last Sunday's 35-30 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles with regret.
For the Jets (2-2), the path to the playoffs goes through the heart of the National Conference East.
They will play an "away" game against the Giants on Oct. 31, then have back-to-back games against Washington and Dallas in December.
Besides the fact that the Jets need as many early victories as possible -- and failed to get one against Philadelphia -- they will probably need to win at least two of their three remaining games against N.F.C.
East opponents to have a shot at winning the their division.
In that respect Buffalo, which is tied with Miami in the American Conference East with a 3-1 record, has already defeated two N.F.C.
East opponents -- Dallas and the Giants.

Review/Film Festival: Ruby in Paradise; Starting a New Life in Florida And Keeping a Diary as She Goes
The best news about tonight's program at the New York Film Festival comes first: "Excursions to the Bridge of Friendship," an irresistible 12-minute Australian short presented without dialogue.
The film's dreadfully pertinent soundtrack consists of wailing, clanging music heard steadily in the background.
The caterwauling highlights the efforts of a Bulgarian folk singer to bring her artistry to Australia, with the help of a reluctant would-be entrepreneur who imagines glowing headlines ("Cultural Visionary Brings Unique Sound to Sydney") should the plan succeed.
Presented in crisp, funny black-and-white images, it is replete with droll subtitles ("Meanwhile, back in the Balkans") and widespread expressions of dismay on all sides.
Christina Andreef, whose cast includes Genevieve Lemon of "Sweetie," shows firm control of her off-the-wall subject and a witty, wonderfully inventive visual style.
Like Jane Campion, who is thanked in this short film's credits, she displays a memorably skewed world view.

CLINTON REVIEWS POLICY IN SOMALIA AS UNEASE GROWS
President Clinton met with his top advisers tonight to review the American role in the international military operation in Somalia.
He sought to balance the need to remain in Somalia to recover American hostages with mounting calls from Congress for a clear withdrawal strategy and the President's own goal of putting Somalia on the road to recovery.
After a 90-minute meeting, during which the President reviewed options ranging from a quick pullout to a large-scale buildup of American forces in Somalia, Mr.
Clinton told his aides he wanted to think more about the alternatives and asked them to reconvene Wednesday morning.


Critic's Notebook; Upstart and Formal Styles in Montreal
Modern dance from Britain, admittedly in a selective overview, has pride of place at this year's International Festival of New Dance in Montreal.
But already in the first week of the eight-year-old festival, which is presenting 27 companies from seven countries through Oct. 9, the lively Belgian dance scene has, as in the past, come to the fore here.
A fine showing in this respect came from Annamirl van der Pluijm, a Dutch soloist who has continued to work in Belgium after performing there with Jan Fabre's movement-theater troupe, and from the Michele Anne De Mey Company, headed by an original member of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's group.

Bridge
Once each year somebody, somewhere, seems to uncover an ending unlike anything seen before.
The diagramed deal played in a regional tournament in Sturbridge, Mass., is the candidate for 1993.
It was worth "only" an overtrick for the declarer, Bob Jones of Auburndale, Queens, but since it was a pairs contest the overtrick was worth many match points.
The auction proceeded briskly to three no-trump, and West led a spade, his partner's suit.
East put up the king and when South dropped the nine he cashed the ace, giving the declarer some help.
He then shifted to a diamond, and South could have settled for 10 tricks by finessing.
Instead he put up the ace and tried for 11 tricks.
He could have succeeded by cashing two club winners, since the jack falls doubleton and the hearts split evenly, but that would have been foolish play.


Hearing for Troubled Man to Be Dropped
The lawyer for Larry Hogue, the mentally ill, homeless man who for years menaced residents of the Upper West Side, said yesterday that he would withdraw his request for a competency hearing and try to persuade prosecutors to get his client medical treatment instead.
The lawyer, C. Vernon Mason, said he planned to go to court Thursday and withdraw his request for a hearing to determine whether Mr.
Hogue, 49, is competent to stand trial on charges of criminal mischief and possession of a controlled substance.
Mr.
Hogue was scheduled to return to Manhattan Criminal Court Oct. 25.


No $33.5 Million Deal for Coleman
The attorney for Derrick Coleman said that contract negotiations between Coleman and the Nets broke down yesterday after the star forward rejected the team's latest offer, $33.5 million over five years.
If he does not sign a new contract, Coleman will become a restricted free agent after this season and could become an unrestricted free agent following the 1994-95 season.

Ex-Manager of House Bank Accepts Plea Deal and Admits Embezzlement
Two years after the House bank scandal created deep political embarrassment for dozens of lawmakers, the Justice Department today filed the first formal charges of wrongdoing in the affair, accusing the bank's former manager of embezzling $75,300.
In a plea agreement with the Government that was made public today, the former official, Jack Russ, who supervised the House bank until he was forced to resign in March 1992, admitted that he committed three felonies, including cashing 17 checks at the bank even though he knew his account was overdrawn.
Mr.
Russ is scheduled to formally enter his plea in Federal District Court here on Wednesday.


Corrections
An article and a headline on March 22 about the debate over the costs and benefits of efforts to control acid rain, using South Carolina as an example, referred incorrectly to the makeup of the state's rainfall.
Although there is debate over the extent of damage from the acidity, there is a scientific consensus that South Carolina indeed has acid rain.
Increasingly detailed letters from readers over several months have pointed out the error; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

Because of an editing error, a "Political Memo" article on Sunday, about the political effects of the Mollen Commission's investigation of police corruption, referred incorrectly to the aftermath of televised comments by Eric Adams, head of an organization of black police officers.
Mr.
Adams urged supporters of Mr.
Dinkins to cast ballots, saying that otherwise "we are going to have to consider arming ourselves with bullets to prevent the lynch mob mentality that is coming from this kind of Republican administration."
At a news conference outside City Hall by members of a police fraternal organization called New York Shields, white officers argued that Mr.
Adams's violent oratory was worse than the corruption of Michael Dowd, a former drug-dealing officer who had testified to the commission.
But black officers who were watching disagreed.

Injury Puts Pacers' Miller Out of Action
REGGIE MILLER, the Indiana Pacers' leading scorer the past four seasons, severely sprained his left ankle in a pickup game and will be sidelined for at least half the preseason.
Miller, the National Basketball Association's leader in consecutive regular-season starts (339), probably will be ready for the Nov. 5 season opener at Atlanta.
The 6-foot-7-inch guard injured the ankle Sept. 24 and recovery will take four to six weeks from that date, Pacers trainer DAVID CRAIG said.


Review/Film Festival; A Taiwan Artist Tells His Island's Story Obliquely
The work of Hou Hsiao-hsien, Taiwan's premier film maker, has been turning up regularly at American festivals since "A Summer at Grandpa's" was shown in the 1986 New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art.
With his very fine new film, "The Puppetmaster," Mr.
Hou has come into full control of his talents.
He's an artist who has absorbed all the outside influences he needs and is now speaking with his own voice.
It's a clear, assertive voice, though not exactly loud, which wouldn't be in character either for the director or for his subject.
"The Puppetmaster" will be shown at the New York Film Festival at 6:15 P.M. today and at 9 P.M. tomorrow.


Gerald J. Carroll, 46, Navy Pilot and Author
Gerald J. Carroll, a decorated naval pilot who wrote two novels based on his experiences in Vietnam, died on Thursday at his home in Leonardtown, Md.

Office Towers in 42d St. Project May Be Getting Taller
While public attention has focused on an interim plan to rehabilitate 42d Street with honky-tonk flourishes, New York State officials have also been considering changes to the longer-term redevelopment plan that could lead to office towers far taller than previously envisioned.
For instance, the skyscraper planned on the site of Nathan's Famous restaurant, at Broadway and 43d Street, would grow to 895 feet from 750 feet.
That would make it the eighth tallest building in New York City -- two and a half times taller than One Times Square Plaza, where the ball drops on New Year's Eve.


Jordan, N.B.A.'s Greatest Star, To Announce Retirement Today
Michael Jordan, the Chicago Bulls' superstar who is among the most recognized figures in professional sports, will announce his retirement from basketball today, according to a front-office official of the Bulls.
The team has scheduled a news conference for this morning at its practice facility in Deerfield, a Chicago suburb, to make the announcement.


Sweetness Rewarded In a Tasting
IN a photo finish, an opulent dessert wine was voted No. 1 in this year's New York State wine competition.
A Knapp 1991 late-harvest vignoles ($17.95) won by one point over a 1989 blanc de blancs sparkling wine from Glenora ($14.99), made from chardonnay and pinot blanc grapes.
Both wines are from the Finger Lakes.
Bedell's '90 merlot reserve ($22) from Long Island placed third, and the '92 semi-dry riesling from Lucas ($7.50) in the Finger Lakes region was fourth.


Nynex Seeks Diversity as Core Business Ebbs
The Nynex Corporation's decision to invest $1.2 billion in the entertainment industry is based on a strategy the company began devising in February 1992.
It was 18 months ago that executives of the regional Bell company met to assess the future, in light of stalled growth in the local telephone business, which brings in 86 cents of every dollar of Nynex revenue.


Suddenly It's Spring Again: Rangers Lose
Booed the last time they left the Madison Square Garden ice last spring, the Rangers returned last night with an abundance of enthusiasm, an excess of adrenaline, and more than a few butterflies.
After a remarkably short amount of time, the enthusiasm had waned, the adrenaline disappeared and the butterflies had taken charge.


Reinforcements For U.S. Troops Delayed 9 Hours
American and other United Nations reinforcements took more than nine hours Sunday to reach United States Army Rangers holding off hundreds of heavily armed Somalis, and the delay contributed directly to the deaths of at least a dozen American soldiers, Pentagon officials said today.
The American component of the rescue team, the Quick Response Force, did not have the proper equipment, and their Pakistani and Malaysian counterparts did not have the training or the orders to prepare quickly for a rescue, the officials said. 'Routine' Mission
Pentagon officials said the raid by the Rangers should have been a routine search-and-seizure mission.
How it ended in a fiery debacle is a story of bad luck, faulty intelligence and poor planning, said American and United Nations military officials in Washington and Mogadishu who are still piecing the story together.


Another Great Year for Paris's Vintage
THE 1993 vintage has not generally been much of a success in France.

Abuse-Prevention Efforts Aid Children
THE first national survey to assess the effectiveness of school-based programs to prevent sexual abuse confirms that they help children in real-life encounters with potential child molesters.
Such programs have become increasingly common in recent years.
A 1990 study found that 85 percent of elementary school districts surveyed offered such courses, with 64 percent mandating them.
But little research had been done on their effectiveness.


On the Plains, a Huge Rail Yard Starts to Hum
Day and night, freight trains up to one and a half miles long rumble past Buffalo Bill Cody's ranch on the outskirts of town and into the world's biggest railroad yard in a rhythm that seems to gauge the nation's economic pulse more plausibly than any Government statistic.
More than half of Union Pacific's traffic moves through the Bailey Yard, a web of 250 miles of track and 800 switches on which cars from all directions pause briefly in cross-country treks carrying plywood, tires, sugar, bicycles, grain and a myriad of other raw materials and manufactures.


What It Will Take to Develop the Super-Car
In recruiting the nation's weapons labs to help create an environmentally correct super-automobile, the Clinton Administration is seeking to protect the American right to a private car.
But the 10-year cooperative project by the Government and Detroit, announced last week, will require radically new technologies for solving the American auto industry's longstanding problems: air pollution, overreliance on imported oil and loss of market share to imports.


WHITE HOUSE TRIES TO CALM CONGRESS
A wave of hostility toward the military operation in Somalia swept Congress today, forcing the White House to send two Cabinet secretaries to Capitol Hill to try to calm critics and plead for additional time to formulate a new policy.
"It's Vietnam all over again," said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who is in a group of conservatives calling for quick withdrawal from Somalia.
"There's no education in a second kick of a mule."


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY  MAYORAL RACE IS A TOSSUP
Four weeks before Election Day, the race between Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani remains a tossup.
Fewer than half of voters trust either candidate to deal with New York City's problems and nearly half are concerned that each might make serious mistakes, according to the latest New York Times / WCBS-TV News poll.

New Rules Ease Disclosure of U.S. Data
The Clinton Administration said Monday that it had changed the rules for disclosing Government information to reporters, historians and the public by making it easier for the Government to release its records under the Freedom of Information Act.
Officials from the White House and the Justice Department said the Administration had rescinded a 1981 rule that directed all Federal agencies to withhold information whenever there was "a substantial legal basis" for doing so.
The rule was written by the Reagan Administration.


Clinton to Visit New Jersey
President Clinton will visit New Jersey on Friday to trumpet his health-care proposals, a spokeswoman for Gov.
Jim Florio said today.
The spokeswoman, Audrey Kelly, said the President would make a policy speech during a visit to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick and the Governor would appear with him.
Though the speech falls in the final weeks of a tough re-election campaign for Mr.
Florio, his aides insist that the President's visit is not political.
"He will be talking about health care reform the Governor has put forth and how we in New Jersey can assist in developing national health care policy," Ms.
Kelly said.
"The President probably will also touch again on how crime affects health care costs."


Giuliani Ads Accuse Dinkins of Using Race Issue
Rudolph W. Giuliani, using his wife and a running mate as surrogates, unleashed new television advertisements yesterday that accuse the Dinkins campaign of playing up the issue of race to distract from questions about the Mayor's competence.
The ad campaign began as Mr.
Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, virtually completed raising the $8 million he is allowed to spend in the race, freeing him to move into a more intense period of campaigning, his aides said.
A fund-raising dinner last night at the Sheraton New York Hotel in Manhattan was attended by 1,600 supporters, and aides said they expected to take in $1.4 million before expenses.


Using Steinbeck, Hemingway and Others as Parole Officers
When Walter Grajales went to court after he was caught breaking into a car, the judge gave him an unusual choice: he could either go to jail or take a literature class.

Spell It Out to the U.N. on Somalia
America's national pride could be injured if the Clinton Administration decides to extricate U.S. troops from the gathering disaster in Somalia.
America's national interests could be injured if it does not.
The latest fiasco in Mogadishu, which left some 12 U.S. soldiers dead, 78 wounded and 1 or more hostage, provides all the evidence the Administration needs.
U.S. troops are now prime targets in a deadly Somali power struggle -- even though Washington never formally decided to take sides and no essential American interests are at stake.


Trade Pact to Give Latin America a Big Boost
To the Editor:

After a Year of Tumult, Pakistanis Will Vote
After a year of tumultuous political maneuvering, power plays and constitutional crisis -- all of which have staggered the country's fragile economy -- Pakistanis will vote on Wednesday in what are likely to be the first free and fair national elections in more than two decades.
Two former Prime Ministers, Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, have thundered across this country for weeks, rousing the passions of voters in an effort to regain the office both lost after terms marked by charges of incompetence and corruption.

A top New York City Police Department official said yesterday that he would reopen 40 cases involving allegations of corruption and misconduct against police supervisors and their relatives that were kept in a secret file and withheld from prosecutors.

Blue Jays Won't Let McDowell Off Hook

Although the White Sox have a talented pitching staff and could tie the American League Championship Series at a game apiece Wednesday, the hammering that their best pitcher endured probably left an impression on the young pitchers who will follow him.

U.S. OFFICIALS HAIL YELTSIN FOES' ROUT
American officials expressed hope today that the defeat of President Boris N. Yeltsin's opponents in Moscow had swept aside the vestiges of the old Soviet system.
But they said they remained unsure that the opening would make way for true democracy.
With their vision of a democratic Russia still embodied almost solely in Mr.
Yeltsin, the officials said they recognized that the path toward democratization remained littered with obstacles within Russian society and perhaps presented by the Russian President himself.

Car Renters Biased Against Young Drivers, Lawmaker Says
Most car rental companies still turn away some drivers under 25, despite a state law banning the practice 10 years ago, State Senator Roy M. Goodman charged yesterday.
He called for imposition of stiffer fines against the companies and giving young drivers the right to sue.
But spokesmen for the car rental companies said young drivers are less safe, and that the companies' policies are tied to another state law, one that makes them responsible for whatever damage is done by the cars they own, even if it is the renter's fault.

The Real Test: With Parliament Gone, Can Yeltsin Reform the Economy?
For 18 months, President Boris N. Yeltsin complained that the Russian Parliament was blocking his Government's efforts to move the Russian economy toward a Western-style free market.
Now that Mr.
Yeltsin has complete control, he is widely seen as having an unprecedented and probably unrepeatable chance to stabilize and reform Russia's economy.
This opportunity is especially important for the West, which has hinged more than $40 billion in aid to Russia on progress toward economic reform.


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Lendl's Falling Fast  Todd Martin outlasted three-time champion Ivan Lendl in a marathon three-set battle last night to advance to the second round of the Australian Indoor championships in Sydney.
Martin rallied to down the seventh-seeded Lendl, 4-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-4, in a first-round match that lasted 2 hours 33 minutes.
It was the ninth time this year that Lendl had lost his opening match of a tournament.
Lendl, who won the Australian Indoor in 1985, 1987 and 1989, made an increasing number of errors as Martin stepped up the pace after breaking in the fifth game of the third set.
Lendl was within 2 points of victory in the second set tie breaker.
Martin, from Lansing, Mich., clinched the victory with an ace that was hotly disputed by Lendl, who stormed angrily from the court.
The defending champion Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, seeded fourth, scored a 6-4, 6-2 first-round victory over Jason Stoltenberg of Australia.

Personal Health; Cold weather means blizzards of dandruff.
IT'S getting to be that time of year when the scalps of millions of Americans become noticeably flaky, prompting people to try a host of sometimes counterproductive measures to avoid embarrassing dandruff.
An estimated 50 million people are plagued by the problem, which not only gets worse with the passing of summer but also becomes more obvious when people don the darker colors of winter.
Although dandruff is very widespread, exactly what goes wrong is still a hotly argued subject.
Only recently have dermatologists begun to understand the likely cause or causes better and to begin to develop more effective treatments.
Mistaken Ideas
Contrary to what some people think, dandruff is not caused by poor hygiene, although infrequent shampooing may make it worse.
And except for people with extremely dry skin everywhere on their bodies, dandruff is usually not the result of dryness.
In fact, treatments intended to add oil to the scalp can make a dandruff problem much worse.


Undermanned Islanders Lose in Hextall Debut

"On the first day of school, teachers from P.S. 27 in Brooklyn (a school that had been closed because of the asbestos problem) were assembled in the auditorium of a neigboring school, P.S. 15.


Turn On the Lights in Central Park and Improve the Security; And in Brooklyn
To the Editor:
The many joggers and cyclists who use the recreational lanes of Prospect Park must now face a myriad of obstacles: missing lane markings, broken glass and other debris and overflowing blocked drains.


Bonner 'Best Available'
Physical play, added bench strength and the ability to defend quick forwards are the qualities that Anthony Bonner said he will bring to the Knicks.
"The Knicks are an up-and-coming team on the verge of winning a championship or two," said Bonner, a 6-foot-8-inch forward who signed a two-year deal with the Knicks on Monday.
Bonner, who is expected to be Coach Pat Riley's 12th man, will make $650,000 this season, with the option of becoming an unrestricted free agent after the season.
"This gives me the opportunity to play for the best coach in the N.B.A., and to play with guys who play hard and leave it all on the floor," he said.


Two Killed in Crash Of Aircraft on L.I.
A part-time flight instructor and his student were killed today when a twin-engine aircraft the student was piloting crashed and burned in a wooded area near the East Hampton town airport.
A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, Duncan B. Pardue, said the student was apparently preparing to land the six-seat aircraft when the crash occurred at about 12:45 P.M. near a road about three quarters of mile from the airfield.
He said the two victims were the only passengers aboard.


Review/Dance; Martha Graham Company Opens New Season
For Martha Graham, yesterday was always today.
Among her most quoted aphorisms was "The only constant in life is change," and there was no doubt that the Martha Graham Dance Company took its founder's principles to heart on Tuesday at the hugely successful gala opening of its two-week season at City Center.
The entire evening was rich with novelty, including one that pointed toward a radical new direction in the troupe's future.
Twyla Tharp, represented by "Demeter and Persephone," a premiere starring Christine Dakin, became the first of several choreographers outside the Graham fold to be invited to create works for the company.


Market Place; A new company's process excites investors in waste disposal.
INNOVATIVE technology combined with a careful reading of rules governing the handling and disposal of hazardous waste may turn into a winning combination for a start-up company named Molten Metal Technology Inc. of Waltham, Mass.
Early buyers of its stock have done pretty well, even though the company is not expected to earn any money for at least another calendar year.
Molten Metal made an initial public offering in February at $14 a share.
The price slipped briefly to $10 in April but has been rising, more or less steadily, since July.
The shares passed $20 in early August and have stayed over that level, closing yesterday at $23.125, down 37.5 cents in Nasdaq trading.


Bradley Asks U.S. to Confront Middle-Class Economic Fears
Hoping to prod the Clinton Administration into paying more attention to the economic anxieties of middle-class Americans, Senator Bill Bradley is arguing that the Government should guarantee all workers not just health care but also the opportunity for lifetime education and training and pension protection.
One of the most influential legislators on economic issues, Senator Bradley has been working for weeks on a speech addressing the insecurity that American workers feel in light of changing economic conditions.
This anxiety underlies the strong opposition in Congress, particularly among Democrats, to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the New Jersey Senator and the Clinton Administration strongly favor.


Parking Rules
Alternate-side parking rules will be suspended in New York City today and tomorrow for the Jewish holidays of Shemini Atzereth and Simhath Torah.
Other regulations remain in effect.


Gun in Home? Study Finds It a Deadly Mix
Instead of increasing protection, a handgun in a home almost triples the chances that someone will be killed there, a study of homicides in three metropolitan areas has found.
The conclusions of the study contradict the popular notion that keeping a gun at home increases personal safety, the researchers said today.


Yellow Van at Center of Trial's First Confrontation
It is not surprising that the first mention of a yellow van brought with it the sharpest confrontation among prosecutors, defense lawyers and a witness in the opening days of the World Trade Center bombing trial.
The van, allegedly rented at a New Jersey Ryder agency by Mohammed A. Salameh, one of the four men now on trial, is at the very heart of the case.
It was the vehicle that, government investigators say, was packed with the explosives that blew a vast crater five stories deep in the underground levels of the trade center in lower Manhattan.
A piece of the van found in the rubble left by the blast is what led the Federal Bureau of Investigation to suspect Mr.
Salameh and, through him, some of the other defendants.


Wyandanch Seeks U.S. Help in Fighting Crime
Desperate for help in waging a war they fear they are losing, civic leaders turned today to a top Federal law-enforcement official for aid in ridding this community of drug dealers and prostitutes.
Zachary Carter, the new United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, walked the streets of Wyandanch, seeking to learn more about the community and determine if Federal officials can do anything to help.
Local leaders said they could not remember a United States Attorney visiting their community before.

Jets' Offensive Line More Like a Dotted Line for Raiders
The Jets' offensive line will have a formidable task on Sunday against the Los Angeles Raiders.
The starting center and right guard will probably not play against a defense that has recorded 16 sacks this season.
"Let's go," said Coach Bruce Coslet. "Crank it up. That's why we have backups."


A Legacy as Jordan Departs: Stars Are Corporate Heroes
Magic Johnson once told of how he tried, early in his career, to persuade the sneaker company he had a contract with to market a basketball shoe in his very famous name.
He said he was told by a company official, with all due respect, that "no basketball player could ever sell a shoe."
"And then," said Johnson, "along came Michael."


New Balance of Power in East Tilts Toward the Knicks
Michael Jordan's sudden retirement has made the Knicks the preseason favorite to win the Eastern Conference, but it also enhances other teams' chances to dethrone the Chicago Bulls as conference champion.
Jordan's announcement shifts the balance of power in the East like the retirement of no other player could.
Cleveland, which has lost in the playoffs to Chicago the last two years, and Charlotte, considered perhaps the fastest-rising team in the league, could contend along with the Knicks and Chicago for the conference title.
Other teams like the Orlando Magic and New Jersey Nets could see their fortunes improve as a result of Jordan's absence.


Settlement In Lawsuit Against De Kooning
A lawsuit that raised questions about the authenticity of a group of sculptures attributed to Willem de Kooning was settled yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan when representatives of the Abstract Expressionist artist and of his late wife's estate agreed to a financial settlement with Philip Pavia, a Long Island sculptor who filed the suit three years ago.
Terms of the settlement, however, were shrouded in secrecy and ambiguity.
The size of the payment to Mr.
Pavia, who was seeking roughly $3 million to cover what he said were his time and expenses in casting sculptures for Mr. de Kooning from 1987 until 1990, was not divulged.

A Higher Alcohol Tax Should Pay for Health
To the Editor:
I agree with the recommendation of President and Mrs.
Clinton that there should be still more substantial taxes on tobacco products to pay for the health care for all Americans that they propose (front page, Sept. 23).


Health Care Spending Is Found to Vary Greatly State by State
The Federal Government issued new data today showing huge variations in health care spending from state to state.
The figures suggest that the Government would have difficulty setting local budgets for health spending, as President Clinton has proposed.
An explicit goal of Mr.
Clinton's health plan is to reduce variations in the level of medical spending and its growth.


Essay; Depart With Honor
The world's humanitarian objective in Somalia was to feed the starving and to make it possible for the population to begin to feed itself.
That objective is being met, and the saving of hundreds of thousands of lives is no small thing.
The more recent U.N. military objective has been to discover the hideout of Mohammed Farah Aidid, to capture him and disarm his hooligan forces.
That forcible pacification -- the euphemism is "peacemaking" -- would lessen the danger of warlordism choking the area again.
In that objective, the U.N. has failed.

School Board Seeking Help From Albany
The New York City Board of Education decided yesterday to ask the State Legislature to shorten the official school year, if necessary, because of the time lost for the asbestos crisis.
The board turned to Albany for help as it decided to reverse a decision made only three weeks ago and close schools on Columbus Day.
The board had previously voted to keep schools open on that holiday to meet the minimum requirements to get its full share of state education aid.


PARENT &amp; CHILD
THE 4-year-old white girl studied the photographs the researcher had given her.
Each picture showed pairs of children -- one black and one white -- in ambiguous, nonthreatening situations, like two children in a playground.
The researcher asked the girl questions about what she saw, such as: "Which child is the bad child?" or "Which child will win the game of checkers?"
"Every time there was something good, she picked the white child," said Dr.
Phyllis A. Katz, a developmental psychologist who conducted this research and who is the director of the Institute for Research on Social Problems in Boulder, Colo.
"Every time there was something bad, she picked the black child.

Dimi Mint Abba's songs are invocations, battle cries, dances and laments.

For Thatcher, Saint or Not, Barbs Are All
Some would say she is like the beast who will not die, rising up nightly out of her coffin to torment the living.
Others see her as a protective angel, hovering over the landscape to insure that her good works are being carried out.
Whatever she is, specter or saint, Margaret Thatcher just won't go away.
And she is clearly making life miserable for her successor, the amiable accident-prone John Major.


The Islanders' New Line Looks Good Amid Defeat
Sooner or later, Pierre Turgeon and Derek King will return to the Islanders and to the team's top line.
It might be Friday night in Edmonton; it might be Sunday night in Anaheim; it might be Tuesday night in Los Angeles, the end of the four-game road trip that opens the season.
Turgeon has tendinitis in his left wrist and King is in Ontario for his mother's funeral.
Certainly the Islanders missed their scoring power Tuesday night when they lost the season opener by 2-1 to the Calgary Flames at the Saddledome.
But the absence of these two top attackers allowed Coach Al Arbour and everyone else to observe a makeshift line that might endure longer than planned, even when Turgeon and King return.


Television Loses Star Of the Ratings Game
The pining has begun at NBC and TNT for the loss of Michael Jordan.
Viewers will still watch National Basketball Association games.
They will still have Charles Barkley, Larry Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal to astound them.
But NBC and TNT relied on Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to swell their ratings, scheduling as many Bulls games as their N.B.A. contracts would allow.
Both have signed new four-year television deals with the N.B.A. that will begin after this season.
Those deals require them to pay 25 percent more, partly because of the league's success during the nine-year Jordan era.
NBC will pay $750 million and TNT $350 million.


Charles Keating's Lasting Taint
Overdrafts at the House bank unseated more than a few incumbents last year.
Charles Keating is having a similar effect in the Senate, albeit on a smaller scale.
Mr.
Keating is the Arizona tycoon for whom five Senators intervened when Federal regulators cracked down on his big California savings and loan association.
Mr.
Keating is now doing time for fraud.
One of the "Keating five" Senators -- the California Democrat Alan Cranston, apparently the worst offender -- retired last year.
Two others have announced they will go when their terms end next year -- Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Donald Riegle of Michigan, both Democrats.


COURT AGAIN HEARS A CASE ON SEIZURES
The Supreme Court today picked up where it left off last term in a critical examination of the Government's authority to seize property owned by convicted drug dealers.
At the end of the last term, in June, the Court set a new constitutional limit on Government forfeitures, ruling unanimously that a seizure of property can be so disproportionate to the crime as to amount to cruel and unusual punishment.
The question before the Justices in a spirited argument today was whether the Constitution entitles convicted drug dealers to advance notice and a hearing before the Government can seize their homes.


Mere meets more on the runways of Milan


Broderbund Software Inc. reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 31


Review/Fashion; Real Clothes Look Radical
Members of the fashion press and retailers at the Milan ready-to-wear shows are having a problem with much of what they're seeing on the runway: there's just not much for working women to wear.
It's even difficult to imagine the models strolling the street in the states of undress that some in Milan have proposed this season.
Ines Capelli, owner of Serenella, a designer boutique in Boston, for instance, was well blanketed in a navy cashmere jacket and trousers while buying.
"I really feel for the woman who hasn't got the body and confidence to wear these sheer clothes," she said.


About Those Cookies
To the Editor:
"The Annals of Dessert" (Topics of The Times, Sept. 29) notes that Consumer Reports had top-rated chocolate-chip cookies prepared from Hillary Rodham Clinton's recipe.
Then you state Consumer Reports indicated that "Mrs. Clinton's recipe was preferred to Barbara Bush's by 55 percent to 45 percent," adding, somewhat churlishly, "It's so hard to get a straight cookie report these days without consumer writers trying to sneak in their political views."

RABIN AND ARAFAT HOLD FIRST TALKS
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, met here today to coordinate the transition to Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho, on the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
After the meeting, they said talks on administrative details would begin Oct. 13 in Cairo and in Taba, an Egyptian resort.
"We are committed to whatever we signed, but it is not enough to sign," said Mr.
Rabin, alluding to the pact the two men signed Sept. 13 in Washington.
"You have to translate through negotiations into reality."


Family's Grief in a Daughter's Words
Following is an excerpt from the statement yesterday by Claire Schroeder, the daughter of a Boston police officer killed in a 1970 bank robbery, at the sentencing of Katherine Ann Power:
When Katherine Power and her friends robbed the State Street Bank in Brighton with semiautomatic weapons, my father responded to the call.
One of her friends shot my father in the back and left him to die in a pool of his own blood.
Katherine Power was waiting in the getaway car, and she drove the trigger man and her other friends away to safety.


Nothing Left to Prove
His retirement was shocking. His career was spectacular. And his legacy is secure.
Michael Jordan played the game at such a high level, he ran out of mountains to climb.
His team won three championships.
He won seven scoring titles.
He won three most valuable player awards.
And he won defensive player of the year honors.


Meaning of Clumsiness
To The Home Section:  The Parent &amp; Child column on Sept. 16, describing the problems of the clumsy child in school, was a useful warning to parents and educators to seek intervention as early as possible when such problems are observed.
An important source of this intervention was overlooked, however.


A Victim's Mantle for Mr. Giuliani
The sudden ferocity of the New York City mayoral campaign arises, at least in part, from this fact: To the surprise of people on both sides, the re-election campaign of Mayor David Dinkins is not dead yet.
It will be very hard for the Mayor to hold the narrow lead over his Republican challenger, Rudolph Giuliani, that he has in some polls.
But the tightness of the contest has produced some transparently ugly politics.
Dinkins surrogates have used bigoted statements to rally the black vote; the Rev.
William Jones's comment about "fascist" elements in the Giuliani campaign is an example.
The Mayor's tepid disavowals opened him to the accusation that these statements were coordinated with his campaign.
It is not enough for the Mayor to say mildly that "I do not agree with every statement made by every supporter." As Mayor and candidate, he has been too given to tardiness and half-measures.
What was needed was prompt, outright repudiations of remarks like that of Eric Adams, the black policeman who condemned Herman Badillo, the candidate for Comptroller on Mr.
Giuliani's ticket, for marrying a woman who was not Puerto Rican.


From a Drawing to a T-Shirt
OTHER children may like it and buy it, but Melanie Springhetti-Teppich hardly ever wears the T-shirt she designed.
"I'm embarrassed to," said Melanie, a 7-year-old from lower Manhattan.
"My name is on it. Once I wore it to second grade and everybody said, 'You made that T-shirt?' and I didn't like the attention. Nobody else in second grade makes T-shirts."
How did her shirt come to be?
"I was sitting in my bedroom kind of bored and looked out the window," she said.
"I didn't see waterfalls, but I wanted to draw them."


Whitman Plan to Cut Taxes: Experts Taking It Seriously
By most accounts, Christine Todd Whitman committed a colossal political blunder when she proposed a $1.2 billion cut in income and business taxes for the financially strapped state of New Jersey.
The states' editorial pages have heaped scorn on her plan and, according to polls, 70 percent of the state's citizens -- including a majority of her fellow Republicans -- simply do not believe that she can deliver on her promise to cut taxes.
But there is more to Mrs.
Whitman's plan than an outlandish notion -- even though her Democratic opponent, Gov.
Jim Florio, promptly labeled it a "voodoo re-do," a reference to Ronald Reagan and supply-side economics.
Mrs.
Whitman is not promising something for nothing.

New Ford Chief Hasn't Bought One, Lately
The next chairman, president and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, a man with the ultimate responsibility for making and selling more than three million vehicles a year, does not own a car.
Alexander J. Trotman, who will assume his new responsibilities next month, cannot remember the last time he bought a car, Ford or otherwise.
While he has bought cars overseas, he has never had the experience of buying from an American dealer, haggling over price and trade-ins, or fussing with matters like auto insurance or registration.


Library at Time Cut by a Third
Time Inc. informed its library staff yesterday that 43 jobs, about one-third of the library workers, would be eliminated in six months.
The move was described as part of a transition to greater reliance on electronic research.
The corporate library, one of the largest in the world, serves all Time Inc. magazines.

Ex-Radical Gets 8 to 12 Years In 1970 Killing, and a Rebuke
Imposing a negotiated sentence that he said was not adequate to the crime, a state judge sentenced Katherine Ann Power today to 8 to 12 years in a Massachusetts prison for her role in a 1970 bank robbery that resulted in the murder of a Boston police officer.
The judge, Robert Banks of Suffolk County Superior Court, rejected any suggestion that the political views or psychiatric problems of Ms.
Power, a onetime antiwar radical, called for leniency.
And he was openly sympathetic to the police officer's eldest daughter, Clare Schroeder, who captivated the courtroom as she spoke about the suffering of a widow and her nine children left without the man they adored.


And Now, Whoppers vs. Waffles
On the eve of their first face-to-face debate, Gov.

Teachers' Fund Gets a Taste of Its Own Medicine
The Teachers Insurance Annuity Association and College Retirement Equities Fund, which disclosed guidelines yesterday for evaluating how company executives pay themselves and manage their businesses, is being forced by one of its members to consider whether its own executive pay arrangements should be changed.
In a case of what is good for the goose being good for the gander, Werner Cohn, a retired sociology professor, has won a battle to force the teachers' pension fund to include his criticism of TIAA/CREF's own executive pay in its proxy statements.
They will be mailed to participants in the pension fund before the fund's annual meeting next month.


The records may continue to fall for Michael Jordan's career as a marketing All-Star.
JUST as death turned out to be a career move for Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Elvis Presley, so, too, could Michael Jordan's spectacular career as a celebrity endorser continue with his sudden end of his spectacular career as a basketball player.
By the book, the annual endorsement income of Jordan, which at an estimated $32 million dwarfs that of all other American athletes, should shrivel as his playing days abruptly conclude.
"I just feel I don't have anything else to prove," he said yesterday in explaining his unexpected retirement from the Chicago Bulls.


Briton Insists He'll Push for Democracy in Hong Kong
The Governor of Hong Kong said today that his yearlong effort had failed to win approval from China for his plan to expand democractic rule before Britain withdraws from the colony in 1997, and that he would proceed with the plan despite Chinese threats.
The Governor, Christopher Patten, said he was weeks away from acting on his own to put the democracy proposals before the 60-member Legislative Council that will rule the colony after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty.


Lemaire-Type Defense Gives Devils a Victory
On the day in June he was hired as the coach of the Devils, Jacques Lemaire made it clear that defense would be his top priority.
In their opening game of the season tonight, the Devils made it clear their coach knew what he was talking about.
With an emphasis on defense offsetting their meager offense, the Devils barely squeezed out a 2-1 triumph over Tampa Bay before a crowd of 12,946 at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.

Down 2, White Sox Must Battle Jays and History
Jerry Reinsdorf, the man who runs the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Bulls, sent an apology of sorts to his White Sox players today for any infringement that the Bulls' blockbuster personnel development might have made on the White Sox's time in the spotlight.
The Toronto Blue Jays, on the other hand, expressed no regrets.


Democracy Beckons Boris Yeltsin
The world's hopes for Russia at this fragile moment in history lie with Boris Yeltsin.
That explains the joy in Western capitals when Mr.
Yeltsin shattered the latest effort by parliamentary reactionaries to bring him down.
It also explains the equally palpable dismay when he followed his triumph with a series of decrees designed to suppress any possible opposition.
Those who have invested their hopes and are prepared to invest their money in Mr.
Yeltsin know that he cannot move Russia forward by replacing one autocracy with another.
Hence Washington's relief when he assured President Clinton that he would stick to his pledge to hold parliamentary elections Dec. 12.
Hence too the relief when Mr.
Yeltsin rescinded the press censorship imposed two days ago under the state of emergency.


Allies of Salinas Accused of Muzzling Critics
As President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has moved to raise workers' wages and help poor farmers before crucial elections next year, his aides and supporters are being accused of trying to silence critics of the Government and humiliate its most powerful opponent.

Crack Is Found Near Core of a Nuclear Plant
A steel cylinder that directs cooling water to the nuclear core of a North Carolina power plant has developed a crack around its 14-foot circumference, raising the possibility that it could break during an earthquake or other disaster and jam the mechanism that shuts the reactor, Federal officials say.
There are more than 30 reactors of similar design around the country, and the officials, at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said last week that they had warned these plants of the problem.
It is the first time such a crack has been discovered in this kind of reactor, the officials said.


Poverty and Callousness in America
The Census Bureau released some ugly data this week: The number of poor Americans rose last year and is now higher than at any time since the 1960's.
Some observers dismiss the new data, saying the increase wasn't large and that year-to-year changes aren't important.
The small increase wouldn't be very important -- except for the fact that last year's experience is part of a disturbing story that's been unfolding for a decade or more.
The proportion of Americans living in poverty -- for a family of four, that means living on less than $14,335 in 1992 -- is now 14.5 percent, which is only slightly lower than it was in the 1960's.
Poverty is not decreasing -- despite Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, despite the economic boom of the 60's and despite the longest peacetime recovery ever during the 1980's.
That's no statistical fluke.

Not So Fast on Somalia
The horror of American bodies being dragged through the streets of Somalia and the shock of Army Rangers being ambushed have left Americans furious and numb.The disaster has brought an understandable instant response: get our troops out now.
However, as President Clinton said yesterday, before a hurried pullout, we must think hard about the meaning of what we're doing in Somalia.
Nobody argues we should stay in Somalia any longer than minimally necessary.
But the way we leave is crucial.


For St. Petersburg, It's All Just Politics
The city known in Soviet times as "the Cradle of the Revolution" sat this one out, and there was none of the massed public support for President Boris N. Yeltsin that did much to discourage the coup leaders of August 1991.
While Mr.
Yeltsin disbanded the Parliament in Moscow and finally shelled it, the only demonstrations here were pro-Parliament and pro-Communist, and they were small.

New Jersey Teen-Ager Convicted of Ritual Slaying
After seven hours of deliberations, a jury today found James P. Wanger guilty of murder and 10 other charges against him in the bizarre ritual slaying of a teen-age friend.
All along, the defense had insisted that Mr.
Wanger was a scapegoat, framed by three other youths who later pleaded guilty to their roles in the slaying of Robert A. Solimine Jr.
There was no forensic evidence linking Mr.
Wanger to the crime, which took place when both he and the victim were 17.


Sports of The Times; The Jordans Talked More Than Hoops
THE press had it backward, Michael Jordan said more than once.
He was not retiring from basketball because his father had died.
He was retiring from basketball because his father had lived.
The father was considerably shorter, and just as bald, and he always fell short of being a caricature of a stage parent.
Just when you thought James Jordan might be hanging around a bit too much, you realized he wasn't waiting in the corridors because he liked it -- although he surely did.
He was also there because his son wanted him to be there.
He was his son's best friend.


Batiste Wobbles Then Shines
The respects were paid with an obligatory politeness in the dugout.
Kim Batiste accepted the sentiments, heard the encouragement, acknowledged it was best to forget the error that had cost his club a 3-2 ninth-inning lead in the most important game this collection of Phillies had played in their lives.
All the voices couldn't drown the screaming he still heard in his mind, the internal dialogue that wouldn't forgive, that kept asking, kept inquiring, kept punishing.


Consumer Group Says New York City Is Failing Its Recycling Goal
A consumer advocacy group said yesterday that recycling by the New York City Department of Sanitation was running far behind the goal promised last year when the city sought state approval for construction of incinerators.
But the City Sanitation Commissioner said that recycling was on target, although she conceded that some of the information-gathering procedures to prove her case did not yet exist.
The New York Public Interest Research Group said yesterday that in 1993 the city would recycle only 53.8 percent of the waste collected by city trucks that it was supposed to, and that overall, only about 5 percent of waste was being recycled.
The city's goal for the end of the decade is 25 percent.


Two Candidates Present Two New Yorks
In the New York City of Rudolph W. Giuliani's television ads, people live in fear.
They worry about drug dealers, high taxes and bad schools.
They are scrappy and strident, and their voice has a timbre that is straight out of Brooklyn.
They resent the implication that a vote for Mr. Giuliani has anything to do with race.
In the New York of David N. Dinkins's ads, people live in harmony.
They favor conciliation and healing, and in times of trouble, they walk the streets together.
They are optimistic and hopeful, yet, paradoxically, they see racial unrest as an ever-present possibility.


Yeltsin Cancels Guards at Lenin's Tomb
At 4 P.M., the usual clutch of onlookers gathered for one of Moscow's most venerable rituals, the changing of the guard at Lenin's Mausoleum on Red Square.
But instead of smartly goose-stepping off to the Spassky Gates as guards had done for 69 years, the two guards there today quietly walked into the mausoleum -- and into history.


Republican Asks Inquiry Into Possible Voter Registration Fraud
The Republican chairman of the New York State Senate Elections Committee called yesterday for a criminal investigation of the Manhattan Borough Board of Elections for possible election fraud, including the validation of thousands of unsigned or duplicate registration cards.
The appeal by Senator Michael F. Nozzolio of Seneca Falls echoed longstanding complaints by aides to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, that duplicate registrations could hurt their campaign to unseat Mayor David N. Dinkins.

Schintzius and Coleman Are Focal Points of Nets
On the eve of the opening of training camp, the New Jersey Nets matched the Milwaukee offer sheet for 7-foot-2-inch reserve center Dwayne Schintzius, and kept the lines of communication open on the contract extension for Derrick Coleman, their 6-10 starting power forward.
Coleman, who Tuesday turned down the Nets' latest offer of $33.5 million for five years, has told his agent, Harold MacDonald, that he doesn't want to be involved in any talks after Friday, the first official day of workouts at camp.

Trash Giant Makes Plans To Expand In New York
The nation's second-largest hauler of solid waste served notice yesterday that it intends to expand greatly in the New York City market, a move that could shake up an industry that Federal prosecutors have long said is dominated by organized crime.
The company, Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. of Houston, chose an unusual medium to convey its message.
At a news conference with Mayor David N. Dinkins, Browning-Ferris announced that it had become a major sponsor of the New York Marathon.
It plans to recycle many of the 1.6 million paper cups and 150,000 plastic water bottles left by the 25,000 runners in the Nov. 14 event.

Review/Film; Sound (and Reality) Check For an Underground Band
Even by the forgiving standards that rock critics tend to apply to dedicated underground bands with little commercial potential, the music of Half Japanese, a group from Uniontown, Md., is difficult to admire.
Formed in 1975 by the brothers Jad and David Fair, the band has always prided itself on not being able to play its instruments.
And Jad Fair, its indomitably cheery lead singer and chief songwriter, has a voice that comes about as close as rock singing can to sounding like chalk on a blackboard.
Physically and vocally, Mr.
Fair is the caricature of a nerd.
Wiry, graceless and wearing a tense little smile, he declaims his lyrics in a shrill, neighing monotone that is oblivious to pitch.
His ineptitude seems almost calculated when he interprets blues songs in jerky mechanical phrases that make every beat feel laboriously counted out.

Settlement Over Artwork By an Ex-Slave

Traylor, Charles Shannon actually contributed greatly to his support and his later recognition.

Guiliani on Race
ON THE SCREEN: Donna Hanover Giuliani, wife of Rudolph W. Giuliani, dressed in red plaid jacket and discreet gold earrings, facing camera in office setting with warm wood-toned television cabinet in background.
At one point, footage is interspersed of Mr.
Giuliani in a hard hat and plaid workshirt, talking first with a white construction worker and then a black one at a building site.
As she says her final lines, Ms.
Giuliani first nods, then shakes her head just a bit.
PRODUCER: The Garth Group of New York THE SCRIPT: As a journalist, I thought I'd seen everything.
I was wrong.
I'm Donna, Rudy Giuliani's wife.
My husband was called a fascist by a group of ministers endorsing David Dinkins.
And while people who support the Mayor are called proud, people who support my husband are called racist.
This election shouldn't be about race, it should be about competence.
Of course I want people to vote for Rudy Giuliani.
But I want them to vote for Rudy because he's the best man for the job, not for any other reason.
ACCURACY: In endorsing the Mayor last week, the Rev.
William H. Jones, the head of a black Baptist ministers group, said Mr.
Dinkins had been unfairly branded a murderer in the death of a Hasidic scholar in Crown Heights and that people who made such charges included fascist "elements" that has grown around Mr.
Giuliani.
But he did not call Mr.
Giuliani a fascist.
While some Dinkins supporters have said that some white Democrats are backing Mr.
Giuliani largely because of his race, Mr.
Dinkins has never explicitly ascribed racial motives to them.
The Mayor often says that for blacks to vote for a black or Italians to vote for an Italian is an expression of pride, while voting against someone because of his origin constitutes racism.
SCORECARD: Mr.
Giuliani often contends that Mr.
Dinkins is too willing to paint himself as a victim of racial animosities, and this commercial, and a similar one by Mr.
Giuliani's running mate for Comptroller, Herman Badillo, argues that Mr.
Giuliani is the true victim -- of guilty liberal voters reluctant to oppose a black candidate.
Without saying so, it objects that few politicians or pundits find it troubling that more than 90 percent of black voters back Mr.
Dinkins, while often bemoaning the fact that barely one quarter of whites support the Mayor.
That amounts to a call to arms to Mr.
Giuliani's strongest white ethnic backers to support him with pride, and to white liberals to be offended by appeals to guilt and focus on competence instead.
It trades on Ms.
Giuliani's reputation as a former news anchorwoman for WPIX-TV to make its case in a Checkers meets Diane Sawyer vein, and sorrowful tone as she stands by her man puts a soft edge on a tough message.
But the ad also risks seeming disengenuous: While ostensibly saying that race should not be an issue, it actually goes to great lengths to highlight and trade on racially inflammatory remarks.

An Elusive Clan Father Is Peacekeepers' Nemesis

It is an admonition that United Nations troops have recognized at their cost.


SPRINT VENTURE TO OFFER COMPUTER TELEPHONE SERVICE
The Sprint Corporation, the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier, will team up with Minnesota Supercomputer Center Inc. to market high-performance computer services over its long-distance fiber optic network.
As envisioned, an oil exploration company, for example, could transmit billions of bits of seismic data to a supercomputer, which could then compile it into vivid images of underground geological formations.
Using a technology called Asynchronous Transfer Mode, Sprint will be able to transmit the equivalent of four full-length books a second.
Minnesota Supercomputer, an 11-year-old company with $25 million in sales, operates five supercomputers.


Clinton Sending More Troops to Somalia

By setting a specific withdrawal date, Mr.
Clinton hoped to ease Congressional pressure to end the Somalia operation immediately.
The President also planned to spell out more clearly the precise goals he is setting for the American troops, who have been in Somalia for nine months on a mission that has already been extended and redefined.

WHERE TO FIND IT
NO one really knows who gets credit for devising the hooked rug.
Some view the rugs, made from fabric strips pulled through a woven base with a wood-handled crochet hook, as true, born-in-America folk art.
Others, notably W. W. Kent in his 1930 book "The Hooked Rug," trace the craft's origins to the sixth-century Copts or Bronze Age Vikings.
Whatever.
During the last decade or so, hooked rugs, once relegated to the attic, have become popular, in part because decorators have featured them prominently in country-style interiors.
"A lot of young collectors who couldn't afford Orientals also started buying hooked rugs," said Jessie Turbayne, author of "Hooked Rugs, History and the Continuing Tradition" (Schiffer Publishing, $39.95).

Ise Journal; Sun Goddess's Sojourn (Will Shinto's Star Rise?)
Long before Japan's business and political leaders and its leading Shinto priests arrived in the ancient forests surrounding the Ise shrine here to witness the nation's rarest religious ritual, Kenichi Yano was struggling to answer a 1,300-year-old question.
Why, every 20 years, does Japan rebuild its most sacred shrine, uprooting the sun goddess Amaterasu from her old sanctum and resettling her in a new one?


Now, the Little Prince Can Come to Supper
"THE LITTLE PRINCE" has endured for 50 years.
No one knows if the plates, cup and porringer inspired by the beloved book will last that long, but they are sunny to look at and are sweet without being cloying.
The faience dishes, made by the Gien company in France, are being sold in connection with a show of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's original manuscript and illustrations, at the Pierpont Morgan Library until Jan. 2, 1994.
Saint-Exupery may not have foreseen dishes made from his drawings, but what better way for the lonely Prince to make friends?


Review/Theater; 'Family Secrets': Catskills to California
As a lively but decrepit Jewish grandmother named Rose, one of five fully fleshed characterizations in the one-woman show "Family Secrets," Sherry Glaser tells the story of the octogenarian's botched suicide attempt, which involved a gas range and half a bottle of aspirin.
Her son, Rose recalls, wondered why she didn't just jump out the window, since she lived on the 33d floor.
Rose's complacent answer: it was cold outside.
Now in itself, the story may have the weary resonance of something that has made many rounds on the borscht circuit.
But Ms.
Glaser doesn't play it as an isolated joke.
She charges the anecdote with an energetic empathy that brings into focus both the old woman's truly felt despair and the sharp-edged, absurdist logic that is her best defense.


Credit Clinton in Gay Rights Struggle
To the Editor:
"Nunn 2, Clinton 0" (Op-Ed, Sept. 20), Tom Stoddard's analysis of the fight to lift the ban on gays in the military, is inappropriately harsh to the President and Representative Barney Frank.
It shows a misunderstanding that pervaded his leadership of the Campaign for Military Service.
The contending parties were the President facing the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Senator Sam Nunn.
Compromise was inevitable.
Instead of working to shape that compromise, Mr.
Stoddard's forces reacted harshly to any talk of it by Mr.
Clinton and blasted Mr.
Frank when he expressed alarm at their futile approach.
They denounced the President and the July directive without analyzing its strengths and weaknesses.
Only now, amid further denunciation, do they recognize it had some merit.


Garden Q.&amp;A.
Bark for Canoes
Q.
If it's harmful to strip bark from trees, how did American Indians make their canoes? -- Jeremy Fischer, Manchester, Vt.
A.
A handsome new book, "Bark," by Ghillean T. and Anne E. Prance (Timber Press, $49.95), offers answers.
It notes that many peoples used bark for watercraft, but that none surpassed the skill of American Indians.
And while spruce, elm, hickory and Southern beech were useful for canoe shells, no tree compared with the paper or white birch (Betula papyrifera).


Review/Television; The Effect of Images on Governmental Policy
So now we must add to the nightmarish images of our century the corpse of an American soldier being dragged through dusty streets by an exulting band.
The picture would be painful under any circumstances, but there is a twist of the knife: the young man was in Somalia as part of an effort to feed people.
In reflections written after the Marine landing in December and published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times last Thursday, George F. Kennan blamed television for the surge of support for what was insistently described at the time as a humanitarian mission.
"The reaction was an emotional one," he wrote, "occasioned by the sight of the suffering of the starving people in question." Now the emotions aroused by a new picture and the deaths it represents are putting pressure on the Administration to end the mission that began with such acclaim less than a year ago.

The authorities have charged four boys -- a 13-year-old, a 14-year-old and two 16-year-olds -- with first-degree murder in the killing of a British tourist last month.
They were also charged with first-degree attempted murder and automobile theft.

The series of attacks has attracted international attention and threatened Florida's $31 billion tourism industry.

As a result of losing Smirnoff, McCann resigned its three other Heublein brands, though it will retain the media portion of the account.

Germany and other signers of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, signed in Paris at the end of 1990, rejected the Russian request at a meeting in Vienna last month, saying that any change that would require a renegotiation of the treaty was unacceptable, according to the diplomats.

Once Again, Children Prove That Some Like It Yucky
A NEW toy and book are not so much beautiful but beastly, which seems to be the trend in children's products.
Adults just don't get its wacky look, but children 4 and up are grabbing doll's called Roomies (above), whose Velcro-backed features -- including train-track mouth and pyramid eyes -- can be endlessly rearranged.
Or exchanged for Lolita lips and bloodshot bug eyes.
Roomies were created by Shelly Meridith, a New Yorker and former product designer for the Walt Disney Company.
"I went to a Picasso-sketchbooks exhibition and was inspired by how he tried to arrange the eyes, nose and mouth in a drawing of a woman," Ms.
Meridith said.

In "Hoochie Koochie Man," a song associated with his longtime employer Muddy Waters, he sang as if he took the song's occult powers for granted.

Suddenly, Michael Doesn't Play Here Anymore
Like Alexander the Great, Michael Jordan said he had no more worlds to conquer.
And so, at age 30, the man generally considered the world's greatest basketball player announced today that he was retiring from the game and from the spotlight that had become so uncomfortable for him.
"I have nothing more to prove in basketball," he said, "I have no more challenges that I felt I could get motivated for. It doesn't have anything to do with my father's passing, or media pressure, or anything other than that I had achieved everything in basketball I could. And when that happened, I felt it was time to call it a career."


The Gehry House: A Brash Landmark Grows Up
FRANK GEHRY has remodeled his house, and some people are miserable about it.
Young architects in Los Angeles, including several whose careers Mr.
Gehry has helped to nurture, are having a hard time adjusting to the change.
They grumble, mostly among themselves, that Mr.
Gehry has smoothed away the rough edges that gave the house its character.
To hear them talk, you might think that the house belonged to them.
And it does.
It belongs to everyone who believes that architecture is an art of living.
The house, in Santa Monica, just west of Los Angeles, has been a landmark for 15 years.
The architectural vocabulary it introduced in 1978 -- a precise balance of fragment and whole, raw and refined, new and old -- has inspired a generation of designers.
It helped to establish Los Angeles as America's most vibrant city for architectural innovation.
And it widened the scope of Mr.
Gehry's own practice from a regional to a global sphere.


Cutbacks at Spoleto U.S.A.
The Spoleto U.S.A.
Festival in Charleston, S.C., will cut back on its presentations for the 1994 season because of financial constraints, a spokesman said yesterday.
The festival will run 12 days, from May 25 to June 5, instead of the 17 originally announced, and will present some 90 performances, down from 118 in 1993.
With an accumulated deficit of about $1 million, the festival has reduced its budget from $4.5 million this year to an estimated $3.8 million for 1994.
Among the major productions to be presented is Puccini's "Trittico," in a staging by the festival's artistic director, Gian Carlo Menotti, beginning on May 27.


Braves' Pitchers Aren't Ready to Surrender
During the season, Greg McMichael, the Braves' 26-year-old rookie relief pitcher, preserved 19 of 21 save opportunities and had a 2-3 record with a 2.06 earned run average.
Over his previous 55 1/3 innings in those final weeks of the pennant race he had allowed only 8 earned runs for a 1.30 e.r.a.
But in the 10th inning of tonight's National League Championship Series opener, the Braves lost, 4-3, when McMichael's changeup was smashed for a double by John Kruk and a single down the left-field line by Kim Batiste.


At Visa, New Quest for U.S. Growth
When Carl F. Pascarella abruptly replaced H. Robert Heller as president of Visa U.S.A. in late August, he became the third person to hold that job in less than four years.
Some of the turnover may stem from the difficulties of 63-year-old Charles T. Russell, the president of Visa International, the parent organization, to settle on a successor.
But this latest change clearly stems, too, from the growing pressures on Visa.

Review/Dance; Translating Lofty Goals Into Steps
Coyote Dancers, a new group directed by Maher Benham, gave a polished performance on Sunday afternoon at the Marymount Manhattan Theater.
Two guest artists, Maxine Sherman and Steve Rooks, both former members of the Martha Graham Dance Company, enhanced the occasion.
Yet the matinee was disconcerting because Ms.
Benham's choreography seldom matched the loftiness of her stated intentions.
A press release said "Emanating the Essence," to recorded music of Brahms, had been inspired by the rapport between Graham and the dance photographer Barbara Morgan.
The choreography for Karen Kopf and Ms.
Sherman was in no way specifically biographical.
Rather, using strong, bold movements, Ms.
Benham showed two people totally attuned to each other.
The dance was coherent on its own terms.

Pasqua: From First To Last
All Dan Pasqua wanted to do was fit in.
That is all any reserve who is thrust into the spotlight really wants to do.
Maybe Pasqua thought about smacking a few hits, but he primarily wanted to make the plays at first base and remain anonymous afield as a defensive replacement for Frank Thomas, the ailing White Sox slugger.
But on a day in Chicago when discussion of Michael Jordan's retirement inevitably brought gloom, any mention of Pasqua probably brought frowns.
The White Sox substitute first baseman not only made an error, but he was also guilty of another defensive misplay.
And he stranded five runners while going hitless in three times at bat while drawing abuse from the fans.
He might be anxious to return to a backup role.

Head of New York Police Offers Compromise on Outside Monitor
Saying he had been "revolted" by the testimony of corrupt police officers, New York City's highest police official told a mayoral commission yesterday that the public had a right to expect better and that he would not oppose an outside monitor of the Police Department's anti-corruption efforts, as long as he retained the power to investigate and punish wrongdoers.
Speaking before the Mollen Commission, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly laid out for the first time the conditions under which he would support an independent authority to monitor his 30,000-member department, which has been portrayed over the last 10 days as unable to rein in rogue officers.
Mr.
Kelly's testimony could signal a compromise between the commission, which has urged such a review body, and the Police Commissioner, who until recently has argued that the police should police themselves.


Redskins' Quarterback? It's a Multiple-Choice Test
When the Redskins play the Giants Sunday in Washington, their starting quarterback will probably be Mark Rypien.
Or maybe Rich Gannon.
Or possibly Cary Conklin.
Even Richie Petitbon, the Redskins' coach, isn't sure.
He wants it to be Rypien because he is the best of the three.
In the second week of the season, when Rypien sprained his right knee against the Phoenix Cardinals, the Redskins lost.
They have lost the two games since -- to the Philadelphia Eagles and the Miami Dolphins -- so they will take a three-game losing streak and a 1-3 record in against the 3-1 Giants.


A Limited Showdown Over Cable
Cable television subscribers in several cities woke up yesterday to find their favorite ABC, CBS or NBC programs vanished, casualties of a long-running dispute over whether broadcast stations should be compensated by cable systems that carry them.
Under Federal law, the deadline to resolve that question was yesterday, and in the few cities where agreements could not be reached, viewers paid the price.
In Corpus Christi, Tex., for example, tens of thousands of viewers suddenly found an explanation from their cable operator where programs from ABC, NBC and CBS used to be.
In Portland, Me., cable viewers no longer got programs from NBC or CBS.
And in Grand Rapids, Mich., cable subscribers lost the CBS affiliate.
Scattered Effects
In the New York area, only a few small cable systems did not reach agreements with broadcast stations.
WNBC said it had withdrawn its signal from United Video, which has a few thousand cable subscribers in northern Westchester County.


Overseas Gains Spur U.S. Stock Market
Spurred by major gains in European and Asian markets, the American stock market was mostly higher yesterday in active trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 11.73 points, to 3,598.99, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.50 points, to 764.77.
However, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 0.46 point, to 460.74.


The Rush Is On, as Florida State Seeks a Championship
The bitter disappointment of unsuccessful last-second field-goal attempts against the University of Miami is only one basic reality that the Florida State Seminoles must confront this week.
For the Seminoles to extend their perfect season and reverse the frustration of seven losses to Miami in the last eight games, including several that have deprived Florida State of a chance at the school's first national football championship, they will have to find a way to limit Miami's rushing game.


Tele-Communications Seen In Buyout of Liberty Media
At a time when the television industry is growing increasingly wary of the power of John C. Malone, Mr.
Malone, head of the nation's largest cable company, is considering a $3.3 billion stock deal to regain full control of a programming arm he spun off two years ago to please regulators.
According to an executive familiar with the proposed transaction, Tele-Communications Inc., which Mr.
Malone controls, would buy back the roughly 95 percent stake it does not own in the Liberty Media Corporation, a supplier of cable television programming, and reintegrate the two companies.


In the City of Change, Is 'Las Vegas Landmark' an Oxymoron?
OCTOBER is going to be a banner month for demolitions in Las Vegas.
On Oct. 27, the Dunes Hotel and its legendary 18-story sign are scheduled to become a neon-lighted memory in the American psyche.
The demolition, perhaps the most lavishly choreographed architectural blowup in United States history, is being designed to do for demolition what the Folies-Bergere did for legs.
The hotel and its minaret-topped sign will be felled by phony cannon fire from an ersatz British frigate.
The extravaganza is the latest spectacle from Stephen A. Wynn, the casino king who is chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., which bought the Dunes earlier this year and plans to build another new resort there.

Review/Music; 4 Siblings Committed Both to Play And Teach
The Ying Quartet is one of many talented young quartets currently stirring interest in the chamber music world.
What sets these four siblings apart is an exceptional commitment to musical education.
They are quartet in residence in the small town of Jesup, Iowa, where they have aroused enthusiasm for chamber music among young listeners.
The Yings -- Timothy and Janet (violinists), Phillip (violist) and David (cellist) -- also deserve attention for purely musical reasons, as they showed in a recital on Friday night at Weill Recital Hall.
Their sound is integrated and sure-footed, a picture of expressive unanimity.
The highlight of Friday's program was the Brahms Quintet in F minor, with Wu Han at the piano.
Ensemble between strings and piano was tentative at first, but climactic passages of the third and fourth movements barreled along with symphonic force.
It suddenly struck this listener how much the stretto of the last movement influenced the "Rondo Burlesque" of Mahler's Ninth Symphony.

Across the Globe, Expressions of Regret and Gratitude
From the "Say It Ain't So, Mike," headline in The Chicago Sun-Times to the special news report on Romanian television, Michael Jordan's abrupt retirement sent shock waves around the globe yesterday.
And in a world where basketball has become a rare unifying force, the world reacted as one, with surprise, admiration, understanding and dismay.
The dismay may have been more pronounced in Chicago, where children cried and grown-ups groped for words, but Jordan's retirement was major news in virtually every international capital, confirming that Jordan is the world's most famous and admired athlete.


New Pact for Rice
JERRY RICE signed a three-year contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers yesterday, solidifying his status as the National Football League's highest-paid wide receiver.
Rice, a ninth-year pro who already has become the league's career leader in touchdown receptions with 106, will get at least $8.425 million and possibly as much as $9.625 million during the extension, which begins in 1995.

Review/Music; American Song as an Art Form
For exactly 20 years, William Bolcom and Joan Morris have been stealthily erasing the line that separates art song from popular song.
Max Morath, sometimes as a singer but more prominently as ragtime pianist, has been similarly subversive at the keyboard.
The three came together on Sunday afternoon in the Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College.
Benefiting was the Institute for Studies in American Music at Brooklyn College.
Cited was H. Wiley Hitchcock, its founding director, who is retiring.
And noted, too, was the Bolcom and Morris anniversary: The team's first concert, in 1973, was under the auspices of the institute.
Musical values have been so influenced by ideas and progress -- in other words, by the politics of style -- that the American popular song is by and large the recipient of affectionate pats and subsequent dismissal from serious scrutiny.
Its harmonic language has not kept pace with the Schoenbergs of 20th-century music and, at its most sophisticated, goes very little past turn-of-the-century Ravel.
The June-moon-croon school of lyrics sounds somehow more legitimate in Schumann's German than in 1920's Americanese.


COMPANY NEWS: The New Technologies; Americans See Future and Say, 'So What?'
The companies seeking fortunes in whiz-bang high-tech goodies we are constantly told are just over the horizon have their work cut out for them, according to a public opinion poll commissioned by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
The new technologies -- the data superhighway, interactive television, video-on-demand, virtual reality -- promise a revolution in personal communications and entertainment, but only a small percentage of Americans think advanced electronics and computer developments will have a big impact on their lives during the next 10 years.


Economic Scene; The wisdom of managing trade is coming under scrutiny.
WHEN it comes to trade, everybody knows that the Japanese are different, and that the only way to make economic peace with them is to dispense with the vague promises and insist on specific trade results.
Well not quite everybody.
Last week an elite, mostly American group of economists (including four Nobel Prize winners) wrote to President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in preface to the Japanese leader's official visit, deploring America's drift toward a "results oriented" trade policy and pleading for a return to what might be called internationalism by the rules.


Royal Encounters, on the Stage and in Real Life
Nicholas Hytner has a cache of stories about his encounters with the royal family at the Royal National Theater in London.
He tells them at gatherings and in private, with great glee, in nasal-voiced, Monty Python-esque parodic style.
There's one about the Prince of Wales, for instance, who went to the National last year to see Alan Bennett's play "The Madness of King George III" and discussed it with Mr.
Hytner, the director, afterward.


With Polls Tight, Giuliani Pounds Pavement and Mingles
Rudolph W. Giuliani moved his campaign to the shoe-leather stage yesterday, hawking his hopes on the streets of Manhattan as Mayor David N. Dinkins countered with a string of stinging attacks.
While Mr.
Giuliani mixed with commuters on the Upper East Side and the lunch crowd in Bryant Park, the Mayor condemned him for refusing to participate in debates that include the conservative candidate, George Marlin.
Mr.
Dinkins said the Republican-Liberal candidate would destroy a program intended to help women and members of minorities win city contracts.
He said Mr.
Giuliani offered New Yorkers government "by decree" and "a tense, terse style."


Surgery for Webber
CHRIS WEBBER, the former Michigan star, underwent a routine appendectomy yesterday afternoon after undergoing tests for stomach pain, a hospital spokeswoman said.
Webber, due in California tomorrow for the opening of the Golden State Warriors' training camp, was taken from his Detroit home to Henry Ford Hospital about 7 P.M.
Tuesday.


AT HOME WITH: Niki de Saint Phalle; An Artist, Her Monsters, Her Two Worlds
LUNCH is about to be served at the country home of Niki de Saint Phalle, and there is a worm on her chair.
"Yeuuch," the French-American artist says, recoiling in horror.
"Do you think you could remove that?"
It is a modest worm, quite still in the summer sun.
When one remembers that this is an artist who created a sensation in the early 1960's by firing a gun at her canvases in performances (sometimes joined by Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns) and who has since sculptured myriad serpents and many-headed monsters, the creature appears risibly innocuous.
But there is genuine alarm in Ms.
Saint Phalle's cavernous blue eyes.
"I tend to paint things I am terrified of," she says.
"Worms, snakes, spiders, that kind of thing."

A Major Record Album: Only a Phone Call Away
The making of Frank Sinatra's new album with 13 other big-name artists, including Barbra Streisand, Carly Simon and Bono, was no "We Are the World" type of celebrity jam session.
Thanks to the latest in fiber optic technology, recording it was more like "We Are All Over the World."
For the album of duets, Mr.
Sinatra remained in Los Angeles as most of his partners literally phoned in their performances: Aretha Franklin from Detroit, Tony Bennett from New York, Charles Aznavour from London and Liza Minelli from Brazil.

The couple were divorced in 1945.


YELTSIN, IN SPEECH, APPEALS FOR CALM AFTER 'NIGHTMARE'
In his first address to the nation since army tanks crushed an uprising against him, President Boris N. Yeltsin called on Russians today to put the "nightmare of these black days" behind them, and affirmed that elections to a new Parliament will be held Dec. 12.
Mr.
Yeltsin also called for a purge of Russia's regional councils, many of which had sided with the Parliament's defiant leaders during the political crisis that led up to this week's violence.
He said the local councils, or soviets, should peacefully dissolve themselves, and also prepare for new local elections, possibly in December.

Another Vote
While the Mayoral race captures the attention of most of New York City, another campaign is taking place this week.
For the first time in the history of their migration to the continental United States, mainland residents of Puerto Rican ancestry will have a chance to voice their preference on the island's future -- whether it should remain a commonwealth, form an independent nation or become the 51st state.
The vote will begin today in polling places in schools, community centers and storefronts in New York, with other cities to follow over the next few weeks.
It was organized by a group of mainland Puerto Rican politicians and advocacy groups who were angered by their exclusion from the island's Nov. 14 nonbinding plebiscite on Puerto Rico's political status.


Executive Leaves Y. &amp; R. for Ammirati
Helayne Spivak, the high-profile creative executive, said yesterday that, as expected, she would leave Young &amp; Rubicam New York to rejoin Ammirati &amp; Puris in New York, effective Nov. 8.
For the last three years, Ms.
Spivak, who is 41, has been executive vice president and executive creative director at Y. &amp; R. New York, overseeing creative work on accounts like Dr Pepper, KFC and Xerox with estimated billings of $1.3 billion.
Her return to Ammirati is seen as a graceful exit from her many problems at Y. &amp; R., which included frequent turnover in the creative ranks, several large account losses and clashes with the agency's sedate corporate culture.
And in June, Ted Bell, a top creative executive at Leo Burnett, was named to a higher creative post than hers, as vice chairman and worldwide creative director at Y. &amp; R. Advertising.


Treasury Bonds Trade in Tight Range
The bond market was on hold again yesterday, with prices and yields bouncing around in a narrow range.
But the hold may be lifted tomorrow, when the Labor Department releases its September employment report.
That data may give traders and investors an indication of whether interest rates should remain in their current trading range or break out in one direction or another.


Bee Schenken Is Dead; Bridge Champion, 77
Bee Schenken, a leading contract bridge player who won seven national titles, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan.

Excerpts From Testimony By the Police Commissioner
Following are excerpts from the testimony yesterday of the New York City Police Commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, before the panel investigating police corruption.
The people of New York City must know they can count on the members of their Police Department to be as honest as they are brave and able.
They must know they can count on the Police Department to track down and drive from our ranks those who violate their oath and break the law.


Tests Added for Women in Health Plan
Responding to complaints from women's advocates, the Clinton Administration announced today that its health plan would pay for more frequent mammograms than it had originally recommended.
Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, told the Senate Labor Committee that in addition to free mammograms every two years for women over the age of 50, the Administration had decided it wanted additional breast X-rays for women in high-risk categories, like those with a family history of breast cancer, to be fully paid by the program.
Worried About Bureaucracy
When it gets the Administration's final proposal, Congress is expected to alter many details, and more liberal benefits for women's health concerns are politically inviting to many lawmakers.
Last week, 36 women in the House urged Hillary Rodham Clinton to see that more generous standards were adopted.

Ex-Leaders Await Pakistan Vote Tally
Two former Prime Ministers battled to regain power today, but no clear leader emerged as paper ballots were counted from Wednesday's elections, Pakistan's third national vote in five years.
The vote pitted Benazir Bhutto against Nawaz Sharif, her successor, in an election in which less than 40 percent of the voters cast ballots, an indication of the depth of cynicism over the country's political process and its politicians.


Safety Concerns Limit the Ability Of Reporters to Work in Somalia
Delays and confusion over information on the major battle between United Nations forces and Somali militiamen over the weekend has underscored the difficulties for journalists operating in Mogadishu.
Most major news organizations have withdrawn from the Somali capital for safety reasons in the last month and only a handful of reporters are left in the capital.
United States news organizations, including The New York Times, have withdrawn American citizens from the city.
In recent weeks there have been increasing threats by supporters of Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid to take American citizens hostage.

On Both Sides: Disarray and Indecision
In the night before the final and fateful assault on the Parliament center, both the White House and the Kremlin, the headquarters of competing claims to Russia's power a scant three miles apart, seemed caught in illusion and indecision.
In the Kremlin, a sparse weekend staff seemed to be caught entirely off guard by the eruption of an armed insurgency on Sunday led by extremists.
President Boris N. Yeltsin flew in by helicopter only shortly before 7 P.M., when the cordon around the White House, as the Parliament building is known, was already breached and gunmen were setting off to attack the headquarters of the state television.


Phillies Take Series Lead By Winning In the 10th
The Philadelphia Phillies, a team that is used to living on the edge, especially with Mitch (the Wild Thing) Williams around, almost fell off the precipice tonight.
Too much wildness from the reliever, as well as too much wildness from the defense, nearly doomed the Phillies in the first game of the National League Championship Series against Atlanta.
But the Phillies perservered over the Braves, who won more games than any other team in the major leagues, because on this night redemption incongruously walked hand-in-hand with many a Phillie on the high-wire act.


Ear to the Universe Is Plugged by Budget Cutters
An ambitious program to monitor the heavens for possible radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, begun with much fanfare last year on Columbus Day, has been canceled by Congressional budget cutters, and astronomers are looking for private financing to continue their cosmic eavesdropping.
The $12 million needed to keep the program alive for the next year was eliminated from the NASA budget last Friday by a House-Senate conference committee.
The action was spurred on by Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, who derided the program as a "great Martian chase" and a waste of taxpayer dollars.


Giants' Moore Is Back, But His Future Is Murky
The nameplate over Eric Moore's locker was blank, but Moore was there, sitting, talking extensively about his four-game suspension from the National Football League for violating its substance-abuse policy.
Moore looked relieved to be back with the Giants.
How long he'll be back is unclear, but for now he has been given a second chance.
Many professional athletes are given second chances, and third, and fourth.
What matters is what they do with those chances.
Moore, on top of the world after he was picked in the first round of the draft in 1988, must now wade through one of the lowest points of his life.

Former State Senator Admits Illegal Use of Money
A former state senator admitted today that she had illegally used money from her employer, Rockland County's only gas and electric company, to gain political advantage for the utility, to suppress negative coverage of it in a local newspaper and to pay some of her personal expenses.
The admissions by the former senator, Linda Winikow, came as part of a plea agreement and represented the first conviction in an embezzlement scheme that has left residents angrily wondering how the utility has been spending their money.
Prosecutors have charged that the scheme, engineered by Mrs.
Winikow and two other former employees of Orange and Rockland Utilities, involved in excess of $250,000 paid by consumers.


U.N. Fails to Stem Muslim Rebellion in Bosnia
United Nations-sponsored efforts to bring peace to the northwestern corner of Bosnia appeared to falter today, 10 days after the region's leader, a Muslim businessman, proclaimed autonomy from the Muslim-led Government in Sarajevo and set off what has become a war within a war.
The rebellion by Fikret Abdic, a longtime rival of Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, has raised fears that Bosnia could fragment further in the absence of a peace accord to end the 18-month-old war.
Mr.
Abdic has said he favors an international peace plan that Mr.
Izetbegovic's Government has rejected.


Cruise Line Will Cut a Disney Link
Premier Cruise Lines, the longtime official cruise line of Walt Disney World, announced yesterday that it had a new agreement with Warner Brothers Consumer Products.
As a result, its fleet will soon put to sea with a new cast of characters -- namely, that wascally wabbit Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes menagerie, including Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and the Tasmanian Devil.
While Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and other Disney characters will not be made to walk the plank, they will not be appearing on the Premier line after next March.
Their long-term seafaring fate apparently depends on whether Disney comes to terms with either Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. or Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., both of which have acknowledged holding discussions with Disney.

If you were among those glad-handing, big-talking well-wishers who couldn't promise enough to James (Buddy) McGirt when he was preparing to fight Pernell Whitaker last March, and then deserted him after he lost the welterweight bout and underwent shoulder surgery, McGirt had a few words for you yesterday.

Starbucks to Taste New York, at Last
The Starbucks Corporation, the nation's largest retailer of specialty coffee, is expected to announce on Thursday that it is moving farther from its base here into several new Eastern markets -- including New York City and Boston.
The company, which has aggressively expanded, now has 253 stores in the United States.
It features Italian-style coffee bars selling fresh-roasted beans, pots to brew them in, and drinks like latte (pronounced LAH-tay), a shot of espresso topped with hot milk but less foamy than cappuccino.

Fifty years ago, the Swiss composer and saxophonist Daniel Schnyder could have had a flourishing career writing film scores for Hollywood.
Mr.
Schnyder, performed with a septet on Sept. 29, writes music that incorporates the bleakness of modernist classical music with elements of jazz to create moody, dissonant pieces, darkened by shadows, that would have been perfect for film noir.


Panel Passes Council Plan For Building On Shoreline
Far-reaching new waterfront zoning rules, which would require the developers of large private projects in New York City to build public space along the shoreline, were approved yesterday by the City Council's Land Use Committee.
Vital to passage were several compromises sought by the real-estate industry and agreed to at the 11th hour by city planners.
These would reduce or eliminate legal liability and maintenance obligations for the builders of public spaces.

Review/Dance; Folklore Right in Step With the Abstract
Aman World Music and Dance opened an engagement at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night with a program that featured venerable folk dances as well as the world premiere of Laura Dean's "Light," an up-to-the-minute piece that nonetheless has roots in the past.
It may at first seem odd that this Los Angeles-based troupe of dancers, singers and musicians turned to Ms.
Dean.
Aman, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary, specializes in folk dances from around the world performed in traditional costumes and accompanied by traditional instruments.
Ms.
Dean is a rigorous abstractionist who has worked with both ballet and modern-dance companies.
Her love of patterning has led some theatergoers to call her a minimalist, although that designation in no way does justice to the intricacy and beauty of her choreography.


Keenan Is on the Defensive
Mike Keenan came to the Rangers' practice facility at Rye Playland in Rye, N.Y., yesterday morning convinced that a few of his original starting six defensemen would be on the bench tonight when New York is host to the Tampa Bay Lightning at Madison Square Garden and a few of his rookies would get a chance to play.
Five hours later, he wasn't so sure.

Clue and $1 Million Reward In Case of the Serial Bomber
Unable to track down a serial bomber who has terrorized executives and college campuses for 15 years, Federal investigators today reached out to the public for help, disclosing a tantalizing clue and offering a $1 million reward.
The bomber last struck in June after a six-year hiatus.
He sent two innocent-looking parcels from Sacramento, Calif.
When opened, they maimed a genetics scholar at the University of California at San Francisco and, two days later, a prominent computer science professor at Yale University in New Haven.

First Foreign Troops Arrive Under Peace Plan for Haiti
Twenty-six American and five Canadians troops arrived here today in a climate of widespread violence to help begin the final push to carry out a United Nations accord calling for the return of the exiled President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The 31 soldiers, wearing the blue berets and arm patches of the United Nations, are the first of about 1,300 military and police personnel who are to be deployed here before Father Aristide's scheduled arrival on Oct. 30.
About 50 Canadian Mounties are expected on Thursday, and 250 more American soldiers by next week.

N.H.L.
Panthers Tie in Opener  Chicago's Chris Chelios scored two power-play goals and assisted on two by Jeremy Roenick to rally the Blackhawks to a 4-4 tie at Chicago Stadium with Florida in the Panthers' National Hockey League debut last night.
Brian Skrudland had given the Panthers a 4-3 lead by beating Ed Belfour from point-blank range at 13 minutes 40 seconds of the third period. (AP) Jets 6, Capitals 4: Teemu Selanne, who had 76 goals and was the N.H.L. rookie of the year last season, scored three goals to rally Winnipeg over Washington.
The Jets, playing before a season-opening record crowd of 15,363 at the Winnipeg Arena, led 3-0, but fell behind, 4-3, a little more than three minutes into the final period on Dimitri Khristich's second goal of the game. (AP)


A Safety System, and Inexplicable Failure
The crash of two subway trains in Brooklyn yesterday should have been prevented by a safety system that is intended to stop a train from ever running into the back of another train, transit officials said last night.
It was not immediately clear what went wrong.
But the officials acknowledged that the system is not foolproof.


2 Restaurant Chains Name New Agencies
Two restaurant chains changed their agencies yesterday.
White Castle System Inc., the fast-food chain in Columbus, Ohio, selected J. Walter Thompson Detroit to handle its account, which had been at Gunder &amp; Associates in Dublin, Ohio, for the last four years.
Billings were estimated at $10 million to $15 million.


Review/Fashion; Armani Brilliance, Soft and Flowing
Without question, Giorgio Armani is the jewel in the crown of the Italian fashion industry.
The collection he introduced Wednesday evening, as the spring and summer fashion shows here approached the end, glowed with special splendor.
Retailers came to praise, not only for the esthetics but also because Armani clothes are actually selling to customers.
He is a hot name, but most did not expect the brilliance they saw on the runway.


Top Drug Lord Aide Is Slain in Colombia In a Police Shootout
The man considered the ranking lieutenant of the fugitive cocaine trafficker Pablo Escobar was gunned down on Wednesday night in a shootout with the police, officials said.

Escobar's personal security, died in a shootout with police in Medellin, Colombia's second city.
Also killed was Mr.
Puerta's brother, Jaime.


Musician Union Ratifies Pact With Producers

Vince Coleman, the Mets' outfielder who faces a felony charge stemming from a firecracker incident outside Dodger Stadium last July, is expected to appear in Superior Court on Friday morning and request a delay in his arraignment proceedings.
"Vince is on his way here tonight," Coleman's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, said today.
"I don't anticipate anything happening in court, though. We may just set the matter for a prelim for some date in the future and continue exploring our options."


New York Poll Sees Grim View Of Life in City
A majority of New Yorkers say the quality of life in the city has declined over the last four years, and they generally have a bleak view of the state of the local economy, race relations, crime and the public schools, according to the latest New York Times/ WCBS-TV News Poll.
But in the midst of an election campaign in which Rudolph W. Giuliani has made the quality of life a major issue, the poll also found that most New Yorkers do not think either he or Mayor David N. Dinkins is likely to change things significantly.


Agnes de Mille, 88, Dance Visionary, Is Dead
Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment.
She was 88.
The cause was a stroke, said Dr.
Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.

A highly fortified air base deep in the Upper Huallaga Valley that serves as the center for United States counter-narcotics operations here has become obsolete and should be abandoned, American narcotics experts say.
The base, which is known as Santa Lucia, has cost American taxpayers more than $100 million over the last six years.
From its inception in late 1987, it has represented the forefront -- however ineffective -- of the United States effort to stop the cultivation in Peru of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.


Review/Film Festival; Action, History, Politics And Love Above All
Chen Kaige's "Farewell My Concubine," the Chinese epic that has proved so troublesome to the Communist authorities at home, is one of those very rare film spectacles that deliver just about everything the ads are likely to promise: action, history, exotic color, multitudes in confrontation, broad overviews of social and political landscapes, all intimately rooted in a love story of vicious intensity, the kind that plays best when it goes badly, which is most of the time.
"Farewell My Concubine," which shared the top prize at this year's Cannes International Film Festival with "The Piano," by Jane Campion, is a vastly entertaining movie.
It's also one of such recognizably serious concerns that you can sink into it with pleasure and count it a cultural achievement.


Excerpts From the Debates of the 2 New Jersey Gubernatorial Candidates
Following are excerpts from a gubernatorial candidates' debate last night in Trenton between Gov.
Jim Florio and Christine Todd Whitman, as recorded by The New York Times.
The Economy
Q.
Mrs.
Whitman, your economic plan calls for a 30 percent income tax cut over three years.
Will the cuts be in human services, welfare?
Will money for state colleges be on the block?
Please tell us specifically what you plan to cut.

Albert Smith Bigelow, 87, Pacifist Who Tried to Halt Nuclear Tests
Albert Smith Bigelow, a pacifist who tried several times to sail into a nuclear testing area near the Marshall Islands in 1958 in a protest against nuclear weapons, died on Wednesday at a retirement home in Walpole, Mass.
He was 87.
His family said he had had a long illness.


L.I. Officials Urging Olympus to Stay
They are rolling out red carpets from county offices and town halls across Long Island for the Olympus Corporation, the Japanese camera and medical-equipment maker spurned in its efforts to build a new American headquarters on state land here.
Since the collapse of a deal brokered by the State Urban Development Corporation to bring Olympus to 53.7 acres of the Long Island Developmental Center, a former center for the retarded, government officials and business leaders have been in a frenzy to find another site for the company.


Critic's Notebook; The Crossroads Of Film and Art
FOR most people, a video is something to rent if you missed the movie at a theater.
Video means MTV, and a camcorder to preserve the family birthday parties.
But the ease and relative cheapness of video has also made it a favored technique of avant-garde artists, hopeful amateur film makers, and nonprofessionals who now create their own versions of history (personal and political) as routinely as authors once kept written diaries.
One way to catch up with these ever-expanding possiblities is offered by "Video Visions," a program of international work presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center.
The series, which begins today at the Walter Reade Theater, is the second annual video festival presented as part of the New York Film Festival.
Like last year's program, this one is determined not to be mainstream.
You won't find the increasingly common path from music-video director to Hollywood feature-film maker here.
But then you can discover tomorrow's Hughes brothers, who used rap videos as their training ground for "Menace II Society, on television.


U.S. Lawyer Died as Hero For Russians
Among those who died Sunday in the firefight at the Russian radio and television station was an American lawyer who spent his last hour trying to save others.
Witnesses said Terry Michael Duncan, 26 years old, repeatedly went to the front of the building that was under assault, pulling as many people as he could to safety.


For Black Caucus, Farrakhan Embrace Marked Independence; Fingers on a Hand
To the Editor:
Re "The Black Caucus Gets Mugged" (editorial, Sept. 25): I am a black Republican and you did not speak for me or thousands of my black brothers or sisters.
I am not a fan of Louis Farrakhan, but he does represent a large percentage of blacks in America, and we do not intend to ignore them now or in future for you or anyone else.


Review/Film Festival; Pregnant, Unmarried And Smiling
With "The Snapper," a small, joyful lark of a film, Stephen Frears rediscovers the essence of the comedy of mundane situation, a perfectly respectable genre before television took it over and turned it into the mass-produced, wafer-thin, low-calorie entertainment called the sitcom.
As demonstrated by Mr.
Frears and Roddy Doyle, who adapted his own novel for the screen, there are still wonderful comedies to be made when care is taken and attention is paid.
The situation in "The Snapper" is this: Sharon Curley (Tina Kellegher), a supermarket checkout clerk in Barrytown, a north Dublin working-class suburb, becomes pregnant.
Or, as it's put more colloquially throughout the film, "Sharon Curley's up the pole." The trouble is that the unmarried Sharon refuses to identify the father.


HELMS FILIBUSTERS AGAINST A NOMINEE
Taking aim at a longtime opponent, Senator Jesse Helms today tried to block the nomination of Walter E. Dellinger 3d to a senior Justice Department position.
Mr.
Helms tied up the Senate for much of the day in a filibuster that he began Wednesday evening over the nomination of Mr.
Dellinger to become Assistant Attorney General for the office of legal counsel.
A vote to break the filibuster narrowly failed, and Senate Democrats said they would try again next week for a final vote.


Blissful Ignorance in Detroit
Neither the next chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Alexander J. Trotman, nor the man he is to replace, Harold A. Poling, owns an automobile.
They drive company cars.
This revelation does not explain Detroit's slump in the 1970's, nor its buoyant comeback in the 1990's.
But it bespeaks an alarming indifference to one of the basics of consumer research -- namely, to know something about consumers, it helps to be one.
For those unfortunates who don't have a company car, here's how it works.
You get a new one every year.
If it goes on the fritz, another one magically appears.
You never have to visit a showroom, haggle with a dealer or face the awful truth that what you thought would be a simple tune-up is, in fact, a $500 transmission job.


For Children
Columbus Day Events
South Street Seaport
Pier 16, at 19 Fulton Street  Lower Manhattan  (212) 732-7678  Recommended for all ages  Sunday
So what if Christopher Columbus didn't actually land in what is now the United States, and no one's arguing about whether he was greeted with fireworks.
In the year 1993, at least, his 1492 arrival in the New World will be celebrated with a 19-minute, 11-second display of Grucci fireworks at the South Street Seaport at 8 P.M. on Sunday (two days before the actual holiday on Tuesday).


The Essence of Toni Morrison
In citing Toni Morrison for its Prize in Literature, the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy said she "gives life to an essential aspect of American reality" in novels "characterized by visionary force and poetic import."
Toni Morrison is quintessentially an African-American female writer.
But she has always insisted that those characteristics have been liberating, not confining.


Woman's Death by Arson Leaves Neighbors in Shock
She was a lovely old woman, the devastated relatives and neighbors said after the terrible fire yesterday, a tiny widowed grandmother who had once been a nurse and lived alone in simple dignity on the edge of the volcanic city, tending her dog and her flower beds and her memories in the autumn of life.
Her name was Regina Shehee and she had lived for many of her 83 years in the cheery, two-story yellow-and-white frame home at 110-49 167th Street in St.
Albans, Queens, on a block of good friends and caring neighbors who dropped in regularly.
A resolute and kindly woman, she rarely needed help.


Somalia: Time to Get Out
American casualties in Somalia have been steadily rising, political support at home has evaporated and an emotionally wrenching hostage crisis has begun.
The mismatch between modest American means and ambitious political goals was painfully clear.
President Clinton had to do something.
And he did.
But rather than make a decision either to cut American losses and withdraw now -- the preferable course of action -- or tough it out until those goals are achieved, the President succumbed to the tempting illusion that he could manage a little of both.
Mr.
Clinton announced a six-month target date for complete American withdrawal but ordered the number of U.S. troops more than doubled, to 10,000.


Pension Group Lists 50 Companies as Financial Laggards
The Council of Institutional Investors, a group that represents government and union pension funds, yesterday released a list of 50 large companies it found to be laggards in financial performance.
But the council stopped short of saying that those companies should be the targets of shareholder pressure to do a better job for their shareholders.
"The list was intended as a way to help smaller funds identify companies who are not performing well," said Carol O'Cleireacain, New York City's budget director and chairwoman of the council's executive committee.


Teddy Ballgame Tube?
TED WILLIAMS, now 75, has long been immortalized in the city where he hit .406, compiled a .344 lifetime batting average, won two Triple Crowns and hit the last of his 521 home runs in his final at-bat in Fenway Park.


Art in Review
'Carl Andre' 'Words, 1960-1980'  Paula Cooper Gallery  149 and 155 Wooster Street (at Houston Street)  SoHo  Through tomorrow
This exhibition is a major undertaking, if not always a satisfying one.
Painstakingly and somewhat relentlessly, and using handsome vitrines, the show presents the major portion of the poetry of the Minimalist sculptor Carl Andre, an artist better known for arranging squares of copper and aluminum or common bricks into low-lying lines, squares and rectangles.


Phone Order Is Rescinded
Because of allegations of improprieties against Pacific Bell employees, California's Public Utilities Commission has rescinded a decision that would permit competition for local phone service in the state.
In taking the highly unusual step, the P.U.C. reopened the decision for further comment until Oct. 26.
At the least, the action delays the ruling's effective date, which had been Jan. 1, and temporarily halts the expected entrance of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the MCI Communications Corporation into the local toll call market.


NBC Goes Bonkers Over Jordan
When perspective was required on Michael Jordan Wednesday morning, NBC lit the tilt light.
Its Jordan retirement scoop Tuesday night on "Dateline NBC" must have emboldened its news hounds to launch into overkill on the story.
Although I love "The Jerry Springer Show," I can accept NBC truncating it to air the first 30 minutes of Jordan's news conference.
NBC is the home of the National Basketball Association and Jordan has brought ratings and money to NBC by dint of his very existence.


Now Hear This: It's Peete
RODNEY PEETE's reign is back on again.
Determined not to be swallowed up in a developing quarterback crisis, Detroit Lions Coach WAYNE FONTES yesterday named Peete as the starter for the remainder of the season.
"Rodney Peete is the guy," Fontes said.
"We're going to put a saddle on him and ride him for the rest of the season."


Inside Art
Another Round of Golf
Even nonprofit galleries have to figure out ways to make money.
In the summer of 1992, Artists Space, a nonprofit gallery in TriBeCa, mounted "Putt-Modernism," an installation of 18 playable holes of miniature golf created by prominent contemporary artists and architects, and the show was a wild success.
The gallery earned $85,000 in two months by charging a $5 putting fee.
The golf course attracted visitors from 12 states, Europe, Australia and Asia, as well as a broad cross section of New Yorkers who would otherwise not have been found hanging around an art gallery, much less an alternative space.


Art in Review
'Peter Saul'  'New Paintings . . . and Old'  Frumkin/Adams Gallery  50 West 57th Street  Manhattan  Through Oct. 16
Peter Saul's acerbic paintings have never been for the faint of eye, and his latest efforts are no exception.
The two best, composed in the artist's contorted, cartoon-inspired style, trespass into areas where few will want to follow.
They present horrific fantasies: one concerning the execution of the convicted murderer John Wayne Gacy (who continues his life of crime from the electric chair); the other, the eating habits of Jeffrey Dahmer, another convicted murderer.
Rather than being sympathetic or unsympathetic to their subjects, these scenes depict a grim world in which there are only villains of one degree or another.


Never Mind Health Insurance, How About Some Car Insurance?


Review/Music; New Milieu for Monroe: City Opera's 'Marilyn'
Before the opera "Marilyn" received its world premiere on Wednesday night by the New York City Opera, it seemed headed for a renown only slightly less grand than its movie-star subject's.
With music by Ezra Laderman and a libretto by the poet and playwright Norman Rosten, this portrait of Marilyn Monroe's final months has been one of the most publicized new operas in years.
All three performances (the others are tomorrow and Tuesday) were sold out in advance.
The work, a City Opera commission, opened a world-premiere festival in honor of the company's 50th anniversary, in which three new works are being presented on consecutive evenings.
But unless one comes to "Marilyn" already obsessed by Monroe's mixture of come-hither glances and childlike behavior; unless one finds her death tragic rather than merely sad, there will be very little in this opera to justify three hours of dutiful attention.
This is primarily an opera for the already converted.
And even then, I wonder.

THE SOMALIA MISSION: Prisoners; U.N., Urged by U.S., Refuses to Exchange Somalis
At the urging of Washington, the United Nations is refusing to exchange any of the 32 Somalis it is holding in Mogadishu for the two soldiers, one American and one Nigerian, whom Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid's forces captured last weekend, United States officials said today.
They said that neither the United States nor the United Nations wanted to start swapping prisoners because to do so would only encourage General Aidid's followers to take more hostages.


A. Philip Nelan, 87, Monk Who Headed Manhattan College
Brother Augustine Philip Nelan, who was the 15th president of Manhattan College from 1953 to 1962, died on Tuesday at St.
Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers.
He was 87 and lived at the Christian Brothers Center in Riverdale.
The cause was complications from heart surgery, the college said.


THE SOMALIA MISSION: Diplomacy; U.S. Envoy to Somalia Is Known for Frank Style
Robert B. Oakley, selected today as President Clinton's special envoy to Somalia, is a blunt-speaking diplomat whose style and views have often irritated United Nations officials.
Mr.
Oakley, 62, who served as President Bush's envoy to Somalia from December to March, has made no secret that he disagrees with the policy pushed by the United Nations of seeking to capture Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, the Somali leader.
The Security Council voted to target General Aidid after his forces killed 24 Pakistani peacekeeping soldiers in June and raids aimed at catching Mr.
Aidid or his aides have produced most of the American casualties since then.


Review/Film; When War Was All Glory and Bands and Death
Ronald F. Maxwell's four-hour cinematic re-creation of the battle that was the turning point of the Civil War has a stately tone and meticulous attention to historical detail that make it feel more like an epic documentary than a dramatic film.
"Gettysburg," adapted by Mr.
Maxwell from Michael Shaara's novel "The Killer Angels," limits itself to the first three days of July 1863, when 150,000 soldiers threw themselves into a battle in which more than a quarter of them became casualties.
Probably no American movie has devoted more time to discussions of battlefield strategy than "Gettysburg," which is a film to warm the cockles of a military tactician's heart.
Its battle scenes, which used more than 5,000 Civil War re-enactors surging over the actual site of the original conflict, are impressively choreographed.
In their sweep and grandeur, these scenes convey a strong visceral sense of what fighting a war used to be like.
With the pageantry of marching bands and flag-waving, entwined with powerfully held notions of honor and glory, a battle resembled a lethal football game in which the stadium was emptied onto the playing field and the fans organized and handed rifles and bayonets.


Seminole With a Surprisingly Flat Foot
The problem with having experience is that it comes with a past.
At Florida State University, that can be a problem when the football opponent is the University of Miami, the stakes include the preservation of a perfect season and the immediate world remembers Seminole heartbreaks when footballs were kicked wide of the right upright in the last two seasons.
Which is where the strength of Scott Bentley comes in.
He arrived here two months ago, a freshman with a right leg powerful enough to kick field goals from record-setting distances and a mind-set bold enough to accept the challenge of becoming the final piece in a championship puzzle.


Suffolk Debate Ploy: Threat of Prosecution
The race for Suffolk County district attorney took a bizarre turn today when the incumbent, James M. Catterson Jr., announced that he had discovered a new potential subject for prosecution -- his opponent.
During a debate in a cable television studio here, Mr.
Catterson, a Republican, accused his Democratic opponent, Kevin P. Brosnahan Jr., a Babylon lawyer, of taking a $10,000 contribution from a Long Island company.
Under state election law, he said, corporations are prohibited from contributing more than $5,000 to any political campaign in a given year.


Stocks Are Mostly Lower; Employment Data Awaited
Stocks were mostly lower yesterday as investors remained cautious ahead of today's unemployment data for September.
There was also uneasiness about third-quarter corporate earnings and pre-earnings announcements, which was heightened when Corning Inc. warned that third-quarter profits were falling short of expectations and that it would take a restructuring charge to cover cost-cutting.


Corpus Christi Journal; Viewers Held Hostage in TV Dispute
A dispute between a cable company and the three network affiliates has caused about 50,000 homes to lose programming on ABC, CBS and NBC, leaving this South Texas city in an angry uproar over the prospect of life without Dallas Cowboys football, David Letterman or "60 Minutes."
"I would compare this to having your home hit by a hurricane," said Priscilla Berlanga, who trooped out with her roommate Joann Lerma on Wednesday night to EJ's Sports Bar in search of familiar television fare after their apartment lost network programming.
"This is like a big wind blowing all of our TV shows off the air."


Review/Photography; The French Character, Picture Perfect
With their wry and knowing humor, Robert Doisneau's photographs seem the very essence of Frenchness.
Mr.
Doisneau's subtle but distinctive brand of whimsy is everywhere to be seen at the Witkin Gallery, in a retrospective of work from the last 50 years that is almost as much of a treat as a trip to Paris.
Many of Mr.
Doisneau's best-known images are here, including the picture of the proper matron who covers her mouth in shock as she confronts a painting of a nude in a shop window.
Elsewhere is a scene on a Paris bridge, where a man at an easel paints a model lounging on a bench; in the painting, the woman is nude, but in reality both she and the man are bundled in heavy winter coats.


CHRONICLE
Kennedy-wedding watchers who are tired of waiting for John F. Kennedy Jr. and Darryl Hannah to tie the knot may be assuaged by this bit of news: EDWARD M. KENNEDY JR., a son of the Senator, and Dr.
KATHERINE ANNE GERSHAM will marry on Sunday on Block Island, R.I.
The ceremony at Saint Andrew's Catholic Church is to be followed by a reception at the Spring House Hotel after a round of weekend celebrations including a square dance and a fireworks display.
Some 300 people, including the Senator, his former wife, Joan Bennett Kennedy, and his current wife, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, and other Kennedy relatives are expected.


Do Something to Fix Our Wasteful Jury System; Peremptory Challenges
To the Editor:
As a judge presiding over criminal jury trials in Manhattan, I appreciate your Sept. 26 front-page article deploring the shortage of trial jurors in Manhattan and elsewhere.
In setting forth the reasons for this shortage, you make passing reference to the possibility of reducing the number of peremptory challenges, those for which no reason need be given.
That point deserves amplification.


Capri Journal; On the Isle of Big Spenders, It's Lonesome Now
Surrounded by her jeweler's wares -- diamonds and gold and baubles beyond the paycheck -- Margherita Russo has a pretty good idea of what Italy's troubled times have meant for those on this luxurious isle like her, whose living depends on the transfer of wealth from the very wealthy to those who would like to be very wealthy too.
Patiently -- and in the absence of customers consuming her time by crowding her up-market store -- she explained to a reporter that "we had these political problems in Italy" and so "the jet-set Italians don't come so much any more."


Education of a Writer
To the Editor:
"Puritans in High-Top Sneakers" (Op-Ed, Sept. 27), Richard A. Shweder's essay on openmindedness, refers to Kurt Vonnegut's education at the University of Chicago, as described in "Slaughterhouse-Five." Mr.
Vonnegut was taught that it isn't humans, but rather their society that is "ridiculous or bad or disgusting."


Gingrich Stakes Claim to House Minority Leadership
Accompanied by more than 60 Republican lawmakers, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia said today that he had more than enough votes pledged to insure his election as House Republican leader in the next Congress -- assuming he and most of his supporters win re-election next year.
Mr.
Gingrich, who as the Republican whip holds the No. 2 position in the House, would replace Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, whose style has been more accommodating to Democratic Congressional leaders.
Mr.
Michel announced earlier in the week that he would not seek re-election.


Gonzalez Intensifies Battle With Fed
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, began a push today to change the Federal Reserve System so that the President would be given more power to appoint the central bank's officials.
Mr.
Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, focused in particular on the presidents of the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks, who are now chosen by boards dominated by local bankers and business executives.
Calling the practice undemocratic, Mr.
Gonzalez said these officials, who help shape the nation's monetary policy, should be named by the President.


Home Video
You may not have spotted one yet, but this week the first 3DO Interactive Multiplayers reached some electronics outlets around the country.
The seven-pound, $699 device, made by Panasonic, plays video compact disks on television, and together the player and disks make up a long-anticipated new home video system put together by the 3DO Company of San Mateo, Calif.
The concept is the brainchild of Trip Hawkins, 3DO's president.
In a recent interview, Mr.
Hawkins said that to support the idea that 3DO represented a technology and not just a single product, the company planned to link hardware from several manufacturers (Panasonic, Sanyo and A.T. &amp;T.) with a range of interactive software from games to movies created and sold independently by many companies licensed by 3DO.


Breeders' Cup Countdown Begins
Belmont Park started its countdown to the Breeders' Cup yesterday when a dozen of the leading contenders for 1993 championships were entered in this weekend's major stakes here, one month before they gather again with all of the horse clans for the main event.
Two Grade One stakes will be run tomorrow at Belmont, the $200,000 Vosburgh for sprinters and the $500,000 Turf Classic, followed on Sunday by the $200,000 Rare Perfume for 3-year-old fillies.
All three races will serve as dress rehearsals for the Breeders' Cup.
They will also lead to Belmont's second super Saturday of the autumn season next weekend, when the $850,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup leads a program of six stakes.


House and Senate Agree to Raise Fees for Grazing on Federal Land
Breaking a decades-old deadlock over the management of public lands in the West, Democrats in the House and Senate today agreed to raise the fees that ranchers pay to graze cattle and sheep on about 260 million acres of Federal land in 16 western states.
The agreement appeared to represent an important political victory for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who has staked his tenure on developing a new "land ethic" that puts protecting the environment on equal footing with developing resources.

Greene's Perfect Record In Tatters
The body language spoke of a sad and total surrender.
The power pitcher was overpowered, his fastballs exploding into hits, his night flaming out into ashes.
There is no escape for a pitcher without options.
And so Tommy Greene kept throwing and kept taking it, one fastball after the next, one insult after another.
"Up, up, up," Greene said of his fastball. "You get hurt up."


New York Tightens Law On Community Lending
Can good deeds and civic responsibility be totaled on a calculator?
The New York State Banking Department says they can.
Yesterday, it introduced a complex formula to determine how many dollars a bank should invest in its community.
The Federal Community Reinvestment Act and a similar state law require that banks meet the credit needs of the areas they serve.
But until now, state and Federal regulators have used vague qualitative criteria to grade bank performance.
Banks and community groups have criticized this as inconsistent and ineffective.





Nets Prepare to Open Camp As Coleman Talks Hit Snag
One day after witnessing the retirement of one of the greatest players he ever coached, Chuck Daly had to begin assessing a more practical question: What's in store for his New Jersey Nets this season?
"We're going to have as many as seven new faces, which is a major change for our club," said Daly, who coached Michael Jordan on the 1992 Olympic Dream Team.
As Daly talked today, 18 players wearing Nets uniforms mingled around him in Jadwin Gym for Media Day on the eve of the opening of training camp here.

Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about an Administration task force drafting contingency plans on Cuba misstated the day of its first meeting.

RESULTS PLUS
COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Osborne Gets No. 200  No. 7 Nebraska righted itself after a sluggish first half, getting big plays from its offense and special teams to beat Oklahoma State last night in Stillwater, Okla., and give coach Tom Osborne his 200th victory.
Nebraska (5-0 over all, 1-0 in the Big Eight) hasn't lost to the Cowboys since 1961.
There was a tie in 1973.
The Cornhuskers fell behind by 13-3 in the first half as Oklahoma State (3-2, 0-1) took advantage of good field position and held tailback Calvin Jones in check.
Jones and the rest of the offense got going in the second half, when field position swung in the Cornhuskers' favor.


Tampa Bay Strikes Like Lightning, but Rangers Thunder Back
The Rangers were two goals down to the Tampa Bay Lightning and the game was barely three minutes old.
The goals had been ugly, and the Madison Square Garden crowd was restless and ready to boo.
Behind the New York bench, the new coach, Mike Keenan, looked remarkably calm.
He had a mouthful of ice -- his preferred method of maintaining coolness -- but he carefully restrained himself from spitting it out.
And he barely spoke a word.


RISE OF TB LINKED TO A U.S. FAILURE
Tuberculosis has increased 20 percent since 1985, creating an urban epidemic out of a manageable disease, a Congressional report said today.
The report said the Federal Government had failed every year over that period to supply the money needed to curtail the epidemic.
"All three of the last Administrations, on a bipartisan basis, have ignored the warnings of public health experts," Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said at a bipartisan news conference today.

Bhutto Wins Plurality and Faces a New Struggle
After battling for more than two years to regain the job that was taken away from her in 1990 on charges of corruption and incompetence, Benazir Bhutto appeared today to be on the brink of triumph to return as Prime Minister of Pakistan.
Ms.
Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party captured the most seats in the nation's new 217-member Parliament that was elected on Wednesday, although she fell short of a majority and now faces the task of wooing small parties into joining her in a coalition government.

But, he said, "If we bring something here, it will probably be a new model, and it will probably be an exportable model."

Review/Art; On Top With Pop: A Virtuoso Of Irony
BACK in the early 1960's, when Roy Lichtenstein was scavenging comics like "Winnie Winkle," "G.I. Combat" and "Secret Hearts" ("I don't care! I'd rather sink -- than call Brad for help!"), not even his most ardent admirers could have predicted how rich a creative vein he had tapped.
Everyone saw at the time -- how could they have seen otherwise? -- the giant pin that was Mr.
Lichtenstein's art aimed at the hot-air balloon of Abstract Expressionism.
He was regarded as a saboteur and a provocateur, but how far could he go with those big, cartoonish spoofs?
Very far, it turns out.
So far, in fact, that the end is still not in sight.
What makes the gigantic Roy Lichtenstein retrospective opening today at the Guggenheim Museum so particularly remarkable is this almost miraculous sense of unfolding possibilities.
Ideas tumble out of his work like circus clowns out of a Volkswagen.
By the time you reach the top of the museum's ramp you may well wonder how the same artist who in 1961 was cribbing from an advertisement for Mount Airy Lodge in the Poconos to come up with an image of a girl holding a beach ball could have conceived in the 1980's and early 90's vast compositions that seamlessly weave references to Picasso and Magritte, the Futurists and Expressionists, not to say to Mr.
Lichtenstein himself.


Review/Dance; Graham's Gothic Romance, in Turbulent Motion
Whoever said the tragic and the comic were two sides of the same coin had obviously spent a lifetime watching Martha Graham's dance works.
The darker human passions allowed her to let loose; she could also treat the very same emotions with a lighter touch.
Certainly, one of the most turbulent pieces of Graham's dance theater is "Deaths and Entrances," a 1943 masterpiece powerfully revived on Wednesday night in the Martha Graham Dance Company's current season at City Center (131 West 55th Street, Manhattan).
Ostensibly inspired by the lives and writings of the Bronte sisters, Graham's own Gothic romance is actually a study in human self-realization.


Review/Theater; 'She Loves Me' Bounces to Broadway
"She Loves Me," initially presented by the Roundabout Theater Company, has reopened at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, Manhattan.
Following are excerpts from Frank Rich's review, which appeared in The New York Times on June 11.
Diane Fratantoni has succeeded Judy Kuhn in the role of Amalia Balash.
The first time I ever walked out of a Broadway show was to see "She Loves Me" a second time.
It was Christmas week of 1963, and "She Loves Me," a sensitive flower among hard-edged comic blockbusters like "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," was surely a goner with the New Year.
It was now or never.
I bolted out of the 2 o'clock matinee of another flop (remember "Jennie," anyone?) to take one last look at "She Loves Me" at 3.

Reviews/Film; A Director Who Directs A Life Drama, His Own
Frank Perry's prostate cancer is famous.
He describes exactly how it became well known in "On the Bridge," the autobiographical film he began directing after being diagnosed as terminally ill.
When Mr.
Perry and his small film crew went to a party in East Hampton, L.I., they were spotted by a gossip columnist and became headline news on Page Six of The New York Post ("Director Lensing Own Cancer Fight?").
For this, Mr.
Perry was duly congratulated by his doorman.
"So, how's the cancer?" he was later asked by a reporter from "Entertainment Tonight."
Mr.
Perry, the director of "David and Lisa," "Mommie Dearest" and many other films, could be accused of fomenting this kind of publicity if his film were not so obviously heartfelt.
He seems to have made "On the Bridge" as a means of both fighting his illness and communicating the things he has learned in the process.
As "On the Bridge" follows the frustrating ups and downs of Mr.
Perry's cancer treatment, he pauses at one point after learning some good news.
"I know I'm not out of the woods," he tells his oncologist, "but being in the woods has been wonderful for me." This film, a brave and helpful chronicle of Mr.
Perry's experience, succeeds in making that statement ring true.

Andrea Zittel Andrea Rosen Gallery 130 Prince Street SoHo Through Oct. 16
Andrea Zittel is trying to change the way people live, or at least the way they think about it.
Her new sculptures, which she calls prototypes, include a dishless dining table, sleekly modern chamber pots, and all-purpose covers made of velvet and flannel that can serve as capes or blankets.
One work in progress is a muesli-like mixture of fruits, grains and vegetables that she intends to be a perfectly balanced food.
There are also austere little chambers (not unlike the old-fashioned privy) in which one can sit and be cooled or warmed.
And the coup de grace is the glass-and-stainless-steel "Cleansing Chamber," which can accommodate dishes, vegetables and humans, as well as the family pet.

Bill Scott, a 37-year-old painter and art historian from Philadelphia who is having his first one-man show in Manhattan, works in acrylic on paper with what seems to be the greatest of ease.
His beautifully colored semi-abstract landscapes and garden scenes aren't in the least original; they descend from a long line of improvisational decorative painting that starts with Monet, continues through Bonnard and Joan Mitchell, and includes more realistic lovers of pure color like Lois Dodd and Nell Blaine.


RUSSIA IN MOURNING FOR MOSCOW DEAD
Flags flew at half-staff across Moscow today, even from atop the charred Parliament building, as Russia observed a national day of mourning and families held funerals for those who died in the violence that engulfed the capital on Sunday and Monday.
"Russia, its people and its leaders, must learn a solemn lesson from the bloodshed and do everything in their power so that the tragedy cannot happen again," President Boris N. Yeltsin said in a statement.


Review/Art; The Comic Underground, Where the Funnies Aren't
Comics and cartoons are an indelible fact of American life, and consequently of American art.
At the moment, evidence of their influence can be found, quite literally, all over town, in the Roy Lichtenstein retrospective opening today at the Guggenheim Museum, in Peter Saul's paintings at the Frumkin Gallery on West 57th Street and in the SoHo shows of the young painter Christian Schumann at Postmasters and the sculptor Daniel Weiner at Germans van Eck.
But enough about influence.
A sizable portion of the real thing is now having its say in "Comic Power," a sprawling survey organized by John Carlin and Carlo McCormick, with the assistance of Melissa Rachleff, at Exit Art/The First World, in SoHo.
Admittedly, the comics under scrutiny are not, for the most part, the all-American kind that influenced Pop artists like Mr.
Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol or the lapsed Abstract Expressionist Philip Guston, although a historical section devoted to newspaper comic strips from 1898 to 1945 includes examples of Chester Gould's "Dick Tracy" and George Herriman's "Krazy Kat."

Ron Brown's Evasions
For months Ron Brown has issued assurances that the nasty stories weren't true.
No, he said, he wasn't mixing his private business with his duties as Secretary of Commerce.
Now it emerges that Mr.
Brown not only knew a Vietnamese businessman who was angling for Government favor, but that he actually met the supplicant before and after joining the Administration.
Whether Mr.
Brown discussed payment for helping the businessman by working to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam is a question put before a Federal grand jury in Florida.
The allegations have not been corroborated, and come from a source whose motivation is not clear.
But whatever their truth, Mr.
Brown's evasions have heightened their importance by casting doubt on his willingness to help President Clinton maintain a high moral tone in government.

Books of The Times; Kennedy as President (Stick to the Facts, Please)
President Kennedy  Profile of Power  By Richard Reeves  Illustrated. 798 pages.
Simon &amp; Schuster. $30.
Nearly 30 years have passed since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the dozens of books that have been produced in the wake of his death have left us with wildly divergent readings of both his Presidency and his character.
While his former associates Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and Theodore C. Sorensen worked hard to cement the myth of Camelot, revisionist historians have gone at that myth with sledgehammers.
To Garry Wills ("The Kennedy Imprisonment"), Kennedy was a compulsive risk taker, obsessed with image and style.
To Thomas C. Reeves ("A Question of Character"), he was a liar and a hypocrite, who lacked "a moral center" or any "reference point that went beyond self-aggrandizement."

The viscount, the son of Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, delayed the practice run for 20 minutes with the hope that she would show up, but to no avail.
The rehearsal eventually proceeded with an unidentified female friend standing in, Reuters reported.


Giuliani Says Dinkins Aides Conduct a Smear Campaign
A week after a black minister suggested that Rudolph W. Giuliani was supported by some "fascist" elements, the Republican-Liberal candidate made his most impassioned counterattack of the campaign yesterday, painting a picture of a yearlong, well-orchestrated effort by supporters of Mayor David N. Dinkins to depict him as a dangerous right-wing fanatic surrounded by supporters of the Ku Klux Klan.
Drawing upon remarks as diverse as a year-old editorial in the black-owned Amsterdam News to comments made by several of Mayor Dinkins's top campaign aides in recent months, Mr.
Giuliani appeared visibly angered as he offered instances suggesting that he was a victim of a smear campaign in which nothing had been left to chance.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; In 'Demolition Man,' a car could be your grandson's Oldsmobile.
AN auto maker with a glorious past is using a film of the present to reassure consumers that it has a future.
When Warner Brothers opens "Demolition Man" today at more than 2,000 theaters nationwide, moviegoers watching Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes play cop and robber in the year 2032 can see the results of an unusual product placement promotion by the Oldsmobile division of General Motors.
Rather than simply helping to sell more cars, the promotion is intended to burnish the images of Oldsmobile and G.M. by linking them to the presumed technological wonders of tomorrow.


Not All Knicks Are Happy Campers
Tony Campbell said he will request a trade if his playing time remains as limited as last season.
And while Charles Oakley vowed that he would play with the same intensity, he would not say that he had forgotten the concerns he raised with management during the off season.
These are some of the internal questions facing the Knicks as they begin training camp Friday in Charleston, S.C.
Many teams would love to have the Knicks' problems.
They are coming off a 60-victory season, they are deep and talented, and Michael Jordan's retirement makes New York the consensus favorite to win the National Basketball Association's Eastern Conference championship.


COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Army
When quarterback Rick Roper, completed all six of his passes for 160 yards in the first half against Akron, there was reason to be stunned at Michie Stadium.
The passing game had long been put aside as a weapon by the Cadets, who were devoted to their infantry-like wishbone offense.
Roper, the most versatile quarterback the Army wishbone has had, was 1 for 2 in the second half, and his 171 total passing yards were the most since Tory Crawford had 158 in a 1986 loss to Holy Cross and the most since a former coach, Jim Young, introduced the wishbone in 1984.


Vacant Lots, Except for Red Tape; New York Tries to Improve Management of 14,000 Parcels
For the last six years, Rudolph Graves has been trying to buy the patch of dirt -- a haunt for drug addicts, prostitutes and car thieves, who slip in at night to strip vehicles -- that sits next to his restaurant in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.
He wants to convert it to an outdoor dining patio.
But, he says, during most of that time the city, which owns the lot, has presented him with a maze-like bureaucracy that often didn't answer or return his calls.
The city had no particular policy for what to do with such land, but it did have one rule -- it could not sell the land directly to anyone.


Clinton Confers Awards On 18 Cultural Figures

Business Leaders Voice Skepticism on Health Plan
The chief executives of some of the nation's largest corporations expressed strong skepticism today about President Clinton's plan to overhaul the nation's health care system.
The executives predicted a 3 percent growth in the economy next year but warned that the cost of the health care plan could undermine such a fairly robust rate.


Tailhook Aviators Trying to Regroup
Shunned by the Navy and abandoned by most of its active-duty members and corporate sponsors, the Tailhook Association will gather here this weekend for its first convention since a four-day bacchanal in 1991 transformed a little-known band of aviators into a notorious organization whose name is now synonymous with sexual misconduct.
Gone from this year's convention, organizers say, will be the hospitality suites, where scores of women were assaulted and where fliers exposed their testicles, drank from a dispenser shaped like a rhinoceros penis and wore "Women Are Property" T-shirts.

They still sell their produce and their cider from a stand on Chestnut Ridge Road.
She still lives in the fieldstone bungalow next door that her husband, Frank, built all those years ago.

Phone Calls Bring Pitcher's Best Advice
The telephone calls have been a routine every five days for eight years.
Matching the frequency of a starter's schedule in the rotation, the son would call the father after each professional outing to talk about pitching, people or politics.
It was Pat Hentgen Jr. chatting with Pat Hentgen Sr.
Hentgen will not need spare change for the phone after Friday night's game because his father will be at the Skydome to watch him pitch for the Blue Jays against the White Sox in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series.
While Hentgen will save some quarters, the White Sox will try to rattle the 24-year-old and save their diminishing chances in a series they trail two games to none.


Outside Monitor Endorsed In Police Discipline Effort
The mayoral commission investigating corruption in New York City's Police Department concluded two weeks of hearings yesterday with the city's five district attorneys endorsing the creation of an outside monitor of the department's efforts to stanch corruption.

The district attorneys' comments, coming as the commission begins to consider its conclusions, added momentum to the concept, which appears likely to be the commission's lasting legacy.

From 1896 until his death in 1916, Eugene Druet worked as a photographer for Auguste Rodin, the great French sculptor.

Vietnam Official Denies Brown Was Offered Money for Trade Help
A senior Vietnamese official today denied accusations that his Government had approved payments to Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown or anyone else for lobbying in Washington on behalf of Vietnam.

Dinkins Gets A Researcher On Giuliani
A lawyer who investigated the Nixon White House 20 years ago has been hired by Mayor David N. Dinkins's re-election campaign to research his opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate.

Abroad at Home; Liberty or Autocracy?
There is an instinctive autocrat in Boris Yeltsin.
When the bloody showdown with his parliamentary opponents came, one of his first moves was to close down Pravda and other opposition papers and impose censorship on the rest of the press.
The old Soviet system of silence was recreated with worrying ease.
Bureaucrats appeared at each newspaper, announced that they were censors and demanded office space.
Vladimir Solodin, who had had the job of defending freedom of the press in the Yeltsin Government, switched to be chief of censorship without a visible qualm.


A Legal Advertisement, a Slaying And Then a Free-for-All Over Ethics
When he was killed in a volley of gunfire outside his parents' suburban home, Bernardo Gonzalez, a convicted cocaine trafficker, was a prospective Government witness in a major drug conspiracy trial scheduled here this fall.
Soon afterward, police officers investigating his death came across his name in an advertisement that had been placed last spring, and a new debate on legal ethics erupted.
The advertisement, under the heading "Information Wanted," listed the names of 31 potential witnesses in the drug case and was published in The Champion, the magazine of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.


9 BIG BOND FIRMS CURB THEIR GIVING IN POLITICAL RACES
Nine Wall Street firms that make the most money from selling state and city bond issues around the country said yesterday that they would temporarily abstain from making contributions to public officials or candidates who could give them business.
The curb on contributions comes amid increased scrutiny into how the lucrative business of selling bonds is awarded to financial firms.
These firms have long made generous contributions to candidates for state and local offices around the country.


Bosnian Calls for New Approach to End Civil War
Saying current Geneva peace talks have left him with a choice between "a just defensive war and an unjust peace," the President of the Muslim-dominated Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina called today for a new approach to negotiating an end to the civil war.
In talks with members of the Security Council and subsequently at a news conference, the Bosnian leader, Alija Izetbegovic, said he was tired of negotiations that after a year still have not produced an agreement acceptable to the Muslims.
He said he favored a new round of talks similar to those held by representatives of more than 20 countries in London last August and which authorized the Geneva peace initiative.


Clinton's Serious About Declassification
To the Editor:
"Secrets and More Secrets" (Op-Ed, Sept. 30) by Tom Blanton and Steve Aftergood leaves the impression that the first draft of an executive order on Government classification policy is more restrictive than even President Nixon's order during the cold war.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Although the 1972 Nixon order limited the life span of classified information to 30 years, as opposed to 40 in the current draft, it contained exceptions so broad that in practice they became the rule.


THE SOMALIA MISSION: The Families; Anger and Confusion and Fort Benning
Here at the headquarters of the 75th Ranger Regiment, where the base is preparing for a memorial service on Friday to honor its soldiers who died fighting in Somalia, family members speak of a deep well of anger at the taunting public displays of the dead and confusion about where United States policy is headed.
Families of servicemen serving in Somalia listened to broadcasts of President Clinton's speech on Somalia with a veneer of decorum and devotion to duty.
Several said they were reassured by his promise that the American troops would leave by April.
Others were by turns anxious and relieved about the President's decision to send as many as 2,000 more troops to assist the 4,700 there now -- anxious that more troops would be exposed to danger and relieved that the men there will now have the reinforcements they need.


Russia Has 'Doomsday' Machine, U.S. Expert Says
Russia has a computerized system that can automatically fire its nuclear arsenal in wartime if military commanders are dead or unable to direct the battle, a leading American expert on the Russian military says.
The Russians call it the "dead hand," according to the expert, who personally characterizes it as a doomsday machine.
If the system in fact exists -- and some American intelligence analysts say it is unlikely but possible -- it would mark the first known time in the nuclear era that a machine has been readied to press the button.


Angolans Agree to Revive Talks With Rebels
The Angolan Government agreed today to revive stalled peace talks with rebels in an effort to end the country's 18-year-long civil war.
There was no official word on when or where the talks would take place, but a senior official with the rebel group known as Unita, the acronym in Portuguese for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, said they were expected to begin next week here in the capital of the Ivory Coast, which was also the venue of the last round of peace talks.
The previous negotiations collapsed in May after the warring factions were unable to agree on a cease-fire.

Eichmann was seized in Argentina in 1960 by agents of the Israeli Secret Service, the Mossad.
Isser Harel, chief of Mossad, who headed the operation, told The Jerusalem Post (May 7, 1991), that Mr.
Wiesenthal "had no role whatsoever" in Eichmann's apprehension.
He added: "Information supplied by Wiesenthal before and in anticipation of the operation was utterly worthless."


Lott Lays Into Raiders, Assistant and Schroeder
No one was surprised when Ronnie Lott left the 49ers to sign with the Los Angeles Raiders as a Plan B free agent in 1991.
He had always played Raiders football, even at Southern Cal.
With Lott it was always reckless abandon, full speed ahead and just win, baby.
The shock came when Lott left the Raiders last March to sign with the Jets as an unrestricted free agent.
It was a strange transition for a player who seemed ideally suited for the Silver and Black.
But as it turns out, Lott and the Jets might be a better fit than Lott and the Raiders.
Lott plans to offer proof when the teams play Sunday at the Los Angeles Coliseum.


Lorenzo Gets One More Try At His East Coast Airline
Frank A. Lorenzo's on-again, off-again effort to start a low-cost airline on the East Coast is on again.
The former chairman of Continental Airlines and Texas Air, who has stirred up controversy throughout his career as owner and executive, will get another chance to make his case before an administrative law judge, who ruled a month ago that Mr.
Lorenzo lacked the "proper compliance disposition" to start an airline.


Richard and Gretchen Needham, Chicago Civic Leaders, Are Killed
Richard Henshaw Needham and Gretchen Fentress Needham, both prominent civic leaders in Chicago, died on Monday in an automobile-truck collision near Ankara, Turkey, where they were vacationing.
He was 66 and she 47.
Mr.
Needham was a retired executive of the advertising agency DDB Needham Worldwide Inc., and Mrs.
Needham was a senior vice president of LaSalle Partners, an international real estate and investment firm.


Jury Sees Photos of Trade Center Blast Victims
Despite the objections of defense lawyers, prosecutors in the World Trade Center case yesterday had the jury examine morgue photographs of the six people who were killed in the mammoth explosion that rocked lower Manhattan seven months ago.
The jurors listened attentively and, in at least one case, with tears, as they viewed the photographs and listened to witnesses describe how each of the dead was found and identified.


THE SOMALIA MISSION: Congress; CLINTON GATHERS CONGRESS SUPPORT
Members of Congress rallied strongly behind President Clinton tonight after he pledged to end the American military deployment in Somalia by the end of March, although a few lawmakers expressed concern about his plans to deploy more troops.
Even the harshest critics of the President expressed relief that he had set more clearly limited goals in Somalia and was abandoning his reliance on the United Nations for setting the United States agenda.
Several lawmakers said they hoped the troops could be withdrawn before March 31, but there was general praise for the decision to send Robert Oakley, a diplomat experienced in Somali affairs, to seek a diplomatic solution to the combat in Mogadishu.


A Sex Discrimination Trial Begins for Goldman, Sachs
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company was accused of sex discrimination in a trial that began in Federal court in Manhattan yesterday.
The plaintiff, Joanne T. Flynn, filed the lawsuit against the securities firm in January 1991, nearly two years after she was dismissed from a $180,000-a-year job in Goldman's management and training development department.
She had joined Goldman in 1980.


Jones Seeks Official's Removal
Roy Jones Jr., the International Boxing Federation's middleweight champion, was elated when big-time boxing, thanks to casino gambling, came to Mississippi in the past year.
"The way I drive, it's only 90 minutes from my front door in Pensacola," the Floridian said yesterday.
"It's like having my own Atlantic City or Las Vegas to fight in."


THE SOMALIA MISSION: Forces; How Powerful U.S. Units Will Work
President Clinton's decision to double the American ground force in Somalia is intended to address what the military viewed as basic flaws in the existing arrangement: its lack of adequate power, its vaguely defined mission and its tangled chain of command.
Stung by criticisms of the Pentagon's leadership on all three counts, senior officials said today that from now until the mission ended, they wanted it to be unambiguously directed and unambiguously powerful.

Sports of The Times; McGriff's Explosive Homer
THE night Fred McGriff joined the Braves in July, there was a fire.
Last night he ignited an explosion.
With two out and Otis Nixon on second base in the first inning of the second game of the National League Championship Series against the Phillies, the Braves' lean first baseman swung at Tommy Greene's first pitch, a fastball.
The sound resembled that of a rifle shot.
The ball was hit so hard that many spectators never saw it crash into the upper deck in right field.

On Stage, and Off
Musing Over a 'Sunset'
The rumors that Patti LuPone will not make it to New York next fall as the star of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical "Sunset Boulevard" remain just rumors, at least for now.
A statement this week by Patrick McKenna, chairman of the Really Useful Group, the show's producers, called the debate over Ms.
LuPone's future in the role of the fading movie queen Norma Desmond "a non-issue." In what amounts to not quite a guarantee, he added: "We are very happy with Patti and look forward to seeing her play the role of Norma on Broadway."
In a voluble interview on Tuesday, Ms.
LuPone herself said Mr.
McKenna and Mr.
Lloyd Webber had said similar things to her, though truth be told she didn't exactly sound reassured, and admitted to being shaken by the media's apparent conviction that she is on short time.

Amid the Tension, a Rush to Repose
Murky, tortuous play led to a tense draw by Gary Kasparov and Nigel Short in Game 14 of their world championship match yesterday in London.
Short had been pressing hard, yet toward the end Kasparov had what was probably a slight advantage and could have continued to try for a victory.
Of course, with a 5-point lead, with the score now at 9 1/2-4 1/2, the Russian had no need to take any risks.
Kasparov will win a prize of $1.43 million out of a $2.55 million purse by gaining 3 more points in the 24-game match.
A novel feature this time is that all games are to be played out, even if Kasparov decides the series in less than the maximum.


Do Something to Fix Our Wasteful Jury System
To the Editor:
Re: "New York Casts for Solutions to Gaping Holes in Juror Nets" (front page, Sept. 26):
You seem more concerned about the "gaping holes" than in using well those of us who have been caught in the juror net -- of whom I am one.
True, I have had deferments because I am self-employed and was called when to serve would have required me to break contractual obligations that would have seriously jeopardized my career and earning ability.

For top law graduates, selecting a law firm is a bit like finding the prize in a box of Cracker Jack.
First you have to sift through all the sticky sweet stuff.
Then what you find, hidden inside a wrapper, always looks the same.

Now two enterprising Harvard Law School students -- whose classwork was evidently dull enough to leave them itching for a challenge and easy enough to let them pull it off -- have set out to demystify the process.

THE SOMALIA MISSION: Analysis; An Old Cold War Refrain
The phrases resounded through political Washington all week in an insistent, Kissinger-esque echo of an era that had supposedly ended.
"We can't just cut and run," the policy makers said again and again after Sunday's battle in Mogadishu.
"It would send the wrong signal."
In his speech today, President Clinton joined the chorus.
If the United States left Somalia now, he said, "our leadership in world affairs would be undermined at the very time when people are looking to America to help promote peace and freedom in the post-cold-war world, and all around the world, aggressors, thugs and terrorists will conclude that the best way to get us to change our policies is to kill our people."


Gunmen and Police Brutally Enforce Strike in Haiti
One day after United States and Canadian forces started to arrive, plainclothes gunmen opposed to the restoration of democracy in Haiti sprayed automatic-weapons fire at street merchants and successfully shut down this city.
The gunmen collaborated openly with uniformed Haitian police, the very forces who are supposed to be retrained by international police experts as part of a diplomatic settlement of Haiti's political crisis.

Dinkins Opposes Shortening School Year Below 180 Days
Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday urged the Board of Education not to shorten the school year below the 180-day minimum set by state law and warned that he would hold the school system financially responsible for the potential loss of $10 million a day in state aid.
Mr.

Columbia Healthcare Reaches New Accord
The Columbia Healthcare Corporation, continuing its aggressive move to form alliances and broaden its reach, today announced an agreement to jointly provide services with Medical Care America Inc., the nation's largest outpatient surgery center.

The new company, to be called the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, would have more than 48,000 licensed beds in 26 states and annual revenues of more than $10 billion.


Art in Review
Gary Simmons  Metro Pictures  150 Greene Street (at Houston Street)  SoHo  Through Oct. 23
Gary Simmons's show consists primarily of large paintings on unstretched tarpaulins that set words and images in the center of a monochromatic field to look like advertising logos.
In fact, the words are derived from rap music and street lingo, and most of the emblems are of Mr.
Simmons's own invention.
"Phillie Blunt Land" refers to marijuana, as a painted wreath of leaves suggests, and "Ill Street Blues" is the title of a song whose angry message is reflected in the image of a police badge emblazoned with a Ku Klux Klan figure.


Retailers' September Sales Rose

For Black Caucus, Farrakhan Embrace Marked Independence
To the Editor:
"The Black Caucus Gets Mugged" (editorial, Sept. 25), in scolding Representative Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, for embracing Minister Louis Farrakhan at the caucus's annual legislative conference, betrays the attitude that white people have the right to tell black leaders -- in this case, leading members of Congress -- with whom they may and may not associate.
Unfortunately, this attitude is endemic in the editorial boardrooms of the corporate-owned white news media; recently, The Village Voice attempted to pillory State Senator David A. Paterson for accepting financial and political support for his campaign for New York City public advocate from me, another independent black leader deemed unacceptable by the mostly white Democratic Party and those who speak for it.


Whitman and Florio Spar in a Civilized Gubernatorial Debate
In a debate civilized in its tone but full of pointed attacks, Gov.
Jim Florio, the Democratic incumbent, and Christine Todd Whitman, his Republican rival, sparred tonight before a statewide television audience.
The debate was the first time since the general election campaign began in June that voters statewide had the chance to compare the candidates side by side and to get more than the one-sided information that could be gleaned from either candidate's ads.


A Man Given to Lofty Highs And Subterranean Lows
"Mr. Jones" finds Richard Gere working at full throttle to play the manic-depressive of the title, a man who has so few ties to ordinary life that he doesn't even admit to knowing his real name.
Soaring on a high that appears endless, Mr.
Jones is someone who can pick up a pretty bank teller (Lisa Malkiewicz), whisk her away on a spree involving a hotel room, a limousine and concert tickets, and only get into trouble when he tries to conduct a symphony orchestra as it plays Beethoven's "Ode to Joy." It turns out the symphony already has a conductor.
Behavior like this, and his habit of trying to fly off a rooftop when he becomes excited by airplanes overhead, lands Mr.
Jones in the care of Dr.
Libbie Bowen (Lena Olin), a psychiatrist who can best be described as dedicated.
Libbie is also lonely, having recently been separated from her husband, and she is not immune to Mr.
Jones's charms.
Regardless of whether it is easy to flirt while remaining strapped to a hospital bed, Mr.
Jones finds a way to do so.
He and Libbie share a couple of warm, friendly outings that would hold great romantic promise if Mr.
Jones were not constantly ricocheting in and out of hospital wards.

Health Insurance Data Called Faulty
The White House estimates of insurance costs for individuals and families in President Clinton's health plan were sophisticated guesses based on incomplete and largely outdated information.
That is the conclusion of actuaries from several large accounting organizations who reviewed the estimating process for the Administration.
The actuaries said the estimates were probably as accurate as possible, given the surprising dearth of up-to-date information on medical costs for various groups.
But health care experts warned that the nation should be aware of the uncertainty over future insurance costs as it debates how to extend universal coverage and overhaul the health care system.

Toni Morrison Is '93 Winner Of Nobel Prize in Literature
Toni Morrison, the author of "Song of Solomon" "Beloved," "Jazz" and other lyrically narrated novels of black American life, has won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Literature.
The announcement was made yesterday in Stockholm by the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy, which stated that Ms.
Morrison "gives life to an essential aspect of American reality" in novels "characterized by visionary force and poetic import."
Calling Ms.
Morrison "a literary artist of the first rank," the academy statement went on to say: "She delves into the language itself, a language she wants to liberate from the fetters of race. And she addresses us with the luster of poetry."


Review/Film; Waking Up In a Future Of Muscles
The ads for "Demolition Man" feature head shots of Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes as they face each other across a short expanse of space, much like the recent ads for "Rising Sun" in which Mr.
Snipes faced Sean Connery.
Don't be put off, though.
"Demolition Man," though sleazy, is better than "Rising Sun."
For one thing, its antecedents are more impressive.
"Demolition Man" is a futuristic action-melodrama that looks as if it had been conceived by film students who adore Woody Allen's "Sleeper." That classic, you may remember, is about the part-owner of the Happy Carrot Health Food Restaurant who goes into the hospital for minor surgery in 1973, only to awaken 200 years later after being accidently frozen.


A New Breed of Merger Banker
Way back in the 1980's, when mergers were all the rage on Wall Street, the names of those involved in the deals occasionally eclipsed the companies that were being combined.

A Last Chance for a Place in the Sun Until Spring


Special Fund At Hospital In a Dispute
As countywide elections draw near, a dispute broke out today over a special fund at the Westchester County Medical Center that is supposed to be spent primarily for research and equipment but that was apparently used to pay for catered parties, tickets to charity dinners and retirement gifts.
Trying to reduce the political fallout, Andrew P. O'Rourke, the County Executive who is seeking re-election next month, asked for three county employees who serve as officers of the special fund to resign their fund positions.
One employee is Mack L. Carter Jr., whom Mr.

Lifting the Memory of Slavery Into the Realm of Myth
Violent, heart-wrenching events occur in Toni Morrison's fiction: a fleeing slave cuts the throat of her baby daughter with a handsaw; a cosmetics salesman hunts down his mistress and shoots her dead; an old woman burns her own son to death for having become a junkie.
These are not random, senseless deaths, but deaths wrought by history, by decades of familial disappointment and pain and an ineradicable racial memory of slavery and betrayal.
In fact, for Ms.
Morrison's characters, "caught midway between was and must be," innocence does not exist.

Hampton (and Giants' Offense?) Out After Surgery
It looks as if the only thing standing between Rodney Hampton and the Pro Bowl is his knee.
The Giants' main offensive weapon and the National Football League's second-leading rusher had arthoscopic surgery on his left knee today and will miss the next two big division games against the Redskins and Eagles.
The surgery was to remove cartilage in the knee, and the good news for the Giants is that he could return in three to four weeks.
Nevertheless, the Giants' backfield is beaten up.
Fullback Jarrod Bunch probably won't play in Washington on Sunday because an infection from pneumonia that has plagued him for over a week has left the lining of his throat so irritated he can hardly breath without coughing.


Report Revises Times in Train Wreck
The nation's worst train wreck in decades occurred just a few minutes after a towboat pilot, lost in a predawn fog, mistook a railroad bridge for a barge and inadvertently rammed it as Amtrak's Sunset Limited was bearing down on the span, Federal investigators believe.
The bridge collapsed as the train sped onto it, the investigators said, plunging three engines and four cars into a Mobile River backwater, the Big Bayou Canot, near Mobile, Ala., at 2:50 A.M. on Sept. 22.
Forty-seven people were killed in the crash.


Subway Crash In Brooklyn Injures 45
A Manhattan-bound subway train that had just rounded a sharp curve rear-ended another train that had stopped in a Brooklyn station last night, jolting dozens of startled passengers out of their seats.
At least 45 people were taken to hospitals with what officials described as minor injuries, mostly cuts and bruises.
A Transit Authority spokesman, Jared Lebow, said the tracks in the Graham Avenue station on the L line did not appear to have been damaged, and the wreckage would be cleared in time for the morning rush today.
Crash Cause Is Unknown
The crash raised questions about safety and the signal system on the L line, especially how the second train got close enough to ram the first one and whether there were any similarities to the fatal derailment of an IRT No. 4 train at the Union Square station in Manhattan in 1991.
Soon after that accident, transit officials changed safety procedures and began installing automatic braking systems to stop trains traveling too fast near dangerous curves.
In response to that accident, officials also said they were equipping trains with speedometers and "black box" recorders like those on airplanes.

The Dead Sea Scrolls: Fragile and Remarkable
IT was easy to agree with the curator of the new exhibition on the Dead Sea Scrolls at the New York Public Library.
As he showed some visitors around, Dr.
Leonard Singer Gold, the curator and chief of the library's Jewish division, remarked, "You'll see these scroll fragments are small, difficult to read and not particularly interesting visually."
That they are, all 12 of the small fragments of those precious documents from the time and place where the foundations of rabbinic Judaism were laid and where Christianity was born.
They are faded with age, almost to the point of illegibility.
They are so fragile they look as though they might crumble to dust before your eyes.
How could anything so unprepossessing provoke such scholarly controversy and succeed as the centerpiece of a major cultural exhibition?


TV Weekend; Lemmon and Broderick in Early, Gentle Mamet
David Mamet was 25 when he wrote his basically two-character play "A Life in the Theater." With Gregory Mosher as director, the play had its premiere at the Goodman Theater's Stage 2 in Chicago in 1977.
Now, several stage productions later, Mr.
Mamet, continuing his long collaboration with Mr.
Mosher, has adapted "A Life in the Theater" for television.
It begins an extensive run on TNT tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight.
The stars are Jack Lemmon and Matthew Broderick, who, working splendidly in tandem, are each at peak best.
The stage play takes place almost entirely in a shared dressing room of a rundown theater way off Broadway.
For television, it has been, as they say, opened up, the camera wandering around the outside world of streets and restaurants, modest apartments and shabby hotel rooms.
Robert (Mr. Lemmon) is a veteran actor on the way down; John (Mr. Broderick) is a young man who could be on the way up, possibly to a film career.
Robert offers a characteristically haughty take on movies: "As the old whore said, another great profession ruined by amateurs."


Teaching Tolerance in Workplaces: A Seattle Program Illustrates Limits
When the nation's largest ferry system started a costly training program to promote greater tolerance among employees, it was intended to be "shock therapy," as one official called it -- a sort of cultural boot camp for the deckhands, seamen, captains and mates steeped in sailor traditions.
One by one they came off the boats and into the training room, all 1,500 employees of the Washington State Ferry System.
They were told not to say "gals" or "ladies," instructed to call blacks "people of color" and reminded that while some traditional maritime terms may be nautically correct on Puget Sound, they are offensive to some people.


Pentagon and State Dept. at Odds Over Sending of Soldiers to Haiti
As the Clinton Administration struggles to find a way out of Somalia, the Pentagon and State Department are locked in a last-minute dispute over the deployment of hundreds of American military trainers and engineers to Haiti during the next two weeks, senior Administration officials said today.
Under a United Nations-brokered agreement reached with Haiti's military leaders last summer to restore the exiled President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power by Oct. 30, the United States promised to send troops as part of a United Nations force.
American and Canadian troops are to retrain Haiti's military, while police officers from France, Canada, Madagascar, Tunisia, Algeria and other French-speaking countries are to help create an independent police force.

Uruguay Has History Of a Free Judiciary

Judges are appointed by the Supreme Court, which is appointed by Congress.
In almost every case this century, Congress has drawn from the senior judges on the Courts of Appeal to make their appointments to the Supreme Court.

Irish Chief Backs Peace Plan and Will See British
The Prime Minister of Ireland, Albert Reynolds, endorsed a new peace initiative for Northern Ireland today and said he would discuss it with the British.
The initiative was advanced by the two most influential Roman Catholic leaders in Northern Ireland, John Hume, head of the moderate Social Democratic Labor Party, and Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
If successful, it would lead to the first direct negotiations between Sinn Fein and the British since the mid-1970's.


Harvard Journal; All-Male Club Opens Its Door Warily
You could almost feel sorry for them.
There they were, Harvard men at the Fly Club, surrounded by stuffed moose heads and dusty bound volumes of English magazines, discussing their hopes that the alums will allow a few women into their 157-year-old once-fashionable institution.
And yet even as they express eagerness to take this giant stride into the 20th century, the young club men have to bear the scorn of those on campus who think, wrongly perhaps, that they are all rich elitists.
One young member, who said he is on financial aid, said he was afraid to tell people that he has two middle names.


Two Large Waste Haulers Call Off Proposed Merger

What, Me Envy?
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL understands the importance of being surrounded by talented players, he said yesterday, so he is not about to lose sleep over no longer being the most highly paid member of the Orlando Magic.
With a seven-year, $40 million basketball contract of his own, plus millions of dollars more in endorsements, the 7-foot-1-inch All-Star center said it mattered little to him that the rookie ANFERNEE HARDAWAY signed the second-richest deal in pro team sports Thursday night.


THE SOMALIA MISSION: Victims; 2 Wounded Rangers Tell Of an Ordeal Under Fire
A few hours after arriving here from Mogadishu with a sliver of shrapnel in his brain from Sunday's battle there, Sgt. 1st Class Richard Lamb heard that President Clinton had decided to double the size of the American force in Somalia.
Despite his pain, Sergeant Lamb, 34, an Army Ranger from Des Moines, Iowa, was cheered.
"The situation's changed," he said today at the Army's Second General Hospital, where he is recovering.
"The United States has got a little more focus now, on how to make the city safe."


Voting on Future of an Island Home; New Yorkers of Puerto Rican Heritage Cast Their Ballots
Petra Almodovar, 62, walked into a Manhattan center for the elderly clutching a birth certificate yellowed from age but still legible.
In another center, Rafael Cintron, 71, brought a plastic bag with his honorable discharge papers from the Army.
They offered the records as proof that they were of Puerto Rican heritage so they could could participate in a vote that, although symbolic, gave them a say for the first time in the political future of the island they each left more than 30 years ago.

Review/Film Festival; A Boy as the Metaphor For His Homeland
In his deceptively easygoing film, "Wendemi," S. Pierre Yameogo, a film maker from Burkina Faso, uses the story of an abandoned child as a metaphor for a society that is drifting in a kind spiritual and political limbo.
When Cecile (Sylvie Yameogo), an unwed mother-to-be, refuses to identify the father of her child, she is thrown out of her parents' home and eventually leaves her baby in a field, where another family finds him and takes him home.
Michel (Alassane Dakissaga), the head of the household, reluctantly assumes responsibility for the baby after going to the police, the local priest and the traditional village chief, each of whom advises him to seek the counsel of another authority.


Turkey Has Good Claim to Gold of Troy
To the Editor:
In "Who Owns the Gold of Troy?" (Editorial Notebook, Sept. 26), Karl E.

Nice touch by the Greeks to put the dispute to rest where the amateur archeologist Schliemann spent his last days.

Judge Considering Offer of Bail To Defendant in Bomb-Plot Case
The judge in the case of the foiled plot to bomb New York City targets said yesterday that he was considering releasing one of the 15 defendants on bail.
All have so far been denied bail and remain in jail on the ground that they pose a danger to the community and might flee.
At a bail hearing at Federal District Court in Manhattan for the defendant, Earl Gant of Philadelphia, his lawyer, Andrew Patel, argued that Mr.
Gant had become involved with the other defendants under the impression that he was being recruited to fight for Muslims in Bosnia.
Mr.
Patel said that secretly recorded tapes of conversations between Mr.
Gant and a Government informer showed that Mr.
Gant had been unaware of any plot to bomb the United Nations and Hudson River tunnels. 'A Close Issue'
A Government prosecutor, Robert Khuzami, contended that Mr.
Gant had agreed to provide guns for the plot and had taken part in paramilitary training in a Brooklyn safe house.

Bell Gripes But Still Rides Pine
Maybe George Bell should criticize Manager Gene Lamont before every game.
Sounds silly?
Well, one day after Bell berated Lamont, the White Sox toppled the Blue Jays, 6-1.
Incidentally, Bell did not play for the third straight game.
One pertinent question filling the Skydome before the game was this: Have the White Sox been more embarrassing on the field or off it in the first two games?
Because of Bell and Bo Jackson, the answer was arguable.


Clinton Sounds A Rallying Cry: Security for All
President Clinton said today that the Democratic Party should seize the theme of personal security, which he is already using to promote his health care package, as a way of persuading Americans to rally behind his proposals on everything from the economy to crime to trade.
In an address to the fall meeting of the Democratic National Committee, Mr.
Clinton made only a passing reference to the American military deployment in Somalia, saying it was most important that the public focus on matters at home.

Coleman Case Delayed
The case against Vince Coleman, the left fielder the Mets say will never play for them again because of a fireworks incident outside Dodger Stadium in July, might be headed for trial.
Coleman was scheduled to be arraigned in Los Angeles Superior Court this morning on felony charges, but his attorney, Robert Shapiro, asked for a two-week delay and was granted it.
At issue are the size and power of the explosive device Coleman admits to throwing from a car in the Dodger Stadium parking lot.
The device injured three bystanders, including a 3-year-old girl.
Shapiro contends Coleman dropped "a large firecracker, not dynamite, TNT or a bomb," and should be charged with a misdemeanor.


Space Deal Seen as Near For Marietta
The Martin Marietta Corporation has been negotiating for several weeks to buy the space division of the General Dynamics Corporation, and a formal agreement could be announced as early as next week, aerospace industry executives familiar with the talks said today.
The executives, who spoke on the condition that they remain anonymous, did not disclose specifics of the deal, which would represent a significant consolidation of the commercial satellite-launching business in the United States.
Analysts estimated that the General Dynamics unit could sell for $250 million to $350 million.

Ian Burn, 53, Artist, Writer and Founder Of an Artists' Union
Ian Burn, an Australian Conceptual artist, writer and unionist who worked and exhibited in the United States and Europe in the 1970's with the Art and Language collective, died on Sept. 29 in Milton, Australia.
He was 53 and lived in Rozelle, a suburb of Sydney.
Mr.

Benazir Bhutto's Long Road Back
In 1988, Benazir Bhutto became the first woman to lead a Government in an Islamic country.
But in nearly two years as Pakistan's Prime Minister, she impressed neither friend or foe.
Her People's Party failed to enact a single measure of any consequence.
Dismissed from office by a hostile President on charges of abuse of power, Ms.
Bhutto was beaten at the polls by Nawaz Sharif.
Now, in a dramatic comeback, her left-of-center party has just outvoted Mr.
Sharif's business-oriented Pakistan Muslim League.
This is sweet vindication for Benazir Bhutto, and for the most part, good news for Pakistan.
The big losers were militant Islamic parties, which won only 9 seats in the 217-seat Parliament.
After years of dictatorship and turbulence, Pakistan seems to be evolving a stable two-party system.
Mr.
Sharif has emerged as a leader in his own right, and can no longer be dismissed as a tool of the military.
If Ms.
Bhutto can cobble together a majority coalition, and if her party runs well in today's provincial elections, she will have a promising fresh shot at power.

After China's Nuclear Blast
President Francois Mitterrand of France had the right response to China's reckless test of a nuclear warhead this week: he urged other nuclear-armed states to "keep their cool" and not follow suit.
President Clinton would be wise to take his advice.
The spread of nuclear arms to states that don't yet have them would pose much more menace to U.S. security than would a new Chinese warhead.
That's why ending the U.S. moratorium on testing would be a mistake; it would only weaken worldwide support for tighter restraints on proliferation.


3 Belmont Trainers Set Down
Three trainers were suspended at Belmont Park yesterday after their horses had tested positive for cocaine, but two of them appealed the decision by the stewards and the penalties were deferred until their appeals are heard.
Peter Ferriola and John Mazza were suspended for 60 days each, as they had predicted last week when the test findings were reported.
They have both denied giving cocaine to their horses, but the stewards noted that trainers were ultimately accountable even if their horses absorbed drugs being used by stable workers.


Numbers Show Contract Plan Works Well, Mayor Reports
Mayor David N. Dinkins released statistics yesterday that he says prove that his affirmative action program has doubled minority and female contractors' share of city business at almost no cost to the taxpayers.
He also used the occasion to attack the plan of his opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to dismantle the program.
The Mayor said the city has increased the dollar amount of city contracts awarded to female- and minority-owned companies from 9 percent in 1989 and 1990 to 17.5 percent last year.
This was achieved, city officials said, primarily through aggressive recruitment and by splitting contracts into smaller sizes that the typically smaller, minority- and female-owned companies are better able to compete for.


Stock Group Does Well and Gold Still Leads
The stock market perked up in the third quarter.
The average American stock fund rose 5.3 percent, a bigger gain than in the entire first half.
The result: a respectable return of 10.9 percent for stock funds through Oct. 1.
Despite a bad stumble in the last three months, gold remains in the lead for the year to date.
Among the 16 stock fund categories tracked by Morningstar Inc., gold was the only loser in the third quarter, dropping 10.1 percent.

Rally Sends 30-Year Yield Below 6%
Bond market investors interpreted the September employment report as strong evidence of a weak American economy, and they sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond plunging to 5.92 percent yesterday.
More than any other security, the 30-year bond reflects the opinions of millions of bondholders concerning inflation, and yesterday by buying the bonds in big quantities -- driving up the price and driving down the yield -- they voted that inflation was unlikely to rise in the foreseeable future.


Review/Film Festival; Young and Gay, and Opinionated About It
"Everything that homos are supposed to like -- disco music, drag shows, Joan Crawford -- I hate," says one of the characters in "Totally F***ed Up," Gregg Araki's fractured, corrosive portrait of a group of gay comrades.
Mr.
Araki, who has described his film as a "ragtag story of the fag-and-dyke teen underground," brings an angry intelligence to bear upon disaffected characters, so that his work plays vigorously as part movie, part manifesto.
"Formally, the picture's use of an exploded, free-associative narrative and direct-to-camera address is as radical as the 60's French New Wave (or its rip-off, 90's MTV)," Mr.
Araki has also written, none too bashfully, about his film.
In its closing credits, where friends and sponsors are usually thanked, he also includes a colorful "no thanks" to "you all know who you are." And the asterisks in the title amount to more of the same.


Marcel Marien, 73, Associate of Magritte
Marcel Marien, a publisher, artist and writer and one of the last of the circle of Belgian Surrealists who gathered around the painter Rene Magritte, died on Sept. 19 in Schaerdeeck, a suburb of Brussels.
He was 73.
Mr.
Marien was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1920, into a poor family, and apprenticed to a photographer at age 15.
In 1937, he encountered Magritte's paintings in an exhibition and sought out the artist.
Within the year, he had his own work included in an exhibition of the close-knit Belgian Surrealist group.
Although he worked as a photographer, collagist, film maker and critic, his main achievement was as a chronicler of the Belgian Surrealists' activities and a publisher of their writings.

THE SOMALIA MISSION: Analysis; The U.N.'s Glow Is Gone
After embracing the United Nations as the global peacemaker of the future, President Clinton has broken sharply with it over Somalia, signaling the Administration's intense displeasure with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and complicating United States participation in peacekeeping operations elsewhere.
In his television address on Thursday, Mr.
Clinton said in effect that after scores of Americans were killed or wounded in a United Nations-led raid in Mogadishu on Sunday, the United States would have no choice but to go it alone.
Although he did not say it out loud, another message came through loud and clear: the United Nations is not up to the job.


Officer Is Struck by a Thrown Bucket and Killed
A housing police officer was killed last night after he was struck in the head by a five-gallon bucket of spackling compound thrown off a roof in Washington Heights, the police said.
The plastic bucket of plaster was thrown, by an unidentified assailant, after a confrontation over a car-towing operation on West 175th Street.
The officer, identified as John Williamson, 25, died at 11:25 P.M. at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, said Amanita Duga-Carroll, a spokeswoman for the housing police.
He had been on the force for three years, she said.


U.S. Inquiry On Delta's Commissions
The Justice Department said yesterday that it was investigating Delta Air Lines and its agreements with travel agents in Salt Lake City because of concern that those deals may give the carrier an unfair advantage over a smaller competitor.
The investigation centers around so-called commission overrides, essentially bonuses for travel agencies that sell a certain number of tickets.
While this is a common practice in the airline industry, Delta was apparently also rewarding agents for not booking on rival Morris Air, which is based in Salt Lake City and serves cities in the Midwest and West, people familiar with details of the investigation said yesterday.

Review/Film Festival; First the Murders, Then the Merchandising
In January 1991, Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute in her late 20's, admitted to the murders of seven men, each picked up on a Florida highway, which was her usual venue.
Some months later, after pleading no contest to the murders, Ms.
Wuornos was sentenced to six life sentences, though she had been tried for only one of the murders.
The press and especially the television tabloid shows had a field day with the story about what they called "the man-hating murderer," apparently because Ms.
Wuornos was an admitted lesbian.
It was Tyria Moore, her lover, who tricked Ms.
Wuornos into a confession during a telephone call monitored by the police.
One immediate result of all this public interest: "Overkill," the television feature in which Jean Smart played Ms.
Wuornos.


Gag Reflex Is Sprague's Only Reflex
Reflexes.
Ed Sprague said the pivotal play amounted to reflexes.
If Sprague had reacted quickly to Frank Thomas's sizzling grounder in the third inning, he would have notched the third out and the sputtering White Sox would have remained scoreless.
No reflexes.
Sprague did not react properly to the playable grounder.
The third baseman inexplicably thought about backhanding the one-hop grounder that was hit at him, instead it slithered through his legs to score Chicago's first run.
What was generously scored as a single kept the inning alive and also kept the White Sox breathing as they scored five runs in the third and breezed to a 6-1 victory over the Blue Jays tonight.


THE SOMALIA MISSION: Pentagon; Clinton Defends Aspin on Action Regarding Request for U.S. Tanks
President Clinton defended Secretary of Defense Les Aspin today against criticism from Capitol Hill, but made clear that he had no role in Mr.
Aspin's decision not to send armored reinforcements to the American force in Somalia last month.
Mr.
Aspin acknowledged on Thursday that he had erred in rejecting a request from military commanders for four tanks and 14 Bradley Fighting Vehicles for American troops in Somalia.
Some political figures in Washington have asserted that the equipment would have prevented some or all of the American casualties in a clash in Mogadishu last weekend.

Oilers Have Finished Look In Rout of Aimless Islanders
The Islanders are going to Disneyland on Sunday, but the trip isn't the traditional promotional reward for victors after a championship.

The second came tonight, a 5-1 embarrassment against the Edmonton Oilers at Northlands Coliseum.


Concern About Toll Robberies Leads to Heightened Security
Responding to a record increase in tollbooth robberies, the agencies that run New York City's major bridges and tunnels have quietly deployed more armed police officers at 15 crossings and are using more video monitors and an array of tactics to deter, detect and snare drive-by bandits.
Besides facing more officers and guns and having his face and license number captured on tape, the would-be robber nowadays also may find less money available at the booths, an improved radio system for police chases, a $10,000 price on his head and an "800" number for informers to turn him in, officials said.


Workfare's Limitations
To the Editor:
Everything in "Westchester's Workfare Works, So Why Not New York City's?" (letter, Sept. 28) by Andrew O'Rourke is right on, except what he states I said in my Sept. 4 Op-Ed article.
I believe firmly that able-bodied welfare recipients should work for the public good, and I'm a big supporter of workfare.
My point was that without serious efforts to train workers on the job, workfare becomes a treadmill that does not give participants the skills to escape the welfare system and find full-time jobs.
I also made the point that without sufficient training, workfare participants are of limited use in public service jobs.

Observer; Make It Bill and Lyndon
Although President Clinton has always invited us to think of him as the Jack Kennedy of the 1990's generation, the more I watch him the more he reminds me of Lyndon Johnson.
Physically he is a big man, like Johnson, with bad eating habits, like Johnson, and is a prodigious energy burner, like Johnson.
Johnson, like Clinton, was minutely informed on the tiniest point of the smallest piece of legislation and could talk about it until you screamed for mercy.
Like Johnson, Clinton is a product of segregation-cursed Southern politics where a man with the slightest liberal temperament, especially on the race issue, had to be as cunning and often as unscrupulous as a Borgia to survive.

Pessimism in Haiti: Violence Could Swamp Diplomacy
Just three weeks before Haiti's exiled President is to be restored to power, many Haitians are expressing doubts about whether a peaceful return to democracy is possible in the climate of growing violence here.
One reason for the fear is a lack of faith in the foreign force that is envisioned as the glue to hold together this country's negotiated political settlement.
The 1,300-member contingent of troops and policemen coming in will carry nothing more powerful than handguns and will not be authorized to stop violence.
A warship carrying about 250 American soldiers left a naval base in Puerto Rico today and another ship with 300 more troops was preparing to depart, the Pentagon said.

"You saw him every day," remembered Leo Hill, 66, a Greenville lawyer who grew up in the neighborhood where Jackson's store was situated.
"We all knew he was basically illiterate, and we didn't want to embarrass him by asking for his autograph."

Zubov, Norstrom Sent Down
With the Rangers' minor league club in Binghamton scheduled to open its season this weekend, Coach Mike Keenan has decided to send down two of the 10 defensemen he was been carrying on the roster -- Mattias Norstrom and Sergei Zubov.
Norstrom, a rookie, was impressive in preseason, but it has been assumed by Rangers' management since the start of camp that he needs more time in the minors.
Zubov has gone from being a defenseman with the most ice time at the end of last season to almost a non-entity in Keenan's system.


New York Hospitals Foresee Loss Of Billions Under Clinton's Plan
Already facing chronic money problems, New York City's hospitals said yesterday that they would lose about $4 billion in Government revenue, or about 4 percent of the hospitals' total budgets, in the first five years of President Clinton's proposed national health plan.
In perhaps the first detailed look at how the Clinton proposal could affect local health care providers, the Greater New York Hospital Association said that cuts in Medicare and Medicaid would far outweigh increases in aid for people who now lack health insurance.
Cuomo Meets With Moynihan
The hospital association's report is a first step in what promises to be intense jockeying among interest groups in the health care industry that hope to reshape the Administration's plan to guarantee health care to all Americans.
In New York City, for example, although hospitals stand to lose revenue, some clinics, doctors and other health care providers may receive more money.

The President officially came to New Jersey to lobby in support of his health care package.
But in one short speech before an enthusiastic crowd at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Mr.
Clinton managed, through the issue of violence in America, to link his health care proposals to one of the most popular planks in Mr.
Florio's campaign: gun control.


Yeltsin Suspends the Communist Party and Other Foes

That brings to 10 the number of political parties and organizations suspended, as well as some 13 newspapers.
The state of emergency is scheduled to end on Sunday, but it could be extended.

Ruling on Inmate's Return to New York Creates Death-Penalty Quandary for Cuomo
A Federal judge created a moral and political quandary for Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo today by ordering that an Oklahoma death-row inmate be returned to New York to finish a sentence of 20 years to life for murder rather than fulfilling the inmate's wish to be executed immediately.
The dilemma was created by the second part of the ruling, which allows Mr.
Cuomo, an ardent opponent of the death penalty, to waive Thomas Grasso's return to New York.


RESULTS PLUS
TROTTING  American Winner Last  American Winner's bid to become trotting's first triple crown champion in 21 years ended in embarrassment yesterday.
The 3-year-old colt, driven by Ron Pierce, broke stride repeatedly in the second heat of the 101st Kentucky Futurity at Lexington, Ky., and finished last.
His chief nemesis, Pine Chip, stormed to a record-setting victory by six and a half lengths.
After finishing second to Pine Chip in the first heat by a stunning eight lengths, American Winner, who captured the Yonkers Trot and Hambletonian earlier in the year, figured to come back with a fury in the second heat.
Instead, he finished eighth in the 8-horse field, 24 lengths behind Pine Chip, who was driven by John Campbell.
Pine Chip set a track record by speeding around the Red Mile track in 1:523/5 .
Oaklea Jay finished second and High Noon Star third.
TENNIS  Yzaga Upsets Courier  Jaime Yzaga, the 54th-ranked player from Peru, ripped forehands past top-seeded Jim Courier last night for a 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 quarterfinal upset at the Australian Indoor championships in Sydney.

Jeff Maggert, regarded as one of the best players who has yet to win a PGA Tour event, is after a breakthrough this weekend in the Walt Disney World-Oldsmobile Golf Classic in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
He shot a seven-under-par 65 on Disney's Magnolia course to share the lead with Skip Kendall before yesterday's second round was suspended because of rain.
Half the field of 132 still must complete the round in the tournament being played on three courses.
Maggert and Kendall, who shot 66, were atop the leader board with two-day totals of 13-under-par 131.

So far, so good, but the ban should be permanent, and adopted more broadly, by lawyers, accountants and small investment firms whose business is largely local.

Sluggish Jobs Data Last Month
The labor market improved only modestly in September as payroll jobs expanded by 156,000 and the unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent, its two-year low, the Labor Department reported today.
Although the basic figures closely matched consensus expectations, some of the secondary numbers reflected more weakness than had been expected.
Among the weaker of these was an 18-minute cut in the length of the private-sector workweek, a seventh straight decline in the number of jobs in factories and a sharp increase in the length of jobless spells.

Vietnam Does Some Networking
A few feet from trays of crab cakes and fried shrimp and white wine, dozens of senior executives from the anchors of American industry were obediently lined up in a Plaza Hotel ballroom.
They were from companies like Pfizer, Mobil and Avon, and they were waiting to shake the hand of -- and, they hoped, to have a few words with -- the First Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam.
It was not a royal dinner, but sometimes it seemed on Thursday night as if the American executives were treating the Vietnamese official, Phan Van Khai, like a prince.
They flattered him.
They toasted him.
They gave him several standing ovations.
They left little doubt that they were eager -- maybe too eager in the minds of demonstrators nearby -- to do business with a former enemy.

Weighing a Teacher's Rights
It's easy to understand why parents would be upset to have Peter Melzer teaching their children.
Mr.
Melzer, a physics teacher at the Bronx High School of Science, is also a leader of the North American Man-Boy Love Association.
Issues of the group's newsletter, with Mr.
Melzer's name on the masthead as officer or editor, have included how-to articles on seducing young boys.
It sounds like any parent's nightmare: a teacher with easy access to youths who openly espouses sex with youths.
But there is a big problem with current efforts to remove Mr.
Melzer.
There is no evidence whatever that he poses any danger, sexual or otherwise, to his students.
The case against him rests entirely on views expressed in writing, mostly by others, and on what he may or may not have done years ago in a foreign country.
Thus moves by the New York City Board of Education to dismiss him for these articles raise troubling issues of free speech and civil rights.

At Spain VW Plant, Decision Time
Near Barcelona, in a union office with cracked tile floors and used metallic office furniture, a dozen middle-aged auto workers from Spain's SEAT assembly plant milled about, arguing over who will be to blame if their jobs are lost.
Volkswagen A.G., SEAT's parent, clearly wants some drastic steps taken.
It says that SEAT is rolling up a staggering $769 million loss this year.
Volkswagen had to hurriedly inject $911 million into the subsidiary last month.
And SEAT's chairman left last week as VW signaled that it might close the plant, which has churned out cars for 40 years.

Endorsement By Teachers Is Unlikely
In a repudiation of Mayor David N. Dinkins, the United Federation of Teachers, one of the largest and most powerful unions in the city, is unlikely to make any endorsement for mayor, union officials said yesterday.
Sandra Feldman, the union president, said that the union's membership was divided and that its leadership had doubts about both Mr.
Dinkins and his Republican-Liberal opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The union's 3,000-member delegate assembly is to take up the issue on Wednesday.

METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY
Already facing chronic money problems, New York City's hospitals said yesterday that they would lose about $4 billion in Government revenue in the first five years of President Clinton's proposed national health plan.
In perhaps the first detailed look at how the Clinton proposal could affect local health care providers, the Greater New York Hospital Association said that cuts in Medicare and Medicaid would far outweigh increases in aid for people who now lack health insurance.

Bridge
Nine years ago Bob and Jill Blanchard of Manhattan began a legal action that eventually induced the American Contract Bridge League to abandon the scheduling of Men's Pairs and Men's Teams.
These traditional events made it impossible for a married couple, or any mixed partnership, to compete, since the parallel events were for Women's Pairs and Teams.
The Blanchard marriage has since dissolved, but their efforts have had a permanent effect: There are no longer any men's events on the calendar at national, regional or sectional level.
The regional team event played Thursday in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y., would once have been restricted to men.
As it was open, it was possible for Sande Boas of Manhattan to win her first regional title, backed by Glenn Milgrim and Jared Lilienstein, both of Manhattan, and Lapt Chan of Woodside, Queens.

CHRONICLE
SERENA STANHOPE may have given the British royal family a bit of a scare on Thursday when she failed to appear for the rehearsal of her wedding to VISCOUNT LINLEY, Princess Margaret's son and the Queen's nephew.
But for the main event -- the wedding yesterday afternoon at St.
Margaret's Church, in Westminster Abbey -- the bride, 23, was right on time, The Press Association, the British news agency, reported.
Attended by four bridesmaids, three pages and 14 ushers, the couple were married in a 40-minute ceremony conducted by the Very Rev.
Michael Mayne, the Dean of Westminster, and Canon Donald Grey, the rector of St.
Margaret's.
As they emerged from the church following what Mr.
Mayne described as "a lovely family service," bells pealed and a crowd of 5,000 cheered the viscont and his bride, the daughter of Viscount Petersham.
A 1911 Rolls-Royce took the couple to the reception at St.
James's Palace.

Egypt Is Said to Jail a Critic of the President
A leading opposition politician was being held by the Egyptian police on charges of humiliating President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in a newspaper article, human rights officials here said today.
It was the first time a prominent politician had been held overnight since opposition parties were allowed to operate in relative freedom over a decade ago.
Helmy Murad, vice president of the Socialist Labor Party and a former Minister of Education, was arrested on Thursday along with two journalists after publishing an article in the party newspaper, Al Shaab, on Tuesday urging Mr.
Mubarak to provide information on an unspecified arms deal, human rights official said.


Review/Television; NBC and ABC Take On CBS and Lansbury
How do you loosen Angela Lansbury's hammerlock on the Sundays-at-8 time slot she has long monopolized with "Murder, She Wrote" on CBS?
NBC, committed to 22 episodes of Steven Spielberg's "Seaquest DSV," is betting that a talking dolphin can do the trick.
ABC, giving Superman still another whirl in "Lois and Clark," is going with a hunk in a red cape.
Freighted with elaborate sets and special effects, the new productions are expensive and ambitious.
They obviously relish the possibility of toppling Ms.
Lansbury's sweet old Jessica Fletcher.
Seaquest DSV (it means deep submergence vehicle) is a futuristic submarine patrolling and exploring the world's waters in 2018.
A consultant to the series, Dr.
Robert Ballard, the oceanographer who found the sunken Titanic, insists that this is not science fiction, but that the show is predicting the future.
The pragmatic Mr.
Spielberg, still looking for a television hit after the disappointments of "Amazing Stories" and "Family Dog," is more flexible.
He says the project is part science, part fiction and "it's part complete and pure fantasy."


U.N. Economic Curbs On Pretoria Are Lifted
The General Assembly voted today to lift its call for economic sanctions against South Africa and urged all countries to end any remaining restrictions.

The sanctions have also led many American states and cities, including New York, to penalize South Africa for its racial policy of apartheid.

Molissa Fenley presented two vibrant premieres on Thursday night in a program that opened a two-week season at the Kitchen (512 West 19th Street, west of 10th Avenue, Chelsea).
"Tilliboyo-Escalay" and "Witches' Float" have a welcome new dramatic edge that tempers the extreme meditative tone of Ms.
Fenley's recent repertory.
The first work reverts to her earlier high dynamics, whereas "Witches' Float" has an intense ritualism as the choreographer, her face and bare chest in red body paint, engages in a silent dialogue with four inanimate figures, all female nudes by the sculptor Kiki Smith.
Typically, Ms.
Fenley's choice of music explores the international new-music scene from America to Africa.

Toward the end of his second set at the Village Vanguard on Thursday night, the young tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman started quoting Sonny Rollins.
Unaccompanied, he threw in bits of Mr.

Then he and his band went full tilt into the number, with Mr.
Redman using a repeated figure of Mr.
Rollins's as a motif.
It was part bravura showmanship, part homage and part esthetic exercise, all done simply because it could be done, the type of performance most young virtuosos can't seem to avoid.

As President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, set about selling their health care plan, they have added a glowing new verse to Garrison Keillor's paean to Lake Wobegon, presenting this state as a model of the humane, organized and cost-effective medicine to which the nation should aspire.


Nixon Moves From Bit Part to Leading Man
For two games, the National League Championship Series has provided the expected, such as strong starting pitching by Atlanta, and the unexpected, such as the first loss at home this season by Philadelphia's Tommy Greene.
But it has produced only one major surprise, and it comes right at the top of the order.
The series, which moves to Atlanta for Game 3 this afternoon, was supposed to exhibit the National League version of the leadoff hitter's clinic.
It has done that, but contrary to expectations, the clinic is being taught by the Braves' Otis Nixon, not by Philadelphia's Lenny Dykstra, whose numbers this season had people calling him the most potent leadoff hitter since Rickey Henderson in the 1980's.


Pentagon Lifts Restrictions On Gay Troops Temporarily

Gay rights leaders are hailing the action.
But they are also urging gay service members to use caution in disclosing their homosexuality, advising that any action they take now might be used against them later if the injunction is lifted by a higher court.

He didn't say anything about today.
This was the day the reality of Jordan's retirement announcement on Wednesday finally hit home.
The Bulls opened their training camp this morning, and while basketball's Elvis happened to be in the building, he was not in uniform.
Everyone pretty much agreed with Coach Phil Jackson, who said: "I know the potential for him coming back next season is out there, but that's a whole year away. I'm sure he won't be playing this season, and that's what we're playing for."

After Deluge, Farmers Go Shopping
Many fields along Midwestern rivers lie ruined from the summer's flooding, and most crops throughout the region were planted so late that there is more danger than usual that frost will interfere with the harvest.
But when more than 100,000 farmers gathered last week in Amana, Iowa, for the 41st annual Farm Progress Show, the mood was oddly buoyant.
"I've been surprised at what a good mood the farmers are in," said Kenny Wagahoff, surveying the crowds from the tent that his company, Top Air Manufacturing of Parkersburg, Iowa, had set up at Amana Farms Inc. to show off its spraying equipment.
"It's like they've figured they may as well look ahead to next year."

Mayoral Race Makes Park a Field for Politics
When politics clashed with the New York City Parks Commissioner yesterday the result was part Kabuki theater, part Fellini movie and pure psychological warfare.
A New York Newsday article yesterday challenged the Dinkins administration with running campaign advertisements that misrepresented its "Fields of Dreams" program as having turned 40 vacant lots into clean and safe ballfields.
Instead, the newspaper described 12 of the fields as unplayable and ran a photograph of one that is being used as a parking lot.

A Pioneer Of Realism
Consuelo Kanaga (1894-1978) was one of America's most important photographers.

Born in Astoria, Ore., Kanaga was hired in 1915 as a reporter at The San Francisco Chronicle but quickly became more interested in the work of the paper's photographers.
She took a job in the darkroom and was eventually named a staff photographer.

Dollar Falls Against Mark But Rises in Yen Trading
The dollar fell sharply against the German mark and several other leading currencies yesterday after the September employment report failed to convince investors that the economy is growing fast enough to push up interest rates.
But it rose against the Japanese yen after a Treasury official said the dollar should not be allowed to fall too far in an effort to increase American exports.

U.N. Says Iraq Takes First Steps to Comply on Arms Controls
In what appears to be steady movement toward meeting United Nations conditions for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iraq turned over documents today listing former arms suppliers in Baghdad and said Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz would travel to the United Nations in November for further talks.
"There was considerable progress in the technical areas," said Rolf Ekeus, the chairman of the United Nations special commission implementing the Gulf War cease-fire terms.
"Iraq provided us with a large amount of new data on past production of prohibited weapons or items."


Borough Tourist's Guide To the Border Crossing
IN a city whose parts are mostly separated by water, the Brooklyn-Queens line is singular as the only major land boundary dividing boroughs, stretching for 12 undefended miles from the East River to Jamaica Bay.
And as Staten Island, the most insular of the city's parts, contemplates secession -- thereby contesting the frosty notion that good moats make good neighbors -- it seemed both timely and intriguing to wander the Brooklyn-Queens frontier looking for signs of border tensions or interborough amity.

Report on Assault on Waco Cult Contradicts Reno's Explanations
The Justice Department provided new information today that contradicted Attorney General Janet Reno's explanation of why she ordered the tear gas assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., in April.
The assault ended in a fire that killed at least 75 cult members, many of them children.
The new details on the assault were disclosed in a portion of a three-part report prepared by the Justice Department on its handling of the 51-day standoff between cult members and Federal agents.


THE SOMALIA MISSION: Overview; U.S. MIXES SIGNALS TO SOMALI GENERAL ON ITS NEXT STEPS
President Clinton and his senior advisers took two tracks on Somalia today, leaving the door open for a negotiated political solution that could include the factional leader Mohammed Farah Aidid, but also issuing tough military warnings intended to protect American forces until reinforcements arrive.
Clinton Administration officials said they were prepared to mount an armed rescue of an imprisoned American helicopter pilot and would not rule out attacking General Aidid.

U.N. Could Pay Its Way by Selling World Rights; Membership for Taiwan
To the Editor:
Since 1971, the people on Taiwan have been denied representation in the United Nations and other international bodies.
Taiwan's isolation was reaffirmed this year when a proposal by seven Central American countries to study Taiwan membership in the United Nations was not placed on the agenda.
For a country like Taiwan with a population larger than two-thirds of the world's nations, vast economic resources, a rich cultural heritage and a long history of democratic struggle, such a denial is an abuse of human rights and contrary to the principle of universality embraced by the United Nations.


Review/Film Festival; Infiltrating the Land of Sugar Plums
Tim Burton is already well known as a master of macabre ingenuity, but "Tim Burton's the Nightmare Before Christmas" presents him in a new light.
This delectably ghoulish fairy tale, conceived by Mr.
Burton as a full-length film made in stop-motion animation (think of the California Raisins on a dark and stormy night), has a clever visual format that keeps it streamlined and sharp.
As directed painstakingly by Henry Selick, a stop-motion veteran who worked from Mr.
Burton's blueprint, this buoyant film blends the most likable aspects of "Edward Scissorhands," "Beetlejuice" and "Batman," and sends them off to Toyland.
It also stamps the unmistakable Burton sensibility onto every frame.
"Tim Burton's the Nightmare Before Christmas" is fun for the whole Addams family, as well as for anyone else inclined to appreciate the spectacle of Santa Claus being kidnapped and harassed.
It is Mr.
Burton's peculiar gift to find benign mischief in that kind of spectacle, just as Danny Elfman, who wrote the many serviceable songs that turn this into a full-fledged movie musical, is capable of writing gleefully in a minor key.


Review/Opera; A Little Devil Who Was Too Good
One of the surprises of the New York City Opera's World Premiere Festival this week was that a minor work, commissioned by NBC for television in 1955, turned out to be an unduly neglected and charming theater piece.
Lukas Foss meant "Griffelkin," an opera about a 10-year-old devil who can't quite succeed in hell, to appeal to both children and adults, and I think it will.
If the revised version of the score, which had its premiere on Thursday night, were pruned, particularly in the second act, it could become a minor classic.
"Griffelkin" avoids almost all the pitfalls of adult works about, and partly for, children: it swerves into sentimentality without becoming mawkish; it celebrates innocence without being banal, and it never condescends to its characters or its subject.
Mr.
Foss's score, which includes a fair number of academic niceties (including a canon and lighthearted allusions to Mozart), is instantly accessible, managing to recall Stravinsky, Copland and hints of the young Leonard Bernstein, while still sounding original.
It has its longueurs and times of forced gaiety and tumult, particularly in the last half of the second act (the first act could easily be combined with the second), but the third act is strikingly sure-footed.
Overall, Mr.
Foss's wry music is a fine foil for Alastair Reid's literate, often rhyming libretto.

Stieglitz Photograph Brings Record Price
A 1920 photograph by Alfred Stieglitz of the hands of his wife, the artist Georgia O'Keeffe, was sold at Christie's in New York yesterday for $398,500, making it the highest price ever paid at auction for a photograph.
The previous auction record for a photograph was $193,895 for Man Ray's "Glass Tears," which sold at Sotheby's in London in May.
"This print is as important as anything you could imagine in 20th-century art," said Rick Webster, head of Christie's photograph department, who added that the buyer wished to remain anonymous.


Agency Says Motorman's Error May Have Caused Accident
The Brooklyn subway crash on Thursday was caused by a train operator who intentionally ran a red light and who then probably tried to cover it up, Transit Authority officials said yesterday.
The crash, which officials said was the first involving two passenger trains since July 1981, pointed to a systemwide problem in insuring rider safety: the near total reliance on operators to follow the rules.
Forty-two passengers were sent to hospitals and three remained hospitalized, all in stable condition.

Squabbling Sox Find a Unifying Force in Alvarez
The Chicago White Sox, feudin' and fussin' like some of their American League playoff predecessors, stopped jabbering long enough tonight and gained their first victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.
In the process, they made league history.
With Wilson Alvarez dominating the Blue Jays, allowing only one hit and two base runners in the final five innings, the White Sox won, 6-1, and became the first A.L. team to lose the first two games of the four-of-seven-game pennant playoff at home, then win a game before the series ended.
Four previous times a visiting team won the first two games, and each time that team went on to sweep the series.


The Hunt for Good Value
Defining good value has a lot to do with figuring out where to find it.
And the answer to that is: You can find it anywhere - with a good pair of eyes.
To make the point, we asked two interior designers and an architect to shop the chain stores we all use - retailers with no "to the trade only" signs on their doors - then to furnish rooms typical of thos we inhabit.
Through the eyes of these designers, you'll see that it's not where you shop but what you pick that counts.
Ultimately, good value depends on well-considered choices and the confidence to make thos choices personal.

The Light Blue Is Turned Black and Blue by Lafayette
The day Coach Ray Tellier can get his team to play well on both sides of the ball is the day Columbia (1-3) may win another game.
It didn't happen yesterday, as Lafayette rolled over the Lions, 58-6, at Wien Stadium.
At first, this didn't look like the same Columbia defense that allowed Colgate's awesome three-touchdown comeback in the last five minutes last week.
This week, the Lion defense set up several opportunities for the offense to score against Lafayette early.
And this Lion defense actually held Lafayette (3-2, 1-0 Patriot League) a few times near the goal line, otherwise the Leopards would have had even more points.

Merchants Say a Change in Bus Routes Hurts
Merchants in downtown Jamaica are once again fighting to preserve what they regard as the key to their economic well-being, the very thing they say insures the return of their customers each day: bus routes.

At a subsequent interview with President Clinton, I used it to form the basis for a penetrating question. (Actually, my question was a not overly harsh "Can you give me a little more on that?" but even so, it penetrated.)

In the Region/Connecticut; Making Gold-Coast Affordable Housing a Reality
DECADE after decade, Fairfield County's wealthier towns have talked about affordable housing, but as a subject for action it has been as intractable as the weather.
Barely noting state guidelines suggesting that a minimum of 10 percent of housing be in the "affordable" category -- which means $100,000 for a family of four in Fairfield County earning $40,000 a year -- most communities remain at about 2 percent.
Only the larger cities of Bridgeport and Stamford exceed the minimum.
Nevertheless, 126 units of new or renovated affordable housing have been produced around the county by the Fairfield 2000 Homes Corporation, a group of volunteer movers and shakers founded in 1987.


A New F.D.R. Ramp for 48th Street
After several years of appeals from neighborhood residents, city officials have announced plans to build a new entrance ramp to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive at East 48th Street, reversing an earlier decision.
The old ramp, 600 feet long, was closed in 1987 during construction on the drive and never reopened.
Reasons given were structural deterioration and safety concerns. (The ramp forced vehicles into the fast left lane on the F.D.R., an arrangement that would violate new Federal regulations.)


The Case for the Defense
To the Editor:
Reforms in the legal profession are constantly under way and many have already been in place for a decade or more.
For example, our medical malpractice laws in New York were changed in 1985.
As far as consumers are concerned, they were not changed for the better.
Now meritorious cases against incompetent physicians are rejected because lawyers and clients cannot afford the expenses involved in litigating these matters.
Naturally, doctors and their insurance companies are pleased because court filings have gone way down.
Insurance companies have not, however, reduced their rates or their profits.
Lawyers suffered substantial losses of income and consumers are left with injuries and no remedies.

A Checklist for a Sagging City
Last Sunday, more than 200 residents of the Upper West Side, armed with clipboards, walked up and down the neighborhood's streets and avenues, looking for cracked pavement, peeling paint, unsafe wires, dying trees and other detritus of a decaying city.

The pots, he added, were white plastic construction-material pails -- of the type found at any building site around town.

The Yangtze's Gorges
IT is at dawn that the murky waters of the Yangtze River are most mysterious.
As little cargo boats emerge from the mist like apparitions, it seems entirely possible that the Three Gorges here in central China were formed not by geological forces but by the goddess Yao Ji and the 12 dragons.
The 12 dragons, as local folk can tell you, used to bully and oppress the peasants along the Yangtze.
Then Yao Ji showed up on the top of a nearby cloud and pointed her finger at the dragons, killing them.
Unfortunately, the goddess hadn't thought the problem through.
The bodies of the dragons left 12 huge mountains that blocked the river and turned the region into a huge sea.

Patrol the Pathway, Don't Reroute It
When Westchester County  [ "Safety vs. Esthetics on Bronx River," Aug. 8 ]  states that it plans to elevate and reroute more than a mile of the paved Bronx River Pathway because of two sexual assaults that occurred in the park in the last two years, they've got to be kidding.
Do county officials believe the problem will be solved by making the entire length of the path from Harney Road southward visible to drivers on the Bronx River Parkway?
Are they suggesting that the safety of women will be determined by these drivers?
How ridiculous!
A driver is supposed to be watching the road, not the path for possible rapes. (Does the county want to be responsible for more car accidents?)

And as might be expected, Rattner vetoes Government policy that would actually create jobs, whether through public works or "industrial policy."

Such persistence is testimony to the peculiar hubris that convinces us there are others out there, enough like ourselves that we can hope to understand them, and vice versa.

Move Over, Blazer
Fall fashion's first big winner is the chenille sweater, as soft as a horse's nose, in jewel-tone colors.
Many women are wearing them for day, evening and weekends.
The popularity of the sweater is due not only to its tactile quality but also to its availability in a wide range of prices.
Chenille sweaters are loose, oversize and worn outside trousers, skirts and leggings.
For many women, they are replacing the fall blazer.


Annette Mathieu and William Bialosky
FRIENDS describe Annette Mathieu, 31, and William Bialosky, 34, as opposites with one thing in common -- a great sense of humor.
He is an architect who plays the bassoon and spends several weeks each year canoeing in remote areas of the Adirondacks, Maine and Canada.


Oct. 3-9: Victims Don't Forget; A Vietnam-Era Fugitive Goes to Prison
A generation ago, as a young radical, Katherine Ann Power took part in a bank robbery that led to the murder of a Boston police officer, Walter Schroeder.
Last week, having emerged from an adulthood in hiding, she was sentenced -- to 8 to 12 years in prison for armed robbery and manslaughter, with a chance for release in a little over five years.
Ms. Power apologized to the court for playing a part in taking a human life.


On Sunday; As Pizza Maker Knows, Sinatra Still Delivers
THERE is a generation whose Elvis never died.
"Shooby-dooby-doo," some of its odder members still mumble lyrically at times, a tribute to the closing wisp of Frank Sinatra's "Strangers in the Night." The more imaginative rent the video of "The Pope of Greenwich Village" solely to watch the opening credits and hear "Summer Wind" sung so cleanly by Sinatra as the actor Mickey Rourke dolls himself up in quintessential New York double-breasted sharpness, French cuffs and all, a perfect visual for Sinatra's articulation.
Of such is the life of Patsy Grimaldi and all the other Sinatra fanatics tucked about New York's less-pretentious corners.
"When Frank checks into the Waldorf he orders two large sausage pies to go, and for him I deliver," Patsy says, breaking his no-delivery policy at Patsy's Coal-Oven Pizzeria under the Brooklyn Bridge's eastern arch.
"He sent a jet from the West Coast to pick up 50 pies."

What is Good Value?
The quest for value is on - in politics, in family life, in design.
But what does it mean?
When it come to furnishing a home, "getting good value" often has a bargain-basement ring.
However, there's a deeper meaning that calls for a new way of making choices.
The best designers know that good value can turn up in unlikely places.
They exercise selectivity, whether they are shopping at auction houses or chain stores.
Then, there is the long-term satisfaction of solid workmanship.
Good value, in short, doesn't hamg on a price tag.
It is a way of looking at your wold and putting together a home with a sense of purpose.
Increasingly, it is based on an attitude toward preservation that looks as much to the future as to the past.
Finally, good value celebrates personal taste and the confidence to live by your own standards.
Where to begin?
At home, naturally


To Prevent Violence In Domestic Disputes
"Domestic Violence Victims Find Understanding"  [ Aug. 29 ]  was an accurate and thorough overview of arrest policies in Suffolk County.
Strong arrest policies, especially policies that mandate arrest for violations of orders of protection, are effective deterrents for spousal violence.
The Suffolk County Police Department and dozens of town and village police departments throughout the county are to be commended for the seriousness with which they respond to violence in the home.

Commercial Property:/Upper Broadway; The Glitter of the Other Broadway
FOR years they've flocked to Zabar's for their lox, to H &amp; H for their bagels, to Fairway for their fruits and vegetables.
They are a motley lot, with well-coiffed women in minks jostling ponytailed men in cutoffs for counter space; some have their bags of goodies loaded into limousines, others tie them to bicycle racks, still others hail cabs -- and many, many more just walk home.
These are the Broadway shoppers, people from all careers, all classes, all races, who hate to waste money but are willing to spend whatever it takes for quality.
They have been around for decades.
And now a new wave of retailers, including some national chains, are recognizing them as one of the most potentially lucrative customer groups around.


Corrections
Because of a computer entry error, a letter to the editor on Sept. 12 about a James Mason film retrospective misattributed the television film "Homage to Chagall -- The Colors of Love." It was produced by the CBC (the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), not by CBS.


In America; The Right Thing
President Clinton is swimming in treacherous political waters with his latest Somalia policy.
Another combat disaster in Mogadishu -- the loss of a large number of Americans, the taking of additional hostages -- would present an enormous threat to his Presidency.
The conciliatory moves yesterday by the factional leader Mohammed Farah Aidid give the President some space in which to breathe, but not much.
In Somalia, there are no guarantees.


Kmart's Stock Surge Masks a Weakness at the Core; Still Searching for Ways to Stop A Painful Slide in Market Share
AS a way of sidestepping head-on competition with Wal-Mart, Kmart has worked hard to increase apparel sales.
In recent years, the retailer began emphasizing the fashion side of the clothing it sells, which clearly differentiates it from Wal-Mart.
Still, Kmart's apparel sales have at best equaled last year's, according to Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associates Inc., a retail consulting firm in New York, although they began to perk up last month.


Dana Heller, Donald Whamond 3d
Dana Florence Heller, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Peter E. Heller of Purchase, N.Y., was married yesterday to Donald Sinclair Whamond 3d, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Whamond Jr. of Rye, N.Y.
The Rev.
James Walsh, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at the Church of the Resurrection in Rye.
Mrs.
Whamond, 25, is a freelance photographer in New York.
She graduated from Syracuse University.
Her father is the president of Accuscan Inc., a licensing company for scanning and facsimile technology in Purchase.


Is It the Year of the Woman, or of Making Amends?
IN A NEW YORKER CARTOON SOME years ago, a woman in bearskins painting bison on a cave wall wondered idly to another bearskinned woman why there hadn't been any important male artists.
The joke works for artists but not photographers, for everyone acknowledges that women photographers have been important all along.
Well.
When Beaumont Newhall revised his classic "History of Photography" in 1982, he increased the number of women mentioned to 13; the first page of his eight-page index lists 38 men.
It must be hastily admitted that photography was invented by men and dominated by them well beyond the time that the medium required chemistry and the female sex required smelling salts.
Institutions have not done all that much better than Newhall.
Susan Kismaric, curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, told a panel last year that at the end of 1990 the Modern owned work by 1,226 photographers, of whom 172 (14 percent) were women.
The exhibition record was slightly more respectable: of 70 one-person shows organized by the museum, 20 (or 29 percent) were of women's work.
Yet consider that at this moment women are perhaps more prominent in the field of photography than men -- few men with cameras can claim the audience, press attention, even, at times, the prices of Cindy Sherman, Annie Leibovitz or Sally Mann.


Joan Campo, Christopher Carter
Joan Whalen Campo and Christopher V. R. Carter, advertising sales representatives at Time magazine in New York, were married yesterday in Hyannis Port, Mass.
The Rev.
David Carter, an Episcopal minister and a brother of the bridegroom, performed the ceremony at St.
Andrew's-by-the-Sea Church.
Mrs.
Carter, 33, graduated from Trinity College in Hartford.
She is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
J.
William Campo of Greenwich, Conn.
Her father is the managing director, in Greenwich, for the Hobbs Group, an international insurance company.


Showtime for Seniors
Pat Sheinwold went to see "Lost in Yonkers" at one of New York City's larger movie houses one afternoon last spring.
Age 59, she paid full freight, but she noticed that several over-65's in line ahead of her were turned away because it was 10 minutes past the 5 P.M. cutoff for the senior citizen discount.
Inside, she found the theater almost empty.
Ridiculous, she thought, and fired off a letter to the Cineplex Odeon people in Toronto.
Ms.
Sheinwold discovered that there was no cutoff at their theaters in Los Angeles and Chicago, so why limit New Yorkers to early shows and only on weekdays?


Ethan Allen
"I always thought of Ethan Allen as the place to go for stately Colonial furniture," says the interior designer Victoria Hagan.
"I was surprised to find so many contemporary peices and accessories, too." The chain's wide selection allowed the designer to indulge in her favorite kind of shoping spree.
"Ethan Allen displays their merchandise in complete collections and room vignettes," she says.
"The fun is in taking some pieces from one set and some from another. Mixing helps create a more timeless interior." The room she decorated - a sunny bedroom in a prewar town house - is light and airy.
White walls and furniture, she figured, would allow for a variety of accessories.
Pieces with sculptural shilhouettes, such as the metal-framed bed, and interesting details, such as the nail heads on the sofa arms, were high on her list.
And for a twist, there's a pie rack usually sold as a Colonial memento that Hagan found ideal for books and magazines.
"One-stop shopping can be terrific," she concludes, "as long as you remember that it's the personalized details that make a room come alive." The following items are available at Ethan Allen Home Interiors stores nationwide.

Name That Colt
PICKING A WINNING horse, as every bettor knows, is not easy.
But picking a winning horse name may be even harder.
When Sky Beauty emerged as the queen of the 3-year-olds this year, it was a victory not only for her owners, but also for the genteel tradition of names like Man o' War, Count Fleet, Whirlaway and Native Dancer that, like most genteel traditions, is struggling a bit.
The horses circling the track these days have names like No Fat Chicks, Liver Stand, Janitress or Far Out Beast.
When the great Genuine Risk, one of only three fillies to win the Kentucky Derby, gave birth to a foal in May, after 11 straight years of miscarriages and other problems, racing fans around the world cheered.
It was a boy.
Suggestions on what to name the new arrival came pouring into Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, Ky., where the colt was born.
Predictable names, like Worth the Risk, Genuine Miracle or Risky Business.
Well-intentioned but strange names, like Genuine Impact, inspired by the operation that the foal underwent to remove an impaction of the colon.
Inscrutable names, like Calculator and Brown Bread.
More than 300 names, all told -- and most of them unusable under the strict rules that govern the naming of thoroughbreds.


Broadway Flops Go to CD Heaven
IT SEEMS ALMOST EMBARRASSING NOW THAT ON A crisp early winter night in 1964 I had nothing better to do in my young life than walk up to the box office of the Shubert Theater and buy a ticket for "Bajour."
"Bajour": The title doesn't exactly roar down memory lane 30 years later, does it?
In truth, even at the time, it was the kind of carefree Broadway musical designed to be forgotten during intermission.
When Act II began, you counted on the characters to remind you of just what they were doing when the curtain fell 15 minutes earlier.
The show was so artificial, so hermetically sealed in the creakiest conventions of musical comedy, that its every line abhorred any cohesive connections to human experience as practiced beyond Shubert Alley.

Mutual Funds; A Matter of Style: Value or Growth?
WHAT'S in a mutual fund's name?
Usually not enough to tell an investor how the manager is picking the portfolio's stocks.
Most investors can learn from a fund's name that it owns stocks of smaller companies, or invests globally, or combines stocks and bonds in one portfolio.
But, with some exceptions, fund names fail to convey which of two basic approaches to stock-picking its manager uses: value or growth.

UPPER WEST SIDE  An Open Pool Tournament, But Amateurs Beware
The Amsterdam Billiard Club will hold its second annual open pool tournament on Monday, and the competitors will include the likes of Grady (the Professor) Matthews and Ewa Mataya.
If those names don't ring a bell, chances are this tournament is not for you -- except, maybe, as an observer.
Last year, 200 spectators attended the contest, which has a prize pool of $10,000.
"If you don't make a living playing pool, you shouldn't be in this event," said Lane Campbell, an instructor at the club.
"This is not just a bunch of good New York players. These are world champs."
The Amsterdam Billiard Club, 344 Amsterdam Avenue; Oct. 11, noon to midnight; entrance fee, $100; spectators, $25 in advance, $35 at the door; (212) 496-8180.
TIMES SQUARE  For Proud Dog-Owners Who Carry Pictures
The owners of poodles and Weimaraners, not their pets, will face off Wednesday when the Dog Fanciers Club of New York holds its third annual "Photos of Fidos" contest at Sardi's Restaurant.
Contestants will enter 8-by-10's of their beloved pups; the shots will be judged by a panel of photography professionals.
The 30-year-old club, which meets monthly for luncheons and dog-related activities, will award two $100 prizes, one for black-and-white photos, one for color.
Linda Harman, the owner of Animals for Advertising, a dog talent agency, will advise owners on how to get their dogs into show business.
Do not expect a lot of covetous sniping between the owners of Loopsie and Muffin.
"That only happens at dog shows," said the club's president, Howard Atlee.
Sardi's Restaurant, 243 West 44th Street; Oct. 13, 11:30 A.M.; $50 for contestants, including lunch; $40, lunch and viewing; $10, viewing only, until 12:30 P.M.; (201) 837-1253.

A Fortune For a Nickel
ONE of America's dream coins is going to auction this week.
A 1913 Liberty Head nickel, one of only four known still to exist, will be sold Wednesday at Stack's.
The 1913 Liberty Head nickels should never have been minted.
Charles E. Barber's Liberty Head design had been used since 1883 and was replaced in 1913 by James Earle Fraser's design with the head of an American Indian on the obverse and a bison on the reverse, a design that lasted until 1938.
But beginning in early December 1912, the United States Mint had orders to wait until the new designs were approved before making more coins.
The Buffalo nickels started rolling off the presses on Feb. 17, 1913.
For almost seven years, collectors and Mint officials thought the transition had gone well.


The Cost Challenge for Child Care
FAMILIES who employ child care workers in their homes will be required to pay for the workers' health care under the Clinton Administration's proposal.
This will be true both for caretakers who have no coverage now and for those who are covered by a spouse's plan.


In a Moment of Harmony, Candidates Attend Dinner
Following a week of intensifying political rancor in the city's mayoral campaign, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani, his Republican-Liberal challenger, put aside their partisan passions for just a brief, rare moment last night and spoke on their shared dreams for ethnic harmony as the they shared the head table at a dinner celebrating achievements of Italian-Americans.
The two candidates, who have made stinging accusations about each other while campaigning through a second election, greeted each other with a handshake and warm, if awkward, smiles in a reception room at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
Both then spoke to 600 people at the annual black-tie dinner of the Columbus Citizens Foundation, which sponsors the Columbus Day Parade tomorrow.


Hurdle to Peace: Parting the Mideast's Waters
Beyond all the hopeful talk of peace in the Middle East, a battle is shaping over an issue as powerful as land, as basic as oil: the region is running out of water, and no one, Israeli or Arab, is prepared to do with less so others can have more.
In a region where barren deserts and cloudless skies make water life's most precious commodity, the dispute may prove even more complicated than the brave new steps promised by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.

Strings And Piano Together
FANCIERS of stringed instruments and the piano should be happy with the choices offered this week.
One violin-piano partnership, consisting of the Westchester residents Peggy Klinger and Theora Cultice, will play Bach, Brahms, Messiaen and Kreisler on Wednesday at 12:35 P.M. at Grace Episcopal Church in White Plains.

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
How to Arrive in Roslyn
"WELCOME to Roslyn," the first English settlers were told.
"Watch where you step." To celebrate the 350th anniversary of the landing of English settlers on Gold Coast shores a small part of the coast of Roslyn Village was set aside for a landing re-enactment.
But a four-legged creature had obviously landed there first.
So "watch where you step" took on added meaning as the settlers took their first steps on Long Island.


Departures and Arrivals
In downtown Jamaica, as stores like Mod Fashion, Revels Men's Wear and the Everything Store closed over the summer, others, mainly clothes shops, discount stores and fast-food store arrived to fill the vaccant space, sometimes overnight.

Fate-of-the-Earth Furniture
THESE DAYS, MORE AND MORE of us are thinking green.
We bring string bags to the supermarket and buy biodegradable detergents, organic vegetables, even recyclable teakettles.
Yet how many of us think of the fate of the earth when selecting a new sofa or table?
It's difficult to imagine them as a threat to the environment, much less to one's health.
But the truth is that furniture manufacturing is a fundamentally polluting business: Companies often use pesticide-treated wood and apply paints and finishes that contain volatile toxic solvents, as well as glues made with formaldehyde, a likely carcinogen.
Not to mention the millions of acres of rain forest that are destroyed in the demand for tropical woods such as mahogany and rosewood.
Troubled by this environmental toll, a growing number of designers, manufacturers and marketers have embarked on an ecological odyssey in search of cleaner and safer materials and renewable wood sources.


City Hall Rivals Stress Abortion In Battle for the Votes of Women
A television commercial for Mayor David N. Dinkins hammers away at Rudolph W. Giuliani's reservations about abortion in 1989.
A radio spot by the state Democratic Party reminds listeners that Mr.
Giuliani served in the Republican administrations that blocked doctors from providing abortion counseling in clinics that received Federal money.
In rebuttal, Mr.
Giuliani has put his wife, Donna Hanover Giuliani, on the air, with the former television news anchor promoting her husband's record on women's issues and wrapping up with, "And make no mistake about it, Rudy Giuliani is pro-choice."


Brassy 'City of Angels' In Village of Elmsford
"CITY OF ANGELS" at the Westchester Broadway Theater is a tricky musical about how a writer (Stine) labors to make a screenplay of his novel ("City of Angels"), which is about the misadventures of a 1940's-type hard-boiled private eye (Stone).
Stine transfers his real dilemmas into Stone's cinematic perils, which, in turn, affect Stine's life.
Alternately a sendup of film noir and a tirade against the corruption of creativity by Hollywood, the Cy Coleman (music), David Zippel (lyrics), Larry Gelbart (book) collaboration pits art against life in perpetual conflict.


Sports of The Times; The White Sox Putting Michael Behind Them
THE Chicago White Sox are not exactly dead.
At one point it seemed they might well have been going home early today -- 25 players in 25 chartered planes, to paraphrase the old Boston Red Sox, who were said to go out for dinner in 25 separate taxis.
On the brink of collapse, Wilson Alvarez shut down the Blue Jays, 6-1, Friday night, and then an improbable collection of players like Lance Johnson and Tim Belcher conspired to beat the Jays, 7-4, last night, showing that the White Sox would not be dragged down by whiners on their own team, by ancient jinxes, or even by the current bad karma from the retirement of a certain Chicagoland icon.


Star Gazers Fear San Diego Is Drawing the Blinds
The latest discovery by astronomers here: People and stars do not mix after all.
A recent decision by the San Diego City Council to switch from dull yellow astronomer-friendly street lights to dazzling white ones illustrates the increasing difficulty scientists are having in finding sites free of what they call light pollution.


Spicier Old Stops, Exotic New Ones
THE fall season is a pronounced one in the cruise industry.
The flotilla that cruises to Alaska in spring and summer has relocated to warm-weather ports, there are longer cruises to choose from, and South America and the South Pacific show up on more itineraries.
Many veteran travelers prefer fall and winter cruises because they provide a respite from the cold and from the summer throngs who have helped the industry achieve record bookings almost every year since the 1970's.
Since then growth in the number of passengers has averaged more than nine percent a year, and is expected to grow from 4.4 million passengers in 1993 to eight million in the year 2000.

Wall Street; In the First Wallet, He's a Distant Second
PRESIDENT CLINTON is rich in power, but a lot less so in assets.
Documents filed with the United States Office of Government Ethics show the details of his holdings as of July 4, when he and the rest of the First Family put their assets in a blind trust to sidestep conflicts.
At the time, he owned a few mutual funds and a lone municipal bond, together valued at less than $125,000.


Ms. Ackermann, Mr. Black
Marsha E. Ackermann, a doctoral student in American culture at the University of Michigan, was married on Friday to Thomas K. Black 3d, the production and operations manager for the Fame Software Corporation in Ann Arbor, Mich.

She was a legislative aide and speechwriter for former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro and a communications specialist for the International Business Machines Corporation She graduated from Cornell University.
She is the daughter of the late Edward and Lee Ackermann.


THE KILLER FROM CULIACAN
In much of Latin America, it is pure European blood and background that is honored ("The Killer From Culiacan," by Charles Leerhsen, Aug. 29).
Mention of black and Indian blood is studiously avoided.
Not in Mexico, however.
There, it is refreshing to hear a man say proudly: "Yo soy indio. Yo soy Mexicano."


And Now, Star of Cozzene Falls to Earth
Racing's year of upsets produced one of its biggest yesterday when the French import Apple Tree won the $500,000 Turf Classic at Belmont Park while Star of Cozzene, the leading candidate for Horse of the Year, ran fourth in a field of five.
That wasn't all.
Thirty minutes later, Birdonthewire won the $200,000 Vosburgh by two and a half lengths over Take Me Out while the two favorites, Ibero and the Canadian star Alydeed, ran fourth and fifth in the field of six.
And the man in the winning saddle in both upsets was Mike Smith, who has been New York's leading jockey for the last three years.


The Very Rich Hours Of Florine Stettheimer
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HAS IT that the American modernist Florine Stettheimer led a charmed life, which she transformed into an equally charmed art.
Rich, educated at the Art Students League and abroad, she lived, mostly with her adored mother and sisters, a life that was as cloistered as it was cutting-edge.
From their apartment in the Alwyn Court near Carnegie Hall, Stettheimer reigned over one of the most frequented salons of the small New York avant-garde in the 20's and 30's.
Its members included the artists Marcel Duchamp, Gaston Lachaise and Elie Nadelman, the composers Virgil Thomson and Edward Varese, the novelist Carl Van Vechten and the art critic Henry McBride.


Waffles Aren't Just for Breakfast Anymore
RECENTLY, my husband and I bought an old house in northwestern Connecticut, one of those buildings laughingly described as "needing work." Among the things left behind by the previous owners was a gleaming Art Deco waffle iron.
I had never made waffles before, so being the mother of a 5-year-old, it seemed a good time to learn.
In the back of a cupboard I discovered a mildewed cookbook missing its cover and first few pages.
It looked as though it dated back to the 1940's, and in it I found a recipe for waffles.
The previous afternoon my son and I had picked apples and raspberries in a local orchard, so I decided to add those to the recipe, and in the interests of health, I cut down the butter and used skim instead of whole milk.


Tarnished Knight On a Darker Stage
HAT saved Boris N. Yeltsin again was the face of his enemy.
Back in August 1991, the country and the soldiers rallied against the image of the Communist plotters, the bullying old bosses spouting their tired lies in the name of a discredited order.
There was no choice then.

Unfortunately, Miss Hardwick accepts certain statements at face value.


The Art of the Meal
Rising like soldiers from their furrows, corn is a beacon of summer.
While bundled and dried and stacked into shocks, it's the denouement of fall.
In "The Story of Corn," Betty Fussell writes of those cultures that set their seasonal clock by the life cycle of corn -- measuring their self-worth by its bounty, their future by how deftly preserved it is for the months of howling winds.

Habitats/A Quirk on Bedford Street; Barrymore's Slim Stage
WALKING tours regularly clog the sidewalk outside the incredibly narrow brick house on the old Greenwich Village street.
"They keep taking snapshots of each other with their arms spread out across the whole width of the house," said Christopher Dubs, who has been trying to buy the house at 75 1/2 Bedford Street, between Morton and Commerce Streets, since last November and thinks he may soon succeed.


From Wide Right to Right On for F.S.U.
Of all the obstacles that have stood between Florida State University and that elusive national football championship, the Seminoles understood that the fourth quarter was the worst of all.
Hidden mistakes and kicks that sailed wide right had allowed the Miami Hurricanes to take a last-minute grasp of the big ones that got away.
The Seminoles could not allow that to happen today and continue to dream of a perfect season.
They used two early, dramatic scores to put Miami behind at the start, and this time, at last, the Seminoles never let go.
Florida State's imperfect but cathartic 28-10 victory ended Miami's 31-game regular-season winning streak and propelled the Seminoles beyond a point that has wrecked their hopes too many times.
Miami's defeat was the first in a regular-season game since a loss at Notre Dame on Oct. 20, 1990, and the most one-sided defeat other than a bowl game since a 38-3 loss to the Seminoles on Sept. 22, 1984.

The New Four F's For Women
To the Editor:
The four F's of newspapers' "women's pages" ("Pages Of Their Own?" Oct. 3), are no longer food, fashions, family and furnishings.
Today's working woman is concerned with "femily" (a household headed by a single woman), F.O.H. (Friends of Hillary), financial planning and "fairy tales" (as R. W. Jackson, in "The Diabolical Dictionary of Modern English," calls "romance, job satisfaction, stress management, privacy, money in the bank, and other grims").

Abuses Plague Programs to Help Exports of Agricultural Products
The Agriculture Department's $40 billion campaign to bolster crop exports, begun a decade ago to help beleaguered farmers, has instead enriched a small group of multinational corporations while doing little to expand the American share of the world's agricultural markets.
From 1986 through 1989, for example, one large Agriculture Department program to help the United States compete against the Europeans awarded $1.38 billion -- more than half its payouts -- to four multinational corporations, two of them based in Europe: Louis Dreyfus of France and Artfer Inc., which is owned by the Ferruzzi Group of Italy.
The others were Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis and Continental Grain of Chicago.


Getting Respect From City Hall
Michael Anglin stood amid weeds, broken glass and discarded needles in Morningside Park on a hill overlooking the paddleball courts at 122d Street, where he and his friends play after work.
Eight blocks down, across the critical divide between the Upper West Side and Harlem, are a well-kept baseball diamond, new playground equipment and a waterfall, all of which the city has installed over the last few years.
"There are two parks," Mr. Anglin said. "It's like this is two towns."


Small Merchants Sprucing Up Along Mermaid Avenue
Because of a recent influx of city, state and private funds, the dilapidated mom-and-pop businesses along Mermaid Avenue are sprucing up and expanding in hopes of attracting families drawn to the area by an urban renewal program.
More than 2,000 people have moved in since 1981, filling the 700 homes built under urban renewal, but they tend to shop at the larger, more modern stores in Bensonhurst, Mill Basin and Bay Ridge.


Albany Officials Gloomy Over Bank Company's Merger and Move
Business and political leaders here searched this week for a silver lining in the announcement that Albany's leading banking institution, Keycorp, will merge with an Ohio company and move its corporate headquarters to Cleveland.
Keycorp officials attempted to soften the blow, arguing that fewer than 100 executives are likely to move after the merger with the Society Corporation next March creates the nation's 10th-largest banking institution.

Oct. 3-9: Tailhook '93; An Admiral Is Salvaged As the Fraternity Sobers Up
Adm.
Frank B. Kelso's job as Chief of Naval Operations was spared last week by Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who overruled the Secretary of the Navy and retained the ranking officer to have attended the Tailhook Association convention of 1991 -- that infamous bacchanal that ruined military careers and added a new word to the language, synonymous with sexual abuse of women by drunken naval aviators.
But a small and subdued band of Tailhook Association members, virtually all of them retired and too old for serious hell-raising, were not mollified when they gathered in San Diego this weekend for the first convention since the scandal.

Contrary to "Mercedes Selects Alabama Site" (Business Day, Sept. 30), which states that Mercedes-Benz "will build its first automobile assembly plant in America in Tuscaloosa County, Ala.," Mercedes actually opened its first United States plant about 1906 on Long Island for the American Mercedes.
Production ceased in 1913 after a fire.
Since that plant was a joint venture with Steinway Piano, the product could be (and no doubt was) called a "well-tuned automobile." LOUIS T. WELLS JR.

Management Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University Boston, Oct. 1, 1993


Dinners in the kitchen
Throughout history, dinner parties have been a counterpoint to daily life: starch for the rough-and-tumble early years of the country, excess in its lean times, haute cuisine for an era better known for jello molds and tuna casserole.
At the height of the recent craze for formality, friends confided their culinary misgivings in tones formerly reserved for suspicions of marital infidelity.
Today, the rise of simple, soul-warming cuisine suggests a move away from forced elegance.
"Dinner at 8" now signals an oasis in the modern, nanosecond-driven world.
And the best way for a host to engender that calm is to embody it.


Words Galore


Lawyers Do Their Bit, Too
To the Editor:
Dr.
Ribnik's article only goes to prove that some people are a little behind in their reading.
What the article calls "Lexicare" has been in operation for 30 years under the name "Judicare."


Does Coverage Polarize Elections?
To the Editor:
"Clinton Hits a Nerve on Race," (editorial, Sept. 30) highlights the tendency of voters to follow racial lines in biracial contests, often in response to campaign rhetoric.
But you ignore how the mass media's poll-driven, horse-race coverage of elections may exacerbate this tendency.


Still Mired in Last Season, Rangers to Keep Practicing
The Rangers' coach, Mike Keenan, already had scheduled practice for the next day at the team's workout complex at Rye Playland, despite the fact it was Sunday and, in the past, Sundays have often been optional days for the Rangers, days when they could rest.
Had a practice not been planned, though, tonight's game at Pittsburgh's Civic Arena probably would have precipitated one.
Three games into this young season, the Rangers continue to show signs of the problems that plagued them last season -- namely, a failure to hold a lead, a failure to capitalize on opportunities and a penchant for defensive mistakes.


Easier Said Than Done; Fragmented New Jersey Struggles to Cut Taxes
To understand the campaign arguments of Gov.
Jim Florio and Christine Todd Whitman over state spending, the three adjacent Bergen County school districts of Allendale, Ho-Ho-Kus and Saddle River offer a telling lesson.
Their combined enrollments are only 1,400, about the size of a high school in some places.
But their combined budgets add up to $15 million, as much as what a medium-sized city often spends for two or three times the number of students.


You Are What You Wear
"IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO DRESS IMPROPER TO your sex," says a surly, suspicious shopkeeper as she watches a young woman look over the men's clothes.
The setting happens to be the American frontier in the 19th century, but the shopkeeper in "The Ballad of Little Jo" is expressing an idea that a half-dozen film makers have decided to challenge in places as far-flung as Beijing and Middle America.
Even before "The Crying Game" made transvestites the trendiest of heroes, three current films with cross-dressing characters were in the works.
Maggie Greenwald's richly textured and eloquent "Little Jo" and David Cronenberg's shrewd "M. Butterfly" are now playing.
Chen Kaige's "Farewell My Concubine," an extraordinary tale that sweeps through 50 years of Chinese theater and politics, opens on Friday after having played at the New York Film Festival.


HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL REPORT
P.S.A.L.
SEEING DOUBLE: Duane Williams (18 carries for 124 yards, 2 touchdowns) and Duane Pickney (20 carries for 131 yards, 3 touchdowns) combined for all of TRUMAN'S (3-1) points as the Blue Devils hammered BRYANT (1-3), 36-6.


Harvest Festival Helps Pupils Study Plants
BASKETS of summer-grown produce overflowing with ripe tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, green peppers and corn nestled next to pots of marigolds and dried flower arrangements.
A cornucopia spilled forth gourds, squash and pumpkins near a wreath decorated with Indian corn, berries and dried cornstalks.
Perched under trees and along fences sat an assortment of life-size scarecrows, dressed to resemble farmers, cowgirls and fashion models.


Little Big People
ONE DAY LAST MAY, MY SON'S thirdgrade classroom was left in the care of a substitute teacher.
For reasons still undetermined, a small riot broke out, with children fighting, shrieking and shoving chairs.
Nine-year-olds going berserk in springtime is not unprecedented, but consider what happened next: The new principal lectured them with a sternness they were unaccustomed to.
Then she made them write letters of apology and then they fell apart all over again.
Those who claimed they had not participated in the brawl came down at dismissal time tearful and incensed at the burden of collective guilt imposed upon them.
"Isn't it illegal for her to punish those of us who did nothing?" one boy asked his mother.
"Should we sue her?" asked another.
When told they should show more respect for authority, one girl said, "Why should we respect her when she showed no respect for us?"
In the office of a child therapist recently, a 10-year-old girl leaned back and gazed at her mother with half-lidded contempt.
The child was there because her divorced parents couldn't do anything with her.
Her father was bitter because he had brought her along to buy his girlfriend an engagement gift and she had sulked the whole time.
Her mother complained that she refused to make friends with the mother's boyfriend.
"How do you expect me to have a relationship with him," the girl said with the ennui of a 40-year-old, "when he's always in your bedroom?"


Two-Line
To the Editor:
In his article about Wolfgang Sawallisch, the new conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra  [ "Old Sound, New Resonance," Sept. 19 ] , Stephen Johnson speaks of a German influence in American musical life.
To fortify his contention, he also mentions Kurt Masur and Christoph von Dohnanyi.


What Do Lawyers Do As Families Crumble?
While one might argue against the credentials, tactics and philosophy of Milton Louvaris's group  [ "Group Attacked Over Legal Advice," Sept. 26 ] , it cannot be argued that the matrimonial bar and Family Court system are in dire need of reform.

The States' Stakes In Clinton's Health Plan
ANY social program as vast and complex as President Clinton's health-care plan has to have disparate effects on a country as vast and complex as the United States.
For all of its specificity, the plan has left the states trying to figure whether they would be winners or losers.
Take Texas, the state with the highest percentage of workers (25.3 percent) who have no health insurance.
By requiring all employers to pay for health insurance, the plan would hit Texas businesses especially hard.
But this mandate should mean better health care for 3.8 million uninsured Texans.


Beyond Foley Square: Acting Like a Tourist Close to Home; Brooklyn
One of the best tonics for courthouse cabin fever in New York City is available to the Brooklyn juror.
Just a 10-minute walk from the downtown courthouses, the Brooklyn Heights Promenade offers a spectacular, and restorative, view of lower Manhattan and the harbor.
Or stroll through Brooklyn Heights itself, immediately west of downtown Brooklyn and renowned for its 19th-century architecture -- stately brownstones on streets like Pierrepont and Remsen, country-flavored frame homes on Hicks and Middagh and richly designed churches.


Taylor Sees Future for Linebackers After He Calls It Quits With Giants
Lawrence Taylor, bum leg and all, sits atop the mountain like Zeus and looks down at all of the football mortals.
Every now and then Taylor will step away from his throne, visit with the other players and dispatch a piece of wisdom that can hit you like a lightning bolt.
In his own Zeus-like way, Taylor did just that this week by basically anointing another to the throne he will soon be departing.
If anything, this season Taylor has been the good Giants citizen.
His friends have left, both voluntarily and otherwise.
For the first time in his career, he was yanked from a game, because an ailing hamstring forced him to be less than average.
He knows the end is near, and there was no better indication of that when he basically named fellow linebacker Corey Miller as the Man to Replace L.T.


Jennifer Barbiero and Stephen Droesch

Her grandfather the late Anthony Barbiero was a New York State Assemblyman and a judge of Nassau County District Court.


A Show That Spans 30 Years and 2 Networks
IN ITS TWO SEASONS, IT DREW plenty of awards and critical valentines, but "I'll Fly Away" never commanded a big enough audience to persuade NBC to keep it on the air.
While its true subject was the epic racial struggles of the 1950's and 60's, the show disguised itself as a gentle, often troubling family drama about a white lawyer in rural Georgia (played by Sam Waterston) and the black housekeeper (Regina Taylor) who cares for his three children.
When NBC canceled the show in May, PBS stepped forward and granted a rare reprieve: not only would public television broadcast repeats of all 38 episodes, but it would also commission a final chapter resolving the fates of all major characters.
That two-hour wrap-up, titled "Then and Now," will be seen tomorrow night on many PBS stations; the reruns will commence next week.


Paris in New York
This week, all eyes are on Paris, as the spring '94 ready-to-wear shows kick into high gear.
But there's still plenty of autumn ooh-la-la to be found on this side of the Atlantic in the myriad French boutiques sprinkled around Manhattan.


Tales of Police Corruption Not Surprising, 46th Precinct Residents Say
Every night, Winston Williams and his friends on Ryer Avenue made it a point to switch on the evening news to learn the latest from a mayoral panel's hearings on police corruption.
What they cannot forget is the face of that one officer, they said, close up on the screen, eyes unblinking and unremorseful, talking about the beatings he said he dispensed to drug dealers and residents on his beat a few years back and the drugs he stole in the 46th Precinct in the Bronx.


Duets By Wire
It was just too marvelous, too marvelous for words -- familiar words, that is, like duet.
For Frank Sinatra's next album, his first in nine years, the latest in fiber-optic telecommunications allowed a modern singer's dream: tele-crooning, or literally phoning in your performance.
The Sinatra album, due Nov. 2, involved duets with 13 far-flung artists.
Rather than face a nightmare of scheduling, Mr.
Sinatra's producer, Phil Ramone, turned to a system of high-capacity phone lines operated by the San Francisco-based Entertainment Digital Network.
With Mr.
Sinatra laying down tracks in Hollywood, Mr.
Ramone later mixed in live transmissions from the other performers -- Aretha Franklin from Detroit, Tony Bennett in New York, Charles Aznavour in London and Liza Minelli in Brazil.


Haiti: Mission Impossible?
On Thursday 600 American soldiers were supposed to leave for Haiti to help arrange the transition from military rule to the installation of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Their departure was delayed because a nervous Pentagon wanted "clarification" of their mission.
The objections, according to a state Department spokesman, have either been answered or overruled, and troops are now on their way, due to arrive in Port-au-Prince tomorrow.
That's a pity, because their mission, in its present form, will not work.

Portable Seinfeld
WHAT: "SeinLanguage," a book of "the stuff I have that you can read" by the comedian and sitcom star Jerry Seinfeld.
No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list for hardcover nonfiction since Sept. 19; 750,000 copies sold since its debut on Aug. 25.
WHY THE GOLD RUSH?
Because his fans cannot get enough.
Mr.
Seinfeld has spawned much more than a hit television show; the passions of his admirers carry something of the collective force of a minor social movement.
For them, conversation is at its sweetest when the topic turns to Seinfeld moments.


Anthony Confronts Unfinished Business
As he talked about the upcoming Knicks season today, Greg Anthony was smiling.
It has not always been easy for Anthony to smile.
The March 23 brawl in Phoenix that led to a $20,000 fine and a five-game suspension for Anthony is the strongest memory most people have about his past season.
That incident, coupled with a severely sprained right ankle that he suffered March 16, turned a promising second season with the Knicks into frustration and disappointment.


IF PRODUCTIVITY'S RISING, WHY ARE JOBS PAYING LESS?
The fly in Rattner's pro-growth ointment is that "efficient" corporations may be firing the consumers who once bought their products.
If enough high-wage jobs are replaced by low-wage jobs, who will be left to buy the stream of goods turned out by "productive" industries?
It's a legitimate question one need not be a Luddite to ask.


Ms. Debra Gersh, Mr. Hernandez
Debra Ellen Gersh, the daughter of Richard and Arlene Gersh of Glen Ridge, N.J., was married yesterday to Gregory Hernandez, a son of Gregorio and Carmen Hernandez of Brooklyn.
Gerald E. Williams, a civil marriage officiant, performed the ceremony at the Radisson Plaza Hotel in Alexandria, Va.
Mrs.
Gersh Hernandez, 30, is the Washington editor of Editor &amp; Publisher magazine.
She and her husband graduated from Syracuse University.
Her father is the president of Richard Gersh Associates Inc., and her mother is the creative director of Bit-by-Bit Creative Services, both public relations companies in New York.


Field for Omega Cup Is a Bermuda Triangle: Strong, Deep and Gold
Russell Coutts of New Zealand has cut a swath through the world of match-race sailing.
But his No. 1 ranking, solid as it seems, may not be enough to ward off the unusual number of America's Cup skippers that will gather at the Omega Gold Cup in Bermuda next week.
In its 54th year, the Gold Cup is expected to draw 24 match-racing teams for an eight-day competition that starts next Sunday off Hamilton, Bermuda.
Thirteen of the skippers are linked to 1995 America's Cup campaigns.


Assault-Rifle Sales Ban Prompts Legal Confusion
A significant chapter in Connecticut's long debate about gun control and crime may have seemed closed in June when Gov.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. gleefully signed into law the nation's third statewide ban on assault-rifle sales.
Wrong.


Ms. Kelley, Mr. Southworth 3d
Mary Kathryn Kelley, the daughter of Rosemary and Kevin Kelley of West Point, N.Y., was married there yesterday to Hamilton Southworth 3d, the son of Eleanor and Hamilton Southworth Jr. of New York.
The Rev.
Richard Funk, a Baptist minister, performed the nondenominational ceremony in the Old Cadet Chapel at the United States Military Academy.
Ms.
Kelley is keeping her name.
She graduated from Mills College, and she and her husband, both 27, are to graduate from the University of Virginia School of Law in December.
They plan to practice law next spring in San Diego, where she is to become an associate at Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison and he an associate at Klinedinst, Fliehman, McKillop &amp; Jones.


Correction
A picture caption last Sunday about warrants granted by the British royal family described an illustration incorrectly.
What was shown was not itself a warrant, but the Queen's coat of arms, which the warrant grants a merchant the right to display.

Virtuoso Fare





Lost in India
My Grandfather, William Dorsey Beal, died too young to figure in my childhood.
His is the missing chair in the quartet of parents' parents who posed in front of the fireplace with my father, mother, sisters and baby me.
To my mother, barely a year old when he died, he was the tall ghost whom she wished to say she remembered; to her children, he was some sun-bleached portraits.
Although I had inherited his last name as my middle, it was seldom spoken in our house, even by my grandmother.
What little I know about him now I've learned from a thick file of documents she prepared during her last years.
He seems to have been a virtuous but luckless man.
A Methodist Episcopal missionary who went to India in 1904 because my grandmother convinced him that her father the bishop could aid the young couple, he served with her for 11 years in Muzaffarpur, Calcutta and Belgaum.
During their last posting in the city of Meerut, he contracted a throat infection that went unrecognized as diphtheria.
The serum that could have saved him arrived a day late from the hill station.
My grandmother, left with debts and four young children, was too stunned to grieve at the funeral.
A smattering of mourners kept their distance from the ceremony for fear of contagion.
He was buried 8,000 miles from his birthplace in Ohio, at the age of 36.

She graduated from Cornell University, as did her husband, and she received a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University.


JAPAN'S NEW TRAIN IS LOSING ITS STEAM
Sleek, speedy and almost always on time, the bullet train has stood for three decades as a symbol of Japan's reputation for advanced technology and efficiency.
But the newest and fastest bullet is shooting holes in that reputation.
The new Nozomi train, whose name means hope, has been plagued by breakdowns and defects since it went into service a year and a half ago.
Bolts have fallen out, welds and windows have cracked, doors have failed to close and a control stick broke off in a driver's hand.


PARTY SUPPORTING BRITAIN'S LEADER
Prime Minister John Major's greatest achievement at the Conservative Party conference this week can be summed up in a single word: survival.
From the opening speeches Tuesday morning to the rousing ovation given to Mr.
Major's closing address on Friday afternoon, it was clear that party leaders had been able to stave off any immediate challenge to his leadership and snuff out signs of rebellion.
Mr.
Major's hourlong speech was a call for a return to "the old core values" -- discipline, decency, self-reliance and respect for the law and family.
"It's back to basics," he declared.

Titled "Discover Five Treasures on the Lower East Side," it gives detailed information about Little Italy, Chinatown, the area around Orchard and Delancey Streets, the East Village and the East Village area east of Avenue B called Loisaida by its largely Hispanic population from the Spanish pronunciation of Lower East Side.
Each neighborhood is represented with sections labeled "Discover the History," "Discover the Cultures" and "Discover the Sights."


POSTINGS: 55 Water Street; New Start for a Troubled Building
Finally, the end of a painful odyssey for a troubled building: Last week the ownership of the 52-story, 3.6 million-square-foot 55 Water Street was formally transferred from Olympia &amp; York to the New Water Street Corporation, the majority of which is owned by the Retirement Systems of Alabama.
And now the more pleasant journey begins: taking the once-debt-laden building from run-down property to modern corporate center.
It won't be a quick trip or a cheap one.
It will cost well over $20 million to remove asbestos.
The new owners plan to install a back-up electrical system to end, once and for all, the electricity outages that have plagued the building.
And they've just hired the architects Kohn Pedersen Fox to come up with an extensive cosmetic remodeling plan as well.

He Was a Good Samaritan Of the Subway, or Was He?
To the Editor:
On a recent subway ride in Manhattan, I witnessed a most strange phenomenon.
A well-dressed young man stood in the center of the car and offered to give something away.
"Are there any homeless people in this car?" he inquired.
"Any hungry people? Just signal me, and I'll give you a cup of coffee and a bag of doughnuts."

Plant Now for Best Results in Spring
THIS is an odd time of year for most gardeners.
The tree leaves are beginning to turn.
There are signals everywhere that the growing period is going fast.
Some may think about moving activities indoors.
Yet there is reluctance.
It is so delightful to be outside.
Lawns still need mowing.
There is an enormous amount of yardwork still to be done.
Don't put the tools away.
Savor the month.


Economics 401
To the Sports Editor:
Baseball owners seem unable to reach agreement on sharing local media revenue.
According to Murray Chass ("Owners Circle Bases But Don't Score," The Times, Sept. 7), lawsuits have been threatened by the high-revenue clubs, and the owners' chief labor executive says, "Everyone is acting pretty much in their own self-interest."
One of the reasons that revenue sharing in major league baseball is controversial is the lack of agreement on the financial success of the teams.
Owners continually cry poverty, but the amounts that teams sell for suggest financial success.
In my view, all major league baseball teams are financially successful and revenue sharing is superfluous to this nonexistent problem.


At Last, Work to Begin on a Civil Courthouse
After waiting for more than 20 years for a Civil Courthouse, Queens is finally ready to break ground.

"I expect that the litigants will jump with joy."


Editors' Note
The Travel section on Aug. 29 carried an article by Michael Modzelewski headed "At the Top of Europe," about Norwegian Lapland.

Evaluating Threats to the Water Supply
A RECENTLY released study from the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Manhattan, suggests that New York City's reservoir systems, which supply many Westchester residents with drinking water, are at risk from population and development pressures that threaten the water quality.
The report identifies poorly planned development, sewage and urban runoff as long-term threats to such Westchester reservoirs as Kensico, Cross River, Muscoot and New Croton.
The study also proposes that new Federal and state regulatory standards be established to protect those watersheds.

DOME Garden Won't Go to School
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines may save a popular community garden on West 84th Street.
On Wednesday, Mr.
Cortines told the Board of Education that he would not approve moving the garden to Louis D. Brandeis High School's schoolyard.
The Housing Authority has been trying to move the DOME garden -- named for Development of Opportunities through Meaningful Education, the group that oversees it -- to build a housing project on the site, between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues.


Selectivity
Most people think a total transformation means tearing down walls.
But when the building is old and the apartment a rental, resourcefulness serves better than a wrecking crew.
Donald Kaufman and Taffy Dahl, well-known color consultants, relied on paint, artwork and a way with castoff furniture to give their rented Soho walk-up personality.
Occupying the top floors of an 1823 town house, the duplex offered a few challenges: eight small rooms with odd geometries (the building lost a corner when the street in front was widened).
But that, plus the pine plank floors, Victorian tilework and generations of paint on the stairs, gave the apartment an errant charm suited to the mood they were after.
"We couldn't afford a country house, but we needed a refuge," Kaufman says.
"We wanted something that felt as if you could walk out into the woods."
Permanent alterations were out of the question, so they made only one minor structural adjustment: built-in bookcases in the living room.
Then they started mixing paints.
"Paint is cheap, compared to other things," Kaufman says.
It was the obvious choice for this husband-and-wife team: They create paints in one-of-a-kind nuanced shades for architects and designers like Philip Johnson, Thad Hayes and Thierry Despont, not to mention artists like Ross Bleckner and even the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
"Our clients tend to be the color-obsessed," says Kaufman.


RESULTS PLUS
N.H.L. 27,227 Watch Lightning  A National Hockey League-record crowd of 27,227 watched Florida goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck stop all 36 Tampa Bay shots last night in a 2-0 Panthers victory that spoiled the Lightning's opener at the Thunderdome in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
The victory was the first for the expansion Panthers (1-1-1), who opened the season with a 4-4 tie Wednesday at Chicago.
Tampa Bay fell to 0-3.
The shutout was the 19th in an 11-year career for Vanbiesbrouck (1-0-1), who was acquired from the Vancouver Canucks in the 1993 expansion draft.(AP) Bruins 7, Nordiques 3: Adam Oates scored two of his three goals on power plays during a five-goal first period, and the Bruins went on to a 7-3 victory over the Quebec Nordiques last night at Boston.
Oates has four goals and nine points in three games this season.(AP) Flyers 5, Whalers 2: Josef Beranek and Kevin Dineen scored twice each in Philadelphia's five-goal first period, and the Flyers won at Hartford, making the Whalers 0-5-2 in home openers in the last seven years.
Despite that record, there was a full house of 15,635 at the Civic Center.
Many of those in attendance took advantage of a free ticket offer.(AP) TENNIS Another Yzaga Upset  Jaime Yzaga of Peru continued his giant-killing run at the Australian Indoor championships last night in Sydney, beating the defending champion, Goran Ivanisevic, 6-3, 6-4.
Ivanisevic is ranked ninth in the world and had won 10 matches in a row.
The unseeded Yzaga, ranked 54th, will face sixth-seeded Petr Korda in today's final.
Korda defeated Wayne Ferreira, 6-3, 6-2. (AP) Navratilova Advances: Top-seeded Martina Navratilova went a step closer to another title yesterday when she moved into the European Indoors final in Zurich.
Navratilova scored a 6-3, 6-4 semifinal victory over third-seeded Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria.
Maleeva's oldest sister, fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, won the other semifinal, beating Stephanie Rottier by 6-2, 7-5. (AP) GOLF Stadler Shares Lead  Craig Stadler was one of the lucky players at the rain-delayed Walt Disney World-Oldsmobile Classic yesterday in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
He got in the last six holes of the second round of the $1 million PGA Tour event in the morning, then shot a four-under-par 68 for 203 to grab a share of the lead with Ed Humenik among the third-round finishers before an afternoon thunderstorm stopped play for the second straight day.
Not only was much of the field still scattered over three courses being used for the tournament, but Jeff Maggert and Skip Kendall -- two-thirds of the threesome who led after 36 holes -- hadn't even begun the third round.
That means some players will have to play 36 holes today if tournament officials meet a goal of getting in 72 holes without delaying the finish until tomorrow. (AP)
Shaw Comes Up 68 Again: Tom Shaw shot a 4-under-par 68 yesterday and took a one-stroke lead over Simon Hobday in the $600,000 Transamerica Senior Golf Championship at Napa, Calif.
Shaw's second straight 68 left him with an 8-under 136 total after 36 holes on the south course at Silverado Country Club.
Hobday carded the tournament's lowest round, a 66.
Weber knocked down 7,367 pins and collected a total of 8,132 points.
Yasutomo Bannai of Japan was the second-highest qualifier. (AP) SOCCER Tranmere Moves Closer  Tranmere improved its chances for its first berth in England's top soccer league with 2-1 victory over Bolton yesterday to move into first place in Division One.
Foward Pat Nevin scored the winning goal with nine minutes to play.
The Premier League had the day off in advance of England's World Cup qualifier Wednesday at the Netherlands.
Tranmere, in the Football League since 1921, has never played among England's elite, but a finish in the top two would grant the Rovers an automatic place in the Premier League next season. (AP)


Perfect Dive In

Robert Lipsyte found just the right balance in dealing with Greg Louganis's sexual orientation and its effect on his sports and after-sports careers ("Louganis Approaches the Edge of the Stage, and Leaps," The Times, Sept. 19).

Sex Industry Defends Itself
Behind the yellow blinking lights of Manhattan Video, an adult store on 39th Street off Fifth Avenue, leaders of a new association met on Thursday to discuss strategy.
The group, yet to be named, has a clear goal: to defend the sex industry against neighborhood protests and moves by the city toward increased regulation.
A loose coalition of some 50 sex businesses, the association was formed in reaction to the Manhattan Borough President's Task Force on the Regulation of Sex-Related Businesses, which was established last spring to address complaints about the spread of sex businesses in residential areas.

Streetscapes/The Northern Dispensary; Plan to House Homeless With AIDS Stirs a Protest
FOR more than a century and a half the Northern Dispensary, at Waverly Place and Christopher Street, did "a great deal of good without making much noise," as The Evening Post described the public clinic (then in rented quarters elsewhere) in 1828.
But now a small battle has erupted as a neighborhood group protests a plan to reopen the tiny triangular building as a residence for 15 homeless people with AIDS.
So far the only concrete hope of the protesters is a 162-year-old deed restriction.


Coach Sets Record
Summerville (S.C.) High School Coach JOHN McKISSICK stepped off the sideline and into history Friday night, becoming the coach with the most victories in football.

The Executive Computer; Free Technical Support: An Endangered Species of Service
THERE is no such thing as a free lunch, and there may soon be no such thing as a free technical support call.
As prices and profit margins fall in the personal computer software industry, some software makers are charging their customers for what was once "free" technical advice.
The Microsoft Corporation, for example, has revamped its technical support programs, and part of the plan includes new "priority" and "premium" fees for customers who call outside business hours seeking solutions to their problems.


Sports of The Times; The Braves Don't Want To Be Bills
AS a high school pitcher and hockey center in the Boston area, Tom Glavine was drafted in 1984 by both the Braves and hockey's Los Angeles Kings.
He chose baseball, developing into a three-time 20-game winner.
But if he had signed with the Kings, he once was asked, what would have happened to Wayne Gretzky?
Going along with the gag, the Braves' ace left-hander said, "I guess Wayne would've had to move to wing."

On Not Misreading Murder Statistics
To the Editor:
"High Murder Rate for Women on Job" (news article, Oct. 3) states that 40 percent of women killed at work are murdered, while the figure for men is only 15 percent.
Officials suggested that this "difference" is due to the large number of women exposed to crime while working late at night.
The clear message is that women are at greater risk of being murdered in the workplace than men.
A critical reading of other statistics in the article discloses an entirely different picture.
Men account for 93 percent of all job-related deaths, although only 55 percent of the work force is male.
What this means is that less than 3 percent (40 percent of 7 percent) of workplace deaths are female murders, while almost 14 percent (15 percent of 93 percent) are male murders.
If we then take account of the differential representation of the sexes in the work force, we can see that a man is almost four times as likely to be murdered in the workplace as a woman and that a man is more than 11 times as likely as a woman to be killed on the job by all causes combined.
Thus, the reason that a greater proportion of female deaths in the workplace are murders is not that women are murdered at a higher rate than men, because they are not.
It is rather that men are killed at a higher rate by other causes.
The slant of this report is symptomatic of the treatment of virtually any statistics that show differences between men and women.
It is almost as if a conscious decision had been made along the line to report the information in a way to reinforce the notion that women are being victimized.

Windows on a World of Storybook Charm and Precision
THAT "Animal Antics," at the Scarsdale Historical Society, is aimed at children should not deter adults from investigating it -- and they don't have to be adults who are still children at heart, either.
Robert Heitmann, a star in other productions of the society, has returned with more of his dioramas based on nursery tales.
Most illustrate episodes from "The Tale of Peter Rabbit," "Alice in Wonderland" and "The Wind in the Willows"; a few represent tales that have yet to be told.
It is likely that more people are familiar with Mr.
Heitmann's work than know his name, for he has been doing Christmas windows for Tiffany for about 15 years.
As recounted by the artist in a recent telephone conversation, his career has proceeded effortlessly, beginning with the traveling scholarship that he won while a student of painting at the Cincinnati Art Academy in 1950 and that took him to Florence for a year.
After that he came back to the United States, worked for the Kudner Advertising Agency in Manhattan, visited Europe again (mostly on a bicycle) and returned to New York to work for Benton &amp; Bowles.


Yeltsin Orders Regional Legislatures Replaced

Your Sept. 19 article, "Destroying Trees to Save Them," primarily focused on the recently destroyed London plane trees at Lincoln Center.
However, this action is only the latest in a continuing barrage against the park there.


Clash Of the Titans
Colossal statues have provoked colossal reactions since at least 280 B.C., when Chares of Lindos built the Colossus of Rhodes.
But none have undergone a saga like that of "Hammering Man," the 48-foot, 13-ton mechanized steel silhouette, thick-legged and small-torsoed like a Gumby toy and ragged-edged like a Rorschach-test blot, that pounds away outside the flashy new Seattle Art Museum.
In just two years, "he," as Seattleites tend to call the sculpture, has been saluted by the art establishment and a porn palace, savaged in newspaper columns and a book, accidentally smashed on the pavement and lampooned in a beer commercial and on "Saturday Night Live."


The Executive Life; Waking to the Power Of Our Dream Worlds
BY day, Shelby Yastrow oversees multimillion-dollar legal matters and other problems that can affect the bottom line of the McDonald's Corporation.
But at night, the company's general counsel enters a very different boardroom, one in which he consistently humiliates himself by being totally unprepared for a meeting.
This is Mr.
Yastrow's recurring dream, and he is not alone.
Versions of this nighttime drama keep many executive-level colleagues working overtime in their sleep.
Nearly all of the 18 executives contacted for this article reported some variation of Mr.
Yastrow's dream: being one credit short of the number required to graduate, missing a critical court date or having to take an exam in a course for which they never went to class.


Trying to Save a Home For Snakes and 6 Cats
An article on Sept. 12 reported a proposal by the city's Housing Authority to move a 15-year-old community garden on West 84th Street in Manhattan to make way for a housing project for the homeless.
Under the plan, the garden would be relocated in a schoolyard across the street.
Last week, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines said he opposed that move.
The garden is operated by a neighborhood group called DOME, for Development of Opportunities through Meaningful Education.
To the Editor:
I'm writing to you about DOME.
Please don't tear it down!
There are lots of unused car lots in New York.
DOME garden is home to snakes, six cats, plants and other animals.
I know it's for a good cause, but when you look the other way, we need the garden!

Tenants Slowing A Sale
A COLONIAL house in Scarsdale, N.Y, was offered for sale last May for $525,000.
It was a desirable home in a fashionable neighborhood and should have sold rapidly.
It did not.
The house had been rented pending a turnaround in the market.
And once the tenant discovered she might soon have to leave she refused to let brokers show the house.


A Collision in Court on Exxon's Oil Spill
THE cleanup of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska has moved from the shores of Prince William Sound to the courts of New York and Houston.
Now the Exxon Corporation and more than 100 insurers led by Lloyd's of London are suing each other over who should pay part of the multibillion-dollar tab for cleaning up the mess.
The dispute promises to be a closely watched battle royal for its sheer size, the corporate titans and legal personalities involved and its implications for pollution insurance and maritime law.
Although the legal battle is just getting under way, the rhetoric is already rumbling.


Farrakhan Plans Yankee Stadium Rally 3 Days Before Vote
The Rev.
Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader admired by many black New Yorkers and despised by many Jews, is organizing a big rally to be held at Yankee Stadium just three days before the mayoral election -- a politically awkward prospect for Mayor David N. Dinkins, who needs both a huge black turnout and substantial Jewish support to win.
Many times over the years, and as recently as last week, Mr.
Dinkins has condemned Mr.
Farrakhan for his reference to Judaism as "a gutter religion" and other remarks seen by many as anti-Semitic.
But the minister's presence in New York City so close to the election could put Mr.
Dinkins in the position of being asked to repeat his denunciations of Mr.
Farrakhan again and again, possibly undermining support for Mr.
Dinkins among Mr.
Farrakhan's followers.

Somalis Can Well Govern Themselves; Bring Them to Account
To the Editor:
In "Somalia: Learn from Cambodia" (editorial, Sept. 30), you praise the United Nations peacekeeping and election-supervising mission in Cambodia because it used "diplomatic pressure to curb human rights abuses." You suggest this approach would be effective in Somalia, specifically as an alternative to prosecuting those responsible for attacking United Nations peacekeepers.


'The Big City Newcomer Blues'
To the Editor:
I feel compelled to write in defense of Webster Apartments, the 34th Street women's residence mentioned as being dorm-like and "really unfriendly" by Cheryl Braje in the article on Sept. 26 headed "The Big City Newcomer Housing Blues." Ten years ago I made my way to the top of a very long waiting list and happily paid $400 a month for a furnished room, heat, hot water, electricity, breakfast, dinner and daily maid service.
I fail to understand how Ms.
Braje (who came to Webster after having experienced a number of dreadful lodging misfortunes) could find much fault in this delightful dwelling.


Catching That Fading Sound of Razzmatazz
These somewhat whimsical, far from definitive lists refer to the original-cast recordings of Broadway musicals, not the musicals themselves.
Recordings that transcend their station, however fitfully in some cases, are marked with an asterisk.
Only recent CD and cassette reissues of Broadway material in print from the 1950s and 1960s are listed, with an emphasis on recordings of forgotten flops and semi-remembered successes that have reappeared after long being unavailable.
Therefore, cult failures like "Candide," "Anyone Can Whistle," "House of Flowers" and "She Loves Me" are excluded along with the period's familiar, frequently revived hits.


Waffles Aren't Just for Breakfast Anymore
RECENTLY, my husband and I bought an old house in northwestern Connecticut, one of those buildings laughingly described as "needing work." Among the things left behind by the previous owners was a gleaming Art Deco waffle iron.
I had never made waffles before, so being the mother of a 5-year-old, it seemed a good time to learn.
In the back of a cupboard I discovered a mildewed cookbook missing its cover and first few pages.
It looked as though it dated back to the 1940's, and in it I found a recipe for waffles.
The previous afternoon my son and I had picked apples and raspberries in a local orchard, so I decided to add those to the recipe, and in the interests of health, I cut down the butter and used skim instead of whole milk.


To Read It Is to Destroy It
To the Editor:
Gerald Jonas writes that collectors who purchase for $2,000 the (very) limited deluxe edition of William Gibson's "Agrippa (A Book of the Dead)" wind up with a Hobson's choice of preserving the edition or reading it, because to read this "story-on-a-disk" is to destroy it.
But there is an obvious solution.


Pressing Too Hard Costs Karpov a Point
PRESSING too hard led to Anatoly Karpov's defeat in Game 2 of the International Chess Federation world championship match on Sept. 6 in Zwolle, the Netherlands.
It allowed Jan Timman to catch up at 1-1.
Karpov, a former world champion, tried to prevent the Dutch grandmaster from carrying out a routine procedure that would have brought about an even game, but Timman ingeniously exposed the plan as too ambitious.
This occurred unexpectedly in a Queen's Indian Defense, Karpov's favorite opening.


OLD RIVALS BATTLE IN GREEK ELECTION
The banners are furled.
The campaigning is done.
The bullhorns have blessedly fallen silent.
All that remains for Greek voters to do in elections on Sunday is to deliver what the pollsters insist will be one of Europe's most remarkable political resurrections: the revival and reinstatement of Andreas Papandreou.


Davelight Time Works 2 Ways
To the Editor:
I perceive a fatal flaw in the reasoning of the Sept. 26 article "Davelight Savings or Letterman Loss." The analysis depends on the decreased productivity of the seven million "new viewers" CBS claims are now watching television from 11:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. as a result of David Letterman's slot slide.


'Butterfly' Does Not Mince Notes
Puccini's "Madama Butterfly," which is appearing in productions at both the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera this month, inverts the point of a novel that appeared in 1887: Pierre Loti's "Madame Chrysantheme." That tale is also about a naval officer who purchases and marries a Japanese girl named after a delicate organism.
But the infatuation hardly leads to a love duet; instead, the officer comes actively to dislike his wife along with all Japanese (whom he calls monkeys).
Unaffected by his scorn, she appears to love him deeply.
She weeps and wails as he prepares to depart.
But when he returns unexpectedly to his room, he finds that she has not been a helpless innocent trampled in the mud by a Westerner; she counts her money and coolly awaits her next marital contract.
I suspect that this cynical plot would have been less successful than the one Puccini adapted from David Belasco's play.
In "Butterfly," the victim is more innocent, and her triumph more subtle: it is in the tears of listeners who despise Pinkerton, his crudity and his cowardice.
Cio-Cio San's victory is posthumous; it is accomplished through helplessness.


Sacca Found in Arizona
Penn State quarterback JOHN SACCA JR. , relegated to second-string and then removed from the team, has turned up in Arizona after being reported missing by his family.
"He's in good health," JOHN SACCA SR. , Sacca's father, told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette yesterday.
The younger Sacca went to Phoenix to visit his older brother, TONY, a former Penn State quarterback who now plays with the Phoenix Cardinals.


Kmart's Stock Surge Masks a Weakness at the Core
THE Kmart Corporation's stock has been on a roll lately.
Wall Street gave a big hurrah in August when the company announced that it was selling off Payless, its cut-price drugstore chain, which no longer meshes well with its other businesses.
There were even louder cheers when word hit the street soon after that Kmart had hired investment bankers to sell pieces to the public of some of its other specialty-store chains, a move designed to set a market value for the stores that could help buoy the parent's stock.
Kmart shares are up more than 20 percent since June, closing Friday at $24.25.


Charley's Lessons in Leverage: First You Run
"THIS big guy, six-one, 200 pounds, grabs you in a choke hold," says Charley Nelson, a little guy, five-eight, 130 pounds, wrapping his fingers around my neck.
"Whatcha gonna do?"
Depends on the neighborhood, I want to say.
I'll either call a cop or go up to the Bronx and buy a gun.
But Charley has no sense of humor about such things, so I say, "Grab his right sleeve with my left hand, swing my right arm . . ."


Democrats Try Offense as Best Defense
Signaling an unusually combative public posture for the Democrats, the party chairman, David Wilhelm, leveled a sweeping attack today on the gun lobby, the insurance lobby, the anti-tax lobby, the religious right and, of course, the Republican Party.
"The party of Bill Clinton is an aggressive and confident party, willing to confront its foes, ready to respond to attacks quickly and effectively," Mr.
Wilhelm said here at the fall meeting of the Democratic National Committee.
"And let's be very clear: our foes are not limited to members of the other political party; they are the people and institutions who will fight to maintain the status quo."


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
HOLOCAUST-INSPIRED ART
Harold Lewis, an 80-year-old American artist, visited Auschwitz and Warsaw 12 years ago and came away with a burden of dark inspiration.
The motto "Arbeit Macht Frei," meaning work makes you free, inscribed above the gate to the concentration camp, provided an irony that permeates the works he created as a result of that experience.


Seiji Ozawa: 20 Years in Boston, And Still Just Passing Through?
In 1960 Seiji Ozawa was a young fellowship conductor at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Mass., and a finalist for the prestigious Koussevitzky Prize.
Thanks to strong support from two persuasive jury members, the composers Aaron Copland and Leon Kirchner, he won.
"His gifts were enormous, his gestures so revealing of the music," Mr.
Kirchner said recently.
Everyone predicted a brilliant career for him, and by any objective measure, the predictions have come true.
Mr.
Ozawa just began his 20th season as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
At 58, he has enjoyed the longest tenure of any active music director of a major American orchestra.


Republican Faces Stiff Challenge
Andrew S. Eristoff is an incumbent City Councilman, but barely so.
The Republican squeaked by with a slender margin of 57 votes out of 15,000 in a special election in February.
Now, he is considered the most vulnerable of the six Republicans on the 51-member Council, as the runner-up last time around, Jane R. Crotty, a Democrat, challenges him again in the Nov. 2 election.


O.K. Jurors, Recess. On to the Main Event.
The City asked Eric Asimov, who writes the $25 and Under column for The Times, to visit restaurants near the city's courthouses.
Here are his recommendations.
BROOKLYN  GAGE &amp; TOLLNER  (718) 875-5181; 372 Fulton Street, near Smith Street, downtown Brooklyn; all major credit cards
The area around Borough Hall is a field of fast-food restaurants, with stores and offices seemingly just filling the spaces between hamburger stands, pizza places and fried-chicken joints.
Fortunately, Gage &amp; Tollner, the bastion of seafood and Southern cooking, lives on, its dignified face blinking a little awkwardly in the tackiness of Fulton Mall.
The gas lamps for which the dark mahogany dining room is renowned are not lighted at lunchtime, but even under electric lights the restaurant retains its turn-of-the-century patina, with arching mirrors, felt-covered walls and a ceiling that wears the residue of more than 100 years of tobacco smoke.
Office workers, courthouse regulars and politicians are in attendance at lunch, when there is an $18.95 fixed-price three-course meal and quick lunches ranging from $7.95 to $12.95.
Otherwise, lunch can rise into the $25 to $40 range.
This is a chance to sample the peppery she-crab soup, big meaty crab cakes, and a wide variety of fish and shellfish dishes, like pan-roasted clam bellies and fried oysters.
Bourbon pecan pie seems like a perfect (Southern) courthouse dessert, not too sweet, but still as excessive as a good prosecutor's oratory.
QUEEN
(718) 596-5954; 84 Court Street, near Livingston Street, downtown Brooklyn; cash only
For Italian meals of a less nostalgic nature, try Queen, a relative newcomer at 35 years of age.
There is a brightly dowdy, almost middle-American feel to the dining room, with its blond-wood chairs and pastel colors.
The food is a cut more inventive than old-style Italian.
Appetizers are so big that jurors hoping to stay awake for closing arguments can make a meal of a dish like sweet fava beans sauteed in butter and olive oil with earthy cremini mushrooms and tender baby artichokes for $8.
Those planning to nap the afternoon away can indulge in a main course of homemade ravioli stuffed with a savory puree of cannellini beans and tomato in a tart balsamic vinegar sauce for $13.
Service is friendly yet formal.
A waiter supplements the big basket of bread with piping-hot fingers of fried pizza dough tasting faintly of cheese.
THE BRONX Court Deli  (718) 993-1380; 96 East 161st Street, South Bronx; cash only
Bronx Borough Hall looms over 161st Street, as busy a block as any in midtown Manhattan.
But where are the restaurants?
The area has nothing more to offer than a few coffee shops and bars.
"We just had a tuna fish sandwich sent in from a local pizza joint," one courthouse regular said.
"We don't have too many five-star places near the courthouse."
When the courthouse regulars do eat out, many go to the Court Deli, a plain but thriving restaurant across the street with linoleum-tile floors, a crowded takeout counter, and gruff but personable waitresses.
Apart from a thick, lusty split pea soup and the sizzling hot dogs, the food is mediocre, probably no better than at Yankee Stadium down the street.
The overstuffed sandwiches are generous enough, but pastrami is strictly one-dimensional; it spends too much time on the steam table.
But the coffee is good and rich.
QUEENS  PASTRAMI KING  (718) 263-1717; 124-24 Queens Boulevard, at 82d Avenue, Kew Gardens; American Express
Jurors assigned to the Kew Gardens courthouse on Queens Boulevard are culinarily fortunate: mavens know that the boulevard is the home of Pastrami King, a classic New York deli that serves world-class pastrami.
Dim, disheveled and full of Formica, this is a place for raucous family gatherings, where babies squeal and adults complain.
It's also a clubhouse for the courtroom types and politicos.
And it's a place for solitary pleasures, for contemplative chewing of the rich, garlicky pastrami, suffused with an almost vinegary smokiness that comes from 10 to 16 days of soaking and curing over smoldering cedar.
A sandwich is $5.95, and a good-looking, juicy hot dog with sauerkraut is $1.50.
Matzoh ball soup ($2) is thin and pallid.
MAX'S EATERY  (718) 526-9819; 9504 Sutphin Boulevard, at 95th Avenue, Jamaica; cash only
Jurors at the Jamaica courthouse on Sutphin Boulevard are likely to be a rather hostile group, if the availability of food is any gauge.
Simply put, there's not much around.
The most worthy spot within walking distance is Max's, an old-time luncheonette several dilapidated blocks south of the courthouse.
Max's does not look much better than the neighborhood.
Signs are hand-scrawled, the linoleum-tile floors have seen cleaner days, and coffee is served in plastic foam cups rather than in china mugs.
But waitresses call you "Hon," and the polyglot clientele of residents, construction workers and courthouse personnel exudes an aura of good feelings.
The Maxi-Burger is big and juicy, served on a fresh poppy-seed roll and strewn with fried onions ($4.70 with bacon and cheese).
There are also thick sandwiches and egg creams, and Max Rogalski himself, an aged presence, oversees his bustling staff, lunching on two slices of tomato.
STATEN ISLAND  LIL'S EATERY  (718) 273-9555; 95 Stuyvesant Place, at Hamilton Avenue, St.
George; cash only
For Staten Islanders, who serve their jury duty within walking distance of the ferry to Manhattan, the temptation to hop aboard for a lunch trip must be great.
Rather than risk a tardy return, though, jurors tend to restrict themselves to several fast-food spots in the area, or to Lil's Eatery, a small luncheonette decorated with posters that pay charming homage to stars who met tragic ends, like Elvis Presley, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland.
Lil's is a smoky place, with fluorescent lights, Formica tables and an ancient jukebox at each booth, with choices ranging from Bing Crosby to Prince.
The menu doesn't stray far from breakfast dishes, sandwiches and burgers.
An onion-and-pepper omelet ($5.25) was greasy, and pancakes ($4.95) were doughy, but service was friendly and agreeable.
Lil's offers more ambitious specials, like pasta with eggplant for $11.95 and shrimp creole for $12.95.
Given the limited choices in the area, I vote for experimentation.
MANHATTAN  NHA TRANG  (212) 233-5948; 87 Baxter Street, Chinatown; cash only
With Chinatown right next door to the various courthouses, the choices for the Manhattan juror can be paralyzing.
Nha Trang, a plain storefront restaurant with terrific Vietnamese food, stands out.
There's a huge menu of more than 100 dishes.
Some of the best include perfectly fried spring rolls ($3.50); steamed ravioli, rice-noodle crepes wrapped around minced pork and ground mushrooms, served with mild Vietnamese pork sausage ($3.50), and barbecued shrimp on sugar cane ($5.25).
A full meal should cost less than $15.


Financing the Arts On the Backs of Kids
Two Sept. 5 articles ("Federal Grant Goes to Arts Council" and "Open Rehearsals as Prelude to Discovery") speak to an idea that was already seriously questioned when the Ford Foundation began a $230 million-plus foray into the performing arts almost 40 years ago: that arguments based on nonartistic grounds can be used successfully to advance support of the arts.
The educational motive for philanthropic activity in the arts, as proclaimed in the articles, operates in two ways.


Bonn Tries to Calm East Europeans on NATO
The German Defense Minister has sought to reassure East European countries that Bonn still welcomes them in NATO, despite Boris N. Yeltsin's recent signal that he opposes such a move.
But the official, Volker Ruhe, said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had to be reshaped to become inclusive rather than exclusive, and in doing so, should consider the security needs of Russia.
The alliance must not be seen as anti-Russian, he said.


Heroes Didn't Need To Be 'Superheroes'
It is always a thrill to watch astonishing moves by athletes in both victory and defeat.
However after reading about "Niceties at the Hamlet" about the parks given to the tennis players I also know that any sport, like real life, is rooted most deeply in the endorsements for monetary gain.


What Is This Thing Called Baby Film?
THIS summer, my wife and I had a baby, and in doing so we entered the strange land of Baby Pictures.
Taking photographs of your baby is one of the prime duties of being a parent, so I loaded up my camera and got set to play my role in the ritual.
To say that babies are a bonanza for photo companies is something of an understatement.
Getting new parents to buy anything related to babies is about as demanding as dynamiting fish.
According to marketing surveys, new parents -- surprise! -- take twice as many pictures as other people do.
Some manufacturers have even started to name their products for this market.


Memories Of Yaddo

Anent Jean Nathan's piece on Yaddo and its galaxy of guests ("Yaddo," Sept. 19), permit me to offer these remembrances as a former "townie."


Investigators Hunt for the Killer of a Housing Police Officer
A legion of detectives searched yesterday for clues and witnesses to the killing of a housing police officer in Washington Heights, as some residents expressed anger over a towing operation that led to a confrontation between officers and residents just before the slaying on Friday night.
The officer, John Williamson, 25 years old, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center after he was struck on the head by a bucket of spackling compound hurled from the roof of a six-story tenement on West 175th Street, the police said.


Museum of the Americas Opens in Dallas
A new museum that aims to survey the cultural heritage of the New World opened in Dallas on Sept 26.
Situated in a 140,000-square-foot addition to the Dallas Museum of Art, the new Museum of the Americas houses some 4,000 works from North, Central and South America covering the pre-Columbian era through the mid-20th century.
The visitor can view nine display areas, including the ancient Andes gallery, the ancient Mexico and Central American gallery and the native North American gallery.

Kmart's Stock Surge Masks a Weakness at the Core; Working to Keep The Shelves Full
THE trick to making money by selling goods at low prices is pushing a lot of merchandise through the pipeline.
The faster a discounter sells its inventory, the more it pads its slim profit margins.
Wal-Mart, whose savvy management of the flow of goods from manufacturers to consumers woke the retail industry to the value of computerized inventory systems, turns over its inventory about four and a half times a year.
Target's turnover is a little more than four times a year, while Kmart's is about three times.
That helps to explain why Kmart is also in third place on sales per square foot, a key measure of performance.


Making a Mint, Two Pennies At a Time
SUNLIGHT, as Justice Brandeis said, is the best disinfectant.
But it matters just how focused that sunlight is.
The Securities and Exchange Commission took an important step last week when it proposed rules to require that brokerage firms disclose just how much they are raking in from a little-known practice politely called "payment for order flow."


Corrections
Because of a production error, an article on Oct. 3 about French drawings at the Pierpont Morgan Library referred incorrectly to the painter Charles Lebrun.
He was active during the reign of Louis XIV, not Louis XVI.


The Ad Campaign; Giuliani and Women's Issues
On the screen: Donna Hanover Giuliani, the wife of Rudolph W. Giuliani, sits in front of a painting in a room that could be an office or living room.
As she speaks, an image of Mr.
Giuliani, casually dressed and surrounded by parents and children, comes on the screen.
Then the image of Ms.
Giuliani, dressed in a white blouse and blue jacket, returns and the camera pans closer to her until at the end she is being filmed in closeup.
Producer; The Garth Group of New York The Script: Ms.
Giuliani: Let me tell you about my husband's record on women's rights.
In his law practice, Rudy fought for split schedules and extended maternity leave so female lawyers could take care of their families without sacrificing their careers.
As U.S.
Attorney, he prosecuted an abortion clinic bomber who went to jail for seven years.
Rudy helped establish New York City's first on-site childcare center for federal workers and he appointed the first woman in the country to head an Organized Crime Strike Force.
And make no mistake about it, Rudy Giuliani is pro-choice.
Accuracy: Lawyers who would know whether Mr.
Giuliani fought for split schedules as a lawyer in private practice at Patterson, Belknap, Webb &amp; Tyler from 1977 through 1981 could not be reached for comment over the past few days.
But in all other respects the commercial is accurate, though perhaps making Mr.
Giuliani more central to events than he was.
When he was United States Attorney, his office did prosecute the case of Dennis J. Malvasi, an abortion clinic bomber who turned himself in after John Cardinal O'Connor made a televised appeal for him to surrender.
He was sentenced in 1987 to seven years in prison.
His office was also one of about 10 Federal agencies that provided operating funds for Fedkids, a child care center run by a not-for-profit corporation, that opened in 1988 in 26 Federal Plaza.
And Mr.
Giuliani appointed Barbara S. Jones as the first woman in the country to head a federal Organized Crime Strike Force.
Ms.
Giuliani winds up her remarks affirming that her husband believes in abortion rights.
In 1989, he gave several accounts of his position, before saying that while he opposed aboriton personally as a Roman Catholic, he would support and uphold abortion rights as public policy.
Scorecard: The commercial is designed to rebut a commercial by Mayor David N. Dinkins that revives Mr.
Giuliani's 1989 hesitations about abortion.
It presents his wife, known to New Yorkers as an former anchorwoman for WPIX, to make the case that Mr.
Giuliani is a progressive on women's issues.
The subliminal message is that if she married him, he has to be someone to whom professional, independent women can relate.
The question is whether the same women will see Mr.
Giuliani's wife as the best woman to make the case.

Embattled


Bureaucratic Walls Give Visa Couriers Business
Want to get a pet chihuahua into Saudi Arabia?
A business visa to Kazakhstan?
Have to get medical supplies into Gabon?
Oil roughnecks into Ecuador?
Increasingly that means turning to a subculture of travel document couriers here, an eclectic band of graduate students, immigrant entrepreneurs and retirees who hand-carry up to 50 travel documents a day to embassies and shepherd them through the vicissitudes of visa protocol.


For Balanchine, Her Dancing Was A Path to the Future
In the history of every art form, certain figures play a crucial role that goes virtually unsung.
Very little, for example, is known in the West about the Russian ballerina Yelizaveta Gerdt (1891-1975).
And yet as George Balanchine noted emphatically in an interview a few years before his death in 1983, she was the dancer who influenced him most.
Recently I had an illuminating conversation about Gerdt with Vitaly Voulf, a Russian critic who is teaching courses on Russian theater at New York University.
Mr.
Voulf knew Gerdt well from 1948 until her death and was present when Balanchine arrived for dinner at her Moscow apartment in 1962.
The New York City Ballet's co-founder, who left Russia in 1924, had returned for the first time with his company.


Diedre Lawrence, Mark Roberts
Diedre Thalia Lawrence, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Kurt Lawrence of Groton, Conn., was married yesterday in Marblehead, Mass., to Mark Arthur Roberts, a son of Arthur H. Roberts of Houston and the late Marie F. Roberts.
The Rev.
John Potter performed the ceremony at the Old North Congregational Church.
Ms.
Lawrence is keeping her name.
She is an associate at Rubin &amp; Rudman, a law firm in Boston.
She graduated from Mount Holyoke College and received a law degree from Boston University.
Her father is a manager of engineering at the General Dynamics Corporation, the weapons manufacturer, in Groton.


Crimes, Lies and Prudential-Bache
THE champagne flowed freely aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 as a group of Prudential-Bache brokers and their spouses steamed out of New York harbor for a weeklong cruise celebrating another year of big sales and fat commissions.
Their host, Clifton S. Harrison, a Dallas developer who made millions selling real estate partnerships through Prudential's retail network, told them money was no object on the all-expenses-paid trip to London.
They agreed, ordering sumptuous meals not even on the ship's lavish menus.


The Day Civility Died


Ward Gets Advice From an Expert
The connection was made in a place where connections are often missed.
Florida State's basketball team was changing planes in Atlanta last winter.
Doug Williams, who led the Washington Redskins to a Super Bowl championship six seasons ago, stood at a nearby phone booth.
"I heard one of them say, 'Doug Williams,' he remembered. "I said, 'Where are you from?' They said, 'Florida State.' I said, 'Where's Charlie?' "


Amy E. Gelinas, Joseph R. Burke
Amy Elizabeth Gelinas, a daughter of John and Barbara Gelinas of Scarsdale, N.Y., was married there yesterday to Joseph Robert Burke, a son of Robert and Louise Burke of Rockford, Ill.
The ceremony was performed by Msgr.
Edward M. Connors at Immaculate Heart of Mary Roman Catholic Church.
Mrs.
Burke, 28, is a clinical nurse specialist in pediatric oncology at New York University Medical Center in New York.
She graduated from Georgetown University and received a master's degree in pediatric nursing from the University of Pennsylvania.


A New Battle Over Navy Yard
The city has won its long battle to operate a garbage incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but many nearby residents are lining up to contest a new city proposal that would establish a federally financed job training program for youths and adults at the yard's old administrative building at Flushing and Washington Avenues.
Participants would live there during their training, said Albert Wiltshire, president and chief executive officer of the Navy Yard.
"We've been working for two years to come up with a plan for Navy Yard buildings," said Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher, whose district includes Williamburg.
"But without notice, the city decided to carve a piece out of the heart of the site and offer it up for this program. We haven't been briefed. My larger concern is that even if the project has some merits, I'm not sure it helps the communities around the facility, which are in desperate need of housing."


A Matter of Taste
To the Editor:
Since Cadbury Ltd. anticipates marketing A&amp; W brands in Europe ("Cadbury Will Buy A&amp; W," Business Diary, Sept. 12), they are fortunate, indeed, that A&amp; W has diversified since the days when it marketed solely root beer.


Cruise Lines Cater to Kids, From Toddlers to Teens
THE cruise companies see the shape of the future, and it is the baby-boom generation.
American Family Cruises, a new line with an $80 million investment, is directing its sales efforts entirely to families.
Premier Cruise Lines, the nine-year-old Disney-linked operator of the three short-cruise Big Red Boats, is putting an educational twist on its longtime entertainment programs.
Carnival Cruise Lines has augmented its children's programs with a new one for toddlers, and Regency has expanded its children's program aboard the Regent Rainbow into year-round operation.
These and other lines are adding counselor staffs and changing both the names and the content of their attractions.
A look at pamphlets showing kids roller-skating down the deck makes it hard to remember that not too long ago typical shipboard activities revolved around the ring-toss, deck chairs and 11 A.M. bouillon.


Canyon Rafting
To the Editor: On the day you published "Braving a Grand Canyon Hydro-Rodeo" by Aaron Latham, my wife and I left on a six-and-a-half-day raft trip down 186 miles of the Colorado River through the canyon, covering about twice the distance of the Lathams' trip.
Mr.
Latham's experience of hiking down from the south rim to Phantom Ranch in 100-degree heat, and his report of the near-serious injury to one of the party, reflects only one way people can approach a canyon trip.


Yes, It's Improvised. But Is It Really Jazz?
This year's meet the composer grants for jazz ensembles and orchestras have just been announced, and the nearly $80,000 being dispensed is a welcome addition to the generally underfinanced world of jazz.
In 1989, when the New York-based organization devoted to supporting composers and expanding the audience for new music began giving money to jazz composers, it was a fairly radical thing to do.
And the definition of jazz implicit in the grants, like that in much of the jazz community, has been resolutely open-minded; almost any form of improvisation, according to that interpretation, constitutes jazz.
It's a perspective good enough for a living-room discussion, but when it manifests itself in policy it can become problematic, as this year's grants demonstrate.
The Pacific Rim Players, an unrecorded big band from Oregon, received $30,000 and is commissioning Wayne Horvitz, Robin Holcomb and Bob Nell to write pieces for it.
The San Francisco-based Rova Saxophone Quartet will get $24,000 and has commissioned works from Muhal Richard Abrams, Steve Adams (a member of the quartet) and Fred Frith.
And two perennials on the downtown improvisational scene, James Emery and Gerry Hemingway, will share $25,000 to produce music for small ensembles.

Your Own Account/Mary Rowland; Tempests for the Self-Employed
A number of provisions in the new tax law and the proposed health care package could drastically affect the financial picture of the millions of self-employed Americans.
The tax changes are mostly bad news for the self-employed.
"When you size up the winners and losers in the tax package, entrepreneurs land on the losing side," said William G. Brennan, a partner in the Washington office of Ernst &amp; Young.


Science Fiction
In earlier novels like "Grass" and "The Gate to Women's Country," Sheri S. Tepper created imaginary worlds in which actions begat consequences according to rules that were kept hidden from the main characters -- and from the reader as well -- until the end of the story.
At best, this is a risky strategy.
When it succeeds, as in "Grass," it can turn resolution into revelation; when it fails, as in "The Gate to Women's Country," it comes across as a contrivance that reduces everything that preceded it to a long-winded riddle with an arbitrary answer.
In A PLAGUE OF ANGELS (Spectra/Bantam, $21.95) Ms.
Tepper plays the same dangerous game, with a crucial difference.
She strews her narrative with hints that the world she has taken such pains to create is not what it seems.
In some indeterminate future, AIDS-like diseases ravage cities just a few days' walk from "archetypal villages" where capitalized Heroes look after capitalized Orphans, and where capitalized Oracles foresee the future and tell of a legendary past when people traveled to the stars and did not return.


THE LOOK OF THE NINETIES
'The Look of the Nineties" -- I loved it. I once wrote to the Fashion Institute recommending the inclusion of some ordinary people in the "best dressed" list.

In Archers' World, She's the Whizzz Kid
MARGARET ADLER strode past a duffel bag, an old mattress and some straw hats, keeping her eye on the circular target at the back of her family's attic here.
Calculating her score, she pulled six aluminum arrows out of the target and returned them to her quiver, a black leather pouch festooned with lucky charms.
Then, for the second of many times that day, Maggie, as she is known, shot another round of arrows from her practice spot near a bookcase.
This is how one of the highest-ranked young archers in the United States trains for competitions, when she isn't traveling to Connecticut for lessons or crossing the country to shoot in tournaments.
Maggie, a Scarsdale High School junior who competes with girls 15 through 18, is ranked first in the East in outdoor archery and second in indoor archery.

Special Housing Needs Of the Elderly
"Condos for Elderly Tied Up in Politics and Budgets"  [ July 11 ]  was informative but discouraging to seniors in Nassau County, where the older population has increased at an astonishing rate.
During the last 20 years, in the same period that the overall Nassau County population decreased by 9.9 percent, the population aged 60 plus increased by 54 percent.
The need for appropriate and affordable senior housing in Nassau County is critical.
Nassau Senior Forum, a 23-year-old independent nonpartisan organization, deplores the impasse between the Democrats and Republicans on the County Board, which has stalled the construction of the 438 units for the elderly referred to in the article.


Sublime Design
The Wheel.
The Teapot.
The Stradivarius violin.
Some designs are of such obvious beauty and worth that they are destined to last for centuries.
Others lack esthetic appeal but seem sublime because they fulfill so completely the needs of the moment -- how much harder was life before the bendable straw and the paper clip?
But for the individual, what is truly valuable is what inspires passion, and here there's plenty of room for difference.
So, although there's no accounting for taste, we asked 10 design-savvy people to account for theirs.
Their task was to name an everyday object that, in their view, is perfectly designed.
While opinions varied, a few trends emerged: Simplicity is revered more than ornament.
Function is just as important as beauty.
And the Shakers, while they didn't believe in procreation, still have enthusiastic heirs.

A Landmark Manages to Cheat The Wrecking Ball
IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO BE SAID of Los Angeles in the last decade, it is that it has become consistently and continuously more citylike, in both the good and bad senses of that word.
It is a more urban place than it once was, denser and tenser and busier than ever.
Its citizens are less inclined to fool themselves into believing that escape brings freedom from the woes that afflict other cities, less willing to pretend that Los Angeles is as different from other cities as they once thought.
It's against this background of growing urban consciousness that the city's decision to spend $214 million on a library in the middle of its downtown has to be viewed.
This library is not only a place of books but a statement about urbanism, a statement about Los Angeles's increasing willingness to let itself be like other, older cities.
Designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, a New York and Los Angeles firm with what could be called a highly urban sensibility, the project almost didn't happen at all.
That it not only got built but turned out as well as it did is a triumphant moment for both the city's architecture and its history.


Countering a Surge in Vacancies
Faced with the highest vacancy rate in its history, Co-op City has cut its staff and set out to lure buyers, providing low-interest loans, shortening the review process and offering for the first time wall-to-wall carpeting over the parquet floors.
While Co-op City officials said the vacancy rate peaked in July, the number of empty apartments has nearly doubled in the last year, to 1,200.
As with other Mitchell-Lama apartments, owners sell their apartments back to the complex, for equity.
The vacancies have led to concerns over cash shortages at the sprawling, 15,372-unit complex in the northeast Bronx, a 300-acre community with shopping malls, schools, community centers and its own power plant.

You Have to See the Forest, the Trees and the Map to Win
An epic occasion in the Army's basic training program has always been the night map-reading exercise that produced dozens of alleged soldiers stumbling around in the woods utterly lost.
The sport of orienteering can be like that.
But not for those in the World Orienteering Championships in Harriman State Park in New York's Orange County, 50 miles north of Manhattan.
About 250 orienteers, men and women from 34 nations, have assembled there for four days of competition yesterday, today, Tuesday and Thursday.

Would Van Gogh Be Insulted?
To the Editor:
Between them, Paul Goldberger and Michael Kimmelman, in their articles about the new galleries at the Met  [ "The Met Moves Things Around . . ." and "And Everybody Gets His Own Room," Sept. 19 ] , assert that "sumptuous" rooms have had to be created for the paintings because they "seemed minor" in the old home.


Dish to Come Down (Someday)
The satellite antenna that has stood dormant for years atop 10 Columbus Circle is still waiting to be taken down, or brought back to life.
In 1989, when Federal Express vacated the building, the company discovered it would cost about $250,000 to take down its $30,000 rooftop dish, used for fax transmissions.


Reprieve for Two Historic Seaport Buildings
City officials halted the demolition of two landmark buildings in the South Street Seaport Historic District last week when a preservation group offered money to try to save the structures.
Wreckers were preparing to tear down the adjoining brick buildings at 227 and 229 Water Street, which city inspectors had declared safety hazards.
But the work was suspended after the New York Landmarks Conservancy offered to use its emergency fund to pay for repairs to stabilize the vacant, crumbling structures, which date to 1798 and 1801.
The private, nonprofit conservancy promotes the preservation of historic buildings.


Oates's 'Perfectionist'
TOBIAS HARTE may strike you as a nit-picker, an obsessive-compulsive perhaps, and more than a bit of a bore.
But to Joyce Carol Oates, he's a perfectionist, and it's her play.
Let's assume that Ms.
Oates, who is the Roger S. Berlind Distinguished Professor of the Humanities at Princeton University, knows well the sort of rigid academic that Tobias represents.
What is baffling is how in "The Perfectionist," which is having its world-premiere engagement at the McCarter Theater, this extravagantly prolific author chooses to perpetuate a predictable, insulated, suburban, scholarly administrative stereotype rather than locate the elusive human dimension that might make one care about him.


Braves Take B.P. And Go 1 Up
The Phillies may not know all the scientific reasons about how a tidal wave builds momentum and grows in its fury as it picks up speed.
But they have to imagine it's much like the way the Atlanta Braves score runs.
For a second straight game in the National League Championship Series, the Phillies were done in by an offense that has roared with such intensity and speed it left the N.L.
East team gasping for air and looking for a few good arms to stop the onslaught.


Hog Heaven
69 Mott Street (212) 233-5877; 69 Mott Street, at Bayard Street, Chinatown; cash only
69 Mott Street is both the name and the address of a fast-moving, inexpensive family-style place that specializes in pork.
Tender, bite-size chunks of roast pig (as the menu calls it), slightly salty and nutty and served on a bed of rice, makes a wonderful little meal for just $3.
There are also good soups like chicken broth with thin, transparent rice noodles and flowery pork dumplings ($2.50).


Going One Better
At the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, ski jumper OLE GUNNAR FIKJESTOEL , the 1988 world champion, hopes to top the archer who opened the 1992 Summer Olympics with such flair in Barcelona.
At the opening ceremony on Feb. 12, 1994, Fikjestoel will fly off the Lillehammer ski jump holding the Olympic flame.


Albany Officials Fall Behind In Plan to Alter History Lessons
New York education officials are two years behind schedule in their controversial effort to rewrite the state's history curriculum to better reflect the contributions of minorities.
Those involved say they have been hampered by a lack of money and interminable academic arguments within a committee appointed to develop the new curriculum.


Conversations: Phoebe Eng; Publisher Sees Asian-American Identity as a Work in Progress
PHOEBE ENG, the publisher of A. Magazine and a Chinese-American, recalls an experience common in some way to almost every hyphenated American.
During high school, she considered it a great compliment to be told by her Jewish friends that she fit in so well they thought of her as Phoebe Engstein, not really Chinese at all.
Today, she considers that part of the invisibility blues plaguing people of color.
"There is a great dishonesty in pretending that race does not not matter," Ms.
Eng said.
"I really do believe that if you do not acknowledge color or background in social dynamics, be it individual or group-related, you're not acknowledging what's really going on."


THEORY ON MAKEUP OF UNIVERSE GAINS
In their efforts to understand the formation of galaxies and evolution of the universe as a whole, scientists have come to suspect that some unknown, invisible matter almost certainly makes up more than 90 percent of the mass in the universe.
They have a name for it, dark matter, but have yet to identify it.
For more than a decade, the leading theory envisaged a universe full of slow-moving exotic particles, as yet undiscovered, known as cold dark matter.
Some scientists favored hot dark matter, particles that traveled close to the speed of light.
But the universe that astronomers are seeing with greater detail does not seem to fit either model.

His 15 Minutes of Fame Took Only 17 Seconds
Rudy Ruettiger's visit to Santa Monica, Calif., in 1989 promised nothing but a lunch.
Still, he hoped for more as he flew in from South Bend, Ind.
He was certain that when he met the screenwriter Angelo Pizzo, Mr.
Pizzo would feel compelled to write about him, about how his implausible dream -- playing football for Notre Dame University -- came true, for a short yet exciting 17 seconds.
Mr.
Ruettiger waited at the agreed-upon restaurant near Mr.
Pizzo's home, he said, "and he stood me up." He drove around until he spotted a mailman.
"I told him my friend lived around here, but I lost the address," he said.
"He showed me where it was." Mr.
Pizzo answered the insistent knocking on his door only when Mr.
Ruettiger shouted: "It's Rudy! You're late for lunch!"

Brooklyn Got There First
To the Editor:
I would like to correct one historical error in your review of Beaumont New hall's "Focus: Memoirs of a Life in Photography" (Aug. 15).
The reviewer wrote that "in 1940, Newhall . . . became the first curator of MOMA's department of photography, the first such department in any American museum."


How Vintage Trimmings Turned Into Jewelry With Panache
"NO chains on me!" said the jewelry designer Valerie Peyton Horn, modeling a three-strand gold belt, who added devilishly, "These are cord." And punctuating each hip were large, vintage ormolu medallions -- pins actually -- of an intricate design.
Suddenly the belts became a necklace, with an ormolu earring clipped over the strands.
On her wrist Ms.
Horn wrapped a Velcro closure gold-woven ribbon cuff, about two inches wide, and added a brilliant gold Turk's-head bracelet (familiar to most as a Nantucket rope bracelet.) For most of the morning, she delighted in the limitless permutations of her pins, earrings, necklaces, chokers and belts.
Always chic, always high-impact and very rich looking.


Q and A
Turned Down For Refinancing Q. Recently I attempted to refinance the mortgage on our 613-square-foot house on 1.8 acres, which can be claimed as our primary home because of the amount of time we spend there.
I found, however, that it was impossible because most lenders said that there was too little house for the parcel of land.
We could not find any bank -- with one exception -- that would consider refinancing for a home under 850 square feet.
Unfortunately, that lender rejected our application because the home has no central-heating system.
The house is insulated and heated with propane.
Are there any banks that would refinance our mortgage?
There is no problem with credit or equity. . . .

Indian Festival Celebrates the Harvest With a Special Purpose


Young Adults Gain a New Independence in Communal Living
LIKE other young adults who share a house, Julia McDonnell, Annemarie Erickson and Judy Scarcello share the chores, watch television and sometimes go to the mall and the movies together.
But they and the two other women and two young men who also live in an eight-room Colonial on a pleasant street in Yorktown Heights are never completely on their own.
A house manager or staff member is with them 24 hours a day.
The young adults, who moved into the house on June 26, are developmentally disabled.
They were picked to live in the house by the State Developmental Disability Service Office or the county's Community Mental Health Board.


Something Extra
MARRIAGE TO A MAN WITH antecedents in the building trades isn't always easy.
I used to own a summer house I loved in the Catskill Mountains.
When my husband and I were first together, I took him there, full of delight and not a little pride: The house was sited in a beautiful spot, and the interior had a seductive yellow-gold glow that comes from lots of pine paneling.
We drove a thousand miles from Iowa to get there, me burbling the whole way about how much he would love it.
We arrived just at sunset.
The pine paneling was alight, the pond was a glassy platinum steel, the nearer hillsides were an impossibly rich green, which shaded in the distance to a color I think of as Catskill purple.
I was ecstatic.
We walked through the living room, me twirling, Steve contemplative.
Just as I turned to carol, "Isn't this great?" I heard him mutter, "Floor's not level." Inevitably, that house went out of our possession, to be succeeded by a house with level floors, built many sturdy years ago by a man who otherwise specialized in barns.
My husband grew up in a house his father built in 1950.
The walls were brick, the windowsills were marble, the door frames steel.
A family snapshot shows the grid of steel beams laid in to support the first floor, which was concrete.
The only wood in the house was in the kitchen cabinets.
The house was built to withstand fire, flood and tornadoes, as well as the more immediate depredations of seven children -- five boys, including my husband -- and all their friends.
From the outside, however, none of this is obvious.
A modest-looking ranch, it fits into the neighborhood, and when my mother-in-law comes to sell it someday, I don't expect it will bring in much more than her neighbors have gotten for their homes.
But the purchasers will have received something extra -- and not just weight, strength and structural integrity rare in a residence of any sort.


Blowing Smoke In the Air
Freedom Air, named for the freedom it gives smokers to light up on board, flew its inaugural charter trip Sept. 28 from Chicago to Los Angeles, the first flight in what Freedom's operators hope will be a steady business catering to passengers irked by the smoking ban on domestic flights of less than six hours.
Despite advertising and widespread media attention, its trip flight between O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Los Angeles International Airport attracted fewer than 10 paying passengers.
Ted Hall, a recently retired United Airlines pilot who founded Freedom Air and has smoked since he was 14 years old, said he will try to market the service on busy routes like Chicago-Los Angeles because they offer the greatest pool of potential smokers.
The company would give no details on scheduled flights beyond another round-trip flight between Chicago and Los Angeles on Oct. 12.

Reporters Stay a Long-Distance Call Away
WHEN the first Navy Seals slithered onto the Somali beachhead last December, faces streaked with camouflage paint, commando knives at the ready, they were startled to find themselves suddenly awash in television lights, their landing recorded by scores of paunchy journalists waiting on the sand in cut-off jeans and shower clogs.
But last weekend, when an Army Ranger company was decimated raiding a warlord's hideout, losing more than a dozen soldiers killed, scores wounded, two helicopters downed and a relief column ambushed, there were no American reporters in the country.


Too Ill to Learn; Health System Fails to Meet Students' Needs, Educators Say
In a second-grade classroom on the Lower East Side, plaster flakes cascade from an old ceiling when students slam the door.
But it is not the threat of airborne asbestos or the sealed, contaminated rooms that worry educators at Public School 15; it is the students who come to school sick every day.
Some bring along breathing pumps for their asthma.
Some have been exposed to H.I.V.
Some can hardly concentrate because of throbbing toothaches; others cannot see the chalkboard.


No Four-Letter Words
To the Editor:
In her review of "The Morning After," by Katie Roiphe (Sept. 19), Wendy Kaminer suggests that Cosmopolitan was "designed partly as a woman's answer to Playboy." This is not true.
I should know.
I designed the present-day Cosmopolitan.
My Cosmopolitan, from its first issue, has been and continues to be a magazine for young women who love men and children but don't want to be identified solely as wife, girlfriend or mother.


When Serious Moral Issues Are Raised
IT is seldom that audiences have a chance to see a directorial vision at work as clearly as in "Death and the Maiden," which is at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale through Oct. 24.
For anyone familiar with the script or for anyone who saw the Broadway production last year, this is a very different version.
The play, by Ariel Dorfman, ponders serious questions about the role of the individual in society.
Mr.
Dorfman explores issues of law, justice, retribution, forgiveness, remorse and responsibility in a manner that leaves these problems unresolved.


Witch Hazel: An Indian Remedy That Became Big Business
EACH autumn, when frost starts to whiten the fields of Connecticut, what is known as the cooking season gets underway at the E. E. Dickinson Company in Essex.
Trucks piled high with wood twigs and chips arrive at the company and are quickly emptied.
Then their drivers head back to more rural sections of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont to pick up more twigs and chips, thousands of pounds of them, as many as they can cut and deliver to Essex.

Last Chances to Caulk Before Winter's Onslaught
ALL houses eventually need fresh caulking.
The purpose of the compound, often called caulking or caulk, is to seal gaps and cracks that develop between materials.
Unless the openings are sealed drafts can develop.
Even worse, moisture can penetrate walls.
Any season except winter is a good time to renew caulking.
In the winter temperatures are generally too cold to apply caulking.
It flows poorly and will not harden when the thermometer dips below 50.

In Dirty Laundryland
MONDAY was my day to live out an appalling daydream.
It was a daytime television daydream, to be precise.
Maybe you've had it, too: the awful, tempting thought born out of those teasers for infra-dig talk shows.
An announcer cries: "Worshiping the Lord with snakes -- next, Jerry Springer!" (That's a real example.) And you wind up asking your most secret self: "What if I stayed home and watched this stuff all day long?"
So I did.

Report Cites Way to Guard Water Assets
A study whose publication has been blocked by the last two Israeli Governments says that Israel could give up significant portions of the Golan Heights and the West Bank, both captured in 1967, and still protect its access to vital water sources.
But a summary of the research-institute study, printed here on Friday in the newspaper Haaretz, said that regardless of possible territorial concessions, "Israel must do everything to protect the water assets now in its hands."


At Work; Clashing Over AIDS Coverage
THE Allied Services Division Welfare Fund is not a name that trips familiarly off the tongue, but last week the name was on the minds of many people who were wondering what sort of bellwether the fund will turn out to be.
Allied, a health plan insurer for about 20 companies, principally the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, agreed in late September to settle a discrimination complaint by rescinding a decision it had made to limit coverage for AIDS-related diseases.
The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission's Los Angeles regional office, which pursued the complaint under the Americans With Disabilities Act on behalf of two men with AIDS whose coverage dropped to $5,000 from $300,000, declared a victory, not least because the complaint, filed in April, was settled in almost record time.


Conran's-Habitat
The Prince of Chintz has never been known for understated design.
Sending him to Conran's-Habitat - the Valhalla of the pared-down and contemporary look - to shop for living room furnishing might seem like a dare.
He insists not.
"I hate to disillusion you," says Mario Buatta, "but it's a fallacy that I have to have chintz in a room." Nor was the space he worked in steeped in wood-paneled tradition: a new condominium apartment with wide-open views of the Manhattan skyline and Central Park.
In making the room his own, Buatta shopped for the big-ticket items at Conran's, then applied his signature touch: pattern on pattern.
"I try to work the way Mother Nature does, putting together different shapes and textures," he says.
"Think of a forest where there are all theses different colors, lights, textures and even smells, but it's still calm and restful. That's my aim," At Conran's, Buatta made a beeline for sinkably soft furniture to cushion the condo's boxy proportions and for patterned upholstery to give warmth.
To these he added layers of colored fabric and an intriguing miscellany of books, dog prints, objects and plants.
The result is vintage Buatta - but without a stitch of chintz in sight.
The following items are available at Conran's-Habitat stores nationwide.
For the nearest location or to order, call (800) 326-6726. 1.

Business Diary/October 3-8
COMPANIES The Town Wasn't Big Enough for Both of Them  Perhaps it was meant to be.
Perhaps the only way The New York Post could survive was without the Newspaper Guild.
Not even Rupert Murdoch is willing to put up with $14 million-a-year losses in exchange for the joys of blaring sensational headlines at New Yorkers, and the job security demanded by the guild just didn't work with the new Murdoch math.
Nine craft unions came to terms with Mr.
Murdoch in recent months, and their pacts are now in force.
But last week, with the guild broken and The Post in Mr.
Murdoch's pocket, humbled guild members, hats and blue pencils in hand, had to reapply for their old jobs as The Post sought "the best and most aggressive" workers.
True, since many of the 287 guild members will not get those jobs, the glass is half empty.
But Mr.
Murdoch seemed fully prepared to drop the glass on the floor.
A broken glass can never again be half full.

Man Is Arrested in the Killing Of 15-Month-Old Girl in Shelter
A man who was angry because his girlfriend's 15-month-old daughter would not stop crying killed the child by fracturing her skull yesterday at a Bronx shelter for the homeless, the police said.
After the incident, the man, Calvin Salley, 28, took the child, Latisha Lawrence, to the 44th Precinct station house at 1:05 A.M., the police said.
When police officers saw the ashen body of the child in a stroller, they took her to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.


For Louis Tiffany, Lamps Weren't the Half of It
Louis Comfort Tiffany's glorious glass lamps, windows and vases have been known the world over since the turn of the century.
But the colorful Art Nouveau jewelry and enameled objects that he produced during the 30 years he worked at Tiffany &amp; Company have only recently been identified as his designs.
Now, some light is being shed on the subject by "The Jewelry and Enamels of Louis Comfort Tiffany," an exhibition at the Manhattan antiques gallery of J. Mavec Company, through Oct. 23.
The show, which was organized by Janet Zapata, archivist at the Fifth Avenue store from 1985 to 1991, is based on her book of the same title, published this month by Abrams ($39.95).


POLLUTION REMEDY IS HOTLY DEBATED
Angela Days's son Joey nearly died of leukemia 13 years ago.
His struggle to survive transformed Mrs.
Days from a homemaker to something of a rabble-rouser.
Convinced that the boy's cancer was caused in part by pollution, she lobbied successfully to have the chemical-laden Achusnet River placed on the 1982 Federal list of the nation's most toxic hazardous-waste dumps.


Crime Rate Drops by Half
After a year of revamping beats, expanding training courses and beefing up patrols, the private police force in Co-op City reports an overall drop in reported crime of nearly 50 percent.
The man behind these changes is Co-op City's new security director, Gerard Tuomey.
A retired captain from the New York City Police Department, Mr.
Tuomey commanded the mounted patrol unit until May 1992 and took his Co-op City post 14 months ago.

Rain Goddess II
To the Editor: I empathized wholeheartedly with Rachel Billington after having read her "Confessions of a Rain Goddess" (Sept. 5).
I relived the wet, whirlwind backpacking tour of Western Europe my sister and I experienced this summer.
Through 7 countries and 15 cities in four weeks, the rain followed us and the loads on our backs.


Why Farmers Want To Renege on Contracts

A TRUCE IS OFFERED BY SOMALI GENERAL TO U.N.-U.S. FORCES
Robert B. Oakley, the American special envoy to Somalia, arrived in Ethiopia today to start a peace overture by the Clinton Administration as Mohammed Farah Aidid, the fugitive Somali faction leader, called for a cease-fire.
General Aidid, in a broadcast from his radio station in Mogadishu, said his Somali National Alliance would no longer attack United States or United Nations forces if they stopped attacking Somali troops.


Quietly, Term-Limit Measure Seems Likely to Pass
The year 2001 could well mean a new kind of space odyssey for all the New York City officeholders who win election this fall and re-election in four years: They might have to move over to make room for fresh faces.
Despite their efforts to block it, City Council leaders say they now assume that a citizens group's proposed referendum to limit local officials to two consecutive four-year terms will appear on the ballot Nov. 2 and, if recent results around the country are any guide, will pass easily.


Oneida Indians' Casino Permits 18-Year-Olds to Gamble
When the Oneida Indians opened the Turning Stone casino here in July, it was heralded as the first legal casino in New York State since the 1870's.
Few noticed that Turning Stone was also the only casino on the Eastern Seaboard where teen-agers can place bets.
The minimum age for casino gambling in most places, including Atlantic City and the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn., is 21.
At Turning Stone, it is 18.
As a result, the casino, 35 miles east of Syracuse, is quickly catching on with students from two dozen nearby colleges.

Sound Bytes; Taking a Whole Store Home In Your Personal Computer
SAT TARA SINGH KHALSA is chairman of the Info Now Corporation of Boulder, Colo., a company developing ways to use computers to forge direct links between companies and their customers, or between companies, bypassing the middleman.

Frequent Fliers
To the Editor: Readers of the Practical Traveler column on frequent flier programs (Aug. 1) may be interested in my experience in using a "partnership carrier."
In February, while we were in New Zealand, my wife and I planned a trip to Australia.
We wanted to fly from Wellington to Melbourne, take a train to Perth and fly back from Perth to Wellington.
Both Air New Zealand and Qantas could provide that service for about the same fare.
We chose Qantas as it was a partner with American Airlines and we had frequent flier miles with American.


Coffee Bars Find Their Place in the State
FOOD trends seem to move across the country from west to east.
Several years ago we began hearing about Seattle as the unofficial coffee capital of the United States, with scores of shops, cafes and espresso bars where elaborately constructed concoctions were drunk on the premises and coffee beans sold by the bag in various blends and flavors.
We realized it was just a matter of time before the coffee craze would head our way.
Well, here it comes, not in a batten-down-the-hatches tidal wave, but as a trickle.
Little coffee shops, also known as espresso bars, have been sprouting all around Fairfield County in recent months.
In addition to dark, medium, flavored and decaffeinated brews, almost all feature espresso and cappuccino, as well as creations like caffe latte (espresso with a high proportion of steamed milk and layer of foam), caffe mocha (similar to latte with cocoa) and caffe americano (a milder espresso).
Most of the shops also sell the newest coffee-making machines and equipment.

THE NATION: The Picture From the Census Bureau; Poverty 1993: Bigger, Deeper, Younger, Getting Worse
IN 1971, Robert J. Lampman, one of the intellectual architects of the war on poverty, wrote that poverty could be eliminated before 1980, "at which time the next generation will have set new economic and social goals."
His optimism, as he now recalls, was based on historical trends.
From 1961 to 1971, the number of poor people fell by more than one-third, to 25.6 million from 39.6 million.
Many economists shared Mr.
Lampman's belief that, with an active Government and a growing economy, the poverty problem would be "solved in the near future."

Kmart's Stock Surge Masks a Weakness at the Core; Too Little, Too Late for Store Make-Overs?
IN 1990, Kmart embarked on an ambitious plan to overhaul and enlarge its discount stores with an infusion of more than $3 billion, to be spent over an unspecified number of years.
Sounds like a lot, until you consider that Wal-Mart invested that much to renovate and improve fewer stores in the last year alone.
Both Target and Wal-Mart spend a bigger percentage of their revenues on prettying up their stores, a vital element of retailing and one that Kmart neglected until 1990.


A Nobelist Delves Into the Language
In awarding the black American author Toni Morrison its 1993 Prize for Literature last week, the Nobel Committee said "she delves into the language itself, a language she wants to liberate from the fetters of race." In one passage of her novel "Beloved," Baby Suggs, a self-anointed holy woman, preaches for men and women who only recently left slavery:


When the Body Politic Is a Diseased King
There has always been a rich lode of theatricality in illness.
A body is besieged.
The mind fights back.
Sometimes, in the course of the battle, a soul is revealed.
Camille coughs bravely, if melodramatically, and slips into the delicately scented night.
The elephant man shows a society of Victorian thrill-seekers that deformity is only skin deep, while Big Daddy tries to outwit the cancer that is devouring his gut by playing king of the plantation.
Since mortality dogs us all, we watch their writhings in horror and sympathy.
We have a direct stake in the outcome, as we don't, say, in the collapse of empires.
Part of us can't help wondering what we would do under the circumstances.

Mysteries Circle Vietnamese At Center of Brown Inquiry
He rose at an early age to the top of the South Vietnamese Government, but he refused to flee as Saigon fell.
The conquering Communists did not send him to the prison camps where they banished other South Vietnamese officials.
Instead they gave him a comfortable Government post.
For the last few years, he has been living with his family in a four-bedroom, waterfront house on a cul-de-sac in Coral Springs.
His daughter says he has had no job.
His former business partner says that he has been trying to bribe the Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, to help lift the trade embargo against Vietnam.

Making the Journey Back From the Desolation of Head Injury
PEARL LEWIS went to bed a wife, a mother and a teacher.
When she awoke the titles remained, but their meaning had disappeared.
In the middle of the night she had suffered a brain aneurysm.
Much of her memory and other retentive powers were gone.
"I taught math for 25 years," said Mrs.
Lewis, a petite 54-year-old from Dix Hills.
"Now my mind is blank of math. I look at the books I have at home, and nothing means anything."

Palestinians Slay 2 Israeli Hikers; Israelis Kill Suspected Guerrilla
Palestinian gunmen shot and killed two Israeli hikers today near the occupied West Bank town of Jericho, and the Israeli navy foiled a seaborne raid by a heavily armed guerrilla riding a jet ski off the coast of southern Lebanon.
The episodes were the latest in a series of attacks in recent weeks by militants opposed to the agreement signed last month between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on Palestinian self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip.


Clinton Emboldens Advocates of More Pacific Trade
EVEN as it struggles to gain Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Clinton Administration is casting its eyes across the Pacific.
It envisions a gradual dismantling of trade barriers between the United States and Pacific nations and perhaps someday a free trade area similar to that of Nafta.
A Pacific free trade area could bring even more rewards to the American economy than some people expect from Nafta, but might be an even harder sell domestically.

On a First Cruise, Merrily Unwinding
PERHAPS it was sitting at the midnight buffet with Natasha, a former Miss Teen Yukon, as she described the six feet of snow in her backyard.
Maybe it was attending the passenger talent show, when a lawyer from Scotland sang "Jamaica Farewell" and four petite Taiwanese women lifted the less-than-petite Australian cruise director high into the air.
Possibly it was just relaxing on deck late in the evening under a full moon, holding hands with my wife, Ruth, and listening to the reggae beat of a Caribbean band.
Whatever the reason, early on in my weeklong cruise of the western Caribbean in July, I decided that a floating vacation, of which this was my first, was a perfect way to put aside, however briefly, the tensions of work and city life -- to unwind, and to enjoy.


Oct. 3-9: House Republicans Reshuffle; Bipartisan Bob Bows Out, Nettlesome Newt Is Next
Only one Republican has ever served longer in the House of Representatives than Bob Michel of Illinois, the minority leader.
When he announced Monday that his 19th term would be his last, he was praised by President Clinton and Speaker Thomas S. Foley for having supported Republican Presidents, right or wrong, and Democratic Presidents, if he could.
His all-but-certain successor, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, does not look at things that way.
He fought President Bush over the 1990 budget and he fights Mr.
Clinton over almost everything.
Known for attacking his opponents' integrity, he insisted when he announced his candidacy Thursday that he was not so much a "bomb thrower," as a "truth thrower." In fact, most of those he accused were guilty of something.
So were some he did not accuse, like Mr.
Gingrich himself.
He urged younger members to raise the devil over the House bank; it turned out he once paid his income taxes with a bounce-proof overdraft on that institution.


Stevens Muscles Devils Over Washington
With Jacques Lemaire being a defense-oriented coach, Scott Stevens is the Devils defenseman likely to thrive the most this season.

Subdivisions for Houston's Ghostly Business Parks
WHEN Julie and Michael Marczak bought a home in a new subdivision in northwest Houston last year, they didn't think of themselves as pioneers.
But they were among the first home buyers in one of several new residential communities sprouting up around Houston in underdeveloped business parks.
The Marczaks -- he is an electrical engineer, she an elementary school music teacher -- said location was a top priority when they began house-hunting last year.

A letter to the editor on Sept. 26 from Francis X.

Here's How the Show Really Goes On
OH, sure, the show must go on.
This is the prime Broadway directive.
But how?
The house lights dim, the curtain goes up.
Actors appear, sets change, doorbells ring on stage.
The illusion is that it all happens effortlessly.
By magic.
Right.
The reality is that someone must make the show go on.
More than 50 someones, in the case of "She Loves Me," the Jerry Bock-Sheldon Harnick-Joe Masterson musical that began its Broadway run on Thursday at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, where it moved after rave reviews at the Roundabout Theater Company.
With quick costume and scene changes on a revolving turntable and with a cast of 19, it is one of Broadway's most complicated demonstrations of backstage choreography.

Indomitable Agnes de Mille
Several years after a devastating cerebral hemorrhage in 1975, the choreographer Agnes de Mille supervised a new production of her famous "Rodeo." Just before Miss de Mille, who died last week at 88, arrived in a wheelchair pushed by an attendant to view a rehearsal, her assistant said, "She won't like it."
He was right.
"She recast it," recalls a young dancer who appeared in the ballet.
"And I remember how she had us, droves of us, running across the stage again and again until we got it right. She worked on our gestures, simple, human gestures, endlessly. What a presence! Yet she herself could only move one arm, and could scarcely speak clearly."

Tailhook Gathering Is a Far Cry From the Last One
Beauty queens preparing for the Mrs.

But this was a far different gathering from the notorious 1991 Tailhook event, a four-day bacchanal in Las Vegas, Nev., that ended careers, ruined reputations and led the Navy to withdraw its support from the 1,400-member aviators' association.

Familiar Rutgers Story: Can't Beat the Big Boys
A wonderful opportunity to make a mark in Big East football went right by Rutgers today.
The Scarlet Knights, who seem to take two steps forward and then one step back season after season, held a 14-3 lead over Boston College early in the contest but then succumbed, 31-21.
Darnell Campbell, the runner, and Glenn Foley, the passer, provided the punch for Boston College that knocked Rutgers out of any serious consideration as a Big East contender, a possible top 25 team or even a bowl candidate.

Last Chances to Caulk Before Winter's Onslaught
ALL houses eventually need fresh caulking.
The purpose of the compound, often called caulking or caulk, is to seal gaps and cracks that develop between materials.
Unless the openings are sealed drafts can develop.
Even worse, moisture can penetrate walls.
Any season except winter is a good time to renew caulking.
In the winter temperatures are generally too cold to apply caulking.
It flows poorly and will not harden when the thermometer dips below 50.

Let Medicare Carry New Plan Piggyback
To the Editor:
Stuart M. Butler's suggestion that the Federal employees health program be the basis for a national program (Op-Ed, Sept. 28) is good.
However, there is a better and simpler one: base any program on Medicare.
It is national, it is here, and it works.


Now For Russia's Biggest Job: A New Government
With the vicious battle for supremacy between the executive and legislative branches resolved in fire and blood, Russian analysts and Western diplomats agree that a real revolution may now begin, bringing with it fundamental changes in the way Russia is governed.
The most recent warfare between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Parliament was all about unfinished business from the failed putsch of August 1991.
It sealed the end of the Soviet Union four months later, but it left the fundamentals of the political system almost unaltered.
"The Second Russian Revolution," as it was called, was foreshortened and incomplete: the ruling class received a nasty shock, but remained in place.


Invisible Investments
MY HUSBAND thought me quite mad two years ago when I spent the first two weeks in our new apartment unpacking nothing and agonizing instead over structural minutiae: scraping paint flecks off bathroom tile, persuading carpenters to use plaster instead of wallboard in closets, making sure all the doorknob screws matched.
I have since convinced my husband that my obsession with perfect backdrops places me in a long and noble continuum.
The architect Vitruvius, for example, wrote in the first century B.C. that thoughtful craftsmanship gives a structure "strength and brilliancy, and an excellence that will last to a great age." The 19th-century critic John Ruskin believed that "thoroughness in the substance" must precede all architectural ornament.
And today, craftsmen with philosophical tendencies might find, as James Boorstein of the Manhattan-based restoration firm Traditional Line puts it, that rooms in which strict attention has been paid to detail have an almost tangible ambiance.
"You can feel a powerful sense of presence," he says, "something inside that's satisfying and that can't be put into words."

Jane deDoliete Kidd, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Barron U. Kidd of Dallas, was married there yesterday to Mark D. Eichorn, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Ronald Eichorn of New Haven.
The Rev.
Stephen Swann performed the Episcopal ceremony at the Church of the Incarnation.
Mrs.
Eichorn, 28, is known as Liete.
She is a publicity agent and the editor of the auction newsletter at Christie's in New York.
She graduated from the University of Virginia and received a master's degree in English literature from New York University.
Her father owns Kidd Oil and Gas, an exploration and production company in Dallas.
Her grandfather the late Pierre S. du Pont 3d was an executive at the Du Pont Company.


Public &amp; Private; Our Radical, Ourselves
The smart scholarship girl from a sheltered environment whose self-image goes south in the polyglot and high-pressure world of college is a staple, of modern fiction and of life.
I know her.
I was her.
And that is why I recognized Katherine Ann Power when she turned herself in and was sent to jail, understood how it was possible in four years to go from the valedictorian of a Catholic girls school to a campus radical who drove the getaway car in a 1970 bank robbery.


THE UNITED STATES OF ASYLUM
Just what this country needs ("The United States of Asylum," by Ted Conover, Sept. 19)!
We already have sexual harassment, misogyny galore, discrimination in the workplace, in religious institutions, in the military, etc., etc.
Now we're going to import more?
Dong Yishen, a refugee from China who came to this country aboard the Golden Venture, says, "In China we really want to have a son." (He had already fathered two girls.)


'The Deadly Game': A Twisted Mock Trial
THE Rainbow Theater is upscaling by downsizing.
With its move from a theater at Norwalk Community-Technical College that holds more than twice as many people as its new home -- the Leonhardt Studio at the Rich Forum, a black-box space with a capacity of 120 -- the six-year-old company is now right in the hub of theater life in Fairfield County.
But there's no sign of it in "The Deadly Game," which was adapted by James Yaffe from "Trapps," a novel by Friedrich Duerrenmatt.
The story was once seen on the Alfred Hitchcock television series.


Cutting? Trim All Sides Evenly
IF companies want to pare away at health insurance costs, the easiest way to do it and avoid a discrimination complaint is to make sure the cuts have a comparable impact on everyone involved.
"There are nondiscriminatory ways to save money, if that's the motivation," said Cary LaSheen, a lawyer at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest.
Ms.
LaSheen is working on behalf of defendants in the next critical A.D.A.-AIDS case, a suit filed by the Mason Tenders District Council Trust Fund in New York to have its AIDS exclusion declared lawful.


A Theme Park Of Itself
To the Editor:
Jean Baudrillard, it seems, is finally right: we live in a culture of the simulacrum.
Robert A. M. Stern, Tibor (Benetton) Kalman and company are about to turn Times Square (certainly one of the last of the "real" places) into a theme park of itself  [ "42d Street Plan: Be Bold or Begone!," Sept. 19 ] .


Mr. Clinton's Dark Night
President Clinton hasn't found the time to speak out publicly as House Democrats toy with ways to weaken his proposed campaign finance reform legislation.
But he did manage to squeeze in an appearance last week at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's $1,500-a-plate fund-raising dinner.
It was a sneak appearance in the truest sense.
To avoid embarrassing pictures of the populist-sounding President hobnobbing with lobbyists and the other influential high-rollers who populated most of the tables at the black-tie event, the White House took an extraordinary step.
It barred reporters, photographers and camera crews from the room.


Waffles Aren't Just for Breakfast Anymore
RECENTLY, my husband and I bought an old house in northwestern Connecticut, one of those buildings laughingly described as "needing work." Among the things left behind by the previous owners was a gleaming Art Deco waffle iron.
I had never made waffles before, so being the mother of a 5-year-old, it seemed a good time to learn.
In the back of a cupboard I discovered a mildewed cookbook missing its cover and first few pages.
It looked as though it dated back to the 1940's, and in it I found a recipe for waffles.
The previous afternoon my son and I had picked apples and raspberries in a local orchard, so I decided to add those to the recipe, and in the interests of health, I cut down the butter and used skim instead of whole milk.


25 Seasons Ago, Namath Was a Star, but 'Heidi' Ruled the Airwaves
In this 25th anniversary of the Jets' most glorious season, they may be reminded today of their most notorious loss.
They will visit the Raiders, the team that helped them define 1968 and linked them forever to the "Heidi" game.
There was the Super Bowl championship, of course, after the 1968 season.
There also was a game on Nov. 17, 1968, when the Jets and Raiders played a regular-season contest that was to be overshadowed by the children's story.


THE KILLER FROM CULIACAN
Leerhsen describes Chavez as "square, handsome, the classic Mexican mixture of Spanish, European and Indian influences." I believe your writer is referring to the mestizo, the predominant Mexican mixture of Indian and Spanish, not Spanish, European and Indian.
The Spanish are European.
I have noticed a puzzling increase in defining Spanish as non-European or non-Caucasian.

Elena Zazanis, Yannis Moutafidis
Elena George Zazanis, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
George A. Zazanis of New Vernon, N.J., was married yesterday to Yannis Pantelis Moutafidis, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Pantelis I. Moutafidis of Athens.
The Rev.
Basil Gregory performed the Greek Orthodox ceremony at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in New York.
Ms.
Zazanis, 28, is keeping her name.
She is a doctoral candidate in developmental psychology at the City University of New York Graduate Center.
She graduated cum laude from Wellesley College.
Her father is the chief of neurosurgery and a professor of neurosurgery at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J.
Her mother, Marina P. Zazanis, is the president and chief executive of Neogenix Inc., a biotechnology research and development company in Cedar Knolls, N.J.


Studies Find Benefits of Subsidies are Meager
Supporters of the Agriculture Department's export subsidies say the programs opened new markets for American farm products and helped preserve old markets in the face of large European subsidies.
But trade statistics and Government reports, including the Agriculture Department's own studies, provide little evidence that the programs have helped American exports substantially.


Towns Want Help To Replenish Shellfish
FOR 20 years Long Island Oyster Farms of Northport grew shellfish eggs, or "seeds," to help replenish the dwindling shellfish population using the warm water discharged into a lagoon at the Long Island Lighting Company plant at Northport as a giant incubator.
Since 1969 hundreds of millions of seeds have been transplanted into Long Island waterways.
But an electrical fire in 1991 destroyed the nurseries of Oyster Farms and six smaller companies.


Appeasing Hitler
To the Editor:
"Morally sickening" is the fitting epithet that your reviewer, Gaddis Smith, applies to John Charmley's pathological reasoning in "Churchill: The End of Glory" (Aug. 29).


Enlisting Churches to Battle AIDS
Five years ago, Pernessa Seele began sitting in churches all day Sunday so she could catch a moment with their pastors.
Back then, few Harlem ministers were willing to admit even that congregation members could become infected with the AIDS virus, much less discuss ways to help ease their pain.
But Ms.
Seele persevered, soliciting support for a small event she called the Harlem Week of Prayer for the Healing of AIDS.
"I didn't see people from the churches near the bedsides of the sick," said Ms.
Seele, then an administrator at Harlem Hospital.


MISSION IN SOMALIA IS TO SECURE CITY
The American command hopes to use the armor and infantry units now reinforcing the Somali capital to evict heavily armed Somali militia forces that have surrounded allied bases in downtown Mogadishu.
The militia members, loyal to Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, also control all the main roads.
In the last week, they have used their positions to kill and wound American soldiers by laying mines in the roads and shelling the bases with mortars.


Mall Evolution
THOSE who've seen it are calling it, variously, "Pee-wee meets Blade Runner" or "Russian Constructivism meets Virtual Reality."
Whatever.
What was once the ground floor of a Macy's warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, is now a mall that's a walk-in interactive sculpture.
In 1991, the Corporate Life Insurance Company and SIG Partners, the owners of 47-44 31st Street -- a million-square-foot structure, the largest in Queens -- gave three sculptors the run of its public spaces.


Eritrean Criticizes America's Strategy On Crisis in Somalia
The President of Eritrea, one of several regional leaders the Clinton Administration has asked to help negotiate a political settlement in Somalia, said today that the United States has behaved "like Rambo" thus far and has misread the intricacies of Somali clan politics.
In an interview, Isaias Afewerki also urged Washington to build new ties to the fugitive Somali leader, General Mohammed Farah Aidid, and called for an "impartial commission" to investigate accusations that he committed war crimes.


Testing Workers for Drugs Reduces Company Problems
Back in the mid-1980's, Daniel Burke worried about the growing national drug problem and whether his children might be tempted to experiment.
But he never thought of drugs as a problem for his company until an employee in New York City died of a cocaine overdose in an office stairwell.
"It turned out this guy had been dealing, too," said Mr.
Burke, the president of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
"And a great number of our employees knew it."


Jerusalem Hotel
To the Editor: In "What's Doing in Jerusalem" (Sept. 5), Clyde Haberman was right to rave about the American Colony Hotel, whose physical beauty and historic appeal are very alluring.
But based on an experience we had two years ago, those reserving there should be sure to get a room in the old building.
A newer building has rooms that are infinitely less charming than the main building; indeed, they're rather lifeless.
We had specified the old building, got a room in the new building, didn't like it, and successfully insisted on a room in the old building.
There's no comparison.
DAN HARRISON  Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
Clyde Haberman responds: While rooms in the new wing may lack the grace of those in the old, some visitors consider them to be more comfortable and also quieter.
The morning call to prayer from the loudspeakers of the nearby mosque is charming.
But not everyone can catch the spirit at 4:30 A.M., and the new wing provides enough distance for those preferring muffled muezzins.


Is That Really South Africa?
Maybe one day Hollywood will make a movie set in South Africa that features some of the following:
* An Afrikaner leader who repudiates apartheid.


IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: The Food Chain; Pesticide Plan Could Uproot U.S. Farming
GRAIN combines, vegetable harvesters, and tractors towing loads of fruit boxes are on the move this month as the nation's vast agricultural bounty is brought in from the fields.
But even as farmers try to focus on keeping their machines straight in the furrows and orchards, their eyes are nervously straying towards Washington.
Last month, three senior Administration officials trooped to Capitol Hill and said the White House was thinking about a change in pesticide policy that would drastically alter practices in food production, the nation's second largest industry. (The largest is health care, which the Administration also has its eyes on.)


Gloria von Oiste, Romulo Perez-Segnini
Gloria Da Silva von Oiste, a daughter of James and Aida von Oiste of Belle Terre, L.I., was married yesterday to Romulo Perez-Segnini, a son of Ambassador and Mrs.
Ildegar Perez-Segnini of Caracas, Venezuela.
The Rev.
Donald Brouillard performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at St.
Francis Xavier Church in New York.
Mrs.
Perez-Segnini, 30, is the assistant director of the art therapy program at Kings County Hospital-Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.
She graduated from Indiana University and received a master's degree in art therapy from New York University.
Her father is a lawyer in Port Jefferson, L.I., and her mother is a lawyer in Smithtown, L.I.


Croatia: The Once and Future Battleground?
AS the war in Bosnia grinds mercilessly on, diplomats and military planners are worrying that the Balkan-shattering conflict that pre-dated it -- the war in Croatia -- is about to erupt again.
"If anything, the situation here is today, in some ways, even more dangerous than that in Bosnia and Herzegovina," Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief of the United Nations force in the Balkans, said recently.
"One would be very myopic to fail to see and warn about the gathering clouds of war. It will need a major focused effort by the international community, and a real will for peace, if a second Serbo-Croat conflict is to be averted."


World Markets; Rice Trading Rises, but Will It Last?
WITH harvest shortfalls developing in many leading rice-growing countries, prices for the world's second-most-popular food after wheat have jumped rapidly in recent weeks to their highest level since the late 1980's.
Just where prices are headed is hard to say because so little of the rice grown enters into the flow of world trade.


POSTINGS: Brownstoners as Guides; Tour and a Workshop In Bedford-Stuyvesant
A combination of the neighborhoods of Bedford and Stuyvesant Heights, the name Bedford-Stuyvesant was created by the Brooklyn Edison Company in an early 1930's survey.
It has long been known for its blocks of beautiful town houses, and Saturday from noon to 5 P.M. the Brownstoners of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a nonprofit organization, will run its 16th annual house tour.


Racial Jokes Spur Apology From Friars
The head of the New York Friars Club apologized yesterday for racial jokes made on Friday at a celebrity roast of Whoopi Goldberg.
Mayor David N. Dinkins and others had criticized the roast, at which the actress's companion, Ted Danson, appeared in blackface for a routine and frequently used the word "nigger."
"While raucous and X-rated humor are usually the tradition of these annual events, they are never intended to ridicule or disparage any segment of our society," Jack L. Green, the dean of the New York Friars Club, said in a statement released yesterday.


Purdue Scores 56, and Loses
Scott Eckers capped a spectacular first collegiate start with a 55-yard pass to Antonio Carter that set up Mike Chalberg's 18-yard field goal with 8 seconds left, helping Minnesota to a record-setting 59-56 Big Ten victory over Purdue at Minneapolis last night.
The 56 points by Purdue (1-4, 0-2 Big Ten) was the most ever in a losing effort for a major-college team.
San Diego State previously held the mark, losing 52-51 to Wyoming in 1990.


If You're Thinking of Living In/Noroton and Noroton Heights; A Sailor's Heaven Where Darien Began
WHEN supplying phone numbers, Information does not recognize Noroton, nor does the post office deliver Noroton mail separately from Darien's, as it once did.
Real estate agents regard Noroton and Noroton Heights as neighborhoods in Darien, which they are, and so do newcomers.
But the old-timers of English, Irish, Italian, German and Hungarian stock, some living in the same houses their forebears occupied three to five generations ago occupied, cling to Noroton and the Heights as special -- the place where Darien, the smallest town on Fairfield County's Gold Coast, began.


Nursing Becomes A Feminist Battlefield
CALL them the guerrillas of the breast-feeding wars.
They appear at hospitals, nutrition conferences, and in countless child-care books with a simple proviso: breast milk is the best milk.
The subtext read by many mothers, however, goes more like this: if you do not breast-feed your children, you are not a good mother.
And as they are compelled to worry whether they are being good mothers, women are asked to consider whether they are being good feminists.
Some activist feminists insist that breast-feeding is just another male trick to keep women at home.
Others insist that it is a way for women to regain control over their bodies, showing men that breasts are more than just sex objects.


Old Friends
DAISY FUENTES, 26, the MTV personality and soap opera actress who recently signed a multiyear international contract with Revlon, has the kind of friends who know how to keep a rising superstarlet's feet on the ground.
In fact, there are so many of them that she could lend them out as a grounding service.
On Monday, Ms.
Fuentes, who was born in Cuba and grew up in Harrison, N.J., was in the V.I.P. area of Dish, a new Upper West Side restaurant she co-owns.
Surrounded by the unpretentious people who knew her when she was her high school's first Hispanic homecoming queen, she seemed more at home in their company than with the snooty-looking models and trend-eaters who were drinking for free nearby.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
THE WAY TO COOK.
By Julia Child.
Photographs by Brian Leatart and Jim Scherer.
Knopf, $30.
This is not your usual paperback price, but this is not your usual paperback volume.
In 1989 our reviewer, Richard Flaste, found the book "so large (more than 800 recipes), colorful and exuberant that it seems to be an almost living representative of Mrs. Child herself."  DOCTOR CRIMINALE By Malcolm Bradbury.
Penguin, $11.
It's the end of the century, the world as we know it is falling apart, and all intellectuals seem capable of doing is commenting on those facts.
Bazlo Criminale, a with-it philosopher, can deconstruct with the best of them -- if only the narrator, a harried journalist, could pin him down.
"It is greatly to Mr. Bradbury's credit that a work showing how skim milk tends to masquerade as cream is itself the real thing, creme de la creme de la creme," Joel Conarroe said here last year.
Current events, treated more somberly, are also the backdrop for THE PORCUPINE, by Julian Barnes (Vintage International, $9), in which the scions of a Communist regime become the less-than-totally-principled avengers bringing it to its knees.
Last year our reviewer, Robert Stone, said the book "brings to mind . . . Andre Malraux, George Orwell and particularly the Arthur Koestler of 'Darkness at Noon.' "


Developer Taking Over Former Macy's Property
A DEVELOPER who has built more than 50 community shopping centers in the Northeast agreed to purchase the former Macy's department store here this month and revitalize the surrounding 600,000-square-foot mall.
Bernard J. Rosenshein, president of Rosenshein Associates in New Rochelle, said he will build a 14-screen, 3,500-seat movie theater on the third floor of the building that Macy's vacated last summer -- bringing to this city, which has several old movie marquees outside buildings but no active movie theaters, the largest multiplex in Westchester.

Some of the City's Schools Opened Right on Time
To the Editor:
Some were bright-eyed and smiling, others a little teary, as they bid their mothers goodbye outside the Epiphany School on East 22d Street on opening day, Sept. 8.
But there were none of the customary back-to-school pictures on the evening television news nor in the next day's newspapers.
Nothing but closed public schools and their asbestos problems.
There were no pictures or news stories about the 145,000 black, Hispanic and white kids going into their certifiably clean parochial schools in the South Bronx, Harlem, the Lower East Side, Brooklyn and Queens and here at the Epiphany School.


Last Chances to Caulk Before Winter's Onslaught
ALL houses eventually need fresh caulking.
The purpose of the compound, often called caulking or caulk, is to seal gaps and cracks that develop between materials.
Unless the openings are sealed drafts can develop.
Even worse, moisture can penetrate walls.
Any season except winter is a good time to renew caulking.
In the winter temperatures are generally too cold to apply caulking.
It flows poorly and will not harden when the thermometer dips below 50.


Beyond Foley Square: Acting Like a Tourist Close to Home; The Bronx
Forget everything -- well, almost everything -- you may have ever heard or read about the lurking dangers of the South Bronx if you find yourself assigned to jury duty there behind the imposing limestone walls of the Bronx County Building.
Granted, several side streets near the 60-year-old building, like Walton and Sheridan Avenues, are often busy with illicit drug deals, police officers say.
"But it's good if you stay around the courthouse and the Grand Concourse," advised an officer assigned to the densely packed neighborhood that spills back from the shadow of Yankee Stadium.


A Playwright-Actress Puts Herself on Stage In Fact and Fiction
Catherine Butterfield is at it again, "Doing the Moliere thing," she says with a laugh, acting a major role in a play that she's written.
This can get confusing.
Rewriting lines during rehearsals, she has to go about memorizing them.
"I can't very well be angry at the playwright," she says.
Ms.
Butterfield won critical praise for both her writing and performance in "Joined at the Head" last year at the Manhattan Theater Club, when she played a long-suffering cancer patient with a persistent comic sense.
The play explored powerful emotions of loss and focused on a relationship between Maggy-with- a-y, who is dying, and Maggie-with-an-ie, the former girlfriend of Maggy's husband.


Bulletin From the Great Fish-Window Wars
Citarella, the Broadway fish store whose elaborate window displays of fish-flesh mosaics have drawn customers for almost a decade, seems to have some artful competition.
Fourteen blocks uptown, between 89th and 90th Streets, the ice tank in the window of Jake's Fish Market, a two-year-old challenger in high-priced, high-quality fish, holds its own carefully designed still life of the catch of the day.


Tanker Aground Near Greece
The Greek-owned oil tanker Iliad ran aground off the Peloponnes today and started to spill its cargo of crude oil, a Greek coast guard spokesman said.
An oil slick three miles long and about 30 yards wide spread from the tanker, stuck off the island of Sfakteria, the spokesman said.
He said cleanup vessels were on the scene.
The Iliad was on its way from Syria to the Croatian port of Rijeka when it ran aground.


Mondo Cane
You arrive at the house, and when you ring the bell the chime becomes a howl.
A manservant answers the door, a Groucho Marx look-alike who says, in mockery of the archetypal British butler, "You screamed?".
You're in the world, or at least the home, of Dylan Dog, comic-book antihero, pursuer of ghoulish phenomena, and best-kept secret of the Italian cult world.

Take your pick: Bill and Hillary, John Jr. and Darryl, or Lois and Clark, from ABC's new Superman series.
ATTITUDES: The age of age: "Beauty Isn't About Looking Young" read posters plastered around Manhattan by Clinique.
The message is a radical and revisionist twist on the business of beauty, and one that nicely echoes the thesis of Betty Friedan's new book, "The Fountain of Age."


Kmart's Stock Surge Masks a Weakness at the Core; After Years of Bloated Overhead, It's Time to Get Lean and Mean
KMART's overhead -- what it spends on payroll, utilities and other operating expenses but not the cost of the goods it sells -- is much higher than Wal-Mart's.
Analysts estimate that Kmart spends about 22.5 cents of every dollar of sales in its discount stores on overhead, while Wal-Mart spends about 17.5 cents.
That means Wal-Mart can offer its customers lower prices on merchandise, which gives it a tremendous edge.

A Tiepolo Transplant in Texas -- and It Takes
If so inclined, you could measure the great frescoes of Giambattista Tiepolo in acres.
His decoration of the ceiling above the grand staircase at the Residenz in Wurzburg, Germany, his crowning achievement and one of the cornerstones of 18th-century art, has been called the biggest painting in the world. (For the record, Guinness gives the honor to a 300,000-square-foot mural covering the side of a condominium in Key Biscayne, Fla.)
It's a paradox, then, that Texas, of all places, where hats are measured in gallons and ranches are the size of Rhode Island, should play host to an exhibition of Tiepolo's smallest paintings.
About 60 diminutive works have been brought together here at the Kimbell Art Museum in a beautiful show called "Giambattista Tiepolo: Master of the Oil Sketch." (The exhibition, on view through Dec. 12, will not travel.)


U. S. Pays Dearly For an Education In Somalia
HOW did an operation that began with American soldiers feeding starving Somalis wind up with an American soldier's corpse being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by Somalis starving only for revenge?
The answer is a tangled web of good intentions gone awry, political miscalculations and military blunders.
Together they add up to a chilling object lesson for American engagement abroad in the post-cold war world.

My thanks to Rachel Cline for coining the phrase, "the sin of Conan" (Hers: "Conan and Me," Sept. 5).
Not only was the piece funny, I finally have a name for my affliction.
For most of my adult life, I've suffered from the condition of not being able to talk about the only interesting things I've ever done without what seems to be the flagrant dropping of names.


Seesaw Stops, and the Improbable Sox Are Even
So Frank Thomas finally hit a home run, and the Chicago White Sox won the game and evened the American League pennant playoff with Toronto at two games each.
But the White Sox did not beat the Blue Jays, 7-4, tonight because Thomas hit a mere bases-empty home run.
The White Sox insured at least one more game in their home park because Lance Johnson did the expected and the unexpected, the probable and the improbable.


Beethoven, in Recital And Symphonic Works
TO play the Beethoven String Quartets is a challenge that has been undertaken by the Tokyo Quartet, and for the second of the group's six recitals at Sprague Memorial Hall, you can hear one masterwork from each of the composer's major creative periods, the C Minor, Op. 18 No. 4, the Opus 74 in E Flat, and the C-Sharp Minor, Op. 131.
The 8 P.M.
Tuesday concert is part of the Chamber Music Society at Yale season; for ticket information, call 432-4158.
Friends of Music has come up with a fascinatingly different way of presenting the Beethoven Quartets: in five concerts by as many different ensembles.
Thus the first program, 8:30 P.M.
Saturday at the Westport Unitarian Church, finds the Alexander String Quartet tackling four Quartets: No. 2 and No. 5 from the Op. 18 set, the second Razoumovsky, and the Opus 127.
In November the Ying Quartet will perform, while taking their turns in the spring are the Talich from the Czech Republic, Ysaye from France and Fine Arts from the United States.


The Grand Old Fun Park in Its Autumn: a Lament
It's high noon at Coney Island, and for once the gulls and pigeons outnumber the humans.
In fact, the birds seem to be the only ones bathing, as a flock of dingy gray gulls dip their beaks and flap their wings into a puddle off the boardwalk and waddle off to face the autumn sun.
The wide wooden boardwalk, which a few months ago was a teeming maze of families, tourists, hawkers and photographers, is now a lazy route for bicyclists who glide by, right past the signs that say riding is allowed only from 5 to 10 in the morning.
On some benches, people chat quietly as they face the beach, where a few hardy sun worshippers stretch out on the sand, which has been packed hard by rain.

Raghib (Rocket) Ismail calls his quarterback "dude." He does not yet fully comprehend the Los Angeles Raiders' offensive language, and the Raiders cannot even begin to decipher his.
The day the former prodigy Todd Marinovich was waived, for instance, Ismail's bug-eyed response was, "Holy commotion."
Who taught him that?


Dolphins Show Off Muscles
Theories abound on the American Football Conference-National Football Conference series, about why the N.F.C. has won the last nine Super Bowls, three of the last five Pro Bowls and has not lost in overall interdivision play in any season since 1988.
Many answers can be found up front.


In 'My Heart,' Memories of Vietnam
"YOU never get over it," says one of six women, among the thousands who returned, unacknowledged, from serving in Vietnam.
In the second act of "A Piece of My Heart," at Stamford Theater Works, four nurses, one intelligence officer and one singer begin to deal with the emotional wreckage, the physical and psychological fallout of a war without honor, without victory, without closure.
A final tableau of the actresses appearing before a representation of the "Vietnam Women's Memorial Project" startles the audience.
The devastating effect is built into Shirley Lauro's theater collage.
If the intention is to reflect upon an ignominious episode in history, the political statement inherent in Ms.
Lauro's piece, a theater's mission is accomplished.


Learning to Keep Prison Gates From Being Revolving Doors
To the Editor:
Our son, serving 20 years to life in a New York State prison, recently graduated from college.
We would have been happy, as parents, to pay the tuition for four years at the school that accepted him, but with his conviction and sentencing (for culpability in the death of a drug dealer), that opportunity was no longer ours.


THE LOOK OF THE NINETIES
Congratulations to Polly Hamilton for producing "The Look of the Nineties" (Fashion, Sept. 12).
And to Kurt Markus, the photographer, thanks for capturing with warmth and dignity what words often fail to convey -- that "old age," truly, is just a state of mind.


Toni Morrison Casts Spell For Students at Princeton
Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, is world famous for her books "Beloved," "Jazz" and "Song of Solomon." On the Princeton campus Ms.
Morrison is renowned for Studies in American Africanism, the seminar she teaches twice a week to a dozen rapt students.
The course, taught to a group that sits in an informal circle, centers on the way literary works have adapted to the presence in America of Africans and their descendants.
Students must apply to qualify, and the extensive reading list ranges from Edgar Allan Poe to Herman Melville to Professor Morrison herself.


Jordan's Retirement Puts the Reality Back in Our Court
Look at their faces, Woody Allen and Arnold Schwarzenegger, courtside, ringside, behind the dugout, Jack Nicholson and Spike Lee, stars with stars in their eyes, watching a large child in a playsuit hook, jab, swing away.
Even celebrities love the air that celebrities breathe, and no air is sweeter and purer than the air above the rim, inside the ropes, between the white lines where athletic celebrities do actual things that can be counted and measured.
Maybe not important things, but certainly real things, hard things, no stunt doubles, no scripted endings.

Canyon Rafting
To the Editor: I read Aaron Latham's article on white water rafting through the Grand Canyon (Sept. 5) with a great deal of interest and pleasure.
My wife and I were on the Colorado (along with 12 other passengers on a motorized raft) at about the same time as the Latham family, and there are a few things that your readers might like to know if they are contemplating running the river.
It isn't necessary to take that 9.5-mile hike down into the Grand Canyon to take one of these trips.
Our trip, with Grand Canyon Expeditions, began at Lee's Ferry, Ariz., about 90 miles upriver from the Latham starting point.
We reached it by bus, thus saving that daunting descent into the canyon.


Victorious Bosnian Serb Now Talks of Conciliation
Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Serbian nationalists who have seized 70 percent of the country, has said that his forces consider the war in Bosnia to be over and has promised that his troops will not renew their attacks on Sarajevo, the capital, and other strongholds of the Muslim-led Government.
Dr.
Karadzic said in an interview Friday night that the ethnic Serbian leadership planned to turn its efforts instead to rebuilding the shattered economy of the parts of Bosnia they control and mending relations with Bosnian Muslims.


More 'Padlocking' to Close Drug Sites
The Tanisha "Tobaco" Shop awning at 199 East Third Street advertises newspapers, magazines, soda and cigarettes.
But inside, the police say, there were no such things: the real merchandise was cocaine.
On Monday, a dozen officers and three city officials shut down Tanisha in a procedure known as padlocking.


Ikea
Function equals un is one rule that could apply to any successful family room.
And the architect Walter Chatham has found that the Swedish emporium Ikea never disappoints when it comes to stocking functional furnishings with a sense of flair.
"I love Ikea because they make everyday objects that aren't only amusing to look at but work," he says.
Chatham is a self-avowed "modernist with a sense of humanity" who likes basic shapes and colors.
"When you work with solids, it's hard to go wrong," he emphasizes.
Shopping to fill a loft-sized family room, Walter Chatham went for extremes in terms of shape: Two voluptuously overstuffed leather sofas are flanked by skinny six-foot metal lamps with yellow shades that reminded the architect of the sculptor Giacometti's attenuated figures.
But Chatham's overall intention was to use furnishings to create a pleasantly neutral background - one that could both absorb and encourage an active family life.
The following items are available at Ikea, Baltimore; Elizabeth, N.J.; Hicksville, L.I.; Houston; Los Angeles; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh, and Washington.

Mr. Jordan, Already Unforgettable
Who's the only person who could stop Michael Jordan?
The punch line: Dean Smith, his coach at North Carolina, who kept Mr.
Jordan's talents so tightly wrapped that the world's best basketball player was only the third player selected in the 1984 professional draft.
But now there's a new answer: Michael Jordan.
"I've lost interest," Mr.
Jordan said, not last week but last year -- before the season began, before the stories about gambling debts and a late-night Atlantic City junket, and before the death of his father.
And it was obvious in last spring's playoffs that he was playing not with joy but with grim determination to win a third straight championship.


FOLIC ACID SOUGHT IN SOME PRODUCTS
Seeking to reduce birth defects, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday that it would require all makers of bread and grains to add folic acid to products labeled "enriched."
The agency also said that makers of vitamins and supplements who put folic acid in their pills would soon be able to say on the labels that their products will help reduce birth defects.
This will be the first new health claim the agency has allowed since a new food labeling law was passed by Congress in 1991.

Oct. 3-9: Guns in the Home; Staying Unarmed is Safer, A New Study Finds
Surveys show that the reason people give most often for buying a handgun is protecting themselves in their homes.
Now, a study published last week challenges this common assumption, concluding that keeping a handgun at home nearly triples the likelihood that someone in the household will be murdered there.
The researchers studied murders in the homes of more than 400 victims in populous counties that included Seattle, Cleveland and Memphis.
It found no evidence that guns at home offer protection that outweighs the risks of keeping them, said researchers from three universities.
They found that 76.7 percent of the victims were killed by a family member or someone they knew, and that in 85 percent of the cases there was no forced entry.


Somalis Can Well Govern Themselves
To the Editor:
While "Somalia, Through a Glass Darkly" (Op-Ed, Sept. 30) by George F. Kennan reflects the wisdom to be expected from an almost unique American foreign policy sage, and offers an eerily accurate description of the tragic United States morass in Mogadishu, it is, unfortunately, based on an erroneous and offensive premise that "the people of Somalia are wholly unable to govern themselves." Mr.
Kennan also states that any resolution "could not be a democratic one, because the very prerequisites for a democratic political system do not exist among the people in question."


Dish to Go Up, Over Protest
In what Channel 13 thought was an act of good will, the station recently wrote to neighbors advising them that part of West 58th Street would be temporarily closed.
The public television station, which planned to construct and install a satellite antenna on the roof of its headquarters at 356 West 58th Street, expected some annoyance for the inconvenience.
But the reaction was anger.
Both neighbors and Community Board 4, citing the continuing debate over the risk of radiation exposure from such technology, last week sent letters to city, state and Federal officials protesting the antenna.

A Cautionary Tale
To the Editor:
In "Worry Time for Wall Street?" (Sept. 26), one of the featured sources, Hancock Institutional Equity Services technical analyst Justin Mamis, said of Money magazine's advice to small investors, " [ Money ]  has told them it's a long bull market and don't worry about corrections."


Plant Now for Best Results in Spring
THIS is an odd time of year for most gardeners.
The tree leaves are beginning to turn.
There are signals everywhere that the growing period is going fast.
Some may think about moving activities indoors.
Yet there is reluctance.

Lawns still need mowing.
There is an enormous amount of yardwork still to be done.
Don't put the tools away.

Motorman Should Have Seen Train He Struck, Official Says
The motorman who operated the subway train that crashed last Thursday in Brooklyn should have been able to see the train that had stopped in front of him and then apply his brakes in time to avert the accident, a state investigator said yesterday.
"From the time he came around the curve to the point where he could view the train stopped in the station, he had ample time to stop," said Bill Dayton, a supervisor with the State Public Transportation Safety Board, who was at the scene yesterday.
"This is provided that the brakes worked, and I'm expecting to find that they did."


Neighbors Seek to Raze a Racial Wall
For years, nothing ever happened to persuade the residents of Van Buren Avenue and the tenants of the Ravine Park Village public housing development to put away their fears and share a cup of coffee the way neighbors often do.
Separated by a lonely field and a generation of suspicion and stereotype, the middle- and working-class whites of Van Buren and the harder pressed blacks of Ravine Park followed the same code: you stay in your world and we'll stay in ours.


Dinnerware All Dressed Up For a Party
The MacLachlin dinnerware at MacKenzie-Childs combines scenes from upstate New York, where it is made, with stripes and a checkerboard pattern.
The dinner plate ($175) shows the combination to dramatic effect, but the serving box ($150) is the most adorable piece.
There are also lunch plates, teacups and rectangular bread and butter plates.


Expansion Hopefuls Polishing Their Acts
With 16 days to go before the National Football League club owners choose two expansion cities, some bidders are making last-minute pitches to improve their chances.
The St.
Louis group, for one, is trying to strengthen its finances.
A key figure may be John E. Connelly, who owns a floating gambling boat in Iowa and has applied for a license for a gambling riverboat in St.
Louis.
One report said league officials had rejected Connelly as a prospective minority partner.
A league source said Connelly remained in the picture.
Another source said Connelly was ready to put up $40 million of the $140 million franchise cost, but wanted some control.


At Yale, a Grand Tour of Prints to Exacting Specifications
A STANDARD chronology for Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) would doubtless highlight 1794 as the year in which drawings by the artist were first engraved for reproduction.
It would also note that the first subscription engraving for a painting, "The Shipwreck," was published in 1807.
But given the artist's output of paintings -- his bequest to the nation alone numbers 300 canvases and 20,000 watercolors -- it is about as far as such a chronology would go with his prints.


Advertising Was Always Part of Public Toilet Deal
To the Editor:
In 1991, when J.C.
DeCaux first showed city officials its automated self-cleaning public toilets, the firm proposed to install and run them for free in return for advertising kiosks.
Contrary to what Phillip Lopate wrote in his Sept. 26 essay, "Public Amenities, Private Profit," the city did not "suddenly," after a trial period, announce a "tradeoff" involving advertising kiosks.
In fact, such a kiosk was on display outside the General Motors Building during the trial period.


FISHING WITH PRESIDENTS
As a young man, I had the privilege of getting to know Herbert Hoover in the outdoor surroundings of California's Bohemian Grove as well as in the more rarefied setting of his "retirement" home in New York's Waldorf Towers ("Fishing With Presidents," by Howell Raines, Sept. 5).
A true citizen of the world, Hoover was happiest when tramping through a forest path or baiting a hook.
He hauled in his first catch at the age of 8.
Far from being a fishing snob, Hoover described fishing as a lesson in democracy, if only because "all men are equal before fish." As the line suggests, his humor was as dry as the flies he preferred to Calvin Coolidge's worms.


The Bagel Maven . . . From Puerto Rico
HELMER TORO was not to the bagel born.
When he was growing up on his father's struggling sugar cane farm in Puerto Rico, there were no bagels in his house.
Or in his vocabulary.
But then he moved to New York City, where the bagel is as unavoidable as crowds on the IRT.
Here he took his first bite of a warm, sweet-smelling, doughnut-shaped roll that had been boiled and baked to shiny perfection.
He fell in love.


The Duke's Stomping Ground
THE Museum of the City of New York will offer three walking tours this month to accompany its current exhibition "Beyond Category: The Musical Genius of Duke Ellington." The first tour, this afternoon, will explore the neighborhood where Ellington worked and played.
Arthur Marks, a veteran guide, will take his charges to 333 Riverside Drive, near 105th Street, where Ellington's sister lived and where he composed much of his music.
Also on the route: the Birdland Jazz Club at Broadway and 105th Street and the First Church of Christ Science at Central Park West and 96th Street.


How Minority Businesses Are Holding Up
THIRTEEN years ago, Everett L. James Jr. began operating his White Plains company, E. J. Excavating, out of a one-room office in his home, with little more than a pickup truck to his name.
At the time, he said, he was low on capital and high on pluck.
Today, after steering the business through several ups and downs, Mr.
James has a larger office, 10 full-time employees and a fleet of equipment.
On the whole, the ledger looks healthier, but his spirit is flagging.
"I'm beat," the 50-year-old entrepreneur said.
"I think I've lived through every obstacle a black businessman could come up against. I've been fighting for a long, long time."


Dallas Skating
To the Editor: I read with great interest "What's Doing in Dallas" (Aug. 29).
Anyone planning a visit in the next few weeks might like to know about the Skate America International Figure Skating Competition to be held Oct. 20 to 25.
This event features skaters such as Brian Boitano and Viktor Petrenko, both Olympic gold medalists, as well as Oksana Baiul, the current world figure skating champion.


Protest Jeopardizes Hispanic-Hasidic Housing Venture
An agreement between Hasidic Jews and Hispanic residents to rehabilitate an apartment building to be shared by the two groups may be in jeopardy after 200 squatters took over a new housing project last weekend, saying they feared most apartments would go to Hasidim.
Leaders of the Southside Housing Development Fund Corporation, or Los Sures, and the United Jewish Organization of Williamsburg began discussing the joint housing venture a year ago after tempers flared over a Hasidic proposal to seek Federal money to convert two housing projects into cooperative projects.


After Weicker, New Candidates, New Strategies
AS a politician, Gov.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has conducted his affairs rather like one of the opera stars he so admires: larger than life, full of grand passions, and capable at any moment of springing an improbable plot twist on his audience.
The election campaign that has now begun, following Mr.
Weicker's decision to leave the stage after one term, promises to be on a more human scale, for better and worse.


THE WORLD: Jordan Has Its Own Palestinian Problem; The Mideast Kingdom Threatened by Peace
JORDAN, its politics intractably complicated by the birth of Israel in 1948 amid warfare, finds itself in the throes of a profound identity crisis now that Israelis and the Palestine Liberation Organization have embarked on the road to peace.
During the Arab-Israeli war that immediately followed Israel's creation, Jordan absorbed the West Bank and later gave citizenship to its Arab population and to a large number of refugees from the territory that became Israel.
It took in still more refugees in 1967, when it lost the West Bank and East Jerusalem to Israel in the second Arab-Israeli war.
Largely as a result of the two conflicts, and a more recent Palestinian influx during the Persian Gulf crisis, as much as 70 percent of Jordan's population is Palestinian.

The Noise Buster, a new portable device to combat stress and fatigue caused by noise, did the trick.
Basically a small electronic box wired to a pair of Sony MDR-84 stereo headphones, the system can create what seems like a personal island of quiet in noisy settings like planes, trains, buses or factories.

Here, in a suburban Chicago labyrinth of freeways, toll ways and too many ways to get lost, Kukoc's most feared enemy is traffic.


Just Tossing and Turning
The fact that Americans are having dreams about celebrities has inspired a mini-trend in publishing -- books cataloguing dreams that people have about famous people whom, in most cases, they've never met.
Some people, for instance, get under the covers and have visions of Madonna.
Kay Turner, a folklorist and the lead singer of a band called Girls in the Nose, has collected 50 dreams about the pop star in a new illustrated book called "I Dream of Madonna: Women's Dreams of the Goddess of Pop" (Collins Publishers San Francisco, $14.95.)


Fate-of-the-Earth Furniture
THESE DAYS, MORE AND MORE of us are thinking green.
We bring string bags to the supermarket and buy biodegradable detergents, organic vegetables, even recyclable teakettles.
Yet how many of us think of the fate of the earth when selecting a new sofa or table?
It's difficult to imagine them as a threat to the environment, much less to one's health.
But the truth is that furniture manufacturing is a fundamentally polluting business: Companies often use pesticide-treated wood and apply paints and finishes that contain volatile toxic solvents, as well as glues made with formaldehyde, a likely carcinogen.
Not to mention the millions of acres of rain forest that are destroyed in the demand for tropical woods such as mahogany and rosewood.
Troubled by this environmental toll, a growing number of designers, manufacturers and marketers have embarked on an ecological odyssey in search of cleaner and safer materials and renewable wood sources.

AIDS and Public Health
To the Editor:
In his letter of Sept. 5, Dr.
Warren W. Francis complains that "the basic public health principles for epidemic control" have been, in the case of AIDS, "condemned by the 'AIDS activists.' " He implies that such "principles" as "testing," "notification of known contacts" and "isolation where necessary" should be enacted as policy for AIDS, as they were for tuberculosis.

Oct. 3-9: Small Bomb, Big Problem; Chinese Explosion Puts Another Dent In Relations With U.S.
At 80 to 90 kilotons, the nuclear bomb tested by China last week is deemed medium-sized.
But arms-control advocates worried that the blast could set in motion an international chain reaction as well.
President Clinton had urged China not to carry out the test, and the day after it took place he directed the Department of Energy to plan for resuming America's own nuclear tests, which were halted a year ago.
The disarmament advocates worry that Russia, France and Britain could follow suit.

"This is something that was a dream. The National League job was not a dream. I wanted the opportunity, and now I have the opportunity to put together a winner for a team I started with way back in 1965. Now it's my team, and I have a chance to take it to the next level."

THE WORLD: Moderate Meddling; From Asia, Models for Growing Economies
FOR more than a decade, economists and politicians have been looking for a secret formula in the waters that run from the Sea of Japan to the South China Sea.
No other region of the world has seen such remarkable economic growth, nor such dramatic improvements in everything from education to life expectancy.
For a world stuck in economic stagnation, what common lessons are there in the experiences of Japan, the "four tigers" -- Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea -- and now the other booming economies of Southeast Asia?
For a while, no one was sure they wanted an answer.

Jobs at Prisons Go Beyond License Plates
ON a recent Thursday, Joy Whitted awoke about 7 A.M., put on a flowered skirt and jacket, slipped a bright turquoise clip into her carefully combed hair and applied some finishing touches to her makeup.
At 8 A.M., she was seated in front of her computer console, ready for a day's work.
"Thank you for calling New Jersey Travel and Tourism," she said into the telephone headset.
"My name is Joy. How can I help?"


Congressional Bill To Save Forests
It was gratifying to read about Carl Ross's work to save the old-growth forests that are being logged practically into extinction  [ "From Hicksville and Its Trees, a Leader in Forest Preservation," Sept. 19 ] .
However, I wish the article had included the number of the forest-biodiversity and clear-cutting-prohibition act, so readers could write to Congressmen and identify the bill more easily.
It is H.R. 1164 and currently has 60 co-sponsors.


Who Says College Can Only Last Four Years?; The M.B.A. Example
To the Editor:
Before moving too quickly toward three-year bachelor's degrees (Education page, Sept. 29), the academic community should study a similar situation at the graduate level.


Hoechst to Pay $546 Million To Gain Control of Copley
In yet another marriage of drug- development and generic drug businesses, the Hoechst Celanese Corporation, the chemical and drug concern, said on Saturday that it had agreed to buy 51 percent of Copley Pharmaceutical Inc. for $546 million.
If the deal goes through as planned, a newly formed Hoechst Celanese subsidiary, the HCCP Acquisition Corporation of Delaware, will buy 9.9 million Copley shares at $55 apiece.
Copley, which will continue to trade as a publicly held company, closed on Friday at $49.75, down 25 cents.
Hoechst Celanese of Somerville, N.J., is a unit of Hoechst A.G. of Frankfurt.


CHRONICLE
The Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, also a playwright and novelist, JULES FEIFFER , has written and illustrated his first children's book, "The Man in the Ceiling." It tells the tale of Jimmy Jibbett, a boy who is lousy at sports but excellent at drawing.
Just like Mr.
Feiffer, when he was a boy.
"Nothing in the book ever happened, but everything in the book is true," Mr.
Feiffer said Saturday evening, at a book party on Martha's Vineyard given by his friends and neighbors, the novelist WARD JUST and his wife, SARAH CATCHPOLE .
Mr.
Just greeted 30 or so guests, including LINDA A. FAIRSTEIN , Manhattan's chief sex crimes prosecutor and author of "Sexual Violence," and ROBERT BRUSTEIN , the artistic director of Boston's American Repertory Theater.


Novell to Let Industry Group Have Unix Software Rights
Novell Inc.'s on-again, off-again plans to give rights to the Unix software operating system to an independent industry consortium are on again, Novell officials have said.
Novell plans on Monday to announce that it will turn over the Unix trademark, as well as responsibility for maintaining the operating systems' specifications, to the X/Open Company, a London-based consortium of 14 companies dedicated to maintaining Unix standards.


Nazi Understaffing Helped Danish Jews
To the Editor:
"Danes Commemorate Rescue of Danish Jews" (news article, Sept. 28) conveys the significant role played by the German occupation authorities in Denmark in facilitating the successful escape of some 7,000 Danish Jews right under Nazi noses.
You also identify some underlying motives for this manifestation of German connivance in helping Jews escape.


Review/Fashion; Four Designers In the Vanguard Hold the Line
Anyone looking for an example of the hollow politicization of fashion need look no further than the runway of Corinne Cobson.
The designer sent out T-shirt after T-shirt with "stop racism" on them, but used only white models in the show.
The genuinely disruptive messages in fashion now are not ones that can be printed on a T-shirt.
Young designers are caught in a curious game, of trying to mimic and anticipate the radical trendsetters -- Martin Margiela, Dries van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester and Helmut Lang -- who are cautiously dismantling the staid ideas of beauty in fashion.
This season, some collections here have the frantic feeling of a chase.
But in fact, the quarry has stopped short; the four radicals barely changed at all, while others are taking their ideas to extremes.


The Times Names A New Puzzle Editor
Will Shortz, former editor of Games magazine, will become puzzle editor of The New York Times next month.
His appointment was announced yesterday by Jack Rosenthal, editor of The Times Magazine.

He succeeds Eugene T. Maleska, who died in August after editing The Times's puzzles for 16 years.


Review/Fashion; Artful, but Will It Wear?
Conventional clothing was an endangered species in the first days of the French ready-to-wear shows for spring and summer.
Thin shrouds of fabric lightly veiled the body, baring all.
Paper hats filled up with air like balloons, and hair was sprayed and knotted to look like birds' nests.
The shows were like very advanced art exhibits, except the products were to be worn, not hung on walls.
Still, there were moments of beauty.
Christian Lacroix provided the most luxurious versions of wearable art in a collection of remarkable complexity that will probably stand as one of the wonders of the season.


Review/Television; Where Protection Is as Important as Education
All the children at the M. Hall Stanton Elementary School, in a rundown neighborhood of Philadelphia, are black; almost all live in single-parent homes and in poverty, and some have been exposed to crack before birth.
They are the subjects of Alan and Susan Raymond's strong new documentary, with its flares of brightness on a dark canvas.
The story of "I Am a Promise" is told mainly through Deanna Burney, the school's principal.
It's a nonstop job.
We see her playing many parts: cheerleader, assuring fourth and fifth graders that they are all "genius children"; disciplinarian of hard cases, by turns coaxing along and cracking down; social worker, trying to help parents help the school to help their children; supervisor, cushioning criticisms of teachers in soft language, and alert guardian, keeping watch over the dangerous streets outside her school at dismissal time.


When an Investor Chooses a Professional Mutual Fund Planner
To the Editor:
"Paying a Professional to Run No-Load Funds" (Your Money pages, Sept. 11) does an excellent job of comparing and contrasting how professionals use load or no-load mutual funds.
However, I believe more needs to be said for individual investors.


Market Place; To invest in new braking systems, investors stop at Varity.
AFTER air bags, which are gradually becoming standard equipment on every vehicle built in this country, four-wheel antilock braking systems -- or A.B.S., as they are commonly known -- are the fastest-growing new automotive safety device.
They are also the reason for investor interest in an up-and-coming company in this field, the Varity Corporation.
Until now, the Kelsey-Hayes subsidiary of Varity has been a leading manufacturer of two-wheel antilock brakes, mostly for pickups and other light trucks.
As such, the company has benefited much less than its competitors have from the enormous popularity of the devices in smaller vehicles.
Those competitors include the ITT Corporation, the Bendix unit of Allied Signal, Robert Bosch G.m.b.H., and the Delco Chassis division of General Motors.

Dolphins Lose Marino but Not the Victory
In a football game that was more like a thrill-a-second carnival, the Miami Dolphins may have lost quarterback Dan Marino for the season due to an injury to his right Achilles' tendon and they may have found a wonderful replacement in backup lefty Scott Mitchell.
At the same time, the Miami defense bottled up Cleveland Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar after Kosar had some early success this afternoon and pushed him out of the game and a job: Vinnie Testaverde again relieved Kosar, and he will start next Sunday when Cleveland plays at Cincinnati.

CLINTON CARE PLAN MAY CUT BENEFITS TO SOME CHILDREN
Some Administration officials and advocates for children are saying President Clinton's health plan would eliminate some benefits received by millions of poor children on Medicaid, including many who are disabled.
Under the health plan's package of basic services, some Medicaid recipients under 21 could lose benefits they now have, including transportation to and from a doctor, certain types of hearing and vision care, physical rehabilitation and special education services.


Labor Wants Shorter Hours To Make Up for Job Losses
Union leaders and some economists are beginning to talk seriously about what once seemed a far-fetched remedy for disappearing high-pay jobs: a shorter workweek.
This may not sound like a particularly novel idea; millions of part-timers already work far fewer than 40 hours a week.
But the unions would insist that regular full-time workers whose weeks are cut to 35 hours or so keep their 40-hour pay and benefits.


The Future of Lenin's Tomb Is Still in Doubt


Wisconsin Is No. 2 and Awakening Its Faintest Echoes
Michigan and Penn State have never played, and the 1,000th game in Penn State's history this weekend was supposed to be the big one to determine which team might go to the Rose Bowl from the Big Ten.
Michigan looked like a final No. 1 team to some.
But Michigan's stunning 17-7 setback at Michigan State on Saturday has made Wisconsin, Ohio State and Penn State leading contenders for the Rose Bowl.
All three are 5-0 over all.


John Harrison and Helen Strauch

Russian Showdown, Hour by Tense Hour
Before the shooting died down and the fires were extinguished, the questions were raging in Russia.

Financial Woes Imperil a Container Redemption Center
We Can, a nonprofit group that aids the homeless in New York City by redeeming returnable bottles and cans, is facing extreme financial difficulties and may have to shut down its 220,000-container-a-day operation, officials of the group say.
The six-year-old organization has been hurt by long delays in receiving reimbursements from beverage distributors and by a per-container handling fee that organization officials say is inadequate, as well as by labor disputes and poor management decisions.
Without increased donations from foundations or individuals, the group says, it may no longer be able to make ends meet.


Pan Am Suspects Advised Not to Surrender
A team of international lawyers representing two Libyans accused in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Scotland, said today that they had advised the suspects not to surrender to the Scottish authorities for trial, citing a "grave concern" that pretrial publicity could prevent the suspects from receiving a fair hearing.
After two days of meetings with the two suspects in Tripoli, the defense team said they would contact the Governments of Britain and the United States in the next few days "to discuss future progress" in the case.


Increase in Attacks Feared, Government Tells Israelis
A day after two Israeli hikers were killed in a part of the West Bank previously assumed to be safe, Government officials and army officers warned today of the likelihood of stepped-up attacks by Palestinian militants who want to undermine the agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
"We are in a sensitive, I would even say dangerous, period," Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said.
A senior army officer cautioned, "The presumption is that there is going to be a concerted effort by a large group of people to make things very difficult."


Nature, And Man, Cloud Fate Of Levees
On an insolently beautiful morning in September, Allen Rodewald toed the jagged edge of a quarter-mile gap in the levee that had stood here unbroken for decades.
He tried to find words to explain how utterly baffled and deserted he felt.
Behind the 40-year-old farmer, the Mississippi was 14 feet above flood stage and surging through a stand of cottonwoods with the sound of an ocean gale.
In front of Mr.
Rodewald was 26,000 acres of bottom land, some of it his, that had become a 40-square-mile lake so deep that the water lapped at the second floors of farm houses.


Paramount To Weigh QVC Talks
Bowing to the pressure of a hostile but attractive takeover bid from QVC Network Inc., the board of Paramount Communications Inc. is expected to approve exploratory merger talks with QVC when it meets this morning, according to an executive close to the Paramount board.
Separately, QVC is continuing talks on a cash infusion of as much as $1 billion from a group of investors said to include BellSouth and Cox Enterprises among others.
Details of the deal were still being worked out last night, according to several executives close to QVC.


Timing (i.e., Wisdom) of Yeltsin's Trip to Tokyo Is Stirring Anxiety
If President Boris N. Yeltsin does go ahead on Monday with his twice-postponed visit to Tokyo, which he has vowed to do, there are serious questions about what he's going to be able to accomplish there -- and what might happen in Russia while he's away.
It was quiet today in Moscow, with the population still shellshocked by the violent confrontation between Mr.
Yeltsin and his parliamentary rivals.
The city remains under a curfew and state of emergency decrees that ban all political demonstrations.

British Statement Restarts Debate on Ulster
The debate over a new peace initiative for Northern Ireland accelerated today after the British Secretary for the north, Sir Patrick Mayhew, explained the conditions under which he would negotiate with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
In the first elaboration of British policy on the initiative since it won the approval last Thursday of the Irish Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds, Sir Patrick said in a radio interview on Saturday that only an unconditional guarantee from the I.R.A. that its campaign of violence had ended would lead to a negotiating role for Sinn Fein.
A temporary cease-fire would not suffice, he said.


Tollbooth Is Robbed on Bridge
A gunman in a rental van robbed a tollbooth on the Triborough Bridge on Saturday night, sped through another booth on the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, struck four cars during a chase that followed and, after the van overturned, escaped with an estimated $2,500, the head of the union representing bridge and tunnel officers said.
The robbery was the 25th this year, said Peter Lukas, the president of the Bridge and Tunnel Officers Benevolent Association, and occurred even as the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority had begun beefing up security measures at its two tunnels and seven bridges to halt a record number of tollbooth robberies.

Terms were not disclosed.
Earle Palmer's Atlanta office, which has fewer than 10 employees, has billings estimated at $5 million from clients like Atlanta Gas Light.
Dick Henderson, the chief executive and executive creative director of Cole Henderson, said Friday that some Earle Palmer employees would be absorbed into his agency, which has 50 employees and billings estimated at $25 million from clients like the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company.


Reporter's Notebook; Books Are a Big Deal But Writers May Not Be
It was Thursday at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the international publishing world's weeklong frenzy of deals, near deals and partying that ends on Monday, and Sandra Dijkstra, an American agent, was doing what she always does at Frankfurt: trying to sell foreign rights to the books she represents.
Never mind that she was stuffed into a riotously noisy room with dozens of editors, agents and publishers doing essentially the same thing, or that she had just 30 minutes to pitch her list to a pair of French publishers, or that she would be spending the next five days in the same room, repeating herself.
Foreign-rights deals are so important to the book business -- as a way to defray the costs of huge advances and to earn more money for the publishers, agents and authors -- that the role of Ms.
Dijkstra and others like her is critical to the workings of the fair, which this year drew 6,102 exhibitors from 95 countries.

Youth Arrested in Shooting
A teen-ager was arrested yesterday in the shooting of a 13-year-old Brooklyn girl who was paralyzed by a bullet fired at her on Thursday night by an assailant looking for her brother, the police said.
The girl, Jennifer Davis, opened the door of her apartment in the Tilden Houses in Brownsville to three teen-agers seeking her brother, said Amanita Duga-Carroll, a spokeswoman for the Housing Police.
When the girl told them he was not home, Ms.
Duga-Carroll said, they shot her.
The suspect was identified as Rashaid Dayshawn Robinson, 15, of 365 Sackman Street in Brooklyn.
Arrested at his home at 1:30 P.M. yesterday, he is being charged as an adult with attempted murder, assault, and criminal possession of a weapon.
The girl was still listed in critical condition at Brookdale Hospital last night.


Do Not Let Farrakhan Use Stadium, Giuliani Says
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, said yesterday that he strongly disagreed with the Dinkins administration's plan to allow Louis H. Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, to rent Yankee Stadium for a rally this month.
Citing Mr.
Farrakhan's past statements that many consider anti-Semitic, including referring to Judaism as "a gutter religion," Mr.
Giuliani compared the planned rally to allowing "neo-Nazis or skinheads to rent Yankee Stadium."


Dispute Stirs Over Status Of After-School Program
Parents of 75 children who attend this community's only after-school program say the children have so much fun that it's difficult prying them away at 5:30 when the day is over.
But despite rave reviews throughout the community, the program is fighting to stay open.
The trouble is no one wants to sponsor it and without sponsorship the after-school program cannot get the rent-free room it needs to stay in business.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing
IN its salad days after World War II, the Frankfurt Book Fair was a big genteel book party for the world's publishers, a place where they could gather to learn about one another's books and go about the gentlemanly business of publishing.
But publishing is no longer gentlemanly, Frankfurt is not what it was either, and faxes, conference calls and overnight mail have all but supplanted face-to-face meetings.
And with European and American publishers laying out huge sums of money for transportation, hotels, meals, photo-copying, taxis, and the extravagant tips demanded to insure any sort of service in Frankfurt, many publishers are beginning to wonder why the weeklong fair, which ends today, seems to grow bigger each year.

Alomar Near the Top If You Add It All Up
Roberto Alomar was asked if Roberto Alomar was the best player in the American League and he was foiled for the first time in a hectic day.
He smiled, he shrugged and he stammered.
This was one situation the smooth second baseman was fumbling.
On a day when Alomar raced for three steals to help produce a typical Toronto performance, when he smacked three hits and walked twice to revive a sluggish offense and when he also made two neat defensive plays to resurrect discussions about whether he is the premier player in the league, Alomar was humble enough to scamper from the prestigious title pinned today by Chicago's Joey Cora.
He sort of avoided it.

Chevy Chase's Ratings Deliver Frowns at Fox
It isn't called the "late-night war" for nothing.
"The Chevy Chase Show" enters its sixth week on the Fox network tonight with signs of becoming the new season's first post-prime-time casualty.
The show, which was savaged by critics from the start, has fallen significantly short of the ratings that Fox had guaranteed advertisers.
And many affiliates, which got higher ratings with syndicated fare in the same time slot, are restless.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; A shake-up of agencies by Coca-Cola may be just the beginning of a wider 'Ideas Wanted' push.
TWO advertising agencies known for risk-taking, rule-breaking creativity have been selected by the Coca-Cola Company to work on special projects for the soft-drink giant.
The regional midsize agencies Coca-Cola added to its official roster of shops on Friday specialize in campaigns with hip, contemporary points of view.
One is Fallon McElligott of Minneapolis, which humorously dramatizes the difficulties of wearing too-tight jeans for Lee.
The other is Wieden &amp; Kennedy of Portland, Ore., which helps Nike wage the sneaker wars by urging the world to "Just do it."

Review/Television; PBS Revives a Series On Race and America
The award-garlanded dramatic series "I'll Fly Away" shows up on public television tonight and, in terms of the general outlook for television in this country, it is an occasion for both cheers and tears.
Yes, it's wonderful that the distinguished NBC series is getting a public-television showcase.
But that doesn't negate the fact that the show was canceled on commercial television, despite widespread protests by critics and viewer organizations.
Obviously, they are not nearly as powerful as network accountants.
And the good intentions of public television, tin cup always in hand, are severely limited.
This "second life" for the series consists of tonight's two-hour movie, "Then and Now," and weekly reruns of all 38 original episodes broadcast between 1991 and this year.


Courtesy and Senator Helms
For months, under a strange definition of "senatorial courtesy," Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina has blocked confirmation of Walter Dellinger, a well-qualified candidate from his home state, to be the Justice Department's legal counsel.
Last week Mr.
Helms staged a filibuster, which survived a motion to close debate by one vote.
He charged rudeness on the part of the Clinton Administration for hiring Mr.
Dellinger over his objection.
The Senate's excessive deference to the growling of Mr.
Helms stands as another unhappy exhibition of fear and cowardice.
Fortunately Senator Helms, perhaps aware that another cloture vote on Wednesday would go against him, now says he won't continue to block the full Senate from voting on the nomination.
That should let the Senate come to its senses and judge the candidate on his merits.


Review/Music; Romantics, Often Linked, Are Seen in a Fresh Light
A basic law of optics -- that neighboring objects blur together as the eye goes away from them -- applies equally to history.
Indeed, perceived from a distance of 150 years, Chopin, Liszt and Schumann seem somehow all of a piece, as willing cohabitants in that world we have come to call Romantic piano music.
Charles Rosen's deftly chosen program of piano pieces at the Kathryn Bache Miller Theater on Thursday night separated the three all over again.
Call it, if you will, a kind of musicological optometry.
If time has made it hard for us to see Chopin clearly, familiarity makes it even harder.
Chopin's piano music is perhaps the most useful repertory that ambitious virtuosos possess, and its ubiquitous presence dulls the impact of music that ought to startle us.
Mr.
Rosen's first service here was to find pieces still capable of doing so: the late B-major Nocturne and its catalogue of shockingly beautiful modulations; the Barcarolle, whose smooth surfaces scarcely conceal a dying man's sarcasm and despair.


Patents
SILK, linen and cashmere make beautiful clothes, but they have a costly liability.
A closet full of wool trousers or silk blouses can mean many dry-cleaning errands and bills.
While many silks can be hand-washed, it is hard to imagine soaking a $700 business suit in a tub of Woolite.
To fill this laundry gap, a company in North Caldwell, N.J., has patented an at-home dry-cleaning kit.
Creative Products Resources Inc. designed a heavy-duty plastic bag and sheets of thick paper coated with a cleaning gel.
As many as four garments can be put inside the bag, along with one of the moist cleaning sheets.
The bag is then put into a dryer and tumbled for 20 minutes.


'Yes . . . but Is It Art?'
To the Editor:
Re your Oct. 4 article on the reaction of the art world to my "60 Minutes" segment titled "Yes . . . but Is It Art?": Far from "questioning the very premises of abstract art," as you declaim, I was questioning the pretension and esthetic sensibilities of a number of dealers and the talents of certain artists.


Phillies Use Pitching And Defense To Tie Series
There was no pretense about it.
The Philadelphia offense and the Philadelphia pitching staff were desperately seeking something, anything, from each other in the way of a lift.
Before they found themselves staring up from an incredibly deep hole in the National League Championship Series.
Before their quest for a World Series was ended in lopsided fashion by the increasingly strong Atlanta Braves.
Well, the Phillies got just one of their wishes tonight, but it was enough.
For Danny Jackson, a savior by any definition, stopped the Atlanta offense on nine hits and one run over seven and two-thirds innings and drove in the decisive run in a 2-1 Phillies victory in Game 4 that evened the four-of-seven-game series at two games apiece.


CHESS
Nigel Short was hanging on grimly against Gary Kasparov's persistent positional pressure until he panicked, opened the center and was quickly crushed by the Russian's juggernaut in Game 15 of their world championship match on Saturday in London.
Kasparov is cruising to victory with a six-point lead, the score now standing at 10 1/2-4 1/2 in his favor.
Short dug in behind a barrier of almost invisible traps, but Kasparov was not fooled.
He patiently sidestepped the venom and methodically strengthened his position.
Short at first accepted the necessity for groveling, but when Kasparov had readied all his forces for a storm of the black king position at Move 28, the Englishman could stand it no longer and tried for dynamic counterplay.
That only fueled Kasparov's attack and the game was soon over.


Who Says College Can Only Last Four Years?; Consider the Negatives
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 29 Education page article on completing college in three years makes some interesting points about receiving a bachelor's degree in three years versus the traditional four.
Despite the perceived economic benefit in the expedited degree, the negatives should be considered.


First Step In Making An Eyesore An Asset
For Brooklyn's Gowanus Canal, June 21, 1911, was a glorious day.
A new system to flush out the putrid industrial canal was installed, as 350 dignitaries applauded from a barge and a young woman tossed red carnations on the still waters.
The system, which involved a tunnel to bring clean water from New York Harbor to the head of the canal to get the stagnant waters moving, functioned for about half a century before breaking.
Now, a mere 33 years later, the city is finally getting around to fixing it.
Money has been appropriated, parts have been ordered, and bids have been invited.


PULSE: On Broadway
With 17 new shows due to open this fall, expectations are high on Broadway following a record-breaking 1992-93 season.
Unlike recent years when many shows opened late in the season, just before the deadline for the Tony awards, productions that have received much advance notice, including "Perestroika," or part two of "Angels in America," and "The Kentucky Cycle," which won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for drama, will debut this fall.
Last year's gross of $327.7 million broke the record set the year before.
Attendance and the gross of shows on tour have also risen according to the League of American Theaters and Producers.
The top Broadway ticket price for the start of the season is $65; it was $55 in 1988-89. (Source: League of American Theaters and Producers)


'Ask First' at Antioch
The comedy routines almost write themselves.
A recent "Saturday Night Live" segment featured a game show called "Is It Date Rape?" Confronted with hypothetical situations, a male and female contestant had to say whether each constituted date rape.
Predictably, the woman (a prim, bespectacled Shannen Doherty) always said yes, and the driveling fraternity slob said no.
Much of the script was lifted almost verbatim from the sexual offense policy of Antioch College.
Antioch's policy is easy to parody.
That's too bad, because it's a serious, if touchingly earnest, attempt to deal with a real problem.
Date rape is no joke, but in trying to stop it, Antioch, along with scores of other colleges across the country, sets out to codify the sexual behavior of adolescents.
That's not a bad goal, but it's awfully tricky, and inherently almost impossible to implement.

Mayoral Campaign Tests The Loyalty of Democrats
"I GUARANTEE you," Gov.

Smoltz Is Perfect No More in Post-Season
This night was supposed to be worth the wait.
For 10 days, John Smoltz had waited for his first start in this series against the Philadelphia Phillies, to take his perfect record in post-season play to the mound at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and help the Atlanta Braves take an important step toward a World Series championship.
Smoltz was surprised when he was passed over by Manager Bobby Cox at the start of the series.
And when his wait was finally over, Smoltz felt something strange.


Look Familiar? Jets Build Lead, Jets Waste Lead
This is turning into a nasty habit.
For the second consecutive week the Jets went ahead by a large margin in the first half only to see it dry up and blow away.
Last week they led the Eagles by 21-0 only to lose, 35-30.
Today against the Raiders, the Jets (2-3) went ahead by 17-0 and then lost, 24-20, on a 1-yard touchdown run by Nick Bell with 4 seconds to play.
But this was no ordinary comeback for the Raiders (3-2), who benefited from confusion over the timekeeping in the final seconds while trailing, 20-17.


Sky Beauty Might Be Ahead of Them All
Racing form returned to Belmont Park yesterday when Sky Beauty won the Rare Perfume Stakes with graceful command, enhanced her ranking as the best filly in the business and even raised the suspicion that she might be the best horse of either gender in the business.
Her performance was dramatized by the fact that she succeeded on a weekend when Star of Cozzene, Fraise, Alydeed and Ibero didn't.
In fact, half an hour before she took the track, another favorite bit the dust when Virginia Rapids ran sixth in the Jamaica Handicap behind Mi Cielo.
But if Allen Jerkens felt regret over Virginia Rapids, one of the stars of his barn, he was uplifted by Sky Beauty, the superstar of his barn.
A Consistent Winner
Sky Beauty now has gone to the races 11 times in her career, finished first in 10, ran second in the other and has gone 7 for 7 at Belmont Park.
She won the Triple Tiara there last spring, won the Alabama Stakes at Saratoga in August, returned yesterday after two months of rest, carried 12 pounds more than her five rivals and still won by nearly two lengths.


Mother's Homemade Marijuana; A Plan to Aid Her Son Leads to Arrest and Push for Change
The annals of crime do not record many 79-year-old grandmothers who have been arrested for growing marijuana in their backyards, and even Mildred Kaitz has an explanation that she thinks makes her offense pardonable.
She did it for her son, Barton, who lives in Brooklyn and who, at 49, has been suffering from multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease of the nervous system, which has progressively crippled his legs, blurred his vision and deadened his appetite.
Smoking marijuana, she discovered, made him eat with gusto, so she did what she says any loving mother would do in similar circumstances: grow the marijuana for him.


Car Wreck Closes Tunnel

A decorated agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who says her superiors refused to take seriously her complaints of sexual harassment is planning a highly unusual protest on Monday: turning in her badge.

Revolt in Moscow: How Yeltsin Turned the Tide, Hour by Hour
As Russia's fate hung in the balance one week ago, President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government seemed almost paralyzed.
While bands of Communist and nationalist gunmen broke through to the Parliament building, the headquarters of President Yeltsin's foes, and battled for the state television center, the large force of special police around the building disintegrated, presidential aides were in disarray, the President dallied at his dacha and soldiers from elite units were out picking potatoes.


Taxi Jumps Curb, Injuring 7 People, 2 Critically
A taxi lurched out of control and onto a busy midtown Manhattan sidewalk yesterday, pinning a woman against another taxi and injuring six other people before it was finally stopped by an off-duty police officer, the police said.
The woman, Lora Kluckowski, 30, a graduate student at Syracuse University, was waiting with a classmate at a taxi stand outside the entrance to the New York Hilton at 53d Street and the Avenue of the Americas when the accident occurred about 1:30 P.M., said a police spokesman, Sgt.

Discounting Finally Makes It to Japan
Japan's new leaders were swept to power amid promises that the Government would no longer tolerate ridiculously high prices and that companies would have to stop enriching themselves at home while offering deep discounts on cameras and television sets in Manhattan and Hong Kong.
Still, no one in the Japanese bureaucracy was quite prepared to deal with retailers like Ken Fujisawa, who had the temerity, in a family-owned store on a back street of Tokyo, to do what no one else had in a generation -- offer Japanese women a 20 percent discount on cosmetics made by the giant of the Japanese industry, Shiseido.

Seconds Thoughts on Stopped Clock
If you ask the Jets, the clock operator deserves an assist for their 24-20 loss to the Raiders at the Los Angeles Coliseum this afternoon.

SOCCER: World Cup USA '94 QUALIFYING; Zambia's Quest to Qualify Is Unfulfilled
The Moroccan faithful danced in place and brandished their makeshift torches: thousands of burning, rolled-up newspapers sending ash careening upward into the clear North African sky; thousands of burning newspapers sending out word that the bright, shining Zambian dream was done.
There will be no historic first berth in the final round of the World Cup, no national holiday declared on Monday, no better-than-fiction comeback from the wreckage of the military transport plane that crashed into the sea off Gabon in April and took the lives of 18 Zambian national team players and their two coaches.

But if they are successful, it will not be because they have taken the "high road" -- a road that Congress has yet to get to on the way to campaign-finance reform on the receivers' side.

In Campaign for the Health Care Plan, Hillary Clinton Is the Top Candidate
Catchy slogans, far-fetched television commercials, fund-raising appeals in the mail.
The election-style battle over health care legislation already has many trappings of the modern campaign.
Much of it, from the slogan "Health Care That's Always There" to the pretentiously titled "War Room" at the White House where the battle is being directed, was predictable enough.
But what sets this one apart from most propaganda efforts for legislation from the civil rights bills of the 60's to the tax cuts of the 80's is that this campaign looks as if it has a candidate -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.


Books of The Times; Growing Old With a Can-Do Attitude
The Fountain of Age  By Betty Friedan  671 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $25.
The fragments of a powerful, inspiring message are scattered among the more than 600 pages of Betty Friedan's cleverly titled new book, "The Fountain of Age," unquestionably her most important work since her pioneering first book, "The Feminine Mystique," was published in 1963.
America is in love with youth, she reminds us.
So, considering age to be a problem, Americans fail to consider the problems of age.
Or as she puts it, "Seeing age only as decline from youth, we make age itself the problem -- and never face the real problems that keep us from evolving and leading continually useful, vital, and productive lives."

The Best Bosnia Can Expect May Be 'No War, No Peace'
Nobody will say this for the record, but leaders on all sides in the war in Bosnia are acknowledging that the most acceptable plan for peace may be no formal peace plan at all.
While the Serbs and Croats have accepted a peace proposal, the Muslim-led Bosnian Government has not, and although talks are expected to resume, there is little inclination here to believe in peace any time soon.
Instead, the prevailing view is that what lies ahead is a new kind of misery, a situation described in a common aphorism as "necemo rat, necemo mir" -- Serbo-Croatian for "no war, no peace."

Giants' Magic Makes Redskins Disappear
It was just moments before the Giants would take the field and blow out the Washington Redskins when Lawrence Taylor looked at Phil Simms and told him how bad he wanted this victory, that this might be the last time the two have a big game at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.
Simms looked at Taylor and sensed that when he said that, it was more than just L. T. wanting to win every game.


Lisa M. Bergson, Jeremiah Riddle
Lisa Marie Bergson, the president and chief executive of Meeco Inc., a manufacturer of industrial analytical equipment in Warrington, Pa., was married yesterday to Jeremiah Richard Riddle, a vice president of Johnson &amp; Higgins, an insurance brokerage in New York.

The bride's previous marriage ended in divorce, as did the bridegroom's.


For Magazines, a Multimedia Wonderland
As magazine publishers become dazzled by the seductive possibilities of interactive electronic media, a sea change is occurring in the magazine industry.
Nowhere is this more evident than at the annual American Magazine Conference, which opens here today with almost a third of the sessions devoted to multimedia publishing.
Indeed, this conference, which has traditionally dealt only with magazines, could now be called the Mostly Magazine Festival.

The Case for Clean Needles
It now seems clear that providing clean needles to drug addicts can slow the spread of the AIDS virus without increasing drug abuse.
If that conclusion holds up under Federal review, there is no longer any good reason to block the spread of pioneering needle exchanges that serve addicts in scattered cities.
Any program that can slow the transmission of AIDS among drug addicts is desperately needed.
Although the AIDS epidemic initially hit homosexuals hardest, it has rapidly infected addicts who inject their drugs; the virus is spread from one addict to another when they share a needle.
Fully one-third of all AIDS cases in the United States have occurred in drug addicts or their sex partners and children; the toll is particularly high among blacks and Hispanics.


Review/Television; Taking a Look at the Deep Pockets of High Style
Like the fashion industry it exhibits and exposes, "The Look" displays the latest in haute couture while keeping its eye on the bottom line.
There are enough supermodels striding, sauntering and swirling along catwalks in this tony, two-part BBC documentary to populate one of the glittery Paris showings on which the cameras dote.
But the narration is wry and dry, as the program explores the mix of "desires and dollars, myth and money" that propel a trillion-dollar industry.
It's a cool look at a hot game.
The stars are big-name designers, big-circulation-magazine editors, big-salaried models and big-deal buyers for big stores, with a few celebrities (notably rock stars) sewn on like rhinestones. (The horde of conspicuously unglamorous photographers at the ultraglamorous, ultraexpensive seasonal shows are described as the "worker ants of the industry," yet it is they who represent "the media's magic eye.")

Review/Music; A Chamber Ensemble With a Billing to Live Up To
"Founded in 1991, this trio has established itself as one of today's foremost chamber ensembles," proclaims the artist biography for the Moscow Conservatory Trio.
It sounds improbable, but on the evidence of an outstanding concert at Merkin Hall last Monday night, it might be the honest truth.
After less than two years of collaboration, Paul Ostrovsky (pianist), Oleh Krysa (violinist) and Suren Bagratuni (cellist) are a trio of startling expressive powers.
At the very least, they soar far above the workmanlike norm.
All three players share a background at the Moscow Conservatory.
Mr.
Ostrovsky, widely admired as a chamber musician, supplies a bedrock of cultivation and control.
Mr.
Krysa, who has pursued a brilliant if somewhat esoteric solo career, brings a searching interpretive intelligence.
If the group has a flaw, it lies in Mr.
Bagratuni's sometimes brusque attack.
But the overall sound is appealingly balanced and versatile.


Dance in Review
'Seraphic Dialogue'  Martha Graham Dance Company City Center
In "Seraphic Dialogue," presented by the Martha Graham Dance Company on Thursday night, Graham once more examines a woman's memories as she looks back over the stages of her life.
The subject of this 1955 dance, set to a distractingly hollow score by Norman Dello Joio, is Joan of Arc.
Fierce passion and devotion are tempered by a mood of religious contemplation.


A Company Under Investigation, But Its Shareholders Aren't Told
For nearly three years, Erly Industries of Los Angeles has endured a Federal investigation of its rice sales to Iraq, which were financed by the Atlanta branch of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the state-controlled Italian bank that is the focus of a continuing Federal inquiry.
But Erly has not formally told its shareholders of the investigation.
Gerald D. Murphy, Erly's chairman, said the investigation delayed a crucial merger between the Comet Rice unit of Erly and American Rice Inc. of Houston, which Erly also controls.
That brought American Rice's principal rice-processing plant in Freeport, Tex., to the brink of foreclosure by its banks, and pushed Erly's slender net worth so low that last November it lost its license as an approved warehouse for Federal crop programs.


Slump in Business Lending Has Prime Rate Stuck at 6%
While the Clinton Administration counts on low interest rates to revive the economy, the banking industry is coming to a different conclusion: The demand for loans to expand business activity is so weak that lowering the prime rate is not worth their while.
"Simply stated, my customers don't borrow more because we lower rates; they borrow if they see an opportunity to use the borrowed money, and they don't see that opportunity," said Frank Lourenso, an executive vice president at Chemical Bank.
His view was echoed in a half-dozen interviews with other bank executives and industry officials.


Who Says College Can Only Last Four Years?; Not at Oberlin
To the Editor:
Lest readers be misled by the news media offensive of S. Frederick Starr, Oberlin College's president -- in "Tuition Relief for the Middle Classes" (Op-Ed, Oct. 6, 1991) and now on the Sept. 29 Education page -- Oberlin College does not offer a three-year degree.
It does not plan to do so, and it does not advocate students trying to finish college in three years.


In Wake of Officer's Slaying, a Call for Calm
As investigators continued searching for leads in the killing of a housing police officer Friday night in Washington Heights, a note of conciliation was sounded yesterday in the neighborhood where he was slain, with some residents urging cooperation with the authorities, and a neighborhood priest issuing a plea for calm.
At the Church of the Incarnation, the Rev.
Msgr.
Gerald T. Walsh spoke to his congregation about Officer John Williamson, slain a few blocks from the sanctuary, and the melee that preceded his death.
"This afternoon we'll offer this Mass for two intentions," he said.
"One is for peace in the neighborhood. The other is for the soul of Officer John Williamson."


Corrections
An article on Sept. 25 about a study of women with silicone breast implants coated with polyurethane included an erroneous reference from the Food and Drug Administration to the presence of a substance called 2-toluene diamine, or TDA, in their bodies. (TDA has been found to cause cancer when fed to rats.) The study found small amounts in the women's urine, not in their blood.
An agency spokeswoman, Betsy Adams, said, however, that the substance would not be in the urine if it had not also been in the blood.
The article also misstated a finding about women without implants who were included in the study for comparison.
Small amounts of the substance were found in the urine of some of them.

'It's Not a Pleasant Feeling,' for Ex-Giant Banks
How bad were the Redskins in today's humiliating 41-7 loss to the Giants?
"We obviously got our rears kicked," said Coach Richie Petitbon.
"It was probably the longest day I've ever spent at this stadium. I think we stunk. The defense was absolutely terrible. You can pick out any areas you want. Our tackling was atrocious. Our pass rush was nonexistent and we didn't cover anything. You never expect them to be as bad as they were."

In an examination of the cozy relationship between corporate agriculture and the Federal Government, the case of Erly Industries discloses how easily a politically connected agricultural company can reap rewards by exploiting loosely managed Federal programs.

METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY  CRIME'S PLACE ON MAYORAL AGENDA
Rudolph W. Giuliani believes crime in New York City is as dire today as it was in 1989 when the crack epidemic was peaking.
Mayor Dinkins says the city is less on edge and the crime rate is down since he took office.
In their conflicting views, the two candidates for mayor lay the groundwork for sharply different proposals for combatting crime.
Law-enforcement experts say it is too soon to know whether the city is more or less dangerous than when Mr.
Dinkins was elected.
But either way, the winner of the Nov. 2 election will confront a problem whose causes, manifestations and scope have changed little in four years, they say.
A1.
FARRAKHAN USE OF STADIUM DRAWS FIRE
Mr.
Giuliani said that he strongly disagreed with the Dinkins administration's plan to allow Louis H. Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, to rent Yankee Stadium for a rally, citing Mr.
Farrakhan's past statements that many consider anti-Semitic.
But Mayor Dinkins reiterated the administration's view that the city has no choice but to make the Stadium available.

The Barkley Collapse: A Scare, but No Surgery
Charles Barkley, who carries the Phoenix Suns on his back, needs to put them down for a while.
The 6-foot-5-inch forward collapsed during an impromptu training-camp run in Flagstaff, Ariz., Saturday night, and -- although he later showered, signed autographs and barhopped -- doctors told him tonight he needs to lighten up on his vertebrae.
After a battery of medical exams here today -- magnetic resonance imaging, a CAT scan and a neurological test -- Barkely likely has what the Suns' owner, Jerry Colangelo, called a "thickening" disk tendon.

Review/Opera; Esther Lives in Modern Musical Terms
Hugo Weisgall's compositional career has been a distinguished but not a smooth one, and its course is easily traced in the three premieres given his work by the New York City Opera.
In 1959 "Six Characters in Search of an Author" was a great successs that confirmed Mr.
Weisgall's reputation as a major American composer.
In 1968, though, the premiere of "Nine Rivers From Jordan" was a fiasco.
Mr.
Weisgall was devastated.
He considered himself a "dead composer." It took years before he had the courage to write another opera.
But on Friday night, when the City Opera presented his 10th and latest opera, "Esther," as part of its World Premiere Festival, the composer's triumph could not have been more complete.
By the opera's end there was a sense of genuine excitement in the audience.
Originally commissioned by the San Francisco Opera, which withdrew from the project in 1990, the opera was resurrected by Christopher Keene for the City Opera's 50th-anniversary celebrations.

More Height Rejected for Towers in 42d St. Plan
Heeding a flurry of objections, New York State officials said yesterday that they would not allow an increase in the height of four office towers that are to rise over Times Square early in the next century.
Under an increase sought by the developers, the towers would have grown more than 100 feet each from the plans originally approved.
The tower eventually planned on the east side of Broadway, between 42d and 43d Streets, for example, would have grown to 895 feet, dwarfing One Times Square Plaza across Broadway and almost rivaling Citicorp Center, which is 915 feet tall.


Broncobusters Try New Tack: Tenderness

But this cowboy wore no spurs on his boots.
He did not bark at the horse to show who was boss.
He did not sneak around to throw a saddle on its back to climb aboard until it stopped bucking.
Instead, he offered an outstretched hand, let the horse sniff it, and then gently stroked its neck and back.

Review/Film; Vision of a Vietnam as Yet Unscarred
"The Scent of the Green Papaya" is Tran Anh Hung's tranquilly beautiful film about a lost Vietnam, a peaceful, orderly place not yet touched by wartime.
The film begins in Saigon in 1951, in a household safely insulated from the first rumblings of trouble.
The family in question has more personal problems, since these people are still mourning the death of a young daughter several years earlier, and since the husband (Tran Ngoc Trung) has a history of disappearing for long periods with his family's money.
The wife (Truong Thi Loc) endures these desertions with the stoicism the film generally ascribes to Vietnamese women.
Into this family comes Mui (Lu Man San), a lovely 10-year-old servant girl and a contemporary of the daughter who died.
The camera watches Mui contemplatively as she learns her new duties and does her hard-working best to keep her masters happy.
Mui is someone who smiles knowingly at the sight of ants lifting heavy burdens, and who communes effortlessly with the natural forces all around her.
The film works hypnotically as it gazes upon the leaves, birds, frogs and insects that are welcome parts of Mui's world.

McDowell's Cy Young-Arm Producing Nothing but Sighs
The American League Championship Series will not last long enough for Jack McDowell to keep pitching against Juan Guzman and the Toronto Blue Jays until he gets it right.
McDowell, the league's leading winner with 22 victories and its only 20-game winner, tried for the second time in the pennant playoff today, and for the second time the Blue Jays' batters battered him on their and Guzman's behalf.
Guzman, who beat McDowell in the series opener, was even better this time, permitting three hits in seven innings in a 5-3 victory that sent the four-of-seven-game series back to Chicago with a three-games-to-two Toronto lead.


Amos 'n Andy in Nikes
In 1957, the historian E. Franklin Frazier asked who represented the "manners and morals" of black people, and replied that the "black bourgeosie" exercised considerable influence.
Today the question is at the heart of a vicious clash pitting certain entertainers -- especially the hard-core rappers with their foul mouths and disdain for black women -- against the rest of us.
It is a losing battle.
As blacks have been "integrated" in the entertainment industry, the bourgeoisie has seen its impact diminish.
Whites, who in the past ignored blacks (we weren't selling then), are in control of how blacks are portrayed.
Two recent images: the rapper L. L. Cool J singing about bringing a girl to his jeep to "give it" to her "real raw"; the performer Snoop Doggy Dogg being charged with murder in a drive-by shooting.

Freud Might Frown At Psychiatrists' Role In the World of Films
Rich, vulnerable, neurotic and insecure, the movie crowd has been infatuated with psychiatry since the 1920's.
Even more significant, psychiatrists have not only cheerfully ministered to the needs of the Hollywood community, but have become part of the fabric of the town, attending parties with patients, gossiping with and about them, dating them, marrying them.
They've offered impromptu advice to patients on scripts, and have even written screenplays with them.
"It's really a subject that's been untapped," said Stephen Farber, a co-author with Marc Green of a new book, "Hollywood on the Couch: A Candid Look at the Overheated Love Affair Between Psychiatrists and Movie Makers." The book, to be published in November by Morrow, is the first to explore in detail the sometimes serious and frequently bizarre relationships between Hollywood psychiatrists and their patients.

Ozone Hole, Biosphere and the Air Around Us; Like Life in a Sub

Such chlorine is fixed as chlorides, not free chlorine gas.

Review/Fashion; From Calm to Crazed in Paris
It's possible to find calm, familiar clothes as the spring-summer collections unfold here, but it isn't easy.

Washington at Work; Respected but Sometimes Unpopular, Nunn Relishes Pivotal Advisory Role
It is a quintessential Sam Nunn moment: a difficult question on the use of American force, a restive Congress, a President struggling for consensus.
The senior Senator from Georgia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, is careful; others on Capitol Hill are calling for deadlines and a rapid withdrawal from Somalia, but not Mr.
Nunn, much to the relief of the Administration.
Still, he is raising questions about American strategy and troop deployment, not only in Somalia but also in Haiti and, potentially, Bosnia.

Fireplace Weather
It came last week, the chilly night when thousands of New Yorkers crumpled the paper, stacked the logs, reached for the matches and lit the first fire of the season.
Walking down a street of little houses was like walking through a New England town.
Stop, sniff and there it was -- wood smoke.
In New York, however, fireplaces are not unique to little houses.
They're in grand old apartment houses too, and some that are not so grand, and often they make up for rumbling pipes and drip ping faucets, patched ceilings and peeling walls.
Be cause anyone who has a fireplace has a friend.

Scars in a Proud Police Force; Troopers Come to Terms With Evidence-Tampering Scandal
More than a year after the first headlines, the pain and disbelief still show on Thomas A. Constantine's face as he talks about the worst scandal in the history of the New York State Police.
"The idea that a sworn police officer in any agency, but in this agency, would be framing people with fabricated evidence -- it's just unbelievable," said Mr.
Constantine, a 31-year veteran of the force and its superintendent since 1987.


Charlotte C. Campbell, 78, Dies; Was Leading Specialist on Fungi
Charlotte Catherine Campbell, a retired professor who advanced the knowledge and treatment of infections caused by fungi, died on Friday at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital in Boston.
A Boston resident, she was 78.
She had had a brief illness, said a spokesman for J. S. Waterman &amp; Sons funeral homes in Boston.
A specialist in medical mycology, the study of fungi, Professor Campbell wrote or was the co-author of more than 100 treatises, particularly on the causes and cures of histoplasmosis, lung diseases caused by fungus.
For her work, she received the highest award of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology in 1979.
Although she never finished her doctorate, this was one of many honors she received.

Sox Lose the Spotlight As Well as Home Games
If for no other reason, it's nice that the White Sox could win a couple of games in Toronto and remain alive long enough to return home and reclaim the American League playoffs from Michael Jordan.
Few might have noticed, but the White Sox played their first post-season games in a decade at Comiskey Park last week.
They lost both games, but worse, they lost the spotlight they deserved because Jordan chose those two days to disclose his retirement.
Jordan had a right to make that announcement any time he chose, but he played basketball for the same owner who pays Frank Thomas's and Bo Jackson's salaries.
Jordan and Jerry Reinsdorf, the owner, might have given the White Sox a little more thought and consideration.


Bridge
Many octogenarians play bridge with great skill, though whether this is because bridge keeps the mind sharp is not susceptible to proof.
An example is 85-year-old Pauline Reiner of Manhattan, who recently held the diagramed South cards in a duplicate game.
After an opening bid of one club on her right, she made a textbook overcall of three spades and was raised to game.
After the lead of the club jack, she was faced with four possible losers.
The opening bid made it probable that the crucial red kings were on her right, and she proceeded on that assumption.
East took two top clubs and led a third round, which was ruffed high.


A New Space For Theater, Art and Pie

They are lining up behind Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia and one of the policy's strongest opponents.
He plans to introduce a measure that would cut off funds for the mission, perhaps as soon as Jan. 1.

With Expectations Low, Yeltsin Arrives in Japan
After twice canceling trips to Japan, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia arrived here Monday night, as Japanese officials did everything they could to damp expectations of any progress on the territorial dispute that has soured relations between the two countries for nearly half a century.
Mr.
Yeltsin held a ceremonial meeting this morning with Emperor Akihito.
He will also hold talks with the new Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, and is seeking more financial aid and investment from Japan, which has already supplied nearly $5 billion under a strategy that calls for a "balanced equilibrium" in the improvement of relations.


Review/Film Festival; Life at a New Tempo, In Kieslowski's 'Blue'
Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Blue," the Polish director's latest French film, is about Julie (Juliette Binoche), a grieving widow and mother whose husband, "one of the most important composers of our time," and young daughter are killed in the car accident she survives.
The film, which will be shown at the New York Film Festival tonight at 6:15, is the first in Mr.
Kieslowski's trilogy "Three Colors: Blue, White, Red," in which he examines the meaning of liberty ("Blue"), equality ("White") and fraternity ("Red"), not as political or social concepts, which, he says, have already been achieved in France, but in terms of the individual.
This is a deep-dish endeavor.

Israel Selling China Military Technology, C.I.A. Chief Asserts
Israel has sold advanced military technology to China for more than a decade and is moving to expand its cooperation with Beijing, says R. James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence.
The C.I.A. assessment was provided in written responses to questions by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
The committee made the assessment public last week as part of a report on recent hearings it conducted on "proliferation threats of the 1990's," a committee aide said tonight.


In Two Counties, a Struggle to Influence Turnout
In the largely Democratic counties of Essex and Hudson, a familiar election year tug-of-war is going on: Democrats want a big voter turnout and Republicans are looking for ways to keep the turnout low.
In the past strong Democratic organizations were able to field armies of workers, their enthusiasm buoyed by thousands of dollars in "street money" to get voters to the polls.
Republicans countered with tactics such as posting poll watchers, many of them armed off-duty police officers, outside voting places, a tactic they have promised a Federal judge not to repeat.


Despite Merger, Hospitals Get a Grim Prognosis
Even as arbitragers were betting up the stocks of hospital companies last week after two giant chains, the Columbia Healthcare Corporation and HCA-Hospital Corporation of America, agreed to merge, industry executives and health economists were predicting a grim long-range outlook for both investor-owned and nonprofit hospitals.
"There will be a significant amount of hospital failures over the next 10 years," said Richard L. Scott, Columbia Healthcare's chairman.
"Society is saying it wants to limit the amount of G.N.P. that we are going to spend on health care."


U.S. Prepares to Unveil Blueprint for Reducing Heat-Trapping Gases
THE Clinton Administration is about to announce its plan for reducing the United States' emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, in accordance with the treaty it signed at last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
And though the plan is still being discussed and officials are closely guarding the details, it appears likely to rely more on carrots than on sticks in seeking to get industry to comply.
If Government officials, environmentalists and industry representatives who have been involved in creating the plan over the last six months are right, it will contain no new energy taxes, will hold regulation to a minimum and will emphasize and encourage voluntary efforts to use energy more efficiently.
The goal is to reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000 in an effort to avert a possible global warming.
The announcement of the plan is expected within the next two weeks.

Are you watching the baseball playoffs?

Remember this video privilege.
It is the last time you purists out there will get the chance.
CBS's Sean McDonough laid out the scenario Sunday night during Game 4 of the Braves-Phillies series, spoken without the derision that major league baseball's new TV plan with ABC and NBC merits.
"The plan next year is to go to simultaneous games," said McDonough, "so it's the last time for a while that you'll be able to see every pitch of every playoff game."

Campbell Revises Executives' Rules
The Campbell Soup Company, which has positioned itself as one of the few American corporations to embrace shareholder activism, announced a new executive pay plan yesterday that ties executive compensation to the company's performance and requires top officials to have a larger part of their net worth in Campbell stock.
Under the plan, between 60 and 75 percent of executive compensation would be determined by Campbell's financial performance.
And, up to 60 top executives would be required to own up to three times their base salaries in Campbell's stock, not including stock options or restricted stock.

Cadbury Picks Foote, Cone
Cadbury Beverages Inc. in Stamford, Conn., said yesterday that it had selected Foote, Cone &amp; Belding in Chicago to handle its Schweppes and Crush brands accounts, previously at Ammirati &amp; Puris in New York for almost a decade.
Though annual billings were not disclosed, industry executives who insisted on anonymity estimated them at $6 million to $8 million.
Foote, Cone already handles advertising for Cadbury Beverages brands like Canada Dry, Sunkist, Sundrop and Oasis.
It was awarded the Schweppes and Crush brands after a review that began in June when Ammirati resigned the account, citing a decline in advertising spending and changes in management at Cadbury Beverages.
Ammirati said at the time that spending had dwindled to about $2.5 million from a peak of about $6.5 million.


Aftershocks of Asbestos Mess Linger at New York's Schools

And pupils at P.S. 156 in Brooklyn are in their second school of the month and soon will be headed to a third; their own school is closed indefinitely.
Three weeks into the fall term in New York City schools, after a delayed start because of the asbestos crisis, classes are still disrupted for more than 50,000 students.
Twenty-eight elementary and junior high schools remain closed because of exposed asbestos, and another 300 schools have at least one room closed for abatement.

The Grieg Festival Quartet  Weill Recital Hall
Friday night's concert by the Grieg Festival Quartet was, on the face of it, a Norwegian ensemble celebrating the 150th anniversary of its namesake's birth.
In fact, it demonstrated how cultural imperialism inhibits the freshest of talents.
The program, including the Schumann "Marchenbilder" and Brahms's C-minor Piano Quartet, began with two of Grieg's duo works: the C-minor Violin Sonata and the A-minor Cello Sonata, both with piano.

The pleasure of "Il Tabarro" -- what could be called the essential pleasure of verismo opera itself -- lies in its opulent elaboration of low and raw events.
On Thursday night, the Dicapo Opera diminished that pleasure by replacing Puccini's late-Romantic orchestra with a meager ensemble of piano, electronic keyboard and percussion.
But the company otherwise made a decent stab at this brilliantly lurid one-acter.

Review/Music; Exploring the Terrain Between Two Worlds
Over the last 30 years, many of the attempts to merge jazz's improvisational process with European classical music have been painful failures.
Serious in all the wrong ways, the music often turned its back on jazz's functional past.
At Weill Recital Hall last Tuesday night, the composers Marty Ehrlich and Don Byron brought their chamber groups in for a concert, and for the most part the pieces avoided the drab pretension of most music working in the gray area between the two forms.
At their best they embraced humor, rhythm and lyricism, and spoke of the possibilities in literate chamber music that wasn't afraid of the richness of American popular-music tradition.
Mr.
Ehrlich's group, the Emergency Peace Ensemble, which includes Vincent Chancey on French horn, Eric Friedlander on cello and Lindsey Horner on bass, showed Mr.
Ehrlich to be one of the premier melodicists of his generation.
Even his more brittle pieces were filled with melodies that blossomed slowly, or exploded.
On "Underground Overground," he unwrapped an idea redolent with the blues that seemed to suck the air out of the room with its power.
Mr.
Ehrlich's gift for arranging kept his pieces constantly changing.
He swapped instrumental combinations, let musicians move from written sections to improvisation and back, and shifted melodies from the foreground to the background.

Florio seen at the beginning is repeated followed by the anti-tax group's phone number "Call 1-800-VETO JIM."

Gullikson Is '94 Cup Captain
The United States Tennis Association is expected to announce today that it has appointed 42-year-old Tom Gullikson to the vacant post of Davis Cup captain for 1994.
Gullikson, a member of the U.S.T.A. coaching staff since 1988 and former coach of Jennifer Capriati, never played Davis Cup but nonetheless was selected ahead of two candidates with cup experience, Stan Smith, the U.S.T.A.'s director of coaching, and Brad Gilbert, a five-year cup veteran now ranked 34th in the world.
The most controversial candidate for the post, John McEnroe, removed himself from contention last week, citing "personal considerations," but he indicated that he might be available for doubles duty next year.
McEnroe's withdrawal further simplified the selection process for the U.S.T.A. president, J. Howard (Bumpy) Frazer, who learned last month that the eight-year captain, Tom Gorman, after guiding the team to championships in 1990 and 1992, did not wish to be reappointed in 1994.

Organizing the Desktop and Having Some Fun
MOST people don't buy a key application, like a word-processing or database program, or a significant piece of hardware, like a hard-disk drive or color printer, without giving the matter some thought.
But there are things that entice them in the shop or in advertisements.
You probably won't see an ad for Mouse Tamer, made by American Business Concepts, of Dallas; an ad would cost too much for an absurdly simple device with a suggested retail price of $4.95.
It is a flexible metal post, attached to a plastic base, that holds the mouse-to-computer cord above the desktop battlefield.
This desk, like many others, is covered with computers, disk files, a modem, mice and their pads, scraps and sheets of paper, books, a coffee mug and even an ashtray.
All of these objects invite a mouse cord to twist into weird configurations.
Now they don't.
The Mouse Tamer is really better than a cordless mouse, which needs a clear path between mouse and receiver, and batteries.

Agriculture Companies Still Get Federal Business Despite Abuses

The Prodigal Returns in Greece
Few politicians have had more lives than Andreas Papandreou, the once and future Prime Minister of Greece.
Europeans remember his previous term from 1981 to 1989, when his free spending dismayed central bankers and brought Greece close to insolvency.
Americans remember him as a former U.S. citizen and an academic economist who later baited Washington.
Yet confounding odds, age, ill health and charges of corruption, Mr.
Papandreou trounced his conservative rival, Constantine Mitsotakis, in Sunday's election.
His comeback owed much to his opponent's austerity measures and to a split in the ruling New Democracy Party.
Even so, Mr.
Papandreou's victory is a remarkable personal feat -- especially since eight million voters were aware that their huge national debt was the legacy of his profligate brand of Socialism.

I.B.M. Puts More Power in PS/1's
THE I.B.M.
PC Company has once again redesigned its PS/1 family of personal computers for home and small-business users.
Although they are intended to be used in the living room or in the den, these new machines, introduced last week, have all the power and most of the features of mainstream business computers.
The new PS/1's are now set to go head to head with the Compaq Computer Corporation's new Pressario computers, which are also aimed at the home market.
But I.B.M. has gone so far in boosting the power of its PS/ 1's that many customers may be confused as to how they differ from higher-end models, including I.B.M.'s PS/ 2 and Value Point machines.


Kohl Faces Rising Storm on Choice for Presidency
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is facing the prospect of a major political defeat as criticism of his hand-picked candidate for President spreads.
The candidate, Steffen Heitmann, Minister of Justice in the eastern state of Saxony, was almost unknown when Mr.
Kohl nominated him in August.
Since then, he has made a series of remarks that have been criticized as insensitive to women, Jews, and foreigners living in Germany.


Clock Debacle Will Be Reviewed
The National Football League will review the series of events at the end of the Jets-Raiders game on Sunday, in which the game clock froze with 32 seconds to play as Los Angeles moved to the Jets' 1-yard line to set up its game-winning touchdown with 4 seconds left.
But there isn't any action the league can take that will reverse the outcome of the 24-20 loss by the Jets.
Greg Aiello, N.F.L. director of communications, said the league was talking with the game officials and the stadium clock operator, who is not a part of the officiating crew, to determine what happened.
Aiello said Jerry Seeman, the director of officiating, would determine in the next two days whether the officials erred in any way.
Seeman was in Buffalo yesterday and wouldn't be able to see film of the events until Tuesday.

Washington Opera Cancels 2 Productions
The Washington Opera has canceled the first two productions of its season, Donizetti's "Anna Bolena" and Eugen d'Albert's "Tiefland," because of a wage dispute with the musicians of the Kennedy Center Opera House Orchestra.
Martin Feinstein, the company's general director, said yesterday that the company's decision could not be reversed because cast members for "Anna Bolena," which was to open on Nov. 6, were no longer available, and because the company, unsure that there would be a contract by the start of the season, had not built sets for "Tiefland," which was to open on Nov. 13.


Jackson Plan To Stem Tide Of Violence
Warning that a "rage of violence" was overwhelming inner-city schools in New York and other cities across the country, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson yesterday proposed mobilizing the parents of students in a new, church-based program to stop it.

Jackson said at a news conference at the Canaan Baptist Church at 132 West 116th Street in Harlem.


Tough Talk by Candidates As the Parade Passes By
Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mayor David N. Dinkins moved the New York City mayoral campaign into its final three weeks yesterday with oratory as sharp and blustery as the winds whistling around them on Fifth Avenue in the Columbus Day parade that traditionally marks the electoral homestretch.
Keeping up his offensive, Mr.
Giuliani accused the Mayor of putative offenses past and present, starting with Mr.
Dinkins's visit in the 1989 campaign to a group of inmates on Rikers Island instead of a police officer's funeral.
He assailed the administration's announcement -- which City Hall later called a misunderstanding -- that a car-towing program in Washington Heights would be suspended after a police officer's slaying, and he denounced the city's processing of Louis H. Farrakhan's application to use Yankee Stadium for a rally three days before the election.

Review/Rap; Tales of Pot Smoke and Gun Smoke
The Los Angeles rap group Cypress Hill proudly unveiled a prop during its set on Wednesday night at Roseland.
A pair of fingers, thick as tree trunks, held a glowing, smoking, four-foot joint; hanging above, on a wall, was an enlarged marijuana leaf.
With songs like "I Wanna Get High" (including the line, "Tell Bill Clinton to go inhale") and "Hits From the Bong," Cypress Hill has made itself a virtual spokesgroup for the pleasures of marijuana.
Before the rappers performed, a representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws addressed the audience.
Those who thought marijuana promoted introspection and whimsy could find those qualities in Cypress Hill's music, with its rotund midtempo bass lines, lightly abrasive sound effects and the nasal, singsong vocals of its main rapper, B-Real (Louis Freese).
But the lyrics tell another story; when Cypress Hill isn't toking up, it's talking about gunplay, with blithe choruses like "Cock the hammer, it's time for action."

By Design; Jewels on the Dark Side
In a season when black is the color of fashion and jewelry is being underplayed, the most appropriate jewels to wear are black.
Black jet beads add a subtle glow to velvet, chiffon or lace for dress-up evenings.
There are Victorian-style chokers to wear with romantic blouses, long flapper-style beads to go with sexy minidresses, and stick pins and brooches for dandy jackets.
"As far as jet necklaces go, the most popular are very short or very long," said Carolee Friedlander, who designs under the Carolee label.
At Saks Fifth Avenue, 60-inch strand is $80; a six-strand choker, $125.

Stock prices of the generics have been rising all year, and they had been higher than now when Clinton Administration planners said that low-priced generic drugs would be favored as a Medicare drug benefit in the President's health care proposals.

Deal Fits Phone Company's Big Plan
Bell Atlantic's planned $1 billion entry into the Mexican wireless telephone market complements the company's technology strategy and could be the forerunner of a North American and perhaps even a pan-American wireless telephone network led by the regional Bell holding company, analysts said yesterday.
Bell Atlantic said that the Mexican venture was part of an increasingly ambitious wireless and advanced-technology program that includes the personal communications services recently authorized in the United States.
But the company said also that it was actively pursuing methods for using cable television networks for two-way communications and standard telephone lines for carrying video programming.

An Old Idea About Genius Wins New Scientific Support
AS long as there have been poets to pierce the darkness with their diamond songs, and painters to capture rays of sun shattering on cool cathedral stone, and artists of all persuasions to consort with the gods and articulate the union, there have been social critics to notice that an awful lot of these creative people are mentally unsound.
"Why is it," Aristotle asked in the fourth century B.C., "that all men who are outstanding in philosophy, poetry or the arts are melancholic?" Three hundred years ago, the English poet John Dryden wrote,
Great wits are sure to madness near allied;

Zeroing In on Distance To Solar System's Edge
REFINED analysis of spacecraft data has led scientists to change their estimate of the distance to the edge of the solar system, a boundary known as the heliopause.
In a report in the current issue of the journal Science, scientists at the University of Iowa and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., estimated that the heliopause is somewhere from 116 to 177 times farther away from the Sun than is Earth.
The previous calculations, announced in May, gave a lower estimate of 82 to 130 times.

Simms and Reeves Forged First Links While on the Links
The first time Giants Coach Dan Reeves met quarterback Phil Simms was in Hawaii in January 1992.
Reeves was there coaching the American Football Conference in the Pro Bowl.
Simms was there enjoying the sun.
The two love to play golf and Simms, after declining two earlier offers from Reeves to hit the links, finally gave in.
For his hospitality, Reeves was rewarded by Simms beating the pants off him by six strokes.
You should watch who you invite to golf games if you want to win.
But the point is the chance meeting would prove beneficial to both men.
It began the realignment of Simms's career -- putting it back on what is a potential Hall of Fame course -- and it would give Reeves some insight into Simms that would help years later when he left the Denver Broncos and entered smack in the middle of a quarterback controversy when he became coach of the Giants.

To boutique: the act of large agencies establishing smaller subsidiaries in hopes of attracting clients.
BOUTIQUE is a noun, not a verb, but Madison Avenue, which prides itself on setting trends, is hoping to change that.
Some of the nation's largest advertising agencies are seeking to rewrite the dictionary by "boutiquing" themselves, establishing spinoffs and subsidiaries to compete against small agencies that are independently owned.
As agencies within agencies, the boutiques are meant to offer more personal service to clients who prefer that top-ranking executives handle their accounts.

Critic's Notebook; France's German Renaissance
Better late than never, Paris has discovered German music.
This season, the city's musical life is dominated by the stuff, more particularly by the works of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss.
A century after France fought fiercely against an onslaught of German musical culture, it is celebrating two of the most self-consciously German of all composers.
One has to wonder if a similar slide into historical irrelevance awaits the current battle against American film, the contemporary art now perceived as the greatest threat to French cultural identity.


JWP's Bankruptcy Plan Will Put the Creditors in Control
After a year of negotiating a financial restructuring with its creditors, JWP Inc. said yesterday that it planned to file a prepackaged plan for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

JWP said it would file the bankruptcy proceeding around the end of the year.

In the Temporal Lobes, Seizures and Creativity
APART from mood disorders, other disturbances of the brain have been associated with artistic creation, in particular temporal lobe epilepsy.
In this disease, the temporal lobes on the sides of the brain, where memory and feelings reside, are intermittently seized by chaotic storms of electrical hyperactivity.
Although the seizures may be undetectable to observers, they can prompt symptoms like hallucinations, powerful religious sensations, fury, fear, joy and -- a blessing for those in the arts -- an unquenchable desire to write or draw, a desire that persists even after the seizure is over.
Seizures are different physiological events from episodes of mania or depression, but they can exert on a artists a similar sense of grandeur and mastery.
Thom Jones, whose recent collection of extraordinarily original and incantatory short stories, "The Pugilist at Rest" (Little, Brown, 1993), is a finalist for the National Book Award, said his temporal lobe epilepsy, which he traces to a brain injury suffered while boxing, profoundly defines his personality and his work.


BOY, 15, ARRESTED IN FAMILY SLAYING
A 15-year-old boy was arrested on Sunday and charged with the fatal shootings on Saturday of his father, mother and 11-year-old sister in this peaceful community of 4,000 people.
The teen-ager, whose name was not made public because he is a minor, will be arraigned on Tuesday in Wareham Fourth District Court.
A hearing will be held later to determine whether the boy will be tried as an adult.
The boy, who left the local high school last year, has been attending a private school for trouble youths.

Stewart's Time of Year Is Right Here and Now
Dave Stewart and his renowned glare will be back Tuesday night, trying to usher the Blue Jays to the World Series.

There was no glare and no Stewart today as the Blue Jays practiced at Comiskey Park in preparation for Game 6 of the American League Championship Series against the White Sox.
Instead, there was care in Stewart's eyes while he remained in Toronto to honor a commitment he made six weeks ago to assist in feeding hundreds of homeless people on Canada's Thanksgiving Day.


Hotel Sale May Signal End of Japan's Patience
At the peak of Japan's property-buying binge a few years ago, the little-known Azabu Building Company paid outrageous prices for real estate around the globe.
Now, in a potent symbol of the severity of the financial hangover afflicting Japan's property and banking industries, Azabu's main lender has said it will auction one of the company's plum properties on Hawaii and accept what will likely be a huge loss.
The Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, which poured billions of dollars into ill-conceived property loans during the 1980's, said it had filed legal papers in preparation for the auction of the Waikiki Hyatt Regency.
The bank seized the hotel after Azabu was unable to maintain its payments on a crushing debt burden said to total about $7.15 billion, a third of which is reportedly owed to Mitsui Trust.

Ozone Hole, Biosphere and the Air Around Us
To the Editor:
"Just Whose Ozone Hole Is It, Anyway?" (letter, Sept. 29) questions the belief that chlorofluorocarbons are the cause of ozone depletion above Australia.
Indeed, for many people it will be hard to imagine that there is a causal relationship between the facts that 80 percent of CFC's are emitted in the Northern Hemisphere and that the ozone hole occurs in the Southern Hemisphere.
This relationship has, however, been proved.
For a conceptual understanding, it is sufficient to go through the following:


Review/Dance; Moving Into the Future Without Losing the Past
The Martha Graham Dance Company's second and final week at City Center started off with still another startling premiere in a repertory than can no longer add new works by its founder, who died in 1991.
The most radical experiment was to invite a choreographer from outside the fold like Twyla Tharp, whose "Demeter and Persephone" finally snapped into place on Sunday afternoon.
Ms.
Tharp, accelerating Graham movement in a collage with other idioms, has brought out a new virtuosity and range in the dancers.
They, in turn, bring the kind of dramatic projection that Ms.
Tharp does not find elsewhere, and this has possibly moved her to strike out in a new direction.
The underlying logic of her highly schematic retelling of the myth of Persephone has surfaced with gusto and clarity.
In the end, the collaborative venture has been a mutual success.

Advance Made In Seeking Heavy Elements
A TEAM of Russian and American physicists has created two new forms of an exotic man-made element, and their achievement has revived a longstanding scientific dream -- the possibility of founding a family of bizarre "superheavy" elements, far heavier than any seen in nature or made in a laboratory.
Although this arcane field of research is a direct descendant of the Manhattan Project, which created plutonium fuel for atomic bombs, it probably no longer has any practical applications, say the physicists involved.
The object is purely scientific: to explore the ultimate limits of elemental matter, beyond anything seen until now.


Kevorkian Is Facing 2d Trial
Dr.
Jack Kevorkian was ordered today for the second time to stand trial on a charge of violating Michigan's law against assisting in a suicide.
The case was unlike earlier ones, in which the retired pathologist has readily admitted assisting in suicides.
This time he refused to comment, and his principal lawyer, Geoffrey N. Fieger, argued, therefore, that the prosecution had no case against him.


Haitians Block Landing of U.S. Forces
United States troops and Canadian on a United Nations mission were blocked from landing here today by armed demonstrators apparently directed by Haitian security forces who oppose the return of the ousted President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Today's actions amounted to a direct challenge to the United Nations, which negotiated an agreement in July with Haiti's military leaders.
In return for ending an oil embargo against Haiti, the settlement called for the return of Father Aristide on Oct. 30 and the creation of a 1,300-member international force to separate the military from the police and to retrain them.


Barkley Ordered to Go Slow
Charles Barkley, the Phoenix Suns' All-Star forward who collapsed during a training camp wind sprint Saturday night, returned to the team today with strings attached.
He cannot overexert himself in any of the team's drills or scrimmages and will be monitored daily.
A battery of tests Sunday and early today exposed what the team physician, Dr.
Richard Emerson, called a "thickening of soft tissue and ligaments around the nerve canal" of Barkley's L-5 vertabrae.
Wear and tear had much to do with it.
Surgery has been ruled out for the time being, and the doctor has a recommendation for Barkley: lighten up.


SCIENTIST AT WORK: John H. Conway; At Home in the Elusive World of Mathematics
DR.
JOHN H. CONWAY sits down at his computer and gets ready to log on.
But before the computer allows him to begin work, it quickly spews out 10 randomly selected dates from the past and the future, dates like 3/15/ 2005 or 4/29/1803.
Dr.
Conway has to mentally calculate what day of the week each would be before his computer lets him open a file and get to work.
It is a game he has rigged up to play with himself.
"I think I'm the fastest person in the world at this," he says.
His record is 15.92 seconds to calculate all 10 days.
But, he modestly says, it is not that hard.
"It's the kind of thing autistic kids do."

Intel's Stock Drops Despite Surge in Profits
Shares in the Intel Corporation fell nearly 7 percent today despite the company's reporting that third-quarter earnings more than doubled.
Intel shares lost $4.75, closing at $65.50 in Nasdaq trading.
Although Intel's earnings essentially matched the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, investors have grown accustomed to seeing the company exceed estimates.
And in the context of disappointing earnings news last week from other semiconductor manufacturers, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and the National Semiconductor Corporation, investors elected to sell on today's news, analysts said.
Price Cutting Is Cited
The selloff was also prompted by Intel's decision to slash prices on two models of its 486 chip, a move that analysts expect will squeeze profit margins for the next quarter or two.
Not coincidentally, the 486 is a chip being cloned by Advanced Micro Devices.


Rising Dairy Prices Helped Bolster New York Farm Profits in '92
New York farms reported profits of $622.3 million in 1992, up by 15 percent from the year before, the State Agricultural Statistics Service said today.
In 1992 New York dairy farmers rebounded from a bad year, producing 4 percent more milk than the year before, and getting a higher price for it: 29 cents a quart, up from 27 cents a quart in 1991.

CHRONICLE
Is this the final word on last weekend's Friars Club roast?
JACK L. GREEN, the dean of the New York Friars Club, a private club, issued a statement yesterday following the uproar caused by racial remarks made by the actor TED DANSON during a roast of his companion, WHOOPI GOLDBERG, held at the New York Hilton on Friday.
Mr.
Danson was criticized for some of his jokes and language and for wearing blackface.
Ms.
Goldberg herself defended him over the weekend.
In yesterday's statement, Mr.
Green said: "Although we are saddened that some people felt that remarks directed at Whoopi Goldberg were done in a seemingly racist manner, we stand by our roast format, which is legendary and has been used throughout the 89-year history of the Friars Club," Mr.
Green said.


Review/Theater: Sophistry; The Old College Days, Circa '91
In "Sophistry," a new play by Jonathan Marc Sherman at the Playwrights Horizons Studio, a popular tenured professor stands accused of sexual harassment by a male student.
Did Whitey McCoy, a homosexual and an alcoholic, force young Jack Kahn into bed late one night on Thanksgiving break, or was Jack an accomplice in his own carnal fate?
Mr.
Sherman lets the teacher and the student re-enact the incident from each of their clashing points of view, in a pair of scenes that should have a long future in acting classes (and are deftly performed here, by Austin Pendleton as Whitey and Anthony Rapp as Jack).
But no sooner does "Sophistry" start to resemble David Mamet's "Oleanna" than the university sweeps the case under the rug and the playwright does, too.
The audience never learns what happened that fateful night in Whitey's bedroom and, a few plot twists notwithstanding, soon stops caring.
At which point another play, inchoate but arresting, edges into view.


Politics in Province Hold a Mirror to Moscow
Like many deputies in the regional legislature, Oleg F. Anishchik was outraged by President Boris N. Yeltsin's order on Sept. 21 to suspend the national Parliament.
The 49-year-old chairman of the regional legislature joined his fellow legislators in condemning the order as a violation of the Constitution.
But now, after Mr.
Yeltsin has smashed his parliamentary opposition in a hail of gunfire, it is Mr.
Anishchik who is under political siege.


Starks And Mason Declare Peace

Mason said he would do the same for Starks.

Border Patrol Abuses Need Cleaning Up
To the Editor:
You report Oct. 1 that a United States border blockade between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, has enraged Mexicans, particulary workers who no longer pass between the two cities daily.
You quote El Paso's Border Patrol chief, Silvestre Reyes, attempting to defend the blockade.
Astonishingly, Mr.
Reyes states that after a rash of accusations of human rights violations committed by Border Patrol agents against immigrants and others, he wanted to find a way to rebuild community support for the Border Patrol.

Florio and Dinkins: Striking Contrasts in Campaigns
The two Democrats took office on opposite banks of the Hudson in January of 1990, facing long-simmering problems of comparable scope and scant fiscal resources to solve them, yet their responses ended up being as different as their personalities.
Gov.
Jim Florio, having promised not to raise taxes, forced a $2.8 billion tax increase through a reluctant Legislature to balance the budget and allocate education aid.

Delay on Health Care Reflects Task's Complexity
President Clinton's delay in translating the broad goals of his health care policy into a concrete legislative proposal underscores again the daunting complexity of the entire enterprise.
The delay may work to Mr.
Clinton's advantage, giving him time to build political support for his proposals before giving his critics an opportunity to attack the details.
But members of Congress are clamoring for those details now, saying that without them they cannot get on with what already promises to be a very long process in getting the legislation enacted.


On My Mind; Front-Line Dispatch
Mayor David Dinkins tells New Yorkers that crime is going down in New York City.
That's real big news because that can only be true if the street sale and use of cocaine, heroin and other drugs were legalized while nobody was looking.

I know that.
Still I thought this little dispatch might interest the exhausted relatives of addicts, anybody who encounters a mugger-junkie on the street, or other members of the politically unfashionable.

Books of The Times; Beyond Generic in Junk-Food Land
The Brothers  By Frederick Barthelme 262 pages. Viking. $21.
It's easy to describe a typical novel or short story by Frederick Barthelme: the hero is a middle-aged fellow, in the middle of a middle-age crisis; the setting is Florida or Texas or some other place along the Gulf, one of those outposts of the New South where people eat junk food, watch a lot of television and take long drives for fun; the subject is boredom or spiritual malaise, the meaninglessness of contemporary life.
Invariably, the dialogue in Mr.
Barthelme's books snaps and crackles and pops; invariably, his characters compare their lives to the lives they've seen on television.

Mr. Farrakhan's Stadium Rally
Louis Farrakhan will never win a prize for subtlety.
With his unerring instinct for promoting disruption, division -- and himself -- the leader of the Nation of Islam decided to hold a rally in Yankee Stadium three days before New York City's mayoral election.
New York does not need his racism and anti-Semitism at any time, much less on the eve of the already racially tense contest between Mayor David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani.
But to deny him the right to rent the stadium, as Mr.
Giuliani proposes, would be to deny him his First Amendment rights to free speech.
It's unlikely that a former United States Attorney really understands so little about the United States Constitution he was sworn to uphold.
More probably, Mr.
Giuliani understands the First Amendment only too well and has chosen to make political points by pretending otherwise.

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN BUCKET SLAYING OF POLICE OFFICER
A 22-year-old man who returned voluntarily from the Dominican Republic at the behest of his family and the police was arrested last night in the slaying of a housing police officer in Washington Heights last week after a confrontation between residents and authorities over the towing of illegally parked cars.
The arrest in the highly charged case came as community leaders and elected officials, including the mayoral candidates, debated the weekly towing operation that preceded the killing and has long inflamed tensions between authorities and residents of the largely Hispanic area.

In the Calm of the Clubhouse, Sox Savor a Season
Ozzie Guillen smoked a cigar and spoke proudly about what the White Sox had accomplished.
Frank Thomas smiled when he discussed the future.
Four other White Sox sat near a bucket of beer bottles, reminiscing on the last seven months.
Their season was over, but they managed to smile occasionally.
Although the White Sox lost, 6-3, to the Blue Jays in Game 6 and lost their chance to claim the American League Championship Series, they refused to criticize themselves or groan about the outcome.
What a surprise.
There were no derogatory remarks about the manager or about the team playing one man short.
None of that on the final night of the season at Comiskey Park.

A Ruling Allows Damages for Fear of High-Voltage Power Lines
Landowners whose property is seized for construction of high-voltage power lines can collect damages if the value of the rest of their property falls because of public fears about safety, New York State's highest court ruled unanimously yesterday.
The State Court of Appeals said owners seeking compensation did not need to present scientific proof that power lines pose a health risk.
But the judges said that "claimants must still establish some prevalent perception" that power lines were the reason their land was worth less.

Value-Free Examination Of the Long Goodbye
VERY few people ever see suicide notes.
Sometimes even next of kin do not want to see them and the police routinely withhold them from the press in deference to feelings of privacy, decency or perhaps deep unnamed and atavistic taboos.
But each year more than 30,000 Americans kill themselves, which is about 10,000 more than kill other people.
About 20 percent of these leave notes.
At the PPOW gallery at 532 Broadway in SoHo, Tracy Tynan and Erika Rothenberg, two artists, spent Wednesday hanging 17 messages left by suicides for their monthlong show.
They selected these from more than 100 that were made available by a source in the Los Angeles Police Department.
The artists will not say whether their acquisition was legal, but they have changed the names and rewritten the notes while trying to keep handwriting and stationery similar to the original.

Death-Penalty Feud: 2 Governors, the Law and Their Beliefs
The Governor of Oklahoma today escalated his feud with Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo over the fate of a death-row inmate, Thomas Grasso, charging that the New York Governor has placed his personal opposition to the death penalty above the law.
In a telephone conference call that he initiated with New York reporters, Gov.

Cuomo's refusal to allow Oklahoma to execute Mr.
Grasso as planned on Oct. 19 was "a bizarre demonstration that bureaucratic mumbo jumbo is more important than protecting our public."

Ball State finished 26-8 last season and was co-champion of the Mid-American Conference.


At Least Jets Can't Waste Any Leads This (Bye) Week
Even before the Jets blew a big lead for the second straight week, Coach Bruce Coslet wondered the same thing that was on every fan's mind: Is the team coasting with a big lead?
That doubt cropped up in Coslet's mind in the wake of the loss to the Eagles 10 days ago, a game in which the Jets blew a 21-0 edge.
Then, last Sunday a 17-0 lead over the Raiders ended in a 24-20 loss.
The Raiders led the game for a total of only four seconds, but it was the final four.
And this is the Jets' team that brought in those seasoned Pro Bowl veterans -- especially on defense -- to teach it how to win.

Mr.

He implied that a variety of political considerations and agendas have contaminated every aspect of police work.

The Philadelphia Eagles were playing the Jets, and for Bahr, the Giants' kicker for three years until they waived him in preseason, this was his first return to Giants Stadium.
"When I ran out under the tunnel before the game," he said, "a fan yelled 'Traitor.' I don't know what that had to do with anything, except that the rivalry between the Eagles and the Giants is so intense and the guy probably didn't like the Eagles. I enjoyed playing for the Giants, but I'm enjoying the Eagles, too. I'm just trying to make a living."

The White House announced today that major Democratic Party fund-raising events attended by President Clinton would from now on be open to the press.
The move came after reporters were barred from a fund-raising dinner held last week by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and attended by Mr.
Clinton.
A flurry of press criticism ensued, suggesting that the White House was trying to avoid public images of Mr.
Clinton mingling with major financial contributors, given his populist and reformist appeals in the 1992 campaign.


Personal Health
AMERICANS love gimmicks, especially dietary gimmicks promising that they can achieve good health without the real or imagined sacrifices involved in substantially changing their eating habits.
For decades, this tendency to bypass reality has lined the pockets of entrepreneurs who have devised weight loss schemes that attract millions looking for slenderizing miracles.
Now, with cholesterol a prominent health concern, Americans are again eagerly adopting quick fixes that suggest they can lower their cholesterol and reduce their risk of premature cardiac death without giving up their Haagen-Dazs and Big Macs.

RUSSIANS TO ELECT ENTIRE PARLIAMENT
Moving to insure a clean sweep of Moscow politics, President Boris N. Yeltsin has decreed that the upper house of the new Parliament will be elected on Dec. 12, the same day that elections have been set for the lower house.
Mr.
Yeltsin signed the decree on Monday before leaving for Tokyo.
The action appeared to be intended to further weaken the power of existing regional authorities, many of whom publicly resisted Mr.
Yeltsin's suspension of the old Parliament, which led to the showdown that ended in Russian Army tanks firing on the Parliament building to put down an armed rebellion.


Hispanic-Oriented High School in Manhattan Is Put Off Amid a Bias Inquiry
The New York City Board of Education has quietly postponed the opening of a new high school intended to emphasize Hispanic culture and bilingual learning after the United States Department of Education began investigating a legal challenge that contended the school would be racially or ethnically segregated.
A Board of Education spokesman said yesterday that the opening of the school, known as the Leadership Secondary School, had been delayed until September 1994 because officials were unable to find a site as planned on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and because one of the school's main planners resigned during the summer, throwing plans into disarray.


From Top to Bottom, Oilers Are Club Chaos
The Houston Oilers returned to the scene of the crime Monday night at Rich Stadium and repeated a much worse offense.
Ridiculed and embarrassed in a playoff loss to Buffalo last season in which their lead was the biggest ever squandered in a National Football League game, the Oilers made it much simpler this time.
They simply blew the rematch all the way around.


Judge Voids Verdicts And Drops 2d Juror In Riot Assault Trial
The judge in the trial of two black men accused of beating a white truck driver during last year's riot removed a second juror, set aside two verdicts and ordered the newly constituted jury to "disregard all past deliberations and begin deliberating anew."
Judge John Ouderkirk of Superior Court said that the jury, in just a half day of deliberations this morning, had reached verdicts on two of the 12 counts it was considering but that the removal of the juror later in the day nullified the verdicts.

Lawsuit Aimed at Coleman
The family of Amanda Santos, the 2-year-old girl whose parents say was injured by an explosive thrown by outfielder Vince Coleman, will file a lawsuit Wednesday or Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court.
The family's attorney, Darrell J. York, said today that the complaint would name both Coleman and outfielder Eric Davis, but likely would not include their respective teams at the time, the Mets and Dodgers.
The Mets have said Coleman will never again play for the team, and the Dodgers, in August, traded Davis to Detroit.

So Far, the Phillies Defy Both Logic and the Braves
It's a good thing the Atlanta Braves and the Philadelphia Phillies got a breather from their National League Championship Series yesterday.
They needed it, if only to try to figure out the total upheaval of the norm that has occurred through the first five zany games of the series.
What the two teams know for sure is this: The Phillies, fresh off two victories in three games down South, returned from Atlanta to Veterans Stadium with a 3-2 lead.
They can win the pennant with a victory in Game 6 today (Atlanta's Greg Maddux goes against Tommy Greene) or Game 7 tomorrow night (Tom Glavine against Philadelphia's Terry Mulholland).

A Senator Finds Strong Support On Health Care
Returning to the issue he brought to national prominence in 1991, Senator Harris Wofford today found strong and unexpected support among small-business men for the idea of requiring employers to pay health insurance premiums for their workers.
What the Senator heard as he flew across Pennsylvania today will surely encourage Clinton Administration health planners, who have faced sharp opposition from small business groups over the President's proposal for such a requirement.


ISRAEL SELLS ARMS TO CHINA, U.S. SAYS
Israel has sold advanced military technology to China for more than a decade and is moving to expand its cooperation with Beijing, says R. James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence.
The C.I.A. assessment was provided in written responses to questions by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
The committee made the assessment public last week as part of a report on recent hearings it conducted on "proliferation threats of the 1990's," a committee aide said on Monday.


Doctors Can't Override Dying Patients' Wishes; A Still-Valid Oath
To the Editor:

Jack Kevorkian for his role in sending 16 people suffering from depression and in some cases despair to their death.
A truly moral society should not condone or allow such actions.
Dr.

WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORP. (N)
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation said yesterday that weakness in its operating businesses led to a decline in revenues in the third quarter, but it said it was making progress in selling the assets of its failed finance subsidiary and paying off debt.
Debt was cut $500 million in the period and was at $5.9 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $8.4 billion at the beginning of the year.
The company said asset sales had allowed it to pay back $765 million of revolving credit borrowings.

Now, P.S.A.T. Means Pressure: Call It Pre-Preliminary Test Anxiety
Norman Gross thinks his daughter, Katherine, a junior at Stuyvesant High in Manhattan, is not nervous about the P.S.A.T.'s Saturday.
"My daughter's very blase," the insurance executive said.
"She tends to test well."
The P.S.A.T., created as a warm-up for the S.A.T. in the spring, is not supposed to be a nervous test.
So what if the College Board has revised these tests for the first time in 20 years?
And so what, if beginning in the 1970's, the P.S.A.T. score determined whether you'd qualify for a National Merit Scholarship?
Certainly Katherine is not going to panic just because most her friends, looking for an edge, already took the P.S.A.T. in 10th grade, as a warm-up for this warm-up.
And what if they did spend last weekend taking Princeton Review's new P.S.A.T. prep course and ordered the brand new pay-per-view P.S.A.T.-S.A.T. course on cable television?
Nervous?
Please.
"Yes, I am nervous!" Katherine said.
"I don't have my Dad's faith in me."

Camp Riley's Regimen More Like Boot Camp
Players leave the gym after morning practice -- tired and sometimes sore.
They are still required to lift weights each day.
Then after lunch and a nap, a night practice session awaits.
And don't forget, players must also learn their playbooks.
This is life at "Camp Riley," a nickname for Knicks Coach Pat Riley's grueling eight-day training camp, which began last Friday at the College of Charleston.
Riley was so eager to get started, he put the team on the floor to start practice last Friday at 12:01 A.M.
So much for easing into camp gradually.

Bell Atlantic's Chairman Remakes It for New Age
For Raymond W. Smith, the 55-year-old chairman of the Bell Atlantic Corporation, this week has been not only the culmination of his drive to reinvent Bell Atlantic, but one worthy of the most audacious of riverboat gamblers.
On Monday, Bell Atlantic announced a $1 billion deal to invest in and enlarge the biggest cellular telephone operation in Mexico.
And this morning he is announcing a deal to buy Tele-Communications Inc. and Liberty Media for $33 billion in stock and assumption of debt, making Bell Atlantic the pre-eminent player in the information age.

A Festive End to a Dinner Party And an Easy End to the Day
DINNER parties need dessert.
But sometimes, just thinking of making one is too much work.
Dessert can be bought, of course, but a homemade finish to the meal usually makes it more special.
This is a selection of desserts that can be made after work; yet, they're so pretty and appealing that they add a festive touch to dinner.
In some cases, they seem to be very time-consuming, but much of the time is spent effortlessly, in baking or freezing, tasks that can be done while guests eat dinner, lessening the time required before the party begins.


V.M.I.'s Alternative Is Slyly Feminist; A Unisex Olympics?
To the Editor:
Your thesis in "V.M.I.'s Unacceptable Remedy" (editorial, Oct. 1) is that separate but equal as inherently unequal should apply as much in gender-based cases of discrimination as it does in those that are race-based.
What are we to make, then, of such things as the Olympic Games which, with the exception of some ice-skating events, exist as completely segregated based only on gender?
Are the two separate competitions inherently unequal?
If so, who is to blame?
Is the solution a unisex Olympics?


A Decade Later, It's Torvill and Dean Again
It is early yet, but the 1990's have not been kind to comebacks.
Bjorn Borg hauled his wood racquet out of the closet and got whacked.

Magic Johnson gathered up his courage and caught flak.
Which brings us to Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, onetime darlings of the British Isles and the international skating world.

Out-of-Shape Benjamin Says He'll Help the Nets
In theory, and even on paper, the Nets received a comparable player when they traded Sam Bowie to the Los Angeles Lakers and acquired Benoit Benjamin in return.
Both centers had similar career numbers in scoring, rebounds and blocked shots.
In practice so far, it has been another story.
Benjamin, the Nets' new center, has been out of shape.

Yet today, poets and writers are in jail or exile, and on tree-lined boulevards, neon hammer-and-sickle emblems hang from the lampposts.

Review/Film Festival; Two Directing Brothers Tell Another Italian Tale
In "Fiorile," Paolo and Vittorio Taviani's sweeping and sensuous fable of how several generations of a Tuscan clan have lived out a family curse, the ghosts of the past are always threatening to jump out at its characters from the shadows of their troubled family history.
The movie, which the New York Film Festival is showing tonight at 9:30 and Saturday at noon, doesn't exactly believe in ghosts.
It is an engaging yarn that suggests how a potent legend handed down from generation to generation can become a kind of determining karmic force field.
It also affords the Taviani brothers, whose films are steeped in a love of Italian history and an identification with peasant folklore, rich visual opportunities to evoke a mythical Italian spirit that the sterile trappings of modernity only partially conceal.


GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. (N)
The General Electric Company said yesterday that 11 of its remaining 12 business units had improved earnings for the third quarter, with 7 reporting double-digit increases.
Only the aircraft engines unit reported a decline in profit, which the company said was expected.
As a result, the company reported an earnings increase of 8.6 percent for the period, despite the sale last November of its aerospace business, which earned $114 million for the third quarter last year.
The business was sold to the Martin Marietta Corporation as part of a consolidation of defense-related operations.

The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Jane Fink.

Chalk Up One for Short, Whose Haymaker Connects
Unwarranted aggression on the chessboard is dangerous.
That was the lesson Nigel Short taught Gary Kasparov in Game 16 of their world championship match yesterday in London.
The Russian strained for attack, but succeeded only in weakening his position, and the Englishman meted out the punishment swiftly and mercilessly.
This was the first game Short had won in the series, but as cheering as it might be, it won't get him back in contention.
He trails Kasparov by 5 1/2 to 10 1/2, and the champion needs just two more points to win the 24-game contest.

A Surge in Advocacy Within Parent Groups; P.T.A.'s Shift From Bastions of the Status Quo to Challengers of Authority
Until recently the parents at Public School 154 in Flushing, Queens, played little role in school life, split as they were into immigrant groups from 20 countries and harried by the demands of their jobs.
But last month, after school officials ordered P.S. 154 closed and the children bused elsewhere until the building was certified to be free of asbestos, parent leaders blanketed the neighborhood with pamphlets printed in Chinese, Spanish, Arabic and Farsi, rallying scores of parents to a school boycott.

Wal-Mart Loses Suit On Pricing
Wal-Mart Stores, which grew into the nation's largest retailer by dominating small markets and undercutting local merchants' prices, was found by an Arkansas judge yesterday to have illegally sold some merchandise below cost in an attempt to drive local competitors out of business.
Chancery Judge David Reynolds said Wal-Mart had engaged in "predatory pricing" and he ordered it to pay more than $298,000 in damages to three Conway, Ark., pharmacies, which had sued under the Arkansas Unfair Practices Act.


Sihanouk Calls His Cancer Unthreatening
King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia said today that a tumor removed near his prostate gland in China last week was cancerous but that the cancer had not spread and was not life-threatening.

G.I.'s Pinned Down in Somalia, Not Able, for Most Part, to Patrol
The sprawling, sandy compound that houses thousands of United States forces is still a base besieged, with all but a few troops forbidden to leave the shelter of sandbags and coiled concertina wire to patrol Somali streets.
For nearly a week, the opposition forces loyal to the faction leader Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid have withheld attacks against American troops.
But snipers opened fire overnight Monday on two strongpoints held by Pakistani peacekeeping troops.
The United States and United Nations military officials point to those attacks as an indication that the capital remains anything but secure.

Germany is the only member that has not formally ratified the treaty, which was negotiated in the Dutch town of Maastricht at the end of 1991 and has been a rallying point for fears that closer unity would submerge separate European national identities.

Homer and More for Newson
Bo Jackson predicted it.
Before the ninth inning, Jackson said he told Ellis Burks that Warren Newson would hit a home run because his wife and infant daughter were watching him for the first time this season.
Jackson was right.
Newson, the designated hitter, homered off Duane Ward.
It was a sweet moment for the Newson family because his wife, Tina, was unable to attend any games after being involved in a serious automobile accident in April.
Tina was a passenger in a vehicle driven by her mother in Mexico.
She was pregnant at the time, and labor had to be induced.
Although Tina still undergoes therapy for her injuries, Newson said his wife and daughter, Quadri, are doing fine.

Review/Theater; Warring Couple's Barbed Romance
Whatever its title may promise, "Mixed Emotions," the mild-mannered comedy by Richard Baer that opened at the John Golden Theater last night, is a single-note play.
Like the sitcoms it often resembles, it seems by its very predictability designed to soothe: its outcome is never to be doubted, nor do its characters, who are largely the sum of their one-liners, ever surprise us.
The story of the bumpy courtship of a Manhattan widow and widower, "Mixed Emotions" establishes its basic comic rhythm, which has the hypnotic quality of a Ping-Pong match, early on.
Within the first quarter of the performance a feeling descends that one could leave the theater and return at any time, assured that the jousting couple would be having the same barb-swapping argument, ringing minimal variations on jokes they have already told.
Indeed, the play often gives off a bizarre sense of existing in the ever-genial, repetitive eternity of television syndication.

The new battlegrounds are elementary school self-esteem programs whose imaginary central characters include a blue dragon named Pumsy and a dolphin named Duso.
Local groups, relying in many cases on information distributed by conservative religious organizations, have challenged "Pumsy in Pursuit of Excellence" in at least 35 school districts around the country, said Matt Freeman, a spokesman for People for the American Way.

Mexican Border Utility Deal Fizzles
An American utility company's plans to invest in and operate a huge $1.8 billion power plant in Mexico have collapsed after complaints that the plant might pollute a national park in Texas and amid differences with the Mexican Government over the terms of the deal.

The talks broke down nearly a year after the sides had initially agreed on terms for the plant's sale.

Bid to Restore Haiti's Leader Is Derailed
The two-year-old effort to restore the elected President of Haiti to power was close to collapse today as the United States pulled a troop ship away from Haitian shores and called on the United Nations to renew economic sanctions against the military Government.
Faced with the refusal by authorities in Port-au-Prince, the capital, to allow a ship carrying American and Canadian military engineers and instructors to dock, and with violent demonstrations by Haitians on shore, Administration officials ordered the ship back to sea and said a second troop ship scheduled to leave for Haiti Wednesday would not depart.

On street corners, in catering halls, in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx, the New York City that Rudolph W.

In a marked shift since his soft-focus speeches of last spring, Mr.
Giuliani in recent weeks has taken a tough new stump speech to the people of New York, presenting the city as a troubled place where standards of civility have been steadily eroded.


Review/Film Festival; A Walter Mitty Dreams of Fame on Football Field
Some people dream of being rock stars, others Nobel Prize-winning authors.
The dream of Daniel E. (Rudy) Ruettiger (Sean Astin), the central character of David Anspaugh's film "Rudy," is only a little more down-to-earth, given the odds against him.
Physically small and a mediocre student, he lives to play football for Notre Dame.
Set in the 1960's and based on a true story, "Rudy" is a reasonably convincing study of a young man's obsessive quest for the nearly impossible.
Directed by Mr.
Anspaugh with the same rah-rah fervor he brought to "Hoosiers," the film also offers a knowing glimpse of working-class life in Joliet, Ill., the steel-mill town where Rudy grows up.

North Korea Assails Atomic Unit, Asks U.S. Talks
In its continuing campaign to avoid international inspections of suspected nuclear weapons, North Korea issued a blistering attack today against the International Atomic Energy Agency and said only direct talks with the United States could resolve the crisis.
The broadside, issued in the name of North Korea's Minister of Atomic Energy and carried by the official news agency, described a bizarre plot that it said was intended to discredit the country.
The plot involved a letter North Koreans said was a forgery by the International Atomic Energy Agency that suggested North Korea was developing nuclear bombs.

Train Delays Likely After Fire in Grand Central
Grand Central Terminal was closed last night after a fire that started on an unused train track spewed thick smoke throughout the lower level of the station, delaying more than 10,000 commuters who had to scramble for alternative routes home, said a spokesman for the Metro-North commuter railroad.
With the railroad's signal and communications system knocked out by the fire, all Metro-North trains in and out of Grand Central Terminal were suspended after 8 P.M.
Early today, Metro-North officials said the signal system was largely restored on all three of the railroad's lines late last night, but they added that some gaps remained.

A Talent for Rewriting History
Two iconoclasts who practically reinvented the field of economic history, Robert W. Fogel of the University of Chicago and Douglass C. North of Washington University in St.
Louis, won the 1993 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday, the first time the prize was awarded for work in economic history.
"Bob and Doug are clearly the leaders of the new economic history, the most visible, the ones with the most impact," said Peter Temin, an economic historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.


German Tells Why He Stabbed Seles
GUNTER PARCHE, an unemployed lathe operator, testified yesterday at his trial in Hamburg, Germany, that the losses of STEFFI GRAF left him so devastated him that he sometimes lost the will to live.

He is charged with causing grievous bodily harm and could face five years in prison.

In the Fall, Blue Jays Migrate Back to World Series
With the help of the bat and body of Pat Borders, his catcher, Dave Stewart extended his remarkable run of playoff success tonight and in the process propelled the Toronto Blue Jays and the country of Canada into the World Series for the second successive season.
Despite some erratic touches in his pitching repertory, the battle-hardened Stewart allowed only four hits in seven and one-third innings as the Blue Jays defeated the Chicago White Sox, 6-3, and won the American League Championship Series, four games to two.

U.S., Praising China, Is Still Wary on Rights
The State Department's top human rights official emerged from two days of talks with Chinese officials today praising the resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing after a two-year hiatus, but reporting no progress on improving China's overall record.
At a news conference, the official, John Shattuck, gave a positive account of China's "attentiveness" in the talks, which he called "intensive" and which he said have set the stage for more blunt discussion when President Clinton meets the Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, next month in Seattle.


Manhattan Minstrel Show
The rhetoric of race is treacherous.
Its history is a thorny one.
And racially freighted language takes nearly all its meaning from the context in which it's spoken.
The word "nigger" is a stark example.
Spoken by someone black, it can pass as a simple greeting or even a term of endearment.
Spoken by someone white, the word is almost universally heard as an insult.
Like it or not, blacks have carved out a historical exemption allowing raw talk about race -- though primarily among themselves.
Whites who infringe inevitably take some heat.

Bulgur: Going Beyond Tabbouleh
BULGUR, or cracked wheat, is best known to Americans in the form of tabbouleh, a cold dish of bulgur with tomatoes, parsley, mint, olive oil and lemon juice.
But bulgur is used in dozens of Middle Eastern dishes and makes an especially nutritious alternative to recipes that ordinarily call for rice or pasta.
It has an additional advantage: it cooks very quickly.

Review/Music; Dissection of the German Lied
It is interesting to note how susceptible society can be to a simple calendar hanging on the wall.
As the 19th century rushed to a close, cultural life rushed in pursuit.
Music, in particular, seemed anxious to wind up 80 years of feverish activity and rebuild from the ruins of Romanticism.
The year 1993 may be a bit early to look past our current chaos in musical life, but perhaps by 1997 the prospect of a two followed by three zeroes will mesmerize us equally.
A Sunday afternoon of talk and music at the Kathryn Bache Miller Theater scrutinized a microcosm of history's proneness to punctuality, its tendency to change according to the numbers.
Lectures by Michael P. Steinberg, Mark Anderson and Walter Frisch, and then a recital by the mezzo-soprano-and-pianist duo of Milagro Vargas and Gilbert Kalish were grouped under the title "Words Into Song: The German Lied at the Fin de Siecle."


A Director Asks for Odd and Gets It
Two years ago, the film director Peter Weir bought a plane ticket to travel from his home in Sydney, Australia, to Los Angeles because the scripts he had been receiving from Hollywood studios were so appalling.
"I couldn't understand the poor quality of the screenplays and I wanted to tell the studio heads that if these are the best you have, then send me things that you consider in raw shape, give me the broken ones, the sad cases, the ones in the too-hard file," Mr.
Weir, the highly successful director of films like "Witness," "Dead Poets Society" and "Green Card," explained last week in an interview.

2 Indicted in Swastika Case At High School Track on L.I.
Two 18-year-old men were arraigned today on charges that they painted swastikas and anti-Semitic messages of hate on a Commack, L.I., high school track just hours before they and their classmates were to attend graduation ceremonies there.
The defendants, Robert Rolston and Philip Argiros, both of Commack and both now in college, pleaded not guilty to charges of criminal mischief and making graffiti.
The criminal mischief charge, a felony, carries a prison term of up to seven years.
Judge Arthur G. Pitts of Suffolk County Court ordered the two men released on $2,500 bail for a court appearance on Nov. 18.


Lapse in Sounding Alarm Is Linked to Derailment
A towboat pilot was lost in a predawn fog without a compass or nautical charts when his vessel rammed a railroad bridge, but he could have still averted the worst wreck in Amtrak's history if he had promptly notified the authorities, Coast Guard and Amtrak officials told Congress today.
A high Amtrak official said that had anyone on the towboat Mauvilla reported the accident immediately, the freight railroad that owned the bridge and tracks would have had enough time to send a signal to stop the train, or make radio contact with it in time for the engineer to halt it.


Arafat Names Loyalists to Carry Out Accord
Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has taken firm command of the peace talks with Israel, placing loyalists in charge of key committees and eliminating opponents in a purge that has shaken the P.L.O.

Low Fat and Lots of It From Prudhomme
PAUL PRUDHOMME was tooling around Tavern on the Green in Central Park on his motorized scooter earlier this month.

The larger-than-life impresario of Cajun cooking became a household name in the 1980's when he persuaded Americans to gobble up his spicy food that was bubbling in butter and sizzling in lard.

Judges Hear 2 Bias Laws Assailed In Trenton
The New Jersey Supreme Court heard attacks today on two of the state's anti-bias laws and indicated that recent rulings by the United States Supreme Court could make survival of the statutes in their present form a close call.
The laws are a 1981 statute that makes the placing of a symbol, like a swastika or a burning cross, on another's property a crime if it exposes the victim "to threats of violence or hatred" based on race, color or creed, and a statute enacted in 1990 that allows sentencing judges to increase penalties for crimes like assault if they were committed because of the victim's race, color, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.


Is Women's Health Harmed By Medical Specialization?
Medical care for most men is one-stop shopping: a trip to a general doctor for a physical examination that includes full preventive care.
But that approach works poorly for a woman, new studies have shown, with tests like Pap smears often overlooked, particularly if the doctor is a man.
In practice, many women insure complete care by making the medical rounds: they visit a generalist, a gynecologist for Pap tests and maybe even a breast cancer specialist for breast examinations and mammograms.
Now many public health experts are saying that there must be a better way.

Campaign Finance Chicanery
When he agreed to participate in New York City's voluntary public campaign financing system, Mayor David Dinkins pledged to limit his general election spending to $4 million -- the same limit that covers his Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph Giuliani.

Unfortunately, principle hasn't deterred the state Democratic Party chairman, Al Gordon, from spending $500,000 on a radio advertising and direct-mail campaign in support of Mr.
Dinkins's candidacy -- brazenly trashing the spirit if not the letter of the city's campaign finance rules.

Easing the Release of Information
With fanfare, Attorney General Janet Reno has proclaimed a new, liberalized set of rules for the release of information under the Freedom of Information Act.
Backed up by President Clinton, she declares that the Justice Department won't routinely defend in court agencies that try to use the law's technicalities to sit on secrets.
The fanfare is appropriate, even if Ms.
Reno's proclamations have yet to be tested in the trenches of government.
Her new rules completely reverse a 1981 Reagan Administration directive to stonewall Information Act requests whenever there was "a substantial legal basis" for invoking one of the law's exemptions from disclosure, even when the release wouldn't hurt anyone.

The television footage out of Haiti is like a scene from a recurring nightmare: the brandished weapons, the ugly insults, the violent attacks on bystanders.

The latest object of their ire is the amphibious ship Harlan County, which was supposed to unload an "observer" contingent of some 200 American and Canadian troops.
Yesterday, the Pentagon ordered the ship to leave Haitian waters.

Review/Film Festival; Another Making of a President, Starring the New Spin Doctors    SUB FOR PAGE C15
Is there any stone left unturned in a modern Presidential campaign?
When every last whistle-stop and handshake is thoroughly documented in print and on television, can there be anything more for a film maker to find?
When D. A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus set out to chronicle the Clinton campaign, they were treading on familiar territory, taking on a seemingly redundant task.
And yet "The War Room," their glimpse of behind-the-scenes maneuvers among Clinton strategists, finds new facets of the story and manages to coax cliffhanging suspense out of a fait accompli.
However much "The War Room" reveals about how Mr.
Clinton won the election, its real subject is why he won.
The true focus of this watchful, frankly admiring film is the Clinton campaign staff, with James Carville and George Stephanopoulos receiving star billing.
The film presents these two as tireless new-breed strategists whose fast, aggressive tactics helped to reshape their party's political thinking, and who themselves played a high-profile role in the election.
Theirs was an attitude that promised something different in Presidential politics, and this film examines that attitude in riveting detail.

Supreme Court Roundup; Justices to Rule on Challenges by Career Criminals
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether Federal defendants who face sentencing as career criminals can challenge the validity of the earlier state court convictions that subject them to stiff Federal minimum sentences.
Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, a person with three previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses must receive a sentence of at least 15 years, with a maximum of life in prison, if subsequently convicted of owning or transporting a gun.


Joseph Moller, 93, a Decorated World War II Pilot

From Downcast to Upbeat at Lotus
It was two years ago this month that a group of angry Lotus Development engineers held a meeting so gloomy it amounted to a funeral.
The deceased: Lotus's spreadsheet program 1-2-3 for Windows, which had been shipped a month earlier amid dismal reviews.
The band of programmers said that upper management, desperate for a product that would work with the increasingly popular Windows standard, had forced them to rush to market with software that simply was not ready.
Many customers, apparently sharing that belief, bolted for Excel, the Windows spreadsheet from Microsoft.


No Headline
New Material Girl
Remember Madonna?
The entrepreneur, book subject, actress and singer recently seemed to be slipping out of her dominant position in the pop world; not too many public spats, financial or physical disclosures or new records, books or movies.
But if anybody was wondering if the Material Girl still had any drawing power, her three shows this week at Madison Square Garden, boasting a top ticket price of $75, sold out in less than an hour, and that's with only some radio promotion and a Madison Square Garden advertisement in The New York Times.
Given that her last record, "Erotica," was a commercial disappointment, that's not bad.
Even if her celebrity is based more on the creation of a self-image than on musical virtuosity, her reputation as a ferocious live performer clearly precedes her.

Nothing Diabolical About 4-0 Devils
There is no comparison between the John MacLean of this season and last.
The most proficient clutch player in Devils history is miles ahead from where he was at this time last season upon his return from reconstructive knee surgery that threatened his career.
A quick glance at the way MacLean skates and shoots and executes hockey's intricate other little skills now erases any doubts that, as some of his friends and teammates put it, "Mac is back."


60-Minute Gourmet
SEA scallops are plentiful and sweet at this time of year, especially those from the chilly waters of the North Atlantic.
And for the first time in nearly a decade, the harvest of bay scallops has been sizable off Long Island's East End and in other East Coast breeding grounds.
A disastrous brown tide that first appeared in the mid-1980's all but wiped out bay scallops in the Northeast, and it has taken years for their seedbeds to regenerate.
Bay scallops are still quite expensive owing to their relative scarcity, however, so the recipe here is designed to work well with either type.

Clinton Will Recommend More Spending Cuts
President Clinton plans to propose an additional $10 billion to $15 billion in spending cuts later this month to make good on promises he made to win votes for his budget package in August, Administration and Congressional officials said today.
The new package of cuts, which will be spread over the next five years, is bound to create a storm on Capitol Hill, several lawmakers said.
Some members of Congress think the anticipated package is too small, while others suggested that the proposed reductions would cause howls of protest from lawmakers whose favorite programs would come under attack.


How to Get Tough With Haiti
The thugs who prevented U.S. and Canadian troops from landing in Haiti on Monday do not represent the majority of the Haitian people.
The country's voters made their choice three years ago when they elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide with a 65 percent majority.
The military elite, accustomed to unquestioned power, drove him into exile.
Now that elite, aided by its paramilitary "attaches," is invoking nationalist pride and characterizing the U.N. mission to restore President Aristide as a foreign invasion.
The attaches, who prevented a U.S. troopship from landing and threatened the U.S. charge d'affaires on Monday, kept at it yesterday by menacing a television crew with machine guns and preventing children from attending school.


Elias Is a New Breed of Celebrity for Princeton

The football team is winning and Elias has had plenty to do with that.
Much of the football tradition here, at the sport's birthplace, had faded in the 1970's, with the most telling statistic being 14 straight losses to Yale, the foremost rival, between 1967 and 1980.

Moscow Police Wage War on Crime
Empowered by an eight-day-old state of emergency, the Moscow police are using their extra powers as part of a wider crackdown on crime to conduct raids aimed at non-Russian minority groups throughout the city.
According to complaints registered at local embassies of former Soviet republics and at the local office of Helsinki Watch, a human rights organization, police have staged nighttime sweeps of hotels, dormitories and apartments frequented by visitors from the Caucasus and Central Asia, and in cases when permits are not in order, forced them out of town, in some cases even paying their fare.


Bridge
One of the most difficult areas of slam bidding is to determine when agreement on a trump suit should end in disagreement.
If hearts have been bid and raised, for example, it is hard to adjust to the possibility that it could be right to play in spades, diamonds, clubs or no-trump.
Some players never make that adjustment.
One reason for such a shift is to reach a more productive trump suit, perhaps 4-4 rather than 5-3.
Another is to place the declaration in the hand that is protected against a damaging lead.
An example is the diagramed deal, which was played on Thursday in the Autumn Leaf Regional Championships in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y.

AT HOME WITH: Reno; When a Good Enemy Is Hard to Find
RENO doesn't blush, but her blaring voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper as she comes out of the musical closet and admits that her taste is strictly white bread.
It is a rare confession for the monologuist, whose hyperkinetic rejection of her suburban roots made her a comedic sensation in the late 80's, but it underlies the paradox of her current position.
In a meteoric rise from the downtown New York club scene, she became an antihero of the Reagan-Bush era by rejecting anything to do with fame and money and by unmercifully haranguing their pursuers: politicians, parents, yuppies, Wall Street wizards, women who dress for success -- "Like, I'm supposed to be intimidated by someone who looks like Bozo," she had said.

Maple Leafs Move to 4-0 Mark  Rob Pearson and Wendel Clark each scored twice as the undefeated Maple Leafs crushed the winless Washington Capitals last night in Toronto.
Peter Zezel, Dave Andreychuk and Nikolai Borschevsky scored Toronto's other goals.
Toronto (4-0) is off to its best start since 1944-45, when that season's lineup started 6-0 and went on to win the Stanley Cup.
Ted Kennedy was a member of that team and was on hand for a pre-game ceremony during which banners were raised bearing the jersey numbers of Kennedy and Syl Apps.
Keith Jones scored for the Capitals, who at 0-5 are off to their worst start in 10 years. (AP) Whalers 4, Canadiens 3: Geoff Sanderson had his second straight two-goal game and Pat Verbeek and Robert Kron also scored as the Whalers rallied for three goals in the third period and edged the Montreal Canadiens in Hartford.
Sanderson, who has five goals in four games, snapped a 2-2 tie with a short-handed goal at 6 minutes 50 seconds of the third period.
Just 2:30 earlier, Verbeek had drawn Hartford even with a quick wrister from the low slot.
Kron capped the third-period uprising with his first of the season at 8:21, a tap-in from the right post off a feed from Randy Cunneyworth.
Rookie Chris Pronger had two assists for Hartford. (AP)

The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl; Riefenstahl, in a Long Close-Up
Ray Muller's "Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl" is a big, long (over three hours), sometimes clunky but consistently fascinating documentary portrait of the woman most easily identified as Hitler's favorite film maker, with good reason.
Ms.
Riefenstahl's two outstanding films, "Triumph of the Will" (1935) and "Olympia" (1938), for all of their esthetic glories, served the propaganda machine of National Socialism in ways that probably neither Hitler nor Ms.
Riefenstahl could have foreseen.
The films gave Hitler a credibility at home and around the world that nothing else produced by a German artist in the 1930's ever achieved.
It was Ms.
Riefenstahl's fate not only to survive the war, but also to live on and on and on.

The conclusion is all but inescapable: Sid Fernandez will not pitch for the Mets in 1994.
Saying that "the days of lip service and flexibility are over," Fernandez's agent, Tom Selakovich, gave the Mets a contract figure more than 10 days ago.
The Mets, saying "no player is more important than the club," haven't responded.

Jets Win Argument, But Still Lose Game
The loss wasn't reversed, but the Jets gained a measure of satisfaction yesterday when the National Football League admitted there were errors by the clock operator and an official on the field at the end of Sunday's game against the Raiders in Los Angeles.
The problems developed after the Raiders, who trailed by 20-17 with no timeouts left, moved from their 7 to the Jets' 7 with 32 seconds left.
The first error was made by the clock operator, who did not start the clock on the next play, Vince Evans's 6-yard pass to Tim Brown at the Jets' 1. (The scoreboard clock is supposed to be synchronized with the official time kept by the line judge.)

Conners to Return to Yanks
The looting of the Yankee coaching staff is expected to begin today or tomorrow when the club announces that Billy Conners, the Chicago Cubs' pitching coach who held the same job with the Yankees, has been hired to replace Tony Cloninger, who was the pitching coach last season.
While General Manager Gene Michael refused to confirm what has been speculation for weeks, a Yankee official said the announcement could occur within 48 hours.
Another American League general manager said the Yankees had dismissed four coaches, likely meaning that first-base coach Frank Howard, bullpen coach Mark Connor and bench coach Ed Napoleon will join Cloninger in the unemployment line.
Since Manager Buck Showalter had already conceded that the Yankees would trim their staff from seven coaches to six, Jake Gibbs was already believed to be relieved of his coaching duties.

Mr.

While no charges were filed against the 10 administrators -- nine principals and an assistant principal -- Mr.
Fernandez dismissed them because of accusations that the district's entire hiring process was corrupt.

Tiny Gardens Lush With Memories
THROUGH her miniature gardens, Dieta von Matthiessen keeps her childhood memories alive: the faraway lands of bedtime stories, the family vacation to the Yucatan and the exploration of brooks, woods and a forbidden swamp at a 250-acre farm in Brewster, N.Y., that she and her two siblings called home.
Through a vivid imagination nurtured by nature, Ms. von Matthiessen transforms pine-cone chips into cottage shingles, moss into shrubbery and wire into hand-wrought iron for her interpretations of lush gardens, many of them designed by Russell Page or Fletcher Steele.
Unlike theirs, her gardens tend to be less than a foot in diameter; some even fit into a saucer or tea cup.
She once created a rose tree in an antique red glass salt dish for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

Critic's Notebook; This Jewish Mom Dominates TV, Too
Of the relatively few stereotypes that have slipped past political-correctness watchdogs in recent years, none has more stamina than the exaggerated Jewish mother, a stock character once again very much in vogue in prime-time entertainment.
The British music hall once had its bandylegged, boozy Irish Paddy.
Today's television seems curiously partial to neurotically overprotective, brash and often garish mothers of the unmistakably Jewish persuasion.
One reason may simply be Oedipal revenge.
From "Seinfeld" to "Mad About You," many of the writers and performers are Jewish.
Perhaps this is one way to get back at Mommy.
Viciously?
No.
Most of the characterizations are rooted in fondness, albeit backhanded and very wry.

Economic Scene; The health care plan could worsen injury-claim abuses.
BILL CLINTON'S health care plan makes a cautious stab at curbing malpractice suits, reducing the incentives to go to court and forcing those injured to try mediation first.
So there is at least a hope that the total cost of the accident liability system, which runs $130 billion a year in insurance premiums, will fall.
Right?
Don't spend the savings just yet.
Peter Huber, a legal scholar, points out that the medical malpractice slice represents no more than one-eighth of the total tort liability pie.
And there are good reasons to believe that the President's plan would inadvertently fatten the other seven-eighths.

Health Reform Must Include Abortion; Catholics in Exile
To the Editor:
During the recent visit of Pope John Paul II to the United States, discussions on disaffected Catholics failed to mention those who think of themselves as "Catholics in exile." These are families who responded to Pope Pius XII's call for "responsible parenthood" via "the observance of infertile times" and "the use of natural temporary sterility" and for whom this method failed repeatedly for biological reasons: unclear or recurring fertile signs within the monthly cycle.

It had produced the game's best record, and it had developed a kind of corporate cool, its players practiced in miracles and spectacularly deep in talent.
In the end, though, the Braves again turned out to be inadequate.
Their 104 triumphs, historic and heroic, were rendered an exasperating tease.
The spending and the strategizing couldn't buy or engineer a world championship.
It is now three years of almost, and the hurt and questions only grow.

Five years after hitting such a nadir that not even the hungriest of free agents wanted to put on the uniform, one year after finishing a humbling last in the National League East, 25 Phillies finally got to say last night that all things considered, they'd rather be in Philadelphia.
Because Philadelphia is where the National League pennant now flies.
And where a World Series game will be played for the first time in 10 years, thanks to the Phillies' most improbable National League Championship Series victory, four games to two, over the Atlanta Braves.


Bloody Prints in Oslo
It could be a coincidence that a Norwegian publisher and friend of Salman Rushdie was shot from behind three times outside his home near Oslo, and that the tires of his car were also slashed by a would-be robber.
But the attempted murder of the publisher, William Nygaard, has the same marks of a contract hit as did the fatal stabbing in 1991 of Mr.
Rushdie's Japanese translator and the knife attack on the Italian translator of his novel "The Satanic Verses."
The long arm in these cases most likely belongs to the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose rulers hate both Mr.
Rushdie and the Israeli-P.L.O. accord that Norway helped nurture.

Inspectors Are Accused Of Extortion
The commanding officer of the unit that enforces sanitation laws in midtown and lower Manhattan and 10 current and former inspectors were accused yesterday of extorting between $5,000 and $10,000 a year each from shopkeepers, restaurant owners and street food vendors.
"I used my summons book like a gun to get money," said the commander of the Sanitation Department unit, Lieut.
Rayman Rahim, after he was arrested yesterday, according to Peter Benjaminson, a spokesman for the Department of Investigation.

Showing Off Big Plans for Recycled Paper
PEOPLE who live in glass houses should throw no stones, according to an oft-repeated saying.
But what about those in paper ones?
They have no more to worry about than residents of frame houses, said Stanley Shetka, who creates bricks and other building materials from old newspapers, milk cartons, magazines, telephone books and soap boxes.
Mr.
Shetka's work will be part of the "Paper Futures" exhibition at the Minneapolis Institute of Art from Oct. 22 through Jan. 2.

Linoleum Turns Into Vegetables
WHEN the kitchen floor in Kevin Gavin's Manhattan apartment needed a little sprucing up, he decided against replacing the linoleum.
He remembered the trompe l'oeil throw rug he had seen in a friend's kitchen and asked its designer, Laura Brandt, to paint his entire floor.
Ms.
Brandt, an oil painter who usually creates still lifes, thought Mr.
Gavin might like a design with instruments, since he is a composer and music producer.
Instead, he opted for a vegetable motif she had also designed.


Delays in Grand Central Fire Laid to Crippling of 3 Systems
The Metro-North Commuter Railroad was crippled Tuesday night and early yesterday morning because a fire in a shed at Grand Central Terminal knocked out or heavily damaged three systems that are supposed to back up each other: radio, telephone and signal-control equipment.
The fire occurred after years of work by Metro-North to improve the reliability of its signal and communications systems.
Communications cables run down each side of Metro-North's right-of-ways, eliminating the possibility that damage to one cable will cut off communications.
To further increase reliability, the railroad has been burying the cables.
But the cables all come together at the communications headquarters, a room built in 1988 at the terminal to allow automation of the railroad.

Rivers Gets Ready For Rigors Of Season
According to Pat Riley, Doc Rivers was in the best shape of any Knick reporting to training camp.
Impressive, considering Rivers turned 32 years old today.
Yet the big question concerning Rivers is this: can he finish the season as healthy as he is now?
During last year's Eastern Conference finals, Rivers showed the wear and tear of a long season handling the majority of minutes at point guard.
He played with torn ligaments in his right thumb and cracked ribs during the playoff series against Chicago.
And Rivers admitted that the injuries kept him from performing the way he wanted.

U.S. Is Reported to Be Seeking An Informal Truce With Somali
The White House's special representative in Somalia said today that the United States was seeking an informal truce in its undeclared war with Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid that would make it possible to begin withdrawing American troops by early next year.
Speaking to reporters, the White House envoy, Robert B. Oakley, also said he would not rule out a meeting with General Aidid.
Nor, he indicated, would the United States try to prevent the general from becoming president of his country in the future.


32,000 New Yorkers Vote on Puerto Rico
Nearly 32,000 New Yorkers of Puerto Rican background turned out last week for a symbolic vote on whether Puerto Rico should remain a commonwealth of the United States or seek statehood or independence, it was announced yesterday.
The vote, held over three days ending last Saturday, drew only a fraction of the estimated 300,000 Puerto Ricans who are registered to vote in New York City.
But its organizers said the turnout of 31,746 people exceeded their expectations given the logistical problems of the unprecedented vote.


Giants' Thornton Has Mild Stroke
Giants defensive lineman George Thornton apparently suffered a minor stroke early this morning as a result of severe hypertension, or extremely high blood pressure, according to the team physician, Russell Warren.
Thornton is in stable condition at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and the prognosis for him returning to football this season is good, team officials say.
The 300-pound Thornton was picked up off waivers before the start of the regular season after he was released by the San Diego Chargers.
Thornton, 25, showed signs of slurred speech and some dizziness as his blood pressure shot up late Tuesday night and this morning.

Review/Music; Serkin's Particular 'Goldberg' Variations
"Long have I been away from you" are the playful words to an 18th-century popular tune Bach quotes near the end of the "Goldberg" Variations.
It is as if the tune's unsung lyrics were referring to the theme itself, about to return after a long sojourn through canons, gigues, fugues, arias and dances: 30 of the most exquisite variations written for the keyboard.
The explanation for the absence of the theme is in the words to another melody Bach quotes in the final variation: "Cabbage and turnips have put me to flight."
One problem with Peter Serkin's survey of this remarkable set of pieces at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night was that Bach's playful allusion to mishaps of digestion after eating cabbage -- his coded suggestion that the theme was pushed into a fantastical flight of variation by something earthy and physical -- was completely overlooked.
Mr.
Serkin didn't care much at all about the physical world of movement and dance, the prismatic energy in the hand-crossing patter of the score, the body that listens to or creates this music.
There was something precious and detached about the performance.

Fields Set for 6 Races At Belmont's Jamboree
More than 50 of the best race horses from England, Ireland, France, Canada and the United States were entered yesterday in this Saturday's great Belmont Park jamboree, six stakes races worth $2.4 million in prize money plus star billing for the Breeders' Cup three weeks later.
The fields are mostly small but select, and the early favorites are all leading candidates for championships.
They are Devil His Due at 2-1 in the $850,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup, the 2-year-old Dehere at 2-5 in the $500,000 Champagne Stakes, the undefeated Strategic Maneuver at 4-5 in the $250,000 Frizette for 2-year-old fillies, Lure at 3-5 in the $200,000 Kelso on the turf and Turnback the Alarm at 2-1 in the $250,000 Beldame for fillies and mares.

The deal occurred on Monday in the Stratified Flight A Pairs at the conclusion of the regional championships in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y., and helped Paul and Joan Dziekanski of Manhattan, as North and South, to win the title by a large margin.
Using a four-card major style, they climbed to six hearts.


Review/Music; Extremism in the Defense of Rock, From Iggy Pop
Rock often enough feeds on extremity, and few people have cultivated the image of a nihilistic binger as thoroughly as Iggy Pop, the now-middle-aged progenitor of just about every trend in alternative rock.
He and his band came through New York on Tuesday night, playing a sold-out show at the Academy; it was part bad-boyism, part hyperactivity and all wildness.
Rock loves voyeurism, and part of Iggy's appeal comes from the anticipation of his self-abuse.
In that respect, he didn't get too far: he sang a song or two with his pants around his ankles, but that was about it.
For the rest of the show, he wandered over his career, from early tunes he played with the Stooges, including "I Wanna Be Your Dog" to a handful of songs from his latest album, "American Caesar" (Virgin), nearly 25 years later.

Investigators Question Commerce Secretary
Investigators met on Monday with Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown to ask him questions about allegations by a Vietnamese businessman who said Mr.
Brown had been offered $700,000 to work toward removing the nation's trade embargo with Vietnam.
The meeting, involving an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a lawyer for the Justice Department, was reported by The Washington Post today and confirmed by a person involved in the case.
That person said the Justice Department was still weeks away from determining whether to seek charges against Mr.
Brown.


FIRST CHICAGO CORP. (N)
The First Chicago Corporation, parent company of the First National Bank of Chicago, said yesterday that gains on investments in other companies and growth in its credit card business produced a record profit of $284 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30.
Excluding an unusually large $117 million profit from venture capital investments, First Chicago earned $167 million, which was more than analysts had expected.
Most of the venture capital gain was from stock holdings in Nextel, a communications company.
The credit card business, in which the bank is one of the 10 largest in the country, grew rapidly, with fees totaling $186.7 million in the quarter, up 34.7 percent from last year.


A Princess Tightens Her High-Fashion Belt
Two hundred years ago on Oct. 16, Marie-Antoinette was guillotined in Paris.
Before and after that anniversary, another German-speaking princess with even more lavish tastes is likely to make $20 million selling off her family trinkets.
Sotheby's auction of "The Thurn und Taxis Princely Collection," as the seven-volume boxed catalogue is grandly titled, began today and will continue until Oct. 21.
Marie-Antoinette's death is being remembered in Paris by all manner of nostalgic events, among them a newly composed Requiem Mass and a play in which the audience gets to vote on her fate.
By and large, to the chagrin of the play's creators, they are choosing exile or death.


Henry H. Perlman, 97, Expert in Dermatology
Dr.
Henry H. Perlman, a pioneer in pediatric dermatology, died on Sunday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.
He was 97 and lived in Philadelphia, where he practiced medicine for more than 70 years.
Dr.
Perlman was honorary clinical professor in both pediatrics and dermatology at the Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
He wrote a textbook, "Pediatric Dermatology," published in 1960, which helped establish the field as a recognized subspecialty in medicine.


Japan Is Urged to Insure Foreigners' Trade Share
As a keystone of its new approach to trade with Japan, the United States will demand that foreign companies gain the same share of the market for various goods and services in Japan as in other industrial nations, an American trade official said today.
The official, who is here for talks aimed at reaching detailed agreements under a broad trade framework signed by the United States and Japan in July, spoke at a news briefing as the talks began in earnest today.
The negotiator said that if the United States and Japan could not agree on "objective criteria" to measure the opening of Japanese markets, as was called for in July, Washington would establish such indexes itself.

Bowe's Extra Weight Doesn't Worry Him
Riddick Bowe ballooned to more than 270 pounds as late as last month, but the heavyweight champion has recently been punishing sparring partners, breaking one's nose, knocking out another's teeth and sending a third packing.
Bowe said yesterday by telephone from Lake Tahoe, Nev., that he was down to 250 pounds, and may lose 15 more for his Nov. 6 title defense against Evander Holyfield in Las Vegas, Nev.


Lehman Bros. to Move 900 Back-Office Jobs to Jersey City
After months of speculation, Lehman Brothers Inc. has decided to move more than 900 back-office employees to Jersey City, to the same 42-floor tower to which Merrill Lynch moved 2,500 back-office jobs a year ago.
Richard S. Fuld Jr., Lehman Brothers' president, said the decision to move was the result of a six-month study of future space needs, and reaffirmed plans to keep 5,000 employees in New York, the bulk at company headquarters at 3 World Financial Center.


U.N. Says Bosnia Factions Block Winter Supplies
As Bosnia heads into the second winter of its civil war with more than half of its population dependent on food relief supplies, United Nations officials have accused the warring factions of deliberately frustrating efforts to help the most vulnerable groups survive the winter.
With nighttime temperatures in mountainous regions already below the freezing point, and the first snowfalls only weeks away, there are no stockpiles of food and winter shelter materials in United Nations warehouses.
Food deliveries to the areas of Bosnia hardest hit by the war continue to fall far below United Nations targets, dropping to as little as 20 percent of what officials consider minimal needs.


Clinton Offers Job Training For Trade Pact Casualties
The Clinton Administration proposed a $100 million program today to help retrain Americans who lose their jobs because of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But critics of the pact were unimpressed by the proposal.
The Administration, which has long insisted that few Americans would be put out of work by the trade agreement, put the plan forward as a way of blunting opposition by unions and some Congressional Democrats.

As Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc. officially announced their intent to merge, a significance well beyond the billions of dollars involved began to unfold.
The merger would create a company with the financial wherewithal and the management skills to cover American homes with a huge umbrella of entertainment and information, available at the flick of a wrist.

Cunningham Among Bessie Winners
Merce Cunningham, Beverly Blossom and the Five Lesbian Brothers were among the 26 winners of Bessies, more formally known as New York Dance and Performance Awards, which were awarded on Monday night in a private ceremony at the Dance Theater Workshop.
The awards, given to dancers, musicians, scenic and lighting designers, a photographer and a dance producer, are named after the dance educator Bessie Schonberg.
Since 1983, when the Bessies were established, the awards ceremony has been held in such theaters as the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Joyce and the Delacorte.
But at this year's 10th anniversary, there was no extra glitter.
The Dance Theater Workshop, sponsor of the awards, is a tiny space, which underlined what its director, David R. White, described as a "bare bones" celebration because of recessional cutbacks in financial support.

Despite Scandal, Politicians Still Want Wall St. Money
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo of New York is already feeling the pinch of the move on Wall Street to stop political contributions aimed at winning bond-selling business.
Invitations to be on the committee for his Victory 1994 dinner on Dec. 1 were being opened on Wall Street just as 11 major firms last week announced a moratorium on contributions.
"I guess I'll have to turn this down," said one top executive at a major firm.


Giuliani Accuses Dinkins Of Being a Weak Leader
Rudolph W. Giulinai made a blistering advertising attack on Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday, criticizing his record and accusing him of weak leadership that has caused the city to lose 350,000 jobs, allowed government scandals and public disorder to flourish and encouraged racial divisiveness.
Though Mr.
Giuliani has attacked the condition of the city on the stump and in commercials before, the two new commercials mark the first time he has taken on Mr.
Dinkins's record -- and what Mr.
Giuliani calls his lack of accountability -- in paid advertising with such blunt, confrontational language that clearly seeks to put Mr.
Dinkins on the defensive.


Richter Gets Benched; Rangers Get the Point
Mike Richter was flat on his back, the puck behind him in the net, and Mike Keenan was pacing behind the bench.
Everybody knew this would happen sometime.
Keenan has only so much patience with his goaltenders.
Last night, he ran out.
A mere 5 minutes and 39 seconds into the Rangers-Nordiques game at Madison Square Garden, Quebec was ahead by two goals and Richter was banished to the bench.
Richter's on-ice failures and his tendency to struggle when behind certainly played into the decision.
But this was also a message, to Richter and his teammates.

But the dominant performer, John C. Malone, the president and chief executive of Tele-Communications, the nation's largest operator of cable television systems, was center stage and controlling the plot.

3D JUROR AT ISSUE IN BEATING TRIAL
Legal combat over the composition of the jury continued today in the trial of two black men accused of beating a white truck driver during last year's riot, with a defense lawyer asking for the removal of a third juror during deliberations.
The lawyer, Edi M. O. Faal, asked the court to remove a white woman who he said appeared to be biased in favor of the prosecution.
Judge John G. Ouderkirk of Superior Court, who has removed two other jurors in the past two days, asked for a response from the prosecutors and said he would rule on the motion on Thursday.


Hans W. Heinsheimer Dies at 93; Top Publisher of Classical Music
Hans W. Heinsheimer, one of the most influential classical-music publishers of the 20th century, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 93.
Although Mr.
Heinsheimer's name lacked the recognition factor of his famous clients, he instigated, participated in or at least was present at many significant events in contemporary music.
In his work as publisher and promoter, he served as midwife and artistic broker for such composers as Bartok, Stravinsky, Barber, Copland, Kodaly, Antheil, Bernstein, Berg, Janacek and Krenek.


Anti-abortion campaign raises questions of proper role of TV.
AN expensive anti-abortion campaign, which has sparked debate over advertisements advocating points of view on controversial issues, has begun running on New York area television stations.
When WCBS, Channel 2 in New York, owned by CBS Inc., and WWOR, Channel 9 in Secaucus, N.J., started running the commercials last week, it marked the first time they had appeared on local broadcast stations in a major market.
Abortion rights organizations said they were outraged and would seek time from the stations to express their opposing opinions.

The event was a reception given by the National Association of Women Judges and the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass.
The judges' organization has donated its archives of manuscripts and letters, including material from the two justices, to the library.

In Heart of Gun Country, Utah Is Changing Its Mind
Like starting to drive or date, owning a gun has long been a rite of passage for teen-agers in Utah, a state where many schools once closed during deer hunting season to accommodate the sport.
But a recent wave of violence has horrified residents of this famously prim-and-proper city, where street gangs were unknown only a decade ago, and prompted what was traditionally scorned as downright unpatriotic: gun control.

Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America climbed 8.7 percent in early October, compared with lackluster sales for the period a year earlier.

CHRONICLE
JOSEPH BAUM has long been a prominent figure on the New York restaurant scene: he is the creator of establishments, past and present, like Windows on the World, Aurora, La Fonda del Sol, the Four Seasons and the restored Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center.
But there are those who remember him in a different kind of kitchen, the one on the U.S.S.
Lindsey, a minelayer that was blown apart in a kamikaze attack southwest of Okinawa on April 12, 1945.
Mr.
Baum, then 22, was the supply officer on the vessel.
On Tuesday, he gave a dinner for 31 of the 100 or so surviving crew members and their wives and children in the Radio City Suite of the Rainbow complex.
It was the culmination of the group's reunion, which began on Saturday.


Hynes Urges Reno To Bring Charges On Crown Heights
The Brooklyn District Attorney has argued to the United States Attorney General, Janet Reno, that she has ample authority to prosecute a black teen-ager for civil rights violations in the slaying of a Hasidic Jew during the 1991 Crown Heights racial violence.
In a brief submitted last month but made public yesterday, the District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, cited various Federal civil rights statutes that he held could be used to bring charges against the teen-ager, Lemrick Nelson Jr., 18.
Mr.
Hynes's office prosecuted Mr.
Nelson unsuccessfully on state murder and manslaughter charges in the death of Yankel Rosenbaum.

The opinion of Mrs.

U.S. MOVE ANGERS DIPLOMATS IN HAITI
One day after the abrupt withdrawal of a ship carrying 218 American and Canadian soldiers, some Western diplomats here expressed outrage that the United States had seemingly capitulated in the face of opposition by the Haitian military to a international settlement of this country's crisis.
Western diplomats who have been involved with negotiations here said that the sudden withdrawal of the American transport ship, the Harlan County, had not only delivered a serious blow to their efforts, but had also potentially exposed hundreds of foreigners in the country to a wave of xenophobic violence by heavily armed Haitians opposed to the return of the exiled President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

Pop and Jazz in Review
Huggy Bear and the Frumpies  ABC No Rio 156 Rivington Street Lower East Side
Punk rock may turn out to be as durable as the blues.
The music that marked rock's adolescent temper tantrum in the 1970's has become the idiom for disaffected youths, who accept nothing from their elders except punk rock's shouted vocals, clattering drums and choked power chords.
The music's discordant noise and defiant amateurism keep it on the fringes of pop, to be rediscovered and renewed by wave after wave of marginalized fans and musicians.


At the Wire, U.A.W. Balks On Ford Pact
Two hours before they were to formally sign a three-year contract negotiated last month with the Ford Motor Company, top officials of the United Automobile Workers union notified Ford that they were unhappy with the company's view of one provision and would not sign.
Ford officials said they were caught off guard Tuesday night by the union's objection, which deals with a section giving workers a four-day weekend around Independence Day.
Ford and the union had scheduled a signing ceremony at 10 A.M. today, which they called off at 8 A.M.
No new date for signing the agreement was scheduled.
No Longer Settled
It was a highly unusual, perhaps unprecedented, move by the U.A.W., since the Ford agreement had already been ratified by the union's members at the No. 2 auto maker by a 2-to-1 margin, and the union had publicly treated it as a done deal.
Furthermore, the U.A.W. is now locked in negotiations with the General Motors Corporation.


Reviews/Dance; Song in Easy Concert With Choreography
Concert Royal, a musical group directed by James Richman, and the New York Baroque Dance Company, directed by Catherine Turocy, have often collaborated to revive Baroque spectacles.
They did so again on Saturday night at Gould Hall in "An Evening of Opera-Ballet," a charming tribute to a French Baroque theatrical form that blended singing with dancing.
The first piece was for dancers alone.
"La Danse et Ses Plaisirs," a new suite choreographed by Ms.

ROMANIA GRANTED FULL TRADE STATUS
The House of Representatives has given its seal of approval to Romania by voting to restore normal trade relations.
With Senate approval assured, the unanimous vote on Tuesday permits the United States to resume normal trade with Romania for the first time since 1988, when the former Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, scuttled a trade deal because of his objections to American demands that Romania improve its behavior on human rights.

The stock of Texas Instruments Inc. has dropped precipitously since Sept. 27, when it closed at $80.75, reflecting analysts' views that semiconductor growth may be slowing.

Yesterday, its shares fell more than 6 percent.


Greenspan and Panel Clash Over Fed's Status
The Federal Reserve came under fierce attack at a Congressional hearing today, as House members called it undemocratic, unaccountable and an exclusive club made up mostly of white males.
But Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, stoutly rejected numerous proposals that would give elected officials more power in choosing Federal Reserve policy makers, saying such steps would be a "major mistake" that could fuel inflation and hurt the economy.

Going After the Boors at the F.B.I.
After an F.B.I. agent, Suzane Doucette, complained about sexual harassment on the job, her co-workers started addressing her as "P.M.S. girl." Even though she had received cash awards from the agency and a military award for her counterintelligence work, she was turned down for the F.B.I.'s career development program, with the admonition to improve her relations with her male colleagues.
Then came further retaliation.
The agency placed her on administrative leave without pay after she testified about her case before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.
On Tuesday she tried to turn in her badge at F.B.I. headquarters but the agency refused to accept it.

Rabin Says Sales to China Didn't Break U.S. Law
Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzak Rabin, acknowledged on a state visit today that his country had sold arms to Beijing, but he disputed a United States intelligence estimate of the size of the sales and insisted that they do not violate any restrictions on transferring American weapons technology.
At a news conference, Mr.
Rabin responded to a United States Central Intelligence Agency report in Washington suggesting that over the last decade, Israel had sold several billion dollars worth of arms and military technology to China.

First Interstate Ascends As a Banking Phoenix
In the summer of 1990, Edward M. Carson, the newly appointed chairman of the First Interstate Bancorporation, promised angry shareholders that he would cut the bank's bad loans to 1 percent of assets by the end of 1993, from a level of 5 percent.
Recession interceded, real estate values here collapsed, and the only other major bank based in Los Angeles, the Security Pacific Corporation, was virtually destroyed.
But Mr.
Carson will deliver on his pledge: When First Interstate announces its earnings on Oct. 18, problem loans are expected to be below 1 percent, three months ahead of schedule.

The precise number of Somalis killed remains uncertain, but the American military and international relief agencies do not dispute the assertion by supporters of Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, the Somali faction leader, that there were at least 300.

Where Hispanic Voters Sided With Dinkins, Now Defection
With its tree-shaded streets lined with tidy brick and stucco homes, parts of Soundview look downright suburban, and for many of its residents it is.
This corner of the southeast Bronx was the working-class promised land -- a house, garage and yard -- a hard-earned reward for sweating it out at work and toughing it out in the tenements of the South Bronx or Spanish Harlem.
Now, as residents prepare to vote for mayor, they grumble that the out-of-the way feeling that attracted them to the neighborhood in the first place may be its curse as New York City officials show little interest in their concerns, which range from uneven sidewalks and overgrown trees to the recent incursion of drugs and crime.
All they have to do, they say, is glance at the street through barred windows and fenced-in porches and wonder if the phrase "quality of life" will ever be more than a campaign catch phrase.


Scientologists Granted Tax Exemption by the U.S.
The Government said today that it had agreed to grant a tax exemption to the Church of Scientology and more than 150 of its related corporations, ending one of the longest-running tax disputes in American history.
"This puts an end to what has been an historic war," said Marty Rathbun, president of a Scientology organization that received a tax exemption.
"It's like the Palestinians and the Israelis shaking hands."

Exerstrider Products of Madison, Wis., also makes walking poles.
Both products are designed to add an upper-body workout to walking.


A MERGER OF GIANTS: The Cost of Advice; At $35 Million, the Bankers And Lawyers Seem Cheap
At $33 billion, give or take a billion or two, the Bell Atlantic Corporation's purchase of Tele-Communications Inc. stacks up as the biggest takeover in corporate history, rivaled only by the $30.6 billion that Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Company shelled out for RJR Nabisco four years ago.
But compared with the RJR deal and other multibillion-dollar combinations, including the current battle between Viacom and QVC for the right to buy Paramount Communications, Wall Street's bill for services in the Bell Atlantic transaction looks like a pretty small piece of change.

For New Jersey Dog, 1,000 Days on Death Row; Is Taro Vicious? Who Cares? By Now, Most of the State's Judicial System
The numbers just keep growing bigger in the saga of a death-row dog that has spent more than 1,000 days at the Bergen County Jail, running up at least $100,000 in legal costs and upkeep charges.
It's time to say enough, says the sponsor of the New Jersey "vicious dog" law, which has doomed Lonnie and Sandy Lehrer's pet Akita, Taro.
The dog stands accused of injuring the lower lip of the couple's 10-year-old niece, Brie Halfond -- just how she was injured is disputed -- at the Lehrer's home during a family gathering on Dec. 25, 1990.

Gymnastics Site Flip-Flopped
The gymnastics competition of the 1996 Olympic Games will probably be moved to an arena with 13,000 fewer seats to accommodate television, Atlanta Olympic officials said today.
William Payne, president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, said gymnastics will most likely be moved from the Georgia Dome to the Omni coliseum.
The 71,500-seat Georgia Dome is to be divided in half with one side used for basketball.
The gymnastics competition has been scheduled for the other half.
Each side of the building has 30,000 seats.


Dolphins Sign Hodson
The Miami Dolphins signed the former New England Patriot TOMMY HODSON as a backup quarterback yesterday and placed DAN MARINO on injured reserve, making him ineligible for the rest of the season.
Marino, who ruptured his right Achilles' tendon in Cleveland Sunday, indicated Tuesday there was a slim hope he could return for the Super Bowl if the Dolphins made it that far.
But going on injured reserve makes him ineligible for both the regular season and post-season.


A MERGER OF GIANTS: The Vision; A Phone-Cable Vehicle for the Data Superhighway
The Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc. announced the biggest media merger in history yesterday, a deal offering perhaps the clearest evidence yet that American industry is serious about building the vaunted "information superhighway" of the future.
In announcing the $33 billion deal, the cable industry entrepreneur John C. Malone held out the vision of a single powerful box on top of each home television set that would combine the diverse streams of information that now flow separately into the home: telephone calls, television shows, video rentals, newspapers and even books.


Beth Israel Buys a Chain of Doctors' Offices
Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan has purchased a chain employing 41 doctors in Westchester County with a base of 150,000 patients in an effort to compete in the changing market for health care.
The agreement, announced today, is one of the new relationships that hospitals, doctors and insurers are creating as they try to drive down medical costs and prepare for a more competitive future.
The arrangement is unusual because it formally links a major city hospital with a large group of physicians in the suburbs.

Over the years, after an Yves Saint Laurent fashion show, word would go out and soon women of the world would be appearing in pants suits or looking like Russian peasants.
This time, his message is more diffuse.
"Be happy," the designer said after his show on Wednesday.
"Be happy with your clothes."
Cheerful cotton dresses in dense tropical flower prints helped carry out his thought.
Navy knit separates striped in white could have enlivened any summer resort.
And of course there were all kinds of jackets and trousers.
A navy satin jacket short enough to show a sliver of skin at the midriff and bright blue wide trousers made one of his prettiest suits.


Fund Group Agrees to Pay Restitution
The First Investors Corporation, a mutual fund company known for high-pressure sales tactics, yesterday settled litigation stemming from its aggressive sales of two junk bond funds in the 1980's.
It agreed to pay an additional $7.5 million into restitution funds for customers, bringing the total amount it will pay to $33.4 million.
The settlement also bars four top executives of the firm from working as supervisors in its sales operation.
The firm's chairman, Glenn O. Head, was barred for three months; its president, David D. Grayson, for six months, and Howard Froman and Alvin Blumenthal, who direct part of the firm's sales force, for nine months each.


Review/Film Festival; Chillingly Clear Recall Of the Unspeakable
Although "Birthplace," Pavel Lozinski's documentary about an American Jew's return to his native village in Poland, unfolds in a quiet, unremarkable manner, this film is shocking simply on the basis of what is being said.
Henry Greenberg has gone back to inquire about the fates of his father and brother, and a surprising number of elderly villagers remember exactly what happened to them.
The villagers' attitudes are astonishingly unchanged and unguarded, as if the forces behind the Holocaust remained preserved in amber.
"You know, we were Poles and they were Jews, but I didn't mind going to their shop," says one of the town's atypically open-minded citizens.

Untangling a Complex Deal
John C. Malone, never known for easy-to-understand deals, has started his most complex yet: selling his company, Tele-Communications Inc., to Bell Atlantic Corporation for $3.9 billion.
Analysts are having trouble figuring it out.
Big investors are unclear on details.
Even the principals are having trouble keeping it all straight.
Part of the problem is that there are so many moving pieces, given the number of companies peripherally involved in the deal, the different classes of stock, regulatory questions surrounding how much of Tele-Communications that Bell Atlantic will be allowed to swallow, and side deals like the fight between QVC Network Inc. and Viacom Inc. over Paramount Communications Inc.

But the Council gave the Haitian military until Monday to reverse the campaign of violence they have unleashed in the capital, Port-au-Prince.
The violence forced the United States on Tuesday to pull back a troop ship carrying American and Canadian military advisers to Haiti for a United Nations peacekeeping force.

Ginsburg at Fore in Court's Give-and-Take
The Supreme Court wrestled with two of the term's most important discrimination cases today, and for many minutes during the two intense hours of argument it was Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's courtroom.
The newest Justice, who spent the first part of her legal career fighting and helping to define sex discrimination, brought some of an advocate's passion to the day's arguments.
In Plain English
One case asks the Court to decide what constitutes sexual harassment on the job.
The question in the other case is whether the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which strengthened the basic Federal law against employment discrimination, should be applied retroactively to lawsuits that were pending when it took effect.

'Jack's Lad's' Leave Irish In a Precarious Position
Jack Charlton, the coach of the Republic of Ireland's national soccer team, is probably the best-loved Englishman ever to work in this robustly un-English country.
In seven years, what the headlines call "Jack's Magic" has turned "Jack's Lads" into a major soccer power.
But the lads, all of whom play for British club teams, didn't have it today, and 33,000 of the fans in "Jack's Army," trudged home in despair after Spain thrashed Ireland, 3-1.
The victory enhanced Spain's chances of qualifying for the World Cup in the United States next year.
Ireland will still qualify if it defeats Northern Ireland Nov. 17 in Belfast.


Whitman Goes on Attack, Accusing Florio on Funds
After a bruising week on defense, Christine Todd Whitman's gubernatorial campaign went on the attack today, charging Gov.
Jim Florio with violating state election laws by spending money designated for the general election before the primary was held in June.
Speaking at a news conference at the State House, the Whitman campaign lawyer, Peter Verniero, contended that the Florio campaign spent or transferred $225,000 in general-election funds between April 9 and the June 8 primary.
Ed Rollins, the campaign manager for Mrs.
Whitman, said the suspected violation was significant because it allowed Mr.
Florio to get a headstart on campaigning for the governor's race.

A picture caption on Sept. 13, about a visit to the Young Israel synagogue of Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, by the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, after the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, misstated the affiliation of the protester being restrained, and characterized the behavior of the congregation incorrectly.
In a letter dated Sept. 13, the congregation's rabbi pointed out that the protester was a member of a militant Jewish group, Kahane Chai, and that no member of the congregation took part in the disruption.

Senator Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, addressed about 200 people, speaking on Somalia and other issues.
Five minutes into his speech, a group called the Lesbian Offenders started singing the Pledge of Allegiance and then yelled obscenities.

Reviews/Dance; Different Mood for 'Rite'
Martha Graham's version of Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," which was a savage tiger of a dance at its premiere in 1984, is looking a bit like a sassy kitten in its current production by the Martha Graham Dance Company.
Although some of the work's ferocity has diminished, this "Rite" still permits dancers to offer distinctive interpretations of its leading roles, the Chosen One and the Shaman, as Christine Dakin and Peter London demonstrated on Tuesday night at City Center.
Ms.
Dakin, always a strong dramatic presence, has been in fine form this season.
As a woman who must be sacrificed to the gods, she looked horrified, rather than religiously honored, to be appointed the Chosen One, and her quick runs appeared to symbolize her futile efforts to escape her doom.
Death was inevitable, yet before she became a totally helpless victim, she faced the work's other characters defiantly.

Bell Atlantic's chairman, Raymond W. Smith, and Tele-Communications' president, John C. Malone, confirmed a complex stock swap in which the telephone company would acquire as much as regulators would allow of Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, and the Liberty Media Corporation, a cable programming company.
It would pay an estimated $34 a share for all of the assets, though Tele-Communications shareholders with enhanced voting rights -- including Mr.
Malone -- would get a 10 percent premium for their stakes.


2-Inch Crack Cited in Plane That Lost an Engine

Damage to the plane was put at $12 million.

A Lifetime of Folk Art, Going . . . Going . . .
BURTON AND HELAINE FENDELMAN are about to do a startling thing.
That's on top of the startling things they've been doing for the last 28 years.
During all those years, the couple -- referred to by some dealers in the antiques trade as "the Fendelpersons" -- have been amassing a collection of 19th-century American folk art that most museums would envy.
For nearly three decades -- the length of time their lives have been personally, professionally and philosophically enmeshed -- they carted and bartered, bought and sold and were obsessed with American folk art, back when just-plain-folk could still afford it.


A MERGER OF GIANTS: The Top Executives; A Corporate Man and a Cable King
They come from opposite directions.
John C. Malone -- called the King of Cable by his allies, a ruthless monopolist by his foes -- built the nation's largest cable television empire from scratch with daring and debt.
Raymond W. Smith plodded along the traditional corporate route to the helm of an even larger company, whose main business was and still is providing 18 million dull dial tones for local telephone customers.
But Mr.
Malone, the chief executive of Tele-Communications Inc., and Raymond W. Smith, his counterpart at Bell Atlantic, are brothers.
For if Mr.
Malone has as much financial and technical knowledge as anyone in the cable industry, Mr.
Smith has as much vision as anyone in the local telephone industry.

Scouting Report From Ryan: Brister Little Threat to Giants
Buddy Ryan may be having his own problems in Houston, where the Oilers (1-4) are about to be run out of town.
He may be on the verge of losing his job as defensive coordinator.
But he still found time to talk about the Eagles, Giants, and the National Football Conference East, a division his defense dominated for so many years when he was the Philadelphia head coach.
Ryan hasn't changed.
He's still the brash talker, the man who isn't afraid to speak his mind and as a result anger the target of his words.
You can be sure Eagles quarterback Bubby Brister won't like what Ryan said about him when asked if he thought Philadelphia could beat the Giants on Sunday -- and anyone else -- with Brister.
With Randall Cunningham out with a broken leg, Brister is now the man for the Eagles.


Books of The Times; Deceptions of Sex and Politics in 1930's Europe
While England Sleeps  By David Leavitt 304 pages. Viking. $22.
The year is 1936 at the start of the main action in David Leavitt's resonant new novel, "While England Sleeps," whose title comes from George Orwell's reference in "Homage to Catalonia" to "the deep, deep sleep of England" during Hitler's rise and the Spanish Civil War, and which leans heavily on, without acknowledging, Stephen Spender's 1948 autobiography, "World Within World."


Progress on the Waterfront
New York City's Planning Department gave itself an intimidating assignment when it developed a zoning plan for the waterfront.
With few exceptions, the city's 578 miles of shoreline have either been neglected to the point of deterioration or overdeveloped in ways that wall off the waterfront.
The trick was to improve the shoreline and the public's access to it without discouraging sensible development.
The new zoning changes, passed recently with some wise modifications by the City Council's Land Use Committee, contain unanswered questions and details that need ironing out.
But the proposal is a significant improvement over any policy the city has followed before.
The full Council need have no hesitation in approving the plan when it comes up for a vote later this month.


Greene Gives Braves His New Look
Tommy Greene, who was nervous and terrible and not around for long in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series, outdid Greg Maddux tonight to give his belligerent brethren with the bats all the room and comfort they required to take apart the Braves in Game 6 and earn a trip to the World Series.
Greene's effort was not impeccable.
He walked people, stayed away entirely from Fred McGriff, gave up a handful of hits, hard and long and otherwise.
But there were enough moments of moxie and punchouts of consequence for Greene to both win and be proud.
The line at the end read: 7 innings, 5 hits, 3 runs, 5 walks, 5 strikeouts.
It had a W next to it, too.

Woody Allen Asks Connecticut to Discipline Prosecutor
Woody Allen asked yesterday for disciplinary action against a Connecticut prosecutor who had said there was "probable cause" to believe that Mr.
Allen molested his 7-year-old daughter, but then did not file charges.

One complaint was lodged with the statewide bar counsel, who has the power to disbar lawyers.
The other grievance went to the State Criminal Justice Commission, which appoints state's attorneys and can discipline or dismiss them.

Clinton and Aristide Move To Affirm Policy on Haiti
A day after an American troopship was forced to retreat in the face of a small mob on a Port-au-Prince dock, the Clinton Administration and the exiled Haitian President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, sought to demonstrate the United States commitment to the return of democratic rule in the Caribbean country.
"Our commitment to this process is unshakable," William Swing, the recently appointed Ambassador to Haiti, said today, referring to the negotiated settlement between Father Aristide and Haiti's military rulers that was supposed to lead to the Roman Catholic priest's restoration as President on Oct. 31.
Countering the Images
Mr.
Swing made his comments as he presented his credentials to Father Aristide at the Haitian Embassy in Washington.
Advisers to Father Aristide invited the United States Information Service to record the event in hopes it would be broadcast to Haiti, where it might counter images of gun-toting police auxiliaries cheering on Tuesday as the American troopship retreated over the horizon.


Yeltsin, in Tokyo Limelight, Avoids Islands Dispute
President Boris N. Yeltsin ended a long-postponed trip to Japan today basking in his treatment by the Japanese as a democratic leader in full control of Russia, but neatly sidestepping any promises to return disputed territory to Japan.
At a news conference, he declared that after decades of suspicion, Japan and Russia had begun to "bring our two peoples closer together psychologically." But he quickly veered from diplomatic niceties to a defense of his actions last week in Moscow, telling critics in Japan that he was forced to act against his political adversaries "to avoid losing again millions of human lives in Russia, as was the case during the totalitarian regime."

'Berlin' 'Designing a Capital for the 21st Century'
Goethe House  1014 Fifth Avenue (at 82d Street)  Through Oct. 23
This show of urban design proposals by New York architects for a new Government center in Berlin is a case study in displaced energy.
Ostensibly, the 12 firms represented here have set their sights on the reunified German city.
But what the show really records is the frustrated desire of these young architects to grapple with the urbanism of their own hometown.
The Berlin wall has fallen, but an invisible barrier appears to separate New York's aspiring architects from those who actually plan and build their city.
When will these divided sectors be reunited?

Mr.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; The selling of Discover magazine hasn't been an exact science, but Disney will try a new approach.
WELL, O.K., it's not splitting the atom, curing baldness or delivering an edible tomato to a supermarket.
But the Walt Disney Company hopes to achieve a feat that has eluded publishers as prestigious as Time Inc. and as schlocky as Family Media Inc.: making the science magazine Discover a consistently successful title.
In Disney's first trade campaign since it bought Discover two years ago, the monthly will be celebrated as having found the formula for "the art of science." A series of three print advertisements, which begin appearing Monday, declare that Discover "appeals to the general interest reader of the 90's" and is therefore "truly at home in the home."

At Red Sea Resort, a Push to End Old Hatred
For those who see symbolic importance in matters like physical settings, the choice of this Red Sea resort for crucial negotiations that got under way this week between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization could be both hopeful and worrisome.

Market Place; Insurers flock to Bermuda, and insurance investors follow.
THE hottest place in the insurance business these days appears to be Bermuda, where private and corporate investors are pouring billions of dollars into new and expanding offshore insurance companies.
The new companies are rushing in to fill two yawning gaps in the world market: liability insurance and reinsurance -- the insurance that is bought by the insurers themselves -- to cover disasters like Hurricane Andrew last year.
Bermuda's reinsurance business has grown this year, in part because the role of London reinsurers, including Lloyd's of London, has diminished.

Giuliani on the Attack
Striving to put Mayor David N. Dinkins back on the defensive, Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun broadcasting two new 30-second television commercials and two similar radio ads, harshly attacking the Mayor's record in office and a range of personal or professional lapses dating back two decades.
This is one of them.
ON THE SCREEN: The ad opens with big words on screen "Maybe we should have known better," next to a tiny picture of Mr.
Giuliani noting that his campaign paid for it.
Followed by pictures of a Comptroller's report, and a quotation from it: "...serious internal control weaknesses over revenue..." Then newspaper headlines, title noting that Mr.
Dinkins failed to file tax returns from 1969 through 1972, footage of Korean boycott, Crown Heights, asbestos sign on a dumpster, and titles that repeat much of the narration.
It ends with a picture of Mr.
Dinkins's tenure from 1975 to 1985.
He failed to file income tax returns and pay all taxes due from 1969 through 1972, but he later paid the taxes with penalities and there was no prosecution.
As one of the Giuliani radio ads notes, the lapse prevented Mr.
Dinkins from becoming the city's first black deputy Mayor in 1973.
The school asbestos problem long predated the Mayor's tenure in office, and economists say the city government cannot be held accountable for all the jobs lost in a severe regional recession.
Moreover, Mr.
Dinkins has acknowledged fault in several of the cases cited, particularly with respect to Crown Heights.
SCORECARD: This tough ad attacks Mr.
Dinkins for a range of old and new lapses, throwing in everything but the kitchen sink.
It is Mr.
Giuliani's attempt to counteract the Dinkins ads that have sought to rehash old aspects of his record of service to Republican administrations and link them to his current policy views.
Similarly, this ad attempts to paint Mr.
Dinkins's entire career as an endless skein of mediocrity and bumbling -- typified by his failure to pay income taxes.
The "You think you'd get away with it?" line is an indirect echo of a charge the Giuliani camp sometimes makes more overtly: that if Mr.
Dinkins were white, he would never have been forgiven such a lapse.
That is a way of saying whites need not feel guilty for voting against him now, having given him a break four years ago.
By citing the most notable crises of the Dinkins administration, the ad may ring uncomfortably true.
But its rapid-fire mix of images and charges, and its final sneering tone of blaming the electorate may also put voters off.&lt;?

Review/Art; Sampling of Treasures From 18th-Century Korea
Of the three major East Asian cultures -- China, Korea and Japan -- Korea is the one least familiar to the West, and the one most obscured by the vicissitudes of power politics.
Positioned between two historically aggressive neighbors, Korea partook of the full radiance of Chinese art and helped transmit its influence to Japan.
But Korea was also savagely invaded by both countries, with the result that its own artistic traditions were, at crucial periods, all but obliterated.
"Korean Arts of the 18th Century: Splendor and Simplicity" at the Asia Society -- the centerpiece of the society's yearlong Festival of Korea celebrations -- sets out to restore an integral picture of those traditions.
It does so not only by looking beyond the Korean porcelains that are museum staples to painting, sculpture, calligraphy and furniture, but also by concentrating on a single era: a century when China was at peace, Japan had retired into an isolationist shell, and Korea was left in relative peace to establish an identity of its own.

"Somebody please explain to me how I get into a situation where my ex-husband is finding me dates!" Lee cries exasperatedly at one point.
Indeed, it would have been nice if the screenplay had explained that, since the dating gimmick becomes all too central to the plot.
"Mr. Wonderful" is well cast and convincingly played, but its actors are hamstrung by the cute excesses of the story.
Gus is supposedly eager to marry off Lee so that he can stop paying alimony and sink his money into an abandoned bowling alley he plans to refurbish, with the help of four equally handy friends.
Even viewers who buy that idea will have a hard time understanding why Gus and Lee, who supposedly hate each other, can spend so much time conspiring over Lee's social life.
Lee has been seeing her English professor (William Hurt) and Gus has an adoring girlfriend, a nurse named Rita (Mary-Louise Parker).
So in theory these ex-spouses are otherwise engaged.

New Photography 9
Museum of Modern Art  11 West 53d Street  Manhattan  Through Jan. 4
This year's installment in the Museum of Modern Art's continuing series of showcase exhibitions of new photographs is a varied but drab affair.
Beat Struli, a young Swiss photographer, is represented by oversized black-and-white prints of street scenes in New York City, taken with a telephoto lens.
The pictures suggest surveillance photographs, but lack distinctive subjects and are reduced to patterns of overlapping posters, signposts, bus shelters and the like.

Why Does Israel Arm China?
Israel is expanding its cooperation with China on military technology, according to the Central Intelligence Agency.
That's the latest sign of Israeli willingness to engage in dubious arms deals.
In this case, Israel is supplying China with advanced technology that the U.S. and other Western powers won't supply.
In the past, compelling security needs drove an isolated Israel to forge alliances of convenience with outcasts like South Africa and Iran, sometimes with U.S. connivance.
But why would Israel engage in such risky trade now -- especially with a country that has armed Israel's sworn enemies like Iran?
Washington, Israel's protector, should demand a good answer before supplying its ally with more advanced military technology.


Ferruzzi Rescue Plan Is Rejected by Banks
In a blow to efforts to rescue Italy's Ferruzzi group, the nation's second-largest private enterprise, foreign creditor banks tonight rejected a complex rescue plan worked out by Italian banks to prevent the company from going under.
The rejection, announced after meetings in Milan, was not only a blow to the $17 billion rescue plan, but appeared to be a rebuke of Mediobanca, the Government-controlled Italian bank that was the chief architect of the Ferruzzi rescue package.
The collapse may also have far-reaching consequences for the outcome of a debate here about the future shape of Italy's economy.

Go closer to inspect the inscription, and you find it's not one of those gooey celebrity testimonials ("Loved the food!"), but the autograph of the photographer, Annie Leibovitz.
In another restaurant this would be an ironic twist.
But the people who run Lora don't seem to know that they have done something funny, that they have made a comment about all those restaurants plastered with portraits of the rich and famous.
There is not much humor here, which is probably why this rather wonderful restaurant has not become more popular.

U.S. Presses for New Haitian Plan In Effort to Restore Ousted Leader
Jolted by the assassination of Haiti's Justice Minister, Administration officials scrambled today to develop plans to salvage the stalemated effort to return to power the exiled President, the Rev.

Even before the killing in Haiti, the Administration was considering tighter sanctions against Haiti by the United Nations, freezing Haitian assets in the United States and perhaps sending American ships to enforce the cutoff of oil and arms, the officials said.

Acknowledging that its plan to overhaul the health care system will be more expensive than anticipated, the Clinton Administration has lowered its estimate of how much the plan would cut the budget deficit.

District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan said payoffs, which dated to 1983, were made by contractors to get work rules relaxed on scores of projects, including the Federal Office Building under construction in lower Manhattan.
They also involved recent renovations at the Plaza Hotel, the Ritz Carlton New York Hotel, the Midtown North Precinct police station house, the Jewish Museum, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the Veterans Affairs hospital in the Bronx.

Now Free of Rice, Sherrard Blossoms
When Giants receiver Mike Sherrard was in San Francisco, he was in the difficult position of, oh, playing behind maybe the best receiver of all time in Jerry Rice.
That can be one of the greatest learning experiences ever, but it can also be suffocating.
Because he is such a competitor, Rice wants the ball all the time, every play.
He wants to do it all.
There were rumors that Sherrard and Rice didn't get along.
Last season with the 49ers Sherrard played in all 16 games and started in eight for the injured John Taylor.
As the rumors go, Rice thought Sherrard was getting too many catches (he finished the season with 38 for 607 yards).

Reviews/Film; Cut to: A Screenwriter, Very Harried. Present Day.
"Inside Monkey Zetterland," a dark comedy set in contemporary Los Angeles, strains so hard to be hip, zany and offbeat that you can almost feel the movie gasping for breath.
Written by Steven Antin, who also plays the title character, and directed by Jefery Levy, the movie offers a view of Los Angeles that echoes Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" in its grimness, although the tone of Mr.
Antin's movie is more farcically cheeky than grandly pessimistic.
The movie flaunts a number of audacious cinematic tricks.
In one early scene the camera faces a blank wall while overlapping arguments by off-screen characters converge.
In other scenes, the halting dialogue sounds as though it were improvised on the spot.
The soundtrack keeps shifting between excerpts from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, played straight, and the same music heard on a calliope.

Mr.
Papandreou, who won back the job as Prime Minister as a result of the Socialist victory in last weekend's elections, has further fueled controversy by announcing he planned to stop major privatizations and to renationalize the public transportation system, and to overturn a property settlement that had been reached between the previous Government and ex-King Constantine, the deposed Greek monarch who now lives in London.
Chooses His Son
But the biggest controversy, drawing quick criticism from pro-Socialist newspapers as well as the opposition press, was over a list of appointments in which Dimitra Liani-Papandreou, the Prime Minister's 37-year-old wife, was named as director of Mr.
Papandreou's private political office.

Making Art of Madness
On Nov. 15, 1934, Virginia Woolf began her rewrite of a novel eventually titled "The Years." "Lord! Lord!" she noted in her diary, "10 pages a day for 90 days: three months. . . . now, damnably disagreeable, as I see it will be -- compacting the vast mass -- I am using my faculties again. &amp; all the flies and fleas are forgotten."
Seven years later the flies and fleas and larger plagues drove Woolf, who had fought mental illness throughout her life, to suicide.
An increasing number of psychiatrists, neurologists and geneticists, says an article in this week's Science Times, believe there's a link between the genius and madness of artists such as her.
Maybe so.
But as anyone who's ever read Woolf's letters and diaries can attest, it's the link between imagination and self-discipline that got her a place in literature's pantheon.
Her mind may have had a grasshopper's fleetness, but her industry was the ant's.

The study -- a survey of 1,400 students in 15 high schools selected as a representative sample of the city's 290,000 students in 160 high schools -- was conducted in June 1992 by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the city Health Department and a school system that has reeled with shootings, knifings and a rising epidemic of violence in recent years.

This summer, in the trial of Randy Weaver, the racial separatist charged with conspiracy and murder in the death of a Federal marshal at Mr.
Weaver's remote Idaho cabin, Mr.
Spence pulled out all the stops.
To ridicule a Government ballistics expert who did not know the height of Mr.
Weaver's 14-year-old son, fatally shot in the back by a Federal marksman during the siege that sprang from the marshal's death, Mr.
Spence measured one of his own lawyers, made a pen mark on the associate's neck and joked about entering him as evidence.

An 'Honor' for Jordan
Just when you thought that MICHAEL JORDAN had won it all, here comes Dr.

P.C. Gender?
To the Editor:
For reasons that escape me, it has become politically correct to apply the word "gender" to the male-female dichotomy that in a simpler time was always referred to as "sex." The proposed standard medical claim form you recently reproduced asks for the patient's "gender," and "Gay Parents: Living in Fear" (editorial, Oct. 4) mentions "same-gender partners." For the sake of consistency, shouldn't we refer to "genderal orientation" and to "heterogenderals" and "homogenderals"?

Breaking Down an Arms Buildup
Having earned billions of dollars building weapons for the military, many contractors think they have found a new growth area -- dismantling and recycling the weapons they were paid to make.

Hoped-for Scandal Fails to Materialize at Hearing
The advance word on a Republican-sponsored hearing today into bonds issued by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority was that it would produce an "October surprise" against Gov.
Jim Florio.
Instead, it produced one of the oddest bits of political theater of the campaign season.
The star witness -- the former chairman of the Sports and Exposition Authority, Peter L. Levine -- complained at length about "outside interference" with his agency and repeatedly referred to "wrongs" done, but he never named names or said what they did.


Backing Clinton, Senate Rejects Bid to Speed Somalia Pullout
The Senate early this morning rejected efforts to accelerate the withdrawal of American troops from Somalia faster than President Clinton's timetable, but only after an impassioned debate during which Republicans and Democrats offered harsh critiques of the Administration's policy.
For five hours, one Senator after another rehashed the bitter lessons of Vietnam and Lebanon, suggesting the White House needed a dramatic reminder lest it fall into old traps.
Several Senators launched into rhetorical checklists of the mistakes they said the Administration has made in allowing the United Nations to put American forces in harm's way.
They accused the White House of drifting from one soundbite to another while 29 American soldiers died and 170 were wounded.


Antiques Fair Comes of Age
THE International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show is no longer the new kid on the block.
Now in its fifth year, the seven-day event, which opens today at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, is firmly entrenched in the international collectors' circuit.
Falling somewhere between the over-the-top Biennale Internationale des Antiquaires in Paris and the terribly stuffy Grosvenor House Antiques Fair in London, it's the most impressive art and antiques show that New York City gets to see, both in the quality of its contents and the originality of their presentation.
This fair is also the only New York event that collects works as diverse and rare as a suite of 19th-century Russian furniture, a group of Syrian alabaster sculptures dating from the fourth to the third centuries B.C., a Canaletto scene of Venice that once belonged to King Ludwig I of Bavaria and a 19th-century cross of garnet and diamonds.
Prices are generally high.
While small objects like a nice pair of earrings or a botanical drawing can be had for several thousand dollars, many of the big-ticket items, whether furniture or artifacts, cost up to $1 million.
Even if buying isn't on your agenda, it's a stimulating place to train the eye.

Court Upholds Payment for Life-Sustaining Care for Woman in Right-to-Die Dispute
In a major right-to-die case, New York's top court ruled today that a Long Island man must pay a nursing home for its life-sustaining care of his comatose wife even though he had asked that she be allowed to die.
The unanimous ruling by the Court of Appeals underscored the strictness of New York's laws and legal precedents on the rights of patients and their relatives to terminate life.
And it gave new impetus to calls for the Legislature to expand the rights of family members to make medical decisions for incapacitated relatives.


Whitman on Florio: Accusations of Corruption
Candidate: Christine Todd Whitman Producer: The Murphey Pintak Gautier Agency.
Washington Text: (Voiceover) Whitman and Florio.
Compare.
Christie Whitman wants to cut state spending.
Jim Florio increased spending by three billion dollars.
Christie Whitman wants to create new jobs with tax cuts.
Jim Florio raised taxes billions and he won't rule out raising taxes again.
Whitman will clean up state Government.
Florio's administration is under two grand jury investigations.
Jim Florio.
Rising unemployment, corruption, high taxes.
We can't afford more.
Christie Whitman.
A change for the better.
Visual: Still photos of Mrs.
Whitman and Mr.
Florio appear side by side -- predictably she is smiling engagingly while he is frosty -- while graphics echo the truncated words of the narrator.
Her image disappears when the specter of corruption is mentioned, replaced at the Governor's side by stacks of money and news headlines reading "State Jobless Rate Reaches 7.7 % For Second Rise in a Row" and "Lax Ethical Standards." Analysis: What's new here is the odor of corruption.
In earlier television spots, Mrs.
Whitman tried to saddle Mr.
Florio with all the bad effects of a prolonged recession while contrasting the $2.8 billion tax increases he pushed through the Legislature in 1980 with her campaign promise to cut taxes by $1.4 billion. (Mrs. Whitman herself refuses to sign a no-new-taxes pledge.) While mention of the two grand juries is fair game, equating them with proof of corruption is not, and Mrs.
Whitman's pledge "to clean up state Government" not only lacks specifics but means little without evidence that it is dirty.
A state grand jury is looking into allegations that $1.5 million in excess state school aid was sent to the Democratic-controlled town of Lyndhurst , which GOP partisans have painted as a political payoff ordered by the Governor's office.
Meanwhile, a Federal grand jury has been examining the old practice, unique to neither party, of directing profitable state bond business to Wall Street fat cats who make hefty campaign contributions to the party in power.
The fly in Mr.
Florio's ointment here is that Joseph C. Salema Jr., his chief of staff and political satrap, was a partner in a bond consulting firm that profited handsomely from state decisions.
Mr.
Salema resigned last May to spare the Governor further embarrassment, but so far Federal investigators have not indicated that any laws were broken.
Some Democrats question whether Mrs.
Whitman, whose husband is a wealthy Wall Street broker and whose late father was a Republican power broker and fund-raiser, is all that shocked by back-room deals between Trenton and captains of finance.

Diagnosing Realities of Health Care Reform; Parity for Mental Care
To the Editor:
Health reform measures unveiled by the Clinton Administration offer real hope for better medical care for people with mental and emotional illnesses, but they will have to wait until the year 2001 for comprehensive coverage to become available.
We applaud the Administration's bold movement toward coverage of mental illnesses on a par with physical illnesses, but questions remain why this parity cannot be achieved today.

Review/Music; Complex Delving Into Myth
A visitor to the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron -- the site, according to the Bible, where Abraham, Sarah and the Patriarchs are buried -- never actually sees a cave.
It is covered with layers of construction: a wall erected by Herod, the remnants of a Byzantine church, a 12th-century mosque.
Inside that mosque both Jews and Moslems now come to worship, with an Israeli army presence preventing conflict.
No one knows what lies underneath the mosque's floor.
In "The Cave," a work of opera, theater and video that received its American premiere at the Next Wave Festival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night, Steve Reich and Beryl Korot are preoccupied with the cultural counterparts of such layers of accumulation and appropriation.
The work received its first performance last spring in Vienna and was commissioned by seven organizations (including the academy).
It is divided into three acts.
Each deals with a different group of people -- Israeli Jews, Palestinian Muslims and Americans -- reacting to the same questions: Who for you is Abraham?
Who for you is Sarah?
Hagar?
Ishmael?
Isaac?
The cave Abraham purchased as a burial site for Sarah is a recurrent image.


Mayor's Race Shows Soaring Atlanta Is Not Above Urban Ills
With its boom-town image, long history of powerhouse mayors and giddy anticipation of being the host of the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta should be one place where urban politics has the potential to rise above the nation's urban ills.
But instead of grand visions of renewal, three politicians are waging a campaign centering on issues of crime, corruption and government efficiency.
The race underscores the pervasiveness of the nation's urban ills and the gap between the troubled real-world Atlanta and the glittering international pageant it will put on in 1996.


Review/Film; Finding a Little Sentiment In a Macho Mayhem Setting
"Judgment Night," a tight, energetic sleeper in the action-adventure genre, manages to pack a few anti-machismo sentiments into an otherwise brawny tale.
The story concerns four suburban buddies who take a wrong turn en route to a boxing match and wind up lost in Chicago's inner city.
As such, it sounds like a fairly standard occasion for mean-spirited mayhem.
But the film manages to avoid excessive gore, lurid violence and the potentially racist aspects of its story.
Indeed, it even includes a moment when one hero hugs his brother and says: "Hey John, everybody gets scared, whether they admit it or not.  I'm scared too." Emilio Estevez, in the role of this sensitive guy, strikes another blow for gentleness by actually stating that he would like to survive the evening's death race and get home to see his wife and baby.
Thoughts like that are generally anathema in a manhunt story.

Critic's Notebook; Ellington: Beyond Category
HE was "something of an African Stravinsky" to a Dallas News critic.
A trumpeter said he was "the epitome of elegance" to the fashion-conscious musicians of Washington, "strolling up to the corner attired in a shimmy back herringbone suit." One Los Angeles reporter compared his hotel suite, crammed with sheet music, pencil stubs, cigarette butts, a piano and a record player, to a wartime factory.
"The Duke works like a longshoreman loading tanks for the Red Army," he wrote, but the Duke also greeted him in a silk dressing gown and gave the interview while breakfasting on peaches and pears.
Orson Welles put it very simply: Ellington, he said, was the only genius he'd ever met other than himself.
The highest praise Duke Ellington bestowed on people or music he loved (not least his own) was the phrase "beyond category." The handsome exhibition devoted to his life and music opening tomorrow at the Museum of the City of New York is titled just that.


House Rejects Democratic Leaders' Plan to Extend Jobless Benefits
In an embarrassing defeat for the Democratic leadership, the House of Representatives today rejected a plan to extend emergency benefits for workers who had been unemployed more than six months and had exhausted their state benefits.
Congressional budget rules require that the $1 billion cost of extending the benefits be offset by spending cuts or tax increases, but Democrats were deeply divided over where to come up with the money.

The judge in the trial of two men accused of beating a truck driver during last year's riots refused today to remove a juror who her colleagues said ran down a hotel hallway screaming, "I can't take it any more!"
At the same time, the judge released transcripts of a closed hearing in which the jury forewoman described a another juror -- whom the judge did remove on Monday -- as "incapable of understanding what she reads, what is read to her, what is discussed and what is decided upon one way or the other."

Art in Review
Leland Bell
Salander-O'Reilly Galleries  20 East 79th Street  Manhattan  Through Oct. 30
Like Jean Helion and Balthus, Leland Bell, who died two years ago at 69, was determined to meld the advances of modern abstraction with the grand tradition of figure painting that stretches back to the Renaissance.
He never quite succeeded: his art remains limited by a self-consciousness that verges on the academic, and a dry, unanimating touch.
Yet the complexity of his ambition and the gusto with which he embraced his many inspirations and goals can be fascinating to watch, and never more so than in this exhibition of 13 big paintings from the last 16 years of his life.


U.S. Warns North Koreans of U.N. Action on Nuclear Inspections
The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency have warned North Korea that they will seek action by the United Nations Security Council unless Pyongyang admits inspectors to its nuclear sites within two weeks, according to officials in several countries.
For months the Clinton Administration has been trying to keep the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons out of the Security Council, in hopes that its direct talks with Pyongyang -- the first since the Korean War -- would derail its effort to build a nuclear bomb.
But officials from South Korea and Japan, who have also been involved, now characterize the talks as an empty exercise that has allowed North Korea to buy time.
Equipment Not Serviced
Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, which conducts the inspections, said that North Korea had repeatedly prevented inspectors from servicing equipment monitoring key nuclear sites.
The equipment is expected to run out of film and batteries in November.

Was there a subtle but stubborn defect that had once more undermined Atlanta's quest for a world championship?
Would Bobby Cox, who has been nearly crippled by bad knees, be back as manager?

U.S. Study Says Job Retraining Is Not Effective
An internal Labor Department report says the Government job training program for workers hurt by foreign trade is largely ineffective and used primarily as an income crutch for the unemployed.
The $200 million program, one of the biggest and most generous for unemployed Americans, was enacted 19 years ago in an effort to help laid-off manufacturing workers who could show that imports cost them their jobs.
They were to be retrained in computer operation, nursing, accounting and trades like welding and air conditioning repair.

CBS Is Getting Out Just as It Gets It Right
Tomorrow night starts the last of CBS's four World Series, the end of a stormy relationship between the network and baseball and between the network and tube-watchers.
For most of the first three years, CBS was viewed as an interloper on NBC's sacred turf, because itabandoned the Game of the Week and because of its inferior productions.
Remember 1991's post-season Dance of the 1,000 Replays?
Worst of all for CBS was sustaining losses that equaled about half the $1.06 billion it (over)paid for the rights to major league baseball.


Review/Film; TV's Favorite Hicks Come Home to Hollywood
Consider it a sign of the times that when "The Beverly Hillbillies" first appeared on television, the show was excoriated for lowering the level of popular taste.
Now "The Beverly Hillbillies" has been lovingly expanded into a full-length movie, and it is by no means the dopiest thing on the big screen.
The director, Penelope Spheeris, doing her best to turn the cheerful no-brainer into an art form, has moved effortlessly from the purple haze of "Wayne's World" to the pink stucco mansion that becomes home to Hollywood's favorite hicks.
In this setting, the film enshrines every last staple of the television series and also adds some modern references, like a distinct hint that the Clampetts of Arkansas are related to the Clintons.

Magic Show in Israel
MAGIC JOHNSON earned one of his biggest assists yet while on an exhibition tour of Israel: He united bitter political rivals.
A game last night between Johnson's team and five legislators from Israel's Knesset (parliament) sold out Jerusalem's newest and biggest basketball arena with proceeds going to AIDS research in Israel.
It also ended after only one quarter because of the crush of photographers with Johnson's team leading, 18-6.
"Magic let us off easy," AVI YEHEZKEEL, a legislator for the ruling Labor party, said after the game.
"Let him last a week in the Knesset," said conservative Tzomet party legislator GONEN SEGEV.
The Israeli team was made up of legislators bitterly opposed on the issue of the Sept. 13 Israel-P.L.O. agreement.
Said Johnson: "I'm just happy to . . . come here and play basketball. If I'm a peace person, O.K., cool, I'll be one."

Meeting Gay Bias Face to Face in Class; Teen-Agers Get Direct Answers
The human visual aid for teaching teen-agers here about homosexuality is Suzanne Westenhoefer.
"I'm here to show you gay people are not going to kill you or harm you," Ms.
Westenhoefer said recently in introducing herself to a class of juniors at Pascack Hills High School here.
The two dozen students greeted her with a few nervous twitters.


Five Are Arrested In a Kidnapping
Five kidnappers were arrested yesterday after their attempt to collect $150,000 from the family of a victim went awry, the police said.
Two victims were freed, unhurt.
The two victims, Jose Marizan, 34, and Luis Felipe Rodriguez, 19, were kidnapped on Wednesday around 4:30 P.M. on Northern Boulevard in Queens, Sgt.
Tina Mohrmann, a police spokeswoman, said.


Antagonists Abroad at Play in Qatar
It was lunchtime at the Gulf Sheraton Hotel today.
Up on the seventh floor, the Japanese and South Korean soccer teams were eating in different rooms, enjoying the familiar tastes of food prepared by their own chefs.
Downstairs, in a small banquet hall just off the lobby, the Saudi Arabians were dining underneath the benevolent gaze of their King Fahd, whose portrait had been hung on the wall last week.


TV Weekend; 'Against the Grain': Football and Family Values
In some respects, the new NBC series "Against the Grain" does have the courage of its title.
It's not just another half-hour sitcom running on wisecracks.
It's an hourlong drama admirably aiming, according to one executive producer, Bruce Sallan, to present "real-life problems and family issues." Another executive producer happens to be Lee Rich.
He produced "The Waltons," which gives you a giant clue as to the kind of family warmth "Against the Grain" would like to generate.
It isn't all that easy these days.
The setting is a small Texas town that is just nuts about football.
Ed Clemons (John Terry), the best quarterback in county history, seeks and wins, at least for one season, the job of coach of Sumpter High's football team.
Ed is not your average jock.
After spending two months in a hospital because of an accident, he has returned to his wife, Maggie (Donna Bullock), and their children, the standard three, with consciousness-raising in full throttle.
"I love you, Son," he tells Joe Willie (Ben Affleck), his eldest, "and don't you wait 16 years to say that to your son." As Ed spells it out even further, "I've had a lot of time to think about what's important and what's not."

Dealing With Somalia: Vagueness as a Virtue
A week after President Clinton announced plans to be out of Somalia in six months, the Administration's new approach is clear: from now on it will act less like a sheriff come to clean up Mogadishu and more like a clan leader, engaging in the sort of murky politics and gray compromises it believes are necessary to stabilize the country.
Officials say this new approach of playing the game by the local rules has one simple goal: to prod the Somali factions with various sticks and carrots into a minimum level of political reconciliation that will allow the United States to withdraw without seeing an immediate collapse into chaos.


Corrections
A picture caption on Monday about an after-school program in Upper Saddle River, N.J., that is fighting to stay open misstated the species of the snake with which a group of boys were playing.
It was a ball python.


Challenging Giuliani, Dinkins Spells Out His Politics of Race
Standing beside Hillary Rodham Clinton two weeks after her husband suggested that some New Yorkers were reluctant to back him because of his race, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday appealed to voters "to support me not because of the color of my skin but because of the content of my heart." He accused Rudolph W. Giuliani of using the issue destructively.
In some of the most candid public remarks he has ever made on the subject, Mr.
Dinkins told a noontime fund-raiser at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan: "Race should never be a subject of political debate. But race relations, if our city is to reign preeminent, must be spoken about -- without fear and without rancor.

WARNACO REFINANCES $500 MILLION IN DEBT
The Warnaco Group Inc., which manufactures lingerie, men's clothes and accessories under brand names like Warner's, Olga and Chaps by Ralph Lauren, said yesterday that it had refinanced $500 million in bank credit at a lower interest rate, which will save the company about $8 million a year, or an additional 40 cents a share.
The company has also reached an agreement with its banks, which include the Bank of Nova Scotia, Citicorp U.S.A., the GE Capital Corporation, Credit Suisse and the Union Bank of Switzerland, to lower the interest rate further as its credit rating improves.
Warnaco's shares rose $1.375, to $33.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Alternative Therapy
To the Editor:
Dr.
Usha Mukhtyar's interesting letter about homeopathic therapy for migraine headache (Oct. 2) errs in part: the National Institutes of Health and independent investigators, not the Food and Drug Administration, study the efficacy and safety of medications.
An N.I.H. division, well funded, now studies the efficacy and safety of alternative medical practices.
And nothing stops manufacturers of homeopathic medicine from applying to the F.D.A. for licensing.
Dr.
Mukhtyar can do the same for his homeopathic medication for migraine.

Leftist Leader Is Named Prime Minister of Poland
President Lech Walesa said today that Waldemar Pawlak, a 34-year-old leader of the rural wing of the former Communist Party, would be Poland's next Prime Minister, but at the same time expressed reservations about whether he could handle the job.
Mr.
Pawlak will head a left-wing coalition of two ex-Communist parties that emerged as the winners of a general election last month.
Mr.
Walesa said he would officially appoint Mr.
Pawlak, who served briefly as Prime Minister last year, as soon as the outgoing Government resigned, probably by the end of the week.


Yanks Hire 3 New Coaches While Dismissing 4 Others
The Yankees completed the juggling and reduction of their coaching staff yesterday, but did not specify job titles.
Willie Randolph, Billy Connors and Brian Butterfield were added, while four coaches -- including Frank Howard, the first-base coach -- were dismissed as the Yankees sliced their staff from seven to six.
Connors, one of Manager Buck Showalter's closest friends, was hired from the Chicago Cubs and will presumably become pitching coach for the second time with the Yankees.
Randolph, the former Yankee infielder who had been an assistant general manager the last three months, will return to the field and could be the third-base coach.
Butterfield, a coach with the Yankees' Class AA Albany-Colonie team in 1993 and another friend of Showalter's, was promoted to the majors and is most likely to coach at first base.


Anti-Smoking Ads For Massachusetts
Massachusetts introduced an anti-smoking campaign yesterday that will spend $14 million on messages aimed at a variety of audiences.
"It's time we made smoking history" serves as the theme for television, radio, print and outdoor ads created by Houston, Effler &amp; Partners of Boston.
One television commercial is narrated by a teen-age boy who asserts that "too many kids have gotten hooked by believing the lies of the tobacco companies," which he characterized as falsely portraying smoking as "attractive or cool."


Art in Review
'Jeremy Dickinson' 'Civic Pride Paintings'
Cohen Gallery  1018 Madison Avenue (at 77th Street)  Through Oct. 25
There's a tongue-in-cheek Conceptualism to the English artist Jeremy Dickinson's tiny paintings of the public buses of different British communities, seen here in his first solo show anywhere.
All of them are based on photographs taken by bus buffs, the late-20th-century cousins of train buffs and the urban equivalent of bird watchers, and together the images present a kind of species of vehicle.


A Blunder for Mr. Cortines
New York City's Schools Chancellor, Ramon Cortines, has reinstated 10 principals in Bronx School District 12 who were dismissed in June by his predecessor, Joseph Fernandez.
It's Mr.
Cortines's first blunder, and it's a doozy.
He says he wanted to refocus attention on education.
But to a district rife with mismanagement and allegations of corruption, he has sent a message that it can carry on business as usual.
He has undermined the new superintendent, diligent school staffs and parents who are struggling to clean house despite a local board that still resists reform.
And he has compromised the good work of Edward Stancik, the school system's special investigator, whose devastating report on the district spurred Mr.
Fernandez to act.

Kasparov Survives a Near-Fatal a Blunder
Gary Kasparov stumbled but did not go down for the count against Nigel Short in Game 17 of their world championship match yesterday in London.
The Russian blundered into a clever trap set by the Englishman, but pulled himself together and struggled into a draw.
The bottom line is that with 11 points now to Short's 6, Kasparov inched closer to the 12 1/2 needed to decide the match and collect $1.43 million of the $2.55 million purse.


Abroad at Home; Mean What You Say
The crisis in Haiti offers President Clinton a difficult challenge -- but also an opportunity to answer swelling doubts about his foreign policy leadership.
The doubts, to put it bluntly, go to whether his words carry any conviction.
Shilly-shallying has been a feature of Mr.
Clinton's Presidency.
Friends and allies have come to suspect that what he says, like a cut-rate air ticket, is good for that day only.

Jane Wilson
Fischbach Gallery  24 West 57th Street  Manhattan  Through Oct. 23
The landscapes in Jane Wilson's beautiful paintings are almost entirely composed of sky.
A small white nugget of a moon sails over the ocean in one; bruise-colored clouds scud across an autumn sky in another, and in a third, the summer sun pulsates with a blinding white-yellow light.
In each case, earth and sea are little more than thin strips of gestural brushwork at the canvas's lower edge.


Assailing Dinkins, Koch Backs Giuliani
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who has called Rudolph W. Giuliani "a dog" for his political and prosecutorial attacks on him and his administration, endorses his candidacy for Mayor in his column in The Daily News today.
Last night, Mr.
Giuliani won the endorsement of Robert F. Wagner Jr., a former Koch Deputy Mayor and president of the Board of Education and the third-generation scion of one of the state's most prominent Democratic political dynasties.


Glad and Sad At Show House
There's nothing like a designer show house to make you feel glad and sad all at once.
The done-up rooms are either eminently entertaining, in the "I adore that huge fringed chandelier and all those plaster heads" mind set, or frustrating, in the sense of "Why does it take two months to paint our bedroom when these walls have been done in Venetian palazzo fresco in two days?"
The 1993 French Designer Show House, which opened yesterday in Manhattan, offers just such an emotional excursion.
Twenty-eight designers, decorative painters and landscape artists have brightened up a late 1920's building that has vintage Spanish, Georgian, Gothic and medieval touches.

Johannesburg Journal; Circle the Wagons? Or Just Start a New Country?
In the years of racial division called apartheid, the Afrikaners became world masters at the invention of new and fantastic countries.
To rid South Africa of an inconvenient black majority, these white South Africans of Dutch ancestry created such "traditional" homelands as Bophuthatswana, QwaQwa, Ciskei and Lebowa, mostly destitute little dictatorships that neither their residents nor the world regard as real states.

Washington at Work; Chief and Agency Both at Crossroads As Bellamy Takes Peace Corps Helm
The Peace Corps, as Carol Bellamy, its new director, likes to point out, is an agency with "140,000 constituents and 140,000 plus 1 opinions" about how to run it.
The one thing that those 140,000 or so opinions (one for each former Peace Corps volunteer) seem to converge on these days is approval of who is running the agency.
For the first time since the era of Camelot and the cold war, a former Peace Corps volunteer is at the helm.


G.O.P. to Challenge Judicial Nominees Who Oppose Death Penalty
Senate Republicans have given notice that they will challenge any of President Clinton's judicial nominees they consider insufficiently committed to the death penalty.
The effort to impose a new kind of litmus test comes as the White House is preparing to fill dozens of vacancies in the Federal courts, hoping to counter 12 years of Republican rule in which hundreds of conservative lawyers were appointed to the bench.


Net Owners' Way Out Is Through the Door
Whatever the actual figure is, and it seems to be increasing as if it were the counting board on a Jerry Lewis telethon, the Nets' ownership believes that acceding to Derrick Coleman's contractual demand would be akin to committing financial suicide.
Ownership, on the other hand, at least understands that not extending Coleman's contract and eventually losing him to unrestricted free agency would likely create a chain reaction -- starting with Coach Chuck Daly's exit next spring -- that would reduce their franchise to the laughingstock it has been more often than not.

As the bus inched out of the school parking lot and passed under the scarlet-tinged canopy of oaks and maples that make this suburban village seem more pristine than bustling, Tierney discovered the reason behind the long faces.

Bell Atlantic Faces Regulatory Hoops
On the morning after the euphoric announcement of the biggest communications merger in history, analysts said that the harsh light of day would reveal the many wrinkles and creases in the Bell Atlantic Corporation's plan to acquire Tele-Communications Inc.
Because Bell Atlantic is one of the nation's biggest phone companies and Tele-Communications is the largest cable-television concern, there will be many regulatory hurdles to clear.
And some of the most important aspects of the deal, analysts said, such as Bell Atlantic's potential to become a long-distance carrier, had escaped public attention. 'Long, Long Time'
"It won't be a done deal for a long, long time because this is a regulatory nightmare," Todd A. Dagres, a communications analyst for the Yankee Group, a high-technology research firm in Boston, said yesterday.
"These two companies may not be able to offer services until well into 1995."

As such, yields will need to drop even lower to confirm that the rally at the long end of the bond market has resumed.

Peter Weir's "Fearless," adapted by Rafael Yglesias from his own novel, is a serious, confidently made film that's as singular and remote as Max Klein (Jeff Bridges), the successful San Francisco architect whose story it is.
En route to Houston on a commercial airliner, Max survives a horrendous crash without a scratch, though he is profoundly changed.
Moments before the plane hit the ground, while other passengers were screaming in panic, he experienced an epiphany.
"This is it," he told himself.
"This is the moment of your death, and I am not afraid." He later sees himself as liberated.
Having passed through death, he feels not immortal but forever freed from the fear of death.

Books of The Times; Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Short Form
Strange Pilgrims
Twelve Stories
By Gabriel Garcia Marquez
Translated by Edith Grossman. 188 pages. Alfred A. Knopf, $21.
There are moments in these 12 stories that are instantly, incontestably recognizable as the work of Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
In "Maria dos Prazeres," an aging prostitute picks out her own cemetery plot and teaches her little dog to cry at her grave.
In "I Sell My Dreams," a Colombian woman finds permanent employment as the interpreter of dreams for a wealthy family.
In "Light Is Like Water," an entire fourth-grade class drowns in an apartment flooded with light.


Review/Theater; A Singer's Life, From Protest to Pop
There is an oddly schizoid quality to "Fire in the Rain," the autobiographical show that Holly Near, the folk singer and tireless advocate for leftist causes, has brought to the Union Square Theater.
As she cheerfully relates her life story in songs, anecdotes and slides, one picture that emerges is of an aspiring pop singer and actress trying and failing to grasp the brass ring of show-business glory.
As a child growing up in the wilds of Northern California, Ms.
Near recalls, she used to sing along with the records of pop divas like Edith Piaf and Lena Horne.
Her parents rigged up a device that allowed her to fly like Peter Pan on Broadway in her own backyard.
Eventually she made it to Broadway as a cast member of "Hair." She even appeared in an episode of the television series "The Partridge Family."


Hiss Case 'Smoking Gun'?
he Alger Hiss case, born in the first years of the cold war, has outlived it and now occupies the lofty zone where history merges into myth.
Just last year, a Russian general, Dmitri A. Volkogonov, said he had examined a mountain of K.G.B. files and declared Mr.
Hiss innocent of spying charges first raised by his accuser, Whittaker Chambers, in 1948.
Under pressure from Sovietologists and experts on the Hiss case, the general then beat a hasty retreat, admitting he had consulted only selected archives and that key files had probably been destroyed during the Stalinist era.

Eager to move ahead on its proposed $9.6 billion merger with Paramount Communications, QVC Network Inc. is preparing to begin discussions with Paramount's advisers early next week, several executives close to the talks said yesterday.

Review/Art; A Grand Phantasmagoria From a Catalan Poet
WHEN Joan Miro first lived in Paris, a shy young man on the fringes of an incredibly vibrant cultural scene, he was so hungry that he hallucinated (or so he said years later).
Those hallucinations helped to fuel the fantastical and dreamlike paintings that secured his reputation.
Fast forward half a century, from the cliche of the starving artist to the cliche of the grand old man, the head of a virtual Miro industry, so famous that in 1981 The New York Times even saw fit to print an article headlined "Miro Recovering From Cold."

Cortines Is Assailed For Rehiring Of Principals
A day after he reinstated 10 principals stripped of their Bronx school posts because of accusations that their hiring was part of a corrupt process, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines endured a barrage of criticism from the Dinkins administration and others, who characterized his decision as a blunder that would have the effect of endorsing graft.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, two mayoral appointees to the Board of Education, school employees and parent leaders had reactions that ranged from mild censure to furious reproach.
Even Mr.
Cortines's supporters on the seven-member Board of Education grumbled that they had not been consulted, though they said they agreed with the Chancellor's arguments that the reinstatement would restore stability to one of the city's most troubled districts.

BMW Denies Rift With Mullen Agency
BMW of North America said a new print advertisement for its 325i convertible and R1100 RS Boxer motorcycle had been created by Burkhardt &amp; Christy in New York, its motorcycle agency, rather than by its automotive agency, Mullen Advertising of Wenham, Mass.
But Richard S. Brooks, a BMW spokesman in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., strongly disputed a report this week in The Delaney Report newsletter that Burkhardt had been named to develop advertising for BMW's line of convertibles.
Mr.
Brooks said the concept of combining motorcycle and convertible advertising predated Mullen's appointment as the automotive agency in February.
He denied that there was any friction or tension between BMW and Mullen, which has been reported in trade publications.

Bridge
A year of play in the Greater New York Bridge Association's Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Teams ended Wednesday night at the Beverly Club, 130 East 57th Street.
The winners of the final, by a convincing margin of 73 imps over a group led by Bill Rosenbaum of Manhattan, were Jeanne and Albert Rahmey, Simon Satanowsky, all of Brooklyn; Michael Prahin of New City, N.Y., and Alan Sontag and Win Allegaert, both of Manhattan.
There were many borderline slam deals, one of which is shown in the diagram.
The North-South pair for the Rosenbaum team reached six spades, which stands or falls on the trump distribution and was duly defeated.
Both six diamonds and six no-trump are substantially better contracts, and the latter was reached by Allegaert and Sontag with the North-South cards.
Allegaert presumably counted his heart jack and the club ten as assets in assessing his weak two-bid as a maximum, and was vindicated in the play.
His three-diamond rebid showed a useful honor in that suit, clearly the king, and encouraged his partner to try six no-trump.


Bizarre Crime, Shocking Sentence
It seems Gunter Parche has accomplished exactly what he set out to do.
In April Mr.
Parche, a 39-year-old unemployed machinist, sank a kitchen knife into the back of the tennis star Monica Seles as she sat between games during a match.
He later said he was obsessed with Steffi Graf and wanted to disable Ms.
Seles so that Ms.
Graf could regain her No. 1 ranking.
He has succeeded.
Now it seems he will suffer no consequences for his bizarre and violent intervention.
This week a judge in Hamburg, Germany, where the crime took place, gave Mr.
Parche a two-year prison sentence, then suspended it.

A No-Debate Mayoral Race?
New York City's mayoral election is 17 days away, and the candidates have yet to schedule a debate.
Sound familiar?
It is.
It was down to the wire four years ago too, when David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani debated the terms of the debate for weeks.
Ultimately, they held two televised debates -- on the last weekend of the campaign.
Then as now, the same disagreement separated them: who participates.
Mr.
Giuliani wants to debate the Mayor one on one, while Mr.
Dinkins wants George Marlin, of the Conservative and Right to Life parties, included.
Obviously Mr.
Giuliani doesn't want to lose even one vote to Mr.
Marlin, and Mr.
Dinkins hopes Mr.
Marlin will attract votes that would otherwise go to Mr.
Giuliani.

In announcing his judgment on the performance of 35 admirals and Marine generals -- all present at the convention -- Navy Secretary John H. Dalton described a failure of leadership.
Because of that, he said, he reserved the severest actions for the three naval officers most closely involved in planning and running the convention of Navy aviators in 1991 at a hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., during which scores of women were sexually assaulted.


MISSION IN SOMALIA: Secretary Besieged -- A special report; U.N. Chief Has to Direct Peace Efforts at U.S., Too
The world's No. 1 peacemaker is spending much of his time making peace with Washington.
It is a task that does not come easily to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
In a series of interviews over several months, the 71-year-old Egyptian lawyer-turned-diplomat has revealed himself as a man with no stomach for taking orders, no tolerance for fools, no patience for protocol, no reverence for tradition.

A Sudden Surge in Media Stocks
An aftershock of the mammoth Bell Atlantic-Tele-communications deal broke over the television networks yesterday, as the share prices of CBS Inc. and Capital Cities/ABC jumped nearly 5 percent to highs for the year.
Even before the plans for the merger were announced this week, the bidding and maneuvering for Paramount Communications Inc. by Viacom Inc. and QVC Network Inc. had unleashed a torrent of speculation that the media business was the best game in town.


U.S. Adviser Meets Haitian But Sees No Breakthrough
As American warships steamed toward Haiti to enforce an international embargo, President Clinton's special adviser met with with the Haitian Army commander and afterward expressed little hope of a breakthrough in the showdown with the country's military leadership.
In a brief news conference, Lawrence A. Pezzullo, the special Presidential adviser, who was accompanied by Gen.
John Sheehan of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provided no details of his conversation with the Haitian military leader, Gen.
Raoul Cedras, and declined to say whether he had obtained a new commitment for the general's retirement.
General Cedras had agreed to resign by today as part of the agreement negotiated last summer aimed at restoring democracy to Haiti.

Price Data Flat, Curbing Cost-of-Living Raises
Fifty million Americans who collect Social Security and other Federal benefits will get cost-of-living increases of only 2.6 percent for 1994, the Government announced today.
The increase, the second-smallest annual rise since the payments were automatically linked to inflation in 1975, was based on data released today showing that consumer price inflation had vanished in September.


Beliefs
When people talk about sin, they like to get explicit.
That explains why there was so much advance interest in Pope John Paul II's latest encyclical, "Veritatis Splendor" ("The Splendor of Truth"), and so much perplexity once it appeared.
Instead of the anticipated inventory of specific sins, the encyclical, which was released on Oct. 5, was a philosophical and theological treatise on the basic principles of the moral life and moral reasoning.
It discussed conscience, reason, freedom, the sources of morality, natural law and universal moral norms.

The Next Times Square; Lies, All Lies
After city and state officials and the architect Robert A. M. Stern unveiled new guidelines for redeveloping the area west of Times Square -- a pulsating, kaleidoscopic vision of "billboard parks," loudspeakers and oversized television screens -- the Op-Ed page asked interested parties, and others, to comment.
Here are their responses.
Ever since I've been old enough to understand English, I've been told that each war was the one to end all wars; that the last crackdown on the Mafia will finally put them out of business; that the capture of Noriega will put an end to the drug problem.
We were told that equal rights for women would translate into equal pay.
In whose lifetime were they talking about?
I'm sorry, but I don't respect all these other lies.
Why should I have respect for the story of the resurrection of Times Square?
I've seen more pictures, plans and diagrams depicting the "new Times Square" more times and for more years than I've been told about the return of the Messiah.
As an Orthodox Jew, I have to believe in the Messiah because I was taught in Hebrew school that if I doubt it I will die.
But I was never told that I will die if I don't believe in the rebirth of Times Square.
That's why I believe we will live to see the rebirth of Times Square after we live to see the Messiah.
P.S. A word of advice to the Messiah: Stay out of Times Square.

Bulgaria, Too, Rescued Jews From Hitler
To the Editor:
I have read with interest your coverage of the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Danish rescue of Jews from the Nazis during World War II.
A less known but more dramatic rescue took place in Bulgaria a few months before the Danish rescue.
Bulgaria was Nazi Germany's ally; its king, Boris III, was a personal friend of Hitler.
The Fascist party was in power and the country swarmed with German troops.
Nevertheless, when Adolf Eichmann's deputy, Theodor Dannecker, came to Bulgaria to deport the Jews, this small Balkan nation refused to let them go.
The young secretary of the Commissar for Jewish Questions, Liliana Panitza, discovered the secret agreement between her employer and the German envoy and hurried to inform Jewish and Bulgarian leaders of the forthcoming deportation.

To the Editor:
The perennial scandals of payoffs by plumbing contractors and bribes to inspectors and other employees of New York City's Department of Buildings for quicker approvals ("18 Inspectors Arrested on Bribe Charges," Oct. 1) demand a time-tested approach -- rooting out corruption by eliminating the cause.
The plan offered by the Dinkins administration in the form of two bills in the City Council would have a costly negative impact on building owners and the public.
The bills would transfer the functions of the Plumbing Division to a new, private, not-for-profit corporation headed by the same officials who have headed the agency for nearly four years.

Review/Pop; From Madonna, a New Palatability but Still Spicy
Madonna has stopped trying to top herself.
Yes, "The Girlie Show," her current touring spectacle, does include bumping and grinding, polymorphous caresses and couplings, crotch-grabbing, four-letter words, some Bible recitation and a bare-breasted female dancer.
But after the proudly uningratiating "Blond Ambition" tour in 1990, not to mention the "Sex" book last year, "The Girlie Show" tweaks fewer taboos.
Despite the naughty bits, most of the two-hour show is devoted to repositioning Madonna from trend-spotter to part-time nostalgia merchant, and from titillating novelty act to all-round entertainer.
With "Blond Ambition," she was pop's least flirtatious sex symbol; in "The Girlie Show," which started its three-night stand at Madison Square Garden on Thursday, she's likable again.
Like innumerable other entertainers, Madonna proselytizes for universal love.
She simply makes clear that her idea of love is carnal and pansexual as well as warmhearted.

The chairman of the State Power Authority, under fire for his use of a state airplane, poor management at two nuclear plants and his opposition to letting independent companies compete with the authority in supplying power, defended his record in a hearing yesterday.
In sometimes contradictory testimony, the chairman, Richard M. Flynn, said that it is unnecessary to regulate his agency as other utilities in the state are regulated; he argued that the marketplace does that job, because the Power Authority must provide electricity at competitive rates.
But he acknowledged, under questioning, that the authority has been using revenues from half-century-old hydroelectric plants to support an unsuccessful nuclear reactor.

Spending by Dinkins Campaign Tests Law on Public Financing
Under New York City's campaign finance law, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani are allowed to spend $8 million each on their campaigns for mayor, but they do not have to count against this limit the money they spend to keep their books in compliance with election laws.
That exception is now the center of a major fight between the two campaigns in the closing weeks of the mayoral race.
The outcome could either leave the Dinkins campaign short of money to spend in the final days or raise questions about the effectiveness of the five-year-old campaign finance law.


Giuliani Draws Criticsm From a Running Mate
Susan D. Alter, the Republican-Liberal candidate for Public Advocate, yesterday faulted her ticketmate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, for failing to take forceful enough positions on women's issues.
Ms.
Alter made the remark in her first debate with Mark Green in the general election campaign.
She said she would keep Mr.
Giuliani's "feet to the fire" on women's issues if they are both elected.
She said she had "not seen a strong platform" on women's rights from Mr.
Giuliani.

Steeplechase Has Cozy Field
Belmont Park's day of racing glamour -- billed as the Breeders' Cup Preview -- one race won't be a preview.
It will be a final.
It is the Breeders' Cup Steeplechase, and it is traditionally run on a different day at a different track from the seven other races in the Breeders' Cup series, which will run on Nov. 6 at Santa Anita.
Today's running has another distinction.
Nine horses are entered in the Steeplechase, but there is only betting to win.
No other betting will be taken.
The reason is that four of the horses are being run as an entry trained by Jonathan Sheppard, four as an entry trained by Janet Elliot and the ninth is running by himself.

MISSION IN SOMALIA: Secretary Besieged -- A special report; U.N. Chief Has to Direct Peace Efforts at U.S., Too
The world's No. 1 peacemaker is spending much of his time making peace with Washington.
It is a task that does not come easily to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
In a series of interviews over several months, the 71-year-old Egyptian lawyer-turned-diplomat has revealed himself as a man with no stomach for taking orders, no tolerance for fools, no patience for protocol, no reverence for tradition.


Tax and Medicaid Concerns
Taxes may be the most unsettled aspect of living benefits.
Although the proceeds of a life insurance policy are subject to estate taxes when the insured dies, beneficiaries pay no income tax on the money.
But what if payment precedes death?
Last December the Internal Revenue Service proposed that living benefits -- at least when paid by insurers -- be exempt from Federal income tax under certain conditions.
The proposal is not final, but many expect it to be adopted.


The Invisible Cost of Global Virtue
Among nations as with people, no good deed goes unpunished.
Consider Bulgaria, a former Communist country that has set high standards of decency in the Balkans.
Unlike its neighbors, Yugoslavia and Romania, Bulgaria has managed its transition to democracy and free markets without civil or ethnic strife, repudiating its brutal assimilation campaign in the mid-1980's to "Bulgarianize" ethnic Turks and other minorities.
Under the temperate leadership of President Zhelyu Zhelev, Bulgaria has strived to contain what he calls "the barbaric war" in Bosnia.
Sofia has avoided all involvement in hostilities; it fully supports United Nations sanctions against Serbia, which shares its longest land frontier.
It has recognized the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, renouncing the territorial claims that once helped trigger a bloody Balkan war.
Not least, Bulgaria supported peacekeeping in Cambodia by sending its own volunteers, 10 of whom were killed.


Koch Enjoys His Moment In Campaign
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch basked once again in the limelight of a mayoral race yesterday as political strategists scrambled to assess the effects of his reach across party lines to endorse Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal challenger to Mayor David N. Dinkins.
"Isn't it wonderful at 68 to still be relevant?" Mr.
Koch chuckled after his endorsement of Mr.
Giuliani in his Daily News column brought him a barrage of attention and phone calls.


Stocks Continue Climb; Dow Advances by 8.10
The stock market posted its third gain in a row yesterday, although some profit taking pulled prices down from their afternoon highs.

Youth Hit by Car in Harlem
An 8-year-old youth was struck by a hit-and-run driver in Harlem last night, and a motorist was captured after another driver cut him off two blocks away and a crowd held him until the police arrived, the police said.
The youth, who was not identified, was in serious but stable condition early this morning at Harlem Hospital Center, said Sgt.
John McCluskey, a police spokesman.
Paul Jacobs, 66, of 2190 Eighth Avenue, was charged with driving while intoxicated, assault and leaving the scene, Sergeant McCluskey said.
The youth was struck at 7:50 P.M. as he crossed 143d Street from the east to the west side.

ITT Cutting Headquarters Staff
The ITT Corporation said yesterday that it would reduce the staff at its world and division headquarters by about 25 percent, or about 1,100 people.
The decision was based on recommendations from McKinsey &amp; Company, the management consultant firm that ITT hired to help it trim costs and improve its return on equity.
In a memo to employees earlier this week, Rand V. Araskog, ITT chairman and chief executive, said the cuts -- through layoffs, attrition and retirements -- would save ITT about $147 million next year.


The Politics of Food
The old view of U.S. farm policy is that it strikes an unconscionable blow to the poor: It jacks up food prices so that Congress can funnel billions to a rich and well-organized constituency.
The new view of farm subsidies -- which follows from a series this week in The Times -- is that the old view was much too kind.
Dean Baquet and Diana Henriques expose the Department of Agriculture as the handmaiden of powerful agribusiness.
The department oversees programs to subsidize food exports.
Yet the subsidies haven't done much to increase exports; nor have they done much to help family farmers, the supposed beneficiaries when supporters in Congress argue for more ill-deserved support.

Alternative Medicine Needs Protection of Law; Local Side Effect
To the Editor:
The dietary supplement industry's campaign pressuring Congress to loosen Food and Drug Administration regulations should trouble us for the reasons you cite, and then some ("The Snake Oil Protection Act," editorial, Oct. 5).
If the Hatch-Richardson bill becomes law, one side effect would be the crippling of local law enforcement that protects the very sick, including people with AIDS.
In 1990 the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, responding to the growth in AIDS quackery, adopted the first-ever local regulation that requires documented scientific evidence when a product or treatment claims it can protect the immune system or somehow inhibit the onset of AIDS.

High Cost for Clinton on Somalia Vote
The Senate finally endorsed President Clinton's Somalia policy at 1:15 this morning, but it was a Pyrrhic victory for the Commander in Chief, with senators on both sides of the aisle throwing sharp oratorical spears at the President and his advisers.
Cranky after five hours of debate and chilled in the drafty chamber, the senators had lost patience with the Clinton Administration and even with one another.
Opponents of the President's policy said their colleagues would have the blood of American soldiers on their hands for dawdling over one withdrawal date or another.

An Unfettered Milken Has Lessons to Teach
Michael Milken is back from prison and forever barred from the Wall Street world of high-risk financing where he fell from reigning master to disgraced convict.
But the tattered mogul hardly seems east of Eden these days as he buoyantly teaches his weekly class of young M.B.A. candidates much, if not all, that he has learned.
"Can you suggest when you'd use the zero-coupon bond?" he asks, endlessly animated as he moves about the classroom of 57 students who seek to enter that chastened world now forbidden to him.
They sit raptly, knowing they are being taught by a man of fabulous wealth and considerable resiliency, a man who chuckles at academic business notions and stands as the epitome of real-world experience, 22 months of prison time for securities fraud included.
Worshipful Undergraduates
Across the corridor from his class here at the University of California at Los Angeles, an overflow crowd of worshipful undergraduates, a few commuting for the night from distant campuses, audit the master's lessons.
They watch the television screen as if it were a futuristic stock ticker.

Cuomo Accepts Mohawk Plan For a Casino
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo signed a compact yesterday to let the St.
Regis Mohawk Indians open New York State's second high-stakes gambling casino, a $10 million Las Vegas-style operation on a Canadian-border reservation where illegal gambling led to deadly clashes between factions of the tribe in 1990.
The Governor acted after Mohawk leaders agreed to stiff state regulations for running the casino and offered assurances that there would be no return to violence.
Three years ago tribe members opposed to illegal gambling blocked roads, attacked businesses and shut down the reservation for five weeks in clashes that escalated into gunfights and left two Mohawks dead.
A $6 Billion Bonanza
While some Mohawks still fear an invasion of disruptive neon-lighted businesses and criminal elements and argue that gambling undermines traditional tribal values, many others, citing a long history of poverty and official neglect, welcome a chance to get in on the $6 billion-a-year bonanza that gambling has brought to about 70 Indian tribes in 20 states under a 1988 Federal law.

The Times Square development team -- the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty -- are pleased that New York is moving forward in our joint endeavor to rescue the crossroads of the world.
We, the state and the city have agreed that the interim plan must be viewed as a forward-looking opportunity, leading to the final, shared goals of the project as originally conceived -- including the development of four office buildings.


HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL REPORT
Scouting the Top Teams  Following are the scouting reports for this weekend's top high school football games in the Public Schools Athletic League and Catholic High Schools Football League as well as for Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut, Westchester County and Rockland County.
The teams' records are in parentheses.
P.S.A.L.
Curtis (2-3) at Susan Wagner (1-4), Tomorrow Key Players: Unfortunately for Susan Wagner, Omar Darling (700 yards and 6 touchdowns) is a one-man team, averaging 22 carries a game instead of 15 rushes for the usual Wagner back.
"He's done a great job for us," said his coach, Al Paturzo.
"But because no one else is doing anything for us, it makes it difficult for him to run." Curtis Coach Fred Olivieri said that while his defensive unit, led by tackles Dewan Reeves and Martinique Matthews, would key on Darling, it also had to contend with Falcons passer Robert Morelli.
Wagner has excellent receivers in Jason Cintron, Eric Woodson and Jamal Beckum.

Alternative Medicine Needs Protection of Law
To the Editor:
Protect my snake oil!
"The 1993 Snake Oil Protection Act" (editorial, Oct. 5) does not take into account four crucial problems with the increased Food and Drug Administration regulation of supplements that the legislation sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Bill Richardson would prevent or curtail.
First, if the F.D.A. exercised its rights to control labeling and testing of supplements, it would drain the Federal budget with more testing, enforcement and litigation costs.
In this time of downsizing, our tax money is better spent protecting us from much more serious hazards.
The agency was created when alcohol was the main ingredient in many infant colic cures.
Its function is to protect us from dangerous food and drugs and to guarantee the effectiveness of prescribed medications.

Don't let the mountains of superlatives that have already been heaped on "The Piano" put you off: Jane Campion's 19th-century love story lives up to its advance notices.

"The Piano" is much like its remarkable heroine, Ada (Holly Hunter), a mute (but not deaf) young Scots widow who, with her 9-year-old daughter, travels to the New Zealand bush to marry a man she has never met.
Ada's husband-to-be calls her "stunted." The film looks deceptively small, but in character it's big and strong and complex.

Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., said it was optimistic that its 1993 results would be a record.
Arnold G. Langbo, the chairman and chief executive, said per-share earnings would grow in the low double digits "over the long term."

The Next Times Square; Let It Be Itself
After city and state officials and the architect Robert A. M. Stern unveiled new guidelines for redeveloping the area west of Times Square -- a pulsating, kaleidoscopic vision of "billboard parks," loudspeakers and oversized television screens -- the Op-Ed page asked interested parties, and others, to comment.
Here are their responses.
Broadway, the diagonal that makes a string of special places in the anonymous grid that is Manhattan.
An earlier memory: I'm 22, a grad student at Columbia.
One Saturday, a friend and I decide to structure the evening by walking from my apartment on 110th Street down Broadway to Times Square, stopping at a bar every tenth block (a decimal response, I suppose, to the urgent grid).
We make it all the way, if memory serves -- memory may not be serving too well -- and on the subway, returning in the early hours, I find myself looking over the shoulder of a woman who is composing, and printing out in pencil with delirious precision, a poem so desperate with loneliness that I am able to recite it for months afterwards.
I think of her as a character out of Joseph Mitchell or Meyer Berger, the two writers who formed my early sense of New York as an explorer's world of hidden oddballs.


The Next Times Square; No More Towers
After city and state officials and the architect Robert A. M. Stern unveiled new guidelines for redeveloping the area west of Times Square -- a pulsating, kaleidoscopic vision of "billboard parks," loudspeakers and oversized television screens -- the Op-Ed page asked interested parties, and others, to comment.
Here are their responses.
It's time to quit dawdling.
Over a decade ago, this project was sold to the public with three purposes: stimulate office development on the West Side, fix up the Times Square subway station and revive the once grand, now vacant theaters as the centerpiece of a new entertainment center in the heart of the city.
Today, the area is overbuilt with mostly empty office towers; the developers have been relieved of their obligation to pay for the subway renovation, and no plan has yet been advanced for the theaters.


Jockey Faked Record
EIBAR COA, the leading rider at Calder Race Course in Miami, was suspended for 60 days by track stewards yesterday amid charges he falsified documentation that permitted him to ride with a five-pound apprentice allowance.

He had told officials that he rode 11 winners in Venezuela, but when he was confronted with documentation showing he actually rode 59 winners there, "he admitted it right away," according Walter Blum, the state steward.

Here are their responses.
The new high-tech Times Square plan is fine as far as it goes, but a better plan would offer more diversity.
If a peddler on Broadway is selling fake cellular telephones, shouldn't others nearby be encouraged with tax abatements to offer, say, wind-up chattering teeth or those weird neon tubes?
And let's get more counterfeit luxury goods out there -- Eddie Bauer gun scopes, Baccarat martini glasses, Alain Mikli eyewear, Poul Jorgensen hand-tied trout flies.

But after the death of a man in Mount Vernon who was subdued with the spray, officials of the Justice Department said today that even before that incident they had been reviewing 13 cases in which people had died in arrests in which pepper spray was used.

Crossing the Threshold Of Separation Anxieties
MUCH of the time everyone in this city seems to be moving toward some higher stage of development.
Usually the process involves personal decisions, like taking courses, dieting, cutting hair or trying to live righteously.
Sometimes, though, thresholds are crossed against our will.
Consider what happened a few days ago at the Toddler Center at Barnard College, where 12 children, between 18 and 30 months old, arrived with their mothers just as they had twice a week for the previous month.
This time the mothers, following instructions of the preschool's staff, mentioned on the elevator that they would not be staying to play as before, that they would be leaving to buy cookies.

Stern unveiled new guidelines for redeveloping the area west of Times Square -- a pulsating, kaleidoscopic vision of "billboard parks," loudspeakers and oversized television screens -- the Op-Ed page asked interested parties, and others, to comment.
Here are their responses.
Broadway, the diagonal that makes a string of special places in the anonymous grid that is Manhattan.
An earlier memory: I'm 22, a grad student at Columbia.
One Saturday, a friend and I decide to structure the evening by walking from my apartment on 110th Street down Broadway to Times Square, stopping at a bar every tenth block (a decimal response, I suppose, to the urgent grid).
We make it all the way, if memory serves -- memory may not be serving too well -- and on the subway, returning in the early hours, I find myself looking over the shoulder of a woman who is composing, and printing out in pencil with delirious precision, a poem so desperate with loneliness that I am able to recite it for months afterwards.
I think of her as a character out of Joseph Mitchell or Meyer Berger, the two writers who formed my early sense of New York as an explorer's world of hidden oddballs.


A Trial in Canada Is Watched in U.S.
For months now, a seven-car police convoy has whipped through the placid streets of this modest city on its way to and from the courthouse.
As the police cars pull into the court's back entrance, sharpshooters and officers armed with submachine guns move into defensive positions while five men, chained together at wrist and ankle, are escorted into the courthouse.
Here in this southern Canadian city, just over the border from Buffalo, five prisoners described by prosecutors as Muslim militants are accused of plotting to bomb an Indian theater and a Hindu temple near Toronto.
No bombing took place and no explosives were found, but the plotting case has clearly hit a nerve in a nation that has long considered itself immune from terrorist attacks.


Rights Monitors Are Pulled Out of Haiti
They came to monitor violations of Haitians' rights, but like their military counterparts, human rights workers sent here by the United Nations and the Organization of American States have decided that the dangers are suddenly too great.
As their colleagues in the countryside were being recalled to the capital by the two organizations for evacuation, some of the civilian human rights monitors were busy shredding documents and erasing computer disks today to prevent reprisals against informants by the Haitian police.

U.S. Adviser Meets Haitian But Sees No Breakthrough
As American warships steamed toward Haiti to enforce an international embargo, President Clinton's special adviser met with with the Haitian Army commander and afterward expressed little hope of a breakthrough in the showdown with the country's military leadership.
In a brief news conference, Lawrence A. Pezzullo, the special Presidential adviser, who was accompanied by Gen.
John Sheehan of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provided no details of his conversation with the Haitian military leader, Gen.
Raoul Cedras, and declined to say whether he had obtained a new commitment for the general's retirement.
General Cedras had agreed to resign by today as part of the agreement negotiated last summer aimed at restoring democracy to Haiti.


U.N. Quandary in Somalia: How Not to Start Fighting
The sudden shift from a state of near-war to one of uncertain peace has presented United States and United Nations commanders with a quandary: how to re-establish a military presence here without provoking a return to fighting.
After four months in which most United Nations forces in southern Mogadishu retreated behind compound walls, the commanders say more active patrols are essential to fulfill their mission to help restore security in the tense capital.
But their orders now require them to do nothing that might alarm or give offense to Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, the Somali faction leader who only two weeks ago was their prime target.

A Retiring Barkley?
CHARLES BARKLEY said yesterday in Phoenix that he would retire after this season regardless of whether he is able to lead the Phoenix Suns to their first championship.
Barkley, 30, said his back problem -- he collapsed after practice last Saturday night -- and a feeling that his best years are behind him had strengthened his desire to quit.
"No. 1, I think 10 years is long enough to play basketball," he said Friday.
"No. 2, I know my back's not going to get better, and the more I keep playing and playing, the more it's going to hurt me down the line."

Phone Stocks Defying Their Blue-Chip Image
FOR millions of families, phone stock has long been like a rich, kindly uncle, dependably sending dividends on every gift-giving occasion.
Now it looks more like a wealthy nephew who stops by at odd times to pack the family into his sports car and roar off at 90 miles an hour (talking on his cellular phone all the while) to the town's flashiest restaurant.
This week, the ride became more fun but also more treacherous when Bell Atlantic agreed to buy Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable company.
The record $33 billion merger announcement sent investors storming into Bell Atlantic's stock, then into other phone issues as well.

Complaints Against Brokers Q. How can a client initiate arbitration when he has a complaint against a stockbroker?

Arbitration is the method used by member firms of the nation's major securities exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers for resolving disputes with their clients.
These brokerage firms require individuals to arbitrate, rather than litigate, claims or controversies -- a process that is intended to make decision-making faster and cheaper.

Review/Film Festival; Technology, a Tripod, A Romantic Triangle
The emotional twists and turns of Atom Egoyan's film "Calendar" are so thoroughly intertwined with communications gadgetry that the movie might almost as well have been called "Sex, Lies, Videotape, Film, Telephone and Answering Machine."
In the movie, which has been pieced together like an elaborate jigsaw puzzle, Mr.
Egoyan portrays a Canadian photographer hired to take pictures of ancient Armenian churches for a glossy calendar.
Accompanying him on the journey, shown in flashbacks, are his wife (Arsinee Khanjian), who serves as his translator, and a driver (Ashot Adamian), who turns out to be a walking encyclopedia of the architecture being photographed.
Only gradually does it emerge that somewhere during the trip a romantic triangle has formed that will eventually lead the photographer's wife to remain in Armenia after her husband returns to Canada.

He has written sprawling quasi-Mahlerian symphonies and stylistically jumbled stage works.

The Iran-contra prosecutor has concluded in his final report on the arms-for-hostages affair that investigators uncovered evidence of a high-level cover-up but discovered it too late to prosecute those involved, people who have read the report said today.
The document is the final word on the affair by the prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, after a six-year investigation.
The inquiry ended abruptly in December 1992 when President George Bush pardoned six former Government officials, including Caspar W. Weinberger, the former Defense Secretary.

Review/Theater; When Cattiness Becomes A Way of Life for 4 Women
Misogyny reigns in Stephan Bullard's "All That Glitters," a comedy of bad manners that makes "The Women" by Clare Boothe Luce, which it seems to have been directly inspired by, look like a feminist hymn.
A portrait of four shrill, wealth-jaded women in the twilight of the 1980's, the play presents the high-society female as primordially feline, all unsheathed claws and predatory instincts.
Mr.
Bullard, who is no more subtle than his characters, even introduces a stuffed cat, frozen in mid-hiss, into the plot to serve as the evening's mascot.
The play follows the drunken progress of a cocktail party, which takes place in the Park Avenue apartment of Clayton Maguire (Dana Vance), a successful television journalist with a career-fracturing secret.
The talk roves acidly among such subjects as designer dresses, cosmetic surgery, divorce and promiscuity, as the four women fling insults like teen-agers in a food fight.


Death Benefits Become Living Benefits
Ill with cancer, Patricia North faced a heart-rending problem last year.
Her doctor had told her to go immediately to Duke University for a bone-marrow transplant.
But her health insurer was taking weeks to decide whether to pay for the $150,000 procedure.
What could she do?
Ms.
North, a 38-year-old sculptor and painter from Northern California, found a solution in her $200,000 worth of Prudential life insurance policies.
She obtained an early payout of more than $190,000 on those standard policies, with the remainder going to Prudential for interest charges and administrative fees.
The money financed her care at Duke and enabled her husband to stay with her there for six weeks.


Jury Acquits Poles in Arms-Smuggling Trial
Four men who were high-ranking officials of Poland's former Communist Government were acquitted in Brooklyn yesterday of charges that they were part of a group that plotted to smuggle MIG fighter planes and other heavy weapons to Iraq.
A jury in Federal District Court acquitted the four as well as a fifth Polish citizen after less than a day of deliberations that followed a five-week trial.
United States Government officials said when the men were arrested in a sting operation in Germany in March 1992 that the case was part of an effort to curb illicit weapons sales to third-world nations by officials from the former Soviet bloc.

But visitors should know that Ecuador informally limits access to its Amazon region to participants in package tours purchased here or abroad.
Other South American countries -- Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela -- offer unrestricted tourism in the region.

Aristide Still Expecting To Regain Power Soon
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti said today that he expected to return to power at the end of the month despite the continued defiance of the country's military leaders, and that he did not fear for his life.
"This date is not a personal date, it is a commitment of the entire world through the United Nations," Father Aristide said, referring to the Oct. 30 date for his return to power set under an accord brokered this year by the United Nations.


Mexico Restores Floating Gardens
Almost from the moment they arrived in 1519, the Conquistadors set about dismantling the ancient city of Tenochtitlan and building upon its ruins what was to become the modern Mexico City.
Little remains from that time, but the city has just completed a $2 million restoration of one of the last direct links to the Aztecs: the floating gardens of Xochimilco.
In the far south of the city, just off the main ring road called the Periferico, Xochimilco (pronounced so-che-MIL-co) is a remnant of the five great lakes that filled the Valley of Mexico when the Spaniards first arrived.
In 1989, the city expropriated about 2,000 surrounding acres to halt development, cleaned up the water and sewage that flowed through the area, and dredged miles of canals between raised beds where farmers still grow corn, squash and many varieties of flowers.


Employee Fitness Programs Growing
ACROSS the state, businesses large and small are learning that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure -- at least where health care dollars are concerned.
Over the last decade or so, a growing number of companies in the state have been providing employees with benefits packages that include on-site physical-fitness centers, health improvement seminars and "healthy life style" meal programs, in an effort to increase employee morale, enhance employees' health and provide an added recruitment incentive.


Parks Try to Clean Up Their Act
One of the attractions of Bedford Park is its parks.
There's Devoe, Poe and St.
James, Mosholu Parkway, Harris Park Fields, Williamsbridge Oval and the Aquaduct lands.
But residents have long complained about litter, poor garbage collection and illegal dumping of household refuse in park areas.
In a 1991 round of budget cuts, which resulted in heavy losses for the Parks Department throughout the city, the Parks Department's District 7, which covers Bedford Park as well as Fordham and Norwood, lost nearly half its staff of 50.
Six months ago, Frank Colella became principal park supervisor for the district.
He found a staff of 26 and "stacks of official complaints," he said.

To the Editor:  After reading Jean Nathan's article "Yaddo" (Sept. 19), I was left wondering whether she was trying to be as clever and witty as she imagines Yaddo writers to be, or whether she just relished the opportunity to knock those lucky enough to be accepted at the art colony.
Or maybe she was hoodwinked by a love for outrageous tales.
Whatever the reasons, her emphasis on sex and goofing off was a one-sided view.
Having been a resident at the colony last October and again this spring, I know full well that zaniness periodically explodes, that some of the guests are living on the edge, that Yaddo anecdotes and lore are a source of much hilarity.
But Yaddo is primarily about talented people -- many not yet well known in their respective fields -- facing their promise and producing.


U.N. Backs Use of Ships to Enforce Haiti Embargo
The Security Council voted unanimously today to impose a naval blockade on Haiti in an effort to remove its military junta and restore democracy.
In a bid to encourage other nations to join a United States-led blockade, the Council approved a resolution calling on United Nations members to help enforce the oil and arms embargo that the Council reimposed this week.


FLAG-WAVERING
George Packer took pains to pay appropriate lip service to various constituencies of political correctness, identifying with both antiwar protesters and combat veterans in his article.


White's Talent Is Showy, If He Isn't
Devon White modestly claimed Friday that fans do not attend games to watch him play.
They come to watch Rickey Henderson make snatch catches.
They come to watch Lenny Dykstra get dirty.
But White could not fathom someone paying $45 for a World Series ticket simply to watch him.
Although White might not be as flashy as Henderson or as scrappy as Dykstra, he was worth watching tonight because his hustle, his homer and his huge run-scoring double helped the Blue Jays overcome three early deficits and stroll to an 8-5 victory over the Phillies in Game 1 at the Skydome.


'Day of Absence' Offers Fantasy on Prejudice
THE Open Cage Theater, which has had four different homes of sorts in 19 years, has spent "the last three years floating," which is the way Tina Sattin, the company's director, puts it.
Now, performances are being given in the reopened Wildcliff Center for the Arts, and, Ms.
Sattin says, the company will put on two productions a season.
After holding staged readings of plays entrenched in the black theater repertory at the Mount Vernon Public Library last summer, Ms.
Sattin chose for her first full production at Wildcliff the one she said was most enthusiastically received by summer audiences.


The It-Wasn't-Pretty File: Battle of Bobbles Goes to Blue Jays
Ask Darren Daulton how, as a catcher, he plans to help stop the Toronto Blue Jays during the World Series, and the answer ultimately contains the word "execution."
Ask Toronto's Dave Stewart how he intends to pitch to the Phillies and again the word "execution" pops up.


Botero's Nudes Lure Tourists To Park Avenue
Those giant, bulbous nudes on parade along Park Avenue have become New York's latest tourist attraction, especially among Colombians.
On a recent weekend, scores of foreign visitors snapped pictures of the 14 statues on the median between 52d and 61st Streets.
The works, by the Colombian-born artist Fernando Botero, are on view for only one more month.


Caroline Sassower, Jonathan S. Sack
Caroline Oppenheimer Sassower, the daughter of Philip and Susan Sassower of New York, was married last evening to Jonathan Scott Sack, a son of Bernard and Judith Sack of Oceanside, L.I.
Rabbi Sol Roth officiated at the Pierre in New York.
Mrs.
Sack, 24, teaches nursery school at the Park Avenue Christian Church Day School in New York.
She graduated from Syracuse University.
Her father, a general partner in the New York firm of S &amp; S Investments, is also the chairman of Newpark Resources Inc., a New Orleans oilfield services company, and of the B P Acquisition Corporation in Houston, owners of a chain of restaurants in the Southwest.

At Border, Optimism on Trade Accord
In this Texas city near the Mexican border, where the unemployment rate is more than twice the national average, Pedro Diaz is acutely aware of the promise and the perils of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr.
Diaz, a 24-year-old entrepreneur, owns a small but growing business along Highway 83 that sells automobile stereos and alarms.
Already, 45 percent of his customers come from Mexico.
The trade accord, he says, could be his ticket to rapid expansion into a more affluent Mexican market.
But larger retailers might sense the potential, too, he says, and move in to undercut him and drive him out of business.


The Mayor Receives an Endorsement From Pro-Choice Group


A Park That's Motion-Picture Perfect
The sweeping view of lower Manhattan from Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park is showing up in a growing number of films and videos.
Shots from this Brooklyn park have appeared in the movies "Scent of a Woman," "King of New York," "Romeo Is Bleeding" and "Freejack." Two weeks ago, the saxophonist Clarence Clemons and the rappers A Tribe Called Quest filmed videos in the park.
Last year, Midnight Oil used the views as a backdrop for a video.


Rangers Hear the Cheers But They're Not for Them
The cheers erupted seemingly without reason, unless you had a portable television or were wearing radio headphones.
In the middle of a timeout, the Spectrum crowd would howl.
With the Rangers on the attack, the Philadelphia fans would cheer.
"They were cheering for me, weren't they?" said Rangers goaltender Glenn Healy, the roll of his eyes making it clear that he already knew the answer.


THE NATION: Just Say 'Security'; One Clinton Promise Fits All Issues
A NEATLY dressed 8-year-old boy stood up at at a televised question-and-answer session in Sacramento recently to tell President Clinton that he has been scared to go to school ever since his brother got shot there.
In the White House Rose Garden days before, a young woman told Hillary Rodham Clinton that her sister is dying of AIDS while fighting for the coverage that her insurance company is threatening to cancel.


'The Morning After'
To the Editor:
What Katie Roiphe is reporting in "The Morning After" is none other than the historic struggle by women to define rape on their own terms.


RUSSIANS RESIGNED
Many Russians still measure out their lives by the price of bread, a revered staple that traditionally has been subsidized at huge cost by the collectivist state.
On Friday, however, with scarcely a flourish, the Government decided to end subsidies on bread, taking advantage of the state of emergency that President Boris N. Yeltsin declared after the disbanding of Parliament and a brief ensuing revolt.
Moscow also tripled the price of a subway ride -- to 30 rubles, still only 2.5 cents.


Browns' Jackson Stands By His Statements
Cleveland Browns wide receiver MICHAEL JACKSON says he didn't intend to aggravate the situation when he talked about a power struggle between Coach BILL BELICHICK and quarterback BERNIE KOSAR.
Jackson said he had discussed the remarks with Belichick and his teammates, but Belichick refused Friday to comment on Jackson's remarks.
Kosar was benched after last week's loss to the Miami Dolphins, the Browns' second loss in a row.
VINNY TESTAVERDE, a backup, will start today's game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
"The whole thing is a power play between Bernie and Belichick," Jackson told fans Wednesday in Ashland, Ohio.
"If you question Bill, you're out of line. Bernie will tell Bill if he doesn't like the offensive game plan, and if you question Bill, he'll write you right out of the game plan."


'The Morning After'
To the Editor:
Neither Katie Roiphe nor Wendy Kaminer adequately addresses the under lying issue that troubles so many feminists: passivity -- specifically, why American women are so passive and how such passivity can be changed. (Ms. Roiphe herself said in your interview that she would not have had the courage of one woman in her book, who poured a glass of milk over the head of a teen-age boy who had grabbed her breast.)


Congressional Memo; Many Health Plans, One Political Goal
They all say their health care plans are the most sensible approach to a pressing national problem.
They have to.
But the five major plans put forward to rival President Clinton's have other important purposes, too, chief among them being to establish the authors and supporters as players who will have a voice when a final bill is put together.
Some want to push a certain provision into the law or keep out an offensive item.


New Fund Tables: Ugh!
Sept. 19, this section introduced mutual fund tables that offer more data, but eliminated net asset values.
Many readers demanded the return of the N.A.V. figure.
In response to that demand, the Friday closing N.A.V. returns to the mutual fund tables this week.
The percentage change continues to appear, making it easier to compare different funds.
To the Editor:
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
What a dumb move!

Two Productions Tell 'The Buddy Holly Story'
BRIDGEPORT'S "Buddy" or Candlewood's "Buddy?" Your move.
The confluence of two productions of "Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story" -- at the Downtown Cabaret Theater in Bridgeport and Gateway's Candlewood Playhouse in New Fairfield -- proves positively that a more disposable book than the one Alan Janes wrote for the 1990 Broadway version and the London musical before that would be hard to find.


The Quiet Beauty of Beaujolais
THE heart of Burgundy is not beautiful.
Seen from the Cote d'Or hills above its capital, Beaune, the region lacks any particular charm, its indubitable attractions concealed amid a network of highways and modern wine depots that often resemble auto dealerships more than repositories for some of the world's greatest wine.
But as you head south toward Lyons and the wine becomes less extraordinary, the scenery gets better and better.
The hills of the Cote d'Or and then the Cote Chalonnaise finally assume some real stature, becoming small mountains that range up to 3,500 feet.
There are more trees, and the villages, standing like sentinels on the ridges, have a quiet, almost Italian grace.
This land of glorious vistas and charming but ultimately unprofound wines is the Beaujolais.


Mini-Cars to Race Despite Objections
When members of Manhattan Community Board 1 heard that a grand prix was coming to Battery Park City, remembering the debacle when the city tried to attract the Marlboro Grand Prix, they naturally opposed it.
Concerned about traffic jams, noise and other inconveniences to residents, the board voted unanimously against the race, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Grand Prix, despite organizers' claim that it is more of a "petit prix" because the 40 mini-cars are powered by engines not much larger than a lawnmower's.


Museum Directors Offer Job Insights
THREE directors of museums in the county held a rare public conversation here recently about their own jobs, the changing audience for art in Westchester and the importance of keeping a fresh perspective on the ever-evolving art scene.
The setting was a television studio at Westchester Community College here, where Lucinda H. Gedeon of the Neuberger Museum of Art, George G. King of the Katonah Museum and Philip G. Verre of the Hudson River Museum took part in a videotaped panel discussion to be shown continuously during "Color Options," an exhibition at the college's Fine Arts Gallery here, which can be seen through Nov. 10.


Malls Add Services to Keep Customers
HOLD on to your credit cards.
New Jersey shopping malls, trying to cope with challenges ranging from warehouse clubs to television home-shopping channels, are scrambling to keep their status as consumer icons.
As any serious consumer can attest, the number of places to spend an allowance, a paycheck or an inheritance seems to have risen sharply.
Warehouse clubs and large specialty stores like Ikea, with its home furnishings, and Staples, which sells office supplies, are moving into existing retail space along the state's busiest corridors.
Discounters and outlet stores have taken a firm hold as well.
Easy-access strip centers are enjoying a resurgence with time-starved New Jerseyans.

A December wedding is planned.


A Look at Safety At Station Houses
Jolted by the shooting of two officers by a suspect at the 70th Precinct station house in April, police officials toughened safety procedures and installed video cameras.
Now, a decision is nearing over whether all 75 precinct houses should do the same.
On April 20, Danny Cook, 27 years old, who had been arrested for heroin and crack possession, asked to go to the restroom.
Officer Robert Noblin, who was preparing to escort him to court, accompanied Mr.
Cook into the restroom, removing the handcuffs from one of Mr.
Cook's wrists, the police said.


Bach, Mozart and Faure, On Guitar, Violin or Flute
ANOTHER busy Sunday on the concert scene starts this afternoon at 2 P.M. when the Connecticut Classical Guitar Society presents a talent showcase, several local artists perform solos, plus some duos with violin or flute, by Bach, Mozart, Faure and others.
Tickets are available at the door (249-7041).
At 3 P.M. today the Naumburg award-winning Saturday Brass Quintet opens the Cole Auditorium Series at the Greenwich Library (622-7965), the Charleston String Quartet plays Purcell, Haydn and Britten in a free recital at the Yale Center for British Art (432-2850), and the Stamford Symphony (with Roger Nierenberg conducting and Benny Kim the guest violinist) reprise yesterday evening's Bruch-Schumann-Dvorak program at the Palace Theater (869-2664).


Will U.S. Be Healthier? Maybe Not, Experts Say
Suppose President Clinton's health plan is adopted.
Suppose every American gets a health insurance card and no one need worry again about being uninsured.
Will the nation be healthier?
The answer might seem obvious.
After all, 37 million Americans are uninsured.
How could the plan do anything but improve the overall health of the country?


The Last Freeway?


Devils Ride Semak's Hat Trick to Fifth Straight Victory
The Devils are off to the best start in their history, raising their record to 5-0 tonight with a 6-3 thrashing of the stumbling Islanders at Nassau Coliseum.
The previous best start in their 11-year history was 4-0.
Under Jacques Lemaire, their new coach, the Devils have a chance to equal their previous best winning streak of six games.
Their next two contests, both at home, are against Anaheim and Florida, this season's two expansion teams.


Screening Renters
To the Editor: Betsy Wade's article "A New Twist: Screening the Car Renter" (Sept. 12), saddened and frightened me.
Last May I was ticketed for speeding on the Taconic Parkway, accused of going 74 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone, clocked by radar.
This speeding incident automatically put four points on my driving record.
Since I would never intentionally drive at that speed, I can only claim the downhill descent to where I was stopped and the smooth, effortless overdrive on my car as excuses.


The New York Walk: Survival of the Fiercest
I KNOW better than to talk back to guys who hassle women on the street.
But on one weird August afternoon, I was caught in pedestrian gridlock in Times Square and the humidity turned my common sense to mush.
A young man so average-looking he belonged in a Nike commercial planted himself on the sidewalk in front of me, purposely blocking my path, and offered some not-poetic variation on "Hey, baby."
What I did next was something no short, slight, sane person should ever do: I stamped my little foot and snapped at him in unprintable terms to get out of my way, right now!
And while I was wondering why I had chosen a response that was both ineffectual and ridiculous, the street hassler smiled, stepped aside and said in a good-natured, singsong voice, "You're gonna learn to love me."

Bzzzz: Chainsaw Pleasures and Perils
A CHAINSAW can be a boon for those who have to do fall pruning or cut firewood.
Despite the brutish image, far less strength and stamina are needed to operate a chainsaw than to cut by hand.
Of all power tools, chainsaws probably are the most dangerous.
If a chainsaw can make life easier, do not let its potential hazards deter you from buying or renting one.
But learn to use it safely.


The Executive Computer; Bulky and Costly, but a Portable Succeeds
IT is too big to fit into a pocket, too expensive to buy on a whim, and at first glance it resembles the head of a robot flattened by a steamroller.
But the A.T.&amp; T. EO Personal Communicator 440 is still an intriguing device, and it provides important wireless communications and computing tools for mobile executives.
The A.T.&amp; T. EO Personal Communicator 440, until recently known as the EO Personal Communicator -- shorter, but still not as catchy as Newton or Zoomer -- is a pen-based portable computer that is finding the greatest success among workers and executives who need to fill out forms, keep data bases, send and receive faxes, check electronic mail and make telephone calls when there are no phone lines around.


On Wall Street, Love Can Soon Turn to Hate
IT was, said the utility chief executive, "the opportunity of a lifetime" and the ideal diversification.
Applauding the strategic move, eager investors leaped into the stock.
To be sure, the utility was paying a premium price, but it was getting into a growth business.
"It clearly gives them more muscle and makes them more competitive," an analyst said.
The above paragraph is not about last week's announcement that Bell Atlantic, once viewed as a safe and stodgy utility, was getting into the exciting cable television business by acquiring Tele-Communications Inc., although it might well be.
Rarely has a deal been more eagerly embraced by Wall Street.

Conversations: Khaleda Zia; A Woman Leader for a Land That Defies Islamic Stereotypes
THE ministers and minions circling Bangladesh's Prime Minister, Khaleda Zia, on a visit to New York this month boasted that she was the first Islamic woman to address the United Nations General Assembly as an elected head of government.
The Prime Minister was less impressed by the distinction.
"Hmmm," was all the reply she could muster when asked about it in her New York hotel suite.
Born in an Asian Islamic milieu, not a Middle Eastern one, Mrs.
Zia was more eager to make the point that while Bangladeshi women still suffer great privations, as do most South Asian women, there is no longer anything unusual about women in Bangladesh taking part in public life.

The Tangled Politics Behind Rival Plans
There are five major plans being put forward in Congress as alternatives to President Clinton's health care proposals.
The differences among the plans are prompted as much by political strategies as by vast substantive disagreements.


Meeting Mr. Right While on Jury Duty
To the Editor:
Regarding "When Jury Duty Calls" (Oct. 10): Almost two years ago, I arrived at jury duty with few expectations, Larry McMurtry's "Lonesome Dove," a box of Hanukkah cards and a brown-bag lunch.
Little did I know that Mr.
Right would walk through the door.
After deferring five times, I showed up to serve because I feared the sheriff would come after me.
After two excruciating days of sitting around, a new jury pool arrived.
George had also deferred one time too many and was forced to serve.


Wall Street; It's C.D. Maturity Time. Do the Banks Still Care?
OCTOBER is decision time for more than the usual number of bank depositors, who must decide whether to renew their maturing certificates of deposit at rates that are no higher than recent inflation, or seek a higher return.
"Four or five years ago there used to be a blip-up in rates in October as banks offered incentives to hold the deposits," said Robert Heady, publisher of the Bank Rate Monitor.
Now, however, banks are so flush with cash that they are reducing rates just as they have for the last 53 months.

When Smoking Is a Patriotic Duty
MEET Dr. Ei Kubota, the man with the toughest job in Japan.
As the Health and Welfare Ministry official who directs Japan's anti smoking efforts, Dr.
Kubota faces two adversaries familiar to public-health officials in the United States: the tobacco industry, whose hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising here have imbued smoking with a rakish cachet, and smokers, who find it hard to quit.


The Apartment Dilemma: Warm Outside, Cold Inside
To the Editor:
The time of squabbles between tenants and landlords about heat is upon us.
The city rule states that when the outside temperature is 55 degrees or below, the temperature inside must be at least 68 degrees.
But there are times when the temperature outside hovers between 55 and 60 degrees for several days in a row.
During that time, the inside temperature, which may have been perfectly adequate before, may drop well below 68 degrees.


Listen, Doctor, Let Sleeping Couch Potatoes Lie
To the Editor:
"Health: Make Couch Potatoes Pay More" (Viewpoints, Oct. 10) makes an excellent point, but Dr.
Uriel S. Barzel doesn't go far enough.
What about those healthy athletes who engage in rock climbing, skiing, Rollerblading or other sports likely to result in injury?
They certainly "voluntarily engage in certain unhealthy behavior."


Loan Program Aims at Asians
A loan program for small businesses on the Lower East Side and in Chinatown has been set up to help Asian owners turn to banks, rather than personal and community resources, for financial needs.
This month, two nonprofit groups, Asian Americans for Equality and Manhattan Neighborhood Renaissance, began administering $175,000 in loans for the State Urban Development Corporation.
The loans will benefit minority- and female-owned businesses in lower Manhattan, many run by Asian immigrants.


Ukrainian Work Gets American Debut Today
Richard Kapp, the Philharmonia Virtuosi's founding music director, said: "This is perhaps the most remarkable work I've shared in 30 years. It is so stunning, and its idiom so unique, it makes one wonder how the course of music might have been affected had Klebanov not been held in constraint for so long" in the former Soviet Union.


Bags, Belts and the Safety Factor
"Y'KNOW," a friend said recently, "I've been hearing bad things about air bags. I think you ought to check it out."
Uh-huh. Like what kind of things?


For the Deep of Pocket, Tailored Homes
THE grass has yet to be planted on the broad lawn of James and Eileen Farley's new house at a development called Highland Woods, off Annin Road in Basking Ridge, N.J.
The long, gravel-covered driveway has yet to be paved.
But Mrs.
Farley, who is 34 years old, nevertheless feels a sense of fulfilment.
Encountered in the driveway a few days ago, she said she and her husband had met three goals they set in 1991 when they started house shopping in the hills of northern Somerset County.
These were to find a property "in a family neighborhood, on a quiet street, with a level backyard."


Autumn in Tuscany
FANNING OUT FROM the Arno River, the Tuscan hills seem made for autumn's caprice.
The landscape can be a gentle, languid roll, or it can jut into gray, balding peaks that are as overbearing as they are regal.
In the late summer, the hills are conjugations of the color green; as the air grows cooler, the oaks and figs and balsam trees conspire to make them a morphological vista of scarlet and orange, umber, tan and rose.
For all that, Tuscany is the part of Italy that changes least.
And perhaps it is the region's abiding sense of continuity that makes it the place you consider when life elsewhere seems too complicated.


Lisa Goldfarb, Steve M. Chaiken
Dr. and Mrs.
Herbert A. Goldfarb of Short Hills, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Dr.

New Fund Tables: Ugh!
Sept. 19, this section introduced mutual fund tables that offer more data, but eliminated net asset values.
Many readers demanded the return of the N.A.V. figure.
In response to that demand, the Friday closing N.A.V. returns to the mutual fund tables this week.
The percentage change continues to appear, making it easier to compare different funds.
To the Editor:
If I have 120 shares of XYZ fund, I am more interested in the fact that they were up, say, 20 cents a share last week than I am in being told that it is a GG fund up about 0.5 percent.

THE BAND PREENED ON
I was bemused to find Frank Rich blaming "And the Band Played On" for being five years too late (Endpaper/Public Stages: "The Band Preened On," Sept. 26).
No reporters heard the music in 1979-80 when AIDS was known as the Gay Plague.
How many people died between the time that you first mentioned GRID (gay-related immune deficiency) on your back pages and the word AIDS finally appeared on your front page?

Truffaut's Ex-Wife Guards the Legacy He Left Behind
Long before his final illness forced him to make such choices, Francois Truffaut knew that he wanted to be buried in Montmartre Cemetery, in the rough-and-tumble neighborhood where he grew up.
"He loved that area," said Madeleine Morgenstern, Truffaut's former wife.
"He always joked that he wanted to see the Gaumont Palace, which was the biggest movie theater in Paris, from the cemetery."
By the time Truffaut was buried in Montmartre, nine years ago this week, the Gaumont Palace had long since disappeared.
But some of the places he treasured have remained, including the offices of Les Films du Carrosse, the company he founded to produce his work.
When he was not filming, Truffaut spent much of his time in this functional third-floor suite in a quiet cul-de-sac a block from the Champs-Elysees.
And from this same suite, scarcely changed from Truffaut's day -- bulging with neatly arranged scripts, decorated with posters of "Adele H." and "The 400 Blows" in Japanese -- Mme.
Morgenstern now runs the company.


Lenin Is Dead, Yes, but Should He Be Buried?
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's days in the mausoleum on Red Square may be numbered, and his goose-stepping honor guard is gone.
But on a recent rainy morning a few visitors, most of them foreign tourists, still trekked across the cobblestones to catch a glimpse of his mummified remains.
"It was simply not done in this country not to pay homage to Lenin," said a Russian visitor, Yevgeny Nosov, 18, a student from Pavlovsky Posad, a suburb east of the capital.
"He must have been an intelligent man. I just wanted to see what he looked like."


A Broken Truce: Clinton vs. Bush In Global Policy
President Clinton's new policy on Somalia has fostered a cease-fire in Mogadishu, but it has ended the cease-fire in Washington between the Clinton and Bush Administration foreign policy teams.
After months of keeping their voices muted, senior members of the Bush Administration opened up this week with both barrels on President Clinton, essentially accusing him of messing up a Somalia operation that they handed off to him in sound condition, and of naively believing that a President could delegate foreign policy to subordinates while he focused on domestic affairs.


The Colt and the Filly Heading in Opposite Directions
If horse racing was searching for a monster horse in a year of unknown value, it found one yesterday at Belmont Park when the 2-year-old colt Dehere won the Champagne Stakes by four lengths and unmistakably reasserted his claim as the ranking candidate for the 1993 Kentucky Derby.
But in the swirls of racing fortune, the undefeated, and highly heralded, filly Strategic Maneuver not only was beaten but ran seventh and last in the Frizette Stakes, the starring vehicle for juvenile fillies.
Young Stars
The two young stars met their fate on the day billed as the Breeders' Cup Preview, a dress rehearsal for the Breeders' Cup three weeks from now.
Dehere will be there at Santa Anita as the dominant horse of the year, the juvenile who won his first four starts with brilliance, then lost by half a length to Holy Bull in the mud before coming back to win powerfully in the Champagne.


Winning Ways With Winter Squash
THE farm stands and markets are now overflowing with brightly colored winter squashes.
Summer squashes, mostly thin-skinned yellow ones or types of zucchini in green or gold, are more delicate than the sturdy, thick-skinned winter varieties.
Fall's crop ranges in color from nearly white to yellow, orange, green and even, in the case of some Hubbard varieties, battleship gray and blue.
They come striped and solid.
Some are round, some elongated and some are deeply ridged.
There are squashes with smooth skins and others that are warty.
They may be perfectly symmetrical or lopsided.


Peacemakers Don't Have to Be Perfect
"These are not saints," the Nobel Committee's chairman said Friday after announcing that Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk had won the 1993 Peace Prize for working together to end apartheid.
Indeed, this was one of those prizes -- like Mikhail Gorbachev's in 1990, or Henry Kissinger's in 1973 -- that risked instant controversy and future embarrassment.
Many black South Africans thought Mr.
Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, should have won on his own; many whites were appalled that either man should be called a peacemaker, given the carnage still perpetrated by their unruly troops.
And there are no guarantees the new, democratic order will be any more peaceful than the old, racist one.


Coming Soon: The Inside Of Fashion
The most important player at the spring fashion shows in Paris last week was Robert Altman.
Fresh from rave reviews for his latest film, "Short Cuts," the director had come to town to do research for his next film, "Pret-a-Porter," an inside look at the hoopla surrounding the French ready-to-wear collections.
The fashion crowd, alternately enraptured by the idea of a full-length feature about their world and skeptical that anyone could do it justice, has besieged Mr.
Altman at every turn, many wanting to know how to win even the smallest cameo.
Since Oct. 8, he has attended 11 shows by well-established designers like Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Yves Saint Laurent.


Silent Salute, Ringing Impact
From that hard year of war, riot and murder, 1968, the most enduring image may be a silent, nonviolent gesture.
Twenty-five years ago yesterday, on the victory stand at the Mexico City Olympics, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their black-gloved fists in what was then known as the black power salute.
A salute!
You would have thought they had napalmed a child or burned a cross or shot a police officer.
Without a hearing, Smith and Carlos were suspended from the United States team, thrown out of the Olympic Village and forced to leave Mexico.

From Leftovers of Communism, a Czech Goulash
It is the kind of industrial nightmare that has undermined support for free-market economic reforms in other parts of Eastern Europe.
The state-owned Poldi Kladno steel mill, which once employed 20,000 people, has lost its customers in the former Soviet bloc, is far too inefficient to compete with Western producers and is struggling to avoid laying off the 9,000 workers who have not already been dismissed.
But the outlook in Kladno remains reasonably bright, because out of the leftovers of Communism the Czech Republic has been cooking up a rich economic stew.

On Sunday; New Rimes For Mariners Not So Ancient
OUTSIDE on the water, the city shoreline was a stretch of updated Whitman: bridges and skyscrapers soaring hither and yon, jetliners and ferries coursing past fiery glints of trees that glowed autumnally in the ragged marshes of Queens to the south and the busy parks of Co-op City to the west.
Inside the yacht club, Buddy Rice, a retired city firefighter, was having an early beer at the bar and chastising someone who asked him about sailing all his life out of City Island.
"That's a bad word, sailing," Mr.
Rice said, friendly in the special way of City Islanders, with an outerborough tinniness of tone and a heartiness worthy of New England.


U.S. Copter Pilot Returns Home
Michael Durant's journey home from Somalia ended on the tarmac here at Fort Campbell Army Air Field tonight to the accompaniment of cheers, waving flags and an Army band.

100 Years Of Service


Is the Postal Service Down on Collecting?
OCTOBER is National Stamp Collecting Month, and on Saturday the United States Postal Service plans to issue four stamps intended to encourage new hobbyists.
In years past, the Postal Service has come out with its promotional issues on Oct. 1.
The delay this year follows budget cuts that has eliminated the Postal Service's support of the national network of Benjamin Franklin stamp clubs, school-based endeavors designed to interest children in stamp collecting.


Double Duty


TROUBLED WATER
Many of the tests required under the current Safe Drinking Water Act have nothing to do with preventing the kind of public health problems cited in Sara Terry's article "Drinking Water Comes to a Boil" (Sept. 26).
Instead, Congress has made public water suppliers spend large sums of money to search for and eliminate contaminants that present little or no public health risks.
Thus, when "violations" occur, they are often meaningless bureaucratic occurrences that cause money to be spent for no real purpose.


Public &amp; Private; America's Sleeping Sickness
Last spring in Texas Hillary Rodham Clinton gave a courageous speech about America's greatest crisis.
We suffer "from a sleeping sickness of the soul," she told her audience, the feeling "that we lack at some core level meaning in our individual lives, and meaning collectively, that sense that our lives are part of some greater effort, that we are connected to one another." The central thesis of her speech came near its conclusion: "Let us be willing to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being."


Battle Lines Drawn in 17 Board Races
THE bottom line in the 17 County Board of Legislators races this year is this: The Republicans are attempting to hold on to the fragile majority they pieced together after the last election.
The Democrats want to win back what they say is rightfully theirs -- the unprecedented victory they saw at the polls the last time around.
In 1991, Republicans surrendered their stronghold on the Board for the first time in 83 years -- although they regained it shortly after the election when Suzanne R. Swanson, a Conservative elected on the Democratic line began voting with the Republicans on certain issues.
Also Republicans were appointed later on in the term to fill vacancies when two Democrats won seats in the State Assembly.
Having cried foul then, Democrats are now hoping to put their candidates back in those slots.
More Power for the Board
Observers of this year's contests say, however, that there is more at stake than just partisanship or predicting who will sit on which side of the aisle after Nov. 2.
They say that whoever emerges as the victor in the hotly contested county executive's race will have to face yet another opponent: a Board of Legislators that wants more say in the business of governing.
The incumbent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, is being challenged by the Democrat Richard L. Brodsky, a State Assemblyman from the 86th District.


The Taghkanic Chorale Puts A Handel Rarity on Disk
THE music was 261 years old and written by a master, but few contemporary ears had heard it.
George Frideric Handel's last Italian opera, "Sosarme," had never been recorded, so Johannes Somary, music director of the Taghkanic Chorale, undertook the project with the Yorktown-based chorus.
The group's recording of "Sosarme," conducted by Mr.
Somary and performed with the Amor Artis Orchestra playing on period instruments, is scheduled for release next spring on compact disks by Newport Classic of Rhode Island.
It was not unusual to find an unrecorded score by a prolific composer like Handel, Mr.
Somary said, speaking in his office at the Horace Mann School in Riverdale, where he leads the glee club and is chairman of the arts department.
He said he discovered "Sosarme" while studying the composer's life and work and found the opera "dramatically inspired and musically beautiful."  Concert Performance Considered
"When you study a score like this one, you think -- shouldn't that be made available to the public?" Mr.
Somary said.

No Comparison
To the Sports Editor:
In "You Should Never Think You Can Decision a House Fighter," (The Times, Sept. 26), Larry Merchant's one mistake is comparing the Whitaker-Chavez travesty to the more plausible draw between Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns.
Merchant oversimplified that fight's synopsis by implying that Sugar Ray should have lost since "Tommy Hearns knocked him down twice." While Hearns did in fact knock Leonard down twice, scoring two 10-8 rounds, Leonard had Hearns in serious trouble in two other rounds, justifying 10-8 scores in his own favor.
The rest of the fight was close enough to reasonably earn either fighter the victory, or, as the case was, result in a draw.

Toronto 8, Philadelphia 5
The Toronto Blue Jays took the first step toward repeating as World Series champions last night when they defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, 8-5, in Game 1 in Toronto.
Blue Jays' second baseman Roberto Alomar turned in several sparkling plays in the field, and John Olerud's homer provided the go-ahead run in the sixth.


If You're Thinking of Living in/Little Silver; Life on a Peninsula Near Sandy Hook
A CENTURY ago, when Little Silver was just sprawling fields and saltwater marshes, the people who lived there were farmers and oystermen.
A nursery encompassed half the town's land, growing a wide variety of plants from raspberries to long-stemmed roses, and shellfish were plentiful in the Shrewsbury River.
These days, the river's oyster beds are depleted and backyard gardens are the only reminder of the once-extensive farmland.
But the serene, verdant setting remains and people move, or stay, there to rear their children in a quiet, comfortable environment.


How Do You Like '90210' U.?
SOME students at Occidental College are worried about their school's reputation.
The small, private liberal-arts college in the residential northeast section of Los Angeles has become a prime backdrop for the Fox television series "Beverly Hills 90210," whose characters graduated from high school at the end of the last television season.
Having filmed at the college (which is called California University on the show) all summer, the cast and crew recently returned to the 120-acre campus, where they will be shooting scenes one to three days a week for the rest of the semester.
Not everybody is happy about that:


Don't Lay the Burden of Health Care Reform on Small Business; Good for Big Business
To the Editor:
Re "Business Leaders Voice Skepticism on Health Plan" (news article, Oct. 8): Although all of us don't agree with every detail in President Clinton's plan, we believe he deserves great credit for his bold effort finally to bring health care reform to the United States.
Additionally, we believe there is much in the plan that is good for American competitiveness.

SURFACING


Clinton's Remarks on Race Upheld King Legacy; Look Deep Within
To the Editor:
It would not come as a surprise to learn that political consultants understand the English language differently from the rest of us.
Such would seem to be the case in Paul Goldman's "Race Card" (Op-Ed, Oct 6).
His strenuous condemnation of President Clinton's "playing the race card" during a speech at a campaign rally for New York's Mayor David N. Dinkins certainly sounds as if what he read was different from what I read.


Revisiting A Parisian Phenomenon
Paris this Fall has a whole slew of ambitious exhibitions, but none of them is as timely as the one, now at the Grand Palais, that is simply called "Nabi." A co-production of the Kunsthaus in Zurich and the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, it recreates for the 1990's a polyform phenomenon that made itself felt all over Paris just 100 years ago in the worlds of painting, theater, decoration and the applied arts.
With close on 300 items on view and 23 substantial essays in the 500-page catalogue, this is the one-time-only chance to straighten out a long list of confusing and sometimes bothersome matters.
Just to begin with, who were the Nabis?
And how did they get the name?
The name is based on a Hebrew word (also found in Arabic) that means a prophet or seer who is in touch with a world from which the rest of us are excluded.


THE BEAT GOES ON
I am sure you will receive a blizzard of letters from the vertically and aurally challenged.
I would like to convey my politically incorrect but heartfelt thanks to Don Montague for a warm, funny and intensely human story.

How the Foliage Drama of Fall Unfolds
THIS is the time of year when practically everyone drives along a favorite route to see the foliage colors.
Local residents, who have to endure the traffic jams, refer to them as the leafers.
Quite often friends gather in car pools and meet at a designated location.
Then they leave their cars to hike through the woods, eager to reach that special place where they know the view of the fall foliage will be fantastic.
Each enjoys this seasonal phenomenon in his or her own way, but rare is the individual who does not respond to this natural autumn beauty.


For Warhorse Of the 32d, A Tough Race
For year after year -- 25 of them, to be exact -- the area that makes up the 32d District has been the politically stablest of places, so Democratic that its representative, 82-year-old Walter Ward, is now the longest-tenured member of the City Council.
This year, though, could be a time of change in the 32d.
Just as the district's quiet working-class streets and bustling commercial strips are seen as prime turf for the Republican-Liberal mayoral candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr.
Ward is considered one of the most vulnerable of the 51-member Council's 45 Democrats.


Seeking Wholeness by Studying Living 'Between the Rocks'
IN the Green River Cemetery in Springs, East Hampton, there is a rugged and irregularly placed stone in the extreme back left-hand corner, rather far from the stones of Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner and the newer grave of Elaine de Kooning, with the inscription, "A thousand birds will fly out of my mouth when I die."
I will speak of the stone, not as it now is, exposed on the top of its hill, where the ragged woods behind have been cut away, whether for the expansion of the cemetery, as some said, or for a golf course, as others seemed to think, the answer obviously available, but something in me not wanting to find out the truth about this violation.
I will speak of it as I first remember it, leaning crookedly, half enmeshed in the tangled foliage and half out.
And with the first memory of the stone, comes not a picture of Hilda Morley as she now is, or even as she was as she stood by the stone, when she first took me to see it in Springs Cemetery, but rather a picture of her from a book jacket in which she stands outdoors in profile, her long black cape blowing in the wind, and there is a sadness about her.
And then this evokes in its turn the refrains of the poems of lament for her husband, the avant-garde composer Stefan Wolpe, who died in 1972, which would teach me, almost in advance of the death of anyone that close, how to mourn.


Mechanic's Job: Keep Part of New York Culture From Disappearing
Armed with a welding torch and socket wrench, Raffaele Pepe is staving off the extinction of a cherished piece of New York culture: the lovable, lumbering Checker cab.
There are only 10 Checkers still on the road in New York City -- out of more than 11,000 yellow taxis -- and Mr.
Pepe's auto shop in Astoria, Queens, is their port of call.
The cabs now make up a fraction of his business.
But having clocked an average of 500,000 miles each on the city's pockmarked streets, they are his biggest challenge.


Hard Times for Chesapeake's Oyster Harvest
Mindree Brown balanced himself precariously on the starboard gunwale of the Estelle and lowered his oyster tongs into the James River.
Rhythmically opening and closing the spindly shafts, as though working a giant post-hole digger, he groped for the muddy treasure hidden seven feet below the river's surface.


Oct. 10-16: Harassment Case; The F.B.I. Stonewalls An Agent's Complaint
In pressing forward last week with complaints of sex harassment at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Suzane J. Doucette could claim no immediate victory beyond casting aside the unwritten rule that female agents don't openly confront the agency over its treatment of women.
F.B.I. officials would not discuss her case, citing a lawsuit she has filed against the agency.
But they insisted the F.B.I. does not tolerate harassment of women, who now number about 1,200 of the F.B.I's 10,300 agents.


Local Debate: Glut or Not?
Residents of what is sometimes referred to as the Upper Upper West Side, the area above 96th Street and below Columbia University, are balking at plans for two buildings to house homeless people.
The West 90's/West 100's Neighborhood Coalition says there are already 80 social-service sites, some about to be opened, above 90th Street, including privately owned single-room-occupancy hotels often filled with people referred by the city.


Chairwoman Jane
As an actor Jane Alexander has been both a Supreme Court Justice ("First Monday in October") and a First Lady ("Eleanor and Franklin"), so her new role, as the real-life chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, would seem a breeze.
Certainly she played it that way at her first performance, her September confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.
Alexander gave a flawless reading of her prepared statement, a script mingling heartwarming autobiography ("In 1945, a man I barely knew, my father, returned from the war") with unimpeachable idealism ("The arts are life-enhancing and bring joy").
She hit the Senators' softball questions out of the park.
And what reviews!
Claiborne Pell pronounced the nominee's address the most eloquent he had heard in 33 years, citing it as "another reason why more elocution and acting should be taught in schools." The small crowd packed into the hearing room gave Alexander a standing ovation.
The committee unanimously endorsed her a few hours later.
But even before the hourlong hearing was over, some committee members fled to more grown-up endeavors; President Clinton was giving his health care address that night.
The endowment, whose minuscule annual budget ($174 million) amounts to less than the price of one defective military bomber, resides near the bottom of the capital pecking order.
Alexander's performance did not even rate coverage on C-Span, which did find time that day to air a National Press Club address by Miss Manners.


Stephen K. Woods and Robyn P. Smith
Robyn Patrice Smith, a daughter of Lois J. Hart of Cassopolis, Mich., and the late Charles R. Smith Jr., was married yesterday to Stephen Kirby Woods, a son of Phyllis Williams of Indianapolis and the late William H. Woods Sr.
The Rev.
Steven Massey, a Lutheran minister, performed the ceremony at the Trident Castle in Port Antonio, Jamaica.
Mrs.
Smith-Woods, 35, is an owner of Great Beginnings and Endings, a catering concern in New York.
She graduated from Michigan State University.
Her mother is an interior designer in Cassopolis.
The bride is a stepdaughter of Gerald E. Hart.


Corrections
The At Work column last week, discussing health coverage for AIDS patients, misstated the number of H.I.V.-related disability complaints filed under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
Since the act took effect in July 1992, complaints have totaled 14,334, of which 285 were H.I.V.-related.


Bzzzz: Chainsaw Pleasures and Perils
A CHAINSAW can be a boon for those who have to do fall pruning or cut firewood.
Despite the brutish image, far less strength and stamina are needed to operate a chainsaw than to cut by hand.
Of all power tools, chainsaws probably are the most dangerous.
If a chainsaw can make life easier, do not let its potential hazards deter you from buying or renting one.
But learn to use it safely.


Sound Bytes; Into Media's Future, Digitally
WITH the exception of a five-day career with the International Business Machines Corporation, Nicholas Negroponte has spent his adult life as a student and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is the founder and director of the Media Laboratory.
The Media Lab is a collection of researchers, backed by 75 corporate and Federal sponsors, who explore ideas like the future of television, "smart" educational toys, intelligent agents to filter electronic mail, three-dimensional holography, high-resolution displays, and advanced computer interfaces.


Taking Music to Audiences in Hospitals and Jails
MARK JANICELLO, a young operatic tenor, recently performed for a small audience of cancer patients at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick.
"Close your eyes and your spirits start to soar," sang Mr.
Janicello, assuming the character of the tormented hero of a Broadway musical, "The Phantom of the Opera."
The audience, some of whom were receiving medication intravenously, listened with rapt attention as the singer used his vocal skills to transport them beyond the confines of the hospital.
At times, Mr.
Janicello's voice even drowned out the hospital's public-address system.


Suong-Dao Nguyen, Richard Pham
Suong-Dao Nguyen, a lawyer, was married yesterday to Richard Thang Kim Pham, the product director for Johnson &amp; Johnson in Tokyo.
The Rev.
Ephraim Vu Khiem Cung officiated at St.

Recreating a Classic Era for a New Generation of Strivers
In its heyday, central Harlem drew people from around the world to small, smoky clubs where they could hear the greatest jazz musicians of their day.
Now an ambitious development program seeks to recreate that era by bringing new restaurants and clubs to the area around 135th Street.
If the planners win the necessary approvals, the project, called Strivers Center after historic Striver's Row a few blocks north, will mix of middle- and moderate-income housing and upscale businesses, particularly boutiques, and restaurants and jazz clubs.
It will stretch from 134th to 136th Street and from Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard to St.
Nicholas Avenue, and be financed by public and private loans and city and state grants.


Reporter's Notebook; Bombing Trial: Hours of Tedium and Rare Moments of Drama
For those who might have visions of classic courtroom drama dancing in their heads -- perhaps old memories of Charles Laughton in "Witness for the Prosecution," or newer ones from "A Few Good Men" -- the current trial of four men accused of bombing the World Trade Center is bound to fall short of expectations.
The case so far has been largely a painstaking, often tedious, accumulation of technical detail, at times more like a reading of the phone book than an occasion for high drama or tense political confrontation.

Another Body, Another Show: Bravo for the Backstage Mystery
"IT always amazed Philip how the spurious glamour of his profession made even intelligent people starry-eyed," Simon Shaw writes of the English character actor featured in his backstage mysteries.
Those of us who are addicted to mystery stories about the theater flick aside such insincerity, especially from the likes of Philip Fletcher, who is, after all, described in "Bloody Instructions" (1992) as "the well-known actor and murderer." We know that the theater is where you go for glamour, adventure, danger -- and mystery.


'The Morning After'
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 19 cover is vile.
First, there is the headline, "What Is This Thing Called Rape?" -- a play on "What Is This Thing Called Love?" Then there is the graphic photo -- on which the words "Don't force it" appear -- of a square peg going into a round hole.
Is this your view of the issue of rape?  PAUL SANZENBACH  Baton Rouge, La.


An Appalachian Trail for Carolina Crafts Seekers
AT the beginning of this century, North Carolina mountain crafts were the whooping cranes of the craft world, a seriously endangered species in a changing environment with few protectors.
Even in isolated hamlets throughout the Appalachian Mountains along the state's western border, manufactured goods were gradually replacing handcrafts, the lively barter economy was declining, and the craft-dependent mountain way of life had begun to fade as families took jobs outside of their communities.
Fortunately, during the 1920's and 30's, several cultural missionaries began to organize local cottage industries, establish regional markets and found craft schools.
Besides assuring the continuation of traditional crafts -- from elaborate Cherokee basketry and hand-spun wool coverlets to whimsical folk toys -- they inspired what today is a burgeoning contemporary crafts scene.

MAKING IT WORK: The Field Marshal; While the Mayor Works the Crowds, Rebecca Miller Works the Volunteers
IT is still that yawning, second-cup-of-coffee time on a Saturday morning, but already Rebecca Miller has turned a street corner on the Upper West Side into a full-fledged staging area.
She has stacked the leaflets on top of one newsstand, the posters on top of another.
And she has stapled the signs to utility poles.
Mayor Dinkins is due in 40 minutes.
Ms.
Miller, the Manhattan field coordinator for his re-election campaign against Rudolph W. Giuliani, is double-checking the arrangements for what has been planned as a leisurely, meet-and-greet stroll up Broadway, beginning a block from her makeshift outpost.
In a campaign with so many undecided voters, the candidates' neighborhood-by-neighborhood, block-by-block field operations are considered more important than ever.
And in a year when the candidates are worried about the moderately liberal Jewish vote, the Upper West Side is important territory.


PARIS NOTES
PATRONS: Anne Bass (right) wasn't just a guest at the John Galliano show on Oct. 8; she, along with Sao Schlumberger, helped pay to stage it.
The bankroll, however, wasn't unlimited.
Mr.
Galliano convinced most of his models to work for free.
HOT NEW MODEL: There isn't one, though the oddity of Lee Watson, whose look and movements mimic those of Kristen McMenamy -- a model misfit herself -- drew lots of comment.
The only woman on the runway to receive wild applause (Sharon Stone as the bride at Valentino doesn't count) was Wallis Franken, newly married to Claude Montana.


In Paris, It's a Knack
There was no cookie-cutter sameness to what women were wearing in Paris last week during the annual spring fashion collections attended by international buyers and journalists, private clients, fashion students and an army of gate crashers.
The big surprise, along with the overwhelming acceptance of long skirts, was the parallel revival of the micro-mini, worn with white ankle socks and high-heel platform shoes.
Many women dressed in Chanel from their hats down to their shoes with signature gold chains that outlined the soles.
Others favored thigh-high Robin Hood boots over their leggings.


Editors' Note
An article on page 33 of the Arts and Leisure section today about Mike Judge, the creator of the television show "Beavis and Butt-head," mentions an incident in which a 5-year-old set his family's mobile home on fire, killing his baby sister.
The children's mother said her son had learned to play with fire by watching "Beavis and Butt-head."


Loft Residents Question Plan For Piers
A plan for the redevelopment of Piers 1 to 5 in Red Hook and Sunset Park will speed the gentrification of neighboring Fulton Ferry, some residents believe, and it makes them nervous.
They are concerned that their landlords will try to evict them.
A neighborhood of tenements and warehouses between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, Fulton Ferry has been dubbed "Dumbo" (down under the Manhattan Bridge overpass) by the growing number of artists who have moved into lofts there over the last decade.


The Days and Nights of a Supermodel
While Robert Altman was talking about making a fashion movie, another director was actually shooting a film at last week's Paris shows.
Robert Leacock, the director of photography for Madonna's "Truth or Dare," was filming Christy Turlington for a documentary he's making about the life of a supermodel.
Starting in Milan two weeks ago, Mr.
Leacock, right, whose father is Richard Leacock, a pioneer of cinema verite, has followed Miss Turlington, left, from breakfast to bedtime, capturing her being made up, strutting on the runway and disengaging herself from packs of reporters and photographers.

To the Editor:
I'm beginning to understand why Wendy Kaminer has been appointed the liberal literati's pet spokeswoman for antifeminist views.
It's not that she's misogynistic; she's just mixed up.
Apparently, Ms.
Kaminer is operating under the impression that feminists have won the war, and those of us still picketing should pack up our signs and go home.
To Ms.
Kaminer, feminists should be perky cheerleaders celebrating women's supposed sexual freedom instead of militant activists organizing against women's sexual oppression.

Playing God, With Science as a Midwife
Jonathan Tolins is an earnest and courtly young Cassandra who wants to please and aggravate everybody he can.
His play "Twilight of the Golds," which opens on Thursday at the Booth Theater on Broadway, is a comic tragedy.
Set in the not too distant future, it is about a couple who discover through a prenatal test that their baby boy is destined to be a homosexual and then wrestle with themselves and their families over whether to abort the fetus.
Directed by Arvin Brown, the cast includes Jennifer Grey, David Groh, Raphael Sbarge, Judith Scarpone and Michael Spound.
The biomedical wherewithal to make such a forecast does not yet exist and may never, despite recent news stories about scientists closing in on a gene associated with male homosexuality.
Nevertheless, Mr.
Tolins, who turns 27 this week, believes that even the possibility of science possessing the power to predict character traits like sexual orientation is an astonishing thought, one about which we had all better start thinking.

Sports of The Times; Stupid Rule Still Mars World Series
THERE is no hope for baseball.
I realize this every October.
The owners are going to botch up their search for a commissioner.
They are going to insult post-season play by putting it on regional television.
And they are going to ruin pitchers' arms by extending the playoffs next year.
This gloomy assessment of baseball comes after the Blue Jays beat the Phillies, 8-5, in the opening game of the World Series last night.
Because the dunderheads who run baseball are still bungling the designated-hitter rule, one of these hand-picked Toronto players must sit down on Tuesday in Philadelphia.


Forget Border Wars, Think Globally
According to "Business Border Wars Heat Up" (Aug. 22), Westchester's leaders apparently believe that we should match the kinds of financial incentives offered by competing states so that we can lure companies to our county.
This kind of "vestigial thinking" fails to address the major cause of our economic downturn -- global competition.
Westchester's real challenge over the next few years is not to win border wars but to reposition the county and its businesses as world-class competitors.


How the Foliage Drama of Fall Unfolds
THIS is the time of year when practically everyone drives along a favorite route to see the foliage colors.
Local residents, who have to endure the traffic jams, refer to them as the leafers.
Quite often friends gather in car pools and meet at a designated location.
Then they leave their cars to hike through the woods, eager to reach that special place where they know the view of the fall foliage will be fantastic.
Each enjoys this seasonal phenomenon in his or her own way, but rare is the individual who does not respond to this natural autumn beauty.


Judge Disqualified
The chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court said Friday that he acted ethically in disqualifying himself from considering the appeal of MIKE TYSON's rape conviction.
Chief Justice RANDALL SHEPARD denied a request to reverse his disqualification, saying it came about because his wife had a brief conversation about the case with ALAN DERSHOWITZ, Tyson's appeals lawyer.
Shepard said he would not cast a vote on whether the state's high court should hear the boxer's appeal.
The court split, 2-2, last month on whether to review Tyson's 1992 conviction.
It takes a majority vote to hear a case.
Shepard's action denied Tyson a fair chance to have his case heard, "particularly since there appears to be no vehicle for vouching in a fifth Justice to replace Your Honor and vote on transfer," Dershowitz wrote in documents made public Friday.


The Doyenne at the Heart Of 'The Age of Innocence'
Miriam Margolyes, it says in the press material she wrote herself, is "very open about being fat and middle-aged."
"I see absolutely no point in being closed about it," says the 52-year-old English actress.
"Both of those attributes are clear to the naked eye."


Luggage Thefts Rise Sharply At Kennedy
Luggage thefts are up sharply at Kennedy International Airport, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Reported thefts of luggage through July totaled 1,569, an increase of 43 percent over the same period last year, said John Kampfe, a Port Authority spokesman.
Thefts are also up at Newark, 52.3 percent, but the figures are much lower: 332 through July this year.
Mr.
Kampfe said the Port Authority police were studying where the thefts took place and whether they were random or tended to occur in particular areas.
Undercover officers have been put in place, and uniformed patrols have been shifted.
Rental luggage carts that are pulled by a passenger were involved in 469 of this year's thefts, Mr.
Kampfe said; bags can be taken off without the victim's being aware, and sometimes bags fall off unnoticed.
Carts are not available at Newark.


Coastal Trail Opens In a New Effort To Draw Tourists
NEW JERSEY officials want visitors to the state to take the road less traveled.
Two projects aimed at promoting tourism, the state's second largest industry after chemicals and pharmaceuticals, have just been unveiled.
Tourism generated $18 billion in revenue in 1992, half of which came from the Shore region.

Christiana Allaire, Paul D. Marran
Christiana Allaire, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Paul Allaire of New Canaan, Conn., was married there yesterday to Paul Demarre Marran, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
William Marran of Cold Spring Harbor, L.I.
The Rev.
Jeffrey Rider performed the ceremony at the Congregational Church.
The bride, 26, is a senior associate at Ogilvy Adams &amp; Rinehart, a public relations firm in New York.
She graduated magna cum laude from Hamilton College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
Her father is the chairman and chief executive of the Xerox Corporation in Stamford, Conn.


Keeping Beavis and Butt-head Just Stupid Enough
Mike Judge is demanding, but in a relaxed, zero-affect kind of way.
He is doing the final check on an episode of "Beavis and Butt-head" that is scheduled to run the next week.
The sound mix is bad, and an important bit of dialogue can't be heard over the track of a music video.
" 'Shut up, Beavis!' isn't loud enough," Mr.
Judge complains to the show's producer, John Andrews, in a voice that is too disengaged to sound really disturbed.
Mr.
Andrews immediately agrees to have the show remixed, and that, too, produces no appreciable response.
But then Mr.
Judge sees Beavis and Butt-head reappear on the screen and do something profoundly stupid.
Their creator gives a long, low-pitched chuckle, and in it one can hear echoes of the now-famous rhythm:


FLAG-WAVERING
Packer talks about patriotism as if we all should be able to selectively decide what we'll choose to do, and when, to be patriotic.
He states that the Peace Corps, in the 1960's, "was a way for young men to avoid going to Vietnam, but it also made them feel as though they'd endured Vietnams of their own."
When the Peace Corps began, in 1961, rules were established to prevent it from being used as a place to evade the draft.
But that all changed sometime in 1965-66.
Peace Corps volunteers were allowed to re-enlist for the remaining years of the draft, protected from service in the military for four, even six years.


Cougars Fill Seats, Irish Fill Scoreboard
Notre Dame's offensive line simply breathed and opened holes tonight.
If Coach Lou Holtz complains next week, it will be about time of possession: The Fighting Irish hardly had any.
Notre Dame scored tonight as if it had a plane to catch.
The Irish brushed off Brigham Young like lint, led by 31-0 after 28 minutes and then called off its running backs.
The Cougars managed a late first-half touchdown, madly celebrated their aversion of the shutout and then settled for this semi-massacre, 45-20.


In 'Marvin's Room'
BY the time "Marvin's Room" opened Off Broadway in December 1991, it was widely known that Scott McPherson, the playwright, had AIDS.
Inevitably, the play, which confronts terminal illnesses with dark humor, was perceived in a new context.
"Marvin's Room," being produced by the Logodaedaly Company in association with the Schoolhouse here, has nothing to do with AIDS, but it has everything to do with caring and unconditional love.


At Work; Reforming the Talk on Labor Reform
THERE was a revival of sorts on Thursday in the basement of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where more than 300 members of the labor-feminist-liberal policymaker diaspora gathered to hear papers and talk about labor law reform, a topic that for at least 12 years dared not speak its name in Washington.
Or when it did speak, it tended to be a fairly narrow conversation between business interests and the labor movement, both of which have fairly narrow and dated views of labor-capital relations, conceived in the fierce struggles of the past.
The Clinton Administration has made it clear it wants the conversation opened.
Earlier this year, Labor Secretary Robert Reich established a labor law reform commission and called it the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, signaling that he wanted the group to explore terrain beyond big labor's traditional agenda.


Sports of The Times; They Punched the Sky, and Ran Into a Nation's Consciousness
Somehow it seemed earlier than October. More like August.
That's when it was in the replays of my mind, replays that become more heroic with each new year: Tommie Smith and John Carlos take that curve in the sweltering heat of an August night.
Smith is heading for the gold, Carlos the bronze.
On the victory stand after they accept their medals, the national anthem blares.
Smith thrusts his right arm into the sky with clenched fist wearing a black glove.
Carlos: left fist, black glove.
Both are wearing black socks.


Hotel Tenants Win An Eviction Battle
Tenants have won the first round in their legal battle with the Leo House, a private residence at 332 West 23d Street that has been trying to evict its long-term renters.
Late last month, Judge Louise Gruner-Gans of Civil Court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the Leo House, which is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, was "operated exclusively for charitable purposes" and was thereby exempt from the city's rent-protection laws.

Elisabeth Ann Kuhns, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The Rev.
Craig W. Rule officiated at the Presbyterian Church at Tenafly.
Mrs.
Babington, 27, was until recently a promotion coordinator at Vogue magazine in New York.
She graduated from St.
Lawrence University.
Her father retired as the chairman and chief executive of General Public Utilities in Parsippany, N.J.


Child Maltreatment Affects the Poor More
Myths die hard, and few myths seem to have as much staying power as the myth that "child abuse cuts across all social and economic lines" but, as the District Attorney candidate Jeanine Pirro puts it, "we see it more in poorer families only because they have more contact with government services"  [ "Child Abuse Drawing Closer Public Scrutiny," Sept. 12 ] .
Of course, there are some middle-class child abusers, but the evidence is overwhelming that poverty is by far the most important cause of child maltreatment.
The Federal Government's second Study of National Incidence and Prevalence of Child Abuse and Neglect found that physical abuse was at least five times more common among poor families and neglect was nearly 12 times more common among the poor.
Many other studies have produced similar results.

Judaica Show At Emanu-El
The Judaica collection of Congregation Emanu-El will be on view from Oct. 20 to Nov. 21 at Temple Emanu-El, on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street.
Established on the Lower East Side in 1845, the Emanu-El congregation is the oldest Reform congregation in New York City.
Seventy-six objects will be on display in two large cases, one devoted to objects used in the temple, the other to those used at home.
Most of the temple's collection was donated by members of its congregation.


New Jersey Is Bellwether To Politicians Across U.S.
He may fret about the daily developments in Port-au-Prince and Mogadishu, but President Clinton is also keeping a watchful eye on this capital city.
"Usually, when I see the President the first thing he says is, 'How's my friend Jim doing?' " said Paul Begala, a White House adviser who is also a strategist for Gov.
Jim Florio's re-election campaign in New Jersey.
Although Mr.
Begala may have overstated the President's immersion in New Jersey politics, the outcome of the contest between Mr.
Florio and Christine Todd Whitman, his Republican challenger, is being watched intently by Republican and Democratic politicians nationally.
They are hoping to find signs of the viability of President Clinton's programs, as well as implications for statewide campaigns in 1994 and for Mr.
Clinton himself in 1996.


More Liquid Helps In Making Meatloaf
The article on meatloaf by Florence Fabricant  [ Food column: "Meatloaf, for the Back-to-Basics Crowd," Oct.3 ]  mentions her failure at her first attempt at it.
In my opinion the lack of sufficient liquid was the cause.
I use one egg to a pound of meat, plus seasoning, and about one tablespoon of bread crumbs.
For one-and-a-half pounds of meat, I use an additional half egg.
Just stir the egg slightly in a jar and then pour about half into the meat.
Seal the jar and refrigerate for another use.


THE NATION: Wanted: Hot Leads on Cold Cases; Now Bounty Hunters Can Make Out Like Bandits
THE prices on the "Wanted" posters are going up.
Earlier this month, the Federal Government offered $1 million to anyone who helps crack the 15-year-old "Unabom" case -- the hunt for the bomber whose parcels have maimed and killed executives and professors.


Ripe For Satire
To the Editor:
Like most of Martin Scorsese's films, "The Age of Innocence" has apparently generated considerable controversy  [ "In 'Age of Innocence,' Eternal Questions," Sept. 12 ] .
On the day I happened to watch the movie, PBS broadcast "The Great Waltz," a fictionalized version of the life of Johann Strauss II.
The films have the same plot and many of the same production values.


A Deluge of Foreign Assistance Fails To Revive Egypt's Stricken Economy
For nearly two decades, Egypt has been the beneficiary of one of the world's most ambitious assistance program, a multibillion-dollar rescue mission involving the United States' largest overseas aid operation since Vietnam, wealthy Arab neighbors, European creditors and international bankers.
All are committed to securing Cairo's political stability.
By any measure, these huge infusions of cash -- more than $35 billion in United States economic and military aid alone since 1975 -- have done much to reshape the Egyptian landscape.
The money has provided better roads and telephones, cleaner water and wider access to consumer goods.
Birth rates have declined, and life expectancy has risen.


HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL REPORT

Results Are Mixed In Fight Against Theft
The 19th Precinct has added extra police officers on the beat and new crime-prevention programs to battle theft, but with mixed success.
"Crimes of property" have always been the top offenses in the precinct, which runs from East 59th Street to 96th Street.
And though burglaries have declined by some 15 percent since the beginning of the year, car thefts have risen by 5 percent.
"Criminals know it's a prosperous neighborhood," said Deputy Inspector Peter J. Buccino, who heads the precinct.


No Violence at Supremacist March in Texas
A march and rally by a white supremacist group today drew about 300 supporters and protesters, but no violence.
A group from Mississippi, the Nationalist Movement, received a permit to hold the march after the last two black men living in a Federal housing complex moved from the all-white town because of racial taunts and harassment.
A Federal housing project here is one of 170 in East Texas under a Federal court desegregation order.


A Hotel Reopens In Key Biscayne
When Hurricane Andrew surged through south Florida last fall, Key Biscayne, Miami's island neighbor, was among the hardest hit communities.
Its three hotels, which drew around 200,000 visitors a year, sustained substantial damage, and were all closed.
On Oct. 1, Key Biscayne's 300-room Sonesta Beach Resort reopened after a $10 million renovation.
The hotel, whose grounds and interior had been devastated by the storm, now has sliding glass doors and balcony railings built to withstand winds up to 200 miles an hour.
The grounds have been replanted with salt-tolerant, wind-resistant native trees and shrubs.


Stepping into the Czardas A folk-dance tour in Budapest and Prague
ONLY hours after arriving in Budapest last March, I discovered what was unique about a folk-dance tour.
No sooner had we ordered dinner at Kalocsa Pince Csarda, a small restaurant on Baross Street, than our leader, Jim Gold, had us up and circling the minuscule dance floor, to the accompaniment of a gypsy orchestra.
An instructor from my local folk-dance classes in Westport, Conn., Jim had coached us earlier that evening in the basic steps: the czardas, a slide-together-slide side-step, and the rida, a circling step resembling the movement of a crippled stork.
"Don't worry if you do it wrong," he advised us.
"Hungarians love improvisation."


In a Politician's Eyes, Some Jobs Are Worthier
HERE is a case where economists and politicians part ways.
Economists say it should make no difference whether a worker was laid off by General Dynamics or by Woolworth -- whether a plant closed because of a specific change in Government policy like cuts in the defense budget or because of corporate mismanagement or the vagaries of the marketplace.
All laid-off workers, they say, deserve equal treatment.


Buses on a Roll
To the Editor: Having just returned from a three-week cross-country trip with my son during which we journeyed primarily by train, although we took one bus trip, I read with interest your article, "By Bus to the Berkshires" (Aug. 15).
We took the bus because we could not stand the thought of reboarding the Amtrak Zephyr after a scheduled 17-hour ride from Chicago to Denver took 30 hours.
It was not so much the delay, but the rudeness of the Amtrak personnel, the fact that the train was not cleaned and the lack of enforcement of the no-smoking areas.


Theater Shooting Raises Security Concerns
Standing in his jewelry store yesterday, across the street from a movie theater where a 19-year-old man was shot to death Friday night, Andy Daswani lamented what he sees as the decline of security along Brooklyn's bustling Fulton Mall.
"It's gotten worse," said Mr.
Daswani, who opened his store on the mall, Nu Castle Jewelers, 11 years ago.
"We are always on the lookout. People are being robbed every day -- in broad daylight. You have to have eyes in the back of your head."


Clinton's Remarks on Race Upheld King Legacy
To the Editor:
Paul Goldman accuses President Clinton of using racial "code-word politics," thereby betraying the legacy of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. in the President's remarks in support of New York Mayor David N. Dinkins's re-election campaign (Op-Ed, Oct. 6).
In so doing, Mr.
Goldman seriously misconstrues both President Clinton's remarks and Dr.
King's legacy.


Indian Troops Surround Mosque in Kashmir
Heavily armed Indian troops surrounded the main mosque in the capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir today, saying the mosque was filled with weapons and separatist Muslim guerrillas.
About 100 guerrillas were taking refuge in the Hazratbal Mosque in Srinagar, an army spokesman said.
About 1,000 soldiers were at the scene.


FLAG-WAVERING
The thesis that George Packer's generation can right the wrongs of the world by rediscovering patriotism does not even begin to identify the malaise to which he and they have succumbed (About Men: "Flag-Wavering," Sept. 12).
It is interesting that he chose to raise the shibboleth of Oliver North, who, in fact, put his finger on the problem when he stated that he lost his "moral compass," which is exactly what the members of this entire generation have lost.


At Last, Maybe, a New Beginning
City officials have agreed to begin talks with Community Board 4 on the long-stalled development of what is known as the Clinton Urban Renewal Area, a six-block section of tenements west of midtown Manhattan.
Some 2,000 people live or work in buildings on month-to-month leases in this rundown stretch (from 50th to 56th Streets between 10th and 11th Avenues), which was designated for renewal in 1969, nearly a quarter century ago.


Blaming the Bundesbank
All morning, the Mercedes and BMW limousines sweep up to the century-old hall of ceremonies in the Palmengarten, a park and botanical garden in Frankfurt not far from the Bundesbank.
The high and mighty of Europe's political and financial world climb out briskly, on their way to a changing of the guard.
Hans Tietmeyer is moving up from deputy to president of an institution that, for better or for worse, has been dominating European money matters for more than a decade.
Just as its decisions have electrified the politics of one country after another, its policies will ultimately determine whether European economic and monetary union happens at all.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany are on hand to pay tribute to Tietmeyer and to his predecessor, Helmut Schlesinger, during more than two hours of speeches interspersed with renditions of Schumann and Beethoven.
On this day, Oct. 1, Tietmeyer and his colleagues are in a convivial but somewhat defensive mood.
The British, the French, the Danes, the Belgians and other aggrieved Europeans have been blaming the Bundesbank, and its obsessive concern with curbing inflation, for wreaking havoc with the European Monetary System.
The Germans insist that one day the other Europeans will thank the Bundesbank for keeping the the German mark strong even though the high German interest rates that have kept it that way have also held Europe deep in recession.


Preserve, Protect
To the Sports Editor:
Pete Bodo's ("Historic Neversink River: A Legal Dispute Runs Through It" The Times, Oct. 3) suggests that Theodore Gordon Flyfishers advocates the use of eminent domain to acquire public fishing areas.
T.G.F. does not as a rule endorse the use of eminent domain for this or any other purpose; TGF does accept the courts' determination that the use of eminent domain to acquire both the hunting and fishing rights to the land already purchased by the State and the 1,067 acres on the west bank of the river is a legitimate exercise of state authority in this exceptional instance.


Esiason Turnaround at Key Turn
As his support system in Cincinnati slowly disintegrated around him in his last two years there, Boomer Esiason sometimes found his only solace over the telephone lines.
Many times the most reassuring voice belonged to Bruce Coslet.
"I talked to Bruce a lot," Esiason recalled.
"I said: 'Bruce I have to get out of here. I'm going to die if I don't get out of here.' "


TOPICAL FRUIT
Joan and Lydia Wilen are ecstatic.
The sister act behind "Live and Be Well," a book of food-filled folk cures for whatever ails you, have just discovered a prepackaged version of the sort of thing they've been cooking up for years: a sugar-and-lemon depilatory called Mim Natural Hair Remover.
And here's the beauty of it, Lydia says: "If all else fails, we could use it for the tea."
Not exactly appetizing, but right on target with the beauty industry's current menu.
Fueled by interest from the Snapple set, who crave exotic juices the way another generation once craved quiche, food is moving out of the kitchen and into the bathroom.
It's not the first time.
Soaking and steeping in carrot, avocado, papaya and mango is reminiscent of that 60's mantra "If it feels good, do it" -- which, back then, could mean anything, from the Wilen sisters' recipe for an avocado facial to sex, drugs and rock-and-roll.

Streetscapes/The Blum Apartment Houses; Deft, Nonconformist Touches, Many Since Vanished
GEORGE AND EDWARD BLUM formed one of the city's great nonconformist architectural firms, producing some of our most unusual apartment houses.
Now a new book by Andrew S. Dolkart and Susan Tunick, "George &amp; Edward Blum: Texture and Design in New York Apartment House Architecture," calls attention to their terra-cotta-and-tile buildings even as they are jeopardized by their own fragility and idiosyncrasy.
The Blum brothers put their studies at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris to unusual use: the nitty gritty field of speculative apartment house design.
This was -- and still is -- an industry that prizes economy and imitation rather than innovation and reflection: filing "dummy plans," the same set used over and over at the Department of Buildings, was a common practice.


Buses on a Roll
To the Editor: Lest your article on bus travel, "The Bus on a Roll Again," (Aug. 15) lure the guileless, I hasten to remind your readers that not all bus lines are the same; Greyhound is no Bonanza.
To begin with, the Greyhound number in the Boston directory leads to a recording saying the number is no longer in service.
If I were a foreign tourist instead of a native New Englander, would I know to dial 411?
Not that it would help much.
A busy signal is the usual response.
The person who answered was not much more helpful.
I did get some schedule information, but not a word about a discount for a three-day advance purchase.


Don't Lay the Burden of Health Care Reform on Small Business; Luckier With H.I.P.
To the Editor:
As an H.I.P. subscriber during my employment with New York City, and having belonged to four different H.I.P. groups during that time from 1950 to the present, I feel Vince Passaro's unfortunate experience is hardly typical of H.I.P. ("Better Try Not to Get Sick," Op-Ed, Oct. 11).
Mr.
Passaro reports that when he called H.I.P.'s emergency line during the Labor Day weekend, he didn't get a call back from a doctor until two hours later.

Frank Rich sums up the disappointment and anger many felt when they saw that HBO's "And the Band Played On" fell short of the powerful film it had the potential to be.


New Democracies for Old Europe
Why should the post-Communist countries of Europe seek membership in NATO?
Speaking for my country, I would say there are three main reasons.
First, the Czech Republic lies in the very center of Europe, which has traditionally been a crossroads for different spiritual trends and geopolitical interests.
Not a single major European conflict has left this area untouched in its thousand-year history.
Wars have started or ended on our territory, and the main threads of history have sometimes been wound together or unraveled here.
Our experience has taught us that we must take an interest in what goes on in the rest of Europe, for, like it or not, such matters always affect us more than they do many other countries.


Two Visions of Paint, Applied With Abandon
ESSENTIALLY, the subject of this review is paint -- as it is handled by two artists in their early 50's, Darryl Hughto and Stuart Shedletsky.
Mr.
Hughto's canvases -- 26 of them -- are at CS.
Schulte, a gallery that stands cheek by jowl with a Haagen-Dazs ice-cream parlor, at 340 Millburn Avenue, in Millburn.
On this occasion, the juxtaposition is apt for, as John Russell once remarked in a review, a Hughto show is like a meal consisting of desserts.
That was a decade ago, but little has changed.
In the present show, Mr.
Hughto is consistently figural -- not that it matters much, since he is clearly less concerned with content than with the surface effects obtainable with substances called iridescent and interference media.


PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
RIVERDALE The Autumn, First Hand, At Wave Hill Festival
For some city dwellers, the only evidence of the changing season is the sight of lonely brown leaves floating past apartment windows.
But the Wave Hill nature preserve has an alternative -- its annual Fall Festival of Leaves, including a foliage tour, a demonstration of herb uses and a performance by dancers emulating swirling leaves.


Jacobs Memorial Service
A memorial service for Melvin Jacobs, former chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, who died on Oct. 6, will be held on Friday at 11 A.M. at Temple Emanu-El at Fifth Avenue and 65th Street in Manhattan.


Hideko Udagawa and Harvey Dzodin
Hideko Udagawa, a concert violinist, and Harvey Cary Dzodin, the vice president for commercial standards at Capital Cities/ABC Inc. in New York, are planning a December wedding.
Ms.
Udagawa is a daughter of Masako Udagawa of Toyko and the late Dr.
Kanehisa Udagawa.
She graduated from Tokyo University and studied at the Juilliard School.
Her father was an electronics professor at Nagoya University in Nagoya, Japan, and the author of 26 books on the subject.


Beyond Issues in County Executive Contest
IT was 1 P.M. on a recent Friday and Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a candidate for county executive, was on the steps of the County Office Building, demanding that state and Federal officials look into alleged misuse of a County Medical Center fund used for miscellaneous expenses.
Those who were alleged to have misused the fund were officials appointed by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, who is seeking re-election.
Mr.
Brodsky was doing what he hopes will win the election for him -- challenging.
Challenging and Governing
Mr.
O'Rourke, who has held the county's highest office for 11 years, was not in the building, however.
He was several miles away, sitting under a sugar maple tree at Muscoot Farm in Somers, a county-run working farm, flanked by supervisors and other officials from several towns in northern Westchester, issuing a warning that impending actions by New York City on its reservoirs in the county could have a devastating impact on local communities.


Changes Loom for a Corner of Greenwich Village
CHANGE is coming for one of Greenwich Village's most tranquil and historic enclaves, which includes the Village's oldest house, its narrowest house and the Cherry Lane Theater.
Four buildings, which border a private garden mews, have offers from young architects and other professionals that have been accepted by a family that has owned them for decades.
The Cherry Lane Theater itself -- a property that includes the last two buildings in New York City owned by the family -- was put on the market earlier this month.


Elena Kugler, Geoffrey Sands
Elena Kugler, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard C. Kugler of New Bedford, Mass., was married there yesterday to Geoffrey Keating Sands, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
James Sands of Wawa, Pa.
The Rev.
G.
David Deppen performed the ceremony at Grace Episcopal Church.


Big Bets on Roasted Chicken
JOHN Y. BROWN JR. has seen this once before: in 1965, when he bought Kentucky Fried Chicken from Col.
Harland Sanders.
Two decades after selling it, Mr.
Brown is still enthusiastic about chicken -- but now it's roasted.
Two years after he co-founded Kenny Rogers Roasters with his friend, the country crooner, the privately held chain has 87 outlets in 25 states, and agreements to develop 300 more within three years.
The restaurants grossed more than $1 million each in 1992, compared with $684,000 at KFC's domestic company-owned stores.


The Mayoral Campaign -- At Issue: Fiscal Crisis; Needed: Honesty on the Budget
Crushing budget deficits await the winner of New York City's mayoral election, because city spending will continue to grow faster than revenue until someone makes painful cutbacks -- or pushes through painful tax increases.
The budget this year is $31 billion.
Projected deficits in the next few years rise to $2 billion a year, not counting new or expanded programs.
Band-Aids won't do.
Mayor David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani, his principal challenger, share an aversion to talking about cuts, so much so that neither says much about the need for radical surgery.
The Mayor stands on his record -- four balanced budgets in four difficult recession years.
Mr.
Giuliani stands on a wishful platform of spending cuts and tax cuts.


What Parson Rather Left Out of His Sermon
Courtesy demands that in musing over Dan Rather's recent criticisms of television news, one resist the conclusion that he had Connie Chung in mind.
After all, Mr.
Rather greeted his new partner with gallant affection when she arrived a few months ago to help him do a job that anchors down the years have managed to do single-handedly without visible strain.
So when he says now of the unnamed masters of his fate, "They've got us putting more and more fuzz and wuzz on the air," he cannot have in mind the undeniably decorative Ms.
Chung.
And when he accuses market researchers of subverting the judgment of professional journalists, he cannot be implying that she owes her new status to her popularity and the prospect that she may lift the "CBS Evening News" ratings.
By no means.


Winning Ways With Winter Squash
THE farm stands and markets are now overflowing with brightly colored winter squashes.
Summer squashes, mostly thin-skinned yellow ones or types of zucchini in green or gold, are more delicate than the sturdy, thick-skinned winter varieties.
Fall's crop ranges in color from nearly white to yellow, orange, green and even, in the case of some Hubbard varieties, battleship gray and blue.
They come striped and solid.
Some are round, some elongated and some are deeply ridged.
There are squashes with smooth skins and others that are warty.
They may be perfectly symmetrical or lopsided.


For New York Haitians, Hopes Are Deflated
Luc G. Olivier slumped glumly in the back of his cramped Brooklyn pharmacy, which like nearly every other Haitian-owned business in Flatbush displays a poster of the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in the window.
"This embargo is nothing," he said, referring to President Clinton's plan for economic pressure to force the Haitian military to restore Father Aristide as the President of Haiti.

Technology; New Respect for an Old Bell Vision
EVEN as mega-deals like last week's merger announcement by Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications inspire futuristic visions of an information superhighway, the Bell companies are suddenly getting extra mileage from a technology that has been around since Jimmy Carter was in the White House.
The technology, known as I.S.D.N. and invented at A.T.&amp; T. Bell Laboratories in 1978, was once heralded as a modern digital replacement for conventional telephone service.
It would allow simultaneous voice and data services over a standard telephone line and be expandable to offer much higher data speeds for video in the future of optical fibers.
But for years, most consumers saw no need for I.S.D.N. -- short for Integrated Services Digital Network -- and the phone companies couldn't figure out how to sell it.


Buckeyes Score Late To Defeat Spartans
Ohio State 28, Michigan State 21
Raymont Harris scored on a 7-yard run with 1 minute 6 seconds left in the game as Ohio State overcame five turnovers to hold off Michigan State, 28-21, yesterday in Columbus, Ohio.


Caroline Sullivan, John M. Cathey
Caroline Harper Sullivan, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
William W. Sullivan 3d of Columbia, S.C., was married there yesterday to John Murray Cathey, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Sterling E. Cathey of Locust Valley, L.I.
The Rev.
Alan Avery performed the ceremony at St.
John's Episcopal Church.
Mrs.
Cathey is a fashion designer for the Carlisle Collection, a line of women's clothing, in New York.
She graduated from Hollins College.
Her father is the founder, president and chief executive of the Sullivan Agency, an advertising and public relations firm in Columbia.


THE WORLD: Haiti's Curse; Power Means Brutality; Practice Makes Perfect
FOR most of Haiti's history, the formula insuring its misery has been depressingly simple: a mulatto elite leaves politics to a professional class of brutal demagogues free to do what they will with the country as long as the elite's monopolies are untouched by the hand of government.
"Leave the rich alone to do what they've always done," says a disgruntled army officer in the recent novel of Haiti, "No Other Life," by Brian Moore, explaining the system perfected by the bloody, 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship.
"In turn, they're grateful for being spared and so they render unto Caesar."


Farrakhan Agrees to Postpone Rally Until After Election
The Rev.
Louis H. Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, whose preachings have attracted support among some blacks but have infuriated many Jews, has postponed a large rally he had scheduled at Yankee Stadium on Oct. 30, three days before the New York City mayoral election, an aide announced yesterday.
The decision to postpone the rally by Mr.
Farrakhan, who once referred to Judaism as "a gutter religion" and who has made other anti-Semitic remarks, appeared to relieve Mayor David N. Dinkins of a politically awkward and possibly harmful situation on the eve of the election.


Quakers Perform According To Script
It is still too early to tell whether Pennsylvania is a legitimate contender to Princeton's claim on the Ivy League throne.
But after yesterday, one thing is certain: the Quakers are leagues above Columbia.
In front of a homecoming crowd of 8,605 at Wien Stadium, on an almost balmy October afternoon, the Lions played out an all-too-familiar script that featured the same story line and, of course, the same ending.
In the end, it all added up to yet another loss, this time by a score of 36-7.


Michigan Spoils Penn State Festivities
The scene was ripe: it was the 1,000th game in Penn State football history, played before the largest crowd in Beaver Stadium history (96,719), against the titan of a new conference, Michigan of the Big Ten, on a beautiful autumn afternoon.
But there was no pleasure in Happy Valley. The result: Wolverines 21, Nittany Lions 13.


Slava Hazin and Karen E. Field
Karen Ellen Field, the daughter of Doris and Arthur Field of New York, was married yesterday to Slava Hazin, a son of Milia and Asia Hazin of Singer Island, Fla.
Cantor Richard Botton performed the ceremony at the Harmonie Club in New York.
Mrs.
Hazin, 27, is a law student at Yeshiva University.
She graduated from Vassar College, as did her husband.
Her father is a partner in the New York law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling.


A FEW VERDICTS IN BEATING CASE
The jury in the trial of two black men accused of beating a white trucker during last year's riots here told the judge today that it had reached verdicts on some counts but was deadlocked on others, including some of the most serious.
The judge, John W. Ouderkirk of Superior Court, dismissed the jury until Monday, when he said he would read the verdicts in the racially charged trial.
He said he would also ask the jury to try to reach agreement on the charges on which it had deadlocked.


Wannstedt's Magic Changing Bears Into Gazelles
It happened Thursday during a Chicago Bears practice.
Quarterback Jim Harbaugh scrambled toward the sideline.
Trace Armstrong, the quick defensive end, raced after him and hit him, and both of them crashed into a cyclone fence.
Dave Wannstedt, the Bears' new coach, held his breath for a moment.
Then, when he saw no one was hurt, he smiled.
Here were two key players going all out in practice during a bye week.
His team was playing the way he had been preaching -- with enthusiasm, emotion and aggressiveness.


Even in Fall, It's Easy to Love a Crab
EVERYBODY gets all soft and squishy over crab apple trees in May, and no wonder.
Those clouds of fragrant pink, white and rose-red blossoms go straight to your heart -- and then, in one short week, fall like velvet snow.
"I always tell people this is the most romantic spot in New York," said Sarah Price, the curator of the Conservatory Garden in Central Park, on Fifth Avenue at 105th Street.
"The petals fall in your hair, and you listen to the bird songs."


Oct. 10-16: A Breather in Tokyo; Yeltsin Gets a Chance To Travel and Do Little
Boris N. Yeltsin visited Tokyo last week, a trip less notable for what was negotiated than for the fact that it happened.
Only a week after troops had shelled Russia's parliament to keep him in charge of the country's fitful journey toward democracy, he felt secure enough to keep a long-standing date.
Russia, under a state of emergency, stayed quiet.
Not that anything much was accomplished.
The basic obstacle was that Japan and Russia still haven't signed a peace treaty concluding World War II, having been stymied by a dispute over four sparsely inhabited islands seized by Soviet troops at war's end.


POSTINGS: Marketing Target: Foreign Missions; A 23-Story Office Tower To Go Up Opposite the U.N.
Who says there's no new commercial construction in New York?
Come April, the developers Anthony and Vincent Albanese are going to start building 871 United Nations Plaza, a 23-story, 100,000-square-foot office tower across the street from the United Nations.
And, displaying an optimism that is certainly uncharacteristic -- some might even say unrealistic -- in this glutted real estate environment, they expect it to be fully occupied by the time the building is up, probably in late 1995.


Time to Change Farmland Assessment
Given the documented statewide abuse of the New Jersey Farmland Assessment Act ("Farm or Fake? State Is Checking Up," Sept. 19), it is obvious that local, country and state officials have little capacity and/or the ethical fortitude to enforce this 1964 state constitutional amendment.
Illegal farmland assessment has become an important political perk offered under New Jersey's "justice and democracy for a select few" home rule system.
Farmland assessment is held by less than 2 percent of New Jersey's population but accounts for nearly 25 percent of the state's land mass.


Don't Lay the Burden of Health Care Reform on Small Business
To the Editor;
We are a "small" company in business for 40 years employing 80 people.
We have listened to President Clinton's health care reform proposal and agree that a plan covering all Americans is overdue.
However, the President is misguided if he plans to have small business pay the cost.


Clinton's Remarks on Race Upheld King Legacy; Dealing the Other Way
To the Editor:
President Clinton's claim that "too many of us are still too unwilling to vote for people who are different than we are" is more revealing than the President or Paul Goldman ought to be comfortable with: How many black people voted against New York's Mayor David N. Dinkins ("The Race Card," Op-Ed, Oct. 6)?
If we compare that figure with the percentage of white people who voted for him, Mr.
Clinton's assertion becomes an interesting faux pas.


Bonner Muscling His Way Into the Knicks' Picture
When Anthony Bonner left practice recently with a cut lip and a bloodshot eye, Doc Rivers couldn't resist making a comment.
"Welcome, Anthony," Rivers said with a smile. And Bonner, cut lip and all, smiled back.


Ms. Reifler, Capt. Schaefer
Dana Reifler, a lawyer, was married last evening to Capt.
Lawrence Schaefer, an assistant staff judge advocate with the Air Force.
Judge Howard Levine of the New York State Court of Appeals in Albany officiated at the Saratoga Sheraton Hotel in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
Mrs.
Schaefer is an associate in Parkowski, Nobel &amp; Guerke in Dover, Del.
She graduated from the State University at Binghamton, N.Y., and she and her husband received a law degrees from Syracuse University.


Simms at 38: Unbroken And Also Unchanged
He is a quarterback who doubles as a walking piece of history, a player who has outlasted several presidents and countless pro football coaches.
Phil Simms is on a grand voyage that began as a first-round draft pick in 1979 and continues in 1993.
He is a slightly weathered piece of granite on a ride that has casually escaped the erosion of time.
Simms, 38, is currently in The Zone: His 94.9 quarterback rating is fourth in the National Football Conference and his eight touchdown passes are first.
Today, the Giants play the Philadelphia Eagles for first place in the the N.F.C.
East, with the Eagles being a team that Simms has not played well against.
Philadelphia will give this Simms rebirth its biggest test.


TENSION IS RISING AS HAITI MILITARY TIGHTENS ITS GRIP
Tension rose in Haiti today as the police and soldiers set up roadblocks throughout the capital and United States warships moved into position to enforce a United Nations embargo.
The moves by the Haitian military came one day after the deadline for the Army commander and the Port-au-Prince police chief to resign under a settlement intended to restore the deposed President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.


Forget the Butler; the Medical Industry Did It
"THE FUGITIVE" is one of the year's biggest hit movies, drawing rave reviews and, more important, crowds week after week.
Yet one central aspect of the movie seems to have eluded comment.
The movie's premise -- why the fugitive is a fugitive -- involves a drug company so evil that it distorts its research findings in an attempt to get a deadly drug on the market and will stop at nothing, even murder, to do so.
In "Jurassic Park," another blockbuster, the culprits are scientists: one who steals dinosaur embryos to sell them to a bioengineering rival, one who builds the theme park and another, an arrogant molecular geneticist, who not only creates dinosaurs but tries to make the species incapable of reproducing -- and fails.

Ethnic Dishes in a Traditional Setting
AS a restaurant town, Danbury frequently surprises us, both for its ethnic range and its modest prices, among the lowest in Fairfield County.
New to the Danbury scene (since June) is David's Cafe, which follows the local pattern of moderate prices.
In its menu, David's Cafe follows no single ethnic theme, but offers Italian, French, Cajun and Asian dishes, as well as several cross-cultural combinations.
Descriptions of some dishes sounded curious, but turned out to be more conventional (and often far better) in reality.

New Hamptons Film Series Aims High
A SNOB thing.
Rich people's sport.
Political self-promotion.
A tourist attraction.
Yes, it must be yet another film festival.
Darryl Macdonald concedes that there are such skeptical reactions -- "Just what the world needs, one more!" was his -- when asked to be artistic director of the first Hamptons International Film Festival, which begins on Wednesday and lasts through Sunday.


Susan E. Edgar, John Michaelson
Dr.
Susan Elizabeth Edgar, the executive director of the New York City School Volunteer Program Inc., a literacy program, was married yesterday to John Charles Michaelson, a managing director at Needham &amp; Company, an investment bank in New York.
The Rev.

The New York Walk: Survival of the Fiercest
I KNOW better than to talk back to guys who hassle women on the street.
But on one weird August afternoon, I was caught in pedestrian gridlock in Times Square and the humidity turned my common sense to mush.
A young man so average-looking he belonged in a Nike commercial planted himself on the sidewalk in front of me, purposely blocking my path, and offered some not-poetic variation on "Hey, baby."
What I did next was something no short, slight, sane person should ever do: I stamped my little foot and snapped at him in unprintable terms to get out of my way, right now!
And while I was wondering why I had chosen a response that was both ineffectual and ridiculous, the street hassler smiled, stepped aside and said in a good-natured, singsong voice, "You're gonna learn to love me."


Palermo Watches, and Hopes
Two years, three months and nine days ago, Steve Palermo was shot in the back as he tried to foil a holdup in Arlington, Tex.
He hasn't umpired since, but he has counted the days since the incident.
The former American League umpire was here for the first game of the World Series tonight, walking with the help of two canes but fervently hoping for more in the near future.


3-Year-Old Is Hit by Buckshot in Brooklyn
Two people, including a 3-year-old boy playing on the street, were wounded yesterday after a man began shooting during a dispute in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the police said.
They said the bullets were unusual: casings for a .357 revolver were apparently emptied of their lead slugs and filled with buckshot.
The police arrested Dejuma Campbell, 21, of 415 Lafayette Street, said Sgt.
Frances Haimeck, a police spokeswoman.

Going the Extra Mile To Find Used LP's
To the Editor:
I guess I must have been one of the two women your writer spotted at Academy Books ("Single-Minded Shopping," Oct. 3).
However, as an avid collector of unusual opera recordings, I'm more often in that store for their excellent secondhand LP's.
The records are cheap, in good condition and are almost always accompanied by their original liner notes.
I like to think that their previous owners played them often, with care.


Auburn's Defense Stops Florida When It Counts
Auburn 38, Florida 35
Scott Etheridge kicked a 41-yard field goal with 1 minute 21 seconds left and Auburn's defense stopped Florida when it mattered most as the Tigers beat the previously unbeaten Gators, 38-35, in Auburn, Ala.


It's a Blue Jay Day, Technically and Tactically
Canada's premier baseball team won last year's World Series in a foreign land, depriving its fans of the immediate and up-close thrill.
But tonight the Toronto Blue Jays provided home-field ecstasy by taking a successful first step toward a second successive championship.
With timely and hefty hitting from Devon White, brilliant fielding from Roberto Alomar and stingy relief pitching from Al Leiter, the Blue Jays overcame Juan Guzman's shaky start and downed the Philadelphia Phillies, 8-5, in the first game of this year's World Series.
Toronto won last year's Series with a victory in Game 6 in Atlanta.


Paper and Children's Masks
SAMPLES of paper made from artichokes, day lilies and yuccas are marked "please touch" in an exhibition called "Papermade: N.J." at the New Jersey Designer Craftsmen Gallery in New Brunswick.
These plants were boiled, chopped in a blender and then spread on a framed screen to drip dry as paper pulp.
Paper, a big portion of the disposable litter of modern life, is turned into a valued craft medium in this exhibition and another current show.
The New Jersey Designer Craftsmen display includes flat and dimensional designs created of handmade paper by 29 artists.
"Face to Face," at the Monmouth Museum in Lincroft, is a fantasy show of masks made by schoolchildren, using paper and innovative materials not normally found among classroom art supplies.
Both shows are part of the statewide celebration of the Year of American Crafts.

SISTERS UNDER THE SKIN
I hope that in the 25 years that Audrey Edwards and Jo have maintained their cross-racial friendship they have also dispelled their own apparent prejudice toward lesbians (Hers: "Sisters Under the Skin," Sept. 19).
I grant that a straight woman might be forgiven for having had difficulty adjusting to a lesbian roommate when she was 18, in the 1960's.
But how come Edwards's essay still implies that there is some sort of moral equivalency between a minority sexual orientation and a minority-bashing Ku Klux Klan?

An Appeal To Shoppers Is Rewarded
Adriana's Bazaar, an international cooking store on Broadway between 75th and 76th Streets, has been struggling to survive ever since Rochelle Zabarkes opened it two and a half years ago.
The store, big and airy behind a high teal awning, sells condiments, pottery and spices from around the world, like lemon grass, curries and dried peppers.


New Fund Tables: Ugh!
Sept. 19, this section introduced mutual fund tables that offer more data, but eliminated net asset values.

In response to that demand, the Friday closing N.A.V. returns to the mutual fund tables this week.
The percentage change continues to appear, making it easier to compare different funds.

Your new mutual fund historical performance data is interesting but of no value whatsover.

THE BUFFALO RETURNS, AS DINNER

Towns Object to New Water Proposals
ALARMED by the extent to which New York City's proposed watershed-protection regulations would affect local municipalities' rights of self-determination, town supervisors from Bedford, Lewisboro, North Castle, North Salem, Somers and Yorktown met recently with County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke at Muscoot Farm in Somers to sign a letter of complaint to the city's commissioner of environmental protection.
Among other requests, the county and those municipalities have asked the city to provide financial support for the watershed towns' efforts at compliance, reasonable review deadlines and an appeals process, environmental standards that would be in line with state and Federal requirements and local enforcement protocols.

Commercial Property: Downtown Manhattan; At Last, Prime Office Space Shows Signs of Demand
THESE last few years, the three words have been an almost obligatory codicil to any market comment.
Leasing activity is picking up except for downtown.
Rents are firming except for downtown.
Big blocks of space are scarce except for downtown.
Well, add another sentence to the list.
No one has a clue about whether the real estate market is really improving -- except for downtown.
While brokers and owners continue to waffle over whether midtown is doing better or worse or staying about the same, all seem to agree that prime space in downtown is enjoying a renaissance of sorts.

Corrections
The What's Doing column on Aug. 15, about Seattle, gave an outdated listing for one of two Gravity Bars.
A reader's letter dated Sept. 22 pointed out that in addition to a location on Broadway East, there is a Gravity Bar at 113 Virginia Street, not on Pine Street; its telephone number is (206) 448-8826.
The reader also pointed out that the column located the Pike Place Market imprecisely.
It covers about seven acres, bounded by Virginia and Pike Streets and First and Western Avenues; it is not simply at the north end of First Avenue.


Quebec Opens First Casino
Casino gambling has arrived in Quebec.
The first of two casinos in the province opened this month in Montreal in the Palais de la Civilisation, built for Expo '67 on Ile Ste.-Helene in the St.
Lawrence River.
Previously the building, which served as the French pavilion during the international exposition, housed visiting art exhibitions.
It has now been refurbished as a casino designed to accommodate 5,000 people, including 1,500 players.
Unlike casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, the one in Montreal, managed by the provincial government under Loto-Quebec, the agency that has been offering daily and weekly lottery games since 1970, is not operating around the clock, a spokesman said, but is open every day from 11 A.M. to 3 A.M.
Among games being played at 65 tables are roulette, blackjack and baccarat.
There are also 1,200 slot machines.
Craps, however, will be absent, the spokesman said, because dice games are forbidden by law in Canada.


Life May Be a Madness, but It's Also a Poem
You can tell that Noel Pearson became a theatrical producer and not the priest he once thought he'd be by his two favorite words.
The first is madness, which he uses to describe everything from talent to the weather.
The second is delivered so often in his Irish brogue that it's almost a chant.
It rhymes with hooking, except when it rhymes with hook.
Actually, Mr.
Pearson inspired great choruses of this favorite word from the crew of the 1992 Tony Awards broadcast when he accepted the best play award for Brian Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa." Mr.
Pearson had produced the play about five Irish sisters in the summer of 1937 first at the Abbey Theater here, where he had been the artistic director.
With the Tony show almost 15 minutes past its scheduled end, he pulled a book from his pocket and announced he would read "a wee short poem by William Butler Yeats, who founded the Abbey nearly 100 years ago."

After Raid, Somalis Struggle With Anger and a Weariness
Halima Farah Mohammed, a 38-year-old policewoman who has worked with the United Nations mission here, was walking home on a Sunday afternoon when she heard the dull thumping sound of approaching helicopters.
At first she stared, she said, then started running when gunfire tore through the sky and hit the houses around her.
Her thought was to race first to her blind, elderly father's house to make sure that he was indoors, then next door to her own house to tell her four children to stay under cover.

Homework Changes Timidity to Bravado
GO home and study was the alternative that Anatoly Karpov took when Jan Timman confronted him with the adventurous Vienna Variation of the Queen's Gambit in Game 4 of their version of the world championship.
Karpov, the former titleholder, would not risk a real fight; though he had White and the advantage of the first move, he played a toothless 20-move draw.
Ready after three days, Karpov took up the challenge and surprised Timman with a rarely played move that led to his victory in Game 6 in Arnhem, the Netherlands.
Then Timman countered with his own Vienna homework and made a draw in Game 8, but, of course, that could not wipe out his earlier zero.


SOAPBOX: On the Streets Where They Live; A Writer Finds A Way to Heal A Sore Heart
I WAS walking down Seventh Avenue into the garment district one summer afternoon, thinking, Any minute I'm going to lose my balance.
Heat had become haze, haze had become glare, the glare felt threatening.
I always imagine the city as impervious to weather, but whenever it's really hot or really cold the atmosphere becomes desperate.
Trucks grind their gears in panic; people look as though they can't remember whether to cross on the red or the green.


'The Big City Newcomer Blues'
I never thought that at the ripe old age of 28, I'd be shaking my head at "these kids today," but I was appalled at the young college graduates who voiced their views in your Sept. 26 article, headed "The Big City Newcomer Housing Blues," about finding their first apartments in New York City.
In particular, I was shocked at one woman's statement that $30,000 is "nothing here." When I moved to the city from Ohio in 1987, fresh from college with a degree in English Literature, I felt lucky to find a job as an administrative assistant paying $19,500.
I've managed to survive, living in and around Manhattan, even though it took me years to achieve a salary of $30,000.

Sports of The Times; King's Prescription Just Doesn't Add Up
TWO weeks ago, Don King, the promoter whose conflicts of interest are beyond the Marquis of Queensberry rules, offered in the Backtalk section of The New York Times what he described as a "pugilistic prescription" to help cure boxing's real ailments ("A Seven-Point Plan to Help Get Boxing Off the Canvas," The Times, Oct. 3).
Nowhere did the prescription suggest a remedy for one of boxing's most acute ailments: Don King himself.


Seeking Help and Enthusiasm in His Home Base, Dinkins Returns to Black Churches
Mayor David N. Dinkins has gone home to the black churches in this campaign, wooing the pastors and congregants who have sometimes felt taken for granted by the man they helped elect as New York City's first black Mayor.
In folksy stump speeches and closed-door meetings with hundreds of ministers, Mr.
Dinkins is working to convince black churchgoers that he has delivered for them on issues varying from health care to housing to the prevention of police brutality, and they are responding warmly.

Unmasking Roots of Washington Heights Violence; Residents Point to Overcrowding, Distrust of Police, Poverty and Thriving Drug Trade
After last summer's disturbances, a firebombing that injured two firefighters and the recent killing of a housing police officer, Moises Perez has a blunt reply to those who wonder just what is happening in Washington Heights.
"You think they're getting the message?" said Mr.
Perez, the executive director of Alianza Dominicana, a social service group in Washington Heights.
"They can't ignore us anymore. We need people to come here with real responses to these problems."


A Few Artless Minutes on '60 Minutes'
WATCHING MORLEY Safer's broadside against the contemporary art world on "60 Minutes" a few weeks ago, I felt transported in time.
To 1913, to be precise, the year the Armory Show introduced European modernism to a largely baffled American public.
When Mr.
Safer spoke about "worthless junk" and "the trash heap of art history" and, standing in front of a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, asked a group of teen-agers the familiar question -- couldn't they do better than that? -- I thought of one of the Armory Show's more vituperative critics.
He called it "stupefying in its vulgarity" and singled out Matisse for creating "patterns unworthy of the mere ignorance of little children and benighted savages . . . patterns insanely, repulsively depraved."
The Armory Show critic was, of course, Duncan Phillips, who in the years just after that exhibition became one of the most serious converts to modernism and one of the most perspicacious collectors of Matisse; in 1921 he founded the first museum in the United States dedicated to modern art, in Washington.
Phillips developed discrimination, precisely what Mr.
Safer's report lacked -- while at the same time it decried that lack in contemporary art circles.

In a 1,000-word piece, Don Montague manages to describe his wife as a "dejected stranger" and a "bogus mate" and her pregnancy as "nine months of fevered anguish." I laughed, but uncomfortably, because he ridicules what is a sacred and profound process.

And to Think That People Once Mocked the Victorians
Twenty-five years ago, Victorian was a term of disdain.
But with today's tastes running to the opulent, the Victorian proclivity for enrichment seems right in step.
In fact, as is evidenced by some of the more lavishly embellished items in "Toward Modern Design: Revival and Reform in Applied Arts 1850-1920" at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, Victorian style is now viewed by some experts as the precursor of modern.
"Our concepts of the 19th century and of modern have changed," says David Revere McFadden, the museum's curator of decorative arts, who organized the show.
"Modern means design of the recent past and is no longer restricted to just pure form. Today the term also includes what seems like the entire history of ornament."


Autumn in Tuscany
FANNING OUT FROM the Arno River, the Tuscan hills seem made for autumn's caprice.
The landscape can be a gentle, languid roll, or it can jut into gray, balding peaks that are as overbearing as they are regal.
In the late summer, the hills are conjugations of the color green; as the air grows cooler, the oaks and figs and balsam trees conspire to make them a morphological vista of scarlet and orange, umber, tan and rose.
For all that, Tuscany is the part of Italy that changes least.
And perhaps it is the region's abiding sense of continuity that makes it the place you consider when life elsewhere seems too complicated.

Military Principle Was Violated in Somalia
To the Editor:
The tragic U.S. losses in Somalia occurred because the United States Quick Reaction Forces there were under independent U.S. command.
They acted without notification to or coordination with the United Nations command.
This violation of the military requirement for command unity was the primary reason the Rangers were isolated for 12 hours and suffered extraordinary casualties.


Quebec Party Now Pursues Ottawa Role
Lucien Bouchard, a truck driver's son with a gift for oratory and the populist appeal of Ross Perot, is rattling federal politicians as he rolls up support in Quebec for a party aiming to prepare Canada for sovereignty for the province.
His Bloc Quebecois, competing in a federal election for the first time, gets the vote of Claude Labrie, age 33, a shipyard worker and union delegate at the wind-swept MIL Davie yard at Levis-Lauzon, on the south bank of the St.
Lawrence.
MIL Davie, with its payroll of 3,500, is not only one of Quebec's biggest employers but also its last shipbuilder.


Who Makes the Rules in Chinese Movies?
Chen Kaige, the director of the acclaimed film "Farewell My Concubine," shakes his head incredulously at the most bizarre episode of Chinese censorship in recent memory.
As one of the most important of China's so-called Fifth Generation directors, he understands what it is to push the limits of state censorship under Communist Party rule.
But "Concubine," his fifth film in 10 years, has set a record of sorts.
It was banned and unbanned twice as China was seeking international support to play host to the Olympic games in 2000.
It was also banned in democratic Taiwan, the home of Tomson Films, its producer, and a lucrative market for any Mandarin Chinese language film.
"This is not good for me," says Mr.
Chen.

Editorial Notebook; The Perils of 'Nation Building'
Sending U.S. soldiers to poor and turbulent countries for "humanitarian" purposes is an old American story.
Equally familiar are years of frustrating debates on how the Marines can restore order, nurture civil society and protect U.S. interests without taking sides in the host country's internal quarrels.
The problem all along, of course, has been that soldiers are neither suited nor trained for these tasks.


Doubts About Dinkins in Canarsie Keep Area a Citadel for Giuliani

Of course, the Gardinis say, they are voting for Rudolph W. Giuliani.


83 Yards in 83 Seconds: Alabama Salvages a Tie
Throughout the stands in Legion Field, the joy at the climax of a last-minute Alabama comeback was suddenly replaced by the numbing realization that while the Crimson Tide had somehow found a way to survive the Tennessee Volunteers, they had not beaten them.
Jay Barker dived 1 yard at the end of an 83-yard drive he commanded with Alabama's undefeated streak in danger and then David Palmer replaced him at quarterback to sweep in for a 2-point conversion that tied the Volunteers, 17-17, today with just 21 seconds to go.


Wall Street; A Deal That Truly Was a Surprise
CALL it the stealth merger.
On Wall Street, where word of unannounced deals used to leak faster than a morning diaper, some news is suddenly, well, news.
Almost as noteworthy as the announcement Wednesday morning that Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc. would be engaging in the nation's biggest-ever merger was the fact that the parties to the transaction had managed to keep it quiet.


World Markets; OPEC Sits Atop Shaky Barrels
THE good news for OPEC is that oil prices stand about $2 per barrel higher since the oil cartel struck a deal in Geneva last month to rein in the runaway production of oil by some of its 12 member countries.
The bad news is that these higher oil prices are still roughly $3 a barrel below where they were a year ago.


Hunt for Volunteers Grows Harder in a Changing World
EVELYN M. STOCK has been volunteering for more than 25 years, but things have got out of hand.
Now the Scarsdale resident serves as president of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, chairwoman of the county's Women's Advisory Committee and chairwoman of the Committee on Fair Campaign Practices.
She is also on the Board of Cooperative Educational Services of Southern Westchester and serves as first vice president of development for the New York State League of Women Voters.
"No one would have expected this of anybody 20 years ago," Mrs.
Stock said.
"Normally, you could do any one of these jobs and consider yourself very busy. I'm doing lots and lots of things that in other times would have been covered by five or six people. But the pool of people available to do volunteer work -- especially to take on big jobs -- has shrunk. There are days I feel like a dinosaur." A Decline in Active Membership
In fact, Mrs.
Stock represents an increasingly rare breed: the full-time female volunteer.
And volunteer organizations ranging from Junior Leagues to hospital auxiliaries are struggling to adapt themselves to the changing profile of their membership: working women who may not be willing or able to give large amounts of time to volunteering.

Port-au-Prince: City of Many Divides
The hilltop suburbs of Petionville are dotted with gleaming white concrete two- and three-story houses, and the streets are dotted with art galleries, continental restaurants and discotheques.
At the bottom of that hill is Cite Soleil, a cluster of one-room houses built of cardboard and tin.
There, art is the multicolored murals on the streets, and a woman selling deep-fried pork and plantains in the street is the restaurants.
Loud music from cars provides a makeshift nightclub.

Have A #%!&amp;$@$! Day
IT'S rude out there.
Rude all over the place.
In the country that invented "Have a Nice Day," citizens now wear sweatshirts that scream "Back Off," or worse.
On the football field and on the basketball court, the old ideal of sportsmanlike conduct has degenerated into a fiesta of trash talk and aggressive taunting.
Since the 1940's, the Salvation Army has put out drop-off bins so that kindhearted citizens could donate old clothes and furniture.
Last month, it announced that it would retire the bins in eight Midwestern states because people were using them as Dumpsters.

Workers Turn to Retraining as Military Cuts Jobs
Ever since he graduated from high school, Kevin M. McGowan has been welding huge steel plates on the hulls and decks of warships at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

But what can Mr.
McGowan do now that his highly technical skills are of little value because so few ships are built in this country?


A Culinary Victory at a World Equestrian Championship
WHILE Austria's equestrian team was outpointing competitors from 23 nations in the World Pair Driving Championship at the Hamilton Farm here, a winning performance by a 250-member culinary team from a hotel in Convent Station was going on behind the scenes.
Led by the unflappable Wolfgang Weichert, the executive chef of the Madison Hotel, the off-premises catering staff served thousands of meals during the five-day event, which was being held in this country for the first time.
The meals ranged from simple Continental breakfasts to elegant feasts attended by Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.


When a Big Brother's Reputation Helps
PICCOLO SOUTH has taken Atlantic Beach by storm.
At 10 P.M. on a recent Saturday diners were stacked three deep in the bar waiting for tables.
One weary woman asked, "Is this the only restaurant in town?" Just about.
In addition to its scant competition, the new Italian restaurant is benefiting from the reputation of its big brother, Piccolo of Huntington, a six-year veteran with a loyal following.

THE WORLD: Somalia Interlude; A Prisoner's Release, A Moment's Peace
A FREED American helicopter pilot, held captive by a Somali militia since a big firefight two weeks ago, arrived home in the United States yesterday as thousands of fresh American troops moved into place in Mogadishu.
Their mission, however, is not yet clear.
The release of Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant by the forces of Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid was a sign that tensions were easing.
His ordeal ended after a visit to Somalia by President Clinton's new envoy, Robert B. Oakley, who negotiated with General Aidid's associates but not directly with the fugitive general.


An Artist Who Spoke For the People
Perhaps more than anyone, Agnes de Mille, who died on Oct. 7 at the age of 88, made ballet a household word in America: she was the art form's chief populist and popularizer.
Anyone acquainted with the personal heritage she described so vividly in her many autobiographical books would realize how naturally she expressed these traits in her life and work.
The democratic streak that ran admirably through de Mille's ballets -- from "Rodeo," the masterpiece she created in 1942, to "The Informer" of 1988 -- came down from the principles of her maternal grandfather, the economist and social reformer Henry George.

Janet Wickenhaver and Tom Allon
FOUR years ago, Janet Wickenhaver was working as a freelance crime reporter and living alone in a railroad flat in Hoboken, N.J.
She jokingly called her apartment "the penthouse exercise suite" because you had to climb four flights of stairs to get to it.
When she wasn't covering murders or drug busts, her night life consisted mainly of playing poker with a close-knit group of other female journalists.
"I was militantly pursuing my singlehood," Ms.
Wickenhaver said.
"But it was beginning to crack."


The View From: Yale School of Music; A Season of Concerts Celebrates 100 Years of Musical Life
ONLY real pros could have pulled it off.
During the recent Norfolk Chamber Music Festival, held in conjunction with the Yale Summer School of Music, the cellist of the Cleveland String Quartet was led on stage by Joan Panetti and shakily announced to the audience that he was too ill to continue the concert and was leaving immediately for the hospital.
Professor Panetti, who is director of the festival and the summer school, did not let the audience down.
She pulled Yale School of Music faculty members out of their seats in the music shed, culled music scores and within minutes had put together a new program that incorporated faculty, the remaining members of the Cleveland String Quartet, current students and even an alumnus.


Clinton's Remarks on Race Upheld King Legacy; Dealing the Other Way
To the Editor:
President Clinton's claim that "too many of us are still too unwilling to vote for people who are different than we are" is more revealing than the President or Paul Goldman ought to be comfortable with: How many black people voted against New York's Mayor David N. Dinkins ("The Race Card," Op-Ed, Oct. 6)?
If we compare that figure with the percentage of white people who voted for him, Mr.
Clinton's assertion becomes an interesting faux pas.


Woe Is Not Me
WEARY NEWS clerks humming "Ol' Man River" have been hauling into my office great bales of mail containing reader protests about a piece in this space on predicate nominatives.
Most people manage to get through life without bothering their heads about the predicate nominative, which is the noun or pronoun embedded in a sentence's action section after a linking verb, like mail-puller in "You are a mail-puller." But there is a breed of language lover that clasps this grammatical category to its bosom, and insists with purist fervor on the nominative "I am he" rather than the sloppily objective "I am him," which is the choice of easygoing Norma Loquendi and me.


Oct. 10-16: 'Her or Us'; A Juror Is Removed In L.A.'s Riot Trial
The trial of two men accused of beating a truck driver during last year's riots in Los Angeles took a turn last week that surprised legal scholars and offered a glimpse into the role that personality can play in the privacy of a jury room.
In the midst of deliberations, the forewoman told the judge that she and 10 other jurors found it impossible to work with the 12th.
"It's her or us," the forewoman told Judge John Ouderkirk of Superior Court.

After 20 Years, America's Foot Is Still On the Gas
TWENTY years after the Arab oil embargo, after the gas lines, after the fist fights, after the nation's promise to itself to do better, some things have changed.
Mostly they've gotten worse.
The United States today uses almost as much oil as it did then, but imports 44.6 percent of it, up from 37.2 percent in 1973.
At the time of the embargo, 5.3 percent of the oil used here came from Arab members of Opec; now it is 11.6 percent.
Then our largest supplier was Venezuela, which is geographically and culturally close to the United States; now it is Saudi Arabia, which is neither.

Who Are You Calling a Drunk?
To the Editor:
To this 20-year resident of Corofin, in County Clare, Ireland, Peter Finn's review of Rosemary Maho ney's "Whoredom in Kimmage" (Aug. 29) ignores the obvious.
This book is an ethnic and sexist assault on our highly respected village and its decent people.
Her "research," limited largely to just one pub and one family, extrapolates venomously to a community composed predominantly of superstitious, obscene and unemployed drunkards with repellent physical features, seedy clothing and illegitimate babies.
She conveys an image of rural Ireland that is grossly inaccurate.


Tech Notes; Computerizing the Clunker
COMPUTERS work well in new cars to reduce air pollution, but what can be done with old ones, especially in third world countries where old models predominate?
In those lands, where often the only gasoline is leaded, catalytic converters are not practical.
A start-up company in Maryland won a patent last week for a device that cleans car exhaust and reduces fuel consumption by harnessing a computerized sensor to an old-fashioned carburetor.
The system can continually adjust the air-fuel mixture, making it as lean as possible at any given instant without hindering the engine's performance.
It can also work with fuel-injected cars.


The Numbers Prove That Ward Is Healthy
It was a well-kept secret this week that Charlie Ward, Florida State's Heisman-candidate quarterback, did no passing in practice, the result of a mild case of tendinitis.
So much for any concerns the Seminoles may have had about Ward's sharpness today against Virginia.
Ward produced 322 passing yards and 3 touchdowns and even ran for a score in Florida State's rollicking 40-14 victory before 76,607 at Doak Campbell Stadium.

Mr. Sill died of complications of a lung infection, said his son, Peter.


'20 Bucks,' A Film 58 Years Aborning
The movie "20 Bucks" is unusual not just because of its premise -- the plot follows a $20 bill as it passes through the hands of wildly disparate individuals -- but because the film has been nearly 60 years in the making.
The original screenplay was written in 1935 by a producer named Endre Bohem (pronounced BO-heem), but when it did not sell he put it on the shelf.
Not until 1981 did he dust it off and show it to his son, Les, a full-time musician and part-time screenwriter whose credits include "A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child."

THE BUFFALO RETURNS, AS DINNER
Buffalo may be a good source of protein and iron, but you don't have to kill to obtain these nutrients: a dish of beans, a whole-grain roll and a green salad will give you the same protein and iron as a piece of buffalo meat does, but without the saturated fat or cholesterol, without salmonella or E. coli and without the cruelty inherent in animal "farming."


South Street Seaport: Just Another Mall?
CAPTAIN HOOK'S has a smidgen of everything: a ship in a bottle goes for $9.99.
Some wooden ship models fetch in excess of $2,000.
A fish scale marketed as a nail file is one way to spend 59 cents.
Resembling nothing so much as a dusty, cluttered attic, this old-salt emporium in South Street Seaport is fighting for its life.
Captain Hook's monthly rent has been increased from $2,000 to $19,780.62, and its owner, a lifelong maritime hobbyist turned mall merchant named Joe Hill, is hopping mad, fuming that he can't pay nearly that much.
Moreover, he insists that he shouldn't.
He is suing the Rouse Company, developer of South Street Seaport Marketplace, claiming that his eviction would violate Rouse's promise to maintain a maritime flavor.

Reflecting Pools
LAST Tuesday, at the new Asphalt Green Aquacenter on East 90th Street, Esther Williams emerged from a sea-blue limousine in an electric-blue pants suit and sequin vest.
"I was at Barneys today," she said as she was escorted to the Olympic-size pool at the nonprofit sports complex.
"And I saw seven floors of nothing but black. I like a little color."
Miss Williams, 70, is a Beverly Hills-style Auntie Mame, a come-on-in-the-water's-fine kind of person, who has sparkling green eyes clear enough to swim in.

The N.E.A. came through for us when assistance and recognition were sorely needed.

Corrections
Because of an editing error, a question in the Wall Street column last Sunday, about mutual fund regulation, referred incorrectly to the status of wrap accounts, in which large investors pay a percentage fee for money management.
Barry P. Barbash, the new director of the Division of Investment Management of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said such accounts are not regulated as heavily as mutual funds.

A la Carte; It's Time Once Again for Those Mouth-Watering Oktoberfests
THIS is the season of spatzel, schnitzel, sauerkraut, special beers, accordion music and merriment at the handful of German restaurants on Long Island.
It is Oktoberfest time, and at the Smithtown Haus, the Pine Grove Inn in Patchogue, Koenig's in Floral Park and a half-dozen or so other German enclaves, once-a-year dishes and beer are again available.


My Dog, My Self
Andrea Grill gets reminded often enough that there are less maddening places to raise Curry (and Midnight before her) than a sparse 15th-floor apartment in Murray Hill.
Dizzy with a raging fever and flu, she had to go walk her.
When she fractured her pelvis last fall, she had to hire a walker at $5 a walk twice a day.
The walker did not do nights, so she had to pay another service $15 for a night walk.
The Fourth of July fireworks mean a trip to the vet for tranquilizers.
When it snows, the salt sprinkled on sidewalks burns the paws, and so she has to swaddle Curry's feet in plastic bags.
Don't ask about the elevator operator's strike.
Midnight had worms every summer for thee years and had to visit the vet every few weeks.
Curry has worms right now.
"Yes, it would really be nice if we all lived on farms with trees," said Ms.
Grill, an advertising copywriter.
"But some of us have to live in crummy studio apartments with no view. I really love her, and I couldn't live without her. For me, not having a dog is like not having a refrigerator."


Bassett Hall in Virginia Reopens
Bassett Hall, the 18th-century house that once belonged to the Rockefeller family, reopened this month in Williamsburg, Va., after being closed since January 1992 for renovations.
The project added a new reception area and a theater, where a videotaped presentation on the house is shown.
Set in 585 acres of woodlands, the house was bought in the late 1920's by the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr., who financed the restoration of the old Colonial capital, Williamsburg, and his wife, Abby Aldrich.
After moving into Bassett Hall in 1936, the Rockefellers furnished the house with an eclectic collection of Asian, American and English antiques.
Mrs.
Rockefeller collected American folk art, including weather vanes, chalkware and pottery, which can be seen both at Bassett Hall and the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center in Williamsburg.
Visitors, guided by portable audio tape players, can tour the house and the grounds, where they will see the Rockefellers' tea house, their gardens and a 300-year-old giant oak.


Princeton Defense Holds Its Own, and Lehigh as Well
Keith Elias ran for more than 100 yards for the 10th consecutive game today, but the defense turned in the most important heroics as Princeton beat Lehigh, 31-23, to remain undefeated.
The Tiger defensive unit, ranked fourth nationally in Division I-AA, stopped Lehigh at the 25, 7 and 10 in the first half, twice on fourth-and-1 and once on a fumble.
That may well have made the difference as Lehigh (4-2) rallied from a 17-0 deficit to pull within 17-14 early in the fourth quarter.
The rally was led by the Engineers' outstanding quarterback, Scott Semptimphelter, who connected on 25 of 45 passes for 403 yards and 3 touchdowns.
The passing yardage was the most Princeton has given up in its 124-year football history.

THE BAND PREENED ON
Yes, it is discouraging that much of the power of Randy Shilts's book was diluted by Hollywood's usual underestimation of what the American public will tolerate.
But the real power of the movie was its validation (however late) for people like me.
There is a community of survivors within this epidemic.
Before the age of the red ribbon, there was a small but active army of people caring for those we knew and loved, as well as volunteering to care for those we had never met before.
For years, it seemed as if AIDS was something that existed only in our world.

He's an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The Yuppies Come Out To Paint Up And Fix Up
John Kelly spends most of his time in a Manhattan skyscraper, dressed in a suit, his ear fused to a phone, his eyes fixed on computer screens as he tracks fixed-income bonds from Chile and stocks in Taiwan for Citibank.
Yesterday, he wore an oversized red sweatshirt and old jeans to give a school fence in Brooklyn its first coat of paint in 30 years.
"I volunteered to come here today because I think if enough people try to make a small difference, together we can make a big difference," he said.
Then he paused, and, watching a big glob of paint slide off the fence and onto the sidewalk, remarked, "Of course, it's really the thought that counts."


Teaching Teachers To Inspire Students
For the first time in 27 years, Kay Toliver did not introduce herself to a new class of youngsters when school started last month.
Ms.

Qatar Makes a Move To Be a 'Sports Capital'
Qatar has free medical care, free education and free electricity.
It has minarets, plenty of oil and an enormous natural gas field to the north that should guarantee its affluence well into the next century.

Winning Ways With Winter Squash
THE farm stands and markets are now overflowing with brightly colored winter squashes.
Summer squashes, mostly thin-skinned yellow ones or types of zucchini in green or gold, are more delicate than the sturdy, thick-skinned winter varieties.
Fall's crop ranges in color from nearly white to yellow, orange, green and even, in the case of some Hubbard varieties, battleship gray and blue.
They come striped and solid.
Some are round, some elongated and some are deeply ridged.
There are squashes with smooth skins and others that are warty.
They may be perfectly symmetrical or lopsided.

The Anxieties of Childbirth in 'Da Da'
"YOU'RE still not sure, are you?" Karen asks David as he times her contractions in the delivery room while maneuvering ice cubes and sourballs, the familiar aids for fumbling fathers-to-be who were trained in the Lamaze method of natural childbirth.
Now, a playwright can structure a play any way he wants as long as the play works.
When the play does not work, as "Da Da" at the American Stage Company does not, one tends to disbelieve its premise and question its raison d'etre.


PACT CALLED KEY TO LOWER IMPORTS
President Clinton, in his most vigorous promotion of the North American Free Trade Agreement since the formal signing of labor and environmental safeguards in mid-September, warned today that failure to ratify the deal could isolate the United States and flood it with imported goods.
"Without Nafta, one of our best markets, Mexico, could turn to Japan and Europe to make a sweetheart deal for trade," the President said in his weekly radio address.
"Without Nafta, Mexico could well become an export platform, allowing more products from Japan and Europe into America. Why would we want that to happen?"


D. L. DePasquale, Dana T. Milbank
Donna Lynn DePasquale, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Anthony J. DePasquale of North Haven, Conn., was married yesterday to Dana Timothy Milbank, a son of Ann C. Milbank of Merrick, L.I., and Mark A. Milbank of Greenwich, Conn.
The Rev.
David Baranowski, a Roman Catholic priest, and Rabbi Steven Mason performed the ceremony at the Battell Chapel in New Haven.
Mrs.
Milbank and her husband, both 25, graduated cum laude from Yale University.
She was until recently a marketing manager with Citibank in New York and is to become a product manager with the bank's London office later this month.
Her father is a model maker at O. F. Mossberg &amp; Sons, a gun manufacturer in North Haven.


Habitats/S.R.O.; New Deal for Old Hotel
THERE is the unmistakable bustle of a construction site as carpenters coated with plaster dust hop over electrical cables running along the floor in the lobby of the Narragansett, a single-room-occupancy hotel at 93d Street and Broadway in Manhattan.
Within a few months, the lobby, with its austere glass-partitioned front desk, will become much more elegant, with a concierge's desk in the corner inside the front door.
Burgundy carpet salvaged from the Russian Tea Room will be used to redecorate the rooms.
Kitchens are being installed on each of the 11 upper floors.


A Man Who Lives in Two Glass Houses
Glass, the early German modernists believed, would launch a cultural revolution.
Glass walls would not only change the look of buildings.
They would transform the lives of those who lived inside them.
Stripped of the opaque, protective cover afforded by old-fashioned masonry buildings, civilization would advance toward a light-filled realm of freedom and candor.
Philip Johnson lives in two glass houses.
One is the landmark residence in New Canaan, Conn., he designed for himself in 1949.
The other is the fishbowl of fame that he has inhabited most of his life.
And in Johnson's case, at least, it turns out that the early modernists may have had a point.
Even those who detest Johnson and his architecture will grant his disarming candor.
Always quicker than his critics to concede his faults, Johnson long ago perfected the art of self-deprecation as a shield against attacks by others.
When an architect routinely belittles his own work, calls himself a whore and makes no secret of the fascist sympathies that overtook him in the 1930's, where's the fun in trying to take him down a peg or two?


Bibb Bailey, Shawn Coyne
Bibb Bailey, the daughter of Peyton Budinger of Provincetown, Mass., and Lynn G. Bailey of La Canada, Calif., was married yesterday to Shawn Coyne, a son of Mary Jo and Patrick Coyne of Pittsburgh.
The Rev.
James R. Covington, a Unitarian minister, performed the nondenominational ceremony in the Conservatory Garden in Central Park.
The bride, an actress in New York, graduated from New York University.
Her mother is a journalist, textbook author and former editor at Bride's and Glamour magazines in New York.
The bride's father, who retired as a senior executive and director at the New York investment bank of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, now teaches at La Canada High School.


Late at Night, The 'Watchers' Patrol Streets
At 10:30 on a crisp fall night Chaim Deutch slid behind the wheel of his run-down brown Cutlass to begin patrolling the residential streets of Flatbush.
He usually drives alone, but on this night he had a partner, Nathan Szpilzinger.
The two are the leaders of a growing civilian patrol in Flatbush.
Three years old, with 500 volunteers, mostly Orthodox Jews, the group five months ago added a team of about 20 people who patrol the streets alone in cars, on a rotating basis, until 4 or 5 A.M.
There are as many as six cars on the streets almost every night, five marked with white reflective signs and flashing yellow lights, one unmarked.


Teresa Muench, H. E. Russell
Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Muench of Carefree, Ariz., have announced the engagement of their daughter Teresa Louis Muench to H. Edward Russell, a son of Harris E. Russell and Stephanie S. DeForest, both of Southport, Conn.
A December wedding is planned.
Miss Muench is an account supervisor at Lintas Worldwide, the advertising agency in New York.
She graduated from the University of Hartford.
Her father, now retired, was an engineering manager with Saudi Aramco, the oil company in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.


How the Foliage Drama of Fall Unfolds
THIS is the time of year when practically everyone drives along a favorite route to see the foliage colors.
Local residents, who have to endure the traffic jams, refer to them as the leafers.
Quite often friends gather in car pools and meet at a designated location.
Then they leave their cars to hike through the woods, eager to reach that special place where they know the view of the fall foliage will be fantastic.
Each enjoys this seasonal phenomenon in his or her own way, but rare is the individual who does not respond to this natural autumn beauty.


When We Build It, Will They Come?
OVER the last decade, a little-known company called C.U.C.
International has built a big business in "shopping clubs" that give members information and discounts on everything from new cars to Caribbean cruises.
It has done this mostly the old-fashioned way -- using direct mail and toll-free "800" telephone numbers.
But now, the Stamford, Conn., company is moving onto the electronic superhighway.
Teaming up with Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc., C.U.C. is about to offer interactive-video shopping services.


Arnold. Sly. Kevin. Jeff?: THE RELUCTANT STAR
Amid the charred rubble that litters Copley Square in Boston, Jeff Bridges scrambles to his feet.
Playing a bomb-squad officer who has been knocked flat by an explosion, he is rehearsing a scene in which he rises up, horrified, to survey the damage.
As he figures out how he will move during the sequence, he also worries about the other matters that usually concern actors: how he will look and how he will sound.
His makeup man holds a mirror, and Bridges periodically gives himself an appraising stare.
What interests him about his reflection is dirt.
He studies the soot on his face with the utmost interest.
Earlier, while the makeup was being applied, Bridges feigned the exact grimace he would use on camera, cowering at the sight of an imaginary fireball.
When he relaxes his face now, it is lined with white streaks, places where the grime didn't go.
The effect is hardly flattering, but is authentic, so it passes muster.

THE BAND PREENED ON
I watched "Band" with a friend who had never been associated on a personal level with anyone who was gay, let alone understood the anguish of watching a vital human being deteriorate with AIDS.
At the end of the movie, she turned to me in tears and said, "I never knew." The conversation that followed was a kaleidoscope of fear, anger and futility, but, most of all, compassion and understanding.
My hope is that the discussion I shared with my friend took place in homes all over the country.
That was the point of the film.

Oct. 10-16: Talking Peace; Israel and the P.L.O. Pass Another Milestone On a Tortuous Road
The meter was running last week for Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Their Sept. 13 agreement in principle to create Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip went into effect Wednesday, and with that came the start of complex talks on how Israel will carry out a troop withdrawal to begin by Dec. 13 in Gaza and Jericho.
Handshakes on the White House lawn may be fine, but success or failure now lies in nailing down thousands of details.
How big is the Jericho district?
Will Israeli soldiers patrol surrounding roads?
Will Palestinian police officers work with the Israeli Army against terrorists?


Driving Out Prostitution, With a Law to Seize Cars
On a back street in Connecticut's largest city, potential customers are gazing out the windows of their cars, trying to decide whether to make a deal for sex with the women standing provocatively on opposite corners.
It doesn't take long for the driver of a long, silver vehicle to offer one woman $10 for sex.
But within seconds, vice unit police officers, sitting in unmarked cars a short distance away, descend on the scene to arrest the man and confiscate his car.

He was President Aristide.


Hunt for Volunteers Grows Harder in a Changing World
EVELYN M. STOCK has been volunteering for more than 25 years, but things have got out of hand.
Now the Scarsdale resident serves as president of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, chairwoman of the county's Women's Advisory Committee and chairwoman of the Committee on Fair Campaign Practices.
She is also on the Board of Cooperative Educational Services of Southern Westchester and serves as first vice president of development for the New York State League of Women Voters.
"No one would have expected this of anybody 20 years ago," Mrs.
Stock said.
"Normally, you could do any one of these jobs and consider yourself very busy. I'm doing lots and lots of things that in other times would have been covered by five or six people. But the pool of people available to do volunteer work -- especially to take on big jobs -- has shrunk. There are days I feel like a dinosaur." A Decline in Active Membership
In fact, Mrs.
Stock represents an increasingly rare breed: the full-time female volunteer.
And volunteer organizations ranging from Junior Leagues to hospital auxiliaries are struggling to adapt themselves to the changing profile of their membership: working women who may not be willing or able to give large amounts of time to volunteering.

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Sunday Driving
TO take a spin in Barry Bienstock's car, you have to share the front seat with a fire extinguisher.
And buckling up for safety means being strapped into a harness with so many clasps that it is as if you are in a fighter jet.
But then for those who drive four-cylinder cars, Mr.
Bienstock's Ferrari is like a jet.
In seconds it was going more than 100 miles an hour.


Municipalities Are Pushing a 90-Mile Trail
WITH some of the year's best hiking weather occurring now, and cross-country-skiing time approaching, the county has announced its latest effort to link pieces of a continuous recreational trail system in Westchester, which when completed will begin in Yonkers and continue to the Putnam County line.
The newest link, the fifth phase of the North County Trailway, will be more than three miles long and will go from Route 134 near the Kitchawan Preserve in Yorktown to Railroad Station Park in Yorktown Heights.
It is being paid for with $2.2 million in Federal and state money and is scheduled to open to hikers by August 1995, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said.


THE WORLD: Roll Over, Ho Chi Minh; Vietnam Moves From Clenched Fists to Greased Palms
FOR an increasingly corrupt city, Hanoi retains an innocent charm.
A request to meet with a government functionary in virtually any other capital in Southeast Asia -- from Bangkok to Jakarta to Phnom Penh -- commonly produces a fellow who, on a pittance of a government salary, somehow manages to drive a Mercedes and to vacation in the south of France.
In the streets of the Vietnamese capital, there are almost no fancy cars.
And when Government officials agree to be interviewed they often as not arrive for the meeting out of breath, having pedaled a rickety bicycle across town.


Eine Kleine Kopfmusik
No one doubts that music hath charms, and now scientists at U.C.L.A. have found evidence of it: indications that at least some music can make a listener temporarily smarter.
In a report published last week by the British scientific journal Nature, a group headed by Dr.
Frances H. Rauscher, a psychologist, described tests administered to 36 volunteer students that suggested this provocative (and probably controversial) conclusion.
A nonverbal I.Q. test was given immediately after three listening sessions: ten minutes of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major (K. 448), ten minutes of a "relaxation tape" with a soothing male voice, and ten minutes of silence.


POSTINGS: Interest Drops to 5.9%; Sonyma Raises Income Limits

They are also are higher for people purchasing homes in what are called target areas, neighborhoods targeted for economic development, than they are elsewhere.

One Man's Meat
To the Editor:
"N.Y.P.D. Blue"  [ "A Splash of Red for 'N.Y.P.D. Blue,' " Sept. 19 ]  is one of the most offensive television programs I have ever watched.
But the offense it causes me stems only in part from its nudity and language.
Rather, it is the misogynistic, woman-bashing attitude that permeated the show that disturbed me profoundly.
This show offers the implicit message that women are untrustworthy, that they are good for only one thing (sex), that true love and trust can exist only between two stalwart, brave men, and that sexual intimacy with women leads to the downfall of courageous men.

How the Foliage Drama of Fall Unfolds
THIS is the time of year when practically everyone drives along a favorite route to see the foliage colors.
Local residents, who have to endure the traffic jams, refer to them as the leafers.
Quite often friends gather in car pools and meet at a designated location.
Then they leave their cars to hike through the woods, eager to reach that special place where they know the view of the fall foliage will be fantastic.
Each enjoys this seasonal phenomenon in his or her own way, but rare is the individual who does not respond to this natural autumn beauty.


Going Gentle Toward 2000
The European collections have answered fashion's unspoken question, Where do we go from spare?
On a blank background, designers are beginning to scribble the silhouette of the end of the century: fragile shoulders; long, fluid lines; graceful drapes; airy fabrics; a wash of dusty pastel colors.
It is more like a sketch than a final image -- a misty Polaroid on its way to definition.
Something had to change.
Minimalism, that powerful process of cleansing and purifying fashion's excess, just had no place to go.
In the hands of the avant-garde it had turned negative, nihilistic and sour.
And even if one needs a hangover cure for an overstuffed wardrobe, there has to be more to dressing than a rack of black pants suits and plain white T-shirts.
As Mies van der Rohe would not have put it: less is a bore.


Jacob Mishler, Old-Fashioned Judge 'Who Understands Real Life'
PEOPLE tell him that he resembles George Burns. But he says he thinks he looks better.
At 82, Judge Jacob J. Mishler of Federal District Court is as sharp as judges half his age, and he says he has no plans to step down from the bench soon.
"I suppose some lawyers feel a judge shouldn't sit on the bench after age 76," he said.
"But I haven't heard any complaints. I think Justice Holmes was in his 90's when he stepped down, and no one thought he lacked a judicial mind or judicial capacity."

Southern California Approves 'Smog Market' Plan
In the most ambitious effort yet to use free-market forces to clean up urban smog, regulators here have approved a long-awaited plan to allow companies to buy and sell the rights to pollute in the same way baseball cards and pork bellies are traded.
The new regulatory approach, approved on Friday by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, establishes pollution allowances for 390 of the region's largest polluters, which each emit more than four tons a year of either nitrogen oxides or sulfur oxides, the two main ingredients of Southern California's brown haze.


Business Diary: October 10 - 15
COMPANIES On the Fabled Data Highway, One Paving Crew Is All Set  This is big.
This, like it or not, is the "information superhighway" about to be made real.
When Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications announced their merger -- a tangled affair, as you can see -- superlatives abounded.
At $33 billion, it may (depending on the math) be the biggest merger ever, bigger even than the mythic RJR Nabisco deal.
And to hear John Malone of T.C.I. tell it, this grand-scale marriage of cable and telephone wizardry will change people's lives, making possible a single device "to control all the communications needs of a household," from making a phone call to renting a movie to getting the news.
But let's not take off for the future just yet; not everyone's aboard.
A "mega-monster" that will be costly to consumers, Senator Howard Metzenbaum said of the deal.
"A regulatory nightmare," one analyst said.
Just one hurdle: Baby Bells are barred from going into long distance, and the deal would poise Bell Atlantic to do just that.
So don't hold your breath.


Video Refinements Come at a Price
Ever since the economic clouds settled in, a paradoxical pattern of consumer spending has been emerging.
Sales of Jaguar cars have more than doubled.
And in video luxury items sell briskly while economy models languish.
Whatever conclusions can be drawn from this, the point is not lost on the video industry, which lately has concentrated on clever but often costly refinements.
Symptomatic of this trend is the growing number of camcorders equipped with viewfinders that show the image in color.Their utility is questionable.
After all, it is just as easy and much cheaper to compose a picture in black and white in the viewfinder as long as the result shows up in color on the tape.


In America; Murder Redux
I will never forget walking into the courtyard of the school where the voting was to have taken place and seeing the freshly murdered bodies strewn about, and hearing the moans, the last few minutes of suffering, of those who had not quite died but soon would.
That was in November 1987, at the Ecole Nationale Argentine Bellegarde in Port-au-Prince.
I was with about a dozen reporters and photographers covering one of Haiti's periodic attempts at democracy.
We had planned to interview some of the desperately poor Haitians who were thrilled to be lining up early on a Sunday morning, dressed in their finest, for the right to vote in a real election.

Edible Souvenirs
To the Editor: We read with delight Susan Allen Toth's "On English Supermarket Shelves, Edible Souvenirs" (Aug. 22).
Our own travels have led us to these observations about English comestibles as souvenirs.
Terry's Tap and Unwrap Chocolate Oranges (milk or dark chocolate) are not only easily packed, but also easily procured, available at almost any corner store or train station.
Prices are lower outside of London.
Another favorite, and winner of the dry humor in marketing award, is McVitie's Rich Tea Biscuits, the wrapper of which contends, "A drink's too wet without one."


New Jordan Rules
To the Sports Editor:
Robert Lipsyte appears to miss the greater symbolism of Michael Jordan's retirement.
First, he focuses obsessively on Jordan's little "you guys" slight toward reporters.
Then in "Jordan's Retirement Puts the Reality in Our Court," (The Times, Oct. 10), Lipsyte makes a largely irrelevant comparison between athletes and other media icons.
The enormity of Michael Jordan's retirement, and its meaning for most of the rest of us, lies in the fact that a 30-year-old man can declare his career goals accomplished and move on to a life of golf tournaments and business ventures.
Meanwhile, the rest of us struggle to keep our jobs, pay our bills and, if we are lucky, derive a sense of accomplishment from our work.
In comparison to Michael, our achievements, and ourselves, seem small, yet he is able to leave his glory behind him.


Forever Harley
"VROOM, vroom," said Jed Srybnik, sneering dismissively from a perch atop the leather seat of his customized cobalt blue Harley-Davidson Softail motorcycle.
"Look at those bad boys on their bikes."
Just a moment before, Mr.
Srybnik had been gauging the effect his motorcycling had on the opposite sex: "What the women see in you is the danger," he said.
But then a tooth-rattling roar split the air like a thunderclap on what was an otherwise sunny Saturday afternoon.
Past where Mr.
Srybnik sat -- in a line of bikes parked in front of the restaurant I Tre Merli on West Broadway, just below Houston Street -- two leather-clad bikers cruised by on their Harleys, looking as if they had come to SoHo to pillage, not brunch.
As they passed, forks froze in transit at the restaurant's sidewalk tables.
On the crowded streets, strollers stood still and gawked.


In the Region/Westchester; North Tarrytown Acts to Preserve Its Waterfront
EVER since General Motors announced in February 1992 that it would close its minivan-assembly plant in North Tarrytown in 1995, the village has been working furiously to gain some measure of control over the industrial site so that it might redefine its waterfront.
The sprawling plant has dominated the village's waterfront for 75 years, occupying 98 acres along the Hudson River.
Aside from the loss of jobs and tax revenue represented by the plant's closing, the village is even more concerned about what will happen to the site once the industrial giant leaves.

Oct. 10-16: Selling Weaponry; Israel's Trade With China Draws American Fire
However much Israel's diplomacy with its Arab neighbors has drawn praise in Washington, American officials are decidedly unenthusiastic about Israel's continuing trade in armaments with China.
A blunt assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency, made public by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last week, says: "Building on a long history of close defense industrial relations, China and Israel appear to be moving toward formalizing and broadening their military technical cooperation."
While Israel sees economic and perhaps political benefits in helping China arm itself, American officials worry that it is helping Beijing develop better weapons like missiles for export.
Just this month, China angered the United States by resuming nuclear testing.

Who's Doing The Bashing?

IN SHORT: FICTION
THE SHARK-INFESTED CUSTARD By Charles Willeford. Underwood-Miller, $20.95.


Toronto
Walt Whitman, visiting Toronto in 1880, called the city "a lively, dashing place." In 1993, it is infinitely more so, pulsing with theaters, jazz and comedy clubs, restaurants and flea markets.
Unesco recently counted more than 100 languages and dialects spoken here.
One-third of the city's residents identify a language other than English or French as their mother tongue.
Chinese, Greeks, Portuguese, Ukrainians, Russians, Koreans, Indians and West Indians all have their own neighborhoods.
In fact, there are three Chinatowns, reflecting different periods of immigration, starting with last century's railroad builders.


Casting One's Fate to the (High) Winds
IT'S difficult to explain, but everyone has probably experienced it at least once.
You -- a person who crosses at the green, washes fruit before eating it and wears sunscreen daily -- find yourself saying something like "Why not? We're on vacation." The next thing you know, you're standing in line waiting to drop 50 feet with a bungee cord wrapped around your ankle, or you've ordered a local dish made from some poisonous fish that can be prepared only by 1 of 12 specially licensed chefs.
The more exotic or strange the locale, the more likely you are to step off the edge of practicality and common sense.
I suppose part of it is the sense of immortality that comes from being in a strange place, the belief that the standard rules of real life don't apply.
You won't die, get sick or get injured because, after all, you are on vacation.


On TV, Mayoral Campaign Is Barely Skin Deep
If New Yorkers who form their political views from television were required to drop their remote controls and report directly to the polls, they would be hard-pressed right now to evaluate the candidates for Mayor on anything beyond their wardrobes, their diction and their contrasting sparring styles.
For the majority of voters who never shake the candidates' hands or attend hotel banquets in their honor, television coverage provides the primary access to the mayoral campaign.
And reflecting the slugfest that this campaign has become, TV news shows last week presented a whiplash-inducing back-and-forth between the testy candidates.


The Playground of the Future
It looks like a giant Lego maze of red, blue and yellow cubicles.
Arches interlock with tubes, bars with ladders.
In many ways, it is a prototype of the urban playground of the future.
After six years of planning and delay for lack of funds, the $500,000 Asser Levy Playground opened on Thursday in a 1.7-acre park at 23d Street, a block from the East River.
It is the first public playground in Manhattan built specifically with the needs of disabled children in mind.
Another experimental playground, All Children, was constructed in 1985 in Flushing Meadows, Queens, but it requires more maintenance and adult supervision.


Winning Ways With Winter Squash
THE farm stands and markets are now overflowing with brightly colored winter squashes.
Summer squashes, mostly thin-skinned yellow ones or types of zucchini in green or gold, are more delicate than the sturdy, thick-skinned winter varieties.
Fall's crop ranges in color from nearly white to yellow, orange, green and even, in the case of some Hubbard varieties, battleship gray and blue.
They come striped and solid.
Some are round, some elongated and some are deeply ridged.
There are squashes with smooth skins and others that are warty.
They may be perfectly symmetrical or lopsided.


Serbs Resume Shelling of Sarajevo, Increasing Fears
After a lull of several weeks, Serbian nationalist forces resumed their heavy artillery bombardment of Sarajevo today, setting off panic on the city's streets and raising fear that the siege could take a sharp turn for the worse just as winter approaches.
The Serbian forces on the slopes of mountains overlooking the Bosnian capital began their barrage before dawn, hitting the city center with at least 30 152-millimeter tank shells, the most destructive weapon in the their arsenal.
Thousands of tank, artillery and mortar shells were fired next in a bombardment that continued until the late afternoon before relenting.


Tribal Rights: Refining The Law of Recognition
DONALD TRUMP, testifying this month at a congressional hearing on how Indian casinos are policed and regulated, touched a raw nerve when he complained that certain American Indians, who he said, "don't look like Indians to me," enjoyed unfair advantages in the gambling business by virtue of the Federal laws governing tribal autonomy.
The remarks by the Atlantic City titan, whether racially tinged or simply blunt, revisited issues that Indians and non-Indians alike say have been simmering for years and are now attracting more attention, both in Washington and in tribal circles.
What are the limits of tribal rights, and how does a tribe get them?


Magic Waives Catledge
TERRY CATLEDGE was waived by the Orlando Magic on Friday.
Catledge, 30, averaged 19.4 points and 7.6 rebounds in the Magic's first season four years ago, but he saw his role diminish gradually the past three seasons.
He appeared in a career-low 21 games last season, averaging 4.7 points and 2.2 rebounds.
The 6-foot-8-inch forward reportedly still will receive most of the original value of a six-year, $9.6 million contract extension he signed in 1990, under a buyout agreement made Thursday.
The Magic will be granted a $650,000 salary exception slot to replace him on the roster. (AP)


Shoplifting Arrest Leads to Discovery of Children Locked in Attic, Police Say
The two children a 15-year-old girl and her 11-year-old brother -- were caught in a local supermarket last Friday night stuffing bagels, bologna, crackers and candy into book bags and taken, terrified, to the Police Department on shoplifting charges.
"They were frantic, not so much that they were caught shoplifting but that I was going to return them home," Detective Frank C. Jones recalled today.
"They were completely hysterical."
Under gentle questioning over the next hour or so, the two children told Detective Jones a story of living for months in isolation with two other children -- like them, in foster care -- in a cramped and often locked attic room with no furniture, no lights, no heat and little food.
They pried open the bolt lock last Friday with a coat hanger and went out on their food foray because they were hungry, Detective Jones said.
At the time, the couple raising them had gone out for a seafood dinner at a fast-food restaurant in Paramus, the detective said.
"The girl told us more or less they had to go out and steal to get an adequate amount of food," he said.
Two Others in Attic
After the questioning, Detective Jones said he went to the two-story gray house on Howland Avenue and found a 16-year-old girl sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the pitch-black attic room and a 10-year-old boy in diapers asleep on the floor.
Several hours later, the couple, Anthony James, 36, and his wife, Shirley, 39, were arrested on charges of endangering the welfare of the four children.
Subsequently they were released on $10,000 bail each after a hearing in State Superior Court.
The four children have been placed in the care of New Jersey's Division of Youth and Family Services.
They were examined at Englewood Hospital and not found to be suffering from any serious physical ailments, Detective Jones said.
The other two children in the house, a foster daughter, 12, and the Jameses' son, 8, had their own bedrooms, the detective said.
The Englewood Police Department's Youth Bureau has been trying to trace the four children's lives as foster children and learn why the Jameses had them stay in the attic.
Not Attending School
He also said the four children had not attended school for months.
"They were imprisoned, more or less, in the attic," Detective Jones said today.
They were allowed out for meals, which consisted of warm cereal in the morning, no lunch, and peanut butter sandwiches, with water, for dinner, he said.
The youngsters told the detectives that they had to eat the food in the basement, not upstairs with the others.
The two boys also said Mr.
James hit them with belts and wires whenever they were caught taking food from the family refrigerator, the detective said.
Whenever the four had to go to the toilet, they had to knock on the locked door of the attic room to be released, the detective said.
They were required to use the bathroom in the basement, not the one in the regular living quarters.
"They were more or less rationed out toilet tissue," the detective said.
For the most part, he said, the two boys were allowed out of the attic, aside from meals and toilet trips, only when the Jameses' 8-year-old son wanted to play with them outdoors.
No one answered the door today at the James house.
They have no telephone listing.
Link to New York State
A neighbor on Howland Avenue who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the couple, like many on the quiet residential street, kept to themselves.
Occasionally, he said, he saw several children in the yard, cleaning it or sharing in barbecues.
He said he believed Mrs.
James was a Jehovah's Witness and took the children to worship on Sundays at the kingdom hall on Palisades Avenue, about a five-minute walk from their house.
Officials at the kingdom hall said today that they knew the Jameses and were aware of the charges against them.
But they declined to comment further.
Authorities said they believed the five foster children had been placed with the couple by social services officials in New York and that the Jameses received monthly subsidies of $500 for each, or a total annual stipend of $30,000.
Detective Jones said Mr.
James was unemployed.
Authorities, he said, were also investigating whether the couple had formally adopted the five children, possibly in New Jersey.
The Bergen County Prosecutor, John J. Fahy, said his staff was trying to learn why New York agencies paid the monthly maintenance stipends for the five children, but apparently did not monitor their living conditions.


Bassett Hall in Virginia Reopens
Bassett Hall, the 18th-century house that once belonged to the Rockefeller family, reopened this month in Williamsburg, Va., after being closed since January 1992 for renovations.
The project added a new reception area and a theater, where a videotaped presentation on the house is shown.
Set in 585 acres of woodlands, the house was bought in the late 1920's by the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr., who financed the restoration of the old Colonial capital, Williamsburg, and his wife, Abby Aldrich.
After moving into Bassett Hall in 1936, the Rockefellers furnished the house with an eclectic collection of Asian, American and English antiques.
Mrs.
Rockefeller collected American folk art, including weather vanes, chalkware and pottery, which can be seen both at Bassett Hall and the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center in Williamsburg.
Visitors, guided by portable audio tape players, can tour the house and the grounds, where they will see the Rockefellers' tea house, their gardens and a 300-year-old giant oak.


Tarnish on the Casino Glitter

If a chainsaw can make life easier, do not let its potential hazards deter you from buying or renting one.
But learn to use it safely.

Bringing Much-Needed Sand to a Storm-Battered Beach
Over the last year, erosion worsened by storms has devastated much of the Rockaways shoreline.
But with the Army Corps of Engineers expected to approve a $46 million, 10-year restoration plan, repairs may begin early next year.
"It's really a question of the sooner the better," said Joseph Vietri, a planner in the Army Corps of Engineers district office in Manhattan.
"We have about 50,000 people living on an island that has been decimated by a series of storms over the last few years, and this project will in essence give the people a measure of protection against the effect of storm damages."


The Better Partner? Too Close to Call
TAKE two world-famous players and try to decide who is better.
In theory it should be possible to answer the question by assembling deals on which they faced the same problem as declarer, and then tabulating the results.
The problem would be insoluble if the players were regularly partners.
If you wanted, for example, to compare the playing skills of Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell, perhaps the world's best partnership, your collection of deals would be ridiculously small.
The one shown in the diagram might be the only example.


Mutual Funds; Strategies for Style Index Funds
TWO sets of "style" index funds set up last year -- one by Vanguard and the other by Dreyfus -- have made it easier for mutual fund investors to use growth and value stockpicking strategies in building their portfolios, much as mutual fund managers use them in shaping their funds.
These index funds can serve as handy benchmarks for investors, or be used as tools themselves to implement a variety of growth- and value-related investing tactics.
Mutual fund managers using a value approach look for shares priced at less than what they think the company is worth, often in mature, dividend-paying companies with cyclical businesses dependent on the overall economy.
By contrast, those after growth prefer shares in companies with strong earnings or sales prospects; they may be relatively expensive but are less dependent on economic conditions.

Who Will Control the Digital Flow?
THE promised allures of the information highway -- from Hollywood movies to the complete works of the Library of Congress, summoned to any living-room screen with the click of a remote control -- may still be a long time away.
But the announcement last week of the planned merger combining the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc., a big telephone company and a cable television giant, is a sure sign that corporate America is betting that the information highway will become more than just a catchy concept.
It is far too soon to tell whether this particular deal, valued at as much as $33 billion, will prove to be money well spent.
Roger McNamee of Integral Capital Partners, a high-tech investment fund in Menlo Park, Calif., has started an office pool, taking bets on who will be the first to lose a billion dollars in the failed pursuit of what he calls "multimedia mania."


A Thunderbird Creates a Storm At a Garden
In American Indian mythology, the thunderbird is an enormous creature that causes storms.
And one designed by Parks Department workers is doing just that.
A year ago, workers for the Parks Department laid out a small flower garden near Pierrepont Place with daffodils, tulips, hyacinth, cleome, roses and coleus.
And, in what they said was a salute to the American Indian, they embedded in it gray stones in the outline of a thunderbird.

Barbara Ehrenreich's Writing Attracts an Attentive Audience
THOUGH unmistakably a tribute to an author's achievement, critics' sensibility to past work and reputation to the detriment of the new, breakaway work at hand is always unwelcome.
It's enough to make writers fantasize about what their prospects would be if they had written under a pseudonym.
When the Long Island-based writer Barbara Ehrenreich switched gears and published her first novel and work of fiction, "Kipper's Game," last summer, it was almost universally reviewed, but not universally loved, by critics, including two in this newspaper. (Good reviews appeared on the West Coast and in other publications, including Entertainment Weekly.)  Not Examining the Novel
The problem, said a regretful Ms.
Ehrenreich during an interview in her Syosset home, is that the reviewers seemed bent more on addressing her than on examining the novel itself.
Foreseeing the difficulty, perhaps, she had proposed using another name to her editor at Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux but was turned down.

A Cabdriver Is Shot Dead; 2d Is Wounded
The 31st New York City cabdriver to be slain this year was found yesterday slumped at the wheel of his yellow cab with two bullet wounds in the back of the head in a deserted park in Washington Heights.

He was listed in serious but stable condition yesterday at Elmhurst General Hospital.

City Planners Take New Tack On Giant Project: Think Small
It stretches for nearly two miles along the oceanfront, block after block of weed-filled, trash-strewn lots, occasionally interrupted by a cluster of buildings.
It is the Arverne urban-renewal area in the Rockaways, for a quarter-century the site of a repeatedly thwarted effort to build a "new town" of homes, parks and shopping centers.
The Arverne project suffered its latest blow two years ago when the developer of the most recent plan for the site, Oceanview Associates of Manhattan, pulled out, citing a poor economy in which to market the kind of vast development it was contemplating: a $1.5 billion complex of 7,500 apartments priced to sell or rent to families with annual incomes of $45,000 to $80,000.
Stores, movie theaters and a refurbished boardwalk and beach were also part of the package.


THE BEAT GOES ON
Thanks to Don Montague for helping to perpetuate the (male) notion that hormonal changes in women (brought on by pregnancy, menstruation or menopause) reduce them to morons (About Men: "The Beat Goes On," Sept. 26).
Not only does his lame attempt at humor in describing his wife's behavior during pregnancy insult and humiliate her and every other woman, but it also trivializes deafness, dwarfism and stillbirth.
Perhaps, his wife should whap him on the head with a spoon to make sure that his brain is still alive.

Justice? Go Find It
To the Editor:
Why bother investigating police corruption?
The justice system in this city is a joke.
I was mugged on Dec. 7, 1992, by two men: one had a gun, the other a knife.
In February I picked the man with the gun out of a lineup, as did another witness.
Last week in court I again identified the gunman as did the other witness the next day.
He had been convicted twice before for armed robbery and was on parole.
Yesterday an assistant district attorney called to tell me the gunman had been acquitted.
She said she was sorry but these cases were sometimes like flipping a coin.
How can one trust a "justice" system that lets repeat offenders back on the streets?

Wrestling With the Ever-Changing Forces of Modernism
IT reads like stage directions: Nardin Galleries, formerly of Cross River, relocates here, occupying premises that used to house the Somerstown Gallery, now in Croton Falls and called the Schoolhouse Gallery.
Jacques Lipchitz (1891-1973), who lived in Hastings-on-Hudson from 1947 until his death, returns to Westchester by way of the bronzes and drawings currently celebrating the "new" Nardin.
Enter Joseph Stella (1877-1946), who came to the United States from Naples, in 1896, and who is represented by paintings and drawings.
Also present is a living sculptor, Henry Schiowitz who, though home-grown, acquired his skills in Petrasanta, Italy, near Carrara, where Lipchitz and other masters worked for a while.


A Beleaguered Family Breaks Apart
Not only does the first act of "The Fiery Furnace" take place during the 1950's, Timothy Mason's play about the travails of a small-town Wisconsin family could have been written back then.
The coffeepot's on the stove, the oilcloth's on the kitchen table, and all may not be right with the world, but you wouldn't know it from appearances.
The opening production of the Circle Repertory Company's season, "The Fiery Furnace" (Off Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theater) brings instantly to mind the dramas of William Inge, who achieved enormous success during the Eisenhower years chronicling buried yearnings and spiritual death in Midwestern hamlets and, for a while, was considered in a league with Edward Albee and Tennessee Williams.
Inge's plays seem a little parochial to us nowadays, and so, in its early stretches, does Mr.
Mason's.


Honors Classes Cope With Reform
LIZABETH FREEMAN, a social studies teacher at Fox Lane High School here, prepares her daily lessons for two types of classes.
One is a ninth-grade group of honors students, who were recommended to her course for high achievers while they were still in the eighth grade.
The other is a group of 10th graders whose academic abilities are more varied.
Ms.
Freeman, who has taught here for 17 years, says she hates making distinctions between the honors students and those in her mixed groups, because students labeled ordinary often shine with a special light of their own.
Still, she conceded recently, when the school year was still new and the fresh faces before her held untold possibilities, "It's very hard to avoid low expectations of less gifted kids." Labeling Students Losing Favor
Labeling students, or tracking them in set courses of study according to their abilities, is losing favor in the state to heterogeneous groupings more in keeping with Albany's reform plan, a New Compact for Learning.
This is good, said Daniel Berman, coordinator of social studies at Fox Lane and a member of the New York State Curriculum and Assessment Council, an advisory committee appointed by the Board of Regents to help bring about the new plan.


'The Morning After'
To the Editor:
As a rape-crisis volunteer, I appreciated Wendy Kaminer's balanced review of "The Morning After: Sex, Fear, and Feminism on Campus" (Sept. 19).
Katie Roiphe's book may help temper some of feminism's excessive emphasis on women as victims.
Unfortunately, as Ms.
Kaminer points out, it will also be used -- against its author's will -- as a tool by those who minimize the existence of acquaintance rape or even say that the women who are raped by men whom they know "asked for it."

The Last Farewell to Father Panik Village
KATHLEEN VILA was 9 months old in 1943, the year her family moved into the first public housing complex in the state, a sprawling modern community called Yellow Mill Village.
Later renamed after Father Stephen Panik, a priest who had worked for decent housing in the poor neighborhoods of east Bridgeport, the project was trumpeted nationally as a bold sign of social progress designed to abolish poverty and rid the city of crime and disease.
At the ground-breaking ceremony in 1939, Father Panik called the public housing development "the greatest Christmas present Bridgeport has ever received."


Edible Souvenirs
To the Editor: Your article about buying inexpensive gifts in Britain sparked many memories.
In my early years as a traveler, when imagination was in greater supply than cash, I, too, shopped for gifts in supermarkets, food halls and drug stores.
The gifts I bought were cheap, but the wrapping paper I found was free -- city and subway maps of the cities I visited, always available at tourist centers and subway stations.
It was always great fun watching friends unwrap gifts, showing them on the maps where I stayed and traveled and shopped for their presents.
It often triggered their memories and stories as well.

Preview Day Turns Into McGaughey's Day
On New York's most glamorous day of racing, the day of the Breeders' Cup Preview, the colts Dehere and Lure and Miner's Mark won major races and Strategic Maneuver finally lost one.
But the day was dominated by a trainer, Shug McGaughey, a cherubic 42-year-old Kentuckian who made history when he saddled the winners of five stakes races and one allowance race.
In fact, the only thing at Belmont Park that outran any of McGaughey's horses was Dehere, the juvenile star who won the $500,000 Champagne Stakes by four lengths and established himself as the early, but absolute, favorite for next year's Kentucky Derby.
He blitzed a field of five rivals that included McGaughey's colt Personal Escort, who ran fifth.

Of all power tools, chainsaws probably are the most dangerous.
If a chainsaw can make life easier, do not let its potential hazards deter you from buying or renting one.
But learn to use it safely.


In Health Care, Spare Us More Paperwork!
To the Editor:
Regarding "For Coverage, a W-2 Equivalent" (Your Own Account, Oct. 3), my personal conception of hell is a place where one is required to fill out forms all day and night!
As the chief administrator of a small, nonprofit organization, I already spend most of my time filling out forms for various government agencies.
Therefore, I was shocked -- Shocked! -- to find that next year the Government is going to require a new form annually for each of our employees covered by our health plan.
It's to be called an H-2 and is similar to the W-2 now issued to each employee.


A Tinkerer vs. Car Thieves
When Ciro Porricelli was 11 years old, he stole a car and, within an hour, had most of the motor disassembled.
It was his father's 1963 Chevrolet Impala.
"I just wanted to tinker," he confesses.
If there is any validity to the stereotype of the Italian guy from the Bronx who can't wait to get under the hood, Mr.
Porricelli could be typecast.
He grew up on the streets of Williamsbridge, where, for so many teen-agers, souping up a car was what you did after Sunday mass.


Food Reaches Angolan City Where 30,000 Died in Siege
The United Nations flew its first food shipment today to the Angolan city of Cuito, where aid workers say 30,000 people have died in a nine-month siege.
"My colleagues who went to Cuito said thousands of people were starving, without water, without medicine," said Philippe Borel, director of the Angola United Nations World Food Program.


New Loophole For Appeals: Tape Cassette
During the 1991 trial for the murder of Brian Watkins, the Utah tourist whose family was assaulted in a subway station after attending the United States Open tennis tournament, one thing that was never in doubt was the cause of the young man's death.
A medical examiner testified that he died from a stab wound to the chest.
But that testimony may hold the key to a new trial for four men convicted in the Watkins case as well as hundreds of other people convicted of murder or manslaughter in New York State.
Lawyers for the Watkins defendants, using a novel approach in appealing the case, say that during the trial, the prosecution never turned over the medical examiner's original tape recording of the autopsy to the defense.
That lapse, they say, gave the prosecution an unfair advantage.

Commands for Canine Care
You have the dog.
Now you need a little help.
Here are some tips on how to get your dog immunized and how often, what sort of food it should be eating, where it can get a Swedish massage, and more.
FOOD "One of the major nutritional issues with dogs in New York City is comparable to that of people," Dr.
Brodsky said.
"They eat too well and exercise too little. People tend to manifest their love and bond with their dogs by feeding them too much."
He recommends feeding a plump dog smaller servings of standard nutritional food and giving an under-exercised dog a higher-fiber variety.
Most food companies now make "less active" or "light diet" selections.
Eating garbage off the streets is unhealthy and should be discouraged.
If your dog does not respond to scolding, you may want to take it to the vet to make sure it isn't scavenging because of a nutritional deficiency.
LICENSING  Licenses -- and the tags that come with them -- are required for all dogs in New York City, though the A.S.P.C.A. says that only about 140,000 of the city's two million to three million dogs are actually licensed.
The license costs $8.50, as does its yearly renewal, which the owner can get by calling the City Health Department, (212) 566-2456, and asking for an application.
The fine for failing to license is $1,000; Sanitation Department workers are authorized to give summonses, although, truth told, they rarely do.
LEASHNG  New York City law dictates that all dogs must be leashed when outdoors and that owners must clean up after their dogs, in the name of street cleanliness.
There is a $250 fine for violating either the leash law or the poop-scooper law, and any Sanitation, Health Department, Parks and Recreation employee or city police officer is authorized to give a $250 summons for a violation.
But the laws are rarely enforced; about 250 poop-scooper summonses are issued each year.
If you see someone failing to pick up after his or her dog, shame is the best revenge.
SPAYING AND NEUTERING  The A.S.P.C.A. recommends spaying and neutering to keep the number of strays down.
The A.S.P.C.A. will neuter male dogs for $55 and spay females for $65; the fee increases, proportionally, for dogs over 50 pounds.
OBEDIENCE  If an owner expects to keep his shoulders intact, his or her dog must be taught quickly to walk properly, to obey the "heel!" command and to sit at corners, says Bob DeFranco, director of the Canines of America School of Dog Training in Rego Park, Queens.
Mr.
DeFranco also receives a lot of calls from owners whose dogs pick fights with other dogs in the park.
This too should be dealt with quickly in obedience training, at an early age.
"All a dog hears when its owner talks is 'blah, blah, blah,' " he said.
"We have to teach people early on to communicate with their dog so he understands that he is not leader of the pack." SHOTS  Rabies shots are mandatory in New York State; they cost $10 at the A.S.P.C.A. and about $45 at a veterinarian.
Do it two years in a row and you are home free for the next three years.
In addition, puppies should get distemper, hepatitis and parainfluenza shots every four weeks until they are 22 weeks old; older dogs should get yearly boosters.
Kennel cough shots are recommended for dogs that spend a lot of time in kennels.
Dr.
Stuart Brodsky, a veterinarian at the West Side Veterinary Center on West 83d Street, recommends that dog owners who spend weekends in the country consider Lyme disease vaccines.
BARKING  "Dogs bark because of separation anxiety," Mr.
DeFranco said.
"The dog says: 'Oh my God, my owners are gone, I need to chew something, I need to bark.' " To break your dog of this habit before your neighbor down the hall breaks its neck, Mr.
DeFranco suggests rewards when it follows commands.
This helps to build the dog's self-confidence and makes it less anxious when you are away.
Another trick: "Bye-bye bones," a rawhide variety that is hollowed out and filled with food treats that take the dog a long time to dig out.
Or try toys stuffed with socks that smell like the owner.
For chronic barkers that do not benefit from positive reinforcement or treats, there are collars that give off high-frequency sounds that encourage them to stop and collars that give mild electronic shocks.
HOUSEBREAKING  Mr.
DeFranco believes that city dogs need to be trained to urinate or defecate on command -- using a code word (like "park") that is repeated each time the dog goes until it learns the word and does its business on command.
This takes about four to six weeks.
A dog should be walked at least twice a day.
STRAYS  Largely because of the danger of rabies, you should not approach a stray at all.
If you must, keep your hands at your side, do not look it in the eyes, and do not make any sudden movements that will make it feel challenged.
The New York City Emergency Animal Pickup Service, (718) 649-8600, will pick up strays Monday through Friday from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.
After those hours, call the local police precinct if you believe that a dog may be a health hazard.
PAMPERING  The city offers a number of dog day-care centers, a resource introduced five years ago when Joseph Sporn began Yuppie Puppy on West 86th Street.
For $20 a day, a dog gets to romp with a half-dozen other dogs, watch cartoons and splash in a wading pool.
Or, people like Leda Hanson, a pet nanny, will take your dog to the groomer or the vet ($38 per half-hour) or even drive it to a country house for the weekend ($95 round trip).
And then there is the Pet Department Store, where, among other things, your dog can get a Swedish massage.
Why would a dog need a massage?
"Why do people need a massage?" said Leigh Applebrook, the owner of the store, on West 54th Street.
"If the dog has had trauma or an injury, or if it is suffering from tension, maybe fear, the massage really helps." A 30-minute session of Swedish, shiatsu or Tellington touch is $30. (Mrs. Applebrook recommends a series of three sessions.)
For $50, you can leave the dog for a day of fun and beauty.
The dog will have a nanny at its side all day who will play with it, feed it "nutritious food" and bottled water, exercise it on a treadmill, walk it outside every two hours and assist it in "interrelationship socializing." An example of socializing?
"Meeting a kitten for the very first time, under supervision," Mrs.
Applebrook said.
ADOPTION  The A.S.P.C.A. is the major dog-adoption agency in the city.
About 90 percent of all applicants are approved, but the society does interview potential dog-owners on their ability to care for a dog.
The society also tries to make good matches (couch potatoes are paired with Great Danes, for instance; joggers are offered collies or some other strong, active dog; very busy people are steered away from puppies).
The adoption fee is $55, which includes spaying or neutering, vaccinations and one follow-up exam.
Another popular adoption agency is the North Shore Animal League, Port Washington, L.I., (516) 883-7575.
SUMMER . . .
Like their owners, dogs left alone in apartments need air-conditioning, particularly pug-nosed types, which have difficulty breathing in hot weather.
Of course, dogs should have plenty of water at all times in extreme heat; leave several bowls around if you plan to be out all day. . . .
AND WINTER  If rock salt irritates your dog's paws, wipe them with a moist cloth after each walk.
Boots help, too, but putting them on four times a day can be tedious.
Ditto for sweaters.
ABUSE  It is a misdemeanor offense to kill, maim, injure, torture, abandon or fail to provide food for a dog.
Violators can be sent to prison for a year and fined $1,000.
Having dogfights for profit or amusement is a felony, punishable with four years in jail and a $25,000 fine.
Anyone who sees such abuses should call the A.S.P.C.A. -- in New York, (212) 876-7700.
TOYS  As a rule, big toys for big dogs, small ones for puppies.
Mrs.
Applebrook of the Pet Department Store recommends, for city dogs, balls that light up when they are dropped, making them easily found in dark parks; an indoor frisbee that won't "ruin your crystal," and feathered toys with a turkey odor that fit over doorknobs (endlessly amusing).
DEATH  If your dog dies at home, call your vet, who can help you decide whether to have it cremated or buried in a pet cemetery.
It's a good idea to check with the Better Business Bureau or ask around for recommendations.
A pet's death can be as painful as that of a family member.
Therapy sessions are available to help children and adults deal with grief.
Call the A.S.P.C.A. or write to Hospice, 58 Pearl Street, Kingston, N.Y. 12401.

Oct. 10-16: Talking Peace; Israel and the P.L.O. Pass Another Milestone On a Tortuous Road
The meter was running last week for Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Their Sept. 13 agreement in principle to create Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip went into effect Wednesday, and with that came the start of complex talks on how Israel will carry out a troop withdrawal to begin by Dec. 13 in Gaza and Jericho.
Handshakes on the White House lawn may be fine, but success or failure now lies in nailing down thousands of details.
How big is the Jericho district?
Will Israeli soldiers patrol surrounding roads?
Will Palestinian police officers work with the Israeli Army against terrorists?


New Fund Tables: Ugh!
Sept. 19, this section introduced mutual fund tables that offer more data, but eliminated net asset values.

In the East as in the West, Frenzy Feeds Finance
A man ran frantically up the dark center aisle during a concert at Symphony Space recently and began to dance, waving his arms in the air right in front of the singer and her accompanists.
He pulled a wad of dollar bills out of his pocket and threw them on the stage.
But instead of being outraged or surprised, the performers smiled and bowed to him warmly in midphrase.
The concert was the first in the World Music Institute's seasonlong survey of music from the Islamic world, and the singer was Abida Parveen, a renowned Pakistani vocalist who specializes in Sufi mystical songs.
One of the Sufi musical traditions, qawwali, involves performances of these songs at the shrines of Sufi saints.
The poems, along with the repeated phrases and improvised variations on them, are meant to bring an audience to a state of religious frenzy.
When moved by the music, listeners offer money to the Sufi religious leader; the offering is meant partly as a spiritual transaction, but it also helps support the performers.

To the Editor:
The opening paragraph of "Tables Revamped to Aid Investors" (Mutual Funds, Sept. 19), promising "more comprehensive information," gave me the approximate sinking feeling that one gets when a letter arrives from the TV cable company announcing that the previous glorious lineup of offerings has been further improved -- by deleting two of my favorite channels and adding three new and totally unwanted replacements for only a 10 percent raise in my monthly fee.
I regret to say that the sensation did not go away.
If prices and price changes are worthy markers for stock tables, I fail to see why they should not also be appropriate for mutual funds.

A 'New' Masterpiece for the Verdi Canon?
Against all probability -- for important works by commercially successful composers do not easily disappear -- this century is getting a chance the last one missed: to hear what Giuseppe Verdi was doing on the very eve of his most beloved operas.
In the summer and fall of 1850, just after temporarily giving up his cherished project of an operatic "King Lear" and just before beginning "Rigoletto," the 36-year-old composer was occupied with a new French play, "Le Pasteur," suggested to him by his librettist Francesco Maria Piave.
The subject is a Protestant clergyman, Stiffelius, whose Christian charity is tested by his wife's infidelity.
"Stiffelio," which reached the stage in Trieste in the same year and will be given its first Metropolitan Opera performance on Thursday, is not a "forgotten" Verdi opera like "Macbeth" and "Nabucco" and many others that have been revived.
They had successful lives, faded from the stage to make room for newer works and were revived when interest in the new faded in turn.
"Stiffelio" had almost no chance at life.
Censors mangled its story at the premiere and forced some early productions to secularize it entirely.
Verdi, convinced that the same would continue to happen, cobbled most of its music into another opera, "Aroldo," with a different plot. (In the meantime he had chosen the battlefield of "Rigoletto" to engage the censors.)


Slipping Dancers Into Fashion
AN air-conditioning duct may be no place for a dancer (or in this case, two dancers), but it illustrates a point: their bodies have to flex and stretch, and so do their performance clothes.
So, sympathize with the complexity of the task alloted to the 16 fashion designers who were asked to invent costumes for "A Demand Performance," a benefit for the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS on Monday at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center.
The event pairs famous dance groups with designers, for 19 six-minute works.

Giuliani on women's issues, she went on to say that she had recently been encouraged "by his embracing of the knowledge of just how sad the state of women's affairs are in this city." As a result of that omission, the article and its headline overstated Ms.

Highway Robbery at the Tollbooth; Amid Rash of Holdups, a Rising Sense of Danger for Collectors and a Call for Arms
It is nearly 10 P.M. and the toll taker at the Triborough Bridge's Manhattan Plaza is near the end of her shift.
Her routine is methodical, icily efficient.
She glances out the window to see the kind and size of vehicle approaching.
She then pushes a button to electronically post the fare on a display screen.
In a practiced movement, she reaches out for money.
She hands back a token or change.
She does this 300 times an hour, three seconds a car, an endless stream of stop-and-go.
Such are the labors of one of life's invisible people, a toll taker for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which last year collected $653.6 million from 277 million vehicles.
This particular transaction is recorded in grainy black-and-white images on a jerky surveillance video tape.
The woman, who officials would not name, is about to become a statistic, one of 26 Bridge and Tunnel officers to be robbed at gunpoint this year, already three times the number in all 1992.

DOLE TO OFFER BILL TO LIMIT PRESIDENT ON G.I. ROLE IN HAITI
The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, said today that he would introduce legislation to restrict President Clinton from committing forces for use in Haiti, except for reasons of national security.
Mr.
Dole said that restoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power was not worth a single American life and that the American people wanted more restraint on the use of troops abroad.
Administration officials responded that they would fight Mr.
Dole's proposal on both legal and foreign policy grounds.
Legally, they said, such legislation would constitute an infringement on the right of the President to make foreign policy.
Substantively, they said, the proposal would feed isolationist trends mounting around the country.

The White House sales pitch for its health care program began to veer off track even as President Clinton was delivering one of the biggest speeches of his career, the address to Congress laying out his goals for the health plan.
By then, Mr.
Clinton knew that inflation estimates were creeping upward and that the staff of the health care task force would be forced to revise the financial assumptions.


Devils' Lemaire on a Soapbox in the Coach's Box
The Devils' coaching staff is preaching that this is a new era for the team.That view is beginning to take root with the players, who have already exorcised two demons in the first five games of the season.
The Devils beat the Winnipeg Jets for the first time in 12 games with a come-from-behind victory last Tuesday at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
Then on Saturday night, the Devils won for only the sixth time in 39 visits to the Nassau Coliseum.

Stottlemyre Game 4 Start Likely
Cito Gaston, faced with two decisions for games in Philadelphia, said before tonight's second game of the World Series that he was leaning toward using Todd Stottlemyre as the starting pitcher for Game 4, but he continued to stall on his designated-hitter decision.
The Toronto manager ruled out Juan Guzman as a possible starter for the fourth game, pointing out that he threw 121 pitches Saturday night.
"He's pitched better on four days than three days," Gaston said, adding, "It might be Todd, it might be Al Leiter. But right now I'm leaning toward Stottlemyre."

Thatcher Tells of '89 Plan With Paris to Rein In Bonn
Worried that a reunified Germany would dominate Europe, the leaders of Britain and France took tentative steps in December 1989 and January 1990 to create a British-French entente to "check the German juggernaut," Lady Thatcher has written in her memoirs.
But the plan, which she said evolved from three private meetings with President Francois Mitterrand, eventually came to nothing because the French leader believed that the reunification of East and West Germany could not be stopped and sought instead to contain a newly powerful neighbor by promoting a more integrated, federated Europe.


'90 Tax Rise Overshadows Trenton Races
The candidates for the New Jersey Legislature know they will face difficult fiscal decisions if they win on Nov. 2: on aid for public schools, auto insurance premiums and Federal clean-air standards, not to mention the perennial question of how to balance the budget.
But their campaigns, by and large, are not focusing on the future.
Instead, both parties are endlessly replaying the events of the last four years, with both Republicans and Democrats trying to drive home the same message: Our party acted responsibly and in the public interest and deserves voter support.


It's Tillman and Miller and Watch This Space
Like running back Lewis Tillman, linebacker Corey Miller was the man everyone wanted to talk to after the Giants beat Philadelphia.
They were the two Giants players in demand the most, which is a surprise, since before this season no one expected them to become stars.
Miller has turned into one of the best outside linebackers in the game, a spirited player who has four sacks and two interceptions in his last two games.
Miller's career resembles that of Junior Seau, the San Diego linebacker who erupted onto the scene in the National Football League.
But unlike Seau, Miller hasn't received the publicity or respect.
Until now.

METRO DIGEST
A BARRIER TO HEALTH-CARE PLANS Two weeks ago, Earn J. Lloyd of Morris Heights, the Bronx, staggered into the emergency room at Montefiore Medical Center nearly comatose, nearly blind and barely able to walk.
Doctors discovered he had severe diabetes, which kept him in the hospital for 10 days.
But Mr.
Lloyd's more serious medical problem was the lack of a decent general doctor, which for him and hundreds of thousands of others in New York's poorer neighborhoods turns treatable outpatient diseases into life-threatening conditions.
This severe deficit of doctors in poor urban neighborhoods will make President Clinton's health-care plan, or any alternative, difficult to carry out in the areas that most need the help.

NEW YORK CITY  DIFFERING SHARPLY ON THE ECONOMY  As New York City struggles to shake itself out of its worst recession in half a century, the mayoral candidates are offering sharply different prescriptions on how to revive the local economy -- a split that mirrors a national debate over economic policy.
The Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, contends that fiscal conservatism -- keeping a balanced budget, streamlining city agencies and keeping them off the backs of business -- provides the best hope for the economy.
But Mayor Dinkins has unveiled proposals that many see as a sort of industrial policy, with the city marshaling resources to aid 12 industries in the hope that they will become centers of economic growth.

After Supporting Hunt for Aidid, U.S. Is Blaming U.N. for Losses

Last Thursday, 11 days after 18 American soldiers died in the raid, President Clinton sought to shift responsibility to the United Nations, which took over the Somali operation in the spring.

Books of The Times; Casey, Jackie, Mickey, Joe and Their Game
When you think about the years from 1947 through 1957, which Roger Kahn covers in his latest baseball book, "The Era," what comes to mind first, of course, is Jackie Robinson and the integration of the major leagues; the Yankees against the Dodgers in the 1947 World Series; Bobby Thomson's home run off Ralph Branca to end the 1951 playoff series between the Giants and the Dodgers, and the exodus of those two National League teams from New York City to California.
This is well-traveled territory, as the 173 entries in Mr.
Kahn's bibliography would seem to attest.
Is "The Era" therefore yet another account of how Cookie Lavagetto broke up Bill Bevens's no-hitter in the fourth game of the 1947 Series?
Or how Casey Stengel, the magical manager of the New York Yankees, and his which-ridden clauses charmed sportswriters into calling him "the old perfesser"?

Critic's Notebook; Shifting Perceptions of a Presidency
Presidential reputations are protean things, continually revised and annotated by shifting values and historical developments that vindicate or repudiate an individual President's decisions and world view.
Among the many factors that both shape and reflect popular perceptions of a President are biographies, memoirs and historical accounts of an administration.
The second volume of Robert A. Caro's biography of Lyndon Johnson ("Means of Ascent," 1990) left readers with an image of Johnson not as an architect of civil rights legislation, but as a politician of "utter ruthlessness" who "stole" his 1948 Senate election.
In contrast, David McCullough's affectionate 1992 portrait of Harry S. Truman ("Truman") served as the culmination of an ongoing process of rehabilitation, transforming an unpopular President (who left office with a 31 percent approval rating) into a kind of folk hero.

But the people who run these organizations, while generally favoring the President's ideas, nevertheless express many concerns and doubts about the proposal.


RESULTS PLUS
GOLF  Americans Win Dunhill  The American threesome of John Daly, Fred Couples and Payne Stewart edged defending champion England, 2-1, yesterday to win the Dunhill Cup in St.
Andrews, Scotland.
Although Stewart, the captain, shot a 74 to lose by four shots to Mark James, Couples carded a 68 to edge Nick Faldo by a stroke.
Daly beat Peter Baker, 70-73.
Earlier yesterday, the Americans beat Sweden in a semifinal, coming from a game down after Stewart lost to Jesper Parnevik by two shots.
Sweden was heading for a place in the final before Anders Forsbrand, a shot ahead of Couples, hit his second shot into a narrow stream.
The error cost him a penalty stroke and a double-bogey, which gave the American the lead.
Couples birdied the final hole for a 67 and a two-stroke victory. (AP) Victory in Playoff for Haas: Jay Haas, who birdied the last hole of regulation to force a playoff, sank a 10-foot birdie putt on the second extra hole to beat Bob Lohr and win the Texas Open in San Antonio.
Haas, who made a nearly 50-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole in regulation, earned $180,000. (AP)

NATO PLANES FLY SARAJEVO SORTIES
NATO warplanes flew low-level sorties today over Serbian gun positions on the mountains around Sarajevo, apparently in a warning to Serbian nationalist leaders not to resume the artillery attacks that caused heavy casualties and widespread panic in the Bosnian capital on Saturday.
United States and other allied aircraft from a force based in Italy and aboard aircraft carriers in the Adriatic Sea roared across the city throughout the day.
The low-level flights marked a return to a pattern established in the summer, when Serbian attacks on Sarajevo prompted NATO commanders to authorize what were described as "practice bombing runs" over the Serbian gun positions.

Divine Miss M Really Is: Anybody Can Tell You, And Everybody Will
"I bet you didn't expect me to look quite this fabulous," Bette Midler told the Radio City Music Hall crowd, opening her performance one night last week.
But in fact she was probably wrong.
In the eyes of this crowd and all the others who have flocked to Radio City to "Experience the Divine" (as Ms. Midler's show is being billed) the past five weeks, she was fabulous before she appeared on stage and remained fabulous all night long.
As one woman in the audience said at intermission: "I don't think my heart can take all this excitement. And she does look good."
With its gaudy costuming, bawdy burlesquerie and Ms.
Midler's booming balladeering, this is a show that parades a flamboyant star in civility-defying high style, portraying a heightened sense of life's miseries and joys and celebrating nothing if not fabulousness, a quality maybe not so easy to define but very easy to understand.

RACES FOR MAYOR FOCUSING ON CRIME
Pervasive fear of violent crime is dominating mayoral races across the country in a year that is seeing the largest turnover of big-city mayors in more than three decades.
In cities as diverse as Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Miami and Minneapolis, whether the races pit blacks against blacks, blacks against whites, whites against whites, or involve other ethnic groups, veteran mayors are retiring, and crime is the dominant issue.
In cities from New York to Seattle, challengers are using crime as a battering ram to try to unseat incumbents.


Review/Television; Blacks Who Make a Choice To Be Among Themselves
"The Faltering Dream" -- a reference to the Rev.
Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision of a color-blind society -- focuses on successful black professionals who have chosen to live in black neighborhoods, and on black college students who socialize mainly with other blacks on campus.
As the program's host, Walter Cronkite, says ruefully, "Many blacks now prefer to be equal but separate.
In Prince Georges County, Md., near Washington, Mr.
Cronkite finds "affluent self-segregation," complete with comfortable houses, safe streets, backyard barbecues and a country club.
Distressing though that may be to white liberals for whom integration remains the American ideal, the people who live in Lake Arbor have no apologies.
"I don't want to be a novelty," says a psychologist who could find a house in a mainly white neighborhood if that was what she wanted.

The Democrats' Big Guns
"The party of Bill Clinton is an aggressive and confident party, willing to confront its foes," said David Wilhelm, the chairman of the Democratic Party, in a recent speech, declaring Democrats' willingness to do battle with powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association.
Good for Mr.
Wilhelm.
But the party's boldness disappeared late last month when key House Democrats helped defeat an amendment to end the Army's Civilian Marksmanship Program -- a pet N.R.A. boondoggle.
Indeed, the sponsor of the amendment, Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, had to fight some Democratic leaders just to get her motion to the floor for a vote.
The program was established after the Spanish Civil War, when the Army found that too many recruits didn't know how to shoot.
It may have made sense in 1903, but such a program has no military value in the modern world of high-tech weaponry and well-trained reservists.
The Army concedes this point.

Banks See Excess in Reserves
As banks across the country report record profits, they are admitting that their problems with bad loans in 1990 and 1991 were overstated to such a degree that they can now recoup some of the charges that caused big losses in earlier years.
To some extent, the turnabout reflects the banks' own murky process for estimating loan losses, which includes a large margin for error at even well-run institutions.
But it is also a reminder that the fears of earlier years -- expressed in warnings from members of Congress and from Ross Perot, that banks could follow the downward spiral of savings and loans -- were exaggerated. 'May Have Gone Too Far'
"Congress and bank regulators were extremely concerned that banks be managed prudently," said David S. Berry, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, a securities firm specializing in banks.
"In retrospect, they may have gone too far."

The mean-spirited spectators who know he has Tourette's syndrome and try to unnerve him by contorting their faces and screaming as sometimes does a person with the disease are wasting their energy.
Eisenreich has heard it, seen it and conquered it.
There are about one million people in the United States who have the neurological movement disorder, which manifests itself in nervous twitches and impromptu shouts.
Only one of them plays major league baseball.
Only one of them is playing in the World Series.

Critic's Notebook; An Operatic Marilyn, Goddess or Victim, Doesn't Fill Spotlight
One question raised by the recent world premiere of Ezra Laderman's "Marilyn" at the New York City Opera is whether Marilyn Monroe is the proper subject for an opera.
And if she isn't, what should operas in our time be about?
It's a worthwhile question, for in its grandiose and somewhat distorted way, opera is another of those mirrors culture holds up to the times it lives in.
The very first operas in the early 1600's were about gods and goddesses, a fact explainable by their listeners.
Audiences were the height of Venetian nobility; and if opera was by nature larger than their own lives, who else would they have had to look up to?
Verdi spent most of his career in the midst of violent struggles toward a unified Italy, hence, perhaps, his taste for historical figures fighting comparable battles in a real or mythic past.


The Mayoral Campaign -- At Issue: The Economy; Fixing New York's Sick Economy
New York City's economy is limping along, with high unemployment and rising welfare rolls.
Voters naturally demand solutions from their leaders.
Mayor David Dinkins and his challenger, Rudolph Giuliani, have responded by offering development plans that promise to turn the local economy around.
The plan put forward by Mr.
Dinkins promises too much: 185 pages of proposals to channel money into biotechnology, business services, jewelry, apparel and about 10 other high- and low-tech industry clusters that often seem to have no more claim on taxpayer dollars than the fact that they hire lots of voters.
Mr.
Giuliani promises too little: Cut taxes to make it cheaper for business to operate in the city -- but leave it to some other time to figure out how to cut spending.

Terror of Duvalier Years Is Haunting Haiti Again
When President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled in 1986 after a popular uprising, Haitians thought for sure that they had rid themselves of the family dynasty that ruled the country with a tight grip for 29 years.
But the Duvalierists, once operating clandestinely, are now out in the open, in a sort of recurring nightmare.
In the last month, several military-backed political organizations have been formed with the common goal of preventing the return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President, who was ousted two years ago in a violent coup.

Immigration Hurts City, New Yorkers Say in Poll
With the largest wave of immigration since the turn of the century raising New York City's foreign-born population to 28 percent, most residents say there are too many immigrants in town and add that while most are law-abiding, they have made the city a worse place to live, a new poll has found.
At a time when several illegal immigrants have gone on trial in the bombing of the World Trade Center, the poll also found that most New Yorkers think illegal immigrants pose a serious threat of terrorism and believe that the trade center bombing would not have occurred if immigration controls had been tighter.

What, No Practice? Eagles Tell O'Brien To Just Go Wing It
What a scenario.
Bubby Brister, the Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback, goes down late in the first quarter of a scoreless game against the Giants with a badly sprained right ankle.

Can O'Brien, discarded this year by the Jets and then the Green Bay Packers, become an instant hero?
Unfortunately for the Eagles, no.
Under the circumstances, O'Brien did well, but the Giants had too many weapons and beat the Eagles, 21-10.

NEWS producers rarely make news, and when they do, it's not necessarily good news.
Thus, it was surprising -- and for them, probably dismaying -- when the top producers of the NBC and ABC nightly newscasts became caught up in news stories last week.
At NBC, the executive producer of "Nightly News," Jeff Gralnick, made headlines by referring to the Somali faction leader, Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, as an "educated jungle bunny."

The Great Goalie Debate Is More Like a Monologue
When the Islanders left practice at the Long Island Skating Academy today, they saw, on nearby lawns, some colorful signs urging voters to "Support Healey," a candidate for public office.
The spelling is slightly different, but it's close enough to remind them of Glenn Healy, the goalie who helped take the Islanders to the third round of the Stanley Cup playoffs last season before ending up with the Rangers through expansion drafts and trades.


Turks' War With Kurds Reaches a New Ferocity
One year after Turkish generals said they had broken the spine of a Kurdish separatist insurgency in these wild and remote uplands, the war has become more violent and more intractable than ever before.
Since the breakdown in May of a cease-fire declared by the rebel movement, the avowedly Marxist Kurdish Workers Party, more than 1,600 people, many of them civilians, have died, the Government says.
That toll amounts to the worst wave of killing in a nine-year war that has claimed more than 7,400 lives and raised fundamental questions about the stability of an area central to regional American policy.

Recrimination and rage mixed with family pride and a sense of betrayal have welled up in an unusual and very public struggle inside one of Canada's wealthiest families and one of its most successful companies, McCain Foods Ltd.
The issue: Who will succeed the two surviving McCain brothers to run the $2.3 billion family business?
The fight has become so bitter that the two brothers communicate chiefly through lawyers, other intermediaries and memos.
Consider this brotherly exchange of memos between the two, when one of them, Harrison, the chairman and co-chief executive, asks his brother, Wallace, the president and other co-chief, why he opposes him.

Candidates' Views on Economy Reflect U.S. Debate Over Policy
As New York City struggles to shake itself out of its worst recession in half a century, the mayoral candidates are offering sharply different prescriptions on how to revive the local economy -- a split that reflects their philosophical differences over the limits of city government and mirrors a national debate over economic policy.
The Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, contends that fiscal conservatism -- keeping a balanced budget, streamlining city agencies and keeping them off the backs of business -- provides the best hope for the economy, allowing private enterprise to flourish on its own.
Venture Capital Funds
But Mayor David N. Dinkins has unveiled proposals that many see as a sort of municipal version of an industrial policy, with the city marshaling resources to the aid of 12 specific industries, ranging from garbage recycling to biotechnology research, in the hope that they will become centers of economic growth.

Shortage of Doctors in Poor Areas Is Seen as Barrier to Health Plans
Two weeks ago, Earn J. Lloyd of the Bronx staggered into the emergency room at Montefiore Medical Center nearly comatose, nearly blind and barely able to walk.
Doctors discovered he had severe diabetes, which kept him in the hospital for the next 10 days.
But Mr.
Lloyd's more serious medical problem was the lack of a decent general doctor, which for him and hundreds of thousands of others in New York's poorer neighborhoods, turns treatable outpatient diseases like diabetes into life-threatening conditions.
In vast stretches of inner city New York -- from Harlem to Crown Heights to Morris Heights, where Mr.
Lloyd lives -- there are only a handful of doctors and virtually none who offer patients a reasonable standard of primary care.


Unemployment
The average length of unemployment claims is at an all-time high in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in what state labor department officials say provides one of the most graphic indications of a job market that continues to shrink.
The average length of claims gives a picture of the job prospects of the recently unemployed but does not account for those entering the job market or the long-term unemployed.
While unemployment rates have fallen, after soaring to their highest levels in a decade last year, employment remains flat in the region largely because jobs are not being created.
New York's Labor Department currently estimates the average worker who loses their job will be out of work for more than a year.

Speaking before a group of environmentalists at the foot of Pier 26 in lower Manhattan, Mr.
Dinkins criticized the "say-nothing, do-nothing, anti-environmental candidacy" of his Republican-Liberal opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has so far not made environmental protection a major theme of his campaign.

Conservative Candidate Seen as Spoiler and Foil
When George J. Marlin, the Conservative Party candidate for Mayor of New York, pulled a rubber chicken out of his pocket and flopped it toward the empty place at the table where he had hoped Rudolph W. Giuliani would be a sitting duck in a televised debate yesterday, Mayor David N. Dinkins chuckled -- and not just because it was funny.
In fact, Mr.
Marlin, a 41-year-old investment manager and political novice from Queens, could end up costing Mr.
Giuliani vital conservative votes in a contest that polls suggest remains too close to call.
Though his support has hovered at only a couple of percentage points, that may change after encounters like the one with Mr.
Dinkins yesterday morning on WNBC-TV, and another last Thursday on the cable channel New York 1, both of which amounted to tag-team attacks on Mr.
Giuliani.


A Timely Peace Prize
The joint award of the Nobel Peace Prize to President F. W. de Klerk and his former prisoner, Nelson Mandela, was astute and well timed.
These two South Africans have been wary but nevertheless indispensable partners in a transition to non-racial democracy that will become a reality in elections scheduled for next April.
Thus the award endorses and helps propel a marvelous transformation few expected to occur in this century.
While celebrating what it called "Mandela's and de Klerk's constructive policy of peace and reconciliation," the Nobel Committee seemed to be honoring the process of racial peace as much as the two men who were largely responsible for it.
"These are not saints," Francis Sejersted, the chairman of the committee, said in Oslo.
"They are politicians in a complicated reality and it is the total picture that was decisive."

Officer Injured by Shots Through Window
A police officer was hit with shards of shattered glass yesterday after two stray bullets plowed into the 88th Precinct house in Brooklyn, the police said.

Joseph Gallagher, a police spokesman.
She was later released.
The incident occurred at 5:25 P.M. when a man across the street from the precinct house, at 298 Classon Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, fired numerous shots at another man, the sergeant said.
One bullet smashed through a first-floor window, injuring no one.
A second bullet shattered a second-floor window and sprayed glass at Officer Durity.

Piling It On as Mayoral Campaign Tackles Race
For three and a half years, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani bobbed and feinted toward their electoral rematch, the issue of race a mostly unspoken taboo between them, just as it was in their last campaign.
But since President Clinton mused aloud three weeks ago that too many New Yorkers were unwilling to back the Mayor because he is black, all boundaries seem to have fallen.
How that happened in the most diverse city in the nation, where political victories have long depended on coalitions that cross racial and ethnic lines and where political oratory has long been famously crass, is a testament to many factors, but above all to the closeness of the contest and to the belief in both camps that appeals to pride, prejudice, anxiety or guilt can be used to influence the votes of at least some New Yorkers.

Review/Music; Ozawa Tackles Complexity of Henze's Eighth
The Boston Symphony Orchestra, which has commissioned so much that is beautiful and important in 20th-century music, brought the newest of its children to Avery Fisher Hall on Friday night.
Here, Hans Werner Henze's Eighth Symphony was framed by works of Berlioz.
On Wednesday and Thursday at Carnegie Hall, the orchestra played the Bartok First Piano Concerto with Krystian Zimerman and then the Mahler Fourth Symphony.
All three concerts were conducted by Seiji Ozawa who is celebrating his 20th season as music director in Boston.
It is a comment on Mr.
Henze's powerful personal voice that his Seventh Symphony -- which can sound so queasy and distasteful in the listener's ear -- and this serenely high-spirited new one use by and large the same methods and materials.
A dominating message in Mr.
Henze's symphonic style is that moods are not monoliths, that what we receive under the heading of anguish or good humor is in fact roiling complexity composed of many elements.

No Screaming, Just the Facts: Giants Are Alone in First
The Giants, in a very rapid and startling transformation, have taken on the personality of their coach, Dan Reeves.
He has turned this year's Giants from complainers to a gritty, cohesive unit that plays smart, doesn't quit and says all the right things.
If this is beginning to sound like "The Waltons Go to Giants Stadium," sorry.
Yet this attitude brings up another trait of this team, another way in which it has become a carbon copy of its coach.
Take the atmosphere in the locker room after they beat up on the battered Philadelphia Eagles, 21-10, before 76,050 at Giants Stadium.
They had just beaten a team that had won five straight and 9 of the last 10 games against the Giants.
They had just vaulted to sole possession of first place in the National Conference East -- still the league's toughest division -- with a 5-1 record.
The last time they were in first alone was Week 16 of 1990.

Confusion Over Verdicts in Denny Trial
This careworn city was in a state of nervous limbo today as it once again awaited the possibility of verdicts in a racially tense trial: the case of two black men accused of beating a white truck driver in last year's riots.
On Saturday, the jury said it had reached verdicts on 9 of 15 counts against the two men and had deadlocked on the others.
The judge, John W. Ouderkirk of Los Angeles County Superior Court, indicated he might read the verdicts on Monday but said he would also ask the jury to consider deliberating further on the unresolved counts.

Stewart Again Loses His Cape and His Location
Philadelphia's John Kruk said there was no reason to panic just because the Phillies were facing Dave Stewart.
Just because Stewart was "90-0 in the post-season," as Kruk estimated.
"Hopefully he's due for a loss," Kruk said, as the Philadelphia Phillies' first baseman and resident wit said before the second game of the World Series.


Workplace Drug Tests Incriminate Unfairly
To the Editor:
"Testing Workers for Drugs Reduces Company Problems" (front page, Oct. 10) neglects to mention the countless victims of urine-testing abuse who have been wrongfully fired without the slightest evidence that their performance has been adversely affected by drugs.


Kasparov Builds an Unshakable Defense
For weeks Gary Kasparov has spent his energies fine-tuning his favorite defense, but not until Game 18 of his world championship match with Nigel Short yesterday in London did it look foolproof.
Short could get nowhere, and after 34 moves, he and Kasparov shook hands on a draw.
The half-point brings the Russian's tally to 11 1/2 points, so that one more point will give him the 12 1/2 required to win the 24-game series and a $1.43 million share of the $2.55 million purse.
Short, at 6 1/2 points, thus cannot seriously be considered in contention.

New Immigrants Test Nation's Heartland
Its milky white sky sits squat on the plains, a horizon unbroken but for grain elevators and water towers.
At a feed yard off Old Highway 83, cowboys gallop into the noonday sun, fringed chaps slapping their thighs.
Blond girls practice cheerleading jumps on square lawns adorned by pumpkins.
Near a central intersection, a large sign says simply: Have a Nice Day.
That is Garden City at first sight, stereotypical Kansas, wheatlands and cattle pens and rosy cheeks.
But before long, a second reality grows apparent.
There is a tortilla factory on Main Street, a Laotian market offering Thai videos on Fulton Street.
At dawn, hundreds of immigrants and refugees file into Slaughter Employee Parking at a giant meat-packing plant.  'A Little New York City'
At nightfall, while locals head to the Grain Bin for Texas two-step dancing, Mexican immigrants crowd into Saigon, a Vietnamese-run karaoke bar, and Southeast Asians pack the Pho Hoa One Restaurant, where the fish sauce and lemon grass are plentiful.

Italy in a Furor as 'Mata Hari' Talks of Military Plot
After months of scandal involving politicians and business executives, Italy has found a new and riveting focus of interest and intrigue -- a glamorous 34-year-old woman known as the "Mata Hari of Udine" who is telling tales of conspiracy in the army and the secret services.
For days the woman, Donatella Di Rosa, has appeared in just about every television news bulletin, magazine and newspaper explaining her allegation that top army personnel planned a coup to free Italy from organized crime, narcotics and corruption.

Gravity Lens Sightings Hint More Dark Matter
CONTINUING a burst of discoveries in a field where there had been none, still another group of scientists has detected the gravitational effects of what they think is the kind of unseen, or dark, matter that constitutes much of the mass of galaxies and largely dictates their shapes and motions.
The new findings encouraged astrophysicists to conclude that their experimental technique for probing galactic dark matter is sound and could in a few months establish its identity for the first time.
From the new observations, the galactic dark matter appears to be compact, massive objects smaller than the Sun and bigger than any known planets, radiating little or no detectable energy.

Paris Seeks to Rally Support for Its Opposition to Trade Talks
At loggerheads with Washington and increasingly isolated from its European partners, the French Government began a drive today to consolidate domestic support for its threat to torpedo global trade liberalization talks in the name of protecting French farmers.
With irritation over the French position mounting steadily abroad, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur spent the day receiving the heads of all political parties as well as key labor, business and artistic leaders in the hope of presenting a united front to the world.


Classical Music in Review
Juilliard Orchestra  Otto-Werner Mueller, conductor Avery Fisher Hall
The Otto-Werner Mueller one fondly recalls from the 1960's at the University of Wisconsin was a conductor who could rise thrillingly to a major challenge, and he did so again on Wednesday evening with a stirring account of Bruckner's Fourth Symphony.
His conception was noble and compellingly unified, and he carried the student players along in a performance that though far from note-perfect was infused with youthful ardor and Brucknerian generosity of spirit.


Is Montana Receiving Official Help?
Joe Montana is the most celebrated quarterback in the National Football League, perhaps the best ever.
Many players on the San Diego Chargers spoke in awe about their opportunity on Sunday to play against him.
But is Montana such an icon that game officials protect him against defenders trying to get to him?
Yes, say Charger players.
Yes, says their coach, Bobby Ross, and he says he plans to talk to league officials about it.
No, says a league spokesman, saying Montana is treated no differently from other quarterbacks.


Parents Occupy School Building in Protest
A group of 70 parents took over an auditorium at Public School 156 in East New York, Brooklyn, last night and said they would not leave until school officials found proper classrooms for students who have been displaced by the asbestos crisis.
Arriving with blankets and pillows for their children, who slept on the auditorium floor, the parents locked the auditorium doors from the inside and said they would stay several days if necessary.


Panel to Oversee La Guardia College Newspaper
To calm a rash of protests by City Council members, the president of Fiorello H. La Guardia Community College pledged yesterday to assert greater editorial supervision over a student newsletter that recently published an opinion article criticizing Jews.
In a letter to Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, Raymond C. Bowen, president of La Guardia, denounced the article, calling it "divisive journalism" and promising to create a new editorial board of faculty, administrators and students to oversee the newsletter, The Bridge.
Run by students, The Bridge now has an adjunct professor as an adviser.


Privatizing City Hospitals Would Be Costly and Inefficient
To the Editor:
Rudolph Giuliani's repeated calls to privatize the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation are distressing to those who work at and use municipal hospitals.
Privatization is not a new idea but it is repeated so often that people simply believe it will improve health care.
Unfortunately, it's not true.
Selling or leasing public hospitals will force New York City to spend more money than it now does, and will restrict access to care.


Review/Television; A Look at the Paranormal: It Turns Out to Be Normal
In "Secrets of the Psychics," James Randi, magician and skeptic, goes around making people who claim to be able to bend spoons, cure cancer and perform other marvels by the power of mind alone look silly.
The most amusing moments in this somewhat patchy edition of "Nova" are clips from his appearances on the "Tonight" show some years back, particularly his foiling of the then-celebrated superpsychic Uri Geller.
Mr.
Randi also demonstrates that you don't have to be a psychic to appear to be doing a stomach operation with your bare hands.
More recently, Mr.
Randi visited Moscow, where he is seen tormenting purported scientists and healers (who look like villains in B-movies) and two pleasant women who say they can describe a person's life in detail from a photograph.
For Mr.
Randi, a psychic is just a magician with pretensions.


Not Like the Movie: A Dare Leads to Death
Like the hero of the new movie "The Program," two teen-agers from Pennsylvania and another from Long Island lay in the middle of two different roads at night, apparently to prove they had nerves of steel.
Unlike the movie hero, they did not walk away unharmed.
Michael A. Shingledecker Jr., 18, of Polk, Pa., was killed almost instantly about 1 A.M.
Saturday when he and a friend were struck by a pickup truck while lying on a two-lane highway in Polk, a small borough in western Pennsylvania.
His friend, Dean G. Bartlett, 17, was critically injured.
And Michael Macias, 17, of Syosset, L.I., was critically injured when he was hit by a car at 10:40 P.M.
Saturday as he lay in the middle of Bayville Avenue in Bayville.

Canadiens Roll to Victory Over Nordiques  Guy Carbonneau assisted on first-period goals by Ron Wilson and Kevin Haller as the Montreal Canadiens mounted an early lead and went on to a 4-2 road victory over the Quebec Nordiques last night.
The Canadiens avenged a 5-2 loss to Quebec in Montreal last Saturday night.
The Montreal victory continued a curious pattern in meetings between the provincial rivals: Dating back to last season, the Canadiens have won the last four games in Quebec, while the Nordiques have won the last four in Montreal. (AP) Red Wings 6, Sabres 4: Shawn Burr scored his first three goals of the season and Ray Sheppard snapped a third-period tie to give Detroit the victory in Buffalo.
The Red Wings ended a four-game losing streak, while Buffalo extended its losing streak to six games.
For the fifth time in those six losses, the Sabres were tied or ahead going into the final period.
Sheppard beat Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek between the legs with a short low shot at 6 minutes 20 seconds of the final period on the power play. (AP) Jets 6, Oilers 3: Kris King scored his first goal of the season early in the third period to put Winnipeg ahead to stay at home.
The Jets' Thomas Steen had tied the score for the final time halfway through the second period.
Keith Tkachuk's score and Steen's second goal followed.
Edmonton goalie Fred Brathwaite, making his first start, stopped 36 shots while Jets goalie Bob Essensa blocked 23. (AP) Stars 5, Blackhawks 3: Mike Modano scored twice and added an assist in leading Dallas to victory in Chicago.
Darcy Wakaluk, playing his first game in goal this season for the Stars, chipped in with an assist during a three-goal Dallas first period.
In the final period, he made a spectacular save on Joe Murphy from point-blank range at 12:38 and one on a 50-foot slap shot by Steve Smith at 13:08 to help preserve the Stars' third victory.
The Blackhawks (1-4-2) are off to their worst start since the 1988-89 season (1-5-1). (AP) TENNIS Americans Stage Upsets in Beijing Steve Bryan, an American ranked No. 117 in the world, upset third-seeded Henrik Holm of Sweden, 6-4, 6-4, in yesterday's opening round of the Salem Open in Beijing.

Opening For 'Moon' Postponed
"Paper Moon," the $4.5 million musical in tryouts at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., became the first casualty of the Broadway season yesterday when its producer said the opening would be indefinitely postponed.
The producer, Roger Berlind, told the cast on Sunday that the show would not be going back into rehearsal after the tryout run ends on Oct. 24.
He said the show's writers are "going into rewriting mode," with the hope of a spring opening.
Mr.
Berlind said, however, that a Broadway opening this season was uncertain because it was impossible to know if an appropriate theater would be available.
The Broadway opening was originally scheduled for the Marquis Theater on Dec. 5.
A delay was announced last week, but Mr.
Berlind said then that there was a possibility the show would open before year's end.
"If it's not on the page, it's not on the stage," he said yesterday.
"We're 70 percent or 75 percent there, but there's some transitional writing required between scenes, and some rethinking of the second act."

Verdicts Are Hailed as a Final Chapter
While a jury continued to deliberate two serious counts against the two black men charged in the beating of Reginald O. Denny, black Southern Californians today generally greeted the early verdicts as a sign that the courts could administer justice equally.
Many whites, by contrast, found those verdicts, in which the two men were acquitted on most charges, too lenient for the brutal crimes captured on television.


Umpires Resent That Eye in the Sky Watching Over Them
"Kill the umpire!" isn't cried very much in ball parks anymore.
The threat conveyed raucous color, but was an empty threat.
Maybe political correctness doomed it.
So what is today's punishment for bad calls, the penalty for merely being a man in blue?
Embarrassing television replays, if you believe the blue men and their complaints about CBS's overhead camera.


Linking Exports to Aid
At first glance, the Clinton Administration's new export policy is dismaying.
Mr.
Clinton wants to reinstitute a practice, known as tied aid, whereby the U.S. would give development aid to poor countries on condition that they purchase U.S. goods.
For example, the U.S. would give Paraguay cash to help build a dam; the U.S. would also provide subsidized loans with which Paraguay would be required to buy the needed construction equipment from U.S. companies.
The U.S. largely abandoned this practice 20 years ago because linking aid to exports isn't good for recipient countries or fair trade.
At second glance, however, Mr.
Clinton's policy is defensible as a means to pressure other donors to cut back the suspect practice.
Mr.
Clinton hopes that if we play the game just a little, our trading partners will play it a whole lot less.


Cambex
Shares of the Cambex Corporation, a Waltham, Mass., company that designs and manufactures computer hardware for I.B.M. mainframe systems, shot up yesterday.
There has been no recent news from Cambex, but some analysts said that investors might be anticipating new growth in the sagging mainframe market.


He's Driven One Lately
To the Editor:
You do readers a disservice and mislead by criticizing the new chairman and the former chairman of Ford Motor Company for not owning cars ("Blissful Ignorance in Detroit," editorial, Oct. 8).

I.B.M. Begins Service Shift
The International Business Machines Corporationis consolidating its service business, a fast-growing field that the company is counting on to help it recover financially.
The streamlined organization is an effort to deliver computer services more efficiently to customers, analysts said.
In a memo to employees yesterday, the company announced that Dennie M. Welsh, currently the chairman of the Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation, would also be general manager of services at the parent company.
Integrated Systems Solutions is the I.B.M. unit that supplies outsourced data processing and helps customers put together computer systems that typically include different kinds of hardware and software, a task known as systems integration.

Seventeen of Wall Street's leading underwriting firms, which handle the bulk of the municipal bond business, today announced a ban on political contributions that are made to win the lucrative business.
The announcement came after a meeting of the top executives of most of the firms and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt Jr.


Sports of The Times; Engaged In a Great Civil War
BY now, nearly everyone is aware of the sweeping currents that threaten to transform intercollegiate athletics and dismantle the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the self-anointed "voice" of college sports.
Two significant meetings are taking place today that strike directly at the N.C.A.A.'s foundation: one challenges the organization's leadership style, the other questions the N.C.A.A.'s ability to govern in a fair and equitable manner.

MARIO LEMIEUX, still recuperating from back surgery, skated and shot pucks with his Pittsburgh Penguins' teammates yesterday for the first time since the season started.


Separated At First: Kruk and Olerud
One first baseman has shaggy brown hair, a full beard, a protruding stomach and enough witticisms to earn him a guest appearance on "The Late Show With David Letterman." The other first baseman has hair that does not reach his collar, a lean physique and is so reserved and polite that Letterman will not be calling for comedic material anytime soon.
One is John Kruk, the 5-foot-10-inch, 214-pound bouncer for the Phillies.
The other is John Olerud, the 6-5 choir boy for the Blue Jays.
While Kruk epitomizes a renegade image, Olerud epitomizes an all-American-boy image.
They may be as different as two players who play the same position could be.


Mr. Dole's Bad Idea
When President Bush was building up for the Persian Gulf war, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas had some reservations about sending troops to the gulf; but he backed his President.
In October 1990 he said the only reason the United States had entered the conflict was "O-I-L," and that that was not something American parents were anxious to see their sons and daughters die for.
By February, George Bush was riding an 84 percent approval rating and Senator Dole was able to see the bright side of this Presidential military initiative.
"There will be no letup, no cease-fire, no time-outs until Saddam Hussein himself raises the white flag," Mr.
Dole said.
But now, presented with a Democratic President with pallid public support, he has become a champion of Congressional prerogative.
On Sunday he announced he would introduce a measure in Congress limiting President Clinton's ability to deploy American troops in Haiti without Congressional approval.


Chase Posts 52% Jump In Third-Quarter Net
The Chase Manhattan Corporation said yesterday that it earned $267 million in the third quarter, up 52 percent from a year earlier on the strength of high trading profits, fewer problems from bad loans and a wide spread between what it pays for deposits and what it charges for loans.
Also yesterday, the PNC Bank Corporation, the holding company for Pittsburgh National Bank, reported record profits, and Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., posted a drop in earnings.


Comet to Hit Jupiter With Texas-Sized Bang; Astronomers Gear Up
A COMET on a collision course with Jupiter is behind the Sun now, out of sight but not out of the minds of astronomers, who are busy plotting its trajectory, estimating the potential power of its impacting force and planning ways of observing the reverberating effects with an array of telescopes on Earth and in space.
The astronomers are eagerly anticipating their first opportunity next July to observe explosive impacts on a planet that could be comparable in strength to the collision of a large asteroid or comet with Earth 65 million years ago, the catastrophe implicated in the mass extinctions of dinosaurs and many other species of life.

Merck Profit Rises 11.2%; Sales Up 3.2%
Merck &amp; Company and the American Home Products Corporation, two of the country's largest health care companies, yesterday reported single-digit growth in third-quarter sales and lackluster profit gains.
Overall results were in line with most analysts' projections, but Merck reported earnings slightly above expectations on a per-share basis.
Reflecting growing competition at home, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and recently imposed German price controls, the gains also suffered in comparison with the 1992 third quarter, the last strong period before growth in the pharmaceutical industry slowed.

Market Place; A First Boston analyst sees great things for Crown Cork and Seal.
BOTTLE caps and aluminum cans, on the face of it, are pretty mundane items.
But a First Boston analyst says that many on Wall Street "just don't get it" by not jumping at shares of Crown Cork and Seal, the world's No. 2 plastic bottle and aluminum can maker.
Timothy P. Burns has broken ranks with his analyst brethren who have neutral ratings on the Philadelphia-based packaging company.
He claims Crown Cork is a "strong buy" based on the company's good showing during difficult times for its industry and because of some strategic decisions that are reshaping the $3.7 billion company.
Though his opinion is in the minority, it carries a lot of weight, largely because Mr.
Burns snared the No. 1 spot in the latest rankings of packaging analysts by Institutional Investor magazine.

Putting Everything in a Notebook, Neatly Tabbed
THE COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION, in a welcome effort to make personal computers easier to use, has teamed up with the originators of the graphical user interface to create a much simpler way to work with Microsoft Windows software.
Novice computer users especially, but also many experienced Windows users, will find it a cause for rejoicing.
The ease of use comes about through special software called Tab Works that Compaq, a hardware company, plans to install on most of its future computer models, company officials said yesterday.
Tab Works is basically a "shell" for Windows that reorganizes files and applications in a notebook metaphor that will be familiar even to people who have not used a computer before.


NWA INC.
To a degree, NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, could count on a solid performance in the third quarter because it would compare favorably to the results posted during last year's debilitating fare war.
Still, a number of restructuring moves allowed the company to report yesterday that it had seen a jump in net income in the third quarter to $112.3 million this year from a net loss of $19.7 million in the similar 1992 period.
The Minneapolis-based carrier is eager to tell a good story about its long-beleaguered finances because the privately held company wants to offer stock to the public next year.
It restructured its long-term debt in the summer to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection.

Did Bell Atlantic Go to Its 2d Choice?
Tele-Communications Inc. may not have been the Bell Atlantic Corporation's first choice for a merger partner.
As recently as July, Bell Atlantic had exploratory talks with the Cablevision Systems Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest cable television operator, several industry executives said yesterday.
That was a month before the beginning of serious negotiations between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, which culminated in the regional telephone company's decision last week to buy both Tele-Communications and the Liberty Media Corporation for a total of $33 billion.


TRAVELERS CORP. (N)
As expected, the Travelers Corporation reported a loss of $36 million for the third quarter yesterday.
Travelers avoided posting an even higher loss, industry analysts said, by releasing $16 million from tax contingency reserves.
Travelers, based in Hartford, said the loss resulted from a previously announced after-tax addition of $211 million to the reserve for asbestos and environmental claims and litigation.


Delta Air Switches Agencies on Shuttle
Delta Air Lines said yesterday that it had dismissed Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG of New York and moved its $6 million to $8 million Delta Shuttle account to BBDO New York, without a review.
BBDO's Atlanta office already handles Delta's main account.


Review/Music; A Birthday Tribute to Elliott Carter
It is somewhat quixotic to proselytize for the music of Elliott Carter at this late date.
For those of us who are moved by his works, he is clearly a contemporary master whose agile mind has given us a series of compelling works written in a robust and idiosyncratic musical language.
But for most listeners he is a cipher, an intellectual whose cerebral fantasies are suitable only for specialists.
And as celebrations begin for his 85th birthday this winter, neither the size of these opposing camps nor their arguments are likely to change.
In fact, when Speculum Musicae presented a concert of Mr.
Carter's works on Thursday night in honor of his birthday, including two American premieres and one piece new to New York, the faithful could not even fill the chamber-size Merkin Hall.


Comptroller's Race Reveals Ticket Politics
When Herman Badillo, the Republican-Liberal candidate for comptroller, campaigns these days, the top of his ticket, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is often at his side.
Several of his television commercials have featured or been partly paid for by Mr.
Giuliani.
And his campaign platform, from privatizing hospitals to slashing the city workforce, closely matches Mr.
Giuliani's.
But when Mr.
Badillo's Democratic opponent, Alan G. Hevesi, campaigns, it is usually without his running mate, Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Mr.
Hevesi has not produced any television commercials that mention Mr.
Dinkins.
And though he supports some of Mr.
Dinkins's ideas, he routinely emphasizes his desire to remain independent and critical of the Mayor.

A Russian naval ship dumped hundreds of tons of low-level nuclear waste into the the Sea of Japan over the weekend, touching off a sharp diplomatic dispute between Tokyo and Moscow today just after they had declared a new era of cooperation.
Dumping radioactive materials into the ocean has been banned worldwide for more than 30 years, and a decade ago the prohibition was extended to low-level waste.

The execution was canceled after a Federal judge repeated his ruling of Oct. 8 that the prisoner could be sent back to New York, where he faces a sentence of 20 years to life.


Welfare Reform? First Improve Child Care Aid.
To the Editor:
We applaud Richard P. Nathan's call to make the Family Support Act work before launching a new effort at welfare reform (Op-Ed, Oct. 7).
The act has indeed fallen far short of its goals.
In particular, the child care guarantees that would make it possible for mothers to participate in job training or to take the entry-level positions that might be available have not been fulfilled.


New Yorker Tries for the Knicks
After growing up in Harlem and attending St.

Cain knows that others give him a slim chance of making the Knicks' final 12-man roster.
But that will not stop the free-agent point guard from giving his all.
"I don't have time to be nervous," Cain said before the Knicks' 100-90 victory over the Phoenix Suns in their preseason home opener.
"This is the chance of a lifetime and I don't want to let it slip by. I know I can play at this level, there's no doubt in my mind. I just have to stick to the things I do best."

As part of the acquisition, which had been expected, Groupe FCA will operate under the Publicis-FCB Communications network alliance.
Groupe FCA, which was created in 1966 by two former Publicis employees, Jean Feldman and Philippe Calleux, has 14 offices in Europe and 2 in the United States that operate under the Bloom FCA banner.
Groupe FCA has billings estimated to exceed $438 million, or 2.5 billion French francs, from clients like Sandoz Pharmaceuticals and the Scott Paper Company.
With the deal, those billings will be added to Publicis's billings, which are estimated at $3.5 billion, or 20 billion francs, from clients like Colgate and Shell.
Both agency networks share major clients like Nestle, L'Oreal and Henkel.


Sherrard Out for Season, Leaving the Giants Short
Giants wide receiver Mike Sherrard has been through enough tragedy in his eight-year National Football League career to last a lifetime.
He is very talented but terribly unlucky.
The latest bad news for Sherrard is a subluxated left hip, or a partial dislocation of the joint, which means his season is likely over.
There is also a danger that Sherrard again faces an injury that could end his career.
Sherrard, reached at his home tonight, said he didn't want to talk about the circumstances until Tuesday when he is scheduled to talk to the news media.

Does MARGARET THATCHER, now Baroness Thatcher, have a mother?
Careful readers of "Who's Who" have had cause to wonder.
For 30 years or so, the former Prime Minister's entry in the volume of notables has read, "b 13 Oct. 1925; d of late Alfred Roberts."
The Daily Telegraph reported last week that Lady Thatcher, who now sits in the House of Lords, was unaware of the omission.
"What do you mean?" the newspaper quoted her as saying when told that neither "Who's Who" of Britain nor "The International Who's Who" included any reference to her mother, Beatrice Roberts, who is also deceased.
"She was my mother. Well, I must correct that."

Army Goal: Somali Hearts and Minds
After a summer in which the United States used gunships and attack helicopters to pound sections of this city, the elite American forces that spent the Vietnam War trying to win hearts and minds have resumed the quest.
The United States Army Special Forces have thus begun to venture out in Somalia and have found a rare oasis of support in southern Mogadishu, the hostile blight that is the domain of the Americans' principal foe, Gen.

Giuliani Achieves Fund-Raising Success
The last time Rudolph W. Giuliani ran for mayor, he had to struggle hard in the last six weeks of the race to raise even half the amount of money that was flowing to the Democratic nominee, David N. Dinkins.
He was forced to borrow $200,000 from the Republican State Committee and he asked President Bush to help coax donations from the Republican faithful.
This time, Mr.
Giuliani raised all the money the law would allow him to spend with two weeks to go, even as Mayor Dinkins continued to worry about fund raising.

In an interview on his return from a meeting of leaders from 12 Latin American nations in Chile, Mr.
Salinas said that the fate of the trade accord had become a fundamental test of American relations not only with Mexico but also throughout the hemisphere.

Blue-Chip Issues Gain as Most Others Drop
After a wobbly start, blue-chip stocks racked up modest gains yesterday, driven by spurts among the pharmaceutical and transportation issues.
But broader indicators slipped as uneasiness over interest rates and fears that the market could not sustain its recent highs seemed to take their toll.
Bank stocks suffered after the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company reduced its prime lending rate to 5.5 percent from 6 percent.
Investors appeared worried that the move would chip away at the growing profits of banks like the Chase Manhattan Corporation, whose stock dropped 1 3/4, to 34 1/8.
Citicorp, the most active stock on the Big Board, fell 1 3/4, to 35 5/8.

Bridge
Half a century ago, a poll of experts voted Howard Schenken the best individual player in the world.
His widow, Bee Schenken, who died two weeks ago, was a fine player in her own right: equally at home in tournament play, winning seven national titles, and at the rubber bridge tables, where she was a steady winner.
On the diagramed deal, played a decade ago, she held the South cards and had a difficult rebid after opening one diamond and hearing a weak jump to three clubs.
She gambled with three no-trump and her partner had nothing to say.
As it turned out, five diamonds would have been a far better contract and six diamonds would have had good play, although failing as the cards lie.


PRIMERICA CORP. (N)
The Primerica Corporation reported third-quarter earnings yesterday that were better than expected, largely because of the strong performance of its Smith Barney Shearson investment banking unit.
Primerica's third-quarter net income of $258.7 million, or $1.03 a share, was about $30 million, or 6 cents a share, higher than what Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, had forecast.
Mr.
Moszkowski said he was likely to revise upward his $3.40 a share estimate for all of 1993 and $3.85 a share for 1994 because of Primerica's strong performance.

In addition, it will function as a charge card at participating restaurants, rather than simply as an identification discount card.

Life Springs Up in Ocean's Volcanic Vents, Deep Divers Find
Scientists on a research expedition off the Oregon coast are finding that the ocean's barren abyss can rapidly be colonized by new life.
The icy sea floor a mile and a half below this vessel has recently been heated by a volcanic eruption and enriched with a rush of minerals in solution, creating warm flows of shimmering water that have come alive with odd-looking colonies of bacteria, some sporting long tendrils that sway back and forth in warm currents.
The bacterial colonies, the scientists say, are eventually likely to become feeding grounds for complex forms of higher life.

In the most ambitious attempt so far to revive one of America's formerly vast and robust but now moribund ecosystems, 300 bison today galloped headlong onto 5,000 acres of unobstructed tallgrass prairie -- there to live free, eat their fill and play a major ecological role, as their ancestors once did.
Nervous at first in the presence of nearly 1,000 humans who had come to see them resume their ancient place in nature, nudged along by a phalanx of pickup trucks, they moved balkily from their small holding pasture toward the narrow end of a fenced-in chute that led to freedom.

In Philadelphia, D.H. Means Designated Headache for Blue Jays
For the first time in nine post-season games, the Toronto Blue Jays will have a different starting lineup for the third game of the World Series Tuesday night.
The change, however, is strictly involuntary.
If the Blue Jays had their way, the same nine players who were in the batting order for the six games of the American League pennant playoff and the first two games of the World Series would be on Manager Cito Gaston's lineup card for the game against the Philadelphia Phillies.
Instead, the name of Pat Hentgen will appear in the ninth spot and another name, most likely John Olerud, will be missing from the card.


Additional Ban for Chelios of Blackhawks
CHRIS CHELIOS, the All-Star defenseman of the Chicago Blackhawks, was suspended for two more games yesterday by the National Hockey League for his part in last Thkursday's melee with the Hartford Whalers.

He has missed two games since.
Following yesterday's hearing in New York, BRIAN BURKE, the N.H.L. director of hockey operations, said Chelios would be suspended for two more games -- Thursday night against Quebec and Saturday night against Detroit. (AP)


Arbitron Decides to Pull Out Of the TV Ratings Business
With yet another pebble in its pouch proving a dud, the Arbitron Company left the battlefield of television ratings yesterday, unable to trip up the industry Goliath, the A. C. Nielsen Company.

More than 400 of those layoffs will be in Laurel, Md., where the company's television ratings operations are based.

The Cable-Phone Revolution
The $30 billion merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc. presages a communications revolution.
If approved, this merger would be the first in the U.S. between a telephone company and a cable company -- raising the prospect that a single giant company will someday bring a wide array of entertainment and information services into the home: video phones, movies-on-demand, live lectures from university classrooms, video conferences with pediatricians, computerized banking, viewer-controlled instant replays of live sporting events.
But there's another possible reaction to the Bell Atlantic-T.C.I. behemoth: apprehension.
The company that owns video access to the home would also own programs that flow into the home.
To some critics, that invites monopolistic price-setting and monopolistic taste-setting.
Besides, opponents of the merger want phone and cable companies to compete against one another, not join forces.

Prime Rate Cut to 5 1/2% By Morgan
Morgan Guaranty Trust Company reduced its prime lending rate to 5 1/2 percent from 6 percent yesterday, the first among the nation's largest banks to take that step.
While the rate cut matters little to Morgan's customers, millions of individuals and small businesses could benefit if other banks follow.
Because Morgan's business is concentrated in trading and in advising large companies -- with little consumer or business lending pegged to the prime, other bankers and analysts said the large New York bank was cutting the price of something it does not sell.

Foreign Policy Tug-of-War: Latest in a Long String of Battles
When Senate Republicans demand a greater Congressional role in foreign policy, there must be a Democrat in the White House.
And when most Democrats support the use of troops abroad despite serious misgivings, the suspicion is confirmed.
Senator Bob Dole's demand for "certification" of American interests by President Clinton before any further involvement in Haiti, for example, stands in dramatic contrast to his words just before Congress voted to allow President Bush to make war on Iraq.
On that occasion the minority leader told the Senate, "I do believe that our best chance for peace and best hope for peace is to strengthen the President's hand in every way we can."

She developed a method to provoke anger in the subjects of experiments and developed a theory, in keeping with the Gestalt school, that the onset of anger depends more on situations than personality.

Human Noises in Ocean Held to Threaten Marine Mammals

Review/Music; The Pittsburgh With a Premiere
The good ship Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra lay in port at Carnegie Hall for two evenings over the weekend under big, colorful banners that whipped, crossed and tangled in the sonorous gusts.
First there were the flags of composers: Krzysztof Penderecki and Brahms on Friday, Mahler on Saturday.
Not far behind, and sometimes billowing proudly out front, was that of the orchestra's music director, Lorin Maazel.
Finally came that of Carnegie itself, since the Pittsburgh was the flagship of the hall's Mahler celebration, which extends through this season and into the next.
The main attraction on Friday evening was the New York premiere of Mr.
Penderecki's Adagio, of 1989.
Part of the composer's five-movement Fourth Symphony, the 35-minute Adagio was commissioned in France to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and intended to stand on its own as well.
It has enjoyed a flourishing independent career since its premiere, by Mr.
Maazel and the National Orchestra of France; last year it won the $150,000 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition, given by the University of Louisville.

After consulting with his legal experts, Mr.
Clinton said, he sent a letter to the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, and the minority leader, Senator Bob Dole, saying his Administration would oppose several amendments now circulating that would "unduly restrict the ability of the President to make foreign policy" and to exercise his authority as Commander in Chief.

But Coleman's attorney said the 6-foot-10-inch power forward would reject the proposal.
The attorney, Harold MacDonald, said the extension provided for $69 million over the eight years, but that the money up front was not enough and that the highest base salary, in the final year, was not guaranteed.

Ms.

Review/Theater; An Ethereal Classic Is Adapted
In Antoine de Saint-Exupery's gossamer children's fable "The Little Prince," the most famous words of wisdom, spoken by a fox to the little boy space traveler who has fallen into the Sahara Desert, are the reminder that "what is essential is invisible to the eye."
Those words unfortunately come back to haunt Rick Cummins and John Scoullar's musical adaptation of the French author's 1943 children's classic.
An ethereal allegory spun from whimsical images and quicksilver emotions all lifted from the childlike recesses of Saint-Exupery's imagination has been bluntly literalized in the production, directed by William Martin, at the 28th Street Theater.

And Richard McKee is still wickedly attempting to make the punishment fit the crime, as a grand, booming Mikado.

Miami Goes With Sophomore Quarterback
RYAN COLLINS, a sophomore who has played sparingly, will be the starting quarterback, rather than FRANK COSTA, for Miami on Saturday when the Hurricanes play Syracuse in the Orange Bowl.
In making the change, which he announced yesterday, Coach DENNIS ERICKSON broke the succession of famous Miami quarterbacks that covered a decade.
From BERNIE KOSAR to GINO TORRETTA, one followed the other and backups only played late in games already won.

DOES Louisiana hot sauce, a principal ingredient in the spicy New Orleans cocktail sauce commonly served with raw shellfish, kill certain bacteria found in raw oysters?
The answer is yes, at least in the laboratory, researchers said in a preliminary report at a national scientific meeting on microbes and antibiotics yesterday.
Principal ingredients of the traditional New Orleans cocktail sauce were found to kill a rare but sometimes fatal bacteria called Vibrio vulnificus.

Clinton Urging Voluntary Goals on Air Pollution
The Clinton Administration, in a new plan to reduce the waste gases that threaten to warm the global climate, has decided to avoid most mandatory controls in favor of voluntary goals and incentives, officials said today.
Environmental groups attacked the plan, whose outline had been known for a week and which is expected to be presented by President Clinton and Vice President Gore at the White House on Tuesday.
They said the plan favored industry groups worried about the costs of controlling carbon dioxide and other polluting gases that can trap heat within the atmosphere.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Consumer product companies seek better methods to gauge the effect of marketing on their sales.
THE more strenuously advertisers labor to achieve success in marketing consumer products, the more insistent the clamor grows to find methods to measure the effectiveness of advertising.
So the 84th annual meeting and conference of the Association of National Advertisers is trying to offer some solutions.
"Advertising, as a marketing and communications tool, will never command the respect it deserves until correlation between share of voice and profitable growth is firmly established," said DeWitt F. Helm Jr., president of the association, whose members account for more than 80 percent of annual spending on national and regional advertising.


County Executive Race Reflected In Refusal to Allow Tax Refund
The race for Nassau County executive spilled into the Board of Supervisors meeting this morning as Republican board members refused to approve a routine property-tax refund for a prominent contributor to the Democratic candidate, Benjamin L. Zwirn, the North Hempstead Supervisor.
Although Mr.
Zwirn abstained from the vote, Republicans said he acted questionably in allowing the board to consider the $18,168 tax settlement for Bert E. Brodsky, a Long Island developer, only days after Mr.
Brodsky loaned him $50,000 for his campaign.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS REBEL OVER TAXES IN FREE TRADE PACT
With the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement turning on a few undecided lawmakers, the Clinton Administration is now threatened with the loss of a group that is central to the White House's legislative strategy: conservative Republicans.
House Republicans have rebelled at the prospect of $2.37 billion in higher taxes over five years to replace tariffs eliminated by the free trade agreement, inflicting a serious blow to the pact's prospects with the vote only a month away.


Defendant in a Bombing Plot Released on Bail
A defendant in the conspiracy case to blow up New York City landmarks was released on bail yesterday, the only person to be freed in two major bombing cases involving the World Trade Center, the United Nations and the Hudson River tunnels.
A Federal judge in Manhattan released Earl Gant, a Philadelphia vendor charged with agreeing to help obtain explosives for the foiled plot, saying Mr.
Gant had "no real awareness of the enormity of what other people were planning."


The French To Overhaul Groupe Bull
In a move to prepare the troubled Groupe Bull for privatization, the French Government today named a new chairman to head the largely state-owned computer giant and announced that it would provide almost $1.5 billion in fresh capital to ease its debt burden.
As Groupe Bull's long-expected reorganization was disclosed, the Government also disclosed that Rhone-Poulenc, the state-owned chemical company, would be the next enterprise to be sold, followed by Elf Aquitaine, the big oil company, early next year.

Instead he will get more than a 100 percent increase and a total of more than $1.3 million over the two years.


Human Noises in Ocean Held to Threaten Marine Mammals
WITH the world's oceans increasingly disturbed with man-made sounds, scientists are facing a vexing dilemma: many of the most important discoveries about sea creatures and their environment are made by the use of sound, but some sounds generated by scientists may be contributing to the destruction of the very mammals they want to protect.
At a meeting here of the Acoustical Society of America this month, scores of experts presented evidence that the welfare and lives of some marine mammals were increasingly threatened by noise of human origin.


HAITI CAPITAL CALM AS STREETS EMPTY
The streets were empty of traffic and most businesses remained closed today as the deadline approached for an international naval blockade of oil and arms supplies to Haiti that goes into effect at midnight tonight.

ANTARCTIC OZONE HITS RECORD LOW
The amount of ozone in the atmosphere over Antarctica reached a record low this month, Government scientists reported yesterday.
This was the lowest recorded ozone level anywhere in the world, raising new concerns that measures to restrict the use of ozone-destroying chemicals may not be strong enough.
The scientists said the area of intense ozone depletion, commonly called an ozone hole, was not quite as wide as it had been a year ago.
But balloon-borne instruments showed that ozone, the atmospheric molecules that absorb harmful ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, was totally destroyed between the altitudes of 8.4 and 11.8 miles, creating an unusually thick void.

U.S. Renews Warning to Serbs on Sarajevo Shelling
The United States warned the Serbian leadership today for the second time in two months of the possibility of air strikes by NATO warplanes if there was a step-up in attacks on Sarajevo.
The warning was contained in a message from Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, reminding him of a statement on Aug. 3 by NATO that it would not tolerate "the strangulation of Sarajevo and other areas," and that it was ready to order retaliatory air strikes against Bosnian Serbs.

When former heavyweight champion Sonny Liston once said that he'd rather be a lamppost in Denver than the mayor of Philadelphia, probably not a lot of people argued.
The same probably applied when W. C. Fields said if the choices were either being dead or being in the City of Brotherly Love, then perhaps, all things considered, he'd rather be in Philadelphia.
Unfortunately for the city stuck in the backbone of the country's East Coast corridor, the identity crisis and the fight for respect have always been somewhat losing battles.


JUDGE REVERSES S.E.C. RULING ON CRACKER BARREL ISSUE
A Federal judge enjoined the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday from issuing letters that would allow companies to omit shareholder proposals on hiring discrimination and other employment-related matters from proxy statements.

Wood reversed an S.E.C. ruling late last year that Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc., a restaurant and gift-shop chain based in Lebanon, Tenn., did not have to include a shareholder resolution asking the company to develop a policy prohibiting discrimination against gay men and lesbians.
Her decision clears the way for the proposal to appear in the proxy materials at Cracker Barrel's annual shareholder meeting next month.

Liz Claiborne Profits Fall 40%; More Bad News May Come
Profits of Liz Claiborne Inc., the clothing manufacturer that has dressed legions of working women, plunged almost 40 percent in the third quarter, and the company warned Wall Street yesterday to expect more bad news through the remainder of the year.
Samuel M. Miller, the company's senior vice president of finance, said it now expected its earnings this year to be about 40 percent lower than in 1992, when profits were $2.61 a share.


Paris Designers Keep No Secrets
There is a desperation about the way European designers are striving to renew fashion for spring and summer.
Do women really want to dress like Greek statues in the electronics age?
Do they want to wear torn clothes and nose rings as punk dressers did a couple of decades ago?
Do they want to dress for dinner in clothes so flimsy that dinner should be served in the bedroom?
These are some of the concepts presented with great seriousness and conviction last week in the French ready-to-wear collections.
Granted that fashion is in a state of transition from the anything-goes exuberance of the 1980's to whatever is going to emerge as the style of the 1990's.
At the moment, it might be decadence.

Raiders' Kick Wins With 0:16

They scratched and clawed and climbed back into a 20-20 tie on Jason Elam's 37-yard field goal with 5 minutes 33 seconds remaining.
But with 16 seconds left, Jeff Jaeger kicked a low, booming line-drive 53-yard field goal for a 23-20 Raiders victory before 75,712 foot-stomping, shocked and disappointed fans at Mile High Stadium.

On this charge against one defendant, Damian M. Williams, the jurors said they were split 11 to 1, but they did not say in what direction.

Children Drew Some Scrutiny Before Inquiry
The four adopted children who the police said were kept in a locked and lightless attic while their parents collected $24,000 a year from a New York City adoption program had come to the attention of local school officials and state social-service officials before two of them broke out of their house and were caught shoplifting food at a supermarket.
The father of the children has said that the family had permission to educate them at home.
School officials say this is not true and that, in fact, the school system alerted the state Division of Youth and Family Services after it began investigating why the children were no longer coming to school.


Review/City Opera; 'La Rondine,' a Puccini Variation on the 'Traviata' Tale
For two acts, the New York City Opera and Puccini himself make a case for "La Rondine," a work that fell between "La Fanciulla del West" and "Il Trittico" and since then has never quite got to its feet.
This is Puccini at its light-footed and lyric best, with music that prods its characters into motion but does not mind pausing for the occasional set piece.
"La Rondine" returned to the house on Sunday afternoon, and opera lovers who don't mind putting up with anticlimax should go to hear it.
Ralph Funicello's first-act interior, with its undertones of pink and purple, is elegance without spectacle.
It gauges the weight of "La Rondine" perfectly.
Act III's Mediterranean scene is strewn with roses and hydrangeas.
Act II, I am afraid, is a jumble: a crowd scene without enough room for one.
The vague chorus singing echoed the visual confusions, but then there was Puccini's roof-raising ensemble number to win the afternoon.

At the same time, his campaign moved to attract a crucial constituency -- liberal Democrats -- by airing two new advertisements, one featuring Robert F.

Review/Theater; Self-Analysis as Forum For Deceiving Oneself
None of the characters in "Snowing at Delphi," Catherine Butterfield's play about a group of New Yorkers gathered in a country house for Christmas, are terribly shy about explaining what's gone wrong with their lives.
Fears, hostilities and personal philosophies are subjects to be presented, carved and served out like the holiday ham in this studiedly ironic comedy.
Never mind that the self-analysis often rings false.
That, as the author makes abundantly clear, is her point.
Ms.
Butterfield, who also appears in the play (and turns in its most credible performance), has a finely tuned ear for the language of self-deception.
And the evening's principal pleasures come from her ability to create lively dialogue among people whose elaborate systems of defense and justification are set up to be exploded.
"Know thyself" -- the inscription on the temple at Delphi, as one bombastic character announces -- becomes the play's shibboleth in a way that is both sardonic and earnestly sincere.

Trailing by double digits in a series of independent polls -- including a 15-point spread in the most recent New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll -- Mrs.
Whitman was under greater pressure to perform well in both debates before a statewide audience.

Review/Pop; Surfing U.S.A. Revisited
On Friday night, as it featured the surf guitarist Dick Dale, the Grand was filled with trash-culture enthusiasts, people for whom the overlooked and peripheral aspects of American popular culture are in fact a mainstream.
Mr.
Dale, who helped invent the surf-music genre in the late 1950's and early 60's, fit the audience's needs perfectly: he is a nearly forgotten figure whose music reflects the mania and voluminousness of American culture at that time.
Surf music, guitar-based and full of huge, whooshing sounds, is the expression of a certain type of innocent American modernity, pure California and pre-pollution, -Watergate and -Vietnam.
Mr.
Dale, playing a Fender Stratocaster, the quintessential American pop guitar, was hellbent on making noise.
He ran his fingers up and down the fret board in long glissandos, sending shimmering metallic sounds out into the room.
And he twanged away, letting the low notes ring like a jackhammer on a construction site.
In pieces from his new album, "Tribal Thunder" (Hightone), Mr.
Dale dipped into mambos and Arab scales, and he performed Juan Tizol's "Caravan" with flair.

Israel Frees Palestinian Leader Held 23 Years
In a gesture to the Palestine Liberation Organization that was seen as a harbinger of a possible mass release of prisoners, Israel today freed the Palestinian prisoner it has held the longest, 23 years.
It was the first release since the agreement on Palestinian autonomy signed last month.
Israeli officials called it a confidence-building measure that could increase support for the accord in the occupied territories.

Schmidt Can Now Extol The Value of Emotion
Mike Schmidt did not express his emotions on the field or get too close to the fans while he played for the Phillies.
But when Schmidt, who is likely to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when he is eligible in 1995, threw out the first pitch before Game 3 tonight, he received a rousing ovation and enthusiastically waved to the fans.
He recognizes the value of emotion for the current Phillies.
"I made things look easy in the field and didn't get emotional," said the former third baseman, who hit 548 homers and had 1,533 runs batted in.
"When I see highlights of myself, I'm a little displeased. I think I got caught up with the pressure to succeed. The 1993 team are guys that fans can relate to. The team is like the city. The fans want to be like the Phillies and rise."

House Kills the Supercollider, And Now It Might Stay Dead
The House pushed a stake through the heart of the $11 billion Superconducting Supercollider program today, voting emphatically, for the second time since June and the third time in 16 months, to reject financing for the vast Texas atom-smasher.
Each time, the Senate has rescued the project, which has already cost $2 billion, from the House attempts to kill it.
But after today's 264-to-159 vote on a crucial procedural vote in the House, its most important advocate in the Senate, J. Bennett Johnston, said the project appeared to be lost.


World Bank Issues Bond in Marks
The World Bank began selling its first global bond issue denominated in German marks yesterday, and officials said demand was very strong.
Kenneth G. Lay, director of the financial operations department at the World Bank, said the lead underwriters for the 3 billion mark ($1.83 billion) 10-year issue, Salomon Brothers and Deutsche Bank, were telling investors that the deal was oversubscribed several times, so they would not get the bonds they had requested.


It's 'Davis Cup, Anyone?' As a Trip to India Looms
The United States Davis Cup team learned yesterday that the same worst-case scenario that spelled disaster for its 1993 squad -- a first-round match in Australia that the top American players refused to fit into their schedules -- has returned for 1994 in the form of a first-round trip to India.
So far, said the brand-new Davis Cup captain, Tom Gullikson, there have been no first-round volunteers for 1994.
"It's going to be a formidable trip, and while I'm certain we have the players to subdue India, the main task is getting people down there and keeping them healthy," said Gullikson, who harbors memories of food poisoning and a unique court surface, cow dung, from his two trips to India in 1977 and 1978 while competing on the circuit.

Trade Center Jury Hears Evidence of Vehicle Parts
A bomb expert testifying in the World Trade Center trial yesterday gave the first account matching vehicle parts found after the explosion to a yellow van the Government claims was rented by one of the defendants.

Ukraine Now Says It May Keep Nuclear Weapons
In a sharp change of tone, President Leonid M. Kravchuk said today that Ukraine may keep some of the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union, and he accused the West of not providing enough financial assistance to dismantle the 176 strategic missiles on Ukrainian territory.
President Kravchuk's statement, that Ukraine may keep 46 SS-24 missiles, came only five days before Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to arrive here for talks in which Ukraine's nuclear weapons will feature high on the agenda.

Mr.
Clinton said that the Rangers, who had been part of the United Nations effort to track down and arrest the Somali leader, Mohammed Farah Aidid, had completed their mission -- though they have not found General Aidid -- and that the 3,600 marines who have arrived offshore would monitor the situation in Somalia.

Not Lenny Dykstra, Mariano Duncan or John Kruk.
That trio continued their superb and consistent attack on Toronto pitching, collecting five of the Phillies' nine hits and reaching base a total of seven times in an 10-3 loss in Game 3 here tonight.

In a meeting on Monday with a delegation from the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group for women with breast cancer, he announced that the Department of Health and Human Services would develop a national action plan for preventing and treating breast cancer.
Mr.
Clinton also said that his Administration would work with advocates for breast cancer patients at a conference in December to develop the plan.
"It is important that that plan be fitted into a larger commitment to the health care of Americans," he said, "to put women's health concerns -- from research to the development and delivery of health care -- on equal footing with men."

Florio's Ratings Slipping in Poll, But He's Ahead
Gov.
Jim Florio's standing with the voters has begun to erode in New Jersey's race for governor, according to the latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll, but he still maintains a commanding lead over Christine Todd Whitman.
With less than two weeks to go before the Nov. 2 election, the poll shows Governor Florio leading Mrs.
Whitman 49 to 34 percent among registered voters, a lead that is wider still among those who said they will definitely vote.
But his performance rating has slipped, his trust rating has slipped and so has his reputation for honesty and integrity.
Nearly two-thirds of the respondents think their taxes would go up if he is re-elected.

Hue Journal; Once Again, a Fiery Suicide Sets Vietnam Aflame
Clutching a small bunch of flowers and a few pieces of fruit that would be his final earthly offering to the Buddha, Dao Quang Ho walked up the mist-shrouded stone steps that lead to one of Vietnam's most hallowed shrines, the Pagoda of the Heavenly Lady.
He also carried with him a box of matches and a small plastic bottle filled with gasoline.
Buddhist monks who were in prayer at the pagoda on that cool, sunny morning in May would later say that they saw Mr.
Ho place the flowers and fruit on three plates, setting one before each of the pagoda's three golden statues of the Buddha.
He then walked a hundred yards to a granite courtyard at the rear of the pagoda, where he doused himself with gasoline before striking a match.


RESULTS PLUS
7-0 Leafs Near Record  The Toronto Maple Leafs, backed once again by the exceptional goaltending of Felix Potvin, beat the visiting Hartford Whalers, 7-2, last night for their seventh victory without a defeat.
A triumph against the Panthers in Miami tomorrow night will give Toronto a share of the National Hockey League record for consecutive victories at the start of a season, shared by the 1934-35 Leafs and the 1975-76 Sabres.
Potvin has allowed only 15 goals in the seven games.
Panthers 2, Kings 2: Kelly Hrudey of the visiting Kings stopped 50 shots by the surprising Panthers, who in turn held Los Angeles scoreless through the final 61 minutes.

"While walking down the city streets, Catherine took great delight in pointing at a person and then loudly exclaiming 'That's a woman!' or 'That's a man!' Then, walking toward her was someone who gave her pause. She announced 'That's a man,' hesitated and then declared, 'That's a woman,' and then changed her mind again and said, 'No, that's a man.' The person in question finally neared, looked down at her and said, 'That's right, honey, a little of both.' "

Universities Scrambling As Investment Incomes Fall Short of Past Levels
Colleges and universities across the country are eliminating jobs or freezing hiring, declaring construction moratoriums and trimming student financial aid because of the declining return on endowments, a source of income that is often second only to tuition.
At Stanford Law School, a student loan program was saved only because three jobs were cut.
At the University of Texas, building maintenance has been cut sharply.
And at the University of Pennsylvania, three departments were closed last week and their professors moved to others.

But Gaston, showing shrewd instincts, benched the American League batting champion and put Molitor in John Olerud's spot at first base.

Books of The Times; Harlem's Face on Its Own Terms
VanDerZee Photographer, 1886-1983 By Deborah Willis-Braithwaite with a biographical essay by Rodger C. Birt Illustrated. 192 pages.
Harry N. Abrams. $39.95.
How does a photographer find his subject?
Or must his subject find him?
When young Alfred Stieglitz came home from Berlin in 1899, he claimed that New York City was photo-resistant.
He had to see the rambunctious vaudevillians Weber and Fields and the great Eleanora Duse in "Camille" before he got it: New York's sights, rhythms, tones and sensations dictated their own rules.
It was up to the photographer to grasp and make use of them.
Young James VanDerZee came to New York from pastoral Lenox, Mass., in 1908, and he came as a waiter, an elevator operator and a musician.
When he finally opened his photography studio in 1917, his subject was Harlem, a city within a city, and its rules were wildly contradictory.
What had first been a haven for upper-class Anglo-Saxons had then become a haven for middle- and working-class Irish, Italians and Jews, and was fast becoming a haven for upper-, middle- and working-class blacks from the South, the West and the Caribbean.

Chicago Learns How Hard It Is to Better Schools
Four years ago, with the fanfare of a high school commencement and the passions of a civil war, the nation's most sweeping experiment in school governance gave broad authority to parents in each of Chicago's 551 public schools.
For the first time, parents could choose the principal, approve budgets and have final say over anything from the books their children read to the color of paint in the halls.

It's certainly not the most difficult composition that the Philadelphia Orchestra has ever performed, but its members were getting ready yesterday to give their rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the fourth game of the World Series in Philadelphia this evening.
The musicians will have a police escort to Veterans Stadium, where they will stand between home plate and the pitcher's mound for the national anthem in what is believed to be the first performance by a symphony orchestra at a World Series game.
They will wear tails, Philadelphia Orchestra sweatshirts and Phillies hats.

Los Angeles Jurors Report Progress Despite Hardships
A juror in the racially charged trial of two black men accused of beating a white truck driver has expressed fears for her safety and that of her family, the forewoman told the judge today.
The word of the juror's fears, which were disclosed in response to a question from the judge, came before the jury cut short its deliberations at midday when one of them fell ill with high blood pressure.
Shortly afterward, a second juror fell ill and was taken to a hospital with an undisclosed ailment.


Lageman to Play Despite Warning of Neck Injury
Jeff Lageman, the Jets defensive end who has complained of numbness in his arms and other discomfort because of a problem with a disk in his neck, will play Sunday against the Buffalo Bills even though a doctor has warned him that he risks serious injury, according to a person close to the situation.
Lageman saw eight spine specialists in New York and Virginia last week in an attempt to determine the severity of the problem.
Seven of those doctors cleared him to play, the person said, but one doctor recommended that Lageman sit out at least six weeks before playing again or risk serious injury.

Review/Television; An Evening for Savoring Classical Music's Details
Impassioned dedication, or just plain bargain hunting?
Public television's relationship with classical music generally falls somewhere between.
There are producers like Jac Venza and John Goberman, who are decidedly fervent, and there are programmers who, always budget conscious, are adept at finding a good deal or acquisition.
In the end, at least occasionally, music lovers win.
Tonight's lineup on PBS begins at 8 with Mr.
Goberman's series, "Live From Lincoln Center," in a celebration of the Chamber Music Society's 25th anniversary.
Mr.
Goberman has long crusaded for the live televising of music, dance and opera events.
This program -- featuring the pianist Andre Watts, the society's first guest artist member -- will open with the premiere of John Corigliano's Fanfare for Brass, and will also include Debussy's Premiere Rhapsodie and Mozart's Clarinet Quintet, with the clarinetist David Shifrin, who is the society's artistic director.


How to Police New York
Crime is always a visceral issue in New York City politics.
That's especially true this year when polls show crime to be a prime concern among voters.
Mayor David Dinkins and his challenger Rudolph Giuliani hold starkly different views on how dangerous the city is and how best to police it.
Mr.
Giuliani presents himself as a hard-nosed cop who'd round up the bad guys he says the Mayor has permitted to flourish in the streets.
Mr.
Dinkins points with pride to the thousands of new police officers he has hired, and to a drop in the most serious and violent crimes despite a popular perception that crime is getting worse.


Washington Talk; Moynihan on Health: Cure Social Ills
Health care hearings at the Senate Finance Committee under Daniel Patrick Moynihan's chairmanship are unlike any other health care hearings.
The talk today was not of how health care alliances would work under President Clinton's plan, nor whether small business could afford to pay premiums.
There were no emotional accounts of children denied treatment, no special pleading for victims of this disease or practitioners of that treatment.

Newsroom, transportation, mailroom, fleet operations, security, finance and prepress employees are eligible for the program.


William Stansbury; Ex-U.S. Official, 84, Led Housing Efforts

The cause was a heart attack, his family said.


Bridge
If your partner opens the bidding and the opponents reach a game, it is reasonable to assume that you can afford to double holding five trumps headed by the ace and a side king.
West made this assumption on the diagramed deal and was disappointed by the result.
The occasion was the New Jersey Swiss teams event in Chatham, N.J., played on Sunday, and North-South were Jane Mason and David Wizentowski, both of Madison, N.J., two members of the winning team.
North and South are close to making three no-trump and that would succeed if the defense leads too many hearts.

ELIZABETH HANFORD DOLE, a smile fixed on her face and her charm at the ready, picked her way around the tangle of lumber and oozing mud, searching for flood victims.

Review/Theater; The Seminal American Musical Is Rebuilt From the Ground Up
Without "Show Boat," there would have been no "Porgy and Bess," no "Oklahoma!," no "West Side Story." Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's 1927 Broadway musical was the first to tell an adult story adapted from a sprawling novel (by Edna Ferber), the first to traffic in serious themes (miscegenation, marital collapse), the first to aspire to the epic size of classic 19th-century American literature.
With its cracker-barrel humor, metaphorical use of the Mississippi River and poignant attempts to bridge the vast American racial divide, "Show Boat" is the Broadway musical's answer to "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." Or would be if Twain had had Florenz Ziegfeld's taste for soaring melodies and lavish spectacle.
In today's American theater, there may be no artist more indebted to "Show Boat" than Harold Prince, whose entire career, from the original production of "West Side Story" to the current "Kiss of the Spider Woman," has been devoted to building on the serious musical that Kern and Hammerstein invented.
So it is no surprise that Mr.
Prince's staging of "Show Boat" here, as the opening attraction of the North York Performing Arts Center, is a seismic event in the American musical theater.
Given a huge budget, an enormous cast in which Broadway stalwarts vastly outnumber local recruits, and a house that resembles the mammoth Gershwin Theater back home, Mr.
Prince has approached the piece as if it were a new work that might have been submitted to him by Stephen Sondheim shortly after their collaboration on "Sweeney Todd." The result is a continuously fascinating display of theatrical wizardry that, largely because of inadequate acting, still falls short of what must be its principal goal: to make "Show Boat" as powerful for contemporary audiences as it was for those of the late 1920's and 30's.


Review/Dance; New Choreography and High Fashion In a United Expression About AIDS

The cause -- raising money for education, care and advocacy in relation to AIDS -- persuaded 18 choreographers to join forces on Monday night at the New York State Theater for an event that featured 17 dance works (most of them premieres) or excerpts, two vocal pieces and a strutting finale led by Tommy Tune.

Bits of Heaven on Toast
THE incomparable bay scallops are with us.
The New York State season opened at the beginning of the month.
Supply dictates the price of these tiny bivalves, no bigger than your thumb, and even though they cost as much as a filet of beef, to aficionados they are far more desirable.
They are so sweet and succulent that it's a mistake to do too much to them.
Ed Gifford, an accomplished amateur cook who has a house in Amagansett, L.I., has taken traditional scallop ingredients and added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, the final fillip that has turned a lovely dish into one quite extraordinary.


Bronco-Raider War Moves to Front Offices
The Raiders and the Broncos have met 66 times and the most recent one, on Monday night, proved that as far as rivalries are concerned in the National Football League, this feud does not take a backseat to any other.
Late in the first half, General Manager John Beake of Denver strode over to Pat Haggerty, the N.F.L. officiating observer, in the Mile High Stadium press box and ripped the on-field officiating crew upside down and inside out.
There was grabbing and holding by the Raiders' offensive linemen and no calls were being made, Beake charged.
He said he was sick and tired of the league's catering to the Raiders' owner, Al Davis.
He told Haggerty that the league could expect a formal complaint first thing Tuesday morning.

But periodically he reappeared at the door to summon one Congressman and then another into the back room.

Wary Draw Puts Kasparov Close to Victory in Match
Whatever happens now, after Gary Kasparov agreed to a draw in Game 19 of his world championship match with Nigel Short yesterday in London, he cannot lose his title.
He has 12 points out of a possible 24 and, under match rules, the incumbent retains his championship in the event of a tie.
That may well be why the Russian was so generous in offering a draw when he had just won a pawn that might have turned out to be decisive.
His strategy may have been to make his status secure first and then play for the $1.43 million winner's share of the $2.55 million purse by winning or drawing Game 20 on Thursday.

Dinkins Campaign to Pay Party Panel for Some Ads
Under pressure from the city's Campaign Finance Board, the Dinkins campaign has agreed to reimburse the State Democratic Committee for more than $226,000 worth of political advertisements that the Giuliani campaign had complained were intended to circumvent spending limits.
The agreement was applauded by advocates of public financing as a sign that the board, created in 1988, was forcefully executing its mission.
In agreeing to pay for the ads, the Dinkins campaign averted possible sanctions or fines from the board.
But the payments are a blow to the Dinkins campaign because they will reduce the amount of money the campaign has to spend in the crucial last days of a tight race, city officials and mayoral aides said.


3 BOSNIA FACTIONS IN PRISONER TRADE
After 18 months of prison camp abuses, the three warring armies in Bosnia began a prisoner exchange today involving more than 6,400 people, most of them civilian men who were seized as hostages, to prevent them becoming combatants in the war, or simply as targets for revenge.
The exchange, organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross, is designed to all but empty a score of prisons and detention centers across this former Yugoslav republic.
If successful, the operation would sharply curtail a pattern of abuses, including summary executions, beatings and near-starvation diets, that has been condemned by international human rights groups.

Review/Film; East German Agitprop
"Strictly Propaganda" offers a virtual-reality-style voyage into a brave new world, a place where housewives tirelessly salvage bricks from bombed-out rubble and children sing sweetly about wanting to join the army some day.
If the effect of such scenes is disorienting, it ought to be, since this documentary consists entirely of excerpts from East German newsreels and educational material.
Promoting everything from sex education for teen-agers to steamer cruises on the Volga, each of these snippets has its own blunt agenda.
"Show us where children are not so well off," a teacher asks a student, spinning a globe.
"Yes! Where capitalism dominates! A good answer."
Using no narration, interruptions or other means of breaking the spell, Wolfgang Kissel has strung together a riveting series of vignettes, each of them intended to sway the audience in what now seem laughably clumsy ways.
Despite the dated, unbecoming light in which they now appear, though, these scenes are ultimately too sad and serious to play like anything out of "Reefer Madness." Spanning 40 years' worth of East German history, "Strictly Propaganda" documents endless deceptions, variously large or insignificant, that add up to a national tragedy.
Mr.
Kissel makes his film all the more disturbing by never stopping to contrast real events with their absurdly sunny, inspirational counterparts on screen.

It was a one-of-a-kind shirt with a clock and "116" on it, the number of days left until the opening of the XVII Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway.
The Norwegian Olympians GRETE WAITZ, a silver-medal winner in the marathon, and STEIN ERIKSEN, a gold- and silver-medal winner in skiing, conducted the auction.
The shirts have been sold primarily in Lillehammer, one a day, to draw attention to the event.
But in the last two weeks the group has sold shirts in Seattle, Chicago and Minot, N.D., where the garment drew a record price of $3,700 at a Scandinavian fair.


States, G.M. Vie on Car Emissions
The General Motors Corporation and the air pollution officials of 12 Northeastern states are maneuvering warily in rival attempts to determine what emission standards will apply to cars sold in the region in the late 1990's.
The state officials, meeting yesterday in Mystic, Conn., took a step toward asking the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to require "low emission vehicles," similar to those mandated by California, in their region, which runs from northern Virginia through Maine.


FINANCE BRIEFS
Debt  *
The Board of Regents of Higher Education of the University of Montana is offering $46.9 million of tax-exempt facilities improvement and refunding revenue bonds initially priced to yield a maximum 5.08 percent for a bond due in 2015 through underwriters led by Smith Barney Shearson.
Serial bonds with shorter maturities yield from 2.30 percent in 1994 to 5 percent in 2010.
Because all the bonds are insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corp., they are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's.

Mike Sherrard has endured so much pain, it's almost as if he expects it.
After breaking his right leg three times in the last six years, he has added a partly dislocated hip to his list of woes.
But it wasn't surprising that when he met the news media today, his spirits were upbeat and there was even a smile on his face.
Sherrard, who is expected to be on crutches for three to six weeks, was asked if he felt like, "Why me again?"

Time Warner Inc. and the Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P. reported yesterday a cash flow before interest and taxes of $726 million for the third quarter, up 8 percent from $675 million in the corresponding period a year ago.
Revenues were $3.7 billion, up from $3.5 billion.
The company reported a loss of $41 million for the quarter before a one-time charge of $70 million as a result of the new income tax law's effect on the company's deferred tax liability and an extraordinary loss on the retirement of debt of $22 million, resulting in a net loss of $133 million.

One Study Too Many?
To the Living Section:  I was bemused by Marian Burros's article about the controversy surrounding the theory that fat intake contributes to breast cancer.
There is apparently strong evidence to suggest such a connection, but two recent studies have been unable to prove it, and so a new one, involving 70,000 women, is under way.
Is this a good way to spend our research dollars?


Philip Morris Earnings Fall, But Marlboro Shows Gains
The cigarette price wars may still be raging, but Philip Morris has gained at least a faint indication that the pricing strategies for Marlboro cigarettes are working.
While third-quarter earnings for the Philip Morris Companies, which were announced yesterday, were 24.8 percent lower from a year ago, Marlboro's share of the market increased.
According to data from the A. C. Nielsen Company, Marlboro's market share edged up 1.4 percent, to 25.7 percent.

For 1988, Citicorp had net income of $1.86 billion, and for the first three quarters of this year it has earned $1.64 billion.

Coalition Opposing Health Plan Is Called Front Group for Insurers
In the latest twist in an intense lobbying campaign over the Clinton Administration's health plan, a group that favors it accused an insurance industry trade group today of deceptively creating a front group to lobby against the plan.
The Families USA Foundation, a consumer group that specializes in health issues, said it had a copy of the health insurance lobby's plans.

Proceeds from the bond sale of $323.2 million in general airport revenue refunding bonds and $319.8 million in general airport second-lien revenue refunding bonds for O'Hare International Airport in Chicago will be used to redeem bonds that were sold when interest rates were higher and to lower debt-service payments.

Review/Fashion; A Mostly Minimal Look in London
While watching the parade of blank minimalist dresses in London, it's difficult not to fantasize that from behind the catwalk, a spiky-haired punk might emerge and paint graffiti across the wall of white slips.
Buyers say they have returned to London this season because of a combination of factors: the re-emergence of punk, the success in Paris of the ornate collections of the British designers Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano and the popularity of Edwardian and dandy looks.
What they found during the three days that made up London fashion week, though, was mostly the same squeaky-clean clothes that have emerged elsewhere.
If you had $:1 for every slip dress shown in London, you might actually be able to afford one.

Customs Overhaul Offered In Move to Aid Trade Pact
The Administration and Congressional supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement today tied a sweeping revision of Federal customs regulations to the proposed pact after failing to resolve a dispute over how to pay for the agreement.
Today's proposed revision of customs regulations was part of an effort by the pact's supporters to mollify transportation industries.
The nation's airlines, cruise lines and trucking companies are vigorously lobbying against an Administration proposal to double customs inspection fees to offset $2.35 billion in tariffs that would be eliminated over five years under the agreement.

BID TO LIMIT TERMS CAN BE ON BALLOT IN NEW YORK CITY
New York State's Court of Appeals ordered New York City yesterday to let voters on Election Day decide whether to limit the mayor, members of the City Council and other municipal officeholders to two consecutive four-year terms.
The ruling was a defeat for the city's political establishment, led by Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone.
They had been fighting for months to keep the term-limit referendum off the ballot through administrative and legal measures.

For 'Deny Me' Decade, The Right Cookie
WHEN the world was young, babies teethed on zwieback.
Now, people dip a far more sophisticated version of these biscuits in vin santo or strong black coffee and call them biscotti.
Instead of cutting teeth, they're the cutting edge.
Biscotti, a generic term in Italian for all kinds of cookies, has a more specific meaning to Americans: biscotti are twice-baked cookies, elongated half-moons in shape, that are designed for dunking.
Because biscotti are traditionally a pretty abstemious-looking sweet, they seemed the perfect choice for the puritanical 1990's, when 16-ounce porterhouse steaks have been replaced by 3 ounces of chicken hidden in a sea of vegetables and pasta.

Hentgen At Home On Road
All it took was a one-way plane ticket.
All Pat Hentgen needed to rebound from a forgettable pitching performance was a timely journey across the border.
Once Hentgen leaves Canada and leaves the Skydome, he is a daunting pitcher.
Even in the World Series.
The pitcher who could exchange memorable road stories with Charles Kuralt created another wonderful baseball tale tonight with a superb game in his first visit to Veterans Stadium, a 10-3 Blue Jays victory over the Phillies in Game 3 of the series.
Once they boarded their charter flight in Toronto Sunday, the Jays probably knew that Hentgen would produce.
He did.


Yanks Demote Monteleone
The Yankees have demoted relief pitcher Rich Monteleone outright to Class AAA Columbus, where he can either accept the move or declare himself a minor league free agent.

60-Minute Gourmet
WHEN I was a fledgling cook in Paris, rack of lamb, served on the bone or boneless, was one of the most popular dishes among the high-society crowd.
I could never add up all the racks of lamb I trimmed and deboned in those years, and as a result I can practically do it in my sleep.
I never lost my taste for lamb, though, and the recipe here is one of my favorites.
Whenever you are coating a piece of meat or fish, it is best to make your own bread crumbs, seasoned to taste, rather than relying on the store-bought version.
It is so easy, too.


Personal Health; Struggling for peace in the war against psoriasis.
LIVING with a chronic health problem is never easy.
The emotional difficulties of dealing with an incurable ailment are compounded when instead of eliciting compassion the disorder touches off feelings of revulsion, not just among casual acquaintances but often in the patients themselves.
For those who suffer from psoriasis, a chronic, incurable skin disorder that is rarely life-threatening and only sometimes physically disabling, the emotional impact can nonetheless be devastating.
In a poll taken recently among the more than 250 people attending the annual meeting of the National Psoriasis Foundation, 84 percent said that psoriasis had a negative effect on their moods, 43 percent said it adversely affected their social lives and 16 percent reported that it interfered with their work.

Topics of The Times; Let There Be Light
In a welcome reversal, the White House has announced that future appearances by President Clinton at major political fund-raising dinners will be open to the press -- the same sound policy followed by Presidents Reagan and Bush.
The move responds to criticism of the press lockout imposed by the White House when Mr.
Clinton mingled with lobbyists and fat cats at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's recent $1,500-a-head fund-raising dinner.
This was an awkward stance for an Administration supposedly committed to open government.


Antioch's Policy on Sex Is Humanizing; Society's Unbounded Id
To the Editor:
" 'Ask First' at Antioch" (editorial, Oct. 11) fails to identify this latest legislative experiment as part of a broad social trend.
Our society is beset by ever more impulsive behavior, unbounded by the ordinary limits of conscience.
The inevitable reaction is to attempt to restore civility to human interactions by enacting more and more rules.
Society's id and, in response, its superego grow by leaps and bounds.
In the process a healthy ego gets squeezed out.
Unfortunately, legislation cannot substitute for human decency.
It will not save us.

Wine Talk
WITH the peak wine-buying season coming up in the next few months, the wine industry in the United States shifts into high gear in October, with everyone from winery presidents to retailers asking the same question: will wine sales this year surpass those of 1992, the best year for sales since 1985?
The consensus is that, with the recession receding, 1993 should be slightly better than 1992.


FOOD NOTES
Meat Safety
Many labels on ground beef now carry information on safe handling and cooking procedures.
Not every package has the information, because there have been some last-minute court challenges to the Department of Agriculture's new rules on labeling.
But many labels had already been added in anticipation of the rules.
The guidelines, one of which indicates that ground meat should be cooked to 160 degrees, are meant to reduce the incidence of food-borne illness.
In many stores, retailers are also providing brochures suggesting that whole pieces of meat, like roasts, be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 to 170 degrees, except pork, which should be cooked to at least 160 degrees.
Poultry should be cooked to 165 to 180 degrees.

7,000 Drug Jobs to Be Eliminated
Amid growing pressure to restrain health care costs, three large drug makers announced plans yesterday to cut 7,000 employees over the next three years, adding to tens of thousands of pharmaceutical-industry jobs eliminated in recent months.
Many of those jobs will be lost in New York and New Jersey, where large multinational drug companies maintain headquarters, research laboratories or factories.
But the three companies, Pfizer, American Cyanamid and Upjohn, declined to say how the cuts would be distributed across their worldwide operations until they tell the workers affected.


A Bigger Starks Aims for Bigger Things
Last season was a breakthrough for John Starks, who along with Patrick Ewing was instrumental in leading the Knicks to the Eastern Conference finals against Chicago.
His rousing dunk put the cap on a Game 2 victory that left his team just two games away from the N.B.A. finals.
But the Knicks never won those two games, and one reason was the play of Starks, who seemed worn down by the long season and by the man he was assigned to guard: Michael Jordan.

The European report said in January said Muslim women were raped by Serbian soldiers as part of their campaign of "ethnic cleansing" in the civil war.

At Issue: Hold a Baby or Hold That Line?
In a head-on collision between the family values of today's sensitive man and the macho work ethic of pro football, a citywide furor unfolded over the Houston Oilers' threat to discipline a player who missed a game last Sunday because he stayed with his wife for the birth of their first child the previous evening.
Callers jammed radio talk shows here to vent their views about the team's contention that David Williams, the starting offensive right tackle, should have tried harder to join the club for its game against the New England Patriots in Foxboro, Mass.
The vast majority of callers supported Williams, and the Oilers, apparently sensing a public-relations disaster in the making, had appeared today to be backing off their threat to dock Williams $125,000 and possibly suspend him for missing the game.
But tonight, the team announced that it was withholding Williams's pay for the game.
It did not make reference to any further disciplinary action.

PARENT &amp; CHILD
FOR many high school seniors, this is the semester for filling out college applications, perusing course catalogues and glossy brochures, and watching promotional videotapes.
It is a daunting and emotionally charged task for both the students and their parents.
It is best begun with some introspection.
"The first step in evaluating a college is to evaluate yourself," said Carl W. Bewig, the director of college counseling at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.
He suggested that students begin by thinking about their strengths and weaknesses, the kinds of learning environments in which they do their best work, and the types of people with whom they like to associate.
"The biggest mistake students can make is not being honest with themselves about who they are," Mr.
Bewig added.

Election Board Fines Dinkins Over Spending
The New York City Campaign Finance Board fined the Dinkins campaign $320,000 last night for spending more than the legal limit during the Democratic Primary.
The ruling's impact on Mayor David N. Dinkins's spending in the final two weeks of the election is unclear.
It will not affect the $4 million he is allowed to spend for the election but may force his campaign to raise more money to compensate for the fine.
It also means his campaign will not receive any more public funds while it appeals the decision in state court, city and campaign officials said.

Because CUNY has a much larger proportion of minority students, the suit argues, the state is engaging in racial discrimination.

Dole Concedes to Clinton in Fight Over Right to Send Troops to Haiti
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, backed off today from a proposal to restrict President Clinton's military options in Haiti and agreed to downgrade it to a nonbinding "sense of the Senate" resolution.
The watered down resolution, which even had White House support and was expected to pass easily, states simply that Congress should authorize in advance any United States military operation in Haiti.
But it upholds the President's broad foreign policy prerogatives as Commander in Chief to send in American troops if he deems that it justified by national security interests or that the safety of Americans living in Haiti is at stake.
Dole Effort Doomed to Defeat
The Kansas Republican's retreat came as he realized that his effort to restrict the President's authority to deploy American forces would go down to defeat.
Support for the proposal collapsed even among Republicans, as a consensus emerged on both sides that Congress was attempting to overstretch its authority in foreign policy.

Pop and Jazz in Review
Javon Jackson  Village Vanguard 178 Seventh Avenue South (at 11th Street) Greenwich Village Through Sunday
Javon Jackson, a young tenor saxophonist steeped in jazz classicism, has brought to the Village Vanguard a quintet that plays traditional ballads, blues and standards, and proves that the pleasure of improvisation doesn't necessarily have anything to do with innovation.
Mr.
Jackson has done something special: he has put together a quintet that mixes younger players, the pianist Jacky Terrasson and the bassist Chris Thomas, with veterans, Curtis Fuller on trombone and Louis Hayes on drums.
The result is a cross-generational band that stokes some heat from the first tune of the night.

Leetch Is the Latest Ranger to Feel the Wrath of Keenan
No one expected that Brian Leetch would be a problem.
He was supposed to be a savior, a player whose absence last season because of injuries could explain much of the Rangers' dreadful downfall.
Instead, he has become the latest -- and most visible -- inhabitant of Coach Mike Keenan's doghouse.
Leetch may be one of the top defensemen in the National Hockey League.
He may have been the Norris Trophy winner two seasons ago.
He is also spending a lot of time on the bench.

Will a Realignment Be Good for the Game?
The Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies played Game 4 of the World Series last night.
Was it the last game the players would play with integrity?
It might be, major league baseball officials and owners believe, if the players received money for the rest of the games.
As long as the players play for nothing past Game 4, officials and owners have no fear about the legitimacy of any World Series games.
Players' post-season shares have always come from the net gate receipts of the first four games of a series, whether it be the league series or the World Series.
That way, they have no financial incentive to extend a series.

The Turning of the Leaves Puts Senses at Their Mercy
I JUST wanted an excuse to drive up to Ithaca, N.Y., because a friend had told me it was my kind of place: intellectuals and cows all mixed up together.
So I decided to go take a look at the fall colors and talk to a few tree lovers at Cornell University about why the leaves change from green to gold to red.
But the conversation kept drifting away from chlorophyll and anthocyanins into memory.
"My grandfather was actually a forester for the extension service here," said Ed Cope, a taxonomist who spends most of his days on the fourth floor of the agriculture school's library, in a place called the Bailey Hortorium.
"His name was Joshua A. Cope, and he introduced the Scotch pine as a Christmas tree."

It seemed that half the city was at the frenetic opening of the Harley-Davidson Cafe on Tuesday evening, clogging the area around Avenue of the Americas and West 56th street with motorcycles, partygoers and onlookers.

Review/Television; A 'Cheers' Spinoff, Set in Seattle
One guy is a bit of a slob, happy to plop into his vibrating Barcalounger with a can of beer; the other is a finicky esthete, partial to fine wines and Eames chairs.
Think Oscar and Felix in "The Odd Couple." The older one is working-class gruff; the younger upwardly-mobile sarcastic.
Think Archie and Meathead in "All in the Family." "Frasier," Thursdays at 9:30 on NBC, is not the season's most original concept, but it's one of the few new series likely to survive.
And deservedly, not just because it follows "Seinfeld."
Played with finely tuned pomposity by Kelsey Grammer, Frasier Crane, psychiatrist, is of course the character originally created for "Cheers." "Frasier" is the spinoff, developed by David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee, the team that also lists "Wings" among its post-"Cheers" credits.

In 2 Towns, Main Street Fights Off Wal-Mart
It has been a tough autumn for Wal-Mart Stores.
An Arkansas judge has found the giant retailer guilty of selling merchandise below cost in an effort to drive local competitors out of business.
And now two Massachusetts towns have rebuffed Wal-Mart's efforts to open stores in their areas.
A Stop Wal-Mart Committee in Westford, a town of 17,000 people about 20 miles northwest of Boston, persuadedthe company last month to drop its plans to build a new store there.
And a group called We're Against the Wal in Greenfield, a Connecticut River town 90 miles west of Boston with a population of about 19,000, succeeded in having a referendum held on Tuesday to decide whether Wal-Mart should be allowed to build a 121,267-square-foot store on the outskirts of town.

"I have to say I don't believe we can sustain the position beyond next June," he said, "unless we see continued improvement, improvements in the human rights field by the Chinese, as well reforms in connection with trade practices and progress in the non-proliferation front." Mr.
Christopher's comments came in a speech at the State Department to senior business executives.


American Air's Parent Shows Upturn in Profits
Investors, whose hopes for a strong rebound in the airline industry have risen and been dashed at various times in recent months, saw a third-quarter earnings report from the AMR Corporation that suggested simply that a modest recovery was under way.
The parent of American Airlines, whose stock is considered a bellwether for the industry, reported earnings of $118 million, compared with a loss of $100 million for the quarter a year earlier.
The results -- AMR's largest profit since the second quarter of 1990 -- were in line with analysts' expectations.
The company edged into profitability in the second quarter of this year, earning $47 million after losing $935 million in 1992.

Her mezzo-soprano is in excellent form, dead on through the whole range, and she fills out her flippant characterization with a host of telling details.
This is not the most wild or dark-spirited Carmen ever, but no one should complain.

President Clinton had been hoping that the group, the National Association of Manufacturers, which represents 12,000 companies, would help convince the business world that his proposal was good for American corporations.
Mr.
Clinton contends that the proposal would produce a windfall for some large companies and would help them control health costs.

Sherrard Hospitalized for Clot
Routine tests yesterday revealed a blood clot in the hip of Giants wide receiver Mike Sherrard, and though the clot could have spread to either his heart, lungs or brain, the early detection prevented it from doing so.
Sherrard was admitted last night to the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, where he will be monitored for the next several days.
He was expected to be released by the end of the week.
Giants officials and Sherrard's agent, Leigh Steinberg, confirmed Sherrard's admittance to the hospital.
Sherrard, 30 years old, suffered a partial dislocation of the left hip on Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles after jolting it at the end of a 51-yard pass play.


Review/Theater: Pterodactyls; Mining the Humor From the Decline of a Class
Mom drinks, Dad is a lying adulterer, Junior has AIDS and Sis -- well, she's truly a mess, a pill-popping semi-amnesiac.
So, really, what else is new?
But as the young playwright Nicky Silver can testify, there's still plenty of dramatic life left in these stereotypes if the comic proportions are right.
His grimly witty play "Pterodactyls" recycles all the cliches of the unraveling all-American family and scales them up to the point that they become poignantly grotesque symbols of a species on the verge of extinction.

The Mayoral Campaign -- At Issue: Health Care; New York's Health Challenge
New York City's next mayor will confront alarming rates of infant mortality, tuberculosis and AIDS.
And he will need to re-invigorate public hospitals and clinics that are understaffed and underfinanced.
It will be a daunting challenge when the city must cut its budget.
Mayor David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal challenger, offer health care proposals that read like pages out of the same hymnal.
Both advocate neighborhood clinics, health maintenance organizations, preventive care and turning city medical facilities over to nonprofit groups.
The difference between the two is that Mayor Dinkins can also be judged by his deeds.
After a shaky start -- and up against the need to make large budget cuts -- Mr.
Dinkins has launched innovative programs to improve the health care of the city's poorest families.
The health effort may be his strongest program.

DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. (N)
The Digital Equipment Corporation reported an $83 million first-quarter loss yesterday that was worse than what most analysts had expected.
The loss was softened by a one-time $20 million benefit from a change in accounting for taxes.
The loss was still a sharp improvement from the comparable quarter a year earlier, when the company reported a loss of $261 million.
But Digital had a 9 percent decline in revenues from a year ago.
The company attributed the drop in revenues to a worse-than-expected performance in Europe and foreign currency fluctuations.

Neither Tony Campbell (bursitis left elbow) nor Anthony Mason (sore left shoulder) played for the Knicks.
Rolando Blackman did not play, as Knicks Coach Pat Riley elected to take a long look at Davis.

Report Finds Shelter System Worsening
New York City's shelters for the homeless deteriorated in 1993 to their worst condition since 1986, a study to be released today has found.
Despite a new city plan for homeless families and a drop in the number of families seeking shelter for the first time, the report found that homeless centers became even more overloaded than they were a year ago, when a judge held four members of Mayor David N. Dinkins's adminstration in contempt of court for failing to shelter homeless families promptly.


Lutherans Asked to Decide On Blessing of Gay Unions
After four years of study, a group from the nation's largest Lutheran body has proposed a wide-ranging statement on sexuality, opening the way for the church to bless any relationship based on a loving, permanent commitment -- heterosexual or homosexual.

Instead, it asks the 5.6 million Lutherans, who will be deciding the church's position over the next two years, to consider whether the church should recommend lifelong abstinence for homosexuals, tolerate homosexuality or affirmatively bless unions between people of the same sex.

It comes after a series of municipal bond scandals helped push big Wall Street underwriters this week to adopt a voluntary ban on contributions made to win municipal bond business.

At Flashpoint of Rioting, Now Banality Is Jarring
Nothing very remarkable happened today at the infamous corner of Florence and Normandie Avenues in South-Central Los Angeles.
The regulars came to get their chili dogs at Art's Famous Chili Dogs ("Since 1933"), neighborhood women got their hair done at Goldie's Beauty Salon, and all day long photographers and reporters came.
It was difficult to tell that this was the flashpoint, the epicenter where years of racial resentments exploded into the deadly disorders that rocked Los Angeles last year.
It was difficult, under a warm hazy sun, to visualize the terror of Reginald O. Denny and other white and Asian drivers who were pulled out of their vehicles that day and brutalized.


CHRONICLE
The novelist STEPHEN KING was initially invited to speak at a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington on Halloween.
But the author of "Carrie," "The Shining" and other suspense and horror novels opted for the more benign date of Oct. 19, explaining that he did not want to be "stereotyped."
Not that he is superstitious, but he did tell the audience of 200 club members and guests on Tuesday: "I couldn't believe it when I arrived here to discover that we are on the 13th floor. They don't even joke around about it by calling the 13th floor the 14th floor. The elevator takes you right to the 13th floor. I have a thing about that."

Review/Music; Of Rachmaninoff And the Dead: Russian Musings
The awkwardly named International Association of Sergei Rachmaninoff presented a concert of its namesake's music at Carnegie Hall on Monday evening.
The program commemorated the 50th anniversary of the composer's death in March 1943, and death was its thematic obsession.
The opening work, "The Isle of the Dead," describes the mythical Charon ferrying dead souls across the Styx.
It quotes the "Dies Irae" -- the plainchant for the dead -- which also figures prominently in the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.
The chant is not quoted in "The Miserly Knight," a one-act opera that was given its American premiere, but the title character drops dead as the final chords are sounded.

AS the family archivist and proud son, Paul Robeson Jr., is dedicated to preserving his father's place in history, particularly for younger generations who might not know that Paul Robeson was an internationally acclaimed singer-actor and black radical who crusaded for human rights long before there was a civil-rights movement.

Robeson is publicly presenting his own views as an advocate of African-American culture and economic justice.


Fervor Aside, Japanese Are Facing Cup Failure
For the last year, the Japanese have embraced soccer with the same kind of single-minded enthusiasm they once reserved for capitalism.
Inspired by the creation of the 10-team professional J-League this spring, Japanese have snapped up souvenirs, transformed a little-known striker nicknamed Kazu into a national hero and, in one overenthusiastic instance, attempted to solve the riddle of a sold-out stadium by counterfeiting tickets.

Schilling went to the mound with a batch of information and promptly allowed six earned runs in six and a third innings in an 8-5 loss.
So much for the videotapes.
"I had too many plans," Schilling said.
"I made some plans to go after their hitters. Maybe I went after them too much."

Empress Michiko, a cosmopolitan monarch who has been the subject of some surprisingly harsh criticism recently for her modern ways, collapsed this morning in what some doctors speculated might have been a stroke minutes before she was to go to a 59th birthday party.
The Imperial Household Agency, which zealously shields the imperial family from public view, provided only sketchy information about the condition of the Empress.
This evening, the agency said that the Empress was walking and eating normally after regaining consciousness and spending much of the day in bed, but that her speech remained impaired.

Review/Music; Mourning and Mending: Reflections on War
Benjamin Britten's "War Requiem" is one of 20th-century music's rare public works.
In the vastness of its scale, in the breadth of its humanitarian aims and in the simplicity of its language, this is music intended to move large numbers of listeners at first hearing and at no sacrifice of original intentions to mass appeal.
The "War Requiem" marked the reopening of Coventry Cathedral in 1961, and the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch, played it eloquently at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night.
Destroyed by German bombs, the cathedral had been rebuilt.
Britten's manipulation of the requiem format -- in which the generalized mourning of the Latin liturgy is alternated with the factual horrors of Wilfred Owen's war poems -- constituted a mending process of its own, a backward look at war that sighs with deep regret and offers bruised, tentative hopes for the future.

The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company said yesterday that sales had slipped in its main pharmaceutical, consumer products and infant formula businesses in the third quarter.
But by aggressively squeezing costs, the company produced a 6.3 percent gain in after-tax profits from continuing operations.
Richard L. Gelb, the chairman and chief executive of the New York-based company, said the poor sales showings largely resulted from comparison with "very strong" pharmaceutical sales in the third quarter of 1992, as well as unfavorable foreign currency rates and tighter government cost controls in Europe.

Rabbis Criticize Dinkins For Passing Up Forum
The president of the 800-member New York Board of Rabbis, in the past staunch supporters of Mayor David N. Dinkins, criticized the Mayor yesterday for turning down an invitation to appear at a forum with Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The board's president, Rabbi Jeremiah Wohlberg, said the Mayor's campaign had pressed the board to include the Conservative Party candidate, George Marlin, in their forum and had finally "pleaded the presence of Vice President Al Gore" in declining the invitation to speak.

Ameritech still owns about 24.9 percent of Telecom's outstanding shares.


Blowing Up the Dunes
To The Home Section:
To make a spectacle of the demolition of the Dunes Hotel ("In the City of Change, Is 'Las Vegas Landmark' an Oxymoron?" Oct. 7) reminds me of a Jonathan Winters monologue of some 20 years ago: "And now we have on Stage One . . . the greatest show on Earth, the A-bomb!" The monologue was a satire of Las Vegas extravaganzas, but the blowing up of the Dunes seems dead serious.

Gaston, Fregosi Ask: Who'll Stop the Rain? Not Their Pitchers
The scoring rules don't exactly provide for the dreadful circumstances that developed in the fourth game of the World Series tonight, but a slight improvisation could have determined that no pitcher in the game should have been credited with the victory.
"Do not credit a victory to a relief pitcher who is ineffective in a brief appearance," rule 10.19 (c) (4) reads in part.
For the most part tonight, that one description fit all, relievers and starters.


Playing on Uncertainties About the Health Plan
SPONSOR: The Coalition for Health Insurance Choices, financed by the Health Insurance Association fo America.
ON THE SCREEN: A couple, Harry and Louise, is sitting over breakfast.
He is reading a newspaper, she a published version of the President's health care plan.
The camera angle changes, and we see the health care plan from above as Louise underlines a passage with a yellow marking pen.
At the end of the ad, an 800 number appears along with a tag identifying the sponsors.
THE SCRIPT: Harry: "I'm glad the President's doing something about health care reform."....Louise: "He's right. We need it."...
Harry: "Some of these details--"...
Louise: "Like a national limit on health care?"...
Harry: "Really." ...Louise: "The government caps how much the country can spend on all health care and says, 'That's it!"'...Harry: "So what if our health plan runs out of money?"...Louise: "There's got to be a better way." ACCURACY: The implication of the ad is that under the President's plan, only a certain amount of money can be spent on health care, and after that, patients will be out of luck.
The President has proposed a complicated set of regulations to limit the rate in increase in health care spending to the inflation rate.
Among other things, these regulations would limit the amount that health insurance premiums could rise each year.
Many health care providers are concerned that the limits would adversely affect the quality of care and that some health care plans might actually run out of money.
The President's proposal also calls for each state to set up contingency funds to bail out insolvent plans.
SCORECARD: The ad purports to reflect the concerns of average citizens, and it effectively appeals to a generalized sense that the Clinton Administration's plan doesn't quite add up.
But the ad has an melodramatic, overacted quality that may make viewers suspicious.
And once they learn the ad is sponsored by the insurance industry, these suspicions are only likely to increase.

Connecticut Store Owner Sentenced in Tax Fraud
Stew Leonard Sr., whose circuslike Connecticut dairy stores made him a folk hero of American retailing, was sentenced today to more than four years in prison and fined $947,000 for his role in a sophisticated tax-fraud scheme.
The prison sentence, five months shy of the maximum recommended by Federal guidelines, cemented a remarkable fall for Mr.
Leonard, whose reputation was shattered this summer when he and three executives pleaded guilty to skimming more than $17 million in sales from the family's Norwalk store.

It was a typical hard sell, but the pitch by the Italian commercial representative was no exaggeration .


Militant Japanese Rightist Kills Himself
In a chilling echo of Japan's violent political past, a prominent far-right militant shot himself to death during a meeting with the president of a newspaper that had ridiculed his nationalist political movement in its editorial cartoons.
The rightist, Shusuke Nomura, 58, shot himself with a pair of pistols at the end of an hourlong meeting with executives of the daily Asahi Shimbun at the newspaper's headquarters in Tokyo.
While the meeting was taking place, Asahi executives were across town making a carefully negotiated apology to Mr.
Nomura's supporters, including at least one member of Parliament, for offending his small splinter party in its coverage of an election campaign last year.

Wet. Sloppy. Gray. Must Be Aqueduct.
New York switched its racing from Belmont Park to Aqueduct yesterday, and it was wet, it was sloppy, it was gray and it was symbolic of all the things New York would like to cure in winter racing.
It was also almost empty, with only 6,408 customers braving the rain.
And their discomfort was deepened when glitches in the tote board caused a delay of 24 minutes in starting the ninth race so the betting pools could be straightened out.
The track estimated that the disruption had cost it about $125,000 in unplaced bets and about $25,000 in offtrack bets.

It was the first meeting in a pro game between the nine-time National Hockey League most valuable player and the younger Gretzky, a rookie playing in only his second N.H.L. game.

A Shadow In Germany: A special report.; Germans Begin to Recognize Danger in Neo-Nazis' Surge
Kurt Muller, a retired nurseryman with a brown toupee and a distinctive pair of metal-frame glasses, has served time in prison for expressing virulent Nazi views.
But for years his neighbors in this Rhineland state capital were inclined to dismiss him as a harmless and irrelevant nuisance.
Recently that attitude has changed.
When Mr.
Muller, 63, and his wife, Ursula, 59, tried to enter the Dorfschanke restaurant a few blocks away from their house in Gonsenheim the other day, the bartender blocked the door.
"You can't come in here," he told the couple.
"If I let you in, all my other customers will boycott the place."

Reviving the Roar of an Antic Era
The frenzy and the innovation of the Roaring Twenties -- and the Marx Brothers -- were explored this weekend at the annual Classics in Context Festival at the Actors Theater of Louisville.
During three days of plays, films, lectures and colloquies, more than 100 theater professionals and academics sampled and analyzed the performing arts of the period, a decade bookended by two cataclysmic events: World War I and the Great Depression.
One panelist compared American theater in the 20's to the stock market, "a joy ride" destined to crash.
In her keynote speech, the director Anne Bogart commented on the astonishing productivity of Broadway, where in 1927 alone there were 268 openings covered by critics from the 24 New York City daily newspapers.
While recognizing the contribution of musical theater, she was quick to add that it was paralleled by experimentation in drama: Eugene O'Neill and Sophie Treadwell shared a spotlight with Rodgers and Hart.
At the same time, Martha Graham and others were revolutionizing dance and jazz was giving its name to an age.

"YOUR outfit will be gray when you leave here," warned Augustine Jochec (pronounced JOE-check), as a visitor settled in at Glass Restorations, his Manhattan repair shop.
Good glass is as clear as, well, crystal, but repairing it can be a messy business requiring grinding wheels, pumice and other dust-inducing materials.
Yet, when the dust settles, mended glass often looks almost as good as new.
Chips can be ground out, weblike cracks can be planed and broken bits can be attached with colorless adhesives.

Jochec said, holding a Steuben dish with a subtle line where a curlicue had been reattached.

Philips and Agency Agree to Split
The Philips Consumer Electronics Company in Knoxville, Tenn., and its agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates in New York, said yesterday that after seven years, they had mutually decided to part company, citing "operational difficulties."

The company, an American unit of the Dutch consumer electronics giant Philips Electronics N.V., markets products under brands including Magnavox.
Jon Kasle, a spokesman for Philips, would not elaborate on the reason for the split.
He praised the agency, noting that under Backer Spielvogel, which produced campaigns for Magnavox starring the Smothers Brothers and the comedian John Cleese, sales grew.

White House Issues An Order to Bolster Recycling of Paper
After months of wrangling between environmental groups and the paper industry, the Clinton Administration yesterday issued an executive order requiring Federal agencies and the military to buy paper made from at least 20 percent recycled fiber by the end of next year and 30 percent by the end of 1998.
Although the Federal Government buys less than 2 percent of the 22 million tons of printing and writing paper produced in this country each year, the order is expected to have a more widespread impact by serving as a model for procurement by state and local governments.
Used-Paper Market Weak
One national environmental group that had lobbied aggressively for the Federal order, the Natural Resources Defense Council, announced yesterday that it was beginning "a campaign for state and local recycled paper purchases to follow suit."

Gov.
Jim Florio kicked off the final two weeks of his re-election campaign yesterday from the same friendly environs where Bill Clinton began and ended his bid for the presidency last year.
And for good measure, Mr.
Florio had Hillary Rodham Clinton at his side.
After a series of ostensibly nonpolitical visits to New Jersey in the last six weeks from the likes of President Clinton and several of his senior Cabinet members, Mrs.
Clinton left no doubt at a Democratic Party rally in Cherry Hill yesterday that she was there for partisan purposes.

A Wary Reply to South Africa's Call
Sprung from its economic shackles after more than a decade of sanctions, South Africa is seeking foreign investment to help cushion its transition to a multiracial democracy.
But many American companies are so leery of the country's volatile politics that they are staying away and, it now appears, will not play a major role in shaping the start of this new era.
Despite recent pleas from leaders like President F. W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, who last week shared the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the apartheid state, many of these companies say they face a host of obstacles to doing business in South Africa.
And some point out that they are wary of entering the country not only because of conditions there, but also because of concerns about the reaction in the United States to such moves.

The settlement of securities fraud charges involving the firm's sales of limited partnerships will be the largest ever by a retail brokerage firm for violating the law in its dealings with individual investors.

Fathers Who Want Time Off for Families Face Uphill Battle
DAVID WILLIAMS missed work on Sunday to stay with his wife after the birth of their first child, and that will cost him $111,111.
The response of his employer, the Houston Oilers, reflects a broader social problem: Is there really any support for a man who wants to be a New Dad?
According to most experts on fatherhood and employers' family policies, the Houston Oilers were out of step in one sense: Most employers now allow men some time off, at least a day or two, to be with their wives when they give birth to a child.


Review/Music; A Pop Master Delivers A Parade of Hits From Before Rock
Near the end of Tony Bennett's opening-night concert at the Long acre Theater on Tuesday, the singer acknowledged that his career has reached a golden moment late in the game by singing a medley of "Autumn Leaves" and "Indian Summer."
For Mr.
Bennett, who recently turned 67, these are indeed balmy days.
A performer who was dismissed as a relic by the generation that had turned its back on pre-rock pop music, he has seen his reputation soar over the last decade, as that generation has discovered the riches of the past.
Among those still living who are considered custodians of the pre-rock canon, Mr.
Bennett now ranks just under Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald in reputation.
And in his show, "Steppin' Out on Broadway," which plays through Saturday at the Longacre (220 West 48th Street, Manhattan), he shows how richly he deserves that status.

It was the bluntest Government condemnation of broadcast violence since the Surgeon General linked television to aggressive behavior 21 years ago.
And it drew anguished protests of innocence from some of the industry's most visible executives.

But try the converse experiment with most introductory economics texts, and you might be left with the idea that the world was created somewhere around 1950.
Movers and shakers in economics, it seems, just aren't accustomed to pondering the past.

Editorial Notebook; The War of the Flags
An early test of the startling detente between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization will involve a combustible swatch of cloth.
Since 1967, thousands of Palestinians have been chased and jailed in a deadly game of "capture the flag" in which youngsters challenge Israeli rule by hoisting the outlawed P.L.O. banner.
Flying that flag in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip may soon be no more unthinkable than, say, Yasir Arafat shaking the hand of Yitzhak Rabin.
Yet the significance of that flag is too little known.
The passion it ignites is rooted in a common tradition that divides Israelis and Palestinians -- a circumstance rarely acknowledged by either.

Acquittal and Deadlock End The Trial of 2 in Riot Beating
After three days of deadlock, a jury today acquitted Damian M. Williams of attempting to murder a white truck driver during last year's riot, a verdict that left the city exhausted and torn by racial and social divisions.
The jury remained undecided on one count of assault against the second defendant, Henry K. Watson, after convicting him on Monday of one misdemeanor assault charge.
Judge John W. Ouderkirk of Los Angeles County Superior Court immediately declared a mistrial on the deadlocked charge and released Mr.
Watson on his own recognizance in consideration of the time he had already served in jail.

Meshell Ndegeocello  The Supper Club
Meshell Ndegeocello likes all kinds of grooves: easy jazz vamps, thumb-popping funk, chunky hip-hop, slow-motion reggae.
And she doesn't like to keep them apart.
On Monday night at the Supper Club, Ms.
Ndegeocello and her band, the Watermelon Philosophy, turned songs from her debut album, "Plantation Lullabies" (Maverick/Sire/Reprise), into rhythm rambles, strut dissolving into swing, float shifting to stomp.
Her vocals are just as mutable, from recitation to rap to melody, in a low voice reminiscent of Joan Armatrading's.
Ms.
Ndegeocello got her start as a bass player in Washington go-go bands, and with or without a bass in her hands her syncopations are supple and sure.


New Proposal From Cuomo For Yankees
A $150 million plan to keep the Yankees in the Bronx through 2032 will be offered in the next few days to George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo said yesterday.
The new offer follows a far less detailed project proposed by the Governor last month, which offered the Yankee owner a 50,000-seat stadium on Manhattan's West Side at a cost of $530 million.
That proposal was quickly opposed by city officials and community leaders as too extravagant and impractical given the traffic congestion in the area.

'You Don't Have to Be a Genius' to See What Happened
The hot television lights bore down on Lenny Dykstra and caused him to squint.
The probing questions about what he described as the toughest loss of his career caused him to remember over and over a game he desperately wanted to forget.
With tobacco juice on his lips and pain in those squinty, hurting eyes, Dykstra tried to explain how a night that could have been the most magical of his baseball life had turned so quickly and so horribly.
Dykstra had belted two homers and scored four runs and the Phillies had a five-run lead against Toronto going into the eighth inning.
Then everything crumbled around them.

Since the Somali civil war began three years ago, the Ala Aamin restaurant has moved about 20 times.
Most recently, in June, when United Nations bombing attacks forced it out of the neighborhood controlled by Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid, it moved about half a mile down Mogadishu's main avenue.
At first it was only a handful of wooden chairs clustered on the dirt sidewalk.
But now the sandy floors and two trees are boxed in by cement walls protruding into the road, and the Ala Aamin is a gathering ground for supporters of General Aidid and his party, the Somali National Alliance, as well as merchants, clan elders and war-hardened teen-age militia fighters.
All come for the politics, the sugared black tea and the occasional bowl of spaghetti.

Fourth Cabaret Convention  Town Hall 123 West 43d Street Manhattan Through Sunday
Because cabaret is a form of entertainment kept alive by performers and promoters who do it more for love than from any expectations of fame and fortune, it always seems on the verge of dying out.
But as Monday's opening night concert of the Fourth Cabaret Convention at Town Hall proved, there is a supportive audience and an abundance of talent to keep this most fragile and intimate of entertainment forms afloat for the foreseeable future.
And the outstanding performances of Jeff Harnar, Phillip Officer and Tom Andersen -- three young New Yorkers who are emerging as stars of the genre -- showed a field normally dominated by women being refreshed with potent male voices.

20 New York Schools to Lose U.S. Grants
The Federal Government said yesterday that it would no longer give grants to 20 schools in New York that focus on Hasidic religious studies because of widespread fraud in their grant applications.
Federal officials said yesterday that the schools, in Brooklyn, Queens and Monsey in Rockland County, would be disqualified from recieving assistance through the Pell grant program.
The 21-year-old program, which supports college-level vocational training, has been marred in recent years by a series of scandals across the nation.

Giuliani's politics and ideology.

Transportation, pharmaceutical and cable issues pushed the market forward, making up for declines in the casino, tobacco and waste-management companies.
Though the blue chips were generally up, weakness in stocks of small and medium companies once again broke the market's momentum.

Battered by nearly $9 billion in losses over the last three years and with more to come, the Lloyd's of London insurance market today adopted the most radical change since its founding three centuries ago -- an effort to attract new financing and renewed confidence.

Diversion for British Aristocrats
Until now, all of Lloyd's capital was provided by these "names," affluent individual investors who before a recent series of heavy losses had come to regard putting their money in Lloyd's as part upper-class British social rite and part annuity.

Morton Gould Program  Queens Chamber Symphony Maurice Peress, conductor Queens College Concert Hall
In anticipation of Morton Gould's 80th birthday, which is on Dec. 10, Maurice Peress presented a program on Sunday afternoon that steered clear of this prolific composer's most popular showpieces (the "American Salute," for example) yet left no doubts about why his music has an enthusiastic following.
Mr.
Gould can seem to be a trend surfer: From the 1930's on, he steeped many of his scores in the textures and harmonies of various kinds of jazz.
At other times, he drew on the popularity of musical Americana and wove folk songs and spirituals into his music.
And his latest work, a children's piece, involves a rapper and is about dinosaurs.

But supporters, even while conceding that the measure may have little effect, said the state had the responsibility to make a statement supporting the system of property ownership as it has evolved through history, regardless of who may have been victimized at one time or another.

Review/Film; Eccentrics At Play In a French Chateau
"Chasing Butterflies" ("La Chasse aux Papillons") is the new French film by Otar Iosseliani, a director from Russian Georgia who's proud of it.

BBDO Worldwide in New York, which had handled the account in North America, had withdrawn from the review because handling Lycra worldwide would have conflicted with the International Wool Secretariat, which it handles in 13 Asian-Pacific and European countries.


CATERPILLAR INC. (N)
Powered by an 18 percent jump in domestic sales, Caterpillar Inc. reported yesterday that its third-quarter net income from operations was $96 million, far ahead of the year-earlier quarter's $5 million and the $50 million to $65 million generally projected on Wall Street.
Caterpillar also booked a $300 million after-tax benefit from settlement of a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service and a one-time $36 million tax credit, lifting total net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 to $432 million.


RESULTS PLUS
GOLF  Elkington Beats Daly  Long-hitting John Daly threw his club after missing a five-foot putt on the first hole of the world match play championship yesterday in Virginia Water, England and sent a 5-iron approach over the green and out of bounds on 12 in losing, 5 and 4, to Australian Steve Elkington.
In other first-round matches, five-time champion Seve Ballesteros lost, 7 and 6, to David Frost; Corey Pavin beat Peter Baker, 4 and 3, and Colin Montgomerie birdied the last two holes to top Yoshinori Mizumaki in 37 holes. (AP) Bogey Thwarts Morgan: A lapse on the last hole cost Gil Morgan sole control of the lead after the second round of the five-day Las Vegas, Nev., Invitational.
Morgan's bogey-6 from the water dropped him into a share of the 36-hole lead with Bob Lohr, Keith Clearwater and Blaine McCallister.
Fourth-seeded Brad Gilbert beat Patrick Rafter of Australia, 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 6-2.

The Art-Law Center of the Universe
For the last month, several gray-suited men have trooped to a witness stand at State Supreme Court in Manhattan to argue the provenance of 14 works of ancient Roman silver.
The treasure, supposedly dug up in Lebanon decades ago, belongs to an English nobleman and was to be sold at auction in Switzerland.
But the Governments of Croatia and Hungary sued, each declaring that the silver had instead been taken from its soil and exported illegally.


Papers Show Greed, Calculation and Betrayal in Stew Leonard Fraud Case
To the world at large, Stew Leonard was the smiling face on posters at his Connecticut dairy store, the man who made sure customers got what they wanted and who sometimes roamed the aisles in a cow costume, giving them warm hugs.
But court papers filed by the Government this week in Mr.
Leonard's $17.1 million tax-fraud case show that he played another role behind the scenes.
As mastermind of the scheme, he directed his top managers to bundle stacks of cash into $10,000 piles and place them in a safe hidden in his office fireplace.
He then carted the money off to the Caribbean stashed in suitcases or camouflaged as baby gifts.


Bye-Bye, Rabbit Balls: The Dead-Ball Era Is Back
For the better part of four games in the World Series, the stage belonged to the big boys.
The record 65 runs scored by the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies indicated as much.
Sometimes, though, when the home runs don't fly, when the doubles don't pierce the gaps routinely, little ball and little guys can mean the difference between winning and losing.

Aristide Team, With Help, Blocks the Sale of Gasoline
Haiti's civilian Government, acting in concert with international oil companies, blocked gasoline sales throughout the country today in a move that could force a showdown with the nation's military leadership.
The announcement early today that local sales and deliveries of gasoline would be banned as part of the United Nations-ordered embargo on oil sales to Haiti, set off last minute panic buying in the capital this morning as gas stations received instructions from oil companies to lock their pumps.


CHRONICLE
The editors of Aufbau, the German language newspaper that served as the voice of the Jews who had escaped Nazism during World War II, could think of no better way to pay homage to their guiding light, Manfred George, than with his own words.
So today, on what would have been his 100th birthday, Aufbau will reprint an article by Mr.
George, who died in 1965 after serving as its editor in chief for 26 years.
He transformed Aufbau, which is now published every other week in New York, from a club newsletter into an international publication with an advisory board that included Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann.
The article, written in 1948, dealt with Mr.
George's vision for the newly established state of Israel.


P.L.O. Moderate Shot Dead, Raising Fears on Pact
A leading moderate in the Palestine Liberation Organization was shot to death today in Gaza, intensifying fears that violence within the Palestinian movement could threaten the agreement to begin the transfer of authority in the occupied territories from Israel to the P.L.O.
The shooting of Assad Saftawi, 58, occurred several hours before Israeli and P.L.O. negotiators announced in Egypt that they had come to terms on a release next week of some Palestinians held in Israeli prisons -- probably several hundred, Israeli officials said.


Kelly Moves A Monitor To a New Job
A top official of the New York City Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau was transferred by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly yesterday, three weeks after the bureau fell under sharp criticism during a mayoral commission's hearings on police corruption.
The official, Chief Robert J. Beatty, who was the second in command and the former head of Internal Affairs, will take charge of a new bureau, overseeing the department's 911 emergency communication system, as well as its efforts to modernize its computer technology.
He will not be replaced at Internal Affairs; rather, his responsibilities will be assumed by his boss, Walter S. Mack Jr., the deputy commissioner for Internal Affairs and a former prosecutor who was brought into the department in May as the first civilian to head the bureau.


Anxious Haitians Start Building Boats Again
Colbert St.
Vil sat under a wooden boat with a chisel, carving the last touches on a vessel he said he was building to transport bags of rice and cement from ships docked at a nearby port to this coastal town.
This fishing hamlet, however, is one of the villages from which many Haitians have fled in rickety boats, trying to reach the United States and appeal for asylum from the military Government that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide two years ago.
And Mr.
St.
Vil's new cargo boat could quickly become a passenger boat.


Mere 90 Minutes Dwarfed by Eight Years of War
For eight years they waged the longest conventional war of this century.
For the last two weeks they have shared the same pool table and dining room.
But don't think for a minute that the Iran-Iraq rivalry has lost all of its edge.
The two countries will play a soccer match here Friday in this final round of Asian World Cup qualifying.
It will be their first official international match in 17 years, and although players and coaches have done their utmost to minimize the history, there is little doubt that this game still holds special meaning.
Both teams need a victory to maintain a reasonable chance of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
Iran is 1-1, losing to South Korea but defeating Japan.
Iraq lost to North Korea and tied South Korea. 'We Can Never Forget'
"You must remember," said midfielder Hamid Derakhshan, the Iranian captain.
"Face to face, we are friendly now and say hello, but inside, we can never forget what happened between us."


2 Youths Are Held in Series of Robberies
Two Brooklyn teen-agers have been arrested in a series of robberies of homes in affluent neighorhoods in eastern Queens, and the police said yesterday that the arrests had ended the crimes.
A third suspect remained at large.
Sgt.
William Nevins of the Queens Robbery Squad said a fingerprint left at one of the houses had led investigators to Rashawn Brown, 17, of 2950 West 23d Street in Coney Island, Brooklyn.
A housing police officer, Edward Rosado, who knew what Mr.
Brown looked like, saw him in the street on Saturday and arrested him, Sergeant Nevins said.


Tax-Credit Financing to Aid In Building Housing Units
New York City should get enough money from a Federal tax-credit program to help build at least 6,000 new housing units for the poor over the next five years, housing advocates said yesterday.
Earlier this year a delay in Congressional renewal of the tax-credit program slowed scores of public-private housing projects throughout the city that had been depending on the money.
But in August the program was made permanent as part of the Clinton budget package, paving the way, proponents said, for even greater participation from corporations.
The program allows corporations to donate money toward a fund to build housing in exchange for reductions in their Federal tax bills.


Corrections
An obituary last Friday about the actress Ruth Gilbert misstated the place of her death.
She had been a patient at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, but she died at a hospice at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.


CONGRESSMEN KILL THE SUPERCOLLIDER
A Congressional panel officially killed the $11 billion Superconducting Supercollider today, but not before a final bitter wrangle between the members of the House and Senate conference committee over how lavish to make the burial.
The House members prevailed, just as they had Tuesday, when the House voted for the third time in 16 months to delete the supercollider's budget from an annual water-projects bill.


Austin E. Smith, 81, Drug Firm Executive and Journal Editor
Dr.
Austin E. Smith, the first president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, vice chairman of the Warner-Lambert Company and editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, died on Oct. 9 at his home in Fort Myers, Fla.
He was 81.
A graduate of the Queens University Faculty of Medicine in Kingston, Ontario, Dr.
Smith joined the A.M.A. staff after completing his residency, becoming the organization's director of therapy and research.
After writing "The Drugs You Use," (Revere, 1948,) a practical guide to the proper use of drugs, he was made editor of the organization's journal in 1949.


Legal Memo; Juries Lose a Lofty Aura In Glare of Instant Fame
In its day, no court proceeding was more celebrated or scrutinized than the espionage trial of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.
But the 12 ordinary New Yorkers who convicted the Rosenbergs blended back quietly and quickly into obscurity.
Though any enterprising reporter could have tracked them down, years passed before they were ever debriefed.
The trial of two black Los Angeles men charged with beating a white truck driver named Reginald Denny, as notorious as it was, has not so monopolized the public consciousness.
But a court concerned for their safety nonetheless granted anonymity to the 12 men and women hearing the case.
This did not entirely ease the jurors' lot, judging from the various psychological, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems they encountered while deliberating.


Tokyo Journal; Red-Light District, Fortunes Dimmed, Is Gloomy
When the Tokyo Metropolitan Government opened a big commercial complex this year next to a warren of peep shows, strip clubs and massage parlors known as Kabukicho, it was regarded as a cleansing shaft of light that would refurbish the hard-bitten area.
The new building had well-lighted plazas, a hospital, a large health club and a store that symbolizes the purer virtues of fresh air and good clean fun to Japanese as well as Americans -- L. L. Bean.

'Unemployed Architects Don't Make Good Waiters,' Workers Say


Market Place; Amid bleak quarterly estimates for I.B.M., some optimism.
WAITING for the turnaround at I.B.M. is going to take patience.
And almost no one expects to see the evidence of a recovery on Tuesday, when the International Business Machines Corporation reports its third-quarter financial results.
The estimates of 16 Wall Street analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research range from break even to a loss of $354 million, with the consensus seeing a loss of $160 million.


Body and Dreams Trampled, a Riot Victim Fights On
The verdicts in the Reginald O. Denny case are in, and this bruised city anticipates a new beginning.
But for at least one victim of the mayhem at Florence and Normandie Avenues, who is now broke, sick and scared, the spiral of misery has no end.
He is Fidel Lopez, a Guatemalan immigrant, who after 20 years of toil had seized the American dream for his wife and three daughters, a dream that was dashed in seconds when he drove his pickup truck into an intersection just blocks from his home where fires roared and bedlam reigned.


Czech Leader Pushes for Open NATO
In a sharp retort to what are regarded here as disappointing proposals by the United States for Eastern Europe's relationship with NATO, the Czech President, Vaclav Havel, declared today that associate membership in the alliance could not be a substitute for future security guarantees.
"Any dialogue on associate or observer status is welcome but cannot exclude our eventual full membership," Mr.
Havel said during an official visit to Poland.
"We will continue to express our opinion at the top of our voice."


Pacific Gas &amp; Electric reports earnings for 12mos to Sept 30


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; For Lintas, the cruelest month: Diet Coke is lost, now an upstart swipes the IBM PC account.
IN a second big dose of bad news this month, Lintas Worldwide was dropped by I.B.M.'s personal computer division just 16 days the agency lost the Diet Coke account.
I.B.M. named Merkley Newman Harty as its new agency for personal computer advertising the United States.
A cousin agency, DDB Needham in Paris, won the account for Europe, which had been shared by Lintas and GGT/GGK in London.


NATO Favors U.S. Plan for Ties With the East, but Timing Is Vague
European defense ministers today embraced a Clinton Administration plan that offers former Soviet republics and East European countries closer cooperation with NATO but not early membership in the alliance.
The plan, which Secretary of Defense Les Aspin outlined here at a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, raised the possibility of eventual assimilation of the former Warsaw Pact countries into NATO.
The plan is also a gesture to Germany, which has pressed to expand the 16-nation alliance to include nations of the former Warsaw Pact.

On Stage, and Off
A Joint Adventure?
In an unusual, if not unique, joint venture tying Hollywood to the New York stage, Steven Spielberg has agreed to underwrite up to 10 playwriting commissions over the next two years for plays to be produced and developed by Playwrights Horizons.
The commissions of between $7,000 and $12,000 each will go to young, emerging playwrights, the recipients to be chosen by and agreed upon by Don Scardino, artistic director of Playwrights Horizons, and Mr.
Spielberg.
For his investment, Mr.
Spielberg is assured a first look at the play as a potential film property.
That is, his production company, Amblin Entertainment, will have a chance to bid on each play's film rights.
If Amblin does make the film, the playwright is assured the assignment of writing the first and second drafts of the screenplay, and in addition, Playwrights Horizons will be involved, as associate producers, in the production, contributing to the creative development of the project and, just as important, participating in the profits. (The traditional arrangement is that the developing theater gets 40 percent of the writer's share.)


A Reluctant Parting With an Old Reliable; Competition Leads Goodwill Industries of Greater New York to Give Up Collection Bins
Goodwill Industries, which has relied for 40 years on charitable donations of used clothing to finance aid to the disabled, is reluctantly giving up its collection bins in the New York area.
Donations are dropping, it says, because of competition from businesses that salvage and resell clothing.
In many cases, these businesses set up bins, labeled with the names of groups supposedly using the donations for charity, right beside Goodwill bins in parking lots at malls or supermarkets.
And donors, often as concerned with getting clutter out of their closets as with doing a good deed, tend to drop off donations at the first collection spot they find.





COMPANY REPORTS; Times Company Reports Loss in Quarter
The New York Times Company said yesterday that it lost $3 million, or 4 cents a share, in the third quarter, down from a loss of $35 million, or 44 cents a share, for the comparable period last year.
The company said that the increase in corporate tax rates lowered the quarter's results by 7 cents a shares, and that one-time items accounted for the loss in the 1992 quarter.
Otherwise, earnings would have totaled 3 cents a share in each quarter.


U.S. Peacekeeping Arrears Could Reach a Billion
The United States faces arrears approaching $1 billion for United Nations peacekeeping operations in the coming year after both houses of Congress passed a bill greatly reducing the budget contributions to the United Nations.
The compromise bill, hammered out between the House and Senate, reflects hostility toward the mounting cost and complexity of United Nations peacekeeping operations, a belief that Washington's share of these bills is too large and a concern about waste and corruption at the United Nations.


Historic Church in Chelsea Gets a Make-Over


Art in Review
Elliott Puckette  Paul Kasmin 74 Grand Street SoHo Through Oct. 30
In her solo debut, Elliott Puckette seeks an 18th-century solution to a late-20th-century problem: how to claim as one's own the all-over abstract painting that Jackson Pollock helped to introduce into modern art.
Ms.
Puckette's method relies on old-fashioned penmanship, as well as suggestions of the wood-block print.
Working with a razor blade on wood panels painted with dark gray ink and pigment, she covers the surface with airy yet elaborate cursive thickets of curls and loops and spirals, giving center stage to the decorative flourishes with which a talented penman might surround a text.


Marshall and Sacks Have Become Strangers
This is a fragile time for the Jets, especially for their pass rushers.
The defense has recorded 10 sacks this season, but Jeff Lageman is the only lineman to have one.
The Jets face Jim Kelly and the Buffalo Bills on Sunday at Giants Stadium, the first of a difficult three-game stretch that includes the Giants and the Miami Dolphins.
But this is no time for Coach Bruce Coslet to demean his sad non-sackers, particularly Leonard Marshall.


Art in Review
Lewis Hine
Robert Mann Gallery  42 East 76th Street  Manhattan  Through Nov. 13
What unites Lewis Hine's best work is his passionate interest in the lives of the people he photographed.
As this small but valuable survey demonstrates, Hine brought this fascination to all of his subjects, from his early portraits of immigrants arriving on Ellis Island, to his famous pictures of children working in coal mines or spinning mills, to the thrilling images he made in the 1930's of workers constructing the Empire State Building.


Home Video
Studios are always looking for reasons to recycle old movies on videotape, especially big old movies.
Usually a major anniversary will do, but this fall there is a fresh promotional theme for special editions: new tapes made from master prints that come from original film negatives.
On Wednesday, Fox will reissue "The African Queen" (1962).
Earlier this month, Columbia Tri-Star released new tapes of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" (1957) and five other prominent old films, including "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939).
And on Nov. 17, MGM/UA will release another edition of "The Wizard of Oz" (the last one being the 50th-anniversary edition in 1989), a $99.98 package called "The Ultimate Oz."


Restaurants
When you walk into the room, your first impression is warmth and laughter.
All around the restaurant, people are huddled over grills, drinking and talking and gesturing wildly as great gusts of fragrant steam go billowing toward the ceiling.
Men scurry about with buckets of blazing coals, replenishing the fires at each table, and waitresses walk past bearing trays laden with vegetables as bright as jewels.
The air smells of smoke and sugar and chilies and garlic, and the whole atmosphere is so inviting that you are irresistibly drawn into the center of the room.
Why hasn't Korean food become more popular in New York City?
This is a puzzle because of all the Asian cuisines, Korean is most accessible to the American palate.
Long ago we rose above our distrust of garlic and began our continuing romance with Chinese cooking.
Then we overcame our fear of raw fish and learned to love Japanese.
When Thai food came along, it seduced half the country.
But most of us have yet to discover Korean cooking, which offers a great many things we already love (beef, barbecue, the opportunity to graze) and presents very few obstacles. (Well, you do have to love garlic and chilies.)


Missing in Tokyo: Chrysler's Japan-Fighter
As the United States presented demands this week for Japan to open its market to foreign automobiles, the American car considered to have one of the best chances of succeeding here was conspicuously absent from the Tokyo Motor Show.
The Chrysler Corporation is not exhibiting its new Neon subcompact, a vehicle specifically intended to compete with small Japanese cars, because the company has no immediate plans to sell the model in Japan.


Schools Pension Money Diverted, Auditors Say
The director of a Board of Education pension fund improperly diverted up to $1.2 million a year from a special fund to pay for the agency's operating expenses, including meals, air fare, parking and hotel costs, according to a confidential management audit.
The audit, by KPMG Peat Marwick, depicted the Board of Education Retirement System as being "mired in conflict" and in disarray.
It found that the money was diverted for years without the knowledge of the fund's board of directors -- including all seven members of the Board of Education.


Laggards in Hands of Angry Keenan
In his most dramatic act of anger in this young season, Rangers Coach Mike Keenan broke a hockey stick over a crossbar at the Rye Playland rink yesterday morning and ordered his players off the ice less than 15 minutes into practice.
Keenan, who said his players weren't working hard, held a 10-minute closed-door meeting with them in the team's locker room before resuming practice, which lasted approximately 20 more minutes.


Panel Tells Cancer Institute to Stop Giving Advice on Mammograms
An advisory panel to the National Cancer Institute took an unusual stance today in the debate over guidelines for breast cancer screening: instead of giving advice, the institute should lay out the scientific data and let others draw their own conclusions.
That means, for example, that the institute would no longer recommend whether women in their 40's should have mammograms, a particularly sticky issue.
Nor would it advise whether older women, who studies have shown benefit from mammograms, should have the test every year or every other year.
Instead, the institute would publish information so that women could draw their own conclusions.

Doctor's Bid To Sue Times Is Reinstated
The state's highest court yesterday reinstated a libel action by Dr.
Elliot M. Gross, a former Chief Medical Examiner of New York City, who accused The New York Times of defaming him in a series of articles that quoted pathologists and others and criticized his work.
In a 5-0 ruling overturning two lower courts that had dismissed the action, the Court of Appeals held that the articles contained enough statements presented as facts to warrant at least pretrial proceedings.
The Times had argued, and the lower courts agreed, that the articles reported expressions of opinion about a public official and were protected by constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press.


Big Board's Open Positions on Short Sales Drop
Even though stock prices are high and merger activity is strong, the number of shares sold short and not covered on the New York Stock Exchange fell this month, the Big Board reported yesterday.
The 2.8 percent drop, to 1.19 billion shares, came on the heels of a 12 percent rise in short interest in September, the biggest gain in recent years.

Man Is Shot to Death And 2 Are Wounded
A man was shot and killed and another man and a youth were wounded last night when an unidentified man walked up to a crowd on a Brooklyn street and started shooting, the police said.
One man was shot twice in the head and killed immediately, said Sgt.
John McCluskey, a police spokesman.
The second man, Patrick Grant, 18, was struck in the left wrist and treated at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center.

Russia Halts Nuclear Waste Dumping in Sea
Bowing to protests from Japan, the United States, and other countries, Russia said today that it had suspended plans to dump low-level nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan this weekend.
But Russia coupled the suspension with an appeal for foreign financial help to speed construction of a nuclear waste-processing plant, and said that if it took more than 18 months to build one the Russian Navy might be forced to resume disposing of the waste at sea.

Daimler Raising $510 Million
Daimler-Benz A.G., which early this month became the first German company to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange, yesterday priced $510.2 million of asset-backed securities for sale to the public.
The certificates are being sold by the Daimler-Benz Auto Receivables Corporation through its Daimler-Benz Auto Grantor Trust 1993-A.
They are backed by loans made by the Mercedes-Benz Credit Corporation, which provides financing for dealers for cars distributed by the Daimler-Benz North America Corporation.


In REM Sleep? You Missed All the R.B.I.
Never before had a World Series game taken so long to complete.
Never before had so many runs been scored in a World Series game.
Never before had a losing team scored 14 runs.
Never before had so many emotional twists and turns been packed into one stadium on one drizzly, foggy night.
Never before.
Maybe never again.
The strange and charming fourth game of the 90th World Series Wednesday night between the Blue Jays and the Phillies left one Toronto pitcher, Todd Stottlemyre, bloody after he tried to run the bases; left the entire Philadelphia team bloodied after its closer disintegrated; left Lenny Dykstra groping for words to explain what happened after his virtuoso offensive performance was denied, and also left Toronto one victory from its second straight championship.
The Jays won, 15-14, but not before several stunning, game-turning events were packed into 4 hours 14 minutes of sometimes radiant, sometimes rancid, baseball.

TV Weekend; A Vigilante Mayor for Rome, Wis.
Tonight at 10, CBS's "Picket Fences" returns for a second season and wastes no time showing why it won this year's Emmy Award for best drama.
Initially somewhat flaky, as if hung over from too many rounds of "Twin Peaks," the series has gradually fastened on an astute mix of drama and low-key humor, cleverly draped around one family and a small Wisconsin town named Rome.
This evening's tale, written by David E. Kelley, the show's creator, begins with a murder.
The town's mayor, Bill Pugen (Michael Keenan), is warned by a knife-wielding and obviously unstable carjacker that if arrested, he'd return some day for revenge.
The Mayor puts a bullet in the thug's head, even after the knife is dropped, explaining that "I could tell from the look in his eyes he'd be back, and I have a family."


Making Schools Serve Children
Both Mayor David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani have offered wish lists for New York City's public schools.
But most of their proposals skirt the edges of what happens in classrooms.
That's because, under the current system, the mayor has little direct responsibility for schools.
Mr.
Dinkins is at least willing to assume more responsibility.
He wants to appoint a majority of an expanded central Board of Education, giving voters a target for their approval or disapproval of the board's actions.
Mr.
Giuliani, his Republican-Liberal challenger, wants to eliminate the central board and create five borough boards.
That new structure would probably mire the system even more in politics and bureaucratic entanglements.


Review/Film; A Child's Search for a World Where Blood Feuds Vanish
"Flight of the Innocent," an Italian film by Carlo Carlei, is about the desperate attempt of a wide-eyed, remarkably self-sufficient 10-year-old Calabrian boy named Vito (Manuel Colao) to escape his southern Italian heritage.
In an opening sequence, Vito is the terrified witness to the massacre of his entire family by the members of another Calabrian family that wants to cut itself in on the profits of a kidnapping.
It seems that Vito's father and older brothers, made destitute by a social system that ignores them, have turned to crime.
They have kidnapped the son of a rich Roman couple and have been holding the child for ransom.


End the Grim Harvest
The United Nations General Assembly turned its attention this week to the legacy of death from 100 million land mines sown across the globe.
Calling for a report by next year on improving international mine-clearing efforts, for the first time the Assembly formally recognized the need to assist the estimated 62 countries afflicted by this scourge.
Land mines have turned large areas of the world into a permanent no man's land.
Mostly mines lie buried and unmarked, part of a deliberate strategy to terrorize civilians, continuing to kill innocent people long after wars end.


Spectrum's 'Orderly' Session
At its annual meeting of shareholders at the convention center in Pasadena, Calif., Wednesday night, the management of Spectrum Information Technologies Inc. went over a selective menu of business items.
Spectrum, which named John Sculley, former chairman of Apple Computer, as its chief executive on Monday, banned the news media from the meeting and declined to allow shareholders to ask questions at a microphone.
But some shareholders knew to write down questions before the meeting began.

Can't We Afford a Little Music in Our Lives?
To the Editor:
I went to see the Martha Graham Dance Company last week.
The dancing was superb and this heightened my sadness and distress at having a third-row seat, perched above an empty orchestra pit, listening to the music pumped through a rather tinny sound system at New York's City Center.
The music is an integral part of the dance and I find this state of affairs appalling.
At first I thought my reaction was the embittered response of a musician struggling to make a living in one of the many American orchestras that hover at bankruptcy's gate.
But upon reflection, I think that any educated listener would respond as I did.


It's Tough To Keep Stevens Off the Ice
The Devils are so happy at work these days, they look for any excuse they can to leave home and go to the rink on optional days of practice.
Scott Stevens has the best excuse.
His 30-month-old son, Ryan, keeps begging to go to the rink every day and Stevens, the Devils' captain, is happy to oblige.


Tyson Tells Newspaper He May Settle in Africa
MIKE TYSON, the former world heavyweight champion who has been in prison since last year on a rape conviction, has said he may settle in Africa to escape racism against blacks in the United States.
"Maybe I should consider settling there since America has become an asylum, especially for blacks," he told The Herald newspaper in Harare, Zimbabwe.


Prison for Driver Who Killed 5 Children


Queens Arrests In Kidnapping Include Victim
When officers burst into a hide-out rented by Asian gang members in Queens at 4 A.M.
Wednesday, the police said, they found 12 young men and women and the tools of their trade: three machine guns, a couple of handguns and several shackles attached to the wall.
Several gang members were cooking a meal when the police surprised them, and among them was a kidnapping victim, an officer said.
But the victim has so far refused to implicate his 11 captors, the police say, and he is apparently afraid of what the gang members or their friends might do to his family in China.


Art in Review
Markus Lupertz  Michael Werner Gallery 21 East 67th Street  Manhattan Through Oct. 30
For those who have always been cool to Markus Lupertz's dandyish art, with its ambiguous evocations of Nazi power in some instances and, in others, its ironic borrowings from modernism, the German painter's latest efforts may offer something to warm to.
They depict large heads painted in rich yet subdued tones in a direct, awkward manner that is a welcome departure from the artist's characteristically suave, almost illustrational painting style.


Review/Film; Microcosms: 2 Jewish Retreats
"The Shvitz," Jonathan Berman's rambling documentary history of New York steam baths, is only 50 minutes long.
But so much of the film is devoted to showing pot-bellied, hairy-chested men over 50 waddle around in towels and drip sweat that watching it is not unlike sitting in a steam room too long.
You are likely to leave the film feeling wrung out rather than energized.
The film, the longest part of "New York in Short," a double bill at the Cinema Village exploring Jewish life in New York City, wants to be a jolly celebration of a healthful tradition that Eastern European Jews brought with them to America.
At one time, New York City had more than 200 steam baths, many of them in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn.
"The Shvitz" tours Brighton Beach and the Lower East Side of Manhattan, weaving vintage film and photographs with interviews with longtime patrons of the baths.

Zoo Story: A Q.-and-A. Stroll in Queens
MANY people love the zoo, but no one wants to see a bunch of disaffected animals stuck in tiny, dirty cages clearly wishing they were doing something else, like sprinting across the plains.
I still think with horror about a zoo I visited a couple of years ago whose main features were a wrinkled, one-tusked elephant (he looked for all the world like the elephant who ate something bad and died in the Babar story) and some bedraggled, mangy bison lying in a heap.
But zoos are undergoing a metamorphosis, paying more attention than ever to living conditions and in some cases becoming refuges where almost-extinct species are collected and resuscitated.
In New York City, where the New York Zoological Society/Wildlife Conservation Society tried to banish the word "zoo" early this year in favor of the fancier "wildlife conservation park," the zoological society is pouring money into three of the zoos it operates: in Central Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens and Prospect Park in Brooklyn.
The idea is to make them easier on the animals and on anthropomorphically inclined people like me. (The society also operates the Bronx Zoo.)


Revolution in Lawyers' Fees: The Meter Is Being Shut Off
It has been the bedrock of the lawyer-client relationship for decades: the billable hour.
Lawyers have charged for their services by the hour, many with little inhibition about the number of hours accumulated, and clients have paid, often without a second thought.
But now the ground is shifting in response to increased competition among law firms and to diminished revenue among law firms and clients alike.
And that shift, particularly in corporate law, has begun to bury the hourly rate.
Cost-cutting alternative billing schemes are on the rise, and in some cases firms are even being forced to bid for corporate business.


Scientologists Report Assets of $400 Million
The Church of Scientology, the secretive and combative international organization that recently won a decades-long drive for Federal tax exemption, counts assets of about $400 million and appears to take in nearly $300 million a year from counseling fees, book sales, investments and other sources, according to documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
The financial disclosures are in documents the church was required to file with the I.R.S. in applying for tax-exempt status, conferred on 30 or more entities of the church on Oct. 10.
The documents, 12 linear feet of them in eight cardboard boxes, formed the basis for the I.R.S.'s decision and became a matter of public record when tax exemption was granted.

Tear Gas and Chaos as Belts Tighten in France
Two European crises -- unemployment and the airline industry's poor financial condition -- converged today to produce a third day of chaos and violent clashes at the two major Paris airports and on the roads leading to them.
Air France, like other European and American carriers facing increasingly stiff global competition, has been trying for three years to slash costs.


Sports of The Times; The '93 Imperfect Classic
IF Don Larsen pitched a perfect game in the World Series, then the Blue Jays' 15-14 victory Wednesday night was the imperfect game.
But they're equally memorable.
As dominant as right-hander Curt Schilling was in the Phillies' taut victory last night, people will cherish or curse the fourth game of this World Series the way they do the other classic games in Series history.
The word there is "games."


U.S. Drops Test Plan at Bomb Waste Site
The Department of Energy abandoned plans today to put the first plutonium-contaminated bomb waste into underground storage in New Mexico to test the site's suitability.
Instead, it will conduct laboratory tests of the project and seek further Federal review of its environmental merits.
Hazel R. O'Leary, the Secretary of Energy, called the decision "a major break with the last Administration's approach."


On Night After, Schilling and Phillies Stifle Jays
Curt Schilling, saddled with a depleted bullpen and the prospect of an early start on winter, turned off the Toronto Blue Jays' run faucet tonight.
After watching the Blue Jays batter eight of his fellow pitchers for 25 runs in the previous two games, including 15 in a wild and wacky game Wednesday night, Schilling stymied the American League champions on five hits as the Philadelphia Phillies stole a 2-0 victory.

CHRONICLE
There was a distinct Canadian flavor at the Jewish Museum reception Wednesday night, and that was no surprise considering that it was a celebration for a show called "A Coat of Many Colours: Two Centuries of Jewish Life in Canada." Some three dozen Canadians, including former Prime Minister BRIAN MULRONEY and his wife, MILA, were among the more than 100 guests.
The show, a blend of artifacts and videotapes, opened three and a half years ago in Ottawa.
Since then it has toured Canada and been seen in Tel Aviv.
New York is its last stop.


Man Tied to Crime Family Is Shot to Death in Queens
A former union official whom the authorities described as a high-level boss in the Colombo organized-crime family was shot to death Wednesday night by several hooded gunmen in front of his house in Queens as he was returning from dinner with his nephew and future son-in-law.
The murder of Joseph Scopo, 47, signaled a resumption of hostilities in a bloody civil war between factions loyal to Carmine Persico, the imprisoned boss of the family, and Victor J. Orena, who Mr.
Persico named as his temporary successor but who is also in prison.

U.S. Freezes Assets of 41 Haitians
The Clinton Administration stepped up its campaign against Haiti's military leadership today by giving American banks a list of Haitian military and police leaders whose bank accounts, real estate and other assets are to be frozen.
The list includes 41 Haitians who have worked to keep the military in power or have tried to prevent the return of Haiti's President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.


Plan Opens More Data To Public
In the clearest indication yet of the Clinton Administration's willingness to offer broader public access to Government information, the National Science Foundation is financing a project that will make corporate filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission available free via a computer network.
The decision to support the project, which will provide access to the S.E.C.'s on-line data base of financial data from America's public corporations, is a shift away from the Federal information policies under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
Those Administrations favored letting private companies sell printed and electronic versions of Government data.


Dickerson Is Finished
ERIC DICKERSON, the National Football League's second-leading career rusher, has decided to retire.
"I know I'm not going to play again; I mean, that's obvious," Dickerson said from his California home Wednesday night.
"It's still tough to say the word 'retirement,' but I'm a realistic guy. I'm a great believer that everything happens for a reason, and this is something I've been thinking about anyway. My mother's been telling me for years to get out, so now she'll be happy."


Corrections
The caption yesterday with a photograph of Vice President Al Gore and Mayor David N. Dinkins listening to a speech misstated the circumstances.
They were at the installation of the America-Israel Friendship Grove at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens, not a meeting of the Jewish Community Relations Council.
The caption also misidentified Abraham Hecht, the man sitting behind them.
He is president of the Queens Jewish Community Council, not a member of the Jewish Community Relations Council.


Aftershocks of Verdicts Rumble Across the Nation
Far from Los Angeles, the verdict reverberated across the United States today, playing out like a Rorschach test of gaping racial divisions.
On talk shows and in interviews in several cities, many whites saw a judicial breakdown in the trial of two black men charged with beating a white truck driver at the start of the Los Angeles riots.
Some linked it to an outdated and hypocritical national discourse on race that, they said, has turned criminal issues into civil rights ones.

Fallon Management Buys Back Agency
After long trying to gain its independence from the WPP Group, Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis said yesterday that its top managers had succeeded in buying back the agency.
"We're more comfortable as owners of a house, rather than renters of a room in the WPP house," said Bill Westbrook, the president and creative director of Fallon.
"It allows us to control our own destiny." He added that serious negotiations began five to six months ago between WPP and Fallon's management, which includes himself; Pat Fallon, the chairman; Irving D. Fish, the chief financial officer, and others.

Ammunition in Tax-Rebate Scare
With little warning, debate has been rekindled over New Jersey's homestead tax-rebate program -- a touchy subject with one of the most powerful groups in the electorate: the elderly.
Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, a Republican, charged yesterday that the administration of Gov.
Jim Florio, a Democrat, had either manipulated or mismanaged the distribution of this year's rebate checks and touched off what the Speaker described as panic and anger among thousands of elderly people.
The tax rebates are sent annually to homeowners and tenants.


Art in Review
'Ann Hamilton'  'Tropos'  Dia Center for the Arts 548 West 22d Street Chelsea Through June 19
In "Tropos," Ann Hamilton's latest installation-performance work, the artist once more orchestrates several emotionally charged elements in the vicinity of a meaning that remains tantalizingly yet irritatingly vague.
One of the most Minimal and least melodramatic works Ms.
Hamilton has created, it is also one of the most effective, but that doesn't make it problem-free.


Sounds Around Town
Jimmy Scott Returns
Jimmy Scott, the Blue Room at the Supper Club, 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-1940.
Jimmy Scott's singing career seemed to be off to an auspicious start 45 years ago when he was singing and recording with Lionel Hampton's band.
But he had to wait until he was in his late 60's, after 20 years of virtual retirement, before he found the audience that had slipped through his fingers earlier.
He was lured back to performing in the early 90's by the encouragement of fellow singers like Ruth Brown, who had also gone through a period of rejection after early success.
He made a widely acclaimed debut at the Supper Club last spring, and is back for an engagement through Nov. 20.
His shows are at 8 and 10 P.M. tonight and tomorrow night.
There is a $20 cover charge and a $12 minimum.
JOHN S. WILSON Gently Dueling Guitars
Jim Hall and Peter Bernstein, Tishman Hall at the New School, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 229-5690.
In the mid-1950's Jim Hall was a member of the Chico Hamilton Quintet, and then the Jimmy Giuffre Three.
Since then he has been associated for varying lengths of time with such distinctive jazz musicians as Sonny Rollins, Art Farmer, Ron Carter and Paul Desmond.
His latest colleague is the guitarist Peter Bernstein, a graduate of the New School Jazz Program, in which Mr.
Hall is a faculty member.
They first played together at a JVC concert a couple of years ago and will be together again tonight at 6 as part of the "Jazz at 6" series.
Tickets are $10 and can bought at the door.

After eight years of running her own club, J's, at Broadway and 97th Street, the singer Judy Barnett closed it in June when faced with a stiff increase in rent.
She is now freelancing at other clubs around town.
Tonight she will be doing a doubleheader: appearing early in the evening at the Fourth Annual Cabaret Convention, which the Mabel Mercer Foundation is putting on at at Town Hall, then moving on to Don't Tell Mama for a performance at 10 P.M. with her band (Andy Tuck on piano, Bill Miller on bass, Grisha Alexiev on drums and Marshal Rosenberg on percussion).
Tickets at Town Hall are $10.
She'll be there through Sunday.

Political Memo; Abortion and the Health Plan: Hard Questions in Both Camps
Abortion rights groups are finishing a season of legislative struggle on Capitol Hill that carries some grim omens for their next great battle: the attempt to have abortion services, for rich and poor alike, covered under a national health care plan.
Recent votes in the House and Senate upholding strict curbs on the Federal financing of abortion suggest that the center of political gravity has not shifted as much as many expected after the election of a President sympathetic to the cause of abortion rights.

It May Be Nafta or Japan, A Clinton Aide Argues
Picking up a theme pursued by the Clinton Administration this week, Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, warned yesterday that if Congress rejected the North American Free Trade Agreement, a backlash in Mexico might lead the Government there to sign a trade deal with Japan.
"One could readily imagine a backlash if Nafta does not pass," and that could prompt Mexico to negotiate favored-nation agreements with Japan and European countries, Mr.
Altman said in answer to questions after a speech at the Japan Society in New York.


Bishops and Health Care
To the Editor:
It is incorrect that I have spoken for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops against the Administration's health care plan, in its entirety, because it mandates abortion coverage (news article, Oct. 4).
This error is repeated in an Oct. 14 letter.
Neither in the interview with me nor in any public statements have I or anyone else at the conference done so.


New Rules on Satellite Paging
The Federal Communications Commission adopted rules today under which it will license new satellite-delivered paging and message services.
The new rules set the stage for companies to launch fleets of small satellites that circle a few hundred miles over the earth and can relay signals to and from low-powered portable paging devices.
The satellites could also be used to offer positioning information, so people carrying communications devices could instantly determine their own locations in remote regions of the country.

Sponsors Are Skate Issue
The continuing marriage between Olympic sports and corporate sponsorships has led to an awkward relationship in the world of figure skating.
This week's Skate America, the only international skating competition in the United States and an important prelude to the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, is sponsored by Sudafed, the cold relief medicine that contains stimulant properties and is thus contained on the International Olympic Committee's list of banned substances.
Another related development that raised some eyebrows was the unveiling of Korbel Champagne Cellars as a figure-skating sponsor in the United States.
This comes at a time of increased debate about the propriety of supporting athletic endeavors on the flow of alcohol.

Somali Faction Leader Warns U.N. to Disarm Aidid, His Foe
The chief Somali rival to Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid warned today that his faction could be forced to take up arms again if the United Nations did not press ahead in seeking to disarm General Aidid.
Mohammed Ali Mahdi, whose supporters control the northern half of Mogadishu, Somalia's divided capital, also said he and his representatives would not take part in peace talks in which General Aidid himself was present.


The Victory Column Is Empty for Guzman
Juan Guzman had just lost his first World Series game, he had just lost the delicious chance to be remembered as the pitcher who had secured Toronto's second straight championship, but he still burst into a mammoth grin in front of his locker after the game.
Why was this man smiling?
Guzman is a realist.
Curt Schilling pitched a brilliant game, shutting out the imposing Blue Jays one night after they had scored 15 runs.
Guzman pitched an adequate game.
He surrendered one earned run in seven innings.
But Guzman still lost to the Phillies, 2-0, at Veterans Stadium.
He lost to a better pitcher.
He knew it.
He accepted it.

But one Dershowitz client, the former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, has learned that sometimes a lawyer can be just too recognizable.
In fact, Mr.
Tyson languishes in jail, Mr.
Dershowitz contends, because an Indiana judge could not control his talkative and star-struck spouse.


Senate Opens Debate on Measure To Increase Grazing Fees in West
The Senate began debate today on compromise legislation that would raise grazing fees on Federal land in the West, but some senators from the region who oppose the plan said they would filibuster the measure.
Their threat to use interminable debate to kill the bill, which would provide money for the Interior Department, deepened the political divisions over the Clinton Administration's policies over public lands.


PRUDENTIAL AGREES TO PAY INVESTORS FOR FRAUD LOSSES
Prudential Securities Inc. agreed today to repay hundreds of thousands of customers for huge losses they suffered because of widespread fraud at the firm for more than a decade.

SEARS, ROEBUCK &amp; CO. (N)
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company yesterday reported continuing improvement in the profitability of its retailing operations and in Allstate Insurance, in which it has an 80.1 percent stake, during the three months that ended on Sept. 30.
Income from those operations and from Homart, Sears's real estate development subsidiary, was nearly $453.9 million, in contrast to a loss of $992.3 million a year ago when Allstate was reeling from $1.14 billion in losses related to Hurricane Andrew.
Excluding the impact of the hurricane, the recent quarter's earnings from continuing operations were triple those of a year earlier.

Dinkins Sees a Double Standard in Campaign Finance Fine
Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday bitterly condemned a fine imposed on his campaign by the New York City Campaign Finance Board, calling the action unfair and suggesting that the board applied a double standard by not imposing strict sanctions against the campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani.
But Mr.

Administration Drops Plan To Merge Justice Agencies
The Clinton Administration reversed itself today and dropped its proposal to try to save money by merging the Drug Enforcement Administration into the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The decision was a significant setback for Vice President Al Gore's plan to trim the Federal bureaucracy.
Plans to merge the two agencies have circulated in Washington for years.
But they were taken seriously this time because Mr.
Gore had made the consolidation a cornerstone of the efficiency program he announced two months ago.

Molitor Even Gets Hits After Games Are Over
Paul Molitor, the sizzling Toronto Blue Jays' designated hitter-turned-infielder, started out on a good note tonight even before stepping to the plate.
That's because Molitor was credited with a double one game after the fact.
A team of official scorers changed the decision from the night before, removing the error charged to Phillies third baseman Dave Hollins and rewarding Molitor with an eighth-inning double on a grounder that took a tricky hop past Hollins

Doctors at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, where Sherrard was being treated for a blood clot in his left hip, listed him in satisfactory condition.

A New Party in Western Canada Growing on Protest and Populism
Prairie populism, fed by economic disgruntlement, disenchantment with mainline politicians and hostility to power in Ottawa, is energizing a new political party that promises to give the Canadian West a greater say in the way the country is governed.
Attesting to the appeal of the Reform Party in the Oct. 25 elections are poll results, showing it could overtake the New Democrats as this country's third party, with as many as 50 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons.
The party now has only one House member.

Kasparov, Drawing, Wins the Match
Gary Kasparov won his world championship match with Nigel Short yesterday in London by making a draw in Game 20.
He thus reaffirmed his ascendancy in chess, where for the moment he stands alone in his prime.
Kasparov's decisive 12 1/2-to-7 1/2 score in the 24-game series, which started on Sept. 7, earned him a $1.43 million share of the $2.55 million purse. (There has been a recession in the chess world, too. In 1990, after winning the last championship match, he collected $1.7 million, along with a diamond-encrusted trophy.)

A Message From Florida on Nafta


Review/Dance; Bill Jones Troupe, in an Elegy for Departed Friends
The Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company is one of this country's most provocative and interesting modern dance troupes, even when operating at something less than full capability as it did on Wednesday night at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea).
The new dance on this second program of a two-week season was relatively minor.
But the performing was as impressive as ever.
And Mr.
Jones and dancers still provide one of the few occasions when today's modern dance addresses social issues of the time theatrically, and does so with a cathartic passion.
"There Were So Many" takes its name from a haiku-like elegy for departed friends and for blossoms that have fallen from a tree that was concealed in the once-crowded landscape.
Set to John Cage's "Six Melodies for Violin and Keyboard," the new piece, which looked unfinished, managed to suggest a cast of hundreds, all dressed in soft white fatigues designed by Linda Pratt and Jean Claude Mastroianni.
Ranged in lines, at four corners and in converging circles throughout the piece, the 12 dancers moved through their paces like robots trained in Baroque dance.
The look was formal and ornamental.
A few duets flecked the milling landscape like nubbles in woven fabric.


BANKERS TRUST NEW YORK CORP. (N)
The Bankers Trust New York Corporation earned a record $310 million profit in the third quarter as all of its leading lines of business grew and provided more earnings than they did a year earlier.
The profit was equal to a 30 percent return on shareholder equity, a level that is about twice the target set by other banks and similar to recent returns for securities firms.
As Bankers Trust continued to emphasize its securities business, its trading account grew 46 percent, to $43.6 billion, while loans on its balance sheet fell 12 percent, to $15.2 billion.

Reviews/Film; Drifting With a $20 Bill Among the Human Tides
Endre Bohem wrote his draft of the screenplay for "Twenty Bucks" in 1935, but it wound up on the shelf.
It sat there for nearly 50 years, at which point Mr.
Bohem turned the idea over to Leslie Bohem, his son.
In the early 80's the younger Mr.
Bohem was a bass player for the rock band Sparks, but he was in the market for a career change.
So he picked up the abandoned script and made it the basis for Keva Rosenfeld's first dramatic feature, a charming, offbeat tale shaped whimsically by the hand of fate.
In the process of writing their screenplay, the Bohems provided a prime example of the kind of gentle coincidence that governs their story.
"Twenty Bucks" follows a single $20 bill from birth (at a cash machine) to death (torn, tattered and returned to a bank for shredding).
And it stands by bemusedly as the currency passes from owner to owner.
This conceit has great potential for ponderousness, but Mr.
Rosenfeld (whose previous films have been documentaries) succeeds in reading almost nothing into the money's movements.
It simply drifts through the lives of different people, sometimes pausing long enough to alter their luck.

Irish: Success, Injuries, Questions
From the instant the football left his right hand, Ron Powlus knew what was wrong.
Last Sunday, in his first practice since breaking his right collarbone on Aug. 28, Powlus was throwing in a routine drill, without any contact, when he felt as if his right shoulder was temporarily too far ahead of his body.
The collarbone that had snapped under the weight of two tacklers in a preseason scrimmage had been broken again by the force of a simple 18-yard pass.
The freshman season of Notre Dame's quarterback prodigy, which had maintained a sense of anticipation as intense as his recruitment, was over before it started.

Big Brother Presumes to Deny Marijuana's Medical Efficacy
To the Editor:
I read of a 79-year-old woman named Mildred Kaitz who was arrested for cultivating marijuana in the backyard of her home in upstate New York (news article, Oct. 11).
She was doing so, she told police, because her 49-year-old son, Barton, is suffering from multiple sclerosis and she has observed that the most effective way to ameliorate the loss of appetite which that disease brings on is through marijuana intoxication.


Chancellor Tries to Resolve Parent Protest
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines sought without success again yesterday to mediate between parents occupying a Brooklyn elementary school and their local community school board, which wants the parents and students to leave.
Mr.
Cortines visited with the parents holding Public School 156 at 104 Sutter Avenue yesterday morning -- less than 12 hours after his visit to the school Wednesday night.
Later he met with the local board in District 23, which includes Ocean Hill and Brownsville.


SALOMON INC. (N)
Salomon Inc.'s $20 million third-quarter profit, announced yesterday, was lower than expected because of a $173 million pretax loss that its SaloBrothers unit had trading for its own account.
It was the second time in the last three quarters that Salomon, one of the most aggressive trading firms on Wall Street, lost money trading its own account.


Gangs in Sarajevo Spread Terror, Unchecked by the Cowed Leaders
One evening this week, Swiss officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross, driving in a vehicle marked with the organization's distinctive red and white insignia, were followed through Sarajevo's darkened streets by a car carrying two armed men in the uniforms of the Bosnian Army.
Outside the Red Cross's sandbagged headquarters, the gunmen robbed the Swiss representatives of their flak jackets and their two-way radios, then drove off.
As events are measured in Sarajevo, where 12,000 people have been killed in the last 18 months by artillery and sniper fire, the robbery was a minor incident.
But it was part of a growing pattern of robberies, killings and other lawlessness that threatens to overwhelm the shaky structures that pass for a government in this besieged city.
Dozens Killed by Gangs
More and more, the residents of Sarajevo are speaking of the city as a "new Beirut," a place once celebrated for its cultured ways that is descending into chaos.
As in the Lebanese capital, armed gangs have profited from the disorder of war to turn whole neighborhoods into personal fiefs.


Review/Film; Fencing as Metaphor for Honor and the Lack Thereof
"By the Sword" is a half-baked little movie about modern fencing as a sport and a way of life.
F.
Murray Abraham and Eric Roberts star in the film, which was directed by Jeremy Kagan and written by John McDonald and James Donadio.
It opens today at the Loews 34th Street Showplace.
Mr.
Abraham plays Maximilian Suba, a once-ambitious fencing wizard who has spent the last 25 years in prison, atoning for the murder of his mentor during a fencing match.
Mr.
Roberts is Alexander Villard, the murdered man's son.


India Growth
Shares in the India Growth Fund, which invests in the Indian stock market, have risen steadily since May.
Stuart B. Goldberg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said investors seemed encouraged by economic changes initiated by the Indian Government.
But he cautioned that funds tied to markets of developing countries can be volatile.


Quaker Oats Co.  reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30


3 Are Injured In Wild Spree By Students
A violent midafternoon spree by students at feuding Brooklyn high schools spread from a schoolyard to two nearby subway stations and finally to a city bus yesterday, the authorities said.
Three people were injured: a 15-year-old student who was seriously hurt when he was stabbed with a machete, and two other students who were beaten.


The Brothers Gretzky
BRENT GRETZKY couldn't look his brother in the eyes.
"I was too nervous," the Tampa Bay rookie said Wednesday night, describing the first face-off of his pro career against his older brother and nine-time National Hockey League most valuable player, WAYNE.
"The second time I got him with a stick, and the third time, I think he knew what I was going to do," Brent said.
"After that, I was able to look at him."


Make a Left on Andre
ANDRE AGASSI's name will soon be appearing on Las Vegas, Nev., maps.
Clark County commissioners have approved the naming of two streets after Agassi that border the player's southwest Las Vegas enclave: Andre Drive and Agassi Court.
Agassi had requested that the two streets, which run past his four lots, be named Agassi Avenue and Agassi Lane.
But county officials opposed that request because it conflicted with a policy that requires streets be given different names when they are at right angles to each other.

NEW YORK CITY  LAWYERS' VERDICT ON GIULIANI
In picking their next mayor, New Yorkers will choose between an incumbent whose work they have watched closely for four years and a challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose professional career is far less familiar to most of them.
But one group of New Yorkers undoubtedly knows Mr.
Giuliani best: the lawyers who have seen him work.

Ukraine to Keep Chernobyl in Operation
The Ukrainian Parliament voted today to continue nuclear energy production at the Chernobyl power plant, reversing its decision of two years ago to shut the power station down by the end of 1993 because of safety concerns.
Chernobyl is the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear disaster in 1986, an explosion that forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people and contaminated hundreds of square miles.
Estimates of the death toll range from 32, the official figure, to thousands of people who some authorities say may die prematurely.


Nynex Corp.  reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30


A.T.&amp;T. and MCI Show Increases in Net Income
The nation's two largest long-distance carriers yesterday reported higher third-quarter earnings and revenues.
But the MCI Communications Corporation, the No. 2 carrier, reported a stronger performance than A.T.&amp; T., and analysts increased their earnings projections for MCI.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said quarterly earnings increased 11.4 percent and revenue was up about 3 percent.


Washington Talk; Dole Tries To Rein In President, But Slips
In foreign policy as in domestic policy, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas can play good cop / bad cop with President Clinton.
As a good cop, Mr.
Dole has offered to work with the Administration to overhaul the health care system, and he helped orchestrate a compromise resolution on Somalia last week that averted a collision between the President and Congress.


If You Have a Good Game, They Will Watch, and Stay
If World Series viewers must stay up past midnight, they apparently prefer a competitive game to keep their eyelids from drooping.
The viewing pattern for Game 3 Tuesday night showed a nation falling asleep as Toronto and Philadelphia slow-danced to the Blue Jays' 10-3 victory.


Samuel Lerner, 85, Professor at Brown
Samuel Lerner, a former professor of engineering and director of construction planning for Brown University, died on Wednesday at his home in Providence, R.I.
He was 85.
The cause was complications from cancer, his family said.


Officer Cleared in Main Tailhook Case
The Marine Corps dropped all charges today against a Marine captain who had been charged with sexually molesting the admiral's aide and Navy aviator who first spoke out about the debauchery that occurred at the 1991 Tailhook Association convention.
In essence, the Marine Corps decided that the aide, Lieut.
Paula Coughlin, might have identified the wrong man, and it dismissed the most celebrated case that arose out of the Tailhook affair.


Masur Makes Music With Old Friends
IF it's Friday, this must be New York.
And yes, that's Avery Fisher Hall.
But no, that isn't the New York Philharmonic onstage.
Kurt Masur might be forgiven, these days, for not quite knowing if he's coming or going.
As music director of the Philharmonic, he led the orchestra last December in concerts commemorating its 150th anniversary and took it on an anniversary tour of Europe in the spring.
On April 7, the Philharmonic played in the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, Germany, less than a month after the Gewandhaus Orchestra, of which Mr.
Masur has been music director since 1970, celebrated its 250th birthday.


Yolanda Serrano, 45, Organizer Of Anti-AIDS Needle Exchanges
Yolanda Serrano, the head of a private addiction and AIDS prevention organization in New York City that fought for the distribution of free needles and syringes to prevent infection, died yesterday at St.
Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center.
She was 45.
Her associates said the cause was cancer.


Reassuring Eastern Europe, Christopher Praises Hungary's Reforms
Secretary of State Warren Christopher cast himself in the role of diplomatic booster today, praising Hungary's economic and political reforms in Budapest and signaling his staunch support for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
In Hungary, Mr.
Christopher's first visit to an Eastern European country in his nine months as Secretary of State, the Secretary sought to assuage Hungarian fears that the United States does not care sufficiently about the problems facing Eastern Europe.


Conner Peripherals Has $372.4 Million Loss
Conner Peripherals Inc., the troubled computer disk drive maker, reported today a third-quarter loss of $372.4 million and said it was laying off 12 percent of its work force.
It said the loss included $330 million in special charges for the layoffs, a restructuring and other items.
Among the charges, $78 million is associated with the layoff of approximately 1,100 employees, 450 of whom have been released in the last two months.
The rest will be laid off over the next several months.


Review/Theater; Family Genetics With a Background of Wagner
"The Twilight of the Golds," Jonathan Tolins's calculatingly topical play, which opened at the Booth Theater last night, would like us to consider a multitude of big questions: eugenics, the true breadth of tolerance among self-defined liberals and the limits of family love.
But the principal moral to be gleaned from it is of a different order altogether: If you're writing a small, facile comic melodrama -- which, in spite of its painfully lofty ambitions, is all this play is at best -- it's definitely not a good idea to drag in Wagner's "Ring" cycle as your central point of reference.
Weighted with this cultural baggage, what might otherwise have seemed merely slight becomes embarrassingly infinitesimal.
And in the wake of similarly themed, more successfully ambitious plays, like "Pterodactyls" (let alone "Angels in America"), it shrinks all the more.


A Candidate's Colleagues Render a Mixed Verdict
In picking their next mayor, New Yorkers will choose between an incumbent, David N. Dinkins, whose work they have watched for four years and a challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose professional career is far less familiar.
But one group of New Yorkers would seem to know Mr.
Giuliani best: the lawyers who have seen him work for much of the last 20 years.
They saw him develop as a young assistant Federal prosecutor in Manhattan and watched him during his short stints in private practice.
Like everyone else, they remember him most vividly from his years as United States Attorney in Manhattan.


Adventures in Daveland (and Not Just at Night)
SOMETIMES television viewers begin to think of the characters they watch as real people.
Psychologists have a term for this.
The viewer, they say, has entered into a "parasocial relationship" with the figures on the small screen.
The psychologists do not have a term for what has happened to the people who work near the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway and 54th Street in Manhattan, the new home of "Late Show With David Letterman."


Blast Prosecutors Making Case, Shard by Shard
A piece of a brake drum, some shreds of burned tire, a hinge with flecks of yellow paint, the twisted wreckage of a wheel, pieces of manifold and an alternator -- these were among the items displayed to the jury yesterday as prosecutors, testing the patience of the judge and risking losing the attention of the jury, continued, slowly and methodically, to build their case against the four men accused of blowing up the World Trade Center last Feb. 26.
The prosecution's theory, outlined in the opening statement of the chief prosecutor, J. Gilmore Childers, when the trial opened three weeks ago, is that the bomb was brought into the underground parking garage of the trade center in a yellow Ford Econoline van that had been rented three days earlier at a New Jersey Ryder rental agency by one of the defendants, Mohammed A. Salameh.


Don't Leap to Conclusions About Genius
To the Editor:
"An Old Idea About Genius Wins New Scientific Support" (Science Times, Oct. 12) reviews fascinating new evidence for the hypothesis that "madness" and genius are associated.
It appears that a disproportionate number of great artists have suffered from various psychological disorders.
Furthermore, exciting new neurological discoveries suggest that the brain activity characteristic of these disorders may well provide the basis for the creative process.
That is, it is proposed that the disorders cause the genius.


Diner's Journal
Culinary Melting Pot
In restaurants, fusion, the melding of more than one cuisine, seems to be the latest style.
Starting Nov. 1, New Yorkers can find it at Shin's, 109 West 56th Street in the Parker Meridien Hotel, (212) 708-7444.
The restaurant's opening, originally scheduled for last week, was delayed to permit last-minute fine-tuning.
Shin offers Japanese food with a Western spin, with dishes like smoked salmon salad with a mint vinaigrette, grilled scallops with Japanese mushrooms and truffles, and a Japanese-style lobster bouillabaisse.
The menu is long and complex.


Missing the Glory
After months of drift, this could have been a time when President Clinton basked in the glory of a national drug strategy that answered the prayers of the country's drug experts.
Instead, he is being hammered from all points of the political compass.
A consensus appeared to be developing on Capitol Hill and elsewhere that after years of failures and frustration, it would be wise to put a lot more effort into drug rehabilitation and anti-drug education, and that is what President Clinton seemed to be promising in the strategy he issued on Wednesday.
But he refused to say whether he was willing to commit money to make it happen.


Bernard Smith, 70, Ex-District Attorney And State Legislator
Bernard C. Smith Sr., a former State Senator and District Attorney for Suffolk County, died on Tuesday at Kingston Hospital in Kingston, N.Y.
He was 70 and lived in Northport, L.I.
The cause was an inoperable brain tumor, his family said.
Mr.
Smith, an outdoorsman and hunter, was vacationing with two of his sons at their summer retreat in the Catskills.


No Settlement, or Deadline, For G.M. and Auto Workers
The delicate labor contract negotiations between the United Automobile Workers union, which is trying to preserve an industrywide pact, and the General Motors Corporation, which is pressing for concessions, have reached a strangely upbeat standoff with no agreement but also no strike deadline.
Both sides have been predicting an imminent settlement for a week.
So far, G.M. has agreed to most of the basic package of wages and benefits in the pattern-setting contract negotiated with the Ford Motor Company last month, Owen F. Bieber, the U.A.W. president, told union leaders today in a closed meeting.
But G.M. is still haggling over two expensive and complex issues: pension benefits and job security funds.

Perot Ad to Attack Trade Pact
United We Stand America, the political group of Ross Perot, said today that it had produced a half-hour television commercial criticizing the North American Free Trade Agreement that will be broadcast in large cities on Sunday.
Only one station, in Chicago, has so far agreed to broadcast the advertisement, but negotiations have begun with other stations, the group said.


MCDONALD'S CORP. (N)
The record third-quarter financial performance reported by the McDonald's Corporation yesterday was much stronger than the figures indicated, analysts said.
"A lot of their results are masked by lower currency rates and the effects of the new tax law," said Barry D. Ziegler, an analyst with A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons.
The effective income tax rate for McDonald's increased to 35.7 percent for 1993, compared with 33.8 percent the previous two years.


Cable Rates Have Risen For Many, F.C.C. Says
Preliminary results of a new Federal survey indicate that about one-third of all cable television customers saw their rates rise rather than fall after new pricing regulations went into effect on Sept. 1.
But the Federal Communications Commission, which carried out the survey, said the data were so complicated and confusing that the agency would not be able to figure out the bottom line for consumers until some time next month.


Review/Art; An Expanded Sense Of Pollock's Vision, Rendered in Miniature
Jackson Pollock's greatness is not an unknown quantity, but there are aspects of it that even today, nearly 40 years after his death, can still be dramatically illuminated.
Just such a drama unfolds in a small, stunning show of the artist's paintings on paper at C&amp;M Arts, a gallery that occupies the generous foyer and dining room of the Upper East Side town house belonging to Robert Mnuchin, an art collector turned art dealer.
The 15 works on view were made by Pollock in 1948 and 1949, when he was creating, on canvas, some of his greatest and most influential drip paintings.
The selections at C&amp;M Arts are also drip paintings, and also great, but they are relatively small, executed for the most part on paper measuring no more than 22 by 30 inches.
At first they seem a little overwrought and precious, even miniaturized, like the Pollock equivalent of Faberge eggs, although this analogy may be encouraged by their luxe surroundings.


Janet Reno's Heavy Hand
This week a new film called "The Program" that got so-so reviews -- and so-so attendance -- got an unexpected jolt of publicity.
Because they emulated a scene in which several drunken football players lie in the middle of a busy highway, one teen-ager is dead and two are critically injured.
The kids forgot that "The Program" was only a movie, and as such only a simulacrum.
In real life, people who play chicken with cars court death.
As they did.
Today an expurgated version of "The Program" arrives at the nation's theaters.
The Walt Disney Company, whose subsidiary Touchstone produced the film, has deleted the scene.
The decision is thoughtful, even pious, but it sets a terrible precedent.
Having to worry about attracting an audience is tough enough.
Having to worry that somebody in the audience might confuse shadow with substance and behave accordingly is devastating, because self-censorship is a sure-fire way to smother imagination.


Books of The Times; The (Once and Future?) Kings of the Court Reflect

Michael on Michael

Photographs by Walter Iooss Jr. 112 pages.
Collins Publishers San Francisco.
Hardcover, $50; paperback, $25.
Shaq Attaq!
By Shaquille O'Neal with Jack McCallum
Illustrated. 202 pages. Hyperion. $22.95.
There is a Walter Iooss photograph in Michael Jordan's new book that sums up our collective memory of this dazzling athlete's basketball career.
It is a photo from one of the Chicago Bulls' playoff games against the Knicks last spring, and it shows Jordan elevating toward the basket, over the heads of every other player on the court, propelled toward the rafters of Chicago Stadium and the pantheon of athletic immortals by some magical combination of talent, will and grace.
In the stop action of the shutter, he is caught forever suspended in midair: the man who learned to defy gravity and fly.


Abroad at Home; The Road to Panic
Of all the recent setbacks for American foreign policy, none is as damaging to President Clinton's credibility as the humiliation in Haiti.
Events there raise urgent questions -- for him as for us -- about the quality of the advice he is getting, and of his own leadership.
The excuses offered for failure in Bosnia and Somalia are not available in Haiti.
One cannot say, as is said of American inaction on the Bosnian genocide, that the first responsibility is Europe's.
Mr.
Clinton did not, as in Somalia, inherit an ill-thought-out policy from President Bush.


MOBIL CORP. (N)
The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that its 40 percent rise in third-quarter operating profit was the result of higher international oil production, strong margins in refinery operations, and increased sales of its petroleum products.
These gains, as well as a rise in natural-gas prices and increased oil production in Nigeria, more than offset a $4-a-barrel drop in worldwide crude oil prices, to the lowest level in five years.


Autopsy Tape Gets at Unvarnished Truth
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 17 news article discusses the possibility of some homicide convictions being reversed because of the failure of prosecutors to provide defendants with a copy of the medical examiner's tape recording of the autopsy.
The article highlights a prosecutor's quip that trials are no longer about a search for truth but about a search for paper, referring to the requirement that the defense be furnished with a copy of all police reports and prior statements of witnesses.


Coleman Calls Off Talks Until End of the Season
Derrick Coleman, the Nets' power forward, said yesterday that he was breaking off contract negotiations with the club and would put them off until the end of the season.
Coleman and his attorney, Harold MacDonald, had set a deadline of next Monday to reach agreement on a contract extension to begin next year.
But MacDonald said yesterday that the two sides were too far apart to achieve a deal by then and that Coleman preferred to concentrate on helping the Nets to a winning season.


'Le Nozze di Figaro'
The season's first performance of the New York City Opera production of Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro" is to take place tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center.

Scott Bergeson conducts.
The production is by John Copley.
Tickets are $15 to $60.

Inside Art
White House Walls
Kaki Hockersmith's choice of art for the White House walls is still a state secret.
And it will continue to be, White House officials say, until the Little Rock decorator has put every last knickknack in place.
Judging from one recent selection, however, it looks as though the paintings will go beyond the traditional and the predictable.
This fall, Ms.
Hockersmith flew to New York City to visit Lisa de Kooning, who showed Ms.
Hockersmith a selection of later works by her father, Willem de Kooning.
The decorator selected a lyrical painting from 1983, "Untitled XXXIX."


QVC NETWORK TRIES TO WIN PARAMOUNT WITH A HOSTILE BID
The fight for Paramount Communications became hostile yesterday, as QVC Network Inc. decided to bypass the Paramount board and take its offer directly to the shareholders.
Furious over the Paramount board's slowness to negotiate a merger through a previous $9.5 billion offer, QVC said it would offer Paramount's stockholders an $80-a-share all-cash deal for 51 percent of the company.
The rest of the company would be purchased with shares of QVC stock.
The overall value of the deal remains $9.5 billion.


Herbert Osborne, 96, Ex-Banking Executive
Herbert J. Osborne, an executive for more than 40 years with the bank that grew into the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Mountainside, N.J.
He was 96 and had lived in Summit, N.J., most of his life.
He died of natural causes, his family said.

Four Men Wounded in Shooting on a Brooklyn Street Corner
Two men drove up to a street corner in Brooklyn yesterday, slowed their car to a stop and opened fire on four other men standing in the afternoon drizzle, the police said.
It took a moment, as the white station wagon raced away, before stunned bystanders came to the aid of the men, who were seriously wounded, said a police spokesman, Officer Andrew McInnis.


News Flash: McGaughey Loses One
A young filly named Shapely Scrapper not only won the 71st running of the Astarita Stakes at Aqueduct yesterday but also outran one of the prize young fillies trained by Shug McGaughey, and that's becoming a mark of distinction these days.
Last Saturday, McGaughey made history by saddling the winners of five major stakes races on the afternoon of the Breeders' Cup Preview at Belmont Park.
One of his big winners was the 2-year-old filly Heavenly Prize, who won the Frizette Stakes while the undefeated favorite, Strategic Maneuver, was running last.
Strategic Maneuver was troubled by congestion in her lungs, and might not go to Santa Anita for the Breeders' Cup on Nov. 6.
But McGaughey will be there with Heavenly Prize, who was back in the barn yesterday while the trainer was sending out yet another promising filly, Brighter Course, who had finished third and first in her two starts.


Gene Tie to Male Violence Is Studied
Scientists have identified a tiny genetic defect that appears to predispose some men toward aggression, impulsiveness and violence, a discovery that is likely to rekindle the harsh debate over the causes of criminal and abnormal behavior.
Researchers emphasized, however, that the finding was thus far limited to a single large family, and that the inherited illness was likely to be quite rare in the general population.


Prosecutor Appointed In Balkan War Trials
The Security Council today unanimously appointed Venezuela's Attorney General, Ramon Escovar-Salom, as the prosecutor charged with bringing war criminals in the Balkans to justice before the special war crimes tribunal it has already created.
Mr.
Escovar-Salom, who is 67, played a key role in forcing Carlos Andres Perez to resign as President of Venezuela last May in order to stand trial on official corruption charges.


Town Meeting's Agenda: Way of Life
DEMOCRACY materialized here out of a cool dark night this week and presented itself modestly and thoughtfully, unaccompanied by bugles, bunting or patriotic slogans.
It appeared, instead, as just plain folks, who walked in twos and threes into the auditorium of the Pine Island Elementary School in the heart of Orange County's onion fields.
They came to talk about the town they live in, about the quality of their lives here and about what kind of place they would like their town to be.
Some feared the future, some were nostalgic for the past.
But each one had decided that staying home and keeping quiet could be as dangerous as the issues that worry them: unbridled development, higher taxes and the disappearance of small-town life.

Leslie Kamen and Steve Keister
Mitchell Algus Gallery  25 Thompson Street  SoHo  Through Oct. 30
This small gallery on the remote southern edge of SoHo (it's not on the route to anything, except maybe the A train) often has imaginative shows.
Its current exhibition is barely an exhibition at all, consisting of one work each by two artists.

The bond market sold off across the board yesterday as traders and investors worried about the possibility of faster economic growth and higher inflation.
But the lesson was not that interest rates are moving sharply higher.
Nor was it that the economic fundamentals of sluggish growth and low inflation, which have underpinned this year's bond rally, have changed significantly.
Rather, it was that the market will continue to be volatile and easily rattled, even by what are normally considered second-tier economic reports.

Jays' Hopes Are Trapped By Chance
Trailing by 2-0 in the eighth inning tonight, the Blue Jays finally had a rally going against Phillies right-hander Curt Schilling.
With none out, Willie Canate, pinch-running for Pat Borders after the catcher had singled, hurried to third on Rob Butler's pinch-hit single.
But on Rickey Henderson's grounder to Schilling, Canate was caught in a rundown.
Butler stopped at second.


The Talk of Hollywood; From Target of Reno's Attack, an Uneasy Defense
Attorney General Janet Reno's threat on Wednesday that the Government will take action unless the television industry curbs violent programs has left television and movie executives rushing for cover.
A number of these executives said they were puzzled by Ms.
Reno's warning, which came in the aftermath of several tragedies apparently linked to a movie and a television program.
In one group of incidents, a teen-ager died and several other teen-agers were injured as they imitated a scene in "The Program," a current Walt Disney Company film about football, in which some players lie in the middle of a busy road to prove their toughness.
As soon as the real-life incidents occurred, the Disney Company took the unusual step of saying it would remove the scene from all 1,222 prints of the film and would recall the coming-attractions trailer for the film.

More Signs of a Productive U.S.
Contrary to a widely held view that the United States is an industrial has-been whose productivity in manufacturing has been surpassed in some other countries, a new study concludes that for manufacturing as a whole, the United States still holds a significant edge over the presumed world standard-setters, Germany and Japan.
The yearlong study -- by the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company, together with three of the nation's top experts on productivity including Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics -- combined research into nine industries with a wide array of available statistics.

Correction: Report On Rape in Bosnia
A front-page article and headline on Wednesday reported that a United Nations war crimes commission had found evidence that rape had been used by Serbian forces as a weapon of terror in the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The article said that the commission had examined reports of about 3,000 rapes, in which 800 victims had been identified by name, and that the commission said it was inclined to believe that this evidence showed that rape had been used as a weapon of war.

Buying a Vacant Lot: Permits, Fees and Other Obstacles
After shopping around for a house, Walter and Judy Sweeney, 28 and 27, decided to buy land and build their own home.
With a budget of $64,000, they began looking in areas they could afford.
Mr.
Sweeney, an electrician, and Mrs.
Sweeney, a receptionist, soon discovered that buying land is no simple task.
"We found that there was no single place we could go to get all the information we needed," Mr.
Sweeney said.
Here is a chronology of their land-buying venture, which began in May 1989, when they first spotted their half-acre lot.


Senate Ethics Panel Seeking To View Packwood Diaries
The Senate ethics committee's inquiry into accusations of sexual misconduct by Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon boiled over today into a public feud over whether the panel has an unfettered right to read the Senator's voluminous private diaries.
The Senate Select Committee on Ethics maintains that it does, and disclosed that it has subpoenaed all of Mr.
Packwood's diaries dating to 1989.
The panel asked the full Senate late Thursday for permission to enforce the subpoena in Federal court.

Instead of being back home at the Carrier Dome, Derrick Coleman was back home recovering from an extracted wisdom tooth tonight as the Nets played the Boston Celtics here in a preseason game.
Without their power forward, the Nets managed to hang with Boston for about a quarter before the Celtics spurted out to a 108-98 victory before a crowd of 10,674, most of whom booed loudly when it was announced that Coleman, a former Syracuse star, was absent.

"The numbers are still going up, but they are not going up as fast as they have in recent years."

Sports of The Times; Basketball Isn't the Only Way Out
GEORGE RAVELING is upset.
Southern Cal's basketball coach, along with others in the Black Coaches Association, believes that black basketball players are being discriminated against by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.
Fueling his anger is the drop in men's Division I basketball scholarships from 15 two years ago to 14 last season to 13 this season, the last proposed cutoff.
"Black student-athletes are disproportionately affected by these regulations," Raveling said earlier this week.
"They represent about 64 percent of the players playing Division I basketball. Over a 10-year period, that represents about 3,000 scholarships, lost opportunities for Afro-Americans."

Review/Jazz; Making the Repertory Of the Hallowed Past Into Something New
For the most part, the repertory movement in jazz has stayed within fairly limiting boundaries, reproducing as idiomatically as possible the arrangements and styles of bands of the past.
That has suddenly changed.
On Thursday night, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, led by the trumpeter Jon Faddis through a group of tunes associated with Benny Goodman, gave notice that arrangements are no longer sacrosanct.
Where other repertory groups might change the emphasis in an interpretation, or open up solo space beyond the constraints of the original three-minute recording of a piece, the Carnegie Hall band radically rewrote the material.
The historical and creative liberty the band took comes not a moment too soon.
It happened during the second half of the show, when the band began to play some Goodman tunes newly arranged by its pianist, Jim McNeely.
It started with "Air Mail Special," then moved into "Stompin' at the Savoy" and "King Porter Stomp." Each of these pieces featured odd touches, and some nice, sly dissonances that seemed to cram too many notes into too small a space; "King Porter Stomp" had two clarinets harmonizing on the melody.

In addition to the 25 people killed, 36 were injured by Indian troops, according to hospitals in the capital and reports from outlying towns.

Those Rag-Tag Phillies Sport Fancy Leather
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 22 --
One can never quite figure out just what it is with the Philadelphia Phillies, so it's not unusual that one of the stranger twists of the 1993 World Series is that the National League champions aren't being forced to be defensive about their defense.
In fact, the Series against the Toronto Blue Jays has been devoid of Phillies fielding blunders.
So much so that to this point it's hard to believe this is the same team that often left the field in the playoffs against Atlanta either red-faced or ashen.


Hevesi Takes New Tone on Badillo in Race for Comptroller


Extortion Tied to Lax Supervision
It was conceived as a novel remedy to cure a chronic New York City corruption problem.
Every workday, 2,000 building inspectors would make their rounds dressed in gleaming green uniforms with one item missing -- pockets.
In 1966, exasperated by an unending wave of graft and extortion arrests in his agency, Charles G. Moerdler, who was then the Buildings Commissioner, decided that a drastic symbol was needed to show City Hall's determination to prevent corruption.
Requiring inspectors to don pocketless uniforms, he said, would make them easily recognizable and deter them from accepting bribes to overlook code violations or to expedite the opening of new buildings.

The fans leaping the white fences at Khalifa Stadium were Saudis, and they were beside themselves with joy.


Maurice Dolbier, 81, Book Editor and Writer
Maurice Dolbier, a former book editor of The New York Herald Tribune and The Providence Journal-Bulletin, an actor and the author of children's books, died on Wednesday in Hallworth House, a nursing home in Providence, R.I.
He was 81.
Mr.
Dolbier wrote two novels, six children's books and several plays.
He became literary editor of The Journal in 1951 and a book reviewer at The Tribune in 1956, but returned to The Journal in 1967 after The Tribune and its successor, The World Journal Tribune, closed.


An Arts Center Takes Off Like 40,000 Honey Bees
With painstaking care, an artist has moved 40,000 honey bees from Oakland to the Center for the Arts at Yerba Buena Gardens, a new arts center in San Francisco that seeks to draw people out of their neighborhoods and into the city's center.
For the inaugural exhibition, which opened last week, the bees' hive was lowered the 20 feet from an open skylight to the gallery floor a little bit each day for a month to acclimate the bees to their new location.
The center itself has been more than 25 years in the making, a laborious civic process that has involved five mayors, many financial problems (an early investor, Olympia &amp; York, went bankrupt), several lawsuits and countless discussions among advisory committees in the last decade over what kind of art and performance to show.


Clinton and Congress Discuss 3-Year Test of the Trade Pact
Administration officials and Congressional leaders are discussing whether the United States should enter into the North American Free Trade Agreement experimentally, with a review after three years to determine whether the agreement causes widespread layoffs or lower wages.

Attention Shoppers: In Aisle 1, Flu Shots (Supply Is Limited)
Inside the Kroger Supermarket on Delhi Pike here, down Aisle 1 just past a tangle of shopping carts and signs promoting "Double Coupons," between the shelves of baked goods and displays of Cocoa Pebbles and Cheerios, there was a shoppers' special: flu shots.
Several hundred people lined up here today to get their vaccinations and their groceries all at once as part of an effort sponsored by the local chapter of the Visiting Nurses Association, an organization for nurses who provide home care.
The group is sponsoring vaccination programs in 80 cities around the country; the nurses predict they will eventually vaccinate about 800,000 people.

Head of Dockers to Lead Stride Rite
Robert Siegel was perfectly happy in his current position, as president of Dockers U.S.A.
The seven-year-old division of Levi Strauss &amp; Company in San Francisco was enormously successful, with more than $1 billion in revenues.
Yet an offer from the Stride Rite Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., was too good to pass up: a chance to run the company as chairman, president and chief executive, applying all the brand-marketing techniques that made Dockers products a phenomenon in the men's apparel industry as comfortable, stylish casual wear.
He would also gain leadership of a worldwide work force of nearly seven times the 600 people under his command at Dockers.


Treatment of Bulgarian Jews Not Untarnished; Scrolls' Hiding Place
To the Editor:
The letter telling the story of "How the Danes Also Rescued the Torah Scrolls" (Oct. 9) requires correction.
The scrolls were indeed hidden, but not in a "Roman Catholic church across the street." They were hidden in a state Lutheran church -- the Trinity Church -- next to the Round Tower, a block from the Copenhagen Synagogue.

A Wise Stand-Down in Somalia
President Clinton was right to order this week's withdrawal of 750 Army Rangers from Somalia, calling off their no-win hunt for a hostile local warlord.
This by no means ends American involvement in a United Nations operation, since 6,300 U.S. troops remain in Somalia, and 3,600 U.S. marines are deployed offshore.
But Mr.
Clinton seems finally to realize that commando raids and the civilian deaths that result from them can't cure what is ailing Somalia.
Taken together, the changed approach suggests that Mr.
Clinton has heeded an aroused Congress and widespread bafflement over a humanitarian mission that by degrees turned into a bloody vendetta.
Washington's new course does not mean Americans reject U.N. peacekeeping, but rather its muddled misapplication.

Parents Agree To Suspend School Sit-In
Exhausted from their five-day protest, the parents who took over an elementary school in Brooklyn won an agreement last night to leave the school for the weekend on the condition that they can resume the occupation of the school on Monday morning.
A lawyer for the city said the agreement was not an acknowledgment of the protesters' right to take over the school, Public School 156 in Brownsville.
Rather, he said, the measure was agreed on by all sides -- the 50 or so parents, School Board 23 and Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines -- primarily out of concern for the safety of the parents and children in the school.

Failla Won't Be The Irish's Wally Pipp
The players in the gold helmets were yelling as they entered the dressing room in Michigan Stadium more than a month ago.
In the afterglow of a surprising 27-23 victory over Michigan, one that established Notre Dame as a contender for a national championship, Paul Failla began to deal with conflicting emotions.
Failla was part of a celebration, but not a central part.
He had competed for the quarterback position with Kevin McDougal.
He had injured a thumb, and now McDougal had become an essential part of a major victory.
Failla thought of the name Wally Pipp.
Maybe, after all this work, he would be cast in the role of Wally Pipp while McDougal became Lou Gehrig for the rest of the season.
"That was the point when I said, 'Maybe I won't get my chance,' " Failla said.

Prosecutor to Ask New Indictments Against Texas Senator After Legal Snag
The District Attorney in Austin, Tex., said today that he would seek new indictments against United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison after a legal technicality forced him to dismiss indictments handed down by a grand jury last month.
The District Attorney, Ronnie Earle, said he was forced to drop the original charges in the case against Senator Hutchison, as well as indictments in 300 other cases, because lawyers for Mrs.
Hutchison had discovered that 1 of the 12 grand jurors who indicted her last month had an outstanding warrant charging him with writing a bad check for $20.04 to a grocery store five years ago.

Schroeder is the prohibition against her profiting financially from the notoriety she has created by the crime, her fugitive years, the decision to turn herself in or imprisonment.


The Broadcast Wars, Continued
It attests to the power of PAC money, ethnic lobbying and closed-door back-scratching that a House-Senate conference committee could not agree on killing a useless boondoggle known as TV Marti.
At a taxpayer cost of $60,000 a day, this Spanish-language station broadcasts news and entertainment to Cuba -- from 3:30 A.M. to 6 A.M., to avoid violating global signal agreements.
Successive reviews have called for closing the station, but the conferees would create yet another advisory panel to determine if TV Marti is technically sound and is actually watched by anybody in Cuba.


Some Consumer Stocks Are Back in the Saddle
STOCKS of consumer product companies turned in some pitiful performances in the first nine months of 1993.
The defining moment for the group was Marlboro Friday, April 2, when Philip Morris announced it would cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes.
The stock plummeted, touching off a rout in tobacco companies and ultimately in a broad group of consumer companies.
The losers included Johnson &amp; Johnson, Procter &amp; Gamble, General Mills and Anheuser-Busch.


WASHINGTON MAYOR SEEKS AID OF GUARD IN COMBATING CRIME
With the number of drug-related slayings in the nation's capital rising, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly asked President Clinton today for authority to call up the National Guard to help in policing the city.
The President said he was sympathetic to the problem and would seriously consider the request, which was a stark admission by the Mayor that the city, already one of the most heavily policed in the country, was at a loss to slow the slayings on its own.


Greeks' Heritage Lies in Macedonia
To the Editor:
Your comments on Greece's position vis-a-vis Skopje, under the awkward title "The Prodigal Returns in Greece" (editorial, Oct. 12) fail to recognize that Macedonia in Greece is something more than a mere province -- that is, it is the Macedonia of the Greek kings Philip II and Alexander the Great.


Staying Afloat in a Sea of Information
Picking a mutual fund keeps getting more complicated.
As funds multiply, so do the publications and services rating them.
Investors navigating the sea of stars, arrows and letter grades can quickly lose their bearings.

It rated three upward arrows from Business Week earlier this year -- the magazine's highest accolade.

Where It All Started Seems Evident, Why Is Still Unclear
The source of yesterday's commuter misery near Times Square was a spot between the downtown local and express tracks on the Eighth Avenue subway line, about 150 feet north of the platform at 42d Street.
It was at that location that about five feet of plastic cable insulation burned, but transit officials said yesterday that they were not yet certain of the cause of the fire, which began with a series of loud pops in front of an approaching southbound C train.
At that location, the third rail that supplies electricity to downtown locals switches from the left side of the tracks to the right.
This is a standard design, to keep the third rail as far from the platform as possible, according to Jared Lebow, a spokesman for the Transit Authority.


Series Ring Would Fit Stewart Perfectly
Dave Stewart knew it would be his last huge contract as a baseball player.
Grab the money, pitch two more years, inflate the bank account and then disappear.
It could have been so simple.
But Stewart did not accept the most lavish offer he received as a free agent last winter.
He reached for the potential ring.
Although at least two teams, including the Yankees, offered him a superior deal to Toronto's two-year, $8.5 million contract, Stewart was not swayed by dollar signs.
He was looking for signs that pointed to playing in late October.

CLINTON WILL VISIT YELTSIN FOR TALKS AT START OF 1994
President Clinton will meet Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, in Moscow in mid-January as part of the Administration's campaign to support Mr.
Yeltsin's struggle to transform his country into a free-market democracy.
The trip, announced today by Secretary of State Warren Christopher at a joint news conference here with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, is also evidently intended to enhance Mr.
Clinton's standing as a statesman and divert the spotlight from the Administration's foreign policy setbacks in Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia.
The Administration would clearly like to focus attention on its support for democratization in Russia, the foreign policy area where the Clinton Administration feels it has been most successful.

Today's Public Needs to Be Enlightened About Breast-Feeding
To the Editor:
It is a pity that some feminists take a narrow view of breast-feeding as "just another male trick to keep women at home" ("Nursing Becomes a Feminist Battlefield," The Week in Review, Oct. 10).
No doubt this attitude stems partly from the tacit assumption that although breast milk contains a few maternal antibodies, formula is really about the same, is more convenient and obviously is good enough for most growing babies.

Treatment of Bulgarian Jews Not Untarnished
To the Editor:
Michael Bar-Zohar is certainly right to extol the humanity of Bulgarians during the Holocaust ("Bulgaria, Too, Rescued Jews From Hitler," letter, Oct. 16).
An unlikely alliance of King Boris III, the Eastern Orthodox Church, members of the Fascist establishment and underground Communists and Socialists managed to save the Jews of "Old" Bulgaria from deportations to the death camps.


Corporate Bond Group Carries a Load
Funds with loads, or upfront sales commissions, dominate the corporate bond group.
The highest-ranking no-load fund, Harbor, is 13th on the list of 176 corporate bond funds.

Review/Dance; Southern Expression, in Universal Idiom
Tennessee Dance Theater is proudly regional, specializing in works on Southern themes.
But this Nashville-based modern-dance troupe is far from provincial.
It refuses to wallow in sentimental folksiness.
Its standard of dancing is high and its choreography is rich in inventiveness as well as local color.
On Sunday afternoon at Symphony Space, it offered "Quilts," an ambitious and varied piece by its artistic directors, Donna Rizzo and Andrew Krichels.
Each section of this three-part production could stand alone on a program with other dances; performed together, the episodes complemented one another in style and mood.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP. (N)
The Kimberly-Clark Corporation said yesterday that its third-quarter net income fell 17.5 percent, with more than half of the decline attributed to a $13.5 million adjustment for higher Federal income taxes under the 1993 tax law.
The adjustment reduced earnings by 8 cents a share.
Kimberly-Clark, based in Dallas, said lower prices for disposable diapers, higher costs to introduce products in Europe and maintenance shutdown expenses at several pulp mills also hurt earnings.


U.S. Doctor Drops Patient For Criticizing Drug Trial
A patient in a Government drug trial that ended with the deaths of five participants was told by a senior Government doctor that he would no longer be treated because of his public criticism of the trial, officials acknowledged today.
The National Institutes of Health, which conducted the drug test, is investigating the incident, said the acting director of the institutes, Dr.
Ruth Kirchstein.
She said officials intended to apologize to the patient.
"Although I don't know all the circumstances yet, an action like this against a patient is not to be condoned," she said.
"No physician should do that."

Review/Film; From Germany, a Long Joy Ride for Three Inept Criminals
German cinema has never been known for the richness and variety of its comic tradition.
That may be why "No More Mr. Nice Guy," an absurdist road film by the German director Detlev Buck, huffs and puffs so hard to produce only a few mild chuckles.
The film, which opened on Wednesday at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, follows the misadventures of Rudi Kipp (Joachim Krol) and his brother, Most (Horst Krause), as they travel across the country in a rickety pickup truck.
The destination of the brothers, who are illiterate and insane (Rudi is picked up by Most in front of a mental hospital from which he has just escaped), is a property in eastern Germany that they have inherited from their grandmother.
When they eventually reach their goal, it is not exactly the lavish estate they had fantasized.


Israel Eases Palestinian Travel Rules
In a gesture intended to bolster the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Israeli Government today eased months-old restrictions that have made it difficult for Palestinians in the occupied territories to enter Israel, Jerusalem in particular.
The action came a day after the Israelis said they would free some Palestinian prisoners next week -- probably several hundred -- as a first step in the eventual release of thousands of Palestinians held on charges ranging from armed violence to civil disobedience against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

As long lines grew today outside the few gas stations that continue to serve customers, United Nations officials warned that unless the country's elected President was allowed to return by Oct. 30 the Security Council would move to make the blockade against Haiti total.
The warning came amid a growing power struggle between the Haitian military and the civilian Government that centered on the nation's gas pumps.

Kevorkian, Pushing for Jail, Aids in Suicide in His Home
In what he described as a deliberate attempt to get the authorities to jail him, Dr.
Jack Kevorkian was present at yet another suicide this morning, the 19th at which he has been present since embarking three years ago on a campaign to let doctors legally help severely ill people kill themselves.
Unlike any of the 18 earlier suicides, this one occurred at Dr.
Kevorkian's own home in this Detroit suburb.
That location left no ambiguity as to whether he had played an active role in the death, and gave the county prosecutor here, a bitter foe of his, all the more incentive to try to have him locked up.

Anthony Mason played strongly in his first action of the preseason.
Shawn Bradley got a lesson from Patrick Ewing.
And with their 82-79 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers before a crowd of 16,232 at the Nassau Coliseum tonight, the Knicks remained unbeaten in the preseason.
Ewing dominated Bradley, the 76ers' 7-foot-6 rookie center, who was the No. 2 pick in the June draft.
The 76ers signed Bradley to an eight-year contract, anticipating that he would develop into a dominant center.
But it appeared the 76ers may have to wait a few years for a decent return on their $44 million investment.

But even without this extraordinary item, earnings would have amounted to 65 cents a share, well above the consensus estimate of 61 cents.

Review/Music; In Sacred Space, Hymns And Humor and Yodels
The World Music Institute chose a perfect setting for the Rustavi Choir.
At the Church of St.
Mary the Virgin in Manhattan on Sunday night, the 11-man choir from Georgia, the former Soviet republic, performed without microphones or amplifiers, their voices floating radiantly in the reverberant space.
Wearing long, studded tunics, with daggers at their waists, the Georgians harmonized on work songs, Christian hymns, humorous songs and traditional toasts.
In many songs, two voices converged and separated over a drone note, sometimes in a dulcet parallel third, sometimes veering toward combinations that sound dissonant to Western ears.
The voices could be hushed and ethereal with little vibrato, as in medieval music, or clear and hearty.
Then, suddenly, a downward slide or a yelp or a yodel would make clear that the choir had its own sonic traditions.
There were antiphonal songs, filled with non-Western asymmetry; a comic song, similar to children's songs from elsewhere, had a fast, ever-expanding patter section and vivid animal noises.

Contributing to Pratt's operating profit of $60 million were lower costs and an increase in orders for highly profitable spare parts.
Otis's operating profit increased to $100 million, from $78 million a year earlier, as a result of improvements in the European, Asian-Pacific and Latin American regions.
Carrier posted an operating profit of $114 million, compared with $82 million, because gains in North America, Asia-Pacific and Latin America more than offset the effects of a recession in Europe.

U.S.-Japan Trade Talks Bog Down
Trade negotiations between the United States and Japan, begun in July with smiles by President Clinton and Kiichi Miyazawa, who was Prime Minister then, have bogged down in fundamental disagreements, according to participants in the talks.
The disagreements, which emerged in talks here over the last two weeks, indicate that the framework for further talks will not necessarily serve as the basis of a harmonious new economic relationship .


Darts Clash With Brazil Over Loans
For the past couple of weeks, a high-stakes game of chicken involving one of America's wealthiest families and the Government of Brazil has animated what essentially is the final chapter of the Latin American debt crisis.
The dispute, which has Citibank and several other big banks caught in the middle, centers on a face value of about $1.4 billion in Brazilian loans held by the Dart family of Sarasota, Fla., which owns the Dart Container Corporation, a maker of foam containers and cups.


Review/Opera; New to the Met: Verdi's 'Stiffelio,' From 1850
By the time the audience offered a standing ovation to Placido Domingo on Thursday night at the Metropolitan Opera House, it was clear that the company had succeeded in introducing a significant work into its mainstream repertory.
This work, moreover, which was given a devoted, often lovely performance, is not a slight novelty unearthed to provide variety for a basically curatorial opera house.
It may be rife with flaws, but it is also ripe with melodic invention, vigorous dramatic sequences and inventive ensemble pieces.
And it is by a composer who pretty much defined the grand opera tradition: Giuseppe Verdi.
The opera, "Stiffelio," written between "Luisa Miller" and "Rigoletto," disappeared from the world's stages soon after its 1850 premiere not because it was a musical failure, but because its story about a Protestant minister who discovers his wife's infidelity fell afoul of the Roman Catholic censors.
The libretto by Francesco Maria Piave was so disfigured by attempts to eliminate signs of a married religious leader considering divorce and murder that Verdi cannibalized the music and created a more artificial drama, "Aroldo," out of the pieces.


Europe's Markets at Record Highs
Buoyed by a round of interest rate cuts, Europe's major stock exchanges surged to record levels today because, analysts said, investors bet on improving prospects for economic recovery.
Markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris closed at record highs one day after Germany's central bank cut two of its most important short-term interest rates by half a point each, setting off similar reductions in most other European nations.


Lawyer Says Woman Saw Norwalk Officer Fatally Shoot a Young Black Man
In a case that has strained relations between the police and blacks, a lawyer said today that he has a witness who saw a police officer shoot a young black man in the head on July 1, and he demanded that a Federal grand jury begin an investigation.
From the first, the police have said that the victim, Keith Sumpter, 21, shot himself in the head as he was being taken into custody on charges of stealing two gold chains from a teen-ager.


Islanders' Slow Start Is Giving Them Fits
When the Islanders return to the Nassau Coliseum on Saturday, they will see a rare sight: an opponent with a worse record.
That would be the Ottawa Senators, one of few teams in the National Hockey League which has a record worse than the 1-6 Islanders, who lost again tonight, this time to Philadelphia, 4-3, at the Spectrum.
Eric Lindros scored twice for the Flyers, who won their fourth consecutive game.
The Islanders have lost four in a row.


Limiting the Statute of Limitations
Securities lawyers were abuzz yesterday over the settlement Prudential Securities reached with Federal and state securities regulators on Thursday to compensate hundreds of thousands of investors to whom Prudential sold limited partnership investments in the 1980's.
The size of the settlement, which will cost Prudential $371 million immediately and possibly much more in the long run, was eye-opening, the lawyers said.
So was its scope; never before had Federal regulators and so many states worked in harness on a securities scandal.


4 Florida Teen-Agers Charged in Killing of Tourist
Four teen-age boys were charged as adults today in the September killing of a British tourist at an interstate highway rest stop near here, and prosecutors said they might seek the death penalty against at least two of them.
A grand jury in Monticello, 25 miles east of Tallahassee, indicted the four teen-agers on charges of first-degree murder and attempted murder.
The teen-agers, all of whom live in Monticello, a town of 2,600 residents, are charged with the shooting death of Gary Colley, 34, and the wounding of his girlfriend, Margaret Ann Jagger, 35.
The couple were attacked as they slept in their rental car beside Interstate 10 early on the morning of Sept. 14.  4 Are Silent in Court
The defendants are Cedric Demond Green, 13; Aundra Akins, 14, and Deron Maurice Spear and John Jerome Crumity, both 16.

She works in London as a research associate for the Huntington Art Collection of San Marino, Calif.
Her father is the president of the Library Corporation, an information technology company in Inwood, W.Va.


Another of Giants' Backups Is Being Asked to Stand Up
Perhaps more than in any other sport, professional football teams are forced to go to the guys on the bench more than they would normally like to.
Violent collisions can create a constant carousel, and when a guy limps off the field, his replacement at the end of the bench, formerly light years away from the spotlight, is suddenly asked to step in and immediately perform.
Giants wide receiver Mike Sherrard appeared to be on his way to the Pro Bowl when a crushing hip injury last week probably ended his season.
He was the team's leading receiver and was proving to be one of the best talents in the game.
Sherrard was released from the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan yesterday, following a three-night stay after a blood clot had been detected in his injured hip.
Although he has an outside shot of returning by the end of the regular season, for now, he's gone.


Wall Street; Warning Flags Flutter at Spectrum
SOMETIMES a publicly held company provides few clues that things could be amiss, surprising investors when bad news knocks the stock to smithereens.
At other times, however, companies leave red flags waving everywhere you look.
A timely case in point is that of Spectrum Information Technologies, up 29.5 percent to $9.875 in Nasdaq trading last week.

New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
VIRGIN TIME By Patricia Hampl.
Ballantine, $10.
The author journeys, materially and spiritually, to rediscover her Roman Catholic roots.
On the way, she finds the need in her life not so much for God as for prayer and the capacity for wonder it requires.
"There are wonderful passages in this book, buoyant, full of light," Barbara Grizzuti Harrison said here last year.
THROUGH THE IVORY GATE By Rita Dove.
Vintage Contemporaries, $11.
This first novel by the new Poet Laureate of the United States explores the relationships and memories of Virginia, a young black actress and musician who returns to Akron, Ohio, her hometown, to teach elementary school.
Last year our reviewer, Geoff Ryman, said: "It is a happy book, about the pleasures of living. The author has a talent for sanguine observation." Vintage has also published Ms.
Dove's SELECTED POEMS ($12), which includes three earlier volumes: "The Yellow House on the Corner," "Museum" and "Thomas and Beulah," which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987.
One critic said, "Her poems exhibit the thrift that Yeats called the sign of a perfected manner."


Corrections
A report in the Egos &amp; Ids column last Sunday about Anne Bass misstated her role in the John Galliano fashion show in Paris.
She did not help pay to stage it.
The show's other backer, along with Sao Schlumberger, was Dodie Rosekrans.


IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: A Genteel Conspiracy Theory; Is It Just Possible That Ford Wants to Beat G.M.?
TO hear normally buttoned-up auto industry analysts sound like conspiracy buffs surveying the grassy knoll, ask them this: Is the Ford Motor Company quietly trying to overtake the hobbled General Motors Corporation and become the No. 1 automaker in the United States?
Odd that the question should have to be asked.
In other industries, companies like Pepsi, Avis, Apple and United make no bones about their eagerness to knock off the big guy.
But one of the peculiar aspects of relations among the Big Three automakers is that they are publicly quite genteel.
Perhaps because they focus their hostility on the Japanese, no one here talks much about crushing the domestic competition and becoming No. 1.


Airline Seats: Not Always First Come First Served
WHO gets the good seats in the coach section of an airplane?
The answer is as fraught with hierarchy as Byzantium.
When the travel agent opens the computer record for your coach flight, seeking to get you into an aisle seat close to the front exit, the diagram may show that that seat and other aisle seats back quite a way have been designated for frequent-flier members with high mileages or those who pay the full coach price.
Whatever the terminology, the computer may "rope off" choice seats for passengers who travel the airline often or reserve at the last minute and thus at a high price.
USAir, which still has an old-fashioned policy of first come first served, says it, too, should be holding out good seats for late-booking business travelers, and it is preparing to shift over.
"It makes a lot of sense," said J. Daniel Brock, USAir's vice president for marketing and services.
"We've got to have a system that saves good seats for those travelers who pay $600 for a last-minute ticket. Those seats cannot all go to a leisure traveler who paid $200."


Couch Potatoes, Indeed
To the Editor:
Dr.
Uriel S. Barzel's ideas about taxing obesity ("Health: Make Couch Potatoes Pay More," Viewpoints, Oct. 10) is surely just tongue-in-cheek opinion and not serious food-in-cheek science.
Certainly a physician understands that "the overconsumption of rich food and the under-expenditure of energy" are the means by which people grow fat, not the cause of obesity.
When last I looked, the cause was still unknown, clearly evidenced by the lack of cure.


Sports Wouldn't Be the Same Without the View from a Blimp
"BLIMP, I like that shot. Hold it." It is a command that Sandy Grossman, the lead CBS sports director, often makes as he selects shots to be broadcast during National Football League games.
The command is made to a camera technician who is situated in the blimp's gondola some 1,000 feet above the stadium.
Blimps are a common sight in the skies above New Jersey and much of the rest of the country, and their presence at all manner of sporting events is only expected to increase.


Late Princeton Rally Preserves Perfect Mark
Two big fourth-quarter touchdowns, one a 54-yard run by Keith Elias, gave Princeton a 21-10 victory today over a stubborn Harvard team before a crowd of 19,710 at Harvard Stadium.
The triumph was the sixth straight for the undefeated Tigers, who were led by Elias, their star tailback.
He gained 201 yards rushing on 33 carries.


Neighborhood Report: South Bronx; A School of Dreams: Building Community Leaders
Two years ago, a group of people in Hunts Point looked at the poverty, drugs and violence plaguing their neighborhood and decided they had to do something.
They decided to build a school.
Not just any school, but an elite institution that would focus on ethics and politics as well as on Hunts Point itself, molding students into potential civic leaders.


Oh, Brother, 2 Hat Tricks but Still a Tie
Pierre Turgeon's linemate scored a three-goal hat trick for the Islanders tonight.
Pierre Turgeon's brother did the same thing for the Ottawa Senators.
Those performances -- by Derek King and by Sylvain Turgeon -- accounted for the majority of the scoring in a 5-5 tie that left the Senators with something to celebrate and the Islanders with more frustration.


VOTING IN CANADA CAN AFFECT NAFTA
If the Liberal Party leader, Jean Chretien, becomes Canada's Prime Minister, as is expected in general elections on Monday, the Clinton Administration could face new problems over the North American Free Trade Agreement as a vote nears on the pact in the American Congress.
In 1988 elections, the Liberals, under John Turner, vowed to tear up an earlier free-trade accord with the United States.
Under Mr.
Chretien, 59, a shrewd, folksy, pragmatic Quebecer who held high office in earlier Liberal Governments, the position on the broader accord with the United States and Mexico is more moderate.


Dawn Pascucci, Terrill Barnard
Dawn Pascucci, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Michael Pascucci of Locust Valley, L.I., was married yesterday to Terrill Evans Barnard, a son of Mrs.
Richard Barnard of Clarkston, Mich., and the late Mr.
Barnard.
The Rev.
Allan B. Ramirez, a Dutch Reform minister, and Msgr.
Thomas Hartman, a Roman Catholic priest, jointly officiated at the Brookville (L.I.) Reform Church.
Mrs.
Barnard, a graduate of Boston University, teaches computer and reading at the Henry Viscardi School for handicapped children in Albertson, L.I.
Her father is the chairman of the Oxford Resources Corporation, an automobile financing company in Melville, L.I., and of WLIG, a cable television station in Riverhead, L.I.


THE WORLD: Following a Tough Act; Bhutto Gets Another Chance to Get It Right
BENAZIR BHUTTO, a gauzy veil draped over her hair in a gesture to Islamic modesty, smiled slightly last week when the speaker of Pakistan's Parliament announced that she had won a majority of votes to regain the prime ministership she lost three years ago, when she became the first woman to lead an Islamic nation.
It was a moment of victory for Ms.
Bhutto.
She had prevailed over her political nemesis, Nawaz Sharif, the man who succeeded her and who she said had conspired with the country's powerful army and President to oust her from office.
Moreover, she had regained the power that she feels is rightfully hers, not only by popular acclaim but by birth as well.
Far less clear, however, is what her victory means for Pakistan.


A Father's Dream, a Son's Nightmare
WHEN B. Ray Thompson, a former coal miner, arrived here in 1941, he was so poor he could barely keep his two sons in shoes that fit.
But by the late 1970's, he was one of the richest men in Tennessee, having built and sold one of the nation's largest coal mining companies.
Before he died six years ago, he asked the hospital where his second wife had died of cancer to help build a cancer center rivaling Sloan-Kettering and others like it.
It would make the world's best care and experimental treatments affordable to people of modest means.
Mr.
Thompson and his family committed $100 million to build it and finance a charitable foundation to help sustain it.


Sultry Songs and Jazz At New Haven's Shubert
THE musical week gets off to a lively start at 2 o'clock today as Mel Torme, Cleo Laine and John Dankworth convene at the Shubert in New Haven for an afternoon of "sultry songs and classical jazz." The box office opens at 11 today.
The phone number is 624-1825.
Three performances are offered at 3 today: the Newtown Friends of Music present Christopher Taylor, a pianist and a Van Cliburn competition medalist, playing Bach, Beethoven and Chopin in Edmond Town Hall (426-6470).


From Back Door To Inner Sanctum In the House of Art
For years the one sure response to photography was "But is it art?" Now "But is it photography?" is more likely.
Photographs that masquerade as art, acting as grand and self-assured as paintings, or leading a piecemeal, hybrid existence in paintings or sculpture or installations, are right in the center of things, and gallery walls fairly teem with them.
This story of photography's incorporation and metamorphosis into art amplifies a recurrent theme of this century: a marginal form -- welded metal, factory-made artifacts, rhythm and blues -- shifts into prominence, even predominance.
"Photographic: Works of the 60's and 70's," at the Zabriskie Gallery through Saturday, assembles examples of the many ways photography has progressed through the halls of art and into its living quarters.
A couple of museum shows have presented the subject more comprehensively -- "Photographic" has only about three dozen objects -- and some have been more generous to photographers than this show, which deals mainly with artists who experimented with cameras.
But several of the pieces here are quite satisfying and instructive, and the show touches enough bases to suggest that when photography took up residence in art's inner sanctum, the look of things shifted in just about every direction at once.


An Old Georgian Story: Dancing With the Devil
OF all the former republics of the Soviet Union, none has fallen farther faster than Georgia.
Since it declared independence in May 1989, the country has suffered one calamity after another -- a coup d'etat, a war of secession, a flood of refugees, a shredding of the economy, and now a civil war that could literally break the country in half.
It was not so long ago that this nation of 5.5 million people enjoyed a reputation for living as good a life as could be had under Soviet Communism.
From the peaks of the Caucasus Mountains to the lush Black Sea coast, Georgia was toasted as the Italy of the East.
The food was rich and spicy, the wine was plentiful, the hospitality overwhelming.


Neighborhood Report: Long Island City/Woodside; Area May Get First Nursing Home
Woodside, which lies in a Congressional district with one of the nation's highest concentrations of elderly people, has no nursing homes.
That could change soon; a developer with plans to build a 280-bed home on a vacant lot on Queens Boulevard between 61st and 63d Streets has cleared all but two hurdles.
"There's nothing like this in our community for seniors," said Joseph Conley, the chairman of Community Board 2.


Freedom Is Restored to the Capitol


Ladling Out a Little Hope to the Hopeless
"MAYBE we'll see Mary today," says Fran O'Leary, peering through a window of a 33-foot Winnebago motor home at a South Bronx moonscape.
"Mary's probably in detox," says Fran Davis.
This is a ritualistic coping joke.
Mary is more likely dead in an alley, like Carmen and Muffin, than getting clean in a treatment program, but social workers need hope to get through their days as much as their clients do.

SIMPLE PASSION By Annie Ernaux.

Humans Are the Dinosaurs in 'Pterodactyls'
Maybe it's time to start taking the playwright Nicky Silver seriously.
Up to now, his bizarrely titled works -- "Fat Men in Skirts," "Free Will and Wanton Lust," "My Marriage to Ernest Borgnine" -- have been characterized by their outrageousness, a lunatic humor, sexual confusions, violence and an eagerness, bordering on the sophomoric, to flout taboos.


All Alone at the Pinnacle Of a Chess Generation
Twenty-one years ago, there was Bobby Fischer in his prime.
Now there is Gary Kasparov.
The Russian dominates the present generation just as the American did his.
So all criticism of Nigel Short's performance in their world championship match is beside the point: Kasparov is too strong for any of his rivals.
The story is told that when Boris Spassky, Fischer's defeated opponent in the title match of 1972, was summoned before officials of the Soviet Chess Federation and asked why he lost, he replied, "Because he is the greatest player I have ever played." The story continues that he turned and walked out without ever having taken his coat off.
There was nothing more to say.


3 Men Arrested In Firebombing That Injured 2
Fingerprints on two gasoline bombs led the police to three arrests in the burning of a Brooklyn man and his 3-year-old nephew in July, a police spokesman said yesterday.
The victims were innocent bystanders in a drug turf war, he said.
The suspects, arrested at 11 P.M. on Friday in Brooklyn, were identified as Aaron Jones, 27, of 214 Maujer Street; Kevin Sands, 22, of 220 Stagg Walk, and Robert Deleon, 17, of 25 Hope Street, said Detective Joseph McConville, a spokesman for the New York City Police Department.

Technology; In TV's, the World May Soon Be Flat
ENGINEERS have long dreamed of building large televisions that would be thin enough to hang on a wall, thereby transforming the living room into the equivalent of a home movie theater.
Now, the first models of such televisions are beginning to appear -- though only for people with thick walls and even thicker wallets.
This month, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company began selling a 14-inch television that is 3.9 inches thick, less than a third the thickness of a conventional television with the same size screen.
Next month, Fujitsu General will begin selling a 21-inch television that is only 2.4 inches thick.


A Rogues' Gallery of Artists and Esthetes
THE Stettheimer sisters Florine, Ettie and Carrie -- lived in Manhattan with their mother at 182 West 55th Street.
Ettie wrote novels and Carrie took 20 years to make a doll's house -- ornamented with miniature versions of works by artists like William Zorach, Alexander Archipenko and Gaston Lachaise -- that is now in the Museum of the City of New York.
Florine, the painter, achieved fame with her sets for Virgil Thomson's "Four Saints in Three Acts" and, thanks to Marcel Duchamp, a posthumous show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1946 (she died in 1944).


Special Today: 50 Years Of Fashion: Magazine, Section 6
In a democratic explosion, fashion has rolled its pipe racks into the mass consciousness as never before.

A special issue of the Magazine charts fashion's move from elite to street.


Give Him an Extra Year, He'll Kill Your Bowl Plans
He wasn't even supposed to be here.
He already has his degree in sociology.
And after Boston College's Darnell Campbell scored three touchdowns in Alumni Stadium this afternoon, Army probably wished he hadn't stuck around.
Led by Campbell, the Eagles improved their record to 4-2 by defeating Army, 41-14.
The Cadets dropped to 4-3, and the loss knocked them out of contention for the Liberty Bowl.


Two Ivy Teams That Are 1,000 Yards From First Place
You almost needed to be a math major yesterday afternoon to keep up with the yardage being piled up as Yale and Columbia traded drive after long drive.
By the time the game was over, the two occupants of the Ivy League cellar had combined for nearly 1,000 yards of offense.
Yale ended up with more yards, and more important, more points, holding on for a 35-28 victory in front of the 5,350 fans at Baker Field in Wien Stadium on a fall afternoon that seemed to be made especially for college football.


Books From The Times
SOLVING AMERICA'S HEALTH-CARE CRISIS: A Guide to Understanding the Greatest Threat to Your Family's Economic Security.
By the staff of The New York Times.
Edited by Erik Eckholm. (Times Books/Random House, paper, $10.) It wasn't just yesterday that health care in this country became an agonizing concern.
Three years ago, The New York Times undertook to look at the subject in special breadth and depth; this collection of 50 articles from The Times written since then, and updated as necessary, represents the fruits of that effort, examining such areas of consequence as insurance, ethics, economics, the experience of other countries and the politics of reform.
President Clinton's proposals, as laid out in his televised address of Sept. 22, are also reprinted, followed by seven articles analyzing the proposals and estimating their consequences.


U.S. Offers Help to Russians to Insure the Elections Are Fair
As part of its campaign to support President Boris N. Yeltsin in his efforts to change Russia, the United States offered technical help today to try to insure that parliamentary elections in December are free and fair.
"Our efforts -- if we are asked -- would focus on the nuts and bolts of free elections, from voter education to poll-watching," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in a speech to the Academy of the National Economy.


New Fungus Blight Is Threatening Potato Crops Around the World
Scientists say variants of the fungus that caused the Irish potato blight of the 1840's are spreading throughout the world, threatening a crop that is a staple in many countries.
Agricultural experts are calling for an international research effort to thwart the new fungal variants, which are well-established throughout Europe and into Russia, as well as in Mexico and South American countries including Ecuador, Brazil and Argentina.
Infestations are also being reported in potato-growing regions of the United States, Canada, Africa, Japan and Korea, the experts said this week.


Black Business Owners Endorse Giuliani, Who Stresses Unity
In a concerted appeal to black and Hispanic voters yesterday, Rudolph W. Giuliani toured Brooklyn field offices in Bushwick and Sunset Park, picked up an endorsement from black business owners and repeatedly called on voters to unite around shared problems like crime and the economy.
In contrast to recent days, when he sharply attacked Mayor David N. Dinkins, Mr.
Giuliani spoke yesterday about inclusion, bipartisanship and racial healing.


Debate on Race And Adoptions Is Being Reborn
The day David L. Dunbar and Barbara Peck decided to adopt a child, race was the last thing on their minds.
All they knew was that they, a young, white couple, had fallen in love with a baby the color of butterscotch -- the child of a mixed-race mother, and possibly, black father.
And they wanted to take him home.
More than a year later, sitting in their living room on the Upper West Side, Mr.
Dunbar, a writer, looked at his son, Evan, and for a moment, contemplated race.
He thought about what other whites might one day think of his child, and what his child might one day think of him.
"You know when kids get into adolescence and they're ashamed of their parents?" he said.
"I wonder if Evan will ever be embarrassed by us because we're white? I wonder."


Tackless Strips Help to Carpet Stairs
CARPETING a straight staircase is not too difficult.
The method shown here uses tackless strips as fasteners instead of old-fashioned stair rods, which prevent stretching carpet tightly, and allows shifting carpeting to expose fresh material as wear develops.
Avoid using slippery carpet for covering stairs.
Also, leave stairs uncovered or cover them with nonskid rubber pads if they are to be used by the aged or handicapped.

Blending Pop and the Classics in a Magazine for Students
EVERY month during the school year, 35-year-old Cathy Cassinos-Carr, who likes pop and rock, and 73-year-old Milton M. Friedman, who favors the classics, blend their talents as editors of a music education magazine for readers in grades 5 through 12 called Music Alive!
The magazine, published by the Cherry Lane Music Company in Port Chester, is sold by subscription -- $175 a year -- for use in classrooms and choral and instrument classes.


Fashionable Words
At the pentagon, the vogue word is win-win, the strategy of being able to fight two nonnuclear wars at the same time.
This supplanted the "win-hold-win" strategy, designed to hold one war on a back burner until the other war is won, then to win the first one.
These locutions are based on the "no win" derogation of strategy of a generation ago, which in turn was antedated by a slick "no lose" bet by gamblers.
In academe, the vogue word is daunting.
A professor may be intimidated, cowed, appalled or even spooked by the lengthy work of a colleague (which is what a co-worker is always called), but the only term to use this year is the present participle of daunt (rooted in the Latin for "tame"), as in "The subtext is daunting." (Sighted subtext; sank same.)


Health Reform and the Lawyers
To the Editor:
Harlan R. Ribnik, in "Health Reform? How About Lawyers?" (Viewpoints, Sept. 26), asked why lawyers aren't being asked to donate their services to the poor.
Dr.
Ribnik will be glad to know that lawyers are in fact being asked to do just that, and are responding in large numbers.


Ronald Lauder, Leader Of Term-Limit Band
Four years ago, Ronald S. Lauder stumbled through an improbable campaign for the Republican nomination for mayor of New York City.
A political neophyte and an heir to his family's cosmetics fortune, he spent an unheard-of $14 million out of his own pocket, only to be disdained by the political establishment and routed by Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Now, after largely vanishing from the arena of city politics, he has returned as a major figure in this year's elections.
He has mounted a campaign that has shaken the foundations of the city's political establishment.
Only this time, he's not a candidate, but rather the leader of another improbable effort: a referendum that would limit the city's elected officials to two four-year terms in office and could help pave the way for another run at elected office, if he chooses.

Staten Island Vote: Dilemma for Albany
With Staten Islanders expected to approve a referendum calling for secession from New York City, officials in Albany are growing worried about the choice they may face: permitting the dismemberment of New York City or rescinding the right of self-determination that they seemed to grant four years ago.

Advice Is Cheap, Even Free
Wondering how to recycle motor oil may not keep you up at night, but when it comes time to do it, you may need guidance.
The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs prints how-to information, much of it free, on topics ranging from mattress buying to safer use of ceramic ware.


For Bowlers, A Field Of Dreams
LAWN BOWLING, that offbeat cousin of boccie and a distant, disdainful relative of regular lane bowling, attracts a small but devoted following to a Central Park court, where fine attire and genteel good sportsmanship prevail.
Next Sunday more than two dozen bowlers are expected to compete in the New York Lawn Bowling Club's Die Hard tournament at the Central Park Greene.
"We call it die hard because the weather is usually terrible this time of year," said Joe Gioco, the club's president.
"This year is the latest it has been in a long time."


On Sunday; Zen Quest: Serenity In Sing Sing
WITH the quarter-century burst of nostalgia under way about the 1960's and the tarnished idealism and even jail time of its middle-class protagonists, it is proper to salute Kobutsu Kevin Malone this morning on the quiet, yea silent occasion of his ordination to the priesthood of Buddhism.
Finally, the Malone family has a priest after all its hopes for young Kevin's parochial school years saw him cycle out into the personal searchings of the 60's, in which, among other things, he sampled the Rinzai Zen sect.
He never abandoned its simple but laborious discipline across a checkerboard of survival in a dozen different pursuits.
It took him 25 years to become a priest.
Others have done it in five years, but that only leaves him prouder this morning as he is ordained at the age of 43.

Hotel Discounts In Hawaii
Hit by tight times in the United States and Japan and by competition from other tropical destinations, Hawaii's visitor count is expected to drop 4.8 percent this year compared with last, according to the Hawaii Visitors Bureau.
Hotels are responding with discounts and packages to lure travelers.
Sheraton has extended to Dec. 27 its Suresaver rates, with discounts of up to 31 percent at seven hotels.
For example, a $330 ocean view room at the Royal Hawaiian would be $249; a $170 ocean view room at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani would go for $119.
Also valid through December are Sheraton's Suresaver Vacations, packages ranging from the five-night First Timer in Waikiki for $599 a person, double occupancy, to the two-night $739 Luxury in Paradise at the Hotel Hana Maui, also per person, double occupancy.


Turning Beans Into an Innovation
BEANS are no longer just a food to be cooked with a ham hock and served on a cold day.
Innovative chefs are preparing them in all kinds of interesting ways, making them into creamy purees to go with meat or fish, topping them with green vegetables or even serving them on crostini -- grilled country bread -- as a snack, as the Italians do.
Carol Field, in her excellent new book, "Italy in Small Bites" (William Morrow), gives a recipe for dried fava beans, which are pureed and mixed with wild greens.
The nutty flavor of the favas makes a splendid foil for the bitterness of the greens.
If you can't find wild greens, broccoli rape, escarole, frisee or chicory can be substituted.
The puree is also good spread on grilled, lightly oiled bread and topped with steamed or sauteed greens (winter's answer to summer's tomato bruschetta).

OCT. 17-23: Nuclear Dumping; A Secret Russian Mission Exposed on Japanese TV
Whenever the Russians seem on the verge of getting along with the Japanese -- or at least extracting some serious aid from them -- things seem to sour at the last minute.
For a while it was President Boris N. Yeltsin's cancellations of trips to Japan that offended Tokyo.
Earlier this month he arrived, pledging good will and an end to Russia's practice of dumping nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan.
Only he forgot to tell the Russian Navy.

With Bulbs, No Time to Dawdle
Lose no time in patting your plants.
Still looking for good deals on good bulbs?
A few readers have reminded me of two suppliers that combine high quality with reasonable cost: Van Engelen, Stillbrook Farm, 313 Maple Street, Litchfield, Conn. 06759, and Dutch Gardens, P.O.
Box 200, Adelphia, N.J. 07710.
It's getting late to plant, though, except for tulips, which can be put in the ground until it freezes.
Pot some bulbs for forcing spring bloom in winter.
Depending on the bulb, figure on 10 to 12 weeks at 40 degrees to allow for root development.


POSTINGS: Under One Roof at Last;
Construction has been finished on the new $1.5 million, almost 10,000-square-foot home of the Flushing, Queens, branch of the Y.W.C.A.
The building at 42-07 Parsons Boulevard, the first new building for the Y.W.C.A. of the City of New York since 1917, includes a large multipurpose room, a rooftop playground, two day-care rooms, classrooms, a computer room, a kitchen and several offices.
Until now, the Flushing Y.W.C.A. operated out of several community centers, churches and other available spaces.
"We are thrilled that we can finally offer our programs all under one roof," said Vivian Manning Fox, executive director of the city Y.W.C.A.
"We can expand and implement programming to meet the community's demands and interests."


'May We Help You?': Downstairs at the Majestic
DOWN in the bowels of the Majestic apartment house, Allan Sorensen recalls his days at sea as a merchant mariner, when he savored the interior hum from machinery and passing ocean that signaled all was well aboard his ship.
"The Majestic is exactly like a ship," says Mr.
Sorensen, the resident manager of the grand, double-towered building of 254 apartments, which is too complex to have someone termed a mere old-fashioned apartment superintendent at the helm as it cruises in place through urban time and tide on Central Park West at 72d Street.


Not in Praise of Dogs: They Should Be Banned
To the Editor:
In your Oct. 17 article "My Dog, My Self" you should not have praised dogs.
The city streets are a mine field of dog poop and urine.
When I see a dog doing it on the sidewalk, I shout at the owner, "Curb that dog!" Most don't care and shout back at me to mind my own business.
Or just smile.
Isn't it everyone's business to keep the sidewalks clean?
If owners can't control their dogs, they should not be allowed to own them.
Ban the dogs!
JOSEPH J. MARINELLO  Manhattan


Corrections
A listing of cruises on Oct. 10 referred incorrectly or incompletely to several trips.
Descriptions of two Caribbean cruises of the Seabourn Pride included outdated itineraries and dates supplied by the Seabourn Cruise Line.
The ship will offer a 16-night voyage from Fort Lauderdale to Manaus on Feb. 3 and a 16-night voyage from Manaus to Fort Lauderdale on Feb. 19 (not a 7-night sailing from Aruba on Jan. 30 or a 7-night sailing from Barbados on Feb. 6).
The fares for each voyage range from $13,085 to $22,845, including air fare and a one-night hotel stay.


Other Normandy
To the Editor: While somewhat informative, the article on Normandy on Sept. 5 was disappointing.
It ignored the lovely paysage normand.
If the author had traveled just several kilometers inland, she would have discovered "the foreign, the quaint, the remote," that is to say Normandy with its beautiful apple orchards, charming villages with their half-timbered houses and flower boxes and historic churches and chateaus.


In America; The Things They Could Have Said
Think of the opportunity that David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani had.
Imagine how they could have campaigned, the things they could have talked about.
They could have described a vision of New York that would have placed a sense of hope in the path of our growing feelings of alienation and dread.
They could have tempered the fears of many residents that New York is in a state of irreversible decline.


Airline Seats: Not Always First Come First Served
WHO gets the good seats in the coach section of an airplane?
The answer is as fraught with hierarchy as Byzantium.
When the travel agent opens the computer record for your coach flight, seeking to get you into an aisle seat close to the front exit, the diagram may show that that seat and other aisle seats back quite a way have been designated for frequent-flier members with high mileages or those who pay the full coach price.
Whatever the terminology, the computer may "rope off" choice seats for passengers who travel the airline often or reserve at the last minute and thus at a high price.
USAir, which still has an old-fashioned policy of first come first served, says it, too, should be holding out good seats for late-booking business travelers, and it is preparing to shift over.
"It makes a lot of sense," said J. Daniel Brock, USAir's vice president for marketing and services.
"We've got to have a system that saves good seats for those travelers who pay $600 for a last-minute ticket. Those seats cannot all go to a leisure traveler who paid $200."


Dear Conan: More Advice
To the Editor:
In the interest of balance, I think you should ask what the real viewers think of Conan O'Brien's show ("Dear Conan: A Letter From Harvard," Sept. 19), not just the old National Lampoon boys who are recruited in vitro by the networks.
So here's my advice to him:


In the Region/Connecticut; A Tourist Spot Where Shakespeare Once Reigned
THE statue of Hamlet that broods amid the undergrowth outside the vacant state-owned Shakespeare Theater at Stratford-on-the-Housatonic may soon find itself in happier surroundings.
After years of searching, the Connecticut Economic Development Department, which is responsible for the 14.5-acre site, has found a development team it considers capable of creating a viable entertainment complex at the dilapidated theater center.


TWO SIDES IN HAITI MEET ON IMPASSE
Haiti's military leaders met with the country's civilian Government for more than three hours tonight in an emergency effort to reach a political settlement to avert a worldwide ban on trade with Haiti and the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The meeting, between the Prime Minister, Robert Malval, and the entire Haitian High Command, led by Lieut.
Gen.
Raoul Cedras, centered around plans to restore a previously negotiated timetable to the return from exile of the elected President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
He was scheduled to return by next Saturday.


Vivien Leigh's Charleston
To the Editor:
Anyone who saw Vivien Leigh dance a spirited Charleston in "Tovarich" would hardly call her frail, as Frank Rich does.
Clearly, the show was a B-level vehicle, but she gave a truly memorable performance and won a Tony Award for best actress in a musical.


Thomas Eakins Ventured Deep Into the Psyche
It has long been one of the anomalies of the international art world that the paintings of Thomas Eakins have virtually never been seen outside the United States.
In Europe, even the name of Eakins is unknown to the general public.
There is, to my knowledge, only one Eakins in a European museum -- the "Portrait of Clara," which was given to the French state by the artist's widow in 1930 and is now in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
As for a serious exhibition of his work, backed by up-to-date scholarship, the idea would seem never to have found favor.
That conspicuous wrong has now been righted by the arrival in London of "Thomas Eakins and the Heart of American Life," at the National Portrait Gallery (through Jan. 23).


Rocard Inherits France's Battered Socialists
For the last 22 years, living uncomfortably in the shadow of President Francois Mitterrand, Michel Rocard has awaited his chance to take over France's Socialist Party.
Today, when he was finally elected the undisputed Socialist leader, he inherited a party in ruins.
Having virtually secured the Socialists' nomination for the 1995 presidential elections, Mr.
Rocard now has just 18 months to revive a party that is still reeling from its humiliating defeat by a conservative coalition in parliamentary elections in March.

Tackless Strips Help to Carpet Stairs
CARPETING a straight staircase is not too difficult.
The method shown here uses tackless strips as fasteners instead of old-fashioned stair rods, which prevent stretching carpet tightly, and allows shifting carpeting to expose fresh material as wear develops.
Avoid using slippery carpet for covering stairs.
Also, leave stairs uncovered or cover them with nonskid rubber pads if they are to be used by the aged or handicapped.

Clinton Defends Aristide
President Clinton defended Father Aristide today against the C.I.A.'s suggestions that he is mentally unstable and unfit to lead Haiti.
Mr.
Clinton said the views of Administration officials who have worked with Father Aristide to help restore him to power carried more weight than allegations that officials of the agency made to members of Congress this week.


Neighborhood Report: Harlem; Bus Drivers Pay Tribute to the Memory of Mother Hale
Drivers from the 146th Street bus depot are taking the memory of Mother Hale on the road.

Reduce Oil Imports Before the Next Crisis
To the Editor:
It is particularly distressing that not only have we forgotten the lessons of two oil embargoes and the Persian Gulf War but also that we are still paying their economic price ("After 20 Years America's Foot Is Still on the Gas," The Week in Review, Oct. 17).
Although we complain about automobile imports, the importation of oil costs us twice as much and is the biggest item in our negative balance of trade.


Questions Raised About Children in Attic
When detectives arrived at the home of Anthony and Shirley James on Oct. 8 after questioning two of the couple's six children in a shoplifting case, they found what they called clear-cut signs of abuse.
The attic where the children stayed was like a virtual prison, they said, with only two small mattresses for four people, and there was no heating except for a chimney stack that the children would gather around for warmth.
But after a flurry of media reports about the case, family members and the couple's lawyer say that the real victims in the case are the parents.
They say the Jameses opened their home to five adoptees, bringing them up in a loving manner.
By their account, the children, caught shoplifting, wove a false tale for the police in order to avoid punishment.


At Work; Will These Contract Talks Fly?
OBJECTIVE reality is the uninvited guest to virtually any labor-management negotiation, but rarely more so than in the current lengthy dispute between American Airlines and one of its unions, the 21,000-member Association of Professional Flight Attendants.
Perhaps Srinivasa Ramanujan, the late Indian mathematical genius, could untangle the airline industry's wizardly compensation formulas and arrive at a kernel of pure truth.
Mere mortals wait in vain for any fact, factoid or fact-ette to stand up and bark.
Are flight attendants still getting the shaft a decade after they made concessions, including allowing the company to impose its two-tier wage system, to save their jobs and, supposedly, the airline?
Or is American a benevolent employer, simply seeking flexibility to allow it to compete in what every American man, woman, child and kitty cat by now agrees is a killer industry?


Hands On
I LIKE RUNNING THINGS.
Granted, freight elevators do not ordinarily fall into the category of things style editors get to run -- though the bemused operator at Isaac Mizrahi's SoHo loft building occasionally indulges me.
But an intimate knowledge of fashion's backstages is necessary in this business.
It's not a pretty world.
Behind all those sleek showrooms, Seventh Avenue is seamy.
Granted, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union is responsible for better lighting and fireproofing in the lofts where American garment workers cut, drape and stitch.
But all around them are cramped offices, passageways clogged with clothes racks, graffiti-littered halls, dirty restrooms and seeming miles of clanging metal gates to control thievery.
For years, the Paris couture houses were no better.
Behind the hushed, perfumed salons where models parade the most expensive clothes in the world, the back rooms were unspeakable.
Now, those of Dior, Givenchy, Lacroix and Chanel in particular are pleasant, neat as a pin and admirably secure.
Sometimes too much so.
Last summer, after I had spent a couple of exhilarating hours watching Karl Lagerfeld put his design troupes through their last-minute paces for the next day's show, I left by the back way -- on the freight elevator, of course. (It was well past 8 P.M.) Just as the door at the employees' entrance snapped shut behind me, the door in front, leading to the rue Cambon, refused to buzz open.
I was sealed in a little box of a vestibule, able to see out through the one-way glass but unable to be seen.
I had the sinking feeling that much as I loved the house of Chanel, an overnight stay would be too long.
Finally, a security guard found me.


Neighborhood Report: Crown Heights; Helping the Frightened Elderly Take Back Their Streets
Starting next week, the elderly residents of Crown Heights will be taking back the streets -- or at least the supermarkets, pharmacies, beauty parlors and banks -- if the plan of a coalition of community groups works as hoped.
Volunteers from each of several groups will escort the elderly on their errands on Mondays and Tuesdays between 10 A.M. and 1 P.M., said Batia Brandel, executive director of the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council, a member of the coalition.
Volunteers will also do the legwork for those who are bedridden.


'That Heavenly Coffee' Returns in New Coffee Bars
Chock Full o' Nuts is returning to Manhattan, but only the name will remain the same.
In place of the dozens of coffee shops, the last of which closed in 1989, the new stores will take the form of the oh-so-hip coffee bars that have cropped up from Seattle to Seventh Avenue South.
The first store is scheduled to open in midtown early next year, with as many as 10 more planned for Manhattan by 1995.
"The coffee bar is the fastest growing thing in coffee," said Howard Leitner, president of Chock Full o' Nuts, a major coffee distributor.
"We think it will be an exciting thing to do."


Megaclub With That 'Underground' Look
Peter Gatien has spent $2 million renovating the Tunnel, which sounds like an awful lot for a nightclub that will be open only two nights a week.
"This is such a big space that I decided it needs to be filled," Mr.
Gatien said last week about the megaclub, at Twelfth Avenue and 27th Street, that he bought in May 1992 and officially reopened on Friday.
"It's very expensive to fill a club and give it legs during the week." The Friday night party, called "Puzzled," is open to anyone; on Saturdays, there's a party for gay men called Nocturnal.


Helping Women Master the Financial World
CAREN SCHWEITZER, program coordinator at the Westchester Self-Help Clearinghouse in White Plains, recalled the phone calls she received soon after her divorce more than 20 years ago.
Some were from real estate agents asking if her house was on the market, said Ms.
Schweitzer, who has since remarried.
Others were from well-meaning friends and family members offering torrents of advice.
"Everybody treated me as though I had suddenly become an incompetent," said Ms.
Schweitzer, who is a social worker.
The assumption was, she said, that she could not make sound decisions as a newly single woman.


Happy Mating of Mexican and Spanish
MANSION MADRID is a marvel.
Smiling waiters at this Lindenhurst newcomer serve soul-satisfying Spanish and Mexican food in spacious comfortable surroundings at bargain prices.
Diners who enjoyed the fare at the Costa de Espana, which has closed in Port Jefferson, will be pleased to find its chef, owner and the same well-prepared food transplanted to the South Shore.


Sleepy? No. Pass The Popcorn
These cornflower-blue-and-white striped broadcloth pajamas ($65), by Brooks Brothers, would be ideal garb for hanging around the house, watching gloriously obscure films from the 1930's and 40's on the American Movie Classics cable channel.
Their nattiness may help to mitigate any feelings of slothful lassitude induced by movie marathons.


A Royal Scandal, Japanese Style
When members of the British royal family become the center of controversy, it is generally because they said too much.
In the Japanese imperial court last week, a mystery surrounded the Empress who said nothing -- because, for reasons as mysterious as the royal family's origins, she cannot.
Empress Michiko, the dignified, much-beloved and often pitied wife of Akihito, has not said a word since she fell unconscious for hours on Wednesday, her 59th birthday.
The palace, which originally suggested that she had only briefly fainted, now contends that medical examinations have found no evidence of a stroke.
Instead, her physicians say she feels "strong feelings of distress." They did not say why.


Democrats Study Amending War Powers Act
Leading Senate Democrats say they will make a coordinated effort to determine when the United States should agree to send troops abroad and what role Congress should have in such decisions.
After two weeks of repeated though unsuccessful efforts in the Senate to curb President Clinton's authority to deploy troops in Somalia, Bosnia and Haiti, the Democrats announced a new effort to see if the War Powers Act of 1973, which allows Congress to order a President to withdraw troops from potential conflicts abroad, should be amended.


Hail, Jones
To the Sports Editor:
Robert Lipsyte, searching for historical analogies to the retirement of Michael Jordan in his prime, properly cites the abdications of Rocky Marciano, Bjorn Borg and Jim Brown.
The same column also says only two other American athletes -- Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali -- "so dominated, advanced and transcended their sports."

How a Canny Evita Played Her Cards
FEW theatergoers are unfamiliar with "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina," one of the hit songs from "Evita," the popular musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice.
The songs were hit recordings long before the show opened on Broadway.
What may come as a surprise is the harsh plot about an uneducated peasant who, through sheer power of will, became the First Lady and unofficial leader of Argentina in the Government of Juan D. Peron.


A Second Term for Mayor Dinkins
At this point in the mayoral election, the cliches of disappointment are getting a real workout: Something must be badly wrong with a system that can't produce candidates better than David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani.
The real issues are being oversimplified.
It doesn't really matter who wins.
The first two statements may apply in this campaign, as they do in most.
But it emphatically does matter that voters choose correctly between Mr.
Dinkins and Mr.
Giuliani.


Neighborhood Report: Crown Heights; Parkway Work Nears Finish
After six years of delays, traffic jams, reports of cost over-runs and citizen protest, the reconstruction of Eastern Parkway will be completed by Thanksgiving Day, the Department of Transportation says.
The timing is coincidental.
"I drove down the parkway last week and got my first look," said Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio.
"I thought I was going to heaven. It was so inviting." But some residents and merchants -- who have complained for years about the disruption of their community, the difficulties faced by pedestrians in safely navigating the road and the increase in traffic accidents -- are still complaining.


After Karajan In Berlin, No Deluge Yet
Behind the desk of Ulrich Meyer-Schoellkopf is a group photograph of the Berlin Philharmonic.
"I always like to have the orchestra behind me," joked Mr.
Meyer-Schoellkopf, the Swiss administrative director of this democratically based ensemble.
Around the walls of his office are large portraits of the five artistic directors who have presided during the orchestra's 111-year history: Hans von Bulow, Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm Furtwangler, Herbert von Karajan and, now, Claudio Abbado.
The first four, at least, are among the most famous conductors in history.
The Berlin Philharmonic, Germany's finest orchestra, has long been counted among the world's elite.
Yet it has made few New York appearances in recent years: a series of Karajan concerts in 1982, a single concert led by James Levine in 1986 and another series led by Bernard Haitink in 1991.
The 1991 concerts were not particularly well received by critics.
So audiences in the United States and Canada have been waiting with special curiosity for Mr.
Abbado's first North American tour with the orchestra, which will include three Mahler programs at Carnegie Hall, starting on Thursday.

Austria's Share of the Danube
I HAVE long associated the Danube with Hungary and especially Budapest, the city so closely defined by the magnificent river that flows through it.
That is because the Danube seems scarcely to make an impression on Vienna as it skirts the capital.
But 60 miles west of Vienna, the river broadens, slicing and curving through hilly Austrian countryside so rich with Baroque abbeys and medieval fortresses, vineyards and villages, bike trails and pleasant back roads, that visitors who thought the river was principally Hungary's are unlikely to make that mistake again.

Residents Battling Boards
ANYONE who has served on the board of a condominium, co-op or homeowners' association will hardly be surprised to learn that a dark mood of frustration and bitterness is festering between boards and residents around the country -- possibly worse than it has ever been.
Common Ground, the bimonthly magazine of the Community Associations Institute, recently devoted five pages to the problem.
And the recent formation of a Regional Council for Homeowner Rights, made up of disgruntled residents in the Washington area is another symptom of the growing discontent.


D.H. Hurts N.L.
To the Sports Editor:
I agree with George Vecsey that it is time to abolish the designated hitter ("Stupid Rule Mars World Series," The Times, Oct. 17).
However, the use of the d.h. in American League home games, along with the prohibition of the d.h. in National League home games, is not, as Vecsey proclaims, a disadvantage to the A.L. team in any meaningful way.
But it clearly hurts the N.L. team.

Two Worlds of Kurt Masur Collide in New York
Ten minutes before curtain time in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center, Kurt Masur faced an unusual kind of dressing-room dilemma: Which set of tails to wear?

Crimes, Lies and Prudential
To the Editor:
A fascinating and frightening story.
Now the firm is spending millions on an advertising campaign to gain the "trust" of the investing public.
The frightening thing is that the ad campaign will be paid for with the money from clients.
This will result in the sheep lining up to be shorn again by Prudential, a company that hasn't the foggiest idea what the word "trust" means.

From Tulipmania to a Glory of Spring
THERE is still time to plant hardy spring-flowering bulbs.
But the opportunity is fast dwindling since the bulbs must grow roots before the ground freezes.
It is these roots that absorb the soil's moisture, which in turn pushes up the leaves and the stems that support the flowers.
Tulips will probably take top priority this year, in celebration of their 400th anniversary.
To mark the event, the Netherlands begins a yearlong tulip quadricentennial.
The country, the center of an industry that propagates more than 3,500 tulip hybrids and species that are planted in gardens all over the world, has long been noted for its beautiful tulips and its vast bulb-growing fields are indeed a sight to be seen.

Tackless Strips Help to Carpet Stairs
CARPETING a straight staircase is not too difficult.
The method shown here uses tackless strips as fasteners instead of old-fashioned stair rods, which prevent stretching carpet tightly, and allows shifting carpeting to expose fresh material as wear develops.
Avoid using slippery carpet for covering stairs.
Also, leave stairs uncovered or cover them with nonskid rubber pads if they are to be used by the aged or handicapped.

Corrections
A chart last Sunday with the heading "Health Care: Clinton's Plan and the Alternatives," misstated aspects of the proposal by Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington.
His plan would impose a payroll tax on individuals as well as employers, and would require individuals to pay "sin taxes." The measure's health security board would also have the authority to revise benefits; it would not be able to establish them.

Those Useless Computer Manuals

The Unmade Star
STRANGE things happen when Jeff Buckley opens his mouth to sing.
One moment he's a white bluesman with a sound straight out of the Mississippi Delta; the next, a jazz singer whose acrobatic voice swoops and glides through a haze of cigarettes and pained memories.
The last thing he sounds like is his age -- only 26.
Even odder, his singing makes otherwise jaded clubgoers and music-business executives rave with none of their usual cynicism.
They will talk of catching Mr.
Buckley at East Village hangouts like Sin-e and the Fez, where they have heard him sing anything from "I Loves You Porgy" to a Sufi chant, an obscure Elton John oldie or one of Mr.
Buckley's own unconventional songs.
And they will talk about his new contract with Sony Records and how Buckley is a name to watch.


From Tulipmania to a Glory of Spring
THERE is still time to plant hardy spring-flowering bulbs.
But the opportunity is fast dwindling since the bulbs must grow roots before the ground freezes.
It is these roots that absorb the soil's moisture, which in turn pushes up the leaves and the stems that support the flowers.
Tulips will probably take top priority this year, in celebration of their 400th anniversary.
To mark the event, the Netherlands begins a yearlong tulip quadricentennial.
The country, the center of an industry that propagates more than 3,500 tulip hybrids and species that are planted in gardens all over the world, has long been noted for its beautiful tulips and its vast bulb-growing fields are indeed a sight to be seen.

Yeltsin Appears in Public to Honor a Hero of the Past
President Boris N. Yeltsin came here today for his first public appearance since the violent showdown in Moscow with his hard-line opponents three weeks ago, but was kept from a mostly friendly crowd by hundreds of police officers and army guards.
Mr.
Yeltsin came to this city about 125 miles northeast of Moscow to dedicate a statue of the 11th-century Prince of Kiev, Yaroslav the Wise, who ruled over Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and created the first written Slavic legal code.

Graveyard Holds a Battle's Bitter Memories
IF any place in Connecticut truly reflects the spookiness of Halloween, it may be an old family graveyard in Ledyard near the Thames River.
For more than 200 years, a spirit of hatred has permeated the cemetery, directed at the man still considered the leading traitor in American history, Benedict Arnold.

New Haven Symphony Marks Its Centennial With New Music
IN 1863, when Morris Steinert attempted to organize an orchestra in New Haven, the "woods were not full of musicians who could play upon orchestral instruments," he later recalled.
The first rehearsals were "simply frightful," he said, and generated such noises "as to frighten the horses which were kept in a livery stable next door, and which immediately signified their displeasure by violently kicking against their stalls in rhythm with the scraping of the fiddles, the windy tones of the flutes, the squeaky harmonics emitted from the yellow clarionets."


Pirate Battles to Keep the Airwaves Open
On a chilly Sunday evening, high in the hills overlooking the San Francisco Bay area, Stephen Dunifer sets down his backpack and prepares to put Radio Free Berkeley on the air.
He pushes a 10-foot antenna into the earth, then wires together a car battery, a sound mixer and microphone, a portable compact-disc player and a home-brew, five-watt radio transmitter.
"The people's technology is ready to strike back," he mumbles, tuning his transmitter to 88.1 FM.
With a flick of the microphone switch, he begins three hours of eclectic and illegal radio broadcasting.


'Demolition Man' Makes Recycling an Art
What do the New York City Department of Sanitation and the action-movie industry have in common?
A passionate belief in the motto: "Recycling! It's the law!"
New York uses the slogan to threaten miscreants who fail to tie up old newspapers.
But the city lags far behind Hollywood, where the unwritten law is that no successful movie concept can ever be tossed out.
After "Die Hard," who would dare make an action film without shattering an abundant amount of glass?


Feeling the Bumps in the Road At the Tokyo Auto Show
IN 1985, visitors to the auto show here were treated to a preview of Honda's new Accord, a car that crossed the Pacific and outsold all American models for three years running.
The 1989 show marked the first sighting of Lexus, the Toyota luxury sedan that displaced Cadillacs, Mercedeses and Jaguars from garages of the wealthy.
The once-obscure Tokyo Motor Show, held every other year, had suddenly become a gallery for the dynamic imagination of Japan's auto industry, whose creations provoked nightmares from Detroit to Turin.

A Dissident's Letters From Prison To Beijing Will Surface in China
Even as he languished in the solitary confinement of a prison cell, China's most famous dissident, who was released last month after serving 14 and a half years, fired off regular letters to China's leaders saying they "deserve a kick in the behind" because they "have done nothing for the people."
Photocopies of the letters from the dissident, Wei Jingsheng, have been smuggled to newspaper publishers in Hong Kong.
Totaling thousands of pages of hand-written Chinese characters, they are soon to be serialized and their contents beamed back into China in radio broadcasts and newspapers.

Promoting Home-Grown Ideas for Cleaner Air
BURTON TRIBBLE came from Kansas to the nation's capital last week to volunteer the services of his 3,000 swine for the Clinton Administration's war against the greenhouse effect.
At the White House, Vice President Al Gore cited the hog farmer as an example of what business can do to cut the emissions of gases that trap the sun's heat within the atmosphere, possibly raising the earth's temperature enough to do serious environmental damage in years to come.


A Steeler Turns Anger Into Commodity
Everything about Greg Lloyd -- the imposing size, the proud stride, the penetrating eyes -- oozes intensity.
This is Lloyd's seventh season as a Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker and this much has always been clear: If he ever found a way to channel his extreme desire and talent, he could become one of the most ferocious and successful linebackers in pro football.

The Campaign for County Clerk
THE office of county clerk is difficult enough to explain, much less attain.
What then if the major candidates for this $91,375-a-year post never meet in debate?
How are voters to learn the issues or whom to support with their ballots?
That is the situation that has developed this year between James P. Doody, the Eastchester Town Supervisor, who is seeking the post on the Democratic ticket, and Leonard N. Spano, a long-term member of the Board of Legislators who is running on the Republican and Conservative lines.

Orangemen Find Miami Far Out of Their League
Near the first half's end, Syracuse wide receiver Shelby Hill decided he could take it no more.
After dropping a pass with no one around him, which typified the Orangemen's plight tonight against the University of Miami, he peered down at the football with disdain.
Then he kicked it high and far off the playing field.
Syracuse's hopes had long since sailed out of the Orange Bowl as Miami punished the Orangemen, 49-0, before a crowd of 63,194.


Stacey Reisner, Peter Reichman
Stacey Meryl Reisner, the daughter of Ira A. and Roberta C. Reisner of Suffern, N.Y., was married last evening to Peter Glenn Reichman, a son of Lee and Phyllis C. Reichman of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.

She is to become the human resources manager for the Dannon Company, the yogurt manufacturer, in White Plains.


Mutual Funds; Using Fees as Rewards, or Penalties
CLEARLY, the idea that investors in mutual funds should reward good performances and penalize poor ones does not rule the industry.
Most fund managements are compensated with a flat fee from investors each year, and only a small group of managers are paid a bonus when their performance figures are strong, and "fined" a portion of the fee when their results are not.
Recent decisions by two funds, one of which dropped a performance-based fee, while the other initiated one -- show that the debate is still alive as to which type of fee is a better performance incentive.


9-0 Leafs Set Start-up Mark
Maple Leafs 2, Lightning 0
The Toronto Maple Leafs broke the National Hockey League record for most victories at the start of the season, winning their ninth straight with a 2-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning last night in St.
Petersburg, Fla.


Club Carousel's Debut: 'South Pacific'
IN the 50th anniversary year of "Oklahoma!" why shouldn't a newly reopened theater be called Club Carousel and put on "South Pacific"?
Everybody loves Rodgers and Hammerstein and theme celebrations are in.
Formerly the Darien Dinner Theater and then Connecticut's Broadway Theater, Club Carousel offers dinner and theater, though both appear, at this stage, to be a pipe dream.
Under new management, with an artistic director and producer (Cathye A. Fitzgerald) and a changing schedule of future productions and performances, the theater and the lobby are redesigned in pale pink and blue to resemble a cross between an amusement park and a gaming resort, neither allowing for taste and elegance to intrude.


Reform Judaism Head Seeks Converts
Departing from a longstanding Jewish reluctance to proselytize, the leader of Reform Judaism in North America yesterday encouraged Jews to seek converts among those who do not have their own faith.
The rabbi, Alexander M. Schindler, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, announced a $5 million program "to reach out to those of our neighbors who belong to no church" or no other religion.


Does Fashion Matter?
Fashion has always been a favorite victim of wits, savants, celebrities and curmudgeons.
In the 40's, Fashions of The Times occasionally ran a column called "What They Say About Fashion," a collection of quotes like this zinger from Ralph Waldo Emerson: "The sense of being perfectly well-dressed gives a feeling of inward tranquillity which religion is powerless to bestow."


Finding Surprises In Corporate Galleries
DISCOVERING craft objects on the walls and pedestals of an art gallery can be a novel experience for some people.
The surprise is magnified when those walls and pedestals are right smack on the first floor of the company where they work or do business.
In the galleries at the Johnson &amp; Johnson World Headquarters in New Brunswick and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in Lawrenceville, employees and visitors are stopping to look and pick their favorite craft objects, often after a long, pithy discussion.

If Simon Says, 'Lie Down in the Road,' Should You?
BY now it is impossible to see the most notorious scene in the movie "The Program": drunken college-football players lie down along the divider-line of a highway and live to tell about it.
Though the scene has "stuntmen" written all over it, a teen-aged boy died and two others were seriously injured recently, imitating the daredevil trick.
Last week, Touchstone Pictures deleted the episode from the film.
Here are some scenes that remain: the hero drunkenly plays chicken with an oncoming train; a pumped-up player on steroids smashes car windows with his head, his way of celebrating making the team.
This is all dangerous behavior and depicted as stupidly self-destructive.
Should those scenes be snipped out, too, in case they give someone bad ideas?


Airline Seats: Not Always First Come First Served
WHO gets the good seats in the coach section of an airplane?
The answer is as fraught with hierarchy as Byzantium.
When the travel agent opens the computer record for your coach flight, seeking to get you into an aisle seat close to the front exit, the diagram may show that that seat and other aisle seats back quite a way have been designated for frequent-flier members with high mileages or those who pay the full coach price.
Whatever the terminology, the computer may "rope off" choice seats for passengers who travel the airline often or reserve at the last minute and thus at a high price.
USAir, which still has an old-fashioned policy of first come first served, says it, too, should be holding out good seats for late-booking business travelers, and it is preparing to shift over.
"It makes a lot of sense," said J. Daniel Brock, USAir's vice president for marketing and services.
"We've got to have a system that saves good seats for those travelers who pay $600 for a last-minute ticket. Those seats cannot all go to a leisure traveler who paid $200."


World Markets; European Stocks Look Good -- for Now
INVESTORS in European equities made it clear how happy they were about falling interest rates last week when they pushed stock indices on most major markets to all-time highs.
But with valuations of many stocks reaching multiples that are high, if not unprecedented, by historical standards, some analysts are asking: How long can this year's European bull market be sustained?
The answer seems to be that it has enough support in most markets to continue into next year, albeit with some risks.
But then the outlook gets murkier.
The markets have been rising merrily all year, lately on the assumption that interest rate reductions would spark economic recovery and make equities more attractive than rate-sensitive investments.
But until last week, rates had not been falling as fast or as far as many economists had predicted, especially following the near-collapse of the European exchange-rate system this summer.

Regarding "Harvard Law '55 (Pre-Ginsburg); Now, Alone at the Top" (Oct. 10), women invaded the male power structure at utilities long before Joan T. Bok of New England Electric System.


How They Stole the Story
SUITED COMMUTERS, glitzedup night-on-the-towners, cityfolk returning from a weekend spent in sweat pants and suntan oil.
Anyone inching up to the Queens Midtown Tunnel during August and September couldn't miss the billboard that was positively sneering at them.
"You're going to New York dressed like that?" The dig came courtesy of Charivari, the Manhattan fashion retailer.


Neighborhood Report: Midtown; After 30 Years It's Ciao, Giordano
Geography finally got the best of Giordano, a once-thriving Italian restaurant in an area many say has become a wasteland -- 39th Street off Ninth Avenue, at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.
A family business for more than 30 years, Giordano closed this month.
Often called the Mamma Leone's of the far West Side, the restaurant was founded by Giordano Creglia in 1959, when it was popular among longshoremen.
Then theater people came, followed by college students and workers in the fashion industry.
Recently, though, customers were afraid to walk in the area, the restaurateurs say.


Duke University Installs a Woman as Its President
On a day that was a mix of pomp and populism, Nannerl O. Keohane was inaugurated today as the eighth president of Duke University, becoming the only woman serving as the permanent head of one of the nation's top research universities.
In an interview on Friday, Mrs.
Keohane, the 53-year-old daughter of a Presbyterian minister from Blytheville, Ark., defended American universities against accusations that they were overrun with "political correctness," saying the public debate has reflected a few widely publicized incidents rather than any widespread effort to impose a new academic orthodoxy.


If Only Dykstra Could Pitch In Relief
Lenny Dykstra likes to live life on the edge, that he will never deny.
He likes things to be risky, to be dramatic.
He likes the pressure to be magnified.
And so when he walked to the plate in the top of the seventh inning tonight in the Skydome, Dykstra most certainly was in his element.
It was the sixth game of the World Series, a do-or-die game for his Phillies.
Philadelphia was down by four runs, 5-1, and one game from post-season elimination.
From the feel of the Skydome, the Toronto fans seemed to think it was only a matter of time before their celebration began.

Austria's Share of the Danube
I HAVE long associated the Danube with Hungary and especially Budapest, the city so closely defined by the magnificent river that flows through it.
That is because the Danube seems scarcely to make an impression on Vienna as it skirts the capital.
But 60 miles west of Vienna, the river broadens, slicing and curving through hilly Austrian countryside so rich with Baroque abbeys and medieval fortresses, vineyards and villages, bike trails and pleasant back roads, that visitors who thought the river was principally Hungary's are unlikely to make that mistake again.


The Tale of Brutus, Recounted in Gold
OLD coins are like little bits of history.
The auction of ancient Greek and Roman coins that Sotheby's is scheduled to hold on Tuesday in Zurich makes this clear.
Electrum coins from Lydia at the time of Croesus, more than 2,500 years ago, and 2,400-year-old Sicilian coins will share the block with much younger Roman solidi, from the fifth century A.D.


Bradley Pays the Price of Education
The ball went down into the low post to Shawn Bradley, moving Jimmy Lynam noticeably forward in his courtside seat.
The general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers was looking for hope, for a rare ray of light from the young man whose head almost seems nestled in the clouds.
Patrick Ewing was between Bradley and the basket, his left elbow embedded in Bradley's lower back, his intentions not unlike some belligerent bouncer at the front door of a rowdy disco.


Streetscapes/The Yankees' Stadiums; Site-Searching -- an Old, Tumultuous Story
ANXIETY, intrigue and confusion seem to mark the current negotiations over the New York Yankees, who have contemplated leaving their 1923 stadium in the Bronx for either New Jersey or a Manhattan site in the far West 30's.
But the history of the club's stadium plans suggests that turmoil is only the normal condition.
The Yankees were established in 1903 as the Highlanders, part of the two-year-old American League's challenge to the National League, established in 1876.
Their first ball park, with bleachers for 15,000, was on the west side of Broadway, from 165th to 168th Street, then in the path of New York's first subway and now the site of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center.


America, Through a Glass Darkly, By a Fascinated Englishman
American plays have been the order of the day in London this year, with "Marvin's Room," "The Piano Lesson" and "Three Hotels," among many others, crossing the Atlantic to varying degrees of success.
In March, the Royal Court Theater, a playhouse best known for promoting new British writing, opened its own "American season" with Anna Deavere Smith's "Fires in the Mirror." Under the joint auspices of two longtime admirers of American drama -- Max Stafford-Clark, then the theater's artistic director, and Stephen Daldry, who holds the post now -- Howard Korder's "Search and Destroy" and David Mamet's "Oleanna" followed.
So did an "American" play with a difference: it was written by an Englishman.
Martin Crimp, the 37-year-old author, wrote "The Treatment" in the summer of 1992, finishing it aptly enough on July 4.
His inspiration came from his first-ever trip to the United States in 1991.
On a playwrights' exchange between the Royal Court and New Dramatists in New York, he was clearly intrigued by what he found in the New World.


The Searcher


A Whitman Fan
To the Sports Editor:
Evidently, Timm Rosenbach ("Walking Away, While He Still Can," The Times, Oct. 3) is not only an athlete but a scholar.
Rosenbach commented about those "barbaric yawps," as he called them, when breaking from a huddle and the players began screaming like maniacs.
He knows the verse of Walt Whitman, America's greatest poet, very well.


Far From Capital's Brutality, Another Somalia Finds Hope
Just 140 miles west of the violent Somali capital, this bush town is going rather placidly about its business, opening newly whitewashed hotels to traveling businessmen, restoring fields and replenishing herds.
Known as the "city of death" at the height of the country's famine last year, Baidoa is no longer starving.
The rains and the last harvest have been good, so relief agencies no longer distribute free food.
Trucks jam the town's crowded marketplace, and herds of cows wander across the main street.


Elizabeth Emerson and John Lewiecki

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Rolling, Rolling, Rolling
THE human bowling ball has come to Long Island.
In between the salad course and the four choices of entrees, the guests at Craig Sepler's bar mitzvah in Jericho were being strapped into a giant cage, turned upside down and spun across the room toward a row of giant canvas bowling pins.
Splat!
A strike.
This was fun?
"It's the best," said Brooke Goldman, 13, after she had been helped out of the ball and staggered back to her dinner seat.

Felony Charges Against Oregon Law Official
The Clatsop County District Attorney was indicted on Wednesday on charges that she fabricated a drug indictment against two police officers and tried to dismiss a traffic citation given to her husband.
The District Attorney, Julie Ann Leonhardt, 37, an Astoria native who was elected last year by a landslide over a three-term incumbent, will be arraigned Friday in Clatsop County Circuit Court on a dozen criminal charges: four felony charges of first-degree forgery, two misdemeanor charges of tampering with public records and six counts of official misconduct.


Eating Aboard
To the Editor: I read with interest your article on the Montrealer Amtrak train between New York and Montreal (Sept. 12).
I recently rode the sister day train, the Adirondack, from New York to Montreal.
Your comments on the not-too-grand cuisine are even more significant for those riding the daytime route.
We had a choice of egg salad sandwiches, chicken nuggets or microwaved chicken sandwiches on this 10-hour ride.
Though the route up the Hudson and along Lake Champlain is magnificent, it became a long hungry ride for many of the passengers.


Rutgers Falls Short Trying to Follow Last Year's Script

White Plains Facing a Three-Way Mayor Race
WHEN Alfred Del Vecchio, the 18-year incumbent Mayor of this city, lost the Republican primary last month, it was another indication that the political tide here was shifting.
White Plains was once a Republican stronghold, but Democrats gained control of the Common Council two years ago.
Now, the mayor's office is up for grabs, with a three-way race that is likely to split Republican voters and pave the way for a Democrat to run the city.
Mayor Del Vecchio, who lost the primary by 85 votes, is running on the Conservative line.
He is still a popular figure in White Plains and will undoubtedly attract votes.
The Republican candidate, Michael Coffey, a Common Council member for 18 years and owner of a moving and storage company, will be competing with Mr.
Del Vecchio for both Conservative and Republican support.
Reaping the benefits of the division may be the Democratic candidate, Sy J. Schulman, who has served on the Common Council for two years and is the former president of the County Association.


Neighborhood Report: Upper West Side; School Fights to Save a Garden
Should a garden across from Louis D. Brandeis High School be turned into a housing project?
The parents say no, but the city Housing Authority is still trying to get the Board of Education to say yes.
The DOME Garden, named after its organizing group, Development of Opportunities Through Meaningful Education, has been across from Brandeis for 15 years.
The Housing Authority wants to move it to the Brandeis schoolyard, clearing the way for 35 units of low-income housing at the 9,000-square-foot garden site, on West 84th Street between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues.
But school administrators, teachers and parents say the schoolyard is already too small for the overcrowded school.


Help Offered by Family Advocates
In regard to "Group Attacked Over Legal Advice"  [ Sept. 26 ] , I would like to express my outrage and disgust over your portrayal of Family Advocates as a radical group involved in the practice of law without a license.
This is hardly true.
This group stands for the preservation of the family, not its utter destruction, as condoned and enforced by the legal system of the State of New York, all for the profit of the lawyers and judges involved.

Yeltsin Gets Some Comfort From Clinton
IT was a message of support and encouragement that Secretary of State Warren Christopher delivered to President Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow last week.
The purpose of the visit, part of a trip that also took in Hungary, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Latvia, was to reassure Mr.
Yeltsin that the Clinton Administration would stick with him all the way to democracy and a market economy, to urge him to avoid backsliding on freedom of the press, and to tell him not to worry that Washington had strategic designs on his back yard in eastern Europe.

Racial Role-Playing And Guises of Politics
To the Editor:
Brent Staples's criticism of the actor Ted Danson, after his appearance in blackface at a Friars Club roast honoring Whoopi Goldberg, both misinterprets Mr.

Chief State's Attorney Vows to Fight Gangs
CONNECTICUT'S new Chief State's Attorney, John M. Bailey, leaned forward at his desk in his Wallingford office and delivered what might be considered a declaration of war against the people who are terrorizing the state's cities.
"I want to get the career criminals, the ones who prey on people," he said.
"I want people who commit violent crimes put away. The first role of government is public safety. If you can't have a system where people feel safe and can go to work in safety, then we have a government that is failing." Backlash Against Lawlessness
And, Mr.
Bailey said, a backlash is developing against lawlessness.
"There's a whole new feeling out there," Mr.
Bailey said.
"I'm speaking to organizations at least three nights a week around the state and people are saying they've had it and they don't want fluff for an answer. They're fed up."


For Clinton, A Place on the Bottom Line
AS a self-proclaimed New Democrat, President Clinton has tried to show that he has a warmer heart toward business than the Democrats of old.
Notwithstanding corporate America's traditional skepticism toward Democrats, executives have been willing to give Mr.
Clinton a hearing, but the bottom line is what his policies will mean for their companies' bottom line.
On that, the jury is still out.
With an eye to helping business, Mr.
Clinton has vowed to speed up growth, remove trade barriers and cut corporate health care costs.
He has also pushed through a deficit-reduction plan, which his aides assert has gone far to push down long-term interest rates.
All this, the Administration vows, will fatten profits.

Profile: Kenneth Stone; His Message for Mom &amp; Pop: There's Life After Wal-Mart
IN the late 1980's, after spending more than a decade helping Iowa towns and businesses cope with change, a rising tide of phone calls and speaking invitations alerted Dr.
Kenneth Stone that he might have the best data in the nation on what happens when Wal-Mart and other mass merchants move into a community.
Since then, the mild-mannered 57-year-old Iowa State University economist has diligently accumulated something even more precious: insights into how local retailers can survive -- even thrive -- when Wal-Mart and its competitors, like Kmart, the nation's No. 2 retail chain, roar into town.

Seeing Hartford's History on the Victorian Trail
In the latter part of the 19th century, Hartford was a bustling center of commerce, and the arts, and home to such people as Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe.

If Staten Island Votes to Secede, What Will Albany Do?
Ten days before their long-awaited referendum on self-government, Staten Islanders are whipping up secessionist sentiment by singing separatist anthems, staging freedom rides and circulating declarations of independence, on parchment no less.
They have taken to comparing State Senator John J. Marchi, the father of secession, to George Washington.
Frustration has simmered for so long on Staten Island that some residents complain that even secession will not salve their anger.
"What we ought to do is tear down the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and let us get back to life the way it used to be," said Katherine J. Winter, a retiree who has lived on Staten Island for all of her 68 years.

Who Invented Brunswick Stew? Hush Up and Eat.
MENTION Brunswick stew to a Southerner and you're likely to hear lyrical accounts of open fires, black iron pots, and a mess of squirrel, rabbit and possum that somebody's daddy brought home.
Never mind that hardly anyone now alive has ever taken part in such a ritual -- it's all part of the legend.
Also integral to the legend is the rivalry between Georgia and Virginia about the origins of the dish, made nowadays with chicken and a variety of meats and vegetables.
On the surface, the dispute is geographical: Was the dish first prepared in the county of Brunswick, Virginia or in the town of Brunswick, Georgia?
Both states stand firmly behind their local tales and archival records, but it's when the talk gets closer to home -- to questions of texture, essential ingredients, methods of preparation, taste -- that things really get hot.


A Voucher Plan for Crowded Schools
With this middle-class suburb experiencing a surge in school enrollment, a grass-roots movement is proposing a voucher system to let parents use public money to send their children to private schools.

Fourth Place and Farewell To East Coast for Antley
Chris Antley didn't exactly go riding off into the sunset yesterday at Aqueduct.
But, in his last major ride before transplanting his career to California, the 27-year-old jockey finished fourth aboard the favored filly McKaymackenna in the $150,000 Aqueduct Cup while Earlie Fires was riding One Dreamer to a long-shot victory.
It seemed a long time since Antley had reached the peak of his career by winning the 1991 Kentucky Derby with Strike the Gold, and even longer since he had won more races than any other rider in the country in 1985.
And he conceded that the good times had been followed by dwindling times.

Advertisements for Themselves: A Letter from Lewis Lapham
To the Editor:
Every publishing season sponsors at least one cause celebre, and in New York this fall the merchants of high-end literary opinion assigned the show window to a book that dwells, not surprisingly, on themselves.
"New York Days" (review, Sept. 5) is a sentimental memoir in which the author, Willie Morris, describes his tenure as the editor of Harper's Magazine in the years 1967-71 as a lost golden age of American letters, when journalism was poetry and all the writers at all the tables at Elaine's were the natural children of William Faulkner or Henry James.


Crunch Time for Expansion Cities
The owners of the National Football League's 28 teams will meet on Tuesday in a conference room at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare hotel in Chicago.
When they leave the room, perhaps late in the night or early the next morning, they will have brought joy to the two cities they selected for expansion franchises and sadness and frustration to the three losers.
Of the five bidding cities, the favorites are St.
Louis, Baltimore and Charlotte.
The outsiders are Jacksonville and Memphis.
The situation is further complicated because if St.
Louis does not receive an expansion franchise, the New England Patriots may move there.
Even insiders are unsure how the voting will go.
The two new teams will start playing in 1995.
They will pay a franchise fee of $140 million each, as opposed to the $16 million paid by Seattle and Tampa Bay when the league last expanded, 1974 for the 1976 season.
Millions and Millions More
The $140 million franchise cost is only the beginning.
Each new team will need at least $70 million in operating funds.
By last week, each bidding group (there are two from Baltimore) was required to filea $20 million letter of credit with the league.
All complied except for St.
Louis, whose letter is expected by Tuesday morning.
For the winning groups, the $20 million will represent an installment on the first payment to the league of $42 million, due on Nov. 1.


NEWS ABOUT THE MAGAZINE
This issue of the magazine presents three occasions for comment.
As a special report on fashion in the past 50 years, it is an apt place in which to note the retirement -- that is the quasi retirement -- of Carrie Donovan as the Magazine's style editor.
It is a theme issue, the first since the Clinton Inauguration.
Finally, this is the last issue of the Magazine in its present format.
From time to time, the Magazine devotes an entire issue to a single theme.
Just as the Jan. 17 issue examined American politics from serious and not-so-serious perspectives, this issue examines the influence of fashion on daily life since Fashions of The Times began in 1943.
In many ways, fashion has had as much influence on Americans in that time as politics.

OCT. 17-23: Los Angeles Verdict; A Jury Takes a Lenient View
In the Denny Beating Once again, a vivid videotape of a brutal beating has failed to convince a jury in a high-profile trial in racially divided Los Angeles.

But the jury acquitted him of five other felony counts.
He faces sentences that could total from two to eight years.

Insiders and Outsiders
ON Tuesday night, a light-heavyweight rain was falling in nagging little drops on the black felt hat of Joe Frazier, the former heavyweight boxing champion.
Like countless other V.I.P.'s and friends of the owners of the Harley-Davidson Cafe at 56th Street and Avenue of the Americas, Mr.
Frazier had been temporarily shut out of the restaurant's overcrowded grand opening, and he didn't know how to get through the mob or the police barricades.
"I lost my son," Mr.

Neighborhood Report: Lower Manhattan; Fighting for the Freedom to Sell Art on the Streets
Robert Bery's first venture into selling his art on New York's sidewalks was short-lived.
After he had been showing his paintings on Wall Street for an hour, undercover police officers confiscated his works.
He was arrested, handcuffed and jailed.
What happened to Mr.
Bery is increasingly common in Greenwich Village, TriBeCa, SoHo and other downtown neighborhoods where artists live, have studios and market their works.
The charge against him was selling merchandise without a vendor's license.
But he couldn't get a permit, because the legal limit of 852 licenses was already taken and the waiting list was closed.


Irish Steamroll Past U.S.C.

Microsoft Office version 4.0 -- an all-in-one package comprising the Windows versions of Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Mail -- is greater than the sum of its parts.
The latest version of Microsoft Office, introduced last week, has the potential to change the way business users of personal computers buy and use software.


Neighborhood Report: Long Island City/Woodside; Parking Lot for a New Ferry May Bring Headaches
The people of Long Island City have for years lived, uneasily, with legions of commuters coursing through their neighborhood -- in cars, buses and trains -- on their way to or from Manhattan.
Now, though, residents in this Queens neighborhood are bracing for a plan that they maintain would add to the onslaught: a proposal for East River ferry service that allows commuters to leave their cars in a 500-car parking lot in Long Island City before sailing toward Manhattan.


Upstart Wisconsin Upset By Gophers
Minnesota 28, Wisconsin 21
Scott Eckers passed for 267 yards and two touchdowns and Chris Darkins scored twice as Minnesota beat previously undefeated Wisconsin, 28-21, last night in Minneapolis.


From Tulipmania to a Glory of Spring
THERE is still time to plant hardy spring-flowering bulbs.
But the opportunity is fast dwindling since the bulbs must grow roots before the ground freezes.
It is these roots that absorb the soil's moisture, which in turn pushes up the leaves and the stems that support the flowers.
Tulips will probably take top priority this year, in celebration of their 400th anniversary.
To mark the event, the Netherlands begins a yearlong tulip quadricentennial.
The country, the center of an industry that propagates more than 3,500 tulip hybrids and species that are planted in gardens all over the world, has long been noted for its beautiful tulips and its vast bulb-growing fields are indeed a sight to be seen.

Chaos Theory
Today, there is only one fashion rule: Be true to you.
But that's not as simple as it sounds.
In fact, modern dress codes are more complex than ever.
Choosing from inexhaustible options, people put themselves together not in a random way, but rather to announce their identities.
Here are some examples.

Not in Praise of Dogs: They Should Be Banned
To the Editor:
I could hardly contain myself when I read the reference to Jack Russell terriers as an example of dogs that bark persistently for no reason other than to hear themselves.
That is a slur of the worst kind.


Actions of Japan Peacekeepers in Cambodia Raise Questions and Criticism
In the dun-colored, desert-like plains of southeastern Cambodia, Capt.
Kohji Maeda of the Japanese Self Defense Forces offered a farewell tour of the military camp that his wide-eyed Cambodian neighbors had taken to calling "viang" -- a palace.
Captain Maeda pointed out the air-conditioned barracks with satellite television, the filtration plant able to purify 70 tons of water a day, the row of vending machines that accepted 100-yen coins for ice-cold cans of Japanese beer, the cafeteria that served only Japanese fare and the Japanese-style bath houses with communal tubs and computerized temperature controls.

OCT. 17-23: A New Feud in Somalia; The Secretary General Makes a Defiant Visit To Mogadishu
At odds over how best to proceed in Somalia, the United States and the United Nations have fallen farther into a feud.
Their biggest rupture yet came last week as the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, defied warnings from Washington and made a sudden visit to Mogadishu, setting off the kind of street protests the Clinton Administration had sought to avert.
The incident served as a display of the willful pride of the Secretary General, who has been determined to advertise his independence from the United States.
While the demonstrations in Somalia died down quickly, the tensions they ignited seemed less likely to settle in Washington, where Clinton Administration officials already blame the U.N. and its representatives for leading policy toward Somalia astray.

Johnny Johnson scrambled from two potential tacklers and threw a 15-yard touchdown to Jim Klein with 34 seconds remaining, giving unranked Illinois a 24-21 upset of Michigan yesterday and its first victory at Ann Arbor, Mich., since 1966.


Scientist Clones Human Embryos, And Creates an Ethical Challenge
A university researcher in Washington has, as an experiment, cloned human embryos, splitting single embryos into identical twins or triplets.
This appears to be the first time such a feat has been reported.
The scientist, Dr.
Jerry L. Hall of George Washington University Medical Center, reported his work at a recent meeting of the American Fertility Society.
The experiment was not a technical breakthrough, since he used methods that are commonly used to clone animal embryos, but it opens a range of practical and ethical questions.


Life Sign Takes Crown
Life Sign, the 7-10 favorite driven by John Campbell, clinched divisional honors by winning the Cadillac Breeders Crown 3-year-old pace for colts today at Freehold Raceway.
Life Sign, who battled all season with Riyadh and Presidential Ball, left no doubt about the 3-year-old pacing division today, finishing a neck ahead of the hard-charging Beastmaster and 2 lengths ahead of Broadway Jate -- two opponents who didn't figure to challenge.
Presidential Ball, driven by Jack Moiseyev, finished fifth, and Riyadh, who was driven by Jim Morrill Jr. and challenged Life Sign for the lead during most of the mile, tired and finished seventh.

Couch Potatoes, Indeed
To the Editor:
The article provides a good example of why the Clinton health plan should be tabled.
It displays the effect of having the opinionated make the rules.
Dr.
Barzel proposes to have the obese singled out to pay more for health insurance.
It seems that there are "good" behaviors and "bad" behaviors.
Obesity is one of those which can be the basis for discrimination of all kinds.
If the obese are to pay the "real" cost of their health care, then why not have those with AIDS pay the real cost?
How about those with birth or other genetic defects?
Those on dialysis?
And so on.

A Too-Short Wish List
To the Editor:
I hope that Frank Rich has faxed his wish list to Sony, Angel et al.
My only fault with it is that it's too short.
Everything by Harold Rome should be in print, including "Pins and Needles" and the intriguingly titled "Zulu and the Zayda." Don't laugh -- "Zulu" had some great tunes.
All of Frank Loesser should also be available, and I am personally curious about Harold Arlen (surely, "Wizard of Oz" wasn't all he did).


Corrections
A column on June 20, "If You're Thinking of Living in Morningside Heights," misstated the number of postwar buildings in that Manhattan neighborhood.
Several apartment houses, including the Morningside Gardens co-op, the General Grant Houses and faculty housing for Columbia University, were built after World War II.
A reader noted the error in a letter dated June 20; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

Help Offered by Family Advocates
The courts of New York have taken many productive working citizens out of their homes and jobs and put them in jail with little or no regard to their being parents of children of what is usually a dysfunctional situation.
These children need special attention at this time by both parents to reassure that they are not the cause of the separation of the family.
They are victims.
The courts need to recognize that the children of today are at a learning stage to be the parents of tomorrow.


Woolworth to Shut Down 37 Variety Stores
As part of a nationwide retrenchment announced recently, the Woolworth Corporation will close 37 of its 103 variety stores in New York City, where generations of one-stop shoppers have gone for everything from hair spray to cough drops to Halloween costumes.
The company is also considering moving out of its corporate headquarters building on lower Broadway.
The company said Oct. 13 that it would close a total of 970 sites nationwide.
The cutback in New York stores, said Frances Trachter, vice president of public affairs, is "very representative of our repositioning to focus our presence in big urban areas." She added: "We want to keep stores in vital downtown areas where people work and live and where there are tourist factors."


OCT. 17-23: Drug Wars, Cont.; Clinton's Pass At Treatment
With the presentation of his drug strategy last week, President Clinton suggested that he was emphasizing rehabilitation and prevention -- a welcome departure to drug experts who have come to believe that the Reagan-Bush formula, devoting 70 percent of their drug budgets to law enforcement, had spent maximum money on minimal results.

A Year Later, the Focus Has Shifted From a Lost Sailor to His Boat
It will be a year on Wednesday since Mike Plant's abortive call for help from the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
The 41-year-old solo sailor was lost at sea on his way to a racing event.
But the story of his sailboat continues, in the form of a $6 million lawsuit and another yacht race.


Sports of The Times; No Haunting Out For the Phillies
BABE RUTH did it trying to steal second.
Otis Nixon did it bunting.
Willie Wilson did it striking out for a record 12th time.
Shoeless Joe Jackson did it grounding to the second baseman.
Willie McCovey did it lashing a line drive with the tying run at third and the winning run at second in the seventh game.
What they did was make the last out in a World Series -- a haunting memory that the Phillies escaped last night.


Supercollision
When physicists were trying to persuade Congress to spend billions on a 54-mile underground racetrack for subatomic particles, they promised exciting spinoffs, like more powerful magnets and advanced tunnel digging techniques -- practicalities politicians might come to love.
But what they were truly hoping for was a glimpse of something subtler and harder to sell: a hypothetical particle called the Higgs boson.
Studying the Higgs boson, if it indeed exists, held out the barely tangible promise of an explanation for how the beautifully symmetrical laws of physics, said to rule creation, gave birth to such a messy, asymmetrical world.


Tackless Strips Help to Carpet Stairs
CARPETING a straight staircase is not too difficult.
The method shown here uses tackless strips as fasteners instead of old-fashioned stair rods, which prevent stretching carpet tightly, and allows shifting carpeting to expose fresh material as wear develops.
Avoid using slippery carpet for covering stairs.
Also, leave stairs uncovered or cover them with nonskid rubber pads if they are to be used by the aged or handicapped.

Health Reform and the Lawyers
To the Editor:
Dr.
Ribnik's hatred of lawyers stems from guilt about his own profession.
Less than two years ago, I was told by my obstetrics and gynecology group that unless we had paid in full more than two months before my due date, the hospital and the group would be unable to deliver my child.
More recently, I underwent surgery for wisdom teeth, at a surgical group that had told me my insurance would cover the entire cost of the operation.
It covered only 25 percent of their bill.
My son's friend fell in the park and his mother took him directly to his pediatrician's office; the doctor refused to see him because his mother was unable to pay him immediately, having left her checkbook at home.


For the Disabled, Some Progress
TO Itzhak Perlman, a polio victim at age 4 who gets around in a motorized wheelchair, wears leg braces and uses metal crutches to walk, the question of access is all-important.
"A lot of people think access means the ability to get into a building, no matter where or how you can get into it, whether you get into it through a back alley, or through an elevator that usually carries garbage or food," the renowned violinist says.
"But shouldn't it mean that you can get into the building through the front door with everybody else? That for me is true access."
Not quite two years ago, the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act took effect, requiring that owners or operators of places of public accommodation remove architectural barriers to the disabled if the changes are "readily achievable." The law was hailed as a civil-rights statute that would remove many of the countless barriers that block the physically disabled from having easy access to offices, hotels, restaurants, theaters, airports and other public spaces.


Staff Cats
To the Editor: A double helping of appreciation for Alice Furlaud's "France's Three-Star Cats" (Aug. 22), which charmed and entertained us in its own right, but also reminded us of our own unexpected encounter with another feline hotel staff member.
Although we've come almost to assume a cat will attend us at most American bed and breakfasts, we've never found one in residence at the more formal hotels in this country.
Perhaps because such an expectation never entered our minds, we were surprised and delighted to find the marmalade cat Gainsborough seeing to her morning toilette while comfortably ensconced upon a brocaded sofa in the drawing room of the Dower House at the Royal Crescent in Bath, England.


Maybe Paul Simon Had It All Wrong
"BLACK and white are the colors of photography," Robert Frank declared in 1961, succinctly announcing his position in a controversy that's as old as the medium itself.
And on the other side is Paul Simon, singing of the wonders of Kodachrome: "Makes you think all the world's a sunny day."
The argument about whether black-and-white or color is more artistic, or more truthful, or just plain better has raged since photography's advent in 1839.
But for many years the debate was moot.
Color printing processes, when they existed at all, were tedious to use and tended to produce disappointing results.
Many photographers hand-colored pictures they'd taken in black-and-white, but that seemed less than satisfactory.

Jets Are Still Evolving, Evolving and Evolving
Forever.
It seems as if the Jets have been evolving forever.
And today becomes one of those Sundays when a clue emerges: Where are they?
And where are they going?
Although Coach Bruce Coslet tried to orchestrate the news media's questions this week -- don't talk to the players about any game beyond today's American Conference East meeting with the Buffalo Bills -- everyone knows today's contest is only the first of a three-part test for the Jets.
Next Sunday, the Jets play the Giants, and the following week face the Dolphins.


Sports of The Times; Jays Cross Baseball's Great Divide
REMEMBER a few years ago when every body particularly self-deprecating Canadian fans -- brooded there might be some kind of frozen-north impediment to the Blue Jays?
Free agents like Paul Molitor and Dave Winfield and Dave Stewart would not choose to mess with visas and tax adustments.
The reserved Ontario fans would not know how to push the Blue Jays home.
Somehow a Canadian team would find a way to stumble.
You heard that stuff up here.
"Winfield Called: He Still Wants More Noise," one banner said last night, referring to Dave Winfield, the Zorba who taught the Blue Jays' fans how to roar last season.


Business Diary: October 17 - 22
COMPANIES Ever Get Burned by a Fast-Talking Broker?
Now, Some Justice  Who says the small investor can't get justice?
Who says you're out of luck when your broker assures you something's safe and you lose your shirt?
Last week the little guy scored big when Prudential Securities agreed to pay $371 million to settle charges that it defrauded 400,000 investors.
Part of that is fines, but the bulk of it -- $330 million -- will go to investors who can prove they got false promises or were otherwise cheated. (If, eyes wide open, you took a flier on a high-risk limited partnership and lost, forget it.) In 1989, Drexel agreed to shell out $650 million, but that was big-game stuff involving institutional investors; this is the largest settlement ever involving the mistreatment of, say, retirees who see modest nest eggs hacked away by fast-talking brokers.
And it may get even bigger: Prudential, which made $1 billion on limited partnerships, must pay all claims -- no limits, no statutes of limitations.


Godfather Of Sole
WHAT THEY ARE: A karate kick of irreverence, size-10 boxing shoes in blood-red high-top leatherette (plastic) with cream-colored rubber soles.
And they are crisscross-laced with about a dozen flat-wound, cotton athletic shoestrings, in sky blue, purple, argyle or gold, tied in large, loose, loopy bows.
WHERE THEY'RE FOUND: On the 53-year-old feet of George Clinton, the zany godfather of funk music.
The foot-stomping, blues-based, rock-and-R-and-B-fused sound has made him the funkiest man on the planet (and sometimes off).
And so go his shoes.
The shoes are also featured in the album art of Mr.
Clinton's latest recording, "Hey Man . . . Smell My Finger," on Prince's Paisley Park Records. (And Prince is someone else with a fetish for uplifting footwear.) WHAT THEY REALLY, REALLY ARE: Attitude with sole.
Like Elvis's (late Vegas period) oversize belt buckle, Louis Armstrong's handkerchief, James Brown's conked kinks and the omnipresent scarf that Aerosmith's Steven Tyler clings to when he sings, Mr.
Clinton's shoes, no matter which ones he wears, are a show-biz-hyped distillation and projection of his style.
And what a style: from a pair of five-inch-high platform sneakers to feathered, mid-calf-length, hand-stitched trapper boots.
Mr.
Clinton, a former hairdresser in Newark who likes to wear his hair these days in a freaked-out, funny fright wig of braids, tresses and coiled multicolored yarn, was recently quoted in Interview magazine as saying, "I can wear any style -- or have no style -- and it doesn't bother me." WHY: Funk feeds the deep nostalgia of inner-city baby boomers and the insatiable hunger of members of the hip-hop generation, who've sampled songs like Mr.
Clinton's "Atomic Dog," "Flash Light" and "P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)" with abandon and reverence.
And thus Mr.
Clinton is high-stepping the pace of his almost-30-year recording career.
A resurgence of 1970's-era disco and funk music is also sweeping the nation, stirring a storm of interest and dollars in Mr.
Clinton's various musical incarnations, including his solo act and his role as leader of the eccentric Parliament-Funkadelic funk mob.
Re-releases of early albums are planned, as well as a major Clinton tour, record executives said.
ADDITIONAL CLINTON PROPS: Funky eye wear, diapers, United States Army-surplus fatigues, chains, rings, wacky T-shirts, knit caps, broad-brimmed hats, capes, cloaks, face paint and, of course, his concert flying saucer, the Mothership.
SHOE-IN: Mr.
Clinton's ability to transform the ordinary -- like the pair of boxing shoes -- into a highly personalized statement "speaks to his strength as an artist," said Susan Nininger, the Los Angeles-based costume designer who was the stylist on Mr.
Clinton's "Smell My Finger" album shot and provided the shoes.
"I was basically asked to bring the wildest stuff I could find and he would be able to wear it," she continued.
"I let my imagination go and meld with his outrageousness, and it worked." CLINTON'S STYLE CREDO: "Colors don't clash; people do," from Mr.
Clinton's new single, "Paint the White House Black."

Fear of New Factional Strife Worries U.N. in Mogadishu
United Nations officials are concerned at signs of disputes between the rival Somali factions that share control of the capital and fear that a clash may be increasingly likely.

Devils Struggle, but Still Make It to 7-0
The Devils were able to escape unscathed from their worst period of the season tonight and recover for a 2-1 victory over the Florida Panthers, their seventh triumph of the season without a loss.
The Devils prevailed despite playing an atrocious second period -- though they weren't scored on in that session -- before a crowd of 14,315 at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.


Neighborhood Report: Bay Ridge -- CAMPAIGN FOR THE COUNCIL; Can This Democrat Win Now?
Sal F. Albanese has made a political career of not fitting in.
Despite being a Democrat-Liberal, he won a City Council seat in 1982 in a conservative Republican district, then became the Council's leading maverick, bucking his party hierarchy.
His job security, therefore, is never taken for granted.
That is especially true now, when the head of his ticket, Mayor Dinkins, seems more vulnerable than in 1989, when he garnered barely 1 in 10 votes in this district, the 43d in Brooklyn.

In Westport, Seafood With Water View
IT'S too late in the season to dine outside on the big old-fashioned porch at The Longshore Grille in Westport.
But that shouldn't keep you from enjoying Long Island Sound views from the windows that cover two sides of the large, light and airy dining room.
The restaurant is located in the Inn at Longshore, a privately owned white clapboard lodge that is surrounded by the Westport town-owned grounds, golf course and sports complex in a choice location facing the water.


Turning Beans Into an Innovation
BEANS are no longer just a food to be cooked with a ham hock and served on a cold day.
Innovative chefs are preparing them in all kinds of interesting ways, making them into creamy purees to go with meat or fish, topping them with green vegetables or even serving them on crostini -- grilled country bread -- as a snack, as the Italians do.
Carol Field, in her excellent new book, "Italy in Small Bites" (William Morrow), gives a recipe for dried fava beans, which are pureed and mixed with wild greens.
The nutty flavor of the favas makes a splendid foil for the bitterness of the greens.
If you can't find wild greens, broccoli rape, escarole, frisee or chicory can be substituted.
The puree is also good spread on grilled, lightly oiled bread and topped with steamed or sauteed greens (winter's answer to summer's tomato bruschetta).


Commercial Property: Leasing Where the Landlord Is; More Space Opens Up in Sites Occupied by Owners
EARLY next year, Cushman &amp; Wakefield will move into Black Rock, the CBS headquarters building at 51 West 52d Street.
It is not a perfect fit -- the big real estate company has to spread out across six floors, making communications between brokers harder than they might have been in, say, 1221 Sixth Avenue, the 49th Street building that could have accommodated Cushman on two floors.
Still, Cushman decided that was a small price to pay for being a paying guest in CBS's house.
"There's an extra measure of comfort about a building when the owner is living there, too," said Charles R. Borrok, the Cushman vice chairman who negotiated the deal.


Andrea Perlbinder, Garth Stein
ANDREA JO PERLBINDER and Garth Ferguson Stein met five years ago at Columbia University, where both were studying for master's degrees in film.
He caught her attention by singing in the editing room and by offering to play the role of the boyfriend in a short 16-millimeter comedy she was making called "Papaya Smoothie."
They are now, as she puts it, "a film-making couple" who write, produce and direct movies, often together.
The two, who share everything from career goals to tastes in shoes, are working on a documentary about Philadelphia, Miss., the town where three civil rights workers were killed in the 60's, as well as an adaptation of "Green Grass, Running Water," a comic novel by Tom King about four elderly American Indians who escape from a hospital to solve the world's problems.


A Body Before, a Body After
"I thought I had the most beautiful torso I'd ever seen," Matuschka said on Tuesday before the opening of her exhibition, "I Am One Woman," at the Y.W.C.A. at Lexington Avenue and 53d Street.
So, in the late 1980's, Matuschka, an artist who goes by one name, started taking photographs of herself nude and making casts of her body.
"I remember looking in the mirror and saying, 'I have such a beautiful body, something bad is going to happen here.' "
And something did.
In 1991, she found out she had breast cancer and had a mastectomy.
"In retrospect, it's amazing that I was documenting my body so extensively before, that I have this permanent record," said the artist, 39.
One self-portrait, "Beauty Out of Damage," which appeared on the cover of The New York Times Magazine on Aug. 15, is among those showing the results of her mastectomy.


Neighborhood Report: South Bronx; 'Leave Us Alone,' Say Parents in District 12
Maria Pena has something to say to the politicians, editorial writers and other people who bitterly criticized Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines for reinstating nine principals and an assistant principal in District 12.
"Why don't they find another district to worry about?" said Mrs.
Pena, who is the president of a parents' association at P.S. 61, where her two grandchildren are enrolled.
"Leave us alone."


Consumed By Guilt in 'Substance Of Fire'
"THE Substance of Fire" by Jon Robin Baitz satisfies the standard for literate arousal that Norman Kline, the producing director, has set for the theater part of the Emelin Theater's performing arts series.
But it is precisely the theater part that is wanting in Kent Paul's flat staging, which is reflected in pedestrian work by an ill assorted cast.
Two years ago, Mr.
Baitz at 29, already the bearer of promising playwright accolades inspired by an earlier play, "The Film Society," came up with this striking work about a fascinating character, Isaac Geldhart, a stately publishing tyrant with a consuming case of Holocaust survivor's guilt.
Isaac condescends to his three children, all grown-up professionals, and holds rigidly to archaic standards like an "ossified old academic," as one of his sons puts it.


Going, Going Crazy: Carter Wins It for Jays
With Joe Carter playing the role of the departed Dave Winfield and reprising the act of Bill Mazeroski, the Toronto Blue Jays tonight erased from the baseball lexicon a statement that had been around for 14 years: No team has repeated as World Series champions since the 1977-78 Yankees.
The Blue Jays, on Carter's electrifying three-run home run against Mitch Williams with one out in the ninth inning, edged the Philadelphia Phillies, 8-6, in the sixth game and ended the longest period baseball ever has had without a repeat World Series champion.
The Phillies had snatched a 6-5 lead in the seventh with a stunning five-run rally.


Before the Rematch, Both Rumors and Conciliatory Words Are Heard
After nine matches, 26 goals and one massive celebration, the only sure thing in this sleepy emirate remains the liquid wealth below its barren surface.
South Korea and Saudi Arabia lead in the race for the two Asian spots in next year's World Cup finals, but with two rounds of matches remaining, neither team is in a position to play for anything less than victory.

Avedon: Another Angle
To the Editor:
I can't remember a more mean-spirited review than Maud Lavin's of "An Autobiography," by Richard Avedon (Oct. 3).


Dogs and Cats as Co-Therapists for Elderly and Depressed
SOME members of the audience wore fur at a workshop held here recently to expand the use of animals in working with the sick and disabled, the elderly and the mentally disturbed.
Those in fur were the dogs and cats being used for demonstrations, and except for a few meows, they sat quietly until it was their turn in the program.
The animals' good behavior was not surprising, because each one attending the workshop run by Alpha Affiliates, a New Jersey group that studies the benefits of animal-human relationships, had learned the proper demeanor in social situations.
Most of the dogs or cats had participated in the kind of healing relationships that the 30 occupational and recreational therapists, nursing-home employees and health-care volunteers had gathered at the Ramada Inn here to learn more about.
Heeling at Appropriate Speed
Dodger, a bright-eyed golden retriever that has lifted the spirits of many a sick patient in his four years of work as a therapy dog, lay quietly in a corner until it was time to show his wheelchair technique.
Then, as a volunteer played the part of a patient, he gently rested his front paws on the wheelchair and offered his head for a friendly rub.


Roof Collapses in Harlem Building, Injuring 6 People
The roof of a city building being rehabilitated for temporary housing for the homeless collapsed yesterday morning in Harlem, taking five workers down with it and injuring a passer-by.
A spokesman for the Buildings Department said the contractor, A.H.A.
General Construction of Brooklyn, had violated city policy by not applying for a special permit to work on the weekend.
The company also did not inform the City Housing Authority, which manages the site, that it was working, so the engineer and construction manager who usually monitor safety were not at the site, the department said.


Props, Symbols and Nonstories in TV Campaign Coverage
In local television campaign coverage, it began and ended as the week of the rubber chicken.
The fowl prop, produced by the Conservative Party mayoral candidate, George Marlin, as a stand-in for Rudolph W. Giuliani in a program on WNBC-TV, was the leitmotif as television reporters harped on the Republican and Democrat mayoral candidates' failure to debate face to face.
The reporters' obsession with the nondebate built to a frenzy on Thursday, when they tried to force Mr.
Giuliani and Mayor David N. Dinkins together as they briefly crossed paths outside Columbia University.

Neighborhood Report: Upper West Side -- NEIGHBORHOOD MYSTERY; Little Liberty: A Footnote To History
The sight of a diminutive Statue of Liberty perched atop 43 West 64th Street has piqued the curiosity of millions of visitors to the Lincoln Center area over the years.
Spotlighted at night, the statue is 55 feet tall and, like New York Harbor's 300-foot-tall grand dame, is made of molded sheet metal bolted to a frame, with a circular stairway inside.


Kristin Schmidt, Brian Moriarty
Kristin Karin Schmidt, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward H. Schmidt of Appleton, Wis., was married yesterday to Brian Mathew Moriarty, the son of Lois V. Moriarty, also of Appleton.
The Rev.
Dr.
James H. Harris Jr., a United Methodist minister, officiated at the Warren Hotel in Spring Lake, N.J.
Mrs.
Moriarty, 26, is a chiropractic assistant in New York.
She graduated from Northwestern University, from which her husband received a master's degree in management.


Timman's End Play Is His Achilles' Heel
THE most persistent hindrance in Jan Timman's play in the first half of his International Chess Federation championship match with Anatoly Karpov has been the endgame: when it is favorable for him, he does nothing more than draw; when it is unfavorable, he loses.
For example, the Dutchman lost Game 1 with mistakes in the ending and here, in Game 10, played on Sept. 22 in Amsterdam, he repeats the flaw.


Midway Plans To Fly Again From Chicago
Midway Airlines, which operated from Midway Airport in Chicago for a dozen years until it halted service in 1991, plans to start up again this fall.
Its name and base airport will be the same, and its chief executive, Ken Carlson, was the founder of Midway in 1979, but little else has been retained from the original airline.
Like many fledgling carriers, the new Midway, (800) 446-4392, is taking advantage of ripe market conditions -- including relatively inexpensive planes and a large pool of unemployed airline workers -- to fill a perceived niche.


Giuliani Campaign Theme: Dinkins Isn't Up to the Job
The New York City mayoral candidates have tried to frame their contest in many terms, from who would make the better healer to who would be tougher on crime.
But for Rudolph W. Giuliani, one argument has emerged again and again: that Mayor David N. Dinkins is simply not up to the daunting task of managing a complex city.
"It is patently clear that he can't manage a riot, he can't manage a boycott, he can't manage a budget, and he can't manage a campaign to keep it even vaguely in compliance with the law," Mr.
Giuliani said last week, summing up in campaign hyperbole what even Mr.
Dinkins has acknowledged were missteps in handling problems including violence on the streets and raises for the city's union workers.


Health Reform and the Lawyers
To the Editor:
Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, a nonprofit organization, serves approximately 20,000 poor people a year with their civil legal needs.
The majority of our clients are women with children, many of them in need of protection in domestic violence matters.
Recently we have also been assisting hundreds of people, victims of the flooding in Missouri, with regard to their needs for food, shelter, and unemployment benefits, as well as in efforts to protect them from charlatans that prey on victims in times of disasters.


Neighborhood Report: Harlem; Pastors, Parking And Privilege
The city allows doctors to leave their cars in no-parking zones in front of hospitals.
Police officers are allowed the same privilege near precinct houses.
Teachers can park in front of some schools.
So why, pastors in Harlem wonder, do ministers who park in front of churches get tickets?
In an area dotted with houses of worship, the question is being asked with exasperation.
Despite denials from the Transportation Department, ministers and staff members insist that parking agents are cracking down.


Public &amp; Private; Gender Gaffe
It has been one thing after another for Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican who is running for governor of New Jersey against the incumbent Democrat, Jim Florio.
There was the day she was reduced to offering a photo op of cows and pigs at her hunt-country home to defend her farmland tax breaks.
There was the day she fired her campaign manager, who was also her brother.
The bus for her bus tour had car trouble.


The Spouse Factor
THE First Lady of New York City is about to deliver a brief speech.
Its text is computer-printed in 14-point helvetica bold on a half-dozen file cards clutched in her left hand.
Like all her speeches, this one was written by her press officer.
As she always does, Joyce Dinkins read it through and shortened it.
This is her third speech of the day.
It will not be the last.
Public speaking is far from her favorite endeavor.
But as the daughter of one of the city's first black district leaders, Mrs.
Dinkins, now 62, was weaned on calls to duty, and this particular duty is essential in a married life that often appears to be lived more for her husband than with him.

4 Brooklyn Institutions Woo Visitors From Other Boroughs
Four Brooklyn cultural institutions are pooling a $23,000 tourism grant from city agencies to create a marketing campaign with the theme "A Day in Brooklyn." The object: to attract visitors from other parts of the city who may not know that the four institutions -- the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Prospect Park, the Wildlife Center and the Brooklyn Museum -- are fairly close neighbors.
The campaign, also supported by private donors, will make its first appearance in subway advertisements next month.


HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL REPORT
P.S.A.L.
SUPER SUB: Nasry Aranda starting in the backfield in place of Allen Conyers (separated shoulder) rushed 16 times for 130 yards and 2 touchdowns to propel STEVENSON over EVANDER , 30-14.
Aranda had scoring scampers of 37 and 33 yards.
SENSATIONAL SYLVESTER: Keith Sylvester rushed for 161 yards on offense and added 8 tackles and 2 interceptions as CLINTON (3-3) topped WASHINGTON (1-5), 21-18.


Hamburg Journal; Of Ghoulies and Beasties and Bumps in the Night
IN a remote part of this rural Sussex County hamlet, known at this time of the year for its colorful wash of autumn leaves, a frightening change is afoot.
Unearthly moans and spectral visions charge the air once the sun sets.
A mummy's ghostly form walks unchallenged with the likes of Slime Man and a crimson-eyed vampire.
That's not to say that local residents are immune to the ghastly invasion.
But they know that Richard Hanf is up to his usual Halloween tricks.


On the Rim of Java's Mount Bromo
FOR travelers to Indonesia, a volcano climb is as essential as a gamelan concert or a frolic on Bali's beaches.
In few places is the Pacific's volcanic ring of fire so manifest.
More than a third of the world's active volcanoes mark this country's jagged landscape.
Settlement, agriculture, religion -- all have been shaped by the overhanging peaks.
The major deterrents to a climb have been remoteness and the lack of comfortable lodging.
Indonesia's higher volcanoes have been mainly for backpackers, or those who don't mind roughing it.
But now, on Mount Bromo in east Java, knowledgeable guides and a comfortable new hotel have made some of the country's most spectacular volcanic vistas far more accessible.


Help Offered by Family Advocates
I would like to state that Family Advocates stands for values that seem to have escaped American society over the last several decades.
It has attempted to bring sanity for thousands of men and women facing mutual self-destruction in the so-called legal system that professes to protect the interest of children.


And How About . . . ?
To the Editor:
My nominee for Frank Rich's wish list of "dimly remembered musicals of the 50's and 60's" is "Kean," with Alfred Drake and Lee Venora.
This show by Robert Wright and George Forrest was, as the Columbia LP (KOS 2120) jacket rightly claimed, "a rich and lavish musical" about the great actor and "about life and love in London a century ago." MARK PEARSON  Boston

Miro Offers Case in Point of Creativity's Link to Depression
To the Editor:
The publication of Michael Kimmelman's review of the centenary retrospective exhibition of the work of Joan Miro ("A Grand Phantasmagoria From a Catalan Poet," Weekend, Oct. 15) in the same issue as your editorial on the link between depression and artistic creativity, "Making Art of Madness," struck me as an interesting coincidence.
Though not widely recognized, Miro suffered from depressive disorders, and he often referred to them during interviews and in his writings.

Health Reform and the Lawyers
To the Editor:
Dr.
Ribnik's proposal for government-funded civil legal services for the poor and the elderly, at reduced rates, may not be completely radical.
I am paid by the government of Massachusetts at something close to the rate Dr.
Ribnik proposes for his Legalaid, "35 cents per dollar of the usual fee," for juvenile court work.
Because of Medicaid and Medicare, doctors are paid to treat whatever combination of medical problems a poor or elderly person presents to them.
By contrast, when my clients' cases spill over into probate court, district court or housing court, I often find myself doing uncompensated work on their behalf.
Frequently, my adversaries are also appearing without fee.

Ciao, Giordano: The End of a Family Business


New Activism Over Breast Cancer
WHEN Helen M. Ciaffa first felt a lump in her right breast, she ignored it.
When a lesion on the breast began to bleed, she tried not to be concerned.
When her arm started to enlarge, she bought long-sleeve blouses to cover the swelling.
"I was petrified, but I couldn't deal with it," explained the 72-year-old retired clerical worker from New Rochelle.
"Then my husband looked at me one day and said, 'Helen, why don't you just jump out of the window, because you're already killing yourself this way.' "


THE NATION: N.R.A. Campaign Under Attack; The Small-Arms Industry Comes On to Women
THE National Rifle Association has come a long way, baby.
For its latest ad campaign it has updated the kind of feminist slogans that Virginia Slims has used to sell cigarettes.
Now the gun lobby is telling women "how to choose to refuse to be a victim."
The ads, in magazines like Family Circle and Redbook, cite scary crime statistics and invite women to call an 800 number (answered by women) for information about an N.R.A.
"refuse to be a victim" course.
The group says it is selling awareness, not guns.


Pearl Jam Stays the Course With Its Own Rock Hero
Who would want to be a rock hero?
At this late date, the role seems utterly thankless, a never-ending attempt to navigate between fans' escalating demands on the one side and deluded self-importance on the other.
Anyone with a memory can tally the would-be heroes who ended up as cranks, self-parodies, small-timers or corpses; even self-proclaimed anti-heroes slip up and become mundane.
It's hard to find some middle ground between rock's egalitarian myth -- that anybody can do it -- and the gifts of talent, passion and charisma, or to take songs seriously without inviting cackles from Beavis and Butt-head.
But Eddie Vedder, Pearl Jam's singer and lyricist, has volunteered for the job, and he has kept himself honorable through Pearl Jam's second album, "Vs." (Epic 53136; LP, cassette and CD).
His stalwart baritone -- sustained and resolute, gasping with exhaustion or shouting in a last-ditch rasp -- is the voice of long-suffering defiance.
He offers not the illusion of heroic power but the consolation of empathy.
"I am lost, I'm no guide," he moans in "Leash." "But I'm by your side."


Wall Street; Prudential's New Headache Could Cost $5.3 Billion
IT has not been a good week for Prudential Securities.
While it was agreeing to pay at least $371 million to investors victimized by misleading sales tactics, it was hit with a class action claiming some investors were unfairly treated by one of Prudential's most successful mutual funds.
The suit, filed at Federal court in New York for a Maryland investor, claims that Prudential's changes in the organization and fees of the $5.3 billion Prudential Utility Fund required some longtime investors to pay higher fees than they bargained for.

I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Somalia in the late 1960's.
One day a woman begged me to fix the shattered glass lining of her thermos bottle.
The woman cried that her husband would beat her if he found out it was broken.
She would not accept that I could not fix broken glass.


Struggling to Lighten the Mortgage Debt on Co-ops
THE circumstances of the co-op market have made a landlord -- small-time and probably temporary -- out of Michael Kollmer.
In 1988 he and his new bride, Rachael Smith, bought a two-bedroom apartment in the 38-unit building at 622 West 114th Street, taking sponsor financing.
They were unable to sell it when Mr.
Kollmer moved to New Rochelle in 1990 to be closer to a new job as a music teacher in Mamaroneck.
This year the Kollmers, who now have two sons, bought a house in New Rochelle.
They rent out the West Side apartment, absorbing a $150-a-month loss, the difference between the rent they receive and the carrying costs of the apartment.

Holly R. Fogler, Michael S. Solender
Holly Renee Fogler and Michael Samuel Solender, associates at the Washington law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter, were married last evening in Alexandria, Va.
Rabbi Gerald Serotta performed the ceremony at the Radisson Plaza Hotel.
Ms.
Fogler is keeping her name.
She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Texas, from which she also received a law degree.
She is the daughter of Sharon Roberts of Dallas.
Her mother is a legal secretary at Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue in Dallas.
The bride is the stepdaughter of Larry Roberts of Dallas.


Education and Help for Teen-Age Mothers
AS Tracy Jewel sat twirling her fashionably long brown hair around the edge of her pencil, she looked like any other high school student struggling to solve a difficult math problem.
But this 18-year-old senior from Mamaroneck, who still had a mouthful of braces, wasn't quite like the rest of her peers in this math class.
Her classmates eagerly looked forward to the late morning break, when they could grab a soda and a cigarette outside.
Tracy was just as eagerly anticipating her time out from the school day, so she could cuddle her 4-month old son, Jesse, who was in the day-care center of the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services here.


T. S. Eliot's First Marriage Turns a Film Into a Tempest
In a country that takes its literature seriously, a forthcoming film is causing a small stir with its portrait of the unhappy first marriage of T. S. Eliot, Britain's favorite expatriate American poet.
With a pin-striped Willem Dafoe as the poet and Miranda Richardson as his willful, eccentric first wife, Vivien Haigh-Wood, "Tom and Viv" portrays a marriage defined by mutual incomprehension, sadness and not a little rancor.
The film, directed by Brian Gilbert, traces a relationship that began at Oxford during World War I, when Tom met the lively, emotionally unpredictable Viv, the elder of two children of a well-to-do (and well-connected) Edwardian couple.
The liaison and its decline -- signaled in 1932 by their separation and culminating with her institutionalization six years later -- form the drama of "Tom and Viv," which is scheduled for release next year.
Michael Hastings, co-author of the script with Adrian Hodges, adapted the screenplay from his 1984 play, seen Off Broadway at the Public Theater in 1985.


A Shakespearean Timon Unafraid of Emotion
While rehearsing the title role in "Timon of Athens," which opens the National Actors Theater's third season on Broadway on Nov. 4, Brian Bedford is staying at the director Gregory Mosher's spacious West Village apartment.
"That's why there's this enormous plow in the middle of the room," he says, indicating a farm implement presumably commemorating Mr.
Mosher's direction at Lincoln Center of "Speed-the-Plow," the play that gave New Yorkers the opportunity to see Madonna tackle David Mamet's dialogue.
"Madonna's number is on the phone memory -- shall we ring her up?"
You don't expect one of North America's eminent classical actors to be immersed in pop culture, but a lively discussion of recent action-adventure movies (he thought "Striking Distance" was "quite good, of its kind"), reveals that Mr.
Bedford does not spend all his time reading Shakespeare and Moliere.


Santiago
Flying over the Chilean Andes to land in the fertile valley of Santiago, a visitor has a first impression of quiet farm lands surrounded by mountains.
This is the calm setting for the surprisingly modern metropolitan area of five million.
In contrast to the chaos found in many big Latin cities, Santiago has a distinct sense of order, along with the flavors of colonial antiquity.
Founded by Pedro de Valdivia in 1541, it has benefited from Chile's economic boom over the last four years.
The city is easy to get around, has the most up-to-date technology and infrastructure available in Latin America and is relatively safe for travelers.
On a clear day, the mountains around the city can be a shimmering sight of brown topped with white, as they rise above the modern buildings from a thin brown haze at the edge of the city.
But a view of the mountains, particularly in winter, is never guaranteed, since in June, when winter begins in the Southern Hemisphere, the city is often troubled by smog.


Midori Recital at SUNY Purchase
SOME world-renowned visitors will perform in Westchester next weekend.
On Friday at 8 P.M., the young violinist Midori plays at the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York at Purchase with the pianist Robert MacDonald as accompanist.
Their program includes Beethoven and Bartok sonatas, Alfred Schnittke's charmingly tongue-in-cheek "Suite in the Old Style" and Saint-Saens' "Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso." The box office number at the SUNY campus is 251-6200.
Two recitals are scheduled next Saturday at 8:30 P.M.
In one, the pianist Richard Goode will play four Beethoven sonatas -- Nos. 1, 4, 17 ("Tempest"), and 28. -- for Friends of Music at the Ossining High School.
The numbers are 271-3265 or 271-4800.
In another, also scheduled for 8:30 P.M., Vagan Papian, who emigrated to Israel from the Soviet Union in 1990, offers a varied keyboard program.
He will play works by Mozart, Prokofiev, Grieg and Liszt for his debut in the Music Room at Caramoor in Katonah.
The number for information is 232-1252.


Jet Lag, Rockets Await the Knicks
Asked if he spoke Spanish, John Starks had an answer.
"Adios, amigos" the Knicks' guard said with a smile.
"I guess that's what I'll say when we leave."


Bringing Hollywood Home
Before the emergence of the Seventh Avenue designer, an American fashion force rivaled, and even eclipsed, anything that sauntered down a Paris runway: the Hollywood costumer.
For Hollywood, promoting costumers was part of the marketing machine.
The studios publicized them along with the stars they dressed, feeding sketches to fan magazines and encouraging stores to adapt the clothes of film epics.
As early as 1917, Photoplay magazine enthused that D. W. Griffith's "Intolerance" would lead women "Back to Babylon" for their fashion looks, which the magazine helpfully illustrated so moviegoers could copy them.


Timely Tips From A.A.A.
The recent spate of attacks on tourists in Florida has prompted the American Automobile Association to publish a brochure advising travelers how to avoid trouble.
The six-page brochure, "Playing It Safe," is free to members and nonmembers of the A.A.A. and offers tips that range from what cautious tourists might routinely do to suggestions that might not occur to most people.


Corrections
A picture caption on Sept. 19 with an article about Yaddo, the artists' colony, referred incorrectly to Joseph Caldwell.
He is a novelist and playwright, not a poet.
Another caption with the article, about residents at Yaddo in 1942, misspelled the surnames of two artists.
They are Nicholas and Merle Marsicano.
A letter dated Oct. 6 from a Yaddo alumnus, about Mr.
Caldwell, and a telephone call on Oct. 14 from the Marsicano family alerted The Times to the errors; this correction was delayed for checking with Yaddo.


Turning Loose One of Texas's Best-Kept Secrets
A large town located about 90 miles east of Dallas, Tyler is, to say the least, an unusual place to see a country music concert.
With its spacious front yards, green shade trees and porticoed doorways on respectably sized homes, Tyler seems like the essence of modern Southern gentility.
On a recent Sunday afternoon, the manicured lawns are strangely empty; the streets are eerily quiet, and the broad intersections are bereft of traffic.
The weather is hot and bright like Indian summer, but most of Tyler seems to be locked away behind closed doors.
In the amphitheater of the public park, though, a small crowd of hippie-generation couples, plus assorted aunts and uncles and cousins, has gathered for what is surely an unusual event by Tyler standards: a free outdoor concert by the Texas singer and songwriter Jimmie Dale Gilmore.
But then Mr.
Gilmore is not your typical country performer.
For years he has been one of Texas's best-kept secrets.
An Austin resident in his late 40's, he has only recently begun to emerge into the national spotlight.
His show in Tyler is the first stop on a two-month national tour in support of his new album, "Spinning Around the Sun" on Elektra. (The tour arrives in New York this week for three shows Tuesday through Thursday at the Ballroom.)


Recreating 'The Age of Innocence' in Brick and Paint
EDITH WHARTON SET "THE AGE OF Innocence" in the New York of her childhood, the city of the 1870's.
In Martin Scorsese's new film adaptation, the scenes of New York and its environs are a glorious amalgam of intact Victoriana and the film makers' fantasies.


Lianna Singleton And Paul Scura
Lianna Singleton, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur E. Singleton of Barrington, R.I., was married yesterday to Paul V. Scura, a son of the late Mr. and Mrs.
Edward J. Scura.
The Rev.
Jonathan J. D. Ostman, an Anglican Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony at St.
John the Evangelist Church in Newport, R.I.


Opening the Archives
EXACTLY 50 YEARS AGO TODAY, READERS OF THE New York Times Magazine got quite a jolt.
There, in this sober-sided publication, were 13 pages devoted to women's clothes.
The feature, "Fashions of The Times," was a patriotic gesture to illustrate the vitality of Seventh Avenue, cut off by war from Paris.
But after that, it was clear that New York was also a fashion source worth covering.
Cruising through a half century of The Times's fashion coverage is a trip.
In this yellowed and frayed-edged cache, pages turn, and silhouettes, attitudes toward dressing -- even the importance of the subject matter itself -- shift and twist with the times.
Some clothes -- and accessories like evening hats and Courreges's white boots -- are firmly grounded in an era.
But others -- Claire McCardell's 1940's sportswear and Norman Norell's glamorous gowns, for example -- transcend time. 40's -- On its own, American fashion emerged triumphant.
Claire McCardell invented sportswear that could be worn today.
Norman Norell was starting to create timeless, luxurious ready-to-wear.
But by the end of the era, Paris -- led by Dior's New Look -- had reasserted its leadership.


Coping With Squirrels Is No Laughing Matter
To the Editor:
Robert Lipsyte, in his Sept. 26 essay, and Maria Terrone, in her Oct. 10 letter, make light of their battle against squirrels, but it should be noted that improper animal handling can result in the transmission of diseases to human beings, including sarcoptic mange and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
In their quest for political correctness, these writers are endangering themselves and the public, and breaking several New York State laws.


Volkswagen Introduces A New Golf And Jetta
THE first new import to live in our driveway was a Volkswagen Rabbit, a tomato-red '77 model that we loved dearly.
Actually, the car belonged to my wife, and it was the first new car that she had bought on her own.
The interior was black, and it packed an incredible amount of room into a small, square package.
We took the car camping, and we used it for all the usual family trucking.
It was thrifty and it was terrific.


Robin Friedman, Andrew Morrison
Robin Jo Friedman, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Joel Friedman of Boca Raton, Fla., was married last evening to Andrew L. Morrison, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward Morrison of New York.
Rabbi Meyer Leifer performed the ceremony at the Hudson River Club in New York.
The bride, 30, is an account manager for TSS Ltd., a marketing and promotions company in Westport, Conn.
She graduated from the University of Rhode Island.
Her father, now retired, was a sales representative for children's apparel companies in New York.
Her mother, Jacqueline Friedman, also retired, was the president of Kid Stop Inc., which owned retail stores in Westport and in Danbury, Conn.


Women Gain Major Roles In Restaurant Kitchens
WHEN Donna Baird worked at the Lake Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz more than 12 years ago, women were allowed in the kitchen only as dishwashers or pantry workers.
Ms.
Baird, who is now chef at the Station Bistro in Water Mill, was refused when she asked for a job as a line chef or baker.
At Christmas a Lake Mohonk executive saw a gingerbread house that Ms.
Baird had baked, decorated and placed, along with other seasonal specialties, on a display table in the dining room.
When the hotel baker learned of the house, he seized it, stalked to Ms.
Baird and slammed it down in front of her.


Neighborhood Report: Lower Manhattan; Historically Incorrect Dept.: TriBeCa Trees
Only God can make a tree.
And only in New York City could it require a waiver to plant one.
The city's Transportation Department was planning to add trees while reconstructing Hudson Street.
But the Landmarks Preservation Commission contended that would violate the no-tree policy of the TriBeCa Historic Preservation District.
Since trees once covered Manhattan, how could they be historically incorrect?
Because they had been largely eradicated in TriBeCa by the time it developed as a commercial district in the 1800's, the era designated for preservation.


A la Carte; A New Look in the New Year for a Great Neck Standby
THE 10-year-old Navona in Great Neck is changing, growing and redecorating.
The restaurant at 218 Middle Neck Road, which was voted the top Italian eating place on the Island in the 1993 Zagat suburban survey, will close for four to six weeks starting on Jan. 31 and reopen in March.
Navona is doubling its size, adding to its menu and starting a from-the-ground-up redecoration.
It is also importing an ice-cream machine from Bologna that will be used to make gelato and sorbet and a charcoal grill-roaster that is capable of cooking specialty fish and chicken dishes.


Sylvia Chanler, John Stumpfig
Sylvia Winthrop Chanler, the merchandising manager at Polygram Records in New York, was married yesterday to John Hartwell Stumpfig, a sales representative in New York for The Sciences, the magazine of the New York Academy of Sciences.
The Rev.
David Boulton performed the Episcopal ceremony at St.
Mary's of the Isles Church in Dark Harbor, Me.


Irene McNulty, Stephen Sabadics
Irene McNulty and Stephen A. Sabadics, graduates of Columbia University who received masters degrees in engineering from Rutgers University, were married yesterday.
The Rev.
Gerard Sudol performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at Holy Family Church in Nutley, N.J.
Mrs.
Sabadics, 32, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard B. McNulty of Elkridge, Md., is a staff manager in the business operations analysis division of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in Morristown, N.J.


Ann-Marie Henry, Blake T. Myers
Ann-Marie Henry, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
John Armstrong Henry 3d of Oklahoma City, was married there yesterday to Blake Tomas Myers, a son of Mrs.
Barbara L. Myers of Muncie, Ind.
The Rev.
Dr.
Michael Anderson performed the ceremony at Westminister Presbyterian Church.


Tunnel Speeds Marseilles Trip
A new tunnel enables drivers to cross the center of Marseilles in less than three minutes, compared with at least 15 minutes in the past.
The 1.6-mile tunnel, which opened last month, links the Prado train station, east of the city's center, to the Bassin du Carenage , on the tip of the Vieux Port.
The tunnel, called the Prado-Carenage, will not only ease inner-city traffic, but also act as a relay between the eastbound A50 highway to Toulon and the northwest-bound A55 to Mari gnane and Lyons.
Indeed, much of the traffic caught up in the mesh of small streets and traffic lights in the busiest section of central Marseilles -- 250,000 vehicles daily -- is from drivers who are only passing through France's largest Mediteranean port.


Mayoral Foes Roam the Dial for Votes
On WRKS, otherwise known as KISS-FM, Mayor David N. Dinkins wrestled recently with the name of the rap artist M. C. Lyte, calling her "McLyte." On the WKCR program "Opera Fanatic," Rudolph W. Giuliani reminisced the other day about the first Metropolitan Opera broadcast he ever heard: "La Giocanda." And in repeated appearances on WFAN, both candidates have tried to win the endorsement of Don Imus by adopting his ironic tone.
It has become a commonplace of modern politics that television is the medium that determines elections.
But as the New York City mayoral campaign enters its final days, both Mayor Dinkins and Mr.
Giuliani are challenging -- or perhaps simply ignoring -- this conventional wisdom.


Cabdriver Is Killed in Queens, Apparently During a Robbery
A 27-year-old cabdriver was found shot to death in his car yesterday morning on a street in Queens, apparently the victim of a robbery, the police said.
The killing, the third of a cabdriver in a week and the 32d this year, prompted protests by more than 100 other drivers, who demanded that more undercover officers be assigned to help curb the shootings.


Suzanne Sullivan, Grant A. Keith
Suzanne Margaret Sullivan, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Peter V. Sullivan of Severna Park, Md., was married yesterday to Grant Andrew Keith, a son of John and Barbara Keith of Thornbury, Ontario.
The Rev.
Paul Tizio performed the ceremony at St.
Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Annapolis, Md.
The bride, 27, is an assistant product manager at Sterling Health USA, a pharmaceutical company in New York.
She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and received an M.B.A. from New York University.


INFLUENTIAL GROUP SAYS HEALTH PLAN SLIGHTS THE AGED
The American Association of Retired Persons has expressed concern that President Clinton's health plan would let states lock elderly people into a two-tier system, providing them less generous benefits than would be available to people under 65 years old.
The association wields considerable political power and has 33 million members, most of them keenly interested in health care.
It ardently supports efforts to control health costs and expand coverage, and it has praised Mr.
Clinton's proposal as a "bold and constructive plan."


For Families of Troubled P.S. 156, Protest Disrupts More Than Just Class
For an hour or two this week there was an interlude of hope, when the parents occupying an elementary school in Brooklyn to protest their treatment in the asbestos crisis suddenly felt that their travails might be over.
Then, just as quickly, a realization dawned that the political and bureaucratic knot that led to the takeover was still as tangled as ever, and many parents wept.
One parent, Altagracia Lora, wept because the takeover had interrupted a school meals program, she was out of money, and she had no food at home for her children.
The president of the P.T.A., Miriam Rodriguez, wept because the accumulated demands of working-class motherhood and overnight political leadership suddenly became too much.
And Petra Ortiz wept, as did many other parents, she said, in a rush of deepening cynicism.


Christopher, Resign
As a loyal Democrat and supporter of President Clinton, I believe, with regret, that Secretary of State Warren Christopher should resign.
He has severely damaged the national interest through failed leadership in difficult situations that have required a firm hand.
These crises, in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Russia and Haiti, are likely to worsen because of the Administration's flawed policies.
Our Bosnia policy has been an utter failure.
Mr.
Christopher has vacillated and obfuscated the issue of Serbian aggression.
In early February, he defined our strong strategic interests in the region and stated that our response to the war would serve as a test case of how we handled ethnic and minority concerns throughout the world.
By June, he was saying we had no vital interests at stake and that our primary goal was to stop the killing.


We Are the Wired: Some Views On the Fiberoptic Ties That Bind
SOMEDAY, the visionaries tell us, we will be able to communicate with just about anybody by sending an electronic message; no matter where they are, the bundle of bits will find them.
On the information superhighway, the literature of the world and the videos, too, will be just a point and a click away.
So will anyone we want to hear from.
Someday, perhaps, but not yet.
When we asked four writers to give us their visions of the information future, the science writer James Gleick communicated with us entirely through the Internet, the loose confederation of computer networks that serves for the time being as a kind of two-lane blacktop for exchanging information.
But then Mr.
Gleick, who is building an access ramp to let common folk use the Net, is an old hand at this. (Getting his words from the Internet and into our own computer proved a little trickier.)


Neighborhood Report: Long Island City/Woodside -- CAMPAIGN FOR THE COUNCIL; Republican 'Reformer' Makes for a Feisty Race
Walter L. McCaffrey says he has long fought for the neighborhoods in his council district, from having trees planted on the streets of Woodside to battling the city's plan to build a huge sludge plant in Maspeth.
It is the sort of record that has kept him in office since 1985, but these days he is fighting for re-election against a Republican challenger who says that Mr.
McCaffrey, 44, is simply out of touch with the people of the district.

. . . and Euridice


Outsmarting The Moles
To the Editor:
I greatly enjoyed Anne Raver's "You Can Never Be Too Thin, or Bulb-Rich" (Oct. 3).
Since my garden has been chosen as the headquarters of the International Mole and Vole Teamsters Union, I had to chose between giving up on all bulbs -- except for those boring daffodils, which even the enemy hates -- or to find a way to permanently rodent-proof my bulbs.


Bodega Life: Big Markups and Small Profits
MERENGUE plays continuously over the speakers at the Gelines Grocery in the western Bronx.
Every so often Santos Montilla, the proprietor, gets caught up in the music and, while talking to a customer, drums out the beat with his hands on cartons of canned food and soft drinks stacked in the narrow aisles.
It is a nervous gesture.
Mr.
Montilla, only 20, was thrown prematurely into running the family bodega by the death of his father, Damaso, who was shot on Aug. 5.
The shooting was one of numerous acts of violence that mar the lives of thousands of immigrants who, by opening small food stores, try to get a foothold in the New York economy.


Savoring Memories of Asmara In Downtown New Haven
ONE night recently at Caffe Adulis in New Haven, the chef, Ficre Gebreysus, prepared his special of the evening by spooning butter into a saute pan, then tossing in a small bagful of plump shrimp.
A ghostly pillar of flames exploded from the pan, then vanished.
"It's like magic, you know?" he said without losing his rhythm.
He sprinkled in a few spoonfuls of unsweetened coconut, then stirred in some chopped dates and an herb sauce.
"A little bit of dates, some coconut, some nice herbs and voila," he exclaimed, arranging the dish on a round platter.
"You have a symphony."


Bones of Contention in 'Conversations'
FUNNY how, in its New Jersey premiere, "Conversations With My Father" has found a rightful home after a year's run on Broadway.
There, Herb Gardner's contribution to the American theater's gallery of plays about ambivalent sons who struggle to make peace with contentious fathers was dwarfed by a star-driven production steered by Judd Hirsch's Tony Award-winning performance.


Miss Van Alen, Mr. Manigault
Elizabeth Langley Van Alen, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
James L. Van Alen of Millbrook, N.Y., was married yesterday in New York to Pierre Manigault, the son of Peter Manigault of Charleston, S.C., and Landine Manigault of Stonington, Conn.
The Rev.
Charles Amstein performed the ceremony at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church.
Mrs.
Manigault, 24, was until recently an assistant at the Fowler Center for Wildlife Education in New York.
She graduated from Barnard College.
Her father is a partner in Kopstein, Van Alen and Nash, a stock brokerage in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
The bride's paternal grandfather, the late James H. Van Alen, founded the Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I., and invented the tie-breaker scoring system for the game.


Insuring Coastal Homes
To the Editor:
The Sept. 5 article entitled "The Storm Over Insuring Coastal Homes" barely scratches the surface of an issue that some of us have been upset about for some years now.
More importantly, more and more of the general public is becoming incensed over the matter of our tax and insurance dollars financing absolutely silly gambles -- the buildings put up on some of the Earth's most unstable terrain.


Family Over Football: Williamses in Their Own Words
A week after Houston Oilers offensive tackle David Williams missed a game because he wanted to be at the birth of his first child, he and his wife, Debi, spoke with Samantha Stevenson for The New York Times.
The conversation centered on his choice of family over football, a decision that has brought him overwhelming attention and considerable support from around the country.
Some Things Just Can't Be Hurried
Debi Williams, 28, went into labor Friday night.
She and David, 27, went to a hospital in The Woodlands, the Houston suburb where they live, about 6:30 Saturday morning.
A boy weighing 9 pounds 15 ounces, named Scot Cooper Williams, was born at 6:25 P.M.
The last flight out of Houston Intercontinental Airport to Boston that night was at 6:50 P.M.


Off-Duty Officer Wounds Man in Brooklyn
An off-duty transit police officer shot and wounded a man who allegedly pointed a pistol at him on a Brooklyn street, the police said.
The officer, Rafael Morales, 26, was in his apartment in the Williamsburg section about 9:30 P.M.
Friday when he heard gunfire, said Lieut.
Robert Valentino, a Transit Authority police spokesman.


Match Backers Pleased at Response
The seven-week-long chess match between Gary Kasparov, the world champion, and Nigel Short, his British challenger, was hardly a cliffhanger.
Mr.
Kasparov is simply too brilliant a player.
He dispatched the bubbly, bushy-haired 28-year-old challenger without even a hiccup of suspense.
By drawing Thursday's game in the match, sponsored by The Times of London and officially named the the Times World Chess Championship, the 30-year-old champion won the best of 24 games with a score of 12 1/2 to 7 1/2.
He collects $1.43 million of the $2.55 million purse, and Mr.
Short picks up the rest, along with his tattered reputation.


Norah K. Hass, Timothy J. Kelley
Norah Katherine Hass, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Michael S. Hass of Brookline, Mass., was married yesterday to Timothy James Kelley, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward J. Kelley of West Harwich, Mass.

Artists Who Captured An Idealized America
WORN AND WEATHERED, its iron hinges one remove from rust, the unabashedly patriotic "Flag Gate" is among the great icons of American folk art.
Hand-carved in the late 19th century to guard a farmer's pasture in upstate New York, the red-white-and-blue gate stands at the entrance to "America's Heritage," the inaugural exhibition of the Daniel Cowin Permanent Collection Gallery at the Museum of American Folk Art.
The show's 64 ancestor portraits, trade signs, weather vanes, quilts, gypsum figures and decorated tin vessels, all produced over the last 200 years, reflect folk art's most important themes.


Rodeos Are Cruel
To the Editor:  Gay rodeo.
What a bummer.
Gay people themselves have endured so much hurt that it's hard to believe some of them are now into hurting other innocent beings ("Bustin' Stereotypes," Sept. 26).

And Now They'll All Know Who Carter Is
Life might be different for Joe Carter.
The days when he could return to Kansas City during the off season and play baseball with the neighborhood kids almost anonymously may have disappeared tonight when his bat sent the Toronto Blue Jays into World Series history.
Joe Carter as a no-name neighbor?
How about Joe Carter in an American Express commercial?
The latter is a more likely scenario after Carter lined a 2-2 slider from Mitch Williams over the left-field fence tonight for a three-run homer that catapulted the Jays to a dramatic 8-6 victory over the Phillies and their second straight World Series Championship.

OCT. 17-23: Hostile Bid; In Hotter Pursuit Of Paramount
It is called a tender offer, but there was nothing gentle about the latest twist in the hunt for Paramount Communications.


THE NATION: Season of Fear; Polititians Feel a Crime-Induced Chill in the Air
IT could be your next-door neighbor describing her fear for the safety of her teen-agers when they leave the house on weekend nights -- but it isn't.
It's Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey, looking squarely into the camera as she tries to convince voters that she is not soft on crime, as Gov.
Jim Florio would have them believe.
"As Governor," she says in a new campaign ad, "nobody will be tougher than me on drunk drivers and criminals, especially those who prey on women and children."


Venus Envy
Given the opportunity to switch places with women, most men would politely decline, for two reasons.
The first is childbirth.
The second is women's fashion.
It's too hard.
Women reinvent themselves every day.
And they face an intimidatingly large field of choices.
Consider the skirt (if, in fact, it's going to be a skirt and not slacks, or leggings with some sort of loose outer garment, or those culotte things that look like a skirt).
It can hit at the shoe, the ankle, midcalf, just below the knee, just above the knee or onward and upward to midthigh.


POSTINGS: The Four Seasons; A Landmark Upheld
The New York State Court of Appeals ruled last week that the Landmarks Preservation Commission had acted properly in designating the fashionable Four Seasons restaurant a landmark.
The 5-to-0 ruling, written by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, upheld decisions by the State Supreme Court and the Appellate Division.
Those decisions rejected arguments by the restaurant's landlord, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, that the designation would cause it economic loss because it would not be able to use the space for any other purpose.
The court also ruled that the commission was within its authority in giving landmark status to the striking interior architecture and furnishings, including the wide staircases, bronze railings, hanging sculptures, walnut bar, marble pool and ceiling panels.

Turning Beans Into an Innovation
BEANS are no longer just a food to be cooked with a ham hock and served on a cold day.
Innovative chefs are preparing them in all kinds of interesting ways, making them into creamy purees to go with meat or fish, topping them with green vegetables or even serving them on crostini -- grilled country bread -- as a snack, as the Italians do.
Carol Field, in her excellent new book, "Italy in Small Bites" (William Morrow), gives a recipe for dried fava beans, which are pureed and mixed with wild greens.
The nutty flavor of the favas makes a splendid foil for the bitterness of the greens.
If you can't find wild greens, broccoli rape, escarole, frisee or chicory can be substituted.
The puree is also good spread on grilled, lightly oiled bread and topped with steamed or sauteed greens (winter's answer to summer's tomato bruschetta).

From Tulipmania to a Glory of Spring
THERE is still time to plant hardy spring-flowering bulbs.
But the opportunity is fast dwindling since the bulbs must grow roots before the ground freezes.
It is these roots that absorb the soil's moisture, which in turn pushes up the leaves and the stems that support the flowers.
Tulips will probably take top priority this year, in celebration of their 400th anniversary.
To mark the event, the Netherlands begins a yearlong tulip quadricentennial.
The country, the center of an industry that propagates more than 3,500 tulip hybrids and species that are planted in gardens all over the world, has long been noted for its beautiful tulips and its vast bulb-growing fields are indeed a sight to be seen.


CRIME
When an American art historian is stabbed to death in Venice, Flavia di Stefano, a smart and terribly chic investigator with the Italian National Art Theft Squad in Rome, reacts to the murder with serene indifference.
"Foreigners die in Venice all the time," she says.
"People write books on it." But like the reader of Iain Pears's sophisticated mystery THE TITIAN COMMITTEE (Harcourt Brace, $19.95), Flavia soon becomes intrigued by the political esthetics of the case.
It seems that the murdered woman, who served on a learned committee that authenticates works by Titian, was about to publish a paper that would pin back the ears of the international art world.
Flavia carefully reconstructs the dead expert's scholarship, in which she discerns tantalizing clues about an obscure Renaissance art scandal and dark hints of corruption within the Titian committee, whose surviving members are now being killed at an alarming rate.

Austria's Share of the Danube
I HAVE long associated the Danube with Hungary and especially Budapest, the city so closely defined by the magnificent river that flows through it.
That is because the Danube seems scarcely to make an impression on Vienna as it skirts the capital.
But 60 miles west of Vienna, the river broadens, slicing and curving through hilly Austrian countryside so rich with Baroque abbeys and medieval fortresses, vineyards and villages, bike trails and pleasant back roads, that visitors who thought the river was principally Hungary's are unlikely to make that mistake again.


Velvet Sees the Sun
Black velvet has come out of the evening closet and is now being worn in the daytime.
Sure, velveteen blazers and pants suits (worn by twins on Fifth Avenue, top, center-right) have been a daytime option.
But the soft, rich, luminous pile of a black velvet long dress (center and lower right) worn on its own during the day captures the spirit of today's Edwardian revival -- doing away with a fashion taboo that has relegated the wearing of velvet to the evening hours.

BASKETBALL  Suns Continue Streak The Phoenix Suns, behind Charles Barkley's 28 points, beat Buckler of Bologna 112-90 yesterday to win the McDonald's Open, keeping the National Basketball Association's unbeaten strike alive during the tournament's six years.

Psychobabble?
FIRST there was Bill Moyers on Joseph Campbell.
Then came Clarisa Pinkola Estes's "Women Who Run With the Wolves." Now, for those who find solace in "myth lite," there is Lloyd Glauberman, a psychologist, hypnotist and recording artist who spins whimsical fairy tales with feel-better-about-yourself messages on convenient cassette tapes.
Recorded on the Psycho-Technology label, which he founded five years ago in New York City, each half-hour tape offers two simultaneous tales that are embedded with 40 hypnotic suggestions.
The two-tape "Floating Holograms" series is aimed at improving self-esteem.
"Procrastination, a Rhythmic Approach" is another program, and "Inside, Outside" is a two-tape series for losing weight.
There are four other programs.


Neighborhood Report: Harlem; The Playground That Plastic Built
A new school playground on 134th Street has 20,000 plastic containers and 34,000 aluminum cans, according to its donor.
But it is a proud count: recycling has turned the castoffs into the makings of a jungle gym and slide.
Even the mats to cushion children's falls are fashioned from old tires.
The playground, at P.S. 175, was donated by Lever Brothers, which makes cleaning products like All, Wisk and Snuggle.
The company is using the playground, and similar ones in six other cities, as an example of what recycled materials can do.

Taking Violence For Granted
To the Editor:
After reading Caryn James's essay "As a B Movie, 'True Romance' Is Grade A"  [ Sept. 19 ] , I feel compelled to ask: Do the critics who are rushing to praise this film have no perspective?

THE NATION: The New, Harsher Westerns; Myths Die With Their Boots On
MEN were men in the American West conjured up in the movies of a generation ago.
Cavalrymen, for that matter, were cavalrymen.
But these days, with Hollywood rekindling its old infatuation with the Western, things are not nearly that simple.
For one thing, in the recently released "Ballad of Little Jo," a feminist interpretation of the Old West, women are men.
To survive in a depraved, misogynistic mining town after her family banishes her for having an illegitimate child, Josephine Monaghan assumes a man's identity, even slashing a scar into her face to complete the ruse.


BOSNIAN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS FAILS
A plan that would have resulted in the exchange of 6,400 detainees and prisoners of war by all three sides in the Bosnian war has in effect collapsed as new conditions set by the warring parties caused the plan to be set aside pending new negotiations.
Andre Collomb, a senior official of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said after four hours of talks at Sarajevo airport on Friday that there had been no breakthrough in an impasse that has blocked the exchange of about 900 Serbian and Muslim prisoners.
Earlier in the day, a similar exchange involving more than 5,000 Muslim and Croatian prisoners was also postponed indefinitely.


Cherkasky and Pirro Trade Fire On Contributions
TWO candidates, Jeanine Ferris Pirro and Michael G. Cherkasky, vying fiercely for the office of district attorney -- which is being vacated after 25 years by Carl A. Vergari -- have found no shortage of issues, including the assertion that both have a lot to explain when it comes to campaign contributions.
Mr.
Cherkasky, a leading prosecutor under Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, said that Mrs.
Pirro, when running for County Court judge in 1990, "solicited and accepted contributions from individuals and organizations intimately connected with organized crime."


Tax-Cut Backlash Swelling in California and Oregon
The tax revolt has come full circle on the West Coast, where two states are trying to make up for revenue they lost in earlier tax rollbacks, while another may pass sweeping restrictions on how government can raise money.

Integrate the Care of Women's Health
To the Editor:
It's true that a woman's body is fragmented among the various medical specialties ("Is Women's Health Harmed by Medical Specialization?", front page, Oct. 13).
But more fragmented is the experience and knowledge related to medically managing a woman's body.
As formidable is developing lines of communication that would allow for exchange of information.

A SENSE OF PLACE
WILLIAM S. HAINES JR. leaned against a green pickup truck and gazed out across an expanse of cranberry bogs that stretched nearly a mile in every direction.
The bogs -- a checkerboard of large rectangular fields enclosed by raised dams and flooded with water from nearby reservoirs -- were bordered in the distance by stands of pitch pine, oak and American white cedar.
"This is absolutely the best part of New Jersey," Mr.
Haines said, describing Hog Wallow, a section of Washington Township in Burlington County that is considered by some to be the epicenter of the Pinelands.

Requiem for the Supercollider
The death of the Superconducting Supercollider at the hands of Congress last week is a cause for sadness.
Not because the huge project was the most important research on today's scientific frontiers -- it clearly wasn't.
And not because it would have had an enormous impact on America's technological or economic growth -- those claims were always far-fetched.
But the supercollider was undeniably a worthy scientific project and was indispensable to the continued advance of the esoteric field of high-energy physics.
It was science at its most pure and most costly, so fundamental and impractical that only the Federal Government could afford to support it.
And now even the Government has concluded that the price is too high.


Los Angeles Portrait; A Judge Who Challenges the System
Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. brooks no behavioral dissent when it comes to his courtroom.
Let a spectator's eye wander down to a newspaper and Judge Hatter catches him like a frog snaring flies; let a lawyer try theatrics before a jury and the judge's acerbic tongue lashes him back to the lectern.
"So many of them look at 'L.A. Law' and think that's the way you practice law," Judge Hatter said in an interview.
"They find out quickly in my courtroom I won't have any strolling minstrels."


The Deepest Finesse Has a Huge Impact
THE deal shown in the diagram has two claims to fame: It is probably the only time in the history of bridge that a player has successfully finessed a three on the first trick, and it belongs on any short list of the most entertaining deals of all time.
It was reported some three decades ago by M. Harrison Gray, the great English player-writer.
He was surely one of the best players who never won a world title, although he had plenty of victories.
Seven of them were in the British Gold Cup, the equivalent of the Vanderbilt Cup in America, and he won four European Championships, once with an incredible 98 percent score.

Paul Taylor Hates Ballet. 30 (Want to Bet?)
Paul Taylor has on his desk a goldframed portrait of Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the New York City Ballet and an outspoken critic of modern dance.
"I've always admired him," the 63-year-old Mr.
Taylor said recently with a grin.
"I think Lincoln likes me and my work. Which is a funny relationship, because he has stood for ballet. And I can't stand ballet."
There was a time when ballet was ballet and modern dance was something else.
Modern dancers studied ballet at their peril in the 1930's and 40's, when modern dance was establishing itself as a distinctly different American art form.
Who wanted to be a swan or a sylph when they could express love, hate or the persistence of memory by digging their bare feet into the ground like a rooted tree or curving their torso into a deep and voluptuous arc?
Yet who would be content to flex a dusty foot when they could spin and fly and stretch into beautiful shapes and regal distillations of emotion?


A Warhol Footnote
IN A CORNER OF THE MORGUE, AS this newspaper affectionately calls its dusty, labyrinthine archives, stand 5 tall filing cabinets packed with fashion photographs and illustrations.
A photo researcher for The Times Magazine was digging through them, looking for illustrations for this issue, when she unearthed a few of Pop Art's roots.
Among the crumbling sheets crammed into a bulging file devoted to accessories, the researcher, Jody-Lynn Quon, came upon a drawing of a shoe.
She had been tracking down copies of 50's I. Miller advertisements with Andy Warhol illustrations for Hal Rubenstein's article in this issue on fashion advertising photography; and this drawing, not an ad but an original, looked familiar.
She flipped over the drawing, marked up with art department crop lines, and there was the name, Warhol, along with the date on which the drawing ran in The Times.
Then a file of materials from the 50's yielded up a second original Warhol.
After 10 solid days buried among thousands of fashion papers in the windowless morgue, Quon emerged with a cache of nearly 30 Warhols, some credited, some uncredited, but clearly his.


NOTES
New York's movers and shakers won't have to stay home and watch "60 Minutes" on Sunday nights in November.
Al Pacino's film "Carlito's Way" will have its premiere on Nov. 7, followed by a supper party at the Plaza.
On the 14th, celebrities and their children will be at Planet Hollywood for burgers, fries and a screening of the film "Addams Family Values." Then there's the premiere of the film "George Balanchine's 'The Nutcracker,' " and a fund-raiser for the New York City Ballet and the School of American Ballet at the Ziegfeld Theater on Nov. 21.
"Sundays nights are ideal because I don't have to compete with all the other charity balls and parties," said Peggy Siegal, the publicity agent who is coordinating the screenings.


OCT. 17-23: The Bond Scandal; Avoiding Appearances Of Impropriety
The big Wall Street bond houses have tossed the political contribution issue back at the politicians.
Last week, 17 of New York's biggest firms, which had been embarrassed by a series of scandals that began in New Jersey, agreed to a voluntary ban on the contributions they make to candidates who may be in the powerful position of choosing who sells the billions of dollars worth of bonds issued by states, cities and towns each year.
The voluntary approach will be made mandatory by early next year by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the self-regulatory body for the municipal bond dealers.

Impatience Is Not the Same As Urgency
One of the most remarkable musical moments in Steve Reich's new theater work, "The Cave," which was given its New York premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival recently, was not actually composed by Mr.
Reich at all.
The work, in which Israeli Jews, Palestinian Moslems, and Americans are given a sort of religious Rorschach test about the patriarch Abraham and his immediate family, includes ritualistic chanting from the Hebrew Scriptures by an Ethiopian Jew, Ephraim Isaac.
By tradition, each word in the Hebrew text carries fixed melodic tropes, but Mr.
Isaac's chant was unlike any I have heard.
Its sinuous ornamentation was marked by strong, irregular accents; the chant was clearly influenced by African and Middle Eastern music.
One preoccupation of Mr.
Reich and his wife, Beryl Korot, who created the video portions of "The Cave," is the transformations and interpretations of sacred texts, including such traditional musical settings as Mr.
Isaac's.
The authors explore how tales are understood and misunderstood by Arabs, Jews and Americans.
And while "The Cave" does not live up to its promise to illuminate contemporary mythologies -- only the bluntest distinctions can be made in the sound bites coming from the video screens -- its ambition is intriguing.
The authors are trying to reveal the continuing life of ancient stories.


Former Tennis Pros Share Their Talents
DESPITE a proportionately large number of public and private tennis courts -- and players -- Connecticut has hardly been an incubator of big-time tennis talent.
Nor for that matter have any of the New England states.
Barbara Potter of Woodbury and Beth Norton of Fairfield have been the only women players from the state to achieve world-class status in modern times.
And only one player, Paul Gerken of Norwalk, ever approached stardom on the professional men's tour.
Another, Bud Schultz of Meriden, played briefly on the international circuit in the mid-1980's and is now a teaching pro in Brookline, Mass.
Successful Careers
Both Ms.
Potter and Ms.
Norton were touring pros for more than a decade, and both recorded victories over some of the world's best players.
But Mr.
Gerken's career was more spectacular, albeit shorter, before it ended at the age of 27 because of a serious shoulder injury and chronic tennis elbow.

Our Miss Pope
VIRGINIA POPE'S SEAT at any fashion show was unmistakable.
The sign on it said "Dean of Fashion Editors." She was the journalist who always wore a rakish hat perched on her blue-tinted hair and pristine white gloves -- the right one removed so she could take notes.
A diminutive figure with ramrod posture, she had a quick humor, unlimited charm, a commitment to accuracy and fairness, and the exquisite manners of an Edith Wharton heroine.
She was also among the first fashion journalists who could write "in a literary idiom," said the designer Charles James.
For anyone who knew her, the first response to the name Virginia Pope is "She was a lady!" For many in the American fashion world in the 30's, 40's and 50's, Miss Pope was also a hero.
She was instrumental in helping American designers to emerge as a world influence.
As the fashion editor of The New York Times from 1933 until 1955, she turned fashion writing into news.


In the Coming Free-Agent Market, It Could Be a Whole New Ball Game
This is the off season that clubs are supposed to retard their rush to put free agents on the Forbes 400 roster.
Television revenue will be slashed drastically beginning next season, small-market clubs say they won't spend because they are hurting badly, and large-market clubs say they have to trim their payrolls or at least practice their version of fiscal responsibility.
Owners have made similar noises in the past, but their promises -- or threats -- have often turned out to be empty and the players' pockets full.
In other words, watch their actions; don't listen to their words.


Biking the Adirondacks
RAIN sounds much softer in the country than in the city, so when I awoke on the first morning of a weeklong bicycle trip through the Adirondacks in late June, what I mistook for a rustling of leaves in the breeze was a fairly heavy rain.
My fears were confirmed by our bed and breakfast host, who had nothing but sympathy for my wife, Abby Schultz, and I, yet refused to give us a weather forecast.
"You're going to ride anyway, right?" he said.
We plugged along for two days and 110 miles in the rain as our rear wheels relentlessly kicked road grit up on our backs.
Grinning and bearing it seemed appropriate for the Adirondacks, six million acres of stunning lakes, forests and mountains where the climate and the economy can be harsh.
Life in the Adirondacks is not easy, residents like to say, but they add that the joy of living in the largest wilderness area east of the Mississippi far outweighs the pain.

Other Normandy
To the Editor: Somewhere in the article "Normandy's Historic Coast" by Libby Lubin (Sept. 5), your readers should have been advised about the other Normandy -- the Normandy to the north of the Seine, of which Rouen is the capital.
It is the Normandy of soaring Gothic cathedrals, of narrow cobblestone streets, of impregnable sculptured chalk cliffs harboring pebbled beaches and the haunts of the Hundred Years' War and its heroine, Joan of Arc.
Libby Lubin's Normandy is wonderful in its own right, but it is only half of one of the most lovely and rich areas of provincial France, one that abounds in old inns and in chateaus that welcome visitors.
Next time I hope she will head north across the bridge at Tancarville to discover the old-fashioned delights in the other Normandy.

Plea Deal Is Sought in Killing of a Journalist, Lawyers Say
Federal prosecutors are seeking a plea deal under which they would gain information and testimony from the man accused of planning to kill a crusading anti-drug journalist, lawyers in the case say.
A deal with the suspect, John Mena, would be a major development in the case because it would help prosecutors strengthen their evidence both against a teen-ager charged with shooting Manuel de Dios Unanue and against the high-level Colombian cocaine traffickers who they say ordered the 1992 slaying in Queens.

Air France Chief Quits Amid Strike
Air France's chairman, Bernard Attali, resigned today as the state-owned French carrier suffered a seventh day of crippling strikes and the Government said a cost-cutting plan would have to be revised for the airline.
Mr.
Attali was the chief architect of the plan to eliminate 4,000 jobs and reduce bonuses at the nation's flag carrier that prompted the strike.
It has already cost the airline more than $100 million.
He had argued that the cost-cutting was essential to return Air France to profitability after losses of $678.6 million in the first half of this year and $583.9 million in 1992.


Caveat Venditor
Once again, companies in the United States, Europe and Japan are helping a third world dictatorship acquire technology that can be used to develop weapons of mass destruction.
The equipment and materials they are selling are not leaking out inadvertently, but going out with the approval of the export-control authorities of their governments.
This time, the dictatorship is not Iraq.
It is Iran, whose leaders continue to vow "Death to America" and which tops the State Department list of terrorist countries.

Dinkins Gathers Democratic Power Players for a Final Push
Rushing around New York City, with stops at a union hall in Flushing, Queens, the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and the Gurdwara Sikh Temple in Ozone Park, Queens, Mayor David N. Dinkins kicked off the final full week of the mayoral campaign yesterday by attacking Rudolph W. Giuliani as a hard-core Republican who lacks compassion for the homeless and tolerance for New York's diversity.
Mr.
Dinkins, who was joined at some events by senior Congressional Democrats from Washington, including the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, worked persistently at themes that he has refined in recent weeks -- and that mayoral aides say he is likely to invoke often during the coming week.


Advocate Candidate Steps Up Attacks on Rival
Susan D. Alter, the Republican-Liberal candidate for public advocate, intensified her attacks yesterday on her Democratic opponent, Mark J. Green, the former Consumer Affairs Commissioner.
In recent days Ms.
Alter has accused Mr.
Green of unethical behavior as a commissioner, saying he used sheriffs to intimidate small-business owners into paying fines from the city.
"I think it's the height of hypocrisy," Ms.
Alter said in an interview.
"Mark Green, who claims his specialty is preventing consumer fraud, is engaged in massive unethical behavior in order to extract money from small-business people."


Congress Defends Religious Freedom
Three years ago the Supreme Court threw away decades of precedent and watered down the religious liberty of all Americans.
In a case involving the religious use of peyote by American Indians, the Court declared that states could criminalize all consumption of the substance without considering their laws' impact on the free exercise of religion.
By radically changing the ground rules for deciding claims of religious liberty, the Court alarmed organized religion, civil liberties organizations of all stripes and Senators as different in outlook as Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The House has passed a bill aimed at correcting the situation and now the Senate is expected to pass it overwhelmingly.


Fateful Decision: Staying to Guard a Pilot's Body
As the bullets and grenades whizzed through the streets of south Mogadishu on the night of Oct. 3, the Rangers made a fateful decision: after they retrieved two wounded soldiers from a downed Black Hawk helicopter, they stayed to guard the body of a dead pilot caught in the wreckage.
"Some people may think it is not normal to stick around a dead pilot," said Robert Gallagher, 31, a platoon sergeant who was wounded in a firefight near the Olympic Hotel.
"But when you work with people on a daily basis, you develop a bond. Whether you are killed or wounded, you need to have someone look after you."

This city was braced today for a possible eruption of factional violence after the United Nations failed to dissuade a Somali faction that opposes Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid from directing a "peace" march on Monday into southern Mogadishu, which is controlled by General Aidid.
United Nations and United States officials said the march by the faction, which is led by Mohammed Ali Mahdi, was the biggest threat to security in Mogadishu since General Aidid's forces declared a cease-fire on Oct. 9.

Bombing Causes Delay in British-Irish Talks
A day after 10 people were killed here by an Irish Republican Army bomb, the British and Irish Governments today postponed a meeting they had planned to hold on Wednesday in Belfast to discuss peace prospects for Northern Ireland.

Review/Music; 'Figaro,' Played for Efficiency
Although long stigmatized for its sleepy productions of the standard repertory, the New York City Opera put on a "Nozze di Figaro" on Saturday afternoon that told a very different story.
Saturday's performance -- and there will be four more through the rest of this month and into early November -- offered a model of limited resources turned to artistic advantage.
Carl Toms's sets and costumes are handsome without ostentation.
Christian Smith's current staging of the John Copley production does not pretend to originality, but every gesture and arrangement of players onstage are thought through and make perfect sense.
Almost to the rear ranks of Mozart's large cast, the singing on Saturday sounded strong.
Cast members listened to one another and paid attention to Scott Bergeson's wisely paced conducting from the pit.
Larger and richer opera houses could have put this performance before their own audiences without shame or hesitation, and charged them higher ticket prices in the process.


Jets Look Bad Again, But Insist They're Not
As the Jets continue their downward spiral, they are asking their fans: Who are you going to believe, us or your lying eyes?

Politics Mirrors Diversity's Drive In the Suburbs
For decades Westchester and Nassau Counties have flourished as places of escape.
And just as people left behind the frenzied harshness of city life, they also turned their backs on Democratic politics.
In this century, Westchester and Nassau have each selected only one Democratic county executive, and Westchester has never had a Democratic district attorney.
But all that could change soon.
For the first time in years, both of these Republican strongholds face formidable Democratic challenges for the job of county executive, and Westchester has a tight race for district attorney.

Don't Go Into Haiti Under Democracy Fig Leaf

Between political corruption and military violence lies a place called Haiti.
Not having enough to occupy our own "peacekeeping" forces in Somalia, the United States now seems determined to practice gunboat democracy in the western one-third of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
For somewhere between United Nations resolutions and U.S. troops there is a mythic past called Haitian "democracy," which must now be "restored" at once and at all cost.

Review/Music; Celestial Romance and the Darker Side
People in Austin must think a lot about rain, angels, card games and open roads.
Or so it seemed on Wednesday night at the Lone Star Roadhouse, the New York stop for "Songwriter: Austin on the Road," a tour by David Halley, Jo Carol Pierce, Jimmy Lafave and Michael Fracasso.
The four songwriters sat side by side -- Ms.
Pierce at an electric piano, the other three with guitars -- and played songs, sometimes alone, often with Mr.
Halley adding lead guitar.
For the early set, romance was the prime topic.
Lovers were extolled as angels; ex-lovers were put down: "You're like the sun behind clouds of gray/It don't get much darker when you take it away," Mr.
Halley sang in "When It Comes to You." But there were also glimpses of family matters, paranoia and death.

EVERY year, more than a million Americans require surgery to remove cataracts, opaque areas on the lens of the eye that cause blurred vision.
The problem is especially common in the elderly, but cataracts can also result from eye injuries or diseases like diabetes.
Whatever the cause, cataract surgery usually requires fine, hair-like stitches in the eye, and the patient must wear a bandage for weeks.
But an eye surgeon in Florida has patented a device that he says will eliminate the need for stitches and make full recovery possible within 10 days.

Bonnie Sue Samuels, a daughter of Daniel and Iris Samuels of Armonk, N.Y., was married yesterday to Dane Solomon, the son of Martin and Elaine Solomon of Merrick, L.I.
Rabbi David Greenberg performed the ceremony at Temple Shaaray Tefila in Bedford, N.Y.
Mrs.
Solomon, 29, is the director of advertising for Barneys New York.
She graduated from the University of Massachusetts.
Her father is an electrical engineer with Hardesty &amp; Hanover, an engineering consulting firm in New York.
Her mother is a sales coordinator at Fabulous Foods, caterers in Armonk.


Career Maverick Has a New Home at Conde Nast
When Conde Nast stunned the magazine industry in March by announcing the acquisition of Architectural Digest, the looming question was what would happen to Paige Rense, the 60-something editor in chief who has headed the magazine for 24 years.
Ms.
Rense is generally considered one of the most powerful editors in the industry.
She has also been somewhat of a maverick.
She operated out of Los Angeles when the rest of the competition was in New York.
And she was part of Knapp Communications, a small, tight-fisted magazine company, while her rivals reveled in the big budgets and lavish perks at Conde Nast, Hearst, Meredith and Hachette Filipacchi.

You are an immigrant from Ireland, five years in the United States.
You and your wife are expecting to become citizens soon.

It is the first you have heard of the charge or the proceeding, whatever it was, before the judge.


Workers' Compensation
Workers' compensation costs have soared in the region over the last decade, fueled by rising health-care costs, leaving the states struggling to cut spending on programs to compensate employees for work-related injury or disease.
For example, while new claims in New York have not gone up appreciably in the past ten years, payments have tripled, and medical payments alone increased 30 percent from 1991 to 1992.
The premiums for workers' compensation insurance, which businesses are required to carry, went up 14.4 percent in New York on Oct. 1.
Connecticut cut costs in June by reducing insurance premiums 17.5 percent and lowering minimum benefits.

Davis Makes His Case Down in Mexico City
Making a case that he should become the backup shooting guard, Hubert Davis (18 points) helped the Knicks to a 103-93 victory over the Houston Rockets tonight at the Sports Palace.
Davis shot 7 for 8 from the field, including three 3-pointers.
He did not miss in the second half.
Meanwhile, Rolando Blackman did not play.
Blackman is battling Davis for minutes at shooting guard behind John Starks, but Blackman is shooting just 28.7 percent during the preseason.
Coach Pat Riley will continue to evaluate Davis and Blackman during the remaining three preseason games, but it was hard to find fault with Davis's performance tonight.

Giuliani, Striving to Be Liked, Tries to Elude Shadow of '89
Rose Marie O'Keefe, Democratic state committeewoman and stalwart doyenne of the Bay Ridge party organization, saw the baby suddenly standing in the aisle of the American Legion hall, toddling up toward Rudolph W. Giuliani like an elfin litmus test as the mayoral candidate studiously made his argument to an overflow rainy-night crowd last Wednesday.
"He reached out and touched the baby on his head -- did you see that?" asked the amazed Ms.
O'Keefe, who first took Mr.
Giuliani around her Brooklyn streets in his 1989 campaign, when she was one of his pioneer Democratic defectors, and privately despaired at his prosecutorial stiffness.
"He never would have done that, been that mellow, four years ago."

Who could blame Todd Jancaitis for a little trepidation the other day as she embarked on her latest search for a quality used car?

"She told me that's what I needed," said Mrs.

So much for female bonding.
As for the salesmen who assisted her at other lots, she said: "They don't talk seriously to women buying a used car. They assume you have no money, no brains and no willpower."

That left others wondering which side was thinking of changing its position.

Review/Music; Muy Caliente, Salsa Comes to the Garden
"Marlboro Music's Combinacion Perfecta," a salsa show at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night, had all sorts of significance, not the least of which was the nearly four hours of extraordinary music and vocal improvising it presented.
No one looks on the present as a golden age, but the concert, which let a series of salsa's best vocalists challenge each other, argued that salsa is a genre overflowing with talent, and not all of it always heard on records.
And with the concert's corporate backing, the show suggested the weight Hispanic culture continues to gain in the United States; Marlboro is in the middle of a Hispanic concert series.
With the performers' constant cries of "Mi gente!" (My people!) or "Soy Borinqueno!" ("I'm a Puerto Rican!"), along with the parade of Puerto Rican flags wending their way through the audience, it was clear that the music was a rallying point for a group, bilingual and bicultural, whose identity has hardly been compromised.

Rivals Wage Fierce Debate In New Jersey
Gov.
Jim Florio and his Republican rival, Christine Todd Whitman, held their third and most freewheeling debate today, frequently cutting each other off, talking over each other and uttering sarcastic asides in their last scheduled encounter before Election Day.

But seated side-by-side and freed of the format of the first two debates, which limited their ability to respond to each other, Mrs.

Gore's press secretary in 1989, when he was a Senator, said simply, "Because Mrs. Clinton asked and because health care is of vital importance to the President, the First Lady and the American people."


Health Proposal Could Leave Aliens in U.S. Without Care
At Su Clinica Familiar, the largest community health care center in the Rio Grande Valley, the issue of whether a patient is an illegal immigrant is met with a kind of "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
If a pregnant women provides a utility bill or phone bill showing she has a local address, she is legally entitled to treatment, though only part of it is reimbursable to the clinic through Medicaid.
A few miles away, at the McAllen Medical Center, where care for indigents costs the hospital up to $1 million a month, a different strategy prevails.
Private security guards with green uniforms that bear an uncanny resemblance to those of the United States Border Patrol have been periodically posted at the entrance.
Critics say they are put there to discourage illegal aliens from walking in.

'92 Titlists Repeat on Charles
Vester Boat Club of Philadelphia and the Boston Rowing Center both successfully defended their 1992 men's and women's championship eights titles at today's annual Head of the Charles Regatta.
This fall rowing rite, patterned after the English "head" style races in which the crews are timed over the course rather than in side-by-side racing, has become in its 29-year history the largest single-day rowing competition in the world.
Today's racing conditions on the Charles River were difficult for the 4,000 competitors, who contended with gusting winds that produced slow times over the winding three-mile course.
Vester overpowered its hometown rival Penn Athletic Club to retain the men's eight's title, winning in the time of 14 minutes 19.97 seconds, 15.05 seconds ahead of Penn A.C.
Brown University, which last year was disqualified from first place in this race, finished third this year.


Canada Votes Today With Polls Suggesting a Victory by Liberals
Canada, whose 18.5 million eligible voters inhabit six time zones, chooses a new Parliament on Monday and appears virtually certain to end nine years of Progressive Conservative government.
The Liberal Party leader, Jean Chretien, who is expected to become the country's 20th Prime Minister, spent the last day of the seven-week campaign in his home town of Shawingigan, Quebec, urging voters to give the Liberals at least the 148 seats they will need in the 295-seat lower house of Parliament to form a majority Government.

On Friday he did some light work and proclaimed to the Browns' owner, Art Modell: "I'm playing in the Pittsburgh game. I'm just not going to miss that."


Mandela, the Politician, Does as the Zulus Do
South Africans know Nelson Mandela as a cosmopolitan man who favors gray suits over skins and feathers and English over Xhosa, his native language.
Some of his urbane lieutenants in the African National Congress scarcely hide their distaste for tribal rites.
But there is an election coming, and so today 60,000 admirers watched another Nelson Mandela -- grimacing uneasily while tribal diviners wearing beads and goat bladders in their hair swayed at his feet, burning incense to drive off evil spirits; hearing his praises screamed in the sing-song cadences reserved for African kings; and finally rising to read a speech in clumsy Zulu.


Networks Gain Riches From News Magazines
On Sunday, more Americans turn to "60 Minutes" than any other television show.
By Monday, if they haven't had their fill of news magazines, they can turn to "Day One," ABC's newest entrant to the genre.
And on Tuesday, there's more with "Dateline NBC"
So it goes throughout the week.
Every day except Saturday there is a network news magazine to choose from: "Eye-to-Eye," "Now," "48 Hours," "20/20" and "Prime Time Live." Often indistinguishable from one another, each seeks a niche in an increasingly crowded field.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; Sun Sets on CBS Baseball Amid 'South of Sunset' Spots
CBS is long past the point of looking for silver linings in its four-year contract with Major League Baseball that ended Saturday night with the last pitch of the World Series.
That deal, in fact, cost CBS just about every ounce of silver it owned -- along with gold, nickel and copper.
CBS absorbed losses of about $500 million on the $1 billion contract.
But perhaps the investment will help CBS bring a few extra viewers to "South of Sunset." According to George Schweitzer, the senior vice president who creates and executes on-air promotion for CBS, the business of inducing viewers to watch a new television show is "a contact-impact business -- you've got to make contact to have impact."

Two airlines promote images, not just fares, to win new customers.
DISCOUNTED air fares are as common these days as delayed flights out of Atlanta.
American Airlines touched off a round of fare cuts to Europe last month.
Northwest Airlines started another round of discounting over the weekend.
With all this focus on price, price and price, why bother trying to pump up an airline's brand name in an age when a perfect flight often means one that is uneventful, inexpensive and adds enough frequent-flier mileage to qualify for a free trip?

The first Hamptons International Film Festival came to an end yesterday with the presentation here of Golden Arrow Audience Awards for best film, best short and best director, and 10 Student Film Showcase Awards.

"Flight of the Innocent" also won the prize for most popular film.
The winner of the award for most popular short film was "The Big Gig," directed by Jeffrey Nachmanoff.

Review/Television; Losing Jobs and Hope In 'The Great Depression'
Experiences burned into the memories of those who endured America's toughest times are at the heart of "The Great Depression," a gritty seven-hour documentary that begins tonight on PBS.
The producers, led by Henry E. Hampton ("Eyes on the Prize"), also make effective use of strong black-and-white newsreel clips from the 1920's and 30's, zesty folk songs and an intelligent narration, but it is the memories that give this history its punch and drive.
The first hour, "A Job at Ford's," focuses on the automobile company that drew tens of thousands of European immigrants, Mexicans and Southern blacks to Detroit after World War I to produce the Model T, then the most popular car in the world.

Review/Television; Wisecracks and Angst: Fortyish Baby Boomers
"Dave's World" is a prime-time approximation of the world of Dave Barry, the humorist who writes his syndicated Pulitzer Prize-winning "Dave's World" column for The Miami Herald.
While the sitcom, Mondays at 8:30 on CBS, is based on two Barry books, Mr.
Barry pointedly keeps his distance from the series, not wanting the real Dave to be confused with the television version.
Yeah, sure.
Just keep those checks coming.
Like Mr.
Barry, this television family lives quite comfortably in a Miami suburb.
Unlike Mr.
Barry and his wife, who have one son, television's Dave (Harry Anderson) and his wife, Beth (DeLane Matthews), have two.
They also have two close friends, Shel (Meshach Taylor), a plastic surgeon, and Kenny (Shadoe Stevens), Dave's editor.
Kenny's secretary is Mia (J. C. Wendel), who wouldn't think of missing a production of "Fiddler on the Roof" starring John Davidson.

Strong Sports Agency Key in Yankee Saga
In 1971, when the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority set out to build its huge entertainment complex in the swamps of East Rutherford, it had one overarching priority: luring the New York Yankees away from the Bronx.

Give Science More Life, A Panel Urges Teachers
A commission appointed by an independent science organization will recommend sweeping changes today in science education in public schools, saying that existing curriculums try to cover too much, do not teach enough practical application of science and fail to integrate the subject with math and technology.
In its four-year study, "Benchmarks for Science Literacy," the commission offers broad recommendations for what students should know after the second, fifth, eighth and 12th grades.
Students as young as 5 years old should receive regular science lessons -- not just scattered experiments like collecting snowflakes and learning that they all have six points -- and these lessons should be given as often as reading or arithmetic, the study said.


No Larger NATO Now
The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary want to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
But the Clinton Administration is right to say no for now.
The Administration is instead offering all the countries of the former Soviet empire closer ties to NATO and holding open the possibility of eventual membership without setting a timetable.
Eastern European countries understandably want the U.S. security guarantees that come with NATO membership.
Historically caught between the competing ambitions of Russia and Germany, they have learned the hard lessons of relying on themselves alone or on unreliable allies like Britain and France in the 1930's.
But the dangers they now face can be met without formally binding the U.S. to come to their defense.


Police Seek Links In 2 Disappearances
Police officials in New York State who are trying to find a missing 12-year-old girl have sent an investigator to Massachusetts, where the body of another girl was found on Saturday.
Massachusetts State Police believe the victim is Holly Piirainen, 10 years old, who disappeared from Sturbridge on Aug. 5 while taking a walk.
Two hunters found the body in a wooded area of nearby Brimfield at about 8:30 Saturday morning.


Customized Radio Services Find More Air Time
Two companies best known for supplying traffic reports for radio station listeners, Shadow Broadcasting Service Inc. and its larger rival, Metro Networks Inc., are expanding their scope by offering customized news, weather and sports broadcasts to a growing number of radio stations.
Such ventures are unusual in the highly fragmented radio industry.
While stations can supplement their own programming with syndicated segments like Casey Kasem's Top 40, Rush Limbaugh's talk show, or ABC News, more topical local information typically had to be produced by each station's news staff. 'A Logical Extension'
Even The Associated Press's broadcast wire, used by more than half of all radio stations, generally carries only regional, national and foreign, not local, news.


Your Very Own Cold War
It's the plot of a hundred cold-war novels, and who knows how many pre-1990 Hollywood films:
A patriotic American sneaks into Communist Moscow, hoping to get a look at -- and perhaps steal -- the latest in top-secret Soviet military hardware.
The future of the free world is at stake.
There's lots of action, tons of espionage, and in the end, the daring American triumphs, flying home safely with the knowledge that either (a) the Commies weren't as advanced as we thought or (b) we'll have to spend billions more to stay ahead in the arms race.

Market Place; A hot designer's planned offering still faces thorny issues.
ALTHOUGH many in the garment industry and on Wall Street doubted that it would happen, the Donna Karan Company is scheduled to offer the public a stake in its high-flying fashion business in the fourth week of November, according to Bear, Stearns &amp; Company, the lead underwriter of the offering.
Ms.

She graduated from Newcomb College and received a law degree from the New England School of Law.


Building Superindent Accused of Sodomy
A building superintendent sexually assaulted a 14-year-old in Brooklyn yesterday, forcing him into a building basement and sodomizing him, the police said.
The attack occurred about 7:30 P.M. near the intersection of Avenue J and East 46th Street in Midwood, where the boy was riding his bicycle, said Sgt.
John McCluskey, a police spokesman.
The boy, who is deaf and dumb, was not identified.


Bridge
Shouting orally at the bridge table is always discouraged.
Shouting technically is another matter.
That is often welcomed, sometimes by an opponent.
An example is the diagramed deal, played two decades ago.
The declarer was Richard Khautin of Manhattan, whose death three weeks ago deprived the New York bridge community of one of its most popular members.
At the time of the deal he held a national title that no longer exists: the Life Master Men's Pairs.
The traditional jump raise of three spades, game forcing, was still common then and was used by the partnership en route to an optimistic six spades.


Boitano in Search of His Version of Bliss: One More Heavenly Day
He has made small, inevitable concessions to age and injury since that unearthly night when Brian Boitano felt "as if angels were lifting and spinning me" to a gold medal at the 1988 Winter Olympics.
Once, he gave pet names to his individual gray hairs.
Now, Boitano joked, he must name entire tufts.
Two years ago, he tore a tendon in his right knee.

There are smiling faces galore around the streaking Devils these days, but a lucrative four-year contract just about sealed and delivered makes Ken Daneyko's smile more radiant than the rest.
Daneyko has displayed such remarkable loyalty to the Devils in his 11 seasons with the organization that John McMullen, the team's chairman, has a special place in his heart for the rugged defenseman.

Chiat/Day May Get Cherry Coke Account
The Coca-Cola Company is moving closer to awarding its Cherry Coke brand to Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif.
Advertising executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity said on Friday that although the discussions on the assignment had not been completed, Chiat/Day seemed likely to join soon the widening roster of Coca-Cola agencies, which expanded earlier this month to include similarly unconventional creative shops like Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., and Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis.


Review/Theater; Futile Wait for a Ferry to a Mystical Island
In the most famous scene in Brian Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa," five Irish sisters in County Donegal, 1936, suddenly break loose from their household drudgery to explode in dance to the music pouring out of their new Marconi radio.
The scene has a power transcending language.
As if by magic, the women levitate in spiritual ecstasy even as every fact of their lives pulls them closer to poverty, heartbreak and death.
"Wonderful Tennessee," Mr.
Friel's new play at the Plymouth Theater, explores more or less the same themes, and why not?
It is an eternal drama that time never heals.
Life rushes on, fast and cruel, and still we cannot stop hungering irrationally for some mystical release, or, as "Wonderful Tennessee" puts it, for "whatever it is we desire but can't express."

Dykstra, a Winner, Goes Home a Loser
There was an element of disbelief in Lenny Dykstra's face as he sat with his back to the crowd, looking into his locker.
He had watched Joe Carter's home run off Mitch Williams sail past Milt Thompson in left field, over the blue wall, ending the World Series.
He knew the Phillies had lost, 8-6, to Toronto in the sixth and final game, ending a ride even he could not have predicted.


Jiri Hajek, 80, Dies; Human Rights Aide And Czech Official
Jiri Hajek, the Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia during the short-lived liberal reforms in 1968 that became known as the Prague Spring, died Friday in a hospital in Prague, the Reuters news agency reported.
He was 80.
The agency, citing a human-rights advocate, Libuse Silhanova of the Czech Helsinki Citizens Assembly, said the cause was cancer.


Review/Music; Masur's Gewandhaus: A Display of Tradition And Maybe the Future
There were times, during the performances by the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in Avery Fisher Hall on Friday night, when a listener was granted a glimpse of the musical future.
Kurt Masur, Kapellmeister of the 250-year-old orchestra since 1970, was not only displaying the distinguished ensemble's natural sense of breath and gesture, he was also revealing how he might continue to transform his local orchestra, the 151-year-old New York Philharmonic, during coming seasons.
In the performance of Mendelssohn's "Italian" Symphony, and even in the same composer's operatically demonstrative Overture to "Ruy Blas," technique and incisiveness were less the point than comradely dedication.
It was as if Mr.
Masur and his players were saying: "We are a community in agreement here. Join us in musical exploration." In the Mendelssohn symphony this sometimes made for too relaxed an approach, creating slack lines in the midst of the score's skittish energy, but the beauty and sense of communality in the playing was unmistakable.


Joyful Molitor Is the Blue Jay With the Red Eyes
Paul Molitor might as well have been a teddy bear.
Over and over again, different Blue Jays sought him out and hugged him.
Over and over again.
There was Dave Stewart.
There was Joe Carter.
There was Cito Gaston.
Gaston was not crying until he saw the tears dripping from Molitor's eyes.
So the manager cried, too.
Of all those who rejoiced after Toronto's second straight World Series championship Saturday night, there may not have been anyone who relished it more than Molitor.
This was the reason he started playing baseball.
This was the reason he spent 15 years in Milwaukee, playing and losing in a World Series in 1982 and futilely waiting for the next chance.
It was the reason he left Milwaukee for Toronto.
He wanted the World Series ring.


Ethnic Shifts in Electorate Play Part in the Mayoral Riddle of Who Will Win
How can David N. Dinkins possibly win again when his margin over Rudolph W. Giuliani four years ago was less than 50,000 votes and when public opinion polls suggest that Hispanic and white liberal Dinkins voters are defecting?
The most tantalizing mathematical riddle of the New York City mayoral campaign might be answered, in part, by changes in the city's complexion: the proportion of older whites has shrunk; the share of black and Hispanic registered voters appears to have climbed.

But Mr.

"The guys who live around here, we all know each other, we talk," he said.
"The cops say, 'Where do you live?' and 'You've got to get off this corner.' We have all lived here for years."

METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY CONGENIALITY PLAYS ROLE IN CAMPAIGN For years, as he became a career master of indictment and conviction, Rudolph W. Giuliani could afford to treat likability as a secondary characteristic of private, not necessarily public, value.
His defeat in 1989 changed that, he said.
In this campaign, he is determined not to "play into that stereotype of a mechanical man." His success may determine the outcome of the vote.

Re-elect Governor Florio
America's politicians are seeking an answer from next week's election in New Jersey.
Is it possible to survive after raising taxes?
New Jersey, meanwhile, seeks a capable governor.
We recommend re-electing the one they have.
In 1990, newly installed Gov.
Jim Florio put through the biggest tax increase in the state's history, having said in his campaign that he saw no need for any increase.
In light of the prevailing anti-tax sentiment, it was a brave move.
And it was absolutely necessary for New Jersey, as it has been for other states and for the Federal Government, Republican supply-side nostrums notwithstanding.
The added revenue solved the problems at hand -- balancing the budget while boosting school aid.

One Jury's Journey; Amid Case's Facts and a City's Fears, Seeking Rationale for Jurors' Findings
The verdicts in the city's second case of a videotaped beating, announced piecemeal last week by a jury trying to avoid a deadlock, have produced a new set of incongruous images to symbolize the social and racial dissonances of Los Angeles.
There was the scene of one defendant, Damian M. Williams, his head shaved for the verdict, raising his arms in jubilation in the courtroom much as he did in the riots 18 months ago after he hurled a brick at the head of a white truck driver, Reginald O. Denny.


'Write Me,' a Senator Says, And the People Take Heed

The lyrics are something of an understatement.
Ms.
Boxer, a Democrat elected last year, gets more than 10,000 letters a day -- not counting the 5,000 or so mass mailings sent daily to every member of Congress by lobbying groups.


Review/Music; Chamber Society's 25th Anniversary
Lincoln Center took a chance when it established a resident Chamber Music Society in 1969.
Although not entirely moribund, chamber music was a backwater then.
Several string quartets and mixed-timbre groups toured and made recordings, and depending on how one approached it, the repertory was either the nectar of connoisseurs or the height of elitist stuffiness.
But classical-music elitism was not yet the whipping boy it has lately become, and it was possible in those days to redefine a supposedly elitist repertory as revolutionary and egalitarian, by virtue of its one-player-to-a-part structure.
The folksy charm of the society's founding director, Charles Wadsworth, gave this new populist image a push.
By the late 1970's, Mr.
Wadsworth and his group were widely credited with starting a chamber music boom.


Plot by Baghdad to Assassinate Bush Is Questioned
The evidence of an Iraqi assassination plot against George Bush, the basis for a United States missile attack in June on the intelligence headquarters in Baghdad, was significantly weaker than the Clinton Administration asserted, a new article says.
The article, written by Seymour M. Hersh and published in The New Yorker this week, says no evidence directly linked President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, his intelligence service or his senior advisers to an assassination attempt on the former President.


Series Rating Drops From '92
The CBS telecast of Game 6 of the World Series Saturday night drew an overnight Nielsen rating in 29 markets of 20.0 with a 34 share.
That's down 11 percent from last year's overnight rating of 22.6 and 40 for Game 6, which, like this year, was the final game of the Series.
Toronto was the winner in both cases.
Full national ratings for Game 6 will not be available until tomorrow.
A ratings point represents 1 percent of all television households in America, or about 942,000 homes.
The share represents the percentage of televisions in use.

Review/Music; A Vocally Outsize 'Tosca'
Franco Zeffirelli's sprawling production of "Tosca" at the Met poses considerable challenges to the mere mortals who must sing within it.
The opera can become a contest of simply making oneself heard.
In a cast change on Wednesday night, Janis Martin was the clear winner over her male rivals, plowing across the lead role in high diva style. (Her tone suffered as a result: notes in the upper range had a rough finish and sometimes broke apart altogether.)
Yuri Mazurok was weaker by comparison.
He made the motions of a successful Scarpia, but his burnished baritone got lost in the tumult of the first-act finale.
Emil Ivanov, singing Cavaradossi, made more headway; his tenor, while not enormous, came through in rich, dark, Russian fashion.
The audience received him rather coolly, perhaps because of some awkward diction and a wobbly pressure on the final note of each major aria.


Tokyo Journal; What Great Grief Has Made the Empress Mute?
Even in a new age of openness for Japan, the subject is just too hot to touch, on television and in print.
But for the last several days a single question has been whispered throughout the country: has the Japanese press driven Empress Michiko to the brink of a nervous breakdown?
Outside the Imperial Palace, very little is known about the condition of the much-admired Empress since she collapsed last Wednesday, on her 59th birthday.
The only confirmed report is that she cannot speak.


Pursuing Fairness in Big Prudential Settlement
Irving M. Pollack, a father of modern securities regulation, is a judicious man steeped in the ways of Wall Street, so he is not about to come right out and reveal his deepest convictions about the Prudential Securities case.
But given his life work as a Government crusader, it is perhaps safe to say that the allegations against Prudential turn his stomach.
A visceral reaction to wrongdoing has long motivated Mr.
Pollack, and it seemed to figure prominently in his decision last week to take a job that could prove fraught with frustrations: the administrator overseeing the settlement of the vast fraud charges against Prudential, which is accused of cheating hundreds of thousands of customers in the sale of more than $8 billion of limited energy partnerships in the 1980's.


A Singular Defense Team; Religion and Variety of Styles Help Set Lawyers Apart in Trade Center Bombing Trial
There comes a moment in the trial of four men in the bombing of the World Trade Center when worlds mingle and sometimes clash.
The scene is this: A tall Federal agent with the standard-issue mustache and dark blue suit has been led through his testimony by a prosecutor (who, except for the mustache, looks quite a lot like the witness).
The prepared testimony finished, the moment for improvisation arrives and Hassen Ibn Abdellah, a slim, agile man with a closely cropped beard, strides to the lawyer's podium and interrupts the smooth and cozy proceeding.


Bills Take Away a Lesson From Super Bowl
In a victory produced by forcing a total of four Jet fumbles and intercepted passes, the Bills continued today to erase the memory of their Super Bowl-record nine turnovers committed against the Cowboys.
Even when they win, though, the Bills are reminded of past Super Bowl flaws, as if under some perpetual cloud that follows them around.
So today's 19-10 opportunistic decision over the Jets evoked the 52-17 loss to the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVII.


Fearful Rural Haitians Yearn for Aristide's Return
For the people of this lush green hamlet set amid eroded hills, the debate in the United States about the mental health of their President seems cruelly sterile.
After two years of hardship and violence under military rule, no hope rings more fervently than for the return of the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Frightened to speak openly, residents of Cazales leaving church in their Sunday best or sitting in the shade of their neat courtyards whispered their thoughts in furtive snatches to a visiting foreigner.
Six days before the scheduled but still uncertain return of Father Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected leader, the conclusions were the same almost everywhere.

Sales came in at an annual rate of 7.8 million, up from 6.8 million in the first 10 days of the month and more than the 6.6 million pace in September.
In addition, sales of existing homes rose 2.6 percent last month, to the highest level of the year.

One Smile (Only One) Can Lift A Mood
AS smiles are beginning to come under precise study, researchers report that not just any happy face will actually make the smiler feel happy.
A polite smile, a smile of feigned enjoyment or a grin-and-bear-it grimace will not give the physiological lift that accompanies a genuine grin.
The truly happy smile, new research suggests, can be described quite precisely in terms of the two main muscles involved, the Zygomaticus major, which runs from the cheekbones to the corners of the lips, and the Orbicularis oculi, which circles each eye.
A smile that does not involve both muscles, like the one at left on page C1, does not make the grade, the research suggests.

Almost ever since election night four years ago, Rudolph W. Giuliani has been haunted by his image as an agitated candidate shouting "shut up" at his supporters when some of them began booing at the very mention of David N. Dinkins's name.
The image of him shouting "shut up" that night became so much a part of the mayoral campaign mythology that even he accepted it suggests the ease with which fact and impression can sometimes merge in politics.


Clinton and Mubarak Differ on Israel-Syria Timing
President Clinton and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt differed today on how quickly to press Israel and Syria to reach a settlement in the wake of the breakthrough between Israel and the Palestinians.

Mubarak urged the United States to move speedily to bring about an Israeli-Syrian deal over the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
Such a deal would require an Israeli withdrawal in exchange for normalized relations with Syria.

Dinkins's Narrow Lead in Poll May Be No Lead at All, a Study Suggests
The latest New York Times /WCBS-TV News Poll shows Mayor David N. Dinkins slightly ahead of his Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, with 46 percent of registered voters supporting him, compared with 40 percent for Mr.
Giuliani.
But polling experts said yesterday that those apparently positive numbers should make Mr.
Dinkins very nervous.
Not only is his lead within the poll's margin of sampling error, but it may also be overstated.
A national study of nine general elections in which a black Democrat faced a white Republican found that polls consistently overestimated the black candidate's strength.
Larry Hugick, the pollster who studied those elections, concluded that a black candidate who leads by fewer than 8 percentage points probably has no lead at all.

Menotti Leaves Spoleto U.S.A.
In what has become virtually an annual ritual, the composer Gian Carlo Menotti announced on Sunday evening that he was severing his ties with the board and management of Spoleto Festival U.S.A., the arts festival he founded 17 years ago in Charleston, S.C.
In previous skirmishes, Mr.
Menotti, the festival's artistic director, presented demands and ultimatums and the festival's board acquiesced, but this time reconciliation seems unlikely.
In a telephone interview from his castle in Gifford, Scotland, yesterday, Mr.
Menotti, who cited as reasons for his withdrawal both the festival's financial problems and the board's opposition to his policies, said that his decision was irrevocable.
"It's the end, and I'm glad," he said.
"I'm just tired of putting up with the mess down there. Now I want to take my festival and do it my own way, not their way."


Ousting Tricksters Is a Treat
IT is a question few communities have ever had to answer, but one that Camden could not avoid: what do you do when Halloween phantasms become real enough to kill you?
Two years ago, on Oct. 30, neighborhoods all over the city went up in the flames of 130 fires, most of them deliberately set.
Trash cans blazed, Dumpsters and garages smoldered, houses burned.
No one died, but what the authorities later determined to be largely the work of rival gangs, perhaps 250 young people altogether, held an entire city hostage.
It was Mischief Night, the night before Halloween, a time that in the not-too-distant past meant shaving cream on windows, toilet paper in the trees and a few smashed jack-o'-lanterns by the curb.

Ms.

St. Louis Strengthens Its Expansion Hopes
The race for two expansion franchises in the National Football League took a dramatic turn yesterday when a St.
Louis ownership group acquired the controlling investor it had been seeking.
As a result, when the N.F.L. owners meet in Chicago today to pick the new franchises, St.
Louis and Charlotte will be clear favorites.
Jerry Clinton, the leader of the original St.
Louis group, bowed out of that role yesterday morning and apparently is out of the picture.
That cleared the way for a group formed last week by Stan Kroenke of Columbia, Mo., who is said to have a net worth of $500 million.
The 46-year-old Kroenke has grown from the co-owner of one clothing store to the developer of more than 50 shopping centers across the nation.
He is the son-in-law of James Walton, whose brother, Sam, founded the Wal-Mart chain.

QVC's Move Is Awaited As Viacom Begins Bid
Amid a flurry of hastily convened news conferences and analysts' meetings, Viacom Inc. began its $10 billion tender offer for Paramount Communications Inc. yesterday.
But Wall Street's attention remained focused on Viacom's nemesis, QVC Network Inc.
For a few weeks, Barry Diller, QVC's supremely confident chairman, was riding high.
His $9.5 billion bid was $2 billion better than Viacom's and the market adored him.


3 Guilty Pleas In Killing, Say Court Papers
Three people have pleaded guilty to helping arrange the murder of a crusading anti-drug journalist and are cooperating with the authorities against other conspirators, according to court papers unsealed yesterday.
The papers also say that the execution-style killing of Manuel de Dios Unanue at a Queens restaurant on March 11, 1992, was ordered by a man identified as Jose Santa Cruz Londono, who the authorities say is a leader of a Colombian drug cartel, because he was angered by articles Mr. de Dios was publishing in one of his Spanish-language magazines that were based in New York.


Doubts on Reno's Competence Rise in Justice Dept.
Six months after taking over as Attorney General, Janet Reno has achieved wide public popularity, but inside the Justice Department the euphoria has waned.
Career lawyers have begun to question whether her personal appeal will translate into substantive gains for the agency.
Many people got their first taste of the crusty former prosecutor during her commanding performance after the Federal Bureau of Investigation's April assault on the Branch Davidian compound.
Aides say she still gets hundreds of admiring letters each week.


Japan Officials Move to Open The Construction Market
In what could prove to be the first breakthrough in tense trade negotiations between the Clinton Administration and the new Japanese Government, the chief Cabinet secretary announced this morning the outlines of a program for opening Japan's scandal-tainted construction market.
The outlines of the program -- which were negotiated at the end of last week -- were sketchy, and they did not meet some of the basic American demands for concrete actions.
But some American officials indicated they would probably be enough to halt the United States from imposing sanctions against Japanese construction companies in the United States because they suggested a commitment to real change.


Study Offers Support For an Apple a Day
THERE might be something to the adage "an apple a day keeps the doctor a way." Scientists in the Netherlands have evidence that flavonoids, chemicals naturally present in certain foods and drinks like apples, onions and tea, may reduce the risk of death from coronary heart disease.
Previous studies have suggested that flavonoids in red wine might provide similar protection.
The findings, reported in the current issue of The Lancet, are from a five-year study of 805 Dutch men from 65 to 84 years old.

G.M.'s Pact Disappoints Wall Street
Wall Street expressed its disappointment today with the three-year labor contract tentatively reached on Sunday between the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers as shares of G.M. fell sharply.
An announcement by the company after the stock market closed today bodes more woes for the stock on Tuesday.
General Motors said it would take a $950 million pretax charge against third-quarter earnings to add to its reserves for plant closings.


Nova Vicosa Journal; Art From the Amazon's Ashes Is Arousing Brazil
Deep in the forest, the woodsman with splayed peasant's toes and a graying hermit's beard descended from his treehouse and recounted a visit he made last year to the elegant galleries of the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro.
"Women came up to me crying, wanting to talk to me," the shy 72-year-old sculptor, Frans Krajcberg, recalled of his foray to Rio, 430 miles down the Atlantic coast.
"People ran after me, just to touch me. It was the first time in my life I managed to have a real impact."


Sports of The Times; A Gladiator In That Dark Valley
I N the savage world of football, American civilization's substitute for the Peloponnesian War, it was a routine play in Giants Stadium Sunday, a normal collision of 300-pounders, or thereabouts, and one that resulted in a player going down and writhing in pain on the green playing floor.
Common enough.
Except this was a Jets' player with an injury that had caused concern before the game, and it took no great leap of the imagination, as the team trainer and doctor hustled onto the Astroturf field, to remember Dennis Byrd.

In a move clearly intended to add credibility to its clones of Intel's microprocessors, Advanced Micro said today it had entered into a licensing agreement with Microsoft to use the "Windows Compatible" logo on its Am386 and Am486DX microprocessor packaging, advertising and collateral marketing materials.
Intel and Advanced Micro are in protracted litigation over Advanced Micro's rights to make clones of Intel chips.

Hevesi and Mr.
Badillo -- two unusually intelligent candidates who are both well versed in government.
Mr.
Badillo, a lifelong Democrat who lost the Democratic primary to Mr.

Most of the premier players on the list of free agent eligibles sent a message to their clubs yesterday.
To show that they were serious about the possibility of moving elsewhere, they filed for free agency on the first day they could.
A pair of New York pitchers, Sid Fernandez of the Mets and Lee Smith of the Yankees, filed.
So did first basemen Andres Galarraga of Colorado, the National League batting champion, Will Clark of San Francisco and Rafael Palmeiro of Texas; outfielder Otis Nixon of Atlanta; third baseman Chris Sabo of Cincinnati, and pitchers Mark Portugal of Houston and Dennis Martinez of Montreal.


New York City Elections; Mark Green for Public Advocate
We endorse the Democrat Mark Green over both Susan Alter, the Republican-Liberal candidate, and Ronald Reale, a Conservative, in the race for public advocate -- a job in search of a definition.
As we said during the crowded Democratic primary, which Mr.
Green won over Ms.
Alter, Mr.
Reale and three other candidates, the voluble Mr.
Green is so enthusiastic about public service that he might actually find a rationale for a city post that now has little meaning.
Mr.
Green's chief opponent is Ms.
Alter, a 15-year veteran of the City Council.
Ms.
Alter -- a Democrat running, like Herman Badillo, on Rudolph Giuliani's fusion ticket -- is familiar with city issues.
But is she forceful and effective enough to give shape to a city position that has lost its only real power?

Can Whitman Win as the Anti-Florio?
If the race for governor of New Jersey were simply a personality contest, Christine Todd Whitman would win hands down.
Affable, charming and impressive in person, she is her campaign's second-best asset (the first being Gov. Jim Florio himself).
People who know her like her.
People who meet her like her.
Even people who may not be inclined to vote for her find her a lot easier to talk to than her opponent, a man so naturally guarded he spent a few minutes before the second debate practicing his smile.
But with a week to go before the election, Mrs.
Whitman finds herself down in the polls, if gaining quickly, against one of the most harshly vilified governors in New Jersey's history.
She has staked her campaign more on anti-Florio sentiment and Republican party doctrine, largely obscuring the woman behind the campaign and leaving many voters with a sense that they still do not know who she is.

Agency Drops Abuse Inquiry in Allen Case
New York State child welfare investigators have dropped their inquiry into the charge that Woody Allen sexually molested his 7-year-old daughter, saying they consider the accusation unfounded.
The state Department of Social Services informed Mr.
Allen in a letter dated Oct. 7 that it had closed the 14-month-old investigation.
"No credible evidence was found that the child named in this report has been abused or maltreated," the letter said.
"This report has, therefore, been considered unfounded."


Jury Inquiry Into Lopez
A Federal grand jury here is examining evidence that an executive of the General Motors Corporation took company secrets with him when he defected to Volkswagen A.G. last spring, lawyers for the executive and Volkswagen said today.
Justice Department officials said they could not confirm or deny this, but they have confirmed that the department is investigating whether the executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortura, systematically looted trade secrets when he left G.M., where he was purchasing chief, for Volkswagen in March.
German justice officials are also investigating.


Recalling 1968, French Prime Minister Backs Off
The clear message emerging today from Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's extraordinary retreat on Sunday in his Government's conflict with Air France is that Mr.
Balladur has no stomach for conflict at a time when he judges France to be ripe for a social explosion of the sort that rocked the country a quarter-century ago.
"Mr. Balladur worked closely with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou during the May 1968 riots, and he has an abiding fear of a repetition," said Pierre Avril, a political analyst at the Sorbonne.
"So he opted for a retreat rather than confront a situation that risked becoming uncontrollable."


Plants Share Precious Water With Neighbors
TRACKING the global cycling of water from sky to earth and back again, scientists had thought they could count on at least one thing.
The movement of water through plants, it seemed, was simple: up into the roots and out through the leaves as vapor.
But now they are discovering that plants are not the passive water vaporizers they had been thought to be.
Instead, researchers have found an unsuspected detour in the routing of water.
And this discovery may enhance the understanding not only of how plants interact with one another but how ecosystems function and even how climate can change.
It turns out that in the night, many plants pull water up from deep in the earth and, rather than holding on to it to pass through their leaves the next day, they flush it out through their shallow roots into the ground around them.
Biologists say that plants ranging from sagebrush in the arid steppes of Utah to sugar maples in the rainy forests of upstate New York appear to be acting as subterranean watering systems, drenching the soil and their thirsty neighbors.

The jury forewoman in the trial of two black men who beat a white truck driver during the Los Angeles riots defended the jury's verdict today in an extraordinary meeting with reporters.
She asserted that the jury's rejection of the most serious charges was not influenced by racial motives or fears of provoking more violence.
But her statements were harshly challenged on the spot by a standby juror -- the only alternate who did not take part in the deliberations -- who called the outcome "a sad day in America."

GOVERNING TORIES IN CANADA ROUTED BY LIBERAL PARTY
The Liberal Party, led by Jean Chretien, a Quebec lawyer and former Cabinet minister, steamrolled to victory in elections Monday that foreshadowed major changes in Canada's political landscape.
The Liberals swept Ontario and the eastern provinces, crushing the Progressive Conservatives, who have led the country for nine years.
A preliminary count gave the Liberals 177 seats in the House of Commons, a clear majority of the total of 295, to just 2 for the Conservatives, who had held the majority.


The Limelight Shifts to New York
This may be the time New York gets its act together.

The aim of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which arranged to hold the shows in the park, situated between 41st and 42d streets and from the Avenue of the Americas to the back of the New York Public Library, is to elevate the standing of American fashion.
Ultimately, the relevance of the clothes rather than the elegance of the space will make the difference.

G.M. Joins In Rising Auto Sales
Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America climbed 18.4 percent in mid-October, auto makers reported today, helped by a rebound for the General Motors Corporation from earlier production difficulties.
G.M. had contended for about a month that its relatively lackluster sales were a result of production slowdowns caused by problems with parts suppliers.
But because auto makers often blame everything but the quality of their cars and trucks for slack sales, some analysts had regarded G.M.'s excuse with skepticism -- until today.

Corner-Cutting Runner Is Still Declared Winner
DOMINIQUE BARIOD of France, the first-place finisher in the Marine Corps Marathon on Sunday, was declared the official winner yesterday of the Washington race despite "uncontested evidence" he veered off course.
Race officials said he did not gain an unfair advantage over any other runner.
Bariod, running in his second marathon and first in the United States, admitted cutting corners in at least three parts of the 26.2-mile course.
He finished in 2 hours 23 minutes 56 seconds -- 24 seconds ahead of ESTEBAN VANEGAS of Ecuador.
Race officials reviewed videotapes and photographs, conducted interviews and conferred with USA Track &amp; Field, the sport's national governing body.

Taylor and Hampton May Sit Out Game
There is sure to be a lot of talk this week about the Giants-Jets rivalry.
Rivalry?
What rivalry?
Maybe if Joe Namath were playing and the Jets had a winning record.
It is not that the 5-1 Giants are looking past the Jets, the best 2-4 team in the galaxy.
But this game is clearly more important to the Jets than it is to the Giants.
Perhaps that is why the Giants will probably hold out linebacker Lawrence Taylor and running back Rodney Hampton when the two teams meet on Sunday.
Rather than push them in a non-division game, the Giants can save them for a huge game the following week against the Dallas Cowboys.

Clans Clash in Somali Capital, Leaving 10 Dead and 45 Wounded
As feared, violence erupted today in the Somali capital as members of one clan-based faction prepared to march into territory controlled by that of another, provoking battles between fighters using automatic weapons, heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
The fighting, breaking a seven-month cease-fire between clans led by Gen.
Mohammed Farah Aidid and Mohammed Ali Mahdi, killed at least 10 Somalis and wounded at least 45, United Nations officials said.
As the various battles took place, American and United Nations troops kept a deliberate distance, although Pakistani peacekeepers fired warning shots as the fighting began and three United States Army Cobra AH-6 helicopters flew low over the most intense clash, dropping a tear-gas canister.

Holy Bull Produces Brilliant Encore
Maybe it was no fluke, after all.
The 2-year-old colt Holy Bull, who ended the winning streak of the superstar Dehere last month, rose to even greater heights on Saturday when he won the $400,000 Florida Stallion Stakes by 7 1/2 lengths.
No return match between the two juveniles will take place next week in the Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita because Holy Bull is spending the winter in Florida.
But they will begin a series of rematches early in the new year when they jostle for position as the two leading candidates on the road to the Kentucky Derby.
They have gone to the post a combined total of 10 times in their young careers, and the only time one of them lost was when Holy Bull outran Dehere by half a length in the mud in the Belmont Futurity on Sept. 18.

Giuliani Takes Message To Staten Island Voters
Returning to the borough that in 1989 gave him his largest margin of victory, Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday traversed Staten Island, delicately deflecting questions about just how he would deal with the secession movement if he is elected mayor and trying to impress upon the island's voters that regardless of the vote on that issue he would represent all five of the city's boroughs equally.
Trying to ride what is expected to be a larger than usual turnout driven by the passions over that vote -- yet careful not to alienate supporters with his open opposition to the secession movement -- Mr.
Giuliani criticized Mayor David N. Dinkins for having "horribly mishandled" the matter and vowed instead to give the island both his ear and his best efforts.

Perpetually teetering on the edge in Washington's annual budget battles, the superconducting supercollider had managed to survive one brush with death after another like an alley cat with extra spring in its legs.

New Contacts Between Jews And Muslims
After outlining the hopes of their communities on the stage of a Denver concert hall, the rabbi and the imam reached over and clasped hands warmly on Sunday.
With that, the audience of Jews and Muslims erupted in applause.
The mere act of shaking hands across the religious divide has taken on new significance since Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Yassir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization did that after the signing of the mutual recognition pact on the White House lawn on Sept. 13.


Review/Art; Trying to Balance the Art and the Architecture
Museums have art and they have real estate, and often they think the way to bring attention to the former is to make more of the latter.
At the Dallas Museum of Art, an institution with a good but not great collection, about $30 million has recently been spent on a 140,000-square-foot limestone addition, the Nancy and Jake L. Hamon Building, which opened last month with an overhaul of the way the museum displays its art.
The wing houses what the institution is calling its Museum of the Americas, covering 3,000 years of the art of the Western Hemisphere, from the ancient Americas through the early 20th century.

As clothes become less structured, so do handbags.
A stiff, boxlike bag just doesn't look right with a slouchy fluid jacket or tunic.

Saks Fifth Avenue has crushable nylon bags by Citysac for $100 to $200.
At Henri Bendel, the most popular bags are soft, slouchy drawstrings or, surprisingly, backpacks in smaller, lighter versions.
There are even mini-backpacks no more than six to eight inches long.
They are priced from about $100 to $150.

Dennis Russell Davies's work in New York almost always does, so it was paradox that the refreshment of Thursday's program (which will be repeated tonight) at the New York Philharmonic lay in a return to tradition.
In Beethoven's "Pastoral" Symphony, Mr.
Davies reminded listeners that classical style is founded on the dance.
Movement was buoyant and accents firm.
I found the "Country Gathering" uncomfortably fast and the finale's great wall of F-major climax more loud than triumphant, but everywhere, Mr.
Davies was reassuring us that his way with modern music grows from a solid grasp of the past.


2 Decades After Toxic Blast in Italy, Several Cancers Show Rise
ALMOST two decades after an explosion at a chemical factory released a toxic cloud of dioxin over northern Italy, a team of researchers has reported finding elevated rates of several types of cancer among area residents, but no overall increase in cancer.
The study, by Dr.
Pier Alberto Bertazzi of the University of Milan and five colleagues, was based on the medical records of more than 37,000 men and women living near Seveso, Italy, who were exposed to the highest concentrations of dioxin ever measured in a civilian population.

Dotting the I's and Crossing the T's
FEW companies dominate their product categories as the Hewlett-Packard Company has dominated laser printers.
And once again, Hewlett-Packard has introduced a laser printer that sets a new standard for print quality and features, this time for small-business and home office users.
The new HP Laserjet 4P ($1,229) and its Macintosh counterpart, the HP Laserjet 4MP ($1,729), which were introduced yesterday, are 600 d.p.i. printers, meaning they lay down 600 dots per inch both horizontally and vertically.


Ogilvy &amp; Mather Drops Shell as Client
Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide said yesterday that its Houston office had resigned a new credit card account from the Shell Oil Company, citing a conflict with American Express, a client of Ogilvy in New York.
Shell billings were estimated at $5 million to $10 million.
Mary Churchill, an Ogilvy spokeswoman in New York, confirmed a report of the resignation in Advertising Age this week.
She said that Promotional Campaigns Worldwide of London was opening an office in Houston to serve the account.
Promotional Campaigns, which, like Ogilvy, is owned by the WPP Group, works for Shell in seven other countries.

Qatar Cup Play Is Tough on Coaches
The day began with news that another head soccer coach -- Jose Candido of Saudi Arabia -- had made a premature exit from Doha.
It ended with victories from Japan and Iran that insured the two Asian spots in next year's World Cup finals would not be decided until the last round of matches here on Thursday.
Of the six teams in this qualifying tournament, only North Korea, a 2-1 loser to Iran tonight, has been eliminated.
Both Japan and Saudi Arabia, who have never reached the final phase before, will advance if they win on Thursday.
South Korea, Iraq and Iran need others to falter.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CO. (N)

The Hot Debate About Cloning Human Embryo
A day after the world learned that scientists at George Washington University Medical Center had cloned human embryos, ethicists and fertility specialists were already engaged in a vociferous debate yesterday.
While some ethicists foresee a nightmare scenario that should be stopped before it is started, others say, "Why not?" Some ethicists argue that peoples' embryos are their own and that if they want them cloned, it is not society's role to stop them.
Several ethicists said that rarely had they seen an issue so provocative and so divisive.


A Parched Town In a Water-Rich State; Distribution Woes Plague Greenwich
For all its woodsy wealth, its understated downtown of bistros and boutiques and its ability to calculate millionaires per square mile, this corner of Fairfield County has a very humbling and down-to-earth problem: water.
Greenwich, one of the wealthiest towns in the nation, and a paradise for sellers of estate-sized lawn-sprinkler systems, imposed mandatory bans on nonessential water use in late July.
It is the only community in the state aside from nearby Darien, which is served by the same water company, with water restrictions, and one of only a handful in the region, state officials said.


Newark Schools Report Counters State Findings
The Newark school system, under threat of a state takeover and reeling from months of public criticism, has prepared a rebuttal that deals point by point with the state's harsh assessment.
Newark's analysis is not required by the state, but school officials here see its value as a public relations tool and, possibly, as a way to persuade Trenton that its evaluation, issued in May, overlooked or misinterpreted data that proved the system was gaining ground, not falling farther behind.


Thais' Work in Libya Brings a U.S. Warning
The United States has warned Thailand that Thai companies are now the principal foreign contractors involved in the construction of chemical weapons plants in Libya, American and Thai officials say.
A Thai company has acknowledged that it designed and is overseeing construction of two large tunnels in Libya that are for use as "civilian bomb shelters" and that it has been asked to design three similar ones.
American officials say that the tunnels already under construction are being built for the production and storage of nerve gas and other chemical weapons.

The Golf and Tennis Caucus Gets Busy
Less than a week ago, the House seemed ready to take a modest but welcome step to free itself from the grasp of special interests.
A House Judiciary subcommittee was about to finish legislation setting a $20 limit on gifts from any one source, including meals.
Also on the table were the lobbyist-financed golf and tennis vacations to which many members are addicted, and a provision requiring full disclosure of all the financial benefits from lobbyists not barred by the bill.
Yet the House simply cannot let go of its consoling, corruptive ways.
Amid complaints from senior Democrats and Republicans, many of whom balked at the idea of having to give up their lobbyist-subsidized life styles, the subcommittee meeting was suddenly canceled.

Jordan's Role in Israeli-Palestinian Peace Effort; To Invigorate Economy
To the Editor:
The Clinton Administration and the international community have correctly recognized that rapid economic development in the West Bank and Gaza is critical to the success of any peace agreement.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, Israel, the United States and the West now share the common goals of economic stability and a rapid decrease in unemployment for the Palestinians.
To this end the United States is currently organizing donations from the OECD to a multibillion dollar investment fund for projects in the West Bank and Gaza.
Planning and implementation of investments will take time.
They cannot be expected to create new jobs immediately.
In the meantime, an additional, simple mechanism to aid the Palestinians would be a unilateral reduction of tariffs on exports from the West Bank and Gaza.


Vikings Intercept Bears at The Pass
Minnesota and Chicago played one of those forgetful games tonight where dropped balls and missed blocking assignments and close-to-the-vest play-calling made for a long, tedious affair.

Chicago slipped to a 3-3 record as its three-game winning streak ended.

School Evacuated in Fire
About 550 students and more than 150 school employees had to be evacuated from a Brooklyn elementary school yesterday afternoon when a small fire sent smoke through hallways and classrooms, fire officials said.
The fire, at Public School 106 in Bushwick, was confined to a closet in an empty fourth-floor classroom and was declared suspicious, said a Fire Department spokesman, Jerry Sanford.
Five adults suffered minor smoke inhalation during the fire, which began about 12:50 P.M. and was brought under control at 1:40 P.M., Mr.
Sanford said.
The school, at 1314 Putnam Avenue, is in the midst of an asbestos abatement program.

Met Opera Planning Summer Season In New Jersey in '96
The Metropolitan Opera has signed a letter of intent to make a planned $50 million theater at Waterloo Village in New Jersey its summer home beginning in 1996.
The New York Philharmonic and American Ballet Theater, which also have no permanent summer locations, confirmed yesterday they are also in discussions with officials at Waterloo Village.
The plans for the Metropolitan, the Philharmonic and Ballet Theater, which were reported on Sunday in The Star-Ledger, are all contingent on the completion of the theater, to be built about half a mile from Waterloo Village in Allamuchy Mountain State Park, a town restored as a historic village for tourists and arts patrons.

Though Sikh Rebellion Is Quelled, India's Punjab State Still Seethes
For a decade, the Indian state of Punjab has witnessed the most violent of India's many sectarian and ethnic conflicts, with a rebellion by Sikh separatists that led to the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and posed perhaps the most serious threat to Indian national unity.
But today, after the years of bloodshed in which thousands have been killed, the atmosphere has changed.
The anxiety of Punjabis is no longer driven by the Sikh rebels or gangs who have carried out killings in the past, but by the crackdown by the army and the police.


An Ad Campaign Says Two Terms Are Enough . . .
On the Nov. 2 ballot, New York City voters will decide whether to limit the mayor, Comptroller, Public Advocate, the borough presidents and city councilmen to two, four-year terms.
Supporters of term limits have begun an ad campaign.
SPONSOR: New Yorkers for Term Limits, paid for largely by Ronald S. Lauder, heir to the cosmetics company fortune of Estee Lauder.
ON THE SCREEN In quick succession, the camera zooms in on five characters in a setting suggestive of the City Council chambers.
They are comedic caricatures of political largess a fat, cigar-chomping pol, an old and frail council member asleep in a chair shrouded by cobwebs, a younger council member asleep with a newpaper drapped across his chest, a woman cutting a paper chain of dollar signs and a member of the council who appears so bored that he is cleaning his teeth.
Then, the scene changes to the New York City skyline, with the sun rising in the background.
The remaining text of the ad, urging people to vote for term limits, scrolls across the screen.


Getting Your Feet Wet In a Sea Called Internet
"THE government always discovers a technology after its moment is passing," the economist and author George Gilder says in an interview in the September/October issue of Wired.
"It's not going to change with Clinton and Gore. The dog technologies run to Washington, decked out like poodles. The politician is always the dog's best friend."
One of the technologies Vice President Al Gore is pushing is the information superhighway, which will link everyone at home or office to everything else -- movies and television shows, shopping services, electronic mail and huge collections of data -- starting perhaps with the elaborate structure envisioned by Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications.
But the Internet, already linking 10 million to 15 million people in a version of the data superhighway (albeit without movies and shopping), shows, in Mr.
Gilder's words, that "to have a very rich fabric of services you don't need a regimented system of control."

Opening of New Denver Airport Is Delayed Again
The opening of the new $2.8 billion Denver International Airport has been pushed back again, to March, Mayor Wellington Webb announced today.
The delay will add millions to the cost of a project that is already more than $1.1 billion over initial projections.

The Red Wings had filled the 19,275 seats at Joe Louis Arena for every game since late in the 1989-90 season.
The Red Wings outshot Dallas, 24-13, but allowed the Stars several uncontested short-range goals, scoring four times against Vincent Riendeau on eight shots and forcing him to the bench in the second period.

Vincent Price, a Suave but Menacing Film Presence, Is Dead at 82
Vincent Price, the suavely menacing star of countless low-budget but often stylish Gothic horror films, died at his home in Los Angeles yesterday.
He was 82 years old and died of lung cancer, a personal assistant, Reggie Williams, told the Associated Press.
The flamboyant 6-foot-4-inch actor with a silken voice and mocking air helped start a major revival of science-fiction films in 1953 with his portrayal of a cruelly scarred sculptor in "The House of Wax." He went on to play a succession of macabre characters in the director Roger Corman's film adaptations of stories by Edgar Allan Poe, including "Pit and the Pendulum" and "Masque of the Red Death."


How 5-Year-Old Boy Survived 7-Story Fall Baffles Medical Experts

Paul Rosen remained in critical but stable condition at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center yesterday evening, a day after he fell from a bedroom window in his parents' East 79th Street apartment to a concrete courtyard, hospital officials said.

On My Mind; On Civil Respect
In the end, the mayoralty election in New York City will depend on how many New Yorkers vote for civil respect as their first priority.
Civil respect is based on civil liberty.

Easing these problems depends on the government's respect for the citizens and the citizens' respect for each other -- voluntary or imposed.


Lemaire Succeeding as Private Man in a Public Arena
The coach likes to teach his sport to his players, but he doesn't appreciate the skeptical attention of the news media and he doesn't seek the fickle approval of the fans.
So where does he go to pursue his career?
For Jacques Lemaire, the choice was metropolitan New York City, media capital of the world and the most populous urban center in North America.
It might seem an odd choice.
But for someone from the hockey hothouse of Montreal, where Lemaire grew up, played at a Hall of Fame level and later coached, it made perfect sense.

SWING VOTE SEEMS TO DRIFT TO MAYOR, BUT POLL IS CLOSE
Hispanic New Yorkers, women and other vital swing voters appear to have drifted back toward Mayor David N.

Announcing what it believes could be a step toward developing a vaccine against the AIDS virus, France's prestigious Pasteur Institute said today that its researchers had identified a new receptor molecule that helps the virus to invade a human blood cell.
The institute said that if the activity of this receptor molecule could be inhibited, cells might be protected from attack by the virus.
It added that the receptor, labeled CD26, seemed to play the same role with different strains of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.


Bozeman Makes Point, but Then Only to a Point
Todd Bozeman, head basketball coach at the University of California, supports the Black Coaches Association's cause.
But he insists he is not trying to prove anything to anybody.
"I'm not the spokesman," he said yesterday.
"I support the issues, but my greatest concern is for the kids."


Lamont Trumps Showalter
Gene Lamont, whose Chicago White Sox won their first Western Division title in 10 years, was voted American League Manager of the Year yesterday, beating out Buck Showalter, who finished second, just like his Yankees did in the Eastern Division.
In balloting by the Baseball Writers Association of America, Lamont defeated Showalter, 72 points to 63.
The voting was based on 5 points for first place, 3 for second and 1 for third.
Lamont received 8 first-place votes, 9 second-place votes and 5 third-place votes.
Showalter had 7 first-place votes, 8 seconds and 4 thirds.


World Series Provided Viewers With the Best Late Show of All
Stop with the television ratings already.
Quit telling us that World Series ratings are down and that fewer people are watching the games.
Instead, tell the people who aren't watching that they're missing terrific entertainment.
While they're watching yet another sitcom or an old movie, they're missing great theater, not to mention glorious games.
Sure, the ratings are significant because they are the basis for the prices advertisers pay for commercial time, and that revenue will determine how much the clubs get when they go into the television advertising business next year.
But the games are the product, not commercials, and this year's World Series had more terrific games than all of the Roman numeral Super Bowls combined.


In a Gritty Town, Hope Outlives the Prosperity
Against all odds, pine trees have taken root on the black mountain of coal mining waste that looms above this small city in central Pennsylvania.
The people of Shamokin have also put down deep roots, holding fast to a bleak place despite a harsh economic climate.
It is a triumph of time over adversity.
By objective measures, Shamokin (pronounced shuh-MO-kin) is a dying town.
The coal and textile industries folded up years ago, unemployment rose, and most of the young people fled.


The Family Farm Doesn't Exist Anymore
To the Editor:
After you exposed the economic and political incestuous relationship between the United States Department of Agriculture and corporate agribusiness, which has been destroying our family farm system of agriculture for decades ("Tainted Trade," front-page series, Oct. 10-12), one would have hoped for a more enlightened followup analysis in "The Politics of Food" (editorial, Oct. 16).


Jets Against the Giants: Hype Is Being Put on Hold
It was only a month ago that the Halloween date between the Jets and Giants held out the promise of a titanic clash.
The Giants were 3-0 and had regained their footing in the National Football Conference East Division.
The Jets were 2-1 and appeared on their way to a resurgence in the American Conference East.
But as the season has unfolded the two teams have gone in different directions -- the Giants are 5-1 and atop the N.F.C.
East and the Jets are 2-4 and at the bottom of the A.F.C.
East -- and Sunday's game at Giants Stadium not only lacks the expected drama but carries a different kind of urgency for the Jets and their coach, Bruce Coslet.


Ukraine's Wasting Nuclear Asset
It's two down and one to go among the republics that inherited nuclear arms when the Soviet Union broke up.
Kazakhstan is about to follow Belarus's lead and get rid of its nuclear legacy.
That leaves a lone holdout: stubborn Ukraine.
Ukraine has turned its tactical nuclear arms over to Russia for dismantling.
And it's removing the warheads from aging SS-19 missiles.
But President Leonid Kravchuk, who last year pledged to give up all of Ukraine's arms, now wants to keep some.
The ones he has in mind, 46 intercontinental-range SS-24 missiles, were designed to target the U.S., and fly too far to strike most of Russia.

Review/Television; Shoe Pinches Other Foot In a Series
How's this for a quandary?
Your dearest friend has just moved into the White House, and here you are writing and producing a weekly series poking fun at politicians and other assorted nitwits on the Washington power circuit.
What to do?
Well, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason, top-of-the-list F.O.B.'s, don't fool around.
Their "Hearts Afire" show, shifted by CBS from Mondays to Wednesdays, has been yanked out of its now awkward Washington setting and plunked down in a small town in Middle America.
The state is not identified, but Bubbas in good standing can cast a knowing wink in the direction of Arkansas.
Tonight's special hourlong season premiere at 8 (the regular time will be 8:30) wastes no time in fleeing the District of Columbia.
John Hartman (John Ritter) and family are already on the road in a rickety van heading for the town where he grew up.
He talks rhapsodically of common sense, decency and family values.
He will soon know better.
His new wife, Georgie (Markie Post), a Peabody Award-winning journalist, warily wonders if she's going to fit in on John's version of Walton Mountain.
His two young sons from an earlier marriage are making no firm commitments.

Process of Linking Blast Debris Begins
In a turning point in the World Trade Center bombing case, prosecutors began presenting evidence yesterday in their effort to link the four men on trial with the many bits of twisted metal that has been brought before the jury over the last two weeks.
At the end of the afternoon session, a New York City police detective, Edward Mason, who identified himself as a fingerprint specialist, told how he had taken imprints of a serial number embedded in a five-foot-long piece of metal frame that was recovered from the explosion.


Judge Bars 10 From Plumbers Union Activity
In an unusual action, a state judge temporarily barred 10 current and former leaders of a New York City plumbers union yesterday who have been indicted on extortion charges from running the union.
Acting Justice Joan B. Carey of Manhattan State Supreme Court disqualified the officials from participating in union business or activities pending a ruling on a motion by Manhattan prosecutors for the appointment of a trustee to oversee the union, Local 2 of the Plumbers Union.

Electric Rates To Be Frozen By Authority
The New York State Power Authority, trying to repair its tattered public image and fight off competition from independent energy suppliers, said yesterday that it would freeze electricity rates for the next three years for its government customers in New York City and Westchester County, which could save them as much as $110 million.
The freeze would hold down electricity rates for New York City, the city's subways, suburban commuter rail systems and a number of other government agencies.
The action would reduce their bills by roughly 4.5 percent, compared with the increases the Power Authority had previously projected.
But some local officials said they did not anticipate that their savings would be as large as the authority announced.

Jets Against the Giants: Big Names, Big Games
The Jets and Giants have met so rarely, only six times since 1970, that their matchups are more a novelty than a rivalry.
Their seventh regular-season clash comes Sunday: The Giants, 5-1 and atop the National Football Conference East, are trying to return to the glory of just a few seasons ago.
The Jets?
They have lost three straight, their record has dropped to 2-4 and they need this game to begin to salvage the season.
Despite only a half-dozen confrontations, the teams have created an anthology of memories and names: The Sack Exchange, Joe Namath, Craig Morton, Al Woodall, Ray Perkins, Fran Tarkenton, Joe Walton, Pete Gogolak.
And the rare meetings have defined the teams' seasons and hinted at their futures.

Paramount Plans a TV Network
Paramount Communications Inc. announced yesterday that it would join forces with Chris-Craft Industries to start a fifth national television network.

Still, Martin S. Davis, Paramount's chairman, said the proposed network had already been approved by Viacom, Paramount's favored merger partner.

U.S. CANCELS A PLAN TO BEGIN SANCTIONS AFTER JAPAN ACTS
The Clinton Administration today canceled plans to impose trade sanctions next Monday against Japan after Tokyo agreed to open its public sector construction market to international competition.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, announced this morning that the Administration would not proceed with the sanctions, at least for now, because the Japanese Government had promised to eliminate the practice of restricting the bidding on construction contracts to a few companies.
The sanctions would have barred Japanese companies from bidding on some Federal construction projects.

Craig knows plenty about getting into the end zone.
In 11 pro seasons he has been there 81 times, 63 on the ground and 18 through the air.


Man in the News; Canadian With Mandate: Joseph Jacques Jean Chretien
The Conservative Party derided him as "yesterday's man" because he faithfully served Prime Ministers Lester B. Pearson, Pierre Elliott Trudeau and John N. Turner.
But by placing today's problems in the hands of Jean Chretien, who will become the country's next Prime Minister, Canada's voters said experience must count for something.
Among the nation's problems are getting people back to work, adjusting trade relationships and preserving national unity.


Pulse of Campaign: Dinkins the Survivor and Giuliani the Striver
Not so many weeks ago, the received wisdom among New York politicians was that Mayor David N. Dinkins would be on the floor by now and that Rudolph W. Giuliani would be measuring the drapes at City Hall -- and both may well prove true after next Tuesday's election, which all the polls suggest remains too close to call.
But for the moment, Mr.
Dinkins is still standing and Mr.
Giuliani still apparently striving to clinch his sale.
That is an obvious testament to a month of relentless and often hyperbolic televised attacks by the Mayor painting his challenger as a big, bad Republican.
It may also be the unintended consequence of Mr.
Giuliani's pointed counterpunches condemning the Mayor for a range of lapses dating back to his failure to file income-tax returns two decades ago.

Vincent Price, Noted Actor Of Dark Roles, Dies at 82
Vincent Price, the suavely menacing star of countless low-budget but often stylish Gothic horror films, died at his home in Los Angeles on Monday.
He was 82 years old and died of lung cancer, a personal assistant, Reggie Williams, said.
The flamboyant 6-foot-4-inch actor with a silken voice and mocking air helped start a major revival of horror films in 1953 with his portrayal of a cruelly scarred sculptor in "The House of Wax." He went on to play a succession of macabre characters in the director Roger Corman's film adaptations of stories by Edgar Allan Poe, including "Pit and the Pendulum" and "Masque of the Red Death."


Blackman Is Battling For Role In Reserve
Ask Rolando Blackman how he feels about his game right now and an honest answer is forthcoming.
"There's a lot of frustration, I can tell you that," Blackman said after today's Knick practice.

Make His Day? The Modern Does Just That for Eastwood the Director
One night long ago, 17-year-old Clint Eastwood and his friends traveled from Oakland to Los Angeles to hear a jazz concert.
Along the way, they happened to see horses running wild near Sunset Boulevard.
So they helped corral the horses for the animals' owner, who thanked them and went home.
Too bad: that was Mr.
Eastwood's only meeting with Howard Hawks, one of the directors he most admires.
He cites Mr.
Hawks, along with John Ford and Anthony Mann, as an influence on his own career.
It's a long way -- and a lot of horses -- from the corner of Sunset and Sepulveda Boulevards to the Museum of Modern Art, where Mr.
Eastwood's own directorial work will be the subject of a gala tribute tonight. (In past years, similar events have honored Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck and David Niven.)


Heat Fines Bol
The Miami Heat fined center MANUTE BOL $25,000 for missing two exhibition games to attend meetings in Washington concerning the civil war in his native Sudan.
The money will be donated to a Sudanese relief fund.
Heat officials didn't know where Bol was until he returned to practice Monday.
"The mistake I made was I didn't call, but I didn't think they would fine me that money -- $25,000," said the 7-foot-7-inch Bol, a nine-year pro who is in his first season with the Heat and has a $650,000 contract.

ALL too often, women who complain of chronic debilitating symptoms for which doctors can find no physical cause or cure are dismissed as crackpots or hypochondriacs and are shunted off to psychotherapists for treatment of ailments assumed to be emotionally based.
Such has been the fate of thousands of women suffering from a miserably painful and debilitating disorder involving a part of their bodies that many hesitate to discuss even with their doctors.
That part is the vulva, the tissue that surrounds the opening to a woman's vagina and urethra, and the disorder is called vulvodynia.

A Bizarre Drug Tested in the Hope of Helping Drug Addicts
DRIVEN by a deep sense of frustration that efforts to cure drug addiction are going nowhere, Federal researchers are testing a bizarre, mind- altering drug called ibogaine as a possible new treatment for cocaine and heroin addiction.
The drug, drawn from the roots of a West African shrub, has been tried on only 60 people.
But several doctors and patients say that the compound works wonders, often banishing symptoms of withdrawal and craving for months if not years.
Intrigued and at the same time skeptical, researchers have decided to see if the drug works as well as its supporters claim.

A Surprise Closing Takes More Luster Off Broadway Season
The fall Broadway season absorbed another blow yesterday when the producers of "Wonderful Tennessee," the Brian Friel play that opened three days ago, announced that the show would close on Sunday, after just 9 performances and 20 previews.
The play, about three middle-aged Irish couples who spend a night on a Donegal pier waiting for a boatman, drinking and philosophizing, received respectful but disappointing reviews.
The news of the play's closing is the strongest tremor among many that have shaken the confidence of Broadway professionals in what had appeared to be the first promising autumn in many years.

'Anything Goes' Houston May Go the Limit: Zoning
In many American cities, the mental image of the landscape is set by something the city has.
Seattle has the Space Needle, St.
Louis has the Gateway Arch.
Here in Houston, though, even with its famed Astrodome, the urban geography has long been noted for what this city does not have: any zoning regulations whatsoever.
But now Houston, the only major American city without a zoning code, is on the verge of determining whether the time has finally come to impose zoning and, perhaps, inject some modicum of order to the helter-skelter, hodgepodge way that the nation's fourth largest city has evolved and even now continues to grow.

There were so many journalists at a party for ELLEN GOODMAN, the Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist for The Boston Globe, on Monday evening that EDWIN DIAMOND, New York magazine's media critic, was moved to remark, "This is the way to have a party: a bunch of journalists standing around and talking in a bar."
At the party, given by Ms.
Goodman's longtime friend LYNN SHERR, a correspondent for the ABC News program "20/20," guests like Mike Wallace, John Chancellor, Lesley Stahl, Mort Zuckerman, Diane Sawyer, Robert Caro, Judge Kimba M.

The book, "Value Judgments," is being published this week by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.


RJR NABISCO HOLDINGS CORP. (N)
Intense competition in premium cigarettes continued to hold down earnings at the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation.
The company announced yesterday that net income for the third quarter fell 58.2 percent.
The company's tobacco division is battling other companies amid lower prices for premium brands and higher prices for private-label brands.
A 63.7 percent decline, to $201 million, in net income from domestic sales more than offset a 13.8 percent increase in net income from international tobacco sales, to $181 million.

Acknowledging what has seemed evident to outsiders since riots prompted the White House to recall an American troopship earlier this month, Washington insiders agreed today that Father Aristide would have to wait some more.

Massive Cabdriver Protest Of 35 Killings Snarls Traffic
Thousands of cabdrivers, angered and frightened by the seemingly unceasing string of killings and violent crimes against New York taxi drivers, formed a massive caravan and staged a mobile demonstration in Manhattan yesterday, bringing traffic to a standstill and creating chaos on several midtown blocks during the early evening rush hour.
The protest route started at Fourth Street and stretched up West Street before heading toward Times Square and south again on Broadway for a rally at City Hall.
Along the way, the drivers -- primarily yellow cabdrivers -- tied up intersections and frustrated commuters.
At some points, drivers abandoned their vehicles, to chant slogans and sit in the street during the protest that began at about 2 P.M. and trailed off about 7 P.M.


Police, Not Troops, in Washington
Bill Clinton was right to reject Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's request for the power to call out the National Guard in Washington D.C., to cope with the District's soaring murder rate.
Congress, which is considering the option, would be wise to follow the President's example.
The National Guard is trained to keep order in short-term emergencies -- including natural disasters like hurricanes and man-made disasters like riots.
It is not trained for long-term law enforcement.
Deploying the Guard in Washington would invite other crime-ridden cities to do the same.
Eventually, calling out the Guard would become a refuge for elected officials seeking to evade accountability for failed criminal justice policies.


I.B.M. Quarterly Loss Smaller Than Expected

Mr.
Gerstner pointed to "encouraging signs," including revenues that held up better than analysts expected, further progress in cost-cutting programs and a steadying of gross profit margins.

An autopsy report released today says that the use of pepper spray contributed to the death of a Mount Vernon man two weeks ago as he was being subdued by the police, but the man's heart trouble and intoxication were given more prominent blame.
Because of those other factors and the absence of evidence of excessive force, the Westchester County District Attorney's office said it had cleared four police officers of any "criminality" in their efforts to restrain the 34-year-old man, Lester Steven Yarborough.

PRESIDENT TO LIMIT FEDERAL SUBSIDIES IN HEALTH PROGRAM
To control the cost of his proposal for universal health insurance coverage, President Clinton has modified it to limit Federal spending on subsidies for low-income workers, small businesses and early retirees, Administration officials and Congressional aides said today.
The proposal, one of dozens of adjustments to the health care plan, which Mr.
Clinton intends to submit to Congress on Wednesday, seeks to balance two conflicting imperatives.
On the one hand, the President is telling Americans, as he said last month, that they have a right to "health security -- health care that can never be taken away, health care that is always there." Curbing Runaway Costs
On the other hand, he and his budget director, Leon E. Panetta, say they do not want to create a new entitlement to benefits that would impose open-ended costs on the Federal Government far into the future.

Of course, they feel that way for their alleged home games, too.

They show up for home games and they look up at the stadium and what does it say?

Managing Award Caps Baker's Rookie Season
Hours after a second member of his starting infield declared himself a free agent, the news took a turn for the better for Dusty Baker yesterday.
The Baseball Writers Association of America announced that Baker, rookie manager of the San Francisco Giants, had been voted National League manager of the year in his first year as a manager in the major leagues.
The 44-year-old Baker, who led the Giants to their most victories (103) since 1962, received 15 of the 28 first-place votes in balloting by two writers from each National League city.
That was four more than Jim Fregosi of the N.L.

They have become known as the Recession Governors, the executives of big industrial states who inherited budgets and payrolls that were bloated by the boom years of the 1980's and revenues that are starved by the lean times that came with the 1990's.
And the first among them in office, and the first to face a review by the voters, is Jim Florio of New Jersey,
"We were first across the barbed wire," the Governor said recently, choosing a grim simile of trench warfare, to describe the politics of governing in a recession.

METRO DIGEST  NEW YORK CITY  CONTENTS OF BOMB PLOT TAPES REVEALED
The informer at the center of the Government's case in the plot to bomb New York City landmarks had a volatile relationship with his handlers, often quarreling with F.B.I. agents who used him to infiltrate a group of Muslims now charged in the plot, according to transcripts of secretly taped conversations.
Transcripts of the hundreds of hours of tapes, which were recorded without the knowledge of the F.B.I., were distributed to defense lawyers.

Stocks Stumble in Erratic Trading Session
A day after blue-chip issues roared to new highs, the stock market stumbled through an erratic session yesterday that seemed to raise a question among some analysts: Why can't investors sustain a lengthy autumn rally?
To Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Company, the declines in most stock indicators yesterday may point to renewed anxiety about the health of the economy and the strength of corporate profits.
After weeks of setting records, Wall Street may be running out of gas, he said.


Auburn Punt Issue Becomes Bag of Hot Air
Auburn punter TERRY DANIEL's season has been a gas, but not because he filled the ball with helium.
Daniel, who leads the nation with a 48.3-yard average, was cleared of any wrongdoing after the Southeastern Conference checked for helium in the footballs he was kicking.
"I heard the ball had been sent to Birmingham to test the contents of it," the junior punter said.
"I couldn't believe it. It was just a 10-mile-an-hour wind. If you hit the ball decent, it should go that far."

The telephone industry, in its fever pitch to build the information superhighway, is hoping to get more mileage from the phone itself.
Today, U S Order of Herndon, Va., in partnership with companies including the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Knight-Ridder Inc., is introducing a telephone intended to let consumers bank and shop from home.
It is a desktop set with a miniature screen, whose controls resemble those of a bank automated teller machine.

U.S. Says Chretien Will Not Undo Nafta
President Clinton and his aides said today that they did not expect that the Liberal Party's victory in Canadian elections would hurt the prospects for approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement or lead to renegotiation of the pact.
"From my point of view, it will have no impact at all," President Clinton said this morning, discounting the Liberal Party's platform plank that called for renegotiation of the accord.
"I see no reason to renegotiate the agreement or any grounds or basis for it, and I think we should just go ahead."

Bell Atlantic Promises $15 Billion for Advanced Networks
Seeking to defuse political opposition to his company's proposed takeover of Tele-Communications Inc., the chairman of the Bell Atlantic Corporation pledged today to spend at least $15 billion over the next five years on advanced communication networks if the deal goes through.
The pledge, made by Raymond W. Smith in a meeting with several reporters, is the biggest and most explicit financial commitment yet by a company to build the vaunted electronic highways that are to provide hundreds of channels of television as well as voice and data communications.


Medical Schools Alerted About Intern With a Prison Record
Officials of the University Hospital here are warning medical schools and teaching hospitals nationwide to be on the watch for an intern they dismissed this month after learning that he had served two years in prison for feeding ant poison to six paramedics in Illinois in 1985.
The 39-year-old intern, Michael Swango, a 1983 graduate of Southern Illinois University's medical school, lied in his application to Stony Brook, failing to disclose the time he spent in prison, said Dr.
Jordan J. Cohen, dean of the School of Medicine at the State University here.

I LEARNED about turkey before World War II, shortly after arriving in this country.
In France we had turkey, but it was largely a curiosity that was served on special occasions.
Even today it is not wildly popular.
It was sure popular in the United States Army, where I discovered every permutation of turkey, including some versions I haven't seen since.
Turkey was cheap, ample and versatile.
In recent years, health concerns have given turkey meat a new popularity as a substitute for veal, chicken and even beef in certain dishes.


Market Place; Morton Swirsky, financial officer, meet Morton Swirsky, the felon.
DUE diligence is one of those five-dollar Wall Street phrases that roughly translates to "we looked at this real hard." So, investors would think that with all the lawyers and investment bankers charged with doing just that for a public offering, someone would know whether or not an officer of a company is a convicted felon.
Not so with Hillside Bedding.
A purveyor of mattresses in the New York area, the company went public early this year with a senior management team that included Morton Swirsky, its chief financial officer and a director.
In the February prospectus, Mr.
Swirsky was described as a 50-year-old man who had spent much of his career with a kitchen-equipment maker.
Before that, it said, he was an accountant and had received a law degree from New York University.

National Health Labs Drops Tests After Medicare Dispute
National Health Laboratories Inc., which last year pleaded guilty to submitting false claims to the Government for unnecessary blood tests, said late Monday that it would remove two tests from its basic blood screen after Medicare carriers refused to pay for them.
The move, which the company said would result in substantially lower revenue and income, depressed National Health's shares, which lost $2.375 each today, closing at $13.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
National Health of San Diego was the Big Board's leading loser for the day, declining 15.3 percent in value.


The Endless War
Bloody upheavals in Moscow and the Republic of Georgia have given outsiders a new appreciation of the lethal forces at play in the struggle to redefine the former Soviet Union.
But such insights scarcely qualify as news for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, where thousands have died in fighting since Soviet rule there began to collapse in 1988.
Pitting a defiant Armenian enclave against ethnically Turkish Azerbaijan, which surrounds it, the Nagorno-Karabakh war has the tragic distinction of being the former Soviet Union's most prolonged and deadly internal dispute.
It has devastated major cities and displaced 500,000 people in a humanitarian disaster affecting Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey, Iran and Georgia.

Ex-Official Is Convicted In HUD Scandal of 80's
The executive assistant to former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., who found herself at the center of the influence-peddling scandal during the Reagan Administration, was convicted today of 12 felony counts of defrauding the Government, taking a bribe and lying to Congress.
For each of the 11 felony counts on which she was convicted, the aide, Deborah Gore Dean, faces a possible sentence of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
For a 12th count, receiving an illegal gratuity, Ms.
Dean faces a possible jail sentence of up to two years and a fine of up to $250,000.


Ranks of Forest Service Upset Over Choice for Leader
The Clinton Administration has stirred broad resentment in the ranks of the National Forest Service with a plan to name a political appointee, rather than a career forest manager, to head the agency, which is embroiled in politically sensitive disputes over the use of public woodlands.
Jack Ward Thomas, the government scientist favored for the job by the Agriculture Department, which manages the agency, has been with the forest service for 27 years.
But he is not among the ranks of senior managers from which the appointment would usually be drawn, and therefore would have to be promoted as a political appointee.

2 Gang Leaders in Sarajevo Face Crackdown in Bosnia
After months of growing lawlessness and black-marketeering that had eroded morale here almost as much as Serbian bombardments, the Bosnian Government began a crackdown today on two reputed gangsters within its own armed forces, laying siege to their headquarters.
The operation paralyzed the city.
As the Government broadcast stay-at-home appeals to the city's population, now estimated by the United Nations at about 300,000, the two factions -- Government loyalists and supporters of the two renegade army commanders -- exchanged automatic rifle and mortar fire in crowded neighborhoods.


Redrawing the Map in Canada
The Liberal Party landslide in the Canadian elections was more like an avalanche.
The Progressive Conservatives, who ruled for the past nine years, took the worst pasting ever for a governing party; they lost 151 seats and will have only 2 in the new Parliament.
Meanwhile, two new regional parties scored huge gains.
It's a new political era for America's biggest trading partner and closest ally.
Jean Chretien, the Liberals' leader who now becomes prime minister, is a career politician, well known by his service in nine cabinet posts and comfortably familiar to the hierarchy of U.S. power and politics.
He's no Pierre Trudeau -- the last Liberal Prime Minister, outspoken and flamboyant.
But like Mr.
Trudeau, he hails from Quebec and is firmly opposed to Quebec separatism.

Excluding the effects of inventory adjustments and a one-time charge, operating income for the Pittsburgh-based company was $131 million, up $72 million from the third quarter last year.

A Blast From the Past
Its era has long since passed, but somewhere along the way "The Anarchist Cookbook," a step-by-step guide to making bombs at home that was written in the heat of the social upheaval of the early 1970's, became a cult classic.
Like the film "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," the "Cookbook" still has a healthy following and still sells steadily, mostly to college students and others longing for a bygone counterculture.
The book has recently passed a milestone, one all the more momentous when you consider that it took place in the relatively lawful 1990's.
Two weeks ago, its two-millionth copy was sold.

The National Association of Securities Dealers reported yesterday that a record 661.1 million shares of companies traded on Nasdaq had been borrowed and sold short as of Oct. 7, up 7 percent from the 618.1 million shares recorded a month earlier.
The figure was 43 percent higher than in October 1992.


Calm Over Trade Pact's Prospects
The victory of the Liberal Party in Canada's election on Monday has again put the spotlight on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The next Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, has said he wants to renegotiate the agreement to protect some Canadian exporters.
The possible objections from Canada provide an opportunity to ask what will happen in the bond market if the United States Congress rejects the agreement with Mexico.
A leading opponent of the agreement, David E. Bonior, a Democrat of Michigan, said yesterday that just 10 more votes were needed to get the 218 votes to defeat the trade pact.
Congress is scheduled to vote on it on Nov. 17.

The agreement covers medical and surgical supplies, heart and lung devices, and diagnostic instruments and chemicals, among other Baxter products.

The Ameritech Corporation, the Midwest regional Baby Bell telephone company, said yesterday that it had selected Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis to handle its corporate advertising account.
Billings were estimated at $5 million to $10 million, but the company said that it was looking to increase spending to between $15 million to $20 million.
The account had been at Bayer Bess Vanderwarker in Chicago for the last five years until that agency was dismissed in July.
Steve Ford, an Ameritech spokesman in Chicago, said that Fallon was awarded the account after a two-month review that also included Cramer-Krasselt in Milwaukee, DDB Needham Chicago, Tatham Euro RSCG in Chicago and Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore.

In the third major blow in three weeks, Lintas New York yesterday was dismissed by Molson Breweries U.S.A., which moved its beer brands account to Young &amp; Rubicam Chicago.

Molson began a review of its account in June, two months after the Miller Brewing Company acquired American marketing and distribution rights for the Molson and Foster's brands from the Molson Companies in Montreal; the Foster's brands continue to be handled by Riney, Angotti, Hedge in New York.


Challenge Within a Single Wire
In the public policy debate over the proposed merger of Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications, the deal's proponents argue that the combined entity will provide robust new competition in communications markets outside Bell Atlantic's home region.

Mogadishu Tense as Rival Clan Fighting Subsides
Fierce fighting between rival clans subsided this evening, but the Somali capital remained tense after 30 hours of violence that reflected a new willingness by peacekeeping forces to let civil unrest in Somalia run its course.
The episode, in which at least 17 Somalis were killed, made clear just how limited a role the United States intends to play here before withdrawing its troops on March 31.
But it also raised questions about the usefulness of the American military mission.

New York City's reservoir levels are below 50 percent and below average for this time of year.
Yet early every morning millions of gallons of water are wasted as city sidewalks are hosed down by porters in front of co-ops, condominiums and storefronts.

A decade later, Mexico is nearing the end of one of the most sweeping sales of state companies in the world.
In all, the Government has sold or dissolved more than 80 percent of the 1,155 businesses it once ran.

The Mets completed the easiest stage of their colossal rebuilding task with the announcement yesterday of their reworked coaching staff.

Conciliatory Giuliani Asks City to 'Come Together'
Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday struck a chord of conciliation, cooperation and hope.
Moving away from the bitterness and vituperation that have dominated the mayoral race for months, he urged New Yorkers to "come together," to cast aside blind party loyalties, racial and ethnic stereotypes and labels of all kinds to usher in a "new era" in New York City politics.
"We don't want anybody to vote because of racial pride or ethnic pride or religious pride," he said.
"A long time ago we decided we want people's votes because they agree that we can do a better job."


Puerto Rico Takes Lead With School Vouchers, And Feels the Arrows
As the rest of the nation continues to debate using school vouchers, Puerto Rico is plunging ahead with a month-old experimental voucher program that has already provoked threats of an islandwide teachers' strike as early as next week.
The legislation, passed on Sept. 3, is intended to "expand the options of parents and students with regard to the selection of schools," said Education Secretary Jose Arsenio Torres, and to "offer economic incentives to public schools to improve their course offerings."

For the Poll Watcher, How to Sift Results
According to the three latest polls David N. Dinkins: a) leads Rudolph W. Giuliani in the contest for mayor by 9 percentage points, or b) holds only the most tenuous lead of 6 points, a statistical tie, or c) is behind Mr. Giuliani by 3 percentage points, also a statistical tossup.
You can take your pick.

"But it's still a lot of work."

CHRONICLE
MARIAN WRIGHT EDELMAN, founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund, could hardly have found a more articulate ally for her cause than Attorney General JANET RENO.
The two women came to town yesterday for a luncheon given by ANNE SUTHERLAND FUCHS, publisher of Vogue magazine, to acquaint the worlds of fashion, retailing and society with the Children's Defense Fund.
Mrs.
Edelman introduced the Attorney General to the crowd at the National Academy of Design in Manhattan by reeling off a list of statistics about the various ways children's lives are damaged: by abuse, neglect, dropping out, teen-age pregnancy, drugs, alcoholism and gun use.
"I can't tell you what it means to have an attorney general who's a big, big children's advocate," Mrs.
Edelman said.


New Polish Premier Assumes His Office; Walesa Has Doubts
With a warning from President Lech Walesa not to squander the past four years of movement toward a market economy, Poland's new Prime Minister, the leader of a former Communist party, was sworn in today along with a 20-member Cabinet.
The new Prime Minister, Waldemar Pawlak, 34, who was described recently by Mr.
Walesa as not being up to the job, responded to the President's admonition by saying his Government would contribute to the "growth trend."


Panel to Hear Findings on Pratt &amp; Whitney
Congressional aides said today that they would present evidence on Wednesday that the Pratt &amp; Whitney division of the United Technologies Corporation knowingly participated in a kickback scheme to sell jet engines and computer software to Israel.
An investigation by the General Accounting Office has found that from 1986 to 1991 officials of Pratt &amp; Whitney and the Israeli Ministry of Defense "facilitated" the diversion of $12.5 million of United States military funds through an overpricing scheme, the aides said.


Two Charged With Burying Newborn Alive
Two months after Urbelina Emiliano told her new husband that she was pregnant with another man's child, the couple took the newborn girl and buried her alive in a hole in their backyard, the Nassau County police said today.
Ms.
Emiliano, 23, and her husband, Fortino Perez, 28, both of Hempstead, were arraigned this afternoon on charges of second-degree murder, after the police exhumed an infant's body outside the couple's former home.
They are being held without bail.


Books of The Times; The Minstrel Tradition: Not Just a Racist Relic
Love and Theft  Blackface Minstrelsy and The American Working Class  By Eric Lott  314 pages.
Oxford University Press. $24.95.
Of course the recent blackface colboration between Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg at the Friars Club knocked Somalia off the front page: culture wars on the home front leave no civilians untouched.
Entertainment and politics are both about power, and entertainment is a lot more fun.
All of which is at the heart of Eric Lott's terrifically smart and unexpectedly timely study of blackface minstrelsy.
Rightly, he sees it as a crucial source for, and form of, popular culture.
It was big business.
It was a riot of ethnic and regional styles.
And it was a psychic map that traced and exposed its fans' curiosity about the boundaries between races, classes and sexes.

Harold Rome, 85, Writer of Socially Pointed Songs
Harold J. Rome, who wrote witty, often socially pointed songs for Broadway shows that included "Pins and Needles," "Wish You Were Here," "Fanny," "Destry Rides Again" and "I Can Get It for You Wholesale," died yesterday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 85.
The cause was complications from a stroke, said his son, Joshua.


Consumer Confidence Drops
The widely followed Conference Board consumer confidence index fell sharply this month, declining to 59.4 points in October from 63.8 in September.
Although the business research group's survey rattled stock investors and knocked the dollar down, economists do not see it as a persuasive sign that consumers are about to retrench.
For one thing, two other respected confidence surveys suggest that consumer spirits -- though far from buoyant -- are rising a bit, not declining.
The University of Michigan's index, regarded as a somewhat less volatile gauge than the Conference Board's, perked up in the first half of this month, jumping to 83.1 from 77.9.


James Collins, 45, Christian Brother And Administrator
Brother James X. Collins, director of development and former professor of anthropology at Manhattan College, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital.

U.S. IN QUIET TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA
In unpublicized talks aimed at ending an impasse over international supervision of North Korea's nuclear program, United States and North Korean officials meeting in New York have discussed steps toward cancellation of war games conducted by United States and South Korean forces and the possibility of eventual American diplomatic recognition of the North, Government officials and private citizens say.
The discussions, a new channel of communication between Washington and the Communist Government in Pyongyang, were joined two weeks ago by North Korea's principal arms control negotiator, Choi U Jin, the officials and citizens said.

Edward Joseph Maude, a former chairman and chief executive of the United Mutual Savings Bank in Manhattan, died on Oct. 13 at his home in New Bern, N.C.
He was 69 and had lived in Montclair, N.J., until 1987.
The cause was cancer, his family said.


Looking Ahead at Dinkins Cabinet
As he campaigns for a second term, Mayor David N. Dinkins steadfastly refuses to talk about what his second administration would look like, though it is clear at City Hall that he would, if re-elected, probably have to find successors for his two most important aides as well as improve the overall management of his government.
Some senior advisers say Mr.
Dinkins thinks that some commissioners may need to be replaced, or, as one put it, that "he's got to tighten up the bolts in some places." Whether Mr.
Dinkins, who has long shown a reluctance to dismiss people, would ask for the resignation of some of his less-than-stellar commissioners is a matter of debate within the administration.


Islanders End Slump With a Scoring Flurry
The Islanders burst out of their slump tonight and ended a five-game streak without winning with an impressive 7-0 thumping of the Los Angeles Kings at the Coliseum.
The Kings, a Stanley Cup finalist last spring, put on a lethargic display, losing for the third consecutive time on a grueling road trip.
Ron Hextall, the Islander goalie who has been off to a slow start, stopped 38 Los Angeles shots and got support from the 11,417 fans, a stark difference from the booing and sarcastic cheering he has heard in recent weeks.
Derek King and Steve Thomas each scored twice, and the power-play unit scored four times.


Review/Rock; A Reviving of Psychedelia, With a Purist's Approach
Even the most dedicated observers have probably lost count of rock's psychedelic revivals.
Since the punk-rock revolution, psychedelia has kept reappearing.
Over the last decade it has taken forms from the whimsical rock songs of Julian Cope and Robyn Hitchcock to the long-winded jams of Blues Traveler and the Spin Doctors to the synthetic soundscapes of the Orb.
Now the music provides a double escape: into druggy altered perceptions and often back to the fondly remembered 1960's.
Verve, an English band that performed on Friday night at Irving Plaza, makes its acid-rock revival an exercise in purism, harking back to Pink Floyd circa 1968.
Nick McCabe played his guitar through reverb and echo devices that made the songs toll and ripple and ooze; the tempos were slow and somber.
And Richard Ashcroft, looking every bit the psychedelic poster icon with his center-parted shoulder-length hair and rail-thin body, danced with bursts of manic energy and sang lines like, "Hello, it's me, crying out, crying out, are you there?" or "No one cares, no one sees me." Now and then he allowed himself a falsetto whoop that suggested Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant.
Behind the band, screens showed slides of things like faces, pyramids and handwritten lyrics.


Patrick's Name Is Engraved on the Bench
Brian Leetch has been benched on several occasions, Mike Richter was replaced in goal six minutes into a game, and many other Rangers have been criticized for underachieving by their new coach, Mike Keenan.
But for all Keenan's pep talks, tirades and disciplinary tactics, no player on the Rangers has drawn his wrath more than veteran defenseman James Patrick.
He is buried so deep in Keenan's doghouse that he has already been scratched from the lineup in four of New York's first 10 games.


Dr. Kevin D. Dowling, Surgery Professor, 61
Dr.
Kevin D. Dowling, former chairman of the department of orthopedic surgery at St.
Francis Hospital in Hartford, and a clinical professor of surgery at the University of Connecticut, died on Monday at his home in West Hartford.
He was 61.
The cause was cancer, according to a spokesman for the university.


Term-Limit Foes Counterattack
As supporters of the referendum that would limit New York City's elected officials to two four-year terms continued an expensive television blitz, opponents began their counterattack yesterday with a rally of union and civic leaders on the steps of City Hall.
And with only a week before the referendum, Proposal 4, goes before voters, the organizers of the opposition acknowledged that, short of time and money, they would not be able to do much more to spread their message.

Ogilvy &amp; Mather Direct in New York took top honors, winning six awards, at the 64th annual International Echo Awards competition sponsored by the Direct Marketing Association.

Orsatti &amp; Parrish in Boston followed with three awards: one silver and two bronze.


Review/Music; Students and Stars With Joint Impact
The finale of the Fiddlefest concert at Carnegie Hall on Monday evening was a reminder that the professional music world, the parade of stars and contenders who tread the boards night after night, is only part of the picture.
After two hours of performances by famous classical, jazz and country fiddlers, 14 students from East Harlem public schools shared music stands with their starry elders and collaborated on a heartwarming performance of a Bach concerto movement.
The students study with Roberta Guaspari-Tzavaras, a violinist whose public-school music program was canceled in a round of budget cuts but who persuaded her school board to let her continue to teach as long as she found her salary elsewhere.
Her solution was to solicit corporate and private donations to start the Opus 118 Music Center, through which she teaches 130 students ages 6 to 13.

The case was brought in 1990 by a student who was told he could not apply for a full, four-year scholarship under the university's Banneker Program because he is not black.
The student, Daniel Podberesky, who is Hispanic, argued that he qualified in every way but color and that the restrictive policy was unconstitutional.

The two-tier wage system is a key factor in the carrier's effort to reverse losses on many short-haul routes where it competes against Southwest Airlines, which has lower operating costs.


Juror in Denny Case Recounts Stress and an Obsession With Detail
Feeling the weight of a city's fears and tensions, jurors in the case of two men who beat a truck driver during last year's riots focused obsessively on minute details, spending hours dissecting the meanings of words and points of law and sometimes losing sight of a larger picture.
This sense of the three weeks of intense deliberations emerged from a late-night interview on Monday with the youngest of the jurors, a 22-year-old white woman whose mother said she had never before been forced to make difficult decisions like this.

Bridge BYL&gt;By Alan Truscott; A less than perfect defense is unraveled much as the lowly winkle is untwisted.
A humble shellfish much favored by London cockneys is the winkle, which can be coaxed from its convoluted home with the aid of a pin.
The bridge winkle is an equally convoluted creature that can be brought into the daylight by a skillful declarer without a pin.
An example, with slightly imperfect defense, is the diagramed deal from a Stratified Mixed Pairs Championship at the Summer Nationals in Washington in July.
North and South were Mary and David Price of Toronto, who reached three no-trump with a brisk auction.
West had to guess which red suit to lead, and guessed wrong by leading a diamond.

Another Big Block by Roy: The Devils' Unbeaten Streak
The first loss for the Devils came tonight.
It came after seven victories to open the season.
It came in a 2-0 shutout.
Worse, it came at the artful hands of the Montreal Canadiens, the team the Devils so desperately wanted to beat for several reasons.
The foremost reason was that Coach Jacques Lemaire and his assistant, Larry Robinson, are two Canadien legends who are in their first season with the Devils.
Then there was the fact that Montreal is the defending Stanley Cup champion and had last spring's most valuable player in the playoffs, Patrick Roy, in goal tonight at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena.


Debut of Railroad's Shares Roils Tokyo Stock Market
After months of careful planning by the Government, the stock market debut on Tuesday of JR East, the huge Government-controlled railroad, set off a speculative frenzy that nearly paralyzed the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Tuesday and again on Wednesday morning, while sending the overall market tumbling.
On Tuesday investors sold off other shares to purchase the newly listed JR East, pushing the Nikkei 225-stock market index down 285.73 points, or 1.4 percent, to 20,023.60.
The turmoil grew worse early Wednesday, with the surge of buy orders for JR East disrupting the Tokyo Stock Exchange's computers.

I Dreamed of Rats Alley And Found Collectibles
THIS is for the microfilm, for posterity, for future generations of anthropologists and social historians who may want to take note that in the last decade of the 20th century at least two stores in New York City were selling human skeletons and bones, apparently for decorative purposes, not just in this Halloween season, but year round.
At Evolution, a store at 120 Spring Street in SoHo, there is one skeleton near the door with a sign that says "Homo Sapiens, Provenance: India $3,700." The proprietor, Bill Stevens, said the specimen died in the last 20 years.
A second human skeleton, dating back to Victorian times, bore a price tag of $2,800.
It's provenance is given as China.

Puerto Rico Takes Lead With School Vouchers, And Feels the Arrows

Review/Film; East Berlin in Gloom-Tinted Glasses
Some of the most telling moments in Peter Kahane's film "The Architects," a somber, finely drawn portrait of life in East Berlin in the final days of the Communist regime, are long panning shots of the city's ugly, factorylike public housing.
Shot from moving cars, these views of block after block of anonymous rectangular buildings evoke a joyless environment in which the imagination is systematically stifled and where people live in a state of chronic, low-grade depression.
The film depicts this society's grinding down of Daniel Brenner (Kurt Naumann), an idealistic architect in his late 30's.
Daniel, like many others of his generation, is deeply frustrated by life under the Communists but somehow tolerates it.
Hired to design a miniature city on the fringe of Berlin, he fools himself into thinking that he can counteract the prevailing gloom with a cheerier, more innovative approach.
Working with a hand-picked team of friends who were classmates in architecture school, he comes up with a design that incorporates rooftop gardens and modern sculptures and that has architectural variety and generous breathing space.

Workers, however, will still get 90 percent of their pay for days they are idled.

Mazda and Nissan have had particularly heavy losses.

Idea of Using National Guard to Help Police Draws Disdain
Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's notion of using National Guard troops to help combat the escalating crime in the nation's capital is drawing little support and some ridicule from mayors, police chiefs and Guard commanders around the country.

For Giuliani, an Unusual Opportunity to Change the Whole Face of City Hall
When Rudolph W. Giuliani speaks of how he would govern, he often refers to Fiorello H. La Guardia, the Depression-era fusion Republican who threw out the Democratic clubhouse and brought in as advisers an eclectic mix of Republicans, Socialists, New Dealers and even a vice president of Macy's.
And in many ways Mr.
Giuliani could be just as free to cast a broad net as Mr.
La Guardia was half a century ago.
For if the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor surges to victory on Nov. 2, his election would mark the first time in two decades that Democrats had lost control of City Hall, giving Mr.
Giuliani a rare opportunity to change the face of city government radically and to bring new people to the 1,500 jobs under the control of the Mayor.

Review/Music; Mystical, Minimal And Now Onstage
The most famous piece of art music in the world today is probably Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3.
It has been recorded at least three times, and on Elektra/Nonesuch the 17-year-old, hourlong work for soprano and orchestra has been the No. 1 classical album for much of this year, on British and American charts.
It has also made its way onto the pop charts, and has sold over half a million copies.
But this piece and others by this Polish composer have not been a major presence on the concert scene until now.
On Sunday night at Merkin Concert Hall, the pianist David Arden presented the American premiere of Mr.
Gorecki's First Piano Sonata along with his Four Preludes (Op. 1), which were written in the mid-1950's and are startlingly unmystical, containing robust toccatalike passages that recall Chopin's Scherzos or the music of Szymanowski.

The Jets' High-Octane Offense Is Hearing Knocks and Pings
Bills linebacker Darryl Talley, playing the percentages last Sunday, stepped in front of a pass that Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason threw to tight end James Thornton and the linebacker returned the interception 61 yards for a game-breaking touchdown.
After the game, Talley said he figured the Jets were going to run the play because he had seen it quite a bit during film study the week before and he hadn't seen it yet that day.


A Singular Victorian House With at Least Eight Views
BUILT in 1872, the 6,000-square-foot octagonal house in Irvington, N.Y., looks like something out of a Victorian fairy tale.
Among its features are a two-story dome topped with an observatory, two curvilinear staircases and a cast-iron railing, an etched-glass solarium, a three-room master suite and seven additional bedrooms.
Now it and its three acres can be yours for $2.8 million.


7 Cases: What the White House Says
President Clinton yesterday submitted his health care legislation to Congress, accompanied by a report to the country summarizing the proposal.
A series of hypothetical examples outline the current and projected costs of insurance coverage for a number of families or individuals in varying circumstances.
Here are excerpts from the report, with White House's description and cost estimates.
TWO-PARENT FAMILY YEARLY COST TO FAMILY NOW: Mary Sampson manages a small law office in San Jose, California.
She makes $35,000 a year.
Her husband, a minister, makes $30,000 a year.
Today, they get their coverage through Mary's employer, who pays half their premium.
They pay $2,940 a year, 8 percent of her salary, for their health care premiums alone, not including co-payments and deductibles.
CLINTON PLAN: Assuming they choose an average-priced plan, the premium for Mary Sampson and her husband will be around $872 a year, or $73 a month.
They could choose a higher cost plan, which would cost them more, or a 1ower cost plan, which would cost them less.
COUPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS NOW: Dennis and Barbara Rutherford, who live in Hannibal, Missouri have a combined income of $21,200.
Dennis was laid off from his high paying job with a large manufacturing firm in late 1990.
At that time, both Rutherfords lost their health care coverage.
They have been turned down for other coverage because of preexisting conditions -- Dennis' high blood pressure and Barbara's history of breast cancer.
Since then, they have been unable to afford the $9,000 a year ($750 a month) premium offered by the only plan that will accept
them.
CLINTON PLAN: If Dennis and Barbara enrolled in an average priced plan, they would pay 20 percent of the $3,865 annual premium for a couple -- $773 a year, or $64 a month.
SINGLE PARENT WITH SICK CHILD NOW: Sara Bender, a 28-year-old broadcast journalist, lives in Columbus, Ohio, and makes $34,000 a year.
Because she works for a firm which gets a lower cost premium for its healthy workers, she has been paying only $300 a year, or $25 a month for her health care coverage.
CLINTON PLAN: If Sara enrolled in an average cost plan she would pay 20% of the $1,932 annual premium for a single policy -- $386 a year, or $32 a month.
SINGLE PARENT WITH SICK CHILD NOW: Susan Addington is a single parent living in Virginia.
She is self-employed with an income of $40,000 a year.
Because her son has a serious chronic illness, she paid $3,000 in out-of-pocket costs and $5,000 in insurance premiums in just one year.
Because she is selfemployed, she was only able to deduct 25% of her $5,000 premium or $1,250 of these costs.
CLINTON PLAN: For the family share of her premium, for an average-priced plan, Susan will pay 20% of the $3,893 annual premium for a single parent family-- $779 a year.
She will also pay the employer share for a single parent -- $2,479, for a total of $3,258-a-year or $272 a month.
And she will be able to deduct 100 percent of the premium.
PROFESSIONAL COUPLE NOW: Michael and Elizabeth Sands work and live in Memphis, Tennessee, and together earn almost $90,000 a year.
Elizabeth is a graphic artist, making $40,000.
Although Elizabeth's firm offers her health insurance, the couple chooses to receive their coverage through the architectural firm where Michael works, because it provides a more generous, comprehensive benefits package.
Today the Sands pay $720 a year, or $60 a month, for this coverage.
The total premium costs $4,400 a year, and the architecture firm pays the rest.
CLINTON PLAN: The Sands want to stay with their current plan.
Under reform, this plan will cost less than it does today because it wiII no longer pay for the uncompensated care delivered to the uninsured, saving 10 percent of the current premium cost.
The average cost of a couple premium in the Sands' alliance is $3,865 but the Sands pick a plan that will cost $4,000.
They will pay the dffference between 80 percent of the average cost plan, which is $3092, and $4,000, or $908 a year, $75 a month.
LOW INCOME FAMILY NOW: Lars and Brenda Gustafson recently had a new baby, and Brenda resigned from her job shortly before the baby was born.
Lars works for a messenger service in Minneapolis, Minnesota and takes home about $250 a week, or $13,000 a year.
His employer does not offer him health insurance.
As a result, he and his family have been uninsured for two years.
CLINTON PLAN: Provided Lars and Brenda choose an average price plan, they will pay 20 percent of $4,360 or $872 for a two-parent family policy.
But because Lars is in a two-parent family with income less than $14,781 a year, he is eligible for a discount, reducing his premium to $384 a year.
FARMERS NOW: James Huggins, a self-employed family farmer in Kansas, makes $25,000 a year and has struggled to pay for health care coverage for himself, his wife and his 10-year-old son.
He is only able to deduct one fourth of the $4,000 he pays in premiums each year.
CLINTON PLAN: If James enrolls in an average cost plan, he will pay 20 percent of the $4,360 annual family premium or $872 a year.
Like a business, James will also pay the employer share of his premium, which would normally be $2,479.
However, that amount would exceed 7.9 percent of James' income, the limit on what employers are required to pay.
Instead James will pay 7.9 percent of $25,000 or $1,975 for his employer share.
James will pay a total of $2,847 a year, or $237 a month.
For the first time, James Huggins will be also be able to deduct from taxable income the full cost of his health care premiums. -- Excerpts from HEALTH SECURITY: THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

Bridge; In the production of books on championship matches, quality is up and speed down.
In one area of bridge, quality has gone way up and speed has gone way down.
That area is the production of championship books.
Six decades ago, Ely Culbertson published a book on an international match in England within a few days of its conclusion.
He dictated notes on some of the deals between sessions, but his efforts were brief and often inaccurate.
Nowadays it takes a year and a great deal of effort to produce a world championship book.
For the 1992 Team Olympiad in Salsomaggiore, Italy, the efforts were largely by Eric Kokish of Canada and Brian Senior of England and were fully up to the standard of earlier years.
The book, consisting of 176 pages and many photographs, is obtainable from The Bridge World, 39 West 94th Street, New York N.Y. 10025 for $28.70.


Thompson Gets Campaign for Milk
The American Dairy Association of Rosemont, Ill., and the National Dairy Research and Promotion Board of Arlington, Va., selected J. Walter Thompson Chicago to handle a newly combined $50 million account to advertise milk, advertising executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity said yesterday.
The final creative presentations in a review that began in July were made earlier this week.
The other contenders were Leo Burnett U.S.A. of Chicago, DDB Needham Chicago, D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles of Chicago and McCann-Erickson San Francisco.

The beaten finalists were Los Angeles and Tampa, Fla.
Super Bowl games will be played in Atlanta in January, in Miami in 1995 and in Phoenix in 1996.


Beryl E. Menon, 50, Journalist and Traveler
Beryl Emmer Menon, a journalist who edited the staff newspaper of Unicef, the United Nations relief organization, and who traveled and wrote widely in India and the Himalayas, died on Oct. 19 at her home in Manhattan.
She was 50.
She had decided to discontinue kidney dialysis after 19 years of treatment, friends said.


Suspect Killed And 3 Officers Are Wounded
A 63-year-old man shot and wounded two police detectives who came to his home in Queens yesterday, then hid with a neighbor whom he took hostage for four hours, and finally shot a third officer who tried to block his escape.
The officer returned fire, the police said, and shot the man to death.
Each of the police officers survived.
The hostage was released unhurt.
But the afternoon drama -- with the hard-to-understand actions of a man with a gun -- horrified residents in Forest Hills, Queens, where it occurred.


Red Skies, Then Blackened Homes
Cinders shot across the Pacific Coast Highway in this exclusive beach town, and black smoke roiled across the surf as a fast-moving brush fire consumed more than 150 homes, along with their broad patios, swimming pools and tennis courts.
Though the 24,500 residents of Laguna Beach, 40 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, were ordered to evacuate, some refused to abandon their homes.
They stood on their roofs with garden hoses, wetting down shingles and surrounding palms as the firefighters shouted at them with bullhorns to retreat and the houses around them exploded in flames driven by the fast moving wind.

U.S. Returns 15 Refugees
A United States Coast Guard cutter docked here today and unloaded 15 Haitian refugees in front of a crowd of armed civilians similar to the one that confronted an American military vessel two weeks ago.
The director of the United States Information Services here, Stanley Schrager, said at a briefing that the 13 men and 2 women had fled Haiti on Monday from the northwestern coast aboard a rickety boat and had been picked up 30 miles offshore.

A Tricky Business, but Often a Treat
Marc Beige has circles under his eyes this time of year, and he doesn't bother wearing a tie.
Running a hand through his rumpled hair, he misses a strand of yellow thread caught there.
As if he didn't have enough to worry about, he just got a last-minute order for 500 Arabian princess costumes.
Every day seems like Halloween for Mr.
Beige, president of Rubie's Costume Company in Richland Park, Queens.
But even in October, he doesn't tire of the macabre.
Sitting at a desk strewn with leering skulls and clown wigs, Mr.
Beige is eager to discuss his company's spooky, kooky creations.


4 Win Columbia Prizes In Latin America News
Two journalists from the United States, one from Chile and a Caribbean news service have won the 1993 Maria Moors Cabot Prizes from Columbia University for contributions to inter-American understanding and the freedom of information.

William Kochiyama, Japanese Advocate, 72
William Kochiyama, a founder of the Asian Community Center and an advocate of reparations for American citizens of Japanese descent who were interned in World War II, died on Monday at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center of heart failure.
He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
Mr.
Kochiyama, who was born in Washington, was interned himself until he joined the all-Japanese 442d Regimental Combat Team, which fought with distinction in Europe and became the most decorated unit in United States military history.


Meanwhile in Serbia, a Quiet Genocide Goes On; Attacks by Muslims
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis castigates the Serbs in " 'The Siege Is Over' " (column, Oct. 18) for "a devastating artillery barrage" on Sarajevo on Oct. 16.
Also, he calls Radovan Karadzic, the Serbian leader in Bosnia, a "mass murderer" and accuses him of new lies for recently stating that the Serbs would not renew attacks on the Muslims.


Clinton for New Station
President Clinton is to announce today that he supports a proposal to transform the General Post Office at 33d Street and Eighth Avenue into a new Amtrak railroad hub for New York City, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said last night.
The President's announcement, scheduled to be made while he is campaigning with Mayor David N. Dinkins, will mark a milestone in the effort by Amtrak and its supporters, including Mr.
Moynihan and Mr.
Dinkins, to create a new intercity station intended to recapture the grandeur of the old Pennsylvania Station.


Corrections
A front-page picture caption on Oct. 18, about Rudolph W. Giuliani's visit with the leader of the Bobover Hasidic sect, misspelled the Grand Rabbi's name in some copies.
He is Solomon Halberstam.


Pop and Jazz in Review
Leslie Uggams  Rainbow and Stars 30 Rockefeller Plaza, 65th floor Through Nov. 20
Near the end of her exuberant new cabaret act, Leslie Uggams reminisces about her early days in show business, when she was a regular, featured performer on Mitch Miller's television sing-along program.
The 50-year-old singer, then still in her teens, recalls adoring rock-and-roll, a style that Mr.
Miller, an outspoken disparager of rock, forbade on his show.


U.S. Asks Favoritism in Cars Despite Accord With Japan
In its new proposals to pry open automobile trade with Japan, the United States Government is seeking especially to promote sales to Japan of American-built cars and trucks.
The effort is being made despite wording in the recent trade framework with Japan that any steps to open the market must benefit other countries as well.
In the proposals, which were presented last week, the United States called for "prompt, substantial and sustained" increases in sales not only of foreign automobiles generally but also specifically of American vehicles.
Also, the United States wants to promote exports of cars made by the Big Three -- not those made on Japanese assembly lines in the United States.


Families Mourning 2 Victims in Cairo Attack
Coby M. Hoffman and Robert L. Guidi were slain during a business dinner in a luxury Cairo hotel, apparently as they discussed construction of a natural gas pipeline from Egypt to Israel.
Hours before a gunman popped up from a table in a coffee shop in the Semiramis Inter-Continental Hotel and sprayed the room with gunfire Tuesday night, Mr.
Hoffman and Mr.
Guidi had met with Egypt's Minister of Energy, visited the Pyramids, and were preparing for a trip today from Cairo to Tel Aviv, said Mr.
Guidi's sister-in-law, Jennifer Leitner.


Fear of Immigrants Sounds an Old Theme
To the Editor:
I read with interest "Immigration Hurting City, New Yorkers Say in Survey" (news article, Oct. 18).
Those of today's New Yorkers who worry about the foreign-born 28 percent of their neighbors might gain some perspective by comparing the present to the first great wave of immigration.


The Past Gets in the Way of Big East's Future
Uh-oh. A new logo. You know what that means.
Approaching the age of 15, the Big East Conference has undergone a marketing makeover.
You can hear the presentation as the logo was placed on the easel.


Hopes Fade For Debate In Big Race
Five days before the election, a standoff between Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani is making it increasingly likely that for the first time in at least 32 years there will be no televised debates between the principal contenders for mayor of New York City, only sound bites passing in the air.
The stalemate is the result of polls showing the contest too close to call, so neither is willing to budge on his conditions for an unscripted encounter that could be especially influential in swaying undecided voters.
Mr.
Dinkins refuses to debate without the Conservative and Right to Life candidate, George J. Marlin, and Mr.
Giuliani insists on a face-to-face encounter with the Mayor since Mr.
Marlin would presumably only siphon conservative support from Mr.
Giuliani.


In Itty-Bitty Toys, Mega-Mega-Profits
WHAT a guy Mighty Max is.
He slays the awesome Doom Dragon, melts the evil Ice Alien and thwarts the Mad Nuke Ranger's plan to blow up the world.
All of this from a pencil-thin hero who, in his T-shirt and baseball cap, stands less than one inch tall.
Mighty Max is one of the stars of the toy industry for 1993, the year they shrank the toys.


Meanwhile in Serbia, a Quiet Genocide Goes On
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis, in " 'The Siege Is Over' " (column, Oct. 18) feels sorry for the 300,000 Sarajevo civilians who have to endure a new outbreak of fighting.
And who wouldn't?
But he shows no empathy for the far greater suffering that United Nations sanctions are causing in Serbia.


A Race of TV Images: Framing the Debate
Perhaps the most interesting television advertisement in New Jersey's crowded political season has little to do with the main attraction, the race for governor.
It is a spot that urges the re-election of William L. Gormley, a Republican State Senator from Atlantic City, and it is almost entirely devoted to a visual of him paddling about in the rough ocean surf in a kayak.
The last image shows the 46-year old candidate on the beach in his bathing suit, looking, from what might be interpreted as a deliberate backside angle, like something of a hunk.


Not Ready for Prime Time
Five days before New York votes, it seems increasingly likely there will be no televised debates between the two top rivals for mayor.

Dinkins Seeks Hispanic Forgiveness
In a close mayoral election in which the Hispanic vote is considered crucial, David N. Dinkins is trying to mend fences after four years in which many of his Hispanic supporters say they felt undervalued and ignored.
In public forums and meetings with Hispanic elected officials, Mr.
Dinkins says he has learned from his mistakes and is promising to be more accessible and responsive to the concerns of an electorate that voted for him overwhelmingly in 1989.
He calls himself "David Martinez Dinkins" before Hispanic audiences and laces speeches with snippets of tortured Spanish.


Classical Music in Review
New Music Consort  Manhattan School of Music
The New Music Consort gave an unusually large audience a choice of occasions to celebrate on Tuesday evening.
The ensemble's concert opened both its own season and the second Sonic Boom festival, a contemporary-music series that runs through Nov. 20.
It also commemorated the 75th anniversary of its home, the Manhattan School of Music, and the 85th birthday of Elliott Carter (on Dec. 11).
Mr.
Carter's Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano With Two Chamber Orchestras (1961) was the centerpiece of the varied program.
Its two ensembles are built around the keyboard instruments, and each group speaks in a distinct musical dialect.
The work's structure plays on the ensembles' increasing differentiation and eventual reconciliation, with results that alternately suggest sophisticated debate and gang warfare.


Lou Miller, 78, Dies; Sportswriter and Racer
Lou Miller, a former sportswriter whose penchant for practicing the sports he covered peaked when he became an accomplished harness driver in the 1950's, died on Monday at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, L.I.
He was 78.
His family said he died of cardiac arrest.


Regional Configuration Gets Pro Football Team
The Carolina Panthers will do, but if the owners of the National Football League's newest franchise really want to get the name right, they might try something more descriptive, like the Carolina Post-Urban Regional Configuration.
To be sure, urban policy was not exactly Topic A today in this town.
From the exultant "TOUCHDOWN!" across the top of The Charlotte Observer, to James Laughlin's hawking cassettes of his "Carolina Rally Song," to the hand-scrawled "Carolina Panthers -- A Reality" triumphantly tacked to Uptown Donnie's hot dog stand, the only subject was the N.F.L.'s anointing of Charlotte on Tuesday as the home of the league's 29th franchise.


Clinton's Health Plan: News Analysis Political Shoals Ahead; Clinton's Health Plan Goes From Concept To Clauses, Every One a Potential Target
President Clinton's struggle to overhaul the health care system entered a new and treacherous phase today.
Act I could be summarized by the images and ideas of a red, white and blue health security card, an impassioned First Lady and the generally accepted notion that the country needs a better health care system.


Bosnian Forces Kill Reputed Gang Chief In Sarajevo Gunfight
A Bosnian Government crackdown on alleged racketeers within the Bosnian forces in Sarajevo ended with a gun battle on Tuesday night in which the man reputed to be the most powerful gang leader in this besieged city was killed along with 17 others, 8 of them civilians caught in crossfire.
After 24 hours in which the city's 300,000 residents were ordered to stay off the streets, the Bosnian forces opened barricades and allowed normal traffic to resume.
At a news conference, army and police commanders declared the crackdown a success, but the casualties, including two policemen who were said to have been killed by the dead gang leader before he was shot, shocked many in the city.


U.N.'s Grim Documentation At a Massacre Site in Bosnia
Until about 3 P.M. on Saturday, this village in the mountains of central Bosnia was a haven from the war that has engulfed much of this former Yugoslav republic, a cluster of houses high in a valley where the immediate concern of the Muslim inhabitants was gathering in beets, potatoes and squashes before the snows begin.
Then the brutality came up the winding dirt road from the town on the valley floor, in cars and trucks that arrived so suddenly that some of the 250 villagers had time only to pull on one sleeve of their winter jackets before rushing for the safety of the woodlands above the village.
As they fled, they dropped a trail of shoes, gloves and half-emptied cigarette packs along the muddy paths.

U.S. MAY TIGHTEN EMBARGO ON HAITI
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 --
With efforts to restore Haiti's elected President stymied, President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers met today to consider a complete economic embargo against the poor Caribbean nation.
But they took no action, and it was not clear when they would meet again.


Islanders Will Lose Krupp for 4 Weeks
When the Islanders left for Florida yesterday, they were without Uwe Krupp, one of their regular defensemen, who will miss about four weeks with a fractured sinus bone.
Krupp was injured when he was hit in the face by a puck Tuesday night during a 7-0 victory over the Los Angeles Kings at the Coliseum that ended the Islanders' five-game winless streak.


Richter Earns a Shot at Canadiens
This is what Mike Keenan expects of his goaltenders: Play as well or better as the man in the opposite net, and then let your teammates take care of the rest.
It appears, then, that Mike Richter is in for a big test.


Small Effect Anticipated In Altered Shelter Rules
Dinkins administration officials said yesterday that they believed their new policy of turning away families who seek shelter but do not really need it would affect only a small number of people.
The city's top official for homeless policy estimated that the new rules, announced in August, might screen out about 40 to 60 of the 2,800 families seeking emergency housing each month, though he added that the number could turn out to be higher when the new plan actually took effect.


If Not Heavy Reading, It's Heavy Lifting
Copies of the Health Security Plan went on sale at noon yesterday, as President Clinton concluded his 19-minute summary of its contents to Congress.
The 1,342-page book, which is selling for $45 a copy, is more than four inches thick, weighs five and three-quarters pounds and is printed on 8-by-10-inch pages.


Polish Farmer Takes Power, Taciturn as Ever
The contrast was striking as the polished but battle-weary Prime Minister handed power to a fresh-faced, reserved young man who struggled to find the right words.
On Tuesday, Waldemar Pawlak, the 34-year-old son of a farming family, became Poland's sixth Prime Minister since the fall of Communism; he was briefly the fourth, for a month last year.
During his encounter with the departing Prime Minister, Hanna Suchocka, he managed a smile, and later he used the words "natural and calm" to describe the ceremony.


Catholic Bishops Proposing Active U.S. Policy Abroad
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops have drafted a statement calling for a more active American role on the world stage, including supporting the United Nations, expanding foreign aid and, when necessary, using military force for interventions intended to rescue people from hunger or mass violence.
Now in draft form, the statement is meant to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the bishops' 1983 pastoral letter on nuclear arms, which stirred intense public debate because it ran counter to the Reagan Administration's emphasis on a build-up of nuclear weapons.


C-MAC Industries reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 3


Earl D. Hanson, 66, Wesleyan Professor And Science Leader
Earl D. Hanson, the Fisk Professor of Natural Sciences at Wesleyan University and an academic leader who emphasized the role of ethics in science, died on Tuesday after he had a heart attack in his campus office in Middletown, Conn.
He was 66.
In an academic career that spanned nearly 40 years, Professor Hanson was one of the first to advocate ethical training of young scientists.
He also urged improved development of scientific teaching for nonscientists, with an emphasis on how genetic engineering could affect society.
Toward that end, he founded and was the chairman of the Science in Society program at Wesleyan.


Louisville Accepts Bid to Liberty Bowl
Louisville, which has a 7-1 record but limited access to bowl games because it is not part of a coalition that guarantees its members a New Year's Day game, accepted a bid yesterday to be the home team in this year's Liberty Bowl in Memphis.
The Cardinals, who are guaranteed $700,000 plus 37 1/2 percent of the game's net gate receipts, will play the fifth-place team from the Big Ten on the night of Dec. 28.
The game will be carried live by ESPN.


Dudley's Blazer Contract Gets Final Approval
It took a favorable ruling by an arbitrator, three favorable rulings by a special master and one very favorable 30-page opinion by a Federal judge, but Chris Dudley has finally been cleared to pursue his potentially highly lucrative career with the Portland Trail Blazers.
The final victory came yesterday when District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise handed down a decision in Federal Court in Newark rejecting the contention of the National Basketball Association that a clause of Dudley's multiyear contract with the Trail Blazers violated the salary cap provisions of the collectivebargaining agreement between the league and the N.B.A.
Players Association.


ANHEUSER-BUSCH COS. (N)
Despite increases in sales and market share for its beer products, the Anheuser-Busch Companies said yesterday that it lost $75 million in the third quarter after a restructuring charge of $565 million.
The charge was part of a previously announced program intended to save the company more than $400 million a year by 1997.
The earnings for the quarter also reflected two charges, $33 million and $8 million, to account for changes in the Federal corporate income tax rate.


Earl Banks, 69, Dies; Coach at Morgan State
Earl Banks, who turned Morgan State University into a small-college football power during his 13 years as coach in the 1960's and 1970's, died yesterday after his car struck a brick wall, according to the police in Baltimore.
He was 69.
A Morgan State spokesman said that Mr.

The J. C. Penney Company is getting ready for holiday shopping by introducing a $60 million marketing push featuring a new slogan, "J. C. Penney. Doing it right."
The campaign is the second major effort created by Temerlin McClain of Dallas since it won the Penney account from Ayer Inc. in 1991.
It is Temerlin's first Penney's campaign with a slogan; Temerlin had dropped the Ayer theme "Fashion comes to life" when it assumed the account.


In British Hong Kong, Memorable Monikers
Britain's most indelible influence on the Chinese who populate this colony may be in name only.
From the Hong Kong bank clerk with Canine on her name tag to the insurance broker who calls herself Neon, many Hong Kong Chinese choose English names.
Tens of thousands of young Chinese are taking English language names each year.
It is not uncommon to encounter sophisticated Chinese here with names like Sherlock, Lenin, Apple, Psyche, Creamy or Cinderella.


ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS CORP. (N)
The Electronic Data Systems Corporation said yesterday that the 14.5 percent gain in its third-quarter net income, to $191.6 million, was the result of slightly higher revenue and cost reductions.
The information technology company, which is based in Dallas and is a unit of the General Motors Corporation, said its third-quarter revenue rose to $2.08 billion from $2 billion in the comparable quarter last year.


Corrections
An article on Oct. 21 about the Federal Government's decision to withdraw Pell grant assistance from 20 religious schools in New York State misstated the affiliations of some of the schools.

Trading in New Japanese Rail Stock is Halted on Deluge of Sell Orders
A day after a buying frenzy for the newly listed shares of the East Japan Railway Company created turmoil on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, investors reversed course and thrashed the stock with waves of selling today that choked the exchange's computers and left the overall market depressed.
In a desperate effort to end the tumult, the exchange suspended trading in the stock of the huge Government-controlled railway this morning, just the second day the company's shares have been for sale on the market.
But while that move rescued overloaded computers, it deprived thousands of anxious investors of the means to take profits on their holdings and created a major embarrassment for the Government's ambitious privatization program.

Gunman Mentally Ill, Egypt Says
Egyptian Interior Ministry officials said today that the man who shot and killed two American engineers and a French jurist here Tuesday night was mentally ill and that they had no evidence linking him to any Muslim militant groups.
The ministry officials said the gunman, Saber Abu al-Ila, a 28-year-old musician, had been expelled from Egypt's military service in 1989 for medical reasons and that he had received psychiatric care in a military hospital.
The authorities are investigating the possibility that the attack was politically motivated, they said.

In Their Own Words
GIULIANI
The two mayoral candidates disagree over the format for a debate, so no face-to-face meeting has been scheduled.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, at his campaign headquarters yesterday, again said he would not debate if the Conservative Party candidate, George J. Marlin, is included.
"In Presidential campaigns 1- and 2-percent candidates are not allowed in the debates for the very simple reason that there is a precious little amount of time that you have for people to absorb issues. If you take one hour and you divide it by three, there is considerably less substance than if you divide it by two. And if you are going to start dividing precious air time, then you are going to have debates with five, six and seven people.

They beat the Hawkeyes, 23-22, that night in one of the better Kickoff Classics.

The argot of health-care reform is often stupefying, but if President Clinton and his opponents maintain today's oratorical pace, managed care and preferred provider organizations and health alliances may even become fascinating, if not understandable.

Books of The Times; Why Bush Bombed (in the Election, Not the War)
Hell of a Ride  Backstage at the White House Follies, 1989-1993 By John Podhoretz 249 pages.
Simon &amp; Schuster. $21.
How did George W. Bush go from being one of the most popular Presidents in modern history in March 1991 to being voted out of office 18 months later?
In "Hell of a Ride: Backstage at the White House Follies, 1989-1993," John Podhoretz, a professional speechwriter, has written a shrewdly plausible analysis with a wit (verging on occasional silliness) that makes you wish all political studies could be this lighthearted and succinct.


Aristide Has Long Posed Problem for Vatican
While Vatican officials have not publicly gone as far as the C.I.A. in trying to brand the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide as mentally unstable, the deposed Haitian leader has long been seen by Roman Catholic leaders as an advocate of political violence, a charge also leveled against him by the C.I.A. in Washington.
The rift between the Vatican and Father Aristide dates to his 1988 expulsion from his order, the Salesians, and a church decision to bar him from publicly carrying out the duties of a priest.

Review/Pop; Earthy Epiphanies On Love, Love, Love, By Luther Vandross
A recurrent tableau in Luther Vandross's new show has him alone on the stage, singing nearly unaccompanied.
He's a solitary figure talking about transcendental love, the sort of love that saves lives, at least in songs.
These are pure Vandross moments.
His voice quivers in the silence.
Everything he does signifies passion.
He sings of lost love so plaintively that one wants to help the poor guy.
Then the audience goes crazy: the process of empathy banishes loss completely, and love returns, made as real as a stolen kiss.
Mr.
Vandross, who is one of pop music's finest virtuosos, may also be one of its greatest actors, and at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night, where he did the first of four sold-out shows ending Saturday, he was in full command of his powers.
On "Here and Now" he started with "I'm so glad," all gospel emotion.
"I'm so glad," he continued, full of sadness, ending the mini-skit with "I won a Grammy!" an old gag of his which exposed the manipulative, dramatic aspects of his craft and made the adoring audience laugh.
Even his asides were sung ("I'm sweaty already"), and they soared and glided on his pure vocal virtuosity.


At First, Frank Thomas Keeps On Succeeding
A day after he agreed to a four-year contract extension worth a guaranteed $29 million, Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox yesterday received the best average ranking at any position in baseball's ranking statistics.
Thomas, who is the heavy favorite to win the American League Most Valuable Player award, emerged with an average rank of 1.600 among the league's first basemen, eighth-lowest among all players in the 13 years the ranking statistics have been computed.
The best possible average rank is 1.000, a level attained only by Don Mattingly in 1987 and Cal Ripken Jr. in 1991.

Piazza, who won the Los Angeles catching job in spring training, hit .318 with 35 home runs and 112 runs batted in for the Dodgers and threw out 35 percent of the runners who attempted to steal on him, third best in the league.

Durable-Goods Orders Up for a Second Month
More evidence that the economy is shifting into higher gear emerged today as orders for long-lived factory goods posted a second straight increase in September, the first back-to-back advance in nearly a year.
While the September rise for durable goods was just seven-tenths of 1 percent, after a revised 2.6 percent gain in August, analysts said the Commerce Department report reflected surprisingly strong performance.
The orders total was held down by plunging military and aviation business, but, because of the long time between placing orders and actually producing such goods, that category has relatively little bearing on immediate economic prospects.

So Neil Jordan, the writer and director of "The Crying Game," is making his next move under the influence of the poet John Milton and the mogul David Geffen, though not necessarily in that order.
It was Mr.
Geffen who suggested Mr.
Jordan take on "Interview With the Vampire," the enormously popular novel by Anne Rice that introduced the worldly vampire Lestat and his protege and victim, Louis, in antebellum New Orleans.
"I knew exactly what to do when I read it," Mr.
Jordan said of the novel.


Bottle Redemption Center Needs More Support
To the Editor:
As an early and continuing supporter of We Can, I think concern over financial problems slights the achievements of the nonprofit group, which aids the homeless in New York City by redeeming returnable bottles and cans.
Nonprofit beverage container redemption centers were an inspired idea by Guy Polhemus.
The results have been nothing short of miraculous.
When resolve in dealing with homelessness and poverty is waning, We Can has quietly provided the poor and homeless with $11 million in income earned by removing cans and bottles from the garbage stream.
This did not result from bad management decisions.


Motorola's Chairman Will Head Kodak
The Eastman Kodak Company surprised Wall Street yesterday by naming George M. C. Fisher, the chairman of Motorola Inc., as its chairman, president and chief executive.
Mr.
Fisher, who is 52 and has headed Motorola since 1990, succeeds Kay R. Whitmore.
Mr.
Whitmore was dismissed by Kodak's board in August because of the company's lackluster financial performance and his reluctance to radically change the tradition-bound photographic company.
Mr.
Whitmore had agreed to stay on until a successor was chosen.


Utility Bonds Hit by Rating Threat
Utility bonds took a beating yesterday after the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation announced that several companies were facing a credit rating downgrading and that the outlook for a third of the industry was being switched from stable to negative.
The announcement by S.&amp; P. threatened to push the bonds of some electric companies from investment grade status into noninvestment grade, or junk bond, status.
And the selling was especially focused on companies that are already at the bottom of the investment grade rankings.


Haig Scorns U.S. for Its Tough China Policy

Meanwhile in Serbia, a Quiet Genocide Goes On; What Croatians Fear
To the Editor:
On a recent monthlong visit to Croatia, I found that anger at the United Nations force is shared even by those unhappy with the Croatian Government's policies, and the leaders of Croatia have no need to whip it up artificially.
The greatest fear of the Croats is to become the newest Cyprus, divided and host to a United Nations force for decades.
With the lack of progress on the limited measures of the Vance plan and the intransigence of the Serbian leadership, that fear is reasonable.

Chretien Says He Wants Changes in Trade Accord
Fresh from the stunning triumph of his Liberal party in Canada's general elections, Prime Minister-designate Jean Chretien said today that he wants changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement and may not implement the pact without them.
Although he insisted at a news conference in Ottawa that Canada did not want to intervene in the debate over trade legislation in the United States, his comments complicated the task of passage and appeared to put him into conflict with President Clinton.

Pisa Journal; The Leaning Tower Loses a Tiny Bit of Its Tilt
It might be termed a triumph of physics and engineering over time and gravity.
It might also be called something of an eyesore.
But, however it is appraised, the gray 400-ton mass of lead ingots stacked at the base of the leaning tower of Pisa has achieved its goal: the tower has not, so far, toppled over.
What's more, reversing 800 years of the tower's slow tilting, the ingots have begun to pull the 187-foot pillar of white marble back toward the vertical.

A New York Olympics? Talk Is Cheap But Plentiful
A successful staging of the 1998 Goodwill Games could lead to serious discussions about a bid by the New York metropolitan area for the 2008 or 2012 Summer Olympics, officials connected with the Goodwill Games said yesterday.
The talk yesterday was just that.
Talk.
More like a Christmas wish list for the next decade.
Or a pipe dream.
With the 1996 Summer Olympics to be held in Atlanta and with Salt Lake City considered a strong candidate to play host to the 2002 Winter Olympics, the United States may have played out its Olympic hand for years to come.


Whitman's Tactics Could Still Decide Race in New Jersey
Christine Todd Whitman is getting lots of advice these days.
Whether she will take it is another question; the candidate has ignored plenty of back-seat driving so far this year.
Then there is the question of which advice to take: Should she "go negative" and tear down Jim Florio, as some people urge, or "go positive" and sing the praises of Christie Whitman?
Perhaps the most important questions of all are these: Could anything make a difference so late in the game for a candidate who trails by double digits in most independent polls?
Could something still happen to destroy Mr.
Florio's apparently comfortable lead?

Review/Dance; Solitude and Memory by a Brooding Sea
It's Paul Taylor time again, and modern dance's most unpredictable master choreographer returned on Tuesday night with a gala benefit for his company that featured Mikhail Baryshnikov as a guest artist.
The news, however, was not Mr.
Baryshnikov's sincere A-for-effort performance in an excerpted Taylor solo (from "Aureole"), for which he was utterly miscast.
The fact that modern-dance companies look to the superstar presence of ballet stars to sell high-priced benefits is part of an established practice. (Mr. Taylor, in return, has reportedly agreed to choreograph a work for Mr. Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project.)


PARENT &amp; CHILD
ABOUT a month ago, Keira Walsh, 11, was stopped by a classmate on her way to school in Madison, Wis.
"He grabbed my bike so that I couldn't move," she recalled.
"He cursed at me. He kept yelling in my ear. Someone had said something that he didn't like, and he was taking it out on other people."
Most classrooms include at least one highly aggressive child who tries to have his way by bullying.
While adults realize that such children are seldom as threatening as they try to make themselves out to be, their peers see them quite differently.
A 10-year-old who is extorting milk money or threatening to chase a child home after school can loom large in the fears of an 8-year-old.
Handing over a quarter a day to avoid possibly being beaten up seems a small price to pay.

Review/Dance; Sculptured Delicacy Of Indonesian Scenes
The Sardono Dance Theater, which made its New York debut on Thursday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, does more than preserve traditional dances of Indonesia.
Sardono Waluyu Kusumo, its director, also creates his own contemporary choreography in an Indonesian style.
Therefore his "Passage Through the Gong" is an appropriate as well as an unusual attraction for the academy's innovative Next Wave series.
The production, which lasted about 75 minutes, began and ended serenely.
Although the calm was broken several times, harmony was always restored, and dance and music were revealed to be forces that could both intoxicate and heal.

Cuomo Is Questioning Dismissal Of Head of Staten Island College
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo said yesterday that he had intervened in an effort to end the dispute over the dismissal of Dr.
Edmond L. Volpe, the president of the College of Staten Island, by the trustees of the City University of New York.
Dr.
Volpe was abruptly dismissed Monday evening by the trustees on the recommendation of the university's chancellor, Dr.
W.
Ann Reynolds.
University officials assert that Dr.
Volpe, 71 years old, was dismissed because he had reneged on earlier pledges to retire this academic year.
But Dr.
Volpe and his supporters say the real reason was the president's vocal opposition over the last few months to plans by Chancellor Reynolds to streamline academic programs across the 21-campus university system.


Sensible Changes in the Health Plan
The health care bill that President Clinton delivered to Capitol Hill yesterday preserves the major features, good and bad, of the plan leaked to the press last month.
The modifications are mostly minor, generally for the good and almost always designed to mollify a boisterous constituency.
The release of the 1,300-page legislation is less important for its new details than for the fact that Congress can finally begin serious debate.
Under the bill, most Americans would choose a health plan, providing generous benefits, from among those offered through a regional purchasing cooperative.
The plans would include managed-care coverage with limited choice of doctors and fee-for-service coverage with a wide choice of providers.
Individuals would buy policies with the help of contributions from their employers and, if needed, subsidies from Washington.

Prominent cancer researchers in New York have confessed to doing what many researchers have often wanted to do -- skip the Government paperwork needed to carry out drug experiments on human beings and go ahead without telling the Government or getting any of the necessary medical approvals.
Four researchers who were at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx admitted in statements given to the United States Attorney that they siphoned off a drug called IL-2 from one experiment, in which it was being used to treat kidney cancer, and injected it into the brain tumors of dying patients to see if it would help them.

GARDEN Q. &amp; A.
Autumn Crafts
This time of year, my mailbox is filled with questions on using the gleanings from gardens for seasonal decorations.
Autumn is harvest time for the flowers, herbs, berries, seedpods and ornamental grasses that can be dried and used for filling a barren window box or decorating a holiday table or a Christmas tree.


Thanks to an odd pitch, the Craftsman hammer can join Lenny (Nails) Dykstra in card collections.
"TRADE ya two Lenny Dykstras and a Joe Carter for a Sears Craftsman screwdriver and two Coca-Cola Santa Clauses!"
Cries like that have not yet begun to echo across the nation's schoolyards.
But they may someday, heralding an unusual promotional ploy: series of trading cards sponsored by major marketers who seek to augment their advertising pitches with colorful cardboard images of their products and services.


Ford Reports a $463 Million Profit for 3d Quarter
With profits in the United States at their highest level for the period since 1988, the Ford Motor Company today posted third-quarter earnings of $463 million, in contrast to a loss of $272 million during the quarter last year.
While Ford's stock surged immediately after the announcement, it receded a bit after Wall Street analysts looked more closely at the numbers.
In addition to a one-time favorable tax adjustment of $140 million, Ford's profits were buoyed by sales in Latin America, a market that some analysts consider too volatile to support investors' hopes for future prosperity.
Other analysts worried that Ford was continuing to cut the profit margins on its vehicles too fine.

Then they flew home, and at an afternoon news conference in Jacksonville, Weaver said: "We don't want to keep getting jerked around. It's unfair to change the rules at the 11th hour."


Classical Music in Review
Ned Rorem  New York Virtuoso Singers St. Peter's Lutheran Church
Between works at a concert celebrating his 70th birthday on Saturday evening, Ned Rorem reflected on his music in the impishly articulate way that has been his literary trademark ever since he published his first diaries.
Because the program was devoted to his choral music rather than to the art songs for which he is most renowned, he noted that about half his works were for chorus and that half of those were sacred settings.
What makes this peculiar, he added, is that he does not believe in God.
But he said that he did believe in belief and that he admired the poetry of believers.

Yeltsin Moves to Give Farm Lands to the Farmers
President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a decree today to allow farm workers to own and dispose of land freely.
Thus he lowered a major hurdle to reforming the Soviet system of large state or collective farms.
The move has been widely debated in the press as a compromise between conservatives' efforts to prevent the parceling out of the state-controlled farms and progressives' demands for a totally free market in land.


Lawyer Ties Man's Coma to Intern Stony Brook Dismissed
A 60-year-old man lapsed into a coma this month after he was sedated by an intern who was convicted of poisoning six people in 1985, the patient's lawyer said today.
The account came just one day after hospital officials asserted that no harm had come to any of the 147 patients treated by the intern, Michael Swango, before he was dismissed on Oct. 13.


Bonnett to Announce Another Comeback
NEIL BONNETT, who suffered a serious head injury in a 1990 wreck and then crashed again in a comeback bid this year, plans to drive in five races during the 1994 Nascar Winston Cup season.
Bonnett said he would announce his plans today at Phoenix International Raceway, where qualifying for the Slick 50 500 begins tomorrow.


AT HOME WITH: John Gielgud; His Own Brideshead, His Fifth 'Lear'
SIR JOHN GIELGUD is surrounded by echoes and reverberations from his past.
A long afternoon's conversation in his baronial home flows from Kenneth Branagh to Sarah Bernhardt, doubling around two world wars and crisscrossing a lifetime in the theater.
With his precise, vivid memory, he carries with him the history of the English theater in the 20th century.
The actor's fifth "King Lear," in a radio production directed by Kenneth Branagh, is scheduled to be broadcast by the BBC on April 14, Sir John's 90th birthday.
Other plans are afoot to honor him that day, including a tribute at the Haymarket Theater in London, all of which he has actively discouraged: "I said, don't celebrate. If I can manage to go on working, it's much more interesting. One of the things one does enjoy in old age is being able to make excuses not to do things you don't want to do."


Daily News Backs Giuliani
Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday won the endorsement of the editorial page of The Daily News, his first from a major daily newspaper.
Mayor David N. Dinkins got the support of the editorial page of the city's leading Spanish-language newspaper, El Diario-La Prensa.
The Daily News said that Mr. Dinkins has not earned four more years in office.

Book on Nazi Murder Industry Stirs French Storm
Jean-Claude Pressac, the local pharmacist in this village near Paris, is a singular man.
Contrarian by nature, he is as obsessed by the technical specifications of Nazi gas chambers as others are by the human suffering that took place within them.
Now Mr.
Pressac's intense interest in the industrial aspects of the Holocaust has placed him at the center of a storm.
His recently published book, "The Auschwitz Crematoria: The Machinery of Mass Slaughter," has been alternately hailed in France as the definitive account of how the Nazis installed and operated their instruments of murder, and vilified as the barren ruminations of a man with a twisted need to prove the massacre of Jews that he once doubted.


N.H.L. Pumps All-Star Game
In an effort to improve the intensity of competition in the annual All-Star game, the National Hockey League announced yesterday a winner-take-all format for prize money in this season's game, to be played at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, Jan. 22.
Each player on the winning side will get $5,000, according to Commissioner Gary Bettman, who appeared at a Garden news conference to open the fan balloting officially.

Some people think the Santa Ana winds are named for Satan, from the Spanish word 'satanas.' They are not, but as millions of Southern Californians know, they easily could be.
Named for Santa Ana Canyon south of Los Angeles, where early settlers first observed them, the winds are most common in the fall.

CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: Financing the Plan; The Difference 6 Weeks Make: Revisions in Costs
The biggest differences between the health care plan President Clinton invited Congress to ponder six weeks ago and the bill he offered today are financial, reflecting an effort to avoid a repetition of the huge cost increases that have characterized Medicare since its was enacted in 1965.
The changes were meant to reassure likely supporters of the bill who were suspicious of the plan's financial underpinnings, and they brought one quick and important change of tune.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee and who called the first version of the proposal "fantasy," said today, "I'm much more satisfied."


Tapes Depict Proposal to Thwart Bomb Used in Trade Center Blast
Law-enforcement officials were told that terrorists were building a bomb that was eventually used to blow up the World Trade Center, and they planned to thwart the plotters by secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, an informer said after the blast.
The informer was to have helped the plotters build the bomb and supply the fake powder, but the plan was called off by an F.B.I. supervisor who had other ideas about how the informer, Emad A. Salem, should be used, the informer said.


Belfast Observes a Day of Funerals and Fear
A solitary bagpiper marched ahead of a hearse, playing an Irish lament.
The coffin inside was draped with the Irish tricolor, topped with gloves and a black beret, signifying that the deceased was a member of the banned Irish Republican Army.
Not that anyone in Belfast didn't already know.
Thomas Begley, a 22-year-old I.R.A. volunteer and a Roman Catholic, was buried today amid a panoply of honors and under heavy security.
So were five other people, all Protestants, who were in a fish shop on Shankill Road on Saturday when Mr.
Begley entered disguised as a delivery boy, carrying a bomb.
So was a 72-year-old man, shot in his home by Protestant gunmen on a retaliatory murder spree that has taken four victims over the last 72 hours.

Postmaster, Beware, A Revolt Is Brewing
To the Editor:
A new streamlined eagle logo for the United States Postal Service with a price tag of $6.7 million fails to excite my imagination or give me confidence that the post office has service or its customers on its agenda.
To a Postal Service counting a deficit of $500 million, $6.7 million may not be a lot of money, but it could buy a lot of 29 cent stamps or pay the salaries of perhaps 15,000 more postal workers.


Paramount Suitor Blasts Bell Atlantic's Cable Bid
Even for Washington, it was an unlikely alliance.
One of the Senate's fiercest critics of big business, the Ohio Democrat Howard M. Metzenbaum, teamed with the man seeking to acquire Paramount Communications in order to warn about "mega-mergers" in the communications industry.
Leading a hearing of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on anti-trust issues, Senator Metzenbaum charged that Bell Atlantic Corporation's $32 billion deal to buy Tele-Communications Inc. would create a "colossus" and a "mega-monster" that would stifle competition in the industry.


The Simple Logic of School Choice
Next Tuesday, voters in California will express their opinions on the most important public policy issue since the Voting Rights Act.
The issue is school choice.
The California Teachers Association has spent more than $12 million on political advertising to defeat Proposition 174, an initiative that would enable parents to receive financial help from the government if they chose to send their children to nonpublic schools.

Nassau Candidates Dispute County's Present and Future
In a debate that presented two starkly different visions of Nassau County, the Democratic and Republican candidates for county executive clashed today over the state of the county's economy and who should be blamed for high taxes.
Throughout the two-hour debate, Thomas S. Gulotta, the incumbent Republican, maintained that Nassau had the region's lowest unemployment rate and one of the lowest crime rates in the nation.
He said high property taxes were largely the fault of the school districts and the state government's failure to give Long Island its fair share of education money.


A Heroine for the Arts?
To the Editor:
Maybe the actress and leading lady Jane Alexander, in her new role as chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, will be a heroine for the arts, a Leonora to the rescue, like the heroine of Beethoven's "Fidelio," who freed her husband from a dungeon. (Trumpet, please.) Here in Buffalo, where our symphony orchestra is playing, but fighting for its life (and there are other American orchestras in intensive-care wards), it somehow is small comfort that Ms.
Alexander's idea of arts education for schoolchildren goes beyond carving pumpkins for Halloween and dressing up as Easter bunnies.
What are the arts, anyway?

Block Cutler's Role in a Retrial, U.S. Urges
Federal prosecutors have moved to prevent Bruce Cutler, who used to be John Gotti's lawyer, from representing an accused Gambino crime family member on drug smuggling and racketeering charges.
The case against Thomas Gambino; his brother, Joseph, and three associates went to trial once before in Federal District Court in Manhattan, with Mr.
Cutler representing Joseph Gambino, and prosecutors want to keep him from taking part in a retrial.
In the first trial, which ended last June, the jury found the Gambinos guilty of bail-jumping, but it deadlocked on the most serious charges.


Bangles for Bowser
IN 1970, the jewelry designer Robert Lee Morris took a leather collar made for a calf and adapted it to fit his Great Dane.
More recently, his boxer, Pinky (below), and his Boston terrier, Chet, inspired a new collection of collars and leashes.
"Maybe the dog collars are the reason I got into jewelry in the first place," Mr.
Morris said.


Stand Up to Senator Packwood
Nearly a year after publicly confessing to wrongful sexual conduct over many years, Senator Bob Packwood clings to his office and party position, forcing a laborious ethics investigation.
Now, in a new display of shamelessness, he has brought the Senate Ethics Committee to an impasse, insisting on his right to define and contain the committee's inquiry.
The Ethics Committee, showing unusual bipartisan vigor, voted 6 to 0 last week to subpoena contested volumes of personal diaries -- which the Oregon Republican first brought to the committee's attention -- and he has refused to comply.
But the full Senate hesitates to act on the committee's reasonable request to authorize court enforcement of its subpoena.
Apparently many senators fear, thanks to threatening and unseemly comments by Mr.
Packwood, that the diaries implicate other members in indiscretions.

Review/Dance; Movement and Sound In Fluid Collaboration
The works that Wichern/Wolfson Dance and Music offered on Sunday night at the Merce Cunningham Studio occasionally went awry.
That didn't seriously matter.
The group remained worth watching and listening to because of the close collaborative harmony between its directors, Lynn Wichern, a choreographer, and David Wolfson, a composer.
Ms.
Wichern was at her best in evocative small-scale dances.
And Mr.
Wolfson's scores both intensified the choreographic moods and sounded musically inventive in their own right.


Meyer Halperin, 91; Aided Jewish Causes

Central Park Reservoir to Stay as Is; New York Is to Leave It Undeveloped, Home to Waterfowl
The Dinkins administration has come up with a plan for the soon-to-close Central Park Reservoir, which holds one billion gallons of water, cools Manhattan's muggy core on superheated days and has invisibly fed the island's thirst for 131 years.
The city has decided to do nothing. And apparently parkgoers like it that way.
Last May, the city announced that it would stop pumping drinking water from the 106-acre reservoir this year because it was no longer needed and because of growing concerns by Federal environmental officials about the potential for contamination.
Since then, the city Department of Parks and Recreation has received a flood of letters urging that it not fill in the reservoir for more ball fields, meadows or paths.
Decision Made With Little Debate
Today, officials from various city agencies are scheduled to gather at the reservoir's sylvan shore to sign an agreement to preserve the park's largest body of water basically as it is: as a home to cormorants and ducks that is encircled with a 1.58-mile path for jogging and walking.


CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: The Overview; CONGRESS IS GIVEN CLINTON PROPOSAL FOR HEALTH CARE
After nine months of brainstorming and politicking, President Clinton delivered to Congress today a 240,000-word proposal for universal health insurance.
It represents the most complex, detailed legislative blueprint devised by any President.
The document provides scores of details that were not available in White House documents or speeches by Administration officials over the last nine months.

Ailing Coleman Returns, but Only for a Seat on Bench
Derrick Coleman came home tonight, but he didn't get a chance to eat any home cooking or to play any basketball at the Palace.
Instead, he remained in street clothes on the Nets' bench and watched his New Jersey teammates even their preseason record at 3-3 with a 90-84 victory over the Detroit Pistons.
"I'm O.K. now and I'll be back with the team for practice on Friday," said Coleman, who grew up in Detroit and who has missed the Nets' last four preseason games with a wisdom tooth problem that resulted in an extraction three days ago.


Giants' Revived Defense Catches Carolina's Eye
Although former Washington Coach Joe Gibbs seems to be the leading candidate to coach the Carolina Panthers, the expansion team is covering all the bases during its search.
And one person who appears to be under consideration for the job is Mike Nolan, the Giants' defensive coordinator.
"From what I've heard and seen I think Mike Nolan is an excellent coach," Mike McCormack, Carolina's general manager, said today in a telephone interview.
"I think he could be a good coach for us, but it's too early to tell now. We have a lot of time to make decisions about these things."


Mason Makes Haste After Slow Start in Knick Preseason
During training camp, Pat Riley said a few players did not report in the shape that he expected.
Anthony Mason admitted he was one of those players.
"I didn't come back in the best shape that I could've come back in," Mason said before the Knicks' 76-75 loss to the San Antonio Spurs tonight.
"I got complacent, enjoyed life for a minute, did some things I hadn't been able to do before. Thanks to the Knicks, I could do them. It was a learning experience.

NEW CANADA PARTY SURGES IN ELECTION
A new political party has come storming out of the Canadian west, riding some of the same gusts that Ross Perot rode as an independent candidate in last year's American Presidential election.
The Reform Party, building on anti-tax sentiment, strong feelings against immigrants and traditional opposition to Ottawa-based politicians, virtually swept Canada's two most western provinces, taking 46 of 58 Parliamentary seats in British Columbia and Alberta on Monday.


Dinkins Uplift, Giuliani Grit: 2 Advertising Schools Battle
David N. Dinkins opened his television advertising campaign with a "Heartbeat of America"-style commercial complete with rousing music.
Rudolph W. Giuliani began with a grainy, low-key ad that looked as if it had absorbed its grittiness from the streets of New York.
Next, the Dinkins campaign broadcast advertisements extolling the Mayor's accomplishments in warm, lofty images.
The Giuliani campaign came back with ads featuring ordinary people.
Clash Between Ad Styles
Then Mr.
Dinkins attacked with negative ads, accusing Mr.
Giuliani of fighting against "everything we stand for." The Giuliani campaign countered with the candidate's wife charging the Mayor with race-baiting.


QVC Is Considering Its Next Move
The QVC Network took its fight for Paramount Communications Inc. directly to shareholders yesterday, but almost as soon as it did, it was considering replacing its $9.6 billion bid with a better one.
People close to the QVC camp say the company is assessing its options.
But several merger experts said if QVC increased its offer, the company would probably not do so for at least nine business days for tactical reasons.
That might force Viacom, the competing bidder, into a position of having to extend its own tender offer and postpone completing the deal if it chose to match a higher offer.
Viacom also has a nearly $10 billion offer on the table.
Both bids are valued at $80 a share.

Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday accused Mayor David N. Dinkins of making appointments based primarily on race and ethnicity, and said that as mayor, he would make all appointments based on merit, "irrespective of race, religion, ethnic background and sexual orientation."
At a news conference at his headquarters at 415 Madison Avenue, near 50th Street, he suggested that the Mayor was preoccupied with diversity and had made decisions at the expense of general competence.


Thousands Flee As Brush Fires Rake California
Driven by hot gusty winds from the desert, at least a dozen brush fires roared out of control today across Southern California, damaging or destroying hundreds of homes and forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate.
The fires spread ominously all day, leaping canyons and brush-covered hills, consuming expensive homes and trailer parks alike in six counties from Ventura to the Mexican border.
A smoky pall wafted over downtown Los Angeles, where ashes fell like snow all day.


Gun Bill Is Unsnagged, Making Passage More Likely
A pivotal House chairman who opposes a bill that would enhance controls on the sale of handguns has nonetheless made its enactment far more likely by agreeing to strip it from a much larger anticrime package that has been stalled in Congress for almost two years.
The lawmaker, Representative Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, relented late Tuesday to the intense pressure of Democratic colleagues who favor the gun-control legislation, known as the Brady bill.


Corrections
An article in Business Day on Oct. 20, about plans by Pfizer Inc., the American Cyanamid Company and the Upjohn Company to eliminate a total of 7,000 jobs, misstated the number of manufacturing jobs lost in New York City since 1987.
It is about 94,000, not 270,000.


Economic Scene; The earnings gap grows, within professions and among them.
IN 1990 the average take-home of the partners in the law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore exceeded the total salaries of all nine members of the Supreme Court.
Chief executives of the Fortune 500 did pretty well that year, too, netting an average of $1.4 million -- roughly 40 times the average for public school teachers.
O.K., O.K, it is getting harder to work up a lather over such familiar outrages.
But the source of these numbers, Derek Bok's new book, "The Cost of Talent," (The Free Press) offers more than a rehash of the old stuff.

An appeals court in Luxembourg rejected a key part of the liquidation plan for the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International today, throwing into disarray efforts to compensate the institution's 550,000 depositors and other creditors worldwide.
The ruling came as a shock to depositors and to the bank's court-appointed liquidators, Touche Ross &amp; Company, which had previously won approval for the plan from regulators and courts in Britain and the Cayman Islands, where portions of the fraud-ridden institution were based.

Market Place; ICN Pharmaceuticals offers a double bet for investors.
INVESTING in ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., currently the object of a proxy struggle between its incumbent management and Rafi M. Khan, a California stockbroker, is sort of like betting the daily double at the local race track.
As where horses (or dogs) are concerned, the gamble does not pay off unless the bettor correctly picks the winners of two consecutive races.
In the first half of this particular double, investors are being asked to bet that bullets and bombs will give way to partnership and that United Nations sanctions will turn into trade alliances.
The second half is a bet that the Food and Drug Administration will approve ICN's antiviral drug, ribavirin, as a treatment for hepatitis C.


Merck Plans Stock-Option Gift for Staff
Merck &amp; Company, the world's largest drug maker, said yesterday that it would give each of its 37,000 employees an option to buy 300 shares of Merck's common stock at $32.50 a share.
The stock could not be purchased until Oct. 20, 1998.
Nearly all large companies give stock options to executives, but Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., is one of only about 30 large companies that give options to all employees.


Connecticut Biotech Concern Names Chief
The Neurogen Corporation said yesterday that it was naming Harry H. Penner Jr., an experienced pharmaceutical deal maker, as president and chief executive, effective Dec. 1.

Making Car Theft More Difficult
THE purpose of technology is usually to make life easier.
In the case of car security, the opposite is true; the purpose is to make life more difficult -- for car thieves.
What used to be merely a matter of placing a siren under the hood has become a high-tech game of cat-and-mouse between a car thief and a car owner.
There are security systems as simple as the Club, a steering wheel locking device that sells for about $40, and as complex as systems that track a stolen car and call the police, which can sell for as much as $2,000.

Beginning his 60th-birthday celebration at Alice Tully Hall, John Browning played on Monday night with and without the accompaniment of the Juilliard Orchestra under the direction of Leonard Slatkin.

But the playing was impressive throughout, at times quite masterly.


Candidates Debate Budget in Battle for Westchester Executive
As the race for Westchester County Executive enters its final days, even a strictly controlled League of Women Voters forum can turn into a rough-and-tumble debate, the incumbent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, and his challenger, state Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, showed here tonight.
Given no time for opening statements and restricted to answering issue-oriented questions posed by the League and members of the audience, Mr.
Brodsky, a Democrat from Greenburgh, quickly turned his comments on his opponent, suggesting that the solution to nearly every problem in Westchester lay in replacing its chief executive.


Schiller Interviewed for Commissioner
HARVEY SCHILLER, executive director of the United States Olympic Committee since 1990, has been interviewed for the vacant job of commissioner, a person familiar with the search process said last night.
Schiller, 53, a Brooklyn native who worked as a vendor at Ebbet's Field as a teen-ager, did not seek the job, but was approached by the owners' search committee, the person said.

Last year, Hasbro sponsored a marathon, "The Great American Toon-In," on Turner networks in the United States on the day after Thanksgiving.
This year, on Nov. 26, Hasbro will sponsor "The Great International Toon-In" in more than 55 countries in North America, Latin America and Europe.

Critic's Notebook; Up-to-Date Promotion For the Biblical 'Cave'
"The Cave" has come and gone at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, but rest assured: music lovers have not seen the last of it.
This merger of video and music by Beryl Korot and Steve Reich has already cut its swath through one American city and four in Europe.
Brussels is coming up, and hotly in pursuit are Lisbon, Rome, Turin, Hong Kong, again London and various points in Japan.
The composer and image maker have explained the moment and the meaning of "The Cave" at the Whitney Museum and will do the same on Nov. 9 at the Jewish Museum.
A recording will be released next year on Nonesuch, and a single-channel video is being vigorously pursued despite the costs.
Included in all this activity is not only an event but also a new set of ideas.
Indeed, "The Cave" has been described as "one of the most radical redefinitions of opera the waning century has witnessed." Having seen it in Brooklyn and read a lot about its past and future, I find it hard to disagree, although at moments I wish I could.

Dow Drops 7.83 Points, Closing at 3,664.66
The economic news was encouraging yesterday, but investors apparently needed a little more convincing.
They sent confused signals in a fragmented stock market, bidding up small companies while shunning some industrial powerhouses that might be expected to profit from a spurt in the recovery.
Despite the Government's announcement that September durable- goods orders rose, blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average gave up more of the gains of Monday, when the index hit a new high.
Other indexes were only slightly stronger, though the Nasdaq composite rose sharply, lifted by technology issues.


Bombay Co.
Shares of the Bombay Company, a furniture retailer based in Fort Worth, rebounded yesterday after slumping in recent weeks.
Analysts attributed the earlier decline to investors' cashing in on gains in the stock, which had been performing well because of the company's strong earnings.


3 Artists Who Left A Fainter Impression
More than a century after Impressionism revolutionized painting, the names that still personify that movement -- Monet, Manet, Pissarro, Sisley, Degas, Renoir and others -- are without exception those of men.
At best, it seems, the role of women was merely to pose for them.
Yet, while overshadowed by these modern masters in both their lifetimes and in the history of art, a handful of women in late-19th-century Paris refused to be just domestic or studio accessories.
They too wanted to paint, and did so successfully.
Posterity, though, has barely recognized them.


Senate Approves Jobless Aid But Attaches Two Conditions
The Senate voted today to renew a two-year-old program that grants up to 13 extra weeks of checks to jobless workers who exhaust their normal unemployment benefits.
But the Senate did so only after tacking conditions to the renewal that confounded its prospects in the House.
The measure now goes to a House-Senate conference, where lawmakers from both chambers will try to agree on a version of the bill that each side can pass and send to the White House.


On Stage, and Off
The Mystery of Staying Power
Anyone looking at the raw figures might be puzzled as to why "Wonderful Tennessee," which earned $161,423 at the box office last week, filling 73 percent of the available seats at the Plymouth Theater, is closing on Sunday while "The Twilight of the Golds," which earned only $96,092 and filled 68 percent of the seats at the Booth, is, for the time being anyway, hanging on.
The explanation is that although potential audiences for "Tennessee" were eager enough to supply the play with a substantial advance sale, the drop at the box office when the reviews came out -- they weren't terrible, just reserved -- was immediate and huge.
Fans of the Irish playwright Brian Friel and his lyrical, understated, obliquely emotional dramas, the theory goes, had already bought their tickets; his reputation had carried the play as far as it was going to, and the show needed the buzz of critical rapture to assume the burden, as it had with Mr.
Friel's previous Broadway offering, "Dancing at Lughnasa." On Monday, however, the day after "Tennessee" opened, less than $8,000 worth of tickets was sold, a dooming total for a show with weekly operating costs of more than $135,000.
Neither the producer, Noel Pearson, nor the general manager, Joseph Harris, responded to repeated phone messages, but Mr.
Pearson acknowledged to Variety early in the week that after the reviews, "it was deader than a dodo."


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Courier and Becker Fall  Marc Rosset, ranked 21st in the world, used a powerful serve-and-volley game to upset No. 2-seeded Jim Courier by 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) yesterday in the $1.65 million Stockholm Open.
No. 3 Boris Becker, a three-time champion here, and No. 5 Sergi Bruguera were also eliminated in the third round.
Carlos Costa of Spain, ranked 30th in the world, knocked off No. 1 Pete Sampras in three sets in a second-round match that ended just before midnight Wednesday.
MaliVai Washington beat Becker by 6-1, 6-3 to join Rosset in the quarterfinals.
Becker, who won the Stockholm Open in 1988 and 1990-91, dropped his serve twice in each set against Washington.
Bruguera, the French Open champion from Spain, lost by 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 to Jonas Svensson of Sweden.
For Becker, it was the fourth consecutive time that he made an early exit in an ATP tournament.

He has China in mind.


Let Cambodians Have Justice at Last
To the Editor:
The United Nations has held elections in Cambodia.
Sihanouk is king again, and the United Nations is leaving.
But the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, who oversaw 1.5 million deaths from 1975 to 1979, still poses a threat.

Corrections
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about infrastructure issues and the New York City mayoral race omitted the first name of Rudolph W. Giuliani's issues director, who discussed recycling and the management of the Sanitation Department.
He is Richard J. Schwartz. (A former city transportation official who was quoted earlier in the article, about infrastructure maintenance, was Samuel I. Schwartz.)


QVC Asks Court to Block Paramount-Viacom Merger
QVC Network Inc. asked the Delaware courts yesterday to block Paramount Communications Inc. from completing its friendly merger with Viacom Inc.
In yesterday's action, which had been widely expected in the battle for Paramount, the Delaware Chancery Court was asked for a preliminary injunction that would stop Viacom's proposed $10 billion tender offer for Paramount and remove what QVC sees as serious barriers to an open bidding contest.


Triborough Bonds' Top Yield 5.293%
The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York sold $173.1 million of general purpose tax-exempt revenue bonds with a maximum yield of about 5.293 percent for an issue due in 2020 through underwriters led by CS First Boston.
For investors in a 31-percent tax bracket the bond equivalent yield is about 7.67 percent.
Investor demand for the issue allowed the underwriters to lower yields on some short maturities by about 10 basis points, while shortening the maturity on one long-term issue and adding another long maturity.
A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.


Americans Would Hail Laws on Movie Violence; Glorified Mayhem
To the Editor:
Re "Janet Reno's Heavy Hand" (editorial, Oct. 22):
In denouncing the prospect of censorship, you state there was violence on the screen in the Keystone Kops, so why be concerned about televised violence today?
I never knew anyone who aspired to be a Keystone Kop.


Weekend Starts Now for Big East Laggards
Almost from the day this game was scheduled, Pittsburgh Coach Johnny Majors complained.
He complained that a Thursday night game came too quickly on the heels of a grueling game against West Virginia.
And Majors felt a midweek night game would throw the Panthers out of their rhythm.
Well, the Panthers were definitely out of sync this evening -- and for Pitt fans, it was a welcome change of pace.
Pittsburgh broke a six-game losing streak and captured its first Big East victory by shellacking Rutgers, 21-10, before a crowd of 20,130 at Giants Stadium.


Pianist in Debut
The pianist Myron Silberstein is to make his New York debut tomorrow at 8:30 P.M. at Weill Recital Hall.

Tickets are $15.
Information: (212) 247-7800.


COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Dartmouth
Harvard comes to Hanover, N.H., tomorrow in the 97th meeting of an Ivy League rivalry that began in 1882.
Two of the league's best quarterbacks, Jay Fiedler of the Green and Mike Giardi of the Crimson, will duel for the third and last time.
Two years ago, the two teams played to a 31-31 tie and last season the Green won, 31-7.
Fiedler, armed with stronger supporting casts, has played on teams that have won 14 Ivy League games, lost two and tied one plus two championships.
The Giardi-Harvard teams are 8-8-1 in Ivy play over three seasons.


In Praise of the Tuba
The Cuervo Oct-Tuba Fest, a monthlong festival of events celebrating the tuba, closes today with a free concert at noon on the main concourse of Grand Central Station.
For the event, 150 tubas, led by Harvey Phillips, will perform a wide variety of music, including an audience sing-along for which buttons and kazoos will be distributed.


London Journal; f Churchill Could Hear, Would He Shed a Tear?
Here in the land of Shakespeare and Churchill, where even the boys in the cheap seats can spot the difference between your well-oiled peroration and just so much rodomontade, the question of the moment is wholly rhetorical: Has Britain's vaunted tradition of oratory gone the way of Empire?
Or, in a manner of speaking, does it just sound that way?
In letters to the editor, in newspaper columns and in broadcast interviews, pundits and earnest listeners have rushed to the ramparts.
They were goaded by what they heard and saw during Britain's annual political conference season, three weeks of nearly nonstop oratory -- much of its televised -- delivered by the greater and lesser lights of the nation's three major parties.
A Common Lament
Now that it is over, the questions hang thickly in the word-fogged air: whatever became of the blood, toil, tears and sweat of the past?
Was this really their finest hour?


Fairchild Plans to Convert Plant Into a Shopping Mall
The Fairchild Corporation announced plans today to redevelop the abandoned 80-acre aircraft plant from which thousands of fighter planes rolled off the assembly line during World War II.
The company described it as one of the largest military conversion projects on Long Island.
The cavernous hangars, loading docks and graffiti-covered office complex will be torn down and replaced by a shopping mall with three major retailers and scores of specialty stores.


Couple Races the Inferno, and Wins
Lorine Cecere was married just last month, and the wedding pictures and honeymoon postcards from Tahiti still lie scattered on the kitchen counter of her mother's sprawling three-story house in the exclusive Emerald Bay enclave here.
She moved from the house so recently that the 28-year-old Mrs.
Cecere still thinks of it as home.
And so when fire roared through the canyon here on Wednesday, gobbling wooded acres and million-dollar houses, she and her husband, Vince, decided that they would do everything in their power to save it, no matter how foolhardy.


Two Top Manhattan Galleries Merge
In a merger that many in the art world will view as a marriage between an aristocrat and a brash upstart, Wildenstein &amp; Company has purchased 49 percent of the Pace Gallery.
The deal combines a 118-year-old international art gallery known for its exceptional inventory of blue-chip Old Master and Impressionist paintings with a 32-year-old gallery that has become a powerhouse in modern and contemporary art.
Mergers are highly unusual in the art world, especially ones that join two leading galleries run as family businesses and that cover totally different periods of art.
The new entity will be known as Pace/Wildenstein and it will be based at Pace's present gallery, 32 East 57th Street in Manhattan, said Arne Glimcher, the founder and president of Pace.
The exact terms of the financial agreement were not disclosed by either gallery.


Dinkins Retains Financing From Groups of 4 Years Ago
Although Mayor David N. Dinkins has spent much of his re-election campaign trying to hold together the fragile coalition of voters that elected him in 1989, he seems to have had little trouble retaining the financial support of the alliance of Manhattan liberals, real-estate developers, Wall Street executives and black business leaders who bankrolled him four years ago.
Despite polls hinting that the Mayor has lost some support among liberals, including Jewish liberals, campaign finance records show among his major fund-raisers many prominent Jewish residents of Manhattan, including Edgar Bronfman Jr., Bruce Ratner, Jack Rudin, Felix G. Rohatyn, Carl Spielvogel, Jonathan Tisch, Howard Rubenstein and Arthur Levitt.


Review/Theater; Shakespeare for These Times, With No Political Errors
In the Hartford Stage Company's reflective, politically circumspect production of "The Merchant of Venice," directed by Mark Lamos, the very mention of the word Jew can cause characters to cross themselves like Transylvanian peasants in the presence of a vampire.
Indeed, by the play's end, the cross itself has become a shiny symbol of Christian oppression and superstition.
It seems appropriate, therefore, that the play's most voluble exponent for Jews converting to Christianity, the servant Launcelot Gobbo, should be portrayed (by David Manis) as a lout in circus-clown makeup.
And the usurious Shylock, played with contained dignity and unexpected flashes of sentimentality by Mike Nussbaum, is clearly accorded the position of a man more sinned against than sinning.


For Children
'The Witch Who Was Afraid of Witches'
One Dream Theater  232 West Broadway (at North Moore Street)  TriBeCa  (212) 274-1450  Recommended ages: 4 to 10  Through Sunday
Wendy is the youngest of three sisters.
They and their parents are witches (well, Dad is technically a warlock).
This unusual family -- Mom wears a funereal veil, Dad is monklike in a hooded gown -- is dysfunctional at best.
This musical pits the older sisters against Wendy, who fights with all her might to get more witch power.
Only that will save her.


Haiti's Premier Says He Will Stay at His Post
Few people in Haiti were more attentive to the speech before the United Nations today by Haiti's exiled President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, than the Prime Minister appointed by Father Aristide one month ago, Robert Malval.
Squared off in a tense stalemate with Haiti's military leaders, who have refused to resign despite their pledges to do so, Mr.
Malval had suggested that this week would be his last as Prime Minister.


Westchester County Budget Unveiled and Assailed
Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, today presented a $1.25 billion budget proposal for next year that he said would hold taxes steady.
But his Democratic opponent, Richard L. Brodsky, promptly branded the document a "campaign press release" that in fact raised taxes.
Mr.
O'Rourke has always disclosed budget proposals on Nov. 15, but this year he unveiled a summary two weeks earlier in the hope that news of stable property taxes might sway voters in a a hard-fought contest.


Aristide Asks U.N. to Place A Total Embargo on Haiti
The deposed President of Haiti called on the United Nations today to impose a total trade embargo on his country to force its military rulers to resign.
He also said he would not return there or ask Parliament to approve an amnesty for his opponents until they surrendered power.
But at the urging of the United States, the Security Council is expected to move cautiously toward new sanctions, both to allow more time for a negotiated settlement and to try to avoid the devastating effect a complete economic blockade could have on what is already one of the world's poorest countries, diplomats said.


Ex-Florio Foe Claims Slander by Whitman
John Budzash, the former postal worker who gained prominence as a leader of the public uprising against Gov.
Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase, couldn't get on the ballot this year but he is tangled up in the race for governor, nonetheless.
On Wednesday, Mr.
Budzash endorsed Mr.
Florio, the candidate he once tried to chase from office.
Today he filed a $1 million lawsuit against Christine Todd Whitman, alleging that she had slandered him in questioning his motivation for backing Mr.
Florio.


Review/Film; A Lust for the (Supposedly) Lifeless
Q.
When your girlfriend develops long metal claws, glass spikes sticking out of her shoulders and a craving for human flesh, what time is it?
A.
Time to get a new girlfriend.
Or at least it ought to be for Curt Reynolds (J. Trevor Edmond) once his beloved Julie (Mindy Clarke) begins exhibiting these and other telltale signs of trouble.
But "Return of the Living Dead 3" is an "I'm O.K., You're Undead" love story in which Curt and Julie just can't quit.
Not even after Julie is killed in a motorcycle crash, which would seem like a natural time to say goodbye.


Specialist Keeps Hearth A Safe, Cozy Retreat
AUTUMN returns, and so, too, must Fred Heinrich.
Mr.
Heinrich has come to inspect your firebox, ash pit, damper, smoke chamber, flue tiles, mortar, flashing and spark arrester, if there is one.
He will remove unwanted raccoons from the smoke shelf, and remind you not to chuck apple cores or decorative plastic mistletoe into the family hearth.
He can be in and out in an hour, leaving not one sooty fingerprint.
And when, in his pleasant baritone, he speaks those reassuring words, "see you next year," you feel a surge of pride and security in home ownership, as if the Marcus Welby of chimney sweeps had pronounced you cured of hazardous creosote buildup.


Wingtip 'Cowboys' in Last Stand To Hold On to Low Grazing Fees
For more than a week, the Senate has been tied up in a filibuster led by Westerners opposed to President Clinton's plan to raise grazing fees on public land.
What is at stake, some senators say, is the very survival of a vanishing way of life.
As Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming said, higher prices would "do those old cowboys in."
But a review of the top 500 holders of grazing permits on Federal land shows that many of those "old cowboys" are more likely to wear wingtips than boots.
They include the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, with 800,000 acres under its control; the Mormon Church; a Japanese conglomerate; the Nature Conservancy, and some of the wealthiest families in the nation.
The top 10 percent of the permit holders, not all of which oppose fee increases, control about half of the nation's public grazing land, according to Interior Department figures.
Only 12 percent of the permit holders are listed by the Government as small operators.
Baucus Has Interest
Also, the beneficiaries of the low grazing fees include families of at least one of the senators now tying up the Senate -- Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana.
Mr.
Baucus said he has "a very small financial interest" in the ranch run by his brother John on Federal land near Helena, and that it should not disqualify him from the debate.


Review/Art; High-Tech Razzle-Dazzle And State-of-the-Art Art
For many artists, the idea of applying advanced technology to the task of making art, whether to throw light on the workings of industrial society or simply to open up new esthetic territory, continues to exert a strong imaginative pull.
The latest evidence of this is offered by "Iterations," an ambitious if ultimately disappointing show now at the midtown branch of the International Center of Photography.
Made with computers, video and other electronic equipment, the works here offer tantalizing hints of the impact that machines of this sort may have on art.
But for all the electronic razzle-dazzle on display, the most successful pieces here tend to take a somewhat jaundiced view of the technology on which they are based.


Giuliani on Education: Back to Basics
ON THE SCREEN: Rudolph W. Giuliani talking into the camera, wearing a green windbreaker at John Jay Park on the Upper East Side as children play in the background.
As he talks, footage of him with interracial group of teenagers at his alma mater, Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn, then more footage listening to mothers and children in the park.
Various titles appear on the screen: "High educational standards for all public schools," "Budget reform so more money goes to classrooms." "Crime and drug free zones to make schools safer." At end, Mr.
Giuliani's face is inset in bright blue field, above the tagline "Rudy Giuliani, The Best Hope for New York," one of several slogans his campaign has used.

Small Firms Flock to Big-Time Street
Call them the little law firms that could.
They could move to lustrous Manhattan addresses like Park Avenue when large firms, seeking larger spaces, moved out and commercial real estate rents moved down.
"There is no question regarding the allure of a Park Avenue location," said Robert S. Churchill, a managing partner at Gerstein &amp; Churchill, whose five lawyers and six staff members moved from 342 Madison Avenue to 300 Park, between 49th and 50th Streets, in 4,649 square feet of what used to be Proskauer Rose Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn space.
"It is less congested than most midtown streets. There is ample access to Grand Central Station for commuters; it's convenient for our clients, and it feels safe."


Doris Duke, 80, Heiress Whose Great Wealth Couldn't Buy Happiness, Is Dead
Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress and philanthropist whose bittersweet life was woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness, died yesterday at her house in Beverly Hills, Calif.
She was 80 and had her main residence in Somerset County, N.J.
She also had homes on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in Newport, R.I., and Hawaii.
The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Bernard Lafferty, a friend and adviser to Miss Duke who was with her at her death.


Brooklyn Court Experiment Putting Cases on Fast Track
In the New York City criminal courts, delay is a hallowed tactic.
Witnesses disappear, memories fade, as prosecutors and, particularly, defense lawyers try to wear one another down.
Judges grimace but grant new dates.
A murder case often takes 35 court appearances and a year and a half to resolve.
But last week Judge Neil Jon Firetog of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn had what he thinks is the most extraordinary day of his 10 years on the bench: of the nine felony cases before him, eight defendants accepted the plea agreements offered by prosecutors and a firm trial date was set for the ninth.
"I never had such a day," said the judge, who is still incredulous.
"All day long it was like a nonstop Honda commercial: 'We'll take it, we'll take it!' "


Race for Public Advocate Viewed for Mayoral Effect
The race for Public Advocate is not considered much of a contest -- the polls put the Democrat Mark J. Green far ahead of the Republican-Liberal candidate, Councilwoman Susan D. Alter -- but it is being viewed with interest because of its possible impact on the mayoral race.
Mr.
Green, the city's former consumer affairs commissioner, has had overwhelming leads in every poll, and his election is considered a foregone conclusion by most politicians and analysts.
But his whirlwind campaign, in which he travels the city in a blue van, could have additional impact because Mr.
Green, a Jewish resident of the Upper East Side, could persuade a number of voters disenchanted with Mayor David N. Dinkins -- particularly liberal Jewish ones -- to vote for Mr.
Dinkins.


Slain Hasid's Brother Says Reno Lags on Crown Hts.
The brother of the Hasidic scholar slain in the 1991 racial violence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, met Attorney General Janet Reno today to press his demand for a Federal inquiry into the disturbance, but said afterward that he had received only "bland and noncommittal" assurances on the matter.
The brother, Norman Rosenbaum, said at a news conference in the Capitol that the brief meeting left him with "no real indication of the direction of any investigation." The Republican Senator from New York, Alfonse M. D'Amato, who appeared with him before reporters, urged Ms.
Reno to name a special prosecutor to investigate the conduct of law-enforcement officials before and after the disturbances.

"While reviewing the diaries, the committee counsel came across information indicating possible misconduct by Senator Packwood unrelated to the current inquiry. This information raised questions about a possible violation of one or more laws, including criminal laws." RICHARD H. BRYAN, Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee.  [ A1:4. ]


Art in Review
Loren MacIver
Terry Dintenfass Gallery  50 West 57th Street  Manhattan  Through Nov. 6
This lovely show encompasses nearly 50 years of work by the 84-year-old Loren MacIver.
The earliest painting, "My House" (1936), is characteristic of much that follows.
Oil paint is handled with the discretion usually applied to pastel, and everyday life is transmuted into the emblematic.
The house in her painting, for example, is a fantastic Klee-like interior of ramparts, pillars and arches, in which individual details -- a lamp, a mouse, a handful of candies, a window bright with daylight, another with the moon showing through -- float in a burnished, honey-colored glow.


Reviews/Film; Mix at Will: Basic, Fatal, Instinct and Attraction
"Fatal Instinct" is Carl Reiner's hit-or-miss film noir parody, a collection of gags that vary much too wildly in terms of timing and wit.
All that hold this comedy together are a playful outlook and a conviction that detective stories are intrinsically funny, especially if the detective is as much of a blockhead as Ned Ravine.
As played by Armand Assante, Ned is a bit too convincingly dense, but he does make a useful fall guy.
Even if Mr.
Assante doesn't approach the level of Leslie Nielsen's inspired obliviousness in the "Naked Gun" comedies, he can sound suitably solemn when delivering lines like: "Women are an open book. You know how to read 'em, you can always tell the apples from the peaches." The absurdity is heightened by the fact that Ned happens to be both a policeman and a lawyer (a situation that eventually yields the newspaper headline "Cop Arrests Wife in Murder -- Will Defend Her in Court").
He also happens to need cue cards to read suspects their Miranda rights when he arrests them.


Attempted Murder
To the Editor:
Re "Mayhem in Los Angeles" (editorial, Oct. 22): As I understand it, your defense of the ridiculously lenient verdict against Damian Williams in the Reginald Denny case centers on agreement with the defense argument that if Mr.
Williams had really wanted to kill Mr.
Denny, "he could have finished the job."
Think about this for a second.
The implications argue against virtually anyone's being charged with attempted murder because most perpetrators charged with this offense certainly have a chance to finish the job.
I'd also be willing to bet that Damian Williams thought the chances of Reginald Denny's surviving his vicious attack were little to none.
The liberal, left-wing bent of The Times editorial board gets more divorced from reality and more offensive daily.
TIMOTHY SCHILT  New York, Oct. 22, 1993


AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC. (N)
American International Group reported yesterday that its third-quarter net income rose 33 percent from a year earlier.
The worldwide insurer and financial services company earned $451 million, compared with $339 million in the quarter the previous year.
The company reported strong performance in its overseas general insurance business and its life insurance business, which includes a growing presence in China and Latin America.


COMPANY NEWS: Court Corks Saint Laurent; Champagne Makers Get No Kick From Perfume
After a bitter legal battle between the Champagne industry and a top name in French fashion, a court ruled here today that Champagne is Champagne and Yves Saint Laurent has no right to use the name for perfume.
The ruling, which ordered the confiscation and destruction of publicity and packaging for Yves Saint Laurent's new perfume, "Champagne," ended a court fight that began when the association of Champagne wine growers and three individual producers filed suit over use of the name.


Walter J. Gill; Real-Estate Broker, 81
Walter J. Gill, who spent more than four decades in the New Jersey real-estate business, died on Saturday at his home in Avon, N.J.
He was 81.
A native of Newark, Mr.
Gill retired in 1974 as director and president of the Alexander Summer Mortgage Company of Newark and Teaneck.
He was associated with the firm since its founding in 1947.


The Case of Game Balls That Angered a Coach
Mississippi State Coach JACKIE SHERRILL has confirmed that he complained about footballs used in the Bulldogs' game at Auburn on Oct. 9, but said he never accused the Tigers of using helium.
"I never asked the officials to check Auburn's ball for helium," Sherrill said Wednesday.
"The only thing I asked the officials to check is that the balls were not legally inflated. The facts are the balls were not legal balls. The facts are the balls were taken out of the game."


A Sex-Bias Case Is Lost By Goldman
A Federal jury yesterday found Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company guilty of sex discrimination for blocking the promotion of a female executive and then dismissing her after she dismissed a male subordinate.
But the status of the civil suit brought by the former executive, Joanne Flynn, was unclear after the verdict, because Kimba M. Wood, the presiding United States District Judge in Manhattan, was considering a defense motion to dismiss the case.
The motion was filed before the case went to the jury.


Another New Jersey Option: Throwing Them Out Sooner
Voters who are dissatisfied with their choices for governor this year have a safety valve on Tuesday's ballot, a measure that could enable them to change their minds down the road.
The measure, the only statewide referendum on the ballot this year, asks this question: Should the State Constitution be amended to allow the recall of all elected officials after at least a year in office?


ISRAEL SEEKS DEAL WITH QATAR ON GAS
Israeli officials say they have held secret negotiations with the tiny Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar on a multibillion-dollar project to bring natural gas to Israel and then export it across the Mediterranean to Europe.
The officials say they could sign an agreement by early December.
But Qatar's Oil Minister denied today that a deal was in the making, calling reports of an imminent breakthrough "unrealistic and based on illogical assumption." The Qatari news agency quoted him as saying economic relations are not possible while the Arab boycott against Israel remains intact.


Art in Review
Reinhard Mucha 'Collected Recollected'
Luhring Augustine  130 Prince Street  SoHo  Through Nov. 20
For much of the last decade, the sculptor Reinhard Mucha has been the great German hope, the artist deemed most likely to succeed Joseph Beuys and Anselm Kiefer in maintaining an appropriately dour, heavy German art.
He has also been notorious for playing hard to get, choosing his group exhibitions carefully and largely shunning New York galleries.


Review/Opera; Philip Glass Looks Back at Cocteau's 'Orphee'
"Orphee," Philip Glass's new chamber opera based on the film by Jean Cocteau, arrived at the Majestic Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night.
On the face of it, Mr.
Glass's two-act piece is an interpretation of an interpretation, a gloss on a gloss.
And indeed, there are places in it -- Orphee's pursuit of the Princess on the streets of Paris is one -- that mean little without the corresponding images created on film 43 years ago.
Condensing here, implying there, "Orphee" the opera follows the train of Cocteau's thoughts on a very ancient myth.
It uses much of his dialogue verbatim.
Yet in another sense, Mr.
Glass's piece is closer to Gluck than to Cocteau.
Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice," written in 1762, is opera's most prominent hommage to the Orpheus myth.
Although the new opera's reference to an old one is brief and fleeting, the flute solo with orchestra that announces the Princess's entrance from the Underworld seems, intentionally or not, more a comment on the music around it then a passing bow to history.

A Verdict on Kevorkian: Their Kind of Neighbor
Most everyone here in his hometown seems to like the man they call Dr.
Death, Jack Kevorkian, the thoughtful, neighborly retired pathologist.
He got the nickname decades ago as an iconoclastic medical resident interested in unusual experimentation.
But its current connotation of necromantic celebrity is rooted in his more recent mercy-suicide crusade, which, his neighbors are noting, he dared to bring right into his own small walk-up apartment last week in helping a sick and agonized woman from Ann Arbor kill herself right there, next to Mr.
B's Pub on South Main Street.


Dow Touches 3,700 During Record Day
Gobbling up the news of a jump in the nation's economic growth and strong corporate earnings, investors unleashed a broad rally in stocks yesterday that drove all the major indexes higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a gain of 23.20 points, to 3687.86, a record high for the second time this week.
It had crossed the psychological barrier of 3,700 around noon before settling back late in the afternoon.

Selig Still Doesn't Want To Be the Commissioner
With the names of supposedly prospective candidates beginning to surface, the man most baseball club owners want as their next commissioner reiterated yesterday that he does not want the job.
Despite reports to the contrary, Bud Selig said he has not changed his mind.
"That is absolutely not correct," said Selig, the acting commissioner, when told that people close to the owners said he was prepared to take the job.
"My position has not changed. I don't know why anyone would say it has, certainly not by anything I've said or done."


Firefighters Gain Footholds Amid Ashes
With a merciful slackening of winds and cooler air, fire crews began to gain some advantage today over 17 ruinous wildfires across Southern California.
But they were in a desperate race against time before the hot Santa Ana winds pick up again this weekend.
By this evening, the fires had consumed 135,000 acres, and 6,500 firefighters drawn from throughout the West battled to keep fire lines intact.
The inferno that damaged or destroyed 330 homes in Laguna Beach was contained by this evening, but a fire in Altadena, which has scorched more than 5,000 acres and engulfed 115 homes northwest of downtown Los Angeles, remains out of control.


Cox to Form a Tiger Fund
Archibald Cox Jr., former chief of CS First Boston, said yesterday that he had joined the Tiger Management Corporation, where he will be head of a new fund investing in companies in China, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
As chairman of the new Tiger International Fund, Mr.
Cox will start by helping raise money from investors and be responsible for investing up to $1 billion in companies in those markets.
He plans to live in Hong Kong to be close to China, the fund's major field of operations.
Tiger International will invest directly in companies and projects for which there is no way of investing through publicly traded stocks or bonds.

In Britain, Publication of Leavitt Novel Put Off
Viking said yesterday that it would delay publication of David Leavitt's novel "While England Sleeps" in Britain until a court holds a hearing to determine whether the poet Stephen Spender, who has charged that the novel is a badly disguised account of his own life, should be granted a trial in the matter.
A preliminary hearing was held yesterday in London, but because Viking had already voluntarily decided to delay publication in Britain, the substantive issues were put off and will be heard at another hearing within 10 days, said Sam Sylvester, a lawyer for Mr.
Spender.
The novel, an account of a love affair between two men in the 1930's, is already available in the United States and was to have been published in Britain on Thursday.


Transit Authority Moves to Control False Claims
The New York City Transit Authority has begun its first systematic effort to prevent fraudulent injury claims on the city's subways and buses by going after the lawyers and doctors who the agency says "make these frauds possible."
The effort will involve a new unit of prosecutors and detectives that the Brooklyn District Attorney's office has formed to focus on ferreting out such fraud through a computerized hunt for lawyers and doctors repeatedly involved in false transit-injury claims.

Saudi Officials Reporting Accord With Shiite Foes
The Saudi Government has reached an agreement with its Shiite opponents by which they would suspend their activities abroad, including putting out publications that attack Saudi Arabia's policies and record on human rights, Saudi officials said today.
According to senior Saudi officials and spokesmen for the so-called Reform Movement, a loosely organized Shiite opposition, the group halted publication of its monthly newsletter, Arabian Peninsula, which was printed and distributed from London, and agreed to stop inveighing against the Government.


Review/Dance; The Taylor, In Wedding Of Darkness And Light
Paul Taylor is famous for bright-looking dances with a dark underside.
But Mr.
Taylor has never merged the two quite so inseparably as in "A Field of Grass," presented by the Paul Taylor Dance Company in a world premiere on Wednesday night at City Center.
An evocation of six songs by Harry Nilsson from the late 1960's and early 70's, the dance begins on an insidiously goofy note.
Why, one wonders, is Mr.
Taylor bothering to plunk a grinning dancer center stage, seated in a lotus position and dragging on a cigarette, to the accompaniment of this tepid musical soup?
Very gradually, as "A Field of Grass" moves from one song through another, Mr.
Taylor creates a landscape filled with green, sun, a soft breeze and gamboling youngsters in bell-bottom jeans.
As gradually, the dancers' bodies tauten.
Tall, threatening city buildings seem to have sprung up across earth that one recognizes as tinged with blood.
The sun comes out again from behind thin storm clouds at the end.
But it shines down on games forbidden in the time that the songs establish and the dance suggests.


City Opera Committee Bisects Christopher Keene's Power
A dispute between Christopher Keene, the general director of the New York City Opera, and the executive committee of the company's board over the hiring of an executive director has turned into a battle for control of the 50-year-old company's artistic future.
Also hanging in the balance is Mr.
Keene's own future with the company.
At issue are the committee's choice for the newly created executive directorship -- Mark Weinstein, the company's director of business and finance for 10 years before he left to take another job in June -- and the kind of authority the position will carry within the company.
Division of Power
Mr.
Keene expressed his objections to board members on Tuesday in a letter, parts of which were published yesterday in New York Newsday.
His objections centered on the fact that Mr.
Weinstein had been promised complete control of non-artistic matters, including the power to hire and fire staff members.

Back in Manhattan
In his career as a chef, Jonathan Waxman has been like a comet: shining brightly one moment, then disappearing from view.
Now, after selling his interest in Table 29, a restaurant in Napa, Calif., his orbit has brought him back to New York City, where he was once involved with several restaurants.
He is to be a consultant for Ark Restaurants, which owns 19 restaurants in Manhattan.
He will work with Larry Forgione of An American Place and chefs from Ark Restaurants to revise menus for Poiret, Museum Cafe and Peretti's on the Upper West Side; Jim McMullen and Canyon Road on the Upper East Side; Albuquerque Eats and B. Smith's in midtown and Gonzalez y Gonzalez and Louisiana Community Bar and Grill on Broadway downtown.


Abroad at Home; The Guilty Men
A pathetic byproduct of the genocide in Bosnia has been the attempt by some Americans of Serbian ancestry to deny the reality of the Serbian aggression there.
"What's happening in Bosnia," Bob Djurdjevic of Phoenix wrote to The New York Times the other day, "is not a 'genocide.' . . . It is a tragedy largely inflicted on the Muslims by their own Government."


Genzyme
Shares of the Genzyme Corporation, a Cambridge, Mass., drug manufacturer, dropped sharply yesterday even though the company posted record quarterly earnings.

Keenan Tries to Make A New-Age Transition
When Mike Keenan entered an upscale American college in 1968 as a poor, crew-cut Canadian on an athletic scholarship, he attended classes six days a week and lived in a dormitory from which women and booze were barred.
By the time he graduated in 1972, the long-haired Keenan was attending classes three days a week with Vietnam vets and antiwar demonstrators, and his dorm was aquiver with sex and awash in beer.
What he learned living through the enormous changes of those four years, the Ranger coach says now, has become a source of psychic capital from which he draws as a modern manager of men in the 90's, manipulative rather than despotic, using sensitivity rather than intimidation to create winning teams.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; One actor can hawk in many tongues, most of them firmly in cheek.
WHEN Woody Allen did it, audiences roared.
Marni Nixon made a career of it.
Milli Vanilli did it, but got caught.
Now Madison Avenue is eagerly embracing it.
The subject in question is the use of lip-synching and dubbing, production techniques by which the voices of actors or singers are replaced by the voices of unseen other people.
When the performers on screen move their lips, the audience actually hears the voices of the talent offscreen.


Children Leave Occupied Brooklyn School for New One
Chanting "back to school" and waving paper pennants, about 350 children and their parents marched seven blocks yesterday from the dilapidated Brooklyn school they had occupied for 10 days to the new elementary school that will be their home until June.
There they were met by the teachers and staff who also were reassigned when the old school, Public School 156 in Brownsville, was closed because of asbestos and maintenance problems.


Nice Tie: Zubov Roars Back Against a Stingy Roy
There is no word in the English language that would have had as great an effect on Sergei Zubov, the Rangers' young Russian defenseman.

Players Try to Minimize Lott's and Simms's Brief Encounter
Ronnie Lott says he never forgets anything that happens on the football field.
But he has let slip from his memory one of the more lasting images of him and Giants quarterback Phil Simms on the same field.
It occurred at the end of a game between the 49ers and Giants on Dec. 3, 1990, when the free safety and the quarterback went face mask-to-face mask walking off the field at Candlestick Park, in full view of "Monday Night Football" cameras.
San Francisco won, 7-3, beating a Giants team that was 10-1 entering the game.


Tighten the Sanctions on Haiti
Standing before the United Nations General Assembly yesterday, Haiti's deposed President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, passionately argued for a complete trade embargo against his country to force its military rulers to step down and allow him to return to office.
Ordinary Haitians deserve this sort of cooperation from the international community.
First they took the risk of supporting Mr.
Aristide and electing him to office with an almost 70 percent majority.
Since then they have endured obscene brutality from the Haitian military and paramilitary "attaches," who have not shrunk from murdering Mr.
Aristide's followers, whether prominent members of his Government or the desperate poor who comprise most of his following.


Governor's Plea Ignites Criticism By Oklahomans
Far from bringing a long-running investigation of his campaign finances to a close, Gov.
David Walters's agreement to plead guilty to a misdemeanor has touched off a prairie storm of criticism.
Indeed, the effort to resolve his campaign violation has prompted the prosecutor, a fellow Democrat, to suggest that he resign, Republicans to threaten an impeachment drive against him and many Oklahomans to throw up their hands in confusion and disgust over the deal.


Art in Review
'Up in Smoke'
Knoedler  19 East 70th Street  Manhattan  Through Nov. 4
These days, this delightful show probably has to be considered a guilty pleasure: it presents more than 75 photographs made since 1911 on the theme of smoking.
In picture after picture, people are shown indulging in the noxious weed, whether in the form of cigarettes, cigars or pipes.
But whatever the show may lack in health-consciousness, it more than makes up in glamour, and in humor.


Market Place; A ski resort company is poised to benefit from a sport's rebound.
DESPITE a recent rejuvenation of the ski business, there are still many resorts that face hard times and are considered prime acquisition candidates for the stronger operators.
And few resorts are liquid enough to take advantage of the rich opportunities.
According to some Wall Street professionals, investors angling to profit from this should consider an enterprise like S-K-I Ltd., a publicly traded company in Killington, Vt., that has deep enough pockets to do some buying.


Sounds Around Town
Cook at the Carlyle
Barbara Cook, Cafe Carlyle, 35 East 76th Street, at Madison Avenue, (212) 570-7184.
Miss Cook, one of Broadway's most beloved lyric sopranos, has rarely sounded better than in her newest show at the Cafe Carlyle, a show that has its last two performances tonight and tomorrow night.
Coinciding with the release of "Dorothy Fields: Close as Pages in a Book," Miss Cook's strong new album on DRG Records, the show concentrates on lyrics by Broadway's greatest female lyricist.
The material spans 44 years, ranging from a swinging "I Can't Give You Anything But Love," with music by Jimmy McHugh (from "Blackbirds of 1928"), to "It's Not Where You Start," with music by Cy Coleman (from the 1972 musical "Seesaw").
There is a $40 cover charge and no minimum.

Instead of being a salute to individual composers and songwriting teams, her program ranges over the decades, sprinkling standards with contemporary songs.
In her new show, the pianist Mark Hummel is standing in for her longtime musical partner, William Roy.
Among the songs are "I'm a Fool to Want You," "Body and Soul," "Here's to Life" and a sultry, swinging version of "Sentimental Journey." Shows are at 9 and 11 P.M. tonight and tomorrow.
There is a $25 music charge and a $20 minimum.

Trial Begins in Berlin for Iranian Charged in Dissident's Death
A reputed agent of the Iranian secret police and four accused accomplices went on trial today for the murder of a leading Iranian dissident last year.
Federal prosecutors say Iran ordered the killing of the dissident, Sadegh Sharafkandi, who with three aides was cut down in a hail of gunfire at a Berlin restaurant.
A guilty verdict would be a triumph for political and human rights groups that have charged Iran with sponsoring an international terror campaign against its opponents.

A Gang of Ghosts Ready To Rumble
HALLOWEEN is New York's most problematic holiday.
For most of America, Oct. 31 offers a thrilling opportunity to pry the lid off the underworld and unleash, for a few hours, the forces of darkness and chaos.
In controlled circumstances, ghouls, witches, demons, goblins and assorted Hollywood celebrities are free to roam the earth and torment the living, extorting a shiver of terror as their due for dwelling in the kingdom of the dead.
New York has too much of the terror and chaos thing already.
In fact, the city may need its own version of Halloween, in which hordes of average people, with healthy complexions and slightly out-of-date clothes, go door to door and act polite.

United States Satellite Broadcasting Inc. said yesterday that it had selected Bozell Minneapolis as the first agency to handle its consumer advertising account and to introduce its direct-broadcast satellite system next year.

A California Wildfire's Path of Destruction


Plot Warning Is Reviewed By the F.B.I.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is reviewing the allegations of an informer who said after the World Trade Center explosion that he had warned law-enforcement agents of a plot to build a bomb, and that if they had worked with him, they would have prevented the blast, officials said.
But some officials disputed important parts of the informant's account yesterday, saying that conversations with him took place half a year before the attack on the trade center, and months before the bomb was actually built.


Yanks Look to Bridge the Talent Gap With Jays
The meetings of the Yankee hierarchy over the past three weeks have been exhaustive, with dozens of ideas discussed and dozens dismissed.
Every time the executives agreed upon a potential strategy, they needed to implement backup plans to guard against unforeseen developments.
Remember how their attempt to sign Greg Maddux became a fiasco last winter, with Maddux opting to accept less money from the Atlanta Braves?
But amid all the uncertainty, there is one constant that guides the Yankees' thinking: the presence of the Blue Jays in their division.
With every option the Yankees have tabled, it has been impossible for them to ignore the two-time World Series champions lurking above them.


U.S. Judge Rules Council Lines In Bridgeport Violate Rights Act
Less than a week before Election Day, a Federal judge has ruled that a Bridgeport City Council district map drawn this year violates the Federal Voting Rights Act and the United States Constitution and must be redrafted.

"Of all of the candidates seeking the presidency, Bill Clinton was not liberal enough for Mr. Zwirn -- he endorsed the most liberal, Jerry Brown."

Immediately after testifying, Mr.

Sports of the Times; Iraq Saves World Cup For the U.S.
THE nation of Iraq did one huge favor for the United States yesterday.
It saved this soccer-deprived republic from even the remote threat that the 1994 World Cup would have been whisked to a real soccer power.
I doubt that the Iraqis were very happy about that side effect of their 2-2 tie with Japan, which meant neither nation qualified for the 1994 cup.
The Iraqis would have been a great story: a nomad team forced to play only road games because of the troubles in their homeland.
They were in the same condition in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico when I interviewed them in their hotel in Toluca, and the goalkeeper gave me a keychain with Saddam Hussein's photo in color.
During the Gulf war in 1991, I went scrounging around for that souvenir, but I couldn't find it.

At the Bar; For President Clinton, old-school ties take precedence over senators' wishes in a search for a judge.
Bypassing the favorite candidate of Connecticut's two Democratic Senators and upsetting Hispanic groups, President Clinton is planning to nominate a mentor from his days at Yale Law School to the prestigious Federal appeals court in New York.
Earlier this week, The New York Law Journal reported what had been wafting around Mr.
Clinton's alma mater for weeks: that the President would soon nominate the long-time dean at Yale Law School, Guido Calabresi, for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Mr.
Calabresi would replace Judge Thomas Meskill, who took senior status in June.


Business-Political Scandal Widening in Japan
A simmering bribery scandal that has exposed deep webs of corruption between powerful politicians and construction companies entered a dangerous new phase today when the first case went to court and a former mayor admitted accepting the equivalent of $1 million in cash.
Toru Ishii, the former Mayor of the large northern Japanese city of Sendai, did not formally plead today and he did not say what the money was for, but prosecutors have charged that it was a bribe to steer lucrative construction contracts to several major contractors.

"But this month, sales of equity funds are up 47 percent from last month."


Kansas Agency Gets Sonic Drive-In Chain
Sonic Industries of Oklahoma City, which operates the Sonic Drive-In chain of 1950's-style fast-food restaurants, said yesterday that after a two-month review, it had selected Barkley &amp; Evergreen Inc. of Shawnee Mission, Kan., to handle its account.
The account had been at Advertising Inc. in Tulsa, Okla., for the last seven years.
Billings were estimated at $15 million.
In addition to handling Sonic's advertising, Barkley will also handle duties like public relations and direct marketing.
A new ad campaign is scheduled to begin in April.


G.D.P. Data Fail to Dampen Bonds
The Government's report on third-quarter economic growth and comments by a Federal Reserve governor sent ripples through the bond market yesterday.
By the end of trading, prices of Treasury securities had moved higher.
But it was not exactly clear why traders and investors ultimately chose to be positive about the report, which showed that the gross domestic product rose at annual rate of 2.8 percent, after adjustment for inflation.


Tax Plans For Tobacco Rile Industry
While executives of the tobacco industry had resigned themselves to an additional Federal tax of 75 cents for a pack of cigarettes to help finance health care changes, as the Clinton Administration proposed on Wednesday, they were outraged yesterday about the substantial -- and unexpected -- increases for cigars, snuff and other tobacco products.
"My first reaction was they put the decimal point in the wrong place," said Alan Hilburg, a spokesman for the Smokeless Tobacco Council, a trade association for makers of snuff and chewing-tobacco products.


Corrections
An article yesterday about accounts of a plot to build a bomb that was eventually exploded at the World Trade Center referred imprecisely in some copies to what Federal officials knew about the plan before the blast.
Transcripts of tapes made secretly by an informant, Emad A. Salem, quote him as saying he warned the Government that a bomb was being built.
But the transcripts do not make clear the extent to which the Federal authorities knew that the target was the World Trade Center.


FLURRY OF ATTACKS AS RACE FOR MAYOR IS NEARING AN END
A visit from the President, a flurry of broadcast appearances and saturation-strength television commercials propelled the New York City mayoral campaign toward its final weekend yesterday as Mayor David N. Dinkins rolled into high-geared attack and Rudolph W. Giuliani made more tempered appeals to liberal swing voters.
With polls showing the race too close to call but voters' unfavorable impressions of Mr.
Giuliani edging upward from the Mayor's past broadsides, Mr.
Dinkins unleashed his harshest commercial of the campaign, using footage of Mr.
Giuliani's epithet-spiked speech to a rowdy police rally near City Hall last year and condemning him for excessive zeal as United States Attorney in Manhattan.

Engineers Give Shape to Tire and Vehicle Fragments at Trade Cente Trial
The World Trade Center case has taken shape like someone making a pointillist painting -- a point of paint here, a few more points there.
Its forms became more distinct yesterday when prosecutors led two automotive engineers through a reconstruction of the dozens of vehicle fragments found in the blast wreckage.
Metal parts clanged together and prosecutors and a witness maneuvered around long and dangerously jagged pieces of wreckage so they could demonstrate to the jury that parts of the blown-apart vehicle found in the World Trade Center rubble matched the parts of another Ford Econoline van acquired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for comparison purposes.


White House Drops Talk of Capping U.S. Health Spending
The Clinton Administration has backed away from the politically contentious idea of imposing a limit on annual national health care spending, Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said today.
She told the Senate Finance Committee that the Government instead expected to control health care costs by imposing limits on how fast insurance premiums could rise.


Review/Art; Visions of Outsiders And the Self-Defined
"Driven to Create: The Anthony Petullo Collection of Self-Taught and Outsider Art" at the Museum of American Folk Art is a lively show that has some problems, beginning with the terms in its title.
Outsider art -- not so long ago called naive art -- is enjoying a high profile these days.
But who exactly qualifies as an outsider?
The insane, the visionary, the aged, the merely quirky, any artist living and working at a reasonable distance from the mainstream art world?
And what about self-taught?
Does it simply refer to the unschooled, to anyone who rejects esthetic conventions, or to anyone who tries to invent a visual vocabulary from scratch?
To judge by this exhibition, all of the above.


Rail Stock Shakes Nikkei
What began as a jerky roller coaster ride for the newly listed shares of the East Japan Railway Company earlier this week turned into a general stock market rout by today, with prices, investor sentiment and the market's overall reputation declining.
For the second day, trading in the shares of JR East, as the Government-controlled railroad is known, had to be suspended while the Tokyo Stock Exchange struggled to cope with waves of sell orders that paralyzed its computers.
The temporary halt only seemed to raise the level of anxiety in the market, however, by exposing potentially serious shortcomings in trading systems.
Investors just sold other shares.


CHRONICLE
Sometimes it really pays to wait on the wealthy.
The SULTAN OF BRUNEI, believed to be the world's richest man, left a $170,000 tip Monday for the hotel staff at the Four Seasons in Cyprus at the end of a five-day stay there, The Associated Press reported yesterday.
The 46-year-old ruler of the small, oil-rich sultanate is said to be worth at least $33 billion.
He attended last week's meeting of the Commonwealth, an association comprising Britain and 49 of its former colonies, held in the coastal city of Limassol .


Former G.O.P. Chairman Found Guilty of Bribery
The former chairman of Connecticut's Republican Party, Richard Foley Jr., was convicted yesterday of accepting $25,000 in bribes in exchange for promising to influence fellow lawmakers to change their votes on banking legislation that was initially rejected, then approved.
Mr.
Foley, a colorful, blustery former State Representative from Oxford, appeared unmoved as the verdict was read.
He was released on his own recognizance until his sentencing Jan. 7.
Outside the courthouse, he said he was disappointed, but made no other comment.
He could not be reached by phone last night.

TV Weekend; Falk Adds 2 Hats to His Ensemble
Peter Falk has a retirement annuity in "Columbo," and he's making the most of it.
In Sunday's installment at 9 P.M. on ABC, the latest in a sporadic series of two-hour "Columbo" movies, Mr.
Falk is not only the star, but also the writer and the executive producer.
Further, he has snagged Faye Dunaway as his co-star.
The basic "Columbo" formula, devised way back in 1971, remains intact.
Viewers are allowed to see an ingenious crime being committed.
Enter the police detective Lieutenant Columbo to spot the inevitable flaws and, as always, bring the perpetrator(s) to justice.
Some cases work better than others.
Sunday's is nifty.


Books of The Times; Pornography, the Constitution and a Fight Thereof
Only Words
By Catharine A. MacKinnon
152 pages. Harvard University Press. $14.95
In a very short, very angry book called "Only Words," the feminist lawyer and professor Catharine A. MacKinnon argues that pornography leads to violence against women, that pornography causes the men who consume it to rape, abuse and discriminate against women.
"Sooner or later," she writes, "in one way or another, the consumers want to live out the pornography further in three dimensions. Sooner or later, in one way or another, they do. It makes them want to; when they believe they can, when they feel they can get away with it, they do. Depending upon their chosen sphere of operation, they may use whatever power they have to keep the world a pornographic place."


Kodak Chief Offers a New Vision
George M. C. Fisher, the new chairman of the Eastman Kodak Company, said yesterday that he planned to improve the company's performance through revenue growth and faster product development, and not -- at least for now -- through job cuts beyond the 10,000 already announced.
That policy direction, which diverges from the financial community's long-running wisdom that Kodak must slash costs and at least 20,000 of its 130,000 jobs to fatten its perennially thin profit margins, was one of several indications yesterday that Mr.
Fisher has his own ideas about how Kodak should be run.


Judge Dismisses Suit By Indian for Land
A state judge today dismissed an Indian land claim in the Waterbury suburb of Southbury, ending a threat to the holdings of about 1,200 property owners.
The land claim was made by Aurelius H. Piper Jr., on behalf of the 100-member Golden Hill Paugussett tribe.
But during court proceedings tribe members and representatives of national American Indian organizations testified that Mr.
Piper, also known by his tribal name, Quiet Hawk, lacked the authority to make the claim, and that the majority of the tribe was opposed to the claim.


Fighting Fire of the Future: Making a Stand Where Homes Can Be Saved
In this community where the sprawl of Los Angeles meets the scrubland of the San Gabriel Mountains, exhausted firefighters have been battling what experts call the fire of the future.
Employing air assaults and prison crews on the ground to clear away brush, firefighters have struggled for the last two days to outrace hungry wildfires and outwit the changeable Santa Ana winds while setting up a fire line to protect vulnerable homes at the city's fringes.


Both Mayoral Candidates Want Federal Monitoring for the Polls
Amid expectations of a tight election, both mayoral candidates have asked the United States Justice Department to monitor the polls for possible voter fraud on Tuesday.
The requests, made in Oct. 20 letters by Rudolph W. Giuliani's running mate for comptroller, Herman Badillo, and Mayor David N. Dinkins's campaign staff, come amid allegations that thousands of people have been registered more than once as voters, either because of fraud or mistakes by the New York City Board of Elections.

88 Picassos Lead Fall Auction Parade
IN the next two weeks, the attention of the New York art world shifts away from the galleries and the museums and toward the auction houses during the fall sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art.
This twice-a-year ritual, some of the best free theater in town, offers a variety of entertainment this season.
Among the offerings, which go on view this weekend at the auction houses, are everything from the experimental to revivals, as paintings, sculptures and drawings with estimates totaling more than $207 million appear for the art market's autumn pulse-taking.
The usual pre-auction anxiety is evident as collectors, dealers and experts from all over the world flock to Sotheby's and Christie's to see works by artists ranging from Picasso and Renoir to Gorky and Hockney.
Just how the market will fare in these economic times is the question everyone is asking.
While this fall's auction catalogues are much leaner than those of the boom years in the 1980's, and the atmosphere is noticeably sadder, the experts who put the sales together are also far wiser.


His Brain 'Aching,' Clinton Tries A Soft Touch to Push Health Plan
A day after delivering his health care proposal to Congress, President Clinton yesterday moved to humanize the complicated universal health insurance plan that he said he had studied "until my brain aches."
Setting aside the fist-pounding oratory that he used in his address to Congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr.
Clinton adopted a confessional tone.
Instead of trolling for votes from potentially skeptical lawmakers, Mr.
Clinton used his public appearances to shore up the base of popular support for his plan.

U.S. SAYS ECONOMY GREW AS INFLATION SLOWED IN SUMMER
The economy perked up during the summer, expanding at a 2.8 percent annual rate despite floods and drought that cut farm output, the Commerce Department reported today.
At the same time, inflation subsided to a 1.8 percent annual rate, the weakest rise for a quarter since oil prices collapsed in 1986.


Art in Review
Larry Mantello
Jose Freire Fine Art  130 Prince Street  SoHo  Through Nov. 10
If pop culture gave itself a party, it would look like Larry Mantello's chockablock, more-is-not-enough debut at Freire.
Working entirely with the bright and mostly worthless trinkets to be found in souvenir stores, gift shops, toy stores and party-decoration outlets, Mr.
Mantello has turned the gallery into maze of zany installations and overloaded assemblage sculptures.
He has also painted some walls hot pink, covered others with wallpaper or with blown-up resort photographs, and levitated helium balloons all over the place.
Disco music emanates from one work, air freshener from another.
With repeated appearances of fake food -- hamburger-shaped yo-yos, plastic bagels, chocolate-kiss pinatas, furry ice cream cones and elaborately iced cakes that the artist makes himself -- there is virtually no sense that isn't aroused, or at least assaulted.
Take the young ones, but stick around, for this is a show that grows on grown-ups, too.

Americans Would Hail Laws on Movie Violence
To the Editor:
In "Janet Reno's Heavy Hand" (editorial, Oct. 22), on the Disney Company's self-censorship of one of its movies, "The Program," and the Attorney General's warning to television industry executives to clean up violence before the White House and Congress do it for them, you state that the R rating makes it simple to keep children away from certain movies.
Unfortunately, this is not so.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY  PROGRAM REDUCES COURT BACKLOGS
In Brooklyn, a new program imposing strict deadlines on criminal court schedules has done what seemed to be impossible in New York courts: reduced astronomical case backlogs.

Ladislav L. Rado; Architect, 84
Ladislav Leland Rado, an architect whose work stands in cities around the world, died on Tuesday at his home in Biscayne Beach, Fla.
He was 84 and also had a home in Armonk, N.Y.
Mr.
Rado was born in Czechoslovakia, was a graduate of the University of Prague and began his architectural career in Brno.
He came to the United States at the invitation of Walter Gropius, then the chairman of the architecture school at Harvard University, and received his master's degree from Harvard in 1940.
In 1945, he and Antonin Raymond founded Raymond &amp; Rado, which designed the American Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia; 2 Hammarskjold Plaza in Manhattan and the Federal Office Building in Albany as well as residential, recreational and industrial structures.


Armory Track Opens Again
It has been more than seven years since anyone has jumped over a hurdle at the Armory Track and Field Center.
But yesterday nearly 200 youths from high school and community track teams took a victory lap inside it to commemorate its reopening.
The Armory, on 168th Street and Fort Washington Avenue in Washington Heights, opened in 1909 and was used by the National Guard before it was converted into an athletic field house.
It closed in 1985 and used as a shelter for the homeless.
But track athletes had difficulty finding other sites for competition and that didn't sit well with Dr.
Norbert Sander, the 1974 New York City Marathon winner who used to compete at the Armory in high school and college.
"There are no other such facilities like it in the five-borough area," Sander said.
"The sport was affected without it."
He organized a fund-raising effort, enlisting the support of Mayor David N. Dinkins and James Capoziello, the executive commissioner of the Human Resources Administration.
The long-jump and high-jump pits must still be installed, but they will be completed in time for the indoor high school season.


G.M. Has $113 Million Loss, Beating Wall St. Predictions
The General Motors Corporation said today that it lost $113 million in the third quarter, compared with a $1.1 billion loss a year earlier, as red ink from its struggling North American auto operations overwhelmed profits earned abroad.
The loss was smaller than Wall Street had expected, particularly since G.M. reported Monday that it would take a $950 million charge against its earnings for the quarter, or $589 million after taxes, to pay laid-off workers.
The loss equaled 49 cents per share of common stock; G.M. shares, which had already climbed more than 9 percent since Monday's close on the New York Stock Exchange, rose further on the news.


Pro Football; Taylor Confronts an Old Truth: At 34, Healing Can't Be Rushed
Five years ago, even two years ago, Lawrence Taylor wouldn't have thought twice about playing in pain.
Playing with limbs broken and muscles aching is considered part of the job.
To Taylor's way of thinking, if he doesn't suit up when his body is hurting, he's not only short-changing the team, it's almost as if his manhood is being challenged.
But Taylor, the Giants' future Hall of Fame linebacker, has struggled in recent weeks, dealing with the pain of a severely pulled left hamstring and the mental sting of a relatively new concept: waiting out an injury and thinking about the whole season and not just one game.


Ballot Issues in Three Regions Debt Questions for New Yorkers
Albany seeks voter approval next week for three constitutional amendments to ease restrictions on New York State and local borrowing.
Two make sense.
One doesn't.
To prevent fiscal shenanigans, the State Constitution sets precise rules for public bond issues.
But Wall Street has changed since the rules were written; they need to be updated.
Questions No. 1 and No. 3 do just that, and should be approved.


Critic's Notebook; Tracing the Splendid Arc Of Fellini's Sweeping Vision
TOWARD the end of "Voices of the Moon" (1990), Federico Fellini's latest film, not yet released here, there's a scene of incredible beauty and sadness.
An angry old man named Gonnella, played by an actor who has something of the look and shape of a caricature of Fellini, enters a noisy disco and starts cursing the hedonistic dancers from a platform high above.
He shouts into the din: "Barbarians! Have you never heard the sound of a violin?" The people below stop and stare up at Gonnella.
"Dancing," he says, "should be like lace." With that, he makes his way down to the dance floor.
Taking the hand of his ancient mistress, he begins an elegant waltz.
As he and the woman move gracefully around the floor, seeming to float on air, the old man hangs onto a life in which music, dance and all the other arts still count for something.


Corrections
A dance review yesterday about the Sardono Dance Theater of Indonesia and its New York City debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music misstated the day of the performance.
It was on Tuesday, not yesterday.


Jonas Hollander; Advertising Executive, 67
Jonas Hollander, manager of the Los Angeles advertising office of The New York Times, died yesterday at his home in Woodland Hills, Calif.
He was 67.
The cause was cancer, his family said.


Dinkins in the 11th Hour: Pulling Out the Stops
ON THE SCREEN: News clips and black and white still pictures of Rudolph W. Giuliani over menacing music, as male voice intones the script, part of which is repeated in titles on screen.
Camera closes in on the words "strong-arm tactics." Stories with headlines like "Lawyers Assail U.S. Attorney" and "Tells of Taping of Mother." Footage of police officers breaking through barricades near City Hall, and of Mr.
Giuliani in shirtsleeves, pointing finger and shaking fist as the second syllable of the barnyard expletive he uses is bleeped out in keeping with general broadcast standards.
PRODUCER: Doak, Shrum, Harris, Carrier, Devine of Washington.

Leaders in Haiti Wrong to Think They Can Stall U.S., Clinton Says
President Clinton said today that leaders of the Haitian military government are "just wrong" if they think they can wait out United States insistence on the restoration of the country's exiled President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Responding to a plea from Father Aristide in a speech at the United Nations today, the Administration said it was considering further economic sanctions to force Haiti's military leaders to permit a return to democracy in the Caribbean country.


Newark's $150 Million Answer to Lincoln Center Is Under Way
In a big tent pitched yards from a park where homeless men spend their days, the air was heady with hope and promise and symbolism.
As the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra played Aaron Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man," arts mavens, corporate heads and politicians were joined by 21 schoolchildren from each of New Jersey's 21 counties to break ground today for what will clearly be more than just a new building in downtown Newark.


Selection Is Delayed On Forest Agency Boss
The Clinton Administration has delayed selecting a new head of the Forest Service, an appointment that has divided the agency over what direction it should take.
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who oversees forestry, said today that David G. Unger, a career forest manager, would replace F. Dale Robertson temporarily as the chief of the agency.
Mr.
Espy had previously said that he wanted a new leader for the Forest Service.
Mr.
Unger is expected to serve only until a permanent replacement is found, the Agriculture Department said.


Jets Ticket Is Just a Ticket; Giants Ticket Is a Treasure
Jets season-ticket holders, eat your hearts out if you can't get a seat for Sunday's "road" game against the Giants.
Consider Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason.
The Long Islander owns 36 season seats, and buys 62 tickets for every Jets home game at Giants Stadium.
But the Giants are the home team this week.
As a visiting player, Esiason is entitled to buy only two tickets.
Yet, he says, "I got all the tickets I needed in June, but I'm not going to divulge where."


Man and Girl Are Killed by Amtrak Train
A man and a 3-year-old girl were hit and killed by an Amtrak train yesterday in Elizabeth, N.J., in what appeared to be a suicide by the man, the police said.
The man was seen sitting on the track by the engineer of the approaching train, who was unable to stop the train before it struck the man about 6:45 P.M., said Detective Derek Glenn of the Newark Police Department.
The engineer did not see the girl, Detective Glenn said, but her body was found next to the man's, beside the track.


Take the Salmon, Give Me the Snow
Greg Gumbel sat in the shadow of a 7-foot troll, the owner of a droopy 18-inch-long nose, at a table in a troll theme park restaurant.
He was moved to ask, almost plaintively, "Shouldn't a thesis be written about how many nightmares Norwegian children have from these things?"
Gumbel ate none of the smoked fish and cured meat that was the day's lunch fare.
"Gamey," he pronounced the buffet.
But Gumbel's refusal to eat fits into the nonparticipation broadcast philosophy of CBS's prime-time anchor for next year's Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.


The Post Backs Giuliani
The New York Post editorial page endorsed the Republican-Liberal candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, for mayor in today's issue.
The editorial praises Mr.
Giuliani and predicts that if elected he will be "one of the most hard-line mayors in the modern history of this city."


CHRONICLE
Cus D'Amato, who was the dean of boxing managers and trainers when he died in 1985, ran the Gramercy Gym at 14th Street and Irving Place in Manhattan for more than 40 years.
Yesterday, officials of a neighborhood revitalization group made sure his name would not disappear from the area.
The gym was razed earlier this year to make way for low-income housing, so the 14th Street Union Square Local Development Corporation erected a sign naming part of 14th Street "Cus D'Amato Way." Floyd Patterson, Jose Torres and Vinnie Ferguson, fighters he managed, participated in the ceremony.


Packwood Diaries Said to Suggest Involvement in Criminal Activities
Three days after Senator Bob Packwood warned that releasing his diaries would embarrass other senators, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics said today that the diaries suggested that Mr.
Packwood might have been involved in criminal activities.
The chairman, Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, did not say what is in the diary, what accusations are under investigation or how serious they may be.
But his assertion was the first indication that the ethics panel was looking into possible criminal wrongdoing by Mr.
Packwood that was unrelated to the initial reasons for the ethics inquiry, accusations of sexual misconduct.


Infomercial Venture For Interpublic Unit
The Brockway Direct Response Television Corporation, which produces many of the program-length commercials known as infomercials, said yesterday that as expected, it had formed a joint venture with E. C. Television, an international syndication unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
As part of the partnership, Brockway and E. C. Television will produce infomercials and create interactive television programs for worldwide distribution.
Richard Brockway, chairman of Brockway, will head the new venture as chief executive and managing general partner.


Motorola Succession Is Puzzle for Wall St.
As the board of Motorola Inc. prepared to meet Friday to discuss management changes in the wake of the sudden departure of George M. C. Fisher, the company's chairman and chief executive, Wall Street struggled today to believe the company's assertions that business would continue as usual.
Shares of Motorola fell sharply in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, but quickly rebounded and spent much of the day trading between $1 and $1.50 off the opening price.
The stock finished down $1.125, at $104.50.


Reynold Carlson, 81, Latin American Envoy
Dr.
Reynold Erland Carlson, a former United States Ambassador and economic-development expert for the Ford Foundation in Latin America, died on Wednesday at the Green Hills Health Care Center in Nashville.
He was 81 and lived in Nashville.
He had suffered a long illness, his family said.
He was with the Ford Foundation from 1959 to 1975, except for three years after President Lyndon B. Johnson sent him to Colombia as Ambassador in 1966.
At the foundation, he was successively a consultant, representative in Rio de Janeiro, associate director of the foundation's Latin American program, representative in Buenos Aires and, finally, regional program adviser with headquarters in Lima, Peru.


Pain and Suffering?
To the Editor:
So far as I know, all the current proposals for improving health care overlook one obvious remedy.
The huge damages awarded for pain and suffering, which inflate the premiums for malpractice insurance, can be dispensed with without injustice; money cannot compensate for a lost life or a broken leg.
A Federal statute abolishing the award of such damages would save billions of dollars.
And, in my opinion, such a statute would be constitutional.
LOUIS LUSKY  Ridgewood, N.J., Oct. 20, 1993 The writer retired as Betts Professor of Law, Columbia Law School.


XEROX CORP. (N)
The Xerox Corporation said yesterday that third-quarter net income rose 24 percent, exceeding the expectations of industry analysts and buoying the company's shares.
Xerox stock rose $5.75, to $76.375, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.


Prudential May Face Civil Suits
The enforcement staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has recommended civil action against at least five former and current executives of Prudential Securities, including three top former retail executives, people with knowledge of the inquiry said yesterday.
The five executives have been informed by S.E.C. lawyers that the commission staff is recommending charges that they failed to insure that brokers under their supervision complied with the Federal securities regulations, people involved in the case said.
As many as a dozen former and current Prudential executives are under S.E.C. investigation, other people in the case said.
None of them is a part of Prudential's current senior management.


COMPANY BRIEFS
ALLIED-LYONS P.L.C., London, has opened a $30 million Baskin Robbins ice cream manufacturing plant in Russia.
HOSPITALITY FRANCHISE SYSTEMS INC., Parsippany, N.J., a hotel franchiser, said it had been granted an option to buy 600,000 shares of Alpha Hospitality Corp. common stock at $14 a share.


Coleman Is Fined
MARCO COLEMAN of the Miami Dolphins was fined $2,000 by the National Football League yesterday for throwing a punch during last Sunday's game against Indianapolis.
The defensive end already had been fined $1,000 Monday by Coach DON SHULA.
Coleman has the right to appeal the N.F.L. fine within 10 days but has not said if he will do so.
During the Dolphins' 41-27 victory over the Colts Sunday, Coleman threw a right cross at Colts running back ROOSEVELT POTTS in the second quarter. (AP)


Campaign Waltz May Cost County Executive, Critics Say
Andrew P. O'Rourke appears to be waltzing toward the close of his re-election campaign, sometimes literally so.
The other day the Westchester County Executive, a burly, silver-haired grandfather who projects a cultivated affability, showed up at a Golden Harvest Dance for 1,000 elderly people and waltzed and tangoed a half-dozen women across the floor to Swing Era tunes like "Sentimental Journey." With a carefree air, he showed off the terpsichorean wiles his four sisters taught him when they were growing up on welfare in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen and aspired toward what Mr.
O'Rourke calls "polite society."


Desert Ins: Saudis and South Koreans in World Cup Finals
When the emotions of this unusual soccer tournament were finally spent tonight on three different fields and under a full desert moon, the Japanese were crestfallen and the Iraqis were bitter.
But the Saudi Arabians and South Koreans were weeping for joy because those two teams will be playing in next summer's World Cup finals in the United States.
The Saudis claimed one of the Asian qualifying spots in this ethnically and politically diverse grouping by defeating Iran, 4-3.
The South Koreans claimed the other one on goal differential by beating North Korea, 3-0, and by getting a lot of help from Iraq, which crushed Japan's hopes of qualifying with a last-minute equalizer.

Dr.
Davis Weinert Gregg, an economist and insurance authority who expanded the industry's professional school, the American College, in Bryn Mawr, Pa., died on Wednesday at his home in Bryn Mawr.

The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for the Gregg Conference Center at the college.


Clinton Mixes Signal And Then Recaps
On the day he was to travel to New York to give a last-minute pre-election boost to Mayor David N. Dinkins, President Clinton made a rude fashion choice for his morning jog -- a baseball cap embroidered with the name of a new movie about a young man who aspires to play football for Notre Dame.
The name of the film: "Rudy."


Restaurants
Being a new restaurant critic in town has its drawbacks: there are a lot of restaurants I haven't yet eaten in.
But it also has its advantages: there are a lot of restaurants where I am still not recognized.
In most places I am just another person who has reserved weeks in advance, and I still have to wait as more important people are waltzed into the dining room.
I watch longingly as they are presented with the chef's special dishes, and then I turn and order from the menu just like everybody else.
One of my first interests was to review the cooking of Sylvain Portay, who became chef at Le Cirque late last year.
Over the course of five months I ate five meals at the restaurant; it was not until the fourth that the owner, Sirio Maccioni, figured out who I was.
When I was discovered, the change was startling.
Everything improved: the seating, the service, the size of the portions.
We had already reached dessert, but our little plate of petit fours was whisked away to be replaced by a larger, more ostentatious one.
An avalanche of sweets descended upon the table, and I was fascinated to note that the raspberries on the new desserts were three times the size of those on the old ones.


For Cleaner Politics in Suffolk
Next Tuesday, Suffolk County voters have a rare chance to enhance local democracy.
Proposition 5 would reduce the influence of special-interest money in politics, and increase meaningful electoral competition, by creating a public campaign financing system for countywide and local legislative races.
Under the proposed system, candidates who raise a threshold amount in small contributions and agree to limit their campaign spending and contributions would receive one-third of the spending limit in public financing.
The idea isn't new.
New York City, Los Angeles and 23 states have already enacted similar public financing systems, and there's a chance Congress may soon follow suit.


Knicks Win, Minus Ewing and Riley
Pat Riley and Patrick Ewing were ejected, but the Knicks were not defeated.
Overcoming a 14-point deficit with 10:30 to play, New York came back for an emotional 103-99 preseason victory tonight at the America West Arena here.
It was a stunning comeback, considering Ewing (30 points) and Riley were ejected with 42.8 seconds to play in the third quarter.

No to Recall in New Jersey
Republicans campaigning for control of New Jersey's Legislature in 1991 promised to give the public the power to initiate legislation.
But as soon as they got control they didn't want to share power with anyone, and the initiative idea died.
Instead they voted to offer a weak substitute on next week's ballot -- the power to recall elected officials.
It deserves to die, too.
The proposal would amend the State Constitution to permit special elections to remove state, municipal and county officials and members of Congress.
State laws already permit the recall of some municipal and county officials.
The effect has been good and bad.
The Mayor of Atlantic City was recalled in 1984.
But recently the Mayor of West New York in northern New Jersey was recalled and re-elected in the same balloting.

Giuliani Gets Free TV Time But It's a One-Man Debate
Rudolph W. Giuliani got one full hour of free prime-time television last night, but it was hardly a free ride.
In an appearance that was an odd cross between a debate and a news conference, he gripped a lectern with intensity, sometimes laughed nervously, showed flashes of humor and often sparred with the questioners.
And when it was all over, he thanked them for a "really terrific discussion."
In his remarks on WCBS-TV just five days before the election, Mr.
Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, also altered an earlier stance that was thought to have hurt him among liberal voters -- his insistence that if he were mayor he would have denied Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, a permit to speak at Yankee Stadium.
Mr.
Farrakhan, who has been criticized for anti-Semitic remarks, had planned to hold a rally at the stadium this weekend, but has canceled the event.


Reviews/Film; Simulated Sex For a Sendup Of Obsession
Many of the simulated sexual couplings that make up a good portion of Michael Mak's erotic comedy "Sex and Zen" are so outlandishly acrobatic that they are no more believable than scenes from martial arts movies in which the combatants fly like Superman.
But because what's being depicted is passionate, voracious sex rather than stylized combat, the spirit of "Sex and Zen" is quite different from Hong Kong martial arts films that are just as far-fetched.
For those who accept the absurd simulations as realistic, "Sex and Zen" will have soft-core pornographic appeal.
For others, its appeal should be as a cheeky if predictable sendup of erotic obsession and its unhappy consequences.
"Sex and Zen," which opened today at the Cinema Village, is based on Li Yu's novel "The Carnal Prayer Mat," an erotic work that was banned for centuries in China.
It follows the sexual swath cut by Mei Yeung Sheng (Lawrence Ng), a knight-errant in fanatical pursuit of ultimate pleasure.


Reviews/Film; A Femme As Fatale As Can Be
Like so many other films from Hong Kong, Stephen Shin's action thriller "Black Cat" has the gaudy color, carefree rhythm and detachment of a high-powered comic strip.
In its wildly expressionistic opening sequence, Catherine (Jade Leung), a waitress in an eerie, blue-lighted truck stop, goes berserk when a customer makes a pass at her, killing him and a police officer who has been called to the scene.
At her arraignment, Catherine shoots her way out of a Los Angeles courtroom in a blitz of gunfire.
Moments later, she is kidnapped by the C.I.A., which implants a microchip in her brain and trains her to become a political assassin with the code name Black Cat.
The film, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, makes no pretenses toward realism: the film is a Hong Kong answer to "La Femme Nikita" and its American remake, "Point of No Return." "Black Cat" is a stylish pop fantasy spun around an invincible female action hero.
Miss Leung, a Hong Kong-based model turned actress, survives more assaults than the Terminator and Rambo put together while executing various impossible missions.


Tensions Are Rising in Somalia Amid Fears of Renewed Civil War
Although clan fighting in the capital has subsided in recent days, growing tension and sporadic clashes are being reported in other areas of the country as Gen.

The officials say the unrest and a stalemate in political talks could mean the return of civil war to Somalia, which is still struggling to recover from two years of anarchy and famine.


Islanders Are Bitten By Those They Fed
It's played in an arena that resembles a crime scene by game time, when a cordon of police officers arrives to guard the place.
Every goal for the home team, and until tonight there hadn't been many, is accompanied on a soundtrack by the menacing hiss and snarl of a Florida panther, this state's endangered species and the hands-down winner as namesake for the National Hockey League's newest expansion team.
A white blimp circles the ice above twin Zambonis between periods, and vintage "Miami Vice" music roars from the sound system whenever the panther isn't vocalizing.
This is Florida Panther hockey, the latest and, he claims, the last foray into the wilderness of expansion territory for the former Islander general manager, Bill Torrey.


Top Eygptian Police Official Slain in Militant Stronghold

Pentagon Plans Shift in War on Drug Traffickers
The Defense Department announced a modest shift yesterday away from its ineffective and heavily criticized attempts at intercepting drugs to a greater emphasis on helping countries in Latin America attack the major drug trafficking organizations.
But drug experts said the change was likely to have little effect on the flow of illegal drugs into the United States.
Brian E. Sheridan, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug Enforcement Policy and Support, said the military planned to cut spending on the interception of drugs, which now accounts for 71 percent of its $1.17 billion anti-drug budget, by 6 to 11 percentage points.
It intends to increase spending on training and equipment for countries that grow, refine and export illegal drugs to 16 percent, up by 5 percentage points.


UAL Posts Big Gain Amid Union Tensions
The parent of United Airlines reported better-than-expected earnings yesterday, while signs emerged that talks with its unions about a buyout effort were strained.
United's pilots union informed its members last night on a recorded telephone message that it had sued the company over its marketing agreements with other carriers, including a recent agreement with Lufthansa German Airlines that requires approval by the Department of Transportation.
The message said those agreements violated the terms of the pilots' contract by substituting other airlines' aircraft to fly United routes.
A spokesman for the pilots union was not available for comment last night.


Review/Pop; Australians With Roots Both Celtic And Gothic
Dead Can Dance may be the ultimate cult band of a certain somber type.
The group, formed in Melbourne, Australia, in the early 1980's by Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard, has released six albums on 4AD, a London pop label specializing in music aswirl with a heavy Gothic atmosphere.
And in concert at Town Hall, where the sextet sold out two shows on Wednesday and Thursday, the spectral mood of its music was reinforced by an artful, low-key theatricality.
Thursday's concert also drew an intensely devout, ethereal-looking audience, with many people wearing black.
Wearing a floor-length white gown and with her blond hair in braids, Miss Gerrard, who has chiseled, Garbo-like features, presents herself as a solemn New Age Brunnhilde.
That image might seem pretentious were it not for her voice, a commanding folk alto with a buzzing vibrato that matches her look by lending the material an austere Celtic flavor.


Q &amp; A
Savings Bond Changes  Q. Will the reduction in interest from 6 percent to 4 percent on series E savings bonds affect the original interest on a bond purchased 15 or more years ago?
STANLEY LIKOFF, Bellerose, L.I.
A.
The original interest on your bond was not affected, but interest earned afterward may be.
The change in the guaranteed minimum rate for United States Savings Bonds affects bonds bought after March 1 and bonds entering new extension periods after that date.
The interest you receive on a bond depends on its issue date.
Assuming you bought a bond in October 1978, the rate was fixed for the first five years, after which it went into a 10-year extension period, in which interest was paid on a variable-rate basis.
The guaranteed rate for the current extension period is 4 percent, but you may get more if the market-based average rate is higher.
"If you hold the bond long enough, it will enter another extension period at the 25-year point," said Richard J. Schneebeli, deputy director of the Savings Bond division of the Treasury Department.
"It will then earn the guaranteed minimum rate or the market-based variable rate prevailing at that time, whichever is higher." Taxes on Noncitizens  Q. My husband and I are legal residents but not United States citizens.
What Federal gift and estate taxes apply to us?
ROSEMARY WEBER, Manhasset, L.I.
A.
Most gift and estate tax rules apply to both citizen and noncitizen residents.
The same tax rates apply, and the first $600,000 in an estate is exempt from Federal estate tax.
An important exception, however, is that transfers to a noncitizen spouse do not automatically qualify for the unlimited marital deduction on estate taxes.
Such gifts are limited to $100,000 annually.
"If you are married to a noncitizen, you should consider including in your will a qualified domestic trust that will be eligible for the estate tax marital deduction," said Robert W. Benjamin, a partner in the New York law firm of Esanu Katsky Korins &amp; Siger.
"If all else fails, the surviving spouse will have a short grace period either to reform the will in court or to become a U.S. citizen." I.R.A.
Cutoff Point  Q. Can one, working during the year he or she turns 70 1/2, make a deductible contribution to an I.R.A., while at the same time becoming subject to I.R.A. withdrawal requirements?
BERNARD MOSS, Washington  A. Taxpayers who work, but who do not participate in their employer's retirement plan, can make tax-deductible contributions of up to $2,000 a year to an individual retirement account.
But beginning with the year in which a taxpayer reaches 70 1/2, tax-deductible contributions can no longer be made to an I.R.A. by or for the benefit of that taxpayer.
"There are also special rules allowing a married working taxpayer to make tax-deductible contributions to an I.R.A. for the benefit of his or her spouse, even if the taxpayer is over age 70 1/2," said Jerry Uslander, a principal of William M. Mercer Inc., a New York employee benefits consultancy.
"This deduction ceases once the spouse reaches age 70 1/2, no matter what the age of the taxpayer."

For Kieu Chinh, acting out the most wrenching scene in the film "The Joy Luck Club" -- when her character has to embrace twin daughters one last time, then abandon them forever -- was reliving the greatest trauma of her own childhood.
Before the scene was shot, Wayne Wang, the director of "The Joy Luck Club," led Ms.

"Think of anything in the past," Ms.

Aspin Orders Pentagon Overhaul Of Strategy on Nuclear Weapons
Defense Secretary Les Aspin ordered an overhaul of the military's 45-year-old nuclear weapons strategy today, saying the main threat to American security now stems from nuclear terrorists and renegade states, not from the superpower war for which the arsenal was designed.
American nuclear missiles and aircraft have been placed on lower alerts since the cold war ended in 1991, but they remain pointed largely at cities, factories and military assets of a Soviet Union that no longer exists.


Sherrard Will Miss Rest of Season
The Giants put wide receiver Mike Sherrard on the injured reserve list today, meaning he will miss the rest of the season, including the playoffs.
Sherrard, who fractured his hip two weeks ago against the Philadelphia Eagles, is expected to remain on crutches for at least another six weeks and probably won't participate in any football-related activities until mid-January.
Although there was an outside shot that Sherrard could have been back at the end of the season and the playoffs should the Giants make them, the team didn't want to take any chances.


United's Talks With Unions Seen as Affecting Others
The outcome of the effort by United Airlines pilots' and machinists' unions to gain control of the carrier -- expected by industry analysts to either succeed or fail in the next few days -- will have broad implications for many carriers.
Since deregulation, airlines have turned to mergers, growth plans, even a commission appointed this year by President Clinton to solve their ills.
Regardless of who is to blame for their billions in losses in recent years, the carriers, particularly United, are now looking to their workers for help -- indeed, they say, as the last alternative to dismantling parts of their operations.

Knicks Deliver a Message to Suns Team They Expect to See Later
No game is meaningless in the Knicks' rivalry with the Phoenix Suns.
That alone was reason for the Knicks to savor Thursday night's 103-99 preseason triumph at the America West Arena.
But the victory was also significant because Patrick Ewing was ejected.
It was significant because Pat Riley was ejected.
It was significant because New York erased a 14-point deficit with 9 minutes to play.
And it was significant because the Knicks came back with a front line of Herb Williams, Charles Oakley and Tony Campbell, with Greg Anthony and John Starks in the backcourt.


Tax Fairness for D.C.
With a population of nearly 600,000, the District of Columbia has more people than Vermont, Wyoming or Alaska.
Yet its Mayor and City Council have limited power.
And the District is denied a voting representative in the same Congress that rules on its affairs.
The colonial character of this arrangement was underscored this week when Congress voted on the Washington D.C. budget, and grandstanding politicians from other places tried to deny its citizens the right to spend their own money as they see fit.

For the week, the Dow was up 31.29 points.

Judge Will Hear QVC Plea To Block Paramount Deal
A Delaware Chancery court judge has set aside Nov. 16 to consider QVC Network Inc.'s request to block the proposed merger of two media giants, Paramount Communications and Viacom Inc.
QVC, which is scrambling to stop the friendly merger, had asked the court for an injunction to halt the $10 billion deal.
In its request, it asked the court to remove anti-takeover and other provisions that would make it prohibitively expensive for QVC, but not Viacom, to acquire the company.


CBS Cancels a Series 2 Days After Premiere
CBS bombarded the nation with promotional ads for its series "South of Sunset" for two weeks during the baseball playoffs and World Series, and the viewers apparently decided they had seen enough.
In one of the fastest cancellations in television history, CBS waited just two days after the premiere of "South of Sunset" before declaring it dead on arrival.
The cancellation completes CBS's four-year association with Major League Baseball with a final touch of disaster.
The deal cost the network about $500 million in losses.

SHELL OIL CO.
The Shell Oil Company reported sharply higher third-quarter earnings yesterday, citing cost-cutting and higher profit margins for refined products and chemicals.
But the increase -- to $187 million from $18 million in the third quarter of 1992 -- resulted partly from $76 million in special tax benefits.
Revenues fell to $5.4 billion from $5.7 billion a year earlier.
Shell said the decline was partly because of a $4 drop in crude prices in the quarter.


Jury Rules in Favor of Lockhart's Widow
A jury yesterday awarded $15.7 million to the widow of Carl (Spider) Lockhart, a former New York Giants defensive back, agreeing with her contention that doctors had failed to diagnose her husband's cancer when he complained about it in 1979.
After the trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the six-member jury found that malpractice by Dr.
William Grace 3d, chief of oncology at St.
Vincent's Hospital, was "a proximate cause" of Lockhart's death in 1986.
The jury also held the hospital responsible for Grace's error, making it liable, along with the doctor, for the damages.

In the resolution, the Council reaffirmed its commitment to "undertake an in-depth consideration of its humanitarian, political and security activities" in Somalia, which will be based on a report by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to be submitted before Nov. 18.
He is expected to lay out the problems of enforcing a mandate with the dwindling number of United Nations peacekeeping troops in Somalia.

Reich said that by the end of October he would recommend that the minimum wage, now $4.25 an hour, be increased by about 25 cents.
But White House officials warned him immediately afterward that such a move would be unwise because it could antagonize business leaders at a time when President Clinton needs them for his health care and trade proposals.


Seeking Identity Beyond 'King's Son'
With a reticence verging on shyness, Martin Luther King 3d today worked the lunchtime crowds in downtown Atlanta in his quest to be elected chairman of the Fulton County Commission next Tuesday.
Invariably, the reactions veered far from county politics.
"Are you Martin Luther King's son?" asked Brenda Graham, reaching out to shake his hand.


Islanders Refuse to Get Struck Twice in Florida
Riled over the prospect of suffering consecutive embarrassments against Florida's two young National Hockey League teams, the Islanders played tonight as if on a mission.
Or at least as if they were in the playoffs.
The rough checking and tenacious play that helped them advance as far as the Stanley Cup semifinals last spring helped the Islanders defeat the Tampa Bay Lightning, 4-2, tonight before 22,332 at the Thunderdome.
The emotional performance came a night after a 5-2 loss to the first-year Florida Panthers in Miami.

YACHT RACING  Women's Entry Folds  U.S.
Women's Challenge, the only all-female entry in the competition, quit the Whitbread Round the World Race yesterday.
A statement from the skipper, Nance Frank, cited lack of money as the reason for the yacht's withdrawal, although the entry was also said to have been troubled by disharmony among its 12-woman crew.
On Thursday, the navigator, Adrienne Cahalan, of Australia, and the watch leader, Mikaela von Koskull of Finland, left the team.
Their departure deprived Challenge of two of its most experienced sailors.
Challenge finished 11th among the 14 yachts in the first leg, from Southampton, England, to Punta del Este, Uruguay.
The boat was slowed by numerous technical problems, including a split mainsail and hardware and electronics failures. (AP)

Hillary Clinton Courts Four Senators Backing Rival Health Care Proposal
Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled 932 miles today to tell four Republican Senators they were in "the good faith camp" on health care and to minimize their differences with the President over how to pay for insurance coverage.
She said there was not much difference between the plan the Senators support -- which would require individuals, not employers, to pay for health insurance -- and the one that President Clinton submitted to Congress this week requiring employers to pay for premiums, because both would include universal care and a comprehensive benefits plan.

Review/Pop; A Siberian Singer's Style Goes With New York Reeds
A typical traditional singer from Tuva, in southern Siberia, wouldn't arrive on stage with an LP cantilevered atop her hairdo, or wearing tights and ankle boots suitable for a Central Asian version of the B-52's.
But Sainkho Namchylak, who performed on Thursday night at the Kitchen with Ned Rothenberg, no longer sticks to traditional music; she has joined the international improvising avant-garde.
The concert was part of the Kitchen's Autumnmusic series, which ends tonight.
She found common musical ground with a musician from the opposite side of the globe; Mr.
Rothenberg is a New Yorker.
Mr.
Rothenberg, on alto saxophone, bass clarinet and shakuhachi (a Japanese wooden flute), was a deferential partner to Ms.
Namchylak, who sings both traditional Tuvan music and an avant-garde vocabulary of scat syllables, twitters and shrieks.

A positively disastrous trump break is usually fatal, but those who remember the Latin motto that translates as "Never despair" can sometimes survive.
An example is the diagramed deal from a sectional Swiss Team event earlier this month in Ardsley, N.Y.
One would expect North-South to land in game in no-trump, hearts or clubs and make a fortunate 12 tricks.
But the partnership wandered into five diamonds, making East, for the moment, a happy man.


Teachers Union Acts Shamefully to Mayor
To the Editor:
I protest the highhanded action of the United Federation of Teachers in not endorsing Mayor David N. Dinkins for re-election.
By letter on Oct. 25, nearly two weeks after the teachers union leadership "leaked" its decision to the press, it finally notified the rank and file of its action.
But, instead of saying that the union was not endorsing Mayor Dinkins, the letter named three choices (all Democrats): Stanley Michaels for City Council in District 7, Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger and Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
By omission, the union leadership implicitly failed to endorse the Mayor or to acknowledge his granting a new contract with budget-breaking raises.


Confusion Over Policies Leads to Talk of Change
BUYERS of life insurance are entitled to descriptions of their policies and how they work.
But the computer-generated tables supplied by insurance agents often show results that are just not realistic.
Even after scouring these documents, people frequently cannot determine what the policies' benefits would be if they lived, died or stopped paying premiums at any given time.


Incentives of $31 Million Keep Kidder, Peabody in New York
In the latest high-priced deal to persuade a company not to move to the suburbs, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, the Wall Street firm, had accepted $31 million in incentives and would move its headquarters from lower Manhattan to Rockefeller Center.
The deal, in the wake of a series of corporate relocations out of New York City, came at a politically sensitive time, since Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr.
Dinkins's opponent in the mayoral election on Tuesday, has repeatedly criticized the Mayor for losing too many battles to hold onto companies.

R.
H.
Macy &amp; Company, which operates the Macy's, Bullock's and I. Magnin store chains, tripled its cash flow in September by keeping a tight rein on expenses, according to documents filed in United States Bankruptcy Court yesterday.
The company almost broke even last month, posting a $600,000 operating loss compared with an $18.8 million loss in the corresponding period last year.
Sales, however, dipped slightly as the company continued to struggle against weak economies in California and the Northeast, where it has the most stores.


CHRONICLE
People go to fashion shows for a variety of reasons: to see, to be seen, to take the pulse of Seventh Avenue.
TOMMY TUNE, the producer, director and dancer, plans to take in a few of the New York shows, which begin tomorrow under tents in Bryant Park, to sharpen his artistic senses.
"We are always seeking to refine our natural vision, and scrutinizing fashion design is one way of achieving that," he said the other day, taking a break from "Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public," a show he's developing.
"Going to fashion shows enhances my eye for detail. Every little stitch counts and when I am working with a big show, I like to find ways to enhance my eye for detail.


Sightseeing Helicopter Makes Forced Landing in East River
It was a dream autumn day in Manhattan for four Paris tourists who set out yesterday afternoon on a short sightseeing ride by helicopter across the perfect blue sky.
But only minutes later, as the tour paused near Wall Street, the helicopter suddenly lost power and was forced to land in the East River.
No one was injured, but it was quite an event for the four passengers who had not had this kind of adventure in mind.

Methodist Leader Requests U.S. Curb on Human Cloning
A leader of the United Methodist Church has asked President Clinton to issue an executive order banning the cloning of human embryos at all federally financed institutions, the Religious News Service reported yesterday.
That request, made this week by the Rev.
Thom White Wolf Fassett, general secretary of the 8.9-million-member denomination's General Board of Church and Society, was prompted by news accounts of cloning experiments at George Washington University aimed at producing extra fertilized embryos for implantation when couples are unable to conceive naturally.

The Islands Russia and Japan Dispute

The dispute between Japan and Russia over the so-called Kurile Islands is more nuanced, both historically and legally, than Marvin Gregory's Oct. 22 letter suggests.
The contest for the Kuriles dates back to Russian and Japanese imperial competition in the 19th century.
In 1945, Russia recovered by force what it had lost after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5.

As he campaigned around the city, Mr.
Giuliani condemned the Mayor and warned everyone within earshot to expect a deluge of unfair attacks in the final days before the vote.

Smith Barney Forces Out Ball
George L. Ball, the former head of Prudential-Bache Securities, has been forced out of his senior post at Smith Barney Shearson and is being investigated by Federal regulators for his role in the unfolding scandal at his former firm, Wall Street executives and people involved in the case said yesterday.
Mr.
Ball, the chairman and chief executive of Prudential-Bache from 1982 to 1991, was asked to leave his job as a senior executive vice president at Smith Barney over concern that the Prudential scandal would eventually stain the reputation of his new employer, executives at the firm said.


Mets Win Rights To Cuban Shortstop
The Mets, making the most out of being the worst, yesterday scored a rare and maybe remarkable triumph when they won the rights to a 21-year-old Cuban national team shortstop who defected to the United States during last summer's World University Games in Buffalo.
"Maybe it's an indication that the losing has ended for this organization," said General Manager Joe McIlvaine.


With European Union's Arrival, Fears on Economy Cast a Shadow
This was to have been a day for the leaders of the European Community to celebrate finally the coming into effect of the Treaty on European Union.
But instead, the summit meeting today was overshadowed by anxiety about growing unemployment and mounting welfare costs in their recession-stricken continent.
In a communique, the European Community leaders agreed to work more closely together to create jobs and economic growth after the Treaty on European Union goes into effect on Monday.


For Motorists on the Spot, Relief From Tow Trucks
In a traffic-choked town of short tempers and tall fines, it is a classic confrontation: The tow truck driver has just hooked an illegally parked car and is about to pull away.
The hapless motorist runs up, moaning excuses, pleading for pity.
The tow truck driver is unbending.
Anger boils over, maybe violence.
This all-too-familiar New York street scene may soon be a thing of the past in most of midtown Manhattan, the city's Transportation Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio, said yesterday, proclaiming not a miracle but a kind of common-sense victory over Kafkaesque bureaucracy.

Financial Planning: A Web of Credentials but No Regulations; The Search for Someone Trustworthy
When Thomas and Midge Bailey of Norcross, Ga., retired in the mid-1980's, they gave their financial planner clear instructions.
"We told him we didn't want our retirement money in high-risk things," Mrs.
Bailey said.
"We wanted safe investments for the income."
But the planner put much of the couple's $260,000 stake in high-risk investments, like oil and gas limited partnerships.
He earned hefty commissions -- up to 10 percent -- while their investments turned sour.


'Yuppies' Label Belittles Work of Volunteers
To the Editor:
As a New York Cares volunteer, I adamantly object to "Yuppies Come Out to Paint Up and Fix Up," the headline on your Oct. 17 article about New York Cares Day.
It is an insult to the 4,000 volunteers who worked Oct. 16 and the organization that spent months planning the event.
While some of the Oct. 16 volunteers may have been "yuppies," the majority were not.
Such a term makes those who volunteered their time and energy sound like a bunch of dilettantes descending from their ivory tower.

Brewer Revives a European Tradition in Texas
Pierre Celis is about to prove you can go home again.
The 68-year-old Belgian brewer, who sold his brewery in Belgium to a giant brewer several years ago, has been making beer in Texas for the last year and a half.
Now, he is going to sell beer in Belgium once again.
Regardless of whether his beers should be classified as Belgian-style Texas beer or Texas-style Belgian beer, there is no question that Mr.
Celis, a Ross Perot-size man who often wears a bolo tie, has carved out a niche for himself in the beer business.
He has sucessfully established himself as one of the leaders in the growing international taste for white, or wheat, beer.


Two Ways to Run a City; Mayoral Candidates Offer a Clear Choice Between Opposing Views of Government
Beyond the questions of competence and temperament, crime and race, the 1993 campaign for mayor of New York City has offered voters two candidates with sharply different philosophies of local government.
David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani have not met this time in a debate to spell out those ideologies, and the campaign has often wandered into more visceral diversions.
But the differences between the two men emerge with great clarity from their campaign statements, position papers and weeks of appearances in the five boroughs of the city.

MODERATE GROWTH IN SEESAW PATTERN SEEN FOR ECONOMY
The economy is showing more signs of life, but even third-quarter growth of 2.8 percent, announced on Thursday, is not likely to be the start of a prolonged period of smooth, strong expansion.
Many economists predict that the economy will grow moderately in coming months.
But the process is likely to continue to be choppy, they caution, with periods of solid expansion alternating with anemic growth like that in the first half of this year.


Fire Built for Warmth Spread Disaster
It had grown chilly before dawn on Wednesday, so Zhang Andres Huang, a 35-year-old transient living without shelter in a canyon near here, gathered some brush and lighted a fire.
But there was a strong, dry wind that morning, and the fire spread out of control.
Mr.
Huang, a native of China who arrived here only weeks ago and speaks no English, told investigators through an interpreter that he had tried in vain to stomp out the fire and had run for help, banging on a canteen to attract attention.
A short time later, sheriff's deputies found him about to be engulfed in flames.


High Court Lets Pentagon Put Gay Policy Into Effect
The Supreme Court cleared the way today for the Pentagon to carry out its new policy on homosexuals in the military while the Clinton Administration appeals a Federal judge's order banning all discrimination against gay and lesbian service members.
The Justices' unanimous action, the granting of a stay against the judge's order at the Administration's urgent request, was essentially procedural and did not necessarily reflect a judgment on the constitutionality of restrictions on military service by gay men and lesbians.
That underlying question may reach the Court either in a later phase of this case or in other cases now in the legal pipeline.


Back to Work as Coleman And Mahorn Rejoin Nets
Derrick Coleman had missed the Nets' last four preseason games because of wisdom-tooth extraction.
Rick Mahorn hadn't played a game since bruising his kneecap in training camp.
With the season opener next Friday, Coach Chuck Daly was glad that both players returned to practice today.
"He seems to be O.K," Daly said, referring to Coleman.
"He went the whole practice and he worked real hard. He's just one of those gifted players like that."


An Aggressive Prosecutor Who Plays to Win
In the restrained world of Federal prosecutors, where public demeanor usually ranges from guarded to grim and most traces of singularity are kept carefully hidden, Mary Jo White stands out like a pair of jeans in a closet full of pinstripes.

New Government Corruption Scandal Leaves Brazil Stunned
Nearly one year after the nation's President resigned in a corruption scandal, charges of a major kickback scheme now grip the Brazilian legislature, clouding the future of Latin America's largest democracy.

In Burundi, Partition Can End the Bloodshed
To the Editor:
The coup and killings in Burundi are regrettable, but were predictable.
In 1972, when I served as United States Ambassador to Burundi, I witnessed the ethnic strife between the Tutsi and Hutu communities.
The alienation between the two communities is deeply rooted and is an intrinsic part of the culture.
The minority Tutsi (around 14 percent of the population) and the majority Hutu have had a history of ethnic clashes since the 19th century.


Arabs End Objections To U.N. Seating Israel
Reflecting the improved political climate in the Middle East, the General Assembly agreed today to seat Israel at its session this year without an Arab challenge.
From 1982 to 1989, Arab nations always challenged the credentials of the Israeli delegation, which was seated only after a procedural maneuver by the Scandinavian nations that prevented the Assembly from voting on proposals by the Arabs to bar Israel.


Six Accused in Killings
Six men suspected of being members of an extortion gang in the South Bronx that preyed on drug dealers were indicted yesterday on murder, kidnapping and weapons charges, the Bronx District Attorney said.
The suspects face four counts of second-degree murder, including the killing of George Calderon, who was described by Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx District Attorney, as a significant heroin dealer.


U.N. Envoy Proposes Talks To End the Impasse in Haiti
The United Nations' envoy to Haiti called today for new talks with the nation's military leaders and renewed demands that they take steps to comply with a negotiated agreement restoring democracy in the next two days or face a rapid cutoff of trade.
Speaking at a news conference on the eve of the original date set for the return of the nation's exiled President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the special United Nations representative here, Dante Caputo, said his organization would have "no alternative" but to extend sanctions if Haiti's Army leaders did not respond favorably to the call for new talks.


Oh, You Know What I Meant
A bound document produced for holders of Paramount Communications stock last week came off the presses with a little glitch.
What Paramount meant to say in the Schedule 14D-9 solicitation statement, filed Oct. 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, was that the Viacom Inc. and Paramount boards would have to entertain certain kinds of competing offers.
Offers that were bona fide and lacking "material contingencies relating to finance," for example.

Teachers Union Acts Shamefully to Mayor; Not Race Alone
To the Editor:
I concur with the thrust of "Clinton Spoke the Truth on Race" by Lani Guinier (Op-Ed, Oct. 19), that honest discourse is essential to improving relations between our citizens.
Yet, when we limit any type of discourse on race to black and white, we omit other real elements of difference that contribute to this crisis: age, gender, social and economic status, sexual preference, physical ability, ethnicity and religious affiliation.


For County Executive in Nassau
Long Island's Nassau County is suffering the effects of a bloated, deeply entrenched political machine.
Nassau's incumbent County Executive, the Republican-Conservative Thomas Gulotta, showed promise earlier in his tenure.
He understood the intricacies of government and seemed to have a handle on the county budget.
But bad economic times have gotten the best of him.
Mr.
Gulotta is too tied into the wasteful, patronage-laden ways of the Republican machine to bring the revolutionary changes in government that Nassau needs.
His opponent, the Democrat Benjamin Zwirn, might just have the temperament and talent to bring reform.
We support his election.

Penn State Can Keep Coalition Contented
As Penn State football fans continue to adjust to the subtleties of life in the Big Ten Conference (Let's see: If we beat Ohio State, and Michigan beats Wisconsin. . . . ), they have some company.
The coach is figuring the possibilities, too.
"I did some things last Saturday," Joe Paterno remembered of his off day, "and then when I came home I got to watch the second half of the Illinois-Michigan game because we are going to play Illinois down the road, and got kind of caught up in the 'if this happens and that happens,' and 'what if' and all that kind of stuff. It certainly continues to make the season interesting even though you may get licked."


Canada's Quarrel With Nafta
Supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement hoped that the Liberal Party, once it won the Canadian elections, would drop its vow to renegotiate the trade pact.
But this week Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister-elect, resurrected the threat.
That's unfortunate, because renegotiation could bury Nafta -- an important pact that would raise living standards in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. and lock Mexico into its pro-market reforms.
The threat is also unnecessary, because Nafta doesn't bear on the trade issues that disturb Mr.
Chretien the most.
The dispute is mostly about subsidies the Canadian Government gives industries like wheat and lumber.
These subsidies are designed to solve domestic problems, like bailing out flagging industries and developing downtrodden regions.
But the two countries' economies are so intertwined that domestic subsidies inevitably affect trade between them.
Subsidies help Canadian producers lower their prices, giving exporters an "unfair advantage," according to their U.S. competitors.


Review/Music; Abbado, the Berlin Philharmonic and Mahler
What a magnificent, eloquent, unpredictable and flawed organism the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra is.
On Thursday night in Carnegie Hall, the orchestra that once seemed an extension of Herbert von Karajan's gesturing arms gave the first of three New York concerts conducted by Karajan's successor, Claudio Abbado.
It was the first time since 1982 that the orchestra had played in New York under its own music director (visits in 1986 and 1991 were led by James Levine and Bernard Haitink, respectively).
And it was the first time New Yorkers could hear how Mr.
Abbado has been shaping this great instrument since he became its caretaker and leader in 1989.
The orchestra looks younger, but its sonic tradition has not been radically modified; it was still recognizably the instrument heard in recordings and previous concerts.
The famous sleek strings still had an astonishing elegance; the orchestra as a whole could give a polished, glorious three-dimensional body to sound.
And there were moments when the ensemble seemed to have its familiar organic quality, breathing with its conductor and the score..

As Envoy to Tokyo, Mondale Takes a New Tack on Trade
When President Clinton named Walter F. Mondale as Ambassador to Japan earlier this year, Government officials here hoped for an updated version of their favorite envoy, Mike Mansfield, an elder statesman who rarely ventured into battles over trade.
But in the six weeks since Mr.
Mondale arrived here talking about creating "a more dignified relationship," going beyond each country's lectures about how the other should change, the comparisons to Mr.
Mansfield have quickly melted away.

He just didn't pay much attention to what it said.


The Running Man: Johnson Craves Role
With the Jets looking to control the clock and take some of the steam out of the Giants' defensive front on Sunday, this would be a perfect time for Coach Bruce Coslet to turn running back Johnny Johnson loose.
Johnson, who came to the Jets on draft day in a trade with Phoenix, has had success running against the Giants.
In five games with the Cardinals, Johnson, a 6-foot-3-inch, 220-pound workhorse, has averaged 85 yards on 22 carries.
Last season, he had a career-best game against the Giants, carrying the ball 36 times for 156 yards and 2 touchdowns.


Giuliani Ahead in Fund-Raising But Dinkins Says He'll Match It
Rudolph W. Giuliani had $900,000 more in the bank than Mayor David N. Dinkins earlier this week, according to campaign records filed last night.
But officials of the Dinkins campaign said they are continuing to raise money and will be able to match resources with the Republican-Liberal candidate during the crucial last days of the mayoral campaign.
The records filed last night with the city's Campaign Finance Board showed that Mr.
Giuliani had about $1,033,000 on hand on Monday and that he was still allowed to spend $437,000 of that before Tuesday, under the city's campaign finance law.
Mayor's Campaign Fined
The campaign reports indicate that Mr.
Giuliani raised no money during the one-week reporting period and that he already has more money on hand than he can spend.


Dummy Is on Ballot (He Isn't Seeking Office)
Along with school vouchers, sales taxes and city charter revisions, voters in San Francisco will decide next Tuesday whether to allow a veteran police officer to walk his beat with a ventriloquist's dummy.
The ballot measure is a spot of comic relief in an otherwise uninspiring off-year election here and seems popular with voters in the North Beach neighborhood where the officer, Bob Geary, and the dummy, Brendan O'Smarty, had worked without a peep of official complaint until a series of high-level changes in the police department.


Novosibirsk Journal; For Yeltsin, Siberia's Heart Is Cold
This rough-edged city of 1.5 million people, only 100 years old, has traditionally seen itself as the geographical center of the Russian empire and the capital of resource-rich, autonomy-minded Siberia.
But Novosibirsk was also the center of open resistance to President Boris N. Yeltsin in his battle with Parliament, and the results have produced a deep, defiant sullenness.
Vitaly P. Mukha, the longtime boss of this huge central Siberian province, 1,900 miles from Moscow, admits that in the game of politics he simply chose wrong.
On Sept. 22, the day after the final showdown in Moscow began when Mr.
Yeltsin proclaimed Parliament disbanded and Parliament retaliated by naming Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi acting President, Mr.
Mukha said in an open session of the provincial legislature: "From this day on, there is no President Yeltsin. The President of Russia is Rutskoi. Some say to be calm, but no! We must inspire people to oppose Yeltsin."

Secret Tapes Tell of Plan To Kill Bombing Suspect
The Egyptian authorities intended to kill a defendant in the World Trade Center bombing trial when he was arrested and tortured in Egypt a month after the bombing, an informer told the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Transcripts of telephone conversations between the informer, Emad A. Salem, and agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation quote Mr.
Salem as saying that the defendant, Mahmud Abouhalima, was spared when the United States asked that he be returned to stand trial.
If not for that request, Mr.
Salem said, Mr.
Abouhalima would have been made to "disappear." Ties With Egypt
It is unclear how much Mr.
Salem, a 43-year-old former Egyptian Army officer, could have known about the Egyptian Government's plans.
Although he is quoted in other parts of the transcripts as saying he had maintained ties with Egypt, the transcripts do not include the source of his information on the plan to kill Mr.
Abouhalima, and it could not be confirmed independently yesterday.

More Women, More Cash In Legislative Campaigns
Used for years as cannon fodder in hopeless election campaigns and denied nominations in races they could win, this year women are making a determined effort to get through the doors of the New Jersey Legislature, armed with one of the basic weapons of politics: money.
Now there are only 14 women in the 120-member New Jersey Legislature, several of them Republicans who were transformed from sacrificial lambs to lawmakers in the tax-revolt landslide in 1991 when there were no safe districts for Democrats.

Not Exactly on the Air, Koch Airs His Views
In 1977, David Garth devised television commercials that helped make Edward I. Koch, a quirky Congressman from Greenwich Village, Mayor of New York.
This year, he has figured out how to help Mr.
Koch, now a one-man media conglomerate, help Rudolph W. Giuliani become Mayor, despite a clause in Mr.
Koch's television contract that bars him from making political ads.
The new 30-second commercial uses footage of Mr.
Koch's recent comments about Mr.
Giuliani on WABC-TV's "Eyewitness News Conference" in which the former mayor said: "I know that Rudy Giuliani is intelligent, is courageous, a man of integrity. He brings a principle of one standard, a single standard for a single city."

New Jersey NOW Divides on Endorsement
To the Editor:
Anna Quindlen hits the nail on the head in "Gender Gaffe" (column, Oct. 24), on the National Organization for Women and the race for governor in New Jersey.
But she is not the only woman to recognize the shortcomings of Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate.
Although the political action committee for the state chapter of the National Organization for Women decided -- by a very narrow margin -- to recommend Mrs.
Whitman over Gov.
Jim Florio, this vote did not reflect the viewpoints of most of the NOW chapters throughout the state.


Berlin Concern Agrees to Build Public Toilets
At a time of occasionally high-flown oratory in the mayoral campaign, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation officials reported progress yesterday on a matter of perhaps more pressing concern to many: they said a company had agreed to install 30 public toilets in and around the city's parks by March 1995.
The announcement came amid a long-delayed effort by the city's Department of Transportation to install as many as 200 public toilets on city streets.
It also came less than a month after two other companies withdrew their bids to install toilets in the parks, saying that the city would not allow them to display enough advertising on the toilets and nearby kiosks.

More than 90 percent of the black voters will vote for Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Why?
Most will base their vote solely on his race.

Teachers Union Acts Shamefully to Mayor; Found Him Wanting
To the Editor:
In 1985 New Yorkers elected Ed Koch mayor.
In 1989 we voted him out.
In his place we elected David N. Dinkins, and now we may vote him out too.
Lani Guinier asserts (Op-Ed, Oct. 19) that any repudiation of Mayor Dinkins is racist.
Perhaps.
But how does she account for those who voted him into office last time?


Make Debates Mandatory
It looks as though, for the first time in more than 30 years, the principal candidates for mayor of New York City won't debate each other.
Why?
Because they can't agree on ground rules -- which really means that they don't want to agree, which also means they don't have high regard for what the voters need and want in the campaign.
Mayor David Dinkins says he won't debate unless George Marlin, the Conservative and Right to Life candidate, is included.
Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal challenger, says no debate unless Mr.
Marlin is not included.
Result: no debate, period.
Neither side would compromise.


Finding a business loan When Banks say No
Peter Sayki, 43, and Douglas Campbell, 40, quit their jobs as product development engineers to start their own business.

Possessed? You Might Give Maury Povich a Call
THE last couple of months have been busy ones for real-life ghostbusters, devil-defiers, hooligan-haters -- and talk-show hosts and tabloid-television news shows.
First, an Arizona psychologist performed an exorcism on a 10-year-old and billed the state $180 for the two-hour procedure.
Then "The Maury Povich Show" devoted a whole hour to exorcism, and on Friday Joan Rivers questioned a man who claimed he had chased vampires in Dracula's castle.
Then the Amazing Kreskin, who calls himself a "mentalist," went haunted house-hunting with a television crew. (They didn't find the ghost of Aaron Burr's wife, as promised, but a dollar bill did sail mysteriously across the carpet.)

Motorola Will Be Just Fine, Thanks
GEORGE M. C. FISHER flunked one major test of chief executive leadership last week: that of managing a graceful transition of power.
Motorola Inc., its customers and competitors, and Wall Street were all stunned by the announcement Wednesday that the 52-year-old scientist-turned-manager was leaving the prospering electronics giant immediately to take over the helm at the embattled Eastman Kodak Company.
Mr.
Fisher left Motorola with a number of high-stakes initiatives hanging fire.
The company's PowerPC microprocessor, jointly developed with I.B.M. and Apple Computer at a cost of over $1 billion to challenge the Intel Corporation's hammerlock on microchips for personal computers, is just beginning production.
Iridium, its plan to build and launch 66 satellites to create a telephone network in the sky, is in its formative stages.
And Motorola is wrestling with the need in most of its businesses to become more global, more deeply involved in consumer markets and more skilled in software design.

Ohio State and Snow Blow Past Penn State
Somewhere above the swirling snow and all the noise from the Horseshoe, wherever his season ticket may be, W. W. Hayes had to love this.
Let the coaches in their short-sleeve shirts draw up their puntrooskies and their pretty pass patterns.
In Woody Hayes's Ohio -- and a quarter-century after the last national championship, you better believe it still is -- they build a team the old-fashioned way, for days like this, when the snow blows over a treacherous field even before Halloween.
John Cooper, the beleaguered Buckeye coach with the perfect record this season, has adjusted to life in the 90's with a greater emphasis on speed.
But Ohio State's 24-6 victory over Penn State, on a long, gray afternoon for the Nittany Lions in Ohio Stadium, was created with speed made effective by power, the kind manufactured by an imposing offensive line that helped the Buckeyes take a large step toward a return to the Rose Bowl.
Big Gap Between Old and New
Ohio State, 8-0 over all and 5-0 in the Big Ten, demonstrated a surprisingly wide gap between itself and the newest member of the conference.
The Buckeyes rushed for 224 yards and were led by Raymont Harris, who gained 151 on 32 carries, both career highs.
He was the most effective beneficiary of the big men up front: left tackle Alan Kline, left guard Jason Winrow, center Jack Thrush, right guard Dave Monnot and 310-pound right tackle Korey Stringer.
"We just went and did what we do best," Winrow said, remembering the start of the third quarter.
"Run the ball inside the tackle box. We knew we had them where we wanted." A 68-yard drive, which Butler By'not'e ended from the 4-yard line, gave the Buckeyes an 18-point lead that was never seriously threatened.
With that line at work under conditions that favor their advantage in power, Harris and the Buckeyes imposed their will.
"I couldn't believe it," Harris said when asked about the weather.
"It was like, 'October? Snow?' I knew with the conditions like that, we would run the ball more. I liked that."
And the Buckeye defense, led by the relentless Dan (Big Daddy) Wilkinson, the 300-pound sophomore defensive tackle, transformed the Lions' passing game from an uncertain element of its offensive scheme into a liability.
The combination was overwhelming.
Penn State (5-2 over all, 2-2 in the Big Ten) is tied for sixth place.
The Lions entered the game with an average of 278 rushing yards a game.
Today they were held to 149 yards, including 123 by Ki-Jana Carter, the Columbus-area hero who ran for more than 100 yards for the sixth time this season and became the first to gain more than 100 this season against the Buckeyes.
But with his cutback ability diminished by the muddy conditions, and with Penn State's comeback hopes necessitating the pass, Carter gained just 29 yards after halftime and was hardly a factor.
Too many Lions could say that.
Quarterback Kerry Collins was 6 for 19 in the second half, and 13 for 39 over all, with 4 interceptions.
The Lions were held to 109 yards in the second half and went without a touchdown for the second time in eight games, including the 24-3 Blockbuster Bowl loss to Stanford at the end of last season.
"We didn't come into this game thinking, 'Wow, this is Penn State, an icon from the past,' " Harris said.
"Really, they were no more important than Purdue or Northwestern, or any other Big Ten team." 5 Penn State Turnovers
Penn State's first defeat on the road to a Big Ten team since the Lions lost here in 1975 came as the result of five turnovers, a blocked field goal, and an inability to take advantage of favorable field position and come from behind in the second half.
"We just did not have good field position throughout the game," Paterno observed.
His team's four possessions in the third quarter began at its 46-yard line, and at Ohio State's 44, 44 and 32.
The possessions ended with an interception, an unsuccessful fourth-down play from the Buckeye 13, a punt and a fumble.
The result was the type of celebration usually reserved for Michigan victories.
"All I smelled was liquor when the fans went on the field," Wilkinson said.

In the Traveler's Lost and Found
I HEARD it said a long time ago, in the days when the Egyptian Book of the Dead was regarded as a kind of tour guide to an acid trip, that on every good trip, something precious is lost.
It was said that this was in fact the mark of a good trip, the physical item lost representing a letting go of established forms of self -- of status, poses, connections, all manner of possessions.
And so it has been.
On every good trip, no matter where, there is a kind of redistribution of belongings, rather like bees pollinating.
The lost item reminds you that travel is a two-way process, a kind of binding of person and place in which the place too will have its say.
If a place speaks to you then something of you will be left there.
And so the strongest memories are often of tangible things lost, and intangibles gained.

And why should Kruger be given the job of sticking close to Passau and debriefing him?
Because he too is German-born, with a comprehensive knowledge of classical music (especially Mahler), and because he is an ardent admirer of Passau's.

Michael Sproul ("Before Setting Antitrust Policy, Study It," Viewpoints, Oct. 10) asserts that the Department of Justice "has never examined" the price effects of the price-fixing and bid-rigging schemes it prosecutes. (He examined 25 cases and found that prices did not fall following indictments or convictions.) On the contrary, the department commonly studies the price effects of conspiracies.
These studies typically are not placed in the trial record, however, and therefore normally cannot be made public.


And in the West, There's No Clear Favorite
Everything is more wide-open out West, from the style of play, to the race for the top spot.
At least four teams have legitimate title hopes.
Charles Barkley of the Suns wants a championship ring to scratch his bald head with.
Seattle, a superb defensive team, returns even deeper and hungrier.
The Portland Trail Blazers are ticked off at those who have written them off.
And Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon still has a championship dream.


Good Eating; Ethnic Pleasures, Elmhurst to Astoria
ELIAS CORNER (Diner's Journal)  (718) 932-1510; 31st Street and 24th Avenue, Astoria; $; no credit cards accepted
This popular, tiny neighborhood spot serves some of the freshest seafood in New York City.
There is a glass fish counter at the entrance and a tiny square kitchen behind it.
The small dining room with a cooler for beer and wine, a plastic shark mounted on the wall, and the pale fluorescent lighting is convivial.
There are no menus.
Regulars walk over to the counter and pick their seafood.


Like Snowflakes, Holidays Issues Differ
OVER the last 11 days, the United States Postal Service has issued its usual collection of Christmas stamps: four secular designs and one Madonna and Child.
But the secular stamps, in particular the one showing a snowman with a carrot nose, come in enough different designs to keep sharp-eyed noncollectors grazing through their mail to identify each one.
The four secular stamps, called Christmas Contemporary, are Snowman, Toy Soldier, Jack-in-the-Box and Reindeer.
The stamps are sold in two formats, the usual perforated lick-'em-stick-'em strips and panes, and the peelable self-adhesives, which come mounted on small cards.


Betting On The Baby Boom Bull Market
"THE baby boomers are doing to the stock market what they did to the housing market."
That quote, from Claudia Mott, the small-capitalization stock guru at Prudential Securities, sums up the best long-term bullish case now available for the stock market.
And it may prove to be right.


At Yale Repertory, Mamet's 'Oleanna'
WHY not take David Mamet's disputatious play about sexual harassment, "Oleanna," the season's opener at Yale Repertory, as an indictment of bureaucratic educational systems that imprison instructors and confound students?
That way everybody -- which means men and women -- suffers at the mercy of a common enemy.
And don't forget that a university campus is meant to give Mr.
Mamet's work a new imprimatur of environmental correctness that means more than its title.
But that's not what will go on drawing audiences to "Oleanna," even though Mr.
Mamet set up the play within the hallowed portals of academia.
To be sure, according to low-budget constraints, all the audience sees on stage is an office with a desk and a chair or two that a professor can pick up and hit a student over the head with, but we know there's a university out there.
And the on-stage talk is more of tenure and grades than of sexism and rape.


F.Y.I.
As a classroom assignment, seniors at Saint Agnes Boys High School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan sent in their questions about New York City.
Here are several.
Why Police Wear Blue
Q.
What is the history behind the color blue for uniforms for the New York City Police Department?
Why was it chosen?
A.
The department's official colors are blue, white and green.
Blue was chosen as the uniform color largely for practical purposes, said Officer Dominick Palermo, assistant curator of the Police Museum at the Police Academy in Manhattan.
"Sometimes you have to change a flat tire," he explained.
"It is much easier to get grease off of blue than white. Also, the color blue has meanings, such as courage and strength."
The uniform, modeled after that of the British police, was adopted in 1853.
New York officers resisted it at first, opting instead for street clothes and an eight-point star that identified them as police officers, because they thought the uniforms looked too British (not such a popular group in New York at that time).
On the Beam
Q.
What is the purpose of the big point at the top of the Empire State Building?
A.
The top part of the "point" is an antenna used by 13 major FM radio stations as well as Channel 41, a Spanish-language television station.
The tippy-top of this antenna transmits the Home Shopping Network's signal.
Map Help
Q.
Why is it that even though 12th Avenue and the Henry Hudson Parkway connect, they still remain separate streets on maps of the city?
A.
Lisa Daglian, spokeswoman for the City Department of Transportation, says the Henry Hudson Parkway is also known by three other names south of 57th Street: West Street, West Side Highway and 12th Avenue.
The map you have may be trying to let you know that and telling you to look for signs accordingly.
A Lot of Tokens
Q.
How much does it cost to run the New York City subway system?
A.
Some $2 billion a year, with half from fares and half from government subsidies, which the Transit Authority began receiving in 1964.
Cabby Specifications
Q.
What type of training do New York cabdrivers need and what type of license are they required to have?
A.
All New York City taxi drivers -- there are now 40,000 -- must be at least 19 years old and "proficient" in English, hold a valid driver's license from any state, have a good driving record and be felony free.
They must get a license from the Taxi and Limousine Commission ($62) and go to taxi school for 20, 40 or 80 hours, depending on their language skills and knowledge of city geography.
No More Duck Intrigue
Q.
I am reading "The Catcher in the Rye," which poses the intriguing question that no one really answers -- where do the ducks in Central Park go during the winter, or does someone take care of them there?
A.
About 15 types of waterfowl pass through Central Park during the year.
Most migrate south, but many Canada geese and mallards stay all year, fending for themselves or relying on the kindness of strangers.
Ebbets Neighborhood
Q.
What section of Brooklyn was Ebbets Field located in?
A.
Ebbets Field was built in 1913 in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, so desolate at the time that the area was also known as Pigtown, Goatville, Tin Can Alley and Crow Hill.
Ebbets Field's first game, an exhibition match between the Dodgers and the Yankees, was that same year.
Man on a Horse
Q.
On 59th Street by Central Park is a statue of a golden man on a horse.
Who is he and what is he pointing at?
A.
The statue is of Gen.
William Tecumseh Sherman with Victory, dedicated on May 30, 1903.
In fact, he isn't pointing, Victory is.
But the way it was designed by the sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, their motions are meant to look as one, according to "Manhattan's Outdoor Sculpture" by Gayle Cohen (Prentice Hall, 1988).
The statue had lost its golden sheen over the years, but around 1990 the Victorian Society in America spiffed it up.
As for whom or what Victory is pointing at, Abbey Lavine, a reference assistant at the New-York Historical Society, said, "Well, at whatever Victory would be pointing at." JENNIFER STEINHAUER

When One N.F.L. Coaching Legend Catches Up to Another
If the Dolphins beat the Kansas City Chiefs today in Miami, the victory would be No. 324 in regular-season or playoff games for Don Shula over his 31 years as a National Football League head coach.
And that figure would tie the career record that took George Halas 40 years to set with the Chicago Bears.
The 63-year-old Shula said that when he was a young coach, he remembered being in awe of Halas, the receiver, the Hall of Fame founder, coach and iron-fisted ruler of the Bears.
Shula had other memories from his days as a defensive back.


Hold the Wine And Pass the Beer
BEER is big: there are more varieties of beer than ever on store shelves; new breweries are opening; restaurants are beginning to have beer lists, and many restaurants are designing special menus to accompany an assortment of beers.
The beer dinner is replacing the wine dinner.
And it can also happen at home.
At a restaurant beer dinner, an assortment of four or five beers are chosen, like wines, to accompany certain dishes.
Sometimes the dishes themselves are made with beer.


Julie L. Strauss, Matthew Russman
Julie Lynn Strauss, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, and Matthew David Russman, an associate at the New York law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, were married last evening.
Rabbi Martin Freedman officiated at the Marriott Financial Center Hotel in New York.
Mrs.
Russman, 25, is a daughter of Carol and David Strauss of Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
She graduated cum laude from the University of Michigan, from which her husband graduated magna cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
She received her law degree from the Brooklyn Law School.
Her father is a senior vice president of Oppenheimer &amp; Company, the New York investment bank.
Her mother is an owner of Travel Four, a travel agency in Clifton, N.J.


ARNOLD GLIMCHER AND HIS ART WORLD ALL-STARS
Here I thought female artists had come a long way maybe since Life magazine's 1951 photograph of the Irascibles.
That famous image, which brought together 15 abstract painters like Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, at least included one woman, Hedda Sterne.
Art dealer Arnold Glimcher got his start by promoting Louise Nevelson.
Your cover photograph of his stable of stars -- in a pose recalling the shot of more than four decades ago -- has not a single woman.
I sense a missing link.
A case for the Guerrilla Girls?

On Pushing (Not Cranking) the Mower
MANY gardening trends have been displacing the traditional ways, but plant tenders have probably been so busy they haven't noticed.
Now that the season is slowing down to a saner pace, there is time for reflection.
The suburbs are becoming quieter.
There is less of that deafening noise from the power mowers and more of that gentle hum from the old-fashioned push 'em yourself reel mowers.
The older models are coming back!


SUNDAY, October 31, 1983; IN THE BEGINNING
It's called the Big Bang Challenge.
Unfortunately, it's not a contest to see who can make a better universe.
It's a contest to come up with a better name for the beginning of the universe we've already got.
The magazine Sky and Telescope is running the contest.
Why?
Because the Big Bang, as a name, is inaccurate, "ugly," "trivializing" and "irreverent." The deadline has passed, but not to worry; there's no prize.
What's worrisome is junking the catchiest title for a cosmological theory since Genesis, and a prime candidate for the Pulitzer Prize in Alliteration.
And what's more upsetting is this reverence business.
How deep in pomp must one be standing even to think of trying to make science reverent?


Going on a Jag
Budget Rent a Car is adding 500 Jaguar XJ6 sedans to its fleet next month in 10 United States cities.
The rate is $59 a day.

The company has sent out 10,000 invitations in Seattle, Atlanta, Detroit, Dallas/ Ft.
Worth, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Boston, Chicago, Phoenix and San Francisco.

Spreading the Gospel of Improvement Districts
AN astute director of a business improvement district usually has some telling statistics at the ready.
Gretchen Dykstra has more than a few.
Ms.
Dykstra, the president of the 18-month-old Times Square Business Improvement District, had it at the tip of her tongue last week that purse snatching and pickpocketing in the district were down 43 percent in the three months from April through June this year.
In that period last year the district's uniformed but unarmed security officers were just getting started.


Prosecuting Bucket Slaying Could Be Tricky, Experts Say
At the outset, the case against Pedro Jose Gil looked fairly simple.
The police quickly identified him as the man who hurled a bucket of spackling compound off the roof of a Washington Heights apartment house on Oct. 8, killing a police officer, and investigators said Mr.
Gil confessed soon after his arrest.
But for Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, taking the case to a grand jury for an indictment could be turning into something of a tightrope walk.
There is a good chance, legal experts say, that rather than indicting for murder, the grand jury could indict Mr.
Gil on a far less severe manslaughter charge, potentially exposing Mr.
Morgenthau to criticism that he was too easy on the defendant.
Mr.
Morgenthau also runs the remote risk that the grand jury would not indict Mr.
Gil at all.


Kathryn George, William Tyree
Kathryn Carolyn George, a deputy manager in trade finance, and William Brophy Tyree, the manager of the treasury department, both at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Company, the private bank in New York, were married yesterday.
Msgr.
William McKeevor performed the ceremony at St.
Agnes Roman Catholic Church in Key Biscayne, Fla.
Mrs.
Tyree, 28, is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Quintin H. George of Sudbury, Mass.
She graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
Her father is the programs manager of Navy communications at the Raytheon Company, the diversified manufacturing concern, in Sudbury.
Her mother is the assistant to the superintendent of Lincoln Sudbury Regional High School.


Striving for Votes


Viennese Works, Halloween Flavor
TWO musicians who play in the New York Philharmonic, the violinist Asya Meshberg of Darien and the violist Katherine Greene of Guilford, founded the Lumina Quartet, taking that name they said because they hoped "to illuminate audiences by sharing their passion for chamber music."
With New York colleagues Roberta Cooper (also the cellist of the Wave Hill Trio) and the violinist Natasha Shamis, Lumina begins its third season at Norwalk Community-Technical College today at 3:30, the program focusing on three Viennese masters, Mozart, Schubert and Hugo Wolf (tickets at the door).

Oct. 24-30: Protesting Violence; Angry Cabbies Jam Midtown Manhattan
The frustration felt by New York City taxi drivers spilled over last week as about 5,000 of them jammed midtown Manhattan with their cabs and turned one evening's rush hour upside down to express their horror over violent crimes against drivers.
Thirty-five have been killed this year and 45 last year, almost always as they sat behind the wheel and a passenger suddenly became an attacker.

ARNOLD GLIMCHER AND HIS ART WORLD ALL-STARS
Can I interest you in the work of a female artist, Mr.
Ovitz?
Or perhaps that of someone more colorful?
Probably not.


Pucker Up
The new wrinkle in fashion is one that is permanently pressed into the shirt, vest, blouse, jacket or pants ensemble.
The wrinkled look is part of a pleating explosion the designer Issey Miyake set off five years ago, opening up a whole new world of surface textures and decoration.
Many men are wearing Mr.
Miyake's abstractly wrinkled polyester shirts, which are often hidden under traditional jackets -- a subtle way of embracing a new style.
Occasionally, one can see a wool jacket, also permanently wrinkled.
Other men are wearing the designer's crinkly pleated polyester vest in stained-glass colors.


Los Angeles 'Fagins' Admit To Series of Bank Robberies
They were modern-day Fagins, training young boys not to pick pockets, as in Dickens's "Oliver Twist," but to invade banks with automatic weapons, terrorize patrons and tellers and flee with money in high-speed freeway getaways in stolen cars.
There was never any physical evidence to implicate these Fagins, Robert Sheldon Brown, better known as "Cas" on the streets of South-Central Los Angeles, and Donzell Lamar Thompson, or "C-Dog." For they stayed several blocks away, supervising sometimes as many as five bank robberies a day over four years, using boys as young as 13.


Looking for Love


Magical Threads
ONE day, Manolo left New York and a successful business making hats to live in a fishing hut on a deserted beach in Venezuela with his partner, Arnoldo Ferrara Ocanto.
The Cuban designer took some boxes of fabrics, a hand-operated sewing machine and a giant generator, because there was no electricity there, and sewed away in isolation for two years.
He also packed a trunk of books, among them "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and design histories of Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior.
Mr.
Ferrara's house near Cuyagua, where they lived from 1989 to 1991, has a tin roof, walls covered with bamboo, and at the doorstep, stones that washed up on the beach.
It leans against a mountain, with steps to the second floor carved into the rock.

It is part of the Brooklyn Public Library, not the New York Public Library.


ARNOLD GLIMCHER AND HIS ART WORLD ALL-STARS
Glimcher surely must be understating his appeal when he says that only one artist a week is knocking on his door.
Of course, he means certified Art Stars, but I can name at least a hundred artists who have expressed a willingness to be represented by him.
I myself have expressed my eagerness to contribute to his stable.
Alas, he has never acknowledged my missives.
Guess I'll just quit painting and try to sell him my screenplay.

Sally A. Kennedy, Herbert Fanning
Sally A. Kennedy, an editor at the American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., which trains insurance agents and financial planners, was married yesterday to Herbert H. Fanning, a research associate for the Marshall Laboratory in Philadelphia, an automotive research laboratory of the Du Pont Company.

She is a daughter of the late John and Eleanor Kennedy.


HAITIAN MILITARY CONDEMNED BY U.N.
Still hoping that a solution can be brokered in Haiti, the Security Council condemned the Haitian military today for blocking the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide but stopped short of even repeating its warnings of a tighter trade embargo.
The statement was issued by the Security Council President, Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg of Brazil, on the day originally set for the exiled President to be restored to office under an agreement signed in July.


Matt Dillon May Look Tough, But Don't Get Him Wrong
If face dictates function in Hollywood, then Matt Dillon's bristling black eyebrows, bottomless pit of a gaze and stubborn jaw have stamped him for the moody, explosive rebel roles; he has even said admiring things about Mickey Rourke.
And, with a few exceptions, surly, street-smart guys are the sort of roles that find him, in films like "Drugstore Cowboy," "Over the Edge," "My Bodyguard," "The Outsiders" and "A Kiss Before Dying." For years the press has suggested that Mr.
Dillon has been merely playing extreme versions of himself, and interviewers repeatedly have found him tardy, coy, arrogant, withholding.
But Mr.
Dillon is the first to arrive for a drink at a neighborhood bar on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, and his grin is genial, even expansive.
Then he flops back in his chair, long legs sprawling and, throwing up his hands, says by way of an opener, "So, like, what's with Mogadishu, huh?"

Oct. 24-30: Cloning Humans; A Genetic Experiment Ignites a Bioethical Debate
Scientists who want to try genetic engineering, the insertion of genes into human cells to cure disease, must go through endless red tape.
But, as the public learned last week, two scientists who wanted to try the ultimate genetic experiment, cloning human embryos, needed approval only from their hospital's ethics advisory board.
Dr.
Jerry Hall and Dr.
Robert Stillman of George Washington University easily got permission to divide human embryos into identical twins or triplets.
The researchers worked only with abnormal embryos, which never would have developed into babies.
All died within a week.
Now, they say, it is up to others to decide whether to make cloning, artificially creating identical twins, triplets or quadruplets, a practical reality.

Designers Turn New York Into a Fashion Big Top
The New York fashion industry begins its week of runway shows today, but this time, along with the new clothes, there is a brand-new showcase.
For the first time, virtually the entire New York fashion establishment is presenting spring collections in big white tents in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, under the auspices of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
A centralized approach, a longtime objective of Seventh Avenue, is standard in the two other fashion capitals, Paris and Milan.
The hope is that slick, world-class presentations will attract more international media attention and more fashion buyers, spurring exports.

Jury Rules Lilco Dismissal Was Illegal Age Bias
The Long Island Lighting Company engaged in age discrimination when it dismissed a 57-year-old nuclear engineer, a Federal jury has concluded.
The company has been ordered to pay the engineer more than $2 million in lost wages and damages.
The jury found that Lilco harmed Donald Binder, a 31-year employee, when it dismissed him in February 1987 without offering him another job.
It also found that Lilco "willfully" violated the rules and regulations of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in dismissing Mr.
Binder.


Best Way to Play Depends on Objective
ONE can start a pretty good argument by asking players to identify the "best" form of bridge and the reasons for their choices.
Some traditionalists will argue for traditional rubber bridge or its modern equivalent, Chicago, pointing to the flexibility of playing times, the comfort of the chairs, the challenge of a money stake and the absence of confusing conventions.
Most experts will select head-to-head team play scored by imps, which is the norm in serious competition at all levels.
But they will admit, if pressed, that board-a-match scoring, with its emphasis on overtricks, is a better measure of ability, though virtually obsolete: the weaker players dislike it because they never win.

THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: Housing -- The Agenda; Housing's Waiting List Includes Policy for Growth
Choosing to focus on one of the more visible aspects of New York City's chronic housing shortage -- homelessness -- the mayoral candidates have given scant campaign attention to housing preservation and redevelopment issues.
But the challenge to the city's next mayor -- the Democratic incumbent, David N. Dinkins, or Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican-Liberal -- will remain how to best use city housing resources in the face of shrinking revenues, and how to balance complex redevelopment needs with conflicting social and political interests.


Neighborhood Reports: Sheepshead Bay; Residents Cry Foul Over Air
The gentlest breeze wafting inland off the Atlantic is like a deadbolt that renders hundreds of residents in Sheepshead Bay prisoners in their own homes -- stunk in, so to speak, by odors emanating from the 100 million gallons of raw sewage processed each day at a nearby treatment plant.
"There's no delicate way to describe it: the plant constantly reeks of toilet odors," said Bernie Leitner, 63, who lives with his wife, Sondra, in the Kings Bay Cooperative Apartments.
The building where the Leitners live is directly across Avenue Y from what is officially called the Coney Island Water Pollution Control Facility, though the plant is actually in Sheepshead Bay.


A Line of Clothing For the Office
To the Editor:
I appreciated Liz Logan's Oct. 24 article, "Our Ms. Brooks (Brothers)," because it focused on a source of comfortable officewear for women.
But your characterization of J. Crew as focusing on leisure-time clothing is not entirely true.
In fact, our Collection line offers professional women clothes that are decidedly more sophisticated and chic than the "Miss Hathaway" styles that Ms.
Logan refers to in her piece.

Is It Too Late For the Civil?
To the Editor:
What an excellent, though saddening, article on the demise of civility in our culture.
I was especially stuck by the part about "getting even" with middle-management weenies and jerks who hand out layoff slips, etc., as a blue-collar art form.


The Executive Computer; Microsoft Springs Forward in Word Processing Software
THERE is no such thing as the final word in word processing software.
The three leading programs for Windows computers -- Microsoft Word, Wordperfect and Ami Pro -- regularly leapfrog one another with new and better features.
This month, after two years of development, both Microsoft Word and Wordperfect hopped up with new versions.
It is always difficult to choose a winner in word processing software, simply because all three of the leading programs are so good.
In this latest round, the good get better.


Susan Powter
Here, at 7:45 A.M., near Madison Square Garden, the men with the coffee carts are everywhere.
They look so innocent, sliding napkins into bags, while their golden slices of poundcake gleam in their wrappers.
Thick swirls of icing circle their Danish, and the powdered sugar on their doughnuts beckons like fresh fallen snow.
But the women stride past, resolute, looking ahead, at each other, at their watches.

FERMAT'S THEOREM
The announcement that Andrew Wiles has in hand, at long last, the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is justifiably cheered by mathematicians everywhere ("Fermat's Theorem," by James Gleick, Oct. 3).
Like many of my contemporaries, I was bored by the problems presented in grammar school math texts: Mary's problem measuring lengths of gingham for a dress or Dick's dilemmas in garden geometry.
However, Fermat's conjecture was plain enough to be minimally understood by adolescent minds.
And the happy fact that it had stumped great mathematicians for over three centuries was added romance.

Worried Anew, Europe Asks How Best to Keep the Peace
EUROPEAN nation states have always been each other's worst enemies.
After the convulsion of World War II the Western European nations agreed to start over.
The European Community and the American-led NATO alliance guaranteed that they would never fight each other again and formed a bulwark against the new external threat from the Soviet Union.
But that is now gone, and where Communism used to be, history has fallen back into the old fratricidal patterns.


Swedes Move Tourism To Private Sector
In an effort to save money, Sweden has become one of the first countries to end Government operation of its tourist offices and let private industry do the job.
The Swedish Tourist Board is now the Swedish Travel and Tourism Council, using the phrase Next Stop Sweden for its marketing program in 11 countries besides Sweden.
The Swedish Travel and Tourism council is owned by more than 300 shareholders, including travel-related companies like Scandinavian Airlines System and the Swedish National Railroads, but the Swedish Government continues to provide funds, said Torborg Fagerlund, the press officer who is running the New York office until a director is named.
The Government will pay 72 percent of the program's expenses in the first year, 63 percent in the second and 47 percent in the third.


In the Region/Westchester; 73 Estate Homes (Maybe); Golf Course Is Included
WHEN Jack Nicklaus dug a shovelful of dirt at a recent groundbreaking for a residential-golf-course development in Purchase, he quipped that the hole should be filled in immediately, "otherwise, it might be declared a wetland tomorrow."
Those at the ceremony laughed, realizing that he was alluding to the long and convoluted history of the project.
The Country Club of Purchase had to overcome myriad environmental challenges before getting final approvals last summer.


Daniel Bernstein and Beth Goldstein
Dr.
Beth Lynn Goldstein, a pediatric resident at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, was married in Omaha last evening to Daniel Mark Bernstein, a lingerie manufacturer in New York.

She graduated from Colorado State University and received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Boston University and an M.D. from the University of Nebraska.
Her father is a partner in Bahr, Vermeer &amp; Haecker, an architectural firm in Omaha.


The Little Movie Company That Might
Like the little engine that could, Gramercy Pictures is trying to pull a heavy load of toys up a mountain.

"At Gramercy, we get all the movies that are hard to market."


Political Memo; Farrakhan Posing a Difficult New Challenge for Black Officials
Nearly a decade after Louis H. Farrakhan became a symbol of ethnic tension, he has re-emerged in the 1993 campaigns, again forcing politicians to confront the raw power of race in politics.
Mr.
Farrakhan, the militant minister of the Nation of Islam, is trying to soften his image and deflect attention from his attacks on Jews and on mainstream black politicians by emphasizing his concern for the troubles of inner cities.
But he has still managed to put many black candidates in an uncomfortable position.


Corrections
A chart in the Neighborhood Report last week gave 1992 crime statistics, rather than the 1993 figures, for the 68th Precinct in Brooklyn.

The Tigers' victory set up a conference showdown at Penn on Saturday, with both teams 7-0 over all, 4-0 in the conference.

Tanya Gibson, Brian Clark
BRIAN CLARK, 33, grew up on a farm in Palmyra, Pa., and spent most autumn nights on his back porch, listening to crickets, cows and Phillies games on the radio.
After working at a radio station in Harrisburg, Pa., for several years, he moved to Manhattan in 1990, taking a job as the chief research editor at Lear's magazine.
At first, his dating life was about as slow as the airport in Palmyra.


Reeves Doesn't Worry About a Once-in-a-While Rivalry
Dan Reeves usually greets reporters with a smile and a howdy.
Every now and then, he tells a homespun story about his days in Georgia or when he was playing with the Dallas Cowboys.
He makes fun of reporters' clothes, tries to remember their names.
His easy style has made the Giants' camp more like a smoothly run business.
Camp Giants is Camp Happy Face.
Then there is Jets Coach Bruce Coslet, who is holed up in his bunker, waiting for reinforcements.
Say the wrong thing to Coslet and you might get this kind of response: "You talking to me? Do I amuse you?"

A Word to the Wise Diarist: Enter With Caution
GIVEN the uproar over Senator Bob Packwood's diaries, which the Senate ethics committee has voted to subpoena, one is tempted to wonder why he kept the journals in the first place and why he disclosed their existence.
Why, in these post-Watergate years, would any politician maintain -- and reveal -- a potentially damaging record of his public and private affairs?
The question goes to the heart of both diary-keeping and our fascination with diarists.
Every morning for 25 years, Mr.
Packwood has apparently made notes on the previous day's events.
Unlike those writers who use their diaries as strictly private therapy sessions, the Senator seems to have written with an audience in mind: He has willed the diary, he says, to the Oregon Historical Society, for release "years" after his death.


Hitler's Handmaiden
To the Editor:
Kudos to John Simon for a balanced review.
Unlike others who have written on Leni Riefenstahl's career, Mr.
Simon is able to discern the difference between ideological naivete and artistic integrity.
Like Ezra Pound, Celine, G. W. Pabst and Knut Hamsun, Leni Riefenstahl never compromised her art, whatever unfortunate lapses of judgment she may have made.

Commercial Property: Upgraded Services; Using Fiber Optics to Attract -- or Keep -- Tenants
TO most of the world, fiber optic technology is the gateway to grandiose telecommunications setups.
Superhighways of information, massive computer networks, these are the things of which fiber optics dreams -- and news headlines -- are made.
But to landlords and leasing agents, the hair-thin wires, which transmit data at almost unimaginable speeds, have a more narrowly defined role: They get tenants.

Voters Guide; After All the Talk, It's Decision Time
AFTER thousands of handshakes, tons of chicken dinners and millions of dollars in nasty and overblown television commercials, the big day is now just two days away, and for better or worse it's time to decide.
You can be forgiven for thinking the main thing that has divided the incumbent Mayor, David N. Dinkins, and and his Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is whether George J. Marlin, the Conservative Party candidate, should have been included in their debates.
But as the chart at right shows, there are some real distinctions between the men who would be Mayor.
At the same time that you are being asked to decide who should spend the next four years in City Hall, you will get to weigh in on whether eight years in office is enough for anyone.
If it is approved, ballot proposal No. 4 would force candidates who win on Tuesday and are re-elected in four years to be out by 2001.
Meantime, voters on Staten Island will take the next step in deciding whether what Gotham joined together man should put asunder.
Finally, you may just have a hot race for the City Council in your neighborhood.
So go see.
You have nothing to lose but your vote.

An Emergency Unit With Children in Mind

SUNDAY, October 31, 1983; UPWARD MOBILITY
A dog to watch: the lurcher.
Favored by poachers in days gone by, the lurcher was usually a cross between a greyhound and a collie or terrier of some sort.
It was bred and trained to hunt quietly, stealthily and illegally for its criminal owners, and scorned by gentlefolk.
Not anymore.
For some time now the lurcher has been rising in social status.
Princess Anne has one, and the dogs appear often at the side of estate owners and horsey gentry in the United States and in Britain.
The lurcher has thus leaped (lurched?) over the vast golden-retrievered middle class to become a dog prized by precisely the folks (fancy) who used to hang the folks (lowly) who bred it.


Clinton at Work: Is Motion the Same Thing as Action?
"REMEMBER," said the silver-haired Democratic elder, one of the members of the capital's permanent establishment that watches them come and watches them go, "remember that Clinton is trying to do a lot, and that what he's trying to do is very difficult, and that he starts from a position of weakness."
Except from the true believers, that is the best one hears about Bill Clinton in political Washington these days.
Cut him some slack, people say.


Chamber Groups Vie With Folk
CHAMBER and folk music are prominent in the musical scene this week, beginning today at 3 P.M., when the clarinet-piano duo of Jean Kopperud and Cameron Grant bring Brahms, Bernstein, Vaughan-Williams and Gershwin to Wave Hill in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
For driving directions, the number to call is (718) 549-3200.
Today at 4 P.M., members of the North Country Chamber Players -- the pianist Bernard Rose, the clarinetist Allan Bluestine and the cellist Chris Finckel -- give a recital in Reisinger Auditorium on the Yonkers campus of Sarah Lawrence College.
The program includes Elliott Carter's Cello Sonata, six weeks ahead of the composer's 85th birthday, and the rarely heard Trio of Alexander von Zemlinsky.
To make reservations, call 395-2411.

As Aristide Fails to Return, His Foes Celebrate in Haiti
Starting at sundown on Friday and lasting through the night, the streets of the capital echoed with gunfire as far-right groups and soldiers opposed to the return of the nation's exiled President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, celebrated their success in defying the international effort to bring about his return by today.
By dawn, the desolate scene left by the revelry and spent gunpowder spoke volumes about the mood of this country, and of the price it has paid for the army coup 25 months ago that overthrew Haiti's first democratically elected Government.


Security Blankets
The moment I opened my door to scoop up The Times, my eye landed on it: a picture of the new Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, confident and composed in a trim jacket.
Justice Ginsburg is no slouch when it comes to putting herself together.
Her tightly combed hair is held in place with a chic ribbon bow.
Her glasses are stylishly big.
When she turned up at the Senate last summer in a swingy pleated skirt and striped tunic-length top with a string of beads, she looked more pulled together than any woman in the Washington eye since Jackie Kennedy Onassis.
The jacket?
It happened to be an Armani, but the label is not important.
The point is that for her first official day on the job, the woman just knew she needed a well-fitting jacket.


In Times Square, Turning Profits From 'Gin Mills'
AT 9 A.M. in Rudy's Bar, Ernest Schroeder sits on a stool counting money.
There are many $100 bills, rolls and rolls of quarters, and everything in between.
The cash, around $12,000, represents the weekend take from his four Times Square bars.
At a time when saloons everywhere are struggling, Mr.
Schroeder says that his establishments -- Rudy's, the Full Moon Saloon, the Holland Bar and the Savoy -- are doing well.
The bars are loud, the beer cheap, the food almost free -- and the clientele of a class that would not be terribly affected if the stock market crashed.

Neighborhood Repots: Upper East Side; After Fire, Church Seeks Aid
The Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth Avenue at 90th Street is starting a million-dollar fund-raising campaign this week to help restore the church, which was badly damaged by a three-alarm fire on Aug. 7.
Fire destroyed half the chancel area of the Gothic stone building, with damages estimated at more than $3 million.
Perhaps the biggest loss was an enormous, elegant Austin organ, considered one of the finest in the city.
The Episcopal church had long been noted for the quality of its musical offerings.

But he and his supervisors found a solution in a basement office of the precinct station house: a band of eager auxiliary officers who were more than happy to assist Officer King.

Business Diary: October 24 - 29
THE ECONOMY A Plan Is Born.
Now, Watch Out!
O.K., it's 1,342 pages, and it's so complicated that to try to understand it all could put you in need of some heavy-duty health care.
But look at it this way, President Clinton said, as he plunked his mammoth health care plan in Congress' lap last week: "None of us could devise a system more complex, more burdensome, more administratively costly than the one we have now." He's got a point there.
But then again, the present system wasn't built in a day, and he's trying to create a brand new labyrinth in a single stroke.
The plan has evolved during its months of gestation, notably in new limits on Government subsidies -- an attempt to allay fears that Big Government will take on an unworkable burden.
But for all the talk of his waffling, all the plan's revisions, he's stuck to one razor-sharp goal: "health care security for all Americans."


In America; Mayoral Homestretch
It's almost over, and for that we should be grateful.
With the poll numbers exceptionally close, the endgame of Dinkins-Giuliani II is at the mercy of the intangibles -- momentum, turnout, the honesty of poll respondents and the weather.
A nor'easter on Tuesday, depressing the turnout in poor neighborhoods, would likely blow the incumbent out of City Hall.
Balmy weather and a huge turnout by blacks and women could keep him there for four more years, which would mean, of course, four more years of extraordinary personal abuse.

ON Monday, in the gilded rococo dream of a living room of her Trump Tower triplex, Ivana Trump was chattering away at a cocktail benefit for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
She was wearing earrings as bold as her chandeliers and a tight red cocktail dress with some give to it so that she could really work the party, which was also in celebration of the publication of her second novel, "Free to Love," and the model Fabio's first novel, "Pirate."


Olivetti Firm Chief Faces New Charges In Italy Corruption
Magistrates ordered the arrest today on bribery charges of Carlo De Benedetti, head of the Olivetti computer company and among the most senior and best-known Italian tycoons to be ensnared in the country's huge corruption scandal.

A spokesman for his holding company, Compagnie Industriali Riunite, said he was expected to return to the country on Tuesday.

7 DIE, 11 WOUNDED IN ULSTER ATTACK
The wave of sectarian violence that has accelerated in Northern Ireland in the last eight days continued Saturday night when two gunmen shot and killed at least seven people in a bar in a village in the western part of the British Province, police said.
A Protestant paramilitary organization, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killings, which it said were in retaliation for the deaths last Saturday of nine Protestants in a bomb detonated by the Irish Republican Army in Belfast.
Police said early this morning that at least two of the dead in the Londonderry County shooting last night were Protestants, and that 11 people had been hospitalized.


Unwanted Poem Tendencies
MONDAY Thought of joining the Navy today, but realize I must first resolve my closet unwanted-poem tendencies.
The Navy's one-page guide to sexual harassment, which defines harassment in terms of traffic lights (red for rape, green for "hi"), specifically lists "unwanted poems" in the yellow-light category.
But which poems are unwanted?
Perhaps the Department of the Navy is preparing a follow-up guide.
In the meantime, what will I do?
Just bought a collection of William Carlos Williams poems.
Have I made a terrible blunder, destroying my chances for a promising Naval career?
TUESDAY My father was in the Navy.
My cousin was, too, on a submarine, and used to bring exotic gifts from faraway ports.
I am drawn to the Navy, but still I worry about my poetic orientation.
Someone did send me a poem recently.
That's what led me to experiment with the William Carlos Williams volume.
A friend sent a poem by Kenneth Koch that is a parody of a Williams poem about plums in the refrigerator.
It wasn't that I wanted the Koch poem.
Not at first.
I mean, I didn't ask for it or anything.
But once it arrived, a photocopied sheet folded smoothly in a crisp white envelope, I wanted it very much indeed.
Should I have resisted temptation?
I enjoyed it extravagantly.


Corporate America's Diagnosis of the Clinton Health Plan
A BIT like prophets whose message has finally been heeded after long years of being ignored, many employee benefits executives said "amen" when President Clinton trumpeted the need to bring health costs under control and make care universally available.
But many business people fear that the changes the President sent to Congress last week may increase their costs, which are still rising at more than double the general inflation rate.


100 Years Of Design


Neighborhood Report; Hanging Baskets
Central Park employees last week began hanging the first of 140 new wastebaskets on lampposts.
The 20-gallon black steel baskets, raised four feet off the ground to discourage rodents, are part of a $27,000 project to improve trash collection.
Next month, the park's 55-gallon drums will be replaced with plastic covered carts that hold 100 gallons.
In the spring, blue carts for recycling bottles and cans are to be installed.
The new containers are for south of 72d Street; the program will be extended next year.

Synagogue Dispute In a Shore Community
Perhaps the most enlightening aspects of the Sept. 19 article on Deal, "Syrian Jews and Town at Odds Over Synagogue," are the parts that were not said.
There is mention of the Catholic church a few blocks from the proposed synagogue; St.
Mary's is a magnificent edifice, complete with bell tower and a crucifix high above, along with an announcement board facing Richmond Avenue.
What is not mentioned is that the Synagogue of Deal on the main thoroughfare has no identifying marks.
The most telling comment, paraphrased, was that there have always been large numbers of Catholics and Jews in the town, but they always got along until the Syrians moved in.
What was actually being said is that until Jews became discernible, everyone tolerated them.
Before the incursion of Syrian Jews, Deal did not have a Jewish house of worship.


An Artistic Safari for the Elephant
The african elephant, the largest land animal, means different things to people these days, but many contemporary attitudes were anticipated in the art of sub-Saharan people.
The beast's awesome size, aggressiveness, friendliness, exploitation and endangerment all come alive in "Elephant: The Animal and Its Ivory in African Art," an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through March 27.
A potent symbol of power and royalty to Africans, the elephant has been depicted throughout the continent since antiquity on both humble and magnificent objects.
The images in the show, which focus on the animal's massive size, fanlike ears, huge tusks and wrinkled trunk, take the form of sculpture, masks, headdresses, stools and the prow of a boat.
Many of the works incorporate elephant ivory, bone, hair or hide.


In a Stream of Wagner, Glints of Gold
Remember when Wagner recordings were a precious rarity; when most of the operas weren't even available, and when their first appearance on long-playing vinyl disks was itself big news?
Many of you probably do not, since that era goes back nearly 30 years.
Today Wagner operas pop off the assembly line with all the frequency -- and, one sometimes fears, uniformity -- of mass-produced industrial artifacts.
The recent output of the Wagner recording industry has yielded five complete operas and an overture collection.
The most surprising release of the bunch is a Naxos recording of "Der fliegende Hollander" from Austrian Radio, with Pinchas Steinberg conducting mostly unknown or little-known singers (8.660025/6; two CD's).
The performance is completely respectable, full of idiomatic verve and solid singing.


Around the Town


Oct. 24-30: A New Network; 'Star Trek': Yet Another Generation
Normally, Paramount Communications Inc.'s announcement last week that it planned a fifth national network would have sent an electric shock through the broadcast business.
But coming in so turbulent a period in the industry's history, the announcement barely curled the toes in TV executives' Armani loafers.


Russians' Freewheeling Spirit Defies the Burden of History
THERE is probably no better indicator of recent arrivals in the United States than the cabdrivers in New York City.
During the late 1970's and early 1980's, it seemed that the Russians, whose arrival had been humorously prophesied in the 60's by the film "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!" had taken command of almost all of the yellow chariots.
Unlike other influxes, this one was also making itself felt in the galleries.
The latest manifestation in Westchester is "From Chaos to Creation: Russian Art From 1972 to 1992" at the Rye Arts Center.
It is a sign of an improved -- if more confused -- world situation that, while most of the 17 individuals and partnerships represented live wholly or partly in the United States, at least three have chosen to remain in the motherland, and all have had exposure in fashionable Manhattan galleries.


Retiree Group Backs Most of Clinton Plan
To the Editor:
The headline on an Oct. 24 front-page article states that the American Association of Retired Persons objects to the President's health plan because it "slights the aged." This does not reflect our position on health care reform.
The American health security bill, would on balance, substantially help most older Americans.

The Road Is a Test of a Driver's Character
The article on the "Scenic Road" designation of the Merritt Parkway (Sept. 26) should include the severe character tests that this summer's road repairs have imposed upon all drivers.
Not a day, not even a holiday, has gone by when every citizen has not had to consider who he or she is or wants to be.
The problem looks simple.
"Right lane closed 1/2 mile ahead," tells you what's coming.
But do you stay in the right lane until the barrier itself is reached and then try to squeeze yourself left?
Or do you go demurely left a good half mile away to enter slow-moving traffic in single file?
If you do, how do you feel about those still speeding by on your right, who expect you to let them in ahead of you later?
Do you cut them out by staying grimly bumper to bumper until two lanes open again?


ARNOLD GLIMCHER AND HIS ART WORLD ALL-STARS
The implication in your article that Arne Glimcher is in any way ashamed of his Jewishness was offensive.
I have always found him to be comfortable and proud of his Jewish identity.
His name was not changed from a "WASP-ish" Arne to a Hollywood-pandering "Jewish" Arnie.
His credit on "The Mambo Kings" is the same Arne that he uses everywhere.
Further, the notion that he would cultivate important relationships with the Jewish community for purely personal gain is grotesque.


New Horror for Sarajevo: Muslims Killing Muslims
After a 19-month siege by Serbian forces that has killed at least 12,000 people here, many in this city felt that they had reached the limits of their capacity to be shocked by bloodshed.
But this week there was a fresh sense of horror over a bizarre turn of events that grew out of a crackdown by the Bosnian Army and police on gang leaders who had threatened virtually to take over the city in a campaign of black marketeering, robbery, rape and killing.


Bangkok to Singapore, Bumps and All
AS he gathered up my bags in the soggy heat of Bangkok's Hualamphong Railway Station, the aging Thai porter made a couple of quick assumptions about this American traveler who was standing -- and sweating -- before him.
"I think you go Oriental Express, O.K., O.K.?" he said, noticing in my shirt pocket the jade-green ticket jacket printed with an ostentatious logo and the initials E &amp; O, for Eastern &amp; Oriental Express, the new luxury train that has been running between Bangkok and Singapore since Sept. 19 and bills itself as Asia's answer to the fabled Orient Express of Europe.


Tarot Goes 'Po Mo'
JAMES WANLESS, a tarot authority from California, has offered to read your cards.

So, after giving your aura a quick rinse, you head for the Ramada Hotel Pennsylvania in Manhattan.
Mr.
Wanless is staying in Room 515. (Remember that number.)

Streetscapes/The Ansonia; Changes for the Better, but Still a Long Way to Go
"BARBARIANS Rape Ansonia," ran the headline in The Village Voice in 1980, as the residents protested interior alterations on what was one of New York's most prominent and troubled apartment houses.
Considering the magnitude of their task, the "barbarians" have done a passable job of improving the florid Ansonia Hotel on Broadway from 73d to 74th Streets.
The building has slowly improved over the intervening years, though it still has a long way to go before it returns to the confection it was when it opened in 1904.


If You're Thinking of Living in/Monroe Township; Split by Phone and Mail, but Not in Spirit
ACCORDING to the United States Postal Service, no one lives in Monroe Township, N.J.
The Mayor's address is listed in neighboring Spotswood; a Monroe Township retirement community with nearly 3,000 residents has a Cranbury address, and Monroe's championship golf course supposedly is in Jamesburg.
Although it is nearly 44 square miles and has a larger population than nearly all the surrounding communities, Monroe has no postal identity.
Not only that, it is also plagued by a pair of telephone area codes, forcing residents to pay long-distance charges to phone from one side of town to the other.

Devils Back on Winning Track
The question that lingered in the mind of Devils supporters for the past four days was how the team would respond to the loss to Montreal that ended its seven-game winning streak Tuesday night.
Although they squandered a three-goal lead, the Devils answered that question this afternoon with a 5-3 triumph over the Flyers that came with help from the videotape and some good goaltending from Chris Terreri.

She graduated from Northwestern University.
Her father is an executive vice president of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide in New York.


Wanted: Actress to Play Pakistani, Chilean or Indian
Sarita Choudhury is decked out in navy warm-up pants, a tatty blue T-shirt and worn Army boots -- all topped by a leonine mane of unbrushed hair.
She appears worlds away from the traditional, sari-wearing Mina, the character she played in her first film, "Mississippi Masala." But after ordering a cappuccino at a restaurant in Greenwich Village and lighting up the first of several Marlboros, it becomes apparent that Ms.
Choudhury has at least one thing in common with her fictional counterpart.
"Don't write how much I smoke," she says in a throaty baritone.
"My parents will kill me!"

Hold the Wine And Pass the Beer
BEER is big: there are more varieties of beer than ever on store shelves; new breweries are opening; restaurants are beginning to have beer lists, and many restaurants are designing special menus to accompany an assortment of beers.
The beer dinner is replacing the wine dinner.
And it can also happen at home.
At a restaurant beer dinner, an assortment of four or five beers are chosen, like wines, to accompany certain dishes.
Sometimes the dishes themselves are made with beer.


Prague: Lost Era
To the Editor: Even though I browse through the whole Travel section, few articles move me to write.
But Michael Chabon's "Prague: Lost Era" (Sept. 26) touched me in its poetic evocation of awakening from a "40-year dream . . ., a sigh of bereavement."
His article reminded me of my first visits there under Soviet occupation, but even more of 1987 when Prague began to preen in new hope.
Scaffolding hid the famous town clock, while young students and hopeful artists huddled in cheap bistros, house fronts were being repainted, the streets repaved and a few luxury restaurants offered delicious food at prices only tourists could afford.


Florida State Romps But Ward Is Injured
Florida St. 54, Wake Forest 0
Get ready for a few days of ticklish speculation about Charlie Ward's ribs.
Ward, a favorite to capture the Heisman Trophy, was knocked out of top-ranked Florida State's 54-0 homecoming victory yesterday over Wake Forest in Tallahassee, Fla.
He was tackled by several defenders as he attempted to scramble out of trouble at midfield on an aborted pass play.


Ewing Escapes Injury in Post-Game Scare
The Knicks received a major scare tonight when adoring fans forced a barrier to collapse on Patrick Ewing's left leg as the team was filing off the Thunderdome court after its 93-77 exhibition victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.
"Sure I was scared," Ewing said in the New York locker room.
"I saw my leg giving in. Thank God I still had my shoes on. I was able to move my leg out of the way a little bit."

CONNECTICUT GUIDE
ABBA EBAN ON DIPLOMACY
Abba Eban, the former Israeli Ambassador to the United States and delegate to the United Nations, will give the second of his series of four lectures on Monday from 4 to 6 P.M. in the auditorium of the Whitney Humanities Center at 53 Wall Street on the Yale campus in New Haven.
The lectures, which have the umbrella title of "Diplomacy After the Cold War," are free to the public.
"The Illusion of a New International Order" will be the subject on Monday, followed on Feb. 7 by "Analogy in Diplomatic Practice" and on Feb. 14 by "New Visions in Conflict Resolution in the Post-Cold War Age."


David Gergen, Master of THE GAME
On Nov. 9, 1960, the day after John F. Kennedy defeated Richard M. Nixon to become the 35th President of the United States, a reporter for The Washington Daily News and a reporter for The Associated Press dropped by Nixon's house in Washington, looking for a interview with the loser.
The Vice President answered the door himself, and standing on the front stoop, the three men settled into a polite routine of questions and answers.
Suddenly, Pat Nixon appeared.
She was angry and, it was clear, not in control of her emotions.
She damned the reporters and their colleagues for favoritism toward Kennedy that she said cost her husband the election.
Nixon calmed her and led her away.
When he returned, he said nothing about his wife's outburst, and the reporters resumed their inquiry as if nothing unusual had occurred.
Neither reporter ever wrote about Mrs.
Nixon's behavior; it wasn't news.
This small, oddly dignified scene, remembered by one of the reporters, belongs to a world that has vanished utterly.
A journalist interviewing the losing candidate on the day after the 1992 election would have done so as a member of a large pack, covering a set piece of political theater -- a media event, as it is called.
The event would have been scripted down to the level of minor jokes, in an effort to insure that the candidate committed no gaffes before the cameras.
The reporters, hoping to shake things off-script, and aware of their own video presence, would have shouted self-consciously aggressive questions.
Had the defeated candidate's wife interrupted to scold the press, this would have been regarded by his handlers as a calamity (unless they had secretly arranged it) and by the reporters as the news of the day.


Good Eating; Ethnic Pleasures, Elmhurst to Astoria
ELIAS CORNER (Diner's Journal)  (718) 932-1510; 31st Street and 24th Avenue, Astoria; $; no credit cards accepted
This popular, tiny neighborhood spot serves some of the freshest seafood in New York City.
There is a glass fish counter at the entrance and a tiny square kitchen behind it.
The small dining room with a cooler for beer and wine, a plastic shark mounted on the wall, and the pale fluorescent lighting is convivial.
There are no menus.
Regulars walk over to the counter and pick their seafood.


Like Snowflakes, Holidays Issues Differ
OVER the last 11 days, the United States Postal Service has issued its usual collection of Christmas stamps: four secular designs and one Madonna and Child.
But the secular stamps, in particular the one showing a snowman with a carrot nose, come in enough different designs to keep sharp-eyed noncollectors grazing through their mail to identify each one.
The four secular stamps, called Christmas Contemporary, are Snowman, Toy Soldier, Jack-in-the-Box and Reindeer.
The stamps are sold in two formats, the usual perforated lick-'em-stick-'em strips and panes, and the peelable self-adhesives, which come mounted on small cards.


Don't Call The Oilers Insensitive Bosses
"Oh, baby!"
That has probably been the most popular cry over the last week regarding the David Williams situation.
As most sports fans and nonfans alike are aware, David is the Houston Oiler player who did not play in our Oct. 17 game against the New England Patriots in Foxboro, Mass., on the day after the birth of his son.
The incident has generated a lot of controversy, much of which could have minimized if the facts had been accurately reported from the outset.


Dining Facing Grand Central
To the Editor:
Very simply stated, a restaurant facing Grand Central Terminal  [ "Al Fresco Dining Facing Grand Central?," Aug. 22 ]  is the wrong use of this rare zone in a busy commercial and trasportation hub of the city.
Rather, the area cries out for a decent enclosed airport bus terminal and waiting room.
This could be worked into the existing space under consideration, without closing off lanes of traffic on Park Avenue, and without a costly renovation.


F.Y.I.
As a classroom assignment, seniors at Saint Agnes Boys High School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan sent in their questions about New York City.
Here are several.
Why Police Wear Blue
Q.
What is the history behind the color blue for uniforms for the New York City Police Department?
Why was it chosen?
A.
The department's official colors are blue, white and green.
Blue was chosen as the uniform color largely for practical purposes, said Officer Dominick Palermo, assistant curator of the Police Museum at the Police Academy in Manhattan.
"Sometimes you have to change a flat tire," he explained.
"It is much easier to get grease off of blue than white. Also, the color blue has meanings, such as courage and strength."
The uniform, modeled after that of the British police, was adopted in 1853.
New York officers resisted it at first, opting instead for street clothes and an eight-point star that identified them as police officers, because they thought the uniforms looked too British (not such a popular group in New York at that time).
On the Beam
Q.
What is the purpose of the big point at the top of the Empire State Building?
A.
The top part of the "point" is an antenna used by 13 major FM radio stations as well as Channel 41, a Spanish-language television station.
The tippy-top of this antenna transmits the Home Shopping Network's signal.
Map Help
Q.
Why is it that even though 12th Avenue and the Henry Hudson Parkway connect, they still remain separate streets on maps of the city?
A.
Lisa Daglian, spokeswoman for the City Department of Transportation, says the Henry Hudson Parkway is also known by three other names south of 57th Street: West Street, West Side Highway and 12th Avenue.
The map you have may be trying to let you know that and telling you to look for signs accordingly.
A Lot of Tokens
Q.
How much does it cost to run the New York City subway system?
A.
Some $2 billion a year, with half from fares and half from government subsidies, which the Transit Authority began receiving in 1964.
Cabby Specifications
Q.
What type of training do New York cabdrivers need and what type of license are they required to have?
A.
All New York City taxi drivers -- there are now 40,000 -- must be at least 19 years old and "proficient" in English, hold a valid driver's license from any state, have a good driving record and be felony free.
They must get a license from the Taxi and Limousine Commission ($62) and go to taxi school for 20, 40 or 80 hours, depending on their language skills and knowledge of city geography.
No More Duck Intrigue
Q.
I am reading "The Catcher in the Rye," which poses the intriguing question that no one really answers -- where do the ducks in Central Park go during the winter, or does someone take care of them there?
A.
About 15 types of waterfowl pass through Central Park during the year.
Most migrate south, but many Canada geese and mallards stay all year, fending for themselves or relying on the kindness of strangers.
Ebbets Neighborhood
Q.
What section of Brooklyn was Ebbets Field located in?
A.
Ebbets Field was built in 1913 in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, so desolate at the time that the area was also known as Pigtown, Goatville, Tin Can Alley and Crow Hill.
Ebbets Field's first game, an exhibition match between the Dodgers and the Yankees, was that same year.
Man on a Horse
Q.
On 59th Street by Central Park is a statue of a golden man on a horse.
Who is he and what is he pointing at?
A.
The statue is of Gen.
William Tecumseh Sherman with Victory, dedicated on May 30, 1903.
In fact, he isn't pointing, Victory is.
But the way it was designed by the sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, their motions are meant to look as one, according to "Manhattan's Outdoor Sculpture" by Gayle Cohen (Prentice Hall, 1988).
The statue had lost its golden sheen over the years, but around 1990 the Victorian Society in America spiffed it up.
As for whom or what Victory is pointing at, Abbey Lavine, a reference assistant at the New-York Historical Society, said, "Well, at whatever Victory would be pointing at." JENNIFER STEINHAUER


Hitler's Handmaiden
To the Editor:
John Simon, in his review of "Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir" (Sept. 26), wonders how one assesses the veracity of any memoir.
First, deal at arm's length with a memoir that quotes verbatim the words of Hitler, Goebbels, Ferruccio Busoni, you name it, all at a distance of at least 50 years.
Then let some common-sense tests be made as to the accuracy of names and dates.
Mr.
Simon mentions Miss Riefenstahl's claim that Busoni composed a piece for her.
But Helmut Wirth makes no mention of this piece in his list of Busoni's compositions.
Leni Riefenstahl was but 5 or 6 when Busoni was giving concerts she claims to have attended.
Where is the piece, and where is the evidence of his friendship?


Medellin Wins Battles in Campaign for Peace
After a decade of violence and drug-related terrorism, Medellin is trying to find peace.

Ambulance Service: A User's Guide
YOU are sailing around the loop in Central Park on your new Rollerblades when suddenly your skate catches in a pothole -- or was it some horse droppings -- and you are catapulted through the air. @$#%&amp;¦$ X¦&amp;!
The world goes black.
The next thing you know, you open your eyes to find yourself flat on your back, with two people in green uniforms sliding you into a dark, gadget-filled van.
You try to sit up but discover that an array of thick orange belts have you pinned to a wooden board.
You open your mouth to yell but find that your neck is bound in some stiff plastic contraption that is cradling your chin and a clear plastic mask covers your mouth.


Senators Battle Over Foreign Broadcast Cuts
A plan to consolidate United States international broadcasting operations, touted by the Clinton Administration as a step toward streamlining the Government, seems to be coming apart.
The main element of the package presented last June by President Clinton envisioned combining the Voice of America with Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, the stations based in Munich that broadcast to the Soviet Union and its European satellites starting in the early 1950's.


Kyle A. Belford, Matthew Platnico
Kyle Alexandra Belford, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Lloyd E. Belford of Fall River, Mass., was married last evening to Matthew Eric Platnico, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Her mother, Justice Aileen H. Belford, is an associate justice of the New Bedford (Mass.) District Court.


Making It Work; On the Garbage Team
IT was an ungodly 2:48 on a Wednesday morning when a yellow-and-black-striped heap of a subway train puffed and jerked into the station at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue.
On the platform, a woman who seemed to have had a long evening, judging by her scowl and the wig that sat askew atop her head, began to yell.
"Move this thing faster," she ordered, clearly grasping the fact that her train would not arrive until this thing was gone.
"Get this out of here!"

Gunman Was a Murder Convict
A Queens man who shot and wounded three police officers last Wednesday before being shot to death had served 15 years in prison after killing his wife and two children, the police said.
The criminal record of Raul Figueroa, who was 63 years old, was discovered by matching his fingerprints with those recorded under a system abandoned in the 1970's, said Sgt.
Anthony Barlanti, a police spokesman.


Upstart Airline Staying on Course
IT is half past noon on a busy Monday at Newark International Airport.
From his office across the road from the runway, Robert Iverson surveys the jets lining up for takeoff and consults his watch.
It is almost departure time for Flight 9 to Orlando, Fla., on Kiwi International Airlines, the upstart airline he founded.
What Mr.
Iverson, Kiwi's chairman, sees from his window, though, is a sobering view of his competition.
In the last year, he has witnessed other newcomers open for business across the way, only to close down shortly thereafter.
And the dozens of Continental Airlines jets parked on the tarmac at Newark are more evidence of the odds against Kiwi.

Neighborhood Report: Central Park; A Rebirth For Upper Park
It was like an outing at a romantic 19th-century English lakeside home: on a recent weekend afternoon, visitors sunned themselves on the terrace while taking in a concert by the Harbor Jazz Ensemble.
Others sat on newly installed benches overlooking the lake.
Nearby, toddlers clambered around the swings and slides in the playground, opened last year.
Long neglected, the northern end of Central Park is enjoying something of a renaissance since the opening this month of the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center, gateway to the Harlem Meer and the wild North Woods.

Penn Wins Big at Yale To Set Up Title Game
Penn trounced Yale today, 48-7, in the cold and rain at the Yale Bowl for the undefeated Quakers' seventh straight victory this season.
It was the most decisive Yale loss to an Ivy opponent since the league began competition 37 years ago.
Coupled with Princeton's victory over Columbia, Penn's defeat of Yale set the stage for a clash of the undefeated Tigers and Quakers next Saturday at Franklin Field in Philadelphia with the Ivy League championship the likely prize.

Corrections
A chart on Oct. 17, with the What's Doing column about Toronto, misstated average temperatures for October.
The average high is 56 degrees, the average low is 40 and rainfall averages 11 days; the figures given were for September.


Agencies Respond to Call for Social Services on East End
TWO years ago the United Way on Long Island, which operates a telephone referral service to more than 150 social-service agencies, added a number with an East End exchange.
The number, 727-0889, rings at the Deer Park office of the charity group, with callers paying just for local calls.
The new number illustrates a growing demand on the East End for health and social services.
In two years service offices have markedly increased, particularly by agencies delivering services that had been unavailable or difficult to obtain.

On Pushing (Not Cranking) the Mower
MANY gardening trends have been displacing the traditional ways, but plant tenders have probably been so busy they haven't noticed.
Now that the season is slowing down to a saner pace, there is time for reflection.
The suburbs are becoming quieter.
There is less of that deafening noise from the power mowers and more of that gentle hum from the old-fashioned push 'em yourself reel mowers.
The older models are coming back!


UNWINDING THE CALIFORNIA WAY
MAKING a reservation for a weekend at Two Bunch Palms provided the first clue about the desert spa, so popular with the Hollywood crowd.
"Is there a dress code in the evening?" I asked.


Bafflement at Yonkers Official's Death
Whether they sided with him or not, what struck most people about Nicholas C. Wasicsko was a pit bull's tenacity in the face of ferocious opposition, particularly the hostility he faced as a young Mayor from much of this rough-and-tumble city over his decision to comply with a housing desegregation order.
"He was a Mayor in the eye of a national hurricane," said Neil J. DeLuca, a former city manager who is now deputy county executive of Westchester County.


Neighborhood Reports: Upper West Side; Yes, Broadway Malls Can Blossom Too
The unhappy state of Broadway's median strips may be most obvious to the people living above them.
"When you walk by the malls, you see one piece of garbage," said Eugene Hide, the president of the Broadway Mall Association.
"When you live on the 10th floor and look down, you see a hundred pieces."
But this year, merchants, co-op boards and condominium owners on Broadway and West End Avenue contributed to clean up the malls in a pilot area from 86th to 96th Streets.


To Some It's Only Firewood, but to an Artist It Is Sculpture
IT was a raw autumn afternoon at the city-owned Wildcliff Center for the Arts here, but the artist Alexander Rutsch exuded energy and warmth.
This was his 12th day of feverish work in the front yard of the 138-year-old house on Long Island Sound, where a humble pile of firewood had kindled mythological visions.
"I walk in and I see wood, wood, wood!" said the Austrian-born Mr.
Rutsch, explaining how his impromptu sculpture garden had emerged from logs and branches after his visit to a recent exhibition of his paintings here.


Corrections
A headline on the Wall Street page last Sunday about a class action suit against Prudential Securities misstated the company's potential liability.
The total of the Prudential Utility Fund's assets is $5.3 billion; there was no estimate of liability in the lawsuit, which contends that some investors were charged excessive fees.


Oct. 24-30: Cowboy Politics; A Senate Showdown Over Grazing Fees
Edward Abbey once called cattle ranching on public land "the most sacred form of welfare in the United States." His contention seemed to be borne out last week by Western Senators in a last stand against a plan to raise grazing fees on Federal land to a level still barely one-third of the rate charged by private landowners.
About 28,000 people and corporations hold permits to graze livestock in the West.
With enough reliable allies in the Senate, they have been able to block fee-raising attempts by at least three administrations over the last decade.

Look Who's Saving Elm
Without question, the dinkiest plant in my garden these last few seasons has been the American elm tree my father-in-law gave me three years ago.
I realize that "dinky" is not a word often attached to elm trees -- "graceful" or "venerable" or even, in recent years, "dead" are a lot more like it.
But there is no getting around the fact that the leafless, 14-inch chopstick that arrived in the mail from the Elm Research Institute in Harrisville, N.H., was a poor excuse for a tree.
Swaddled in a sheet of The Manchester Union Leader, it had not even a single branch -- just a couple of bud-eyes at one end and a straggle of root hairs at the other.
I had formed a somewhat grander picture of my tree when Roy had first called to tell me it was on the way.
He'd read a magazine article about the institute's American Liberty elm, a new strain bred for resistance to Dutch elm disease, the fungus that has brought down so many of America's elms over the past 60 years, and he thought I might like one.
In the days before its arrival, I deliberated where in my yard an elm tree should go, and imagined its trunk climbing swiftly beside my driveway and then, as is the habit of American elms, opening all at once its tall, leafy canopy.


Innovative Designs That Reflect Nature
MINUSCULE versions of dinosaurs and endangered animals are set in silver alongside the highly polished stones of Jan Palombo's pendants and pins.
In a crafts display at the Bergen Museum of Art and Science, they become a metaphor for the museum itself, which contains a huge cage of twittering birds next to the gallery and mastodon bones, discovered years ago on the original site of the museum, piled up behind glass nearby.
The director of the Paramus museum, David James Messer, says an important part of his mission is to show the relationship of art to science.
"Crafts are close to the earth and to nature," he said.


Pop's Patriarch Makes Music Along With His Heirs
The most remarkable moment in "Frank Sinatra Duets," the new album that returns the 77-year-old singer to the mainstream of popular music with a startling force and authority, is a rendition of "I've Got You Under My Skin" in which the Chairman of the Board is joined by Bono of U2.
After Mr.
Sinatra punches out the opening phrases of Cole Porter's standard, Bono slips into the song, crooning the words, "so deep in my heart, you're really a part of me," in a soft, sexy growl.
From here, the two singers, who sound as though they are sitting elbow to elbow in a bar comparing notes about love and life, trade the song back and forth, with the 33-year-old Irish rock star occasionally drawing back to interpolate high, plaintive vocal doodles around his companion's gruff assertions.


Man, 52, Found Dead
A 52-year-old Queens man who was discovered dead in his apartment yesterday, apparently of a drug overdose, had constructed as many as 10 rudimentary bombs by placing gunpowder in jars and attaching paper fuses, the police said.
A bomb squad unit responded to 63-61 99th Street in Forest Hills, Queens, after the man, whose name was not released, was discovered by police officers from the 112th Precinct.
The police were called by a woman who lived nearby and had noticed a foul odor.
The police found three revolvers, a rifle and a shotgun in the apartment, said Officer Merri Pearsall, a police spokeswoman.
She said the revolvers and the rifle appeared to be antiques that might require black powder to fire.


Neighborhood Report: Washington Heights; Editor's Apologies Quell Fury Over Article
An article about Hispanic culture, children and sex abuse that appeared in the first issue of a new neighborhood newspaper in Washington Heights hit a raw nerve with so many readers that the editor dedicated much of the second issue to apologizing for the furor.
The article, by Antonio Mendez, titled "Hispanic Culture Translated: More Than Just Language," appeared in Manhattan Heights Forum, a monthly newspaper started last month by Joyce M. Perry, a writer and teacher who lives in Washington Heights.
Ms.
Perry said she started the paper to give the community a sounding board for serious issues, including one that is close to her own heart: the plight of children in the city.


An Emergency Unit With Children in Mind
MARQUIS JONES'S mouth drooped as he lay on an examining table in the emergency room of the children's unit of Yale-New Haven Hospital.
"Show me where it hurts," the doctor said to the 7-year-old as her hands gently probed his belly.


Alene Hokenstad, Bruce L. Kluger
Alene Anne Hokenstad, the deputy assistant director for health and human services in the office of Mayor David N. Dinkins in New York, was married yesterday in Cleveland to Bruce Lawrence Kluger, a senior associate editor at Playboy magazine in New York.
The Rev.
David O'Malley, a United Church of Christ minister, performed the ceremony at the Amasa Stone Chapel on the campus of Case Western Reserve University.
Ms.
Hokenstad, 29, is keeping her name.
She is a daughter of Dorothy and Dr.
Merl Hokenstad of Shaker Heights, Ohio.
The bride graduated from Kalamazoo College and received a master's degree in social administration from Case Western Reserve.


Hitler's Handmaiden
To the Editor:
Perhaps an interview I had with Leni Riefenstahl shortly after the war may shed some light on her views.


Mahalo Air Joins Hawaiian Carriers
This month Mahalo Air became the third carrier to fly among the Hawaiian islands of Oahu, Kauai and Maui, joining Aloha and Hawaiian Airlines.
Mahalo's schedule includes seven daily round trips from Oahu to Lihue, Kauai, and four daily round trips from Oahu to Kahului, Maui.
Mahalo, which means "thank you" in Hawaiian, plans to start flying to Kona on the Big Island, but no date has been set.
Mahalo's $10 fares set off a fare war among the interisland carriers.
Next month, Mahalo said, it will raise its fares to $42 one way.


What's Good For the French . . .
To the Editor:
To this viewer, who found "Farewell My Concubine" absolutely fascinating, the most startling revelation of Patrick E. Tyler's article "Who Makes the Rules in Chinese Movies?"  [ Oct. 17 ]  is that what we see in the United States is also a censored version.


Corrections
An article on Oct. 10 about bagel shops around New York misstated the address of Atlantic Bagels in Brooklyn.
It is at 177 Atlantic Avenue, at Clinton Street.


Dull Campaign Turns Favorite Into an Underdog
There was a time, back in May, when Mary Sue Terry had what seemed an insurmountable 30-point lead over George F. Allen in the Virginia governor's race.
But going into the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's election, the insurmountable had been surmounted and the polls showed Ms.
Terry, a moderate Democrat, trailing Mr.
Allen, a conservative Republican, by 7 to 19 points.


One Dive Into a Pool Marks a Major Passage in Many Lives
The tears were nothing like the ones that flowed through that emotionally searing weekend and returned from time to time in the year and nine months to follow.
These were more like a wedding's tears, detectable by their absence of anger or fear.
They are reserved for moments such as the one late Friday morning when Haley Scott completed her long, improbable climb up to a starting block while the swimmers from Notre Dame and its opponents stood and cheered.
The public-address announcer at the Rolfs Aquatic Center asked the crowd to refrain from taking flash pictures at the start of heat 2 of the women's 50-yard freestyle.
The preservation of these images would not require flashes, or film, or cameras.


Neighborhood Report: Central Park; Park Program Puts Homeless to Work
Bearing the tools of his trade -- a metal reacher and plastic bags -- Bill Durham set out at 7:30 A.M. the other day on his usual route, along the western rim of Central Park from 85th to 100th Streets.
He knew what he would find: newspapers, Popsicle sticks and drinking straws all over; cigarette butts around the bus stops, and lots of crack vials.
By 9:30 he had picked up and bagged every scrap in his sector.
After half an hour for breakfast at the Yorkville Common Pantry, a nonprofit agency, he was back in the park, ready to rake leaves.


Early Release of the Budget Draws Fire
FOR years, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke has resisted entreaties from some Democrats on the Board of Legislators to release the new county budget before the November election rather than after.
They argued that it was right for the people to know what they faced before casting their ballots rather than being surprised later.
Mr.
O'Rourke disagreed, saying that a pre-election release would politicize the budget.

Neighborhood Reports: Flushing; After Layoffs, Bakery Workers Nurture a Plan To Rise Again
Some have taken jobs as waiters, parking attendants and movers; others have simply moved out of town.
But many of the 400 workers who lost their jobs when Stroehmann closed its Taystee Bread bakery in Flushing are still struggling to open a bakery of their own.
Their plan was born when the plant closed in July 1992, and in recent months, the workers have raised about $80,000, bringing their total to nearly $200,000, hired a project manager, and secured pledges from hundreds of people to buy their product once the business gets off the ground.
And they are busily hunting for sites.


Attack on U.S. Lugers Has Racial Overtones
Duncan Kennedy, a two-time Olympic luger from Lake Placid, N.Y., was beaten by skinheads Friday night while trying to protect a black teammate, Robert Pipkins, from what appeared to be a racial attack in eastern Germany.
Kennedy, 25 years old, was kicked and punched in the head, face and body, and may have suffered a broken nose, he said last night by telephone from Igls, Austria, where the United States team drove after leaving Germany.


The View From: Waterford; A Stalled Repair Plan Takes Its Toll at Harkness Park
THE golden autumn sun shone on the broad lawns, Italianate mansion and historic gardens of Harkness Memorial State Park in Waterford.
Just beyond the grounds, Long Island Sound sparkled.
But Diana McMasters took little note of sun and sparkle.
She eyed the mansion's cracked masonry and rotting sills.
She pushed aside dense overgrowth in one garden and pointed out a boarded-over pond in another.
"This is something that the state is supposed to take care of," said Mrs.
McMasters, a teacher from Waterford who heads a group of park supporters.
"This is a treasure that belongs to the people of Connecticut."


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: New Jersey; X Marks the Spot the Candidates Will Watch on Election Day
There is a political map of New Jersey that some politicians carry around in their minds.
It shows the state's political landscape as an enormous, misshapen X.
In this map, the line that starts at top right and drops to the bottom left is the New Jersey Turnpike, connecting the state's big cities -- Newark, Elizabeth, Trenton, Camden -- as it runs through the Democratic Party's old urban power base.


Health Plan: Out of the Gate
The Clinton health care plan, at a hefty 1,342 pages and 5 1/2 pounds, thumped into congressional in-baskets on Wednesday.
This version differed from the one leaked last month, with revisions designed to increase the odds of the bill's passage.
Among them: abortion coverage with a "conscience clause" that would exuse people with objections from having to perform the procedure; subsidies for small businesses with with as many as 75 workers, up from 50; the right to choose a doctor, even one outside the patient's plan.


Nuclear Era Is Departing By Same Door It Entered
Nuclear disarmament begins at a conference table in Moscow, Geneva or Washington.
But it is carried out in places like a circular concrete cell buried in the dusty soil of the Texas Panhandle, where spheres of high explosives are pried from their cores of plutonium, rendering a bomb of almost unimaginable power into a collection of merely hazardous ingredients.
Dismantling nuclear warheads may be infinitely better than detonating them, but the job is tricky.
In addition to being radioactive, plutonium is highly toxic and can burn on contact with air, and most of the explosives are old and prone to detonate with heat or shock.


New York Standard Time; Here Today, Gone Unaccountably
This is the weekend for turning clocks back one hour, a reversal that gets farmers and cows back in sync but is no big deal in New York, where time enjoys a weird life of its own regardless.
While some things here go on forever - the Mets season, to take a ridiculously easy case - a more disturbing trick of New York Time is that it can make things vanish or materialize between midnight and 8 A.M.
Many chicken take-out places have become tanning salons in just this way.


SURFACING


Amid Strife, Haiti Parliament Struggles With Itself
Senator Julio Larosiliere the most senior member of the Haitian legislature, says the return of democratic rule in the country rests in the hands of its exiled President's allies in Parliament.
Like many others in the parliamentary bloc that for two years has resisted attempts to restore the elected President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Mr.
Larosiliere said Father Aristide's legislative supporters lacked the courage of their convictions.


Traces of Goodness


AN EARLY SPRING
There are always those who love to accuse Seventh Avenue's talents of playing catch-up.
That's because New York is the last of the major fashion capitals to introduce new styles for the next season.
And invariably, many of the same trends that already surfaced in Paris and Milan show up here.
But the truth in that New York's designers have been plugging away for months.
This week the spring '94 shows begin.
And here's a preview of some of what will be seen.
BY CARRIE DONOVAN


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: The Ad Campaign; Dinkin's Ghostly Image of Giuliani
ON THE SCREEN
The 30-second commercial opens with a faded and grainy black-and-white photograph of Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Electronic music in a menacingly minor key plays in the background.
As a narrator attacks Giuliani proposals, photographs of headlines or blocks of text from newspaper articles flash across the screen: a New York Post headline, "Rudy's RX: Sell Off City Hosps" and two quotations from an editorial in The New York Times, "90 days and out," and "A civic Reaganism." When the narrator says Mr.
Giuliani's plan to cut the city work force would reduce services to the elderly, the camera pans across the faces of three gray-haired people.

Longer Store Hours? Germans Are Aghast
With more than three million Germans out of work and the economy dragging along in the worst recession in 40 years, a proposal to allow stores to stay open longer has renewed a debate that has been going on for at least 20 years.
Instead of welcoming the plan, the labor union that represents 420,000 of the country's 2.8 million retail trade employees vowed to fight it because its workers would not accept longer working hours.
The proposal, made by the Christian Democratic Party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, would change regulations that require nearly all stores to close promptly at 6:30 P.M. most weekdays, 2 P.M. most Saturdays and all day on Sundays.


The Streets Become a Classroom; A School Weaves Ideas From Outward Bound Into Lessons
In a vacant classroom in Chelsea, after the rumble of schoolchildren had faded, five teachers collapsed into chairs and pondered aloud after another grueling day the big question that they all faced: how do you invent a place called school?
Six weeks into the academic year, the experimental School for the Physical City is open for 131 students in borrowed space, a fledging effort to transform the way that children are taught by using the expeditionary learning principles of Outward Bound.
At least once a week the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, Ellis Island -- the city itself -- becomes the classroom.
Subjects like mathematics, science and history are brought to life and woven into academic lessons.


A Stroll Up the Ramp With Roy Lichtenstein
Painters are legendarily fuzzy when talking about their work.
Not Roy Lichtenstein.
So Diane Waldman, curator of the Lichtenstein retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum and a longtime Lichtenstein friend and admirer, persuaded him to help her conduct the Acoustiguide tape-recorded tour of the exhibition.

Neighborhood Report: Bay Ridge; Massacre, Part 2: Replanting
They called it the Bay Ridge Chain-Saw Massacre: the destruction of 400 cherrywood, apple and pear trees six weeks ago in a beautification plan gone haywire.
Now, the Transit Authority is about to begin planting 35 new trees in what residents call a first step toward recovery.
The project, which was presented to Community Board 10 and about 15 residents on Tuesday, calls for the plantings, which will cost $15,000, to begin early next month, before the first frost, said Mary Sempepos, the board's district manager.


When Collectors and Friends Help Mount a Major Exhibition
FLORENCE had the Medicis.
Paris had Gertrude Stein, and Baltimore had the Cone Sisters as collectors and patrons of the arts.
Now a group of collectors in Nassau County has gone beyond the usual role of patrons.
In a rare collaboration between amateurs and professionals, some North Shore residents have taken a hands-on approach to the arts.
The collectors, working with the director of the Nassau County Museum of Art, Constance Schwartz, have mounted a museum exhibition including "top-notch names and top-notch art," Ms.
Schwartz said.


A Surprise Winner Of a Brilliancy Prize
THE pretourney favorites, Elena Donaldson of Mercer Island, Wash., and Irina Levitina of Teaneck, N.J., shared first prize in the 34th United States Women's Championship in August at the McLean County Arts Center in Bloomington, Ill.
The two former Soviet team members scored 7-2 in the round-robin invitational competition and each was awarded a $1,500 prize.
But the winner of the $100 brilliancy prize, 17-year-old Anna Khan, was a surprise, since seven players were ranked ahead of her at the start.
Khan, who emigrated from Latvia to Brooklyn two years ago, also won $450 for her third-place tie.


Lyme Disease And Lesson of AIDS
Re: "Controversy Flares Over Lyme Disease," Oct. 3:
The first case of what is now known as AIDS was reported in 1981.
Since that time, the AIDS surveillance case definition has been changed several times, and expanded to include more recently recognized entities.
Again, in late 1992 it was revised to delineate stages affecting management.
The end result of this process is a broader case definition, making treatment accessible to many more.


Choosing Sides In the Way We Shop
IN Westchester, where crowds of savvy consumers have increasingly been drawn to a growing lineup of sleek regional discount stores along the highways, some shoppers still hew to the old ways, saying they prefer the quiet, albeit dowdier, aisles of their local Woolworth store.
"Coming here is a lot like coming home," said Adele Piacquadio, a 72-year-old resident of the Bronx who was buying a lampshade at the Woolworth store in Eastchester recently.
"Maybe it's force of habit, but I grew up with Woolworth, and I like growing old with it."


Voters Guide; At Issue on the Ballot: How the City Works
NEW YORK would still be the nation's largest city and no one elected on Tuesday would automatically lose his job until 2002, but two ballot proposals could change the profile of New York City and the face of its government.
Both proposals would fundamentally challenge the status quo and reflect voter frustration with what many people perceive as ossified incumbents and with unresponsive bureaucrats.
But whether the proposals would improve or merely change the way the city works is debatable.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Film Stars and Memories
YOU knew you were near the Hamptons Film Festival on noticing the license plate of the chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz.
It was RKO 1.
Where was RKO 1 heading?
To the Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorcese symposium on film preservation?
To Darryl Hannah and her directorial debut?
No.
RKO 1 turned into Doug's Vegetable Patch.
It may have been spinach and not Spielberg that brought one communications executive to the Hamptons last weekend.


Californians Relieved as Winds and Fire Subside
Hot winds that fed deadly wildfires around Southern California died overnight as unexpectedly as they had appeared, and a hunt intensified today for the arsonists who the authorities believe set at last 6 of 13 major blazes.
After four days of fire that consumed 152,000 acres and 720 structures, firefighters raced to contain the remaining blazes before the predicted return of the Santa Ana winds on Monday or Tuesday.
Arson investigators took advantage of the lull to sift through the ashes for clues and issued calls to the public to report any suspicious activities.


35 Years With Woodrow Wilson: The Journey of a Long-Distance Editor
ON March 4, 1913, Woodrow Wilson was sworn in as President of the United States.
Eighty years later to the month, Princeton University Press published the final narrative installment of "The Papers of Woodrow Wilson," a 69-volume documentary record of Wilson's life and work.
None of these elegant-looking books (each one of which costs $65) has ever appeared on a best-seller list; none is likely to turn up on the shelves of your neighborhood bookstore any time soon.
Yet some 95,000 individual volumes have been sold since 1966, when the first one appeared.
Virtually every American library owns a set, as do hundreds of other libraries around the world (there are at least two sets in Moscow.) Initially subsidized by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, "The Papers of Woodrow Wilson" long ago began to turn a handsome profit for Princeton.
In fact, the publication of the Wilson papers is probably the biggest success story to date in the little-known branch of historical research known as documentary editing.
The publication of large-scale documentary editions like "The Papers of Woodrow Wilson," which make essential primary manuscript sources readily accessible to historians everywhere, is one of the most important jobs done by America's university presses, and one of the most unglamorous.
Documentary editing projects, like dissertations, have a way of dragging on forever; many actually outlive their original editors.


Neighborhood Report; A New Bike Path: Recreation With a River View
The Hudson River waterfront beckons the people of TriBeCa, SoHo and Greenwich Village.
But in those areas, getting there to appreciate the view poses an obstacle course that requires dodging vehicles, weaving though parking lots and tiptoeing across crumbling piers.
All that is changing under a $1.6 million project to clear a 27-foot-wide waterfront path for strollers, joggers, bikers and bench potatoes.
The path, to be completed by April 17, will run nearly two miles along the river, parallel to West Street, from Gansevoort Street south to Chambers Street.

THE NATION: Small Cities Lead an Economic Charge; The South Renews Its Sense of Self
"IN the feeling of the South," W. J. Cash wrote a half century ago in his quirky classic "The Mind of the South," "Progress stood quite accurately for a sort of new charge at Gettysburg."
After decades of tectonic shifts in the balance of regional power in this country, the South's view of growth still seems to echo the notion that economic progress would give the Civil War's losers the last word.
Now it is worth asking whether a modern version of Pickett's charge at Gettysburg, which doomed the Confederacy, is succeeding at last.


Hold the Wine And Pass the Beer
BEER is big: there are more varieties of beer than ever on store shelves; new breweries are opening; restaurants are beginning to have beer lists, and many restaurants are designing special menus to accompany an assortment of beers.
The beer dinner is replacing the wine dinner.
And it can also happen at home.
At a restaurant beer dinner, an assortment of four or five beers are chosen, like wines, to accompany certain dishes.
Sometimes the dishes themselves are made with beer.


Trying to Salvage an Education for 'Hopeless Cause' Students
THE seventh graders in a classroom at Alberta B. Gray Schultz Middle School in Hempstead were eating lunch while working on other activities.
Several students were doing their homework with a teacher.
Another teacher was tutoring a small group of students for a test that afternoon.
In the classroom next door about a dozen 12-year-olds were learning from a third teacher about nouns and adjectives.
The youngsters in the classrooms are among the 48 seventh graders in Comet, a new program for students who educators consider most at risk to fail in school.


Oct. 24-30; Neck and Neck Till Tuesday
In the usual flurry of handshakes and handwringing, the New York City mayoral race slouched toward Election Day Tuesday, with Mayor David N. Dinkins beseeching his constituents not to let the bumps of four years in office deprive him of four more, and Rudolph W. Giuliani asking to be the first Republican to run City Hall in a generation.
New York politics is a rough sport, but this rematch of two 1989 rivals has seemed especially sour, with rancorous exchanges over racism, fascism and even the parentage of one candidate's running mate and another's supporter.
If he loses, Mr.
Dinkins will become the first black mayor of a major American city defeated in his first re-election bid.
A Giuliani defeat would leave the former Federal prosecutor's once-bright prospects much dimmed.


Judicial Choices: The Best of a Crowd
They are called judicial "elections." But the resemblance to real democracy stops there.
Of the 30 races for Supreme and Civil Court seats at stake Tuesday in New York City, only a handful are seriously contested.
Most of the meaningful choices were made months ago by political party leaders who control the complex convention and petition processes that put candidates on the ballot and strike deals for cross-party endorsements.
This system produces some distinguished judges.
But it also elevates mediocre candidates, including some of this week's likely winners.
Here are our choices in a few close contests.


Where Death Is a Dirt-Nap
SIX OUT SEVEN By Jess Mowry. 501 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $22.


Spain's Other Continent
Archangels in the Andes in the 18th century wore knee breeches, silk stockings, doublets, brocaded coats, plumed hats, and acres of lace and ribbons; in some cases they sported snappy military rifles.
Of course, on certain religious feast days one can still find Peruvian Indians in the mountains in just such angel costumes (without the rifles), but their predecessors have been preserved in magnificent paintings, reproduced -- along with an astonishing array of art produced in oil, metals, wood and textiles for 300 years -- in CAMBIOS: The Spirit of Transformation in Spanish Colonial Art (Santa Barbara Museum of Art/University of New Mexico; cloth, $50; paper, $25).
Two curators of a show organized by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Gabrielle Palmer and Donna Pierce, give overviews of art in the Viceroyalty of Peru (all of South America except Brazil) and the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Central America, Mexico and parts of the United States).
But it is the descriptions of individual works that, taken together, fill one with wonder at the lavishness, vitality and great endurance of the artistic genius that flowed through the old Spanish empire, making the gold and gems Europe fought over seem tawdry in comparison.
Mexican painters like Juan Correa and Miguel Cabrera certainly knew contemporary European standards, but their work blazes with light, passion and wisdom that express their own visions of the great civilization rising around them.
And the anonymous casters and carvers of silver Peruvian incense burners in the forms of turkeys, peacocks and armadillos knew all that Cellini knew, and more.
This book is not a heavy history, but a sweet breeze of inspiration that fills one with humility and delight, and perhaps some somber reflection on the blind arrogance of people who refer to these lands now as "third world." D. J. R. BRUCKNER


'Spheres of Influence' Show Reunites Teachers and Students
IN the history of American Modernism, there are many roads leading back to the Manhattan Academy run by Robert Henri.
Stuart Davis, who studied there from 1910 to 1913 and who briefly reflected its influence before forging his own distinct style, praised the school for taking art "off the academic pedestal" and for developing "the student's confidence in his own perceptions." The painter also recalled it as a place for making friends, subject to a rite that involved the initiate buying "a large quantity of beer."
On the other hand, John Sloan regarded his mentor as "a dominant personality deservedly commanding respect and somewhat impatient of ideas that 'crossed' his own and 'never,' he said, 'felt really close to him.' " Yet, the Ashcan School painter retained much of Henri's influence; similarly, George Bellows, who said that his life "began" at the school, continued to pursue the robust form of Realism practiced and nurtured by Henri.
Then there was Man Ray, who studied with the master in Philadelphia and admired him for being "against what most people were for and for what most people were against," and in his own way followed suit.


Terror Pulls Its Chair Up to the Peace Table
YASIR ARAFAT, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was quoted in the Palestinian press last week as saying that someone had tried to kill Faisal al-Husseini, the leading political figure among East Jerusalem's Arabs.
Details of where, when and how were scarce, and people around Mr.
Husseini were not very interested in discussing the matter.
But there was no reason to disbelieve Mr.
Arafat, for Mr.
Husseini is a plausible assassination target.
In the last few weeks, three allies of the P.L.O. chairman, all from his mainstream Fatah faction, have been killed by mysterious gunmen in the Gaza Strip, leaving surviving confederates to look nervously over their shoulders and to wonder if they are on someone's list of endangered species.
"Bats of darkness," Mr.
Arafat called the killers, and he talked of "a big conspiracy," dropping vague hints that Israelis were behind it.


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: The Mayor's Race; NEW YORK CONTEST GOES DOWN TO WIRE IN HECTIC WEEKEND
In rainswept rallies and live radio interviews, the New York City mayoral candidates swung into the homestretch yesterday, with Mayor David N. Dinkins using the powers of incumbency to showcase city programs, and Rudolph W. Giuliani releasing a new television advertisement rebutting the Mayor's latest attacks by demanding, "How about something positive for a change?"
As if in answer, Mr.
Dinkins pulled a brace of 11th-hour rabbits out of his hat.
First, he announced that the city would extend health benefits to the domestic partners of its unmarried employees, including homosexuals -- an issue of great concern to gay voters whose support he wants and something he had pledged in the past.

POSTINGS: With a Show of Photos from New Book; Landmarks Group Plans Forum On Preservation Pros and Cons
On April 19, 1965, Mayor Robert F. Wagner signed into law a bill creating the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.
Pressure to form such a panel had been growing because many of the city's magnificent old buildings -- in particular the noble Roman-style Pennsylvania Station of Charles F. McKim -- had fallen victim to the wreckers' ball, making way for the modern era's often inelegant constructions of glass and steel.
In October of that year, the commission designated its first landmark, the former Astor Library on Lafayette Street.


Egypt Military Court Orders 8 Muslim Militants to Hang
An Egyptian military court today sentenced eight Muslim militants -- two of them fugitives -- to hang for reviving the outlawed group that assassinated President Anwar el-Sadat and for plotting to overthrow the Government.
The sentences raised the number of militants condemned to hang to 38 since President Hosni Mubarak began transferring cases of Islamic militants to military courts late last year.

Neighborhood Reports: Sheepshead Bay; Residents Cry Foul Over Air
The gentlest breeze wafting inland off the Atlantic is like a deadbolt that renders hundreds of residents in Sheepshead Bay prisoners in their own homes -- stunk in, so to speak, by odors emanating from the 100 million gallons of raw sewage processed each day at a nearby treatment plant.
"There's no delicate way to describe it: the plant constantly reeks of toilet odors," said Bernie Leitner, 63, who lives with his wife, Sondra, in the Kings Bay Cooperative Apartments.
The building where the Leitners live is directly across Avenue Y from what is officially called the Coney Island Water Pollution Control Facility, though the plant is actually in Sheepshead Bay.


SUNDAY, October 31, 1983; RED NOVEMBER
Once it was the Evil Empire.
Now it's the Magic Kingdom.
As if Russia's problems weren't depressing enough, the country's desperate cash hunger has caused it to turn its vast and impressive military enterprise into a kind of theme park -- with very expensive rides.
A new company, MIGS Etc., of Sarasota, Fla., will arrange for tourists to fly, for a price, almost any variety of Russian aircraft, from L-39 training jets to top-of-the-line MIG-29 jet fighters.
Customers need not be pilots, let alone fighter pilots; experienced Russian jet jockeys accompany them on all flights.
Prices start at $6,000 and go up to $45,000 for a program that involves a simulated dogfight.


SUNDAY, October 31, 1983; I SPY, WITH MY LITTLE EYE
The newest technical mutation for the age of paranoia is a hidden video recorder that parents can rent to sneak a view of what the baby sitter does while they are away.
It's called Babywatch; it's designed to look like a pedestal for a lamp or a vase; and it rents for $199 for three days.
For that fee, parents get five hours of tape to peruse for signs of sex, Satanism and contraband candy.
Total Recall, of Spring Valley, N.Y., which is in the business of putting together surveillance systems for businesses, produced the new gadget.
There are eight of them in existence so far, and the company is working on distribution.

Hitler's Handmaiden
To the Editor:
Leni Riefenstahl advanced the cause of Nazism through her epic films.
Here is but one example:
Her propaganda film "Triumph of the Will" was premiered in Heilbronn, Germany, with great pomp and circumstance.
There were loud and boisterous "Sieg Heils" from the audience.

On the City Politic: Voters' Round Table
Four New Yorkers came together for three hours last Sunday with Felicia R. Lee and Larry Olmstead of The New York Times to discuss the candidates and the issues in Tuesday's mayoral election and their feelings about life in New York.
The participants were Melissa Woronoff, 20, a college student who divides her time between the Bronx and Manhattan; Ken Shung, 39, a free-lance photographer who lives in Manhattan; Jerolyn J. Minter, a retired college professor who lives in St.
Albans, Queens, and Roger D. Fields, a "40ish" Harlem resident and the senior vice president of the United Block Front Street Association, a program in which ex-offenders build housing.
What follows are excerpts from their discussion.
What things are most important to you when you look at the quality of life in the city?
ROGER FIELDS: No. 1 is crime, which, as an African-American, is very, very on my mind.
And No. 2 is affordable housing.
When one talks about upgrading and upper mobility in any community, it must be a safe community.
And once you build housing, that housing, which may be comfortable and affordable, has to be in a safe neighborhood.
JEROLYN MINTER: I agree with much of what you're saying, but I think when you put things in order of priority, it's not crime first.
Crime is an offshoot of something that I think is more deeply rooted.
Attention to education and educational standards, economics, housing -- all are built upon the first fundamental, and that's learning how to understand someone who is different from you that you have to live next door to or in the community right adjacent to yours.
FIELDS: Well, I don't tend to agree with you.
When one talks about empowering different ethnic groups, those communities must first have safe streets and must have affordable housing before one can no longer feel stressed.
And one gets angry because one sees that one group is getting more than another group, which also causes division.
No. 2, if we talk about education standards, when you develop affordable housing and affordable home ownership, then those communities become mixed and those educational standards become more active, because the community is not monolithic nor mono-economic.
Melissa, what's your idea of the key areas?
MELISSA WORONOFF: Well, I would agree with Jerolyn.
I would also add not only race but also class and religion.
And I think that's what's great about New York City, but it makes things hard at times.
I mean, to get those things to work out, that's really the starting point and then other things will follow.
KEN SHUNG: My concerns with the city have to do with crime.
I think the real issue for me is, like, who's raising our kids?
When there are two functional parents in the house, then you can maybe have the next generation of people that would want to not resort to crime.
I just feel that you've got to start at home.
If parents don't spend time with their children, then there's no love.
When there's no love, the children don't grow up with any kind of sense of responsibility and moral obligation.
MINTER: I have a concern when I read statistics that come past my desk, that eight out of 10 African-American children are going to be brought up in single-parent families.
What is going to happen to that poor mother who's going out working, trying to support that child.
And she has to put that child in a daycare center if she doesn't get home until 5, and that daycare center or that school program is not going to be able to give them the kind of structure that they need.
When they look and see Mama struggling to pay the rent and buy food, and on the corner is this drug dealer who has diamonds and is driving cars, what's going to happen?
What happens is that person becomes the role model.
WORONOFF: I think it's interesting that there certainly are a lot more single-parent families today.
But I think what needs to happen is that both our city and the country need to acknowledge that families are changing and need to accommodate for that, rather than try to change it.
What can the mayor of this city, whoever is elected, do about any of these issues?
What are they really responsible for?
MINTER: They're responsible for selecting the people who are going to take care of the various city agencies and monitoring them.
I would make sure these people are knowledgeable, decisive, have some humanist to them and are in contact with the needs of the people.
FIELDS: I would fire every single commissioner in the City of New York; that's the first thing I would do.
The second thing, I would go to people who have grown up in this city, understand its problems, are not political.
I would want my commissioners to be responsible to me, not to the Democratic or Republican or whatever leader placed them there.
MINTER: I have come to realize that in our society we aren't willing to give people time enough to bring about change.
You can't come in and change things in four years that have been messed up for the last 12.
FIELDS: Wait a minute, Jerolyn, are you trying to tell me things were messed up in the last 12 years before David Dinkins became Mayor?
This Mayor, he has more nepotism than any other mayor in the history of this city.
He appoints Joyce Brown deputy mayor -- who happens to be married to Carl McCall, the person the Mayor appointed to the Board of Ed.
He appoints Victor Gottbaum to the Board of Ed, and his wife to being Parks Commissioner.
I can go on and on and on.
I think that this Mayor has shown no leadership.
I think this Mayor has gone to traditional clubhouse politics and has not reached out to the community.
I think the city was much better four years ago than it is right now.
Who else wants to jump into that?
WORONOFF: I think the country was better off four years ago than it is now.
I mean, the economy was better.
When the economy goes down, you know, crime does go up.
We have more homeless people.
Fewer people have jobs; more people are being laid off.
I wouldn't place that blame on Mayor Dinkins.
Ken, are you better off than you were four years ago?
SHUNG: Oh, what a question.
I guess -- I don't know, I haven't been that alert in the last four years.
Do I feel more fear when I walk down the street?
I do.
The accusation has been that the Mayor panders too much to blacks.
And that Mr.
Giuliani has pandered too much to whites.
Then the President came in and said that there are too many people in this city who are unwilling to vote for people who are different from themselves, be it because of race or religion.
SHUNG: Anyone who suffers from any kind of discrimination might find truth in that kind of statement.
I think people go into the voting booths after all is said and done, and get very tribal and start to, like, push the lever they feel they can identify with.
FIELDS: I think that everywhere you go there are going to be people who are racist.
But I think people are concerned about issues.
And President Clinton, I thought, made an inappropriate statement which caused the campaign to become even more racially oriented than it is.
What should the Mayor do to build bridges to racial harmony?
MINTER: I believe that Mayor Dinkins has been systematically trying to build those bridges here in New York, initiating programs all the way toward bringing this into fruition.
FIELDS: In reference to Mayor Dinkins's leadership in building bridges, I did not approve of the way he handled Crown Heights.
I did not approve the way he handled the Korean boycott.
I did not approve of the way he dealt with the Washington Heights situation with the drug dealer, in which my tax dollars were used to bury him.
I think when you build bridges, you build them in an objective and corrective manner.
I think, unfortunately, in this campaign, no one is building any bridges.
MINTER: In terms of Giuliani, I don't think that he would be building bridges.
He has set a tone with his activities that, to me, is negative and divisive.
I will vote for David Dinkins, because I believe in his dream.
FIELDS: Well, let me tell you something.
I'm not going to vote for David Dinkins.
I'm going to vote, this ex-offender, this African-American, is going to vote for Rudolph Giuliani.
I think his record in reference to civil rights when he was United States Attorney shows his concern.
I don't see Rudy Giuliani as a police monster.
Tell me about welfare.
MINTER: To eliminate the high numbers of people on welfare, you have to improve the economic situation.
You have to provide training for people so that they can fit into the economic arena for jobs.
For mothers who have to work, you have to provide the services that will care for the child while the mother is in training on a new job.
You have pockets of this happening.
It's not happening across the board in large numbers because you're looking at money.
Where do you get the funding for this?
FIELDS: You've been doing it for 30 years, and it hasn't worked, the social scientist's philosophy.
This is this old liberal philosophy that has kept our community behind.
We need to inform people very candidly.
If you have children out of wedlock continuously, you are going to be punished.
We must stop people from having six children from six different fathers.
No. 2, we cannot reward people because of the fact that they do not wish to work.
I agree with you, we must provide jobs.
But those jobs must be provided with the partnership between private industry and the government.
The government cannot continue to absorb and create these make-believe jobs and cost taxpayers more money.
Now the welfare system rewards you.
What is it that the mayor can and should do?
FIELDS: He should have an aggressive, aggressive program of finding fathers who are not paying.
We need to have these people who are on temporary income maintenance, these Aid to Dependent Children, and these Workfare people actually participate in training and working and placed in private enterprises.
We need an aggressive program like that.
And Mayor Dinkins doesn't have that program.
MINTER: He has started some of these programs.
FIELDS: He hasn't started -- the only thing he has started is sitting there and playing tennis at Gracie Mansion.
WORONOFF: I would say that as far as welfare is concerned, we need to have programs that fit the people's needs, rather than programs that lead people into who we want them to be.
If there are single mothers with children, then we need some sort of daycare for these children while the mothers learn the skills that they need to go out and work.
We need support for our community members out there.
We're talking about ethics and values.
What can any city administration do to affect values -- let's say, the homeless problem?
SHUNG: Well, those policies should not polarize people and put them on the margins of society.
I think people tend to think: "Well, not in my neighborhood. Or not in my backyard. Or I'll just retreat and it won't happen." What happens is, they'll be sitting in a public school, or even a private school.
And the child that grew up on welfare, that value system will be in the same classroom as your child who had maybe a nice upbringing, and those values will cross.
This is a problem that America has to confront, that our value systems, whether you're rich or poor, and those class distinctions, are eventually going to cross paths.
MINTER: You know, another concern is health care.
I think that a lot of women, particularly pro-choice women, may not be inclined to vote for Giuliani, because he has gone back and forth on the issue of abortion.
I think that taking a stance on abortion is really taking a stance on women and how highly you value them.
FIELDS: Well, people are going to vote for David Dinkins, who at one time was not pro-sexual preference, and that's become pro-sexual preference.
WORONOFF: I'd also say that Giuliani's issues on homelessness and his 90-day policy is something that people are going to be looking at.
FIELDS: I think what he was talking about was that bureaucracies tend to drag their feet.
And what he was saying was, "Within that 90 days, I want that person placed." I think he was using the concept that the Rev.
Calvin Butts and the Abyssinian church do in Harlem, that you come to the shelter for a short period of time.
And the first day you're there, you begin to look for employment and permanent housing.
Is the city doing enough?
SHUNG: To deal with homeless?
The city is not doing enough.
I think I don't even look for Mayor Dinkins to solve the world's problems.
I look for him to start moving in the right direction, to build the bridge instead of break it down. . . .
MINTER: I'd like to tell you, I have not voted for Mayor Dinkins because he was black.
I voted for him because I thought he was the best person to do the job.
I'm proud of him because he happens to be an African-American.
I feel that he sets a good role model for African-American children, who can look and say: "I can aspire, too. And doors will not necessarily always be closed to me." But I think he is a man, a human being, trying to do what I would like to see done in this city.
FIELDS: Well, I will tell you, it took a lot for me not to vote for him this time.
Because of race?
FIELDS: Because of race.
It was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made in my life. . . .
You know, it's interesting, because you have such diverse people here.
Here I am, supporting a relatively conservative candidate.
And here are some of the traditional people who you would think would support a more conservative candidate, supporting a liberal candidate.
And what I'm hearing over and over is that we're all saying the same thing.
Who would be the best mayor to take care of the quality of life and show compassion?
We're all saying, who's going to show more compassion?
All of us sitting here who are employed or have some income are saying we're concerned about those people who can't take care of themselves.


A Flop With Many Firsts
To the Editor:
I much appreciated Frank Rich's article about the reissue of original cast recordings, "Broadway Flops Go to CD Heaven"  [ Oct. 10 ] , but am I the only one who longs to hear once again the score from "A Family Affair"?


NEW YORKERS &amp; CO.
Farewell to Macy's Sign: 'World's Largest Store'
The sign on Macy's in Herald Square, proclaiming it "The World's Largest Store," has come down.
An electronic replacement is to go up on Nov. 26 and start operating after Jan. 1.
What kind of messages will the new version broadcast?
Laura Melillo, a spokeswoman for the store, would say only that the sign "says that we are a retailer, and says something about shopping."


Brian Friel Distills Words Into Otherness
The Irish playwright Brian Friel has given himself a near-impossible challenge in "Wonderful Tennessee," a meditative play that will strike its admirers as shimmeringly poetic and its detractors as dramatically inert.
Actually, the work, which had its premiere last summer at the Abbey Theater in Dublin and recently moved to the Plymouth Theater on Broadway, is both -- beautiful and lethargic in equal parts.
There are no galvanizing confrontations but the script's apparent aimlessness is arrested periodically by intimations of the divine.


Neighborhood Report; BACK ON TRACK


Whitman Pins Hopes On Women
CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, outfoxed at nearly every turn during the summer by the wily incumbent, hopes to unseat Gov.
Jim Florio on Tuesday with a late appeal to female voters.
In the final week of campaigning, Mrs.
Whitman's commercials prominently featured women, and the candidate began mentioning more often in debates and speeches that she is the mother of two teen-agers.


Hope Polinsky, David Taragin
Hope Polinsky, an account coordinator for Tribune Broadcasting in Manhattan, was married on Thursday to Dr.
David Lee Taragin, a resident in neurology at the Albert Einstein Medical Center in the Bronx.
Rabbi Gedaliah Anemer officiated at the Sands Country Club in Atlantic Beach, L.I.
The bride, the daughter of Jack and Phyllis Polinsky of Kew Gardens, Queens, graduated from Queens College and received an M.B.A. from St.
John's University in Queens.
Her father is the chief operating officer of JSP Fabrics, a New York textile firm.


N.B.A. Preview: In the East, There's No Jordan
In the Eastern Conference this time around, there are French doors swung wide open with a mat that says, "Welcome, Knicks."
Welcome to the Michael Jordan-less East, where two words -- I quit -- erased all memories of a stand-pat Knick summer and made heavy favorites of the team that stands behind Pat.


EXITING DRUG CHIEF WARNS OF CARTELS
Robert C. Bonner, who has headed the country's main drug-fighting agency for three years, says the United States is ill-prepared to do battle with the world's powerful, highly mobile and tightly managed cocaine trafficking organizations.
"I've had a devil of a time trying to respond to the traffickers," Mr.
Bonner said in an interview shortly before stepping down as head of the Drug Enforcement Administration on Friday to join a Los Angeles law firm.


Neighborhood Report: Flushing; Downtown Expansion Plan: Westward Ho!
Saying that downtown Flushing is bursting with pent-up demand for commercial and residential space, city planners last week recommended measures to encourage development in the central retail hub and channel future construction westward.
"This area has experienced a tremendous influx of new population, economic activity and investment," said Richard L. Schaffer, director of the City Planning Department.
"It's a very vibrant business district that is literally bursting at its seams."


Wall Street; Fighting It Out Over Arbitration
IN 1987, the Supreme Court upheld provisions in brokerage house contracts with investors stipulating that claims against brokers must be resolved by arbitration, and not in the courtroom.
Since that decision in Shearson/American Express v.
McMahon, the number of arbitration cases filed with major exchanges has roughly doubled.
Such cases are lucrative for securities lawyers who represent plaintiffs, especially when there is a contingency arrangement.


Manners Matter In Business
To the Editor:
A civility note to James Bernard, a senior editor of The Source, a hip-hop magazine, who is quoted as saying, "People feel that being polite doesn't get you anywhere -- it's weak." Sir, many of the most talented, most successful, most competitive among us have the best manners.
And they are the strongest.

A Streak in the Heavens Has Become a Straggler
Shuffling through season brochures, peering over the shoulders of customers at record stores and listening to music-business shop talk, one hears a little less about the early-music movement.
Not 10 years ago it was a streak in the musical heavens.
Today it has settled back into the cottage industry where it began, but now with larger, more imposing cottages and superb craftsmen inside them.
About a dozen brilliant ensembles in Europe keep on keeping us up to date on the past; a handful do the same in this country.
Period-instrument orchestras arose and died in New York a few years ago, and maybe not from philistinism or government indifference but simply because they didn't play very well.
New York audiences -- with the recorded sound of splendid English, German and Dutch groups in their ears -- responded accordingly.
Fairness might have dictated more patience, but paying audiences are not likely to subsidize on-the-job career development.


ARE WOMEN'S HEARTS DIFFERENT?
Robin Marantz Henig's article "Are Women's Hearts Different?" (Oct. 3) hit my phobic heart where it hurts.
I had a pacemaker "installed" after a cursory examination and within a week complained of discomfort.
A cardiologist said to me: "You are phobic and it is your attitude that is the problem -- not the pacemaker." He wasn't present when a test showed a defective loose wire, rubbing against my heart.
It took a (four-hour) procedure to have a new wire inserted.

Stigmatized Treatment
To the Editor:
It is unfortunate that a stigma still attaches to substance abuse treatment because many valued employees will be denied the care they need.
I recently treated a patient regarded as a "valued" employee by his employer.
He had been 11 years on the job, with no prior incidents, had tested positive for cocaine use on a random screening and was mandated to 10 weeks of outpatient treatment as a condition for being reinstated.
The tragedy of this situation is that the employee not only lost his wages during his suspension, but his health insurance benefits as well.


Peter A. Smul and Debra J. Rudich
Debra Jill Rudich, a daughter of Joel and Phyllis Rudich of Columbus, Ohio, was married last evening to Peter Allen Smul, a son of Sandy and Vicki Smul of New York.
Rabbi Herschel Schacter officiated at the Stouffer Westchester Hotel in White Plains.
Mrs.
Smul, 29, is a manager of market analysis at Home Box Office, the cable television network, in New York.
She graduated from Dartmouth College, and she and her husband received M.B.A.'s from Harvard University.
Her father is the president and chief executive of Coaxial Communications, a cable television company in Columbus.


Tech Notes; Keeping Tabs on Postal Workers
THE Postal Service may not be able to tell you where your letter is, but it will soon know what time each collection box is emptied.
"We'll be able to determine any early or missed collections," said Lou Eberhardt, a Postal Service spokesman.
"This will really help us smooth our collection schedule out."
As part of a nationwide system that will be completed by the spring, a stainless steel "button" will be placed in most boxes that are emptied twice a day or more.
Employees collecting the mail will carry an electronic wand.
Installation began in New York City earlier this month.


Term Limits Drive the Talented Out of Politics
To the Editor:
As chairman of the Committee on Elections and Reapportionment of the California State Senate since 1987, I have been directly involved in the state and national term-limit debate since its most recent incarnation as a popular political cure-all.
In California, term limits for state officeholders were enacted in 1990; term limits for members of Congress were similarly enacted in 1992.


LAST CALL
Having spent the past year in the Czech Republic, I can tell you that unplanned and unexpected pregnancies are more accepted there than they are here.
I know many parents in their 40's, with children in their 20's, who have accepted still more infants into their lives.
Why is it that we have such an aversion to the unplanned in our country?

Corrections
The Wall Street column last Sunday, about signs of instability at Spectrum Information Technologies, misspelled the name of a public relations firm in Jericho, N.Y., that once worked for Spectrum, and misstated the extent of its recent telephone cutoff.
The firm is De Nigris/Blankman Inc.; its telephone malfunctioned for a time, but remains in service.


Mighty Brazil Rides A Free-Market Wave
WHEN Paul Duval travels to the United States and Europe, all he hears are jokes about Brazil's 2,000 percent annual inflation and Brazil's "minister-of-the-month," the revolving door in the top levels of government.
That's fine for this American shopping center developer.
Why invite competition when you are making money like never before?
"Business is absolutely booming," said Mr.
Duval, a managing partner in Shopinvest, based in Rio de Janeiro.
"We are building three shopping centers, in Rio, Sao Paulo and Brasilia, for a total of $180 million."


Hitler's Handmaiden
To the Editor:
John Simon's sophistication and demanding sense of taste are well known.
All the more dismaying, then, is his fawning review of Leni Riefenstahl's self-serving memoir.
The main problem is summed up in Mr.
Simon's question: "Can the self-deceptions of an obsessed esthete wipe out the fact of her greatness as an artist?" But Mr.
Simon has it backward.
Rather, ask this: Can Miss Riefenstahl's greatness as an artist wipe out the fact that (as Mr. Simon notes a sentence earlier) she put her art to the use of evil?

County To Buy Mt. Vernon Stadium
UNDER a plan developed by Mayor Ronald A. Blackwood of Mount Vernon and County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, this city's aging Memorial Field Stadium will be renovated and made available for both countywide and local sporting and entertainment events by the spring of 1996.
The county has agreed to purchase the rundown stadium -- built in 1930 -- along with the adjoining field and to spend $6 million to refurbish the six-acre site, Mr.
O'Rourke said.
When completed, it will be the largest and most modern sports stadium in the county.

ARNOLD GLIMCHER AND HIS ART WORLD ALL-STARS
Arne Glimcher's West Coast adventures were a lively read.
I'd like to add that, in addition to selling one-of-a-kind works, Pace Editions, the gallery's prints division, pioneered the multiples market by making limited series of signed lithographs available to a new generation of potential collectors at an affordable price.

Habitats/The Right Stuff; A Bargain at Full Price
THE first terrace is more of a Juliet balcony, "only room for six people to have champagne before dinner," Nina Kaminer explained, laughing over her shoulder as she conducted a tour of the empty apartment.
Its parquet floors covered in white dropcloths, the exquisite little prewar duplex in Murray Hill, bought just over a month ago, is getting the full treatment from her contractors.
The floor plans for the renovation were taped to the front door and she pointed out the 4-foot-wide star that will be inlaid in the foyer floor.
"Isn't it terrific?," she asked, stopping only briefly as she headed up the circular staircase to the top floor to show off the second terrace: a 6-foot-wide one that wraps around the 18- by 14-foot master bedroom.


The Sound of Cossack Thunder
The Cossacks are coming, straight out of some 19th-century nightmare.
Those fearsome horsemen once again stalk the Russian steppes, whips stashed in their boots and swords tucked in their belts, defending God and country and longing for the restoration of the Romanov dynasty.
When last seen, they were being obliterated in the bloody Soviet collectivization drives of the 1930's; a million of them died.
Before the Revolution, they had become infamous as the nail in the czarist boot, putting down peasant and worker uprisings and leading pogroms against the Jews and other minorities.

Bermuda
At one time, Bermuda's busiest tourist season was winter.
Visitors, particularly the affluent, would come for a month or longer.
Many of today's visitors still prefer the period from November to March, when the army of T-shirts thins and cashmeres move in, when beach life scales down and the temperature favors golf and tennis.
Hotels and restaurants are not as crowded, rates are lower and cooler does not translate to cold.
At the beginning of the year, in an attempt to convince prospective guests that January toMarch is not cold, a number of hotels offered a "temperature  guarantee," which will be repeated in 1994.
During these months, participating hotels (including Lantana Colony, Elbow Beach, the Reefs and the Princess Hotels) will give a 20 percent discount on room rates on any day the temperature does not reach 68 degrees.


A Game That Offers Coslet a Much-Needed Showcase
As Jets Coach Bruce Coslet looks across the field this afternoon, he will see Dan Reeves, the Giants' coach.
And although he will have a number of different things to think about today, no doubt Coslet's mind will flash to how well the new coach is doing in his first season in New York.
The Giants are off to a 5-1 start and lead the National Football Conference East division.
There are no negative stories flooding out of East Rutherford, N.J.
His team is a model of efficiency and consistency.
Reeves is easing into a smooth transition on all fronts.


Neighborhood Report: Washington Heights; Editor's Apologies Quell Fury Over Article
An article about Hispanic culture, children and sex abuse that appeared in the first issue of a new neighborhood newspaper in Washington Heights hit a raw nerve with so many readers that the editor dedicated much of the second issue to apologizing for the furor.
The article, by Antonio Mendez, titled "Hispanic Culture Translated: More Than Just Language," appeared in Manhattan Heights Forum, a monthly newspaper started last month by Joyce M. Perry, a writer and teacher who lives in Washington Heights.
Ms.
Perry said she started the paper to give the community a sounding board for serious issues, including one that is close to her own heart: the plight of children in the city.

Clinton's Foreign Policy: Top Adviser Speaks Up
W.
Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, sat in his spacious corner office in the West Wing of the White House the other day, breaking his self-imposed vow of silence.
His mission: to defend his boss against critics who say they cannot understand the Clinton foreign policy.
He tried a little joke.


Kay Wahrsager, Michael L. Adler
September wedding plans for Kay Fierman Wahrsager and Michael L. Adler have been announced by the mother of the prospective bride, Karel F. Wahrsager of New York.
Mr.
Adler is the son of Shelley and Arthur C. Adler of Irvington, N.Y.
Miss Wahrsager graduated cum laude from the College of William and Mary.
Her father, the late Sigmund Wahrsager, was a senior partner in the investment banking firm of Bear, Stearns &amp; Company in New York.
Her maternal grandfather, the late Harold L. Fierman, was a founding partner of the New York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler.


Health Plan: Out of the Gate
The Clinton health care plan, at a hefty 1,342 pages and 5 1/2 pounds, thumped into congressional in-baskets on Wednesday.
This version differed from the one leaked last month, with revisions designed to increase the odds of the bill's passage.
Among them: abortion coverage with a "conscience clause" that would exuse people with objections from having to perform the procedure; subsidies for small businesses with with as many as 75 workers, up from 50; the right to choose a doctor, even one outside the patient's plan.


Steps to Keep Toilet Tanks and Machinery Watertight
TOILET-TANK leaks are fairly easy to find and correct.
If moisture accumulates on the outside of the tank, note the tank's height, lift the cover and check the height of the water inside.
If the heights are the same, the problem is condensation caused by water in the tank that cools the porcelain below room temperature.
The cure is to install plastic foam sheets against the inside of the tank with special adhesive.
Kits containing all the insulating materials needed, plus instructions, cost about $20.


Marianne Nebel, Peter Goetz Jr.
Marianne Nebel, the daughter of Michael and Mary Nebel of Potomac, Md., was married yesterday to Peter Benedict Goetz Jr., the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Goetz of Martinsville, N.J.
The Rev.
James Hayes, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated at the Church of St.
Andrew in New York.
Ms.
Nebel Goetz and Mr.
Goetz work for Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade &amp; Douglas Inc., an engineering concern in New York, she as an assistant vice president, he as a proposal coordinator.
She graduated from New York University.
Her father is the president of National Consulting Services, a computer consulting company in Potomac.
Her mother is an executive assistant at PhillipsPublishing Inc., which publishes newsletters in Potomac.


SUNDAY, October 31, 1983; RELATIVITY
Albert Einstein is universally associated with genius and personal nobility.
He won the Nobel prize and worked for world peace.
But according to "The Private Lives of Albert Einstein," just published in Britain, the gentle physicist was an adulterous, egomaniacal misogynist who may have even beaten his first wife.
There is no question he once described her as a woman of "uncommon ugliness." Einstein himself was no Fabio, but his sagging jowls and unruly hair never seemed like Halloween material before.
The newly revealed Bad Einstein, on the other hand, seems tailor made for trick or treating.
Boo!


Voters Guide; At Issue on the Ballot: How the City Works
NEW YORK would still be the nation's largest city and no one elected on Tuesday would automatically lose his job until 2002, but two ballot proposals could change the profile of New York City and the face of its government.
Both proposals would fundamentally challenge the status quo and reflect voter frustration with what many people perceive as ossified incumbents and with unresponsive bureaucrats.
But whether the proposals would improve or merely change the way the city works is debatable.


P. T. Barnum Statue Needs Restoration, Care
Since I learned from the article on the P. T. Barnum statue (Sept. 26) that I have been "taken to task" by several members of the Bridgeport community, I trust you will have no objections to publishing a few corrections and addenda to the article in question.
(1) Thomas Ball's statue of Barnum, after being awarded a medal at the International Exhibition in Munich in 1888, was shipped to a warehouse in Hoboken, N.J., where it was stored until the showman's death in 1891.
It was only after that event that it was moved to Bridgeport, where it remained at the circus's winter quarters while its base and pedestal were being prepared.


Corrections
An article on Oct. 10 about bagel shops around New York misstated the address of Atlantic Bagels in Brooklyn.
It is at 177 Atlantic Avenue, at Clinton Street.


350 Feet Above Flood Ruins, A River Town Plots Rebirth
The Mississippi had its way with this old railroad town, settling in for as long as it pleased and leaving the place dust-caked and barren, an American Pompeii.
Now the people of Valmeyer say they got the river's message.
They voted to move a mile and half east to the bluffs where they used to shoot deer and rabbits, up by the hickory and maple forest they used to drive past to get to their valley, on the hill where they planted a wooden star at Christmas that could be seen clear across the river in Missouri.


Magnet School's Magnet: Preschool
Shanicqua Gant, 3, of Bridgeport and Laura Kantorowski, 4, of Fairfield sat at a small table eating their snacks and giggling.
"I'm finished; when are we going outside?" asked Laura.


My Day in Taxi Court: A Little Justice for All
I AM a habitual filer of complaints with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.
I believe this is my civic duty, the manifestation of a quixotic notion that a minimal standard of polite behavior can be imposed upon New Yorkers.
My story is an ordinary one, the kind you hear at parties and over lunch in the company cafeteria, the kind that is always outdone by someone within earshot who has suffered a greater, more dramatic indignity.


Who Took the Talk Out of the Talk Shows?
Trivializing ourselves to death?
That prospect has to haunt anyone who has followed this year's most contrived television event: the "war" of the late-night talk shows.
In a blizzard of press releases and publicity coups, the professional fates of Dave, Jay, Conan, Arsenio and poor Chevy somehow have become barometers of the very future of television.
With the smoke now clearing, it seems that CBS's flaky David Letterman is a rating point or so -- about a million households, give or take -- ahead of NBC's earnest Jay Leno.
Fox's clueless Chevy Chase has been mercifully canceled.
NBC's jittery Conan O'Brien is still desperately learning on the job.
The determinedly smiling Arsenio Hall seems, with good reason, more paranoid than ever.


Sally M. Sigler, Rodney E. Luery
Mr. and Mrs.
Arnold E. Sigler of Ridgewood, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Sally Margaret Sigler to Rodney Erik Luery, a son of Rodney G. Luery of North Brunswick, N.J., and Ruth Magill of Jamesburg, N.J.
A September wedding is planned.
Ms.
Sigler, 24, is an executive secretary with the American Express Travel Related Services Company in New York.
She graduated from the Katherine Gibbs School.
Her father is a vice president at J. P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. in New York.
Her mother, Marcy Sigler, is an owner of C. C. Van Emburgh Inc., a funeral home in Ridgewood.


Beverly Griffin, Stephen Wong

Louis, King of France.


Consider, Please, the Upside of Fat
To the Editor:
"After Years of Bloated Overhead, It's Time to Get Lean and Mean" (Oct. 10) represents a gratuitous potshot at fatness.
Kmart's pecuniary woes notwithstanding, the metaphor is exactly backwards.
Fat is the biological equivalent of money in the bank.
If Kmart is spending too much, the pattern more resembles anorexia, in which the sufferer spends more energy than she ingests.
I would like to see a fat economy, have a fat bank account, have a job paying a fat wage, etc., instead of being unemployed in a lean economy with my resources on a "long and difficult diet." ROBIN KING  Flushing, N.Y., Oct. 10


Oct. 24-30; A Cold Calculus Of Mass Murder
Since Jean Claude Pressac published his strange book, "The Auschwitz Crematoria: The Machinery of Mass Slaughter," last month, French scholars have debated whether it is a landmark in research on the Nazis' methods of mass murder or a twisted product of a period in which denial of the Holocaust has become more widespread.
Based on previously inaccessible archives in Moscow, the book traces in matter-of-fact detail the methods by which the Nazis obtained the ovens, ventilation systems, poison and other equipment that enabled them to dispose of as many as 2,200 bodies a day at Auschwitz.


Hitler's Handmaiden
To the Editor:
Leni Riefenstahl is mistaken in her belief that neo-Nazis are not using "Triumph of the Will." In fact, it is a neo-Nazi icon.
For $59, you can buy it from the revisionist Institute for Historical Review; for $25, from Tom Metzger's White Aryan Resistance -- to name only two of several sources.
It circulates widely underground.
A copy was found in the apartment of a skinhead in Portland, Ore., who killed an Ethiopian man, Mulugeta Seraw.
A former skinhead who saw it told me he could "see how it sucked people up."


New Season, Old Cast, Room for One More
Nobody in the "Murphy Brown" cast died this year or walked out after a contract dispute.
Still, when the season premiere rolled around, there was a brand-new face on the team.
In television seasons past, series usually acquired new characters as replacements, especially when the youngest child in the cast was aging dangerously out of cuteness range.
But series have other needs, and sometimes they can be met only by new blood, as at least four shows have recently decided.
ANITA GATES "Murphy Brown"
He's boyishly handsome.
He wears denim jackets and camouflage pants and sometimes a touch of Don Johnson stubble.
He's Scott Bakula, portraying a veteran foreign correspondent named Peter Hunt, and just weeks ago a Serbian guard was holding a gun to his head while the world watched via satellite.
Now he's part of the "F.Y.I." television team, where Murphy (Candice Bergen) and her colleagues admit to feeling a little threatened.


The Ax Murders
Oh it breaks my heart to see those stars
Smashing a perfectly good guitar
I don't know who they think they are
Smashing a perfectly good guitar.
-- "Perfectly Good Guitar" by John Hiatt  WHO indeed.
Legend credits Pete Townshend with starting it, back in 1966, when the Who was still a mod pub band called the High Numbers.
Mr.
Townshend smashed, and the fans screamed and demanded he do it again.
And again and again.
Now a whole new generation of bands and fans who've barely heard of the Who is reviving rock's most primal ritual.
And naturally, they think they invented it.


Baggage Check: Weighing Risks
IF you check your baggage on an airline, you are taking a chance.
It may be sent someplace else and arrive long after you do.
It may get squashed or dropped and your shampoo may rupture and ruin your clothes.
If you fail to put identification inside the bag, the tags may be torn off by a conveyor belt and you may never see the bag again.
There are additional disheartening possibilities, criminal ones.
Your bag may be rifled while it is in the custody of the airline or its baggage-handling contractor; your camera, jewelry and field glasses may be taken.
Or the whole bag may be stolen.
A Sept. 30 broadcast of Primetime Live on pilferage of valuables from luggage, with covert videotapes of bags being opened by baggage handlers, has focused attention on this issue.


On Sunday; A Small World, Coexisting On 3 Cushions
INTRICATE as the slow carom and click and gleam of the three balls about the baize tabletop, a pattern emerges in the life of Sonny Cho, who leans competitively in the billiard parlor just beyond the subway el's filigree of sidewalk shadows.
His mother, Mary, first taught him to hold a cue stick over 20 years ago, before the family left Korea.
"She stood me on a milk crate in my father's billiard parlor, and that's how I got my first taste, in the third grade," said Mr.
Cho, who is busy preparing for the big invitational championship next weekend at the Master Billiard parlor in Sunnyside, Queens, where he thinks he has a shot at the $3,000 first prize.

Fires Don't Worry Trainers
The fires raging in Southern California canceled Thursday's card at Santa Anita Park, but three New York-area trainers who will have horses running at the Breeders' Cup there next Saturday said yesterday that they were not concerned.
"It wasn't a problem for us," said Bill Mott, who has already shipped his charges to the picturesque track in Arcadia, Calif., just north of Los Angeles.
"If there was, we're unaware of it." Mott has entered the defending champion, Fraise, in the Turf, and Lech and Paradise Creek in the Mile.


Neighborhood Reports: Flushing; After Layoffs, Bakery Workers Nurture a Plan To Rise Again
Some have taken jobs as waiters, parking attendants and movers; others have simply moved out of town.
But many of the 400 workers who lost their jobs when Stroehmann closed its Taystee Bread bakery in Flushing are still struggling to open a bakery of their own.
Their plan was born when the plant closed in July 1992, and in recent months, the workers have raised about $80,000, bringing their total to nearly $200,000, hired a project manager, and secured pledges from hundreds of people to buy their product once the business gets off the ground.
And they are busily hunting for sites.


Neighborhood Reports; New Road Hours
News for walkers, runners, bikers and skaters: Central Park drives will now be closed to motor vehicles part of each weekday for 10 months of the year instead of 7.
The drives are closed to vehicles weekends all year round.
They are also closed weekdays, 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 7 P.M. to 10 P.M., from April to mid-November.
But this "summer schedule" will now begin in January.


PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
GRAMERCY PARK  Good Old Folk From North Carolina
As part of its 95th anniversary celebration, the National Arts Club will hold the exhibition "North Carolina in New York," which will feature the works of some of North Carolina's best-known painters, sculptors and folk artists (pictured above, "Wrestlers" by Jim Moon).
Most of the artists attended the Penland School of Crafts in Appalachia, which is dedicated to traditional handicrafts.
Much of the exhibit will focus on studio glass, a process pioneered by North Carolina artists decades ago.
The opening reception (a good spot to load up on Southern food and bluegrass music) is free.


Neighborhood Report; A New Bike Path: Recreation With a River View
The Hudson River waterfront beckons the people of TriBeCa, SoHo and Greenwich Village.
But in those areas, getting there to appreciate the view poses an obstacle course that requires dodging vehicles, weaving though parking lots and tiptoeing across crumbling piers.
All that is changing under a $1.6 million project to clear a 27-foot-wide waterfront path for strollers, joggers, bikers and bench potatoes.
The path, to be completed by April 17, will run nearly two miles along the river, parallel to West Street, from Gansevoort Street south to Chambers Street.


Neighborhood Report: Bay Ridge; Massacre, Part 2: Replanting
They called it the Bay Ridge Chain-Saw Massacre: the destruction of 400 cherrywood, apple and pear trees six weeks ago in a beautification plan gone haywire.
Now, the Transit Authority is about to begin planting 35 new trees in what residents call a first step toward recovery.
The project, which was presented to Community Board 10 and about 15 residents on Tuesday, calls for the plantings, which will cost $15,000, to begin early next month, before the first frost, said Mary Sempepos, the board's district manager.


Superman Drops Comic-Strip Pose
ON occasion the only way to tell the difference between children's theater and theater meant for grown-ups is by the time of day of the show.
We know that "It's a Bird . . . It's a Plane . . . It's Superman," at Theater Three in Port Jefferson through Nov. 27, is meant for adults because curtain time is 8 P.M.
Theater Three children's shows are performed in the morning.
The musical, scored by Charles Strouse with lyrics by Lee Adams, was adapted by David Newman and Robert Benton from the comic strip.
It opened on Broadway in 1966, but the version being staged by Theater Three is the revised one presented last year at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn.
Mr.
Strouse also plumbed the comics for his hit musical "Annie" and the current "Annie Warbucks."


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: The Referendum; A Measure to Limit Terms Draws Incumbents' Fire
Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council and a doyen of New York City's Democrats, swept through a center for the elderly on Steinway Street in Queens recently, passing out leaflets and gladhanding a host of constituents.
As Election Day neared, he was fighting the toughest challenge of his long political career, even though he has no opponent.
"I'm not here asking you to vote for me, though that wouldn't hurt," Mr.
Vallone told the center's receptive crowd.
"I have something more important to talk about."


On Pushing (Not Cranking) the Mower
MANY gardening trends have been displacing the traditional ways, but plant tenders have probably been so busy they haven't noticed.
Now that the season is slowing down to a saner pace, there is time for reflection.
The suburbs are becoming quieter.
There is less of that deafening noise from the power mowers and more of that gentle hum from the old-fashioned push 'em yourself reel mowers.
The older models are coming back!

West Virginia Extends Syracuse Drought
For the second consecutive week, Syracuse, a preseason pick to challenge Miami for the Big East title, played the role of punching bag for a legitimate conference contender.
Last week the Orangemen were punished by Miami, 49-0.


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail; Hillary Clinton Praises Florio's Opposition to Assault Weapons
Hillary Rodham Clinton flew to New Jersey for the second time in 10 days today to stand by Gov.
Jim Florio, endorse his ban on assault weapons, and then extol him as the candidate for women.
Mrs.
Clinton's 20-minute speech in a damp and drafty hangar at the Essex County Airport was the highlight of a busy Saturday of campaigning in which Mr.
Florio attended rallies in Atlantic City, Vineland and Turnersville in southern New Jersey, flew here by helicopter, and then went to Camden to attend a children's Halloween party and meet with black and Hispanic officials.


Oct. 24-30: Croatian Slaughter; A Massacre Ghoulish Even According to Bosnian Standards
Along the road to the massacre in the Muslim village of Stupni Do, Croatian nationalist soldiers manning checkpoints seemed almost friendly, as though there were nothing outsiders might find in the hamlet that could be harmful to the cause of a separate Croatian state in Bosnia.
Casualness in the face of slaughter is one of the lesser shocks of the Bosnian conflict.
As they waved reporters through, the young Croats with fair hair and blue eyes, the collars of their camouflage fatigues rakishly turned up, looked for all the world as though they were ushering visitors to a battlefield where Croatian soldiers had performed storied deeds.


Pro-Nazi Rulers' Legacy Still Lingers for Croatia
At a souvenir stand in Zagreb's central market, glaring down over key rings, cigarette lighters and T-shirts, hang portraits of a firm-jawed man in military uniform.
He is Ante Pavelic, who headed the pro-Nazi Government that ruled Croatia from 1941 to 1945.
When a photographer tried to take pictures of the souvenir stand one morning recently, he was quickly surrounded by thugs from the criminal syndicate that controls the market.
Amid invective and threats, they forced the photographer to open his camera and turn over his film.

In Times Square, Turning Profits From 'Gin Mills'
AT 9 A.M. in Rudy's Bar, Ernest Schroeder sits on a stool counting money.
There are many $100 bills, rolls and rolls of quarters, and everything in between.
The cash, around $12,000, represents the weekend take from his four Times Square bars.
At a time when saloons everywhere are struggling, Mr.
Schroeder says that his establishments -- Rudy's, the Full Moon Saloon, the Holland Bar and the Savoy -- are doing well.
The bars are loud, the beer cheap, the food almost free -- and the clientele of a class that would not be terribly affected if the stock market crashed.


Stock Tips
Meat stock is the nexus of modern cooking.
In the 14th century, when the French began shrugging off the medieval palate, with its flavors of mustard, cinnamon, vinegar and sugar, in favor of sauces built from the rich essence of meat, Guillaume Tirel (a.k.a. Taillevent) began writing down the formula for broths as well as sauces that could moisten a variety of dishes.
Careme and later Escoffier built on Taillevent's efforts to codify the saucier's repertoire -- which, in fact, has changed very little in almost 700 years.
Some eras are partial to the rich, brown espagnole sauce, while others favor veloute, the white stock enriched with cream or butter.
Whatever the reigning fashion, the foundation remains the same.
Rich, clear, intensely flavored stock is the springboard for unguentary cooking.


On the City Politic: Voters' Round Table
Four New Yorkers came together for three hours last Sunday with Felicia R. Lee and Larry Olmstead of The New York Times to discuss the candidates and the issues in Tuesday's mayoral election and their feelings about life in New York.
The participants were Melissa Woronoff, 20, a college student who divides her time between the Bronx and Manhattan; Ken Shung, 39, a free-lance photographer who lives in Manhattan; Jerolyn J. Minter, a retired college professor who lives in St.
Albans, Queens, and Roger D. Fields, a "40ish" Harlem resident and the senior vice president of the United Block Front Street Association, a program in which ex-offenders build housing.
What follows are excerpts from their discussion.
What things are most important to you when you look at the quality of life in the city?
ROGER FIELDS: No. 1 is crime, which, as an African-American, is very, very on my mind.
And No. 2 is affordable housing.
When one talks about upgrading and upper mobility in any community, it must be a safe community.
And once you build housing, that housing, which may be comfortable and affordable, has to be in a safe neighborhood.
JEROLYN MINTER: I agree with much of what you're saying, but I think when you put things in order of priority, it's not crime first.
Crime is an offshoot of something that I think is more deeply rooted.
Attention to education and educational standards, economics, housing -- all are built upon the first fundamental, and that's learning how to understand someone who is different from you that you have to live next door to or in the community right adjacent to yours.
FIELDS: Well, I don't tend to agree with you.
When one talks about empowering different ethnic groups, those communities must first have safe streets and must have affordable housing before one can no longer feel stressed.
And one gets angry because one sees that one group is getting more than another group, which also causes division.
No. 2, if we talk about education standards, when you develop affordable housing and affordable home ownership, then those communities become mixed and those educational standards become more active, because the community is not monolithic nor mono-economic.
Melissa, what's your idea of the key areas?
MELISSA WORONOFF: Well, I would agree with Jerolyn.
I would also add not only race but also class and religion.
And I think that's what's great about New York City, but it makes things hard at times.
I mean, to get those things to work out, that's really the starting point and then other things will follow.
KEN SHUNG: My concerns with the city have to do with crime.
I think the real issue for me is, like, who's raising our kids?
When there are two functional parents in the house, then you can maybe have the next generation of people that would want to not resort to crime.
I just feel that you've got to start at home.
If parents don't spend time with their children, then there's no love.
When there's no love, the children don't grow up with any kind of sense of responsibility and moral obligation.
MINTER: I have a concern when I read statistics that come past my desk, that eight out of 10 African-American children are going to be brought up in single-parent families.
What is going to happen to that poor mother who's going out working, trying to support that child.
And she has to put that child in a daycare center if she doesn't get home until 5, and that daycare center or that school program is not going to be able to give them the kind of structure that they need.
When they look and see Mama struggling to pay the rent and buy food, and on the corner is this drug dealer who has diamonds and is driving cars, what's going to happen?
What happens is that person becomes the role model.
WORONOFF: I think it's interesting that there certainly are a lot more single-parent families today.
But I think what needs to happen is that both our city and the country need to acknowledge that families are changing and need to accommodate for that, rather than try to change it.
What can the mayor of this city, whoever is elected, do about any of these issues?
What are they really responsible for?
MINTER: They're responsible for selecting the people who are going to take care of the various city agencies and monitoring them.
I would make sure these people are knowledgeable, decisive, have some humanist to them and are in contact with the needs of the people.
FIELDS: I would fire every single commissioner in the City of New York; that's the first thing I would do.
The second thing, I would go to people who have grown up in this city, understand its problems, are not political.
I would want my commissioners to be responsible to me, not to the Democratic or Republican or whatever leader placed them there.
MINTER: I have come to realize that in our society we aren't willing to give people time enough to bring about change.
You can't come in and change things in four years that have been messed up for the last 12.
FIELDS: Wait a minute, Jerolyn, are you trying to tell me things were messed up in the last 12 years before David Dinkins became Mayor?
This Mayor, he has more nepotism than any other mayor in the history of this city.
He appoints Joyce Brown deputy mayor -- who happens to be married to Carl McCall, the person the Mayor appointed to the Board of Ed.
He appoints Victor Gottbaum to the Board of Ed, and his wife to being Parks Commissioner.
I can go on and on and on.
I think that this Mayor has shown no leadership.
I think this Mayor has gone to traditional clubhouse politics and has not reached out to the community.
I think the city was much better four years ago than it is right now.
Who else wants to jump into that?
WORONOFF: I think the country was better off four years ago than it is now.
I mean, the economy was better.
When the economy goes down, you know, crime does go up.
We have more homeless people.
Fewer people have jobs; more people are being laid off.
I wouldn't place that blame on Mayor Dinkins.
Ken, are you better off than you were four years ago?
SHUNG: Oh, what a question.
I guess -- I don't know, I haven't been that alert in the last four years.
Do I feel more fear when I walk down the street?
I do.
The accusation has been that the Mayor panders too much to blacks.
And that Mr.
Giuliani has pandered too much to whites.
Then the President came in and said that there are too many people in this city who are unwilling to vote for people who are different from themselves, be it because of race or religion.
SHUNG: Anyone who suffers from any kind of discrimination might find truth in that kind of statement.
I think people go into the voting booths after all is said and done, and get very tribal and start to, like, push the lever they feel they can identify with.
FIELDS: I think that everywhere you go there are going to be people who are racist.
But I think people are concerned about issues.
And President Clinton, I thought, made an inappropriate statement which caused the campaign to become even more racially oriented than it is.
What should the Mayor do to build bridges to racial harmony?
MINTER: I believe that Mayor Dinkins has been systematically trying to build those bridges here in New York, initiating programs all the way toward bringing this into fruition.
FIELDS: In reference to Mayor Dinkins's leadership in building bridges, I did not approve of the way he handled Crown Heights.
I did not approve the way he handled the Korean boycott.
I did not approve of the way he dealt with the Washington Heights situation with the drug dealer, in which my tax dollars were used to bury him.
I think when you build bridges, you build them in an objective and corrective manner.
I think, unfortunately, in this campaign, no one is building any bridges.
MINTER: In terms of Giuliani, I don't think that he would be building bridges.
He has set a tone with his activities that, to me, is negative and divisive.
I will vote for David Dinkins, because I believe in his dream.
FIELDS: Well, let me tell you something.
I'm not going to vote for David Dinkins.
I'm going to vote, this ex-offender, this African-American, is going to vote for Rudolph Giuliani.
I think his record in reference to civil rights when he was United States Attorney shows his concern.
I don't see Rudy Giuliani as a police monster.
Tell me about welfare.
MINTER: To eliminate the high numbers of people on welfare, you have to improve the economic situation.
You have to provide training for people so that they can fit into the economic arena for jobs.
For mothers who have to work, you have to provide the services that will care for the child while the mother is in training on a new job.
You have pockets of this happening.
It's not happening across the board in large numbers because you're looking at money.
Where do you get the funding for this?
FIELDS: You've been doing it for 30 years, and it hasn't worked, the social scientist's philosophy.
This is this old liberal philosophy that has kept our community behind.
We need to inform people very candidly.
If you have children out of wedlock continuously, you are going to be punished.
We must stop people from having six children from six different fathers.
No. 2, we cannot reward people because of the fact that they do not wish to work.
I agree with you, we must provide jobs.
But those jobs must be provided with the partnership between private industry and the government.
The government cannot continue to absorb and create these make-believe jobs and cost taxpayers more money.
Now the welfare system rewards you.
What is it that the mayor can and should do?
FIELDS: He should have an aggressive, aggressive program of finding fathers who are not paying.
We need to have these people who are on temporary income maintenance, these Aid to Dependent Children, and these Workfare people actually participate in training and working and placed in private enterprises.
We need an aggressive program like that.
And Mayor Dinkins doesn't have that program.
MINTER: He has started some of these programs.
FIELDS: He hasn't started -- the only thing he has started is sitting there and playing tennis at Gracie Mansion.
WORONOFF: I would say that as far as welfare is concerned, we need to have programs that fit the people's needs, rather than programs that lead people into who we want them to be.
If there are single mothers with children, then we need some sort of daycare for these children while the mothers learn the skills that they need to go out and work.
We need support for our community members out there.
We're talking about ethics and values.
What can any city administration do to affect values -- let's say, the homeless problem?
SHUNG: Well, those policies should not polarize people and put them on the margins of society.
I think people tend to think: "Well, not in my neighborhood. Or not in my backyard. Or I'll just retreat and it won't happen." What happens is, they'll be sitting in a public school, or even a private school.
And the child that grew up on welfare, that value system will be in the same classroom as your child who had maybe a nice upbringing, and those values will cross.
This is a problem that America has to confront, that our value systems, whether you're rich or poor, and those class distinctions, are eventually going to cross paths.
MINTER: You know, another concern is health care.
I think that a lot of women, particularly pro-choice women, may not be inclined to vote for Giuliani, because he has gone back and forth on the issue of abortion.
I think that taking a stance on abortion is really taking a stance on women and how highly you value them.
FIELDS: Well, people are going to vote for David Dinkins, who at one time was not pro-sexual preference, and that's become pro-sexual preference.
WORONOFF: I'd also say that Giuliani's issues on homelessness and his 90-day policy is something that people are going to be looking at.
FIELDS: I think what he was talking about was that bureaucracies tend to drag their feet.
And what he was saying was, "Within that 90 days, I want that person placed." I think he was using the concept that the Rev.
Calvin Butts and the Abyssinian church do in Harlem, that you come to the shelter for a short period of time.
And the first day you're there, you begin to look for employment and permanent housing.
Is the city doing enough?
SHUNG: To deal with homeless?
The city is not doing enough.
I think I don't even look for Mayor Dinkins to solve the world's problems.
I look for him to start moving in the right direction, to build the bridge instead of break it down. . . .
MINTER: I'd like to tell you, I have not voted for Mayor Dinkins because he was black.
I voted for him because I thought he was the best person to do the job.
I'm proud of him because he happens to be an African-American.
I feel that he sets a good role model for African-American children, who can look and say: "I can aspire, too. And doors will not necessarily always be closed to me." But I think he is a man, a human being, trying to do what I would like to see done in this city.
FIELDS: Well, I will tell you, it took a lot for me not to vote for him this time.
Because of race?
FIELDS: Because of race.
It was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made in my life. . . .
You know, it's interesting, because you have such diverse people here.
Here I am, supporting a relatively conservative candidate.
And here are some of the traditional people who you would think would support a more conservative candidate, supporting a liberal candidate.
And what I'm hearing over and over is that we're all saying the same thing.
Who would be the best mayor to take care of the quality of life and show compassion?
We're all saying, who's going to show more compassion?
All of us sitting here who are employed or have some income are saying we're concerned about those people who can't take care of themselves.


TROUBLED WATER
The great water scare was brought to us by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the same group that perpetrated the scare that Alar in apple products created cancer risks.
Same tactics: old, fully documented data sensationalized to look like an expose, coordinated release of material by a professional P.R. firm to print, radio and television, as well as a book by a freelance writer reviewed just in time.
The incredible thing is that the news media went for the bait again.

Iona Quarterback Throws For 6 Scores Against Siena
Iona 54, Siena 21
Quarterback Tom Proudian threw for six touchdowns as Iona routed host Siena, 54-21, yesterday at Loudonville, N.Y.
Iona (7-1 over all, 4-0 in the conference) extended its winning streak to six games and remained undefeated in the Metro Atlantic Conference.


DEATH BENEFITS
I have enjoyed the company of journalists at lonely places, and argued the essential truth of their profession at isolated outposts and in the backs of trucks.
That truth is, they are not, as Malcolm W.  Browne would have us believe (Endpaper/Life and Times: "Death Benefits," Oct. 3), in a state of grace; rather, they are in limbo, condemned to watch from afar the passions and pain of humanity.
It is this that forces them back to their hotel rooms, showers and bars, leaving those who may never return to continue their Sisyphean tasks.


Phoenix Dining: Rising Expectations
SUDDENLY Phoenix is bursting with good restaurants.
Even as recently as five years ago, for anyone interested in great food this humming desert oasis provoked little more than a yawn.
A favorite of retired America, it was also the capital of white-bread America.
There was Vincent Guerithault's and then . . . not much more.
Today, the chef's stylish Vincent's on Camelback, at 3930 East Camelback Road, is still at the summit of Phoenix restaurantdom, but the summit is no longer such a lonely place.
Since they opened in 1990, Christopher's and Christopher's Bistro, just down Camelback at No. 2398, have quickly developed into two of this country's best dining rooms, with constantly evolving menus that reflect the quirky creativity of the chef Christopher Gross.
The stunning wine list bespeaks the increasing expertise of his sommelier wife, Paola Gross.


Open Doors in Carriacou
ARTHUR BAIN, the silver-haired local pilot, circles his six-seater while cows lumber and cars gun it off the 1,500-foot runway, which is also the main road.
An insouciant great blue heron observes the landing from the bordering mangrove swamp.
A sign next to the road-runway warns, "Stop, Look, Listen for Approaching Aircraft, Then Proceed With Caution." The customs official offers apologies on behalf of the cows: "Usually they know the schedule of the flights." Welcome to Carriacou.
I will learn in the days ahead that cooperation is the spirit of this 13-square-mile island, the largest in the Grenadine chain, 23 miles northeast of Grenada.
People, goats, cattle, cars, chickens, exotic tropical birds and occasional small aircraft share the space amicably.
Beaches and doors are open, boundaries flexible.
Mountains give way to green pasture, green pasture to white beach and beach to blue sea.
Goats, tethered to swings and slides, share a playground with children.
A cow tied to a clothesline rubs its back against drying sheets.


Iraq Raid Stirs Doubts on Clinton Policy
To the Editor
An article by Seymour M. Hersh in The New Yorker suggests that the Clinton Administration had inconclusive evidence for its charge that Saddam Hussein was responsible for an attempt to assassinate former President Bush in Kuwait (news article, Oct. 25) -- and thus for the bombing of Baghdad.
This raises important questions, which require Congressional investigation.

ARNOLD GLIMCHER AND HIS ART WORLD ALL-STARS
I can't imagine that the artists on your cover are pleased with their group appearance.
They look a little too pampered, groomed and well fed, and in the shadow of Glimcher.
Most artists I know tend to bridle at the term "stable," which connotes something tamed, bought and owned.

Hold the Wine And Pass the Beer
BEER is big: there are more varieties of beer than ever on store shelves; new breweries are opening; restaurants are beginning to have beer lists, and many restaurants are designing special menus to accompany an assortment of beers.
The beer dinner is replacing the wine dinner.
And it can also happen at home.
At a restaurant beer dinner, an assortment of four or five beers are chosen, like wines, to accompany certain dishes.
Sometimes the dishes themselves are made with beer.


Neighborhood Report; BACK ON TRACK


Down but Undefeated In 'Norman Conquests'
SARAH and Annie are desperately seeking love and attention, and Norman is right there to provide it.
So what if Norman is married to Ruth, who is Annie's sister?
It isn't that Norman is indifferent to Ruth.
The line he uses for his conquests ("I want to make you happy") is, indiscriminately, spoken, even to his wife.
But her typical response is "Yes, I love you, too, Norman, but please leave me alone."


Making It Work; On the Garbage Team
IT was an ungodly 2:48 on a Wednesday morning when a yellow-and-black-striped heap of a subway train puffed and jerked into the station at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue.
On the platform, a woman who seemed to have had a long evening, judging by her scowl and the wig that sat askew atop her head, began to yell.
"Move this thing faster," she ordered, clearly grasping the fact that her train would not arrive until this thing was gone.
"Get this out of here!"


NEW YORKERS &amp; CO.
Farewell to Macy's Sign: 'World's Largest Store'
The sign on Macy's in Herald Square, proclaiming it "The World's Largest Store," has come down.
An electronic replacement is to go up on Nov. 26 and start operating after Jan. 1.
What kind of messages will the new version broadcast?
Laura Melillo, a spokeswoman for the store, would say only that the sign "says that we are a retailer, and says something about shopping."


Democratic Decorations At Bard College
Though the Post-Modern movement took Robert Venturi's ideas in ridiculous directions, many of those ideas have become even more valuable with time.
Architects agonizing over how to design buildings for today's culturally fragmented public, for example, could do worse than reacquaint themselves with Venturi's concept of the "difficult whole." Unity is not meant to be easy, Venturi proposes, nor is diversity synonymous with distintegration.
Difference is as great a civic virtue as justice, faith or grandeur.
And seldom has it been celebrated as delectably as at Stevenson Library, Venturi's new addition to a pair of library buildings at Bard College.
The strength of the design is due partly to Venturi's smart solution to a complex problem, but it also owes much to the context he found there.
A small school with a progressive reputation, Bard sits high on a bluff above the Hudson River in Annandale, commanding views that have scarcely changed since the days of the Hudson River painters.
Its original library, a perfectly proportioned Ionic temple built in 1893, is the ideal architectural accent for this American arcadia.
Of ivory brick surrounded by weathered stone columns, this Greek Revival gem stands for the idea of America as a natural paradise where democracy could take root.


The Executive Life; Spending the Bounty From Studio Takeovers
MORE than once, Frank Price has been in the right place at the right time to make millions of dollars -- and now he's positioning himself for another success.
As chairman of Columbia Pictures when it was taken over by the Coca-Cola Company and a producer at Columbia/Tri-Star when the two were acquired by Sony, Mr.
Price is using some of the fortune he made in those deals to invest in a new distributor, Savoy Pictures.
The company, where he is also a director, is headed by Victor Kaufman, who created Tri-Star and was vice chairman at Columbia during the Coca-Cola years.
Putting his money into enterprises like this now is what attracts him.
"That's the idea -- to make a successful company," he said.

Channel Tunnel List Is Opened to Americans
Americans who want to be among the first to ride through the Channel Tunnel on trains connecting England, France and Belgium can now sign up with Britrail Travel International.
The tunnel is scheduled to open May 6, carrying trainloads of officials in 3 hours between London and Paris and 3 hours 15 minutes between London and Brussels.
After opening day, two services, Eurostar and Eurotunnel, will operate trains for the general public.
Eurostar service is for people riding inside passenger trains; Eurotunnel service, also called Le Shuttle, is for freight and automobiles, which, with drivers and passengers riding inside their vehicles, will be carried on rail cars.


Squaring The Circle
To the Editor:
Something struck me while reading Caryn James's essay "You Are What You Wear"  [ Oct. 10 ] .
For years, it's been a movie cliche that the white man always gets the Asian woman, dead or alive ("The World of Suzie Wong," "Rambo II," "The Year of the Dragon," etc.) Lately, it seems that the white men are having the Asian men also ("The Wedding Banquet," "M. Butterfly").
Perhaps it takes "The Ballad of Little Jo" to square the circle by having: a white woman, dressed up as a white man, possessing an Asian man, in a braid.


Councilman Is Hurt Confronting Cyclist
City Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff, a Republican from the East Side of Manhattan, was punched in the face by a bicyclist yesterday after asking the man to ride on the street, rather than the sidewalk.
Mr.
Eristoff, who is in the middle of a tough race for re-election to the seat he won in a special election last February, was attacked shortly after 2 P.M. near the Sloan's Supermarket on First Avenue near 20th Street, the police and his aides said.
He suffered a deep cut on his left cheek, they said.


Voters Guide; After All the Talk, It's Decision Time
AFTER thousands of handshakes, tons of chicken dinners and millions of dollars in nasty and overblown television commercials, the big day is now just two days away, and for better or worse it's time to decide.
You can be forgiven for thinking the main thing that has divided the incumbent Mayor, David N. Dinkins, and and his Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is whether George J. Marlin, the Conservative Party candidate, should have been included in their debates.
But as the chart at right shows, there are some real distinctions between the men who would be Mayor.
At the same time that you are being asked to decide who should spend the next four years in City Hall, you will get to weigh in on whether eight years in office is enough for anyone.
If it is approved, ballot proposal No. 4 would force candidates who win on Tuesday and are re-elected in four years to be out by 2001.
Meantime, voters on Staten Island will take the next step in deciding whether what Gotham joined together man should put asunder.
Finally, you may just have a hot race for the City Council in your neighborhood.
So go see.
You have nothing to lose but your vote.

Oklahoma Death Row Inmate Is Returned to New York
After months of legal wrangling and a feud between governors, Thomas Grasso, the twice-convicted killer who preferred a death sentence in Oklahoma to prison in New York, was brought back to New York yesterday to serve out a 20-year-to-life term for the 1991 murder of an elderly Staten Island man.
Accompanied by Oklahoma law-enforcement officials, the 30-year-old inmate left a prison in McAlester, Okla., on Friday and arrived at 8:30 P.M. at Sing Sing prison in Ossining, N.Y., where he had been held before he was transferred to Oklahoma.
New York prison officials said that shortly after 10 P.M. he was placed in a vehicle to be taken to another New York prison, which, for security reasons, was not being announced until his arrival.

Profile: James Lebenthal; Municipal Bonds? Boring? Not in This Showman's Hands
IT is a disgusting image.
The front of the truck trailer lurches upward, causing garbage to ooze from the rear.
Most of the load is indistinguishable: the mess is gooey, gunky, endless.
But here is a box that once contained Betty Crocker au gratin potatoes.
There, a Spam can.
On the container's fuzzy gray floor are the remnants of a small boy's sneaker.
And the smell is really, really revolting.
"This is a fascinating thing," exclaims the thin man attired in a gray nailhead suit from Barneys, a $90 necktie and silk socks.


Difficult Odds


The Obvious Shot: Getting Beyond It
SOMETIMES, the hardest thing to do when you're photographing is to get beyond the obvious.
This summer we were in New Hampshire, driving beside a wide, shallow river, and we decided to pull over and rest.
I got out and began walking up and down the bank, taking pictures.
The light was a wonderful silver, reflecting jagged highlights off the river's surface.
A pale line of mountains stretched across the horizon; bright orange and yellow wildflowers dotted the near bank.
The scene was a little trite, but I was simply trying to record the experience as best I could.


Neighborhood Reports: Sheepshead Bay; In a Garden by the Water, a Tower of Memories
At the western point of Sheepshead Bay, where land and water meet, a light will glow atop a tower.
It may be taken for a lighthouse, or a fiery chimney.
It will be an eternal flame, in memory of the millions who perished in the Holocaust.


Neighborhood Report: Flushing; Downtown Expansion Plan: Westward Ho!
Saying that downtown Flushing is bursting with pent-up demand for commercial and residential space, city planners last week recommended measures to encourage development in the central retail hub and channel future construction westward.
"This area has experienced a tremendous influx of new population, economic activity and investment," said Richard L. Schaffer, director of the City Planning Department.
"It's a very vibrant business district that is literally bursting at its seams."

Peter Quennell, a Man of Letters And Man About Town, Dies at 88
Peter Quennell, a dashing English man of letters who also wrote about the celebrities he socialized with, died on Wednesday in London.
He was 88.
A published author for 71 years, Sir Peter was a prolific critic, biographer, historian, reviewer, essayist, poet and editor of books and journals.
He was equally known as a wit, gossip, world traveler and hedonist.
He was knighted last year.


Africa Gets A Vote for 2004 Games
Interest by Africa in the 2004 Summer Games may postpone China's continuing bid to be host to the Olympics, the president of the International Olympic Committee said yesterday.
China was widely considered to be a front-runner for the 2004 Games after losing a 45-43 vote last month to Sydney, Australia, for the rights to the 2000 Games.
At the very least, the Chinese were expected to make a strong push for the 2004 Games, which will be awarded in three years.


Administration Leaves Top Civil Rights Jobs Vacant
A year after Bill Clinton was elected on a platform that included re-invigorating civil rights policy, his Administration has yet to fill many of the critical policy positions.
Civil rights organizations are generally pleased by the direction taken by the Administration in major Supreme Court cases involving voting and civil rights.
But the groups are frustrated by the slow pace of appointments.
Important vacancies at the Justice and Labor Departments and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have left on hold a variety of issues affecting women, minorities, the disabled and voting rights.


Waiver Language
To the Editor: My wife and I had a nearly identical experience to that of Dan and Sylvia Larsen in the Practical Traveler ("Waivers: More Than a Warning," Aug. 22) when we signed up for a rafting trip last June in Denali National Park, Alaska.


10% of Fruit Juice Sold in U.S. Is Not All Juice, Regulators Say
The clandestine production and sale of adulterated fruit juice is a widespread and highly profitable practice, a review of court cases filed across the country shows -- a practice that is costing American consumers an estimated $1.2 billion a year and exposing them to undisclosed and unapproved chemicals.
Regulators at the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees the food industry, had hoped that tainted juice would become less common after the Federal prosecution in 1987 of Beech-Nut Nutrition Corporation.
Beech-Nut paid a $2 million fine for illegally selling "apple juice" that was nothing more than sweetened water and chemicals.
But the recent cases all involved activities that continued long after that landmark case.
Enforcement Still Haphazard
And while Federal officials say they are committed to pursuing adulteration cases, court exhibits and interviews with investigators and juice industry executives show that enforcement efforts are still haphazard, plagued by inadequate resources and an institutional tradition that has put a low priority on cases that, at least until recently, were not considered a threat to public safety.


De La Hoya, Floored, Stills Wins in Round 1
Oscar De La Hoya moved his scripted career in the ring forward tonight.
And in the process, he showed he was not just another pretty face.
America's sole gold medalist of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics was knocked down in the first round for the first time in his amateur or pro career by the experienced Narciso Valenzuela.
But the first round never went to its three-minute conclusion.
De La Hoya came back from the left hook and pounded Valenzuela to the canvas twice with flurries.
The second time, the Mexican didn't get up as the referee counted to 10.
It took all of 2 minutes 25 seconds.

A Truly Golden Oldie
To the Editor:
The most serious omission from Frank Rich's article is the Jerome Moross and John Latouche collaboration "The Golden Apple," a work that was quite successful Off Broadway before moving to the Great White Way.
This work (which really is an opera) helped spawn the career of Kaye Ballard, and one song, "Lazy Afternoon," has received the attention not only of many composer/arrangers and musicologists but also of Barbra Streisand in the 1970's.
Alas, the original cast album (highlights, once issued on RCA and reissued on Elektra) shows no sign of being reissued by either company.

Finding Out What Happens To All That Recycled Material
THE county's newest museum combines sociology, economics and science in a smartly designed showcase, for recyclable garbage.
The site is the new Education and Conference Center of the Material Recovery Facility here, where county residents can learn what happens to the trash they put out at the curb.
The Material Recovery Facility -- nicknamed Murf -- celebrated its first birthday recently with an official ceremony to open the new center.
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke and other officials cut the ribbon alongside a robot made of soda cans, a mannequin dressed in newspapers and a dummy promoting recycling.
A potpourri of bottles, cans and containers dangled from the ceiling over their heads.


LAST CALL
I recently found myself pregnant at an older age and can understand Elizabeth Berg's ambivalence about starting again with a new baby.
She doesn't mention, though, how essential it is to have the choice of continuing or terminating a pregnancy.
My hopes, too, were shattered by an early miscarriage.
While I can defer to a decision made by Mother Nature, I will not accept the harassment and irrationality of the clinic pickets.

A Long Road on Affordable Housing
A RECENT proposal to build two five-unit apartment buildings for homeless families on a residential stretch of the Post Road here drew protests from some members of neighborhood associations a few weeks ago and highlighted the tensions surrounding the issue of affordable housing in the county.
These units were proposed by the nonprofit housing organization known as Shore -- the acronym stands for Sheltering Homeless Is Our Responsibility -- and were targeted for homeless families or others who qualified.


Russia Ties New Libyan Sanctions to a Loan
Russia is threatening to veto new Security Council sanctions against Libya for refusing to surrender two suspects in the bombing of a Pan American World Airlines airliner over Scotland five years ago unless the United States, Britain and France give it an interest-free loan to cover a $4 billion debt Tripoli owes it.
The United States and its allies are resisting the Russian demand, which one American diplomat described as "a nonstarter."


New Branch of the Tate Honors Cornish Town
With its stone cottages and narrow cobbled streets, the seaside town of St.
Ives, about 300 miles southwest of London, has long been an inspiration to British artists.
Now a new branch of the Tate Gallery celebrates the Cornish town and the painters, sculptors and potters who turned this former fishing village into an artists' colony.
The three-story gallery, which opened this summer, was designed by the British architects Eldred Evans and David Shalev.Among the five main rooms are two devoted to a group of artists who lived and worked in St.
Ives from 1925 to 1975, including the painters Ben Nicholson, Terry Frost, Christopher Wood, Alfred Wallis and Bryan Wynter, the sculptor Naum Gabo and the potter Bernard Leach.


A Menu Newcomer: Manchurian Dishes
A RESTAURANT that stamps itself Asian, Eastern or Oriental is making a statement.
It is saying that its cuisine is a mixture.
Usually that means two-thirds Chinese dishes, one-third Japanese and a sprinkling of something exotic, often Thai.
Eastern Pavilion in East Setauket has a new twist, Manchurian.
The menu describes the food as "a combination of Japanese, Korean, Russian and Chinese cooking . . . from the region of the frigid Siberian North and the land of hearty pioneers."


Hooked On Cider
A COUPLE of weeks ago I went up to the Berkshires and sank my teeth into a Golden Russet.
It was crunchy and aromatic, with a tangy-sweet flavor that lingered like pineapple.
"It's my favorite eating apple," Thomas Christopher yelled over the clanking of his Farmer's Favorite Mark, a 19th-century cider press with an early-20th-century motor.
"It's the only American variety I've found that has the right combination of sweetness, acidity, tannins and aromatics to make a good cider all by itself."


Terrorize A Child, Pull a Crowd
At the end of "The Good Son," two of the world's most valuable child actors are dangled off the edge of a cliff -- for real.
This stunt may be the latest cultural symptom of how quickly children are growing up.
Macaulay Culkin, as a murderous little boy, and Elijah Wood, as the good-seed cousin who spots his crimes, were suspended high above the ocean, just like macho adults who insist on doing their own tricks.
How can you hang a kid off the side of a cliff?


Neighborhood Reports; New Road Hours
News for walkers, runners, bikers and skaters: Central Park drives will now be closed to motor vehicles part of each weekday for 10 months of the year instead of 7.
The drives are closed to vehicles weekends all year round.
They are also closed weekdays, 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 7 P.M. to 10 P.M., from April to mid-November.
But this "summer schedule" will now begin in January.


PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD: Red Hook; Dancing Along the Way
Red Hook Arts, a multimedia youth group, has teamed up with Dancing in the Streets, which specializes in site-specific performances, to create a production that stretches along several blocks of Red Hook.
The audience will meet at Pier 41 and walk through Red Hook as a Narratr relates the neighborhood's history, with stops at warehouses, the Trolley Museum and other spots for brief dance and music performances, some by local schoolchildren and the elderly.
The price will end with a play staged at the Beard Street pier.


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: Financing; Why Contributors Give To Opposing Candidates
The candidates for mayor portray the battle for City Hall as a titanic struggle between competing ideologies.
But when it comes to campaign contributions many influential people have decided to play it safe and give to each side, campaign records show.
Some contributors call it hedging their bets.
Some say it is political indecision.
Some profess a genuine admiration for both candidates, and some say they simply changed their minds in midcampaign.
But the upshot is that scores of contributors have insured that they will be in the winner's corner, no matter who wins on Tuesday.


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Watch; Dinkins Draws a Crowd; Giuliani Plays Solitaire
In the final campaign week as seen on television, Mayor David N. Dinkins wrapped himself in the cloak of his incumbency, buoyed by an all-star cast of Hollywood and Washington celebrities.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, in contrast, played the Lone Ranger, poised to avenge four years of municipal evil with no big guns by his side, no fancy munitions at all beyond faith, family and a handful of turncoat Democrats.
As Mayor Dinkins leaned into the televised embrace of Barbra Streisand, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and Tipper Gore, his Republican-Liberal challenger appeared proudly on the evening news beside his latest supporter, Andrew S. Fisher of the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation.
As Mr.
Dinkins clasped hands with President Clinton ("a friend of mine from Hope, Arkansas"), Mr.
Giuliani stood alone at a podium before four questioners on WCBS-TV in a hand of political solitaire that was supposed to have been a debate.


Train to the Plane: Will It Ever Fly?
When the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey first proposed a light rail system that would finally link New York City's airports to Manhattan by sleek, quiet electric trains, people cheered.
But now that the plans are nearing completion -- with a proposal to put the Manhattan terminal in one of the worst traffic spots in the city -- rumblings of opposition are surfacing.
Just about everyone recognizes the need for better access to Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports, where congested highways are the principal transportation connection to the rest of the city.


Oct. 24-30: Haitian Standoff; Aristide Calls for A Total Embargo
Caught in a stalemate with Haiti's military leaders, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the deposed President, asked the United Nations last week to impose a total trade embargo to force his opponents to resign.
Father Aristide was supposed to return to Port-au-Prince yesterday , under the terms of a United Nations-brokered agreement that was signed in July by the Haitian President and the country's military ruler, Lieut.
Gen.
Raoul Cedras.
Father Aristide says he is ready to return but only after General Cedras has given up power.


Melissa Moore, Richard Abate
Melissa Moore, a doctoral candidate in politics, and Richard R. Abate, a doctoral candidate in American studies, both at New York University, were married yesterday.
The Rev.
Dr.
Alfred A. Moss performed the Episcopal ceremony at the University Club in New York.
Ms.
Moore, 24, is keeping her name.
She graduated from Smith College.
She is a daughter of Harold and Mary Ann Moore of Maplewood, N.J.
Her father is a partner in the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.
Her mother is the municipal welfare director of Chatham Borough and the towns of Maplewood, South Orange and Millburn, all in New Jersey.


Neighborhood Reports: Upper East Side; A Cheaper Express Bus Brings Protests
As the city sees it, the new, less expensive Harlem-to-Wall Street express bus along Fifth Avenue is an enhancement of existing express services, and people should be happy.
But Yorkville residents are complaining: they fear the new private service will threaten two public East Side lines to Wall Street.
Their concern is that the Transit Authority will close the York Avenue route to lower Manhattan for lack of passengers, forcing residents to walk to Fifth Avenue for the other bus.


Rangers Burn Whalers as Patrick Fiddles
James Patrick sat in the press box in his suit and his tie, leafed through the press notes, watched the Rangers' goals as they were replayed on television and didn't play hockey.
Again.
That situation is not likely to change anytime soon.


Twyla Tharp: Back to Basics
"Demeter and Persephone," Twyla Tharp's premiere in the Martha Graham Dance Company's recent, rich season, offered a shrewd look at mother-daughter relationships.
It was not a masterpiece, but it was, finally, a mutual success for both the choreographer and the troupe.
The company's range was extended by a work that was novel, in the best sense, and Ms.
Tharp revealingly redefined herself as a modern-dance choreographer.
For more than a decade, she has insisted on seeing herself as a classical choreographer -- working with ballet companies, hiring ballet dancers for her own group and making increased, if often inverted, use of the classical ballet vocabulary.
Yet she has never accepted the codified classical idiom as a given.
At heart, she remains rooted in a modern-dance mentality.
That is, she's more interested in exploring new movement than in accepting a single vocabulary as a creative premise.


Kansas St. Tops Oklahoma
Kansas St. 21, Oklahoma 7
Fans tore down the goal posts yesterday after Kansas State beat Oklahoma for the first time in 23 tries, but there wasn't much celebration in the Wildcats' locker room.


Ms. Sonkin, Mr. Stoneburn
Michelle Sonkin, a daughter of Ralph and Bea Eisemann of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., was married last evening to Stephen Stoneburn, the son of the late Sidney and Tilda Stoneburn.
Rabbi A. Bruce Goldman officiated at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York.


Benjamin to Miss Preseason Finale
While Derrick Coleman and Rick Mahorn both practiced with the Nets today for the second straight day, Benoit Benjamin missed the drill and will not play Sunday afternoon against the Minnesota Timberwolves at Duke University in Durham, N.C.


The WASP Descendancy
I never thought I'd be having tea with someone who had tea with Edith Wharton.
But to spend an afternoon with Susan Mary Alsop in her Georgetown drawing room is to realize that our country is not so old, after all, that its history can be spanned in a single afternoon.
Many people come to Washington to make history, but few know it as personally as Mrs.
Alsop does.
In 1934, when she was 16, Susan Mary Jay was taken by her Great-Aunt Harriet to tea with Wharton at her country house outside Paris.
The young girl hoped the famous expatriate would talk about Marcel Proust and Aldous Huxley.
But the writer, a plump, elderly woman in a shapeless suit wound about with scarves, was less like the enchanting Ellen Olenska than the tiresome Lawrence Lefferts.


Value Caribbean Style
BARGAINS are fair game in the Caribbean, and some can be found without trying.
One example: A hotel shopper looking for a room in Puerto Rico called the small Casa San Jose, a stylish bed and breakfast in San Juan, and asked for the "best rate." The choices for Sept. 12 and 13 were few: A $150 windowless room on the first floor or a $200 suite with a view on the third.
The bargain hunter paused to consider: windowless claustrophobia versus a view -- or two long flights of stairs versus convenience.
The voice at the hotel broke in: "You can have the $200 suite for $180."
All discounts don't come that easily, especially during the winter high season when expensive hotels are often full.
But negotiating is certainly in order.
Published rates should not be taken at face value.
Some hotelkeepers say without caviling that they will negotiate.
On the other hand, the published bargain rate can also slide upward -- a special package may be "subject to availability." Most packages are not available during holidays; the best bargains in winter are in January, when rates dip at many hotels.
In any case, discount packages need close scrutiny.

POSTINGS: Solving a Style Conundrum; Museum's Addition Is Designed To Reflect a View of the Future
In designing an addition to the Museum of the City of New York, James Stewart Polshek &amp; Partners found itself in a contextual sandwich.
To the west, on Fifth Avenue, was the original museum, a neo-Georgian structure with red bricks and pediments.
To the east, running from 103d to 104th Streets, was the Patrick Henry Preparatory School, a gabled and yellow-brick building modeled on a French Renaissance town hall.
Rather than mimic the older buildings, Mr.
Polshek's office produced a spare and straightforward modern composition.
"We didn't attempt to be cute," he said.
"We have not replicated quoins or punched windows. But we used the same brick and the same marble trim in ways that speak to the next century rather than the past century." The point, Mr.
Polshek said, was to express the expanding mission of the museum, where exhibitions are to focus on the future of the city, as well as its past.


Term Limits Drive the Talented Out of Politics; Aid to Orderly Change
To the Editor:
Let me disagree with "Term Limits Limit Voters' Rights" (editorial, Oct. 21), which suggests that term limits "violate democracy." The instinct of the voters to limit terms is sound.
The purpose is not to "Force the rascals out," as you phrase it, but to open up the electoral process.
Under the present system corruption and special interests are institutionalized by the unlimited number of terms incumbents may serve.


Corrections
Because of an editing error, a review on Oct. 3 about "The Lives of Beryl Markham," by Errol Trzebinski, misidentified the first woman to fly a plane solo across the Atlantic.
She was Amelia Earhart; Markham was the first woman to do it from east to west.


Neighborhood Report: Tribecca; When a Hotel Is Half Historic
A proposal to build a 34-floor hotel tower and attach it to a warehouse in a historic district is being hailed by some as an ideal marriage of opposites.
Others denounce the plan as a monstrous urban misfit.
Hearings at the Landmarks Preservation Commission last week and at Community Board 1 the week before drew clashing testimony on the proposed Hudson Hotel and Conference Center, to be built on an empty lot at the northeast corner of West and Laight Streets.


Yangtze Cruise
To the Editor: Nicholas D. Kristof's sour report of his cruise, "The Yangtze's Gorges" (Oct. 10) certainly did not match the impressions that my wife and I had on a five-day cruise in July on the same boat, the Yangtze Paradise.
What Mr.
Kristof viewed as a ho-hum sight of "high mountains on either side of the narrow channel" we experienced as soaring escarpments that brought a sting of tears to the eyes at such monumental and overpowering natural beauty.
Too bad about the rain he reported, but the Chinese can hardly be blamed for that.
When we traveled during the hottest period of the year, the sun was out, and when we left the air-conditioned cabin to lounge on our private balcony, we did not see "ugly and industrial" river banks "with one hulking factory next to another." What we saw was a river busy with junks chugging upstream and drifting downstream and fishermen up to their waists at the river's edge scooping nets into the waters, raising them to the surface, finned trophies sparkling in the sun.


Inquiry Delays Solarz's Appointment as Envoy to India
President Clinton has put off nominating former Representative Stephen J. Solarz as Ambassador to India after a background check found problems that the Administration is unwilling to specify.
New York Newsday reported today that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service had been drawn into a deepening investigation of the former Brooklyn Congressman, and subpoenas have been issued.
But the newspaper said it could not confirm the nature of the allegations or possible infraction or misconduct that was holding up the nomination.


Boo!
Tonight millions of people who usually measure out their lives in coffee spoons, commuting, the evening news and Sunday afternoon football will break loose.
They will act silly.
They will wear funny clothes.
They will probably embarrass their children, who may think it's O.K. for them to leave the house dressed like Barney but pure nuttiness on their parents' part.
They will be wrong.
There are times, and Halloween is one of them, when pretending to be somebody else is the height of sanity.


Bottle Collecting: Pieces of the Past Worth Digging Deep For
SOMEWHERE under dense overgrowth in this industrial Raritan Bay town, Glenn Vogel and Glenn Harbour are digging through the ash, clay, sand and rusting metal of history.
For more than six hours, the slow, rhythmic work is punctuated by odd bits of nursery rhymes and nonsense songs that float up from a 15-foot hole in the abandoned dump.
Mr.
Vogel and Mr.
Harbour estimate they are digging down as far as 1895.
Scattered around the opening are the remains of leather boots, wooden buckets, porcelain bowls and eight-inch-long oyster shells -- all of which they have dug up and none of which interest them.


Corrections
A picture in The Times Magazine last Sunday, with an article about 50 influential people in fashion, was printed in error.
The photograph, supplied with an erroneous label by a publisher, showed a model who appears on the cover of "John T. Molloy's New Dress for Success," not Mr.
Molloy himself.


Neighborhood Report: Washington Heights; Homicide Rate Falls by 27 Percent
The number of slayings in the 34th Precinct, long among the most murderous in the city, has dropped sharply so far this year, according to police statistics.
But the experts disagree on just how to interpret the new figures.
Slayings in the precinct, which covers Washington Heights and Inwood, were down by 27 percent through the end of September from last year at the same time, to 51 from 70.
The 1992 total, 98, also represented a drop from the precinct's all-time high, 119 in 1991.
The number had risen steadily from 1987 to 1991.


Jane Humpstone, L. C. Ward 3d
Jane Hamilton Humpstone, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
John H. Humpstone Jr. of Locust Valley, L.I., was married yesterday to L. Courtney Ward 3d, the son of Lee C. Ward Jr. and Barbara Ward, both of New York.
The Rev.
Erik Kolbell, a United Church of Christ minister, performed the nondenominational ceremony at the National Arts Club in New York.
Ms.
Humpstone, 30, is keeping her name.
She is the manager of program strategies for Apco Associates, a public affairs concern in Washington.
She graduated magna cum laude from Colgate University, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
Her father retired as the president of Legal Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Bowne &amp; Company, the financial printing company in New York.


Marrakesh Expressive
An old ruin can seduce the imagination anywhere, but especially in Marrakesh.
It was there that Simon Xavier Hermes came under the spell of a 500-year-old palace, the former domain of a sultan's brother.
Half in shambles, its columns supported by spare timbers, its halls clogged with collapsed plaster, the house "felt wonderfully real," says Hermes, a scholar of comparative religion and a scion of the French leather clan.
"There it was, stewing in its own juices."
The house was not habitable by modern standards.
A classic of the urban villa type, with impossibly long, narrow rooms arranged around an outdoor courtyard, it lacked comfort and amenities and would need substantial renovation.
Neighborhood buildings would have to be annexed for bathrooms.
Rooms were accessible to each other only through the courtyard outside.
A mazelike entrance of narrow zigzagging corridors -- great for defense in the 16th century -- was hardly what you'd call welcoming.


Alfie, Oh Alfie, What Can We Do With Ye?
To the Editor:
In "For Best Results, Forget the Bonus" (Viewpoints, Oct. 17), Alfie Kohn suggests that rewards are dangerous.
Extrinsic rewards such as money, praise and recognition will, according to him, undermine intrinsic interest in rewarded activity.
If this is so, it is strange that his own attacks on rewards persist, since they have surely earned him money, praise and recognition.


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: Long Island; G.O.P.'s Grip In Nassau Shows Signs Of Strain
The 41-year-old truck driver, a registered Republican, owes his son's job to the Republican machine that has run Nassau County nearly all his life.
But for the first time, the approaching election for county executive is triggering none of the familiar reflexes.
Thomas S. Gulotta, the incumbent, whom most residents here seem to have met at one ribbon-cutting or another, has failed to win him over.
"He started out with a surplus, and all of a sudden we're in a deficit," said the man, chin resting on his garden rake.
"Taxes keep going up. It's just like the Federal Government." He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing his son would soon be unemployed if the father's plans to vote for Mr.
Gulotta's rival, Benjamin L. Zwirn, became known.


Phone Speaks English
American visitors to Switzerland who can't speak any of that country's four languages -- French, German, Italian and Romansch -- can still get information on topics ranging from baby-sitting to ski conditions by calling Anglo-Phone.
The 24-hour service's English-speaking operators, at 157-50-14, can also draw on lists, updated daily, of lawyers, doctors, veterinarians and other professionals.
Each call is $1 a minute.


Poignant "Pathetique"


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: Policy Change; Workers' Partners Added To Health Plan by Dinkins
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who has aggressively sought the support of gay and lesbian voters, yesterday announced that New York City would provide health benefits to the domestic partners of homosexual city workers.
The city would join 12 other municipal governments that already do so.
The partners of unmarried heterosexuals would also be entitled to the benefits.


My Day in Taxi Court: A Little Justice for All
I AM a habitual filer of complaints with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.
I believe this is my civic duty, the manifestation of a quixotic notion that a minimal standard of polite behavior can be imposed upon New Yorkers.
My story is an ordinary one, the kind you hear at parties and over lunch in the company cafeteria, the kind that is always outdone by someone within earshot who has suffered a greater, more dramatic indignity.


Neighborhood Reports; Lights! Pedestrians! Safety!
It may come as a surprise to residents of the Upper West Side, but they don't stay out late enough, at least according to two groups bent on increasing neighborhood safety.
The Police Liaison Group and West Side Crime Prevention say that residents fearful of nighttime dangers limit their forays, leaving the streets to drug dealers, prostitutes and homeless people.
So, in a project called West Side Lights, the two groups have joined Community Board 7, the police and Consolidated Edison to press landlords and store owners from 88th Street to 92d Street, between Broadway and the Hudson River, to supplement the vague glow of streetlights with high-powered, wall-attached lamps.


THE WORLD: The Conservatives' Devastating Defeat; Canada Joins the World in Dumping Incumbent Leaders
IN a sense, the Canadian elections last week constituted a revolution.
With the Conservatives nearly obliterated, regional parties have been infused with sudden national power, and are threatening to dissolve the country into jealous fiefs.
Only the Liberals, swept to victory by Ontario, the most populous and richest province, remain a force to hold things together.
The changes, which give the Liberals led by Jean Chretien a comfortable majority of 178 out of 295 House of Commons seats but have created hostile factions of western Reformers and Quebec separatists, took place for reasons that are both born of Canadian politics and are also international.
Nine years ago the Conservatives, led by Brian Mulroney, came to power with the largest number of seats in the history of Canada.
But his Government, and that of his successor Kim Campbell, could not control high joblessness, high budget deficits and debt.
So a grassroots fury developed against Mr.
Mulroney, and it was followed by a campaign of gaffes by Ms.
Campbell.


LAST CALL
I am approaching 44 and have gone through the same reckoning that so many of us have (Hers: "Last Call," by Elizabeth Berg, Oct. 3).
The tracts about passages to new stages -- to a freedom to relinquish the burden of fertility and maternity -- are interesting but not felt.


Make His Night, Too


Neighborhood Report; Hanging Baskets
Central Park employees last week began hanging the first of 140 new wastebaskets on lampposts.
The 20-gallon black steel baskets, raised four feet off the ground to discourage rodents, are part of a $27,000 project to improve trash collection.
Next month, the park's 55-gallon drums will be replaced with plastic covered carts that hold 100 gallons.
In the spring, blue carts for recycling bottles and cans are to be installed.
The new containers are for south of 72d Street; the program will be extended next year.
M.H.


Neighborhood Repots: Upper East Side; After Fire, Church Seeks Aid
The Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth Avenue at 90th Street is starting a million-dollar fund-raising campaign this week to help restore the church, which was badly damaged by a three-alarm fire on Aug. 7.
Fire destroyed half the chancel area of the Gothic stone building, with damages estimated at more than $3 million.
Perhaps the biggest loss was an enormous, elegant Austin organ, considered one of the finest in the city.
The Episcopal church had long been noted for the quality of its musical offerings.


Public &amp; Private; Competitive Cancer
On Mortality Monday, when I have the sonogram, the mammogram and the shakes, there comes a four-minute interval during which I believe I have breast cancer.
"We just want to take a few more pictures on the left side," is what the technician says, and she takes them and bustles off, leaving me to contemplate lumpectomy, mastectomy and chemotherapy until the doctor returns to report that there was some problem with the film and all the little spots are gone, vamoosed, vanished, have a nice year, everything's fine.


The Guys, the Ghouls, the Girls
It's expensive being a friend of Robert Woolley, the socially stringent auctioneer at Sotheby's.
Tonight, amid hay bales and pumpkins at the auction house, Mr.
Woolley will give his fourth annual Halloween party, a benefit for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, and he has devised a novel price scale for tickets.
Old friends are expected to donate $500; new friends, $250, and acquaintances, $125.


THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: The Undecided; Mayoral Race Still Perplexes Many Voters
Emily Toney, an insurance underwriter, says she is torn between voting for Rudolph W. Giuliani like her mother, who says she thinks he can "take the bull by the horns," and voting for David N. Dinkins because he has rebuilt housing in her depressed Brooklyn neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant.
In nearby Park Slope, Edward Murphy, a lifelong Democrat, says he fears that deep down he has the urge to vote for Mr.
Giuliani, a Republican, because the candidate is white.
"That's the only reason I've waited so long to decide," he said, tugging on his Yankees cap.


Neighborhood Report: Central Park; Park Program Puts Homeless to Work
Bearing the tools of his trade -- a metal reacher and plastic bags -- Bill Durham set out at 7:30 A.M. the other day on his usual route, along the western rim of Central Park from 85th to 100th Streets.
He knew what he would find: newspapers, Popsicle sticks and drinking straws all over; cigarette butts around the bus stops, and lots of crack vials.
By 9:30 he had picked up and bagged every scrap in his sector.
After half an hour for breakfast at the Yorkville Common Pantry, a nonprofit agency, he was back in the park, ready to rake leaves.


50 Years of Fashion


ARNOLD GLIMCHER AND HIS ART WORLD ALL-STARS
The 11 artists pictured on your cover look like an aging football team and the art gallery owner, Arnold Glimcher, a B-team coach.
And perhaps this is the point, with the headline "Arnold Glimcher and His Art World All-Stars." Is art now a sport where gallery owners lure the best-selling artists from other galleries for a higher price?
And is this the 90's?
Women were better off in the 1930's, when photographs of artists gathering together included at least one woman, perhaps Georgia O'Keeffe.

TROUBLED WATER
Sara Terry's article "Drinking Water Comes to a Boil" (Sept. 26) deftly captures the critical nature of the threats to our cities' water supplies.
Many of the dangers stem from the fact that surface-water supplies (reservoirs, lakes and streams) are especially vulnerable and costly to treat.
There is an underutilized alternative for many small and large cities -- ground water.

THERE'S the green sea.
Lovely.
The beach.
A twisting road.
And the commercial drones on, the announcer properly bored or maybe sad as he laments the state of our workaday world:

A la CarteBay Scallops, a Rare Breed Indeed, Are Making a Return Visit
BAY SCALLOPS are small, sweet and special.
They are tender treats that grow in bays, harbors and ponds from Massachusetts to Long Island.
Although bay scallops are most abundant from November through March, it seems as though fewer are available each year.
As a result some restaurants mislabel calicos, which come from Southern waters, as bays.
Connoiseurs do not relish the less desirable and flavorful calicos.


Neighborhood Reports: Sheepshead Bay; In a Garden by the Water, a Tower of Memories
At the western point of Sheepshead Bay, where land and water meet, a light will glow atop a tower.
It may be taken for a lighthouse, or a fiery chimney.
It will be an eternal flame, in memory of the millions who perished in the Holocaust.


It All Ends Tuesday


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
JAPANESE LANTERNS
It was the slope of her wide-brimmed hat in an old photo that inspired the title "Rita Hayworth" for one of Jeff Shapiro's stone lanterns.
But the more obvious influence on his work is Japanese, reflecting 10 years of study in 4 Japanese cities.
An exhibition of Mr.
Shapiro's indoor-outdoor lanterns will be on display at the Gallery in the Courtyard in Katonah through Nov. 22.
Using pieces of uncut natural stone for which he scours the Catskill stream beds, he creates a central ceramic core that blends with the stone and contains the lighting source -- a candle or an electric bulb.
Sometimes a carefully casual growth of moss or lichen is added.


Glittering New Capital Belies Turmoil in Nigeria
Amid a wooded plain and soaring granite hills, a new city is rising here, its splendor and vast scale in stark contrast to the pervasive rot and decline of much of Africa.
This is the site of Nigeria's new capital, a reflection of the country's sense of itself as black Africa's leader, and at the same time a symbol of a nation hoping to be one of the world's great powers in the next century.


'Stuck In the Muck'
To the Editor:
I am at once pleased, offended and puzzled by Michael Kimmelman's essay "A Few Artless Minutes on '60 Minutes' "  [ Oct. 17 ] .
Mr.
Kimmelman grudgingly commends our report for questioning the opaque nature of contemporary art criticism and the objects upon which it heaps so much impenetrable praise.
But he condemns us for lumping together such disparate artists as Jeff Koons, Cy Twombly, Robert Gober and Robert Ryman.
Mr.
Kimmelman does not seem to understand that it was not "William Paley's network" that lumped them together; it was the spring sale of contemporary art held at Alfred Taubman's sale room -- Sotheby's.


Mutual Funds; Customs That Bewilder Investors
CERTAIN tricks of the mutual fund trade can leave an unwary investor feeling quite mistreated.
With some legal sleights of hand, the industry can make funds, or their track records, seem very different from what they really are.
And investors can trip themselves up, too, by not understanding fine distinctions in fund language.

Wall Street; Philip Morris Shows How to Stay Down
IN the weeks before she went on maternity leave in July, Rebecca Barfield, a tobacco analyst at First Boston, entertained the same question from client after client: What will you name the baby?
Her stock answer: "It won't be Philip, it won't be Morris, and it won't be Winston."
No wonder.
Like most other analysts following tobacco companies, Ms.
Barfield had been caught off guard on April 2 -- Marlboro Friday -- when Philip Morris said 1993 operating earnings would drop as much as 40 percent.
The stock plunged $14.25 that day to $64.125, and closed Friday at $53.75.

Aden Mohammed Abdi was rather surprised when some American troops appeared at his two-room shack about a week ago and told him he was about to get a new home.

11 on Fire Escape Rescued in a Blaze
Six adults and five girls in pajamas were rescued yesterday from a third-floor fire escape at an apartment building on the Upper West Side as flames rolled from second-floor windows, Fire Department officials said.
The one-alarm blaze was reported at 4:44 A.M. at 930 Columbus Avenue, near 106th Street, in a five-story brick building.
The fire apparently started in a second-floor apartment and spread rapidly, engulfing much of the floor when firefighters arrived four minutes later.


ARNOLD GLIMCHER AND HIS ART WORLD ALL-STARS
America has too many artists producing too much middle-of-the-road landfill.

Landscape Inspires Clothing for Men
ON the linings of the breast pockets inside of thousands of men's suits in stores throughout the country, the labels read "Allyn Saint George -- American Classic" or "Allyn Saint George -- American Couture."
"The first label is on proper business attire; the second group has a more upscale look," said Allyn St.
George, the designer.
He draws inspiration for his clothing collections, he said, from the grounds of his 19-acre estate here, called Saintland.


Neighborhood Reports: Upper West Side; Yes, Broadway Malls Can Blossom Too
The unhappy state of Broadway's median strips may be most obvious to the people living above them.
"When you walk by the malls, you see one piece of garbage," said Eugene Hide, the president of the Broadway Mall Association.
"When you live on the 10th floor and look down, you see a hundred pieces."
But this year, merchants, co-op boards and condominium owners on Broadway and West End Avenue contributed to clean up the malls in a pilot area from 86th to 96th Streets.

Summary


Grilled Fare in Handsome Surroundings
PLEASE notice that this review does not begin with words like "Well, pardner, out yonder at the Rattlesnake Bar &amp; Grill in South Norwalk . . ." When the menu headings are Snake bites (appetizers), Buckaroo Burgers, Sagebrush &amp; Tumbleweed (salads) and Serious Grub (entrees), it is easy to fall into Old West palaver.
The decor features a bleached cow skull and a larger-than-life snake sculpture whose glittery mosaic-skinned body winds itself along the top of the long bar in the main dining room.
Less hokey and actually quite attractive is the natural wood structure, suggesting rafters, in front of and above the bar, from which hangs a series of colorful Indian rugs, reminiscent of a Southwestern lodge.

New York Standard Time; Here Today, Gone Unaccountably
This is the weekend for turning clocks back one hour, a reversal that gets farmers and cows back in sync but is no big deal in New York, where time enjoys a weird life of its own regardless.
While some things here go on forever - the Mets season, to take a ridiculously easy case - a more disturbing trick of New York Time is that it can make things vanish or materialize between midnight and 8 A.M.
Many chicken take-out places have become tanning salons in just this way.


Steps to Keep Toilet Tanks and Machinery Watertight
TOILET-TANK leaks are fairly easy to find and correct.
If moisture accumulates on the outside of the tank, note the tank's height, lift the cover and check the height of the water inside.
If the heights are the same, the problem is condensation caused by water in the tank that cools the porcelain below room temperature.
The cure is to install plastic foam sheets against the inside of the tank with special adhesive.
Kits containing all the insulating materials needed, plus instructions, cost about $20.


Mangled Metaphors
Perot is a good fellow," Lee Iacocca said about Ross Perot (the former H. Ross Perot) in preparing to challenge the billionaire's anti-Nafta campaign, ". . . but he's on the wrong side of the angels here."
In reporting this comment, Newsweek said the former Chrysler boss was "gearing up for his role" as Administration anti-protectionist spokesman.
Gearing up was a suitable figure of speech to describe the action of an automobile executive.

The Irish Make Up For Earlier Lapses
For the first time in nearly two years, Notre Dame was trailing at halftime.

It was fizzling right there, plain and simple, for everyone to see.


NEWS ABOUT THE MAGAZINE
With this issue, The New York Times introduces an enlarged and redesigned Magazine.
Many familiar features remain; even so, the changes in look, structure and content are probably the most substantial since the Magazine was born 97 years ago.
The Times has changed vastly since then, especially on Sunday.
Each Sunday section has become virtually a magazine for its own special field.
The redesign that starts today aims to focus this general-interest Magazine on what it does best: Our central mission is to publish articles on subjects in the news that are meticulously reported, written with narrative power, edited with unhurried care and presented dramatically in glossy color.
That squares with the companion purpose of seeking out and publishing outstanding photojournalism, capitalizing on our high-quality gravure reproduction.


A World Away From the Series; Mitch Williams Goes Home to Soothe That 'Achin' Inside'
A pale moon, like an eavesdropper, had appeared above the modest red wood ranch house here in central Texas.
In the cool early evening, Mitch Williams, in that now familiar scraggly beard and sweatshirt, jeans and black cowboy boots, sat on the deck and looked out over the broad, flat 600 acres he owns, which, he says, when giving directions to it, is "in the sticks, four miles from paved roads."
It was here that Mitch Williams came immediately after the World Series.
It was here he came to get away.
To get away from the madness and taunts and death threats and police protection that his performance in the World Series had generated.
To get away "from blowin' that last game," as he described it, to get away from "achin' inside."

The Hot Stove League Cools Off
Once upon a time, baseball's winter gathering was the oasis in the barren land between the end of the World Series and the start of spring training.

"No question that played a role," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said in discussing the altered off-season schedule.
"It became a distraction."


Scholar, Diplomat, Artist Beyond Compare
The art of the 17th-century northern Baroque has an odd reputation in America.
Everyone is mad for the Dutch painters of the era -- the soulful Rembrandt with his golden shadows and the light-soaked domestic perfections of Vermeer -- but the Flemish Peter Paul Rubens?
His name evokes Church Triumphant martyrdoms, over upholstered female nudes, and epicene monarchs costumed as gods, images that have little appeal in the censorious, secular, anti-everything 1990's.
Yet few paintings visiting this country at present are as captivating as Rubens's "Garden of Love," the centerpiece of an exhibition titled "The Age of Rubens" at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (through Jan. 2).
Many of the characteristic beauties of Flemish Baroque art can be savored in this panoramic image: sensuous figures, neo-classical architecture, acres of marvelously wrought silks and exotic stuffs, putti as plump as pillows, stormy skies and lambent rays of sunlight that speak of the cruelty of time and the triumph of human love.

Two bullet holes were visible in the window of the New Look Beauty Salon at 106-59 Guy R. Brewer Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens, about a block south of York College.
No weapon was recovered at the scene, and there were no immediate arrests.

Not Quite On the Fringe
To the Editor:
I should like to clarify a point made by Peter Watrous is his essay on this year's Meet the Composer grants  [ "Yes, It's Improvised. But Is It Really Jazz?" Oct. 10 ] .
He referred to my Oregon group, Pacific Rim Players, as "an unrecorded big band." In fact, our recording debut was in 1989 on the Italian label Blank Saint, with the saxophonist/composer Anthony Braxton; it received a five-star review in Down Beat magazine.
Other recording projects in the works are with the pianist Andrew Hill for Soul Note and with the reedsman Vinny Golia for Nine Winds.

Bruce Babbitt's Landscape, at Risk
For months, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has been trying to persuade Congress to accept a small increase in grazing fees and new regulations to halt the deterioration of 260 million acres of public rangeland.
And for months, he has been frustrated by Republicans determined to embarrass President Clinton and by a small but ornery group of Western Democrats determined to preserve a way of life that exists mainly in their minds.
An exasperated Mr.
Babbitt now says he will impose the fees and regulations by administrative fiat, which is his right under the Federal rule-making process.
But that is not the outcome he had hoped for.


New Jersey Q &amp; A: John J. O'Brien; Staying on Top of Newspaper Trends
JOHN J. O'BRIEN, the executive director of the New Jersey Press Association, has come a long way since his days of sweeping the floors in the press room at the weekly Hunterdon County Democrat in Flemington 28 years ago.
Though it seems odd now, he thought he had "reached the pinnacle" of his career when the paper quickly promoted him to Linotype operator in the composing room, setting news articles and advertisements in hot metal.


Technology; Carving Out Real-Life Uses for Virtual Reality
A SURGEON planning a delicate operation practices it over and over, making cuts and retracting organs in different ways until he is satisfied he has found the best approach.

Virtual reality, the use of electronic sensors and computer-generated images to give people the illusion of participating in fabricated events, is moving beyond the game room and into practical applications in medical schools and other real-life settings.


Mercury Is Hazardous Over the Long Term
To the Editor:
An Associated Press report Oct. 21 on contamination of soil by elemental mercury in New York's Westchester County is, unfortunately, misleading about the hazard.
It is hazardous to contaminate the soil, but not because mercury "can cause brain damage or loss of muscle control if ingested or inhaled in even very small amounts."

Bomb Informer's Tapes Give Rare Glimpse of F.B.I. Dealings
It is shortly after a bomb has blown a hole five stories deep at the World Trade Center and an F.B.I. agent is talking to Emad A. Salem, the former Egyptian army officer who is the bureau's secret source of information, its most valuable undercover operative.
But rather than talk about the conspiracy, about who was involved in it and how it was done, Mr.
Salem's concerns are more mundane, involving unpaid parking tickets, the tolls he pays as he travels between New York and New Jersey, the expenses of using his own car to carry out his informer's duties.

Working Class
LIKE ascots, pinkie rings, jodphurs and overalls, cowboy boots look right on only certain types of men.
They are the male equivalent of stiletto heels: what makes one man kind of macho can make another fellow look really ridiculous.
Over the years, they have been worn, with mixed results, by everyone from George Bush and Bill Clinton to Robert Redford and Kevin Costner.

Neighborhood Reports; Lights! Pedestrians! Safety!
It may come as a surprise to residents of the Upper West Side, but they don't stay out late enough, at least according to two groups bent on increasing neighborhood safety.
The Police Liaison Group and West Side Crime Prevention say that residents fearful of nighttime dangers limit their forays, leaving the streets to drug dealers, prostitutes and homeless people.
So, in a project called West Side Lights, the two groups have joined Community Board 7, the police and Consolidated Edison to press landlords and store owners from 88th Street to 92d Street, between Broadway and the Hudson River, to supplement the vague glow of streetlights with high-powered, wall-attached lamps.


Three Actors, Three Tales
Last year Matt Dillon appeared as Cliff, the hilariously untalented musician in the movie "Singles." Mr.

In this adaptation from "A Pound of Flesh: Perilous Tales of How to Produce Movies in Hollywood," published last week by Grove Press, the producer Art Linson describes how he negotiated with Mr.
Dillon's agent, how he helped cast Sean Penn in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" and how Leonardo DiCaprio was discovered.

U.S. Rejects Document on Aristide's Health
Government officials said today that a document used to brand President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti as mentally unstable was probably a forgery.
The document had already been rejected as a possible fake by the Central Intelligence Agency, several Government officials said today.
They said it was circulated by opponents of Mr.
Aristide in Congress, not by the C.I.A., which has nonetheless described the deposed President as possibly unstable and stands by that judgment.


World Markets; Nikkei Gets a Face Lift -- and Futures
WHEN the Japanese stock market began its long free fall in 1990, regulators thought they knew what the problem was: Those new-fangled stock index futures, and the American brokers who used computers to trade them.
So the regulators sought to dampen the market in Nikkei 225 futures by making them more expensive -- jacking up the margins, or the downpayment investors must make on their purchases.

Probably both, since this is how art is celebrated nowadays -- in cutting deals.

'Big Bird' Eases Chaos At Airport in Tokyo
FORM is supposed to follow function throughout Japan, so it is no surprise that the country's newest and most desperately needed air terminal, at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, is called Big Bird.
And from the air it looks exactly like that -- a bird about three football fields long, its wings spread .
Haneda is Tokyo's domestic airport (the exception, for political rather than logistical reasons, are flights to Taiwan), and until the opening of the new terminal on Sept. 27, was also its most chaotic one.
Measured in passengers moved every year, three of the world's busiest air routes -- Tokyo to Sapporo, Tokyo to Fukuoka and Tokyo to Osaka -- all pass through Haneda.
And the airport has long been so overwhelmed that almost all passengers move to their aircraft by bus, creating some of the aviation industry's most frequent tarmac traffic jams.

Prague: Lost Era
To the Editor: I returned to the United States from a weekend as a house guest in Prague on Sept. 26, the date Michael Chabon's article appeared.
Somehow the author's self-inflicted melancholy escaped me in Prague as I walked among the many buildings encased in scaffolding as the city dramatically revitalizes itself.
The writer's moroseness also evaded me on Saturday as my friends and I tried to decide whether to attend one of the three operas, or the philharmonic, or any one of the numerous concerts and recitals being performed that night in the gloriously Baroque churches the writer so dolefully dispatches.
After attending an enjoyable production of Bedrich Smetana's opera "Hubicka" ("The Kiss") at the National Theater, such melancholy continued to elude me at U Zelene Zaby (The Green Frog), an ancient wine bar where a group of 20 people at the next table celebrated the musical exploits of a young violinist in its company.

Neighborhood Report: Washington Heights; Homicide Rate Falls by 27 Percent
The number of slayings in the 34th Precinct, long among the most murderous in the city, has dropped sharply so far this year, according to police statistics.
But the experts disagree on just how to interpret the new figures.
Slayings in the precinct, which covers Washington Heights and Inwood, were down by 27 percent through the end of September from last year at the same time, to 51 from 70.
The 1992 total, 98, also represented a drop from the precinct's all-time high, 119 in 1991.
The number had risen steadily from 1987 to 1991.

Neighborhood Report: Tribecca; When a Hotel Is Half Historic
A proposal to build a 34-floor hotel tower and attach it to a warehouse in a historic district is being hailed by some as an ideal marriage of opposites.
Others denounce the plan as a monstrous urban misfit.
Hearings at the Landmarks Preservation Commission last week and at Community Board 1 the week before drew clashing testimony on the proposed Hudson Hotel and Conference Center, to be built on an empty lot at the northeast corner of West and Laight Streets.


SUNDAY, October 31, 1983; REINVENTING THE LAWN
The Clinton Presidency is making good use of the White House lawns.
The big event was the Yasir Arafat-Yitzhak Rabin handshake.
But there have been Easter egg rolls, news conferences (with forklifts loaded with Federal regulations), and even a convention of talk radio hosts who gathered to broadcast live from the North Lawn as they interviewed officials on health care.
This is probably the only lawn in America that would welcome talk show hosts en masse.
Some Presidents like the Rose Garden, some the Oval Office, some the lawn.
In the future, the Clinton Administration might consider other lawn uses: a few grazing longhorns to show sympathy with ranchers; a circus or two, to show sympathy with Congress, and some kind of Nafta festival, with hockey players and mariachi music.
But the best use of all would be to plant a big garden.


Neighborhood Report: Morrisania; An Officer's Eyes and Ears
This summer, Jeff King, a community police officer at the 42d Precinct in the South Bronx, was finally overwhelmed by his beat: nine square blocks of apartment buildings and cavernous housing projects too sprawling for one person to handle.
But he and his supervisors found a solution in a basement office of the precinct station house: a band of eager auxiliary officers who were more than happy to assist Officer King.


PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD: Red Hook; Dancing Along the Way
Red Hook Arts, a multimedia youth group, has teamed up with Dancing in the Streets, which specializes in site-specific performances, to create a production that stretches along several blocks of Red Hook.
The audience will meet at Pier 41 and walk through Red Hook as a Narratr relates the neighborhood's history, with stops at warehouses, the Trolley Museum and other spots for brief dance and music performances, some by local schoolchildren and the elderly.
The price will end with a play staged at the Beard Street pier.

Sports of The Times; Samaranch: Peace, Not Prizes
HIS face was a mask, the impassive stare of an accountant hired to certify the results of the Academy Awards.
Except that Juan Antonio Samaranch was not merely reading a slip of paper that announced whether Jack Nicholson or Paul Newman had won an Oscar.
Juan Antonio Samaranch was opening the sealed envelope of history.
Samaranch has been president of the International Olympic Committee since 1980.
He is the most important sports figure in the world, more than any slam-dunker, more than any airwave-blaster, even more important than any sneaker-maker.

QUEBEC BLOC SET FOR OTTAWA ROLE
Gilles Duceppe, a former labor organizer who won a seat in Parliament for the Bloc Quebecois, is now packing his bags for Ottawa along with 53 other Bloc victors -- teachers, lawyers, economists, small business operators, a baker -- to become the official opposition to Prime Minister-designate Jean Chretien's Liberals.
But Mr.
Duceppe, 46, who has now won two elections in the Laurier-Ste.-Marie working-class district here for the three-year-old party that is seeking Quebec's separation from Canada, insists that the Bloc will focus more on economics than ideology, at least over the near term.

Neighborhood Reports: Upper East Side; A Cheaper Express Bus Brings Protests
As the city sees it, the new, less expensive Harlem-to-Wall Street express bus along Fifth Avenue is an enhancement of existing express services, and people should be happy.
But Yorkville residents are complaining: they fear the new private service will threaten two public East Side lines to Wall Street.
Their concern is that the Transit Authority will close the York Avenue route to lower Manhattan for lack of passengers, forcing residents to walk to Fifth Avenue for the other bus.
