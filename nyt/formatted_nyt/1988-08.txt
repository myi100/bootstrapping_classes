Faltering Yanks Are Swept by Twins

So far, the aspirants do not appear prepared for the part.


GUIDEPOST: Finishing the Unfinished
LEAD: Summer auctions and country-furniture sales are yielding furniture that may have been stripped of its finish or sold in its natural state.
All such furniture needs some kind of protective coating.

If the wood is attractive, a clear finish may be all that is needed.

UAL to Retain Covia Proceeds
LEAD: The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, said that it would retain the $500 million gained from the sale of a 50 percent interest in the Covia Corporation, which operates the airlines' computer reservation system.

Food Vendors Return to Midtown Manhattan
LEAD: Banned from the streets by Mayor Koch since July 11th, vendors were welcomed back yesterday by pedestrians on Avenue of the Americas with handshakes, backslaps and hungry stomachs.

All that companies like the Federal Record Service Corporation do is charge you for something you can do yourself -faster and for nothing.

Governor Nobody-Asked-Me
LEAD: What a pinched, technical definition of a governor's responsibility Mario Cuomo now offers regarding the ugly battle between a Federal judge and public officials in Yonkers.
Why hasn't he played a more active role?
Because ''Nobody asked me to.'' Why hasn't he spoken up in support of Judge Leonard Sand?


Treasury Years, Even With Missteps, Expanded His Role Beyond Politics
LEAD: On a wall leading from the back door of his office to his private dining room at the Treasury, James A. Baker 3d has hung scores of photographs, letters and other mementos of a career in three Republican administrations.

Review/Theater; Talk and Action by Cultural Provocateurs
LEAD: If one had to choose a single word to characterize the respective styles of Frank Maya, Allen Ginsberg, Paul Krassner and Karen Finley, the four speakers who shared the stage at Alice Tully Hall on Tuesday evening, one might call them manic, devotional, cheeky and hysterical.


Blueberries: Beyond Just Cream
LEAD: YOU know it's summer when there are blueberries with the cereal in the morning.
The berries are also delicious, as any child knows, in pies and tarts - and are particularly good for homemade ice cream.


Soda from SoNo angers SoHo
LEAD: SAYING he believed that a hometown soft drink would help promote South Norwalk, where his parents own a deli, Ray Contone created SoNo Seaport Soda, which uses a common shortening for the area.

Question of the Week; Are the Red Sox In for Another Fall?
LEAD: For Red Sox fans, this year is different.
A lot of things are coming into place on the field, and the future, if anything, looks brighter than the present.
Remember, it was Lou Gorman, the Boston general manager, who initiated all those long-ago plans for a continuously strong Mets team.
PENELOPE PRUTSALIS  Cambridge, Mass.


Corporate Logos Spruce Themselves Up
LEAD: To the Editor:


NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Providence, R.I.; Amenities on The Waterfront
LEAD: Ground will be broken this week for a $40 million condominium project that will rise here on the site of a former junkyard and nightclub in the Old Harbor District.


Correction
LEAD: An article in this section last Sunday about the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta incorrectly described Alain Locke.
He was the first black American Rhodes scholar.


Drunken Driving: A Lesson Learned?
LEAD: If experience is the best teacher, then Marc N. Turk didn't learn a great deal from his tragic automobile incident  [ ''The Dream That Fell to Earth,'' July 31 ] .


Cynthia Hall Wed To R. M. Domine
LEAD: At the First Presbyterian Church in New York, Cynthia Chesebrough Hall, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Goran L. Hall of Demarest, N.J., and Robert Michael Domine, a son of Annie N. Domine of Durand, Mich., were married yesterday by the Rev.
John B. Macnab.

LEAD: Barrie Dowdeswell, general manager of the Royal Victoria Infirmary here, stands at the front line of Britain's troubled National Health Service, once viewed as a world model of a successful national medical service.


A Cast of Hundreds In Nonstop Action
LEAD: AN event scheduled for the first half of April, 1989 will have many unusual features, and may rate a mention in the ''Guinness Book of World Records.'' It is the Marathon Bridge Battle of the Sexes to be played in New York and Paris with celebrity, charity and sponsor involvement.


All Aboard for the Queen of India's Railroads
LEAD: Six mornings a week, at 9 A.M., the Rajdhani Express, queen of India's vast railroad network and its only fully air-conditioned train, eases into the New Delhi railroad station from Bombay.
It is rarely late.
But the plushness of this flagship -with tinted windows, uniformed room attendants, six-course meals, special linen for the wide and soft bunk beds and even showers in the bathrooms of the first-class coaches - is in vivid contrast to the overcrowded and dirty trains that are more common in India.


The Right Track on Nicaragua
LEAD: Senate Democrats have stumbled onto a good policy on the vexatious matter of contra aid.
Their approach is to provide further food, medicine and clothing to the Nicaraguan rebels but to keep military aid in the far background.
This tack prevents collapse of the contras and maintains the basis for negotiations.


Political Marketing; TV's New Age of Thrust and Parry
LEAD: The Republican Party struck first with a roundhouse pounding: a two-and-a-half-week, 50-state campaign on network, cable and local television costing $4 million.


Ottawa Delights in a Dazzling New Museum
LEAD: Seeing the sprawling new national Gallery here makes it hard not to wonder if there are not two Moshe Safdies.
For there is a world of difference between this building, which is the architect's latest completed work, and the tower he recently designed for Columbus Circle in New York.
The massive, angular New York tower, which was not built (it has now been replaced by a different design by another architect), looked as if it would have been a harsh and overpowering presence.


A Room With a Golden View
LEAD: MICHELLE Diamono, a junior at California University in Pennsylvania, doesn't have to worry about her roommate blasting rock music and keeping her awake throughout the night.
It's more likely her roommate will spend leisure hours telling stories about life during the World Wars and the Great Depression.


ENGLISHWOMEN MAKE AN IMPACT AS DIRECTORS
LEAD: Women directors are in the ascendancy at Stratford this season.
Last year, Deborah Warner made her Royal Shakespeare Company debut with her stunning production of ''Titus Andronicus'' (starring Brian Cox).
That production has since moved to the small Pit theater in the company's London home, the Barbican.


The Welfare Web
LEAD: To the Editor:


Notes From a Train Whistle: The Lonesome Blues in the Night
LEAD: LATE at night, television off, family asleep, streets empty, I hear the lonely wail of a train whistle in the distance.
That sound, poets and writers tell me, is supposed to awaken in me a longing for romance, adventure and far away places.
But as the grade crossings are eliminated, no matter what the images, even the whistle of the L.I.R.R.


Cyndra Harvey To Marry Oct. 1
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Wayne Harvey of New Martinsville, W. Va., have announced the engagement of their daughter Cyndra Lynn Harvey to Alan Sterling Van Clief, a son of Mrs.

LEAD: The Social Security Administration said it was inundated with telephone calls Friday after announcing it was offering free, individualized estimates of future benefits to workers of all ages.
The agency's chief said she was adding 100 phone lines to handle the demand.


Review/Music; Hager, Toradze And Mintz
LEAD: Friday's Mostly Mozart program at Avery Fisher Hall provided the first hint that anybody in the concert business here is aware of - or cares about - the 200th anniversary of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's death in December.
He was an immense force in 18th-century music, though largely ignored today, and the concert by the festival's orchestra under Leopold Hager began with the E-flat Symphony, one of four powerful works in this format written in the mid-1770's.


AFTER THE KILLING FIELDS
LEAD: Your article made it clear that more needs to be done for the refugees and displaced persons living in border encampments along the Thai-Kampuchean border.


ASPEN
LEAD: In summer Aspen's intellectual aspirations are as lofty as the surrounding Rockies.
At this time of year the town's reputation as a glitzy ski resort is temporarily eclipsed by its image as a cultural center.

Phoenix Pressents A Mix of Satire and Vaudeville
LEAD: ''Cream pies and existentialist philosophy'' is how ''Voidville'' has been described by its director, Michael Patrick King.
He also calls it ''vaudeville for the 80's.'' But the revue is at its best when it settles for simply being a satirical revue and drops the pretentious act of mixing ''Sugar Babies'' with Kierkegaard.


Rachel Love Has Wedding
LEAD: Rachel Cornelia Love, a daughter of James Spencer Love and Mrs.
George I. Reynolds, both of Greenwich, Conn., was married there yesterday to Per Arne Lorentzen Jr., a son of Mrs.

LEAD:  OUT ON THE MARSH  By David Updike.  168 pp. Boston: David R. Godine. $16.95.


PRIDE OF THE PAST
LEAD: THIS WAS THE UGLIEST HOUSE IN THE neighborhood: a dark-brown elephant with asbestos siding.
But to interior designer Kevin Walz and his wife, Barbra, a photographer, this was also a house with hidden charms.
Not only was the property inviting, there were also porches on four sides, a series of untouched and well-proportioned main rooms on the ground floor, eight bedrooms upstairs and quirky Victorian details.


The Producer as Musician
LEAD: XYZ, a singer, steps out on stage in a music video.
He starts a slow, graceful dance, surrounded by women.
Dressed in a black hat, leather pants and silver studs, it's obvious that he's trying to build an image, however banal.
The music, with a bass line that courses like a river, fits the image.
He starts singing, and that too fits.


Practical Traveler; Getting Help Abroad For Credit Card Problems
LEAD: When Judith and Paul Haskins of New York vacationed on the island of Hawaii last month, they used a Gold MasterCard to charge their Budget rental car and their accommodations at Volcano House.

QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Next Week; Should Sugar Ray Leonard Box Again?
LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.

We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


Europe Wary of Greece's Anti-Terrorism Role
LEAD: Greece's assumption of the rotating presidency of the European Community may set back promising efforts by Western Europe and the United States to coordinate anti-terrorist policies, in the view of well-placed British, French and West German officials.


LEARNING TO WRITE CAN BE FUN
LEAD: Hollins College, a small, 150-year-old women's college nestled in a quiet valley in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, seems at first glance an unlikely literary center.
Though respected in higher education circles, Hollins is not widely known outside the South; many of those who have heard of it tend to dismiss it as a tony finishing school for the daughters of Sun


THE WORLD: Q &amp; A: John N. Turner; Canada's Liberals Battle the Trade Pact
LEAD: CANADA'S opposition Liberal Party announced last month that its majority in the upper house of Parliament would block the legislation necessary to implement a free-trade agreement that Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative, had negotiated with the United States.


RED IS RIGHT NOW
LEAD: THEY MAY BE SWEET strawberry blondes or deep coppery redheads, blondes streaked with bits of rose or brunettes spun with auburn, but red is the captivating hair color of the moment.
A year ago, blond was the color of choice.
This summer, those who were born red are flaunting it, and those who were not are giving nature a nudge.


IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: Years in Court; Bhopal Suit Marches On, In Circles
LEAD: SOON after toxic gas escaped from the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal in 1984, experts predicted that it could take years to untangle the lawsuits surrounding the worst industrial accident in history.

Life Patents: Doubts Are Registering
LEAD: THE House Judiciary Committee struck a compromise between farmers and the biotechnology industry last week when it decided that, in most instances, new forms of animals can be treated like mechanical inventions and patented.
In deciding that farmers should be exempted from paying royalties on the offspring of the patented livestock they buy, and in specifically stating that humans should not be patented, the committee sent a strong signal that cultural, moral and ethical considerations are important factors in drawing up legislation to regulate new biological technologies.


Q And A
LEAD:  Down Under  Question: My wife and I are planning to ship our motorcycle to Australia and tour there and in New Zealand.

Healthful Cruise on a Hospital Barge
LEAD: As the barge glided along the Hudson River, 10-year-old Shawn Coleman lip-synched and danced to Michael Jackson's ''Bad'' on the upper deck.
Later, he would go to the lower deck - to get a dental checkup.


Sacrifice Snaps Tie As Yanks Keep Up
LEAD: Dave Righetti went to the mound with two out in the ninth inning and struck out Kent Hrbek for his 17th save as the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, 5-3, before 40,814 last night at the Stadium.


Question of the Week; Are the Red Sox In for Another Fall?
LEAD: The 1988 Sox are unique.
Unlike the squads of 1986 (curses on you, Bill Buckner), 1978 (blast you, Mike Torrez) and 1975 (shame on you, Larry Barnett), this year's version hasn't been in a position to choke.
The way they're playing, they might be, but that's O.K.
Their present position is an unexpected and highly pleasurable bonus.


Big Name on Campus
LEAD: THEIR NAMES leap off the pages of course catalogues.
Registering for their classes inspires the competitive, camping-out-on-the-ticket-line spirit usually reserved for a Bruce Springsteen concert.


Betting That New Designs Will Bring Bigger Sales
LEAD: IN the past, shopping center developers benefited from the nation's move to the suburbs and had their pick from among vast expanses of inexpensive land in new markets.

LEAD: A picture caption on July 10 about the Preston B. Bird and Mary Heinlein Tropical Fruit and Spice Park in Florida misidentified one fruit.
The fruit, fuzzy and oval-shaped, is mountain soursop.

It grows on a vine.

France

Finally at Etampes the bike racers took a break and allowed traffic to pass.

Question of the Week; Are the Red Sox In for Another Fall?

LEAD: When Admiral Perry sailed into Kurihama harbor in 1853, reopening Japan to active trade with the West, he unleashed an esthetic fusillade that was heard round the Western art world, loudest of all in its capital, the city of Paris.

FROM DRUGS, ALCOHOL, EMBEZELLING AND DEATH, A ROAD TO HAPPINESS
At the start of ''Clean and Sober,'' Daryl Poynter (Michael Keaton) finds himself at rock bottom: he wakes up with a bad hangover, heavy debts and a comatose stranger in his bed.
Daryl's alcohol and cocaine habits are the source of all this trouble, and they might have remained out of control indefinitely.
But when Daryl's date fails to wake up at all and his irregular bookkeeping practices are in danger of being discovered, he thinks it wise to stage a temporary retreat.
A chemical dependency center with a 21-day detoxification program sounds like just the place.
Daryl enters this rehabilitation center with the firm conviction that he does not have a problem.
The film, directed by Glenn Gordon Caron, works slowly, carefully and finally quite affectingly to trace the process whereby he discovers otherwise.
Though it covers only a monthlong period, ''Clean and Sober'' is so slow and deliberate, approaching its subject in such an intent, realistic manner, that it seems to have spanned several lifetimes.

Transactions
LEAD:  BASEBALL


Restaurants
LEAD: Three years ago, when Montrachet opened on one of those exasperating you-can't-get-there-from-here blocks in TriBeCa (just wait till your cabbie tries to find it), it was a gamble for a French restaurant with such lofty aspirations, something akin to Lutece relocating on Staten Island.
Montrachet's unpretentious style, excellent Provencal food and modest prices soon lured legions of normally unadventurous uptown diners into this alien Z


Expos Making Their Move
LEAD: ''Beat the Mets?'' Buck Rodgers asked, sounding surprised at the question. ''I think so.
We've got the pitching now.
As good a defense as anybody, maybe the best in the big leagues.
Our hitters are coming around.
And we can run.'' He paused for effect, and added: ''We'll be there.'' After three months of skidding, three months of bragging about Andres Galarraga and little else, the Expos are recast and revived, and they are making a remarkable turnaround with runaway speed on the bases.


A HOT ISSUE: THE CHURCH THAT WASN'T
LEAD: At the end of a sun-washed Wall Street, as depicted in the newly issued New York statehood stamp, the spire of Trinity Church rises smartly over the city.
The scene is labeled simply ''July 26, 1788.'' That's the problem.
Anyone looking west on Wall Street on that date (when New York ratified the Constitution and joined the Union) would have seen - at most - the charred shell of the first Trinity Church, which burned in 1776 and remained in ruins during and after the Revolution.


Money Fund Assets Up
LEAD: Assets of the nation's 447 money market mutual funds increased $840.3 million, to $265.55 billion, for the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.

Assets of the 221 general-purpose funds were up $791.1 million, to $83.7 billion.

May 11: An Amnesty International report says Burmese Army units have killed and tortured members of ethnic minorities in defiance of Burmese and international law.

Best Products
LEAD: The New York-based Prospect Group Inc. has raised its stake in the Best Products Company to 9.9 percent, from 8.3 percent.

Brash Clubs or Haute Cuisine For Sultry Summer Nights
LEAD: IN this summer of discontent for so many restaurants and clubs, not all is gloom and thunder.
Sure, Il Palazzo has gone belly up.
Maxwell's Plum has succumbed.
Nobody talks about Nell's or Bice anymore, and there are empty banquettes at the Four Seasons and the Quilted Giraffe.
But the Darwinian struggle rages on, and, while the pace has slowed, the fickle populace still has an insatiable taste for adventure.


Review/Theater; Angelina Reaux Sings Weill at the Public

Review/Film; Hollywood's Youn Bloods in 'Youn Guns,' Tale of Outlawry
LEAD: The western ''Young Guns,'' which opens today at the Manhattan Twin and other theaters, is less like a real movie than an extended photo opportunity for its trendy young stars.

TOBACCO AND TRADE POLICY
LEAD: The fundamental flaw in your article ''Pushing Cigarettes Overseas'' (July 10) is Peter Schmeisser's inability to distinguish between health policy and trade policy.
Our trade policy is simple and straightforward.
We want the same market access and treatment for United States tobacco products that is afforded to the tobacco companies of the country in question.


Primary Questions On Coverage Of the Conventions
LEAD: The evolving nature of Presidential politics and the medium of television together have all but reduced party conventions to the level of the electoral college, which is to American politics what the vermiform appendix is to the human body.
The trend has progressed to the point that the only question now is whether the national conventions will vanish entirely or be recognized for what they have largely become: unpaid advertising on as much prime-time television as can be grabbed off in the name of public service.

Sports of The Times; Denny McLain, a Fallen Star, Tries Again
LEAD: The thought arose that Dennis Dale McLain was either the dumbest person in the world, the most naive person in the world, the craziest person in the world, the biggest jerk in the world, or the most hardheaded person in the world.


Evidence Aplenty That Walls Move
LEAD: Not only have I read your article  [ ''Stealing the Stone Walls of Westchester,'' June 12 ]  with quite a bit of interest, but I believe that you might want to send a professional photographer to our village here in Hastings.

Where Luminaries Let the Good Times Roll
LEAD: What follows is a portrait of New Orleans from the collective palette - and palate - of those whose personal or professional histories give them more than a passing familiarity with the city.
That the portrait has many features is not surprising, given the city's culture and history.
While some of those who were asked for their favorite New Orleans attractions mentioned well-touristed places, a few gave more private spots.


TALKING: Management; Buildings That Go It Alone

During a homily at a Mass at the Don Bosco Marian Shrine, the Cardinal said he had received many letters asking him to call for a boycott of the film, which portrays Christ as a man who questions his role on Earth.

GENERATIONS OF TORMENT

LEAD: WE all have our demons, our fears of the decline and fall of culture.
Mine sometimes takes the form of regretting that we don't read much poetry anymore.

Question Of the Week; Should Sugar Ray Leonard Box Again?
LEAD: I say no - a thousand times no.
He should not gamble and push his luck.

I have had three retina operations - back in 1933 - all unsuccessful and I have been blind in one eye all these years.
We didn't have laser in those days, but percentages are the same.

The Spare, Sure Line Of Matisse
LEAD: People think they know all about Henri Matisse, but most often they don't.
None of the great painter/sculptor/printmakers of the 20th century has more surprises to spring when a major retrospective comes along.
The most recent example of that is the unforgettable survey of his years in Nice that was put on at the National Gallery of Art in Washington by Jack Cowart and Dominique Fourcade in 1986.


WHAT HAYDN TAUGHT MOZART
LEAD: The relationship of Haydn and Mozart has been the subject of much comment, most of it (as far as 19th-century and 20th-century scholarship is concerned) of a slightly surprised nature, because Mozartians have always considered Haydn a second-rate composer.
But contemporary and near-contemporary documents and Mozart's own compositions make it clear that Mozart treated the elder composer and his music with loving attention.


Prospects; Cray's Fast New Machine
LEAD: Last Thursday, Cray Research Inc. announced the first sale of its new supercomputer, the Cray 3, to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, which gets much of its financing from the National Science Foundation.

Yanks' Turnaround Is All for the Worse

WHAT'S DOING IN: New Orleans
LEAD: New Orleans in August?
Why not?
The climate indoors is cool.
And outdoors the pace is leisurely.
For some New Orleanians, August has certain advantages, allowing plenty of excuses to relax in a leafy patio, schedule fewer appointments, lengthen the lunch hour and savor fine cooking.

TED KOPPEL'S EDGE
LEAD: TED KOPPEL HAS JUST surprised me - it's two hours to show time - by telling me he doesn't have a clue how he's going to start his program.
It's 9:30 P.M. on Thursday, June 30, in the ABC ''Nightline'' conference room in Washington.
Koppel and I, alone, are eating a typical ''Nightline'' dinner.
Last night it was pizza, tonight it's Chinese delivery.

Bookshelf
LEAD: Additional titles of interest:


Orientalisms Are Heard in Americans' MusicInfluence the Music of Americans Crystal.
LEAD: ''East is East,and West is West/And never the twain shall meet'' was one of Kipling's less accurate predictions, at least where music is concerned.
From Mozart's time to the present, superficial Orientalisms have lent local color to many a composition.
In the 20th century, and especially since World War II, matters have advanced far beyond this harmless form of musical tourism.


Centers Offer Alternative to Nursing Homes
LEAD: ADULT day-care centers are cheaper than a nursing center, offer more than a senior citizens' center and are growing in popularity in Connecticut, their advocates say.
While the centers allow many frail, elderly people who cannot care for themselves to live at home, they can also give the person who cares for an elderly person a welcome respite.


Further Tribulations of the Chicken From Kiev

Reviews/Music; All-Schubert Program Is Played at Mostly Mozart
LEAD: Making Schubert's chamber music understood in a space like Avery Fisher Hall is by necessity an inexact translation.
Vienna 160 years ago had opened its houses to music.
The age of the palace concert was over; that of the big concert hall was yet to begin.
Mostly Mozart's program of Schubert on Friday night, in other words, was comprised of music meant for home and friends, not the nearly 3,000 well air-conditioned New


PERIOD PIECES
LEAD: ALTHOUGH SHE ADMITS TO HAVING PERIODIC fantasies of living in rooms with gilt rococo mirrors and tufted bergeres, Barbara Jakobson, a New York art collector and design aficionado, says she is really ''firmly mired in the 20th century.'' At least a specific era from earlier in this century.
The rooms pictured here, for example, ''were designed to look as though you have just been ushered into the stateroom on the A deck of an ocean liner.

Lies Men Tell Put Women in Danger of AIDS
LEAD: The desire to make a good impression on a potential sexual partner leads so many men to lie about their sexual past and drug use that it is virtually pointless for women who are dating them to ask, a new study shows.


CRIME
LEAD: Douglas Kiker, the NBC News correspondent, demonstrated a deft hand as a mystery writer in ''Murder on Clam Pond'' almost two years ago.
He introduced a man named McFarland, an out-of-work, disillusioned journalist from Chicago who was holed up on Cape Cod.
Mac, as he is called, was confronted with a murder and solved it.


Question Of the Week; Should Sugar Ray Leonard Box Again?
LEAD: The Sugar man is already a boxing legend.
After an unbelievably successful career, the long layoff, and then coming back to take out another boxing great in Marvin Hagler, that should have been the climax of his career.
I think Ray Leonard should not jeopardize his health to prove what we already know.


At the Grocery, I Was the One Checked Out
LEAD: ''PUT it back, lady.'' The gruff voice startled me so badly that I dropped the two tomatoes I had selected.


U.S.-Greek Ties Look Unhappy but Unbreakable
LEAD: WHEN Greeks and others debate the American military presence here, the talk turns generally on a blend of high drama and deep passion, political theater and diplomatic machismo.
The negotiations currently under way on the future of the United States' four main bases and a string of lesser military installations have mixed in another ingredient: a cynical belief that, whatever public figures may say in public, in private the deal is as good as done.


From Coast to Coast, Urban Rail Is Flourishing

Why Market Technicians Are Confused
LEAD: Investors who try to predict the stock market's direction by studying such fundamentals as corporate earnings and interest rates are not alone in their current confusion.
Technicians, analysts who instead scrutinize the market's inner workings, also have wildly different forecasts.


GENERATIONS OF TORMENT
LEAD: Coverage by the press of events in Northern Ireland has produced an unintended, and unwelcome, consequence for British authorities - the awakening of conscience among Americans of Irish descent.
Non-jury trials, detention without cause, mistreatment of prisoners, official cover-ups and sanctioning of police and military brutality are but some of the more recent examples of an atavistic Whitehall meanness toward the Irish people that are provoking anger among normally passive Irish-Americans.


In Amsterdam, 300 Years Of Jewish Life
LEAD: The red brick building crowned with a crystal dome, its shell gable characteristic of Dutch classic style, carries a single clue to its past as a house of worship.
Two lines from the Psalms, inscribed in Hebrew letters, flank the Ionic columns of the main doorway on the Jonas Daniel Meijerplein.


Taking Thrifty Cues From the Swiss
LEAD: When a Saudi princess checked into a lakefront hotel in Geneva some time ago she asked the management to distribute $15,000 among the staff.

The couple plan to marry Nov.


A Drive in the Country And a Bonus Concert
LEAD: IF the warm weather has brought out any wanderlust, consider a pleasant country drive that can yield the bonus of a concert.

Wanted: A Watchman Of the Waterways
LEAD: WHEN the first European settlers arrived in lower Westchester in the 17th century, they had to have been impressed with the opportunities they found.

New 'Scandal' Reopens Old British Wounds
LEAD: They met in 1960 at a SoHo nightclub.
She was an exquisite 16-year-old showgirl in feathers and sequins who sat laughing with customers between acts.
He was a well-known osteopath to politicians and movie stars, the 46-year-old son of a clergyman, whose fondness for young women was rivaled only by his somewhat pathetic yearning to ingratiate himself with the British

Advocates of starting children in school at the age of 4 are joined by two powerful allies, Senator Ted Kennedy and Governor Cuomo.


Voters Reject Gambling
LEAD: A referendum today showed continued strong opposition to return gambling to this island where casinos once flourished.

Saving the Trellis: A Roslyn Landmark
LEAD: The organization which has funded the restoration of the Milliken-Bevin Trellis at the Nassau County Fine Arts Museum in Roslyn (more accurately Roslyn Harbor) is the Roslyn Landmark Society, not the Roslyn Historical Society.
There is not, and so far as we know, never has been, a Roslyn Historical Society, but this by no means indicates a lack of interest in local history in Roslyn.


Exit for Soviet Jews, Conflict for Americans
LEAD: THE Israeli Cabinet's approval of a new emigration policy that would effectively require most Jews who leave the Soviet Union to go to Israel has created a dilemma for many American Jews, who want to help Israel but who also say that Soviet Jews should be able to choose where they want to live.


Question Of the Week; Should Sugar Ray Leonard Box Again?
LEAD: It isn't a question of Leonard boxing again that's at issue here.
It's about money.
Leonard is a box-office gold mine, the greatest entertainer the sport of boxing has seen.
In the end, I will be surprised to see Donny Lalonde come away with a victory.
Not because of Ray's efforts inside the ring, but because of his importance outside of the ring.


That Was the Mexican Revolution That Was . . . or Was It?
LEAD: When Cuauhtemoc Cardenas broke with Mexico's ruling party to run for President in last month's election, he quickly became a nonperson as far as the political establishment was concerned.

Question Of the Week; Should Sugar Ray Leonard Box Again?
LEAD: Sugar Ray is still physically able to fight in the professional ranks - albeit a weight class higher than he's used to.

So let him box.
Pay him whatever the market will bear.

Robinson Is Disappointing
LEAD: For more than half the game Friday night, David Robinson was anchored at the Olympic bench as college forwards like Danny Manning and a high school all-America, Alonzo Mourning, filled in at center.
A dominating big man would alleviate many of the concerns that John Thompson has about the United States basketball team he will take to Seoul, South Korea, for the Summer Games next month, but thus far,

Antebellum Grandeur by the River

Blasphemy or Artistry?
LEAD: Christians may disagree with some aspects of Martin Scorsese's challenging new film, ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' but if they understand their own tradition they will not argue with his presentation of Jesus as attracted to marriage.
They will argue rather that such an attraction is not a temptation at all.


Artists Joining Against Factory School of Painting
LEAD: In this summer resort town, home of one of the nation's oldest art colonies, you can buy an original painting by Michael Stoffa for about $500.

She is tied with Grace Jackson, a sprinter from Jamaica, and Petra Felke, an East German javelin thrower, both of whom did not compete in


Caveat Emptor
LEAD: AUTOMATIC focusing has become so much a part of the photography scene that it's easy to take for granted.
Certainly no self-respecting camera buff would admit to ignorance of the subject.
But for many people facing the prospect of buying a modern camera for the first time, the entire notion remains mysterious.


When an Address Is Lost, Try a Map to Guide the Way

DANCE VIEW
LEAD: Forget the costumes.
The garish new costumes that Christian Lacroix designed this season for American Ballet Theater's revival of ''Gaite Parisienne'' may have caused gasps.

Reviews/Music; Incense and Love Songs In Bryan Ferry Concert
LEAD: Love is all-consuming in Bryan Ferry's songs; it's a raw need like drug addiction, a spiritual sacrament, a paradise and an eerie limbo.

A Woman's Miniskirt, A Man's Attitude
LEAD: I was offended by Edson Atwood's article, ''Ban the Miniskirt, Please'' (Opinion page, July 10) because of his blatant sexism and presumptuous attitude.
Mr.
Atwood is mistaken in thinking that this reader is interested in his uncontrollable voyeurism and his dictatorial tendencies.


Some Cool Recipes for a Hot Summer

Fresh ingredients such as tomatoes, peppers, herbs and peaches are abundant in the markets now.
Combined with fresh fish, the menu is appropriately light yet satisfying, low in fat and attractive.

Extending FM's Reach
LEAD: The pot of gold, as we know, is at the rainbow's end, and the trick is to reach it.
That's the situation in which many FM listeners find themselves, trying to reach stations at the far end of the sky.

By Martin Mayer. (Norton, $18.95.) The tremors that shook world financial markets last October have been closely scrutinized, yet thus far the reams of reports have done little to reassure anxious investors.

LEAD: THE ADVENTURES OF TELEMACHUS.
By Louis Aragon.
Translated by Renee Riese Hubert and Judd D. Hubert. (University of Nebraska, $18.95.) Published in 1922, Louis Aragon's novel ''The Adventures of Telemachus'' occupies a pivotal position in which Dadaism and Surrealism overlap.
A subversive Dadaist impulse certainly figured in Aragon's choice of Francois Fenelon's 17th-century prose epic ''Aventures de Telemaque'' for a parodic model, since Fenelon's earnestly moralistic retelling of Homer and Virgil provided a target rich in literary reference and high-mindedness.

A Holiday With Pickax And Shovel
LEAD: A FULL coffee pot, crusted with pitch-black soot, was brewing over red-hot coals.
Nearby the Taylor River gushed past boulders midstream in its steep path down the mountain.

China Steps Into Modern Dance, Warily
LEAD: At first glance, the ballet barre appears to be made of wood, but upon closer examination, it turns out to be of cast iron.
This is a no-frills dance studio.
Functional to be sure; yet, by American standards, drab, cramped, cold and dimly lighted.
Like almost everything else in China, it exudes an aura of hardship, stoically endured.

Coe Loses Again
LEAD: When Juan Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee, learned that Sebastian Coe, the 31-year-old British middle-distance champion, had failed to qualify for the 1988 Games, he was dismayed.
After all, as Samaranch told The Guardian of London, ''Sebastian Coe is a great Olympic champion, having won the 1,500-meters title twice and made many other contributions to the sport.


THE NEW FURS
LEAD: This season women are being offered a wide range of choice in all aspects of fashion - and fur coats are no exception.

THE WORLD: A Sense of Paranoia; What Zia's Death Means For Pakistan and the U.S.
LEAD: WHEN he seized power in 1977, Mohammad Zia ul-Haq was a relatively unknown general who was not given much chance of surviving long in the turmoil of Pakistan.

As Politburo Squabbles, a Less Timid Public Takes Sides

POSTINGS: Conversion on East 66th Multiple Choices

Only 22 apartments in the 202-unit building are for sale right now, but each is being offered with enough options to allow 1,000 combinations for the mathematically inclined and the choosy.
While an option package is as common in new construction as in new cars, it is unusual in the conversion of older buildings.


JERSEYANA
LEAD: THE Adamses, the Kennedys, the Rockefellers, the Fords: these are among the family dynasties that have provided America with generations of leaders in politics, industry and philanthropy.
There is one family dynasty, however, that comes from the bottom of the pile.


Taping Between Drywall Panels
LEAD: ALTHOUGH gypsum wallboard, more often called drywall, is much easier to apply than plaster, one part of the process is a common stumbling block: sealing the seams between panels with drywall tape.
This is a crucial step in finishing a surface, because if done poorly the taped seams are difficult to disguise by sanding and painting.


Living Life By the Rules of the Book
LEAD: My parents live life by the good book.
Not the Bible, mind you, but the Entertainment Book.

Ranging from 710 to 1,030 square feet, the one-bedroom town houses have one or two levels or one level and a loft, and all have one-car garages.


Can Bush as Bush Steal the Show?
LEAD: The biggest question about the four-day television show sponsored by the Republican Party in New Orleans - ''All in the Family Ties'' - was whether it was going to be a continuing series or a one-shot pilot constituting an unsuccessful screen test for George Bush.


Books: More Than Just a Good Read
LEAD: I HAVE a passion for books.
Being one of those people who can't go to sleep at night without reading ''just a few pages,'' my sorely needed eight hours of sleep is frequently reduced to six.

Suits: Pairing Off
LEAD: IT'S NO SECRET TO THE SARTORIALLY hip that a suit can be more than the sum of its parts - the jacket serving as a sport coat now and then, the pants doubling as odd trousers.
Mixing it up, some peole believe, can lend a wardrobe variety and punch.


Headliners; Diver's Trials
LEAD: Some people drove from Florida to Indiana last week to watch Bruce Kimball try out for the Olympic diving team.
They were not rooting for him.
Earlier this month, Mr.

The police said Mr.
Kimball, who won a silver medal in the 1984 Olympics, was drunk.

LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD: HERITAGE FESTIVAL  The folks at the Huntington Historical Society must be doing something right; they've been doing it for 25 years now, the ''it'' being the annual Heritage Festival.
And today's the day for the special 25th anniversary edition of the festival.
From 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. the Heckscher Ballfield, off 25A, will be alive with activities that take in the entire family: ice cream making and weaving for small fry; more than 100 antique and knickknack dealers for browsers and collectors; a new project, ''Count Me In!

A Musical About Brel and Blues
LEAD: WHEREAS the 20-year-old Jacques Brel musical with the unwieldy title hammered away at its themes through songs, dispensing with a standard ''book,'' the new Brel musical at the John Drew Theater in East Hampton through Saturday - ''Jacques Brel Blues,'' it is called - talks itself into oblivion.


POSTINGS: Garment District Remake Design Showplace
LEAD: The four corner buildings at Broadway and 39th Street once were centers for textile merchants who served the Garment District.

The Winner in the Straw Vote
LEAD: Think of straw hats as romantic reminders of earlier, easier times.
Or think of them as portable shade, which these days can qualify as a priceless commodity.
Better still, don't think of them at all; just sit back and enjoy their grace and beauty, the sweep of those wide brims decorated with flowers or ribbons like something from a Degas or a Renoir.


Correction
LEAD: An article about Leonard Bernstein on page 1 of the Arts and Leisure section today gives an incorrect time for part of the Tanglewood gala honoring him.
The final program, which he will conduct, is scheduled for next Sunday at 2:30 P.M., not in the evening.


Full Life, Empty Values
LEAD: I HAVE never met Barbara Klaus, but I admire her ability to maintain a sense of humor about life on Long Island.

Unmasking the Frailties of Stone and Steel
LEAD: The Gothic Cathedral of Chartres, 40 miles southwest of Paris, stretches nearly an eighth of a mile from western doors to eastern apse.

Even Newark Is Afraid Of Go-Go Development
LEAD: NEWARK passed a turning point last year when it tore down four public housing high-rises.
What it was turning toward, however, is still a matter of debate.


Mariners Win a Laugher From Yankees
LEAD: The Mariners looked at the lineup the Yankees sent to their clubhouse last night and laughed.
Claudell Washington was listed at first base, Don Mattingly as the right fielder and Ken Phelps as the left fielder.
It all turned out to be a mistake, though, and eventually a corrected lineup was relayed to the clubhouse.


LOVE WITH ITS TROUSERS ROLLED
LEAD: ''Love reciprocated is always rejuvenating,'' T. S. Eliot said in 1958. ''Before my marriage I was getting older.
Now I feel younger at seventy than I did at sixty. . . .
An experience like mine makes all the more difference because of its contrast with the past.''


WILL THE STEALTH BOMBER WORK?
LEAD: Malcolm W. Browne's revealing report ''Will the Stealth Bomber Work?'' (July 17), about the Pentagon's latest boondoggle, is another example of how the pockets of tired United States taxpayers are bring picked clean by fast-talking military contractors.

LEAD: EVERY SUMMER, it's the same question.
Will I get up the courage and ambition to swim in the Atlantic Ocean or won't I?


Ideas for Tomatoes, Even Green Ones
LEAD: AT last, real tomatoes are back.
Though fancy shops have taken to stocking them all winter long, tomatoes from hydroponic farms in Israel and the Netherlands never taste like the sun-ripened ones from your garden or the farm down the road.
As for those pale pink numbers from Florida, we won't even discuss them.


A Recital That Altered A Life
LEAD: ''OH, darling, just a little music for Grandma and Grandpa.
Please?
You'll just love it, Mother; she plays like a little angel!'' How many times have we shown off the accomplishments of our children to captive audiences in our home, deriving tremendous personal satisfaction from the child prodigy among us?


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Leasing by Foreign Companies; Banks Create a Bright Spot in a Sluggish Market

Parks System is Celebrated
LEAD: IT began 75 years ago with a modest state appropriation, and a year later five acres of Westport salt marsh was bought as the first piece of a statewide mosaic of greenery and open space.
The state's parks system is now three-quarters of a century old, and some of the parks' best friends are celebrating.


Trade Deficit Takes Turn for the Worse
LEAD: The trade deficit worsened in June, coming in at $12.5 billion, the largest since February.
Imports in June rose 5.7 percent, to $39.3 billion, and exports fell 2.4 percent, to $26.8 billion.
That was taken as a sign that the American economy, and its appetite for foreign goods, remains strong, perhaps strong enough to persuade the Fed that it must further tighten up on the money supply.


Correction

A map with the article misidentified the hill district; it is La Croix Rousse.


Prospects; Book Houses Consolidate

Once an industry made up of dozens of independent, family-run companies, book publishing is now dominated by six major companies: Advance Publications, Hearst, MCA, the Pearson Group, Bertlesmann A.G.


On Language; Let the Credits Roll
LEAD: PROBABLY NO industry imposes its strange argot on the public quite as carelessly as Hollywood does.
Those who want to understand the industry must learn about gaffers and juicers, key grips and wranglers, greensmen and gobos, inky dinks and skypans, not to mention focus pullers, Foley men and line producers.


North Hills Project Is Challenged
LEAD: THE fate of a proposed 98-unit condominium complex in North Hills is enmeshed in a protracted legal battle that has pitted three residents against the village's planning board in a dispute over the development of environmentally sensitive land.

Question Of the Week; Is the Gretzky Trade the Biggest Ever?
LEAD: The most professional athletic talent to switch teams as a result of a single trade has to be the trade of Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring from the New York (baseball) Giants for Rogers Hornsby of the St.

Inspiration on the Hudson
LEAD: FREDERIC EDWIN CHURCH had many virtues, but modesty was not one of them.
The Hudson River painter once wrote to a friend, ''About an hour this side of Albany is the Center of the World - I own it.'' He was referring to Olana, the grand, sybaritic palace he built in the 1870's on a hilltop overlooking the Hudson


Inflation Reduced
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Inflation Redux'' (Prospects, July 31) evidently could not quote an economist of the disinflationary bent.

Question Of the Week; Is the Gretzky Trade the Biggest Ever?

Woody Plants for Summer Blossoms
LEAD: THE recent hot spell delayed lawn work especially seeding or sodding of new lawns; since cooler growing weather is coming next month, major lawn work can now be organized; for established lawns continue setting mowers to cut high - at least two inches - to encourage deep root growth.
If they have finished blooming, dig carefully, divide roots and replant day lilies, phlox, astilbes and other spring-blooming perennials.

Reviews/Music; Chicago Group in Premiere of Mozart Scoring
LEAD: If the string quartet and the orchestra had largely aristocratic ties in Mozart's day, the wind band was a more populist and adaptable ensemble, as much at home in a parade or a concert in the town square as in a more intimate salon performance.
The Chicago Symphony Winds have been specializing in this literature for a decade, and at a Mostly Mozart concert at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday evening the group and a half-dozen guest singers and players presented an ample selection of Mozart's music for variously configured wind ensembles.

The Banks Are in Big Trouble, Too
LEAD: THE sad plight of the savings industry has recently become front-page news.

LEAD:  Democracies of Desire


Taping Between Drywall Panels
LEAD: ALTHOUGH gypsum wallboard, more often called drywall, is much easier to apply than plaster, one part of the process is a common stumbling block: sealing the seams between panels with drywall tape.
This is a crucial step in finishing a surface, because if done poorly the taped seams are difficult to disguise by sanding and painting.


College Denied Liquor License
LEAD: The Boston Licensing Board Thursday rejected Boston College's petition for a license to serve alcohol at its Alumni Stadium football field and in the Silvio O. Conte Arena.

''For these final two concerts in our August 'Listen 'n' Lunch' series,'' said Connie Cullen, the administrator of St.


THE NATION: Pro &amp; Con: Do the Poor Benefit?; What a Minimum Wage Does to the Economy
LEAD: SINCE 1938, when the Government required employers to pay their workers at least 25 cents an hour, periodic challenges to the New Deal idea of a statutory minimum wage - which now stands at $3.35 an hour - have rarely amounted to more than academic exercises.
This year, things could be different.
Committees in the House and Senate have cleared legislation that would raise the minimum for the first time since 1981.


At 74, a (Movie) Star Is Born
LEAD: Talk of success in America and what do you mean?
Take Reizl Bozyk, who never performed a word in English - well, maybe a few here and there - during 60 years in Yiddish theater, suddenly catapulted to a top role in the new movie ''Crossing Delancey,'' opening Wednesday at the Plaza.
Don't 60 years of top billing in Yiddish, which some heartless ones believe is headed the way of silent films, also represent success, particularly when they were spent in entertaining


Premature Praise?
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Computer As Carry-On Bag
LEAD: COMPUTERS you can take with you - variously called notebooks, laptops and portables, depending on size, features and marketing strategies - are enjoying a boom in sales.
Although they can serve just as space savers on a cramped office or home desk, since they usually take up less room than conventional desktop machines and can easily be packed away when they're not needed, presumably most portables are bought to be taken along on business or vacation trips.


Redeemer of Cans Gets a Reprieve
LEAD: IN April, the end seemed near for We Can, a nonprofit can and bottle redemption center for homeless and poor people.
It was about to be forced out of a vacant lot on West 43d Street to make room for high-rise condominiums, and it had nowhere to go.


Dull Disks
LEAD: To the Editor:


Question Of the Week; Is the Gretzky Trade the Biggest Ever?
LEAD: Yes, Wayne Gretzky has dominated hockey more than anyone has dominated a major sport in history.
That alone makes the Gretzky trade the biggest ever.
The trade has also made at least 10 more teams Stanley Cup contenders.
The Oilers traded away their favorite son and their competitive edge.
ANTHONY C.


Two Directors Put Their Stamp On Their Dreams
LEAD: Back in 1974, Francis Ford Coppola was already mentioning the auto-industry maverick Preston Tucker as a future film subject.
And Martin Scorsese had been given a copy of Nikos Kazantzakis's ''Last Temptation of Christ'' while making ''Boxcar Bertha,'' which was released in 1972.
When a project hangs over a film maker's career for a decade and a half, how can it fail to become a monumental albatross?


Dina Eve Caplan, Lawyer, to Marry
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Florence Caplan of White Plains of the engagement of her daughter Dina Eve Caplan to John Peter Spyros Sarbanes, a son of Senator and Mrs.
Paul Sarbanes of Baltimore.


Don't Shoot Your Kids Indiscriminately
LEAD: ''When you were little. . . ,'' parents would say to their children; and then they would relate what the children had been too young to remember.
Most of us learned about our early lives that way, and our self-images derive at least partly from these parallel accounts.


GOING ON IN THE NORTHEAST
LEAD:  GREEK ICONS


Boxer, 22, Is Dead From Ring Injury
LEAD: A 22-year-old Los Angeles boxer died in a hospital today, a day after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage while being knocked out as he defended his state lightweight title.


INDIA'S SOUL FOOD
LEAD: TO AN INDIAN FAMILY, THE tandoori meal is not just food.
Like Sunday supper for some Americans, this meal is the high point of the week.
I remember gathering with my family and friends in cool breezes at an outdoor concert in New Delhi under tamarind and mango trees.
There, we would dig a pit to smoke, grill and roast chicken and meat.


Turmoil at the Elliman Co-op Brokerage
LEAD: THE last few weeks have brought the chaos of civil war to Douglas Elliman, a 77-year-old industry leader known for quiet integrity in the business of selling Manhattan co-ops and managing posh apartment buildings.

Quayle's enlistment.


Stately Home With a Trove From Egypt
LEAD: THE smoking room at Highclere Castle, about 60 miles west of London, looks pretty much as it has for years, with its large brown leather sofa and chairs.
The carved wooden fireplace, terra-cotta-colored walls and inlaid marble table under Canaletto paintings make a male retreat that must have seen many a bridge or gin rummy game.


Miss Casimir-Lambert Becomes Bride
LEAD: The marriage of Veronique Casimir-Lambert, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Pierre Casimir-Lambert of Geneva, to Frederick Harlan Batrus, a partner in Lazard Freres &amp; Company in New York, took place yesterday at St.

Edward Maloney, the president of the Fordham Preparatory School, performed the ceremony.


The Olympic Mind Games Begin
LEAD: The Olympic Games begin in less than a month.

A Consumer Activist Candidy Studies His Hometown
LEAD: When Ralph Nader was growing up in Winsted, he would go to City Hall to watch his neighbors debate local issues.

Still No Beef
LEAD: The last balloon has been swept from the Superdome, the last hangover attended to, the last rhetorical cannon spiked.
With a gavel's bang Thursday night, the long and largely unedifying process by which America selects its Presidential candidates came to a merciful end.
Two candidates survive, one to be chosen.


No. 1 Target: Florida State
LEAD: Coach Bobby Bowden of Florida State said he would rather be top-ranked at season's end than at the beginning, but yesterday, he gladly accepted his team's first No. 1 ranking in The Associated Press's preseason college football poll.

IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: Beyond the Droughts; The Green Revolution: How Much Farther Can It Go?
LEAD: BY the end of the fall harvest, world grain supplies could be the tightest since World War II.
While the Department of Agriculture says there is little danger that the world will run out of food, some experts outside the Government insist that the extent of the damage is being seriously understated.


Ideas for Tomatoes, Even Green Ones
LEAD: AT last, real tomatoes are back.
Though fancy shops have taken to stocking them all winter long, tomatoes from hydroponic farms in Israel and the Netherlands never taste like the sun-ripened ones from your garden or the farm down the road.
As for those pale pink numbers from Florida, we won't even discuss them.


WILL THE STEALTH BOMBER WORK?
LEAD: We are being told we need to spend $69 billion or more on an airplane whose mission begins after a nuclear exchange.
Who will benefit from this mission, even if successful - the Government officials and military personnel who will be safely tucked away in their shelters and silos?


Power and the Justice of the Peace
LEAD: JULY 20 was a historic day in the political careers of two Americans.
Michael S. Dukakis was selected by the Democratic National Convention to run for President, and in one of those monumental coincidences, I was chosen by the Hampton Democratic Caucus to be Justice of the Peace. (That's Hampton Connecticut with its 1,400 souls, not Hamden, not East Hampton, not even the Hamptons on Long Island.) What's that you say?

John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church.


Remember the Base-Closings Bill
LEAD: In a burst of good sense, the House voted overwhelmingly last month to let the Pentagon close redundant military bases.

Instead, it got caught up in politicking over President Reagan's veto of the defense authorization bill.

Where Bush Throws Weight Around
LEAD: The Kennedys played touch football, the Bushes pitch horseshoes.
And the Bushes do it with as much passion, vigor, and spirited competitiveness as that relatively mild sport allows.

Any novice who has tried to hang an iron shoe around the stake from the required distance - 30 feet for women, 40 feet for men - knows that.

Safety Remains Elusive at Morrell
LEAD: JUST after she took the job last summer, Carri Lee Miller knew it was a mistake.
Her hands would ache after every day at Morrell's meatpacking house here, where she sometimes had to make 1,900 cuts an hour on the hogs' heads that passed by her station.
At night, she would wake up in pain with her fingers clenched in a fist that she could not open alone.


Tuning In the Universe Sites
LEAD: THE RADIO TELESCOPE, WHICH makes pictures from the radio waves emitted by distant objects (as opposed to the optical telescope, which focuses on light waves) has been with us since World War II.
It has revealed previously undetected entities in the universe and, because radio waves are not distorted by the earth's atmosphere to the degree that light waves are, it has the potential to unveil the clearest possible images of astronomical phenomena.

THE MAN WHO BOUGHT BLOOMINGDALE'S
LEAD: I was interested in Robert Campeau's plan for Toronto, which, according to your article, failed.
I examined the picture of it, and I feel it deserved to fail.
It put up a Chinese wall before Toronto that would have shut off the city from any view of the lake front, which is now so beautiful and used heavily by the public.

Its name and menu say seafood.


Belgian City Of Romanesque Treasures
LEAD: ONE can easily imagine the awe experienced by pilgrims and travelers over the past thousand years as they approached Tournai in Belgium, an ancient center of religion, trade, politics and art.

THE SUBJECT WAS FASHION
LEAD: Being in fashion is one great feeling money can buy.
But most of us sense a real gulf, if not an existential chasm, between the price of beautiful clothes and the cost of their materials and labor.
Consider, for instance, a $300 evening dress by Victor Costa, which may be nearly a line-for-line copy of another designer dress costing $3,000.

Happy Birdsday, Roger
LEAD: For most of this century, birds and Roger Tory Peterson have enjoyed a kind of symbiotic relationship, each profiting by the other's company.

Drama vs. Noise at the Open
LEAD: In recent years, attention has focused on the negatives as many tennis players have come to view the United States Open as a necessary evil, such as visiting the dentist at least once a year.
There are the jets thundering overhead, trains rumbling nearby, boisterous crowds, scheduling quirks and sticky, late-summer New York City weather, all of which make the Open unique, but also the most disconcerting of the Grand Slam tournaments.

LEAD: THE three brick rowhouses at the southwest corner of 93d Street and Lexington Avenue, built in 1862, date from the time when Yorkville was still an independent village.


Silver After the Hunt Debacle
LEAD: IT is safe to say that the Hunt brothers of Dallas have never recovered from the collapse of the silver market in 1979 and 1980.
Neither has the metal.

Pop Passports - At a Price
LEAD: Not too long ago, I was sure that the best thing a band could carry was a foreign passport.

Russian History And the Yanks
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Of Tudor Thai and Swiss Siam
LEAD: THE large billboard first appeared about six months ago on Sukhumvit Road, one of Bangkok's major arteries, and advertised in glowing colors a new housing project.
This in itself was hardly unusual.
Such signs -enormous, handpainted and displaying a good deal of pop-art imagination (lakes and tranquil tree-lined streets supposedly available in the city center) - are just as common as the outsize movie billboards that once inspired a


Ashe Looks Back at a Year of Troubles and Triumph
LEAD: ARTHUR ASHE really did not have much of a choice in the matter.
Quiet, unassuming, almost bookish-looking in the horn-rimmed glasses he wore then, he was nonetheless cast as a symbol in the late 1960's, that often turbulent period of political and social change in this country.
Ashe was black and he was a tennis player, a combination that made many people uneasy in a sport in which everyone wore white.

Taormina
LEAD: To the Editor: Some years ago while vacationing in Taormina, Sicily, I suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized for 20 days there.

Review/Rock; Voice, Guitar and Soul By Robert Cray at Pier 84
LEAD: Restraint may be fine for diplomats and pitchers, but for musicians playing a long show to an audience in an uncomfortable place, it gets to be wearing.
Robert Cray, the genial singer and guitarist who performed Thursday night at Pier 84, may be the perfect symbol for the 1980's: not only is he restrained and utterly controlled - though not cold - but he's a revivalist as well, drawing on early soul to give his material passion.

Appearance Anxiety

CRIME
LEAD:  DEATH TAKES THE STAGE by Donald Ward (St. Martin's, $15.95) is an unusual first novel.
Hard to pin down, it is a combination of tragedy and a kind of comedy that often verges on farce.

FICTION

Here we have an aspiring humorist receiving instructions from the dead - in this case, P. G. Wodehouse.

There Are No 'Best,' Except. . .
LEAD: All sensible people with more than a casual interest in music hold these truths to be self-evident: There is no such thing as a best performance, and there is no such thing as a best performer.

The Rise in Rates Spreads to Europe
LEAD: Interest rates headed higher in Europe, led by West Germany's central bank.
The Bundesbank lifted its discount rate to 3.5 percent, from 3 percent, and similar increases were imposed in Britain, France, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Canada.
The German move was accompanied by strong words from Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, who said it was intended as an ''important signal'' to the world markets that Germany would act aggressively to curb further gains in the dollar's value.

The Presumed Uniqueness of Japan
LEAD: FIVE YEARS IN JAPAN HAVE LEFT me thinking a good deal about Bernstein, the scratchy-voiced business manager in the movie ''Citizen Kane.'' When a visitor speaks admiringly of a wealthy man, Bernstein waves him off. ''It's no trick to make a lot of money,'' he says, ''if all you want is to make a lot of money.


Washington Jail Crowding: Few Cells and Much Discord
LEAD: Some city officials refer to it as ''musical cells.'' But it is no game.

John Sayles Steps Up to Bat
LEAD: Trumpets and banjos playing Dixieland, athletes in baggy flannel uniforms, fleecy clouds and bright sunshine, and cigar smoke and grass and dirt so real you can smell them.


A Schoolboy Bully Looks Back, With Regret
LEAD: THE bully is a fact of school life which neither time nor circumstances has changed.
While the subjects, books, equipment and the students and teachers, themselves, change with the generations, bullies remain the same.
They are as old as Cain and Abel and they will continue to exist as long as some kids are big and mean and others are not prone to fight.

Shedding Weight
LEAD: THAT was undoubtedly William (Refrigerator) Perry who appeared on defense for the Chicago Bears in the team's preseason loss to the Los Angeles Rams Friday night, but for those who have followed the ups and downs of his career, it was clear this Refrigerator was minus a crisper or so.
Indeed, he was an eighth of a Perry lighter than he was last spring, when he tipped the scales at 377 pounds.

Leaders of the Pack
LEAD: JUST FLASHY PACKAGING, smoke and mirrors, glitz without substance - at least that's the skeptic's view of the cosmetics business.
But in reality, many more women are drawn to decorative makeup, skincare and fragrance packaging than are put off by it.
And it seems that packaging is becoming increasingly more elaborate.

LEAD: West German politicians have acknowledged a catalogue of errors that contributed to the deaths of two teen-age hostages in a 54-hour episode last week.

Paying Workers Extra to Be Their Own Efficiency Experts

LEAD: In the same St.
Peter's parish church where Art Rooney attended daily Mass and communion for decades, the funeral yesterday for the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers was attended by nearly 1,000 mourners: his five sons and their families, National Football League executives, former Steeler players, more than 60 members of the clergy, and hundreds of his friends.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My patio consists of a concrete base over which is a layer of pebbles.
The pebbles are cemented in place with epoxy and form a layer a little over 1 1/2 inches thick.

Review/Music; Bernstein Festivities Continue at Tanglewood
LEAD: Tanglewood's celebration of Leonard Bernstein's 70th birthday is lasting four days, starting with the actual birthday gala Thursday night.
Tonight's installment might have seemed oddly removed both from Mr.
Bernstein and from Tanglewood's public image.
But it was actually close to him, close to Tanglewood and of considerble musical interest.


Verbatim; Self-Blame
LEAD: 'The handling of the demonstration at Tompkins Square Park was not the New York City Police Department's finest hour. . . .
The pictures of officers striking demonstrators with their nightsticks erase the good will and praise the department earns every day for its good deeds and heroic actions. '

The Martial Arts as Moneymakers
LEAD: AS is traditional, next month's Olympics in South Korea will include a demonstration sport popular in the host country.

TRIUMPH FOR SAINT LAURENT
LEAD: After 30 years, Yves Saint Laurent can still create a collection that brings an audience to its feet and sums up, in the most perfect and superb way, the current international mood of fashion.
At the recent fall couture showings, one or two other creators were at their best.
But Saint Laurent eclipsed them all.


A Change In Rule on Conversion Attempts
LEAD: It will be possible this college football season for a defensive team to score during a conversion attempt.
The defense can block a kick behind the line of scrimmage, recover the loose ball and return it the length of the field.
Or it can return a kick that is deflected in midair.
Or it can return an intercepted 2-point conversion pass, or a fumble caught in midair.

WHAT'S DOING IN: Victoria
LEAD: Autumn in Victoria, British Columbia, means that it's time for the Pacific salmon to return to spawn and die in the rivers where they were hatched.
And there's little that the Victorians don't know about salmon.

LEAD: THE little black dress in which Audrey Hepburn won so many hearts as Holly Golightly a generation ago is back.

For Accuracy, Artist Stages Civil War
LEAD: THE young soldier falls to the ground, his facial features frozen in an agonized grimace.
His comrade, poised by his side, falters and also falls.
They are the dead; two young men fallen in the service of their country during the Civil War.
But appearances can be deceiving.


The Fall Concerts Await Suscribers
LEAD: WITH the concert season in its annual end-of-summer doldrums, the moment seems right to look ahead to the fall, especially remembering that the early concert subscriber gets better seats and lower prices and can ignore the sold-out signs sure to appear when such superstars as Itzhak Perlman, Jorge Bolet and Rudolf Nureyev arrive.


Sorting Out Who Was Who in Rome
LEAD: The face suggests a man encumbered by imperial burdens, and no doubt he was.
Among the 22 ancient Roman busts now on display at the Emory University Museum of Art and Archeology, this smoothly carved rendering of an older man with close-cropped hair, slightly turned-down lips and heavy brow might well strike a viewer as the sculptural embodiment of authority.


'With Pen in Hand': Long-Range Effects

Ms. Snelling, Artist, Weds
LEAD: The marriage of Diane Bryant Snelling, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Judge Alden Bryan of the Vermont District Court in Burlington officiated.


Three New and Different Galleries
LEAD: GALLERIES come and go, but it seems that in the last few years in Connecticut, more have come than have gone.
And of these, the majority are private, which is remarkable, considering how unpredictable the business can be even in an ideal setting - that is to say, a city with a large audience for art.


Getting Close
LEAD: Closeness counts in horseshoes, of course, but what about in polar exploration?
A new study of the expedition diary and other records kept by Robert E. Peary has raised doubts about the explorer's claim that he reached the North Pole, although he was doubtless somewhere in the vicinity that April day in 1909.


Getting Attention
LEAD: Cesar Chavez is eating again.
The 61-year-old president of the United Farm Workers of America broke his 36-day fast last week surrounded by thousands of supporters of his boycott of California table grapes.

At Compounce, Sellout Crowds

Thousands of cars were trying to get into the amusement park, but for the most part, they were unable to move because of a huge traffic tieup.


A Swingtime Revue: Tunes of the Big Bands
LEAD: THE Music Theater of Connecticut is getting on the bookless bandwagon.
With its current revue, ''Jukebox Saturday Night,'' the fledgling but nomadic theater, which has moved from Fairfield to Wilton in less than a year, is manifesting the latest trend in New York City's musical theater: compilation musicals, or shows that consist of hit tunes from past decades.


Getting Rough
LEAD: The rule for boxers seems simple enough: Inside the ring, it pays to punch; outside the ring, it costs.
Mike Tyson apparently forgot it last week.
The heavyweight champion was in an all-night Harlem clothing store in the wee hours when in walked Mitch (Blood) Green, a rather contentious fighter whom Tyson had defeated in 1986.


Spy Case Leaves Ohio Town In Shock
LEAD: In this little Midwestern town of 5,000 people with its wide, tree-lined streets and classic old white-frame houses, the dominant verities include the Cleveland Browns, the flag, and the honor of the United States.

Where Roadhouse Looks Can Deceive
LEAD: RESTAURANT explorers on the prowl for the unexpected will be in their glory at Riverhead's Peconic House.
It is an almost total surprise.
The name surprises.
It says seafood but is Italian.
The menu surprises.
It reads like standard cliche Italian-American, but the cooking here is anything but routine.

PLUSES OF MALPRACTICE SUITS
LEAD: I am a 1979 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; I consider myself to be intelligent, compassionate and morally upright (Body and Mind: ''Pluses of Malpractice Suits, by William Ira Bennett, July 24).
Yet, I and thousands of other physicians like me, have been influenced negatively by the current system of protecting against medical malpractice in this country.


BISTRO BASICS
LEAD: THE MOST EXCLUSIVE restaurant in Paris is not Taillevent, Jamin or any other multi-starred gastronomic grail, but a threadbare bistro with 10 tables, a kitchen hardly the width of two baguettes end-to-end and a staff of three.
It is called Chez la Vieille. ''A very special place that I've always wanted to visit'' is how Michel Rostang, the chef-owner of a Michelin two-star restaurant in

LEAD: THE BAR IN THE AUDITORIUM lobby at the University of Antwerp was crowded with scholars in baggy suits, itinerant students, assorted hangers-on.

Heat Wave Threatens Pumping Limits

The Passing of Quarterbacks Into Dominance
LEAD: Troy Aikman had completed 6 of 7 passes for 131 yards against a defense that would be in two national championship games.
He was trying to overcome Miami's 14-7 lead with 9 minutes 18 seconds left in the first half.
Then the classic dropback passer was sacked by Jerome Brown, a defensive tackle, and Aikman left Oklahoma's fourth game of the 1985 season with a broken left leg.

The Royal Court Turns 100 (Send Money)
LEAD: Reflecting on 100 years of royal Court history, one could be forgiven for misquoting Oscar Wilde.
To be responsible for one theatrical renaissance might be luck.
To be responsible for two suggests that something is seriously right.
A certain rough magic found its way into the brickwork of that dowdy little building in Sloane Square, and has stayed there through triumph and disaster, controversy and crisis - often crisis.


AFRICA TIMETABLE REMAINS A HURDLE
LEAD: The latest round of negotiations toward peace in Angola and Namibia has ended with a narrowing of differences but no breakthrough on the crucial issue of a timetable for the withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia and of Cuban forces from Angola.


A Gulf Truce Leaves Rebels In a Quandary
LEAD: Across mountains and marshes and plains, the eight-year-old war between Iran and Iraq has spawned another battle of smaller, more shadowy forces whose future now seems clouded by the sudden talk of peace.


An Artist Who Thrives on Contradictions
LEAD: Ever since the tumultuous 1960's, when artists as unlike as Andy Warhol and Robert Smithson helped broaden the boundaries of art by challenging its accepted hierarchies, the medium in which an artist chooses to work has seemed less important than what that artist makes of it.
Today it is possible - as by and large it was not in the 40's and 50's - to work with a variety of materials concurrently, and to draw directly from the supermarket of everyday life.

NEW YORKERS, Etc.
LEAD: SOMEWHERE in the minds of a lot of busy, high-powered people there lurks a vision.
The vision is of themselves, in pajamas or robe, in bed or sprawled in a capacious chair, reading and occasionally running to the refrigerator.

Bush's Aim: Loyal Republicans, Fickle Democrats

Two Six-Man Teams Enter the Battle Successful Transition
LEAD: CAN two six-man teams go to battle without anyone on the bench?

Their opponents moved one table in the opposite direction to the boards, before the imp scores were calculated.


HALF IS BETTER THAN NONE
LEAD: Wine in half-bottles (375 ml.) will mature faster than in full-bottles (750 ml.).

Why Can't The Mets Hit Anymore?
LEAD: The Mets' incompetence at the plate can be attributed to the blatant impatience of their hitters.
Most of them simply refuse to accept a walk and consequently they swing at first pitches and balls out of the strike zone when they're ahead of the count.
The Mets are also guilty of overswinging, which could be because of their tremendous egos.


Guadalcanal
LEAD: To the Editor: Anyone who was involved in World War II, as so many of us were, naturally knows Guadalcanal, but Mrs.
