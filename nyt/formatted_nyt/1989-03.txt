LEAD: The Jets made their second investment in the National Football League free-agent market yesterday when they signed a safety, Rob Sterling, who was a rookie with the Philadelphia Eagles last season and was left unprotected as a free agent.
The 5-foot-11-inch Sterling was sidelined for the year with a neck injury after being drafted on the sixth round out of the University of Maine.

The Lesson of Vietnam Is Still to Be Learned
LEAD: To the Editor:


Aiming to Serve
LEAD: Robert C. McFarlane was an enigmatic player in the Iran-contra drama.
A former Marine Corps officer who became national security adviser to President Reagan, he led a secret mission to Teheran in 1986, with a cake and a Bible signed by the President, in a fruitless quest to trade weapons for hostages.


Bangladesh Ferry Capsizes; At Least 23 Reported Dead
LEAD: A crowded ferry capsized today in southern Bangladesh, and least 23 people were drowned, news reports said.

Three bodies were recovered from the hull of the ferry after rescue teams hauled the boat out of the swift currents of the Kancha River, the United News of Bangladesh said.


Mud on the Senate Floor; In the Tower Debate, All Parties Blame One Another for Disclosures That Sting
LEAD: There are times when Washington takes a mud bath, splashing about indecorously in full view of the whole country, and almost everyone here agrees that this week was one of those times.


Some Plants Are Ideal For Water Conservation
LEAD: There has been little snow pack this year, and gardeners are worried.
What does a dry winter mean for plants?


Days of Our Lives: Calendar as Diary
LEAD: ''I NEVER travel without my diary,'' Oscar Wilde wrote. ''One should always have something sensational to read in the train.''


'Day One': A Primer on the A-Bomb's Birth
LEAD: Unlike the atomic bomb whose creation it chronicles, ''Day One'' doesn't get the Geiger counters clicking.
Tonight's play, at 8 on CBS, is not without force, particularly toward the conclusion, when scientists, military men and Washington officials come into conflict over the rush to ready a bomb to drop on Japan.


Partial Merger of Newspapers Delayed Again
LEAD: A Supreme Court Justice today blocked at least until March 17 the partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers.
The merger was to have begun Monday.


Mysteries Of Cassette Love
LEAD: There's a world of difference between the ones worth having forever and the ones that are only good for an evening of fun.
I refer, of course, to videocassettes, and to the remarkable lack of overlap between titles that become popular rentals and titles that are sold.
What is it that makes ''Lethal Weapon'' (No.


Upper West Side
LEAD: To the Editor:


Ex-Migrant Worker Struggles to Keep Farm Museum Alive
LEAD: WENTWORTH T. PHILLIPS said he had always banked on simple basics like self-sufficiency and knowing the skills of the laboring class to make it in life.
Based on those tenets, he founded the Bloomfield Farm Implement Museum in 1980.
As he will explain over and over, he started his museum with ''the kids, the kids, the kids,'' especially inner-city children, in mind.


Oaxaca
LEAD: To the Editor: Having spent time in Oaxaca nine years ago, I read with interest your story (Travel, Jan. 1) about the decision of the Mexican Government to expand tourism in that mountainous state.


Northern Italian in a Colonial Setting
LEAD: THE quasi-Colonial decor may be a surprise to those crossing the threshold of Casagrande, but it should not dilute one's enjoyment of this northern Italian restaurant in Wallingford, just off Exit 66 of the Wilbur Cross Parkway.


Laying Floor Tiles
LEAD: RESILIENT floor tiles made of vinyl, asphalt or cork are easier to apply than many other types of finish flooring.
Little skill is required to attach them, and, because the tiles are manageable in size - most are 12 inches or less on each side - trimming is less of a chore than it is with sheet vinyl or carpeting.


More and More in Private Soviet Medical Clinics, the Doctor Is Out for Good
LEAD: Galina Pokrovskaya rushed into the offices of the privately operated Filatovetz children's cooperative clinic, frantically looking for a neurologist for her son, Andrei.

Egypt Presses for New Government in Sudan
LEAD: As a political crisis deepens in the Sudan, Egypt, its northern neighbor and onetime ally, has broken publicly with the leadership in Khartoum and wants to see it replaced by a new administration ready to talk peace with rebels in the south, according to highly placed officials here.


Chartres
LEAD: To the Editor: I was at Chartres last June 23 and was able to see the labyrinth uncovered for the first time in many visits.
This was due to the presence of members of a Druid cult who removed the chairs.


Who Is Eligible To Vote May 2
LEAD: All registered voters in New York City as well as all ''parent voters'' are eligible to vote in the community school board elections on May 2.


Afghan Invasion Began in Political Murder
LEAD: To the Editor:


CORRECTION
LEAD: In an article last Sunday about ''Day One,'' a TV drama about the building of the first atomic bomb, James F. Brynes was misidentified, and his involvement in the decision to drop the bomb on Japan was incorrectly described.
He was Secretary of State under President Truman and argued in favor of using the bomb.


Look Out, Trump, It's Kobayashi's Turn
LEAD: The Pacific Basin works like a mirror.
The United States looks across it and is reminded of its own decline.
Japan looks east, sees a wounded giant, and wonders if it is looking at its own future.


A Champion Partnership in Dance
LEAD: DAVID ROSINSKY, a dancer, sometimes twirls his partner, Michele Evans, so that her body barely skims the floor.
At other times, he spins her above his head in a move that the two call the ''helicopter.'' In another move, Mrs.
Evans seems to kneel on Mr.
Rosinky's shoulder. ''I don't know what to call that, but it's interesting,'' Mr.


Not So Mythical
LEAD: To the Editor:


'Carrie's Choice,' A World Premiere
LEAD: ONE of the most rewarding aspects of the season at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale is that it always includes a world premiere.


PASTIMES: AROUND THE GARDEN
LEAD: For This Week: Prune, prune, prune, everything from grapevines, to summer-flowering shrubs to overgrown hedges to small trees; leave the tending of large shade trees to professional arborists who have the ropes, saws, equipment and knowledge to tend them.
Keep up with seed planting indoors.
Finish planning the garden.


QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Next Week; Should The Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.
Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


Zapping A Season Of Opera
LEAD: If life were as easily controlled as a movie on the VCR, who could resist the urge to toy with those buttons?
Reverse and fast forward would probably get the most play, though an occasional Faust might opt for the stop mode or at least the slo-mo.
Looking back at the new productions offered this season by the Metropolitan Opera, I myself find the erase button most tempting.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Track and Field  World Marks Tumble: Paul Ereng of Kenya, the Olympic champion, broke Sebastian Coe's six-year-old world mark in the men's 800 meters yesterday, and Javier Sotomayor of Cuba set a world record in the men's high jump at the world indoor championships in Budapest.
Two other world marks also fell: Elly van Hulst of the Netherlands slashed nearly six seconds off the women's 3,000-meter best and Kerry Saxby of Australia lowered the mark in the women's 3,000-meter walk.


CLARA'S GIFT 109 pp. New York: Penguin Books. Paper, $6.95.
LEAD: Among contemporary American writers there are many accomplished stylists, for ours is an age of intense literary activity, much idiosyncratic virtuosity and invention.
The general assumption may be that ''realism'' is not an experimental literary convention but simply ''the way things are''; but practicing writers know that all genres, all visions, all artful employments of language are conventions, freely available to the virtuoso.


Miss Donaldson Plans to Marry a Physician
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Mr. and Mrs.
John C. Donaldson Jr. of Millington, N.J., of the engagement of their daughter, Susan Donaldson, to Dr.
J.
Michael Haering, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
James J. Haering of Bethlehem, Pa.
The couple plan to marry in June.


Barely Bilingual
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Abroad And Barely Bilingual'' described my delight mixed with trepidation when among strange tongues where I make it a rule always to carry a piece of paper in my pocket bearing the name of my hotel.
This served me well in downtown Tashkent when boarding a trolley I learned by agitated gestures of the ticket taker after reading the name of my hotel, that I was on the right trolley going in the wrong direction.


Correction
LEAD: An article last Sunday about the founding congress of the first Soviet bar association referred incorrectly to the name it selected.
The congress adopted an amendment changing the name from the Soviet Advocates' Association to the Soviet Advocates'

LEAD: Claudio Richerme, a Brazilian pianist, devoted most of his Thursday-evening program at Weill Recital Hall to music by two of his country's best-known composers, Mozart Camargo Guarnieri and Heitor Villa-Lobos.


Injured Rangers Stay on Top
LEAD: For the Rangers, the injuries have hit hard and often recently, depleting their defense and disarming their attack.
Their consolation has been that for all their recent injuries, there has been almost no damage to their position in the Patrick Division.


Correction
LEAD: A discography on page 27 of the Arts and Leisure section today with an article about the pianist Vladimir Feltsman misidentifies the orchestra and conductor for a Prokofiev series on CBS Masterworks, and the works involved.
The recordings, of the First and Second Concertos, are by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas.


Review/Theater; Oedipus and Dionysus, Set to Music
LEAD: There may be more to Dionysian ecstasy than meets the eye in Ellen Stewart's ''Dionysus Filius Dei,'' performed by the Great Jones Repertory Company at La Mama.
But since there are no words in this ''dance opera'' except a minimal vocal score in Greek provided by Elizabeth Swados, what eludes the eye often escapes comprehension and baffles the emotions.


Lisa Amy Stern Engaged to Marry Craig Steven Lax
LEAD: Lisa Amy Stern and Craig Steven Lax are planning a September wedding, the parents of the future bride, Dr. and Mrs.
Martin T. Stern of Manhasset, L.I., have announced.
Mr.

STREETSCAPES: The Cos Cob Power Plant; The Preservationists Seem to Be Running Out of Steam
LEAD: THEY'RE taking it in little steps at the Historical Society of the Town of Greenwich, asking only that the Town Selectmen consider reusing the old Cos Cob Power Plant.

Italy Lawmakers Seek U.S. Convict's Release
LEAD: Almost 300 Italian lawmakers have begun a campaign to win freedom, or at least deportation, for an Italian woman who was convicted in New York of Federal conspiracy and racketeering charges related to the 1981 Brink's armored-car holdup and triple murder in Rockland County.

THE CASE FOR TAKEOVERS
LEAD: Thank you for running Carl C. Icahn's ''Case for Takeovers'' (Jan. 29), in rebuttal to the article by Robert Reich on leveraged buyouts.
It is interesting to note that Mr.
Reich is from Harvard's school of government, not its business school.
That might explain his comfort with keeping incompetence in companies.


The Princeton Corridor: Boom Runs Out of Gas
LEAD: IT could be Dallas without the skyscrapers or Denver without the mountains.
But what Route 1 does have in common with those cities as it runs through central New Jersey is lots of brand new office space crying out for tenants.


Ellen DiNoto Marries Arthur Colozzi
LEAD: Ellen Michelle DiNoto, a daughter of Justice and Mrs.
John DiNoto of Freeport, L.I., was married there yesterday to Arthur L. Colozzi, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Costa Rica
LEAD: To the Editor: We were planning a two-week vacation in Costa Rica this winter with about half of our time on Isla Jesusita, a small island off the Pacific Coast scarcely mentioned in guidebooks.
For three weeks we and our travel agent tried to call the 800 number for the Costa Rica National Tourist Bureau in Miami.


Arena of Big-Time Athletics Is Showcasing a Younger Act
LEAD: High school athletics have become the latest entree on the American sports menu, served up to help satisfy the voracious appetite of the fan.
As a result, scholastic athletes are on the verge of becoming as important to the billion-dollar sports industry as their college brothers and sisters - and just as vulnerable to big-time exploitation.


2 Men Charged in Slaying Of a Policeman in Flatbush
LEAD: Two men were charged yesterday in the slaying of a plainclothes police officer who, the authorities said, was killed with his own gun in a struggle with the suspects on a Brooklyn street early Friday.

'Kiddie Tax' Makes Saving for College Harder
LEAD: Parents should begin setting aside money for their children's college educations as soon as possible, financial planning experts say.

Keeping Fit in Economy Class
LEAD: WHEN Ruth Bocour of New York took an economy-class flight to California some years ago, her leg began to hurt and she thought she had a charley horse.
Mrs.
Bocour, a former professional dancer who now helps injured people improve mobility, said that when the plane stopped in Las Vegas, she ''walked around like crazy'' and tried to exercise the leg to get the cramp out, but to no avail.


LEVERAGED BUYOUTS
LEAD: Robert B. Reich's article ''Leveraged Buyouts: America Pays the Price'' (Jan. 29) says all the things that my friends and I - people of average income and investment - have felt about this legalized thievery for years.
The biggest crime is that the brokerage houses, the executives settling gently to the ground in their golden parachutes and the huge law firms who do all the paper shuffling are the only winners.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Secondary Office Space; In a Sluggish Market, the Pressure's On to Renovate

Strawberry's Big Bat Speaks Loud and Clear
LEAD: ''What's done is done,'' Darryl Strawberry was saying, after his one-day exile was done. ''I'm back.'' He was back, all right.

It made a lasting impression on someone reared on the simplicity of American Colonial architecture.

STYLE MAKERS: Oribe; HAIR STYLIST
LEAD: Women who fancy $125 haircuts by Oribe are now making appointments for January 1990.
This is chancy, they realize, since when the big day arrives, the Cuban-born stylist may be off in exotic climes arranging models' tresses for high fashion photography.

CEZANNE: CREATING THE FUTURE SINGLE-HANDED
LEAD: If ever a show had competition, it is ''Cezanne: The Early Years 1859-1872'' at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

Olive Oil Replaces Butter in Many Dishes
LEAD: MORE and more, I find myself using olive oil for cooking instead of butter.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Cable TV Operators Are Guilty of Greed
LEAD: Cablevision's positions in the MSG dispute are defenseless.
MSG is not ''expensive'': including the new Yankee contract, it costs less than $1 per month per subscriber.
It is also not ''specialty programming'': 9 of the 10 most-watched cable programs in 1988 were sports.


PASTIMES: BRIDGE
LEAD: In social games, using either four-deal scoring or the traditional rubber bridge scoring, it is common for a player to fail in a part-score contract by three or more tricks.

Olive Oil Replaces Butter in Many Dishes
LEAD: MORE and more, I find myself using olive oil for cooking instead of butter.

Question Of the Week; How Will Vandeweghe Affect The Knicks?
LEAD: The addition of Kiki Vandeweghe will certainly improve the team.
I think he is a great shooter.
There is no question in my mind that Kiki can shoot the lights out.
He can bring to this already respected club a new, positive dimension.
In my mind, he will be the 1989 Knick version of Mychal Thompson's addition to the Lakers.


Railway Lines Facing Strikes
LEAD: Federal labor law governing transportation workers allows striking unions to picket companies not directly involved in a contract dispute.


Dirty War Grows Dirtier In El Salvador
LEAD: The tape-recorded threat, apparently from a left-wing group, arrived at the radio station here and was quickly broadcast: Unless the right-wing Mayor resigned within 48 hours, he would be killed.


THE LAX HABITS OF THE FREE IMAGINATION
LEAD: A brief cautionary tale: one day some years ago, after I had published a book, I was asked for permission to excerpt a piece from it in an anthology.
Delighted, I wrote back.
As it happened, I used this anthology in a course I taught.
I admired its selections, and found the study questions helpful.


Switzerland
LEAD: To the Editor: The story of the journey to Rike's grave in Switzerland (Travel, Jan. 1) brought back memories of a similar pilgrimage I made as a Texas schoolgirl years ago.

Rates Are Down, Complexities Up
LEAD: As Americans get ready for their annual April tax-filing ritual, the once-heralded concept of simplification seems to have fallen through the cracks.

Chartres
LEAD: To the Editor: Joan Gould's article on Chartres (Travel, Dec. 18) was a perfect description of what I had seen only a few weeks before.
I would like to echo her recommendation of Malcolm Miller as a guide and to emphasize that he is more than ''just a guide.'' He is an inspired teacher and exudes the charm (with his British accent) of an actor.


Review/Theater; The Political Circe Of the Gang of Four
LEAD: Before she became the wife of Mao Zedong and, subsequently, the most powerful woman in China, Jiang Qing was an actress.
One of her favorite roles was Nora in ''A Doll's House,'' which she played in Shanghai in 1935.
Beginning with these facts and Jiang's trial as one of the notorious Gang of Four, Leslie Mohn has created an irreverent, freewheeling political escapade titled ''White Boned Demon.

Chartres
LEAD: To the Editor: Joan Gould's article noted that the city of Chartres is a convenient starting point for excursions to other places of interest nearby.

Tower's nomination as Secretary of Defense, said today that the nominee has been treated unfairly in the Senate confirmation process because he has not had a chance to confront his accusers.


Barely Bilingual
LEAD: To the Editor: I read with enjoyment and a sense of familiarity Carol Asher's article ''Abroad and Barely Bilingual'' (Travel, Dec. 25).
I share her sense of adventure in trying to decode and use an unfamiliar language, but an additional interest is the insight it gives into ambiguities that are generally overlooked in everyday use of a familiar language.

From Bumpers to Hoods, Detroit Opens the Door for Plastics
LEAD: Plastic producers have had a tough time shifting out of low gear as they try to sell Detroit on the plastic car.
Over the last decade, auto makers have increased their use of plastics in car interiors and in small parts to make them lighter and more fuel-efficient.

LEAD: There are a fair number of new skyscrapers in this growing city, including one by the slick New York firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox that endeavors, with mixed success, to give distinction to this city's skyline.

This, in turn, would allow the Government to deny clearances to Federal workers or to the employees of Government contractors, without any explanation.


Snuffing It Out
LEAD: If a Ford Edsel could be rolled and smoked, it might be called the Premier.

A New Kind of Rock

The loose network of college (and a few commercial) radio stations, rock-club disk jockeys and active music fans that sent R.E.M. into the Top 10 has nurtured an ''alternative rock'' that's more melodic than post-punk hard-core rock yet looser, more unruly and less formulaic than big-budget productions such as Bon Jovi.


Laying Floor Tiles
LEAD: RESILIENT floor tiles made of vinyl, asphalt or cork are easier to apply than many other types of finish flooring.
Little skill is required to attach them, and, because the tiles are manageable in size - most are 12 inches or less on each side - trimming is less of a chore than it is with sheet vinyl or carpeting.

Do Some Rockers Hide Out in Dated Styles?
LEAD: I like Lucinda Williams's eponymous album on the Rough Trade label as much as the next person: This is serious, satisfying singing and playing and composing in a gritty folk-blues-rock idiom.

ECCENTRICITIES
LEAD: At first glance, it all looks terribly proper: the early 19th-century secretaire topped with a pair of terra cotta busts; a William IV sofa in front of windows facing the street, and a simple mirror over the fireplace.

Patients' Rights
LEAD: MY DOCTOR put me on a beta blocker,'' a friend told me last week. ''I hate the side effects, but I couldn't argue with him.'' Many, perhaps most, patients feel that way: they don't really have much say in the matter.

MAPPING THE TRACES MAN LEAVES ON THE LAND
LEAD: Although they share a surname and a reverence for the American West, one would be hard pressed to find two more dissimilar landscape photographers than Ansel Adams and Robert Adams.

Capital Gains
LEAD: To the Editor:


A Hunger to Write
LEAD: Born in 1921 in Robinson, a small town in rural Illinois, James Jones was a curiously American phenomenon: the great novelist who comes out of nowhere, equipped only with talent and a fierce determination to write.

LEAD: I am one of the fortunate special educators to teach in a school chosen by the State of New Jersey to pilot the Plan to Revise Special Education.

Nudging the Thai-Cambodian border, Site 8 is run by the Khmer Rouge.

LEAD: ''Intermezzo,'' revived by the Feld Ballet on Thursday at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street), heralded Eliot Feld as a major new talent at its 1969 premiere.
The ballet's score is piano music by Brahms, performed sensitively here by Peter Longiaru.
And so there were inevitable comparisons to two other ''piano ballets'' of the decade, George Balanchine's ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' and Jerome Robbins's ''Dances at a Gathering.


Just Cutting Care Won't Cut Costs
LEAD: In pursuit of a painless method for containing hospital costs, American industry now has a new white knight: utilization review.
A rapidly-growing breed of cost-management companies - under contract to employers and insurers - that decide if hospital admissions are justified, monitor length-of-stay and carry out other cost-containment functions.


Bamberg
LEAD: To the Editor: Olivier Bernier's article ''Discovering Old Germany in Bamberg'' (Travel, Jan. 29) is most illuminating.
However, if my memory serves me right, when I visited the Bamberg cathedral many years ago, I was shocked by two juxtaposed statues, one representing Christianity, with smiling lips, the other, blindfolded, representing

THE WORLD: Fallout Over Rushdie; The Muslim Presence In Western Europe Is Suddenly Starker
LEAD: TELEVISION magnifies reality, and the image on French television screens a week ago was shocking.
In the heart of Paris, at the Place de la Republique, some 1,500 Muslims, many of them Pakistanis, screamed into television cameras for the death of Salman Rushdie.
With close-up camera work, the smallish crowd suddenly seemed to represent a fanatic Islamic fifth column that had surfaced in France just as it is celebrating the 200th anniversary of its republican, anticlerical revolution.

A Fresh Twist for an Oft-Told Romantic Tale

LEAD: Sunday lunch or Sunday dinner: something easy to shop for, easy to prepare, easy to eat and satisfying in winter's brisk weather.

Tisdale, recalling the course Ms.
Smilow took.


Plan for Homeless Offers Hope
LEAD: That there exists continued difficulty in providing adequate housing for the homeless should not come as a surprise (''State Plays Bigger Role for Homeless,'' Jan. 22).

Two Orton Veterans, Once More Into the Breach
LEAD: AT THE MANHATTAN THEATER Club's loft in downtown Manhattan, a rehearsal for Joe Orton's ''What the Butler Saw'' begins with the assistant stage manager being put into a straitjacket.

Washington Expects a Tax Bill, but a Minor One

CAMPUS LIFE: Boston College; Getting Your Grades At the Teller Machine

Not at Boston College, which has installed a machine that dispenses academic records the way an automated teller machine dispenses cash.

For Investors, More to Learn
LEAD: Investing and taxes used to be a simple matter.
If taxpayers made money on investments, they paid a tax.
If the money was made by selling a security held longer than six months, the profit was considered a long-term gain and they paid a reduced tax.
And if they borrowed money to pay for the investment, they generally got to deduct the interest.


Reviews/Music; A Program Built on 'Pierrot Lunaire'
LEAD: It is not hard to imagine what so impressed Stravinsky when he heard Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire'' for the first time in the winter of 1912.
Three-quarters of a century later, a listener can still be made to feel unsettled by the music's urgency and strangeness.


FICTION
LEAD:  WE'RE NOT HERE.
By Tim Mahoney. (Delta, Paper, $7.95.) Many Vietnam novels stagger out of the souls of American soldiers who can describe their suffering but have trouble getting beyond it.

WHAT'S DOING IN: Hamburg
LEAD: Hamburg is a city best savored in the evening fog, when its crown of thin spires shimmers through the branches of great oaks leaning over the Outer Alster, the larger of the two lakes around which the city lies, and gulls swoop low over the rowing shells gliding silently past.

LEAD: JUST how tap dancing soothes ragged nerves, no one could quite say.

Beds for Less Than a King-Size Budget

LEAD: To the editor:


Laying Floor Tiles
LEAD: RESILIENT floor tiles made of vinyl, asphalt or cork are easier to apply than many other types of finish flooring.
Little skill is required to attach them, and, because the tiles are manageable in size - most are 12 inches or less on each side - trimming is less of a chore than it is with sheet vinyl or carpeting.

North Africa's Family Meal

LEAD: One of Beverly Sills's innovations as general manager of the New York City Opera has been the introduction of musical-theater works into the opera house.

However, Mr.
McFarlane's peculiar use of the word ''ken'' seemed a glitch.


MCFARLANE'S CAREFUL LANGUAGE
LEAD: I find the letter by Leonard Garment, Robert McFarlane's counsel, morally offensive and, sadly, too characteristic of the Washington mindset (Letters, Feb. 12, in response to ''Bud McFarlane: Semper Fi,'' by Brock Brower, Jan. 22).

LEAD: ALTHOUGH quick to admire our modern city, more than a few of us in White Plains have begun to lament its meteoric growth.

FASHION: On the Street; Snuggling Up With Classic Camel's Hair
LEAD: The camel's-hair overcoat is as dependable in cold weather as the camel is when it's hot.
Here is a cover-up that will go anywhere with practically anything, be it a pin-striped business suit or blue jeans and a turtleneck, silk scarf or wool choker.
It's dressy enough when it needs to be, but there's always that nice dash of informality and practicality.

THE WEDDING
LEAD: As a justice of the peace, I married a young couple fresh off the slopes, in ski clothes, last winter.

'Hanussen': Foreseeing the Hitler Nightmare
LEAD: If you happened to be living in Berlin in the late 1920's or early 1930's and witnessed the episode in historical insanity that was the rise to power of Adoph Hitler, it is highly probable that the name Hanussen might ring a bell.
Hanussen was the stage name of one Klaus Steinshneider, a nightclub and stage clairvoyant of considerable fame during those years, widely accused of fraud in the newspapers, but, nonetheless, it seems, a magician of rather chilling abilities.

Rites of Spring Training
LEAD: AGAINST THE ENORMOUS BLUE BACKDROP of an Arizona morning, early arrivals quietly gather in the grandstand of HoHoKam Park, in Mesa, about 13 miles from Phoenix.
Palm trees sway in the soft breeze beyond the billboard fences, and the only sound to be heard is the crack of a bat hitting a ball.


Inmate on Leave Held in Death Of His Ex-Wife
LEAD: Lisa Bianco, an advocate for battered women who had been beaten for years by her former husband, took little comfort in his imprisonment for brutally attacking her two years ago.
Instead, she lived in daily fear that he would make good his threats to kill her.


FICTION'S EMBATTLED INFIDEL
LEAD: I fail to see how Salman Rushdie can say about Islamic culture, ''I know it well'' (''Salman Rushdie: Fiction's Embattled Infidel,'' Jan. 29).
After all, from the age of 13, he worked to be accepted by a society that despises the culture from which he came.
However, if it is true that he understands Islamic culture well, this is proof that his current book is a conscious defamation of Islam.

Taking the Mud at Saturnia

The waters of Saturnia have been considered a panacea for a number of ills for 3,000 years.


SMALL TOTS, BIG BIZ
LEAD: Your article on Kinder-Care reflects the popular but unwise trend to mix child day care with academic learning programs.
A day-care program genuinely focused on the needs of children would direct its objectives to achieve a representation of basic family, home-style care.
It would provide daytime surrogates who would offer the tots unconditional acceptance (love can't be bought), much consistency and sensory experiences to stimulate well-documented early learning needs.


THE WORLD: Overlooking the Unworkable; Apartheid Frays at the Edges, But Its Core Is Unchanged
LEAD: THE South African Government set a precedent last week that could hasten the demise of its laws on strict residential segregation.

Review/Theater; Exploring Improbabilities And the Human Comedy

LEAD: They laughed when Susan M. Wachter sat down at her computer keyboard two years ago and announced that she could predict the future of Manhattan cooperative apartment prices, an accomplishment that for years had defied the best efforts of real estate experts and economists.
Yet her prediction turned out to be about as correct as a computer- assisted human's could be.


Leaky Basements
LEAD: SPRING rains and thawing temperatures often cause basement walls to develop leaks.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  ART FROM DROSS  Apparently, one man's garbage can be another's art.
So today, the always-adventurous Islip Art Museum opens ''Dross to Art,'' a group exhibition showcasing nine artists who use dross - defined as ''refuse, rubbish, impure matter'' - to make their creative statements.


Loudspeakers Climb the Walls
LEAD: The fevered rise of housing costs has put such a crunch on urban living space that many apartment dwellers simply can't find room for loudspeakers.
That's quite a switch from earlier times, when even a bulky piano in the living room was pretty much taken for granted by music lovers.
But, as they used to say then (when an occasional bit of Latin was also taken for granted), tempora mutantur.Today floor space has to be parceled out by the square inch.


Paying for Employee Education Benefits
LEAD: Thanks to several complicated tax changes, the price of an education is going up for some employer-subsidized students - at least for now.
Employees whose companies pick up the tab for their studies may soon find that their paychecks have shrunk because taxes are suddenly being withheld on those benefits.


U.S. Shapes Plan to Get Missiles From Afghans
LEAD: The Bush Administration is increasingly concerned that it may not be able to recover hundreds of sophisticated Stinger missiles still in the hands of American-backed Afghan rebels, senior Administration officials said today.


Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: Besides the Mets' pitching staff, Strawberry is the only outstanding player the team has.
Sure Hernandez was, Jeffries could be, and McReynolds might be.
But, none brings the magic to the plate like Strawberry.
His ability to hit the long ball at a pitchers' park, his blazing speed, topped with his m.v.p.-like stats the last two years makes him the top everyday player in the National League, and maybe in the Major Leagues.


CLUB COMFORT
LEAD: I RECENTLY DINED IN ONE OF THE PATRI-cian clubs scattered throughout New York -those limestone oases that transport you from the tumult of city life.
In the library, attending maids passed prefatory drinks to our assembly, along with hot hors d'oeuvres: flaky spinach tarts; napoleons of Roquefort; smoked salmon on dark bread; shrimp with green mayonnaise.


Oprah Winfrey's Odyssey: Talk-Show Host to Mogul
LEAD: Here is a typical story from the pages of the improbable career of Oprah Winfrey: It's 1984, the 30-year-old host of a Chicago morning talk show is in North Carolina, on the set of Steven Spielberg's film ''The Color Purple.'' Though she has no previous acting experience, she has been cast in an important supporting role in a lavish production of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.


Reviews/Music; Handy Four-Part Harmonies, With Humor
LEAD: John Handy's first set at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday night started out sluggishly; the rhythm section couldn't find a groove, and Mr.
Handy, when he improvised, just added to the set's sullenness.
About halfway through the second tune of the first set, Mr.
Handy and the rhythm section found equal ground, and like an engine finally starting up in the cold, they took off.


Leaky Basements

Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: Darryl Strawberry should be traded immediately.

Carson to Stay on 'Tonight'
LEAD: Johnny Carson is to remain the host of the ''Tonight'' show on NBC for at least another year - his 28th -through September 1990, he announced Wednesday night.


The Narrow Margin
LEAD: There is no more delicate responsibility for political leaders than nuclear weapons.
But from the beginning, in 1945, leaders made decisions about the weapons on flawed premises and with inadequate understanding of possible consequences.
We are lucky to have avoided the worst.


Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: It's a long season.
At some point in June or July when Darryl comes to bat in a close game with the bases loaded, and radio announcers for both teams are discussing the possibility of an intentional walk, then all of his bad behavior of the spring will be forgotten.
You just can't trade a player like that.


Study Criticizes Low Enrollment in Food Program
LEAD: More than 100,000 of the 312,000 mothers and children in New York City who are eligible to receive food through a government-supported nutrition program are not enrolled in it.
That is the principal finding of a recent study of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as W


Rap as Public Forum on Matters of Life and Death
LEAD: The movie ''Colors'' opened last spring to outcries that it glorified gang violence.
The film focused on the lives of gang members, but in the end the gangsters died senseless and unheroic deaths.
More equivocal was the theme song, performed by Ice-T, a Los Angeles rapper and former gang member.
Over a slow, nightmarish electronic rhythm, Ice

LEAD: IN the fairest of all possible worlds, one would be all aglow over N. Richard Nash's newest play, the last of a trilogy that began with ''The Rainmaker.''


Review/Music; Cellist Plays Solo and Chamber Pieces
LEAD: Eugene Bondi, a cellist, offered an inconsistent but largely pleasing evening of solo and chamber music Wednesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall.
It was evident that he had devoted time and care to considering the music's impulses, and that he had firm personal views about the composers' intentions.


Sugan Pie, Montreal's Winter Comfort Food
LEAD: WINTER pies, made with staples found in every larder and designed to fight the cold with calories, are particularly dear to the Quebecois.
Old-fashioned favorites, which are now served in Quebec year round, include raisin pie, suet pie, and tarte a la ferlouche (molasses and raisin pie).

By Albert Lebowitz. (Louisiana State University, $15.95.) Albert Lebowitz, an attorney who lives in St.

One Harvard Goal Unrealized
LEAD: The assets of the Harvard hockey team rarely accrue to an Ivy League sports component these days.

THE WORLD SERIES THAT STILL HAUNTS OAKLAND
LEAD: By their nature, the best relief pitchers respond to pressure.
They also respond to pressure questions.

PERSPECTIVES: Low-Income Housing; Rent Supplement Review Nears
LEAD: THE rhetoric on housing in Washington this year centers on homelessness and what the Federal Government should do about it.

Trying to Fix a Statute Run Amok
LEAD: RICO, is a statute run amok and no one is beyond its reach.
Many times a day, unsuspecting citizens and businesses are shocked to find that they are targets of RICO suits.
The law's broad civil suit provisions cast a net so wide that virtually any commercial dispute becomes a candidate for civil RICO jurisdiction.


Clothes Swapping in the 80's: My Bow for Your Black Hose
LEAD: They traded poodle skirts in the Fifties, miniskirts in the Sixties and bell-bottom pants in the Seventies.
And although the look may have changed over the years, clothes swapping is still very much in style among women in their 20's.


SCULPTURE'S MOVE DELAYED BY JUDGE
LEAD: In an 11th-hour stay worthy of the twisting tale it has provoked, Richard Serra's ''Tilted Arc'' was spared dismantling yesterday.
A Federal judge issued a temporary restraining order barring the Government from removing the giant sculpture from Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan until new legal arguments can be heard.

Recycling Bill Draws Mixed Reviews
LEAD: Officials of the agency that buys supplies for New York City say a City Council bill on recycling - intended to ease the garbage crisis - will make life uneasy for them.
They say the bill's requirement that they give preference to products made of recycled material will slow down the purchasing process, possibly make it more expensive and cause the city to buy merchandise whose efficacy is unproven.


HARVARD'S KENNEDY SCHOOL: IS COMPETENCE ENOUGH?

Return of an Impudent Original
LEAD: The arrival of SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS ON the video shelves (MCA Home Video, $29.95) is happy news for fans of Preston Sturges, which should mean everybody who likes movies.

A ONETIME BACKER ACCUSES SAVIMBI

LEAD: The glut of office space in New York City and throughout the metropolitan region persists and in some areas is growing worse, part of a national trend that followed a wave of growth earlier in the 1980's.


It's Not Easy Being Green
LEAD: HAVE you ever heard the grass say ''Ouch!'' when you step on it?
I have.
In squeaky voices, the slender stalks of green shout in fragmented choruses, sounding much like the cacophony you hear when entering a large cafeteria, only octaves higher.


WHERE WERE THE ACCOUNTANTS?
LEAD: Why did accountants throughout the nation fail to detect the shenanigans that triggered one of the biggest financial calamities this country has ever seen?

Tribute to Gehrig
LEAD: It was 50 years ago this year that baseball's Iron Man, Lou Gehrig, took himself out of the Yankee lineup for the first time since 1925 and brought an end to his remarkable record of 2,130 consecutive games.

Camera
LEAD: Every so often a question arrives in the mailbox that does not ask for advice about what camera to buy, but addresses a problem plenty of us share.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My vacation house is used a few times a year, but not enough to leave the heat on between visits.

Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: For equal, or nearly equal value, yes.
Despite being a feared hitter, he does have significant failings.
His defense is suspect, if not downright poor.
He catches the ball off-balance and is then in a poor position to throw.
His powerful arm is more than negated by the number of extra steps he takes to release the ball.

On the Outs
LEAD: The saga of Joe Clark began in 1982, when he threw 300 troublesome students out of Eastside High School in Paterson, N.J.
Last week, the tough-talking principal, who patrols the school's hallways with a bullhorn and baseball bat, was himself suspended for five days.
School officials said he failed to supervise his building two weeks ago when three male dancers stripped to their G-strings during a variety show by professional entertainers at a school assembly.


Tracking the Green Fairy
LEAD: In 1882, Oscar Wilde effused: ''A glass of absinthe is as poetical as anything in the world.
What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?'' Verlaine, Rimbaud, Toulouse-Lautrec, van Gogh, Daumier, Baudelaire - all took ''inspiration'' from absinthe, the cloudy green aperitif made from wormwood, a strong-smelling perennial herb.


CAMPUS LIFE: Tufts; For the Latest In Campus News, Read the Cannon

Seeing Ground Zero in Nevada
LEAD: AT 5:30 in the morning, the Zeus Room of the Alexis Park Hotel in Nevada was packed with animated tourists.
Even in the predawn hours, a substantial assembly in one of the public rooms of a Las Vegas hotel would not have been unusual.
But in this case, not a single slot machine, roulette wheel or blackjack table was in sight; the Alexis Park is a nongambling hotel.


Car Theft Fraud: A Felon Is a Felon
LEAD: Revealing and interesting was the article  [ ''Car Theft Fraud Rampant at Nassau Shopping Mall,'' Feb. 19 ]  on car theft fraud as practiced at the Green Acres Shopping Center.


Bridge
LEAD: The Spring National Championships of the American Contract Bridge League, already in progress in Reno, Nev., will have a double climax next weekend.

Behind the Arms Plans, A Clash Of Visions
LEAD: THE proposals that NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries put forward in Vienna last week for cutting conventional arms are full of references to weapon ceilings, partially demilitarized zones and phased reductions of military systems.


Unseen Levies Confound the Issue of Tax Burden
LEAD: WAKE up in the morning, roll over once and get set to pay the first tax of the day.
The tax, assessed by the state on the electric utility and passed on by the company into monthly gas and electric bills, has just clicked in with the thermostat that turned up the heat.

Sunshine and Shallows
LEAD: ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE CENTURIES-OLD literature devoted to fly fishing has to do with wooing trout from streams or rivers, those who have been fortunate enough to angle the tidal flats of Florida are forever beset by a desire to return to the domain of the tarpon and bonefish.


I Call It Making Supper
LEAD: I RECENTLY read yet another article about trends.
With the change of the seasons, people who claim to have their finger on the pulse of the future use a lot of fancy words to predict how certain groups of people will eat, dress and entertain themselves for the next several months.

Midsummer Magic in the Lands of the Midnight Sun
LEAD: A STORY IS TOLD ABOUT THE AESIR, THE gods of Asgard.
It seems that they had to fashion a rope of tremendous strength, and they asked Odin the One-Eyed to obtain one for them.
He went away for a while and returned with what appeared to be a slender silken cord.
It didn't look very strong, but when the gods examined it they saw that it was woven from the roots of a mountain, the purring of a cat, the sinews of a bear, the breath of a fish, the beard of a woman, the spittle of a bird.


Charles E. McDonnell, Stockbroker, 65
LEAD: Charles E. McDonnell, a stockbroker, died of cardiac arrest Friday at his home in Rye, N.Y.
He was 65 years old.


Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: My knee-jerk reflex was to trade him.
But then I witnessed his monstrous home run to the center-field wall in an exhibition game this weekend.
The beauty of his outstretched arms and bat acting as one, making contact with the ball and launching a rocket, would be lost to me if he did it for any other team but the Mets.


Reviews/Music; Premiere Of Quintet By Rorem
LEAD: The centerpiece of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's current program - played Friday night and to be repeated this afternoon at Alice Tully Hall - is a new quintet by Ned Rorem, called ''Bright Music'' and scored for flute, two violins, cello and piano.

LEAD: IT is an excruciating minuet danced by lawmakers, the courts, Federal agencies and special-interest groups around the dormant Shoreham atomic energy plant.


VIEWS FROM THE TERRITORIES BY A VISIONARY SNAPSHOOTER
LEAD: Since its invention, photography has been associated with mirrors: it seems to reflect the world directly back at us.
When we look at a print of turn-of-the-century Paris by Eugene Atget, we seldom ask if that's the way Paris really looked at the time.
But camera vision is as much a product of human invention as language.

A Black Perspective on the 1930's
LEAD: NO decade of the 20th century has sent out more conflicting cultural signals than the 1930's.
On the one hand, there are the Busby Berkeley musicals, the dance marathons and the comedies of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard; on the other hand, there is the art focusing mainly on the reality of the Depression - abstractions and the regional fantasies of Grant Wood notwithstanding.

Children's Books
LEAD: To the Editor: ''A Book Lover's Los Angeles'' (Travel, Jan. 8) may have misled readers as to the first edition of Beatrix Potter's ''Tale of Peter Rabbit.'' Unable to get a trade publisher to produce her little book, the author arranged for 250 copies to be privately printed in December 1901.
Its unexpected reception led to a second edition printed (privately) in February 1902, with some slight changes in both the text and the binding.

At the End of A Hard Drive, Maui Luxury
LEAD: THE road to Hana, a secluded town at the easternmost tip of Maui, second largest of the Hawaiian islands, is known as the Hana Highway, undoubtedly dubbed that by some waggish jofficial to encourage tourism.
A highway it is not.
It is rather a two-lane layering of macadam over a 54-mile course that takes more than two hours and 600 turns to maneuver, a pothole-pocked trail that tunels and twists along rain-eroded cliffs, between sea and rain forests, passing over 54 narroiw birdges.


THE WORLD: The Amazon Forest; Brazil Wants Its Dams, but At What Cost?
LEAD: THE rising waters are already lapping at the treetops and soon a new expanse of rain forest will completely disappear in Brazil's rush for energy.

Navigating the Changes in Cable TV
LEAD: WHEN the first cable-television system in the state began operations nearly 30 years ago, its major function was to make clear television reception available, for the first time, to isolated communities.


The City of Light Throws a Party
LEAD: THE FRENCH REVOLUTION was neither the best of times nor the most frivolous, but there will be plenty of frivolity throughout Republican Paris this year.
It seems every museum, every arrondissement's city hall, even every esoteric reading club, is vying to mark the events of 1789, although of course no one wants to re-create the parts that make everybody uneasy.


Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: The Mets should trade Strawberry only if, after the 1989 season, he and his ill-advising adviser, Eric Goldschmidt, are unbudgingly determined to leave New York.
No team can afford to lose a talent like Strawberry to free agency without first trying to get several good players in return through a trade.


Women, Children and Writing
LEAD: To the Editor:


ROCKER JOHN HIATT: AS GOOD AS HIS WORDS
LEAD: FROM A DISTANCE, THE STAGE OF the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco resembles a gaudy Christmas display.
Red oversized bows are pinned across the backs of the amplifiers, and the dark red backdrop is festooned with gold and silver garlands.
Scores of tiny, multicolored lights are wound around a drum set, across a black digital piano and around three microphone stands.


Broadway-Bound Church
LEAD: To the Editor:


Prop 48 Makes Athletes Study
LEAD: It is probably true that the majority of entering freshmen in some colleges and universities in the United States know more than graduating seniors in others.
The strength of American higher education is its diversity, which is characterized by widely differing standards and expectations at both the entry and degree-completion levels.


Early Exodus Portends Sudan Famine

Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: Trading Darryl Strawberry would be a major mistake by the Mets because of the scarcity of left-handed home-run hitters today.
And I strongly doubt the Mets would receive equal value in trading their most valuable asset.

Old Venice Glitters At Waldorf
LEAD: The Venice of the past was re-created briefly at the Waldorf-Astoria last week at a Venetian Masked Purim Ball to benefit the Jewish Museum.
Drifting through the grand ballroom were gondoliers, minstrels and an actress who glided majestically on stilts.


Kean Seeks Support For Change In Welfare
LEAD: THE Kean administration is seeking support for a plan under which the state would assume the counties' share of the administrative costs for the state's welfare system.

Yanks Look Closely at Braves' Blauser
LEAD: Every time they walk by, Jeff Blauser hears their friendly gibes.

Today, they wondered if he were taking batting practice with them or with the

Now he would have the money to pursue the big American company he had his eye on.

The Rev.
Peter B. Grandy performed the ceremony at the Asylum Hill Congregational


The Glory of Tara Will Never Fade
LEAD: WHEN ''Gone With the Wind'' premiered in Bridgeport 50 years ago, it took me two weeks to persuade my mother to take me with her to see it.
She and all of her friends were in various stages of reading Margaret Mitchell's novel.
Unfortunately for me, Marion Bailey, among them, had finished it, and it was her cryptic four-word critique that sounded the death knell that nearly ruined my chance to view this spectacle at its first showing.


F.B.I. TELLS OF CLUE TO BOMBING OF VAN
LEAD: The Federal Bureau of Investigation said today that its evidence pointed to a pipe bomb as the device used in the explosion of a car driven by Sharon Lee Rogers, the wife of the captain of the Navy cruiser that mistakenly shot down an Iranian passenger jet in July.

FICTION
LEAD:  THE BOOK OF RUTH.
By Jane Hamilton. (Ticknor &amp; Fields, $18.95.) On the surface, it's classic tabloid fodder. ''Family Erupts in Violence: One Dead, One Injured, as Tot Looks On,'' the headline might read.

Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: So Strawberry is a bit of a baby.
Every fanatic fan is a bit of a baby (even I, a 64-year-old grandmother) - that is what makes us so crazy about baseball.
No way should Strawberry be traded.
Darryl generates excitement every time he comes to bat.
He has the capacity to elicit our wildest fantasies, sometimes less than heroic, he identifies us with our failures.


Review/Opera; Problems of the Heart, In Two Weisgall Works
LEAD: Like the short story, one-act operas require a concentration powerful enough to sustain single trains of thought over brief periods of time, rather than the long-range stamina needed to juggle many.
Hugo Weisgall - who was born in Czechoslovakia in 1912 and raised in Baltimore -has made something of a specialty of the genre.

Rome's Venerable Ghetto
LEAD: FROM A BELVEDERE ON THE JANICULUM -that most verdant of Rome's hills, bounded on one side by St.
Peter's and on the other by Rome and the world - the eye picks out, from among the gorgeous clutter of Roman roofs, two declarative edifices: the Pantheon, its gray rotunda looking from this perspective like a hovering spacecraft; and the great dome of the Temple, Rome's eclectic neo-Byzantine synagogue.


HOME ENTERTAINMENT/VIDEO: AND KEEP IN MIND
LEAD: Here are some of the most notable releases of the last few months.


'Students Are a Lot More Self-Concerned'
LEAD: THE average college student of the 1980's wants a secure, well-paying job with opportunities for promotion; his counterpart from the 1970's and 60's wanted to help mankind and change the world, said Douglas Daring, director of the Career Services Department at the University of Connecticut.


Rangers Drop Out Of First
LEAD: He was one of the rare Capitals to have got any practice in before the morning bomb scare cleared the building and ended the workout.
Dale Hunter had stood alone on the ice with a bucket of pucks, firing one after another from the slot into different corners of the empty net.


Oxford's Festive First of May
LEAD: CELEBRATIONS OF MAY DAY HAVE been a part of European folk culture for thousands of years.
Long before Communism made May 1 sacred with the trundling of military hardware through Red Square, Europeans have ritualized May as a festival of new beginnings, youth and love.


Launching on TV
LEAD: The launching of the space shuttle Discovery, scheduled for 8:07 A.M. tomorrow, will be televised live on Channels 2, 4 and 7 and on the Cable News Network.


TOUGH TALK FOR DEMOCRATS
LEAD: I am offended that Joseph A. Califano Jr. consistently equated the major social problems facing this country with blacks, in his article ''Tough Talk for Democrats,'' Jan. 8.
Poverty is not a race issue.
Crime is not a race issue.
Poor education is not a race issue.
The influence of unhealthful environments on otherwise healthy children is not a race issue.


Reviews/Dance; Exaltation In 'Sky Eye' By Dunn
LEAD: Douglas Dunn united the sacred and the secular in ''Sky Eye,'' the hourlong new work Douglas Dunn and Dancers presented last Sunday night at St.
Mark's Church.
Over the years, Mr.

Nancy Siegel Wed to Richard Jaffee
LEAD: The wedding of Nancy Ellen Siegel, a daughter of Barbara J. Siegel and Jesse S. Siegel, both of New York, to Richard Isadore Jaffee, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Stuart R. Jaffee of Worcester, Mass., took place last evening at the Starlight Roof of the Waldorf-Astoria.
Rabbi Stanley Davids officiated.
Hillary Levin, the bride's sister, was the matron of honor.


Concerts to Feature Young Performers
LEAD: Youth has its musical say at several concerts this week, starting this afternoon at 2:30 when Bushnell Hall's ''Winners Circle'' series presents Gary Schocker, a flutist who has already made his Philadelphia Orchestra debut.


THE PERFECT BABY?
LEAD: Last year I gave birth to a child with a diaphragmatic hernia, a defect that proved fatal.
We desperately wanted our baby to live, despite the fact that she would have faced major difficulties.
Yet, watching Emma suffer for six weeks convinced us that, had we known, prenatally, what lay ahead, the better course would have been abortion.


For Brunch, Try Something Unusual
LEAD: BREAKFASTING on oatmeal, high-fiber cold cereals or bran muffins might be acceptable during the week but those meals are too austere for a weekend brunch.


CHILDREN'S BOOKS: Bookshelf
LEAD: Additional titles of interest:

It was an automobile accident.





ITALIAN OPERA IN A LESS-THAN-GOLDEN AGE
LEAD: To put it mildly, ours is not a golden age for Italian opera.
Thus, as current recorded documentation reaches us, we should approach it with modest expectations.
It is with this sobering view that we greet new recordings of Rossini's ''Cenerentola'' and the three components of Puccini's ''Il Trittico'': ''Gianni Schicchi,'' ''Suor Angelica'' and ''Il Tabarro.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My vacation house is used a few times a year, but not enough to leave the heat on between visits.
To protect against freeze damage, I winterize the toilets and sink traps by pouring antifreeze into them each time I leave.
I am concerned about the effects this antifreeze has on the septic tank and the environment.


Diaper Plup - Out of the Garbage and Into the Garden
LEAD: Not all diaper service vendors think cloth is the only way to address disposal problems associated with throwaways.

LEAD: The State Supreme Court has upheld an order prohibiting a divorced woman from having an unrelated man stay overnight with her in her home when her children are present.

Second-Guessing The First Amendment

Rock Against Racism.


A CORRECTION

Miss Wood graduated from Worcester College of Oxford University.


CAMPUS LIFE: Yeshiva; 'Uncommon' Play, Uncommonly, Has No Parts for Men
LEAD: Yeshiva 'Uncommon' Play, Uncommonly, Has No Parts for Men Taking the man's part is something the Dramatic Society of Stern College for Women is willing to do when the script calls for it.
But this season the society has no such need: it is putting on a play that has roles only for women.


Donaldson Out
LEAD: James Donaldson, the Dallas Mavericks' center, will miss the remainder of the season to undergo surgery to repair a tendon in his right knee that was torn Friday night against Houston.
Donaldson averaged 9.1 points and 10.8 rebounds in 53 games.(AP)


Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: Internecine quarrels aside, what's a harmless little kiss?
Does Mozart compose without a family?
Does Picasso paint without being born?
And haven't we all seen the torture of being born to a violent wind?
New York lost an entire organization to L.A.
Must we lose Darryl Strawberry, too?

TV Outfits That Work in Real Life
LEAD: Television's version of the successful career woman, circa 1980, was a glamorous creature in a big picture hat, with huge diamonds sparkling at her ears and a fox boa draped around her neck.


Jennifer Shafer, Lawyer, to Wed B. R. Shachnow
LEAD: Dr. and Mrs.
Nathaniel Shafer of New York have made known the engagement of their daughter, Jennifer Anne Shafer, to Bart Robert Shachnow, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Leonard Shachnow of Rye, N.Y.
A June wedding is planned.


Stamps
LEAD: Hobbyists, especially younger ones, must listen to the standard speech by the fogies of philately about how educational stamp collecting is.


Kids and Commercials; In School: Subsidized News Is Worth a Test
LEAD: Does it subvert public education to show a daily video news program with commercials in high schools?
Whittle Communications says no.
The Tennessee-based company has launched a pilot project to give six high schools $50,000 worth of video equipment in exchange for showing ''Channel One,'' its 12-minute news program for teen-agers that includes two minutes of advertising.


Getting Around Fees on Singles
LEAD: FOR a person traveling alone, among the sour notes embedded in the small type of any tour brochure is the phrase ''single supplement.'' The supplement is the extra charge that the tour operator imposes upon a person occupying a room alone on a tour where double occupancy - two in a room - is the standard.


Actor Well After Heart Bypass
LEAD: Carroll O'Connor, who played Archie Bunker on the television series ''All in the Family,'' was reported ''doing well'' after a coronary bypass operation at Emory University Hospital today.

The Twain Are Meeting On the World's Opera Stages

LEAD: TWO farmers in plaid shirts sat quietly through the entire meeting, just in front of Jan Thompson from the Save Our Swamp group of Paterson, an organization that was formed to defend a wetland called Dismal Swamp.

Free-Agent Deals: There's Still Time

The Jets have signed 3 players and lost 3 of their 27 free agents.
The Giants have lost 2 of their 27 and have signed none.


Ideas as Ammunition in the French Revolution
LEAD: Presenting a whole series of exhibitions, movies, lectures, colloquies and (not least) a dance performance to mark the bicentennial of the French Revolution, the New York Public Library has grasped a nettle that other institutions have so far approached with leather gauntlets (if at all).
It took thought, and care, and courage.


Variety Spices Creativity for The Feld Ballet
LEAD: The Feld Ballet has had an especially creative season, thanks to new works by Eliot Feld, its director, and to a new-found freedom that has spurred a high expressivity in the dancers.


New Study Finds the Poor Getting Poorer, Younger and More Urban

Dukakis, Out of U.S. Limelight, Fights 'No New Taxes' Again
LEAD: ''A chief executive has got to lead,'' Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis said, speaking about himself and also, inevitably, about the man who beat him for the Presidency four months ago. ''You have to lay it out there, come in with a plan, take the hits.''


A List of Repairs For New York City
LEAD: NEW YORK CITY has started taking inventory.
Last November, city voters overwhelmingly approved what seemed to be a simple, not to say obvious, notion: a requirement that officials take an accounting of the badly aging infrastructure of roadways, bridges, parks and buildings, and draw up a plan for regular maintenance.


House for Sale: A Neighbor's Anxiety
LEAD: A BRIGHT blue Escort slowed, then stopped in front of the realtor's For Sale sign.
It stayed long enough for a closer look at the house, certainly long enough for jotting down the realtor's telephone number.
I could not see how many people were in the car, but I began to imagine just what sort they were.


CALL MY AGENT!
LEAD: Trip Gabriel's article ''Call My Agent!'' (Feb. 19) confirms my most depressing fears about the Byzantine world of book publishing, and about any naive hopes I may have had of becoming a published author.
Break-even points, bottom lines, last dollars, seven-figure sales - all of this sounds very much like the ''only big hits'' frenzy that has resulted in the demise of


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD: Cats as Cats Can WHEN show dogs win enough points they become Champions.

Tokyo
LEAD: To the Editor: Upon returning from a recent trip to Tokyo I was delighted to read Jared Lubarsky's ''Exploring the Heart of Old Tokyo'' (Travel, Oct. 23).
Travelers should know that they can stay in the Asakusa View, a Western-style hotel in Asakusa adjoining the Asakusa Kannon Temple.
The hotel has an attraction no other hotel in Tokyo offers: a huge wooden bath on the top of the building overlooking the Shitamachi section of the city.

A Diver's Map of Bermuda: Here There Be Treasures
LEAD: WHAT IS THIS THING?
A ship, you say?
Well, no.
Not anymore.
Once she was a ship, a few centuries ago.
Now she looks like something that spent a hundred years in a food processor and another hundred in a trash compactor.
She must have struck the reef over there and slid off into this sand hole and stuck, all of her, and wallowed and worked and rocked back and forth under the force of tide and current and countless storm seas, vanishing into the living coral and beneath the shifting sand until, back in 1983, a sharp-eyed Bermudian spotted an anomaly on the bottom and decided to investigate.

Kids and Commercials; At Home: Protest Tasteless TV? Of Course.
LEAD: ''Married . . .
With Children'' is a tasteless show about a moronic family given to suggestive experiences and vulgar language.
Even so, the half-hour sitcom, shown Sundays at 8:30 P.M., is Fox Broadcasting's top-rated series.
What, considering the literary level of most television series, is wrong with that?

Question of the Week; Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?
LEAD: Trade Strawberry as soon as possible.
Ship him to the American League, the Rangers or Mariners.

NAT BOYNTON  Delmar, N.Y.

For Young Executives, 'Free' Travel Is Fun (for a While)

FROM DICKENS TO BECKETT IN GRAND CENTRAL
LEAD: ''How picturesque they are, the missed trains!'' This line by the 19th-century poet Jules Laforgue set the tone for much of the modern poetry that followed him.

Two Keys, Two Moods Off Sarasota

A Permanent Home for No. 1
LEAD: Frank Gagnon was more spy than scout, his chores more those of surveillance than evaluation.

Rain Is Late, but Now Hope Flowers
LEAD: March came in like a lion, lashing California with rains from the Oregon border to the Mexican border and blanketing the Sierra Nevada with new snow.

Relief for Foreign Debtors, at Last
LEAD: Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady uttered the magic words last week: ''debt reduction.'' He conceded that third world countries, heavily in debt to Western banks, needed relief.

Make More Goods and Prices Will Fall
LEAD: After nearly eight years of overcapacity, the American rust belt has revived.
The upturn is the first decent chance in several years for American companies to gain ground on their foreign competitors.
The question now is whether this upturn will only be a short-lived illusion - or whether American companies can use this breathing spell to improve their competitive position.

Around Town, 'Slaves of New York' Do the Party Circuit
LEAD: Most of the characters in the new film ''Slaves of New York'' probably never went to Bloomingdale's, but that is where their real-life counterparts were last Tuesday night for cocktails, to benefit the New York Preservation League.

Reviews/Music; Bach's 'St. John Passion,' With a Few Additions
LEAD: A special point of interest in the performance of Bach's ''Johannespassion'' at St.
Thomas Church Tuesday night was the inclusion of five numbers added to the work in 1725, two years after its first performance.
They have been made easily available to performers within the past decade by their appearance as an appendix to the Barenreiter edition of the score, but have not been generally adopted; this listener had never heard them in a performance of the complete ''Passion.


Bigger Den for Lions
LEAD: Pennsylvania State University's Board of Trustees yesterday approved plans to add nearly 10,000 seats to Beaver Stadium and $2 to the price of football tickets for the Nittany Lions' games.

With Soviet Weapons to Lean On, Kabul Is No Pushover
LEAD: RESIDENTS of Kabul had little trouble waking last week.
Shortly before dawn on most mornings, a noise like a giant thud echoed across the Afghan capital, followed by a roar that rapidly faded away.
The sound would be repeated before quiet returned, and then on sporadic occasions later in the day.


TALKING: Gardens; Planning Plots for Condos
LEAD: A DRAWBACK to suburban condominium living, in contrast to owning a one-family house with a backyard, is the limited opportunity for gardening.
Those who seem to feel the loss most, managers report, are older people who have spent a lifetime tending a favorite plot at a former home.


New Yorkers Strengthen Seton Hall
LEAD: Six years ago, when they first met as teammates for New York's Riverside Hawks in the church league, John Morton and Gerald Greene were high school juniors with a penchant for playing fancy and footloose basketball.


Air Fares
LEAD: To the Editor: Regarding first-class air fares: I bought a round-trip ticket to San Francisco, coach fare, for $284.
I had asked for a business-class fare and was told there was none from San Antonio to San Francisco.
First class would have been about $1,300 at that time, but now I understand that if space is available you can get a ''coach upgrade'' to first class for $860.


Arizona Stops Clemson
LEAD: Arizona, ranked No. 1 in the last regular-season Associated Press poll, held Clemson scoreless for more than nine minutes today and beat the Tigers, 94-68, to advance to the semifinals of the N.C.A.A.
West Regional.


Wurstel
LEAD: To the Editor: Regarding the Fare of the Country (Travel, Feb. 5), Austria's favorite Wurstel is likely these days to be loaded with MSG, which the Viennese seldom label as glutamate but rather as Geschmackverstarker or taste strengthener.
Those allergic to this chemical should avoid the street stalls; when buying at groceries, check the product's ingredients.


Out-Patient Surgery Is Making Gains
LEAD: AT 7 A.M. on a recent day, a 70-year-old woman from Tarrytown walked into the ambulatory-surgery unit at Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in North Tarrytown.
At 3 P.M. she walked out.
Only the patch over her right eye revealed that she had undergone a one-and-a-half-hour operation to remove a cataract and implant a lens in her eye.


Social Events
LEAD:  Party at the Plaza


POSTINGS: Condos for Maplewood; Tall Story
LEAD: After three years of local protests and several lawsuits had tried and failed to halt it, a 10-story condominium tower is rising in Maplewood, N.J., adjacent to the 2,000-acre South Mountain Reservation, one of the few large open spaces left in Essex County.
Called ''The Top,'' the residential tower will be the highest structure in the immediate area along the boundary between Maplewood and South

Under Siege, N.R.A. Fights 'The Hysteria'
LEAD: The gun museum on the ground floor of the National Rifle Association's headquarters here is very calm, or as calm as any place can be that features displays of double-barrel shotguns, bolt-action rifles, toggle-breach semiautomatics, Smith &amp; Wesson .44 magnums, pocket Derringers, British muskets, Japanese ceremonial guns, Bowie knives, powder horns, boar and lion heads and a prize photograph of a woman with a large snake around her neck.

Limiting the Arms That Citizens May Bear
LEAD: ACTIONS last week in California and Washington against assault rifles left the forces for and against gun control wondering whether the balance of power between them had shifted, perhaps opening the way for approval of other state and Federal restrictions.


The Roof's No Limit for Britain's Thatchers
LEAD: Christopher White hoisted a bundle of Norfolk reeds and climbed to his rooftop workplace, repeating a timeless ritual in the ancient craft of thatching, which after decades of decline has dramatically revived in recent years.


The Vatican and the American Ways
LEAD: THE room where Pope John Paul II and his chief aides met earlier this month with 36 American Catholic cardinals and archbishops is austere, its brick walls adorned only with a crucifix.
Now known as the Old Synod Hall, the Vatican chamber was once a storage room for fragments of Greek and Roman statuary, and was called the Hall of Broken Heads.

POSTINGS: Expansion in L.I. City; Warehousing Art
LEAD: Twenty years ago, E. William Judson opened a real estate office on the East Side of Manhattan and began leasing space for the many midtown galleries that sprang up as New York became the art capital of the world.
As he leased more and more space for galleries, he noted that the typical gallery used half its space for storage, making such storage increasingly expensive as rents shot up.


A Wooden Nickel in The Tin Cup
LEAD: It should have been easy to predict a few decades ago, when American symphony orchestras and opera companies first began to rattle their tin cups and plead for government aid, that majority taste would eventually affect and probably erode their artistic independence.
Why not?
The prime business of a democratic government is to discover what most people want and try to please them.


Bringing Jobs and Housing Closer - By Force if Necessary
LEAD: LIKE runoff from the mountain snow pack, the cars begin to seep into the freeways as the morning sun rises over Southern California.
Soon tiny creeks converge into rivers of moving steel, carrying workers from the remote inland reaches of the state to jobs in Los Angeles and Orange County.

Correction
LEAD: A picture caption last Sunday about the Fifth Annual New York Flower Show misidentified the display shown.
It was produced by Larchmont (N.Y.) Nurseries Inc., not by China.


WHAT'S DOING IN: New Delhi
LEAD: The scholar Percival Spear, who devoted more than 50 years to the study of India, had a special fascination for New Delhi, which he called ''the stop-go capital.'' He meant that the city had an unusually uneven and protean history, changing its face, its ethnic composition, its religious character and its role as a subcontinental metropolis from century to century or decade to decade.

NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY

Render Unto Caesar . . .
LEAD: To the Editor:


Football Returns to S.M.U., but Not as King
LEAD: The symbolism did not escape Forrest Gregg.
The 55-year-old craggy-faced Texan, who still has a twang after all those years playing and coaching pro football in the Midwest, leaned back in his chair in the temporary coach's office in a trailer outside Ownby Stadium and listened to the sounds outside.


Penny Paul to Wed in August
LEAD: Virginia M. Paul of New York has made known the engagement of her daughter, Penny, to Michael Edward Moran, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward M. Moran of Weston, Conn.
An August wedding is planned.


RIO IS THE CARNIVAL OVER?
LEAD: THE CARIOCAS, AS THE NATIVES OF Rio de Janeiro are known, have marvellous qualities - an infectious joie de vivre, a refined sense of the ridiculous, the most sophisticated and beautiful popular music in the world - but the ability to handle money isn't one of them.
So it came as no surprise to learn last fall that the city had declared bankruptcy.


Jersey Man Kills Girl, 10, And Shoots 2 More Children
LEAD: A former mental patient shot and killed a 10-year-old girl and critically wounded two other children here this afternoon, before being killed in a gun battle with a police officer, authorities said.
The officer was also wounded, but not critically.


Black Artists, Past and Present
LEAD: CURRENTLY, the art at Art at 100 Pearl Street is by African-Americans.
It is an awkward way of introducing an exhibition, but then Art at 100 Pearl is both the name and the address of the branch recently opened in Hartford by the Connecticut Gallery of Marlborough.
Besides, the show itself is awkward, for it spans the last 100 or so years, yet numbers only 26 painters and sculptors and, hence, is less a survey of the black contribution to


Filling Out Tax Forms: It's Still A Chore
LEAD: ''YOU don't do your own plumbing, do you?
So why do you insist on doing your own taxes?'' a friend has asked me repeatedly.


A May Wedding For Miss Ponvert And Peter Judge

Jeremy G. Judge of New York and Roxbury, Conn.
The couple plan to marry in May.


The Military Prepares for (Relative) Austerity
LEAD: BY taking the oath as Secretary of Defense last week, Dick Cheney entered a Pentagon that has undergone a transformation since the heady days of the early 1980's when President Ronald Reagan delivered a series of ever fatter military budgets.
Unlike Mr.
Reagan's first Defense Secretary, Caspar W. Weinberger, President Bush's first Pentagon chief will preside over a department that can count only on the prospect of budgets that are lean by the standard of the

Marinades and Herbs Enhance the Flavor of Fish
LEAD: WHEN it is absolutely fresh - straight out of the water - there is nothing better than fish cooked plain, brought sizzling to the table and served with a piece of lemon.
But the fish we buy is not always that fresh.
There are many ways to enhance its flavor, however, with fresh herbs like thyme or tarragon, or a marinade of soy sauce, spices and ginger.


Grace N. Kooper Plans to Marry David Johnson

Burton L. Johnson of Tacoma, Wash.


Spouting Off
LEAD: ONE WANTS TO CALL IT A TEMpest in a very large teapot.
Or maybe a controlled weather experiment.
What it is, basically, is a 17-foot-high artificial tornado - a sculpture, of sorts, that will be publicly on display beginning next Saturday at the New York Hall of Science, one of the remaining buildings from the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens.


GENERAL DESCRIBES SOVIET RIFT ON WAR
LEAD: The Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan in 1979 over the objections of the military's General Staff, a Deputy Defense Minister said in a magazine interview published today.


NONFICTION
LEAD:  SHEEP FROM THE GOATS: Selected Literary Essays.
By John Simon. (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, $24.95.) Gore Vidal once called John Simon a ''literary gangster,'' adding that there was nothing Mr.
Simon - best known for his trenchant theater reviews in New York magazine - could not ''find to hate.'' Yet as ''The Sheep From the Goats,'' a discerning, highly idiosyncratic collection of literary essays, attests, within the gangster lies an equally ferocious, uncompromising champion of literature.

LEAD: I FIRST CLIMBED HILL 229 as a Marine lieutenant commanding an infantry platoon during the Korean War.

But I was heady with excitement over the chance to view my old battleground, now part of the demilitarized zone between North and South


Prisoner Swallows Bedsprings
LEAD: A county court judge has ruled that doctors may remove 100 metal objects, including bedsprings and razor blades, from the stomach of a prison inmate, Carl E. Rhoades, 32 years old, without his consent.

Marinades and Herbs Enhance the Flavor of Fish
LEAD: WHEN it is absolutely fresh - straight out of the water - there is nothing better than fish cooked plain, brought sizzling to the table and served with a piece of lemon.
But the fish we buy is not always that fresh.
There are many ways to enhance its flavor, however, with fresh herbs like thyme or tarragon, or a marinade of soy sauce, spices and ginger.


A 'Ticking Bomb' but No Explosion
LEAD: When President Reagan found himself confronted last year with a proposal to require most employers to notify workers and local and state government authorities 60 days in advance of plant closings or major layoffs, he viewed it as such a burden on business that he vetoed the entire trade bill to which it was attached.


Reid Is Suspended

LEAD: Playing symphonic music in the living room defies the natural order of things.


SPIES &amp; THRILLERS
LEAD: Were it not for the general ebullience of the writing, the Lovejoy adventures by Jonathan Gash might be reading a little thin by now.
There is a great deal of formula writing in this popular series.
Usually the books start with Lovejoy broke and in trouble.
They end with him still broke and in even more trouble.


On Stage and Off, The Many Voices Of Mandy Patinkin
LEAD: Mandy Patinkin is blessed and cursed with the kind of acute sensitivity that makes many of his waking moments feel like matters of life and death.
In the current Public Theater production of Shakespeare's ''Winter's Tale,'' which opens on Tuesday, he plays a character who is even more bedeviled than he by overwhelming anxieties.


Belligerent Day For Mets, Jays
LEAD: The Mets were involved in three scuffles this afternoon and not even one of them was among themselves.


NASA SPIRITS SOAR AS SHUTTLE LANDS

An Art School That Also Taught Life

And it happens downtown, at the New York Academy of Art, at 419 Lafayette Street, which was set up as recently as 1981.

SUITS: A NEW TWIST
LEAD: Running from jammed airport terminals to leg-numbing flights, from cramped cabs to crowded conferences, can put a wrinkle in any man's schedule - not to mention his clothes.
In addition to the heat, haze and humidity of summer, basic business wear is to blame: A man in a dress shirt and tie has at least a dozen layers of cloth bound snugly around his neck.


Spotlight on Colorado State
LEAD: It happens every year as a few overlooked or lightly regarded teams from college basketball's boondocks are thrust into the spotlight during the national tournament.

In New Jersey's Race, The Principal Issues Are Taxes and Taxes

LEAD: Vimla Mehra, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, is getting ready for Holi, the most joyous of Northern Indian festivals, a Hindu rite of spring.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Every man and woman who has ever dated knows that the process is not simple.
If it's a blind date, a first date or one of the first dates, it boils down to a game of chance.
The other person may be pleasant and presentable, but that's no guarantee of anything.
Thousands of pleasant, presentable people are boring, pedestrian and erased from the mind as quickly as they disappear from view.


Dorothy Lands in the Strange Country of the Sports Arena
LEAD: Three weeks ago the Emerald City filled a hangar at Van Nuys Airport in southern California, and there were Munchkins everywhere.

IT'S KOSHER
LEAD: Beginning about a decade ago, a younger generation of Jews decided that there was no reason why they had to be masochistic to be observant when it came to the High Holy Days.
Many of them ba'alei teschuva (returnees to the faith), they were also sophisticated in matters of food and drink.
They refused to accept the viscous, sweet sacramental wine of their elders and demanded something better, or at least something more in tune with their modern tastes.

LEAD: For many busy men, exercise has become a little too much like work: getting up early, putting on the required clothes, traveling at least some distance, toiling alongside hordes of others and then returning home - exhausted.

Correction
LEAD: An article on page 10 of the Travel section today, about New Delhi, gives an incorrect telephone number for the Diplomat Hotel in some copies; the number should be 301-0204.

LEAD: The Jewish Museum is presenting, through April 2, an exhibition called ''Golem!
Danger, Deliverance and Art,'' in which artistic and popular-culture responses to the ancient golem legend are brought together.
A golem is a clay man brought to life through mystical incantation.

CAMPUS LIFE: Haverford; 'Suitcase Party' Offers an Escape From Gray Winter
LEAD: ''I love America,'' declared Sanjiv Mehta, a native of India who is a freshman here.

Reviews/Film Festival; Swindling in 'Jugglers'; Cotillion in 'Coming Out'
LEAD: At the end of an afternoon of tennis, four former Ivy League classmates, now middle-aged, their manners intact, sit on the lawn of a handsome old Long Island estate.

Low-born and Jewish, Lester has recently flown off to


Park Bandshell
LEAD: To the Editor:


NONFICTION
LEAD:  REFLECTING ON THINGS PAST: The Memoirs of Peter Lord Carrington. (Cornelia and Michael Bessie/Harper &amp; Row, $22.95.) Oh, to be an Englishman!
Or rather, to write like one.
Peter Lord Carrington is a man of his class and times - an aristocrat whose line began in the mid-17th century with one Thomas Smith of Nottingham, a draper who kept accounts for farmers.


GLASNOST WRITING: SON WHERE'S THE GOLDEN AGE?
LEAD: Imagine the freedom of suddenly being able to write what you think - after years of censorship, of suddenly being able to say the things you want to say instead of only the things the authorities will let you say - and you will have some idea of both the excitement and the difficulty of being a writer in the Soviet Union today.


Central America Negotiates on Its Own
LEAD: HOPES for peace and democracy in Central America are built on a series of agreements named for the obscure towns where they were signed.
The effectiveness of these accords has been questioned, particularly by United States conservatives who contend that the more recent ones omit some guarantees found in the earlier pacts.


Corporate Property - Where the Wild Things Are
LEAD: The broad acres surrounding E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company's textile fiber plant in Kinston, N.C., used to be mowed religiously, leaving a lawn that was beautifully manicured but a biological desert for animals and plants.

LEAD: TODAY, Christians observe Palm Sunday, and many will carry palm branches to commemorate the day that crowds greeted Jesus with palm branches as He rode into Jerusalem.

THE GUNS OF SALVADOR
LEAD: The Northern Ireland that James LeMoyne imagines as an analogue to El Salvador sounds like a dreadful place indeed: ''a permanent running sore, congenitally incapable of fully healing or being cured, short of the most radical measures.'' Fortunately, the real Northern Ireland bears no resemblance to Mr.


Tragedy of Abuse As Entertainment
LEAD: Perhaps Edith L. Ellenbogen  [ Letters, March 5 ]  did not read the article by Geraldine M. Fox (''Abuse on TV,'' Jan. 29), for which I wrote a comment.
The idea seems to be that networks are using abuse victims as drawing cards.
Talk shows use the tragedy of abuse as a form of entertainment.
Anyone who is unaware of this terrible suffering would have to be living in a cave.

2 Troupes Team Up for New Play
LEAD: PROPELLED by the common cause of social consciousness - and a creative cost-cutting method of play production - two of the state's newest small professional theater companies have joined forces in the world-premiere staging of a work about the conflicts surrounding independence for Puerto Rico.


A Program Returns to Church
LEAD: SEVEN enticements fill this afternoon's schedule, including the return of Music for a Sunday Afternoon to Tarrytown's Christ Episcopal Church.
This follows a brief hiatus during which, according to the artistic director, Dorothy Beach, ''We lost one piano, but finally found another.''


Pro Hockey; The Rangers Continue to Falter
LEAD: The magic left months ago, the confidence evaporated shortly thereafter and a steady stream of players vanished for varying periods due to injuries in the ensuing weeks.
With all that disappearing for the Rangers, it is hardly surprising that a chance at first place in the Patrick Division is fading fast as well.


'We're Concerned About Children'
LEAD: THE mother of four children, Roberta Willis of Salisbury became concerned about the possible effects of pesticide residue after her neighbor, the actress Meryl Streep, gave her a copy of a report by the National Resource Defense Council, a private environmental group in Washington, D.C.


The Dark Secret of Risotto Nero
LEAD: SHORT and long grain, polished white, natural brown, saffron yellow - Americans have become casual, even blase, about the variety of rice available at home and abroad.
In Italy, however, Europe's major rice-producing country, it is still possible to find an unexpected choice: black rice.


Oregon's High Desert On Display
LEAD: ON a perch at the High Desert Museum in Bend, Ore., 166 miles east of Portland, Mrs.
Thomas sits alert, her wide eyes blinking at regular intervals.
A loud screech from her neighbor, Owliver, makes her swivel her head to the left with an indignant look, then snap it back.
A muffled electronic buzz sounds from a perch across the room, and


Skiing
LEAD: To the Editor: Regarding Stanley Carr's ''Getting Your Family Out to the Slopes: A Primer'' (Practical Traveler, Jan. 8): As a relatively new, close to 40ish skier, I'd like to add a few suggestions.
Few beginners anticipate the sheer clumsiness of transporting ski equipment from parking lot to mountain, around the base area and back to the car.


Byron's Computer-Programmer Daughter
LEAD: To the Editor:


Kevin Zraly and Raymond Wellington - Wine Buyers
LEAD: Wine aficionados in the United States are faced with a staggering embarrassment of riches.
So many wines from around the world are available here one could spend a lifetime studying them.
Two young New Yorkers who do that, and in the process set wine trends in New York City and far beyond, are Kevin Zraly, 38, wine director for Inhilco, which runs Windows on the World and 21 other restaurants in the World Trade Center, and Raymond Wellington, 35, wine director for the New York Restaurant Group, in Manhattan, which includes Smith &amp; Wollensky, the Post House and the Manhattan Ocean


; Tall Ships and Modern Times
LEAD: ALL that the general public sees of the shipyard here in Greenport is the high wooden fence painted gray, which serves as a gallery wall to display large nautical artifacts of iron.
There are anchors, propellers, a winch and other curious and mysterious things.
Not junk, these, though old and rusty, but objets d'art, well spaced, resting on wood chips.

Remembering Paul Robeson
LEAD: To the Editor:


Madonna Re-Creates Herself - Again
LEAD: In ''Like a Prayer,'' the music-video and title song of an album that represents Madonna's convincing bid for recognition as a serious rock artist, the 30-year-old star has never looked more beautiful or sung with more feeling.
The songs, which deal directly and very emotionally with her failed marriage to the actor Sean Penn, her family, and her Catholic girlhood, transcend the brassy dance-pop of her three previous records to reveal


Cheney Acts Quickly to Put Personal Stamp on Defense
LEAD: Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has moved quickly to establish himself in the Pentagon, choosing the first of his aides, meeting today with President Bush and calling top military officials to a hurried budget conference.


On German Stages, a Society Explores Itself

LEAD: With a deadline less than a month away, a New York State utility official said Friday that the Public Service Commission is likely to approve rate increases that will lead to adoption of a plan to close the Shoreham nuclear power plant.


PASTIMES: Bridge
LEAD: A long-debated puzzle concerns the fact that at the highest levels of the game men are far more successful than women.
In more than half a century no woman has ever won an open world title, and very few have come close.
The pattern is similar in national championships, both in North America and other parts of the world.


Dr. Elizabeth Ann Almeyda to Wed Dr. George Vincent DiGiacinto May 7
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Eduardo Almeyda of Miami Beach have announced the engagement of their daughter, Dr.
Elizabeth Ann Almeyda, a plastic surgeon, to Dr.
George Vincent DiGiacinto, a neurosurgeon.
The couple plan to wed May 7.
The future bridegroom is a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Albert DiGiacinto of Yonkers.


Irish to Wear Red
LEAD: In the hotly competitive world of big-time college football, Notre Dame has always remained aloof from the controversial practice known as redshirting, extending selected players' careers by sidelining them during one of their first four seasons so they can play a fifth season.


Blind Prisoner Escapes, Takes Refuge in Home
LEAD: A blind convicted murderer and an accomplice who helped him escape from his prison guards were inside a suburban town house with two children today as the police ringed the building.
It was not clear whether the two men were holding the children hostage.


Deneuve, Depardieu And Happenstance
LEAD: A man.
A woman.
A deserted rest area by the side of a highway, where the man and woman meet by chance.
She (Catherine Deneuve) has been abandoned there by an abusive husband who has left her stranded, in her fur coat and fur hat and dark glasses, in the middle of the night.
He (Gerard Depardieu) has already been there for a couple of days, trying to fix the engine of his car, an engine that -symbolically, no doubt - will not go.


Izhar Patkin - Artist
LEAD: Last Thursday, Izhar Patkin left for Europe to make arrangements for showing the ambitious sculpture he has just completed - a life-size anodized aluminum piece entitled ''Don Quijote Segunda Parte'' that stands in his living room on the Lower East Side.


Trout Grow Big In a Wilderness In Labrador
LEAD: THE black flies were swarming, looking for a landing spot.
One went humming into my ear, another burrowed under an eyelid.
Several flew up my nose, and when I opened my mouth, five or six dived down my throat, causing me to choke and sputter.

Mario M. Cuomo and officials from the State University of New York say they are trying to tone down their unusually harsh clash over the Governor's proposed budget for the system.


124-81 Rout Restores Oklahoma
LEAD: Mookie Blaylock scored 34 points and Stacey King had 21 with 15 rebounds today as fourth-ranked Oklahoma beat Louisiana Tech, 124-81, in the second round of the N.C.A.A.
Southeast Regional.
The top-seeded Sooners (30-5) showed a spark that had been missing for several games as they advanced to the regional semifinals for the third straight year.


Jacob Den Hartog, 87; Led M.I.T. Department
LEAD: Jacob P. Den Hartog, professor emeritus and former head of the department of mechanical engineering at the Massachussets Institute of Technology, died Friday at the Hanover Terrace Healthcase Center in Hanover, N.H., where he lived.
He was 87 years old.


The Complex Art Of Egypt After the Pharaohs
LEAD: The imagery of copticart - owl-eyed women, plump birds, exotic beasts, pagan mythological figures and Christian symbols - comes alive in highly expressive tapestries, artifacts and stone sculpture produced in Egypt under the Romans and Byzantines.
Long overlooked by scholars and museum curators, this early Christian material is now the subject of an ambitious exhibition here at the Rhode Island School of Design's Museum of Art through


PASTIMES: Camera
LEAD: Canon has introduced a new single-lens-reflex camera that raises the ante on the notion that our cameras should know more than we do about how to take pictures.
Christened the Canon EOS 630, it also brings a new level of integration to the various and sundry automatic functions built into modern-day S


For Some Officials, the Revolving Door Turns Smoothly
LEAD: IF avoiding conflict of interest has become a Washington rite of passage, then Lawrence S. Eagleburger is the latest official to come of age.


In Kabul, Soviet Officials Make Themselves Scarce
LEAD: Until the last Soviet troops withdrew from the Afghan war, the Soviet presence in this capital was of imperial proportions.
But barely a month later, the last Soviet officials in Kabul are a forlorn sight, working in a fortress of an embassy and complaining of waning influence even with the Marxist rulers their forces came here to sustain.


Children Make the 60's New Again
LEAD: The generation gap may be narrowing, if children's accessories are any indication.
Youngsters are complementing their neon novelty wear with emblems of the 1960's.


Discovering The True Tragedy Of the Projects
LEAD: BECAUSE I am black, throughout my life I have expected acceptance in any black neighborhood I chose to roam.


Jury Appears Deadlocked in GAF Stock Manipulation Case
LEAD: After eight days of deliberation, the jury considering charges of stock manipulation by the GAF Corporation appeared deadlocked last night by a vote of 11 to 1 but agreed to return today to try again to reach a verdict.


Tenacious Princeton Defies Expectations
LEAD: To the athletes dressed in Princeton black and orange who find themselves somewhere between adolescence and middle age, the coach with the cigar in his mouth must seem as if he has been passing on the same principles since basketballs were directed into peach baskets.


ONE MAN'S ODYSSEY
LEAD: SAUL BELLOW'S Herzog, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, decides there's only one thing to do: head for the men's shops on Madison Avenue. ''Therefore, he went shopping for clothes.'' When I first encountered this passage, it scarcely registered.
It was the 1960's, and I was in college.
No one cared about clothes.


For the Mentally Ill, an Escape From 'Sheltered Workshops'
LEAD: Although much of the movement into the workplace has been by individuals with physical handicaps, people with mental disabilities are also starting to make progress.
And the growing number of placement programs designed for them is why.


Ray Madoff, a Lawyer, Weds David Nicholas
LEAD: Ray Dietz Madoff and David Andrew Nicholas, who received law degrees from New York University in 1984, were married last evening at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston.
Carl Perkins, a rabbinical student, officiated.


An Island Odyssey: From England to Big Apple to Long
LEAD: JUNE 8, 1961, was the auspicious day on which I arrived in New York City, a brand-new, green-as-grass, wide-eyed immigrant from England, come to seek my fortune.


Dog Lovers Plot in the Parks To Throw Away Their Leashes
LEAD: This was not ''Sunday in the Park With George.'' Rather, it was Wednesday in the park with Giorgio and the rest of the dogs.
It was a great, sweaty revel of dogs running free after dark in Central Park, of dog owners cheering them on, whistling, tossing out balls and generally behaving like country people.


RICHARD TAYLOR, PROFESSOR EMERITUS
LEAD: He waits until he's comfortable collecting his pension, but Richard Taylor does tell the truth - or at least part of it.


SLEEPING PILLS
LEAD: Though generally accurate and informative, the Body and Mind column ''Sleeping Pills'' (by Bruce H. Dobkin, Feb. 5) may have fallen victim to overzealousness in its attribution of Cindy Ehrlich's psychiatric symptoms to the use of Halcion and Xanax.


It's Spring. Go Balance an Egg.
LEAD: Assuming fair weather and enough spring fever, scores of people will gather tomorrow morning in the plaza at the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
At 10:29, the moment of the vernal equinox, they will attempt to stand eggs on end.
Many will succeed, in a small triumph of folklore over common sense, if not science.


The Time Has Come for Equitable Pay in All Professions
LEAD: WHILE driving home from work the other night on the Merritt Parkway, I was passed by a sleek red sports car.
I caught a glimpse of the driver's bumper sticker as she went by: ''Women run for office, not coffee.'' My sentiments exactly.


County Expands Meals for the Aged
LEAD: JANET TABERER, 66 years old, has been going to the Neighborhood Facility at Nelson Avenue in Peekskill every day for the last several years to get a hot lunch.
The hot-lunch program is one of several nutrition programs for the elderly sponsored by the County Office for the Aging.


In Other Towns, Memories of 1789
LEAD: IT began with peasant risings, went on to arson throughout the provinces and finally caused mass executions in several major cities: the French Revolution, in spite of the primacy of Paris, was very much a national affair.
Of course, not every city was as enthusiastic about the new order as the capital, but there is hardly a corner of France that did not participate in the great upheaval that ended the ancient regime.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Figure Skating  Ito Wins First Title for Japan: Midori Ito, a 19-year-old from Nagoya, put on a stunning display of jumping yesterday at the world championships in Paris to capture the first title ever for Japan.

Radar and Health: Additional Views
LEAD: This letter is in response to the well-written Feb. 5 article ''Woman's Fight Against Navy Radar Raises Health Issue.''


Tilden Defied Age and Time
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


PURE AND SIMPLE
LEAD: Eating Italian used to mean a bottle of red wine, a loaf of garlic bread and a thousand tomatoes over spaghetti and veal alike.
Then came the revolution.


RICHARD TAYLOR, PROFESSOR EMERITUS
LEAD: It is professors like Richard Taylor (Letters, Feb. 19, in response to ''Higher Education - The Real Crisis,'' by Michael I. Sovern, Jan. 22), who teach no more than five hours a week, never prepare their classes and have all papers read by graduate students, who have caused the enormous workload under which the rest of us labor.

Mr. Greenspan, Lower Rates Now!
LEAD: We cannot claim we have not been warned.
Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan has been unusually explicit for months.
The economy is at full capacity and inflation is rising.
There are only two ways to deal with this problem: raise interest rates or reduce the budget deficit.


From the 50's, a Series of Brushes With Greatness
LEAD: The 1950'S and abstract expressionism, the heroic painting style that put American art on the map, are ever with us.
Anyone with a passing interest in contemporary art can recite the great names of that bygone yet omnipresent era when Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman and others arrived.


BACK IN TIME
LEAD: TIME WAS, a man's watch was just a timepiece: classical, understated and functional.
Now watches tell a lot more than the time of day.
They seem to offer a number of clues about the men who wear them, and serve, at the same time, as conspicuous status symbols.
These days, more and more men concerned with quality as well as image are returning to the classic mechanical-movement watch of the past.


Versailles Recovers Its Gilded Glory
LEAD: FOR Americans who have not recently seen Versailles, this is the ideal year for a return visit, both because of celebrations marking the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution and the recent conclusion of a five-year, $70-million restoration.


Italy
LEAD: To the Editor: We were delighted to read ''A Town of Crystal and Old Artistry Near Florence'' (Travel, Jan. 8) about Colle di Val d'Elsa.
We found Colle by running low on gasoline, driving from Volterra to Florence in May 1984.
The medieval hill town contrasts with its newer city in the valley, and the rolling Tucson hills complement the modern and ancient structures.


Alan V. Davies, 47, Real-Estate Executive
LEAD: Alan V. Davies, president of the J. Clarence Davies real-estate concern in Manhattan, died of a heart attack Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital.
He was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.


TAILOR-MADE
LEAD: I was told to measure up, so I did.
But rather than shuffling off to shrink, shrine or spa, I went to meet my makers.
And in this material world, that meant suiter, shirter and shoer.
I admit that I'm too old to be a yuppie, and too young to be an old boy, but I do like nice things.
So when asked to venture on an odyssey into the world of custom-made clothing, I was more than ready to dress up my dressed-down appearance.


DEAR DR. KARL

LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  PURIM CELEBRATIONS  Purim, the joyous holiday that marks the deliverance of the Jews by Queen Esther from a general massacre plotted by the Persian Haman, is two days away, but Y.M.-Y.W.H.A.'s throughout Long Island are doing most of their lighthearted celebrating today.


No Way to Run the V. and A.?

Against the Wall
LEAD: What is 12 feet tall, 120 feet long and red, or at least rust, all over?
It is ''Tilted Arc,'' a curving steel wall by the sculptor Richard Serra that was at the center of a prolonged artistic battle.
The work, commissioned by the Federal Government in 1981, bisected a portion of Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan.


MY FATHER, MY FICTION
LEAD: A NOVEMBER DAY, 1988, and I am sitting in my study in our house in Princeton, N.J., as dusk comes on, listening to my father playing the piano in another wing of the house.
Flawlessly, he's moving through the presto agitato of Schubert's ''Erl King,'' striking the nightmarish sequence of notes firmly but rapidly.

Business Ignores Shoreham Realities
LEAD: Last week's Long Island Weekly contained a polemic by a member of the Association for a Better Long Island calling for the opening of the Shoreham nuclear power plant.
The association seems to argue that we should open Shoreham because the Long Island public will not accept the construction of alternative power plants in any neighborhood.


Thousands Gather in Bilbao To Ask Longer Basque Truce
LEAD: Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the Basque city of Bilbao today in a peace march that organizers and local politicians hailed as a turning point in the region's troubled recent history.


Reviews/Theater; Light Touch For the Book Of Revelation
LEAD: The Apocalypse of St.
John, or Book of Revelation, is a most dramatic book, filled with fiery beings, battles in Heaven, Lucifer plunging into hell, the four ravaging horsemen, the destruction of the world at Armageddon and the creation of a new universe.
Among other books of the Bible the nearest competitor is probably the Book of Daniel.


CAMPUS LIFE: Amherst; Prohibition Tried, But the Results Are Familiar
LEAD: It might have been called ''dry week,'' but life at Amherst College was as wet as usual last weekend.


Jennifer Drew Marries
LEAD: Jennifer Drew, a third-year law student at Fordham University, and George Mayer Stone, a partner in the real-estate investment firm of Solico in New York and Williamstown, Mass., were married last evening at Temple Israel in Lawrence, L.I.

About Long Island; The Video Yearbook
LEAD: THE 10 good-looking senior class girls doing a mean shimmy at Division Avenue High School in Levittown the other night will have a choice 20 years from now.


HOLLYWOOD'S UNCOMMON EVERYMAN
LEAD: GENE HACKMAN IS BEING PURSUED.
A man has been haranguing him, calling on the phone, leaving letters in his apartment-house lobby.
He wants Hackman as his ally, a comrade to help thwart a plot, something inscrutable about ''Hollywood borrowers.'' Hackman has been stalked before.
There was the quick-draw artist with the loaded revolvers in Alamagordo, N.M.; the Las Vegas drunk brandishing a .357 magnum; the rifleman in Seattle who left his gun case at the cast's hotel, but this time, the interloper is unusually persistent.


PASTIMES: Around the Garden
LEAD: For This Week: Daffodils, tulips and other spring-flowering bulbs are pushing up; apply fertilizer now so it is available to bulbs in summer when they will form flowers for spring, 1990.
Transplant seedlings to a one-one-one soil mixture.
Use rakes to clean up lawns and remove winter debris; add to compost pile.


QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Next Week; How Good A Job Has Ueberroth Done?
LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.
Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


Siena Is Beaten; Duke Advances
LEAD: Fortune looked fondly upon Siena College again this afternoon.
Then, just as suddenly as the Saints seized the lead with 13 consecutive points midway through the second half, fortune turned away.


For Readers, a New Social Chapter
LEAD: Books are drawing members of the ''me'' generation out of their urban solitude and into intimate discussion groups.
From recent college graduates to people a generation older, these readers are confounding the conventional wisdom that video has replaced vellum.


RICHARD TAYLOR, PROFESSOR EMERITUS
LEAD: Richard Taylor's claim that his case is ''fairly typical'' is a gross libel on his colleagues.

SLEEPING PILLS

In fact, Dalmane has the longest half life (the time it takes for half of the drug to be metabolized by the body) of any of the benzodiazepines, or 40 to 200 hours.
This means that the drug accumulates in the body when taken regularly, especially in the elderly.

A Rite of Passage for a 4-Year-Old Girl
LEAD: IT is 10 o'clock and Andrea has the first appointment of the day.
We're on time but it's a miracle we got here at all.

To Look at the Hits Is Often to See the Misses
LEAD: There can be no easier way of feeling culturally disenfranchised than to insist on seeing the most popular film in the nation each week, whatever it may be.
Reading everything on the fiction best-seller list might offer a comparable shock, but it could never match the immediacy of a really bad (as is so often the case) hit film.


ORDEAL ON I-80
LEAD: Jay Belsky gives the impression that the safest course of action in an accident is to remain in the car (About Men: ''Ordeal on 1-80,'' Feb. 19).
As a trauma surgeon, I have seen countless injuries sustained by people who stayed in a disabled vehicle.

Park Bandshell
LEAD: To the Editor:


Bitter Harvest: AIDS and the Arts
LEAD: It would hardly be an exaggeration to describe American culture in the late 1980's as art in the era of AIDS.
Art has confronted AIDS the way people confront AIDS - with fear, anger, sorrow, defiance and confusion.
In a country that idolizes youth and health, AIDS has struck at the very heart of the American self-image.


Reviews/Music; Strings, Winds, Percussion and Computer
LEAD: The New York New Music Ensemble's Wednesday-evening performance at Merkin Concert Hall began with two older scores that have not lost their shine.
Peter Maxwell Davies's ''Antechrist'' (1967), a set of inventive and colorful variations on a 13th-century motet, and Henry Cowell's amusing ''Set of Five'' (1951), with its lyrical violin line, propulsive piano part and exotically varied percussion component, served as light-spirited appetizers.

CAMPUS LIFE: Dartmouth; Trying to Shed The Image Of 'Animal House'

Indeed, the Greek Rush now taking place at Dartmouth will be the last of its kind here.


Fuzzy Laws Help Blur the Boundaries
LEAD: Are financial professionals mostly greedy, dishonest people who came to the business ready to rip off the system?

LEAD: THE Metropolitan Museum of Art is putting into place the last element of its master plan of 1970 - a second garden court.

Wagner in Bits And Pieces
LEAD: Until the LP arrived, most Wagnerites knew his work only in discontinuous form, either from the chunks served up at orchestral concerts or in drastically condensed versions available on bulky 78-r.p.m. disks.
These fragmented performances were often pieced together from a bewildering variety of sources.


In 'Brewster Place,' Women Lead the Way
LEAD: Let's hear it for women.
That worthy sentiment comes through heartily in ''The Women of Brewster Place,'' the four-hour television movie being broadcast on ABC tonight and tomorrow, beginning at 9 each night.

Paranoia: Fearful Delusions
LEAD: MY WIFE and I purchased our home from the estate of a woman who had recently died.
All we knew about her was that she had been an elderly widow.
Yet you could tell that her last years had not been happy ones.
One clue was the heavy steel doors she had had installed front and back.
The front door was equipped with an apartment-style peephole, which was needed because she had had the windows in and around the door covered over with contact paper.

And she wants one of her own
She's waited long enough, she says
And still he can't decide
Pretty soon she'll have to choose
And it tears her up inside
She's scared
Scared to run out of time.

LEAD: American auto makers have rung up six years of strong profits, including a record $11.2 billion for 1988.

Where Value Is a Specialty of the House
LEAD: OF all the questions posed to a restaurant critic, the most typical is: ''Can you suggest a really nice place for dinner: good food, a lively ambiance, efficient service, and it shouldn't be too far off in the boondocks?
Oh yes, it has to be inexpensive.''

LEAD: A former president and chairman of the United Orient Bank in Manhattan was sentenced to probation and fined $25,000 yesterday for masterminding a scheme to launder $18 million.


New System to Deliver TV Spots by Satellite
LEAD: If the growth of the ''unwired network'' has challenged the traditional networks in the race for advertisers, a new satellite delivery system for ads will turn up the heat another notch.

Private East Berlin Shops
LEAD: More than 40 percent of the stores in East Berlin are privately owned or operated, but the shops account for only 9 percent of the city's retail trade volume, the official East German press agency said today.
The city's 1,731 private shops and hundreds of itinerant traders sold goods worth 1.1 billion marks ($590 million) in 1987, up from 876 million marks ($470 million) in 1980.

On a Friendly Street, Suspect Is Called Aloof
LEAD: When he was growing up, there was little to set Robert Golub apart from the other children of Horton Road, a tiny, friendly street tucked in a corner of this Nassau County village.
He haunted the usual haunts with his high school friends; his passion was lifting weights at the gym on Merrick Road.


Islanders Survive a Close One; End Streak
LEAD: The game was a tenuous one, with the Islanders, a team unaccustomed to grooming, much less sitting upon, small leads, in possession of a 2-1 advantage heading into the third period.
At tenuous times of late, the Islanders were the club used to getting close and then getting beaten by tiny margins: they knew they had to handle this lead gingerly, but not so cautiously as to relinquish it.


General Cinema
LEAD: The General Cinema Corporation completed the sale of its soft-drink bottling unit to Pepsico Inc. for $1.78 billion, producing a pretax gain of $1.4 billion.

U.S. Judges, Held Hostage
LEAD: Chief Justices of the United States are not given either to holding news conferences or crying wolf.

7.8% Inflation in Britain
LEAD: Britain's annual inflation rate jumped to an unexpectedly high 7.8 percent in February, from 7.5 percent in January, largely because of rising mortgage rates, the Government said today.

Jets Sign Linebacker
LEAD: The Jets, who are seeking help at outside linebacker, yesterday signed Jackie Walker, a new free agent, to bolster that position.
The 6-foot-5-inch, 255-pound Walker was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' second-round draft choice in 1986 and played three seasons for them.
On Feb. 1, the Bucs left him unprotected, which meant he could sign with any other National Football League team by April 1.


And There Are Decent Wines That Aren't Indecently Priced
LEAD: FINDING the perfect little restaurant can be tough; finding one with the perfect little wine list is even tougher.
Face it: a small restaurant, almost by definition, has to have a relatively short wine list.
A place with 30 tables simply can't afford to tie up capital by buying and holding large stocks of wine: it costs too much, there may not be any place to store it and there probably won't be enough guests to drink it.


Carter and His Knee Face Test

St. John's Wins by 83-80 To Advance to Semifinals

John's coach experienced tonight at Ohio State, when the Redmen beat the Buckeyes, 83-80, in overtime in the quarterfinals of the National Invitation


U.S. Voices Dismay on Release of Hijacking Warning
LEAD: Bush Administration officials today expressed distress at the disclosure of a hijacking warning to American airlines in Europe.

LEAD: The first art completed for a Government building in New York City since Richard Serra's ''Tilted Arc'' in 1981 is a far cry from the confrontational steel sculpture that was removed from Federal Plaza in downtown Manhattan last week.
The new works are much smaller and gentler than ''Tilted Arc.''

The Mystical Enigma That Is Arvo Part
LEAD: When Arvo Part's music was first performed in New York, less than a decade ago, the temptation was to think of the Estonian emigre composer as a Minimalist.
Works like ''Tabula Rasa'' and ''Fratres,'' the first of his scores to gain any currency in this country, were solidly, unequivocally tonal, and they used repetition as a central structural element.

Review/Opera; First 'Walkure' Of Met Season
LEAD: For anyone who believed in signs and portents, the season's first ''Walkure'' at the Metropolitan Opera had to be a cheerful event.
The performance on Friday evening, first of three in the final weeks leading up to the company's long-awaited presentations of Wagner's complete ''Ring'' in proper sequence, went smoothly enough to suggest that the cycle may be rounding into shape at just the right time.


CLASH AT DARTMOUTH

FASHION: On the Street; High Hemlines, For Those Who Can
LEAD: The issue of the short skirt has come down (up?) to a simple matter of choice: Take it or leave it.
But either way, don't worry.
You can still keep your department store charge cards and no one will revoke your subscriptions to fashion magazines.
For the most part, the takers appear to be younger women whose figures allow them to wear the shorter lengths without a trace of self-consciousness.


N.H.L/Friday's Games; Capitals Impress Themselves
LEAD: Pete Peeters, the Washington Capital goalie, had seen only one performance like this before.


Still the Nevilles, But Reaching Out For a Pop Audience
LEAD: In many ways, the story of the Neville Brothers of New Orleans, who have just released ''Yellow Moon'' (A&amp;M 5240; all three formats), is also the story of the tension in American society between the outsider and mainstream culture.
The Neville Brothers - Art, 51, Charles, 50, Aaron, 48, and Cyril, 41 - are part of New Orleans's most important postwar pop musical dynasty, a family steeped in both the Mardi Gras culture of the city, as well as its pop music-making side, which at best has had an off-and-on-again flirtation with the American music business.

A Boy's Best Friend Is His Llama
LEAD: ''WHEN'S the llamas' bedtime?'' was the first question our son, Jacob, asked as we started our trek into the Eagle Cap Wilderness Area of eastern Oregon.

DEFICIT FIGURING DOESN'T ADD UP
LEAD: In Charles R. Morris's article (''Deficit Figuring Doesn't Add Up,'' Feb. 12), there are three graphs along with the statement that the Federal deficit, expressed as a percentage of the gross national product, is not a great deal higher than it was in the mid-1970's.

John H. Hax of Trumbull, Conn., have announced May wedding plans for their daughter Katherine Heileman Hax and Bradford Jameson Holmes, a son of Elizabeth Parsons Holmes of Winchester, Mass., and Canaan Valley, W.Va., and the late David Bullard Holmes.


DEFICIT FIGURING DOESN'T ADD UP
LEAD: Curiously, the graphs accompanying Mr.
Morris's essay include some inexplicable anomalies.
In the graphs, the dollar value of the deficit is expressed as a positive number; therefore, the quotient of the deficit divided by the G.N.P. must also be a positive number, because, by definition, the value of the G.N.P.


TV Trivializes The Mind
LEAD: To the Editor:


Home Buying Is an Official Cause Again
LEAD: SINCE the 1930's, the Federal Government has from time to time adopted programs and policies aimed at encouraging home ownership.

LEAD: THE killer, the victim - maybe, even the corpse - could be seated at your table.
During the new Friday night murder-mystery series at the Spinning Wheel Inn, in Redding Ridge, the audience and the cast mingle in what may well be the most informal sampling of environmental or participatory theater yet.


A Bristol Visit Anchored In the Past
LEAD: MY favorite spot in Bristol is the damp, cobbled floor of the Great Western Drydock.
From down there, hemmed in by stone walls fitted almost a century and a half ago, amid mossy puddles, a voluptuous sweep of red-orange hull looms above.
The hull belongs to the Great Britain; launched in 1843, she was the fist iron-hulled, propeller-driven trans-Atlantic liner - in fact, the first such vessel to cross any ocean.


. . . And From Washington
LEAD: To the Editor:


CAMPUS LIFE: Illinois; Students 'Dying' In Opposition To Nuclear Arms

His Party Aside, Giuliani Has an Edge
LEAD: EVERY quarter century or so, a combination of an unpopular Democratic Mayor and an attractive Republican challenger has managed to break the Democratic stranglehold on New York's City Hall.

The Aging Eye
LEAD: WHEN MY 4-YEAR-OLD THRUSTS her latest drawing in front of me, I seem to grow older on the spot.
I take my daughter's hand, push it and her picture back away from my nose, stretch my neck backward a couple of inches, and peer.
At the age of 35, I am encountering one sign of age that no amount of exercise or high-fiber foods or Retin-A can forestall.


POSTINGS: 43d St. Photo Gallery; Home Again On 6th Ave.
LEAD: When the 42-story office building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas was completed 20 years ago, the Eastman Kodak Company opened a three-tier photography exhibition hall there and its varied exhibits became a popular diversion for New Yorkers passing the West 43d Street corner of the building.
After a few years Kodak gave up the space because it was not providing the promotion benefit that had been anticipated, and for several years it was used as an exposition center for

LEAD: ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL men in the American Roman Catholic Church is hosting his own weekly talk show from his residence behind St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
His study, with its striking stained-glass windows, has been converted into a television studio, the bookcases and sofa moved out and replaced by three cameras and batteries of tall and hot lights.


Reliving the Simple Joys of Stickball
LEAD: part of the fun, I admit, was the challenge of seing whether it could actually be done.
The university had a faintly outlined stickball ''plate'' on the wall of the Fine Arts Plaza.
And, in my two years at Stony Brook, I had actually seen several students on the field.
What if I wanted to play stickball again?


Permanent Lent
LEAD: Easter celebrates resurrection and renewal.
It also marks the end of Lent, 40 weekdays of fasting and special penitence when millions of Christians forsake the sinful pleasures of the palate and the perils of strong drink and nicotine, and give themselves over to abstinence of all kinds.

Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Car

Pedestrians applaud.
Diners gather at restaurant windows.
Around New York, Eric Staller's ''Lightmobile'' (right) is a little bit famous.
Ever since its maiden voyage in 1985, the Volkswagen beetle with its ebullient adornments - 1,659 light bulbs, computer-controlled and capable of flashing in 25 different patterns - has effervesced regularly all over town, wreaking a pleasant sort of havoc wherever it goes.


Keep Profit Motive Out of High School Sports

Mary Johnstone of Newport, R.I.


NONFICTION
LEAD:  LORD NELSON: The Immortal Memory.
By David Howarth and Stephen Howarth. (Viking, $24.95.) A danger in retelling the life of a national hero is that the subject's virtues often are inflated and his shortcomings diminished.
Thus, in ''Lord Nelson,'' an unguardedly affectionate biography of Britain's most notable mythologized naval hero, conspicuous character deficits - cynicism, vanity, decadence, infantilism and cruelty - are largely dismissed, defended or recast as attributes.


PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: The late great Estonian Paul Keres used to say: ''I like to play opposite from my opponent.
If he wants a positional game, I will strive to make it tactical; if he wants a tactical struggle, I will strive to make it positional.''


Why Seek The Sound Of the Past?
LEAD: The early-music movement, once the domain of antiquarian scholars and minimally skilled dilettantes, has been gathering professional momentum for decades.
It is now a small steamroller, if not a juggernaut.
The movement has spawned a new generation of well-trained musicians who play their instruments well and proselytize for correct performance practices with evangelical zeal.


CONNECTICUT GUIDE
LEAD:  THE COMPLETE 'PEER GYNT'  The Hartford Stage Company will perform the uncut ''Peer Gynt,'' Henrik Ibsen's fantasy based on the Norse legend of a young man's wanderings through universal perils and pleasures.

LEAD: To the Editor: Reading Ron Nowicki's article ''Yes, There Is No Free Lunch'' (Travel, Jan. 29) brought back memories of a similar experience my late wife and I had in October 1969, except that it took place in Rome.
We were among the thousands in the crowd in St.
Peter's Square after the Pope's Sunday noon balcony appearance and blessing.


Power Panaceas Are a Delusion

Review/Cabaret; Marti Stevens and Memories
LEAD: Marti Stevens is one of a handful of veteran nightclub performers who evoke the kinder, gentler Manhattan of another era.
Indeed, that world seems so far in the past that one might question whether it ever really existed outside of show business.


'We're Basically Writing a Constitution,' Says Charter Panel Chairman
LEAD: New York City, which has one of the nation's most peculiar forms of government, might be headed for a system with new elements that are common elsewhere.
These could include a larger legislature or one with two houses, a voting method that gives small groups a bigger voice and management procedures aimed at avoiding last-minute decisions.


As Seen From Boston . . .
LEAD: To the Editor:


Duke Plays Defense, Too
LEAD: In reaching the final of the East Regional, Georgetown reaffirmed its status as college basketball's quintessential defensive team.


Magna Cum Laude Isn't Everything
LEAD: In criticizing Charles Schnabolk's ''Cheers for the Lower Half'' (Opinion page, Jan. 8) Robert Wechsler's letter to the New Jersey editor on Feb. 12 confuses the point of the article.
He should have read it one more time; it was, indeed, a parody of our obsession with grades and did not, as Mr.
Wechsler suggests, downgrade intellectual achievement.


Budget Nears The Point of No Pretense
LEAD: A CONSENSUS is forming among politicians and economists, liberals and conservatives, that the only practical way to make a fundamental assault on the Federal budget deficit is for Republicans and Democrats to relinquish their strongest political weapons.

Wobbly Chair Woes
LEAD: WOBBLY chairs are annoying and, if allowed to worsen, can lead to accidents.
Most wobbles are caused by broken glue joints, due either to deterioration of old glue or to excess strain placed on chair parts.


Louis Malle's World of Innocence
LEAD: There are moments in the best Louis Malle films when it is possible to believe in innocence, in an Edenic world of childhood goodness that is soon shattered in some understated, irrevocable way.
AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS, now available on video (Orion Home Video, $79.98), is Mr.
Malle's magnificently subtle and profoundly moving account of a Jewish boy hidden in a Catholic school in France during World War II.


Stephanie P. Modlin WedTo A. N. Greene, Lawyer

Time to Be Frivolous With Artichokes
LEAD: IN spring when artichokes are abundant and prices are reasonable the cook can be frivolous with them.

LEAD: To the Editor:


THE WORLD: The Soviet Vote; A Guide to the Election Process
LEAD: Soviet voters go to the polls today to elect a Congress of People's Deputies, which is to be the supreme state body in a redesigned Soviet Government.

There's a Rain Problem, but the One at the Tap Is Worse
LEAD: AFTER Mayor Edward I. Koch's drought emergency declaration last week, residents of New York City and their northern neighbors are being forced for the third time this decade to cut water use.
Without any conclusive evidence that the area is experiencing long-term shifts in weather, the question becomes: why?


Paths of Glory, Giant Steps of Prudence
LEAD: ''The paths of glory lead but to the grave,'' that memorable phrase from a poet of yesterday, Thomas Gray, whose words have never died, came close to leading me to a premature breakdown at the age of 10.
As I sat in the crowded third-grade classroom, listening to the poetry being read aloud, I raised my hand it interrupt the gentle teacher who was determined to bring literature into our young lives and asked for an explanation of the short phrase.


Selling Mortgages as the Rates Rise
LEAD: EVEN in the best of times, anxiety and confusion are the hallmarks of shopping for mortgage money.
And today, not only are interest rates at distressing heights, but they also are topsy-turvy - with unadorned adjustable-rate mortgages more costly than the safer option of fixed-rate financing.


Battle Is Building Over Abortion

LEAD: Among the country artists whose music has been labeled ''new traditionalist,'' Lyle Lovett is surely the least bound to country-music traditions.


For Oscar's Producer, the Key Is C
LEAD: The Oscar, like the Maltese falcon, is the stuff that dreams are made of.
So it is appropriate that the producer of the 61st Academy Awards show, which will be telecast live by ABC Wednesday night and to more than a billion people around the world before the night is through, insists that he lay in the dark in his North Shore Chicago bedroom at the age of 7, listening to the 22d Academy Awards on the radio and dreaming, not about winning an

Correction
LEAD: An article March 23 about the Chicago mayoral campaign incorrectly described a public opinion poll commissioned by WLS-TV as the most recent.
The most up-to-date polling figures were not from the WLS poll but from a telephone survey of 821 registered voters conducted March 16 through 18 for WBBM-TV.


Why Business Turns to Teen-Agers
LEAD: In the last few years, as America's jobless rate plummeted to the lowest levels since the mid-1970's, ''Hiring'' signs have proliferated at fast-food restaurants, department stores, supermarkets and countless other businesses.
Increasingly, those jobs are going to people like Margie Lobaton in Warwick, R.I., and Patrick Gannaway in Huntington Beach, Calif.

Spiritual Energy Reaching Out To This Day
LEAD: If ever there was an irreplaceable exhibition, it is the one now signaled all over Amsterdam with banners and stickers and inscriptions in Cyrillic letters on the sides of bright yellow trams. ''Kasimir Malevich'' is the message, and ''The Stedelijk Museum'' is the place.


Review/Rock; Guitar and Harmony by the Bangles
LEAD: Few best-selling bands seem so schizophrenic as the Bangles.
Although all four Bangles write songs, the band's hit singles have been cover versions or collaborations (like the conventionally romantic ballad ''Eternal Flame,'' by the Bangles' Susanna Hoffs with an established hitmaking team, Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly), as if the Bangles were an old-fashioned ''girl group'' under a producer's control.


Rose Finally Breaks His Silence
LEAD: In his first substantive response to allegations about his gambling activities, Manager Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds yesterday described as ridiculous a report that he had flashed signals relating to baseball betting to a friend in the stands at Riverfront Stadium.


A Big Bite For Nolan Archibald
LEAD: There is no getting around it - this is a frustrating time for Nolan D. Archibald.

All's Not Quiet on the Legal Front
LEAD: The computer industry has the ''look and feel'' these days of a litigious free-for-all.

Fox Software Inc. and the Santa Cruz Operation; the Intel Corporation v.

PASTIMES: Bridge
LEAD: The Spring Nationals of the American Contract Bridge League, which ended a week ago in Reno, Nev. were the biggest ever, with a table count of 13,807 eclipsing a record set 21 years earlier in New York City.
They were also slightly longer than usual, since the entry of 107 teams in the Vanderbilt Knockout made it necessary to play the final on Monday, when the other contestants had departed.


Correction
LEAD: The Personal Finance column last week misidentified the type of ''frozen'' Keogh retirement plans that must be amended by May 31.
A Keogh plan is frozen when it no longer accepts contributions.
Individuals who hold frozen ''defined-contribution'' Keogh plans - those to which they had contributed a fixed percentage of annual income - do not have to amend their plans.


Liz Gessner Plans A May Wedding To Michael Miller
LEAD: The engagement of Judith Elizabeth Gessner to Michael Campion Miller, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN: Hastings-on-Hudson
LEAD: LIKE a picture window in a small room, the view of the New Jersey Palisades from the three bosky hills of Hastings-on-Hudson creates an illusion of expansiveness in this village of only two square miles.

SHEER BLACK
LEAD: In Paris and New York, when designers started showing dangerously sheer clothing, the skeptics asked: Who would wear these revealing clothes?
The answer appeared at recent parties in New York, where even Nancy Reagan was spotted in a black gown with a sheer top.
Clearly, this style wasn't restricted to the daring or outrageous.


Stanley Takes Aim at the N.R.A.&gt;
LEAD: ''Well,'' said STanley, ''will I see you at the Lazars' Wednesday night?'' ''I can't,'' I said, ''I have a funeral.'' ''I don't blame you,'' said Stanley. ''I don't know whether I'll go either.
I love Swifty and Mary, but Spago is only so big, and after a while, you can't really talk to anybody.
Besides, I'm not interested in watching the Oscar show this year.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD:  Dog Training 101  ''THIS is going to be a comic piece, right?'' said Stephanie Reyer of Great Neck, holding her dog Sasha in a vice grip as dogs in various stages of terror and excitement entered the auditorium of Great Neck's Cumberland Elementary School.
Sasha, a large German shepherd-husky-mix, was going into a barking frenzy every time a new dog came in.


Trip Insurance
LEAD: To the Editor: Regarding Gilbert Weiner's experience with trip insurance (Letters, Jan. 15), he should have had a travel agent calculate the amount of insurance necessary to cover the actual costs incurred for changing his return; adequate coverage includes the cost of penalties for cruise, tour and hotel cancellations plus airline ticket penalties or the purchase of a new return ticket.


Wagner's 'Ring': Stagecraft As Ideology
LEAD: Grand and crabby, beautiful and ugly, rhapsodic and boring, primordially mythic and progressive in ways we don't yet fully understand, Richard Wagner's four-opera, 16-hour cycle ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' still counts as the greatest challenge - for singers, conductors, stage directors, designers, critics and audiences alike - in the standard operatic canon.


Bona Fide Shortstop
LEAD: After a long and frustrating search, the Cleveland Indians have finally gotten a shortstop they can live with.
He is Felix Fermin, a 25-year-old minor leaguer who was obtained from the Pittsburgh Pirates in a deal that brought the Pirates Jay Bell, a 23-year-old infielder who had been one of three candidates for the


The Struggle for Land in Latin America
LEAD: IN 1985, President Jose Sarney of Brazil argued for a new land-redistribution plan, saying that ''no modern country has developed without first dealing with its agrarian problem.'' But this month, in a stark illustration of what happened to that idea, the police fired at random as they evicted some 500 landless families who had taken over a private farm to protest the Government's broken promises.

On the Stand
LEAD: Something of a celebrity since the Congressional hearings into the Iran-contra affair in 1987, Fawn Hall was back in the limelight last week, this time as a prosecution witness at the trial of her former boss, Oliver L. North.

CHILDREN'S BOOKS/POETRY: Bookshelf
LEAD: Additional titles of interest:


Question Of the Week; How Good A Job Has Ueberroth Done?
LEAD: Ueberroth has done an excellent job.
When he became commissioner, 21 of the 26 major league teams were nonprofitable.
Since then, clubs are making a combined $100 million this year.
He made lucrative contracts with CBS-TV, ESPN and CBS for radio rights.
And best of all, he's sharing the major leagues' wealth by proposing a ticket-price freeze.


When the Job is Done, the Play's the Thing
LEAD: The world would be poorer if a shop owner could not don a flounced purple dress once in a while to portray a tuba player in a marimba band, or if a genial teacher could not become - for a few performances, anyway - the horrible Mr.
Hyde.


When the Ballpark Cost Just a Nickel
LEAD: RECENTLY the sports pages, radio and television announced three-year contracts for Orel Hersheiser at $7.9 million, Roger Clemens at $7.5 million and Dwight Gooden at a mere $6.7 million.
Not quite in the same league as Henry Kravis, the leveraged buyout king, or Mike Milliken, the indicted junk-bond potentate but still pretty good for throwing the ball in a kids' game.


South Carolina's Wildlife Kingdom
LEAD: Just off the coast of South Carolina, about midway between the old mansions of Charleston and the new condos of Myrtle Beach, is an island kingdom ruled by animals.
Here, undistrubed by man, great flocks of snowy undisturbed by man, great flocks of snowy egrets and white ibis flash thier cpale clumsy wings over shallow ponds; alligators, as motionless and imperturbable as statues, sun themselves on mud banks covered with delicate white wildflowers; 30 different kinds of warblers sling from the branches of live oaks and hide amid the crimped leaves of yaupon holly and red-berried cassinas, a


Cats Provide Joy, Not Status
LEAD: Shame on Michael Brim of the Cat Fanciers Association  [ ''Long Island Journal,'' March 12 ]  for his quotation comparing mixed-breed cats ''Volkswagens'' to pedigreed ''Cadillacs.''


CLASH AT DARTMOUTH
LEAD: As a Dartmouth alumnus, I keep hoping that an observer will come up with commentary that will bring participants to their senses.
Alas, John Casey's piece (''At Dartmouth, the Clash of '89,'' Feb. 26) falls short.
Most alumni, I suspect, would agree that there is precious little to like about The Dartmouth Review.


Poeschek Bolsters Defense
LEAD: Rudy Poeschek still hasn't scored with anything but a haymaker or an uppercut, but in recent games he has quietly piled up the points in pursuit of what could be his most satisfying victory of his first, largely violent season in the National Hockey League.
The points are elements of a case that argues:


LIFE STYLE: Sunday Menu; Tempest in an Asparagus Pot: Are Fingers Fair?

Trekking With the Kids in Nepal
LEAD: IT was late in the afternoon of our hardest day of trekking in Nepal, a day in which we dropped from the frosty ridge of Tharepati at 11,800 feet to a suspension bridge over the Malemchi Khola nearly 4,000 feet lower.
The views were spectacular, the people we met on the trail were friendly, and the thick evergreen and bamboo forest around us was rich with new discoveries.

LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.

A Crowded Race for Mayor In Jersey City
LEAD: ST.

The campaign may be one of the liveliest in years.


It's Expensive, but the Benefits Are Clear
LEAD: In 1987, Los Angeles's smog plan was rejected by a Federal Appeals Court in response to a lawsuit I filed.
That plan failed to meet Clear Air Act requirements.
A follow-up lawsuit by the Coalition for Clean Air and the Sierra Club resulted in another court order.
Under continued legal pressure, the new Los Angeles smog plan was developed.


Young Inventors Solve Life's Problems
LEAD: WHAT does one do ''when you are growing and your clothes get bigger and you need a larger hanger?'' A New Rochelle fifth grader, Justin Friedman-Hurvitz, asked himself this question and the answer was the ''Everlasting Hanger,'' a simple aluminum affair with three screws that expands, and expands and expands.


Driver Kills Woman in Crash
LEAD: A drunken driver traveling west in an eastbound lane of the Long Island Expressway smashed into three cars Friday night, killing a Manhattan woman and critically injuring her daughter-in-law, the Suffolk County police said today.

Resisting The Temptations of Wall Street
LEAD: I JUST had my first real job interview, and it was with a brokerage.
I was not very serious about getting the position, but there was an open slot in the all-campus interviews schedule, so I took it.
It would be a good interviewing experience, I thought.
I quickly ate my lunch and hurried upstairs to change into my suit, while words like ''dress for success'' and ''corporate image'' went through my mind.

Outside In
LEAD: Garden elements have been a recurring theme in the decorative arts for centuries, but it is only recently that materials and objects meant for use outdoors are finding their way inside.
Terra-cotta vases and wire tables, stone benches and twig furniture - pieces that traditionally adorned patios or porches or gardens - are becoming as integral a part of interior schemes as the living-room sofa.


The Easter Egg as a Vocation and as Art
LEAD: IN many homes today, eggs are pastel and they nest in baskets lined with cellophane grass.
Easter eggs are also the subject of an exhibition at a New Milford art gallery this month.
And for a a Norfolk woman, they are a career.

LEAD: The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev.
Robert Runcie, leader of the 70 million-member Anglican Communion, will visit Pope John Paul II in Rome this year for talks aimed at increasing unity between their two churches.


Fears Confine Abortion Pill To France
LEAD: THE revolutionary new abortion pill, RU 486, is increasingly popular in France, and is considered by the medical profession to be a far better means of abortion than surgical procedures.
But given pressures from anti-abortion groups, among other obstacles, it could take years before the pill becomes available in other countries.


Nothing Amiss in Circulating Bush Note
LEAD: To the Editor:


Unlikely Seton Hall Moves to Final Four
LEAD: Seton Hall is Final Four bound.


Review/Dance; Five Ambitious Works By Blue Mercury Troupe
LEAD: The Blue Mercury Dancing Company, which performed Thursday at the Triplex Theater (199 Chambers Street), is an immensely likable troupe of nine able, personable dancers.

Alaska Aide Assails Oil Industry For 'Inadequate' Response to Spill

COLLEGE HOCKEY: N.C.A.A./Friday's Games; BADGERS PUT FOCUS ON DEFENSE

TALKING: Jumbo Loans; Shopping Around for Good Deals
LEAD: AS the prices of homes have soared - particularly in areas like the Northeast and West Coast - so have the needs for buyers to seek jumbo, or ''nonconforming,'' mortgage loans.

WHAT'S DOING IN: Beijing

A Short Skyscraper With a Tall Assignment
LEAD: ''The tallest building in Bridgeport'' sounds like a punch line.
And at just 16 stories, Bridgeport Center, the new headquarters complex of People's Bank here, is so small that it would barely muster notice in most other cities.

Review/Film Festival; Iranian Director's Mournful Trilogy
LEAD: Though its production company is the Arts Bureau of the Organization for the Propagation of Islamic Thought, the Iranian film ''The Peddler'' is in no way a work of propaganda.
