Belial and Other Oddities Return in 'Basket Case 2'
''I understand your pain,'' the gray-haired psychiatrist called Granny Ruth says in a kind and comforting voice to the patient on her couch -the mutant severed half of a Siamese twin, a creature resembling a giant Mr.
Potato Head with gangly arms and blue eyes. ''But ripping the faces off people may not be in your best interest,'' she croons.
''Basket Case 2'' continues the story of Belial, who was once a growth sticking out from under his normal-looking brother's arm and is now a violence-prone individual carried around by his twin in a wicker basket.
As cheap horror spoofs go, this one isn't all bad.
Granny Ruth, known to the world as Dr.
Freak, has taken the twins into her menage of misfits, which includes a man with 27 noses, a creature with a frog's head, even a woman with the figure of a tree stump who turns out to be a perfect match for Belial.
These creatures actually look cheery, not fearsome.

It's Italian, but With a California Accent
LEAD: PASTA VIOLA, a newcomer in Stony Brook, sounds like yet another strutter in Long Island's never-ending parade of Italian restaurants.
But take a second look; it is not the same old tarantella.
There isn't a Bolognese, Alfredo or carbonara in sight.
Insted, fasten your seatbelts for the likes of violet linguine, an amalgam of pasta, sauteed red cabbage, prosciutto and olive oil splashed with balsamic vinegar.


'Le Train Bleu' Makes a Brief Stopover
LEAD: Soon after the London opening of ''Le Train Bleu'' during the 1924 season of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, a writer in one of the glossy weeklies complained, ''It is as difficult to get a seat for 'The Blue Train' as it is to get a seat for the thing itself during the height of the Riviera rush.


Up for Bids
LEAD: Not long ago, all a defecting Soviet intelligence officer might want from America was protection, a modest living and a chance to die in bed.
Now, for Victor I. Sheymov, at least, it is interviews, press conferences and, yes, book deals.
Mr.
Sheymov surfaced last week in Washington and let the world know that 10 years ago he had defected straight from the inner sanctum of the K.G.B.


Lifestyle;   From Alleys to Centers, Bowlers Keep Rolling

LEAD: A new Smith College calendar portrays unusual representatives of a women's college - men.


Now Albany Gets Its Opportunity For Fiscal Delusions
LEAD: AFTER the bad old days of the 1970's, when bankruptcy seemed near and boom unimaginable, New York City was ordered to untangle its books and submit them to newly appointed fiscal monitors.
The city was also forced to draw up budgets for four years at a clip and to update its spending plans four times a year, so it could not, as one official put it last week, hide its head in the sand for more than three months at a time.

AFGHANS: NOW THEY BLAME AMERICA
LEAD: John F. Burns is undoubtedly correct in maintaining that United States policy has been affected adversely by the standards of reporting in the Afghan conflict (''Afghans: Now They Blame America,'' Feb. 4).
But it is hardly because of ''selective reporting'' by journalists in the field.
It is, rather, the dismal failure on the part of the

Question of the Week;   Was the Strickland Trade A Good One?
LEAD: Al Bianchi's Kiki Vandeweghe fixation cost the Knicks the 1989 first-round draft choice and Sidney Green.
His ego cost the team Rick Pitino, a great motivating coach who always had the team playing at top intensity.

And the fish are really big.


Where Did All The Nice People Go?

Back-room deals.
Payoffs.
F.B.I. sting operations.
Sex scandals.


Question of the Week;   Was the Strickland Trade A Good One?
LEAD: Maurice Cheeks is a great playmaker and leader as well as a class act.
But he does not fill the Knicks' needs, which are a shooting guard and a solid scoring forward.
As far as Mo teaching Mark how to play as if he's in the N.B.A., not Central Park, alas, enormous egos don't come equipped with ears.


I Thought Software Was My Answer
LEAD: I got my first, and worst, tax headache of the year choosing a program to prepare the return.


A Playwright Is Free (So Now What?)
LEAD: A certain talented writer who, like myself, came here from Eastern Europe complained to me recently that totalitarianism has ruined him twice: first, by imprisoning him and forcing him to emigrate; second, by falling apart just when the writer had completed an 800-page novel on the very subject of totalitarianism.

Synopsis Of the Plight of the Handicapped
LEAD: Walter McCarthy's article on social skills for the retarded as the key to advancement from sheltered workshop to successful supported employment in the public sector was a well considered one, raising the questions we need to ask about how retarded children and young adults gain these skills.
The relationship with the job trainer, a coach who is eventually faded out as the retarded young adult becomes more able to do his/her job, is vital in training both the employee and the supervisor.


Fashion: On the Street;   Heat Wave From the North, With a Hood
LEAD: It's been feeling like the Yukon out there again, but don't worry, it will soon feel like spring again, or maybe summer, maybe even today or tomorrow.

Excellent Education At State Colleges
LEAD: In his Jan. 14 letter to the New Jersey editor regarding institutions' changes in name from college to university in New Jersey, John W. Osborne denigrates our students and dedicated faculty.
What does he know about the caliber of students attending New Jersey state colleges who work toward achieving higher education?


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My house was built in 1926, and the original banisters and newel posts had many coats of paint on them that I stripped off.
I found that the wood had been stained a dark color that I could not remove with alcohol, bleach and other chemicals.
I applied two coats of a pigmented shellac sealer, then two coats of acrylic latex and two coats of semi-gloss.

Food;   RALLYING ROUND THE TABLE
LEAD: THE WORDS ''FAMILY SUPPER'' CARRY with them an almost unutterable nostalgia, images and emotions of the past wrapped in the glow of better values.
The vision is fueled by Norman Rockwell paintings and television commercials for turkeys, long-distance telephone companies and insurance agencies.
The props are large linen napkins, grandparents, paneled dining rooms and vast tables loaded with roasted birds, homemade breads, jams and pickles and a ravishment of pies, cakes and cookies.


'What I Saw at the Revolution'
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Mysterious Router Explained
LEAD: DESPITE its usefulness, the router is a mysterious power tool to many amateurs, perhaps because its name does not describe its function.
A better name might be electric chisel, for a chisel is the hand tool whose operations the router duplicates most closely.


WHAT DO YOU CALL AN AGING HOOPSTER?
LEAD: I'm a 16-year-old 6-foot-5-inch-tall power forward for my high-school basketball team in Chatham, N.J.
After reading your article, I understand a little more about the ''older men'' I play basketball with at our local gym in the off season.
I used to think they were just dirty players trying to win at all costs.


A Sulky Rock Star Among the Prophets
LEAD: Though Elizabeth Swados had wanted to write a musical based on the story of Jonah as long ago as 1972 - ''because I was so keen on what the inside of a whale would sound like'' - it wasn't until she came across Robert Nathan's short, poetic 1925 novel, ''Jonah,'' that she saw how to do it.
The novel, she said, ''made Jonah such a prophet for the 80's and 90's, so narcissistic, full of complaints, apathetic, unwilling to do anything for anyone because there wasn't enough in it for him.


Even Noah Might Envy These Casts
LEAD: Some hoofers have four legs.
Among this season's pleasures has been ''Rapsodog,'' staged by the Mundial Sisters, a Parisian troupe that made its New York debut early last month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
A bittersweet comedy about a French market town, ''Rapsodog'' starred three vivid performers.


The Struggle for Self-Possession Is Engaged
LEAD: I WAS 15 years old when I began myZfirst diet.
As a child I had always been thin, but during my freshman year of high school, I sneaked too many sweets and flew from a size 5 to a size 14.


WHAT'S HAPPENING
LEAD: Not so long ago, there was mostly Health-Tex and Danskin, and style was an afterthought.
But for baby-boomer parents nowadays, style is thought of long before they get to the store.


MACEDONIA'S STONY STRENGTH
LEAD: On the hill above the old city of Ohrid, in southern Yugoslavia, is an overgrown park, half reclaimed by forest and crowned by the monumental, ruined fortress of Tsar Samuil, who during the 10th century created a Macedonian empire extending from the Danube to the Adriatic.
The park is full of ruins: crumbling walls, rusted swing sets, the roofless Sveti Pantelejmon, which, like so many Yugoslav churches, served as a mosque for much of its life.

Review/Rock;   Mischief by Jad Fair and Kramer
LEAD: Jad Fair and Kramer, who brought a six-piece band to Wetlands on Monday night, are kindred souls on rock's scruffy fringes.
Mr.
Fair, who has led the band Half Japanese since the late 1970's, is one of rock's last professional amateurs; he writes blunt, seemingly artless lyrics, sings them in a nasal whine and scratches out scraggly notes and chords from his guitar.


Having Company? You Can Still Serve a Roast
LEAD: VIRGIL THOMSON used to say that when you have company, you serve a roast.
Perhaps this seems a little old-fashioned in these days of swordfish steaks and composed salads, but few things so firmly state that the meal is a special occasion.


PERUVIAN FARMERS SAID TO KILL REBELS
LEAD: Outraged highland peasants armed with sickles and homemade shotguns captured 13 Shining Path guerrillas, killed them and sent their heads to the local army commander, the police said on Friday.

She is a student of Dorothy DeLay at the Juilliard School, and like many of Miss D


Having Company? You Can Still Serve a Roast
LEAD: VIRGIL THOMSON used to say that when you have company, you serve a roast.
Perhaps this seems a little old-fashioned in these days of swordfish steaks and composed salads, but few things so firmly state that the meal is a special occasion.


Back on Track
LEAD: There's nothing like a little righteous indignation, not to mention a rigorous training schedule, to keep a runner in shape during a long layoff.
For Sandra Gasser of Switzerland, the combination was good enough for a more than respectable showing in her first major championship meet since being banned from competition after testing positive for steroids at the 1987 world championships in Rome.


Hotel Rates
LEAD: To the Editor: The Marriott's Leisurelife program offers 50 percent off rack rates for people 62 and over, according to your article ''Getting Breaks on Hotel Rates'' (Practical Traveler, Dec. 24).
I called the Marriott in Boca Raton, Fla., twice to book and was told the rate was $124 and no further discount would be allowed.


ALBANIA'S BYRONIC SHORE
LEAD: The southern coast of Albania is sometimes referred to as the Ionian Riviera.
In this case the term is not ambiguous.
There are no high-rise developments here, no casinos, no jet airports or trailer parks.
Polychrome limestone cliffs loom above the sparkling emerald water, grown with cedar, pine and myrtle.

NEWS SUMMARY


In the Sonoran Desert, The Bizarre Is the Rule
LEAD: IN 1922 a botanist named Godfrey Sykes happened upon a bizarre- looking tree in the Sonoran desert, which stretches from Baja California nearly to the eastern border of Arizona.
It resembled a 30-foot-tall upside-down green carrot with tiny, tiny branches. ''Ho, ho, a boojum,'' Mr.
Sykes said when he saw the unusual plant.


Ban on Plastics in Suffolk Is Overturned
LEAD: A pioneering law that banned the use of plastic food containers and grocery bags in Suffolk County on Long Island has been overturned by a state appeals court because the county did not prepare an environmental-impact statement.


THE ROOM WHERE FORSTER LIVED
LEAD: In Edinburgh, a scarred old double-runged wooden stool; in Jerusalem, lying folded on a stand-up desk, a pair of well-used reading glasses.
The tall stool (I have one just like it in my kitchen) and the scratched lenses (a dresser-drawerful of these!) are the most commonplace objects in the world - what is more familiar, what is more intimate?


Noriega Kin Leave Panama
LEAD: The family of the deposed Panamanian military leader, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, arrived today in Havana after being granted safe passage by the Panamanian Government, a Mexican news agency reported.
The agency said General Noriega's wife, three daughters and grandson would travel to the Dominican Republic, where they have been granted asylum and where the general's son-in-law is a citizen.


Teacher With Visions Of Greater Things
LEAD: Mathias B. Freese has penned an eloquent plea for a grade school Kulturkampf in ''Teachers Have No Chance to Give Their Best'' (Long Island Opinion, Jan. 21), and one which I heartily endorse.
I was one of Mr.
Freese's advanced 10th-grade English students five years ago, and I consider myself an antecedent to what he cites as a ''general diminishment in students'' over time.


New Beginning For an Ex-Hoya
LEAD: JOHN TURNER leaned back on a row of wooden bleachers in the Mabee Center at Phillips University and wiped the perspiration from his forehead.

Hiring a Preparers Can Ease the Pain
LEAD: THE 50 million Americans who will pay someone to prepare their income tax returns this year face an important choice: what kind of service to use.


Question of the Week;   Was the Strickland Trade A Good One?
LEAD: The trade was a terrible one.
True, Strickland was bad for the team's morale.
But the Knicks should have gotten much more for him than a player who has at most a year or two left.
It was a trade you might make if you had a real shot at the championship, but the Knicks don't belong on the same court as the Lakers.


A Barry Le Va Retrospective Moves From Fastidious to Robust
LEAD: WITH 136 of its 176 pages occupied by illustrations, the catalogue to the Neuberger Museum's ''Barry Le Va, 1966 to 1988'' is a visual synopsis of the show.
As a result, the viewer can take in almost at a glance what is hard to discern in the display itself: the overall shape of the artist's progress from a fastidious kind of


New Jersey Blast Kills a Woman; Police Find a Weapons Stockpile
LEAD: An explosion in the basement of a house in Cresskill, N.J., where the authorities found weapons and ammunition, killed an 83-year-old woman yesterday and injured her grandson and another family member.


Prenuptial Pacts Increasing
LEAD: THE divorce courts on Long Island are not spilling over with Donald and Ivana Trumps, but the highly publicized marital split will probably create more demand for prenuptial agreements, Long Island lawyers say.


Question of the Week;   Was the Strickland Trade A Good One?
LEAD: This recent trade is just another in a continued series of bad moves - Gerald Henderson, Jawann Oldham, Kiki Vandeweghe, the loss of Sidney Green, the waiving of Pete Myers - by people who haven't the vision, talent or patience for building a championship team.
The only reason this team is competitive is Patrick Ewing.


Tax Books, a Winning Investment
LEAD: Few investments offer the low-risk, high-reward potential of a good book on income taxes.
Almost anyone who spends a few dollars for a book and takes some time to study it is sure to realize tax savings far greater than the cost of the book.


Campus Life: Bard;   Group Confronts Four Professors About Harassment
LEAD: Simon's Rock of Bard College is an ''early college'' where professors have traditionally been called by their first names and students - many of high school age -have enjoyed a great deal of personal attention.
It was thrown into turmoil last month when a group composed mostly of women, the Defense Guard, began a campaign against what they said was sexual harassment.


Question of the Week;   Was the Strickland Trade A Good One?
LEAD: If Mark Jackson can ignore the boos of the crowd, be patient and pick the brains of Mo Cheeks, he will realize his potential and become the superstar that fans are impatient to see.
If that happens within the next year or two, the trade will be more than successful.

The Budd Company's Different Drum
LEAD: Composites combine the properties of two or more materials to accomplish tasks beyond the capabilities of homogeneous substances.
An early example was the addition of straw to bricks to resist breakage.
Currently, carbon-reinforced plastics produce lighter, stiffer golf clubs and tennis rackets, and designers are looking at exotic metal-ceramic combinations for high-performance aerospace applications.


WHAT DO YOU CALL AN AGING HOOPSTER?
LEAD: Erich Rupprecht delineates exactly the sort of savvy that's needed to compete against younger opponents (About Men: ''What Do You Call an Aging Hoopster?'' Feb. 4).
For me (age 44), the moment of ''wisdom'' came 10 or so years ago, when a windmilling, spread-eagled, college-age defender was left gasping when I threw a perfect bounce-pass between his legs to a teammate (older than I), cutting to a basket: two points for us and a Newtonian epiphany for me.


Donation Rescues Bicycle Sundays
LEAD: BICYCLE Sundays, one of the more unusual recreational activities in the county and possibly its most popular, was saved last week by the intervention of a corporate sponsor and the second thoughts of budget-conscious government officials.


Strawberry 'Getting Well,' He Says
LEAD: Darryl Strawberry arrived in Florida today to begin what he termed his ''new life'' after a winter of turmoil and a month of treatment for alcohol abuse, and said: ''I'm not a bad person.
I'm a sick person getting well.'' The 27-year-old right fielder for the Mets flew here from Los Angeles and made his first public statement about his troubled times since he entered the Smithers Center in Manhattan on Feb.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: The restaurant is half empty.
You arrive, with a reservation, and are shown to a table either at the back of the room or next to the kitchen door.
It's enough to make you wonder (never mind that it's enough to make you mad, as in furious) - why is this happening to you?
Do you not have the right kind of power profile?


Campus Life: West Virginia;   For First Time, Woman Is Mascot At Sports Events
LEAD: For the first time, West Virginia University last week chose a woman as its buckskin-clad mascot for men's athletic events.
The new Mountaineer, 22-year-old Natalie Tennant, said winning the honor was more a matter of showing school spirit than of overcoming a sex barrier.


Q. &amp; A.: Moscow's Party Chief;   Communists Try Working Their Way Up From the Top
LEAD: AMONG the 3,282 candidates running for the Moscow City Council in elections Sunday, Yuri A. Prokofiev may be the one with the most to lose.
Since November he has been the Communist Party chief of Moscow, and by most accounts his party's control of the Soviet capital is in some jeopardy.


Glad It's Over
LEAD: HE came up a free throw short of a chance to end his 34-year coaching career with his 600th victory, but the way Abe Lemons of Oklahoma City saw it after a 78-77 loss to Oklahoma Christian on Friday night, the close call was something of a relief.


Inventive Guises for the Gourd

An Eye-Opening 'King Lear,' With Sunglasses
LEAD: IF ''King Lear'' is unplayable - oft times, it has been so declared - then what seems like a recent inundation of stage and screen Lears may have a common cause.
That is to prove how Shakespeare's ''very foolish, fond old man'' who is ''every inch a king'' can be played any which way, and the play can happen anytime, anyplace or in limbo.


Rider Injured
LEAD: A leading horse show rider, Katie Monahan Prudent of Middlesburg, Va., was seriously injured Friday when she was thrown from her horse during the winter equestrian festival at the Palm Beach Polo Equestrian Club in Florida.

How One Man's Ego Wrecked a Bank
LEAD: It was the Christmas season and the Bank of New England was having a party.
Gathered at the swank Meridien Hotel here, bank executives cheerily greeted prominent business people as they dined on hors d'oeuvres and kept their glasses filled.
To the casual observer, it was a scene of glad tidings and seasonal bonhomie.


Glasnost On the Island
LEAD: PEERING over the border for decades, each side has never hidden its mistrust of its neighbor.
It is a relationship forged from years of suspicion and ruthless political competition.


Campus Life: Yeshiva;   Rolling Up Sleeves to Help Soviet Emigres
LEAD: How would the Yeshiva University students move the hulking bed up two flights of stairs?
Besides being narrow and steep, the stairway was poorly lighted.

TWINKLE, TWINKLE, NORTHERN LIGHTS
LEAD: When I was a child I longed to see the aurora borealis, and life being what it is, I still do.
I'm told one needn't go all that far north to glimpse this magical display of fairy lights stretching across the night sky - one lucky friend claims to have seen it from the roof of her house in Cambridge, Mass.


Pro Hockey;   'Stupid Things' Fell Islanders
LEAD: One of the St.
Louis goals came after the referee accidentally blocked an Islander clearing pass.


Tanzania Torn as It Tries to Make Ends Meet
LEAD: Tanzanian politics involve a good deal of self-analysis and what some would consider interminable debate.
Although this is a one-party state, politicians here like to say, at least the party's laundry is washed in public.


Opening Day and Dog-Track Money
LEAD: High atop Yankee Stadium, the sign promised ''Four Weeks Until Opening Day - Tickets on Sale Now.'' Unless baseball's labor dispute is settled soon, however, it's a promise that will be broken.

Editors' Note
LEAD: An article in The Long Island Weekly last Sunday described the investigation of a car-bombing on Feb. 15 that killed a Suffolk County narcotics detective.
It reported that investigators' focus had shifted from the detective's undercover work to his private life.


Broken Covenant?
LEAD: Covenant House is, of course, no bucolic Boys Town, but somehow New York had come to view the juvenile shelter's founder, the Rev.
Bruce Ritter, as a bit like the tough-but-wholesome priests of 1930's Hollywood.
There he was, fighting at various times City Hall, landlords, criminals and the odds to save ''these good kids,'' the young runaways and throwaways of Times Square.

John's and defeated the Redmen by 71-65, in the last regular-season game for both teams.


WHY BALI HA'I IS STILL CALLING
LEAD: It's a bleak day in Manhattan as I'm writing this, and I can't help wondering why I'm here and not on some gorgeous tropical island.
In fact, I wonder why I've never been on a gorgeous tropical island.
My favorite Broadway number is still ''Bali Ha'i,'' from ''South Pacific,'' with its romantic longing for lush, waterlapped surroundings, and its seductive refrain, ''Come to me, come to me.


Taking a Chance on Luck
LEAD: EVEN in these days of easy access, foreign travel can still hold something of the mysterious and the magical: the unaccustomed can release soundings from the deep. ''For the world . . . ,'' in Matthew Arnold's words, is ''so various, so beautiful, so new . . . .'' Yet it is the same world that is ''Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight.


YOUR TAXES: Taxpayers' Savvy Strategies;   FINDING THE CASH FOR A NEW BUSINESS

LEAD: Restoration work on the Old Dutch Church in North Tarrytown, N.Y., which is immortalized in Washington Irving's ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,'' has started and will continue throughout the year.
The first phase is a study of the repairs necessary in the wooden belfry and roof, parts of which have been damaged by dry rot and insects.


Corrections
LEAD: A front-page picture caption on Jan. 28 misstated the location of Haystack Rock.
It is in Cannon Beach, Ore., not Astoria.


Caring Was the Key
LEAD: On the day they announced that ''A Chorus Line'' would finally close, you could walk over to the Shubert Theater and ask whether any good seats were available for tomorrow night.
The answer would be ''You never can tell . . .
Sixth row center all right?'' No hangdog looks, no maudlin theatrics, just talking a good game at the box office, right to the end.


Rights Nominee Holds Stock With Pretoria Tie
LEAD: President Bush's nominee for the nation's top civil rights enforcement job holds nearly $20,000 worth of stock in a company that does business in South Africa.


The Bold Murals Of Tucson's Streets
LEAD: WHILE stuck in traffic on Tucson's south side recently, I noticed something that had previously escaped me.
It was a painting of a woman asleep on a pillow, in a friendly desert landscape, against a backdrop of waterfalls, canyonland and bluffs.
The artistry was confident, but no one would confuse it with museum-quality.


Stacey Gillis and Jeffrey Weber to Wed
LEAD: June wedding plans for Stacey Gillis and Jeffrey Andrew Weber have been announced by the prospective bride's parents, Robert Gillis of Lake Wylie, S.C., and Mrs.
Stanley Grey of Atlanta.
Mr.

WHAT'S DOING IN: Rio de Janeiro
LEAD: Austrian TV viewers recently saw a cigarette commercial featuring a European tourist sitting naked on Copacabana Beach.
Thieves had picked him clean, but they left him his pack of Dames.
Rio de Janeiro's pickpockets have become the latest international stereotype, and since 1988 tourism has been declining at the rate of 100,000 visitors a year, down to 610,000 in 1989.


I.R.S. CHIEF FACES TASK OF REBUILDING
LEAD: Although it has made rapid strides in harnessing computer technology and carried out the Congressional overhaul of the tax code, intended in part to make filing a return simpler for tens of millions of taxpayers, the Internal Revenue Service continues to face criticism.


POSTINGS: SoHo Conversion;   Peppered Past

The two trains, one carrying freight and the other passengers, collided at Grajales, about 25 miles from Puebla, on Friday, a spokesman for the local government said.


Teen-Age Affluence: An Empty World
LEAD: I feel that Roger Keizerstein in his article ''Teen-Agers and the Trap of Affluence'' (Jan. 21) misses the point of what is really missing in their affluent lives.
It is this very protection from life in the outside world that creates for them an empty nonworld.
Even more to their detriment is the fact that they've never been told that the end of homelessness, the reversal of environmental decay, the elimination of animal exploitation, all rest within their hands.


Enter Fauntroy, With Flourishes, to Join Capital Mayoral Race
LEAD: Declaring ''I know what needs to be done,'' Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy announced today that he was giving up his job as the District of Columbia's non-voting member in Congress so he could run in the muddled race for mayor.

GERMANY AND INTEREST RATES
LEAD: The meshing of West and East Germany - one a sleek, postwar capitalist engine and the other a shattered, inefficient state-run rowboat with high unemployment - is expected to be a formidable task.
While the two halves may some day become a seamless and vibrant economy, the transition is expected to be rough, and unsettling for interest rates around the globe.

The Talk of Belgrade;   White City More Gray And Sullen
LEAD: The White City, as this ancient urban center has been named for most of its existence, looks a bit grayer to visitors returning after a few years, a result, residents say, of neglect and a decade of economic crisis.


A PEEK THROUGH THE PEARLY GATES
LEAD: Never has so much been written about a place of which nobody knows a thing.
When religious Victorians put about that the hereafter was not a place but a state of being, the sublime Cardinal Newman opined that the idea of place was inherent in that of the afterlife.

Review/Theater;   How to Give Grandpa A Bar Mitzvah, at Last
LEAD: Bernie, the grandpa, is slowly dying but will survive the play.
Bessie, the grandma, is quickly cooking and fussing and will survive grandpa.
Neal, the grandson, a modern young man, and you know what that adds up to, has decided to immerse himself in the life of his grandparents and even to get grandpa the bar mitzvah ceremony he missed out on when he turned 13.


IDEOLOGY THRIVES IN ROCK'S OUTER ORBITS
LEAD: Down in front of the stage at CBGB, the action subsided while Prong tuned up.
Moments earlier, as the hard-core/metal band growled and battered through its songs, its fans had been ''moshing'' (slam-dancing) to the music - hurling themselves headlong at one another or climbing onstage and then leaping onto their companions, seemingly as mindless a diversion as the 20th century has to offer.


Every Cat Has His Day. Here's Stanley's.
LEAD: They filed past the judges with nervous smiles, glancing at the crowd and shifting from one foot to the other as the master of ceremonies made jokes to put them at ease.
They were the owners.
The cats, naturally, remained aloof and above it all, cradled in their owners' arms, glancing about as if they entered contests all the time.


Synopsis of the Plight Of the Handicapped
LEAD: Walter McCarthy gives a good synopsis of the plight moderately handicapped people face in their efforts to break from the stereotypical vocational situations.


A BALKAN CAPITAL, AS IT OUGHT TO BE
LEAD: I have for many years been fascinated by Romania, and in particular by Bucharest.
It is a purely literary fascination.
It began when I read Olivia Manning's ''Balkan Trilogy,'' from whose pages there rose a seedy glamour, a whiff of alluring decadence that was irresistible.
Gradually it attained the status of a disreputable Mecca, something between Anthony Hope's Ruritania and Malcolm Bradbury's Slaka.


Corrections
LEAD: The Practical Traveler column on page 3 of the Travel section today refers incorrectly to the fare that qualifies passengers for Economy Select seating on British Airways DC-10 flights to Gatwick Airport near London from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
The midweek $1,102 round-trip fare does not require advance purchase.


Pamela Kerr Wed To Scott Martin
LEAD: Pamela Kerr, a daughter of Richard Kerr of Ossining, N.Y., and Singlea Hall of New Rochelle, N.Y., was married yesterday to Scott Martin, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edwin W. Martin of Albertson, L.I.

Children's Fashion;   Spring Whimsy
LEAD: Bold, vibrant colors are bursting out all over for spring and summer.
Anything goes, and the brighter the better.
Nearly every dress, shirt, pair of shorts and pants is meant to look, feel and act like fun, designed with play in mind.
For girls, dress silhouettes are simple and pretty, not fussy, with empire or basque waistlines.


GAUDY, BAWDY BARCELONA
LEAD: Barcelona is a city that has been brushed aside by history - and has learned how to take advantage of that neglect.
In the 13th century, Catalan culture flourished from Valencia to Nice; if events had taken a different turn, Barcelona might have become the natural center of a country about the size of Portugal.


Carol von Glahn and Eric Hussar Are Engaged
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.

LEAD: Saying the Forest Service has abused millions of acres entrusted to it, supervisors and professionals in the service are rebelling against Federal policies that promote logging, mining and road-building in 191 million acres of public forests.


The Needs Of the Retarded
LEAD: It was gratifying to read Walter H. McCarthy's piece, ''What the Retarded Need: Social Skills'' [Opinion, Jan. 7] .
As the parent of a 32-year-old sheltered workshop client, I agree wholeheartedly with his assessment of the current situation.


Battling for Tenants in a Slow Market
LEAD: A TWO-YEAR building surge in West Midtown has demonstrated the power of public incentives to direct the path of commercial development.
The big question now is how to market a spate of new offices when the New York City economy has sunk into the doldrums.

LEAD: Every weekday morning for the last five weeks Joseph J. Hazelwood has walked across the iced street from the Captain Cook Hotel to a small room in Alaska Superior Court where he has heard himself alternately described as a reckless mariner and a hero.


'Disappointing' Inauguration For Condo Plan
LEAD: STATE officials in Hartford last week began sifting through the responses to an innovative program intended to increase the supply of housing for low- and moderate-income families in Connecticut through the purchase of condominiums.
And across Fairfield and Litchfield Counties, housing officials began assessing why so many of their towns were being left out.


Corrections
LEAD: A picture caption on page 27 of the Arts and Leisure section today misattributes a revival of ''The Sound of Music.'' It is being presented by the New York City Opera, not the City Center.


OZARKS: SPRING OF BRIGHT WATER
LEAD: I went back to Greer Spring one day a few months ago.
Greer Spring is, arguably, one of the prettiest spots in the Ozarks, and I hadn't been there for several years.
The ticks and chiggers and poison ivy that make summer woodland visits in that part of the country so itchy were gone, and the day was such a bright-blue sunny one it demanded a walk in some beautiful spot.

At the moment they agree on one thing: the county's quality of life is increasingly at risk, and no one is minding the environmental store.


The Night the Plane Fell: Sealing Up the Memories

Pupils Learning About Parental Roles
LEAD: ON a small, colorful rug in the center of the classroom, 7-month-old Allison Stumper lay on her back, drinking juice from her bottle.


Ecuador
LEAD: To the Editor: I was surprised but happy to learn that trekkers have discovered Oyacachi (''Adventuring in the Cloud Forests of Ecuador,'' by Joan K. Peters, Travel, Nov. 5).
As a Peace Corps volunteer, I walked to Oyacachi twice after the earthquake - which was in March 1987, rather than in 1985 as the article stated - to inspect their newly built potable water system.


West Bank's 'Garden Views' and 'Special Loans' Are Luring Jewish Settlers
LEAD: Dozens of new one-bedroom two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes are going up on the edge of this Jewish settlement, the largest in the West Bank.


You Can't Be Too Thin in Economy Class
LEAD: IN economy class, the squeeze is on.
If you feel you are having a tougher time getting into your airplane seat than you used to, and if you find sitting there for a long time more trying, it is not your age or your bulk.
You are being packed in more snugly.
Instead of a seat that occupied 34 inches or even 36 along the aisle four years ago, you will probably now get a seat that takes up only 31 inches.


Question of the Week;   Was the Strickland Trade A Good One?
LEAD: Rod Strickland for Mo Cheeks is more than simple arithmetic.
It is an equation that takes into account stability, chemistry, leadership and unselfishness - all the things that Cheeks has in abundance and the Knicks need.
Al Bianchi made the right move.
The Knicks are not a player away from title contention.


Marx Left the Individual Out of His Equation
LEAD: To the Editor:


EXPLORING DEVONS'S SECRET GARDENS
LEAD: Traveling the 120 miles from London to Devon in March is to make the leap from winter to spring.
Thanks to the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, England's southwest peninsula begins to bloom weeks before the rest of the country has emerged from gray dampness and night frosts.
Wherever you go in Devon, the ocean is not far away, and its influence makes winter a gentle affair with minimal frost, sea mists and lots of rain.


Accurate Arms, but at a Soccer Game?
LEAD: First of all, I would like to thank the Italian journalist who saved me from a beaning the other day.
I didn't catch his name, but his subtle nudge kept me from being hit by a missile precisely launched by one of the tifosi, as Italian fans are called.


Through the Form 1040 Step by Step
LEAD: Top tax professionals work with their clients year round to draw up financial plans tailored to their goals and means, taking advantage of whatever deductions and opportunities are allowed under the nation's tax laws.
Thus, studying an expertly prepared return can help taxpayers understand tax strategies, as well as aid in organizing records, even if they, too, turn to a professional to fill out the forms.


Storm Signals Flying on U.S.-China Relations
LEAD: As the Year of the Horse began in late January, Chinese-American relations seemed to be improving.
The whispers here were about the supposedly imminent release of the dissident Fang Lizhi from his refuge in the American Embassy, and some officials on both sides foresaw a steady warming in relations.


Where Cork Cooks Stock Up
LEAD: THE Duke of Wellington's campaign was victualed out of Cork City.
With its deep natural harbor and adjacent farmlands, Cork was one of the great food centers and the butter capital of Europe in those days.
For the perishables that couldn't be shipped - the fresh harvest of Ireland's fields and waters - you had to go to the English Market in Cork City.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My house was built in 1926, and the original banisters and newel posts had many coats of paint on them that I stripped off.
I found that the wood had been stained a dark color that I could not remove with alcohol, bleach and other chemicals.
I applied two coats of a pigmented shellac sealer, then two coats of acrylic latex and two coats of semi-gloss.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:
THE SURPRISE OF BURNING, by Michael Doane. (Ballantine, $4.95.) A war photographer and his mother, an aspiring singer with a heroin problem, find that both are instinctively drawn to history's great disasters.

Campus Life: Yale;   Where French Course Is a Cause Celebre
LEAD: Call it a case of ''le professeur et la victime'' -only now it is not a lesson in the gender of French nouns.

What He Wanted From His Public Were Tears
LEAD: Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805) is the great whipping boy of 18th-century French art.
The name immediately evokes an image of a misty-eyed prepubescent girl, clad only in filmy gauze, her eyes rolled heavenward, her lips illicitly moist.
This is the Greuze beloved by the 19th century, the Greuze of the 4th Marquess of Hertford, who paid staggering sums for these ''fancy heads.


Currency;   The Dollar's European Rally
LEAD: Will the dollar continue the small rally it started last week against the West German mark and other European currencies?
The West German Bundesbank signaled its concern about the rally of almost three pfennigs by selling dollars in Frankfurt Friday. (See Friday closings for New York at right.) If it is really worried, it will do the same thing again this week.


Reviews/Dance;   Inspired by Paintings and Courage
LEAD: ''This Cordate Carcass,'' Llory Wilson's provocative new dance for five women, was inspired by the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo and by a friend's battle against AIDS.
The piece, which was presented on Thursday at Dance Theater Workshop's Bessie Schonberg Theater, alludes frequently to Kahlo's paintings.


POSTINGS: $200,000 Project;   Land-Use Guide
LEAD: A year-long project intended to produce a model guide to land development that would be made available to government agencies in New York State is being undertaken by the New York City Partnership and the New York Land Institute.

2 Suspended
LEAD: Guy Carbonneau and Craig Ludwig have been suspended by the Montreal Canadiens for missing a curfew and were scratched from last night's game against the Minnesota North Stars.

Campus Life: Southern Methodist;   University Putting New Emphasis On Engineering
LEAD: After the Southern Methodist University board of trustees voted in December to phase out civil engineering, the institution's president, A. Kenneth Pye, committed himself to an aggressive marketing and public-awareness campaign to revive the remaining departments.


The Mysterious Router Explained
LEAD: DESPITE its usefulness, the router is a mysterious power tool to many amateurs, perhaps because its name does not describe its function.
A better name might be electric chisel, for a chisel is the hand tool whose operations the router duplicates most closely.

LEAD: THE annual rite of winter in Kent, the Housatonic Ice Watch, went on as planned this year, even though there was no ice to watch.


Madrid Offers Leniency for a Basque Truce

Congenial Setting for Italian Fare
LEAD: CINZANO'S in Fairfield is a year-old restaurant that sends mixed signals to first-time visitors.
Outside the entrance are handsome, terra cotta pots, but to enter the restaurant, you have to pass through a mundane bar.
Once inside the restaurant proper, you are greeted by a stylish, semiformal decor of tapestry-backed banquettes and chairs, rose-colored carpeting, wood paneling and a back wall covered with an oil painting of a pastoral Italian scene, the front a wall of greenhouse-style glass windows.


Mutual Funds;   High Expenses: Sign of Weakness
LEAD: Mutual fund expenses are rising.
But are investors getting their money's worth?
In most cases, the answer is no.
A fund with a high average expense ratio - the fund's expenses as a percentage of average net assets - usually turns in a weak performance, said D. Tyler Jenks, director of research for Kanon Bloch Carre &amp; Company, mutual fund consultants based in Boston.

The Mysterious Router Explained
LEAD: DESPITE its usefulness, the router is a mysterious power tool to many amateurs, perhaps because its name does not describe its function.
A better name might be electric chisel, for a chisel is the hand tool whose operations the router duplicates most closely.

LEAD: April wedding plans have been announced for Joan Feigenbaum, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

LEAD:
THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM.
Edited by Bernard Gwertzman and Michael T. Kaufman. (Times Books/Random House, Paper, $9.95.) The astonishing year 1989 began in the middle of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and ended with the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's absolute ruler for 24 years.
In between, much of the Communist world turned upside down.


Prison Bunks, Prison Values
LEAD: New York State's Corrections Commissioner, Thomas Coughlin, vows he will never put two convicts in a cell, but now the rising tide of prisoners is lapping perilously close to his resolve.

LEAD: As the day for balloting drew near, Vitaly P. Khlystov, an assembler at Mechanical Factory No. 2 and an unpaid organizer of one the plant's workshop-level Communist Party cells, was not breaking a sweat nor even breathing particularly hard in efforts to promote the party's candidates.

When the hard times don't materialize, you obviously will find yourself with an unexpected surplus of cash.


Presenting Arms
LEAD: The Army's standard combat weapon, the M-16, in use since the Vietnam War, is still considered the finest extant assault rifle.
Nonetheless, since 1982, when six weapons manufacturers were asked to develop new technologies, the Army has been seeking to improve on it.
Four companies have produced prototypes - including the Steyr-Mannlicher from Austria (above) - that are now being tested at Fort Benning, Ga., and at Aberdeen Proving Ground,

The Andy Rooney Story: A Drama Made for TV
LEAD: ANDY ROONEY, the crabby curmudgeon of CBS News, is back tonight on ''60 Minutes,'' two months before the end of a three-month suspension.
Portrayed at first as a compromise - CBS News responds to complaints about offensive remarks without banishing the offender forever - the suspension and its abrupt end ultimately had more to do with internal politics than with the issue of sensitivity versus censorship.


SPEAKERS THAT BRING THE ORCHESTRA INTO THE LIVING ROOM
LEAD: Having talked about inexpensive loudspeakers last week, it now seems fair to allot equal time to costly ones.
It is also fair to point out at the start that such speakers aren't for average listeners.
They are meant for passionate devotees of high-fidelity, unsparing in the effort to narrow the persistent gap between music (the real thing) and its electronic replica.


Campus Life: Temple;   Off-the-Wall Style Of Teaching Gets Their Attention
LEAD: When a freshman business major, Barry Abrams, registered for a class called ''Law in Society'' last semester, he had no idea he would be standing in front of 600 students playing the role of an Oxford-educated gorilla who got drunk one Labor Day and chomped off his neighbor's leg.

Switch in Latin Crops Won't Help Peasants
LEAD: To the Editor:


An Experts' Roundtable - Tax Strategies for Today
LEAD: The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was intended to simplify the nation's tax code, making economics rather than taxes the basis for financial decisions.

Cigarette Wars Move to a New Arena
LEAD: QUICK: Think Virginia Slims and what comes to mind?
For millions of Americans, the answer may be tennis stars rather than cigarettes.
Last week, accusing the cigarette companies of exploiting athletes' images of health to promote ''addiction, disease and death,'' Dr.
Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, called on players and promoters to shun tobacco's ''blood money.


For I.B.M. Users, Programs Abound for IBM
LEAD: An irony surrounds the bevy of tax-preparation computer programs on the market these days: Despite countless hours spent by program writers to distinguish their products from the competition, the programs for I.B.M. and compatible personal computers remain essentially alike.
As a result, a consumer would be wise to pick a program based on how easy it is to use, whether it offers adequate on-screen help and whether it can generate a finished tax return on the printer the consumer owns.


Lisa A. Bippart To Wed in May
LEAD: Lisa Anne Bippart and Timothy Markley Ghriskey plan to marry in May.

Kurt Weill Comes In From the Cold
LEAD: Kurt Weill would have been 90 years old last Friday, and the world seems to be in a mood finally to acknowledge the significance of a composer who until recently was considered only a marginal figure in 20th-century music.
Maybe the world is in too much of a hurry, considering this season's ill-conceived Broadway production of ''The Threepenny Opera'' or the unsuccessful movie version of it, ''Mack the Knife,'' which closed recently after a short engagement in a single New

A BRIDGE OF CHILDHOOD: Truman Capote's Southern Years.
By Marianne M. Moates. (Holt, $19.95.) ''He was a kook,'' declares Marianne M. Moates in her prologue to ''A Bridge of Childhood.'' ''He was a squeaky-voiced homosexual who drank too much.'' A rather crotchety view, but typical of the unreverential squint taken at Truman Capote in this homespun reminiscence.


POSTINGS: Mortgage Guarantees;   HOPE for Homes
LEAD: To help as many as 1,000 of their employees buy affordable homes, four New Jersey companies have joined a state agency there to underwrite mortgages in what may be the first such program in the country.

The Needs Of The Retarded
LEAD: I am pleased that Walter McCarthy brought up the topic of social skills for the retarded.
Interestingly, it is an area that does receive a great deal of emphasis in schools and agencies, while being an area that the public does not hear much about.


Corrections
LEAD: An answer in the Q &amp; A column on Feb. 18 misstated the dates of Ash Wednesday this year and next.
It fell last week, on Feb. 28, and in 1991 will be on Feb. 13.

San Francisco

Deregulation And Cable TV: Benefits for All
LEAD: HAVE consumers benefited from Federal deregulation of the cable industry?
State Senator Donald DiFrancesco thinks not.

The Mysterious Router Explained
LEAD: DESPITE its usefulness, the router is a mysterious power tool to many amateurs, perhaps because its name does not describe its function.

Happy April 15

Newhouse Jr. and his brother, Donald, walked out of Federal Tax Court in Washington last week with a victory in one of the biggest tax disputes in I.R.S.


ART VIEW
LEAD: Who can say whether, at the end of his life, George Caleb Bingham was more frustrated by the setbacks of his political career or by the failure of the public to acknowledge him as America's greatest painter.
More than half a century passed after his death in 1879 before even a modest display of his work was organized, by the City Art Museum in his chosen home of St.


Time to Give Henry V, No Champion of Thatcherism, a Break

LEAD: The No. 2 official in the Palestine Liberation Organization says in an article to be published on Sunday that Palestinians welcome the idea of a confederation with Jordan but only after the establishment of an independent Palestinian homeland.


THERE IS FRENCH OPERA, AND FRENCH OPERA
LEAD: In these contentious times, we hear a great deal about the single-issue voter, the citizen for whom nothing in the political spectrum matters except a candidate's stand on taxes or the burning of the flag.
A parallel phenomenon, I have found, is the single-issue reader, whose urge to correspond is set off only by mention of, say, Maria Callas or Glenn Gould or original instruments.


PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: It is true, of course, that anyone who wants to reach the top ranks of the game must have an independent mind and not passively take for granted whatever is promulgated by the authorities.

MONTANA: THE LAND BEFORE TIME

LEAD: Despite the move toward tax simplification, people in certain situations have tax concerns that call for special attention.

Corrections
LEAD: A listing of travel arrangements and hotel rates for Trinidad on Feb. 11 with an article about carnival misstated the availability of flights from New York to the island's capital, Port of Spain.
There is indeed direct service - with stops but without a change of aircraft - on BWIA and Pan Am.


Having Company? You Can Still Serve a Roast
LEAD: VIRGIL THOMSON used to say that when you have company, you serve a roast.
Perhaps this seems a little old-fashioned in these days of swordfish steaks and composed salads, but few things so firmly state that the meal is a special occasion.


A TOWER COMPETES WITH WALL STREET'S LAST GOLDEN AGE
LEAD: It is not only financiers who spent the 1980's trying to outdo the 1920's.
Architects played the same game, and a fair amount of the time managed to overextend themselves just as much, piling up significant levels of esthetic debt as they struggled to capture the combination of flamboyance and dignity that characterized the architecture of the 20's.


Mary G. O'Connor To Wed in August
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas D. O'Connor of Loudonville, N.Y., have announced August wedding plans for their daughter Mary Gallagher O'Connor and Christopher Smith Morgan, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

WHERE EAST MEETS WEST - TO BOOGIE!
LEAD: Dynasty Hao is a restaurant that has recently opened in Tokyo.
Its interior has been designed to resemble a bare-beamed SoHo loft, and its sound system speaks riffy American jazz.
The food, however, is spicy Taiwanese: pork dumplings, sauteed pumpkin with garlic, minced chicken in lettuce.
The restaurant is the second of this name to be opened in Tokyo by Kiddieland, an upscale Japanese toy store.


Corrections
LEAD: A report in the Campus Life column last Sunday about Washington University in St.
Louis referred incorrectly to the classics department at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
It is not being eliminated.


WHEN A PREGNANT WOMAN DRINKS
LEAD: Your article was informative and, at times, chilling in its implications.
However, I do not feel this subject can be thoroughly addressed without presenting the significant issue of male alcoholism and its effect on the fetus.
NAOMI HOROWITZ

'The Sound of Music,' Without Alps
LEAD: As in many other things, New Yorkers are in a class by themselves when it comes to ''The Sound of Music.'' The Rodgers and Hammerstein musical is staged more than 500 times a year in the United States and Canada (it's also very popular in Japan), but the New York City Opera production opening Thursday night at the New York State Theater and running through Sunday, April 22, will be only the second full-scale revival in New York since the musical first came to Broadway on Nov.


Lifestyle: Sunday Menu;   A Crisp Bread You Bake Yourself
LEAD: Packages of lavosh are appearing in more and more stores.
Lavosh is not the crispy cracker-like bread that has become so popular, but the soft variety that comes folded in half and then tucked in on both sides.
There are two sheets to a package.


Question of the Week;   Was the Strickland Trade A Good One?
LEAD: Two years from now Strickland will have developed into a better offensive and defensive player than Mark Jackson, and the Knicks will still be without championship rings.

Question of the Week;   Was the Strickland Trade A Good One?
LEAD: A young and talented player with an attitude problem traded for a former All-Star, solid and dependable, 10 years his senior.
A good deal?
I suppose Al Bianchi would also trade Darryl Strawberry for Dave Winfield.

Nicaragua Opens Possibilities For Regional Change
LEAD: THE overwhelming election victory of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and her opposition coalition in Nicaragua has done more than merely stun pollsters, pundits and the ruling Sandinistas.
Taken in tandem with the United States invasion of Panama, Mrs.
Chamorro's triumph last week may signal the possibility of a significant change in the politics of Central America and in


CBS and Writers Near Pact
LEAD: The east and west coast branches of the Writers Guild of America reached an agreement with CBS Friday on a three-year contract that will run through 1992.
The contract covers 325 network television and radio employees in New York and Washington and employees at CBS-owned stations in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.


The Garden as a Gate Into the Neighborhood
LEAD: HOW to become part of a neighborhood?
Buy a house with a garden.
Not a garden that's handed over to other people to care for - that destroys the whole purpose.
It's all right to have somebody cut the lawn and clip the hedge but the garden itself - the dirty earthy part, the part that gets under your nails and ruins your manicure - must be your baby.


Mandela Thanks Zambians for Standing By the African National Congress


Soggy Winter Gives Huskies Too Much Mush, Too Little 'Mush!'
LEAD: OUT in Cockaponset State Forest in Haddam, a team of six Siberian huskies paced, howled and whined, while their owner, Lloyd Wyatt, slipped yellow harnesses around their necks.


PASTIMES: Stamps
LEAD: Se-tenants stand together.
These are groups of different stamps, perforated and printed on one sheet.
They are usually collected in blocks or strips without separating them.
Hobbyists in the United States will be most familiar with the sheets of the 50 state flags (1976), the 50 state birds and flowers (1982) and the 50 stamps picturing wildlife (1987).


College Basketball;   Arizona Shuts Down Payton
LEAD: Matt Muehlbach had 29 points and the Arizona defense stifled Oregon State's Gary Payton as the Wildcats beat the Beavers, 87-60, today to gain a share of the regular-season Pacific-10 title.


THE COURT PHOTOGRAPHER OF BEBOP
LEAD: If the kingdom of bebop had a court photographer, it was surely Herman Leonard.
Among his sharply etched black-and-white studies are some of the most famous images of such musicians as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Fats Navarro and the others who spearheaded modern jazz during the 1940's and 50's.


Why a Virtuoso Jazz Pianist Still Provokes Debate
LEAD: The brilliant virtuoso pianist Art Tatum, a major influence on jazz through his own recordings and the playing of musicians who spent time studying him - Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane, among others - can still get a table of jazz fans arguing and gnashing their teeth over his relevance.


A Tour of the Ancient World in Syria
LEAD: ''WITH the right agricultural management, Syria could become another California.'' This was the view of a Dutch agronomist with whom I shared a taxi on my arrival at Damascus Airport.
On my departure a week later, I wondered whether the same might be true of Syrian tourism one day.
If you tend to think of Syria along with Iran, Libya and Lebanon as places no reasonable American would visit, it is also true that no Americans have been taken hostage in Syria, that it has diplomatic relations with the United States and that, while the State


Brandy Johnson Falls by the Wayside
LEAD: The harsh realities of world-class gymnastics became painfully clear to Brandy Johnson today.
One, it is not a sport for the unhealthy.
Two, a younger athlete can pop up anywhere, anytime.

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Manhattan Office Vacancies;   Differing Definitions Make the Numbers Slippery
LEAD: NO two analysts agree on the percentages or the dollars.
Nor do they agree on what defines an office building or what constitutes midtown Manhattan.
They don't even agree on whether empty space is ''vacant'' or ''available,'' or whether it can be measured accurately in the first place.

Having Company? You Can Still Serve a Roast
LEAD: VIRGIL THOMSON used to say that when you have company, you serve a roast.
Perhaps this seems a little old-fashioned in these days of swordfish steaks and composed salads, but few things so firmly state that the meal is a special occasion.


The Senate, and the Sewer
LEAD: Plausibly, 1990 can be the year in which America cleans up the way it pays for politics - if two adversaries can be conquered in coming days.
The first is Republicans inside the Senate who seem determined, once again, to torpedo all serious reform.
The other is Democrats outside the Senate who seem determined to kill the one reform that would do the most good.

Viewing the Arts And Government
LEAD: According to Prof.
Irving Sandler [''Championing Free Artistic Expression,'' Feb. 11] , ''decisions about what'' Government will ''finance should be left to people in the arts; the Federal Government and bureaucrats shouldn't set up any kind of guidelines.''


Multiplex Theaters Gain in Downtowns
LEAD: ALTHOUGH some communities are welcoming multiplex theaters to their old downtowns, residents of other towns are opposing plans for the theaters' development and expansion.


Newark Airport Gains But What About Noise?
LEAD: On the surface, the Feb. 11 article on the expansion of international flights at Newark Airport was nothing but good news - so good that it almost seemed like a self-congratulatory press release from the Port Authority.
A peek beneath the surface, however, reveals that the Port Authority should be chastising itself rather than patting itself on the back.patting itself on the back.


Fashion;   Cork Is Back as an Accessory for Spring

REAL FOOD IN L.A.
LEAD: The average person's notion of food in Los Angeles is that it's supermodern, trendy and eclectic.
Like all cliches, this is largely true.
There's a place on Melrose that serves Tex-Mex dim sum, and a favorite kind of sushi, with avocado, is called California maki.
L.A., with its vista west to the Orient, its rich stew of immigrants, its diverse cultures, encourages strange mixtures and makes everything its own, while at the same time preserving individual flavors.


Reviews/Music;   Erotica Trio at the Y; This Debut Is Official
LEAD: The Eroica Trio, a chamber group that was formed at the Juilliard School in 1986, made its official debut Wednesday evening with an enjoyable program of Mozart, Schubert and Shostakovich at the 92d Street Y.

Reviews/Music;   Fiddler Williams's Jazz
LEAD: About halfway through his first set at the West End Gate on Thursday night, Claude (Fiddler) Williams fiddled away at a solo cadenza as an introduction to the tune ''Laura.'' Soaring through chords and tossing off complicated, jumping rhythms, he eventually wound his way to the first notes of the melody.

Message for Nicaragua's Victors: Things Must Get Better, and Fast
LEAD: With the store shelves largely bare and one-third of the work force without a job, Nicaraguans are serving notice that they expect the newly elected government to bring about rapid improvement or face political consequences.


WHEN A PREGNANT WOMAN DRINKS
LEAD: As a writer working on a guide to pregnancy, I am familiar with the dangers posed by alcohol.
Yet, I take issue with the way in which Elisabeth Rosenthal uncritically quotes Dr.
Claire D. Coles.
Dr.
Coles seems to regard even the slightest aberration in behavior as a likely symptom of the effect.
The fact that a month-old baby ''should be calm'' but isn't is used as evidence that the infant is suffering from the effects of prenatal substance abuse.


LIFE AND DEATH IN THE MA SAI MARA
LEAD: He seemed somehow to have ascended into ''The Heaven of Animals.'' In a poem by that name, James Dickey described what a paradise for animals would be like:


All About/Machine Tools;   Fissures in the Industrial Bedrock

Manufacturers rely on them for equipment to forge, cut, grind, drill, bend, trim and stamp the blocks and sheets of metal that become cars, airplanes and appliances.


Gerard Depardieu Stokes The Creative Fires With Passion
LEAD: All afternoon Gerard Depardieu has been talking about his rage for acting, for getting deeply embroiled with auteur directors and their creative torments, for rollicking from film to film, from stage to stage, with an almost reckless abandon and outlaw joy.
Now, suddenly, he thrusts up his hand:


Maryland Penalized
LEAD: The National Collegiate Athletic Association has decided to levy sanctions against Maryland's men's basketball program, but is not quite ready to release the information, an official of the agency was quoted as saying. ''I'm working out some kind of schedule with the institution,'' David Berst, the N.C.A.A.


A VISION OF AN INVISIBLE PYRAMID
LEAD: In 1979 I saw an aerial photograph of the Mayan pyramid at Coba.
The pyramid itself was invisible because trees and vines had grown over it.
There was only a green hump in the green jungle.


Spartans Nearer To Big Ten Title
LEAD: A mere 48 hours after defeating Michigan in what Coach Jud Heathcote called Michigan State's most significant victory in several seasons, the surprising Spartans pulled off what may be their most important victory of the year this afternoon, defeating Minnesota, 75-73, in a grueling overtime game at Williams


Fighting The War On Cigs
LEAD: The ad looks like this.
There is a woman.
She has great clothes, important earrings, big hair, some attitude.
There is a white box beneath the woman.
The box says, ''Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy.'' The ad appears to be selling two things: sex and death.


In Czechoslovakia's Hearty Pubs, Goulash and Beer
LEAD: ALTHOUGH Czechoslovakia has a history of beer brewing dating to 1082, it did not develop a worldwide reputation for the craft until 1842, when the process that resulted in Pilsner beer was perfected.


Dedicated Guardian for Historic Treasures
LEAD: SINCE she became the Wadsworth Atheneum's first curator of African-American art in September, Barbara Hudson's life has been a series of firsts.

The bridegroom is a son of Sylvia Sarah Rosenberg of Passaic, N.J., and the late Emanuel


Corruption and Corporate 'Perks'
LEAD: To the Editor If your section had less concern for corporations and more for their stockholders, ''Butlers and Crystal as Well as a View'' (Feb. 4) would have appeared on page 1 of The Times, and not on page 29 of your section.
More important, the story would not have been about the ''bosses' '' uniformed butlers, crystal decanters, peeled oranges, Acapulco retreats and other ''perks,'' but about their corruption.


Red Ransom Booed as Bright Again Wins by 1 1/4
LEAD: The outlook for the Kentucky Derby grew murkier than ever today when Shot Gun Scott led a blanket finish of long shots across the wire in the Fountain of Youth Stakes and Red Ransom was beaten for the first time in an earlier race at Gulfstream Park.

At Its Best, Love Is Far From a Fairy Tale
LEAD: In fairy tales, love songs and most Hollywood movies, any boy-meets- girl story takes the long way around to proving the predictable; the neat trajectory of conventional romance always shows that Cinderella and the Prince, tomato and tomahto, Tracy and Hepburn were right for each other all along.
But in real life, who hasn't been an idiot in love, defying the odds to find the wrong person at the least convenient time to create an emotional mess?


Postpartum Problems, Then and Now
LEAD: Kathy Shaskan's article, ''Postpartum Syndrome: A Patient's View'' (Opinion page, Feb. 11), rang a discordant bell with me.
In the 1940's, I had four babies in seven years and was quite familiar with the subsequent depression of which the article speaks.


Saving to Retire? Tax Code Helps
LEAD: RETIREMENT can be the time to enjoy the fruits of a life's labor, or it can be a time of penny-pinching uncertainty.
To be sure it is the first, an understanding of the role tax laws play, both in saving for retirement and during retirement, is essential.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My house was built in 1926, and the original banisters and newel posts had many coats of paint on them that I stripped off.
I found that the wood had been stained a dark color that I could not remove with alcohol, bleach and other chemicals.
I applied two coats of a pigmented shellac sealer, then two coats of acrylic latex and two coats of semi-gloss.


America's Position in the Economic Race: What the Numbers Show and Conceal
LEAD: These are days of confirmation that the American economic system remains the model for those yearning to be rich.
But to some, this is a moment of irony: Even as the world learns to stop worrying and love Big Macs, the American economy seems to be losing its productive edge.
The nation is borrowing billions to cover expenses and to build high-tech toys like the stealth bomber, the theory goes, while everything from vocational education to computer-chip factories slides into obsolescence.


Playing for Bigger Stakes?
LEAD: THE Rev.
Jesse Jackson has used an Archimedean approach to politics - ''leverage,'' he calls it - to nudge the Democratic Party this way and that in recent years.
But Mr.
Jackson also wants to move the world, and for that, he has decided, the Mayor's office in Washington is not the place to stand.

In Defense of Himself
LEAD: To the Editor:


Has Joe Roth Got the Key to Success at Fox?
LEAD: When Joe Roth walks from the 20th Century Fox commissary to his office in the executive building a few hundred yards away, he is the master of nearly everything his eye can see.
But he ambles down the street instead of bestriding the Fox lot like a mogul.


TRACEY ULLMAN - QUEEN OF THE 'SKITCOM'
LEAD: A work in desperation.
That's what the writer/director James L. Brooks (''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ''Terms of Endearment'') once called ''The Tracey Ullman Show.'' He was in a position to know, being co-creator of the series and one of the executive producers.
Fortunately, with Fox Broadcasting itching to set up a fourth network, the show was allowed to lurch on.

About Men;   A Back-RoadHorror Ride
LEAD: MY JOB WAS TO open beer bottles and load guns.

A Controversy Is Exploding
LEAD: I was disappointed in the interview with Irving Sandler, co-founder of Artists Space.
The interviewer asked if Artists Space would reject pornography or if the National Endowment for the Arts should finance art criticizing political figures.
Academics are in near unanimity on these questions.


Recognizing Old Age When It Rounds the Corner
LEAD: AT the age of 79, I was facing the fact that the lease on my Scarsdale home was about to expire.
To renew would mean a big rent increase, since the apartment was not covered under the Emergency Tenants Protection Act.


As Other Deductions Vanish, Real Estate Endures
LEAD: There's little mystery to successful investing.
No matter what the investments, the key, most financial advisers and accountants agree, is careful planning.


Tax Simplification Proves Elusive
LEAD: For the vast majority of Americans, the monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986 has meant slightly lower taxes and an easier time figuring them out.
But for some people, most of them well-to-do, the new law has meant much higher taxes and a nightmare of unfathomable rules and regulations.


Probing the Limits of Biography
LEAD: ONCE she won an Oscar.
Now her agent hangs up on her.
Once she was the victim of the distortions of an unauthorized biographer who snooped around outside her beach house in Malibu.
Now she has hired a live-in journalist to record her story - honestly.


Curtains for 'Chorus Line' and for a Stage of City History
LEAD: ''A CHORUS LINE,'' the hit musical that is to close this month after a record-breaking Broadway run of 15 years, in some ways is the ideal New York story, both in its own success and in the story it tells.
In it, 17 dancers try out for jobs in a show and, although almost all are destined to be losers, their up-and-down careers represent the mood of eternal hope that keeps attracting out-of-towners to New York.


Americas Tower Now Goes to Arbitration
LEAD: AN arbitration panel will begin next week to untangle the issues in a convoluted dispute between development partners that has halted construction of a huge office project on Avenue of the Americas between 45th and 46th Streets, known as Americas Towers.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:
Boxing Breland Retains Title: Mark Breland, a 26-year-old New Yorker, knocked down Lloyd Honeyghan of Britain six times in less than nine minutes in London yesterday and retained his World Boxing Association welterweight title when the referee stopped the fight at 2 minutes 15 seconds of the third round.(AP) Tennis Gilbert Defeats Tauson: Top-seeded Brad Gilbert of the United States beat Michael Tauson of Denmark yesterday, 6-3, 6-3, in the semifinals of the A.B.N.


Hockey;   Rangers' Streak Halted by Whalers

This season they have won in streaks and lost at length.
Tonight, in a fashion that was both painful and familiar, they crashed.


Not Just A Few Prudes . . .
LEAD: To the Editor:


Macintax Zips Through Forms
LEAD: A Macintosh program that costs less than $100 may offer the least painful way to complete a 1989 tax return - short of getting someone else to do it.

Review/Television;   Teen-Agers on the Right Side of Reality
LEAD: Television entertainment is often accused, justifiably, of being on a collision course with reality, and images of teen-agers are a particularly good case in point.
Most daily headlines about young people are not encouraging as they follow crises ranging from education failures to drug abuse.
Last week it was announced that New York City was doubling its staff of lawyers assigned to prosecute juveniles, because of an enormous surge in Family


Home-Court Advantage

Bad Bargain With Exxon
LEAD: The Exxon Valdez oil spill was arguably the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history, so it's reasonable to expect those responsible to be called to account, clean up the mess and pay damages.

'Handmaid's Tale,' Adapted From Atwood Novel
''The Handmaid's Tale'' is that rare totalitarian fantasy in which the tyrants plant tulips and wear pearls.
The United States, now renamed Gilead, has become a male-controlled police state dedicated to the oppression of women, yet there are very few men in either Margaret Atwood's novel or Volker Schlondorff's film version.
The men are either roaming the corridors of power, fighting as soldiers called Angels, or (if they are nonwhite) relegated to far-flung colonies in badly polluted parts of the world.
So for the most part, it is only the women we see.
Women called Aunts, dressed in high heels and loose, demure brown outfits that would have been just right for office jobs in the days when women were still allowed to hold them, are now in charge of teaching moral pieties and laying down the law.
Women called Wives wear an overpowering shade of blue and preside over large houses in the suburbs.
Women called Marthas, in gray-green maids' uniforms, keep these houses running smoothly.
Women called Handmaids dress in red and have been robbed of all rights, reduced to only two basic functions: breeding babies (because pollution has rendered most other women barren) and buying groceries.

Daly and three young proteges are suspended from their duties after a drug investigation turns murderous, but they stay with the case because they know they're on to something big.

OLDER CHILDREN AND DIVORCE
LEAD: It seems to me that Barbara S. Cain's article ''Older Children and Divorce'' (Feb. 18) does not add anything new to that tired subject.
We all know that everyone suffers in a divorce.
However, everyone suffers growing up.
The young people mentioned in your article might have had different problems in nondivorcing families, but problems they would have had.

Saving the Most On Europe Fares
LEAD: PAN AMERICAN'S Eurosaver fare from New York to London for travelers leaving May 31 is $535 round trip.

Finding Out If It Will Play In Peoria
LEAD: So how did they play in Enfield, Conn.?

Review/Music;   Pianist Plays Rarity By Debussy
LEAD: James Barbagallo's thoughtful and elegant choice of music for his Alice Tully Hall piano recital on Thursday night pretty much reflected the thoughtfulness and elegance with which it was addressed.

Co-op Crash: Just Fine With Me
LEAD: In the 80's, we were asked to feel sorry for the homeless.
In the 90's, we are asked to feel sorry for the people who share much of the blame for putting the homeless on the street.
I have in mind those who, through frenzied real-estate speculation, have sent the value of New York City apartments soaring and who are only now beginning to pay fair property taxes based on those outrageous levels.

Notes From the Revolution
LEAD: The final days of 1989 brought with them the end of the Communist era.
The system that had proclaimed itself the future of the world was buried in the ashes of burning Romanian towns.
No doubt there will still be police and military relapses, no doubt various epigones of Communism will still tantalize with their baubles and sow dissension with their calumnies.

Fashion: On the Street;   When It's All Right To Be Two-Faced
LEAD: Take a jacket made of fake lamb's fur, line it with polka-dot dress silk, and what have you got?
An imaginative and versatile piece of clothing that has suddenly captured imaginations on both sides of the Atlantic.

Baseball Impasse: Locking Out for No. 1
LEAD: Why is baseball so consistently unable to reach collective bargaining agreements without a work stoppage?

Managing;   Getting Women Down to the Site
LEAD: Robert E. Coker, the project superintendent at the paper plant expansion in this tiny town just outside Savannah, thinks Sheryl T. Hamlett is a terrific carpenter's helper.

THE MUSICAL MYSTERY OF ST. JOAN
LEAD: What is it about Joan of Arc that frustrates the efforts of opera composers to bring her to life?

THE BEST OF ABBIE HOFFMAN.
Edited by Daniel Simon with Abbie Hoffman. (Four Walls Eight Windows, $21.95.) At the Chicago conspiracy trial 20 years ago, the judge gently scolded Tom Hayden: ''Fellows as smart as you could do awfully well under [the American]  system.'' Those words would have been lost on Abbie Hoffman, who remained, in his actions and, as this book shows, in his writings, incorrigibly and imaginatively subversive to the end.

It is now my sewing room.
The table is just the right height for me, and I can spread out the fabric on its expanse of dark green when I cut out things.
It's quiet there.
I listen to the radio and work away, and a flat piece of cloth takes on shape as I work, grows breast-shaped curves and hips, gathers itself into a waistband, to which I have added an inch because I am fatter than I wish

Men's Style;   Milan's Great Escape
LEAD: Standing shoulder to shoulder, their eyes shaded by Mountie hats, they looked like extras from a Nelson Eddy movie.
But these young men were models, costumed for winter by Valentino, one of Italy's reigning fashion designers.
And their cinematically scarlet jackets, lumberjack shirts and Hudson Bay blanket coats were not destined for the wilds but for some of the most exclusive men's shops in cities on several continents.


Unseating the Electrical Utilities' Monopoly

Teaching the 'Sir Winston' Method

Concern For the Soul Of the New Germany
LEAD: THERE is a tendency among some thoughtful Germans to lament this winter's developments as a noble revolution gone tawdry.

WHAT'S DOING IN: Cairo
LEAD: Cairo does not lend itself to easy or quick discovery.
Even driving into town from the airport, the visitor is struck by the results of an unrestrained lurch into modernity: the noise of honking cars cramming the roads and bridges, the throngs of people on the streets below.
With a fast-growing population of around 14 million,

Silent Enmity
LEAD: During the eight years of the bitter Iran-Iraq War, no place was harder hit than Basra, Iraq's chief port and second-largest city, which, owing to casualties and citizens fleeing the siege, saw its population, once more than a million, diminish by half.

The Gossip Column
LEAD: The attitude about gossip these days reminds me of an attitude people had about sex 20 years ago.
It was called the sexual revolution, and it was as tiresome as can be.
It ignored any possibility that people had copulated in Edsels, or that bonafide grandparents had in the past-and perhaps in the present - chased one another around the kitchen in their underwear.

UConn and Syracuse Advance to Final

Idaho Says No

In February, the sky turns deep blue, and blinding snow robes the western summits and chokes the craggy canyons.

Hawkins's Compelling, Luminous 'New Moon'

LEAD: In Boris Spassky's contract for the Linares International Tournament, which began Feb. 18 in Spain, one clause read that he must, ''not make any compromises before move 40.'' The tournament sponsor, Luis Rentero, did not want the former world champion to show up in body but not in spirit, aiming for quick draws, as he so often does.


Question Of the Week;   How Accountable Is Jim Valvano?

Review/Music;   Violinist Gives Recital Using Instrument Made of Plastic
LEAD: In ''The Graduate,'' Dustin Hoffman's character, Ben, is given a single word of career advice by a friend of his parents: Plastics.
Presumably Ben ignored the suggestion, but by the time the film was made, in 1967, the Italian-born guitarist and instrument-maker Mario Maccaferri had proved the value of that advice, having made his fortune manufacturing plastic ukeleles, hangers, clothespins and tape cassettes.


Mixed Reviews
LEAD: Washington is not without literary tradition, of course, but when a member of Congress writes a book that somehow makes money, it is often suspected that something unseemly has transpired.
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, raised such suspicions about a book written by former House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned last year after a House ethics panel found improprieties in connection with his book sales.

Back to Basics on Chicken
LEAD: THERE is a story, possibly apocryphal, of the novice cook who put a chicken in the oven to roast.

Screaming Won't Help
LEAD: ''I hear America singing,'' wrote Walt Whitman in the last century.
Today, he would have difficulty hearing himself think.
According to audiologists, 20 million Americans are exposed daily to persistent noise loud enough to cause hearing loss.
The racket also contributes to high blood pressure, peptic ulcers, aggression, poor reading, lack of consideration and, understandably, the urge to give up.

He was 75 years old and lived in Lakeland.


Review/Dance;   Cremins and Wyoming And an Overwhelming Hall
LEAD: Some theatrical spaces enhance choreography.
Others serve as purely neutral containers for it.
Still others seem absolutely hostile to any form of dancing that might take place in them.
One space of the last type is surely the Great Hall at Cooper Union, where on Thursday night Patricia Cremins and Wyoming, her New York-based company, presented ''Landing With and Without the Map.


Q and A

Institutional Apartments


Correction
LEAD: An article in the Sports Section on Feb. 25 about the experiences of black players in the National Hockey League incorrectly described the professional level at which an incident involving Willie O'Ree, the first black player in the N.H.L., took place.

Going Abroad Without Going Broke
LEAD: AMERICANS can still only hope for a return of the days when the mighty dollar made foreign travel a bargain.

Quality Control for Health Care
LEAD: A painful back injury recently sent me to top medical specialists in Washington and New York.

On Encouraging A Healthy Life Style
LEAD: The reply by R. S. McCord (''Some Suggestions for Better Health'') gave a grossly simplistic view of modern health care.
The health care professionals he listed may not be able to help every patient 100 percent of the time, but then physicians can't either.

Music in Which Words Need Only Sound Poetic
LEAD: Empty-headed pop music usually comes in the form of sleek, high-tech disco or pounding, three-chord rock.
But the Church, an Australian quartet that has just released its seventh album, ''Gold Afternoon Fix'' (Arista AL-8579; all three formats) makes lightweight pop of a different sort.
Instead of disco's synthetic tracks and drum machines, or commercial rock's tired riffs and cliched baby-I-love-you lyrics, the Church combines 12-string guitar, bass and drums with dreamy images to make an elegant surface of sound.


INTERNATIONAL ISSUE: The Taste of Three Cities;   High Energy at Parisian Brasseries
LEAD: PARIS, we are endlessly assured, is no longer truly Paris but instead a city, like many others, in thrall to sheiks, Japanese conglomerates and fast-food operatives.

Pay Cut Is Now a Seldom-Used Tool
LEAD: Rich Gedman, the Boston catcher who has forgotten how to hit, suffered the maximum 20 percent pay cut this year, his salary plummeting from $1.15 million to $920,000.

POSTINGS: A New Kind of Mortgage;   The Fannie Mae Two-Step
LEAD: One problem with long-term, fixed-rate mortgages is that most homeowners sell their houses long before their loans are repaid.
This, in turn, forces them to pay higher interest rates for the first years than with an adjustable-rate mortgage.
But if they have a short-term, adjustable-rate loan and decide not to move after all they usually must pay several thousand dollars in refinancing costs when obtaining a new mortgage, and sometimes face major increases in interest rates as well.

Review/Concert;   Marimba Quartet and Calabash Women

When Nature Became God, Art Changed

For many of us, it is a time to stay away from the nightspots and the crowds that crowd in from suburbia.

A Glimpse Behind The Bamboo Curtain
LEAD: AS the mists rise each morning, the calm and graceful Nam Khan River in northern Laos slowly takes shape, ornamented with saffron-robed Buddhist monks on the banks and naked children swimming in the middle, and destined a few hundred yards later to end its journey in the embrace of the larger, ever-churning Mekong River.


On Language;   Virile Women Target Tobacco Men

LEAD: Capt.

Reviews/Theater;   A Kaleidoscope of Language Onstage and on Video
LEAD: On one level, John Jesurun's ''Everything That Rises Must Converge'' is an incoherent play on the subject of language.

Review/Music;   Two French Church Organists in Recitals
LEAD: In France, the position of titular organist of a cathedral carries a kind of prestige that the closest American equivalent - a church organist post - does not quite equal.
The reasons are complex and culture-bound, but to a large extent the status of French church posts grows from the fact that so many of the organists who held them were also composers who left enduring repertories of organ works and liturgical settings.

Mr.
Gorbachev, having already run the Soviet Union for five years, has now become its first full-fledged President. ''Prezident'' is the way some Russians transliterate the term, but the important difference between chief executives there and here is not one letter.

LEAD: Demi Dieu (Bakary Bamba) is a big pineapple mogul in a small weedy Ivory Coast town, and by his own boastful lights he's a man to be reckoned with.

But to the five wives who minister to his every need and sometimes, when the mood strikes, feed him hot sauce so potent it makes him gasp, power is strictly relative.

Rich and Poor in One World of Film

They have dancers battle it, push aggressively through it or create the illusion that they are tugging or slashing at it.
Merce Cunningham treated space in a different way in ''Trails'' and ''Five Stone Wind,'' the two works the Merce Cunningham Dance Company presented for the first time this season on Thursday night at the City Center Theater, 131 West 55th

Art Exhibit Unsettles Airport Workers
LEAD: The panel of hands is surely the most startling piece of art on the wall of the airport's baggage claim area - white hands, fashioned from plaster and tape, groping, grasping, clinging to each other.
The hands overshadow even the chest X-ray and the side view of a skull in a neighboring artwork.

OWNER'S NEW PROPOSAL IS SAID TO IGNORE SALARY-ARBITRATION ISSUE
LEAD: With their spring training lockout 30 days old, baseball's club owners gambled yesterday that they could get an agreement with the players by offering a new proposal that ignores the issue the union has felt most strongly about: salary-arbitration eligibility.
The owners, in fact, withdrew their bonus-pool concept, which would have benefited players with two to three years of major league service.


NBC IS SELLING MULTIMEDIA 51% OF CLEVELAND TV STATION
LEAD: NBC will sell a majority ownership stake in WKYC-TV, its Cleveland television station, to Multimedia Inc., the companies announced yesterday.

Cross-Training Shoes Fit the Needs of More Than One Sport
LEAD: New technology has changed the look of athletic footwear dramatically in the last decade.
The all-around sneaker has been replaced with intricate footwear for individual sports activities.
But the newest wave is a return to the basics: a cross-training shoe that fits the needs of more than one sport, yet makes the sneaker look like a distant cousin.


Broadcasting Awards Given For Coverage of Disasters
LEAD: San Francisco and Charleston, S.C., radio and television stations won Peabody Awards on Thursday for their coverage of two natural disasters: the earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area last October and the hurricane that swept the Carolinas and the Caribbean last September.


Even More, Paris Is the Place to Show
LEAD: With the Karl Lagerfeld opening on Friday, the serious part of the French fall and winter showings began.
Not too serious, of course.
Not with bracelets worn three at a time on the sleeves of jackets - on the upper arm, just below the elbow and at the wrist.
Or single earrings dangling past the bosom, or elaborate gold medallions on the chest.

He said 4,022 people left the payroll last month.


Jazz That Speaks Latin, and Vice Versa
LEAD: Though jazz and Latin music have mingled regularly over the last century, their relationship has always been uneasy.
Despite their similar roots, their rhythms and sense of form are different, and from the 1940's on, their uses have separated.
Where Latin music, meant for dancing, is still essentially functional, jazz has long been content to use the vestiges of the dance impulse - riffs, swing - to keep the rhythms supple.


After Killings, Turks Fear a Repeat of the Past
LEAD: The killings of two policemen in January were bad enough.
But after gunmen in recent weeks killed a leading lawyer and a prominent newspaper columnist, in street attacks in Ankara and Istanbul, Turks have begun nervously asking themselves whether they are back to the terrorism that led to a military coup in 1980.

His assailant was identified as Cornelius Starks, who was charged with aggravated assault.


'Caller ID': More Than Progress

But he was granted a second chance to take the test.


QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Next Week;   Should College Athletes Be Paid?
LEAD: The Times welcomes letters from readers.
Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
Letters should be addressed to The Editor, Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or return unpublished letters.


Picking a Banjo Through 50 Years of Protests
LEAD: TO hear Pete Seeger tell it, the singer and political activist is falling apart.
His voice is ''50 percent gone,'' he says, and he gets by only by ''persuading the audience to sing along.'' His memory is going, too, and that's not all. ''I can't remember where I put my hearing aid five minutes ago,'' he says.


A REPORT INDICTS SUDAN ON RIGHTS
LEAD: The military junta in the Sudan has introduced an era of repression marked by the detention and torture of suspected political opponents that surpasses the worst excesses of the longtime military Government that ruled from 1969 to the mid-80's, a human rights observer group says.


BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME, KIPLING: REJECTION SLIPS FOR THE AGES
LEAD: Why, oh why, were the merits of remarkable books ever in doubt?
Perhaps nothing is so painful as rejection, and nothing so sweet, especially to an author, as wrongful rejection overruled by history.
The assessments that follow did not deter the writers from trying again, nor the public from ultimately reading the books.


All About/Commuter Airlines;   Deregulation Left Only the Strong
LEAD: In 1978, Air Wisconsin had a small fleet of aging, 19-passenger Swearingen Metro planes that shuttled most of its 397,000 riders that year to and from its hub in Appleton, Wis.
Just 12 years later, Air Wisconsin has become the nation's largest commuter airline.
Its turboprops and jets, with as many as 100 seats, carry more than two million passengers a year.

Michael J. Strok of Annapolis, Md.
Mr.
Mehrle is the son of Jean Baskett-Mehrle of Evansville, Ind., and Mr.
Mehrle Jr. of Houston.


TALKING: Rent Rules;   Tenant Rights In Flux
LEAD: TENANT rights, especially in a highly regulated environment like New York City's, are in a constant state of flux.
Court decisions, administrative rulings and legislative amendments make it hard for tenants and landlords to keep up with their rights and responsibilities.
This is particularly true for the narrowly focused changes that do not make headlines when they are announced.


Spill Forces Evacuation
LEAD: About 12,000 gallons of the chemical solvent cumene spilled aboard a tanker in the Delaware River during unloading this morning, forcing the evacuation of about 250 people from a three-block area.
Five workers at a pier near the spill were treated at a hospital for headaches and nausea after breathing the fumes of the chemical.

Question Of the Week;   Will the Rangers' Deals Lead To the Cup?
LEAD: As of this weekend, the new additions have yet to prove their value on the road to the cup. (The team was winning when Nicholls joined and later, when Gartner was added.) The line of Kisio-Muller-Ogrodnick is the most consistent and productive.
The rest of the team - when uninjured - is of major value.


East European Jews Bring Mixed Reports Of the New Societies
LEAD: A group of prominent Jews from Eastern Europe have come to the United States to express hope for rising Jewish consciousness in the region and to voice concern over new signs of anti-Semitism.


Connecticut G.O.P. Upset Over Party Adviser

Ivy Covers New Ground
LEAD: TRADITIONALLY, THE MAN WHO FAVORS THE IVY League look is a man who comports himself according to the Protestant work ethic.
He values steadiness, reliability and industry.
For decades, his uniform has been a Brooks Brothers suit, rep tie and button-down shirt. ''It's what sociologists call 'an instrumental orientation,' '' says Ruth P.


Your Own Account
LEAD: The idea behind the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was to simplify taxes.
Whether that has worked is debatable, but there are now far fewer ways to cut taxes.
Still, taxpayers have dozens of questions on what is allowable under the Internal Revenue Service code.
The following are some that accountants hear regularly.


Anne Segrest Weds Ned McCulloch in Georgia
LEAD: Anne Elizabeth Segrest, an associate in the law firm of Gordon &amp; Barnett, and Edgar H. McCulloch 3d, a lobbyist for the Service Employees International Union, both in Washington, were married yesterday.

World's Tallest Building Raises Doubts in Chicago
LEAD: Approval has been granted by the City Council here for the world's tallest building.
But will it ever be built?

A Police Death Raises Questions
LEAD: I am writing in response to the article headlined ''Questions For Guido'' and, in fact, in response to the entire situation surrounding the death of Detective Wustenhoff and the subsequent funeral ceremonies.
I am writing because I have additional questions.


Question Of the Week;   Will the Rangers' Deals Lead To the Cup?
LEAD: There is no way that the Rangers' cup will ever runneth over until the Rangers get a bonafide heavyweight to insure that their star players do not get runneth over.

New Rules Cut Use of Tranquilizers
LEAD: AS a result of a state regulation aimed at limiting prescriptions for such tranquilizers as Valium, the use of such drugs has been cut in half, to 250,000 prescriptions a year in Nassau and 150,000 in Suffolk, according to State Department of Health officials.

Rivele on Feb. 18 misidentified an informant whose cooperation with Federal authorities the book said ''may prove to be a turning point in the entire history of the mob in America.'' The informant was Philip Leonetti, not Mr.


Pastimes;   Coins
LEAD: In the battle for control of the vast colonial wealth of the North American colonies, France and England were opponents.
The pawns were the tribes and leagues of Indians that held the control and wealth of a wide area.
Agents of each European power were quick to make any alliance with the Indians that could hurt the other.


Debate Deepens Over Artistic Costs Of Art Subsidies
LEAD: ON the eve of their annual descent on Congress to seek Federal support for the arts, the artists and institutions that make up America's loosely knit cultural lobby are fractious and divided as never before.
At issue is whether to accept restrictions like those passed last year on Federal financing for ''obscene'' art as a necessary evil or as a challenge to be vigorously confronted.


Question Of the Week;   Will the Rangers' Deals Lead To the Cup?
LEAD: If one can dream for a moment, Bernie Nicholls will pass the puck to Mike Gartner, who will shoot the puck between the legs of Mike Vernon in overtime of the seventh game of the Stanley Cup final.
In reality, Phil Esposito's many trades did not help the Rangers win the cup, so why should Neil Smith's trades be different?


William Rockefeller Is Dead at 71; An Ex-President of the A.S.P.C.A.
LEAD: William Rockefeller, a former president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and a former chairman of the Metropolitan Opera Association, died of lung cancer on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.

Fashion: On the Street;   Button-Down Set Is Loosening Up
LEAD: O.K., class, clear your desks; it's time for a quiz.
Today is March 18.
That means the season is: (A) winter, (B) spring, (C)summer or (D) all of the above.
The correct answer, as anyone who has been in New York City the last few days knows, is D. Those who are majoring in fashion appreciation also know that this is also called a transitional period, when the weather is a bit too warm for heavy winter wools but, most days at least, a little too brisk for lightweight clothes.


Time to Assess the Ravages of Winter
LEAD: DESPITE unusual spells of mild weather, part of it called the January thaw, this has been a rough winter for plants.
Gardeners who have been outside for their annual inspection may have been surprised to find that many of their plants, particularly the broadleaved evergreens, were burned.

Butterflies
LEAD: To the Editor: It was encouraging to read in ''A World of Butterflies in Florida'' (Travel, Jan. 28) that Coconut Creek visitors go home with information on the importance of native plants to native butterflies.
When preferred plants disappear, butterflies are at risk.
Adult butterflies sip nectar from many flowers - primarily yellow, orange, pink and purple ones - but the females require specific plants as host plants for their eggs and food for the caterpillars.


Digging In
LEAD: It could be that the de-Communization of Eastern Europe is naught but a Soviet ploy to lull the West into ill-defended complacency.
If so - and Elizabeth Clare Prophet believes it is - any Soviet invaders could be in for a surprise when they reach Paradise Valley, Mont.
There, Mrs.
Prophet, leader of the Church Universal and Triumphant, has assembled more than 2,000 of her followers and bade them prepare to sit out World War III in a huge complex of underground shelters on the church's 33,000-acre ranch.


NONFICTION
LEAD:
The quincentenary of Columbus's discovery of the New World is upon us, and Franco Cardini's EUROPE 1492: Portrait of a Continent Five Hundred Years Ago (Facts on File, $50) is disguised as a commemoration of that event.
More accurately, the book is a general treatment of European life at the end of the 15th century.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: When Anne Meara was growing up on Long Island, she was convinced her family was like no other.
She had no intimate knowledge of other families, but she just knew that they and their beautifully modulated voices lived in perfect harmony in an atmosphere of sweet reason.
When she was a little older, she knew that romance wasn't romance unless there was background music and, in the distance, a sunset or some other bit of glorious nature.

McIlvaine Feels Sorry for Young Players
LEAD: Joe McIlvaine, the good shepherd who tends the flock of Mets yearlings, calls them baseball's ''prisoners of war,'' but they are not penned in any camp.
The problem, as McIlvaine and many other personnel people view it, is that they should be in camp.

The prospective bridegroom is the son of Mrs.

Review/Dance;   More Humphrey Revivals
LEAD: There is no question about the devotion to the dance of Doris Humphrey that drives the American Dance Repertory Theater, which performed on Thursday at the Pace Downtown Theater.
Nor is there any question that Humphrey's work is a relatively neglected part of American dance history.
It is certainly true that dances look different in different times, as was suggested in a comment in the program notes, in which

Butterflies
LEAD: To the Editor: ''A World of Butterflies in Florida'' stirred happy memories of seeing butterflies last winter at Callaway Gardens in Georgia.

Review/Music;   Delafose's Traditional Zydeco Style
LEAD: John Delafose and the Eunice (La.) Playboys don't bother with any of zydeco's latest borrowings: no funk, no rock, no country-and-western, just the homegrown heritage of Cajun two-steps and waltzes tinctured with blues and rhythm-and-blues.
Wednesday night at Tramps, in the band's New York City debut, the closest thing he sang to a pop song was the Johnny Horton hit ''The Battle of New Orleans,'' from 1959.


China
LEAD: To the Editor: I read Carol Kramer's article ''China After Tiananmen Square'' (Travel, Feb. 18) with a mixture of fond memories and sadness.
Having completed a tour a few weeks before the Tiananmen incident, I relived our stay (and the guilt we felt when we first arrived) at the incredible Shanghai Hilton, our lovely hotel in Xian and the adventure of traveling on old Russian planes between cities.

The Gospel According to Alec McCowen
LEAD: It was Alec McCowen's 64th birthday.

Forget Lions and Lambs, Try To Get Birds to Feed Together
LEAD: WHEN peace comes it will be ushered in on my bird feeder.
Certain political pundits, pondering peace, suggest that recent events in Eastern Europe presage an era of peace; soon the Messiah will ride through the Brandenburg Gate on a white donkey.
I know differently.
The age of peace will not arrive until the occupants of my bird feeder get their act together.


Anne Adler and John Tarbell Jr. Wed

They are good with almost any food that likes the flavor of tomato.


JULIA ROBERTS FACES A TEST OF CHARACTER
LEAD: In Garry Marshall's new romantic fantasy, a pretty woman is seen walking down the street, and she is indeed - as Roy Orbison sings - the kind you ''like to meet.'' But in this post-modern Cinderella story, with Shavian overtones and Los Angeles locales, the heroine happens to be a hooker.
And the man who would be her Prince is a mendacious corporate raider whose only regal trait is a passion for opera, specifically Verdi.


LINDA FAIRSTEIN VS. RAPE
LEAD: As the 1972-73 coordinator of the Rape Prevention Committee for NOW-NYC, I was pleased to read ''Linda Fairstein vs.
Rape'' (Feb. 25).
At the time of our campaign to have a rape unit established, the District Attorney's office operated on a rotation system.
Any woman brave enough to press charges against a rapist would be assigned to whatever lawyer was next in the rotation line.


No-Strings Help for the Soviet Union: Yes or No?
LEAD: FOR those who listen closely, a new debate on American policy toward the Soviet Union can be heard stirring in Washington.

LEAD: Can a basketball team be in serious trouble when the score is 5-2?


Food;   WHAT COMES NATURALLY
LEAD: IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY AFTERNOON in the dead of winter.
I had just picked my way around a sad slab of salmon with limp but woody asparagus and tomatoes the color and texture of wet ash.
Partly to prolong leaving a warm neighborhood restaurant, but mostly to cheer myself up, I succumbed to the waiter's hard sell on the special dessert, a ''harvest'' tart.


Bill Farley Learns More of The Downside
LEAD: Going down. And down.


CRIME
LEAD: In the 18 years she has spent as a crime reporter for The Miami Herald, Edna Buchanan has picked up a lot of stuff besides her 1986 Pulitzer Prize.

Minister Quits, Shaking Indian Government
LEAD: Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, one of India's most prominent politicians, resigned from Prime Minister V. P. Singh's administration on Friday, threatening to split the governing coalition.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE;


Fashion;   The Urban (and Urbane) Spring Sandal
LEAD: This spring, women's sandals have been re-invented so that they can be worn to the office, and the platform shoe, an icon of the 40's, has returned.

This season, many of the freshest styles are also affordable, selling for less than $100.

1,000 in Southern Alabama Flee as Levee Breaks
LEAD: At least 1,000 people were evacuated from the town of Elba in rain-soaked southern Alabama yesterday after a nearby levee broke, flooding downtown streets and inundating houses.


GETTING DOWN TO EARTH
LEAD: The descriptions often sound like they're from the back of a cereal box - words like ''back to nature'' or ''unprocessed.'' Indeed, designers and manufacturers are becoming downright earthy, shunning the synthetics in favor of the naturals.


Players Hurt in Crash
LEAD: SEVEN members of the Central Connecticut State tennis team were injured, three of them seriously, Friday night when a van carrying them from the Orlando, Fla., airport was struck by a car that crossed the median of an expressway.


San Juan's Cultural Heart
LEAD: IT is well known that San Juan's major hotels have gambling casinos and nightclubs in which one can hear slick popularizations of Latin culture, but what is less familiar is the city's many venues for music, dance and film.
Even if you don't gamble and don't like nightclubs, you can usually find something interesting to do in the temperate evenings.


Star Wars
LEAD: Joan Quigley is no crass self-promoter, of course, but it must have been difficult to stand silent while other people hogged the credit for changing the course of history.
Ms.
Quigley, who was Nancy Reagan's astrologer, asserted in a memoir published last week that Mrs.
Reagan's 1989 memoir greatly understated the astrologer's influence on the Reagan Presidency.

Here Boy!
LEAD: It seems that dogs have a new best friend up in Alaska.
Susan Butcher last week won her fourth victory in the grueling 1,158-mile Iditarod Trail Dog Sled Race.
Along the way she set a new record time of 11 days, 1 hour, 53 minutes and 28 seconds for the Anchorage-to-Nome run, earning $50,000 in prize money plus a $25,000 bonus from her sponsor, a dog food manufacturer.

Whether you have any reasonable expectation of beating him or not, it is correct to carry the battle to him as early as possible.


ELEKTRA CLASSICS IS ABOUT TO MAKE ITS FIRST BIG SPLASH
LEAD: Apparently record companies - no matter how big - more and more feel that pop and rock aren't enough to make them perceived as ''full-line'' record companies; one must be in the classical business, too.
Thus it was that Warner Communications (now Time Warner) took the plunge in 1988, buying the Hamburg-based Teldec organization and obtaining a 20 percent interest in the French Erato label, which had been affiliated with RCA.


Correction
LEAD: Last Sunday, this column misidentified President Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury.
He was Salmon P. Chase.

LOVE AS A BURDEN, A CALLING AND, SOMETIMES, A CATHARSIS
LEAD: Centuries ago, an Irish poet, a woman whose name has been lost, wrote:
My love is no short year's sentence.
It is a grief lodged under the skin
Strength pushed beyond its bounds;
The four quarters of the world,
The highest point of heaven.
It is
A heart breaking or
Battle with a ghost,
Striving under water,
Outrunning the sky or
Courting an echo.


A DRIVING PASSION
LEAD: A DESERT SCENE IN WHICH MILlions of dollars change hands under a tent seems better suited to an oil-rich sheikdom than an Arizona polo field called Horseworld.
Compounding the strangeness is that the commodity being bought and sold here is not the four-legged means of transportation of years gone by, but the machines that made them nearly obsolete - automobiles.


More Power to the Regulators
LEAD: Since the crash of 1987, America's financial markets have taken a number of actions that attempt to corral the more abusive aspects of program trading.
But events clearly show that even stronger measures are required not only to restore the integrity of the markets, but to help stem what is rapidly becoming an international crisis.


Ronald Sitts, Builder, Weds Kitsi Watterson, Writer

POSTINGS: Tax Abatement;   Beating City Hall
LEAD: ''Go fight City Hall'' usually means, ''Don't bother, you can't win.'' But the owners of 184 cooperative apartments at 50 Lexington Avenue fought - and won - and now may get up to $10 million in tax abatements.
The dispute involves their claim to 10 years of abatements under New York City's 421a program.

ALL ABOUT EVERYTHING IN JUST ONE COLUMN
LEAD: It must be some peculiar twist in the DNA that drives human beings toward extremes of every sort.

WARSAW ALLIANCE SPLIT ON GERMANY
LEAD: The Foreign Ministers of the Warsaw Pact, meeting here under new, democratic conditions, failed to agree today on whether a united Germany should be neutral or aligned with the West.

About Long Island;   For Japanese Students, the Fast Track Means Saturday School Bells

Fashion;   FRESH FROM NATURE'S MOLD
LEAD: On his strolls along the Thames, Tom Binns used to scoop up pocketfuls of sea glass - old bottle tops really - sculpted by currents and washed up on the banks.

THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THIS DAME
LEAD: MAGGIE SMITH - OR DAME MAGGIE SMITH, TO USE HER NEWLY ACQUIRED TITLE - approaches the Hyatt Carlton Tower hotel in Knightsbridge, showily twirling her left arm in the air.
A grand theatrical gesture from a star whose career has shown no shortage of them?
Perhaps, but this time, there's an element of triumph in the motion: the notorious arm whose injury partly caused the Broadway postponement of ''Lettice and Lovage'' for a year, is on the mend, and Maggie Smith wants to illustrate its recovery with a flourish.


Currency;   Going in Two Directions
LEAD:
It was a week of inaction, with mixed results for the dollar.
The head of the Bank of Japan returned from a trip to Europe but did not act to raise the country's official discount rate, a move that most analysts have been expecting and feel is necessary to support a very weak yen.
So the yen fell a little further against the dollar.

American Politics Loses Way As Polls Supplant Leadership
LEAD: As America's democratic visions and values seem to triumph around the world, an unhappy consensus has emerged at home that domestic politics has become so shallow, mean and even meaningless that it is failing to produce the ideas and leadership needed to guide the United States in a rapidly changing world.

LEAD: THERE were smiles and embraces all around as the popularly elected leaders of Latin America came together last week to meet the two newest members of their club: Patricio Aylwin of Chile and Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil.

Lifestyle: Sunday Menu;   Simple Dish That's Ubiquitous in Coastal Mexico
LEAD: There are dozens of dishes all over Mexico, especially in the coastal areas, that are a variation on this theme: Fish with vegetables and chilies.

Lynne Katsafouros Friedman - T-Shirt Artist
LEAD: A dog is a dog is a dog and a cat is a cat is a cat - to non-dog and non-cat people.
But to the enormous fraternity of pet owners, their cats and dogs are as beloved as children.
It's therefore no surprise that when Lynne Katsafouros Friedman appeared in public last year in a T-shirt with a hand-painted poodle on it, strangers approached, and when they discovered she had painted it herself, asked if she would do one for them.


For an Off-Season Taste Treat, Roasted Tomatoes
LEAD: IF you yearn for the taste of tomatoes but are unimpressed by their quality at this time of year, try roasting them.

There Was Music In the Air
LEAD: To the Editor:


Couch Potatoes, Unbound
LEAD: With the arrival of cable television, VCR's and video rental stores, futurologists predicted that Saturday nights at the Bijou would go the way of community sings.
Why would people stand in long lines, pay $7 and suffer whisperers in a cramped movie house when they could be home in their jammies eating microwaved popcorn with an incredible choice of things to see?


Nature Evoked by Works in Fiber
LEAD: ''FIBER EXPRESSIONS'' is an exhibition with an amalgam of natural forms, traditional fabric techniques and high-tech materials.


WHEN BRITISH JUSTICE FAILED

Extra Innings
LEAD: WITH the major league baseball season threatened by a labor dispute, some college teams may be trying to fill the gap by extending their own seasons a bit.
That, at least, seemed to be the case in Seattle on Friday when four teams played four consecutive extra-inning games against each other.
As a result, what would have normally been 36 innings of baseball turned into a 49-inning, 17-hour marathon that lasted from 9 A.M.

I, and many others like me, know.

Why?
The answer, we know is simple but takes a lifetime to truly understand.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Review/Music;   Contemporary Anguish In Corigliano Symphony
LEAD: There are all kinds of reasons why the current Chicago Symphony subscription concerts at Orchestra Hall are significant.
But the most compelling is that they mark the arrival of a major new orchestral score, one that addresses a terrible crisis of our time and also manages to make impressive sense on abstract esthetic terms.

The Executive Computer;   Is It Word Processing, or Desktop Publishing?
LEAD: The most powerful word-processing programs have been borrowing features from desktop publishing programs for some time, allowing people who work with words to embellish their documents with graphics, illustrations, multiple columns and fancy typography.

Karajan vs. Karajan vs. Karajan vs. . . .
LEAD: The one title that appears most frequently in the late Herbert von Karajan's discography is Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony, which he recorded seven times over a period of nearly 50 years, with orchestras in Berlin, London and Vienna.
The symphonies with which he is most readily identified, though, are Beethoven's, and in that material his recording statistics are impressive.


Wax and Wigs and a Sense of Magic
LEAD: ASIDE from spending most of his weekly allowance and other spare change on makeup, invading his mother's kitchen cabinets for supplies and utensils to create monster get-ups, being told by classmates he was weird and getting picked up by the police on charges of disguising his identity (he was walking the streets dressed as Frankenstein's monster), Kevin C.

NEWSPAPER COLUMNISTS: LITERATURE BY THE INCH
LEAD: Pick up a newspaper anywhere in the United States and you will be addressed by insistent strangers known generically as columnists because each occupies, more or less, a column of newsprint.

LEAD: The Rangers will win the Stanley Cup (hopefully soon and hopefully often) when we have put together a strong organization from top to bottom which works hard and develops its player talent.

Pieces Missing From the Picture
LEAD: To the Editor:


Budapest's Grand Design
LEAD: IF each city has its niche in time, then the turn of the century is where Budapest naturally belongs.
It has the boulevards and the opera, the cafes and the trams, the public gardens and private villas.
And now, as another era and another century come to a close, it is showing signs of the same freneticism and languor, the same eagerness to do business and seek pleasure that characterized its golden age in 1900.

THE CASE FOR GRAD SCHOOL
LEAD: In response to ''About Men: A Case For Grad School,'' by Mark McGurl (Feb. 18), I pity the writer for his self-deprecating reaction to the relative successes of his former girlfriends.

THE CASE FOR GRAD SCHOOL
LEAD: Last year I got a B.A. in philosophy.
Now I am waiting tables, writing, and taking pictures; it's a beginning.
I'm not sure what will come of it, but I do know that I won't spend my years parading other people's causes, not that it's not useful, it's that I've made other choices.
Nor will I wear $200 paisley ties, the usefulness of which I would call into question.

A Collection of Sculpture Easy on the Eye, and on the Intellect
LEAD: A GOOD title being hard to find, the Gallery at Hastings-on-Hudson must be congratulated for '' 'Lite' Works,'' because the show of sculpture it identifies contains at most a couple of calories.
To put it another way, the art is as easy on the intellect as it is on the eye and mainly this is because the eight sculptors involved use materials that call for neither a vast studio space nor an arsenal of tools.

LEAD: Marci Lynn Spector, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Review/Film;   And Now on the Screen: Lambada!
LEAD: The lambada, once a Brazilian dance, was carpetbagged to Paris.
There, entrepreneurs turned a Bolivian pop song and a common-denominator Caribbean beat into a pan-European hit and dance craze, involving undulating, bikini-clad rumps and female-groin-to-male-thigh contact.
Some parties hope the lambada will catch on here, but if the onrush of hype hasn't already befuddled Americans about what, exactly, it is, ''Lambada'' and ''The Forbidden Dance,'' two films released


Farewell to a Latin Deadbeat
LEAD: To the Editor:


Heady Days in Prague
LEAD: ''PRAGUE THE GOLDEN'' was always beautiful, but for the last 21 years the mood was sullen, brooding, resentful.
Today Prague is radiant with the pride of a people who succeeded in wresting democracy from the grip of Communist dictatorship.
The really hard work may be yet to come, but for now they are basking innocently in their freedom like students on the first sunny day of spring under the medieval spires and Baroque domes of a city that is one of the glories of

Feud Lingers for Cuomo and 'Rapp'

The Nuts and Bolts Of East-Bloc Travel
LEAD: FROM the East Berlin side of the Brandenburg Gate to Wenceslas Square in Prague, Americans are discovering Eastern Europe in record numbers, particularly as the changes in governments there have led to the loosening of visa and customs procedures.

Cajun Cooking in a Homey Atmosphere

What's Doing In: Warsaw
LEAD: Warsaw wears its woes more prominently than its wonders.
It seems at times to have more coal grit to coat its soulless apartment blocks than sunlight to bathe its golden Old Town.

Par for the Course
LEAD: KILLEEN, TEX., IS HOME TO about 68,000 people and the Army base at Fort Hood.
It's a bit of a downtrodden place at the moment, in the wake of the budget-cutting proposal by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney that would substantially shrink the military presence there.
On the bright side, however, is miniature golf, whose image in Killeen is undergoing state-of-the-art refurbishing.

Kathleen Turner, Back in the Steamy South
LEAD: The way Kathleen Turner tells it, the first time she saw herself on the big screen she had much the same reaction as most viewers did.

If, like the Archduke, you are the son of the last Emperor of Austria-Hungary, and if, furthermore, you are able to enchant Hungarians by your fluency in their language, as the 77-year-old Archduke and member of the European Parliament does, you can presumably pick your own hotel even on short notice.

Why Steinbeck's Okies Speak to Us Today
LEAD: The image of the dust bowl migration is imbedded in American consciousness, permanently linked to our memory of the Great Depression.
It was an epic event.
More than a million people, most of them dispossessed farm families, left the declining agricultural regions of Texas, Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma during the 1930's and moved west to California.


Repairing Wallboard
LEAD: MINOR wallboard damage - dents or small holes - is relatively easy to repair by smoothing spackling compound over the blemish and repainting the area.

Review/Theater;   Rubber-Faced Lunacy According to Hoyle
LEAD: For the finale of his one-man clown show, ''Feast of Fools,'' Geoff Hoyle does something incomparable with his three legs.
All three are trousered and shod and they peep out from under a long greatcoat.
Mr.
Hoyle walks on stage at the Westside Arts Theater as if it were the most natural thing in the world to be a triped.


Wheeling Across Iowa
LEAD: PERHAPS it was my unexplained Easterner's fondness for the Midwest or had something to do with the approach of my 50th birthday, but as soon as I heard a friend's enthusiastic recounting of his marathon bicycle ride clear across Iowa I knew that this was something for me.
Never mind that I had never done even any semi-serious cycling or that my exercise consists mostly of a few weekly sets of tennis and a bit of winter basketball.


W. Virginia Teacher Unions Urge Strike's End
LEAD: A strike that has crippled public education in West Virginia for the last 10 days neared an end today when leaders of the state's two main teacher unions urged their members to return to work on Monday.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: East Regional;   Priority for St. John's: Beat Duke's Defense
LEAD: Greg (Boo) Harvey stood outside the interview area this afternoon and listened as coach after coach pointed out how important defense would be when St.
John's plays Duke and U.C.L.A. faces Kansas in second-round East Regional play Sunday.


'Settings' Enliven a Historic House
LEAD: CLOTHING folded up and ready to be packed in trunks, linens piled up for ironing and books scattered on the bed are familiar sights to families packing for trips.
But such sights are not so usual in historic houses, where each item is usually neatly in place.
To breathe some life into a historic house, however, the curator, Renee T.


Roy Marsden: More Than a Civilized Copper
LEAD: ''Death seems to provide the minds of the Anglo-Saxon race with a greater fund of innocent enjoyment than any other single subject.'' So wrote Dorothy L. Sayers in 1934, and what is noteworthy is how, in Britain, women have come to dominate detective fiction.
From Agatha Christie and Margery Allingham to today's P.


Fashion;   Visors Are Casting a Fancier Shadow
LEAD: Until recently, visors were seen mostly on the beach, tennis court or fairway.
And the ones for women generally came in pastel pink, blue or white.
But that was before the shun-the-sun movement.


New Clue Is Uncovered in Bank Explosion
LEAD: Investigators said today that they had pinpointed a leak in a propane gas line near a bank where an explosion killed three employees and injured 14 other people last week.


Yes: Drive Down the Deficit    No: Don't Punish the Poor
LEAD: George Bush wants to be the Education President.
Yet he won't spend much money on schools.
He wants to end drug abuse.
Yet he won't spend much for treatment.
He wants to help the poor.
But in his 1991 budget, discretionary programs for low-income families are only half what they were, adjusting for inflation, 10 years ago.


The Battle Over Regulation of the Futures Markets
LEAD: Washington's version of a hostile takeover is starting to take shape.
No money is on the table and no stock will change hands.
But the outcome could change the markets far more - and far longer - than even the biggest billion-dollar deal.

LEAD: St.
Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Manhasset, L.I., was the setting yesterday for the marriage of Kathleen Anne Rice, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Township Ties Economic Hopes to New Prison
LEAD: WHEN New Jersey's first Federal prison opens its gates next month, officials say, it will be an example of enlightened penal philosophy - a structure without surrounding walls or guard towers.
It will also be a prison that its neighbors have invited into their economically depressed rural community in the hope that it will bring development and jobs, local officials say.


China
LEAD: To the Editor: It seems ironic that China would attempt to exploit the art of the Buddhist religion (''Serene Haven of Buddhist Art,'' Travel, Jan. 14) after having so devastatingly destroyed much of the art of Tibet.
Unfortunately, suppression of the Tibetan people continues and we see no evidence that persecution has in any way lessened over the years.

THE INNER SANCTUMS OF THE NEWARK MUSEUM
LEAD: If there is any reward in architecture to staying the course, it is to be seen right here on Washington Street, where the Newark Museum has recently completed a $21 million reconstruction and expansion.
The architect the museum hired was Michael Graves - not the internationally famous Michael Graves of today, architect of Whitney Museum additions and Walt Disney World hotels, but the young and struggling Michael Graves of 1967, a faculty member at the Princeton University School of Architecture.


Islanders Are Led By LaFontaine

LEAD: Julio Cesar Chavez knocked out Meldrick Taylor in the final seconds of a spirited 12-round bout between junior welterweight champions here at the Hilton Hotel tonight, but it was a controversial ending.

At Ballet Theater, a Return to Beginnings
LEAD: The appointment last week of Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith as co-directors of American Ballet Theater obviously heralds a new phase in the troupe's history.
But through its importance, this decision by the board of an internationally ranked company also symbolizes the implicit closing of a strange era.


NONFICTION
LEAD:
NIGHT AND FOG.
By Arne Brun Lie with Robby Robinson. (Norton, $18.95.) Half of ''Night and Fog'' is the story of the Norwegian Arne Brun Lie's year as a political prisoner of the occupying Nazi Government.
The other half is the story of how Mr.
Lie got up the nerve to talk about that year.
The two halves run alongside each other the length of the book and somehow never quite cohere.

Tokyo Tries to Find Out if 'Salarymen' Are Working Themselves to Death
LEAD: Since well before Japan's emergence as an economic superpower, its hordes of white-collar workers have been the stuff of cartoon caricatures: blue-suited men who spill out of jammed trains every morning, push paper in overcrowded offices all day, drink in the Ginza district all night and die early from the stress of their unrelenting work.

Repair New York's Dented Shield Law
LEAD: News organizations will have a hard time informing the public if they are routinely hauled into court to produce notes or unused television footage about a crime or accident that becomes the subject of court action.

The Brouhaha Continues
LEAD: To the Editor:


When It Counts, Kohl Shows, He Cannot Be Counted Out
LEAD: CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL customarily reaches his maximum heft at this time of year, just before his annual Eastertime course of weight reduction.
A year ago, with public opinion polls tracking a precipitous plunge, the bulk seemed to be political dead weight.
This year it looks like pure gold: Mr.
Kohl stands at the peak of his career, and if things keep going his way, by this time next year he could be the first chancellor of a reunited Germany.

Review/Theater;   Trying to Adapt to Inhospitable Terrain
LEAD: ''And the Soul Shall Dance,'' Wakako Yamauchi's Depression-era drama, remembers the time when California law forbade Japanese immigrants to own their own land.

When Developers Fail To Complete Projects
LEAD: THE early buyers in new suburban housing developments usually look forward to the day when construction stops and the bulldozers are silent.
But for more and more new homeowners these days, the silence may signal the developer's default on the project, leaving them to worry about paving the roads, paying for the sewers and installing the tennis courts.

Expansion Reminder
LEAD: If the owners and the players have a new labor contract, can a timetable for major league expansion be far behind?


WHAT PRICE GLORY?: TOO HIGH
LEAD: THEY SAY GOOD BURGUNDY IS hard to find these days.
Maybe so.
But a Burgundy-lover wandering around the wine shops in New York City recently would have had no trouble finding some really superb wines.
How about a 1985 Grands-Echezeaux or a 1985 Beaune Greves or a 1986 Richebourg or a 1985 Clos de la Roche or a 1986 Le Montrachet or perhaps even a 1987 Corton

Review/Dance;   'Gloria,' A New Work Set to a Vivaldi Cantata
LEAD: The music was liturgical, but the choreography looked pastoral.
Nevertheless, the sacred and the secular harmonized today when the Garden State Ballet offered Peter Anastos's new ''Gloria'' at the Montclair State College Memorial Auditorium.


The Complete Return on Investment
LEAD: Behind every tract of rain forest that is cleared, every factory that is shuttered and locked and every oil-clogged beach lies an investment decision.
These decisions may have paid big dividends to shareholders and other investors - they may have made certain individuals wealthier - but they also have harmed the economy, society and environment.

LEAD: The dollar is still going in two directions these days, continuing to strengthen against the yen while weakening against the German mark.
The victory of a coalition of conservative parties in the East German elections last Sunday added pressure to the drive to unify the Germanys, and that in turn helped push the mark up against the dollar.

Boston
LEAD: To the Editor: I was most surprised to read that visitors to Boston are advised to call the Boston Garden for information on tickets for Celtics games (''What's Doing in Boston,'' Travel, Jan. 7).
One has as much chance of obtaining Celtics tickets from the Garden box office as winning the lottery.

AN ISLAND In LIMBO
LEAD: Alan Weisman's article (''An Island in Limbo,'' Feb. 18) helps to bring more understanding to the problem facing Puerto Rico for so long.
I cannot agree more with Cancel Miranda's statement, ''Any foreigner has more rights than Puerto Ricans in their own land.'' I visited Puerto Rico and came back pained.


The Accuracy Rate In Machine Translation
LEAD: Peter Wheeler's recent letter to the New Jersey editor in response to my interview on machine translation seems to miss certain points.
First, I was not talking about how to run a translation service business.
I was talking about fully automatic high-quality machine translation systems.


Honecker and Wife Hounded From New House by a Mob

LEAD: Three huge blobs and a giant baby took over the stage on March 17at the Triplex Theater I of the Borough of Manhattan Community College.

Review/Theater;   Cherry Blossoms and Revenge in Japanese Fable
LEAD: ''Lost in a Flurry of Cherries,'' the Japanese experimental drama that ends its residence at La Mama E.T.C.today, is only about 70 minutes long.
But by its end, the cold, mysterious play with spectacular stage effects leaves one feeling wind-blown and a little breathless from its energy.


Question of the Week;   Should College Athletes Be Paid?
LEAD: I realize that colleges are making a lot of money from these athletes but the opportunity for an education, when used wisely, is far more beneficial.
The scholarship for an education should be the real prize.
Money and the chance to play in the big leagues has become the creed of too many young athletes.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. We inherited some walnut furniture that has a considerable amount of carving.
We would like to strip off the old finish down to the original wood.
We called for professional estimates, but found the cost quite high, and so we would like to do the stripping ourselves.
Can you offer some pointers?


Villages and Beaches Along the Costa Verde
LEAD: FOR most visitors to Brazil, the only glimpse of the land mass between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo comes as a green blur from the window of an airplane, en route from one city to the other.
The area is known as the Costa Verde, or Green Coast, and even from an altitude of 23,000 feet there is no mistaking why.


Reflections On a Cold Place
LEAD: YOU'RE GOING TO SEE some changes on the ice,'' a construction engineer told me as we changed into polar garb for the flight from New Zealand to Antarctica. ''Whatever you do, don't get caught throwing away a cigarette butt or beer can.''


Question of the Week;   Should College Athletes Be Paid?
LEAD: Idealistically, no.

- Nancy Ziegenmeyer

speaking of rape.


WATER GONE, BUT SHOCK LINGERS
LEAD: There are still people in Elba, Ala., who remember March 14, 1929, when flood waters from the Pea River inundated the small southeastern Alabama community, almost wiping it off the map.

A Writing Project Spans the Age Gap

The war, which ended in 1989, began in 1966, not 1986.


PICTURING PAPA
LEAD: The life of Ernest Hemingway has been chronicled, celebrated and analyzed so exhaustively that its scenes now constitute the elements of a myth, the periodic retracing of which has become a kind of pilgrimage (or gravy train) taken by writers and readers alike.
A.
E.

A Concern With Painting the Unpaintable
LEAD: All of Gerhard Richter's work can be seen as a struggle with ideology.
He has moved back and forth between abstract and figurative styles, and between small hazy photorealist still lifes and landscapes and large gestural abstractions so physical that they seem to take over their room.
He has consistently tried to make art that is provocative and pleasing without advancing any one program or theory.

The house was built of brick and California redwood.


About Cars
LEAD: A truck from Oldsmobile?


The Modernist Who Dared to Be a Romantic
LEAD: One could argue that modernism, for all its art-for-art's-sake veneer, is at heart Romantic.
Painters like Piet Mondrian, sculptors like Constantin Brancusi and photographers like Alfred Stieglitz all wanted to get to a spiritual dimension with their pared-down forms, and they relied on inner sensibility as their means of discovery.

Mutual Funds;   A Good Day for Bottom Fishing
LEAD: Skittish investors should stay out of today's ''junk bond'' market.
But conditions are ideal for ''bottom fishers,'' the hardy souls with a strong tolerance for risk who scout for bargains in the ruins.
And, according to Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment adviser, closed-end funds are the best bargains in today's junk market.


JUNGLE IS WINNING THE COCAINE WAR
LEAD: The battle in the jungle is doomed from the outset as again the Bush Administration -- like its predessors -- ignores a basic tenet of economics: if there is no demand, there will be no need for supply (''In the Cocaine War, the Jungle Is Winning,'' by Michael Massing, March 4).
The produce of the jungles in South America is feeding what the article refers to as ''the nation's immense, insatiable habit.


COLLEGE BASKETBALL: Midwest Regional;   Arkansas Pulls Free Of Texas at the Line
LEAD: For all the high-flying rebounds and wondrous shots that Arkansas and Texas tossed at each other here this afternoon, the finish came down to one of basketball's most elementary phases: free throws.
Hit or miss.
Arkansas missed plenty in the waning minutes, but the Razorbacks' Ron Huery made two crucial ones with 16 seconds left to lift Arkansas to an 88-85 victory and the Midwest Regional championship before 16,143 in Reunion Arena.

SURVIVING HISTORY
LEAD: I DISCOVERED NATALIA Ginzburg in 1971.
I was in Florence; my friend and I, having just graduated from college, were doing the contemporary version of the grand tour: a trip around Europe carrying backpacks, hitchhiking, staying in cheap pensiones.
I decided that I should buy an Italian book; I went into a bookstore and my eye fell on Natalia Ginzburg's Le piccole virtu.

Lenin Is Alive and Well and Reporting From Lithuania
LEAD: AMID the feast of information and candor set forth by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, it is worth pointing out that the spectral figure of agitprop - the weary old Bolshevik specialist in manipulating information - still holds a high place at the table of glasnost.
In the war of nerves between the Kremlin and the breakaway republic of Lithuania, Soviet Government dominance of most information channels has been on display with a pervasiveness that Lenin first dreamed of.

Correction
LEAD: An article last week about people involved in savings and loan failures included erroneous statements about Thomas M. Gaubert, the former head of the Independent American Savings and Loan Association of Dallas.

As Highways Crumble, Bush Stumbles
LEAD: The Bush Administration has once again spoken out of both sides of its mouth: first, amid much fanfare, it declares that fixing the country's transportation system is in the national interest; then it turns around and sticks the states and localities with the bill.


On Language;   Tickety-Boo and NASA, Too
LEAD: ENCLOSED IS AN article from The Houston Post of Feb. 12,'' writes Andrew Hero, the kind of specific citator that lexicographers like, ''which uses the expression tickety-boo.''

Matching the Handicapped With Jobs
LEAD: MATTHEW MURPHY, a 24-year-old a page at the Scarsdale Library, recently bought a bicycle with his own money. ''He is so proud of it,'' said his mother, Helen F. Murphy. ''His wheels have made him even more independent.
And knowing that he earned the money himself gives him such satisfaction.''

SANDINISTA SWIMS AGAINST THE TIDE
LEAD: If Sandinista militants doubted the political orthodoxy of a comrade named Herty Lewites Rodriguez, they got their proof on election day.
While other Sandinista candidates were crushed in the national balloting on Feb. 25, Mr.
Lewites turned this tidy village into a something of an electoral miracle, leading his hometown Sandinista ticket to victory by a margin of 24 percentage points.


Review/Music;   An Assortment for Oboe
LEAD: Thomas Gallant, a young oboist, has had a worthy career championing new music and other frontiers of his instrument's repertory, and he put together a piquant assortment of mostly marginalia for his program on Tuesday night at Merkin Concert Hall.

ABOUT NEW JERSEY
LEAD: IT is just after 9 A.M. on a Friday in the middle of the month.

Film to Videotape: A Ticklish Transfer
LEAD: ''One of the major missions of a cinematographer today,'' says Allen Daviau, the cinematographer Steven Spielberg entrusted with the filming of the fabulous ''E.
T.'' ''is guiding the marriage of video and film technology.'' Mr.
Daviau's statement reflects the fact that nowadays movies are seen far more frequently on the home television screen than in the theater.


Bonnie Raitt Captures the Heart of Her Generation
LEAD: One of the biggest attractions of the pop music world is following the spins of its wheel of fortune and watching where the golden arrow comes to rest.
Each month brings a surprise or two, but when a deserving artist like Bonnie Raitt is suddenly, unexpectedly rewarded, one's fascination in the whole hit-making process becomes rekindled.


Retelling a Psychopathic Killer's Tale Is No Joke
LEAD: It was well past midnight as police cruisers and ambulances converged, screeched to a halt and disgorged dozens of paramedics and police SWAT teams in front of the Allegheny County Soldiers and Sailors War Memorial Hall on Fifth Avenue.
High drama turned into low comedy when a paramedic knocked over a stretcher, a cop had an unmanly struggle getting out of a cruiser and another cop's gun belt fell off.

FRESH AIR AND SUNSHINE


Question of the Week;   Should College Athletes Be Paid?
LEAD: A successful sports program can be a university's foremost attraction when it comes to recruiting students, not just athletes but eggheads such as myself.
While at the University of North Carolina, I carried out my plan to have a double major: English and basketball attendance.
Student athletes are a useful commodity, they bring exposure and revenue to colleges.


Enforcement of Guam Abortion Law Is Barred
LEAD: A Federal district judge here has temporarily blocked enforcement of a new Guam law that is the most restrictive abortion statute in any American jurisdiction.


Pastimes;   Chess
LEAD: Gary Kasparov did not have an easy time in the Linares International Tournament in Spain, which ended Feb. 24.
For the moment he has given up the Gruenfeld Defense, which he used with reasonable success against Anatoly Karpov in their last two title matches.
A good guess is that he does not want everyone he meets to be educated in its niceties as a result of seeing his Karpov games.

Review/Dance;   Observations on Life's Abrasiveness
LEAD: No one could accuse Donald Byrd of timidity.
From the start of his choreographic career in the mid-1970's, Mr.
Byrd has taken on complex issues including prejudice, the effects of negative reviews on artists, the AIDS crisis and life seen as an evening in a disco.
His choreographic voice - and electric presence - are both velvety and intensely abrasive.


Easter in Naples: Mangia Bene!
LEAD: THE FOOD OF NAPLES, LIKE THEJU city itself, is at its most exuberant at Easter when this ancient town shakes off the torpor induced by Lent and the gray damp of a Mediterranean winter.
Neapolitan cooks are brimming with vitality, turning out feasts with gusto.
But the food at Easter feasts throughout the city is far from the pizza and spaghetti with red sauce that most Americans associate with Naples.

Negligent But No Worse
LEAD: Joseph J. Hazelwood was by himself before the jurors, and perhaps that helped him.
In the end, they did not hold him responsible for the Exxon Valdez spill last year, though he was convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to pay $50,000 and spend 1,000 hours cleaning oil-stained beaches.

Small World
LEAD: Sometimes science is served best by unscientific methods.
For years researchers wondered if the hairy-eared dwarf lemur still existed; they had never seen one alive.

How 'Strykeforce' Beat the Clock
LEAD: It began with a half-dozen ''toolies'' fastened on a dream.
There was the understanding they would be set free of the ''mucky-mucks.'' And the inspirational spirit was a plucky man named James D. Stryker, whom colleagues call the Strykeforce, as if he were a comic-strip superhero of business.

Schools' Responsibility For Low Self-Esteem

UPDATED, A SINGULAR SPEAKER RETAINS ITS APPEAL
LEAD: For good reasons as well as bad, audio lives by unceasing innovation.

The Executive Computer;   Listen Closely: Your Files May Be Talking to You
LEAD: A document can convey intelligence, but until recently it lacked intelligence of its own.
This newspaper, for example, cannot write itself, deliver itself to subscribers, or tailor its contents automatically to the interests and reading level of a particular subscriber.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Hotels in SoHo;   Lodgings for Tourists and the Innovative Art World
LEAD: AS unlikely as they may sound in the loft district that was once called Hell's Hundred Acres, and as unwelcome as they may be in the eyes of some neighbors, a couple of hotels may soon be under way in the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District, with several more to follow.


New Chef Arrives at Beijing in Stamford
LEAD: THE names may change in the restaurant business, but often the premises, the ownership and sometimes even the type of cuisine remain the same.
That is largely the case with the new Beijing restaurant in downtown Stamford, whose previous name was Ching Ching.
The cream-colored walls, dark wainscoting and seating arrangements are familiar and seemingly changeless.


Steinbrenner-Spira: Tale of the Tape
LEAD: When George Steinbrenner initially encountered Howard Spira, the Yankees' owner seemed only too eager to hear what the man on the other end of the telephone had to say about Dave Winfield.


In Oregon, Literary Lodgings
LEAD: IMAGINE a hotel room decorated in shades of black and blood.
Dangling above the bed is a sinister-looking ax blade; at the foot of the bed, a freshly bricked-over passageway, behind which some poor soul, the tip of whose cap is still visible, has met an untimely end reminiscent of ''A Cask of Amontillado.


AIDS Deaths Near Another Awful Record

Sports of The Times;   Ryan Would Strike Out Asterisks

Poison Gas Laws: Still Leaking
LEAD: When Libya's poison-gas plant burned down last week, many people were relieved.
Instead, they should have been horrified - just as they were by the recent revelations that Czechoslovakia's ousted Communist Government had shipped 1,000 tons of lethal Semtex explosives to Libya.

Romance and a Happy Ending, Together at Last
LEAD: In the 1930's and 40's, Fred and Ginger and all those other starry-eyed cloudland couples met to the music - sometimes real, sometimes metaphorical - of romantic love.
Now there are Peter and Rita, the hero and heroine of ''Prelude to a Kiss,'' Craig Lucas's charming new play at the Circle Repertory Company.


Argentina to Extradite Ex-SS Man

TALKING: Conversions;   Gaining Control of The Board
LEAD: ANYONE who bought a cooperative apartment in a New York City conversion in the last few years probably assumed that the shareholders would quickly take over control of the board of directors and the building from the sponsor.


Question of the Week;   Should College Athletes Be Paid?
LEAD: The question is not whether the college athlete should be paid; he (or she) is paid now, in an approved, legitimate, and generous way.
At Notre Dame for example, each of the 19 incoming football scholarship freshmen receive a yearly benefit (tuition, room, board) having an approximate value of $15,000.


Question of the Week;   Should College Athletes Be Paid?
LEAD: Yes, pay college basketball players!
Rename Division I the N.C.A.B.A. (with B for basketball) and continue the championship format as it exists now, recognizing it for what it truly is: a revenue-producing business with paid athletes whose primary interest is athletics, who are representing the college during their contracted four-year tenure.

U.S. Taking Watchful Attitude
LEAD: The United States has made it clear to the Soviet Union that using force in Lithuania would harm Soviet-American relations but is still accepting Moscow's assurances that no such action will be taken, Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, said today in an interview.
Other Administration officials said there were signs of heightened Soviet military activity in the Baltic republics but no indication of an impending crackdown.


Review/Music;   Brahms by Trio and Guests
LEAD: Concerts devoted to the works of a single composer may lack the variety we expect of an evening in the concert hall.
But one virtue they offer is unity.

Lifestyle: Outing;   Tokens, Please, For a Ride
LEAD: Since ancient times, cities have arisen out of transportation routes.
New York City was no different: today's metropolis emerged from a prosperous port, but it emanated also from the metropolis below.
Its streets cling to the massive transportation network beneath them.
A visit to the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn offers a chance to explore the workings of that network at leisure.

The Fine Art Of Disappearing Into a Role
LEAD: Sit in a room long enough with Margaret Tyzack and sooner or later, as at that fabled Parisian cafe, everyone you know will pass by.
Miss Tyzack, who opens with Maggie Smith in Peter Shaffer's ''Lettice and Lovage'' this evening on Broadway at the Barrymore, is a natural chameleon, with a temperament so mercurial that she seems, as she talks, to take on a new persona with each thought.

LEAD:
INTERNATIONAL
The Tokyo stock market has caught New York on the way down.
An investor who bought Japanese stocks on Sept. 4, 1987 would now be no better off than one who bought American stocks the same day.
A 6.9 percent drop in the Nikkei average last week, to 30,372.16, left the total value of Tokyo's stocks slightly lower than New York's.

All About/Composite Materials;   Light and Tough, New Materials Head for the Mass Marketing Stage
LEAD: From the outside, today's automobiles still appear to be nearly all steel.
But about 8 percent of their weight consists of composites -strong, light combinations of complementary substances.
Bumpers, doors, body panels and station wagon tailgates are all commonly made from these materials.
Ten years ago, the composite content was less than 2 percent; by the year 2000, some producers of composites contend, their materials will predominate.


COLLEGE BASKETBALL: West Regional;   Loyola-U.N.L.V. Game A Clash of Images, Too
LEAD: Some see the West Regional final matchup between Loyola Marymount University and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas here Sunday as classic: the good guys (L.M.U., if you've been following the sports news the last couple weeks) against the bad guys (U.N.L.V., if you've been following the sports news the last few decades).

Two Chinas
LEAD: Taiwan is not the ''Free China'' it claims to be.
But at least it now shows willingness to move in that direction, in contrast to a deepening chill in mainland China.
Taiwan's reforms are worth encouraging, both for themselves and for the healthy example they might set for future leaders in Beijing.

DANCE VIEW
LEAD: It's not necessarily survival of the fittest in the dance world; it may only be survival of the luckiest.
When a production vanishes from a repertory, no one can predict if it will be gone for a season or for all eternity.
Shockingly few creations of the past were notated when they were new.
Even in our own age of film, videotape and crusading notation societies, numerous dances still go unrecorded.

Bavaria's Rococo Splendor
LEAD: BAVARIA, in the 18th century, was one of the largest states in Germany, a prosperous electorate whose rulers and people shared a taste for cheerful splendor, and in the rococo, then the prevailing international style, they found just the right way to express themselves.

Our experience was quite different from your reporter's.

Question of the Week;   Should College Athletes Be Paid?

A Trip Down Memory Lane in Baldwin

LEAD: Some 400 Vanderbilt University undergraduates are on a three-week regimen of low-fat, low-sodium and high-fiber foods intended to make them healthier and wiser - and perhaps a trifle wealthier, too.


The Menu Puts On Its Spring Garb
LEAD: THE weather has felt like spring on and off for weeks but now it's official.
And like the wardrobe and the garden, it's time for the menu to change Springtime calls for asparagus, artichokes, shad, soft-shell crabs, your own newly created salads, new potatoes, fresh herbs, scallions and light soups, stews and pasta dishes.


Ah, Symplocarpus Foetidus
LEAD: In a season of premature cherry blossoms and untimely tulips, one all-American plant is giving no ground to this headlong spring - symplocarpus foetidus, less elegantly known as skunk cabbage.
After poking its tip out of half-frozen soil, it waited to open its burnished green and purple sheaths and now, right on schedule, is sprouting the big leaves, which, when stepped on, smell terrible.


More on Mexico's Debt
LEAD: The complex nature of the debt agreement negotiated between Mexico and its creditor banks last month has led to some confusion regarding its implications for Mexico's economy.


Tennis in Italy
LEAD: To the Editor: What you told F. W. B. of Boseman, Mont., about finding tennis courts in Italy (Q &amp; A, March 11) was all well and good; tennis clubs are listed in the telephone directory.
But there is another, quite simple way to find out if a hotel or resort has a tennis court: look for the symbol (crossed tennis racquets) in the Michelin red guide to Italy.


Corrections
LEAD: The article ''Adding Up the Costs of Changes at the Top'' in the same issue misidentified the creator of the film ''Railroad Turnbridge.'' It is the work of Richard Serra.


Focus Turns To Those Behind The Camera
LEAD: Except in obscure publications, cinematographers never get credit for the look of a movie.
It's not that directors deliberately usurp the praise.
But parceling out credit is so complicated that the director becomes the winner by default.


Governor Urges Great Leap and Volunteers to Go First
LEAD: THE Governor of New Jersey has come came up with an alternative to tiptoeing around tax increases: jump in with both feet, to the tune of $2 billion; and while you're at it, overhaul the tax system, wipe out a $580 million deficit and redistribute wealth all at the same time.

Lifestyle: Sunday Menu;   Lentils That Don't Linger in the Pot
LEAD: Dried beans, peas and lentils are the trend-setting foods of the 90's, appearing on menus where nutrition and taste meet.
One big drawback is that they take so long to cook.
An alternative is canned beans, and as canned foods go they are among the best.
And while lentils do not come in cans, they do come in more than one color.

Events after the deaths of Marver and Sheva Bernstein, two of the four Americans who were among the 17 people who died in the Heliopolis Sheraton fire in Cairo March 1, offer a case study of how the State Department responds to such incidents overseas and provide insights that people hope they will never need.

Review/Theater;   'The Nature of Things'
LEAD: ''I'm a wild animal; no one can tame me,'' says David Cale, expressing his outsider's vision of the world.
There is something undomesticated, almost anti-theatrical about this performance artist.
Those unfamiliar with his work might wonder if he had just wandered on stage from the audience.
Because the sky is blue, he asks if he is breathing blue air - and he contemplates what birds are thinking about as they fly, leaving the suggestion that thinking might be antithetical to flying.

LEAD:
SATYAJIT RAY: The Inner Eye.
By Andrew Robinson. (University of California, $29.95.) Film buffs will be fascinated by ''Satyajit Ray,'' a study of India's most widely acclaimed director.
Born into a gifted Calcutta family in 1921, Mr.

SCHUYLERVILLE STANDS STILL;
LEAD: A FEW YEARS AGO I BOUGHT AN OLD house in a village named Schuylerville, 30 miles north of Albany, on the Hudson River.

Question of the Week;   Should College Athletes Be Paid?
LEAD: All college athletes in revenue-producing sports should be paid.
To ease the burden on smaller, less affluent programs, the N.C.A.A. should set aside money from all tournament revenue and provide participants their shares.
All athletes would be paid equally, using minimum wage as a guideline, just as if their extracurricular activity were a part-time campus job.

LEAD: Before reading ''The Drink of Millions'' I would have assumed that Joseph Conway, head of the Bureau of Water Supply, had at least an inkling that it is important to conserve water.
Isn't his agency responsible for all those ''Don't Drip New York Dry'' posters I see in public restrooms and on the subway?


Poland's 1920 Soviet Invasion Planted Seeds of Hitler-Stalin Pact
LEAD: To the Editor:


Campus Life: Harvard;   Conservatives Start Magazine To Preach 'Truth'
LEAD: Frustrated by what they call a moral wasteland on campus, politically conservative Harvard students have founded a magazine that they say preaches the ''absolute truth'' on issues like abortion, homosexuality and affirmative action.


Alvin R. Jennings, 85, Managed 'Big 8' Firm
LEAD: Alvin R. Jennings, a former managing partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and a past president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, died of a stroke on March 14 in Miami, where he lived in retirement.
He was 85 years old.


Evening Hours;   The Guests Sang For Their Supper
LEAD: Franco Zeffirelli's production of ''Don Giovanni'' made its debut on Thursday at the Metropolitan Opera, the 13th new production underwritten by Sybil Harrington, the Texas philanthropist.
Carroll and Milton Petrie gave the opening-night party, and the guests applauded the principals as they arrived at the champagne supper.


Richard R. Wins by a Nose
LEAD: Richard R. regained the lead from For Really in the final stride of a stretchlong duel to win the $110,800 Bay Shore Stakes by a long nose yesterday at Aqueduct.


Fashion;   Easter Isn't Just for the Bunny Rabbit
LEAD: Tradition holds sway again on the bunny trail, with ruffles and lace for girls and nautical themes for boys this Easter, perhaps because the holiday offers a rare chance to get the children into dress-up clothes.


Style Makers;   Alviero Martini, Graphic Designer
LEAD: It's a safe bet that when Alviero Martini arrived at Kennedy International Airport from Italy recently, he had more bags than any other traveler.
He was carrying dozens of samples of his new luggage collection, and you might say it stopped traffic. ''Everyone wanted to know where I got it,'' he reported with glee.


WHEN BRITISH JUSTICE FAILED
LEAD: Kevin Toolis's article helped to rectify the slander against four blameless individuals.
The author, however, may have overlooked the most sobering aspect of the case: was it bigotry - or racism - that triggered the illegal and excessive response of the authorities?


Now, Slyly, Comes The Yuppie Devil
LEAD: When Mephistopheles shows up wearing a gold Rolex he's truly a creature for our age.
Meet the yuppie devil: relaxed, assured, the very model of casual elegance even if he has no visible means of support.
He loves risks, particularly if they're being taken by others.
He loves comfort, especially comfort of the high-tech, high-gloss kind.


What About Me?
LEAD: To the Editor:


'Weapon' Test: Rentals Boom, Sales Pop
LEAD: A month ago in this space a question was posed: Would ''Lethal Weapon 2,'' Warner's smash-hit cop thriller released on Feb. 8 at $24.98, sell as well as or better than it rents?
Furthermore, would a movie rated R sell in a family-oriented market?
And would it sell after the Christmas season - in years past, the prime time for selling videos?


Searching for Quality Medical Care
LEAD: To the Editor:


Tech Notes;   Using Lasers to Repair a Cornea
LEAD: A two-year-old company, Phoenix Lasers Systems Inc., in San Francisco, has applied laser techniques developed for the military to ophthalmic surgery.
The new system combines a low-energy blue-green laser with a computer workstation.
The system is employed in the surgical technique called refractive keraplasty, which is used to alter the shape of the cornea to repair vision impairments, including near- and far-sightedness and glaucoma.


Ethnic Unrest Continues in Romania The Government has retracted accusations that Hungary fueled tensions that led to the rioting. (Reuters)


STARK CYCLADIC FIGURES HAUNT CONTEMPORARY COLLECTORS
LEAD: Travelers to Greece more than a century ago returned to other European countries with the eyeless, mouthless Cycladic idols that historians at the time described as primitive, even ugly.
Today these 5,000-year-old white marble figures - most of which depict women with their arms folded flat against their chests - are among the most prized of ancient artifacts and are viewed by many curators, historians and collectors as, in Picasso's words, ''magical objects.


Colorful Needlepoint That Reflects Brazil
LEAD: LIKE much of Brazil's heritage, the tradition of Brazilian needlepoint comes from its Portuguese past.
The stitches found in intricate needlepoint tapestries or rugs have been developed from the Portuguese Arraiolos stitch, named after a small town in Portugal.


Unsticking a Window
LEAD: WHEN spring presents the opportunity to open a home to the outdoors, owners of double-hung windows often find them stuck tight.
Sometimes, the cause is paint applied during a winter remodeling; most of the time, the cause is swelling of wooden window parts because of moisture.


Campus Life: Carnegie-Mellon;   Using Balloons To Bring Attention To Women's Place
LEAD: Orange balloons wandered around Carnegie-Mellon University's Pittsburgh campus this month, signaling the celebration of International Women's Day.
The balloons, provided by the Carnegie-Mellon Women's Center, were distributed to passers-by - female passers-by that is.
Men who wanted balloons were refused.


Knick Playoff Tickets
LEAD: With the Knicks apparently headed for the playoffs, the team has announced details of a postcard lottery to allocate tickets to home games.


Nicaragua Rivals Praise Contra Move to Disband
LEAD: All sides in Nicaragua's long civil conflict today hailed the contras' agreement on Friday to disband their army, apparently eliminating the most important obstacle to a peaceful transfer of power on April 25 between the Sandinistas and the newly elected government.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Softer Line
LEAD: Roman Catholic leaders have been talking as if being a little bit against abortion is like being a little bit pregnant.
But Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago says reasonable minds, or at least politicians' minds, can differ on the subject.
Even while Catholic officeholders are more or less obligated to oppose abortion, he said, they should not have to fear punishment for disagreeing on how to do that.


THE AGING HOOPSTER
LEAD: I am responding to Darren Kazimir's letter analyzing the basketball skills of those ''older guys'' (About Men: ''What Do You Call an Aging Hoopster,'' by Erich Rupprecht, Feb. 4).
As the wife of a 41-year-old die-hard lunch-hour basketball player, I see my husband as a competitive sportsman with a fervor for basketball bordering on a religious experience.


Loss of State Subsidies Threatens 3 Bus Lines
LEAD: THREE small bus lines, serving 7,000 riders a month in the Danbury, Middletown and Windham areas, could stop running as early as June 30, unless the state agrees to pay about $238,000 a year in subsidies to keep them going.


Realist Finds 'Bright Clear Sadness' in Skies and Shadows
LEAD: A PAINTER in the 1950's was, for all practical purposes, better Red than Realist, and the situation didn't improve much with the advent of the New Realism known as Pop.
Indeed, it seems now this movement did as much as Abstract Expressionism to make representation the self-conscious undertaking it is.

LEAD: Dr. and Mrs.
Lennard Wharton of Short Hills, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Ruth Margot Wharton to Stephen J. McDonald, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
David J. McDonald of Canton, Conn.
A June wedding is planned.


A Sculptor in Wood Joins Two Painters for Blue Hill Show
LEAD: AT the Blue Hill Cultural Center here, it is spring.
The Canada geese, without which no such center is complete, are stomping around the lake and the equally predictable Henry Moore bronze figure, a splash of verdigris in a taupe landscape, seems ready to join them.


Gunsel
LEAD: To the Editor: Regarding the derivation of ''gunsel'' (Letters on Travel, Jan. 21), the word does indeed derive from the old middle-high German word Gansel (little goose).
It is used to describe young, if empty-headed, girls.
With that meaning, the word is still used in Bavaria, Austria and the German-speaking section of


Data Bank/March 25, 1990


Troubling Doubles in 'Jekyll and Hyde'
LEAD: WATCH out for a spate of ''Jekyll and Hydes.'' No fewer than three musical adaptations of the 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson classic are going around.
Another, a Ridiculous Theatrical Company production, which is in a class by itself and may be the most sensible approach of all, has just closed in New York.


Question of the Week;   Should College Athletes Be Paid?
LEAD: As I sit here writing my check to pay another installment of my student loan, my heart bleeds for today's student athletes.
Having their dorm rooms, tuition and books paid for isn't enough.
The universities now need to pay them some spending money on the side.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:

Review/Dance;   Somber Choreography In Morningside Festival
LEAD: The fifth annual Morningside Dance Festival got off to a briskly produced start on Tuesday at the Theater of the Riverside Church.
The weeklong festival, presented by the Department of the Arts in Education at Teachers College of Columbia University, opened with eight works that stressed the virtues of solid craft and literate themes.


Flying With Film
LEAD: To the Editor: I recently shepherded 100 rolls of 35-millimeter film across more than 25,000 miles of the Far East where our worst enemies were a series of high-powered X-ray machines and a handful of inquisitive baggage examiners.
Some machines carried the false assurance: ''X-Ray Safe,'' and every examiner politely and firmly said, ''This machine will not damage your film.


In a Turnabout From Trial of North, Poindexter Prosecutor Seizes Drama
LEAD: It was with the greatest of patience that Dan K. Webb, the prosecutor in the Iran-contra trial of John M. Poindexter, began questioning his first witness, Oliver L. North.

LEAD: A SURGE of leasing activity in Fairfield County, particularly by companies moving out of New York City, is turning Fairfield commercial realtors here bullish for the first time in almost three years.


Fiscal Bureaucracy in Japan Loses Credibility
LEAD: By engineering Japan's miraculous economic recovery after the war, steering the shaken economy deftly through the oil crises of the 1970's and then stabilizing the nation's financial markets quickly after the United States stock market collapsed in October 1987, Japan's economic policy makers won an international reputation for unparalleled management ability.

A Bad Bill Where a Fix Would Do

Money, therefore, can be withdrawn without jeopardizing promised payments to current or future retirees.
So the corporate managers remove the excess money and give it to shareholders.

Reviews/Music;   A French Orchestra Visits With Maazel at the Helm
LEAD: In a long and varied career, the American conductor Lorin Maazel has worn many hats, and in recent years he has doffed several of them.
The next one will be the music directorship of the Orchestre National de France, a title he assumed in 1988 after becoming principal guest conductor in 1977.
He now plans to leave the orchestra next year.

Reviews/Music;   Proof That Conductors Do Make a Difference
LEAD: Anyone who doubts that conductors can change the sound of an orchestra and do it on short notice should have gone to Avery Fisher Hall a week ago and then again on Thursday night.
In successive weeks, Zdenek Macal and Christof Perick have filled in at the New York Philharmonic for the scheduled conductor, Klaus Tennstedt.

LEAD: Manu Chao, leader of Mano Negra, hit the stage of the Cat Club on Thursday night with a leap and rarely stood still for the next 90 minutes.

LEAD: Vytautas Landsbergis, who presides over Lithuania in its battle for sovereignty, seems an unlikely man to be thrust into a confrontation with a superpower.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:
N.B.A.
Heat 105, Bucks 102: Sherman Douglas hit a jumper from the free-throw line with 7.5 seconds left and slapped away a Milwaukee pass at the 1.3-second mark to lift Miami to victory over the Bucks last night in Miami.
The triumph snapped the Heat's losing streak at five games and gave the second-year franchise (16-54) more victories than it had last season.


Fiat Widens Soviet Deal

According to one New York City jury, it's $76 million.

Business Scene;   Global Strategies Vs. National Ties

BUSINESS DIGEST
LEAD:
THE ECONOMY
The savings industry had its worst year ever in 1989, with losses soaring to $19.2 billion, regulators said.

Review/Music;   Style for Period Instruments
LEAD: Searchers for appropriate 18th-century style on period instruments still stumble over the more mundane problems of playing the right notes, playing them in tune and doing both with confidence.
Sergiu Luca, in his violin-keyboard concert with John Gibbons at Weill Recital Hall on Friday, spent the evening as a model illustrator of how things were approached ''back then'' - with straightened, husky-sounding violin tone, with vibrato used as emphasis and accent rather than as blanket tone color, and with small subdivisions of phrase carved from longer melodic arcs.

LEAD: A first-time film director is making a movie about disgruntled marines on the island of Guam.

Review/Music;   The Cambridge Singers In Their New York Debut
LEAD: Judging a book by its cover, warns the old saw, may not be the wisest way to select reading matter.
To apply the same folk wisdom to music, a live concert by an artist or an ensemble known only from its recordings should be approached with a caution verging on skepticism.
Uncomfortably often, it is technology, not practice, that makes perfect.

Viewers can always depend on Cher's dress, or undress, to cheer up an Academy Awards show.
The vulgar opening musical number wasn't there, either.
Viewers could always depend on it for at least two days of coffee break conversation. (''Would you believe . . .?'') Last year's female fashion statement - prom queen run amok - had subsided into a certain cool minimalism, though there were still enough beads and sequins, plunges and slithers to memorialize Mae West.

LEAD: Time Warner Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the Lane Publishing Company, the publisher of Sunset magazine and Sunset Books, in a deal valued at $225 million.

LEAD: Robert W. Conner knelt in the mugginess of his greenhouse, gently fingering tiny seedlings of cantaloupe, watermelon, broccoli and cucumber, some of the thousands of sprouts that will be transplanted next month to fields on the more than 4,000 acres that he farms.
