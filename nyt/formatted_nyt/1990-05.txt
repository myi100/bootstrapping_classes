Triumph of Spite, Retribution and a Cat
''Tales From the Darkside'' is subtitled ''The Movie'' because tales like these are so familiar in other forms: as campfire stories, horror comics, television shows (with less gruesome special effects) and novels by Stephen King, one of whose stories is the basis for an episode here.
So nothing about ''Tales From the Darkside'' is likely to give anyone much of a scare.
But thanks to casting that is savvier than the horror norm, and to direction by John Harrison that is workmanlike and sometimes even witty, at least it's fun.
Spite plays an important role here, especially for the mummy in the film's first episode (''Lot 249,'' adapted from a story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle) who tries out certain embalming techniques on a spoiled, modern-day college boy.
Christian Slater and Steve Buscemi play fellow students engaged in a battle of wits, with the mummy as a dangerously lively pawn.
Spite also matters to the black cat in the film's middle installment, who is intent on killing the pharmaceuticals tycoon (William Hickey) who has developed a special drug with the help of 5,000 feline victims.

Review/Cabaret;   'D'Oyly 'Carte Blanche,' a Cinema Sendup
LEAD: Near the end of ''A D'Oyly Carte Blanche,'' an amusing set piece in Barry Keating's cabaret musical ''Hollywood Opera,'' Mary Cleere Haran, impersonating Viven Leigh as Blanche DuBois, tiptoes to the edge of the stage and borrows a menu from a ringside table.

Wall Street;   Remember Petrodollars? They're Back

A NEW LOOK AT A MAJOR MINIMALIST
LEAD: During the heady days of psychedelia and flower power in the 1960's, Terry Riley suddenly found himself leading the life of a famous composer.
His ''In C'' (1964) garnered Minimalism its first public acclaim.

The list of fish and shellfish that consumers have come to appreciate has lengthened to include many previously ignored varieties.


REKINDLING THE FIRES OF UTOPIAN MODERNISM
LEAD: To most visitors who stroll into the downtown branch of the Whitney Museum in lower Manhattan, if stroll is the word to describe the act of descending into this subterranean white chamber beneath an office building, the work by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien that is now on view will appear avant-garde.


Documentaries Struggle Out of the Straitjacket
LEAD: One of the main problems in assessing film documentaries can be found in the French word for the camera lens: l'objectif.
With its implications of objectivity, it crystallizes what most viewers assume about a documentary - that it is more ''real'' than a fiction film.


On Language;   Lay Down Your Marker
LEAD: THESE POLITICIANS want Bush to lay down a marker for all the world to see,'' wrote the columnists Evans and Novak in their muscular style, ''no matter how much discomfort it brings Gorbachev and his trading pals in Bonn.''

PUTTING DOWN ROOTS
LEAD: FOR A WHILE NOW, I'VE been thinking about planting a tree - a real tree.
It's not that I haven't planted trees before, but all of these have been minor ones, lightweights really, the kind of trees you can justify in the short term: white pines to screen the road, dwarf fruit trees, a crab apple or two, a tree hydrangea and a pair of Salix babylonica, the Tree of Immediate Gratification, otherwise known as the weeping willow.


Study Finds 'Astonishing' Indifference to Elections
LEAD: American democracy is being undermined by citizens who are so indifferent to national elections that an ''astonishing'' number of them did not even know who the candidates for Vice President were in 1988, a commission said today after a two-year study of Presidential politics.


Crumbling Cuba Still Loves to Rumba
LEAD: RECENTLY I found myself fondling a dollar bill of such limp antiquity that it called the entire concept of cash into question.
This tattered, pale greenback had been in circulation since the late 60's, but were it not for its privileged isolation on the island of Cuba, it would long ago have been incinerated.

Review/Recital;   From Bach to Schnittke By Heinrich Schiff, a Cellist
LEAD: Heinrich Schiff is a cellist of reassuring solidity.
There is no part of his technique not firmly in place.

Needed: A Longer School Year
LEAD: AMERICANS are now working longer and harder than at perhaps any time in this century.

They are the brainy blondes, and their hair color has no relation to their I.Q.'s.


Innovative Southwestern Fare at Its Best
LEAD: AN unlikely, almost unbelievable adobe hacienda, complete with views of the water, has taken root in Island Park.
Coyote Grill is unbelievable in another respect: its food is almost too good to be true.


In the Spirit Of Humanity And the Arts
LEAD: The 96-year-old American Academy in Rome celebrated the Year of the Landscape Artist on Wednesday evening at Tavern on the Green.
Three artists were honored: Millicent Johnsen, Rachel (Bunny) Mellon and Daniel U. Kiley.

Walking on the Trail of Lord Byron
LEAD: FROM childhood, I have loved walking and reading, ideally in close conjunction.
A loaf of bread, a jug of wine?
For me, a book and a backpack are enough.
Especially if I can walk in the footsteps of one of my favorite authors.


In a Freer State, a Cultural Heritage at Risk
LEAD: The flush of excitement with which most of the world has greeted political change in Eastern Europe obscures the reality about artistic life in cities like this: If improvements are to come here, they are far off and will be hard earned.

LEAD: Marta Renzi and the Project Company mixed choreographic pleasures with theatrical blunders on Tuesday night at the Bessie Schonberg Theater.


Where the Darker Myths Live
LEAD: THERE are limits to travel.
You cannot sail up and down the River Styx with Charon, the boatman who took the dead to Hades in Greek myth, as your tour guide.
Whatever your prospects for permanent residence there in the future, you cannot buy round-trip tickets to the place that the Greeks knew as Tartarus and we sometimes call Hell.

UNEASY ABOUT THE GERMANS
LEAD: DO GERMANS ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRIMES OF the Nazi era?

Baseball;   The Game That Is Forever Young
LEAD: The middle-aged men stood along the first-base line on Opening Day, soon after the parade that led all the children to the start of the 1990 Little League season at Michael Yatsko Field.

For Michael Blakemore, a Twofold Task
LEAD: ''I've had an amazing year, absolutely,'' Michael Blakemore said enthusiastically, as he sipped coffee one recent morning on the top floor of the renovated north London almshouse where he lives.
The 61-year-old Australian director is currently represented on Broadway by two hits - ''City of Angels'' at the Virginia Theater and ''Lettice and Lovage'' at the Ethel Barrymore - and if he seemed exultant, who could blame him?


Review/Recital;   A Violinist From France
LEAD: Christophe Boulier, a French violinist born in 1965, made an auspicious debut on Tuesday night at the 92d Street Y. French violinists, like French musicians in general, are sometimes praised, sometimes dismissed for a supposedly wispy elegance, a tendency to skate sensuously over music's surface rather than plumbing its


In 'Tod,' a Journey in the Maze of the Mind
LEAD: AT the end of a tortuous odyssey to reclaim his soul and realize his black identity, Tod, the very model of establishment success - white establishment success - reaches an epiphanic moment.
It sounds all too obvious, contrived and even ambiguous, but the message of solidarity he arrives at has the intimations of idealism and a hint of inspiration.

Cape May Journal;   Facing the Tourist Season With Mixed Feelings
LEAD: FOR now, life in Cape May is redolent of that in a small town, not a tourist haven.
Streets aren't clogged with cars, and parking is as easy to find as solitude on an oceanfront jog.
Best sellers still sit on shelves at the library, and there's no waiting anywhere, not at the Ugly Mug bar and restaurant, not at the Lobster House in Cape May


Question Of the Week;   Why Is The Triple Crown Won So Rarely?

Salzburg
LEAD: To the Editor: Your special music festivals issue (Travel, April 29) was extremely interesting, but your readers should know that last year in Salzburg, so well known for its festival, when my husband and I attended a Palace Concert (at the Residenz) - an event billed as a chamber orchestra playing Haydn, Mozart and Dvorak - the orchestra turned out to be a group of young people (teen-agers, early 20's), who, while showing promise, were in no way professional musicians.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Water seeps through the concrete floor of my basement.
This problem has developed near where valving was installed for an automatic sprinkling system.
The system, buried two feet deep near where the puddling occurs, does not leak.
Applying a waterproof sealer to the floor did not help.
Any suggestions?


A Greek Island That Resists Change
LEAD: COMING upon the island of Patmos in darkness, the presence of the church is merely a whisper in the traveler's ear.

It was Carol Groh &amp; Associates.


BRIDGE
LEAD: The next world team championships for the Bermuda Bowl, scheduled in Yokohama, Japan, in September 1991 will have an enlarged format: 16 teams.

Jobs Program for Students Is Lagging
LEAD: A JOBS program that was supposed to place 10,000 urban high school graduates into upwardly mobile positions by 1992 is falling far short of its goal, prompting state officials to re-examine the program to see if it can be structured more effectively.


In This Painter's World, Everything Is Several Things
LEAD: Susan Rothenberg is back.
With her blood-red heads stuck at both ends of a jump-rope-length bone, so that the two-headed figure becomes a gigantic baby rattle; with her dancers, gymnasts and acrobats so elastic that they can curve their bodies into O's and U's and put their feet behind their heads without bending their backs, and with her horses' heads as long as snakes and as rubbery as hoses, this 45-year-old painter has re-established herself as one of the most compelling artists of her generation.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:
AN EXPOSURE OF THE HEART, by Rebecca Busselle. (Penguin, $8.95.) A photographer spends a year at a state institution for the retarded, learning that some truths cannot be captured on film. ''Her words force a reader beyond the barrier of invisibility that usually separates the rest of us from those beings whose damaged minds represent a largely arbitrary and therefore infinitely terrifying human possibility,'' Susan Jacoby said here last year.


THE WONDER YEARS
LEAD:
ASTOUNDING DAYS: A Science Fictional Autobiography.
By Arthur C. Clarke. (Spectra/Bantam, Paper, $8.95.) Science fiction is sometimes closer to and often farther ahead of the truth than hard, cold reality.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Bloomingdale's Lease May Be Challenged
LEAD: The landlord of Bloomingdale's flagship store in Manhattan has filed preliminary court papers that could lead to eviction proceedings.


Is the Fight On Drugs Eroding Civil Rights?
LEAD: MANY Americans are taking a kind of patriotic pride in submitting to roadblocks and airport questioning aimed at snaring drug smugglers; few are raising objections to the proliferation of urine testing and recent Supreme Court rulings that permit the police to hover over backyards in helicopters and poke into garbage cans without the old requirement of at least a glimmer of suspicion.


Tech Notes;   Envisioning Peak Performance
LEAD: For years coaches have used high-speed motion pictures as training aids.
Now, video technology has been combined with computers and tiny sensors that monitor muscle movements to give a far more detailed analysis of human motion.
According to Gary L. Scheirman, manager of biomechanics at Peak Performance Technologies Inc.

The high-jumping Charles Dumas and the speedy Jim Beatty are among 10 candidates for a minimum of 3 places in the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in Indianapolis.


Question Of the Week;   Why Is The Triple Crown Won So Rarely?
LEAD: Leading off with the Kentucky Derby, an elite group of 3-year-olds are asked to go a mile and a quarter, longer than any distance they have ever run.
The Derby usually attracts 15-20 horses and the post positions and traffic problems experienced on the Churchill Downs oval can play a big role in the outcome.


Fresh Mark For Minoso?
LEAD: HE has six names and once played for the master baseball showman Bill Veeck, so it should come as no real surprise that at the age of 67, Saturnino Orestes Arrieta Armas (Minnie) Minoso will be called out of retirement for the third time to extend his claim on major league history by playing in his sixth decade as a major leaguer.


Style Makers;   Dominick Avellino: SPORTSWEAR DESIGNER
LEAD: In his 20's he was known as D. D. Dominick, designing sweaters and colorful sportswear for his contemporaries and selling them in his own New York boutique, first on East 51st Street then on 60th Street.

TALKING: Solar Energy;   Systems Making a Comeback
LEAD: REMEMBER the late 70's, when designs for solar systems like rooftop collectors, greenhouses and heat pumps were pouring off the drawing boards as fast as fuel prices rose?
Fuel shortages were predicted and tax credits for renewable-energy installations tempted homeowners.


Disbelieving and Defiant, Students Vow: No Men

CAMERA
LEAD: Tom Telemark, the globe-trotting photojournalist, appeared at my door last week all excited. ''Guess what I got!'' he asked. ''Rollerblades?'' I guessed, wrongly. ''No, a new camera outfit,'' he said.

Ellis Cohen of Lido Beach, L


Notably Absent
LEAD: He was the National Hockey League's most valuable player in 9 of the 10 previous seasons, and he led the league in scoring again this season, so there should be no surprise if Wayne Gretzky took his 10th Hart Trophy as the 1989-90 most valuable player.
Except for one thing.
Gretzky, who scored 40 goals and had 102 assists for a league-leading 142 points, is not among the three finalists nominated for the award.


Mean Streets and Fresh Air
LEAD: The meadow had a lot of flowers and bees.
There was a big hill, and you could roll down it and just sit there and look at the flowers. - Rosalina, age 9.


Why Near The City Is Too Far
LEAD: After living in the county all my life I have developed an inferiority complex.
Although I can brag to people from Maine or Ohio that I am from New York (which is enough to impress someone from Maine or Ohio), whenever I meet people from Manhattan they treat me as if I am a country bumpkin.

John and Paul in Larchmont, N.Y., to J. Bradley Shaw, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
William A. Shaw of Suffolk, Va.
Msgr.
Joseph J. Boyd performed the ceremony.


Beauty/Fashion;   Shades Of Difference
LEAD: Something had to give.
After years of living with brown lipstick, taupe eyeshadow, imperceptible blusher and transparent mascara, a little visible makeup comes as a relief.
Pale, powdery pink, faint peach, light banana and - would you believe it - light blue are being revived in fashion and in makeup.


Plenty of Horn
LEAD: BEN NEILL SAYS THE MUSIC HE makes has the qualities of a conversation, not a new idea in ensemble playing, which Neill, 32, who was trained as a classical trumpet player, does a fair amount of.
But he is speaking of solo work, talking with himself, as it were, which was the inspiration for the instrument he designed and built and is shown playing above.


First Lady: Role Or Role Model?
LEAD: She may not be known as a public speaker but Barbara Bush's commencement speech at Wellesley College had a lot of people speaking up last week, a month before she is scheduled to give it.


'Summit' on Balderdash Mountain
LEAD: Today is shaping up to be a witches' sabbath here.
The top Congressional leaders will huddle with President Bush and numbers wizard Richard Darman to attempt to spike the budget brew.
If past experience is any guide, the objective of this non-summit ''summit'' conference will be to concoct the right mix of lizard's tail and newt's eye to put the American people to sleep until after the election.


New Course Offers Grammar Skills
LEAD: LAST year, when the A. T. Cross Company of Lincoln, R.I., wanted some of its employees to improve their writing and grammar skills, the company explored two options.

Review/Music;   One-Woman Pop Memoir
LEAD: For Shelley Hirsch, the past is less a story told than a pastiche of surviving impressions.
Her one-woman show, ''O Little Town of East New York,'' may begin in the neighborhood of her childhood and end with the wreckage it is today, but in between is a rich jumble of friends, family, scenes and situations remembered.


At Planting Time, Nature Needs Help
LEAD: THE planting season is in full swing.
Everything is going into the ground: shrubs, perennials, wildflowers and annuals.
But there are important exceptions, the most tender plants like tomatoes and impatiens.
Wait another week or so before putting them in, because killing frosts may still occur in this region.


Purchase Campus Plays Host to Broadway Stars
LEAD: Since the middle of March, the State University of New York at Purchase has been astir with the sounds of a big, splashy musical.

Charlene Corbett Weds Victor Tosi
LEAD: The marriage of Charlene Denise Corbett and Victor Steven Tosi took place yesterday at Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church on Gun Hill Road in the Bronx.
The Rev.
Robert Grix performed the ceremony.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: It's not really important.
In fact, it probably ranks somewhere near the bottom of any list of things that need to be or should be seriously considered.
Nevertheless, unimportant things can often be irritating, frustrating or embarrassing and sometimes all three.

Ignorance of 'L.A. Law' Is No Excuse for Lawyers
LEAD: One Friday last December, David F. Ennis, a lawyer in Miami Beach, Fla., found himself with a novel but serious problem: The case he was handling was about to go to the jury, and Mr.
Ennis had just learned, to his consternation, that the episode of NBC's ''L.A.

LEAD: To the Editor: Travelers planning to visit Ireland might benefit from my experience in car rental, the cost of which was included in our seven-day package.


Patching Concrete Steps
LEAD: CONCRETE outdoor steps are durable, and ordinarily will last the life of a house.
But concrete is inherently brittle, and so corners and sharp edges of such steps are vulnerable to chipping.


New Concern Voiced on Spread of AIDS
LEAD: A SHARP rise since 1987 in the incidence of syphilis and a form of gonorrhea that is resistant to penicillin has prompted concern among health officials that education programs promoting safe sex are not working and that the spread of AIDS among heterosexuals may also rise.


Benjamin Ellis Tenzer, Engineer, 54
LEAD: Benjamin Ellis Tenzer, a metallurgical engineer who was involved in reform Democratic politics in Brooklyn, died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at his home in Brooklyn last Wednesday.
He was 54 years old.


IS IT TRUE WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT DIXIE?
LEAD: Peter Applebome seems to miss the point.
Grizzard's ''shtick'' is not ''that he's the ultimate confused man, trying to live by old values in a changing world.'' Grizzard is no more or less confused than any active alcoholic.
He's stuck.
He doesn't express what he feels, which is one reason Pat Conroy had to ''translate'' what he meant.


Bonnie Walters Weds Kurt A. Koehler
LEAD: Bonnie Elizabeth Walters, the daughter of David Charles Walters of Memphis and Elizabeth Park Walters of Bronxville, N.Y., was married yesterday at Christ Episcopal Church to Kurt Alan Koehler, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

A FEMINIST TAKES STOCK
LEAD: Judging from your cover photograph (five white women), and the article's straight, white, New York orientation, one could draw the mistaken conclusion that feminism has not had an impact on public consciousness about homophobia, ageism, class, racism.


Voice of Experience
LEAD: He is hardly the only baseball player scrambling up the minor league alphabet ladder in hopes of reaching the major leagues, but Jerry Reuss, a left-handed pitcher who was promoted last week from the Houston Astros' Class AA farm club in Columbus, Ga., to Houston's Class AAA club in Tucson, Ariz., thinks he has an edge.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT/VIDEO: AND KEEP IN MIND
LEAD:
Here are some notable releases of the last few months.


TALES OF HAMLETS THEN AND NOW
LEAD: Lending himself to a host of needs, generous in his willingness to do what's wanted of him, Hamlet is the supremely adaptable dramatic character.
Though the occasion of his crisis is the need to avenge his father's murder, something far less specific is involved: a universality of dilemma and anguish; a noble soul forced to act ignobly, an honest one forced to lie.


Amy Richardson Weds
LEAD: Amy Treadwell Richardson and Joseph Thomas Spinelli were married yesterday at the Episcopal Church of the Advent in Boston by the Rev.
David P. Curry.
Mrs.

Bar Write-Offs For Tickets
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Studying Pitchers May Provide Answers on Shoulder Injuries
LEAD: Pitchers and pitching coaches sprinkle their conversations with terms like split-fingered fastball and knuckle-curve and straight change.
They never talk about anterior subluxation, nor any kind of subluxation, for that matter.


An Unwelcome Peace
LEAD: I AM EN ROUTE TO VISIT my parents.
They live, like so many other parents, in Florida - the recent configurations of my generation's lives are strikingly similar.


On the Street;   When Pucci Met Lycra, It Was Love At First Sight
LEAD: A couple of decades ago an Italian designer named Emilio Pucci slipcovered the fashion world with wild and colorful patterns that looked as if they had just floated up from the bottom of the sea.
So guess what's bobbed back up?
Pucci's dazzling designs.
They are with us once more, on silk and cotton shirts, dresses, scarfs, handbags, and on something that wasn't around in the 50's and 60's - Lycra stretch tights.

LEAD: After giving out an achievement award each year since 1983, the Canadian Society of New York decided to break with tradition this year by honoring two hockey greats at one clip.

The successful talks between the Government and the African National Congress are raising hopes that the old enemies could hasten the demise of apartheid.


A Case for Selling N.Y.C.'s Airports
LEAD: In its current economic mess, New York City can learn a lesson from the corner bodega owner.
He will tell you: ''You need cash?
The worst thing to do is raise prices and cut services.
The best thing to do is trim inventory.'' The city should heed that advice and sell two major city-owned assets: John F.


Question Of the Week;   Why Is The Triple Crown Won So Rarely?
LEAD: In May of a thoroughbred's third year, the horse has not yet fully matured physically.
With the Triple Crown races running close together, it is difficult for a young horse to run three strong races consecutively.
Also, the Triple Crown closes with the Belmont Stakes at a mile and a half.
This grueling distance often proves too much for even the best of horses.

The Case of the Telltale Passport
LEAD: A READER asks about getting the Government to omit the birthplace listing on a passport.

Traveling Isn't Child's Play
LEAD: I TAPED a big road map of Italy to our kitchen wall.
Each day I asked our children to point out the spots where we would be staying.
Roma, Gubbio, Sicilia.
Friends warned us that the kids were a little young for a backpacking adventure - Rhodes, just 3, and Metthea, 5.
But Ali and I were eager to get back to the country that had intoxicated us on an earlier, childless trip.

NONFICTION
LEAD:
THE HOLLOW DOLL: A Little box of Japanese Shocks. by William Bohnaker. (Available/Ballantine, Paper, $8.95.) It comes as no surprise to a reader of William Bohnaker's lively and gracefully written book that he is a student of Zen.
He peppers ''The Hollow Doll'' with pronouncements that resemble Zen Koans, or parables, that he clearly knows so well - alternately insightful, maddening, profound and simplistic.


Nurses Get V.I.P. Treatment, Easing Shortage
LEAD: Betsey Vernizzi, an orthopedic nurse at St.
Anthony Medical Center here, recalled a course she took nearly 20 years ago in nursing school. ''It was called ethics,'' she said. ''I was taught to say 'Yes, sir, no sir.' If a doctor walked into the nurse's station, you gave him your chair.
I called them 'Doctor.

Europe's Try for a One-Stop Merger
LEAD: Mergers are surging in the European Community in anticipation of a more unified market in 1992.

A Soviet Appetite for U.S. Knowhow
LEAD: I have been doing business in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe for more than 20 years.

MICKEY MOUSE BUILDINGS
LEAD: It occurred to me, after reading Patricia Leigh Brown's article ''Disney Deco'' (April 8), that the architects for Disney could save considerable effort and expense if they were to construct a giant set of portable mouse ears that could be affixed to existing buildings.
Say, Disney needs some office space in New York City.


HOT AND COLD
LEAD: THE COMBINATION IS AS CLASSIC AND familiar as hot fudge sauce thickening on a scoop of ice cream, or cool sour cream melting in a bowl of steaming borscht.
There is the simple cup of hot cocoa dabbed with cold whipped cream, and the flamboyant baked Alaska - ice cream and cake wrapped in meringue and flambeed.

Review/Music;   Harry Partch's Visions In Bang on a Can Series
LEAD: It would be too cute to claim that the fourth annual Bang on a Can Festival got under way with a bang Friday night.
More like a gentle sigh, a wheeze, eerie twangs and rattling runs of woody clunks.


Sunday Menu;   Steamed Fish, Asparagus And a Pinch of Color
LEAD: The original version of this menu was created after this year's first purchase of local asparagus, scallions and what the vendor called black fish.

Come What May, Congress Stays True to the Critters
LEAD: IF money is the sole indication, then no animal is more adored by Congress than a cow.
Congress authorized $16.2 billion in subsidies over the last 10 years to bring the supply of milk into line with demand.
Nor are the rangier, more ornery beef cattle ignored.
Congress has taken special care since the mid-1930's to provide them grass and water, at enormous expense to the


Stylish Spot for French and Italian Fare
LEAD: THE setting at Bellini is elegant, and the restaurant's management has seemingly worked a miracle, turning the long, narrow first floor of a modest three-story house in a disheveled neighborhood into an intimate dining room.

At Planting Time, Nature Needs Help
LEAD: THE planting season is in full swing.

A Show of 3 Contemporaries In an Old English Setting
LEAD: Concordia was founded as a school in 1861, then in 1865 was transformed into a liberal arts college that has since developed a reputation for music education.
Its red and white brick building makes an imposing landmark at 171 White Plains Post Road and, the Tudor facade with its leaded windows and the quadrangle behind speak of Old England, roast beef and all.


'BOYS NEXT DOOR': IN A GROUP HOUSE
LEAD: Less than four years after a premiere at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., ''The Boys Next Door'' has become a small regional theater favorite.
That's a wonder - and it's no wonder.
For here is just the sort of play some people resist, misunderstand or find threatening, but its emotional pull and entertainment value besides are considerable.


STAMPS
LEAD: With the flood of new issues from new countries in recent years, many hobbyists have drifted away from the old routine of collecting one copy of every stamp as it comes out.

Rule, a former president of the American Broadcasting Companies whose management pioneered mini-series, made-for-television movies and Monday night football and led the ailing company to network dominance in the late 1970's, died of cancer yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif.
He was 73 years old.


A FEMINIST TAKES STOCK
LEAD: Living abroad and working with European feminists brought home to me that a singular failing of American feminism is its inability to come to grips with the concept of ''family.'' Vivian Gornick's article poignantly underscores this point, beginning with an argument based on the rejection of intimacy and ending with a description of the ''new woman of the 70's and 80's'' who lives with ''intermittent erotic connection and the company of intelligent women.

Question Of the Week;   Why Is The Triple Crown Won So Rarely?
LEAD: As one who saw Citation win the Triple Crown and who waited 25 years to see Secretariat complete the next Triple Crown, I would suggest that immature, injury-prone 3-year-olds (equivalent in age to a human teen-ager), competing on three different and widely differing race tracks within a short span of time, face a daunting challenge.


GIFTED CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS: A MATTER OF CLASS
LEAD: RECENTLY, A CLASS OF kindergartners and first graders at Hunter College Elementary School for the gifted in Manhattan were discussing with their teacher what Mayor David N. Dinkins might do for the city's 5- and 6-year-olds.


After 19 Months, All Roads Led to Kurt Masur
LEAD: The 19-month search to find a new music director for the New York Philharmonic had a drama all its own, with disappointments, frustration, good and bad luck and healthy contention playing their parts.
Kurt Masur may have initially been the fourth or fifth choice, but the Philharmonic's officers and musicians suggest that in the 62-year-old East


Review/Jazz;   Steve Lacy, Saxophonist
LEAD: Steve Lacy, the expatriate American saxophonist, is a master of stasis.
Where most jazz musicians bull their way through tunes, leaving notes as a motorboat leaves a wake, Mr.
Lacy mulls each phrase over and over.
He will play an idea, then repeat it, bending the last note.
Or he will add a few notes, or drop some.


Potter Tackles Mystery Of a Chinese Glaze
LEAD: FOR 10 years Albert Green, one of New Jersey's best-known potters, has been trying to solve an ancient puzzle.

Wildlife biologists raise black-footed ferrets in an attempt to restore an almost extinct species.

Ballet Theater's Challenge: To Reclaim Its Soul
LEAD: Paradise regained?
Anyone who thinks - as many do - that American Ballet Theater misplaced its soul during the decade that Mikhail Baryshnikov was its artistic director will now be closely watching a new regime determined to redefine the company's identity.
Tomorrow's opening of the troupe's 50th-anniversary season in New York at the Metropolitan Opera House begins an era in which Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith, the recently named co-directors, promise to restore certain names and policies identified with Ballet Theater's past.


Taking a Lesson From Eastern Europe
LEAD: I read in earnest Pete Dunne's March 18 column, ''In the Natural State,'' in which he reflects on the recent developments in Eastern Europe.
He goes on to concede his embarrassment because he admits that he never gave the people of Eastern Europe the respect for self-determination they have proved to deserve.

WHAT'S DOING IN: ATHENS
LEAD: Somehow, despite the chaos, life in Athens makes sense.
For those who can't unplug completely even when they've escaped to an island retreat, Athens is a crash course in relaxation without the deprivation of city amenities.
Here, people don't ask what you do for a living until well into the conversation, sometimes never at all.


The Executive Computer;   Handy Tools for Taming an Unruly Operating System
LEAD: Utility programs can tame unruly operating systems, find lost files, back up and protect data, speed up the operation of hard disks, guard against computer viruses, prolong the life of a monitor, add new functions, and more.

Word Has It They'll Raise The Rent
LEAD: No one knows for sure yet, but rentals for movies at the video store - now in the $2.50 to $3 range - could take a jump in the next few months.
Rent is connected to price, both retail and wholesale.
Blaming higher costs and a soft rental market, four major studios - Warner, Paramount, MCA/Universal and RCA/Columbia - are raising the retail list prices of rental ''A titles'' (the best-known movies) from the $89.95 level prevalent since 1986 to $92.95 or thereabouts.

Achievement: The Key To Self-Esteem
LEAD: Recently two letter writers opposed giving grades in an attempt to improve pupils' self-esteem.
Do they really think children can be kept from knowing how well or poorly they are doing?
Children know.
The absence of marks, if anything, would make achievement less important in their eyes.
Also, promoting an unprepared child would quickly destroy what was left of his self-confidence.

LEAD: Nicaraguan rebels today agreed with the new Government to begin disarming next week, and President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro pledged to start reducing the size of the Sandinista-controlled army.

Town Meetings: History in Action
LEAD: AS the crowd filed into the assembly room of the Harwinton Town Hall on a recent Tuesday evening, Lawrence Connors anxiously scanned their faces.

Reviews/Dance;   Collaborative Efforts By New Repertory Group

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: State Street Penitent;   A Taste of the Past to Emend a Builder's Blunder
LEAD: FROM the ground up - indeed, from beneath the ground up - 17 State Street has proved at almost every turn to be troubled.

LONG LAYOFF TAKES TOLL ON RIGHETTI

Simple And Short Party Dresses
LEAD: Keep it simple, and keep it short.
That's the way to go for spring and summer parties.

Short dresses look young and modern, especially when they bare the arms and shoulders.


More to the Slurs Than Meets the Ear
LEAD: There are two audiences for Nick Nolte's electrifying monologue at the start of Sidney Lumet's ''Q &amp; A,'' one in the movie theater and one on the screen.

Bruins Finish Strong to Defeat Capitals
LEAD: The victory was surgical in its precision, thorough in all its aspects, perfect to the extent that it was untarnished by so much as a single blemish on the scoreboard.
And so it was hard not to sense, amid the smoky haze, acrid warmth and general euphoria of Boston Garden, the air of inevitability.


MOVIE RENTALS FADE, FORCING AN INDUSTRY TO CHANGE ITS FOCUS

SHADES OF WHITE
LEAD: White.
It's the most basic of colors, yet the most complex.

A FEMINIST TAKES STOCK
LEAD: I am troubled by Vivan Gornick's assumption that young women today are unwilling to be labeled ''feminist.'' This implies that they are not grateful or even aware of the sacrifices and gains made by pioneer feminists.
I am a 26-year-old professional woman and I proudly call myself a feminist.
I recognize the relative privilege of my position compared to women of the past, and I am grateful for the women's movement and the opportunities it has created for me.

LEAD: THE planting season is in full swing.
Everything is going into the ground: shrubs, perennials, wildflowers and annuals.

Review/Music;   Firkusny Is Guest for Y Chamber Finale
LEAD: The final concerts of the season's Chamber Music at the Y (meaning the 92d Street Y, of course), on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, were of uncommon interest for three reasons.
One, excellent performances.
Two, excellent and sometimes unusual music.
Three, final proof, if proof were needed, that a wildly international assemblage of musicians can be forged into idiomatic exponents of a national style.


In 'Gypsy,' a Rose Is a Role Is a Killer
LEAD: ''It's like a prizefight,'' said Tyne Daly of her role in the current Broadway revival of ''Gypsy,'' which last week received five Tony Award nominations, including one for Ms.
Daly. ''It's like being in training for a prizefight.
The way the part is written, it allows no letdown.
Especially on two-performance days - we call them double-headers - that tends to feel more like an athletic event than an artistic experience.


Currency;   A Bad Week for the Dollar
LEAD: It was a bad week for the dollar.
First, on Wednesday, it dropped sharply against the West German mark, the Swiss franc and other European currencies.
Then on Friday, the other shoe fell, as the dollar plummeted against the Japanese yen.
The dollar has been weak against the mark and most Europen currencies all year but strong against the yen.

LEAD: I GREW UP IN THE Kentucky knobs, a westward-flung, northwest-curling finger of the Appalachians: steep, Catholic-ridden ridges that form a ragged barrier between the ruling-class Presbyterians and gentlemen-farmer Episcopalians of the rolling Bluegrass (to the north and east) and the foot-washing Baptists and dirt-poor Pentacostals of the lumpy Pennyrile (to the south and west).

A Negative Vote On Affirmative Action
LEAD: IN A FEW SHORT YEARS, WHEN MY TWO children will be applying to college, the affirmative-action policies by which most universities offer black students some form of preferential treatment will present me with a dilemma.
I am a middle-class black, a college professor, far from wealthy, but also well removed from the kind of deprivation that would qualify my children for the label ''disadvantaged.

These powerful men are often depicted standing or brooding against vast expanses of space.


Question Of the Week;   Will Dent and Johnson Last The Season?
LEAD: If the Mets are not above .500 by June 1, Johnson will be gone.
The knowledgeable Mets fan realizes that it's not the manager's fault.
The Mets are simply not that good and pitching alone isn't enough.
The team batting average has been low and the Mets are very weak defensively.


The 'Historic' Era Is Coming Closer to Us
LEAD: During the stereo LP era, the term ''historical'' was traditionally used for recordings originally issued at 78 rpm, and the field was naturally dominated by the descendants of the companies that were dominant in the years before LP - above all the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA, now BMG) and the Gramophone Company (EMI/Angel).


Beaufort, a Town That Rose Again
LEAD: In March 1936 the photographer Walker Evans, who was documenting poverty in the South, found himself in Beaufort, S.C., facing an undeniably beautiful 18th-century frame house.

Question Of the Week;   Will Dent and Johnson Last The Season?
LEAD: Neither New York manager will be around by the All-Star Game break.
In Dent's case, it is traditional that the field manager take the blame for the poor cast, spelled mainly, P-I-T-C-H-I-N-G, assembled by Steinbrenner.
As for Johnson, he should not have been brought back this year; instead of starting afresh, the Met front office sacrificed two coaches for Johnson's inability to lead this club.

REFERENCE
LEAD:
HUNTING HUMANS: An Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers.
By Michael Newton. (Loompanics Unlimited, $34.95.) Why an encyclopedia of serial killers?

Ginger in Western Cooking
LEAD: THE Chinese use fresh ginger in their cooking the way Westerners use salt and pepper.
But in recent years it has been showing up more and more in dishes that are not in the least Chinese.
Ginger adds a refreshing tartness to fish and chicken, perks up marinades, and is also good with vegetables such as mustard greens or broccoli rabe, adding a slightly sharp spicy taste that counteracts their bitterness.

ARCHIVES FROM TWO WHO GOT ROCK ROLLING
LEAD: It's mildly amazing how little commercial success Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis have had, given their positions as two of the great architects of rock-and roll.
Both started recording in the mid-1950's; by 1960, each had worn out his respective hits (and Mr. Lewis had married his 13-year-old cousin, which further helped sink his carreer).

Corrections
LEAD: A brief article by The Associated Press in some editions last Sunday about anti-Semitic graffiti at Bertolt Brecht's grave in Berlin misstated the playwright's religion.
He was reared as a Lutheran; he was not Jewish.
The article also misidentified a country where Brecht lived in exile before settling in East Germany.


Salem's Seafaring Legacy
LEAD: As the early-morning mist comes in from the harbor in Salem, Mass., the most pleasant place to be is on the Common.
This wide expanse of green is both a cultural and physical hub of the coastal town north of Boston, and the odd geometry of its criss-crossing paths is a product of habit and time.
Today, morning joggers may have replaced the pasturing cows and military parades of former times, but still there is a feeling in this setting, surrounded by fine Federal houses, of the orderliness and peace that gave this Essex County town its name (from the

The Silent Drama In Vuillard's Rooms
LEAD: EdouarD Vuillard has been called an intimist, and the term has made it possible for him to be thought of as minor: a painter of interiors, of life that is merely private, a thoughtful, wistful chronicler of a vanished world, a boy who lived at home.
Major shows devoted to Vuillard are rare. ''The Intimate Interiors of Edouard Vuillard,'' the exhibition of his paintings and prints that will open on Friday at the Brooklyn Museum (it has already been seen in Washington and

WHAT WOMEN WANT FROM FEMINISM
LEAD: Vivian Gornick compares feminism to psychoanalysis, and is saddened that women seem stuck at the level at which insight does not seem to produce real change (''Who Says We Haven't Made A Revolution?'' April 15).
I think feminism has achieved more successes, is more popular and has changed women's outlooks more than Gornick recognizes, but in any case her metaphor is misleading.


Pastimes;   Bridge
LEAD: It is not uncommon for a club to arrange a Pro-Am event in which invited experts play with members.
But that requires the cooperation of many stars who may not be willing to spare the time.
Few clubs appreciate that a special evening can be built around one or two experts who play each board with a different partner.

Rock From New Zealand Inhabits Its Own Hemisphere
LEAD: While punk-era bands like the Sex Pistols, the Ramones and Talking Heads were re-energizing rock-and-roll in the United Kingdom and the United States, a group called the Clean, active in New Zealand from 1978 until 1982, was responsible for reshaping the sound of rock music in that country.

A Matter of Choices
LEAD: I have long nursed a secret fantasy of kidnapping Barbara Bush, taking her to a Connecticut hideaway with a perennial border and lots of chintz, and force-feeding her Gatorade until she breaks down and admits that she is pro-choice.
This fantasy has nothing to do with Mrs.
Bush; it has to do with the role we have been led to believe she plays in the life of her husband.


Moncrief's Memory
LEAD: Glad-Handing alumni are familiar to most big-time college athletes, but according to the former Arkansas basketball star Sidney Moncrief, some alumni hands are more gladdening than others.

Rewards of Public Service Are Growing

Abortion Foes' Centers Guiding Lives After Births

CORPORTE DESIGN THAT STAYS ONTHE SAFE SIDE
LEAD: It may be easy to knock I.B.M. if you're in the computer business, but it's tougher if you're in the architecture business.
For nearly 40 years the I.B.M.
Corporation has been the business world's most consistently serious architectural patron, producing an array of buildings by the likes of Eero Saarinen, Marcel Breuer, Mies van der Rohe, Edward Larrabee Barnes and Mitchell/Giurgola that seem intended not only to serve the company's needs, but to prove beyond any doubt that a mega-corporation can engage in high-quality building on an international scale.

Ginger in Western Cooking
LEAD: THE Chinese use fresh ginger in their cooking the way Westerners use salt and pepper.
But in recent years it has been showing up more and more in dishes that are not in the least Chinese.
Ginger adds a refreshing tartness to fish and chicken, perks up marinades, and is also good with vegetables such as mustard greens or broccoli rabe, adding a slightly sharp spicy taste that counteracts their bitterness.

Ginger in Western Cooking
LEAD: THE Chinese use fresh ginger in their cooking the way Westerners use salt and pepper.
But in recent years it has been showing up more and more in dishes that are not in the least Chinese.
Ginger adds a refreshing tartness to fish and chicken, perks up marinades, and is also good with vegetables such as mustard greens or broccoli rabe, adding a slightly sharp spicy taste that counteracts their bitterness.


Pastimes;   Camera
LEAD: Those whose memories of the 1970's have not faded may remember Henry Wilhelm of Grinnell, Iowa.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES
LEAD:
CLASSICAL
Perotin: Choral Works (Plus Anonymous Works)
Hilliard Ensemble directed by Paul Hillier. ECM 1385; CD only.
In 1977, David Munrow's album ''Music of the Gothic Era'' opened many an ear with its apparent contemporaneity.
In lilting, hypnotic (and necessarily somewhat conjectural) performances, the great composers of the Notre Dame school, Perotin and Leonin, seemed to have anticipated not only minimalism, but even jazz.

Review/Theater;   'The Tower of Evil,' Dumas Revenge Tale
LEAD: Though Alexandre Dumas pere is best known for his romantic novels ''The Three Musketeers'' and ''The Count of Monte Cristo,'' he also left a legacy of plays, including ''La Tour de Nesle,'' a bloodthirsty historical melodrama written in 1832.
Despite that play's continuing popularity in France, it turns out to be creaky and contrived, not the well-oiled mechanism one would have expected.


Campus Life: UMass;   From Street Crime To a Life Of Higher Learning
LEAD: A 36-year-old ex-convict who turned from street crime and drug addiction to pursue an education at the University of Massachusetts has been honored by the National University Continuing Education Association of Washington.


Bikers and Hikers On the Greenbelt Trail
LEAD: ''About Long Island: Over the River and Through the Woods'' (April 15) presents an extremely inaccurate and damaging introduction to our Nassau-Suffolk Greenbelt Trail.

ATLAS OF HUMAN ANATOMY.
By Frank H. Netter. (Ciba-Geigy, 14 Henderson Drive, West Caldwell, N.J. 07006, Cloth, $120; Paper, $49.95.) Commercial art wasn't the career Frank H. Netter's parents wanted for him.

Freedom to Beg Ends at Turnstile

In a ruling called hard-hearted by the homeless but welcomed by thousands of straphangers, a Federal appeals court ruled that constitutional free speech guarantees do not cover requests for spare change.


WHEN LEGAL TITANS CLASH
LEAD: Women teach at Harvard Law School, too.
Currently, there are five tenured women on the faculty - Elizabeth Bartholet, Martha Field, Mary Ann Glendon, Martha Minow and Kathleen Sullivan.
The author's failure to include even one reinforces the inferior status afforded female scholars and female lawyers in our society.


Fixing a Life Shattered on Wall Street

Fuming had turned to pondering, and I was guessing I was incorrigible.


Corrections
LEAD: An article in the Campus Life pages on April 29 incorrectly described a tenure revision proposal defeated by the faculty senate of the University of Connecticut at Storrs.

P.L.O. and Iraq Cooperate on Hard-Line Strategy &gt;
LEAD: With Middle East peace negotiations stalled and Arab leaders unable to agree on how to deal with Israel, Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq are cooperating more closely than ever in a strategy apparently intended to strengthen their positions in the

WHAT WOMEN WANT FROM FEMINISM
LEAD: The author theorizes proficiently with many philosophical models.

Chile Agrees to Pay Reparations to U.S. In Slaying of Envoy
LEAD: The new Government of Chile agreed in principle today to pay compensation for the killing of Orlando Letelier, a Chilean exile leader assassinated in Washington 14 years ago.

If You're Thinking of Living in: Palisades
LEAD: THERE is a magical quality about Palisades, a three-square-mile heavily wooded hamlet just 12 miles north of the George Washington Bridge.
Many of the houses have no numbers, just storybook names like Pirate's Lair, Captain John, Chateau Hash, Laundry, Ding Dong.
The telltale signs of modern development - condominiums, supermarkets, shopping centers and fast-food outlets - are conspicuous by their absence.


Released Harmed
LEAD: However bad the living conditions for most foreign hostages in Lebanon, Frank Herbert Reed said they were worse for him.

They light up a few corners of an otherwise dark picture, but they cover only Manhattan, only the upper end of the market and only a small fraction of the thousands of sales that are believed to be made in New York City each year.

A Guide to Cape Cod's Auctions
LEAD: Auctions on Cape Cod, a year-round phenomenon, are a cross between shopping, work and dinner theater.
In fact, they combine the best of all three: you can shop sitting down, play the commodities market with real commodities that you carry home in the trunk of your car, catch a comedy act without paying a cover charge and eat for under $5.


WHEN WILL THE BOOK BE DONE?
LEAD: The difficulties Susan Sheehan spoke of were not related to the actual craft of making a book.
She spoke only of externals in the author's life - a car accident and a lawsuit, in particular, that kept him from his writing table and delayed the process of completion.


WHY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW JUST ASK E.D. HIRSCH
LEAD: CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA., IS AN IDEAL SITE FORJU the study of American rhythms and continuities.
On the famous lawn of the University of Virginia is the cloister where Edgar Allan Poe had his quarters - commemorated today by a plaque reading domus parva magni poetae.
On a hill 10 miles away is Monticello, the exquisite home that Thomas Jefferson built for himself, with its slave quarters still visible (even more limited in space and comfort than Poe's), and another touching memorial, a stone obelisk at Jefferson's grave recalling his role as author of the Declaration of Independence and the


WHEN WILL THE BOOK BE DONE?
LEAD: As a writer, I am familiar with the stops and starts of bringing a project into the world: the expectations, the disappointments, the longing for the normalcy of a predictable job and the awareness, not always pleasant, that there is truly nothing else one can, or must, do (''When Will the Book Be Done?

Corrections
LEAD: The Practical Traveler column on April 29 misstated United Airlines' policy on exchanging a ticket when a lower fare for the same destination is advertised, based on information provided by the airline.
A ticket may be exchanged if the difference between fares is more than $25, the airline says, but all conditions for the new fare, including advance-purchase restrictions, must be met, and space must be available in the new booking class on the same flight.


From Comic Artist And Caricaturist, A Painter Evolves
LEAD: If there were a list of the top 10 artists on college dormitory walls, Lyonel Feininger would surely be on it.
His quietly dynamic paintings of new skyscrapers and old churches, old boats and new streets, composed of cubistic planes no thicker than glass or more solid than light but as hard as diamonds and fixed as keystones, have made him a dormitory star.


Fashion;   Half a Yard or So of Nylon and Spandex, and Voila!
LEAD: A swimsuit takes maybe half a yard of fabric, yet designers come up with a staggering array of new styles every year.
They cut them high or low, drape them and wrap them, try new fabrics and colors.
They want to appeal to different tastes, yes, but they must also take into account the variations in women's bodies.


Conville Cup Goes To Temple Again

Researching the Research
LEAD: The 1986 study was about immunology, but there has been no immunity from questioning the research that went into it.
A Congressional subcomittee, which has been looking into the integrity of federally financed research, has scheduled a hearing tomorrow to present what is said to be new evidence, obtained by the Secret Service, of irregularities in the data reported by a researcher involved in the study.


NEWS SUMMARY
LEAD:

PORTABLE PLAYERS REWARD THEIR FANS
LEAD: For 10 years, since Sony's first Walkman, it has been possible to put music in your pocket.
The artistic consequences of this magician's trick are uncertain for the long run, and one wonders what Beethoven would have thought of traipsing about with the ''Eroica.'' As an inveterate hiker, he might even have liked the idea.


Blending Sophisticated With Homey
LEAD: RESTAURANT name-droppers pepper their conversations with big-deal places sporting foreign names that begin with La, Le and Chez.
Although Barney's, with its home-grown moniker, may not make their list, it should be on yours.


World Markets;   The Latest Latin Gamble: Brazil
LEAD: Brazil is the newest high-risk gamble in Latin America's emerging stock markets.


The Executive Computer;   Where the Libraries Are Leading the Way
LEAD: Companies that are trying to figure out how they will manage the flow of information in the 1990's and beyond might begin their research with a trip to the library - not to take out a book but to study the ways in which libraries are preparing for the 21st century.
In the vanguard of information technology, today's librarians are as likely to be experts in work stations, networking, communications protocols, electronic imaging and fiber optics as they are in books and manuscripts.


Boston Ballet Opens a Door, Illuminating a Bygone Russia
LEAD: The Boston Ballet's new ''Swan Lake,'' staged by Konstantin Sergeyev and Natalya Dudinskaya of the Kirov Ballet and led for three weeks this month by mixed casts that pair Soviet stars with dancers from the Boston company, has inevitably attracted much attention.


Fashion: On the Street;   In for a Landing: Flights of Fancy
LEAD: Little things still mean a lot in fashion, especially if there are lots of them.
That might account for the attention that's being paid to accessories, pins in particular, which can set an outfit apart from all others.


Review/Music;   King's Singers From Britain
LEAD: The King's Singers, like their instrumental counterparts the Canadian Brass, ply the murky waters that lie between the high-minded in music and music that will sell.
It is not an easy job.
One noticed as much at Alice Tully Hall last Sunday night as these six British vocalists rowed arduously back and forth between Renaissance classics, obscure


NATURE WRITERS: A SPECIES UNTO THEMSELVES
LEAD: If extraterrestrials have ever visited our planet and decide to return, one of the best gifts they could bring is a home movie showing us in our infancy, as well as now-extinct animals and pristine landscapes.
Until that day, the best we can do is turn to nature writers to provide us with visions of bygone creatures, civilizations lost to history and unsullied landscapes.

Pastimes;   Stamps
LEAD: An ordinary stamp with an ordinary portrait issued by Liechtenstein in 1968 is a sort of modernist, self- referential item: The stamp honors a stamp collector.


Ginger in Western Cooking
LEAD: THE Chinese use fresh ginger in their cooking the way Westerners use salt and pepper.
But in recent years it has been showing up more and more in dishes that are not in the least Chinese.
Ginger adds a refreshing tartness to fish and chicken, perks up marinades, and is also good with vegetables such as mustard greens or broccoli rabe, adding a slightly sharp spicy taste that counteracts their bitterness.


Anita B. Elkind Is Married
LEAD: Anita B. Elkind, a daughter of Marilyn B. Elkind of Somers, N.Y., and Victor Elkind of La Jolla, Calif., was married last evening at Temple Emanu-El in Yonkers to Dr.

WHAT WOMEN WANT FROM FEMINISM
LEAD: Gornick's equation of a pro-legal abortion stand with feminism makes me believe she hasn't come as far as she thinks (''. . . when a black man was elected Governor of Virginia because he supported legal abortion, I thought who says we haven't made a revolution?'').


How Fashion Spreads Around the World At the Speed of Light
LEAD: WHEN Americans think of the apparel industry in the Far East, it is natural to think of dilapidated factories with rows of poorly paid workers sweating over antiquated machinery.


WHEN LEGAL TITANS CLASH
LEAD: As a 1973 graduate of the Harvard Law School who began her studies there 20 years ago - when the 7 percent admission for women was considered a radical new policy - I was both interested and dismayed by what Ken Emerson reports to be the state of legal education there (''When Legal Titans Clash,'' April 22).

LEAD: Recently, on ABC's ''Growing Pains,'' Mike (Kirk Cameron) got what he thought was his big break - a walk-on part in a TV series as a nameless cop dying of gunshot wounds.
Mike's sister, Carol (Tracey Gold), recognized the part for the inconsequential bit of body spasm it was and offered only the most measured of congratulations.


Family Life Enriched Through Fresh Air Fund
LEAD: VICKY CATRAMBONE often shared her parents with foster children while growing up in Greenwich.
Continuing the tradition each summer, she and her husband, Jimmy, and their three daughters share their two-story home and flower-bedecked backyard with a young guest from New York City.

Savannah's Leafy Green Squares

Catching Up With Change In Eastern Europe: First Steps and Second Thoughts
LEAD: THE transformation of Eastern Europe is moving off the streets and into the political chambers, but the speed of change is still dizzying.
As the emerging democracies seek their own identities, they are also trying to determine their places in a Europe whose Western powers are already faced with the challenges of creating a new community by 1992.


Question Of the Week;   Will Dent and Johnson Last The Season?
LEAD: Now that George Steinbrenner has said he will not interfere with Bucky Dent, rrBucky's gone, unfortunately.
Perhaps before this writing.


Abortion-Rights Advocate Views a Victory
LEAD: PATRICIA BAKER, the executive director of Planned Parenthood of Connecticut in New Haven, says that the broad support for the state's new abortion-rights law was built, in part, through a strong grass-roots effort by some 60 organizations in the state.
The law is seen by legal experts around the country as a milestone for of privacy rights, she said.

It is in central, not northern, Italy.


Greg Farrell's Contribution
LEAD: The Fund for the City of New York was the constructive outcome of a twinge of guilt.
In the late 1960's, the Ford Foundation moved into its handsome and lavish headquarters on East 42d Street.
Yet because the foundation is a charitable institution, it paid no city taxes on the building.


Hard Times For Romance
LEAD: To the Editor:


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Simon Jones, a British actor who lives in New York, has very definite views about the situation.
His summation is ''they pass through the door and become someone else.'' The door he's talking about is that of any number of (but certainly not all) upscale shops, boutiques and galleries, and 'they' are the sales personnel (but certainly not all) at these establishments.


Smothering Adelgids to Save the Hemlocks
LEAD: THE woolly adelgids are here - and they are eating Westchester's hemlocks.
To combat the creatures, the County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation is spraying dormant oil - considered to be safe for the environment, animals and humans - in seven county parks and properties.


Style Makers;   Toshio Goma, Kimono Designer
LEAD: ''Not too many people wear kimonos anymore,'' said Toshio Goma, a textile and kimono designer in Japan who has been trying to introduce the radiant colors of the traditional aristocratic kimono fabrics to American designers.

Preparations Before House Painting
LEAD: FOR exterior house paint to last as long as its manufacturer says it will, the surface to which the paint is applied must be carefully prepared.
This can be the most arduous and time-consuming part of painting.


Sometimes All of New York Seems a Vast, Endless Movie
LEAD: WHEN the Brooklyn pizza joint went up in flames ignited by racial friction in ''Do the Right Thing,'' did this mean movies are telling the world the wrong thing about New York?
When Popeye Doyle, pursuing a French connection, just missed the 42d Street shuttle in pursuit of a bad guy, did this mean that crime in New York waits on no man?


THE MIDI MENACE: MACHINE PERFECTION IS FAR FORM PERFECT
LEAD: It's everywhere - or getting there.
Canned music has escaped the home stereo to blare from concert stages.
Blame it on musicians' love of convenience, fear of mistakes or urge to modernize; blame it on the fact that audiences hear recorded music far more often than live music, and educate our ears accordingly.

Lodging a Complaint
LEAD: It appears that a Senate ethics committee investigation may hit Senator Dave Durenberger where he lives.

Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''This kind of economy can't work for man; it can only work for itself.
It produces more and more means of production, that is machines, equipment, electricity, fuel, metals in order to again use all this in the next cycle for still more production of nonconsumable goods.
That is, things that people can't eat.


Abortion Law: Vital Compromise
LEAD: POLITICS creates unusual alliances, as the passage of Connecticut's recently enacted abortion law shows.

Bible Tax Exemption Voided
LEAD: A Federal appeals court has unanimously struck down a 1939 North Carolina law that exempted Bibles from the state sales tax.
The United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, ruled Thursday that exempting the Bible, but not other literature, ''forces the state to discriminate on the basis of the contents of a book, text, or other published work, which is intolerable under the First Amendment.

University of New Mexico Press.
Cloth, $45. Paper, $24.95.


Corrections
LEAD: An article yesterday on a speech given by Mayor David N. Dinkins inaccurately described a comment he made about the killing of Yusuf K. Hawkins in Brooklyn.

WHEN LEGAL TITANS CLASH
LEAD: Your article suggests to me that the Harvard Law School may take itself a bit too seriously.
The chief architect of the law in the last decade is a man who never attended Harvard or any other law school, i.e.
Ronald Reagan.
It is temperament, not intellect, that largely determines legal decisions - a fact well illustrated by the schisms at Harvard itself.


Wheeling Out Iacocca For a Long-Shot Attack
LEAD: A DECADE after lurching to the brink of bankruptcy, the Chrysler Corporation is in trouble again, and again Chrysler has resorted to extreme measures.
But the company is not asking for a bailout.
It is simply bringing out Lee Iacocca.


WHEN WOMAN WANT FROM FEMINISM
LEAD: Looking at the feminists on your cover reminded me of an early 20th-century gathering of old bolsheviks, not because their philosophies are the same, but because I think one day these powerhouses, too, will be regarded with loathing.
Similarities?
Hearts in the right place and recognition of a need for change.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD: PARSONS' MILL, by Timothy Lewontin. (Plume, $8.95.) Seeking the ennobling virtues of hard work, an overeducated New Englander takes a job at a Vermont sawmill. ''A delightful, surprisingly absorbing account'' of his year as an apprentice sawyer, this book ''approaches the gung-ho participatory journalism that George Plimpton performed in his athletic days,'' Bill Kent said here last year.


Streetscapes: The Columbia Street Grain Elevator;   Recycling Red Hook's 1922 Magnificent Mistake
LEAD: ALTHOUGH vacant for a quarter of a century, the New York State Barge Canal Grain Elevator still dominates the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, its vast spread of concrete bins a ghostly silhouette.


Moist, Crusty Tenderloin Of Pork
LEAD: A crusty pork tenderloin is a better description of what some people might call a blackened tenderloin, successor to blackened red fish and blackened steak.
This method of applying dry spices to a food and then cooking it at such high heat that the kitchen fills with smoke has fortunately gone the way of most fads.

The Woman Joyce's Women Came From
LEAD: Julie Harris stands in a rehearsal hall dangling a book distastefully, as if it were an insect with 3 heads and 14 legs.

Aah, but that's literature.


Real Estate Slump Yields Fewer Agents
LEAD: CONNECTICUT'S housing slump is depressing not only prices but also the number of agents selling real estate these days.


Questionable Value Of Crisis Intervention
LEAD: The crisis interventionists who rebuked Howard Schneider (Opinion, ''How Best to Heal Psychic Wounds,'' April 22) for questioning the value of what they do seem to have an inflated opinion of themselves.

China's Shadow Falls Across Hong Kong's Films
LEAD: A few months after public protests here over the violent repression of democracy in Tiananmen Square, it's business as usual in Hong Kong.
After years in New York, a young Chinese remarked that his native city ''had become a gigantic shopping mall.'' The so-called Hong Kong dream, a vision of the good life parallel to the American Dream, however, shouldn't be reduced to pure mercantilism.


FURIOUS CYCLONE HAS INDIA REELING

Nantucket on My Mind
LEAD: The house my family has rented and lived in on Nantucket every summer since I was 3 years old was at one time, before the advent of the Coast Guard, a lifesaving station.

Pastimes;   Coins
LEAD: Christie, Manson and Woods Ltd. of London will auction a portion of a hoard of coins from the reigns of Henry I, Stephen and Henry II.

Also Ask Them About Profits
LEAD: To the Editor:


Leave the Stock Index Futures Alone

Not for Publication
LEAD: Jimmy Breslin could have used an editor.
Ten days ago, in the heat of outrage at the temerity of a young Korean-American colleague who criticized one of his Newsday columns as sexist - he joked about how his homelife had deteriorated since his wife was elected to the City Council - the 61-year-old journalist stormed about the newsroom loudly loosing racial and sexual epithets about the reporter, 25-year-old Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh.


Salvadoran Justice Wears Out Patience
LEAD: SALVADORAN soldiers may have hoped to rid themselves of meddlesome priests when they gunned down six Jesuits last November, along with their cook and her young daughter.
But the slain churchmen are proving to be more potent adversaries in death than they were in life.

It was impossible to watch her concert on Tuesday night at the Beacon Theater without thinking about the woman-hours behind the show, from grooming and fashion to music rehearsals to the practiced dances and hand gestures for every instant onstage.

Cote of Ligonier, Pa.
The Venerable Robert A. Bryan, an uncle of the bride, performed the ceremony.


Condos Surging As Resort Choice
LEAD: RENTALS of resort condominium are booming.
What is propelling them is the need of families with two or three children to economize on food by having some meals in and to get enough space while spending a week skiing or visiting Disney World.
Anyone who has crowded a family with two children into a motel room needs no hard sell to know why renting a place with two rooms for sleeping, two baths, two television sets and a kitchen is a step forward.


About Cars;   Escort Evolves Into Mainstay
LEAD: The 1991 model Ford Escort hatchbacks and station wagons are the most significant new cars from Ford Motor Company in at least two decades. -Thomas J. Wagner


HOT TEA WITH A WHISKY CHASER
LEAD: Beyond the want for a drink, solitude can be tricky to achieve in a Dublin pub, for even the urban Irish strive to live up to the national weakness for tending to the quiet stranger's soul.
If you want to join the flow, and sample a weave of rich conversation that literally goes back to such tough customers as Parnell and Michael Collins, the Bailey on Duke Street never seems to fail, except when the singing breaks out.


Victoriana Befits a Cottage Industrialist
LEAD: AS a college student in Philadelphia, she spent hours at a splattered easel, painting canvases with bold strokes of abstract design or delicate lines of portraiture.
As a married mother of three in Kentucky, she sketched patterns at the kitchen table in the evening and sold down comforters out of an old bakery during the day.


THE ATHENS STRUT, FROM RINGSIDE
LEAD: Greeks on the whole do not drink to drink but to see and be seen, and Kolonaki Square in downtown Athens is where it happens: any one of an array of sidewalk bars and cafes provides a suitably public setting for the macho strut and eye contact over the ouzo.


Higher Education Board Focuses on Campus Bias
LEAD: STATE higher education officials, complaining about a recent series of racial incidents on campuses, are calling for tougher sanctions against students who shout racial slurs or harass people in other ways.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: There are still some people around who truly believe that such words as ''dear'' and ''darling'' used in greetings and introductions indicate an intimate relationship, or at least a close friendship with the man or woman in question.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
What it actually indicates in most cases is that the greeter or introducer has totally forgotten your name.


2 Killed in Strife in Pakistan
LEAD: Militants set fire to a dozen shops and shot 2 people to death today, bringing to 21 the number of people killed in the last week in clashes between rival ethnic parties, the police said.
They said members of the Mohajir Quami Movement, a militant Indian immigrant party, and Sindhi nationalists demanding independence or greater autonomy were responsible for the violence.


No Headline
LEAD: The two most obvious facts of Hawaii are the huge sluttish pleasures of its Nipponized beachfront hotels and, in great contrast, its rugged landscape of craggy volcanoes and its coastal headlands, where lava has been pounded by heavy surf into black spikes.
Hawaii is smooth, but it can also be rough.


Q and A
LEAD:
Tax on Selling Fixtures
Question: After more than six years of litigation with the owners of the loft where we live, my husband and I are close to a settlement on the sale of the fixtures and improvements we've made over the years.

Pastimes;   Coins
LEAD: As prices rise for examples of the rarest United States coins - an Augustus Humbert $20-gold piece sold for $1.35 million last year - a United States silver dollar with a strange story is among the stars of high-priced coins.

Summer Squall Wins the Preakness


A FIVE-STAR VIEW FROM EVERY TABLE
LEAD: Hong Kong, Britain's rich capitalist colony that sits at the tip of mainland China, is a sparkling monument to hard work and high living.
And for a panoramic view of this restless, energetic entrepot, and a close-up look at the unabashed luxury for which it is famous, few places can rival the imposing Lobby Lounge in the five-star Regent Hotel.


Postings: Building in a Historic District;   11 Condo Rowhouses for Clinton Hill
LEAD: When historic district designation comes to a neighborhood, some developers run the other way in fear of the restrictions imposed by the protective recognition.

World Markets;   Vibrant Britain, Dull Platinum
LEAD: The London stock market has been buffeted in recent months by fears of recession, high interest rates, inflation, poll tax riots and the political troubles of the Thatcher Government.

DREAM BOATS
LEAD: There's a world of luxury afloat ot there, on the balmy seas of the Caribbean, the Mediterranean and the Polynesian pacific.
The water is calm, the sun is warm and islands beckon in the distance.
The conveyances are beautiful boats, some with teak decks and spanking white sails, some with powerful motors and streamlined chassis.


Legend of Stew Leonard's Adding a Danbury Chapter
LEAD: AS surely as God made Alar-free apples, newcomers to Fairfield County are asked, ''Have you been to Stew Leonard's yet?'' The reference is to the enormous gray barn of a food market covering 125,000 square feet on Route 1 in Norwalk.


Poland's 'Big Bang': Too Much Too Fast?
LEAD: I have just returned from Poland where I met with many of its leading economists and politicians.
From the vantage point of the United States, it may look like that country's commitment to a quick transition to a market economy, which some call the ''big bang,'' is universal.
But my discussion with economists and politicans in Warsaw, revealed that some

LEAD: Arie Luyendyk was jubilant, Al Unser Jr. was stunned and Emerson Fittipaldi remained on the pole for the Indianapolis 500 on May 27 after the first-round qualifications finally ended today.


Emotional Support and Cancer Recovery
LEAD: BECAUSE people who have undergone chemotherapy for cancer often feel isolated, one of the best ways friends or family members can show support is to encourage them to get back into the mainstream of life.
Despite the seriousness of their disease, people with cancer long to resume various interests and activities.

Tech Notes;   Cramming More on the Hard Disk

TAIWAN ANNOUNCES A DEMOCRACY STEP

LEAD: In the campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor of the most populous state, Attorney General John K. Van de Kamp of California is a politician of paradoxes.


Review/Music;   Ladysmith Black Mambazo With Oldies and Novelties
LEAD: For most of Ladysmith Black Mambazo's late set Tuesday night at S.O.B.'s, the 10-man chorus from South Africa seemed untouched by the last few years, when it was brought to worldwide attention after its appearance on Paul Simon's ''Graceland'' album.
The set included the first song written by the group's leader, Joseph Shabalala (in 1965), as well as songs from its new album, ''Two Worlds, One Heart'' (Warner Brothers).


Further Facts On Ducky the Swan
LEAD: No doubt Marilyn Forman is a well-meaning friend of animals, but her letter to the editor (April 15), the ''missing facts'' she purports to supply to my story about Ducky, the one-winged swan, are not all facts, but rather an attempt to justify her own actions.


Amenities No Longer Just a Seductive Option
LEAD: ''WE don't try to make money on amenities,'' said Eric Eicher, president of Sabal Park, a big office campus outside Tampa, Florida, ''but in the long run, they pay for themselves.''


All About/AM Radio;   Struggling Stations in Search of a Niche
LEAD: In April last year, Howard Goldsmith bought station WSBR-AM in Boca Raton, Fla.
Its ''oldies'' format had been losing money.
Because Boca Raton is popular with wealthy retirees, Mr.
Goldsmith immediately changed the station's format to all-business.
This year, he said, the station will make a profit.


WHY CAN'T YOU BEHAVE? A GUIDE TO BOOKS ON MANNERS
LEAD: I come from a funny family.
We have a lot of family jokes.
Most of them are purely silly, such as the name Treddy I. Biotical, which stemmed from a made-up disease, which in turn stemmed from something else too long and silly to explain.
But one of our jokes, initially, did not even remotely resemble a joke.


Wrong! Trade Deficits Do Matter
LEAD: To the Editor:


After 15 Years, a Kiss for Christopher Lloyd
LEAD: Christopher Lloyd, the wild-eyed character actor whose performances as the visionary time traveler Emmett Brown in the ''Back to the Future'' movies have won him the kind of attention usually reserved for leading men, has been making films for 15 years, since his first role as a member of the Asylum Ensemble in ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.


Review/Dance;   A Presentation of Concepts by David Parsons
LEAD: David Parsons is an intriguing performer with a stage presence that shifts tantalizingly between the diabolical and the angelic.
Like Paul Taylor, whose company he danced with, Mr.
Parsons has a big but lithe build and an extraordinary kind of grace.
He has an almost indolent authority in motion, so that what he does on stage seems less a matter of dancing than the expression of a privileged relationship with the floor and air.


Marketing the Modern Town House
LEAD: IN Woody Allen's ''Hannah and Her Sisters,'' David, a slick architect, squires Hannah's youngest sister, Holly, and her conniving best friend, April, around New York in his white Jaguar to look at buildings.
When they come to one of David's works, a Post-Modern town house of red granite, dark windows and steel tubing, April coos, ''It has an organic quality, almost entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean, but I can't put it into words.


'Tenured Radicals'
LEAD: To the Editor:


Can Politics Get to the Roots of Racial Strife?
LEAD: IF David N. Dinkins was judged more harshly than his white rivals in last year's New York City mayoral campaign, as he repeatedly complained, he also benefited from a double standard: Some voters hoped that the election of a black, particularly in a city of reverberating symbols, might ameliorate racial tensions.


The Kingdom of California Date Palms
LEAD: PROBABLY because our backyard in Arizona was overgrown with peaches, apricots, plums, pomegranates and grapes through most of my childhood, fresh fruit has never tasted like real food to me.
Nourishment was what came from the store in a brown bag.
Anything I could walk out the back door and pluck off a branch had no nutritional value.


Kristina Olin Married To Arthur J. Santry 3d
LEAD: Kristina Baker Olin and Arthur Joseph Santry 3d were married yesterday at the Homestead in Hot Springs, Va.
The Rev.
Kirk Ballin, a Unitarian minister, performed the ceremony.


Corporations Demand Flexibility in New Offices
LEAD: IN the six months since J. P. Morgan &amp; Company began moving into its new 47-story headquarters building at 60 Wall Street, its staff has continued a game of musical chairs that became routine during the 80's in the tumultuous world of investment banking, where multimillion dollar deals are struck in hours and new lines of business are established in days.

Clean Up New York, for Free
LEAD: More graffiti deface walls along the West Side Drive and elsewhere.
More trash fouls public space.
But city officials cry poor.
Cleaning up is labor-intensive, they say; New York can't afford more scrubbers, sweepers, collectors and baggers right now.
They're right about the lack of money, wrong about the lack of remedies.


Dr. Conzen Weds Dr. T. W. James
LEAD: Dr.
Suzanne D. Conzen, a daughter of Salome B. Conzen of New York and Willibald H. Conzen of Verona, N.J., was married yesterday to Dr.

Everybody Is a Winner At Peace Game Festival
LEAD: TWO years ago, when Francelia Butler thought of teaching conflict resolution through a Peace Games Festival, a lot of people were skeptical.
But on Wednesday, more than 1,000 students in grades 5 to 12 will attend such a festival, at the University of Connecticut's new sports arena, Gampel Pavilion, on the Storrs campus.

LEAD: October wedding plans for Lynn Anne Pantano and Stuart Charles Dale have been announced by the prospective bride's parents, Mrs.
Lester L. Coleman and Carl A. Pantano, both of New York.


On Screen They're a Brotherhood
LEAD: Michelle Pfeiffer slithered and sang on a piano and walked away with THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS (1989, I.V.E., $89.98), Steve Kloves's stylish first film, to be released this week.
But the movie owes a good share of its sophisticated charm to strong, generous performances by its male stars, updating a theme as old as Cain and Abel - only here it's nonviolent and has music.


Question Of the Week;   Do the Yankees Need Dave Winfield?
LEAD: Dave Winfield, like many other fading stars who refuse to accept a role-playing position, was upsetting the chemistry of the team.

Harassment of Woman Shakes Naval Academy
LEAD: A photograph shows a fully dressed young woman crouching near a urinal, her left wrist handcuffed to a pipe, while a group of young men look on.
There is a smile on her face.
The woman, 19-year-old Gwen Marie Dreyer, was a second-year midshipman at the United States Naval Academy here until she resigned last month.


HOLOCAUST MUSEUM: A TROUBLED START
LEAD: I am a first-generation American offspring of Holocaust survivors, and I don't want to see a Holocaust museum on the Mall in Washington (''Holocaust Museum: A Troubled Start,'' by Judith Miller, April 22).


Incumbency an Issue in Races for Congress
LEAD: LONG ISLAND Congressional races are shaping up this year not only as confrontations between Republicans and Democrats but also between what is being called a new alignment in American politics - incumbents and nonincumbents.


Question Of the Week;   Do the Yankees Need Dave Winfield?
LEAD: After signing a 10-year contract with the Yankees in 1981, Dave Winfield had a few productive and successful seasons.
He challenged the leaders in many statistical categories and was a fixture in the mediocre Yankee teams of the 1980's.


Rappleyea Won't Try For Gubernatorial Bid
LEAD: Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., the State Assembly minority leader, announced today that he would not seek the Republican nomination for governor.


HARVARD LAW SCHOOL

Biotechnology Benefits From Glasnost
LEAD: AFTER communicating by satellite for 18 months, two high school students - one on Long Island and the other in Moscow - are about to realize their dream of establishing a center for biotechnology education in Moscow.


WOULD SOME HELP BE SO BAD?
LEAD: People fall in love with music for different reasons and at different speeds.
Most gifted musicians find themselves ensnared willy-nilly, for better or worse, virtually from birth.
For some modestly talented listeners, the experience of being thrilled by a particular sequence of pitches and rhythms comes with telegraphic suddenness, often in adolescence.


Lynn J. Griffo Is Wed To Jay Mark Sackman
LEAD: Lynn Jennifer Griffo, a daughter of Betty A. Griffo of New City, N.Y., and Henry P. Griffo of Southampton, L.I., was married yesterday to Jay Mark Sackman, a son of Michael Sackman of Boca Raton, Fla., and the late Lulu R. Sackman.

Berlin
LEAD: To the Editor: In addition to the people mentioned by Judith Shulevitz as habitues of the Cafe des Westens in pre-World War I Berlin (Travel, Feb. 25), there comes to mind the English poet Rupert Brooke, who was quite aware of such Post Impressionists as Franz Marc, Kokoschka and Kandinsky.


Laura Gant Weds Peter Lilienfield
LEAD: Laura Ross Gant, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Donald R. Gant of New Vernon, N.J., was married yesterday to Peter Cahn Lilienfield, the son of Elizabeth C. Askow of Winnetka, Ill., and the late Edward W. Lilienfield.

J.
Calvin K. Jackson performed the ceremony at the Presbyterian Church of Basking Ridge, N


With 'Woman in Mind,' McCarter Bids a Farewell
LEAD: ALTHOUGH Alan Ayckbourn was called ''England's prolific present-day Bard'' upon the production of his 37th play last year - Shakespeare wrote 36 - it is as ''the English Neil Simon'' that his limited reputation in the commercial theater is still defined.
As catch phrases go, ''the comic laureate of Britain's middle class'' might be the handiest one for theatergoers who know more of Mr.


Review/Music;   Anniversary for Jubal Trio
LEAD: With the proliferation of chamber music in the United States in recent decades, all manner of oddly configured groups have arisen, often ephemerally.
A trio consisting of a soprano, a flutist and a harpist might seem at best a casual alignment, born for a single occasion and then evaporating like dew.


A KOREAN DEMAND UNSETTLES JAPAN
LEAD: Nearly a year and a half after ascending the Chrysanthemum Throne, Emperor Akihito has become entangled in an old dispute over Japan's responsibility for World War II reminiscent of the issues that many hoped had been buried with the death of Emperor Hirohito.


Question Of the Week;   Do the Yankees Need Dave Winfield?
LEAD: The Yankees needed Dave Winfield, but it's too late now.
I hope by this time, he's back to stardom and helping the Angels strive for the pennant.
Steinbrenner could never stand Winfield.
The athlete earned every penny of his salary by his playing accomplishments, but the owner never forgave him for outdoing him on the business transaction of his 10-year contract.


U.S. May Tell What It Paid for Noriega's Services
LEAD: Under the pressure of subpoenas, the United States Government is likely to disclose for the first time the amount of money it paid Gen.

Names in England, Names in New Jersey
LEAD: The interest in New Jersey place names (Letters to the New Jersey Editor, April 15) reminds me that several years ago I wrote to a gentleman in London asking if I could buy or exchange a book he had bought at auction that I wanted.
He responded that he did not approve of allowing British treasures to fall into the hands of foreigners.


AFTER OPULENCE, A NEW 'LITE' ARCHITECTURE
LEAD: This is not an age with any consensus about style: for all that certain ideologues may claim otherwise, the 90's are starting out to be as eclectic as the 80's.
There is still plenty of post-modernism, there is still plenty of late-modernism, and there is still every possible thing in between.
But one thing is coming to stand out, and it is less a style than a sense that architecture is going to be asking less of us, whatever form it takes.


Joanna Goldstein Wed To Peter Bruce Novins
LEAD: Joanna Goldstein, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Frederick A. Goldstein of Stamford, Conn., was married last evening to Peter Bruce Novins, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Rabbi Samuel Silver performed the ceremony at the Sheraton Stamford Hotel and Towers.


Awake on the Job
LEAD: Business has grown tremendously at the Sleep Disorders Center at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, which may help explain why the center's director, Dr.

Like other researchers in this growing field, Dr.

Fashion: On the Street;   For Spring, More and More, White Is Right
LEAD: It may still be spring, but the official color of summer is already in midseason.
That would be white, which on the milder days of the past few weeks burst forth in a profusion of outfits, most of them anchored by cotton, linen or tweed jackets.


State 'Guardian' of Arts Assumes National Endowment Role
LEAD: THE man who has been credited by the artistic community with helping to convert New Jersey from a cultural backwater into a thriving arts center in less than a decade has come to Washington to tackle an equally formidable task: defending the embattled National Endowment for the Arts.


Waking Up to the 80's in the 90's
LEAD: ''I have a feeling that the whole country slept through the 80's.
We were all nodding off in front of the TV.'' On a recent morning in his home in New York City's East Village, the composer Philip Glass seemed anything but sleepy.
Speaking briskly, he was describing the climate of ''do-nothing conservatism'' that, he said, caused him to create ''Hydrogen Jukebox,'' his new chamber opera based on poems by Allen


Review/Dance;   City Ballet in a Diversity of Concertos
LEAD: The program of works by George Balanchine that the New York City Ballet offered Thursday night at the New York State Theater came close to being an all-concerto night.
Of the four items, only ''The Steadfast Tin Soldier'' was not set to a concerto.
Fortunately, the ballets were so varied that the evening never grew musically or choreographically monotonous.


Pay for Play
LEAD: If John Cullerton and a majority of his colleagues have their way, it won't be long before college athletes in Illinois begin drawing salaries and enjoying due-process civil rights protection in investigations by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.


Thirty-Eight Texas Counties Declared Disaster Areas


HOLOCAUST MUSEUM: A TROUBLED START
LEAD: As a former concentration-camp inmate, I agree with Lucy S. Dawidowicz that the memorial should be one of ''compelling austerity.'' I would urge those in charge to show their respect to those who perished by using as examples such memorials as Yad Vashem in Israel, the Memorial of the Unknown Jewish Martyr in Paris and the Vietnam Memorial in Washington.


CHARTERING YOUR DREAM BOAT
LEAD: For American yachting enthusiasts, the Caribbean is still the most popular destination, particularly the Virgin Islands, the Grenadines and, for those hearty sailors eager for lots of sea, the stretch between Anguilla and St.
Lucia.
The ideal way to travel these waters is in a chartered boat, since there is a large selection available year round.


The Downfall of Drexel Weakens a Soft Market
LEAD: IN just a few words - ''Here are the keys'' - the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert let its landlord know that it would no longer be needing 108,000 square feet of space in the Fulton Landing development on the Brooklyn waterfront.


Rousing a Sleeping Industrial Giant
LEAD: Not long after he became president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries last year, Kentaro Aikawa took a tour of the company's sprawling aerospace works here.
Mr.
Aikawa spent most of his career as a shipbuilder and turbine engineer for the company in Nagasaki, so he was something of a stranger to the rows of F-15 fighters, Boeing 767 fuselages and Japanese rockets under construction.


In the End, It Was Dent Who Set Winfield Trade in Motion
LEAD: When Bucky Dent played for the Yankees in the turbulent days that gave birth to baseball's Bronx Zoo, he studiously avoided involvement in the mad, mad world of George and Billy and Reggie.
Ron Guidry, Willie Randolph and Dent were the best at remaining quiet and aloof from the daily turmoil.


Lawns Need Fertilizer, but Not Too Much
LEAD: THE more you feed, the more you mow.
This is an unwritten law that home gardeners are finding to be true.
Sometimes they forget what fertilizer applications will do to their turf and feed generously in early spring.
They reason, after all, that it has been a long winter and the grass needs a boost.


Ann Pasquale Is Married to Dr. Joseph Haddad Jr.
LEAD: Ann Pasquale and Dr.
Joseph Haddad Jr. were married yesterday at St.
Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn.

YOUNG, GIFTED AND COOL
LEAD: IT'S 3:30 IN THE MORNING AT BRADLEY'S, THE GREENWICH Village restaurant and jazz club.
The dark, oak-paneled room is filled, mostly with young musicians who have dropped in after their jobs.
The pianist John Hicks and the bassist Walter Booker, both well-known veterans of the New York club scene, are laying down a surging rhythm under the trumpet of Roy Hargrove, which is tearing its way through an up-tempo blues.


Pastimes;   Stamps
LEAD: An important focus of do-it-yourself stamp collecting is the maximum card, which straddles the intersection of philately and deltiology - the study of postcards.


A Changing World
LEAD: These are dark days for the boys of Bensonhurst.
Their world is fading as fast as the summer sun over the city some of their fathers and grandfathers helped build.
They are angry the way people are angry when they see a sure thing slipping through their fingers.

LEAD: American and Soviet officials announced major progress today toward a treaty reducing long-range nuclear weapons.
They also said they had concluded an agreement to end their chemical-weapons production and sharply reduce their chemical stocks.


THE TANGY FLAVORS OF MARSEILLES
LEAD: When I visit Marseilles it is for a cure de poisson, for the city is a fish lover's paradise unequaled in France.
At the tip of the Vieux Port, along the weather-beaten Quai des Belges, the city awakens to the familiar cries of the fishmonger.
It's a rough and ancient symphony as fishermen, their wives and their children, begin to set out the daily catch.

THE ECONOMY
LEAD:
Dealing With the Deficit - Sort Of
If the suit doesn't fit, why lose weight when you can let out the pants instead?

Duty-Free Shops
LEAD: To the Editor: To change from a 750 milliliter bottle to a one liter bottle, as you tried to do in the chart accompanying the article on duty-free shops, you must add one-third of the former, not the 25 percent or one-fourth that you reported.
Properly scaling the price to one liter gives $38.40.
To reach the $36 for a bottle of liqueur in midtown Manhattan by adding the 25 percent listed in the footnote to the table, the 750 milliliter would have cost $28.80.

LEAD: The site of the New York World's Fair, internationally famous for its 1939-40 ''World of Tomorrow'' exhibit, is less well known for an equally fascinating 1965 display of what may be the world's largest scale model - 9,335 square feet depicting almost every building in New York City.
This mammoth model, containing 865,000 tiny structures built to a scale of 1 inch to 100 feet, has been updated for the first time in 16 years with 125 scale models representing major projects that have gone up since 1974, such as Battery Park

A Newly Acquired Collection, and More, at New Britain
LEAD: A BEQUEST, a show by sisters who never made it but should have and a solo by Italo Scanga: all at the New Britain Museum of American Art, it is a mix to give viewers pause.

LEAD: Talk to Phil Jackson about Michael Jordan's staggering scoring numbers this season, and the Chicago Bulls' coach says, ''That's our Michael.''


Unwelcome, Partner
LEAD: Last week, Ann B. Hopkins was celebrating, smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, making jokes and otherwise acting thick-skinned, the way she has through seven years of litigation over her right to be a partner in a big accounting firm.
It was just that unfeminine posture that had led the firm to reject her, a Federal judge had found, and because of that the firm would have to take her back.


Miss Farber Wed To Peter Cheston
LEAD: Allison B. Farber, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Paul L. Farber of New York, and Peter C. Cheston, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

Evening Hours;   At a Round of Benefits, Aristocrats All

In truth, the identity confusion and general anxiety stirred by the reunion seem to have the more disorienting effect on the generation of Hamelin that lost its innocence during the Vietnam

THE IRAN-CONTRA COMMITTEES
LEAD: The trauma of Watergate seems to have left Congress determined to avoid the impeachment process again, at all costs.

IT'S A DIFFERENT SHOW WHEN DANCE TAKES THE LEAD
LEAD: Dancing came of age on Broadway in ''A Chorus Line,'' in 1975.
It wasn't just the choreography, fluid and expressive though the dances of Michael Bennett and Bob Avian were.

FEMINISM AND THERAPY
LEAD: I worry that Vivian Gornick's therapeutic metaphor may reflect some subtle despondency about the times, in contrast to her more stirring message of optimism (''Who Says We Haven't Made a Revolution?'' April 15).

Lawns Need Fertilizer, but Not Too Much
LEAD: THE more you feed, the more you mow.

LEAD: One day I was playing a round of golf with my friend Miles Jaffee, an excellent sailor, skier and tennis player who never bothered to master the art of batting balls through pastures.
After one particularly bad shot, Miles picked up the ball and threw it toward the hole.
His eyes lit up; the thrill of invention was about to replace the agony of defeat.

Bali's Dyed Gringsing Cloth, a 7-Year Wonder
LEAD: IN the pantheon of things black and white and red all over, the Balinese textile called gringsing must certainly be the most obscure.

New Germany; Old Fears
LEAD: By formal agreement concluded Friday, the two Germanys will become one on July 1, barely eight months after the wall's fall.

RUNNING AWAY TO SEA, THE FREIGHTER WAY
LEAD: When you announce to your loved ones that you are hopping a freighter to South America and will be gone for two months and they bid you fond farewell on the eve of your departure, why are you seen skulking around town a week later?
Because just as time and tide wait for no man, freighters don't depart for a ready woman.

For Some Authors, Book Publishers Pay Millions Without a Word
LEAD: NOT so long ago, an author wrote a novel and a publisher paid for it.
Today, in the quest for big-name authors and bigger profits, the order has reversed.
Publishers are now increasingly using multimillion-dollar advances to woo best-selling novelists into signing contracts, sometimes without even a glimmer of what they will be writing about.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Postings: For 28 Eligible Buyers;   Keeping Costs Down
LEAD: Alarmed that housing costs in Suffolk County were driving moderate-income families away, officials in the Town of Southold adopted a new zoning policy in 1986 aimed at cutting the cost of new homes.
It is finally paying off: Ground was broken this month for a project offering eligible families 28 half-acre homesites in Southold Village for $30,000 each.

LEAD: To the Editor: Publishing Deborah Blumenthal's article (Travel, March 11) urging consumers to compare prices at airport duty-free shops is a real public service, as my experience proved.


Plenty Is New Under the Sun At Cannes?
LEAD: No one could have predicted that a world-famous star of westerns and police action films would make his first screen appearance here dressed in pink coat, high boots and riding breeches, a country gentleman ready for the fox hunt.

LEAD: Albert A. Grobe, who retired in 1973 as chief announcer of WQXR, the radio station of The New York Times, after more than three decades with the station, died yesterday at White Plains Hospital after a long illness.
He was 81 years old and lived in White Plains.


FEMINISM AND THERAPY
LEAD: As a wife, mother, professional nurse and teacher, I say it's time the women's movement supported the importance of the work of women like me.
Instead, many feminists of this revolution have tried to persuade me and my peers to abandon our ''women's work.'' As a result, the exhilaration I felt in my 1970's consciousness-raising groups has turned to ashes.

LEAD: IT'S not just a hit. It's more like a home run.


A Moment for Dusting Off Faded Reputations;
LEAD: Judging by the current spate of exhibitions devoted to the images of little known or long forgotten photographers, one might think that the world was running out of photographs.
But since photography is by nature a prolific medium, and practically anyone can take a picture, some less obvious possibility than a paucity of pictures must be at play.


Question Of the Week;   Do the Yankees Need Dave Winfield?
LEAD: The Yankees definitely need Dave Winfield.
He has had an extremely consistent career in the field and with the bat.
His value has somewhat declined because of his injury, but consistency is something the Yankees need especially since their front office contributes to the team's unsettledness.
Winfield had the ability to help the Yankees in turbulent times if he had been given the chance to play out of his current slump.

Byte-Sized, but Big
LEAD: THE MONITOR (RIGHT) IS 14 feet high.
The keyboard (above) is 25 feet long.
The floppy disk is six feet on a side.
In an era in which the desktop computer stands as a monument to miniaturization, the walk-through computer exhibit being installed at the Computer Museum in Boston is iconoclastic in its dimensions, if more conventionally educational in its purpose.

On Language;   Bogie, Anyone?
LEAD: THE DEVIL, LONG lingering in the details of language, now stalks the corridors of the Pentagon.


Lawns Need Fertilizer, but Not Too Much
LEAD: THE more you feed, the more you mow.
This is an unwritten law that home gardeners are finding to be true.
Sometimes they forget what fertilizer applications will do to their turf and feed generously in early spring.
They reason, after all, that it has been a long winter and the grass needs a boost.


Review/Theater;   Culture Shock in Hwang's 'F.O.B.'
LEAD: At the end of the first act of David Henry Hwang's ''F.O.B.,'' there is a mirthful eating scene that summarizes the conflict between an American-born young man of Chinese descent and a newly landed immigrant, fresh off the boat (F.O.B.) from China.
The newcomer, played by Dennis Dun, pours a jar of fiery hot sauce over his dinner and eats it as if it were the most savory of delights.


'Tenured Radicals'
LEAD: To the Editor:


Currency;   Ending the Week on an Up Note
LEAD: It was an up week, but just a little, for the dollar.
After falling against the Japanese yen in the beginning of the week, the dollar inched back Thursday and Friday.
It also rose those two days against other major currencies, except for the British pound.
It is not clear if the rally is just a correction after the sharp drop of the week before or rather the start of a new trend.


Out of The Kitchen
LEAD: One person's idea of drudgery is another's inspiration.
Considert his: Many people think that kitchen chores - like cooking and cleaning up - are menial, even demeaning duties, and that aprons are what you wwear to do them in.
But then there are those for whom cooking cloths and clothes kindle deliciously romantic visions of picnics on the grass, barbecues int he backyard or creative repasts stirred up in a kitchen fit for a gourmet.


Summer Squall Wins Preakness
LEAD: Summer Squall avenged his Kentucky Derby loss to Unbridled by scoring a 2 1/4-length victory in the Preakness Stakes today at Pimlico, but there will be no rubber match between the colts in the final leg of the Triple Crown.

'Lear' Girds for a Remarkable Episode
LEAD: The P. T. Barnum of the avant-garde, Robert Wilson began his career in theater in the late 60's with a war on language.
In silent epics like ''Deathman Glance'' he ignored it.

Now this sworn enemy of speech is rehearsing Shakespeare's ''King Lear,'' one of the greatest arrays of words we have.

Soul-Soothing Ride
LEAD: I HAVE had occasion to ride along the Ocean Parkway from Meadowbrook to Captree almost every week in the last few months.
This is a ride I always enjoy, both as a driver and as a passenger.
It soothes and pacifies to see the sky meet the ocean and the bay.
The variety of colors and shapes, the chance of seeing wildlife, the absence of commercialism and the absence of people are among the attractions.


Hockey Award
LEAD: He has won more games than any other American college hockey coach and now Len Ceglarski, who has a record of 632-309-35 in his 32 years at Clarkson College and Boston College, is getting some recognition.
He will receive the 1990 Lester Patrick Award for service to United States hockey. . . .
Joe Theismann, the former Notre Dame and Washington Redskins quarterback, has been inducted into the GTE Academic All-America Hall of Fame along with Jamaal Wilkes, the former U.C.L.A.

HARVARD LAW SCHOOL

IT'S GETTING LATE: WHERE IS YOUR SUMMER READING LIST?
LEAD: For those of us spending the summer at home, the public library has become a kind of clubhouse.
We 12-year-olds haunt the corridors, carrying staggering armloads of books, acknowledging one another grimly as we pass.
The building has no air conditioner, and we are sweating under our labors, but somehow we feel purposeful here in this small suburban branch library, where the children's librarian occasionally looks up at us from her heat stupor, nodding in approval.


A Sense of Discovery in Landscapes
LEAD: WHAT was previously the Squibb Gallery has become the Gallery at Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Titles must expand along with capitalism, it seems.
Still, there is much to be grateful for: this could have been the Gallery at Bristol-Myers Beech-Nut Life Savers Squibb if the pharmaceutical company had not sold its gum and candy interests, in 1981.


What We See When We Cut To the Videotape
LEAD: The advent of the readily portable video camera and the extraordinary popularity of the new ABC television program, ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' combine to raise the question: what is happening to the ways we perceive the world as we move in and through it?

BOMBAY: OLD AND NEW GATEWAY TO INDIA
LEAD:
By Pa and Ma I'm daily told
To marry now's my time,
For though I'm very far from old,
I'm rather in my prime.

We ought to make our hay -
And India has so hot a one,
I'm going to Bombay!

A TEXAS PORT FAR FROM THE SEA
LEAD: Think of certain cities and you see the flash and shapely flow of water.
No one would have trouble identifying them solely by the configuration of buildings on the banks of their rivers - the Thames, the Seine, the Danube, the Charles, the Hudson and, recently made familiar to us, the Vltava (crossed magnificently by Prague's Charles Bridge, where until last year defiant young folk singers purveyed forbidden

European Opportunities Beckoning Developers

Now, with an ambitious plan to lift bureaucratic, legal and trade barriers among the 12 countries of the European Economic Community inching toward a 1992 start, and the political thaw in the Eastern Bloc raising hopes for an economic rejuvenation in those countries, many American real estate entreprenuers are looking to

Pastimes;   Around the Garden
LEAD: For This Week: Now that the weather has settled down, everything can go into the ground, especially seedlings of tomatoes, peppers and eggplants; if the ground is truly warm, bean and corn seed can be planted, but if the ground is too cold, these crops will rot in the ground; wait.

LEAD: In art as in stocks, the action is in the quality end of the spectrum, but the rest of the market seems to be alive as well.


Lawns Need Fertilizer, but Not Too Much
LEAD: THE more you feed, the more you mow.
This is an unwritten law that home gardeners are finding to be true.
Sometimes they forget what fertilizer applications will do to their turf and feed generously in early spring.
They reason, after all, that it has been a long winter and the grass needs a boost.


CORAL REEF ON THE SAIGON RIVER
LEAD: For those Americans of a certain generation, and for anyone who's decided that travel, let alone life, isn't quite as exotic as it used to be, Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) can still exert a powerful tug.


The Minority Community's Shopping-Mall Hard Sell
LEAD: For some time now, business has been bleak at the Radiance Boutique.
And it's starting to wear on owner Ruby Golden, who for 18 years made a good living in the competitive world of retailing. ''I'm not doing well at all.
I hate you to print that.
But it's the truth,'' Ms.
Golden said. ''And I'm not doing well because there aren't enough stores here.


A New Career
LEAD: For someone who won 8,833 races and $123 million in purses in a 40-year career as a jockey, Bill Shoemaker seemed surprisingly nervous before the fifth race at Hollywood Park on Friday.

POLITICS AT THE CLUB TOMAJ
LEAD: ON APRIL 8, I PUT IN A CALL TO BUDAPEST and got the news: the Alliance of Free Democrats had finished second in Hungary's parliamentary elections.

For the last six months I had helped advise that lively, upstart party of former dissidents through Hungary's first free election campaign in 43 years.


Art Appreciator
LEAD: Sagging art market?
Not when Ryoei Saito is around.

Last Tango in Tangier
LEAD: ANOTHER ROSY DUSK SETTLES OVER THE SET IN Tangier, and Bernardo Bertolucci is up to his usual tricks.
In the glow of the ancient chalky walls, under a giant eucalyptus tree, a man and woman bend close, so absorbed in each other they seem unaware of the movie crew preparing to capture a scene before darkness swallows the moment.


Gun-Control Groups Adjust Their Aim
LEAD: THE national gun-control lobby regards New Jersey's tough ban on assault weapons, which was approved last week, as another sign of the mounting momentum for a variety of firearms controls in legislatures across the country.

Winfield vs. the Yankees: A Case of Life and Law
LEAD: Should it matter to us where a talented and rich and aging baseball player plies his trade?
Should it matter whether a rich and controversial owner is leveling with the public when he says he opposed the player's trade despite a decade of rancorous disputes with that player?
Should it matter whether the owner's aide insulted the player or merely showed insensitivity typical of employers who are ditching a once-valued employee?

An Easy Mark To Pickpockets Of 3 Continents
LEAD: MY husband has had his wallet stolen or rifled four times on three continents, making him a world expert of a sort.

What's There to Do? Go to the Mall
LEAD: THE day began with worthy intentions.
Wanting to get away for a few hours, my wife suggested, ''Let's head over to Stroudsburg and look around.'' On this dreary day, gray and chilly enough to inhibit outside activity, yet not really nippy enough to make cold-weather options attractive, the prospect of spending our weekday off uncovering a neat little museum or bistro across the Delaware held some appeal.

Easy Rambles in South Germany
LEAD: THE hills and valleys of southwestern Germany offer rustic, gentle scenery to soothe a traveler weary from the sight of too many half-timbered houses with window boxes of geraniums.
Here, away from the crowded streets of the area's medieval towns, footpaths slope through hills of pines and through orchards where horses crop the grass under gnarled fruit trees.


HIS HEAD IN THE STARS
LEAD: FOR ALL OUR EXPLORING, SPACE IS STILL A MYSTERY; one tiny, pockmarked moon, after all, is as far as we've set foot.
Perhaps that is why we demand more than just dry data from those assigned to study the planets and peer beyond the Milky Way.
A space scientist has to be a visionary, a poet in a white lab coat who can give voice to our collective craving for adventure, our fascination with a universe we have not been able to touch.

On a clear day we should have seen a succession of nubby peaks - Bowness Knott, Starling Dodd, High Stile - but the clouds lay about them like an old feather bed.
We ate our lunch leaning against a stone fence at the end of the water, just where the woods began.

TALES OF AN ITALIAN ANCHORAGE
LEAD: In the crowded months of July and August, sailing yachts at Porto Ercole's small public quay (no dock fee, but little fresh water) are tied up eight-in-line, rather the way souvenir Indian elephants are linked, an arrangement that encourages new friendships and a lazy reluctance to put out to sea.


Answering the Mail

Is there some solvent or liquid I can add now that will liquefy the paint and make it useable again?


UP THE BLACK SEA TO BYZANTIUM
LEAD: I sailed to the haunted kingdom of Trebizond from Istanbul, north through the Bosporus and then east along the coast of the Black Sea.
It had been the route of Jason and the Argonauts when the land at the eastern end of the sea at the foot of the Caucasus was called Colchis.
Now it is the way the car ferry of the Turkish Maritime Lines sails to the Turkish city of Trabzon, once known as


MIXING WITH THE NEW HOLLYWOOD
LEAD: Unlike most cities, Los Angeles does little to encourage the unexpected chance encounter.
Geography and traffic work against ordinary social interaction.
And so the notion of the gathering spot, the watering hole, is almost unknown in a city where meeting a friend for drinks often begins with a 45-minute drive and ends with an $18 parking ticket.

Data Bank/May 20, 1990


HOLOCAUST MUSEUM: A TROUBLED START
LEAD: As to Henry Kissinger's fear that a national Holocaust museum might constitute ''too high a profile'' for American Jews, I say we must remember that the lessons to be learned from Hitler's reign of terror are not about guilt or apology or remorse but about understanding that this must never again happen to any group of people anywhere, ever.


Review/Music;   Bang on a Can Festival Ends With a Weekend of Browsing
LEAD: The word ''supermarket'' seems an ugly one to place next to the performing arts, but it can be applied admiringly to the finale of the Bang on a Can Festival.
A series of new-music events that began on May 4 at the RAPP Arts Center in the East Village ended with four concerts last Sunday that in essence ran one into the next.


HARVARD LAW SCHOOL
LEAD: It seems ironic that Dean Robert C. Clark, who ''deplored contemporary students' ignorance 'of how one goes about proving something,' '' should use obfuscating language himself in trying to justify corporate law as a career choice. ''Corporate law,'' he says, ''is intensely moral, you know.'' The challenge of it, he says, is ''to devise optimal controls on managerial discretion.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Was This Exhibition Necessary?
LEAD: What must be conceded about ''The Passionate Eye: Impressionist and Other Master Paintings From the E. G. Buhrle Collection,'' at the National Gallery of Art through July 15, is that it includes 85 works of quality and consistency.


Streetscapes: Hampshire House;   A Case of 'Frenzied Financing'
LEAD: THE softening of the real estate market after a decade of dizzying growth has changed the plans and prospects of developers, businesses, institutions and even governments.

Hiking With History in the Pyrenees
LEAD: IN 1700, Louis XIV of France observed his grandson's accession to the Spanish throne with satisfaction: ''the Pyrenees have ceased to exist,'' he boasted.
Luckily for those who crave the satisfactions of great massifs, the Sun King's edict left undisturbed this soaring frontier dividing France from the Iberian peninsula.

LEAD: The Justice Department has reached agreement with East Germany for access to that country's World War II archives, a move that investigators say could result in important new prosecutions of Nazi war criminals living in the United States.

METAL WORK ROOTED IN THE LAST CENTURY - AND MILLENNIUM
LEAD: English and American examples of the turn-of-the-century Arts and Crafts style have rarely been exhibited together since the style was revived in the late 1960's, even though the movement in this country grew out of William Morris's antimachine proselytizing in mid-19th-century England.


Walla Walla: Bigger, Bigger
LEAD: A little over a century ago, according to a favored and probably apocryphal story here, the territorial government gave the citizens of this city a choice between a new college and a prison.
They chose the prison because they didn't like the kind of people attracted to a college.


Fresh Air Fund Introduces Itself to Children

Teetering on the High Wire in Brazil
LEAD: Two months after taking office, President Fernando Collor de Mello is fast approaching the moment of truth for his plan to integrate Brazil into the world economy.


Faded Glory of Syracuse
LEAD: ONE can never be sure how people will react to Syracuse, a city that appears hesitant, uncertain of its magnitude and its identity, belonging neither with the big Sicilian ports of Palermo, Catania and Messina nor with the smaller and sleepier provincial capitals like Agrigento and Enna.
Some visitors to Syracuse are fascinated by the evocative atmosphere of faded glory in what was once the greatest and perhaps most beautiful of the Greek cities in the western Mediterranean.


Not So Far
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


After 22 Years, Teacher Faces Layoff
LEAD: IN a sunlit basement studio at Kings Highway Elementary School in Westport, Karen Ernst, an art teacher, asked a group of third graders to write about the ways art has touched their lives.

WHY IT TOOK SO LONG
LEAD: I was working as a newspaperman when I was drafted into the Army during the Korean War, and I decided to write a continuing column about it for my paper called This New Army, which was what everybody was calling that same old Army in those days.
I wrote about how unbelievably stupid sergeants and corporals were, how unspeakably dreadful Army food was and how very peculiarly the general behaved when he noticed

Where other mice are collecting food, Frederick is off by himself, gathering, he says, ''sunshine,'' ''colors'' and ''words.'' Come winter, the odd-mouse-out nests with his brethren, sharing their supplies and, when they look to him for a contribution, he has only his food for the soul to offer.

When I was small, I would go with my favorite aunt and uncle and a cousin just my age to drive-in horror movies every week.

HONG KONG'S BOUNDLESS OPTIMISM

Graziano: Champion for Life's Underdogs

New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Even if you are, as Sue Wartur put it, ''something of a sailor,'' how long do you keep the sail from your first little sailboat?

The Next Best Thing To Two on the Aisle

A Call for Data On Auto Insurance
LEAD: In a letter to the New Jersey editor on April 22, John A. Karanik laid most of the blame for high auto insurance premiums in New Jersey on automobile design, the high incidence of auto theft and the New Jersey driver.
Despite the fact that costs from these sources would primarily fall under comprehensive and collision portions of auto policies (which many motorists have dropped because of the high cost of the legally required liability portion), most insurance industry apologists wheel out these tired arguments.

The Editorial Notebook;   The Errors of Nazi Science
LEAD: Can data obtained by unethical means be permitted in science?
