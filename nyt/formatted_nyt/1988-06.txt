Ennui In 'South Of Reno'
''South of Reno'' was written and directed by Mark Rezyka, whose previous experience has been in making music videos, most of them for heavy-metal bands.
According to the production notes, Mr.
Rezyka came up with the idea for this change of pace when someone asked him to think up a 30-minute story.
In its finished form, his film has even less plot than that, but it has been stretched to a running time of an hour and a half by means of pregnant pauses, slow pans of the desert horizon and scenes in which the film's hero, Martin Clark (Jeffrey Osterhage), sits staring at a television set that gets very bad reception.
Even so, these garbled glimpses of ''Jeopardy'' and old movies are a lot more interesting than anything that happens to Martin in real life.

Review/Film; Tom Hanks as a 13-Year-Old, in 'Big'
LEAD: When Henry Ford developed his Model T in 1903, there were Pierce, Packard, Stanley and various other cars already on the market, which only goes to show how little being first has to do with popular success.

The leaders made slight progress toward a treaty on strategic arms, and seemed to accomplish little on regional conflicts and human rights.

It's Baby-Selling, and It's Wrong
LEAD: Is the hiring of a woman to bear a child for one who is infertile protected by some fundamental right to reproduce?
Or is it a noxious form of commerce?
The New York State Task Force on Life and the Law offers all states a clear, convincing answer: Such a practice is baby-selling, and it's wrong.


A MOCK TRIAL OF KURT WALDHEIM PROVES ELECTRIFYING
LEAD: The cries of ''trail by television'' have already been sounded.
But they are not persuasive in the case of ''Waldheim: A Commission of Inquiry,'' which can be seen tonight from 8 to 11:30 on the pay-cable service Home Box Office.
This is an extraordinary project in several respects, not least because it so carefully avoids even a hint of the sensationalism or exploitation that can be found in so many other television excursions into nonfiction.


The Uses of summitry

Yes, There Are Summer Risotto Dishes
LEAD: I USUALLY think of risotto as a cold-weather dish.
The hearty, stick-to-the ribs nature of a plate of rice cooked so the texture retains a hint of resistance to the bite and the grains are bound with a creaminess that is not quite a sauce is delicious sustenance.
It is not light summertime fare.

LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  CELEBRATING POETRY  If you've got it, why not flaunt it?
Exactly.
So since Long Island can claim Walt Whitman as a native son, and his birthplace in Huntington Station as a national historic site and shrine, it figures that poetry has to play some role in the cultural life of the Island.
It does, and today's the day for a Summer Celebration of Poetry.

Combining Safety And Cycling
LEAD: The concept of rolling on two wheels through the Connecticut countryside as depicted on the front page on May 8 (''Company for the Long-Distance Rider'') is a promise of pleasurable, healthy fun.

A Season for Eastern Sissy Playwrights
LEAD: In the Hollywood lexicon of David Mamet's play ''Speed-the-Plow,'' film producers are ''whores,'' but even movie-industry whores must feel superior to someone.
To Mr.

CORRECTION
LEAD: A story in the Arts and Leisure section of May 29 about Thomas Krens, the newly appointed director of the Guggenheim Museum, gave an incorrect title for an exhibition being organized by Mr.

Orioles Rally in 14th With 3 Runs on Error
LEAD: On a nearly interminable night filled with silliness and indignity, the Yankees, who had their bats confiscated and a couple of beers dumped on them, managed to cap it in suitably unbecoming fashion.
They blew a two-run lead in the bottom of the 14th to lose to the Orioles, 7-6.


NATIONAL GRIDLOCK
LEAD: James Gleick's account of research dealing with traffic jams is fascinating and encouraging.

A Wave of Start-Ups on Madison Avenue
LEAD: IN the shadow of advertising giants like the JWT Group, Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. and the Ogilvy Group, there is a group of fledgling advertising agencies with far less familiar names.

Casting Aside All Cares: Fishing in Montana
LEAD: JUST north of the hamlet of Wolf Creek, Mont., the Missouri River moves slowly.
It oxbows on its course like a moving snake, winding its way alternately through steep-walled canyons and past open fields where sprinklers mounted on wheels arc water over lush fields of alfalfa, and small rainbows hover in the mist above each sprinkler head.


How America Voted: Early and Often, and Mostly by the Old Rules
LEAD: THE long, long, long Presidential nominating season essentially ends this week - not with a bang, not with a whimper, perhaps with a sigh of relief.

Florida: Following Tamiami Trail across the Everglades
LEAD: Some motorists find driving across the Everglades in south Florida as boring as cutting through the unbroken wheat fields of Kansas.

A Feast Day Of Roast Corn Up in Michigan
LEAD: MOST days, the folks who turn off U.S.
Route 2 toward the tiny town of Cooks in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan live there or near there, or have family or friends who do.
But one day a year, Cooks gets actual tourists, like my parents and me (they, from Florida, summering near Sault Ste. Marie, a couple of hours farther along; I, from New York City, visiting them after visiting my sister at Bark River, about an hour back).

COMMUNING WITH NATURE
LEAD: AS OPULENT AND often aggressive architect-designed homes have overcrowded the Hamptons in recent years, the image of the simple, modern beach house now seems as anachronistic as the acres of potato fields that once dominated the Long Island landscape.
A few of these shacklike structures still exist, however, including the house shown on these pages.

MOVE BY KHOMEINI RAISES QUESTIONS
LEAD: The appointment last week of Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's Parliament, as commander of Iran's armed forces may indicate that Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is no longer able or willing to carry out the task, according to Administration officials and experts on Iran.


An Addition That Leaves Well Enough Alone
LEAD: No skyscraper, no football stadium, no shopping mall could possibly say as much about how our culture's attitudes toward architecture have evolved as the diminutive addition that has been proposed for the Jewish Museum on Fifth Avenue.
The extraordinary thing about this addition is that when it is finished, no one is supposed to know that anything happened at all.


Reviews/Music; Mezzo-Soprano in Debut
LEAD: By the time Hyunjoo Yun had completed the set of Mendelssohn songs that came midway through the first half of her debut recital at Merkin Concert Hall on Wednesday evening, the mezzo-soprano's considerable gifts had become apparent.
Miss Yun, a Korean-born artist who received her doctorate in voice at the Manhattan School of Music, sings with ease and grace, bringing a surety of pitch and a steady, unforced approach to fluid melodic lines.

The Work of Cezanne Before He Became Cezanne
LEAD: ''Cezanne: The Early Years, 1859 - 1872'' at the Royal Academy of Arts here will surprise many of those for whom the Museum of Modern Art's 1977 exhibition ''Cezanne: The Late Work'' was a formative experience.
What we see now is not the immediate prelude to those last years, with their controlled vision and mastery of pictorial structure, but a wholly different artist: Cezanne before he became the Cezanne who had such an impact on the painting of the early 20th century.


Pace University
LEAD: Thomas Sobol, New York State's Commissioner of Education and the president of the University of the State of New York, warned that ''the gaps are widening between minorities and whites'' during the commencement speech yesterday at Pace University.

Did the Postseason Hurt the N.H.L.?
LEAD: There were a number of bad moments in this year's playoffs.
Nevertheless, we already knew that the N.H.L. is a league where spearing, confronting officials after the conclusion of a game, and other unsportsmanlike acts are commonplace - and go unpunished.
But one good thing did emerge from this ''tainted'' postseason: How 'bout Those Devils!


Proposition to Watch
LEAD: Politicians often claim that voters oppose spending tax dollars to finance election campaigns.
A voter-initiated referendum on Tuesday's California ballot offers an intriguing test.


Did the Postseason Hurt the N.H.L.?
LEAD: About as much as a blistering slap shot that hits a goalie's protective cup.
It doesn't do any permanent damage, it leaves you stunned and surprised, and you sure as hell don't ever want to see it happen again.

J - Julius Erving, the eminent basketball player.


Scaring the Clients - Then Calming Them Down
LEAD: LOWE TUCKER METCALF opened its doors with more than mere enthusiasm.
It came with Frank Lowe, chairman of Lowe Howard-Spink &amp; Bell P.L.C., London, which, in turn, is associated with the Interpublic Group of Companies, a holding company of advertising agencies with worldwide billings of $5.6 billion.


The Newest Super Automatic
LEAD: THE pace of automation has been so rapid in photography, sometimes it seems that the sky is the limit.
I've jokingly predicted that the next logical development will be a camera that decides on its own what pictures to take.
If this hypothetical camera sees a terrific landscape or a photogenic face, it will fire its own shutter, without any help from you or me.

TIME HAS BEEN KIND TO THE NYMPHET: 'LOLITA' 30 YEARS LATER
LEAD: ''Lolita is famous, not I,'' Nabokov said to one of the many interviewers who came to interrogate him after the succes de scandale of ''Lolita.'' And like so many Nabokovian utterances, it was both true and the mirror image of true.
Lolita's fame made her creator both a ''brand-name'' author - to use that distressing contemporary locution -and an adjective.

DELAWARE INC.
LEAD: ON JAN. 3, 1986, THE READERS OF THE ASIAN EDITION of The Wall Street Journal were treated to an arresting full-page advertisement.

Texas: From San Antonio through the hill country
LEAD: Driving in Texas has never been merely a matter of getting from one place to another.
Instead, the endless stretches of road have always been a central part of the state's mythology - the truest way to plug into the diversity of terrain and the grandiose sense of scale that helps define the state.


Broadway's Siren Song
LEAD: To the Editor; Robert Brustein's piece  [ ''The Siren Song of Broadway Is a Warning,'' May 22 ]  indeed points to trends that disturb the founders of the resident theater movement.
I refer to that part of his very provocative essay analyzing the risks assumed by nonprofit theaters transferring new plays to Broadway, particularly when they let the selection of a particular work be influenced by second-guessing commercial producers.


COLORADO'S THRIVING CULTS
LEAD: I suggest that Mr.
Bordewich shouldn't be so quick to condemn the voice of change.
After all, what do physicists make of the discovery of molecules that anticipate one another's actions across the solar system (as reported in your Science pages earlier this year)?
Perhaps science is fated to reaffirm what other cultures have known all along: that the cosmos is one.


Lauren Jannucci Marries in Jersey

At This Festival, the Jugglers Are Behind the Scenes
LEAD: One day last April, Tony Rudel, the bright and loquacious music impresario of the First New York International Festival of the Arts - which opens Saturday - suddenly found himself speechless.

A Special Award For a Theater Man
LEAD: When Broadway dispenses the last and most important of its annual awards tonight, the name of one winner is certain to baffle most of the nearly 2,000 spectators at the Minskoff Theater.

Nazis and History To the Editor
LEAD: If Serge Schmemann's article  [ ''Germans Argue Over a Museum That Will Offer a Probing Look at Their History,'' May 15 ]  is any indication of what the world can expect from this venture, we should not get up our hopes.
The article is filled with empty verbiage and euphemisms, much of it quotations from German publications: ''The museum should help .

Lilco Management to Remain in Place
LEAD: FOR weeks, as negotiators for New York State and the Long Island Lighting Company struggled to conclude their accord to close the Shoreham nuclear power plant and allow Lilco to remain an independent, investor-owned utility, one of the major stumbling blocks appeared to be questions over Lilco's management.

Michael S. Dukakis, have emerged as leading economists in the 1988 Presidential campaigns.
If, as expected, Mr.
Dukakis and Mr.
Bush oppose each other this fall, one of these economists is likely to land a top job in the next


California Primary Testing Candidates' Fall Strategies
LEAD: It was supposed to provide a rousing grand finale to the nominating season, as it has so often done in the past.
But with the Presidential candidates in both parties all but chosen, Tuesday's California primary has turned out to be a trial heat for the fall election.


Yes, There Are Summer Risotto Dishes
LEAD: I USUALLY think of risotto as a cold-weather dish.
The hearty, stick-to-the ribs nature of a plate of rice cooked so the texture retains a hint of resistance to the bite and the grains are bound with a creaminess that is not quite a sauce is delicious sustenance.
It is not light summertime fare.


&gt;Karen Methany Engaged
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Mrs.
Robert Moura and Bradie Methany, both of South Dartmouth, Mass., of the engagement of their daughter Karen Simone Methany to Anthony Joseph Rafanelli, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

California: The great wind farms of the Tehachapi Pass
LEAD: Los Angeles may be fantasy enough, but for a truly otherworldly experience take the 115-mile drive to the Tehachapi Pass wind farms.
The mountainous pass, which serves as a funnel through which powerful winds whip into the Mojave Desert below, is covered with huge windmills that generate electric power for Southern California.


In Lebanon, a New Chance for the Old War
LEAD: LEBANON is caught in a new cycle of violence that may accelerate as warring factions are further provoked by this summer's presidential election.

FOCUS: Overbuilt Office Markets; Developers Redirecting Their Energies
LEAD: IT is a measure of the overbuilding that has taken place in this country that Tishman Speyer Properties, one of New York's leading developers, has only one office building in the United States planned for this year: the NBC Tower, rising on the shores of Lake Michigan in Chicago.


Soldering: It's Not So Hard
LEAD: SOLDERING is a method of using heat to join pieces of metal, especially sheet metal, plumbing and electrical wiring.
Unlike welding, in which pieces being joined are heated until they melt and flow together, in soldering, additional metal - solder - is melted so it flows between the pieces and cements them.

LEAD: Constance Ann Phlipot and Douglas Bruce Wake, Foreign Service officers, were married yesterday at the American Foreign Service Club in Washington by Commissioner Morton Berg of Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

Devils Played In Wrong Arena
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


HOW THE ASPIC FROM TOPEKA WON THE HEART OF ALICE B. TOKLAS
LEAD: I suppose everybody makes lists of favorite books.
Firmly entrenched on my reference list for modern literature and the arts - and, I suspect, on most everybody else's too - is ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.'' With that book, in the summer of 1933, after decades of rejection and mostly coterie and vanity publication, Gertrude Stein could at last read herself in the pages of The Atlantic Monthly - in four successive issues.


The Gender of Guys as a Burning Issue
LEAD: To the Editor:

ON CAMPUS: THE BATTLE OF THE BOOKS
LEAD: THE PHILOSOPHER GEORGE SANTAYANA was once asked which books young people should read.
It didn't matter, he replied, as long as they read the same ones.
Generations of Eng. lit. majors in American colleges followed his advice.
You started with the Bible, moved briskly through Beowulf and Chaucer, Shakespeare and Milton, the 18th-century novel, the Romantics, a few big American books like ''The Scarlet Letter'' and ''Moby

Producing Musicals On a Small Scale
LEAD: DASHA EPSTEIN of Bedford Hills has had a number of big Broadway hits, all of them small scale. ''It doesn't have to be big to be good,'' said the co-producer of the mini-musical hit ''Ain't Misbehavin,' '' Hal Holbrook's famed one-man show, ''Mark Twain Tonight,'' the immensely successful two-character comedy ''Same Time, Next Year'' and the prize-winning three-character drama '' 'Master Harold' .


LP Turntables Spin Ahead
LEAD: When the compact disk was launched five years ago, its more avid advocates prophesied that by 1988 conventional LP turntables would be found only at the Smithsonian Institution.
They are now eating their words.


Lost in Summit Noise
LEAD: At any time but summit time, the string of novelties that came out of the Soviet Union last week would have resonated.
First, as Ronald Reagan prepared to leave for Moscow, the Soviet legislature staged a tax revolt of sorts.
A goodly portion of a body known primarily for its rubber stamp opposed a business tax that had earlier been put into effect without discussion.


ART
LEAD: Right now, we have major exhibition catalogues that in scope, thoroughness and quality of reproduction outrank all their predecessors.
Should they also outrank the art books to which no great exhibition is attached?
Yes, we might say, when we look at some current examples. ''Fragonard'' (not long ago at the Met), ''Gauguin'' (now at the National Gallery of Art in Washington), ''Degas'' (now at the new National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and due at the Met in the fall), ''The Berggruen Klee Collection'' (now at the Met) and ''The Pulitzer Collection'' (now at the Fogg Art Gallery in


Did the Postseason Hurt the N.H.L.?
LEAD: If you take the position that good or bad publicity is better than no publicity at all, then doughnuts and blackouts kept the N.H.L. atop the sports headlines.
However, if, like the author, you are a true fan of hockey, you'd realize that what transpired did nothing to enhance the sport.

Ankle Monitor Gets A Home Tryout
LEAD: WHEN Denise Keller arrived home one recent evening, she heard her husband, James, the assistant director of public affairs for the county, conducting a most peculiar telephone conversation. ''Alaska,'' he intoned solemnly. ''Tennessee.
California.''


Billing $15 Million In Less Than a Year
LEAD: FOR Robert Jeffrey, 34, and Gary Goldsmith, 33, opening their own agency was a way to pursue their high, not to say stratospheric, ideals.
That, in turn, meant they had to be financially independent.
They planned for two years, and opened in June, 1987 with one $1 million account, Knoll Furniture, but with no backers or partners.


The Month of June Brings on the Roses
LEAD: HOUSE plants can be summered outdoors: begonias, gardenias, orchids and tropical foliage plants need shade, while geraniums, jades, cactuses and succulents can be placed in full sun.
Hanging plants such as Swedish ivy, tradescantia and fuchsias can be fastened under limbs of shade trees.
Last call to plant seed of lima beans, sweet corn and cucumbers; plant another half row of carrots and beets; pull up spent spinach plants and reseed these rows with chard or beets.

An All-Star Team With a Taste for Politics
LEAD: SINCE 1984, they have been known as the Tuesday Team, part of a collection of advertising all-stars who helped keep Ronald Reagan in the White House.
Now they are known as Messner, Vetere, Berger, Carey.
Individually, they are Thomas G. Messner, Barry T. Vettere, Ronald S.Berger and Walter A. Carey.


The Waldheim Docu-Trial
LEAD: Television history is often suspect history: trivialized and rewritten shamelessly to grab a mass audience.
Hence the shudders many people felt on learning that Britain's Thames Television has joined with Home Box Office to put Kurt Waldheim before the bar on the box.
The fears are unfounded. ''Waldheim: A Commission of Inquiry,'' to be shown tonight on cable TV, respects history and the rights of Mr.


The New and the Rococo, by Trio Bell'Arte
LEAD: Music of C. P. E. Bach, adventurous but well within the realm of rococo pleasantry, alternated with new scores that sought and found a similar musical realm at the Trio Bell'Arte concert Friday evening at Weill Recital Hall.
The ensemble consists of Robert Stallman (flute), Bert Lucarelli (oboe) and Elaine Comparone (harpsichord), and the first new piece was a ''Spring Sonata'' for all three instruments by William Thomas M


A Technology Analyst's Bank
LEAD: WHEN is a bank not really a bank?
Maybe when a technology analyst recommends its stock.
In view of how it earns most of its money, the State Street Boston Corporation is ''primarily a data-processing service company'' rather than a bank, said Gary J. Blauer, a vice president at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis.


Love Is a Midlife Crisis

BUSINESS FORUM: THE 1950's REVISITED; Coming Soon: More Men than Women
LEAD: AN important demographic trend is pointing to the resurgence of traditional family life with wide implications for the economy and business.
The trend is the changing sex ratio among eligible males and females.
Some of the immediate consequences of this change will be an increase in birth rates in the 1990's, and a resurgence of the conventional family by the year 2000 (father working, mother at home with the children) from today's 28 percent of all households, to the 1960's level of 44 percent.


Ukrainian Religious Celebrating for 1,000 Reasons

Privacy: A Definition Is Evolving Case by Case
LEAD: OUTRAGED by lurid newspaper accounts of the wedding of a prominent Senator's daughter, two young Boston lawyers boldly penned an article in 1890 calling for a ''right to be let alone.''


Learning the Value of Money, Again
LEAD: MONEY, everyone knows, just isn't what it used to be.
Most of us remember, or remember hearing from our parents, how penny candy really used to cost a penny.
Some can remember when Saturday movie matinees cost 50 cents and gas cost less than $1.
But where, oh where, have those days gone?


Welcome Back
LEAD: IN 1907, THE PEAK YEAR, 1,004,756 immigrants were received at Ellis Island, alongside the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.

Lots of Water, Lots of Growth

It belongs on no one's priority list.

Bright Spot In a Downer

Update On the Hemline Hoopla
LEAD: Last June, the debate was how short is chic.
This magazine, for example, ran the pages shown above with the reactions from a few stylish women.
A year later, the question is still hemlines, but now it is how much longer should they be.
Or is it perhaps easier to skirt the whole issue with pants?
Most of the women shown in last spring's pages have now settled for a length that hovers just above the knee, one that HG's editor in chief, Anna Wintour, still terms ''very modern.


Outdoors; Memories of a Master Guide
LEAD: ALTHOUGH some misguided souls try to make them so, hunting and fishing are not competitive sports and, harmless bantering by companions aside, are degraded by serious attempts at score-keeping.

LEAD: Steve Bentley was barely 18 years old, a college freshman living away from home for the first time.

Frederick Barthelme's Spilled Bean
LEAD: To the Editor:


NEW YORKERS, ETS.
LEAD: IT'S not that Sallie Slate is particularly status conscious; for goodness' sake, you'd have to be pretty far gone to even think of status in connection with garbage.
No, it's just that Ms.

THE REGION: 10 Years of Casinos; Why the Boardwalk Is Rich and Atlantic City is Poor
LEAD: TEN years after the first of a dozen casino hotels opened in Atlantic City, it is clear that they have failed to be the ''unique tool of urban redevelopment'' the New Jersey Legislature envisioned.
The casinos have made fortunes and have transformed the Boardwalk into a glittering strip of towers; they provide thousands of jobs and pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.


The St. Tropez Of the Atlantic Gets a Bridge
LEAD: MANY French social luminaries migrate for their summer vacations not to the Cote d'Azur but to the minuscule sun-drenched Ile de Re off the Atlantic coast.
Re basks surprisingly in a near Mediterranean climate, explaining its label as the St.
Tropez of the Bay of Biscay.
This blue sliver in the sea lies opposite La Rochelle, itself one of the loveliest cities in France and a little-known treasure for travelers 300 miles southwest of


Tennessee-N. Carolina: Off the beaten path through the Great Smokies
LEAD: The main route through the Great Smoky Mountains, Newfound Gap Road, twists and almost turns back on itself as it rises to reveal a series of views of forested slopes and bald areas of rock slides.

POSTINGS: 800 for Glen Cove; Town Houses on a Creek
LEAD: Three sites on both sides of Glen Cove Creek on Long Island will soon be occupied by 800 town houses, completing development along the creek and filling some of the last vacant land on Nassau County's north shore.
The setting will make it possible for buyers of the town houses to live close to their boats.


Royals Revamping
LEAD: HE has had a lot on his mind, but nobody can say that John Schuerholz can't chew the fat and dream up deals at the same time.

But with so many publishers pandering to the dirty-fingernail crowd, it was inevitable that too many offerings would be slick packages geared to the quick sale, devoid of either sustenance or soul.

LEAD: Not so long ago, a concert-worthy synthesizer was a wall of erratic electronic modules tied to keyboards of limited capability.
Today, electronic keyboards are immensely ''smarter,'' and with one or two of them linked to a computer and a couple of sequencers or other relatively compact devices, a composer interested in performing live electronic works has a great deal of power and variety at his fingertips.


Street Fashion; With Grips, Snug Is a Cinch
LEAD: EVER wonder how to take up the sag in the back of that oversize jacket?
Or how to keep your T-shirt sleeves rolled up, your pants from falling down or your leg warmers from drooping?
Obviously, there are many ways, but those who are fashion-conscious have been using little gizmos that serve all those functions, and a few others too.


Bad Goods
LEAD: To the Editor:


Powered by Sun, Young Racers Look to Future
LEAD: The tiny solar-powered racing car had just completed a test lap around the track and the driver, James Worden, needed some help from his pit crew. ''Can somebody get me out of here?'' Mr.
Worden pleaded from behind the Plexiglas bubble that covered the cockpit.


If America Is Serious About AIDS; Then Washington Must Fight Discrimination
LEAD: The Government's reponse to the AIDS epidemic still lacks a critical element: a law barring discrimination against those who carry the virus.
Without such protection, people will fear being tested lest careless disclosure cost them jobs and housing.
This plain truth has long eluded some in the Administration and Congress.

POSTINGS: 145 Acres; A Big Park For Business
LEAD: Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes built its first business park - the first in the United States, its officials say - in 1947.
The 200-acre office and warehouse complex on Route 128 in Needham, Mass., became home to five tire companies, several shoe companies and the American Can Company.
Now, after developing 100 such complexes, the 91-year-old Boston firm owned by Marshall Field 5th and his family is about to begin a 145-acre business park in Hamilton Township, N.J.


Musical Therapy for the Terminally Ill
LEAD: Curled under a floral blanket on a mattress in the middle of the living room, a woman lies dying of lung cancer.
Beside her bed, a pair of musicians smile as they play ''A Lot of Living to Do'' on flute and piano.


Henry James's Sussex Haunt
LEAD: RISING above the surrounding marshes that reach to the English Channel two miles off, Rye is a compact pyramid of steep winding cobblestone lanes lined with brick and timbered red-roofed houses, many dating from the 15th century and often resting on foundations far older.
Straddling the sandstone hilltop itself, ''like a stranded ark,'' as the local poet Patric Dickinson sees it, is the Norman church begun in the 12th century and dedicated to St.


Five Views on How to Do Things Differently
LEAD:  Remove the Privilege Of Being First


Fast Track Across the Ocean
LEAD: The entry list for an upcoming ocean race from Plymouth, England, to Newport, R.I., reads like a who's who of solo yacht racing.
It is a high-technology, bigger-is-better kind of event, in which competitors rely heavily on shoreside help.


Michigan: Between the lake and the bay, the Leelanau Peninsula
LEAD: The summit of the Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes stands some 450 feet above the cold, blue surface of Lake Michigan, a kind of Sahara of the north woods or, if you look at it another way, Michigan's steepest beach.
From these ghostly sand mountains, flecked with wildflowers and bits of polished driftwood, the lake seems to go on forever.


NATIONAL GRIDLOCK
LEAD: I was flabbergasted at the solution offered by the experts and engineers to the problem of ''transportation hell'' (''National Gridlock,'' by James Gleick, May 8).
Their answer is to outfit every car with its own radar system tied to a centralized computer!
I can see it now: cars screeching and fuming down the side streets of Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, each driver trying to beat the other guy to the office.


Francesca Amato Marries
LEAD: Francesca Amato, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Francesco Amato of Hoboken, N.J., was married there yesterday to Neil P. Fitzpatrick, a son of Mrs.

Sportsmanship Relegated to Past
LEAD: To the Sports Editor: rrI am an amateur, in the best sense of the word, about horse racing.
But if I know little or nothing about the so-called sport of kings, I do know something about sportsmanship.
I know that to beat an opponent by unfair means is not sporting.
The frank, even boastful admission by Forty Niner's trainer that he had in fact instructed his jockey ''to bump Winning Colors continuously in order to prevent the filly from winning'' the


Mets Win On Homer in 13th
LEAD: Ron Darling thought these days were behind him. Obviously, he was wrong.


Mixing Legal Studies And Municipal Service
LEAD: It was final exam week recently at New York Law School, and Angelo J. Aponte, New York City's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, was just another student.
So was Marilyn J. Flood, Executive Director of the city's Commission on the Status of Women, who used some of her vacation time to study for the tests.


Sandra Kunhardt, A Writer, Marries

Paul's on-the-Hill Episcopal Church, of which he is rector.


Monumental Longevity?
LEAD: To the Sports Editor: rrI used to think that one last straw and I, too (''The Winfield Fiasco is the Last Straw,'' by James F. Clarity, The New York Times, May 8), would be gone from Yankee Stadium until Steinbrenner's ''temporary custody'' is over.
Unfortunately, Steinbrenner has had control for over 10 years and he won't go away.


Setback for Driver
LEAD: HE made a remarkable comeback after a serious crash last fall, but Roberto Guerrero, the race driver who spent 17 days in a coma last September, has been a bit shaky since returning to the track in January, initially for training and later as a driver in all three of the Indy-car races held so far this season.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  No More Mugs
For John Singer Sargent, to make a living painting portraits was like being the host of a perpetual tea party.
The story of how he gave it up in 1907 is told in ''John Singer Sargent: His Portrait'' by Stanley Olson (St. Martin's).


Rediscovering Insley Landscapes
LEAD: ALBERT INSLEY, whose paintings and drawings are on view at Nardin Fine Arts here, is another in a series of ''rediscoveries'' this season in Westchester.
Insley (1842-1937), however, is not a brand new old painter.


Is the Bull About to Run?
LEAD: The Dow Jones industrial average surged 74.68 points on Tuesday and 32.89 points on Wednesday on heavy volume, and finished 114.86 points up over the previous week.
To many analysts, these upswings hint at a future bull market as buyers come back into the stock market from the sidelines.
To others it signals the beginning of a more limited summer rally.


Frederick Barthelme's Spilled Bean
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Business of Preparing a Banquet
LEAD: THE traditional American business practice of meeting and eating reaches a peak in late spring, when dozens of luncheons, dinners and banquets are held each day at hotels in the county.
The banquet industry is a big one, with hotels vying for the chance to play host at everything from charity benefits for 1,200 people to small corporate dinners for a select gathering of executives.


Review/Dance; Wryness By Self And Moore
LEAD: A number of strange and wonderful worlds collide, though very gently, in ''Crankhouse,'' presented on Friday night at the Bessie Schonberg Theater.
The work of Jim Self, the dancer and choreographer, and Frank Moore, the painter, ''Crankhouse'' is one of those rare collaborations in which the individual contributions are inseparable.


A Plug From Reagan, a New Test Ahead
LEAD: STARTLING as it was to watch President Reagan stand before students at Moscow State University last week and deliver a heartfelt plea for freedom and democracy, the real revelation was the reaction of his Soviet listeners.
What once would have been taken as a show of American chauvinism was, in this heady time the American President called ''Moscow spring,'' widely regarded as a sort of campaign speech for Mikhail S.


NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Dewey Beach, Del.; Road Project Worries Resort
LEAD: COMMERCIAL development has begun to pick up again in this coastal resort since a four-year moratorium on sewage hookups was lifted in December.

LEAD: To the Editor:


UConn Pitcher Closer To a Baseball Dream
LEAD: IT is something Charles Nagy has thought about since he first began to play baseball.
He would play catch in the backyard with his older brother, Rich, and dream about being elsewhere.
In his fantasies, Charles was never in the backyard.
He was on the pitcher's mound in a major league ballpark.


LORDING IT OVER ENGLAND
LEAD: Israel Shenker's article on the House of Lords bears the headline ''Lording It Over England'' (May 8).
Many of us Scots, even exiled ones, recall the Treaty of Union of 1707 with no great fondness; but the inescapable fact is that the House of Lords does indeed lord it over not just England, but Scotland, and indeed Wales and Northern


COLORADO'S THRIVING CULTS
LEAD: Fergus Bordewich was able to find critics aplenty to mouth the growing attack on the New Age movement but seemed reluctant to quote as generously from articulate proponents.
The critics use scare terms such as ''Satanism, totalitarianism and irrationalism,'' and warn that an emphasis on the inner life will mean serious glitches in technological civilization.


Boning Up
LEAD: To the Editor: Methinks that Ruth Wolff doth protest too much about closely researching a journey beforehand (''Innocence Abroad,'' Travel, May 1).
Is she perhaps trying to persuade herself that the things she's missed weren't worth seeing after all?


Dr. Ellen R. Sher Is Married to Philip J. Voorhees
LEAD: The marriage of Dr.
Ellen Ruth Sher, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Harold T. Sher of Monmouth Beach, N.J., to Philip James Voorhees, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

A Broad Piece of Legislation Addresses Worries About Health
LEAD: THE first worker safety law concentrating on video display terminals is scheduled for signing this week in Suffolk County, on eastern Long Island.
The law would affect thousands of workers in an estimated 300 to 400 businesses there.
Because its supporters view the bill as a model for similar laws in other municipal, county and state governments, it might eventually affect 900,000 workers who use terminals in New York State, and an estimated 12 million nationwide.


SHULTZ, IN JORDAN, APPEALS TO KING ON MIDEAST PLAN
LEAD: Secretary of State George P. Shultz flew to Jordan today to make a fresh appeal to King Hussein to support the United States blueprint for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.

Richard G. Mason of Parkersburg, W. Va., and Kennebunkport, Me.


Yes, There Are Summer Risotto Dishes
LEAD: I USUALLY think of risotto as a cold-weather dish.
The hearty, stick-to-the ribs nature of a plate of rice cooked so the texture retains a hint of resistance to the bite and the grains are bound with a creaminess that is not quite a sauce is delicious sustenance.
It is not light summertime fare.


Hawaii's Expressive Handmade Quilts
LEAD: WHEN the missionary women of New England introduced quilt stitchery to the Sandwich Islands, an avenue was opened for Hawaiian creativity to turn the craft into a celebration of heart, head and hand.
Durable, expressive Hawaiian quilts are a Pacific contribution to a traditional American art form, and in island homes they are as treasured as the family silver.

LEAD: Gone is the Bayard Estate where Alexander Hamilton died after his duel with Aaron Burr.

LEAD: Steffi Graf won the French Open so easily and so quickly today that in her speech to the crowd afterward she apologized.


Women Rock Their Way
LEAD: Old truisms die hard, but here's one that finally joined the dinosaurs and the dodos: Women can't rock like men.
Sure they can; listen no further than Tina Turner, Joan Jett, Bonnie Raitt, Joan Armatrading, K. D. Lang, Annie Lennox of Eurythmics, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart.
Now comes phase two -women who rock on their own terms.


How California Does It
LEAD: With business development offices in Tokyo, London and, soon, Mexico City, California has been a leader at luring foreign investment.

In the Shade of Maples and Memories
LEAD: THE three pieces of equipment arrived early, before 8 o'clock.

Splendors of the Baroque Age From Munich
LEAD: With the arrival at the National Gallery of Art in Washington of ''Masterworks from Munich,'' a loan show of 62 Old Master paintings from the Alte Pinakothek, a persistent imbalance is partly righted.

Leonard Machlis of Edison, N.J.
Rabbi Barton Shallat officiated.
The bride, a graduate of Brandeis University, is an advertising sales representative at Barron's in New York.


Many Questions Arise as the Celtics Fall
LEAD: Some people call it mystique, tradition or Celtic pride, alluding to the friendly Kelly-green ghosts that inhabit the Boston Garden and the gremlins that upset the best-laid plans of opposing teams.
Others are less romantic, attributing the perennial success of the Celtics to Arnold (Red) Auerbach, the shrewd patriarch, who puffs on ever-present victory cigars, blowing smoke on the rest of the National Basketball Association even as he outwits it.


Malaysian Jailing of 4 Hurts Women's Cause
LEAD: They are an unlikely gang of four: two social workers and two church workers committed to the struggle for women's rights and social change in Malaysia.

Review/Film; Lust and Murder in Triangular 'Drifter'
LEAD: ''The Drifter'' was shot, its press material says, ''in 17 days on a budget too low to mention.'' Here is a press release with more honesty than tact, and it is not encouraging.
But there are worse things than competent formula films, and, as it turns out, many worse films around than ''The Drifter.


Summitry Shows Up Misperceptions
LEAD: The Reagan-Gorbachev summit meeting came out all right, serving the basic purpose of moving Soviet-American relations onto a more regular footing.
Mr.
Gorbachev made that point, saying he was eager to continue with an early get-acquainted summit meeting with the next U.S.
President, that is, without important new agreements to sign.


When T-Shirts Just Won't Do
LEAD: THEY were sleep clothes designed for women who have never worn traditional lingerie and are getting tired of oversize T-shirts, explained Carole Hochman, a lingerie designer.

Saying Goodbye to Cold Calls and Corporate Lunches
LEAD: AFTER decades of doing what they were told at Doyle Dane Bernbach, Roy Grace and Diane Rothschild are not budging now that they have their own agency.

When the head of a major financial services company started dictating copy and typography, for example, they quit the account.

COLORADO'S THRIVING CULTS
LEAD: Fergus Bordewich's observation that a religious movement so closely identified with the counterculture of the 1960's has been appropriated by corporate businessmen and yuppies in Colorado may seem ironic, but it is hardly surprising, given the origins of the New Age movement in America (''Colorado's Thriving Cults,'' May 1).

Who Will Pay New York City's AIDS Costs?

NATIONAL GRIDLOCK
LEAD: What's needed, clearly, are dramatic incentives to move people out of cars and onto mass transit.
In Paris, for example, commuters can buy weekly or monthly passes at a discount, and they can transfer between buses and the metro for free.
Until this kind of innovation is brought to New York, I'm not sure the gridlock crisis can ever be untangled.

It is an Orthodox congregation.


Fresh Air Fund Operates Youth Camp
LEAD: The first lesson James E. Elliott, a 15-year-old streetwise son of East Harlem, learned when he arrived at Camp Pioneer was that his night vision improved when he turned his flashlight off.

Broadway Classics And Classic Folk Artists
LEAD: THE program for the original edition of ''Guys and Dolls'' and the road companies of ''Call Me Madam'' and ''Can-Can'' listed a promising ballerina named Conchita del Rivero.

A Victor in Jersey's Primary: From Coach to Congress Race

At Home With the Elizabethans

By Train From Rome To Zurich
LEAD: THE rapido from Rome to Milan was late again, as that premier train of the Italian State Railways often is, and there were only a few minutes left to catch the 1 P.M. express to Zurich.
Lugging a heavy suitcase and a carry-on, I jogged from platform 12 to platform 5 under the grimy steel-and-glass roof of Milan Central Station and found a long row of empty coaches.

Philadelphia's Master Plan Rests on Its Streets
LEAD: THERE IS A NEW PLAN FOR THE center of this city, and it manages to learn both from Philadelphia's own history and from the halting and often failed efforts of other major American cities to control and guide their growth.
Perhaps there should be no surprise that Philadelphia has done it right: from the standpoint of urban planning, after all, Philadelphia has long been one of the luckiest cities in the United

LEAD: Julian L. Simon, professor of business administration at the University of Maryland, has studied energy and raw materials markets through history.

LONG ISLAND OPINIONSay, Can You See If My Flag's There?
LEAD: WHEN I bought my property on the beach in a small town in Long Island, I never gave much thought to the flagpole, replete with an American flag thereon.

Provence
LEAD: To the Editor: In his story on Provence revisited (Travel, March 20), Nicholas Delbanco regrets, with good reason, the closing of the restaurant Le Nid d'Aigle in Gourdon.
We were there in July 1965 and had always hoped to return.

How could anyone have abandoned so spectacular a site?

LEAD: An article in The Business World of March 27, ''How Magnates Pick Partners,'' reported on a business relationship between Michael R. Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert and Saul Steinberg, chairman of Reliance Group Holdings.


Arab Parley: Hard Stance; Anti-U.S. Inflamed by Uprising
LEAD: The summit meeting of Arab heads of state this week has significantly hardened the common Arab stand on terms for Middle East peace talks.

PLAYERS MAY SEEK TO MAKE CALLS ON UMPIRE'S PERFORMANCE
LEAD: A WEEK ago, the umpires, dissatisfied with the penalty accorded Billy Martin following his dirt-throwing tantrum, said they would scrutinize Martin's behavior and eject him from games should he argue their calls.
Now the umpires themselves may be scrutinized by a group that is dissatisfied with their behavior: the players.


HOW FAR CAN A MANAGER GO IN ARGUMENTS?
LEAD: A manager has the right and responsibility to question calls concerning rules and apparent poor judgment.
He does not have the privilege to degrade the officials and defile the integrity of the sport.

Always with a cigar in his mouth.
The merest whiff of cigar smoke brings him back to me.


Mystery Of the Babe
LEAD: There are many colorful stories about Babe Ruth, some confirmed and others that persist no matter how unlikely they seem.

LEAD:  Arabs Harden Peace Stand


Mailbox; Racism Claim Is Disputed
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


SOUL-SEARCHING
LEAD: Albert Vorspan talks of the moral need to speak out, but the question is complicated.
Should not morality consider the comfort one's comments provide to those who would continue the war against Israel and who see the main battleground as right here in the United States?
Should not morality take into account that Israel is situated not in the Middle West, with its democratic political culture, but in the Middle East, where authoritarianism, extremism and terrorism too often win out and threaten Israel?

A New Breed of Corporate Skipper
LEAD: IN THE OCEAN OFF MIAMI, FIVE 50-FOOT SAILBOATS WERE AP-proaching an inflated orange cone - the first windward mark of the triangular race course at the Miami 50's Yacht Racing World Championship last March.
The boats were almost bumper to bumper, a sight that sent warning tingles up the spine.
It wasn't their speed, about six knots, but their momentum, their inability to change direction quickly, and the fact that they have no brakes.

Beside Spring Lies Life's Dark Promise
LEAD: A FRIEND called this morning, and while I looked out my window at a robin poking through the leaves for worms, I listened as she told me about her 12-year-old daughter, stricken suddenly with cancer.
Her voice revealed a panic inside her carefully chosen words.
I kept my voice calm and my eye on the robin.


A Vigorous New Conductor Faces a Tired Orchestra
LEAD: NO ONE NEEDS TO TELL Yuri Temirkanov he has his work cut out for him.
When appointed in early April as the new chief conductor of the once formidable Leningrad Philharmonic, he inherited an orchestra in trouble.
Like dowdy Leningrad's pastel palaces, shabbier with each passing winter, the Philharmonic has been showing its age, sliding into perfunctory performances of a narrow repertory, fading along with Evgeny Mravinsky, its leader for nearly 50 - that's right, 50 - years.

POSTINGS: Windsor Terrace Condos; A Mews Near the Park

A Little Imagination

ANOTHER CHALLENGE TO ROME BY LIBERAL CATHOLICS IN U.S.

Once covered from head to toe with habits, and obedient to their superiors at every command, most active nuns now make decisions about their own lives and dress as they please.
They choose their jobs, decide where to live and elect their leaders.


Vegetating
LEAD: BOTANISTS ARE THRILLED, though, understandably, not overanxious.
The first reference work to list and describe all the higher plant life of the United States and Canada ought to be completed shortly after the millennium.

The Greats Play the Great Outdoors

LEAD:  RIVER FESTIVAL


HOW FAR CAN A MANAGER GO IN ARGUMENTS?
LEAD: Having the right to fight a bad call is a rule book guarantee that's quickly losing ground in baseball.
The rarity of a reversed decision by umpires is indicative of their self-perceived infallibility.
With a few exceptions, a call contested by a manager is usually verified by instant replay and yet because of false pride or a brotherhood amongst the umpires a changed call becomes as rare as a kosher stadium hot dog.


Sports People; Team of Bidders
LEAD: TWO of the investors involved in the scramble to buy the Baltimore Orioles have joined forces.

Show Business as a Business Tool
LEAD: SLOWLY but steadily, corporate America is heeding the call of Henry James to ''Dramatize it, dramatize it.'' Theater, it seems, is becoming a tool of business.

But corporate involvement is taking a new twist as businesses use actors and plays as part of their in-house educational efforts and to help with marketing and sales.

SOUL-SEARCHING
LEAD: Diaries force people to confront their feelings and actions.
The honesty of Albert Vorspan's diary, and the fact that he made it publicly available, provide us with a model worthy of emulation.

LEAD: AMONG the more appealing features of new construction is the chance to customize or add - a fireplace here, a skylight there, a door shifted three feet to accommodate grandma's couch.
Builders call them options or extras.


AN M.B.A. RUNS THE GANTLET
LEAD: A FEW WEEKS AFTER BLACK Monday, I was sitting in James B. Rogers's class in securities analysis at the Columbia Business School when a television crew arrived to tape the session.

One of the topics that day was chicken farming.

The Church Rejected Priestesses
LEAD: To the Editor:


SOUL-SEARCHING
LEAD: As a survivor of the Holocaust who is sensitive to the issue of the good German who did not want to know about Auschwitz, I am pleased to see that Albert Vorspan refuses to follow that example.
The time has come to speak up.
When, 40 years ago, we proclaimed ''Never again,'' we did not mean that the end of oppression and inhumanity would be for


Students Raid Korea Government Office
LEAD: Students hurling firebombs stormed a Government building that houses the Prime Minister's office and fought with police officers today, one day after security forces blocked a march to the North Korean border by students seeking reunification.


Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''The new government will be Islamic.
We want an Islamic regime under the law of the Koran.
There will be some educated people who know about this.
They will serve Islam.'' - Lalmohammed, an Afghan guerrilla commander.  [ 1:6. ]


ON AND OFF TRACK, KING OVERCOMES HURDLES
LEAD: THE symbols of her busy life stand in full view at opposite corners of the living room.
Over here, a tall cabinet, filled with trophies.
Over there, a squat plastic bin, brimming with teddy bears.
At once, they envelop those in between and inform the unknowing that Judi Brown King has been eminently successful at many more endeavors than running over hurdles.


Court Panel Says Illegal Aliens May Sue Over Pay
LEAD: A Federal appeals court here has ruled that illegal aliens who are not paid minimum wage or fairly compensated for overtime may sue employers under Federal labor laws in spite of recent changes in immigration law that prohibit employers from hiring aliens who enter this country illegally.


Farm Aid
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Two Mercedes For Each Farmer''?
Come, now, Mr.
Bovard (Business Forum, May 29), even Cato, the Censor, would resist this hyperbole!


Compounce Owner Eager to Update Park
LEAD: AMUSEMENT parks are for the young of heart, regardless of age.
No one knows that better than 79-year-old Martin C. Babicz, who went for a ride on the Wildcat roller coaster at the Lake Compounce Festival Park over the Memorial Day weekend.


What They're Wearing: Hats
LEAD: FOR SO MANY YEARS NOW, hats have been an archaic accessory.
Few stylish women wore them.
But at last, the hat seems to be returning to its rightful place as a genuine piece of chic.
These photographs, taken at a recent luncheon in the Conservatory Garden of Manhattan's Central Park and at the Winterthur Point-to-Point in Winterthur, Del., prove the point.


A Corporate Approach To Drama Behind Bars
LEAD: JOHN BERGMAN'S latest fund-raising technique is about as unusual as they come: He suggests that corporations can benefit by supporting plays for prisoners.
Eight years ago, Mr.
Bergman founded the Geese Theater Company in Spofford, N.H.
The company produces plays on the premise that theater within prisons can be a valuable teaching and therapeutic tool.


Westfield Potter Lauded
LEAD: ALBERT GREEN, a potter from Westfield, will be among 16 artists inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Crafts Council in San Diego, Calif., tomorrow night at a meeting of the council's trustees in the San Diego Museum of Art.


Why O'Neill's Ghosts Haunt Us Still
LEAD: HOW SHOULD WE BE RE-membering Eugene O'Neill today - with reverence, respect or simply a big, exhausted shrug?
Are we to regard him as a genuinely great dramatist?
Or as a figure of historical interest, important because he brought weight to the puny American theater of the early 20th century?
Or was he, could he have been, a blustering windbag whose pretensions should now be deflated by a few well-aimed critical thrusts and jabs?


A Chinatown Businessman Is Charged in a Slaying
LEAD: A prominent Chinatown businessman shot and killed an apparently armed street-gang member with a barrage of 19 bullets Thursday night in a confrontation at the businessman's office, the police reported.

A Sculptor Caught Up in His Materials
LEAD: THE EARLIEST SCULPTURE IN ''William Tucker: The American Decade, 1978-1988,'' at the Storm King Art Center, is called ''Justice.'' It dates from 1978 and is about 12 feet tall.
It is abstract and architectural.
It consists of wood beams built into an L-shaped structure, with an additional beam projecting diagonally upwards from the juncture where the two sections of the L intersect.


Jackson Returns to Chicago And Is Greeted as a Winner
LEAD: The Rev.
Jesse Jackson came home today, a winner in the eyes of those who stood by him regardless of the campaign results.


Bruce Springsteen Has a Grown-Up Way With a Song
LEAD: AS SOMEONE WHO HAS FOLlowed the career of Bruce Springsteen with interest and ambition - oh, to heck with sober critical moderation: with loving enthusiasm - for some 15 years, I took great satisfaction in his ''Tunnel of Love'' indoor-arena tour that ended recently with five shows at Madison Square Garden.


New Entry, Familiar Formula
LEAD: CAFE TESTAROSSA is creating a scene in Syosset.
It's a now-familiar formula on Long Island: dramatic, neon-highlighted decor; young, hip waiters; casual, lighthearted food, and a spiffy, sporty clientele to match.


At Croton Point, Problems Persist
LEAD: THE 600 acres of Croton Point once formed one of the largest tidal marshes on the Hudson River.
After 50 years as the site of an active county dump, however, the area is judged by environmentalists to be a health hazard.
A Federal judge last month called the landfill, which was closed in 1986, an environmental time bomb.


Why Do We Keep Old Keys? For the Memories They Unlock
LEAD: A FEW weeks ago, I received a phone call at 8 A.M.
I was already late for work, and the last thing I needed to hear was, ''Sir, we need to get into the basement of your other house to turn off the gas to replace an outside main.''


Raise Oil and Gas Prices Now
LEAD: WE need to pay greater attention to the strategic value of America's oil and gas resources.
Energy users must conserve.
Producers, transporters, distributors and regulators must run more efficient industries.
And owners must exert more responsibility to be sure domestic resources are managed better.


Review/Dance; Rod Rodgers Company at 20 Years
LEAD: Rod Rodgers has a calm yet impassioned way with dance and its rendering of the world about it.

Encounter,'' a recent work presented by the Rod Rodgers Dance Company on Friday at Theater of the Riverside Church, in a program celebrating the company's 20th anniversary.


Unilateral Disaster
LEAD: Everyone knows that the Reagan Administration's policy in Panama has been a humiliating failure.
Announced as a sure way to blow Gen.

The World: Mideast Mission; Shultz Tries Again, But Peace Seems As Elusive - And Complex - As Ever
LEAD: AS Secretary of State George P. Shultz raced around the Middle East last week, trying again to gain support from Israel and its Arab neighbors for the United States peace plan for the region, a White House spokesman was asked about chances for success.


WAITING TO HEAR THE COURT'S NINTH VOICE
LEAD: A YEAR ago, the surprise retirement of Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. handed President Reagan what seemed his best opportunity to transform the Supreme Court, perhaps even to enshrine much of his social agenda in the law of the land.

LEAD: During last year's public hearings on the Iran-contra scandal, three of the key witnesses, Rear Adm.
John Poindexter, Lieut.
Col.
Oliver North and Albert Hakim, were granted immunity in exchange for their testimony.
That immunity now jeopardizes criminal prosecutions of the three, along with a fourth alleged conspirator, Maj.


Barbara Bellantoni Weds

Edward W. Evans of Washington Township, N.J.
The Rev.
James F. X. McManus performed the Roman Catholic ceremony in the Immaculate Conception Chapel at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J.


NEW YORKERS, Etc.
LEAD: A LOT of the good old days weren't all that good, and it doesn't much matter whether the days we're thinking of were a half-century or a half-decade ago.
The fact is that a lot of them were upsetting, irritating, depressing and just plain horrible, and that they are remembered with a rosy glow only because memory is fortunately selective.


McDonald's Tries Paris, Again
LEAD: SIX years ago, McDonald's here was a model of everything the company tries not to be.
In one Paris McDonald's, raw french fries were stored next to trash bags on the basement floor.
To enter the McDonald's near the Gare St.
Lazare, customers had to pass through the arcade of a porno movie theater.


Airport Buses
LEAD: To the Editor: Regarding ''Getting to the Airport'' (Practical Traveler, March 13), my wife and I recently investigated the suggested 7B SamTrans bus from San Francisco airport into town but learned that it would leave us two longish blocks to the BART station (with luggage).


Headliners; Insensitive?
LEAD: Phil Donahue, the talk show host, wanted more space for his family, and saw no reason to let the vacant house next door stand in his way.
So he bought the unusual all-concrete house and 7.2 surrounding acres recently and had the house demolished last week.
But many in Westport, Conn., agreed with the town's architectural historian, who said the house was ''the best design in Westport.


Mary D. McGrath Becomes a Bride
LEAD: Mary Denise McGrath and George Daniel Donovan Jr. were married yesterday at St.
John and St.

Raymond T. Lahar of Pomona, Calif., took place yesterday.
The Rev.
Joan Williams performed the ceremony at the First Church of Christ, Congregational in Farmington.


A Countess's Creation
LEAD: IT stands high on the top of a windswept hill, a symbol of pride, an affirmation of style and power; but, unlike just about every other great house in England, Hardwick Hall was built to glorify a woman.
For the past 400 years, the carved stone initials and coronet of its creator, proudly cresting on the towers of the house in Derbyshire, have proclaimed to the world that, her royal namesake excepted, Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, was the most important woman in England.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: MY MOTHER'S SIN: And Other Stories.
By Georgios Vizyenos.

Prune leucothoe, pieris, azaleas, rhododendrons and other broadleaved evergreens that have bloomed; also remove faded flowers to prevent seed pod formation.


Headliners; In Pain
LEAD: Lawyers and relatives of Anne Henderson Pollard say the effect of prison life on her may be far worse than her five-year sentence would imply.

BIOTECHNOLOGY'S CASH COW
LEAD: ON THE CREST OF A HILL IN Altura, Minn., where the air is so clear the eye can fasten easily on the emerald ridges of Sugar Loaf Bluff miles to the west and the Mississippi River valley to the east, the century's third wave of farm technology has arrived in the form of a glass vial in John Kurtz's milking barn.

LEAD: INDOOR chamber music concerts and outdoor carillon concerts are annually performed at Trinity College in Hartford, and the cycles are about to begin again.


Martha Clarke's Thorny Garden
LEAD: IT'S 1:30 IN THE MORNING IN THIS historic, genteel quintessence of the South, and the only people visible at the downtown crossroads of Broad and Meeting Streets are Northerners.

Catching Speeders The Easy Way
LEAD: PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz., catches traffic speeders in a flash.


In the World of Art, a Crate Is Much More Than a Crate
LEAD: DID Michelangelo, working in his studio, worry about how to move the ''David''?
How would the old masters have dealt with a contemporary traveling show?
The complexities of the current international art scene are reflected in a special craft: the packing and shipping of art objects.
In addition to art handlers, a host of workers - from museum and gallery administrators to customs brokers and insurance agents - share the common goal of safely transporting fragile works of art.

Deficit Warning in Hartford
LEAD: Despite earlier predictions of a modest budget surplus, the Governor's budget chief now concedes that the state could end the fiscal year with a deficit and is warning state agency heads to be prepared for spending cuts next year.
The official, Anthony V. Milano, sent a letter to the state's commissioners and agency heads this week telling them their share of next year's $6.3 billion budget could be in jeopardy if revenues fall short.


SOUL-SEARCHING
LEAD: Albert Vorspan mentions ''Jewish racists'' who have Israel's Consul General in Atlanta, Mohammed Massarwa, an Arab, under fire.

Baseball; Buhner Sparks Yankees
LEAD: When Doug Sisk emerged from the Baltimore bullpen with runners on first and second and one out in the fifth inning yesterday, Jay Buhner, the rookie outfielder for the Yankees, quickly glanced at the scouting report on opposing pitchers that hangs in the team's dugout.
Unsatisfied with this preparation,


Summit Was No Place For Briefcase Rattling
LEAD: To the Editor:

NOTHING GOES RIGHT FOR LEFTIES
LEAD: The Mets zigged and zagged tonight and even started eight left-handed hitters in a strategic brainstorm aimed at breaking their slump.
But it didn't work, not even with Dwight Gooden pitching.


REDS RALLY PAST GIANTS WITH 6 RUNS IN EIGHTH INNING
LEAD: A throwing error by Matt Williams, the shortstop, scored the go-ahead run in a six-run eighth-inning rally as the Cincinnati Reds defeated the San Francisco Giants, 7-2, today.

Pitching The Big Trip
LEAD: ON A JANUARY NIGHT IN ST.
PAUL, Will Steger slipped away from the table before dessert.
In a nearby room, he studied a map by the light of a hissing, crackling fire.
With Greenland laid out like a tablecloth before him, Steger slowly traced possible routes across the polar circle.


HOW FAR CAN A MANAGER GO IN ARGUMENTS?
LEAD: Why the big fuss?
Being banished to the locker room is like being told to go to your room at home.
Fines and suspensions are the ''adult'' substitute punishments.
Kicking dirt or playing with it has its own interpretations, so obvious.


Pro Hockey; Slim Pickings for Local Clubs
LEAD: The National Hockey League conducted a sedate entry draft this afternoon.
There were no surprise trades and no infusion of prime talent for any of the three metropolitan area clubs, none of whom selected in the top 10.


CORRECTION

The top picture, of a winding path, showed irises and ferns; the smaller picture showed a shooting star flower.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Several years ago I had an underground lawn sprinkling system installed at considerable expense.
I didn't realize that I would have an expense twice a year of starting the system up each spring, then shutting it down (draining it) in the fall.
Is it possible for me to do this work myself?

Handicapped Given 'Respite Weekends'
LEAD: Measured in numbers, a trip from Harlem to Pelham, N.Y., is not very long, 20 minutes by train, about 15 miles across the Bronx.
To a handicapped girl unable to leave the city, though, Pelham is as far away as its trees and gardens are foreign.

Rags and Riches Beyond Paris

LEAD: FRANK Marshall, United States champion from 1909 to 1936, once remarked of his erstwhile opponent, the Franco-Polish luminary David Janowski, ''He follows the wrong path with more determination than any man I ever met.''


Who to Thank for the Thrift Crisis
LEAD: HOWEVER you look at them, the numbers are staggering.
Last week, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it would pay $1.35 billion to liquidate two California savings and loan associations that had gone bankrupt, producing the most expensive liquidations on record.
It will devour more than 40 percent of the cash on hand at the Government's deposit insurance fund, whose paper losses already total almost $14 billion, according to the General Accounting Office.


Strategies for the End of an Era
LEAD: FOR American business, the Reagan era had its own distinctive marks: regulation was out, mergers were in and Federal officials were passive in enforcing the thousands of Government rules that executives often see as nettlesome.
But with Mr.
Reagan's remaining term reduced to seven months, some of the most astute of corporate


Air Force Cancels Electronics Contract Handled by L.I. Company
LEAD: The Air Force has accused a large contractor of defaulting on an electronics contract handled by a Long Island subsidiary and said it was canceling the order and would demand repayment of $39 million in payments.


Overprotecting Underdogs
LEAD: Even the timetable is zany.
It starts by sending everyone to the ice of Iowa in January.
It ends, this year, in airless August, in New Orleans.
And that's not half of what's wrong with the way America nominates Presidential candidates.


Summer Homework Angers Parents
LEAD: WHAT seemed like a simple requirement from the principal of the Branford Intermediate School - that students in grades five through eight read two books during summer vacation and then be tested on them when they return to school in the fall - is angering some parents.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Several years ago I had an underground lawn sprinkling system installed at considerable expense.
I didn't realize that I would have an expense twice a year of starting the system up each spring, then shutting it down (draining it) in the fall.

Democrats Wrestle With Plank on Tax Issue
LEAD: The issue of raising taxes, the most fundamental policy difference between Michael S. Dukakis and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, was left unresolved today by Democrats working here on a first draft of their party's platform.


We Need Global Regulations for Stocks
LEAD: WE have enough of post-mortems on the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
But despite all the reports and Congressional hearings, one major aspect of stock market supervision has gone unstudied and unattended - the regulation of stocks that are issued and traded across national borders.
This is a very dangerous omission.


CENTURY CLUB AIDE LOOKING AT FIRST PGA CHECK
LEAD: Seven club professionals from the metropolitan area qualified for the Manufacturers Hanover Westchester Classic, but only Rick Meskell survived the cut.


SOUL-SEARCHING
LEAD: I deeply resent the unfair and unfounded accusations against me contained in Albert Vorspan's article ''Soul-Searching'' (May 8).
His outrageous charge that I put ''a kosher stamp on everything - shootings, deportations, excessive force,'' is belied by the series of unequivocal public statements I issued in the name of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.


Karin Anne Keitel Marries David Branch Nuckols
LEAD: At the Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church in Washington, Karin Anne Keitel, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Glenn H. Keitel of Minneapolis, was married yesterday to David Branch Nuckols, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

The Rev.

IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN: SoHo
LEAD: THAT chic and gritty district of Manhattan known as SoHo should post a warning at its borders: Only rich artists need apply.
For what was once a refuge for painters seeking cheap space to work on huge canvases has been bid up like the prices of Warhol knickknacks at a Sotheby's auction.


Audio Geared for Summertime
LEAD: WHAT ABOUT A LITtle summer music?
That's the altogether agreeable question faced by lucky listeners heading for their country homes now that the kids are out of school.
Lugging along one's regular stereo gear is probably impractical.
Very likely the speakers are too big to stash in the car, and besides, unplugging and reassembling all those components just for the summer is daunting.

Louis has perhaps gone too far in staging Samuel Barber's ''Vanessa,'' a Pulitzer Prize winner that received its premiere 30 years ago at the Metropolitan Opera.

LEAD: It isn't likely that anyone but Jacques d'Amboise would dream up a finale in which a cast of seeming thousands faces the audience and chants ''Oy, oy, vey'' at the top of its lungs.

Coming to Grips With Contemporary Sculpture
LEAD: ''SCULPTURE INSIDE OUTSIDE'' is the first museum exhibition of contemporary sculpture in a very long time that we really need.
It is a show with a point of view.
It has as much to say about art in general in the late 1980's as it does about contemporary American sculpture.
Its intelligence is such that it underlines the lack of curatorial imagination in major museum exhibitions on contemporary art in New York

The Niagara Roars On With New Twists
LEAD: A RIVER is a ribbon of continual change, a characteristic noted by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who wrote, ''It is not possible to step twice into the same river.'' A river does leave a record of its passing, however, a history that stands long after the water has flowed on.

LEAD: IT used to be that when you went to Italy, rosso or bianco was all you needed to know about wine.

THE REGION: Vallone Vs. Koch on Taxes; City Council Power Play Puts Budget Game Into Overtime
LEAD: IF only the budget negotiations that consumed City Hall last week had been merely about money, a new spending plan might have been approved by the deadline on Thursday.

Opening the first of four international music concerts produced by Verna Gillis and Soundscape under the umbrella of the First New York International Festival of the Arts, the show, which drew a mostly Indian audience of all ages, didn't come close to selling out - a surprise, since she is deservedly one of the world's most popular singers.

GARDENING MEANS WAR
LEAD: I CAME TO THE COUNTRY from the city and brought along many of the city man's easy ideas about the landscape and its inhabitants.
One had to do with the problem of pests in the garden, about which I carried the usual set of liberal views.
To nuke a garden with insecticide, to level a rifle sight at the back of a woodchuck in flat-footed retreat, to erect an electric barricade around a vegetable patch: such measures struck me as excessive, even irresponsible.

I fear that rain might cause leaching of the asbestos into the ground or make it airborne.

A Stolen Treasure Gets a New Owner

But as he lay dying of stomach cancer in a hospital in Torrington, Conn., he told his wife that the violin he had been playing at restaurants and society functions -and that he had treated quite casually - was a Stradivarius.
It had been stolen from a dressing room in Carnegie Hall in 1936, he said, and he had bought it for $100.

First-Home Help
LEAD: To the Editor:


Theories as the Building Blocks for a New Style
LEAD: THERE ARE TWO CHALLENGES presented by ''Deconstructivist Architecture,'' the new exhibition that opened Thursday at the Museum of Modern Art.
The first is the work itself, much of which is arcane, difficult and disorienting.
The second is the problem of separating this show from the flurry of controversy and media attention that has surrounded it.


Bar Mitzvah 'Twins' Meet After 2 Years
LEAD: WHEN James Karger of Bedford had his bar mitzvah two years ago, he and his family designed their own service.
Included in the prayer book, which featured a cover drawing by Jim's older sister, Jennifer, were not only traditional readings but also quotations about youth and maturity and the song ''Forever Young'' by Bob


Southern Africa Talks to Resume Next Month
LEAD: Representatives of the United States, South Africa, Cuba and Angola today ended two days of talks on the fighting in Angola and neighboring South-West Africa.


WHO WILL WIN: SPINKS OR TYSON?
LEAD: Boxer vs. puncher is a misnomer; it's nuclear arsenal vs. slingshots.
Michael Spinks is not a heavyweight.
He has neither the power to hurt Tyson nor the body to absorb Tyson's midsection missiles.
The bout is no contest.
Michael Spinks may have the greatest manager of all time.
Butch Lewis positioned him for a stratospheric payday after two waltzes with an aging shadow of a champ and two knockovers of glassjawed creampuffs.


WHO WILL WIN: SPINKS OR TYSON?
LEAD: Until now, Tyson has simply relied on brute force because that's all he needed to win.
Now, many think that Spinks can win by outfoxing, frustrating, and thereby neutralizing Tyson's strength.


Linking Open Spaces And Streetscapes

A Rescue in Texas For 2 Thrift Units
LEAD: A Phoenix savings bank agreed to acquire two ailing Texas savings and loan associations.
The move by Merabank was the first by an out-of-state institution under a Federal program to help the deeply troubled industry in Texas.
The two institutions, First Financial of El Paso and Brownfield Savings of West Texas, together have relatively small assets, $350 million, but Merabank agreed to acquire another $650 million of Texas assets by this fall.


County Faces Issue Of Sludge Disposal
LEAD: TWO times each week, a barge leaves Yonkers and moves ponderously down the Hudson, loaded with 5,000 tons of wet sludge from the Yonkers Joint Treatment Plant.
At the mouth of New York Harbor, the barge joins numerous similar vessels from New York City, New Jersey and Nassau County and the parade chugs 106 miles out to sea to dump its unwanted cargo.


Why Strauss, Why Now?
LEAD: IN BOTH HEMISPHERES, 1988 IS shaping up as the summer of Richard Strauss.
The Santa Fe Opera, whose two-month season begins on Friday, is nearing completion of its decades-long project to present all of the Strauss operas.
This year, there will be a double bill of his rare ''Feuersnot'' and ''Friedenstag,'' leaving only two more to go.


SPREADING THE GOSPEL AT HARVARD
LEAD: I am stunned that one of the world's foremost theologians would suggest that a child can grow up in both Jewish and Christian traditions and not violate either one (''Spreading the Gospel at Harvard,'' by Dan Wakefield, May 22).


Italy Reclaims Its Treasures From the Past
LEAD: POSTERITY MAY SEE THE YEAR 1988 as one in which there was at last a turn for the better in the long and grim story of Italy's irresponsibility toward her patrimony.
As a repository of great art and a living museum of great architecture, Italy has few rivals, past or present.
But also, and above all since World War

Play's the Thing
LEAD: ''ALL THE ENTERTAINMENT that people used to go out for can now come into the home,'' Edwin Schlossberg says. ''I wanted to create something you can't do at home, where you appreciate the presence of other people.'' Better known, perhaps, for his marriage to Caroline Kennedy, the founder of Edwin Schlossberg Inc.


Mr. Bush, Meet Mr. Lincoln
LEAD: When he received an honorary degree at all-black Central State University recently, Vice President George Bush vowed to ''knock down the walls of indifference'' to minorities. ''We must take specific steps to include those who have been excluded,'' he said, asserting by way of illustration that his own party must ''broaden its base.

Bed and Breakfast, Southern Style
LEAD: WITHIN the past decade a good deal has been written about the virtues of bed-and-breakfast lodgings, a concept borrowed from small private hostelries in Britain.
The idea being, of course, that you check into a private home to spend a night or two and awaken to the smell of freshly brewed coffee, homemade muffins and the sounds of birds chirping or a lawn mower whirring outside the window.


Pioneer in Children's Day Care Turns 110
LEAD: WHILE dozens of Connecticut day-care centers come and go each year, the Leila Day Nursery in New Haven is celebrating its 110th anniversary this year.

BILL COSBY, IS sitting in his living room.
His wife, Clair, walks in from the kitchen. ''Are you free Thursday at four?'' she asks.

It's late Friday afternoon.
Huxtable's son-in-law, Elvin, comes into the kitchen.
Clair, dressed for success in a stunning beige blouse and skirt, takes a roast out of the oven and bastes it.


Riviera Sampler: Cote of Many Colors
LEAD: IN the 1920's, Sara and Gerald Murphy, the wealthy American expatriates (''Living well is the best revenge'' was their motto), made the area around Cap d'Antibes popular for affluent, artsy Americans, attracting such guests as F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda.


SYMMETRY, NOT SUMMITRY
LEAD: AMERICAN POLICY toward the Soviet Union is essentially made at the top.
Congressmen and commentators, the expert and the influential, public opinion and the press, all now play significantly greater roles in foreign affairs decision making than they did during my years in the White House.
But in our relations with the world's only other superpower, both the tone and the direction of our posture are primarily set by the man whose finger is on the button.


IN HEADY MOSCOW, POLITICAL FERMENT
LEAD: A delegate arriving in Moscow today from the provinces for the Communist Party's national conference next week might well have thought that the Soviet capital had become detached from reality.


Spanish-Language TV: An Even Better Reception
LEAD: SPANISH-LANGUAGE radio and television stations have proliferated steadily over the years.
Now, through an influx of corporate advertising money, such stations are becoming more profitable and are giving non-Hispanic stations and networks competition.


Montville Is Designated For Its Second Prison
LEAD: THE state has chosen Montville, already the site of a 240-inmate prison, as the site for a 400-bed medium-security institution.


Mets Fall as Tempers and Temperature Flare
LEAD: Hot temperatures and hot tempers flared at Wrigley Field today as the Mets and Chicago Cubs struggled and scuffled in 103-degree weather.
But the Cubs withstood the heat from all sides and scored three runs in the eighth inning to defeat the Mets again, 5-2.


Zoning: The Urban Power Tool for the 90's
LEAD: OVER its brief history, zoning has acquired an image of protectionism.
Deservedly so, in many cases.


Portraits Return in a New Perspective
LEAD: HALFWAY INTO 1988, AND MUCH more than halfway through a decade of photography largely given over to appropriation and tableaux, portraiture has acquired a renewed sense of currency.
In New York there are now three powerful exhibitions devoted to images of the human visage: ''Real Faces'' at the Philip Morris branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art, ''Portraits in the Time of AIDS'' at the Grey Art Gallery of New York University and an untitled show of four photographers' work at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery.


Move Over, Harvey, and Meet Peter B. Rabbit (B as in Bunny)
LEAD: MY grandson, William, and his mother and father and 1 1/2-year-old sister, Emily, recently moved to the Philadelphia area from Washington, D.C.
This makes it easier for us to see them but no less expensive to talk to them on the telephone between visits.
I think that this is because William appears to have inherited a tendency toward long-windedness from his mother and grandmother.


E. German Track Women Have World on Run Again
LEAD: The parade began with Sabine Busch and continued with Petra Felke, Marlies Gohr, Silke Gladisch Moller and Heike Drechsler.
After three hours at the East Germany national track and field championships, it was pretty clear whose women's team is expected to dominate the Olympic Games in Seoul, South


WATERFRONT
LEAD: ROMANTIC IMAGES OF DILAPIDATED waterfront shacks and widow's walks, blinking lighthouses and abandoned shipwrecks make islands irresistible places for architects to build.
Even those who normally wouldn't dream of tackling residential work often find the offer to build an island home too tempting to refuse.


U.S. GRAIN STOCKS PLUNGE AS BUYERS REACT TO DROUGHT
LEAD: The worst drought in half a century is causing traders, grain companies and warehouse operators to buy record amounts of grain and soybeans from the Government, drawing down stocks owned and managed by the Department of Agriculture more quickly than at any time since the early 1970's.


Technology Gets a Helping Hand from Uncle Sam
LEAD: THANKS to the Federal Government, technology companies have become among the fastest-growing Hispanic businesses.
The boom has come, in part, from the Section 8(a) of the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Act, which sets aside a certain number of noncompetitive contracts for minority-owned businesses.


Thomas J. Main Weds Carla T. Post, a Lawyer
LEAD: Carla Tanya Post, the daughter of Edith E. Post of Cedarhurst, L.I., and the late Albert Post, and Thomas James Main were married yesterday at the home of the bridegroom's father and stepmother, George J. Main and Maureen E. Main, in Huntington Station, L.I.
Rabbi Nathaniel Schwartz officiated.


Headliners; Shod?
LEAD: Bidding $165,000 last week for a pair of the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' the fashionably dressed anonymous buyer showed a reticence that would have embarrassed the Cowardly Lion.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: THE PIGEON.
By Patrick Suskind.
Translated by John E. Woods. (Knopf, $14.95.) Poor Jonathan Noel is having a bad day.
That is an event in itself, since Noel, a Paris bank guard ''already past fifty,'' has fashioned a life so sedate and circumscribed that nothing out of the ordinary ever shatters its smooth surface.


Abby Johnson Has Wedding
LEAD: At the Nahant Village Church in Nahant, Mass., Abigail Pierrepont Johnson, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward C. Johnson 3d of Boston and Nahant, was married yesterday to Christopher John McKown, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

The Rev.
Margaret B. Gunness, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony.


THE SUNBURNED BRAIN AND KAFKA'S POSTCARDS
LEAD: LAST summer on my vacation I reread ''Remembrance of Things Past.'' On rainy days, on the beach, before going to sleep, I journeyed through dependent clauses, I swam in syntax.
The trouble was that when I finished I was talking in these rhythms.
Once you get into Proust, you can't get out.
People began to move away from me at the beach, at cocktail parties.


Reviews/Music; Bernstein's Vision of Shostakovich
LEAD: The 20th-century-only policy of the New York International Festival of the Arts, though it is far too broad to provide any real focus for the musical programs, has one distinctly beneficial effect: The visiting American orchestras are compelled to present the mid-century classics they tend to play best, and are prevented from padding them, as they otherwise would, with the Beethoven and


Deborah Kesselman, A Lawyer, Is Married
LEAD: Deborah Kesselman, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur Kesselman of Woodmere, L.I., and Joseph Giovanniello Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.

TALKING: Old Houses; Inspection Critical for The Buyer
LEAD: BUYERS of old houses are the stuff of legend.
They walk into a vintage house - normally built before 1930 - and fall in love with its nooks and crannies, wide floorboards, moldings and trim and the ghost who lives in the hall closet.
And before an hour is up they are hooked.


On the Danube
LEAD: To the Editor: I read with interest the article on the Danube Princess (Travel, March 20).
Having made the Danube cruise on that ship two years ago, we would agree that it is a pleasing itinerary and the Danube Princess is generally a good river cruise vessel.
I can't help wondering, however, whether the operation still suffers from some inadequacies that we experienced: (1) no life jackets on board; (2) student dining room personnel who, despite enthusiasm and pleasantness, were quite untrained and unable to serve simultaneously the four persons at our table, and (3) a musical ensemble for

LEAD: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT, CONGRESS, AND JUDICIARY.
Edited by William T. Golden. (Pergamon, Cloth, $49.95; Paper, $24.95.)

Fresh and Economical Tex-Mex
LEAD: ADD the Southwest Cafe in Ridgefield to the growing list of restaurants that cater to people and families on budgets.
The prices are so low and the space so limited one wonders how management can make a profit.


2 workers killed in plant shooting
LEAD: A security guard, apparently frustrated with his job, shot six employees Friday night at the plant where he works, the police said.
Two people died and one was in critical condition.


THE NATION: Before and After Atlanta; In His Way, Jesse, Too, Asks, 'What Does Jackson Want?'

LEAD:  Oct. 21 - Boris N. Yeltsin, in an outburst at a closed meeting of the Party Central Committee, attacks colleague Yegor K. Ligachev, the No. 2 party leader, as an obstructionist; Yeltsin announces his resignation as Moscow party chief and is later dropped from Politburo.
Caution sets in among the perestroika vanguard.


Eye of the Beholder
LEAD: The beauty contest, approaching anachronism in the West, emerges in the East.
The preliminaries of the Beijing Flower pageant took place in late May.
The first beauty contest in more than 40 years in a city where the very concept of beauty had been declared ''feudalistic'' began with a flourish.


ABOUT BOOKS
LEAD: Why not take a cue from the season and let summer reading inspire new excursions?  ''The Poconos: An Illustrated Natural History Guide,'' by Carl S. Oplinger and Robert Halma (Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick; $30; paper, 12.95), opens our eyes to the wonder of the Poconos, the 2,000-square-mile plateau just past New Jersey's western border.


The Problems In Hempstead

LEAD:  BORGE IN HOLMDEL  Victor Borge, who can wring more comedy from a piano keyboard than any man or woman alive, will perform with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra Wednesday evening at the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel.


Wimbledon; Connors Outlasts Rostagno
LEAD: All the years may have robbed him of a step.
There's a foot injury that will heal only when he retires, and some of the sting may have gone from Jimmy Connors's racquet as well.
But age has not robbed him of willpower, a refusal to give in that borders on stubbornness.
At 35, there is little that Connors enjoys more than victory on the tennis court.


Kathleen Geagan Weds

Grilled FisH is Just The Thing on Warm Summer Evening
LEAD: ON a hot summer evening one of the best - and easiest -things to cook is fish, broiled outdoors.
Perhaps the most useful investment you can make is in a two-sided grill, so that you can turn the fish without breaking it.
The coals should be red hot and the fish grilled about five inches away from them.

Mothers Deserve A Better Reception
LEAD: How much better it would have been if you had simply let Mother's Day pass unmentioned rather than have yourself represented by the sad, cynical column by Barbara Klaus  [ Long Island Sound ] .

Pervasive Problems Threaten New York's Economic Base

Grilled FisH is Just The Thing on Warm Summer Evening

Being There, At a Price
LEAD: As almost any Englishman can attest, the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is something of a misnomer, reflecting the same linguistic license by which such exclusive boarding schools as Eton and Harrow are termed public schools.

Pasadena's Parade Of 50's Collectibles
LEAD: PASADENA is an old-money city where families like the Huntingtons of the Southern Pacific Railroad, the Wrigleys of Wrigley's gum, and the Gambles of Procter &amp; Gamble built mansions, now museums, and where Los Angeles glitter was consciously eschewed in favor of a low-keyed elegance.
This difference remains apparent in revealing details: the casually conservative dress of men and women in Pasadena, and the Eastern-college look of its young people.


Why Pressure The Graduate?
LEAD: James B. Schomburg's advice to recent graduates (''Advice for the Bewildered Graduate: Relax,'' Opinion page, May 22) comes as a relief, I suspect, to many dazed recent graduates who have just received their sheepskin eviction notices (as the president of my alma mater put it) from colleges and universities around the country.

Diane Keaton Grapples With Sex and Maternity
LEAD: WHEN LEONARD NIMOY asked Diane Keaton to star in the movie version of ''The Good Mother,'' she was horrified - a response she recalled later in a characteristically Keatonesque volley of breathless, rapid-fire speech, her words tumbling out and ricocheting off each other at crazy angles as she rolled her eyes, buried her face in her hands, fidgeted and made assorted moaning noises.

The F.B.I.'s War on Spies in the Stacks
LEAD: BY tradition and in most states by law, the relationship between libraries and readers is a private one.

Weighing the Soviet Party Congress
LEAD: Moscow's Americanologists assiduously analyze every Presidential election, trying to figure out the next twist and turn in United States policy.

Headliners; Shunned

Hemlock Troubles
LEAD: WATER.
Shallow-rooted woody plants such as azaleas, rhododendrons, pieris, fruit trees, saplings and container gardens have priority; do not neglect them.

If there are no local restrictions, run sprinklers slowly to soak water deeply into root zones.

Flanagan's Further Version
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Birth Pangs of Romanticism
LEAD: IT IS THE LESSER COMPOSERS OF the early 19th century who show us how slow and painful the birth of Romanticism really was.
At ahistorical distance, the grandeur of Berlioz and the free flights of Schumann appear as faits accomplis, a sort of stylistic ''big bang.'' Yet composers such as Berwald, Kuhlau, Hummel, Moscheles, Danzi and Spohr portray something quite different - a tension between the self-imposed limits of the Classical era and the erosive liberality that


Headliners; Shushed
LEAD: Among the most avid listeners of Radio Free Europe are some of its most avid critics - Soviet bloc government officials.
The Polish Government, for one, expressed its disagreement by simply jamming Radio Free Europe broadcasts.

Q and A
LEAD:  New Hampshire


'The Mind With the Dirty Man'
LEAD: ONCE the action begins, it doesn't take too much imagination to figure out the plot of ''The Mind With the Dirty Man,'' by Jules Tasca, which is currently at the Arena Players Second Stage Theater.

Magnuson Suffers Attack

The basement is otherwise unfinished and has ''French drains'' around the edges of the floor and a sump pump to remove excess water.
Recently I have noticed patches of a white, fluffy material on the basement floor.
Someone told me this was ''cotton mold,'' so I treated the floor three times with bleach and water, each time with a stronger solution.


Mexican Roses
LEAD: To the Editor: The Travel Advisory chart ''The Subject Is Roses'' (Travel, May 1) confirms my suspicion about the way most writers approach third world countries.
If one looks for prices comparable to those one expects to pay, then - of course - there will be someplace you can buy whatever it is at an inflated price.

AFTER THE KILLING FIELDS

It echoes through his account of the destruction of the last refuge left to him as his Cambodian culture disintegrates: his family.


POETIC INJUSTICE
LEAD: I am aware that there has existed a long tradition of poets' feeling abused and misunderstood by an insensitive public.
However, I would like to suggest to Mr.
Dana that the problems of isolation and lack of support may lie more with the poets than the culture.
Much American poetry has become increasingly hybridized, aloof, conceptual, and has lost the common thread that would make it sing to the public.

POSTINGS: Off New Haven's Green; Second Edition
LEAD: The 1911 Central Library in New Haven was intended by Cass Gilbert to be distinctly neo-Georgian.
But will the library's 65,000-square-foot addition, almost twice the size of the original, also be neo-Georgian? ''I don't think Gilbert would think so, no,'' said Hugh Hardy, the architect.
The original reflects the look of the three Colonial churches on the Green, which it faces across Elm

Cornerman With the Aura of a Champion
LEAD: REGARDLESS of the outcome of the Tyson-Spinks title bout tomorrow, the stories Tuesday will at least mention the name Cus D'Amato.
Since we first heard of Mike Tyson's promising punches, we also heard of his mentor, legal guardian and savior, Cus.
Even three years after D'Amato's death, Iron Mike defines himself daily by his father-figure's credo.

Illustrated. 270 pp.
New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company. $16.95.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My house has a full basement with a concrete floor.
The basement is otherwise unfinished and has ''French drains'' around the edges of the floor and a sump pump to remove excess water.
Recently I have noticed patches of a white, fluffy material on the basement floor.
Someone told me this was ''cotton mold,'' so I treated the floor three times with bleach and water, each time with a stronger solution.

Damn the Barricades! Bring On a Good Revue!
LEAD: I KNEW I WAS BEING RIDICULOUS, and yet there was some sense in my little daydream.
About three-quarters through one of those big - very big - British musicals that are sweeping all before them these Broadway nights, I suddenly fancied that a backdrop descended.
It was a white backdrop, glistening in its purity and reflecting light like crazy, and all over it were splashed meteorlike sweeping strokes of red and green and yellow and blue, with joyous curlicues of leftover purple paint dancing here and there in the empty spaces.


STEPS TO CONTROL SURROGATE BIRTHS REKINDLE DEBATE
LEAD: Five months after the Supreme Court of New Jersey outlawed commercial contracts for women to bear children for others there, many state legislatures are moving to impose regulations, outright bans and even prison terms.


WHO WILL WIN: SPINKS OR TYSON?
LEAD: This fight is not about pugilistic skills.
This fight is about money.
If the expected gross of this fight is $70 million, can you imagine what the gross on a rematch would be if Spinks beats Tyson? $100 million? $120 million?
I predict that fight will go all the way and Spinks will win by a split decision.


Big-Band Jazzmen and Rap Musicians: Soulmates
LEAD: A BIG BAND INTENT ON making people dance is an instrument hellbent on being extreme.
One minute a reed section will whisper impossibly rich, velvety sighs; the next, mountains will collapse onstage, in perfect rhythm.
Unlike small group jazz, where musical arrangements work surreptitiously to give the impression of naturalism - four or five people improvising simultaneously - large band arrangements, at their glossiest, revel in the details of their rococo, obviously man-made splendor.


After 25-Year Hiatus, a Writer Finds a Publisher
LEAD: For many writers, a 25-year dry spell would be discouraging enough to quit writing.

In the Clubhouse
LEAD: ' It may well be that a considerable amount of private or intimate association occurs in such a setting, as is also true in many restaurants and other places of public accommodation, but that fact alone does not afford the entity as a whole any constitutional immunity to practice discrimination when the Government has barred it from doing so.

Affordable Housing: The Continuing Quest
LEAD: David Emilita's letter to the Long Island editor on May 29 in response to Charles Mancini's letter on April 24 should not go unanswered.
While trying to assess blame for the failure to build affordable housing on Long Island (at either end) may be an interesting exercise, it won't produce any of this much needed commodity.

LURE OF THE LOIRE
LEAD: ONE CHILLY NIGHT MANY years ago, I wandered into a pleasant looking restaurant in Tours, looking for some dinner.
I had plenty of time; I was alone and had nothing to do until the next day, when I was meeting a friend.

State-of-the-Market Heavy Metal, Stuck in 1975
LEAD: YOU MAY HEAR A RUMBLE this afternoon and tomorrow from the direction of East Rutherford, N.J.

NEW YORKERS, Etc.

The Arts Festival; Some Choreographers Step Out To Speak Out on Dance's Future

LEAD: Senior Administration officials said today that the Iraqi recapture of the Majnoon Islands was a major victory.


The Credit Card Wars
LEAD: JUST when you felt one more credit card might cause your wallet to explode, the mail comes.

The Rocky Road to Tenant Management

But this is no sitcom.
The DeLucas are characters in new commercials for Ragu Foods, produced by an ad agency, Waring &amp; L


Aussie Tough
LEAD: I OFTEN THINK I MUST be a disappointment to my American friends.
For the idea that the movie hero Crocodile Dundee, played by Paul Hogan, has planted in the popular American imagination is that Australian men are tough in a peculiar, antipodean way.
It's an un-self-conscious toughness achieved with a sort of shrugging, Celtic whimsy and fatalism relocated from the auld places, Scotland and Ireland, to another place.


WHAT'S DOING IN: Boston
LEAD: One day this month, winter turned to summer in Boston.
Suddenly, it is hot and humid, and the breeze at harborside, where downtown workers seek relief at lunch, does not help.

A Virus Carries Fatal Complications

'Jury Is Still Out' On Pre-K Benefits
LEAD: In his letter to the Long Island editor on June 5, Thomas Meehan, pre-K coordinator of the Middle Country Central School District, Jericho, avoids the issue I raised on May 8  [ ''Are Schools Just a Line on the Welfare Budget?,'' Opinion Page ] : what happens if and when we look to our schools first for social services, and only second for education - and instead defends his turf, pre-K.


Dukakis Holiday: The Reading Is Serious but the Shoes Aren't
LEAD: Unlike many New Englanders who flock to this picturesque island for vacation, Michael S. Dukakis is not reading fiction and is not going to the movies this weekend.

WHO WILL WIN: SPINKS OR TYSON?
LEAD: The Spinks-Tyson bout will end between rounds seven and nine with Tyson catching up, and stopping his courageous but outgunned challenger.

Spinks has not had a fight since he stopped the Great Pretender, Gerry Cooney, last June.


Is the Documentary Making a Comeback?
LEAD: THE INDEPENDENT DOCUMENTARY is showing tentative but heartening signs of renewed life on television these days.
Consider this past week's broadcasts of Frederick Wiseman's nine-hours-plus ''Deaf and Blind'' on Channel 13 and next week's debut, on July 5, of the 10-part series called ''P.O.V.,'' a film-making term meaning point of view.

POEM BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE! READ ALL ABOUT IT!
LEAD: ''I COULD die.
Why oh why/Did I look in that book?'' Peter Levi must have asked himself that question more than once in recent weeks, as I have asked it many times in the last three years.
Mr.

In 1985 I made a similar claim about an untitled poem in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, which begins ''Shall I die?

CRIME
LEAD: Gerald Petievich, formerly a Treasury Department agent, attracted a good deal of attention in 1981 with his first book -really two novellas - named ''Money Men and One-Shot Deal.''

New Series Mixes Classical and Pop
LEAD: A FEW weeks ago, we were all saddened to hear of the demise of the Summer Music on the Hudson Festival -popularly known as the Lyndhurst concerts because they took place on the grounds of that landmark Tarrytown estate.
There will, however, be music at Lyndhurst this summer after all; not orchestral concerts, it's true, but an intriguing new threeweek, six-performance series called ''Sunset Serenades.


Practical Traveler; How Airlines Pick the Movies
LEAD: GUESS who's having a European film festival?
Swissair, among other institutions.
While one wouldn't switch to a Swissair flight just to catch up with ''My Life as a Dog'' or ''Au Revoir, Les Enfants,'' the festival may be an attraction to passengers suffering fatigue from ''Three Men and a Baby.''


Thriftoholic Time
LEAD: ''NOBODY with 42 black pocketbooks can be all bad,'' I mutter mockingly in my best W. C. Fields imitation, and blindly increase the mountainous pile on the bedroom floor designated for the thrift shop.
Yes, it's once again time for the change-of-season purification ritual.


Children's Books That Enchanted
LEAD: HUMPTY DUMPTY SAT on a wall.
For Italians, on the other hand, ''La sul gran muro Umtio Dumtio sedeva.'' In Latin, the downfall of Humtius Dumtius is the stuff of which epics are made; and if you speak Welsh, you can learn about the sad fate of Hwmti Dwmti.


Small Businesses That Are Winners
LEAD: SMALL business is big business.
More than 17 million Americans own the small businesses that provide more than two-thirds of all new jobs in the country, 40 percent of the aggregate national output, and the bulk of new products and technologies.


A Proliferation Of Poster Art
LEAD: THE POPULARITY OF POSTERS - collected in waves since they were new in the 1890's - is once again on the rise.
Spurred by the art-collecting boom of the 1980's, poster galleries flourish, specialty auctions register record prices and steady crowds file through the most comprehensive exhibition on the subject held in New York to date - the Museum of Modern Art's show ''The Modern Poster.


POSTINGS: Feds in Foley Square; G.S.A. Wish List
LEAD: This time the Federal Government is asking for a lot.
It wants two large buildings erected for it in lower Manhattan; it wants them ready by the end of 1992; it wants someone else to put up the money, and it wants good architecture.


SAVINGS AND LOAN REGULATOR: M. Danny Wall; Staying Calm - Maybe Too Calm - in the Midst of a Crisis
LEAD: M. DANNY WALL calls himself an optimist.
To make the point, he pulls a tortoise-shell comb from his pants pocket.
Mr.
Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, has but a modest rim of hair on his head.


Gender Gaps
LEAD: To the Editor:


Shifting Standards for Sovereignty
LEAD: The pious principles of ''national sovereignty'' and ''nonintervention'' have never been absolute except in oratory.
They did serve, though, to provide certain standards in a disorderly world and afford arguments to the weak against the strong.


Grilled FisH is Just The Thing on Warm Summer Evening
LEAD: ON a hot summer evening one of the best - and easiest -things to cook is fish, broiled outdoors.
Perhaps the most useful investment you can make is in a two-sided grill, so that you can turn the fish without breaking it.
The coals should be red hot and the fish grilled about five inches away from them.


Economic Axioms
LEAD: To the Editor:


When a Sidewalk Tilts
LEAD: CONCRETE sidewalk slabs sometimes settle unevenly if soil beneath them compacts or is washed away.


P.L.O. Agrees on $50 Million to Finance Uprising
LEAD: Leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization have overcome sharp differences and set aside $50 million to support the six-month-old Arab uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories, Palestinian representatives said today.


Samuelson Out
LEAD: SHE won the 1984 Olympic marathon in Los Angeles, but a heavy schedule and the birth of a daughter last fall led Joan Benoit Samuelson to pass up a bid for the women's marathon at the 1988 Games in Seoul.
Instead, she said, she would try for the 10,000-meter race.
Now, after thinking things over, the 31-year-old


D'Artagnan on Ninth Street: A Brooklyn Boy at the Library
LEAD: THE library was on Sixth Avenue and Ninth Street on the south slopes of the Brooklyn hills and for a long time in my young life it was the true center of the world.

BOUNTIFUL BASIN
LEAD: IT'S ALMOST HUMOROUS THAT Mediterranean food has been named the latest culinary trend, considering all the shores that touch on the Mediterranean sea.
Morocco, Algeria, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel and Egypt embrace such a vast territory that the cuisine could hardly be contained in a neat definition.


Correction
LEAD: A caption accompanying the article about Thomas Krens incorrectly described his association with the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.
He will serve on the commission that will oversee its creation and operation.


CORRECTION
LEAD: A listing in By the Numbers last Sunday gave an incorrect score for Margaret Court's singles victory over Billie Jean King in the 1970 final at Wimbledon.
It was 14-12, 11-9.


WAR AT SEA
LEAD: The glory of the America's Cup is that it continues a tradition of mankind thousands of years old - namely, man triumphing against the sea.
With the advent of the ''maxi'' versus the ''cat'' competition, as described in your article, the test becomes one of competing technologies only.
Michael Fay's ''anything goes'' campaign is a call to the designer, not the sailor.


Albany Notes; Mario Cuomo Rediscovers 'Real People'
LEAD: Drivers here might want to be a little more cautious next time they ignore a stop sign or run a red light.
The driver in the next car just might be Mario Cuomo.


Review/Music; Hilton Ruiz's Eclectic Jazz
LEAD: Hilton Ruiz opened the JVC Jazz Festival's piano-solo series (and the festival itself) with an ambitiously eclectic recital Friday afternoon at Weill Hall.
Until the hall management started flashing the house lights, Mr.
Ruiz touched on styles from ragtime to be-bop to free jazz, with plenty of stops in between.

LEAD: Nearly eight years after the Government dissolved the Polish section of the International PEN club, the Communist authorities are wrestling with the question of whether to reinstate it.


School in Illinois Cited For Asbestos Removal
LEAD: Workers removing old floor tiles at a suburban high school sent clouds of dust containing asbestos into the air, Federal officials charged Friday.

LEAD: At the Plymouth Congregational Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn Heights, Diana Williams, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
William M. Williams of Brooklyn and Strafford, Vt., was married yesterday to Steven Eric Peter, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Sheldon D. Peter of Jackson Heights, Queens.
The Rev.
Frank A.


A Cure for New-Music Guilt
LEAD: ADVERTISERS AND OTHER ASTUTE PROPAGANDISTS know that guilt is one of the great motivators.
No wonder you aren't as thin as Cher: you butter your toast and don't eat enough Yummy Bran.
No wonder your life is a mess: you need the Handy Day-by-Day Organizer, $20, order now, not available in stores.
At what moment in history promoters of new music recognized the potential power of guilt is not clear, but it has been their principal weapon against audiences during this century in the battle to pump new blood into the repertory.

Review/Television; Moyers, Campbell and Life's Essence
LEAD: When pressed to define American television at its best, I find myself frequently mentioning the name of Bill Moyers.
The point is, at bottom, a matter of the medium taking itself seriously rather than merely going for the obvious.
