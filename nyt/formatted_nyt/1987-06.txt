Quotation of the Day

SHELLS FROM TOO FAR AWAY
LEAD: A FRIEND of mine, with a summer house on the dunes, once thought it would be a good idea to get his two pre-teen-age daughters started on a seashell collection.
This was not only to teach them the fun of collecting and classifying objects (my friend has a fascinating collection of stocks and bonds), but also to teach them the joy of leisurely early morning walks along our Atlantic beaches on the East


BEDFORD-STUYVESANT RENEWAL: A SPURT IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY
LEAD: Two decades after the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn was rocked by riots, litter-strewn streets, ramshackle tenements and street corners crowded with drug dealers are still common.


AN EPIC STRUGGLE FOR GOLD
LEAD: It is a staggering scene, seeming to belong in a time in which slaves built monumental works for pharaohs and kings.
The ancient, frenzied dream of gold has drawn 400,000 people across the wilderness of Brazil.
Digging in the Amazon forests, diving into rivers and gnawing at mountainsides, they move with the rainy season and rumors of new sites.


SERCHING FOR A NEW FACE
LEAD: A GOVERNOR considering a Presidential bid is confronted with newspaper reports that he committed adultery.
A Congressman with no Presidential ambitions acknowledges his homosexuality.

All were reminders that Gary Hart's withdrawal from the Democratic


British Business
LEAD: To the Editor:


THE DANCE: SALLY GROSS'S DOMAIN
LEAD: SALLY GROSS might have been a witch or magician in other times.
All she has to do to weave a spell, it seems, is walk onto the stage and begin to move in that strangely drowsy but focused way of hers.
The elements are simple, with much of the dancing performed in silence.
She has gathered around her other women performers who form a kind of understated family group.


O'NEILL COUNTS HIS SUCCESSES IN '87 ASSEMBLY
LEAD: AS the General Assembly was winding up its work before adjourning last Wednesday, Governor O'Neill commented that few items of critical importance remained to be acted upon.


THE QUILTED GIRAFFE TO MOVE AND REOPEN IN ITS CAFE SPACE
LEAD: The Quilted Giraffe, applauded as one of New York's best restaurants, will close June 26 while its owners, Barry and Susan Wine, vacation for three weeks in Japan.

Hospitals Must Define Policies On Resuscitation
LEAD: As medical advances make it easier to extend the lives of terminally ill patients, doctors have increasingly made use of the do-not-resuscitate order.

Rhymes For The Times

Wichita Falls Fall, With Niagara Help
LEAD: The original falls were washed away more than 100 years ago, but town officials have made an honest city of Wichita Falls with the grand opening of a $400,000 man-made waterfall.


EXPLORING AYUTTHAYA BY CANAL BOAT
LEAD: Four hours upriver from Bangkok on the Chao Phraya River - or perhaps 60 minutes, if you decide to risk your life in one of those pencil-slim, waterborne Concordes currently favored by Thailand's gondoliers - lies a most spectacular ruin, much visited, but very little known.
Ayutthaya was the capital of Siam for more than four centuries - from 1350 until 1767, when the Burmese sacked it and trampled everyone to pieces with their elephant cavalry.


SOME DISSIDENTS FEAR CHURCH HAS REJECTED SOLIDARITY
LEAD: IN a roundtable discussion published in Tygodnik Mazowsze, the most popular of Solidarity's underground publications, a group of social activists discussed this week's visit to Poland of Pope John Paul II with a sadness bordering, in some cases, on rejection.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD:  TEMPTING FATE.
By Laurie Alberts. (Houghton Mifflin, $17.95.) The state of Alaska, disconnected from the rest of the country, has much in common with the characters in Laurie Alberts's first novel, ''Tempting Fate.'' Alaska is separate, little explored and cold.
So are many of the characters.
A disconsolate Russian, a hell-bent Indian and a flaky dropout from New England move about the little island of Vladimir, salmon fishing for a living and getting potted the rest of the time in local saloons.


LEARNING AND LIVING THE CONSTITUTION
LEAD: ON Monday, Sept. 17, 1787 -following nearly four months of debate - representatives from 12 states, gathered at a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, approved a proposed ''Constitution of the United States of America.''

'MARRY ME A LITTLE' PLAYING IN STMAFORD
LEAD: FORMULA for an instant musical hit: gather a cornucopia of random, rare songs by the premier composer of contemporary theater music, Stephen Sondheim.
Create a visual, unspoken context, involving two lonely characters, so that a story line emerges through the lyrics.
Then get a couple of expert performers (Robert Yacko and Nancy Opel) and a director who has been acclaimed for his way with Sondheim shows (Fran Soeder).

CORRECTIONS
LEAD: An article in the Arts and Leisure section on May 24 about new theatrical producers incorrectly characterized David Rabe's ''Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel.'' The first production, in 1971, was produced by Joseph Papp.

POPE, WITH REAGAN, URGES AN END TO ARMS RACE
LEAD: Pope John Paul II made a new appeal for an end to the arms race today, telling President Reagan in a Vatican meeting that that would liberate ''immense resources that can be used to alleviate misery and feed millions of hungry human beings.''


A CHILD'S SAFETY ON VACATION
LEAD: Hotels, resorts and even cruise ships advertise that they have places for the younger kids to stay and play while the parents partake of a little adult-quality time.
Sometimes the facilities are merely supervised reading rooms or playgrounds but some are full-fledged day camps; some may come with the room rate and for others there is an extra charge.


Sicilian Heritage
LEAD: To the Editor: ''The Sights and Tastes of Sicily'' (Travel, April 26), particularly the articles on Sicilian country eating by Mary Taylor Simeti and on tracing Norman rulers by Louis Inturrisi, flooded my heart with joyous nostalgia because of my own Sicilian ancestry.


Do You Like All the Home Runs This Years
LEAD: The beautiful dynamic of the game of baseball, moving the runner from base to base, and finally scoring, is utterly destroyed by the cheap home run.
Four or five home runs in a game plus the use of the designated hitter means that strategy is no longer a part of baseball.


Art
LEAD: Joan Miro was a major figure in European art for the greater part of his very long life.
He could do whatever he wanted.
He could paint.
He could make prints.
He could build constructions that still astonish us, after more than 50 years, by their freshness and originality.
He could design for the theater.


Nicaragua Cuts Back on Fuel Because of War
LEAD: Nicaragua's President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, announced a cutback in fuel supplies today and warned Nicaraguans of the need for more severe economic restrictions because of the growing cost of the civil war.


A 5-DAY HIKE IN THE VALAIS OF SWITZERLAND
LEAD: The Valais is a region of soaring beauty.
Visible from its trails are Switzerland's highest mountains and two of Europe's most formidable peaks, Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn.
But for ordinary hikers the lure is the series of north-south valleys forged by the tributaries of the Rhone.
These allow access to gentler summits and scenic treks from village to village in a single day.


CHANGING NAMES? YOU CAN BANK ON IT
LEAD: I HAVE a rather small bank account - $11.47, to be exact - at First Atlantic, which used to be called Queen City Savings, which used to be called Capital Savings &amp; Loan, which used to be called Cranford Savings &amp; Loan, which is why I opened the account in the first place.
It had such a nice local ring to it.


Sex, Money and the Press
LEAD: This is an attempt to examine some questions about the press.

IF THE FAUCET WON'T STOP DRIPPING, HERE'S WHAT TO DO
LEAD: When a conventional washer-type faucet has to be excessively tightened down each time you shut it off in order to keep it from dripping, or when the faucet develops a drip that won't stop no matter how hard you tighten it, then prompt repairs are advisable to keep things from getting worse - for example, to keep from damaging the faucet seat and possibly causing extensive damage to the faucet stem itself.

LEAD: Vigorous police work in southern Thailand has sharply reduced pirate attacks on Vietnamese refugees fleeing their country by boat, diplomats and relief-agency officials say.


WOMEN'S GROUP COUNTS SUCCESSES

Do You Like All the Home Runs This Years
LEAD: Although more hitting in general is good for fan enjoyment, the disproportionate increase in home run production only lessens its impact and drama.
Now, the smaller, less powerful players swing for the fences more often instead of accepting their roles as ''table setters'' for the true home run hitters following in the lineup.


AN ONTARIO TOWN'S ARCHITECTURAL LEGACY
LEAD: When Dickens saw Cobourg in 1842, he thought it a ''cheerful, thriving little town.'' To a visitor in 1987, this town of 15,000 on the northern shore of Lake Ontario still looks cheerful, if not exactly thriving.
It has no significant tourist attractions or memories of national prominence, although since Dickens's day it has had two brushes with power and affluence.


FINE -- BUT NOT IN MY BACKYARD
LEAD: IT WILL increase traffic and endanger the lives of children crossing the street on their way to school.


CORRECTION
LEAD: A chart on May 17 with an article about black baseball fans carried a heading that erroneously characterized statistics about black players and the positions they play.

From now on they want to be called Fawn Trail.


MEMORIES OF SUMMER CHERISHED
LEAD: Diana Cecil, an advertising representative at Sports Illustrated, is a tennis whiz and a faithful runner.

LONG ISLAND FOLLOW-UP
LEAD: Missing Passenger


Herring
LEAD: To the Editor: I very much enjoyed ''Cured New Herring of the Netherlands'' (Travel, April 12) because in May 1968 when we were in Amsterdam, the street vendors with their carts were everywhere.
I consumed a raw herring in the approved manner and still have a snapshot to prove it.


WHAT'S NEW IN THE TENNIS BUSINESS
LEAD: TEN years ago, the query ''Tennis, anyone?'' elicited a roaring ''Yes'' around the country.
Tennis was the boom sport of the 1970's, its popularity fed in large part by the greater visibility of professional tennis and in particular by the ballyhooed ''Battle of the Sexes'' between Billie Jean King and Bobby


Iran Expels 5 British Envoys, Citing Ouster of 5 by London

Required AIDS Tests That Make Sense
LEAD:  To the Editor:


Going On in the Northeast
LEAD:  LANCASTER MUSEUM BENEFIT


SCIENCE FICTION
LEAD: I have never understood why people are attracted to horror movies that promise to give the viewer nightmares.
But Connie Willis's new novel, LINCOLN'S DREAMS (Bantam, $15.95), literally gave me dreams -strange narrative fantasies that left me with a not unpleasant sense of being on the verge of some important revelation.


A THEATER MUSEUM THAT'S A SHOW STOPPER
LEAD: THE OPENING ON APRIL 23 OF the London Theater Museum in Covent Garden was a happy day not only for London but for the numberless foreign visitors (above all, those from the United States) who would never dream of coming to London without going to the theater.

TAKING SPEECH TO ITS LIMITS
LEAD: ''THE JOY OR THE HORRI-ble - the extremes -'' the director Joseph Chaikin gropes for words to explain what lies beneath the wild non sequiturs in ''The Bald Soprano.'' Navigating in rehearsal through Eugene Ionesco's comic ''anti-play'' of charged, disconnected phrases, the actors pick out signposts from the director's own charged, disconnected phrases.


Tax Cheats' Unwanted Fame
LEAD: In an effort to collect more than $70 million in overdue taxes and water bills, the city is going after tax delinquents through newspaper advertisements.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD:  UNDER THE LAKE.
By Stuart Woods. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $17.95.) Authors, journalists, greeting-card versifiers and anyone else who writes on deadline might have problems relaxing into this slick supernatural mystery.
The hero's writing block would surely give that tribe more anxiety than the apparitions that haunt the lakeside cabin in rural Georgia where he has gone to work on a book.


TV Writer Wed To Katha Pollitt

LIKABILITY CAN BECOME A LIABILITY
LEAD: CALL IT THE LIKABILITY Factor.
It's as good a yardstick as any for measuring TV entertainment.
Certain forms, notably situation comedies, are almost aggressively likable. ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' wasn't just nice; it was adorable.
That's how sitcoms are built.
Even Archie Bunker had to be a ''lovable'' bigot.

EXCESS BAGGAGE AND THE MOVIES
LEAD: ORDINARILY, UPON ENTERING a movie theater, you check your baggage at the door.
That baggage consists of whatever nonessential information you may have picked up concerning the fiscal, professional or amorous peculiarities of those who made the film, or miscellaneous tidbits that are even more marginal.


Streetscapes: Brooklyn Borough Hall; A Greek Revival Temple Fronts an 1848 City Hall
LEAD: BROOKLYN BOROUGH HALL has aroused debate from the start, so the recent controversy over its prolonged restoration is perhaps in context.
But if all goes well, it will be in service by early 1988 as borough offices, and as a reminder of Brooklyn's glory days before it became part of New York City in 1898.


Ramona Leanora Grey Marries Eric L. Harris

IMMIGRATION LAW PORTENDS UNCERTAINTY IN 'MEXAMERICA'
LEAD: AS the day drew near when enforcement of the new United States immigration law was to begin, protests from factory owners, farmers, ranchers, hotel owners and restaurateurs natiowide rose to such a pitch that the Senate voted to delay it.
But nowhere is there more apprehension than along the United States-Mexico border, whose residents fear the law may disrupt a remarkable process of economic and social integration.


FARMING TAKING NEW TURN IN STATE
LEAD: AGRICULTURE in New Jersey has undergone a major transition, especially in the last two years.
Huge tracts of farmland have been acquired by developers eager for well-located property, and profitable new sectors of agriculture - horse farming and plant nurseries - have blossomed.


THE BRITISH AND ITALIANS: POLITICS, PRIDE AND STYLE
LEAD: THE British have long nurtured a passion for things Italian.
A long line of monarchs have collected Italian art, notably paintings by Canaletto and drawings by Leonardo; writers from Keats to Jan Morris have come to see and rhapsodize over landscape and architecture, and so many Anglo-Saxon tourists have filled the quarter around the Spanish Steps in Rome that as early as the 18th century it was known locally as ''the English ghetto.

CELEBRATING THE EAST END'S JEWISH HERITAGE
LEAD: Today, London's East End is famous mainly as the setting for Britain's most popular soap opera, but for generations it was the undisputed focus of Jewish life in England.
According to a pioneering sociological survey, ''Life and Labour of the People in London'' (1887), Whitechapel, at the heart of the East End, was quite simply ''the dwelling place of the Jews - tailors, bootmakers and tobacco workers, and the center of trading both small and large.

TRUE CONFESSION
LEAD: ONE OF THE SUREST paths to literary renown these days is confession, coming out of the closet, baring the soul.
Were you a Communist at Oxford?
An undercover man for the F.B.I.?
A morose parent?
A Mondale supporter?
Did you once float junk bonds?
Get it down on paper.
Don't leave out a thing.

LEAD: A three-year contract with the 1987 Stanley Cup champions would seem to be a nice way to round out a career, but not for Kent Nilsson.

LEAD: When a conventional washer-type faucet has to be excessively tightened down each time you shut it off in order to keep it from dripping, or when the faucet develops a drip that won't stop no matter how hard you tighten it, then prompt repairs are advisable to keep things from getting worse - for example, to keep from damaging the faucet seat and possibly causing extensive damage to the faucet stem itself.

LEAD: UNMARRIED couples who have lived together for years may feel as if they were married, but in legal terms nothing could be further from the truth.

All live or have lived in New York City.

IN SEARCH OF AUDIO HEAVEN
LEAD: TECHNOLOGY, WITH GODLIKE inscrutability, both giveth and taketh away.
Consider how strange it is that even as advances in sound reproduction now allow us to savor utter silence between the notes on a compact disk, strides in portable electronic amplification also make it possible for musicians in New York's subways to outbellow arriving and departing trains.

Service Economy
LEAD: To the Editor:


For Today's Relief Pitchers, It's a Game of Peaks and Valleys
LEAD: IN the first two months of last season, Dave Righetti registered 12 saves but squandered 7 other save opportunities, not a terrifically good ratio for a relief pitcher.
In the final three months, Righetti had 29 saves and failed in only 1 save situation, a remarkable run that, given it was done in only half a season, eclipsed the 32-of-33 performance Willie Hernandez had for Detroit in 1984.


Labor Department Finds an Upturn In Employment
LEAD: There was encouragement even for teen-agers in the employment report on the New York region issued last week by the Labor Department.

On Bumpy Road to Crown, Alysheba Is Left Behind

Cable TV
LEAD: This week's movie schedule on cable television seems designed to keep viewers on the edges of their chairs.
For example, suspense stamps two Jane Fonda vehicles.
James Bridges's ''China Syndrome'' (1979) is a stylish, crackerjack thriller about a malfunction at a nuclear-energy station.
It's played to the hilt by Ms.

Regulation 302, Broadcasters 102
LEAD: Broadcasters had hoped that the fairness doctrine, which requires them to present differing views on controversial subjects, would wither away.

But Congress disagreed, so much so that it has now voted to turn the fairness doctrine into Federal law.

MUSIC: CONCORDIA GROUP IN 20TH-CENTURY WORKS
LEAD: THE Concordia chamber orchestra (or, as the group bills itself, ''Concordia: A Chamber Symphony'') is dedicated to that problematic American proposition, the oneness of music.
As a nation that values the European musical tradition but has done only a little to extend it, while fostering a non-European popular tradition recognized the world round as valuable, we are bound to experiment with the possibility of cross-fertilization.


'The National Debt'
LEAD:  To the Editor:


Truth in Advertising: Shop Signs
LEAD: New Yorkers are justifiably skeptical about store signs shouting, ''Going Out of Business - Building Coming Down.'' Many sales later, the structures often are still standing.
But the office building at 565 Fifth Avenue, where an electronics shop has hung a colossal banner with those very words in its window, may indeed come tumbling down, though not immediately.


AN ETERNAL SEARCH IN ROME
LEAD: According to a recent survey, there are 80 public toilets in the Eternal City.
More than three quarters of them, however, are permanently shut, and the rest are in such a state of disrepair that the word ''ruin'' should no longer be applied to Rome's recently cleansed famous monuments but instead to those few public latrines - dark, dank and without running water - that have earned their reputation as the new catacombs.


600 MARCH TO ASSAIL RETURN BY THE KLAN TO GREENSBORO, N.C.

C. Penney store in Jacksonville, he had an idea where he was headed.


HOW OTHER NATIONS APPRROACH THE PROBLEM
LEAD: Even at the seven-nation industrial summit this week AIDS will be on the agenda.
In attempting to change both public health practices and private conduct, European governments have begun shaping national policies.
Most require reporting of AIDS cases, as in the United States, but not testing.
Most have extensive educational campaigns, though they have far fewer cases than the United States.


SOVIET AIDE SAYS NAVY WON'T ADD WARSHIPS IN GULF
LEAD: The Soviet Union has no intention of augmenting its force of three small warships in the Persian Gulf despite its apprehension about United States plans to build up its fleet there, according to First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov.


JOPLIN MILESTONE DUE ON CD
LEAD: HARDLY A RECORD COM-pany exists that has not been plumbing its back catalogue for treasures to transfer to compact disk.
And many of these reissues, from major and minor companies alike, have indeed been treasures, from Furtwangler and Callas to Bernstein and Karajan.
Now, Nonesuch finally joins the parade, with nine releases, reflecting the diversity of the label and, in a way, honoring previous overseers of Nonesuch's releases, including Teresa Sterne, who was consultant for the CD reissues.


Return to the 'Family of My Adolescence'
LEAD: JUST how I decided to attend my 20th college reunion, I'm still not sure.


VERMONT TRADITION, FROM SOUP TO NUTS
LEAD: More than a century ago, Frank Henry Gillingham of Woodstock, Vt., aged 26 and known to all as F. H., bought out the dry goods store where he had clerked since high school.
An enterprising young merchant who believed in ''large sales for small profit for prompt pay,'' F. H. began to stock all the necessities of life - ''vittles and sundry delicacies'' - along with tools for workshops, barns, gardens and fields for the village and surrounding farms.

Native Plants Reviving Ravaged Landscapes
LEAD: The fate of the silver lupine plants on San Bruno Mountain south of here is a cautionary tale about man's interference with nature.


BOTTLED IN BOND, HE'S VINTAGE CONNERY
LEAD: JAMES BOND MADE SEAN CON-nery's reputation 20-odd years ago, and the memory of James Bond probably explains why there seem to be middle-aged autograph hunters bedogging and bedeviling him wherever he goes.
He leaves his London hotel, and there they are with photographs of him in the toupee he used to wear for the role, clamoring for his signature.


Mashpee, Mass.: Developer Sells 'Snob Appeal' NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK; Newry, Me.: Sprucing Up Ski Country
LEAD: GROUND clearing has begun on Willowbend, a $100 million, 410-acre housing development around an 18-hole golf course on the edge of this Cape Cod community.


ON THE CONTRARY, AND THEN SOME
LEAD: RARE indeed is the individual who doesn't realize that life is an experience often characterized by contrariness.
Whether one lives in the heart of the city or on the fringe of civilization, it has always been a sure bet that the cuff link or tweezers dropped when time is of the essence will bounce or roll far under the piece of furniture that most closely hugs the floor.


KUDOS FOR A COUP AND AN INVENTOR
LEAD: IT is hard to conceive that anyone could be the world's best at two demanding intellectual activities.
Such a claim can made for Alexandre Louis Honore Lebreton Deschapelles, a Frenchman born just before his country's Revolution.
As a young man he was probably the world's best chessplayer but abandoned the game when outstripped by one of his students.


Milton Approves Settling Suit With Black in a False Arrest
LEAD: The town has approved a $626,000 settlement with a black who was falsely arrested seven years ago while sitting in his car in a white neighborhood.

COMMUNISM WITHOUT MARX
LEAD: DZINGAI MUTUMBUKA, Zimbabwe's quick-witted Education Minister, was expounding the need for private investment, foreign capital and more small business to promote African development.
Suddenly, from the audience of the Botswana conference, a young woman asked in evident bewilderment, ''Does that mean that socialism is over?


GOODYEAR'S TRANSMUTATIONS OF ZEN AT THE PRINCETON GALLERY
LEAD: TAKE a sheet of graph paper and fill selected squares with different colors.
It's a recipe for child's play, but in the hands of John Goodyear it yields results that could hardly be more sophisticated.

GRAF TOPPLES NAVRATILOVA IN FRENCH FINAL
LEAD: Seventeen-year-old challengers should be vulnerable to nervousness and 32-year-old champions should be immune to it, but the reverse proved true today in the women's final at the French Open.
As a result, Steffi Graf of West Germany, who turns 18 next weekend, won her first Grand Slam championship and established herself at least for now as the No.


Reagan's Band Of True Believers
LEAD: The ''righteousness'' Colonel North alluded to in the Eighth Beatitude is not medal-laden Eagle Scoutism.
Righteousness in the biblical sense refers to those with a confessing-forgiven relationship to the just God.
In the biblical sense, the righteous were self-confessed sinners.
I'm certain Oliver North did not have this in mind.


Catherine Taylor Is Bride
LEAD: Catherine Shawhan Taylor, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
John Arthur Taylor Jr. of Bronxville, N.Y., was married yesterday to John Gordon Hawkins, a son of Patricia Hawkins of Chestnut Hill, Mass., and David Hawkins of Brookline, Mass.

NURSE SHORTAGE: NO PROGRESS SEEN
LEAD: The May 10 and 17 articles about the nurse shortage in New Jersey sent me searching for a headline I had clipped from the front page of The Wall Street Journal of July 18, 1980.
It read: ''Critical Condition: Severe Nurse Shortage Frees Some Hospitals to Close Beds, Units.''


CORRECTION
LEAD: A picture caption on page 24 of the Arts and Leisure section today and a film listing in the Arts and Leisure Guide give an incorrect opening date for ''The Believers.'' It opens Wednesday at the Orpheum, 84th Street Six, 23d Street West Triplex, National, Manhattan Twin and Bay Cinema.

Poland's Political Activists
LEAD: As a translator and editor of some of Adam Michnik's works in English, I found myself disturbed by Michael T. Kaufman's article ''Poland's Plucky Activist'' (April 26).
Adam Michnik is certainly an important political thinker and activist, but Mr.

The underlying question, lost in all the clamor, is not whether to test but when, and why.

CRIME
LEAD: There are some nice things about NOWHERE MAN by Jerry Oster (Harper &amp; Row, $15.95).

LEAD: LEGEND has it that Dino De Laurentiis was walking down the street one day when he saw a line of people buying lottery tickets.

Ms. Myerson, the Judge and the Mayor

When We Could Believe
LEAD: At the Harvard commencement 40 years ago Secretary of State George Marshall made his proposal for American aid to the devastated nations of Europe.
In a few spare paragraphs, without oratorical flourish, he opened the way for the West's great postwar economic and political achievements.


Trusty Eel Offers Versatility

Makers Of Policy On AIDS
LEAD: Who makes Federal policy on AIDS?
Sometimes it is difficult to tell.
Education Secretary William J.

SEAVER CAN'T STEM THE TIDE
LEAD: Tom Seaver pitched in a game for the first time in nine months tonight, and endured two-plus very labored innings in an exhibition for the Mets against their Tidewater farm club.

SCHWARZENEGGER IN 'PREDATOR'
''PREDATOR'' starts out as a second cousin to ''Rambo'' and ''Missing in Action,'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger (as Maj. Dutch Schaefer) leading a covert mission to find military operatives missing in Latin America.
After 45 long minutes, he and his cohorts (among them Carl Weathers) find an enemy camp and conduct a raid. ''Knock, knock,'' says Mr.
Schwarzenegger, kicking down the door to a hut. ''Stick around,'' he says, running somebody through with a sword.
The missing men are found, but they have been brutally butchered, and the camera lingers lovingly on the carnage.
Then ''Predator'' turns into a monster movie.
It seems that the troops are being stalked by a large thing, played by Kevin Peter Hall, who also plays the large thing in ''Harry and the Hendersons.'' It looks like a man-sized lizard, can disguise itself like a chameleon, contains high-tech computer components and has dreadlocks on its head.
Something for everyone.


Catnapping on the Grand Canal
LEAD: Cameras caught more than one Western leader with drooping eyelids in the closing moments of their summit conference in Venice.

NO VISION IN VENICE
LEAD: The seven leaders left the economic summit conference proclaiming how pleased they were with themselves, and in a way it was true.
They had come with thunderous warnings of tough talk, especially from the United States.

They came up with banalities and ambiguities to address the issues before them with the least possible friction, and with the least possible content.

THE RIDICULOUS THEATER, AFTER LUDLAM
LEAD: The flowers covering the front of the Sheridan Square Playhouse, bleached from two weeks of late spring sun, have begun to wither; the notes from the bereaved - some hastily scrawled on cards, others printed out by computer on yellow telegram paper - are fading; the impromptu crowds of mourners have slowly dwindled to a trickle of passersby, curious about this funny-sad street shrine.

Why Libels Suits Are 'Sand in the Gears'
LEAD: The settlement of a suit by former Senator Paul Laxalt against the McClatchy newspaper chain leaves in its wake serious questions about the good sense and propriety of libel suits by Presidential candidates and high public officials.

Thatcher Victory Shows a Changed Britain, As Voters Support Own Economic Interest
LEAD: The unevenness of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's campaign clouded a political message that was delivered with unmistakable clarity by Britain's voters once the ballots were tallied this morning.

Thatcher on pocketbook and military issues.

LEAD: The marriage of Muriel Vanderbilt Hutton, a daughter of Mrs.
Edwin Marston Burke of New York and Palm Beach, Fla., and William Langdon Hutton of East Hampton, L.I., to Michel Louis Francois de Chabert-Ostland took place yesterday in New York.

OF RASPS, YOWLS AND DIN

An Office Park Retains the Past
LEAD: BUILDING a commercial and industrial park on farmland does not necessarily mean that historic buildings on the property must be destroyed.
The willingness to retain some links to the past is particularly appropriate in Lancaster County, Pa., where many Amish and Mennonite farming families can trace their


FAMILIES CHEERED BY SPECIAL FRESH AIR CAMP
LEAD: Eleven families from New York City got together here a couple of weekends ago to fish, boat, hike and peer through microscopes.
But mainly they came to inspect first-hand where their disabled children would be going to camp for the first time in their lives.


THE SHORT STORIES OF THE STAGE
LEAD: DURING ANTON CHEKHOV'S lifetime, the one-act play ''The Bear'' was one of his most popular and financially rewarding works.
As he acknowledged, ''I live off the labors of my bear.'' With a few exceptions, dramatists today have had no such comparable experience with one-acts.
Short plays are generally regarded as curtain raisers or afterthoughts, perhaps stageworthy but not commercially viable.


A CORRECTION
LEAD: Because of a transmission error, an article June 7 on Madison, N.J., misstated the percentage of blacks in the community.
It is 4 percent.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  CONTINUO: A Life in Music.
By Robert Starer. (Random House, $16.95.) The composer Robert Starer has written an autobiography of a remarkable sort.

Daily News Settles With 4 Journalists
LEAD: Coming after a trial that seemed to let no recrimination go unaired, the statement issued last week by The Daily News and the four black journalists who sued it was jarringly friendly. ''The past is over,'' they said on the occasion of reaching a settlement on damages. ''Trust has been restored.''


A RUSSIAN FORT IN CALIFORNIA
LEAD: A drive north from San Francisco, past the apple orchards of Sebastopol and the spindly resort homes along the Russian River, suddenly brings you out to the Sonoma coast, where rounded hills drop with striking severity to the sea.
On sunny days, which alternate with spells of storm and fog in the summer, the sky maintains a blue stillness, and on the hills sheep graze almost without moving.


Smaller - and Smarter - Hearing Aids
LEAD: FIVE years ago most hearing aids were bulky collections of conspicuous wires bunched behind the ear.
But the industry is benefiting from long years of research, and hearing aids have been getting a lot smaller and far less obvious.


LAUGHTER: TRIBUTE TO OURSELVES
LEAD: A GOOD friend of mine at college used to get through exam week by doing jigsaw puzzles.
She could put together a 2,000-piece, one-color puzzle in an afternoon.
Truly, she was a jigsaw puzzle grandmaster.


SUMMITE DOES NO HARM AND VERY LITTLE BUSINESS
LEAD: PERHAPS it was the unlucky number, but the 13th meeting of leaders of the seven major industrial democracies last week will probably go down in history as one of the least consequential since Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt first came up with the idea of the annual get-togethers.
The world economy is not quite in the parlous state it was in 1975, when the French President and West German Chancellor urged concerted action to deal with the dramatic rise in Middle East oil prices.


'WOMEN'S ISSUES' MOVE TO FORE IN UNIONS
LEAD: MATERNITY leave, child-care agreements and pay-equity adjustments, once considered ''women's issues,'' are now getting priority from unions at the bargaining table.

A New Push for Public Housing
LEAD: Almost no new public housing has been built during the Reagan Administration and many existing programs have suffered cutbacks.
But pressure is rising in Congress to reverse that trend.


ARLES'S SUMMER COSTUME PARTY
LEAD: Last summer when my husband and I drove through the stone gates of Arles, the Provencal city immortalized by Van Gogh, we could hardly believe our eyes.
There, striding proudly down the narrow street, were two Arles women attired in the dress seen in Van Gogh's pictures.
Farther down the street, another.


CUOMO PLANS TALK TO HELP INDIANA PARTY
LEAD: The newest addition to Governor Cuomo's out-of-state itinerary is Indianapolis, where he will depart from his usual practice and participate in an outright political event - a fund-raising dinner for the Indiana Democratic Party.


Cable TV's Rally: Too Far Too Fast?
LEAD: CABLE television companies have been getting rave reviews from Wall Street.
The shares of companies with major cable interests - Adams-Russell Electronics, American Television and Communications, Cablevision Systems, the Comcast Corporation, T.C.A.
Cable, Tele-Communications Inc., United Cable Television and others - have jumped sharply in recent weeks, as investors have marked up their estimates of cable asset values and future cash flows.


A COMMUNITY THEATER TAKES A CHANCE AND WINS HONORS
LEAD: A COMMUNITY theater, it is presumed, puts on lightweight, ephemeral and escapist fare for hometown audiences.
One hardly expects such a local amateur group to tackle a topical play on a controversial subject, win prizes for it and wind up as a candidate for international honors.


MARC TABAH, MIMI DALBEY ARE MARRIED
LEAD: The marriage of Marie Overton Dalbey, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
R.

By Stephen Jay Gould.
Illustrated. 222 pp.
Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. $17.50.


Where Are The Black Fans?
LEAD: If blacks used to go to the ball park but no longer do, it would be well to document when the drop-off began and attempt to correlate that with some other feature.
My intuition recommends that the urbanization of blacks might have a hand in this.
Basketball is a game that can be played one-on-one.


ALISON SMITH PLANS TO WED
LEAD: The engagement of Alison Vincent Smith to Robert John Marcinek has been announced by her parents, Kathleen M. Hodgsdon of Fairfield, Conn., and Peter B. Smith of New York and Sharon, Conn.

LOOKING AT THE PAST OF JAZZ FOR ITS FUTURE

NO ROOM AT ALL? DON'T GIVE UP
LEAD: Finding your hotel does not have your room when you have paid for it in advance or guaranteed your reservation with a credit card number is an utterly dismaying experience.
Most motels and hotels, knowing that the name of the game is indeed hospitality, will try to place you promptly in a comparable room nearby and will try to get matters right, with an apology at least and sometimes a basket of fruit or a voucher for a cocktail.


WINFIELD INJURY CLOUDS VICTORY
LEAD: Dave Winfield stepped into the batting cage last night, took a half-swing at the first pitch and felt a sudden twinge.
Moments later, he was lying face down in the trainer's room as heat packs were applied to the left side of his neck.

LEAD:  To the Editor:


Strrings in the U.S.?
LEAD: In the accompanying article, the authors suggest that the subcontracting of production now so popular among major corporations might provide the basis of an industrial revival.

But make sure you have the right sport.


The Need to Seek Oil in Alaska's Arctic Refuge
LEAD: Nearly two months have passed since the Administration proposed exploring for oil in the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The plan is now before Congress, which must decide -presumably on the basis of a dispassionate reading of the evidence -whether to kill it or move it forward.


Follow-Up On the News; Labeling Law For Fast Food
LEAD: FAST food may taste good, but is it good for you?


FOR DAVID ROBINSON: ACTIVE DUTY OR N.B.A.?
LEAD: Why not the best of both worlds?
Let him play in the N.B.A. and also let him do military recruitment and public relations in the cities to which he travels.
He could address high school assembly programs, Y's, Boys Clubs, go on local talk TV and radio shows extolling the virtues of the military, of the clean (drug-free) life, of hard work, of study, of stick-to-it-tiveness.


E. Allen Petersen Dies at 84; Fled Japanese on Boat in '38
LEAD: Dr.
E.
Allen Petersen, who brought his wife and two men to safety by sailing a 36-foot boat across the Pacific Ocean as Japanese forces advanced on Shanghai in 1938, has died.
He was 84 years old.


IN A CITY OF STRONG CHURCHES, A FALL FROM GRACE REVERBERATES
LEAD: One thing that sets Dallas apart from major cities on both coasts is the prominent role of its mainstream Protestant churches.
In a social sense, as well as a moral one, church is the place to be on Sunday morning.
Members of the establishment, and those aspiring to it, mingle on the steps after worshipping inside.


FOR DAVID ROBINSON: ACTIVE DUTY OR N.B.A.?
LEAD: David Robinson should fulfill his active duty obligations without any stipulation.
As an officer in the Navy, Ensign Robinson must draw the line between service to the nation and personal gain through professional sports.
SETH M. BECKHARDT  New York


Modern Inflatables Are Rugged Boats
LEAD: PERHAPS because I was raised on the seacoast in an era when wood was the basic building material for small craft, I have been slow in realizing that the best of today's inflatable boats - whether dinghies, rafts, kayaks or big water craft driven by outboard or inboard engines - are tough, safe and seaworthy and sometimes better suited for a specific role than their conventional counterparts.


SEPT 12 WEDDING FOR TRACY SCHACH
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
William O. Schach of Pittsburgh and Christiansted, V.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter Ann Tracy Sawtelle Schach to Bruce Brian Simpson, a son of Dr. and Mrs.

WILDLIFE APPEARS ON NEW ISSUES
LEAD: THE United States Postal Service utilized the opening day of Capex '87, the international stamp show being held in Toronto, Canada, to release its spectacular sheet of wildlife stamps.

NEW CAUSE FOR LINCOLN BRIGADE VETERAN
LEAD: LAST year, William S. Susman of Great Neck was in demand as a speaker.
His 30 or 40 appearances took him to Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth and Cornell, among other institutions, and the 71-year-old Mr.
Susman figures he'll be speaking again at seminars and symposiums when autumn rolls around.


CARTOONISTS EXPLAIN SUPERMAN'S NEW IMAGE TO HIS FANS
LEAD: LIKE a lot of people his age, the legendary Superman these days has to sweat a bit to get the job done.
Although still usually more powerful than a locomotive, he no longer can leap tall buildings in a single bound; he now needs two or three.
He feels pain and grunts ''Ungh!'' when Metallo, the newest force of

LEAD: The Pentagon said today that a 25-year-old American soldier was found shot to death Thursday in downtown Panamam, but that the killing was unrelated to civil disturbances there.


DEVILS' SELECTION IS A TOP PROSPECT
LEAD: In a draft notable only for its two top prospects and an abundance of lesser lights, the Rangers failed to improve their 10th-place pick and selected for toughness today, the Islanders drafted 13th and opted for sterling character rather than stellar talent and the Devils made off with the second-most coveted player available.


400 ALIENS ASK FOR NEW STATUS
LEAD: ''I'LL go get the Mexicans,'' the young father said cheerfully, gesturing toward his toddler sons as the immigration counselor summoned him for his interview.


ABOUT LONG ISLAND
LEAD: LET me tell you about my trip to Portugal.

WHAT THE TRAIN NEEDS NOW IS A GYM, CLASSES AND THERAPY
LEAD: THE other night I had a dream: I boarded the 7:18 A.M.
Metro-North commuter train at Katonah bound for Grand Central - wearing a sweatshirt, excercise pants and running shoes.


TARTS AND MORE TARTS, MAKE USE OF SUMMER'S FIRST STONE FRUITS
LEAD: SUMMER has definitely begun now that the first stone fruits have arrived.
Apricots, plumbs, nectarines and peaches make wonderful cooked desserts.
Best of all, in my opinion, are tarts in which the fruit is served lightly cooked, attractively arranged on the shell and coated with a light glaze.


BERGENFIELD BAND HELPS IMAGE
LEAD: THE 25,500 residents of this Bergen County community have a reason to celebrate: the performance of the Bergenfield High School marching band on the annual Tony Awards program last Sunday night.


COLLEGE PRESIDENTS' HOW DO THEY STAND?
LEAD: In Dallas on June 29, four college presidents will open a special National Collegiate Athletic Association convention with speeches on the future of college athletics.

DON'T COUNT OUT CONSERVATISM
LEAD: THE OBITUARIES FOR THE ''REAGAN revolution'' are already being published.
A Time magazine cover story reports that ''there are signs of a fundamental change in the nation's political weather . . .'' Even Mikhail Gorbachev has casually referred to Ronald Reagan as a lame-duck President, though why the Soviet leader should be so eager to make unprecedented concessions in order to negotiate an arms-control agreement with such a President is left unclear.


LAKERS' SEASON FOLLOWS SCRIPT: TITLE IS THERE FOR THE TAKING
LEAD: After 99 games and more than seven months, the Lakers are right where they were supposed to be: on the verge of their fourth National Basketball Association title of the decade.
One more victory over the Celtics, either Sunday or Tuesday, and the best team in basketball this season will be champion.

By Michael Humfrey. (Overlook, $15.95.) It wouldn't be a surprise to find this novel on the shelf of some Caribbean great house transformed into an inn, perhaps written in the 1960's when the islands were waking from the long colonial nightmare.
Though the book is about miscegenation, it is also an allegory of the struggle between good and evil and the choice human beings have between the two.

Photography
LEAD: James Casebere's photographs have as much to do with sculpture as with photography, which is not to their disadvantage.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: BREAD AND CIRCUS.
By Morris Renek. (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, $18.95.) This historical novel is like New York City itself.
So many characters do so much so fast that one is seldom entirely sure of what is going on.
Historic fact suggests that the hero, William M. (Boss) Tweed, must come a cropper at the end, but in the meantime one is carried along by the energy of this tale of 19th-century power and lust and by the enchantment of the author's gift for the metaphor juste.

BEST FRIEND: LOVE AND LOSS FOREVER
LEAD: A RECENT excursion to Shea Stadium with the family brought an unexpected reaction.

WITH VAN HAMEL AND MCKENZIE
LEAD: ''LA SYLPHIDE'' possessed the proper mystery and gentle melancholy when it was danced by American Ballet Theater Thursday night at the Metropolitan Opera House.
The performance, headed by Martine van Hamel and Kevin McKenzie, made clear why this work is considered one of the masterpieces of the Romantic era of ballet.


PET SHOP REGULATION
LEAD: The state's Division of Consumer Affairs, according to its director, James J.

CORRECTION
LEAD: The telephone number of the Art Center of Northern New Jersey in New Milford was listed incorrectly in the crafts column last week.
The number is (201) 599-2992.


Where Are The Black Fans?
LEAD: In his article ''Where Are the Black Fans?'' (May 17), the ultimate logic behind Brent Staples's argument seems to be that because racism is an inextricable part of America's past, and thus America's identity, then anything that embodies the American identity is by definition racist.
But isn't a strain of tolerance and egalitarianism also an inextricable part of the American identity?


A SUPERHERO FOR CARTOONISTS?
LEAD: RICHARD NEWCOMBE is fond of saying that he is ''like Lincoln, freeing the slaves.'' Six months ago, Mr.
Newcombe founded Creators Syndicate, which claims to offer its cartoonists and artists emancipation from what he calls ''indentured servitude'' - the 10- to 20-year contracts and the signing over of ownership rights that have characterized the syndication business for years.


CHURCH DEDICATION
LEAD: It has taken almost four decades, but Kevork Hovnanian has carried out a promise, made when he came to this country in 1958, to build a church in honor of his mother, Yester, who died in Iraq in 1949.


RENTAL CARS

BLACK AND WHITE BUDDIES: HOW SINCERE IS THE HARMONY?
LEAD: IN THE RECENT FILM ''LETHAL Weapon,'' the two protagonists (Danny Glover and Mel Gibson) meet for the first time in a manner that is a painful but apt metaphor for much of race relations today: volatile, contentious, explosive, both men victims of mistaken identity.


One Man's Mousetrap
LEAD: Jacob Rabinow is right, ''You gotta make things,'' but to get from the invention to the successful manufacturing and use of products, you've gotta have innovation (''One Man's Mousetraps,'' by Robert Kanigel, May 17).
Invention is often the solution to a technical problem.
To take an invention and translate it into a commercially successful product requires the fusion of marketing requirements, manufacturing and assembly, and ergonomics, all translated by design into useful ''things'' that meet user needs and arrive on the market ahead of the competition.

LEAD: The designated leader of West Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party, Hans-Jochen Vogel, called today for the removal of West Germany's 72 Pershing 1A missiles and the creation of a nuclear-free corridor in central Europe.
His call came a day after the Western allies had approved a plan to ban short-range nuclear missiles in


NEW STATE RULES DISMAY LAKE HOMEOWNERS
LEAD: HOMEOWNERS on the 600 private lakes in New Jersey are in an uproar over new laws that regulate bathing in their waters.
Many face large, unanticipated expenses to comply with the new state standards, and several lake communities are even considering banning swimming altogether because of the cost.


AUTO MAKERS SOUP UP HI-FI
LEAD: IT USED TO BE AXIOMATIC that a car radio that comes with the car can't be very good.
Too often that's still true, but lately there have been notable exceptions.


POSTINGS: Turning a New Page; Library Condo
LEAD: Avid readers in Jersey City's Hamilton Park neighborhood have visited the Pavonia branch of the Jersey City Free Public Library for nearly two decades at its humble quarters, comprised of four attached trailer homes, at 206-210 Pavonia Avenue.
Now, however, the same hot real-estate market that is forcing the branch to leave its current site -so that new brick town houses can rise there - has also prompted a most unusual solution to the library's search for a new home.


LUNCHING AT WORK
LEAD: WHEN he was an accountant, Budd Goldman said, eating at his desk meant spreading out his sandwich on a brown paper bag.
So he was receptive when Michelle Horwitz, a designer, came up with a more stylish way to lunch at work: on a series of laminated mats called Lunch-In Mats.
Mr.
Goldman's company, Banning Enterprises in Bellmore, L.I., manufactures them.


Symbols of Austerity: 16 Flagless Flagpoles
LEAD: Some of the 20 new flagpoles put up by the City of Hamtramck will be bare on Flag Day because there is not enough money to buy flags for them.


SOMETIMES A SERIOUS BOOK WINS THE BEST-SELLER GAME
LEAD: WHEN the recession was battering the book business a few years ago, a publisher lamented, ''More people seem to be writing books than buying them.'' The industry has since fallen on better times.
But it is still difficult, after last month's semiannual convention of the American Booksellers Association, not to be struck by the possibility that too many books are being loosed upon the world.


FROM THE ASHES, BRONX FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE
LEAD: The Bronx, where years of arson and abandonment in the 1970's created a national symbol of urban decay and despair, is showing the first, flickering signs of recovery.
It is a difficult and unsure convalescence, however, and one that is far more apparent to portions of its business community than to its still desperate poor.


CAREN PRATT WED TO W. GORDON ROSS 2D
LEAD: Catherine Frances Pratt, a daughter of Mrs.
Charles F. Gill of New Hartford, Conn., and Laurence O. Pratt Jr. of West Granby, Conn., was married yesterday to W.Gordon Ross 2d, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

TARTS AND MORE TARTS, MAKE USE OF SUMMER'S FIRST STONE FRUITS
LEAD: SUMMER has definitely begun now that the first stone fruits have arrived.
Apricots, plumbs, nectarines and peaches make wonderful cooked desserts.
Best of all, in my opinion, are tarts in which the fruit is served lightly cooked, attractively arranged on the shell and coated with a light glaze.

ROSE DAY AT LYNDHURST
LEAD: More than 500 rosebushes were in bloom last weekend at the National trust property for the annual event sponsored by the Garden Club of Irvington-on-Hudson.
Lyndhurst's Rose Garden, established in 1911, was restored by the garden club in 1968.
This year, for the first time, the WEstchester Rose Society also took part, holding its yearly competition in the Lyndhurst Carriage House.


CONNORS ADVANCES
LEAD: Jimmy Connors, who has won 105 Grand Prix tournaments but none since October 1984, swept into the final of the $300,000 Stella Artois grass-court championships today.
He beat Pat Cash, 7-6, 6-4, with a scintillating display of counter-attacking tennis on one of his favorite courts.


Trying to Teach Teachers to Dress
LEAD: WHEN the Board of Education in Paterson, N.J., adopted a dress code for 1,800 public school teachers, it hoped to instill discipline in the ranks and enhance the teachers' influence as role models.

CHUN'S PLAN FANS FLAMES OF DISSENT IN SOUTH KOREA
LEAD: AS Roh Tae Woo, the man almost certain to be South Korea's next President, was talking about his desire for political reconciliation at a news conference last week, members of his ruling party sat behind him, coughing and dabbing their eyes with handkerchiefs.
Unexpectedly, they had taken in nasty gulps of tear-gas fumes that clung to the clothing of reporters and photographers.


KEAN AND LEGISLATURE IN THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET-SURPLUS BATTLE
LEAD: Although the New Jersey Legislature considers thousands of bills each year, and passes hundreds, there is only one bill it is required to act on - the state budget.


WELFARE REFORM PROVES NO EASY JOB IN JERSEY
LEAD: FOR years, government attempts to train welfare recipients for jobs have snagged on such persistent problems as no jobs, or jobs that paid less than welfare benefits; no day-care facilities, no transportation.


A Mother's Memory Book
LEAD: ''My Mother's Mystery'' reveals that its author has painful childhood memories of her mother and that she has not yet come to terms with them.
She tells us that her mother was a hypochondriacal ice queen, a perfectionist who could never be satisfied and who was, therefore, never happy.
Mrs.
Gage's rage bubbles to the surface with such intensity that what purports to be a revelation is really a cathartic exercise that is painful to read.


WHAT BECOMES A LANDMARK? FOUNDATION TO GIVE PLAQUES
LEAD: New York City landmarks have everything from neo-classical acanthus leaves to Art Deco zigzags.
What most of them are missing is any sign that they are, indeed, landmarks.


Bookshelf

NORMAN JUST KEEPS ON SMILING
LEAD: THE setting at the Somerset Hills Country Club here in northern New Jersey was dizzy with beauty, with its rolling hills and rolling trees and rolling golf balls.

NUISANCE INSECTS AND THEIR CONTROLS
LEAD: COOL, moist weather has been a mixed blessing for gardeners.
While many report that this has been one of the loveliest seasons in remembrance, others say they never seen so many bugs.
Both are right.
Blossoms have flourished, but so have the bugs.
Pests multiply easily in this sort of favorable weather.


THEY DON'T BITE OR KICK, THEY'RE CUTER THAN COWS, BUT...
LEAD: ''MARY had a little lamb; its fleece was white as snow. . . .'' How easily that rolled off my child's tongue.
And how picturesque it was.
But how unreal!
This grown-up suburban matron-turned-shepherd has found out that Mary must have washed her lamb in Woolite every day for it to have that ''white-as-snow'' look.

IRANIAN DENIES CHINA IS A SOURCE OF WEAPONS
LEAD: Iran's Foreign Minister forcefully denied today that his country had received any weapons from China, including antiship missiles, and he warned both the United States and the Soviet Union to stay out of the Persian Gulf.


CHANCES ARE SLIM FOR SUBWAY SERIES
LEAD: IN case anyone had any lingering hopes, forget it.
The Yankees and the Mets are doing their very best to insure their fans that New York will not have a Subway Series this season.
In fact, they seem to be trying to outdo each other in their quest not to reach the World Series, together or alone.


INTERFAITH CHAPELS IN DEMAND
LEAD: WHERE shall the wedding be held?
When the bride and bridegroom are of differing faiths, that can be a difficult question to answer.


Where Are The Black Fans?
LEAD: Brent Staples mentioned, as a racist ''slight,'' the occasion when Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was not present at the game in which Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's home-run record.
The rebuttal is so obvious that it makes the whole issue appear silly.


REDISTRICTING PLAN OFFERED IN LEGISLATURE
LEAD: SOME of the bitterest, and most colorful, fights in the State Legislature occur after each Federal census, when the state must realign its Congressional districts to reflect shifts in population.


OPERA: THOMSON'S 'MOTHER OF US ALL,' AT TULLY
LEAD: IT was almost exactly 40 years ago that ''The Mother Of Us All'' premiered in New York, and since then it has been done in versions big and small, with 30 singers and with just a handful, by large orchestras and by tiny ensembles.
With relatively few exceptions, it has been a smash.

LEAD: The Venice summit meeting ended with the leading non-Communist industrial nations providing a somber assessment of the world economy and a series of generalized proposals to deal with persistent problems.

LEAD:  INTERNATIONAL 3-22


CONFLICT OF ENGINEERING VS. MANAGEMENT
LEAD: THE construction tragedy in Bridgeport dramatizes once again the fallibility of men and their machines.
There is something in the human condition that demands, especially in situations like this, the definition of a ''cause'' that brought about the ''effect.'' This must be approached on a rational level, setting aside preconceptions and prejudices, looking dispassionately for the true essence of the problem, with the resolve to correct, not simply to blame.


IN QUOTES
LEAD: ''Anything that recognizes that the U.S. banking system is at a disadvantage is positive.
But there may be an exaggerated emphasis on size.''

Once the holiest monastery of the Gelukpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism, the temples were dynamited by the Chinese in the 1960's to extirpate religion from Tibet, both in retaliation for an armed uprising in 1959 and as part of the leftist hysteria of the Cultural Revolution.


SETTING THE STAGE WITH A TEXAS VICTORY
LEAD: IT could well be argued that Friday, May 15, 1987, was the most exciting day in American bridge history.
Few people, however, were able to savor it, for it occurred in four small rooms at the Hyatt Hotel in Memphis.
The occasion was the second day of semi-final play in the International Team Trials with four top-ranked teams battling for the right to represent the United States in the world championship, scheduled in Jamaica in


Hanoi Vows a Cambodia Exit Despite Effect on Guerrillas

LEAD: SPRING is always too rushed for the plain dirt gardener, and this spring seemed somehow more hectic than most.

On TV: Five Crimes of Conscience
LEAD: Fawn Hall, secretary to Oliver North of the National Security Council staff, smuggled her boss's documents out of the White House last Nov. 25 as the Administration shut down his Iran-contra operation.

Madrid
LEAD:  To the Editor: I was surprised that Edward J. Sullivan didn't mention the Museum of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in ''Madrid's Other Museums'' (Travel, March 22).

According to The New York Times of Dec.

SUNDAY OBSERVER
LEAD: ONCE UPON A TIME, or in 1942 if you prefer, high schools graduated their sweaty produce in June.

LEAD: When I finished reading Joan Gage's article ''My Mother's Mystery'' (May 17), I had tears on my cheeks.

SARATOGA
LEAD: Like most resorts that had a heyday, Saratoga is long on nostalgia.
Saratoga's was the late Victorian era, and the remnants are clustered among parking lots and fast-food places along Broadway.
But beyond those facades, visitors know they can recapture a bit of the past, for the diversions of an 1870's holiday - morning promenades, afternoons at the races and evenings at concerts -now have an 80's spin, with minimalls, quinellas and avant-garde music.

LEAD: RATHER than a dusty civics lesson, federalism is an evolving principle that continues to influence the lives of all Americans strongly, if indirectly.


No Headline
LEAD: SOCIETY is a game, games are best played by children, and children are mean.
So says Michael N. Thomas, an observer and commentator on scenes social and otherwise.
What Mr.
Thomas does not say is that social observation is also a game, one best played by sophisticates who can also be mean but who are, as well, amusing and skeptical.


Staying in the City

NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Lancaster, Pa.

GOETZ JUDGE REVISES SELF-DEFENSE DEFINITION

LEAD: Voicing the same complaints that led to a strike six years ago, the nation's air traffic controllers voted overwhelmingly last week to form a new union.


JOHANN HUMMEL GETS A NEW DAY IN THE SUN
LEAD: IT IS PERIODICALLY INTERESTING to step behind the mighty threesome of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven and see what other music is lurking in the shadows of their time.

LITTLE BITS OF HEAVEN
LEAD:  OTHERWORLD JOURNEYS  Accounts of Near-Death Experience in Medieval and Modern Times.
By Carol Zaleski. 275 pp.
New York: Oxford University Press. $18.95.
I USED to think, somewhat innocently, that seeing is believing.
That was before someone showed me a certified photograph of a leprechaun, looking very much like the little Irish elf of my imagination.


CAN YOU TOP THIS?
LEAD: THERE'S A CLASS of malicious bore whose chief delight is in disproving things we've known all our lives, thereby scuttling the fragile buoys of fact to which we cling in a sea of uncertainty. ''Attila the Hun was really a mild collector of snuff boxes,'' he'll say with a knowing sneer, or ''Mozart's best stuff was stolen from Francis Bacon.


COURT BACKS DETROIT LAYOFFS
LEAD: The City of Detroit can legally lay off 1,100 police officers, most of them black, in accordance with a seniority system, a Federal appeals court ruled Friday.


Emporiatrics

LEAD: A spokesman for the fallen television evangelist Jim Bakker said today that Mr.
Bakker and his family will move out of a home owned by the PTL ministry.


The Tanning Confusion
LEAD: The article on the dangers of tanning delivers a contradictory message (''A Place in the Sun,'' by Linda Wells, May 17).

WHAT'S NEW IN STILL-VIDEO PRODUCTS?
LEAD: THOSE who think the brave new world exists only in fiction had better think again.

FOR SEOUL, LINGERING FUMES TOUCH OFF TEARS AND ANGER
LEAD: Nothing is more inescapable these days than the lung-searing, eye-burning tear gas that saturates the streets of the entire downtown area.

Reagan Officials To Extend Reach Of AIDS Testing
LEAD: To the dismay of those who fear that any mandatory testing might be a precedent for civil-rights abuses, the Reagan Administration described last week the details of its plan to screen Federal prisoners and aspiring immigrants for evidence of infection with the AIDS virus.
While the announcement had been expected, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d alarmed some civil libertarians by suggesting that a positive AIDS test might be considered a possible ground for the denial of parole.


CHILDREN'S FUND GENESIS
LEAD: WHEN Dottie Pinto of River Vale was told six years ago that her daughter, Jessica, had leukemia, her first reactions were fear, then anxiety. ''You don't know what to think, you don't know where to turn and you don't know where to go,'' the 31-year-old Mrs.
Pinto recalled.


Where Are The Black Fans?
LEAD: To me, the phrase ''gifted athlete'' always carried the connotation of having the ability to think quickly and accurately as well as having the physical attributes necessary to perform great deeds on the field.
Should I now no longer use such language when referring to black athletes?
Is it O.K., one wonders, to use alternative phraseology, such as talented athlete, exceptional athlete?


MS. BAYER, A STUDENT, WEDS ANDREJS PENIKIS
LEAD: Amanda Bayer, who is studying for a Ph.D. degree in economics at Yale University, was married in the Marquand Chapel at the Yale Divinity School in New Haven yesterday to Andrejs Penikis, a budget analyst for the Department of Education in Washington.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: AFTER THE HOLIDAYS.
By Yehoshua Kenaz.
Translated by Dalya Bilu. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $16.95.) First published in Israel 23 years ago, this powerful novel is an ironic, biting portrayal of pioneer life in pre-World War I Palestine.
What some early Zionists called a paradise on earth, a land without people for a people without a land, the Israeli writer and critic Yehoshua Kenaz describes as inhospitable, threatening and heavily populated by Arabs.


AT LAST, A 'MUSEUM WITHOUT WALLS' ... GETS WALLS WORTHY OF IT
LEAD: IN AN AGE IN WHICH MUSEUMS HAVE become grandiose, expressionistic, highly personal works of architecture, the first impulse is to say that the new Menil Collection in Houston represents an opposite trend: it is matter of fact, understated, utterly deferential to the art it contains.
Yet in its way, this 402-foot-long, two-story-high box of steel, wood and glass, which seems so plain, is as expressive of personal style as any museum in America.


U.S. Schoolchildren Found to Master Some Language Skills
LEAD: American schoolchildren are mastering the mechanics of grammar, punctuation and spelling, a testing agency says.

Public or Special Interests on Insurance?
LEAD: Thousands of New Yorkers know the life insurance sold by savings banks is an excellent buy.

LEAD: SHORTER skirts might be making a heralded comeback, but they have a long way to go before they dominate the fashion scene.
Evidence of this can be found in the long skirts that still seem to be almost everywhere you look.
A lot of women are reluctant to let them go, even on warmer days.


The States' Rights Can Vary With The Issues
LEAD: RATHER than a dusty civics lesson, federalism is an evolving principle that continues to influence the lives of all Americans strongly, if indirectly.


HOW BAKKER WIDENED THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE
LEAD: JUST inside the entrance to Heritage USA, the 2,300-acre theme park and headquarters of the PTL ministry, stands the Rev.

CORRECTION
LEAD: Because of a transcription error, a story last week on earth sciences weekends for Pleasantville High School students incorrectly quoted Dorna Schroeter, director of the Madden Outdoor Education Center in Kent Cliffs, Putnam County.
Miss Schroeter said: ''The reason we may not have as much of a problem with acid rain here as compared to the Adironacks is because we have a lot of limestone deposits in the Taconic region, and limestone acts as a neutralizer, bringing down the level of acidity.


A Straw to Stir George Steinbrenner
LEAD: IN checking the seismographs of the latest Mets and Yankees rumblings, as provoked by Darryl Strawberry and George Steinbrenner, the shame is that their squawks are separated by the Triborough Bridge toll booths.
These two were meant for each other.
And each deserves the other.


BLACKS IN THE ARTS: EVALUATING RECENT SUCCESS
LEAD: Blacks have scored a number of notable successes in the performing and dramatic arts in recent weeks and months, prompting discussion in artistic, academic and other circles of a question: Do those triumphs reflect real advances for blacks in American culture and society as a whole?


PATIO PROJECT CAN HELP THE BUDGET
LEAD: POURING your own concrete walk or patio is a lot of work, but it is one project that an economy-minded do-it-yourselfer can safely tackle.
It requires no unusual skills or expensive equipment (a mixer can be rented if need be), and by doing the work himself the homeowner can save more than half the cost of a professional contractor.


WITHIN GARDEN BORDER, THE SEXES BATTLE ON
LEAD: IN the beds and borders of a garden, men and women meet as equals.
Eager for blooms and merciless on bugs, both appreciate the efforts of the other.
But a few aspects of the art appear to be rooted to gender.

Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in New York.


CONNER LAUNCHES NEW CUP DRIVE
LEAD: On his way to an interview in a Seventh Avenue high-rise last week, Dennis Conner got the high-five salute from one of the building's janitors.
The goodwill gesture could have been taken for just that.
But as far as Conner was concerned, it was one of many signals that ''the people in America care about the America's Cup.


Headliners; Coming Home
LEAD: Years after the United States ceased to prosecute a war in Vietnam, it continues to ponder the prosecution of errant warriors of that era.
Last week, there arose the question of what to do about Douglas Beane, who deserted the Marine Corps 17 years ago while serving in Vietnam.
Mr.
Beane, who was at the time facing charges of dealing in the black market and threatening to kill another marine, took off for Australia, where he married, had two sons and worked as a cook.

Now a Federal advisory committee has tentatively recommended that the system be expanded.


STRAWBERRY EJECTED EARLY IN METS' DEFEAT
LEAD: Darryl Strawberry's week of travail ended with more travail tonight when he was struck by a pitched ball, charged the mound, wrestled with Bob Kipper and touched off a tussle between the Mets and Pittsburgh Pirates.
And, after all that, he was branded the aggressor and was ejected from the game by the umpires.

BBC SITCOM PROVES POLITICS HAS ITS LAUGHS
LEAD: THE AMERICAN SITUATION comedy is wide enough to encompass adolescent capers, romantic flings and even tips on how best to raise a family.
But the native form has had problems getting a handle on political comedy.
The few more notable attempts to poke fun at our politics and politicians have been decidedly off target.


The City Sweetens the Pot to Hold and Lure Tenants

TARTS AND MORE TARTS, MAKE USE OF SUMMER'S FIRST STONE FRUITS
LEAD: SUMMER has definitely begun now that the first stone fruits have arrived.
Apricots, plumbs, nectarines and peaches make wonderful cooked desserts.
Best of all, in my opinion, are tarts in which the fruit is served lightly cooked, attractively arranged on the shell and coated with a light glaze.

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Looking Homeward
LEAD: A FUNNY THING HAPPENED to me on the way to Indonesia several years ago.
And then again on the way to Vienna.
And to Budapest.

Something strange seized me, something ''unmanly'' - downright embarrassing at first - but now, slowly, ever so slowly, comprehensible to me.

Misery on the Meatpacking Line
LEAD: MARY TVEDT had learned to live with the dirt and the danger of a meatpacking house.

Lawsuit Dropped
LEAD: THE St.
Louis Blues have dropped the litigation over Jacques Demers, the National Hockey League coach who left the Blues for the Detroit Red Wings last season.
The Blues filed suit against Detroit in August 1986, claiming that St.

THE OPERA: ALBAN BERG'S 'WOZZECK,' IN VIENNA
LEAD: The first and perhaps the more powerful of Alban Berg's two operas took on a new face at the Vienna Staatsoper tonight.

LEAD: IF the house occupied by the Shepherd Gallery, at 21 East 84th Street, has changed little since it was built in the late 1880's, it is only because no extraordinary measures have been taken to preserve it.
The same goes for the 19th-century European art in which the gallery specializes: it comes unassisted by either 20th-century hindsight or educational officiousness.

A Bid to Seize Control From the States
LEAD: CRITICS of the insurance industry are trying to capitalize on the recent ''crisis'' of higher premiums, as well as a general suspicion among the public of antitrust exemptions, to achieve their long-term goal of eliminating state control of insurance, and replacing it with Federal control.
They would achieve this by drastically modifying, or even repealing, the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, which exempts the insurance industry from certain provisions of our Federal antitrust laws.

CYPRESS SENTRY AT 18th
LEAD: At the Masters each year the golfers warn that the tournament at Augusta National doesn't really begin until the back nine in Sunday's final round.
But the 87th United States Open might not really begin until the last three holes of today's final round - the 609-yard 16th that Seve Ballesteros considers a par 6, the uphill 428-yard l7th with what Tom Watson calls a ''goofy'' fairway, and the 343-yard 18th where Tommy

THE WORK CONTINUES FOR SUMMER'S REWARDS
LEAD: THIS would be a good week to prepare the garden for the long haul through the dry summer months.
Use mulches to cover the ground, keep it cool, prevent weed growth and preserve moisture; pine needles, where naturally available, are good around acid-loving plants such as rhododendrons, azaleas, mountain laurels, leucothoes, heaths and heathers; use wood chips or buckwheat hulls for roses and perennials; for vegetables try thin layers of grass clippings, rough compost or chopped leaves.


The Shape Of Ford's Success
LEAD: Few doubt that Jack Telnack is among the better automobile designers today (''The Shape of Ford's Success,'' by Phil Patton, May 24).

THE THREE FCES OF CAMCORDERS
LEAD: THE BEGINNING OF THE vacation season has sent sales of camcorders soaring.

Rabbi Roy Rosenberg performed the ceremony.


A FATHER REFLECTS ON THE ROLE OF A SON
LEAD: A SON is many things to a father.
A son is, at times, a mirror that reflects the father's strength and his shortcomings.
A son is a reminder of a father's waning youth, a reminder that life is not forever.
If a father is attentive to his duties, a son, as he matures, is a friend and companion who shares in the dreams and the memories of the father.


TRADE LEGISLATION: COUNTING WAYS TO OPEN -- AND TO CLOSE -- MARKETS
LEAD: THE 100th Congress is considering legislation that would deeply affect both the future course of trade policy and two basic economic facts of life - jobs and the cost of living.

Jazz
LEAD: Jazz fans who are in town for the JVC Jazz Festival - or for the duration - have a surfeit of choices.

THE KING LIVES, BUT THE QUEEN'S CROWN TOTTERS
LEAD: She emerged from her London hideaway for a photo opportunity, posing on Centre Court at Wimbledon, holding a bouquet of roses.

What the Questions Tell About the Questioners
LEAD: AFTER six weeks of hearings into the Iran-contra affair, the members of the joint Congressional committees have begun to emerge as familiar personalities.

THE CONSTITUTION CLOSEST TO HOME
LEAD: WHEN New York's top court invalidated random drug testing for public employees earlier this month, it virtually insulated its ruling from reversal by the United States Supreme Court by citing the State Constitution as well as the Federal.

ROBIN ANN RICHARDS MARRIED TO BRUCE T. SWAN JR.
LEAD: Robin Ann Richards, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

More Finishers
LEAD:  To the Sports Editor:  I was disappointed with a part of the coverage of the L'Eggs Mini-Marathon in Central Park on May 30.

Wasn't this a bit unfair?

LEAD: The British are complaining about the ''Americanization'' and ''televisionization'' of their elections.

New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. $19.95.


Redman Quartet With New Winds
LEAD: THE Dewey Redman Quartet looked like a mainstream jazz group Friday at Greenwich House, with Mr.
Redman on tenor saxophone backed by piano, bass and drums.
In some ways it also played like a conventional quartet, delivering tunes in the standard theme-solos-theme format.
But it also shredded conventions - the themes by coupling two or three disparate tunes and tempos in quick succession, and the solos by breaking free entirely.


WHEN BERLIN WAS AN ARTISTIC CAULDRON
LEAD: THE CITY, OR, MORE accurately, cities, of Berlin are celebrating their 750th anniversary this year, and the record companies have not been remiss in observing that milestone.
Perhaps the most interesting Berlin album thus far is titled ''Musik Zwischen den Kriegen: Eine Berliner Dokumentation'' (Thorofon Capella ETHK 341/4, four LP's), which translates as ''Music Between the Wars: A Berlin Documentation.


Marian McPartland's Piano
LEAD: MARIAN McPARTLAND'S pianism is characterized by two strikingly different qualities.

Votes in Congress ; Last Week's Tally in Key Eastern States
LEAD:  House  1.

Preakness Point
LEAD:  To the Sports Editor:  Bet Twice won the Belmont Stakes by 14 lengths.

LEAD: Africa, still recovering from the famine of 1983-85, is now grappling with an equally damaging ''financial famine,'' African economists warned here this week.


CHART FEVER: WATCHING THE HIT PARADES
LEAD: THESE ARE HEADY times for chart fanatics, those of us for whom the weekly fluctuations of the pop music charts exert an irrational fascination and excitement.
Today, not only reams of charts but encyclopedic tomes of pop statistics exist to fuel the competitive spirit of a world that seems increasingly obsessed with giving everything a numerical rating.


A Plea For the Chimps
LEAD: Dr.
Goodall doesn't dispute the contention that we need animal tests for the sake of progress.
However, numerous drugs that were taken off the market after causing damage or even death in humans have shown that animal tests are not reliable.
As an example, Thalidomide didn't seem to have any negative effects on animals; its only drawback was that it caused deformities in thousands of children whose mothers had taken the drug as a sedative during pregnancy.

ABOUT LONG ISLAND
LEAD: AS I was saying the other year, the Chemical Bank once had a branch in neighboring Oceanside that was so small and homey that everybody there knew everybody who came in.
Like a little country bank of a long-ago Long Island.
Even if I bounced a check, all Betty English would say was, ''Fred, did you have trouble with arithmetic when you were a kid?


MAKING ARMS FIGHTING MEN CAN USE
LEAD: ON the night of May 17, a radar operator, bathed in the dim light of the combat control room on the frigate Stark, was monitoring the screen of a sophisticated electronic device tracking every nearby radar signal in the waters and airspace off Bahrain.

A BOAT RIDE, A VIEW, AND THEN...

Man Killed by Subway Train
LEAD: A man was struck and killed by a subway train yesterday, four minutes after the Transit police reported that he had jumped onto the tracks and ran into a tunnel, authorities said.


KEEP YOUR COMPASSION, GIVE ME YOUR MADNESS
LEAD: I'M always puzzled when I see an advertisement for a novel in which a reviewer, or several reviewers, are quoted as praising the novel's ''compassion'' and its ''integrity.'' What compassion? is my first reaction.
Never in the history of the novel have authors given their characters such a hard time.

Confessions of Koch: Ice Cream and Curses
LEAD: For Mayor Koch, the last two weeks surely was one of the most grueling periods this year.

Question Of the Week; How Will Americans Fare at Wimbledon?
LEAD: I think it's a good thing that John McEnroe has withdrawn from Wimbledon this year - both for his own sake (and sanity) and for the other American players in the draw who are inevitably overshadowed by and underappreciated in his presence.
McEnroe would not have been at his best anyhow, and there is nothing sadder than to see this former three-time champion a shadow of his brilliant self, humiliated by an early-round defeat as he was in

Turning Kids Off Drugs
LEAD: Remember cults?
Brainwashing?
Peer pressure to make kids conform to some far-out religion? ''Love you, Paula,'' indeed!

STANLEY KUBRICK'S VIETNAM

A GUIDE TO LONDON'S RARE BOOKS
LEAD: If, as some say, England is the world of English literature, then to spend a week or so immersed in London bookshops will put one in touch with a whole range of its culture and history - to say nothing of savoring the comfortable melange of rooms with densely packed bookshelves that has been the traditional domain of the London antiquarian bookseller.


For the Idyllic Political Ad, a Fadeout
LEAD: Trends toward more realism and less romance in television advertising seem likely to influence commercials that will help elect a President in 1988, just as the idyllic, patriotic themes that were in vogue for car and soda advertisements in 1984 provided a model for President Reagan's re-election campaign.

LEAD: ''I ONLY got one foot into her room when my mother said, 'My fingers don't sew, my eyes can't read and my ears are like stones.

You don't understand me.' Then I lost my cool and I yelled at her.
Now I feel terrible.''


DIRECTING SITCOMS IS NO JOKE TO DAVID STEINBERG
LEAD: IT IS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON, first rehearsal, for the pilot episode of a new sitcom called ''Family Man.'' The show has been cast, the sets have been built, the jokes - more or less - have been written.

RUBEN BLADES: UP FROM SALSA
LEAD: CROSSING THE STAGE OF WASHINGTON'S Kennedy Center dressed in a loose gray suit and dark tie, Ruben Blades looks more like a lawyer (which he is) than one of today's most popular Latin American singers (which he also is).
Squinting into the spotlight, he looks out at the 2,000 people filling the elegant concert hall and asks to hear from those who do not speak Spanish.


Jetliner Evacuated Twice
LEAD: No one was injured when smoke filled the cabin of a Northwest Airlines 747 jetliner, forcing passengers to evacuate, the authorities said.

They are black, he is white, and what passed between them on the I


FANTASY HOTEL IN THE SANDS OF MOROCCO
LEAD: Unlike my wife, I do not normally lift small items from hotels.
Perhaps the odd ashtray, though not often since I gave up smoking.

ACTOR REFLECTS ON FATHERHOOD

MILES DAVIS HEADS BILL AT FISHER HALL
LEAD: THE Avery Fisher Hall portion of the JVC Jazz Festival New York got under way early Friday evening - there was a late-show repeat -with a double bill of two wind players and their accompanying bands.

The Shape Of Ford's Success

LEAD: LONNIE De LEON spent his days last week meticulously verifying the documents of thousands of farm workers hired by Griffin &amp; Brand Inc., the largest grower of fruits and vegetables in the Rio Grande Valley here.

CITIBANK, FORD JOIN THE EXODUS FROM SOUTH AFRICA
LEAD: South Africa has long been a good place to make money, but the pressures of prolonged civil strife and rising international condemnation of apartheid have taken a heavy toll on business.
More than 100 American companies have left the country in the last 18 months rather than deal with the consequences of civil unrest, a war of black resistance and white crackdowns in which more than 2,500 people have been killed.


CAUSE OF DYSLEXIA STILL AT ISSUE

A LITTLE MATTER OF SENSE
LEAD: FEW things are more characteristic of the modern mind than to take complication for improvement.

In Boston, A Traffic Debate

BIT OF THE SOUTHWEST IN GREENWICH

SHOES FOR WARM WEATHER
LEAD: I WAS EVERYTHING THE WELL-DRESSED PRIVATE detective should be,'' Philip Marlowe boasted in ''The Big Sleep.'' Indeed, the sleuth's self-assurance extended to his shoes - sturdy black brogues that he didn't hesitate to wear with a pale-blue summer suit.
These days, Mr.
Marlowe's shoes would surely be made of lighter stuff, from pliant glove leather to kid, or fine-grained calf.


FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS AT WORK
LEAD: WHEN Cheryl Chase Freedman was growing up, she assumed her family thought she would not have a career, but would marry and raise a family.

THE CON MAN
LEAD: MICHAEL RAYMOND WAS UPSET.
Scheduled to be transferred from Federal prison in Springfield, Mo., to a jail in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in the comfort of a plane, he was instead handcuffed, clapped in leg-irons and driven in a van for seven days across the South.
This was not the kind of treatment he was used to, especially from the


SUMMERFARE OFFERS A HOME FOR THE LEADING EDGE
LEAD: AMERICANS, AND NEW YORK-ers in particular, like to imagine being at the center of the cultural world; yet for all the comings and goings across local stages, a great deal of the most important and influential work done abroad has little chance of being seen here.
The predilection in this country for traditional grand opera has meant that few opportunities exist to view the experimental opera productions that have dominated European stages lately.

A County Named Bullfrog
LEAD: Nevada lawmakers today passed a bill creating a new high-tax county with the name of Bullfrog.
The desolate 12-square mile patch of land is one of three sites being considered for a national nuclear waste dump.
Most Nevadans do not want the dump in their state but feel that, if they are overruled, the Federal Government should be heavily taxed for it.


One Hurt and One Lost on Sound
LEAD: One man was critically injured and a second person was missing in a boating accident on Long Island Sound today.


AIRPORT SECURITY LAPSES FOUND
LEAD: In an average year, guards aided by X-ray machines and metal detectors discover about 3,000 weapons at airport security checkpoints.
Since the system was implemented in 1973, hijackings in the United States have been virtually eliminated.
So it would seem that the airline industry, which is responsible for the screening, has erected a very tight net.


Dance: Jones and Zane
LEAD: CENTRAL PARK'S SummerStage, which opened on Friday at the 72d Street Band Shell, is well on its way to becoming a New York tradition.
And Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane &amp; Company charged the air with the punch and vigor of their dancing, in a program dedicated to the late Willi Smith.


Power Plant Pits a Maine Town Against Environmentalists
LEAD: A proposal to build a wood-fired power plant in this sleepy mountain community has stirred a debate between the town's 500 residents, who are overjoyed about the jobs and tax revenue the plant would bring, and environmental groups, who fear the plant would seriously pollute the town and a nearby wilderness area.

By James I. Robertson Jr. (Random House, $24.95.) ''A.

TIME TO WALK, TO THINK AND DREAM
LEAD: ''Let's spend the last three days in London,'' my husband said, looking up from a table spread with well-worn tourist maps of Devon, Dorset, Somerset and Cornwall.
I thought for a moment, images rapidly clicking through my mind.
I saw us strolling down Birdcage Walk on a sunny Sunday afternoon, admiring extravagant clumps of searing-blue delphinium; sitting sedately in a black square taxi as it careened around Hyde Park Corner; panting down the escalators to catch the tube for a last-minute matinee at the Barbican.

Lendl U.S. Citizen?
LEAD: HE was born in Czechoslovakia, but he lives in Greenwich, Conn., and now Ivan Lendl, the tennis star who recently obtained permanent resident status, wants to become a full-fledged United States citizen, and as quickly as possible.
To help him, Senator Lowell Weicker, Republican of Connecticut, has introduced a bill that would allow Lendl to bypass the usual five-year waiting period and gain citizenship in time to represent the United States on the 1988 Davis Cup team, in the World Team Cup competition and maybe the Olympics.

PERHAPS MUSIC'S PENDULUM HAS SWUNG TOO FAR
LEAD:  To the Editor:


JIRI KYLIAN'S SOURCES OF CHOREOGRAPHIC INSPIRATION
LEAD: BALLETS CHOREOGRAPHED BY Jiri Kylian are passionate, rhapsodic, even tempestuous.
The Czech-born artistic director of Netherlands Dance Theater likes to send dancers surging in great waves across the stage, and he is not afraid to make strong choreographic statements in the theater.
He is also willing to talk about the unusual sources of inspiration for his works.


ANXIETY PERVADES WASHINGTON'S KOREA POLICY
LEAD: IMPOSING American morality on other countries' political systems is a ticklish business, and the United States has rarely done it well, whether the Administration be Republican or Democratic.
There is a peculiar interplay between Washington's regard for democracy and its anxiety over Communist expansion.

PAYING FOR PRESERVATION
LEAD: FOR ALL THE URGENCY THAT the threat of overdevelopment poses in New York and so many other downtowns today, there is another side to this coin, and I do not mean the hurt feelings of real-estate developers.
Those who would shoehorn towers everywhere can take care of themselves, thank you.
But less self-sufficient, often, are the owners of landmark buildings whose properties have been turned by the current real-estate madness into potential gold mines.


STACY KING BRIDE OF HARDIN A. FOX

Wayne County
LEAD: To the Editor: Corinne K. Hoexter's article about Wayne County, Pa. (Travel, May 31), captures the essence and flavor of that region with one omission.

MAYORS LOOK PAST THE REAGAN YEARS
LEAD: After years of fighting Federal cutbacks, the nation's mayors are hoping that the end of the Reagan Administration will bring more money from Washington.
But even so, the mayors say they learned two lasting lessons from Ronald Reagan's Presidency: to narrow their list of demands, and even then not to expect too much.


Too Late for Reagan
LEAD: The decline of President Reagan's influence here is more than a problem, it's an embarrassment.
The capital is still hoping that he'll get an arms deal with the Russians, but mainly it's turning its attention to his eventual successor.

A Plea For the Chimps

Albert Collins on Board
LEAD: BATHED in the flickering of photographers' flashbulbs, his fingers scrambling over the neck of his guitar and wrenching out quivering tremolos, Albert Collins seemed galvanized by more than mere electricity on Friday.

CRIME
LEAD: James Lee Burke has been writing procedurals set in New Orleans, and THE NEON RAIN (Holt, $16.95) is one of his best.
The central character is Lieut.
Dave Robicheaux, a tough, experienced, conscientious police officer.
Also a former alcoholic.
Also a jazz buff.
Also a man you would not want to fool around with, as he demonstrates when his back is against the wall.


WINDSURFER SEEKING TO MAKE A COMEBACK

Banking on the Yuppie Fitness Boom

LEAD:  To the Editor:


Gathering of Mississippians Revels in Down-Home Style
LEAD: ''It's the damnedest thing,'' said Greg Harkins of Vaughan, Miss., who was in Central Park yesterday selling rocking chairs from back home, ''but in New York there aren't any front porches.''


Q and A
LEAD:  Hardship Increase  Question: I own several rent-controlled apartments in a co-op that was converted under a noneviction plan a few years ago.
I have complied with all of the rent-regulation rules and have gotten the regular increases.
But the rent my tenants pay does not even cover the maintenance on the units, let alone my return on the capital investment.


POSTINGS: City Service; Checking The Heat
LEAD: Summer is not the time New Yorkers want to think about steam heat.

AIDS ON STAGE: COMFORT, SORROW, ANGER
LEAD: WHEN WILLIAM HOFFMAN sat down to revise his award-winning 1985 drama ''As Is'' for its recent revival at the Circle Repertory Theater, he ended up making only one major change.
The original script contained a scene in which the six members of the play's informal Greek chorus recalled the first time they had heard about AIDS - from a doctor, from a friend, from a newspaper.


THE STUGGLE FOR A DEMOCRATIC HAITI
LEAD: THREE HOURS OUT OF NEW York, I start awake to find myself floating over a grotesque landscape - the sickly, reddish-brown hills of Haiti, wave upon wave of blood-dark corrugations, thickly marbled with white sand.
Haitian peasants have long since uprooted the once-dense covering of trees and underbrush, selling the wood for charcoal and leaving bare white canyons through which, month after month, year after year, the rainwater flows, carrying tons of precious topsoil to the bottom of the

LEAD: Mandatory testing for infection with the AIDS virus should be extended to prison inmates and immigrants but not to everyone getting a marriage license or entering a hospital, trustees of the American Medical Association said today.


NEW YORKERS, ETC.
LEAD: ALAN ORNSTEIN is not a horse person.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING: ALL NEEDS MUST BE MET
LEAD: Harry Katz and I agree  [ Letters to the Long Island Editor, May 17 ]  on the fact of the area's lack of affordable housing.
What caused the problem is history and should not be so much the concern as remedying it.


Quotation of the Day

Sherman Letters Show Civil War General Regarded Reporters as 'Spies'
LEAD: In 1984, Joseph H. Ewing opened a folder of letters addressed to his great-grandfather and grandfather in an almost illegible scrawl.

Ewing knew was that they had been written by William Tecumseh


ITALY'S COMMUNISTS ON SLIPPERY SLOPE

ANOTHER DEFEAT FOR RAJIV GANDHI
LEAD: Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party suffered an overwhelming local defeat last week, winning only four out of 87 seats in state legislative elections in Haryana, a small, prosperous state in northern India.
Many of the issues were local - demands for more irrigation water, territory and other largesse.


FRANCE'S SAVORY TALE OF FATE
LEAD: IT'S PERHAPS A MINOR RITE, one of the lesser pilgrimages in this country, but, if you go to the old town of Aubagne, just a few miles from Marseilles, you'll find maps and guidebooks showing how to visit the very spots where Marcel Pagnol, the novelist, playwright and director who was born there, filmed some of his most famous scenes.


THE PERFECT HAMBURGER
LEAD: THEY ARE RELATIVELY HUMBLE, to be sure, and there are those haute cuisine purists who malign them.

HARMONIZING NATURE AND TONE

FOR A CHANGE, THE NORTH RIM
LEAD: My family wasn't the traveling kind, and I grew up without seeing the Grand Canyon, although my parents did swing West on their own one summer and sent back a postcard of themselves perched on mules and angling around a steep cliff on their way down the canyon.
Impressed as I was by the technology that put my mother and father on a postcard, that card was probably the start of my misapprehension of the Grand


ON THE ROAD IN A $350,000 HOME
LEAD: THIS dusty speck of a town, 25 miles south of Macon, is a good place to find serenity.
Only 9,000 people live here.
It's a good place to buy pecans, being that it nestles in the heart of pecan country.
And it's a good place to get your tires rotated free over at Peach Maximum Auto Care.


Easy-Riding Mountain Bikes Take Off
LEAD: WHEN a self-described group of ''Marin County maniacs and lazy backpackers'' modified some old balloon-tired bikes and began attacking the trails north of San Francisco, no one knew they were starting the hottest two-wheeled trend since the 10-speed.

BATTLE OVER PLAN FOR BALTIMORE STADIUMS TAKES ON EPIC TONE
LEAD: Citing precedents from ancient Greece and Rome, Gov.

LEAD:  JAZZ FETE IN JERSEY


Dance: Keiko Fujii In New York Debut
LEAD: EVERY two years or so, a new dance company arrives from Japan to perform at Lincoln Center.

S.E.C. NOMINATION GOES TO ACADEMIC
LEAD: When Administration officials began looking for someone to replace the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, John S.R.

FUTURE OF CANAL AN ISSUE AGAIN IN PANAMA
LEAD: LIKE thousands of ships before it, the heavily laden freighter Aguascalientes entered the Miraflores locks of the Panama Canal at noon last Sunday.

JARDINE MATHESON'S HEIR-ELECT: Brian M. Powers; An Asian Trading Empire Picks an American 'Tai-Pan'
LEAD: Struan and Company (was) the greatest house in Asia, and so rich and powerful that the other China traders had named it in awe and jealousy The Noble House - noble because it was first in riches, first in largess, first in trade, first in clippers, but mostly because Dirk Struan was Tai-Pan, the Tai-Pan among all the tai-pans of Asia.


BANKER IS ACCUSED OF SHOOTING YOUTH
LEAD: A retired Salomon Brothers investment banker, who is a grandson of one of the firm's founders, shot and seriously wounded a Larchmont teen-ager during an apparent traffic dispute on the Hutchinson River Parkway, then fled in his car, the police said yesterday.


UNDERSTANDING ISLAM
LEAD: 'In many instances Christian perceptions of  [ the ]  resurgence in Islam are distorted by ignorance and prejudice. . . .
We describe the Islamic renewal in our own terms, calling it Moslem fundamentalism and referring to its followers as fanatics, zealots, or radicals. . . .
Both Christians and Moslems are challenged to allow God to guide them into a future free of hatred, free of fear, and directed by hopeful love.


PLANNING FOR WEEKEND TRIPS OR LONGER JAUNTS

Shifting Out of Steel, Into Carbon Fiber
LEAD: THE best bicycles have long been made of tubing carrying such proprietary labels as Reynolds 531 or Columbus SL, or generic names like chrome molybdenum - but these terms were all fancy names for alloys of steel.
Most of the best bikes are still made of these alloys, but they have been joined by frames of aluminum and composite materials.

A YOUNG COMPOSER ACHIEVES NOTICE
LEAD: ALTHOUGH a new musical comedy about multiple murders, ''No Way to Treat a Lady,'' marks the official New York theater debut of Douglas J.

THE KING LIVES
LEAD: The grass courts in England are like a trampoline, propelling Boris Becker to new heights.
It could be seen in the self-assured way the West German teen-ager carried himself at the Queens Club tournament in London, two weeks ago, that he won for the second time.
It is evident in the way he looks forward to playing at


TUNING OUT THE INNER CRITIC
LEAD: PEOPLE frequently express to me curiosity about the relation between criticism and creativity, and the apparent paradox of practicing both.
Of course, it is not much of a paradox - a visitor from Mars would be hard pressed to distinguish between a person writing a book review and one writing a short story; the same fidgets and sighing, the same avoidance maneuvers in the direction of the bathroom and the kitchen, the same sudden swoops of fruitful concentration and forward motion are common to both.


Law Professor Chosen To Be S.E.C.'s Chief
LEAD: A former law school dean is the White House choice to head the S.E.C.
David S. Ruder has spent the last 10 years at Northwestern University.
His distance from Wall Street and its current scandals was said to be one reason he was picked to head the agency that is leading a crackdown on insider trading.


A Plea For the Chimps
LEAD: Jane Goodall wants the public to believe that all scientific institutions house primates in small, cramped cages.
This isn't so.
For example, most of the chimpanzees at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center live in social groups.
Play equipment, large indoor rooms, outdoor play yards and social companionship with peers are provided for the young animals.

LEAD: Secretary of State George P. Shultz delivered an unusually harsh rebuke today to the commander of NATO for having said that the Reagan Administration was pressing Europe to accept what he called a dangerous arms agreement with the Russians.


ESCPAING THE CROWDS
LEAD: Beyond the well-known national parks are also less-frequented parks that offer diverse scenery and activities - from canoeing on lakes in Minnesota to exploring pre-Columbian cliff houses in Colorado to snorkeling among coral reefs off Florida.
Following is a guide to these parks.
The 18 listed here were selected on the basis of three criteria: each park had fewer than 1 million visitors last year; each offers camping and, in some cases, lodging, and all are in the 48 contiguous states.

MINIMAL MUSIC BRIDGES A CULTURAL DIVIDE
LEAD: TO MANY ROCK MUSICIANS, classical music is stuffy and antiquated; to some classical types, rock is the sound of barbarians slavering at the gates of culture.
But there's one area where cordial relations have prevailed, at least since the end of the 1960's: minimalism, a style both sides can understand.


GOING BACK TO DISTINCTIVE BASICS
LEAD: ROOTS WILL TELL, AS THE RE-spective seasons of New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater suggest.

WONDERS FROM THE TIME OF DUNCAN PHYFE
LEAD: DUNCAN PHYFE'S NAME is better known to Americans than the furniture he crafted in 19th-century New York, an oversight that the Museum of the City of New York is trying to correct in ''An Elegant Assortment: The Furniture of Duncan Phyfe and his Contemporaries, 1800-1840.'' The exhibition remains through Aug.

Jazz Festival; WORLD SAXOPHONE QUARTET, AT TOWN HALL
LEAD: THE World Saxophone Quartet's jazz festival performance at Town Hall on Saturday included a revelatory interpretation of Duke Ellington's ''Come Sunday.'' David Murray's tenor stretched and pummeled the melody while Hamiet Bluiett's baritone provided a rumbling, percussive counterpoint.
That left Julius Hemphill and Oliver Lake, whose cannily voiced altos created the illusion that an entire reed section was harmonizing.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Rowing  Harvard Prevails: In fierce crosswinds, Harvard's varsity eight skimmed an 1,800-meter course in 5 minutes 34 seconds yesterday to take the Royal Victoria Boat Race in Victoria, British Columbia.

Approaches on Angola
LEAD: Angola and the United States are exploring the prospects for improved relations, although no breakthrough is expected on the American demand for the withdrawal of the nearly 30,000 Cuban troops from Angola.

Shots that were stroked with an air of finality now inexplicably stray into the net or land at points unknown.

Restaurants; TriBeCa bistro, Southern food.
LEAD: WHEN Le Zinc opened in 1983 on Duane Street in TriBeCa, the notion of a hip French bistro so far off the beaten track was still a novelty, and soon it overflowed with a trend-chasing polyglot crowd.
The scene, however, was more alluring than the food in those days.
Eventually, as new hot spots took root in this once barren terrain, competition turned fierce, and Le Zinc had to fight back.

That Old-Time Politics

NEWS SUMMARY: FRIDAY, JUNE 26, 1987
LEAD:  International A2-8


MOVIE THEATERS: FACTS AND FIGURES
LEAD: When waiting in New York's seemingly interminable movie lines, it may seem hard to believe that the city, America's No. 1 film market, has about 175,000 seats in its 300 or so cinemas.
Yet as any cinephile will attest, moviegoing is not what it used to be.

Film: 'Dragnet,' Parody of Television Series
THE surprise about ''Dragnet,'' described by its director, Tom Mankiewicz, as ''a comedic homage to one of the classic television shows,'' is not that it's less than an unalloyed delight, but that it manages to be funny at all.
The film opens today at the Gemini and other theaters.
The new, updated parody, starring Dan Aykroyd (as the nephew of the original Sergeant Friday), and Tom Hanks as his hippie partner in the Los Angeles Police Department, has some real laughs, though they don't come in clusters.
They're as isolated and lonely as stoplights in the suburbs.

POP AND JAZZ GUIDE
LEAD: Barry Harris and Chris Anderson, Barry Harris's Jazz Cultural Theater, 368 Eighth Avenue, between 28th and 29th Streets (502-4300).
If Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell and Elmo Hope lighted the fire, then Barry Harris and Chris Anderson are keepers of the flame.
Be-bop piano, for want of a better term, is an incendiary art; its purest exponents build worlds of lapidary detail and glancing filigree, only to bring them crashing down in firestorms of rhythmic and harmonic transformation.


Advertising; Spanish Venture Begun By Burson-Marsteller

The Bad Trade News Behind the Good

The 40 percent decline in the dollar is finally evident in improved trade statistics.
That's the good news.
But without further painful actions, the present $160 billion trade deficit will level off in a few years at about $100 billion.
At that point, Washington, Bonn and Tokyo will still have to make all of the unpleasant economic decisions they've been putting off for a decade - above all, to act on the reality that the world is one economy.

LEAD: IN his line of work, Jack Pfeifer fingers thousands of ladies' blouses and undergarments, trying to figure out what they're made of.

How Japan Keeps the Exports Rolling

Taking a Cue From the Euromarkets
LEAD: THE recent Treasury proposal on ''superbanks'' rightly acknowledges that banking and financial services is a global industry that the United States cannot expect to dominate in the future simply because it dominated in the past.

LEAD: MOVIE MAKERS, LIKE CREATIVE spirits everywhere, must be free; they owe nothing to the authors of books they adapt except the money they have agreed to pay them.
In the case of the first book to be made into a movie, ''Ben Hur,'' not even a financial indebtedness was acknowledged; the movie would be good publicity for the book, it was argued, and General Wallace should be acquiescently grateful.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD:  BLESSED MCGILL.
By Edwin Shrake. (Texas Monthly Press, Paper, $9.95.) Set in Texas and Mexico during the years after the Civil War, this novel's intriguing combination of personal disasters and grand adventure occurs during a historical period when both were taken for granted.
The action in this humorous and macabre story includes plenty of scalping, one man skewered, three others roasted alive and a narrator, Peter McGill, who concedes, ''I didn't actually kill a man until I was seventeen.

FATHER OF THE BRIDE AGAIN AGAIN
LEAD: THE mythology of planning a wedding is a lavender-and-pink blob that eats up everything in its path.
You've seen the sci-fi movie, but have you lived it?
Have you felt yourself caught up in that ceremonial ooze?
The sweet fact that the blob begins somewhere in romantic love is no excuse for the damage it does to laws of reason and restraint.


Opera: 'Piece of String'
LEAD: COMPOSERS have for some time found it difficult to write convincing new stage pieces that are workable for ''traditional'' opera singers, whose professional skills are shaped by music from an ever-receding past.
Seymour Barab's approach has been to retain the organizational norms of light opera (frequent brief songs and set pieces, some of them interpolated into the plot for color rather than arising out of it), and to carry them out in an idiom of tonal, dissonant lyricism identified with mid-century American composers.

FOR A PAVED WALK OR PATIO, BRICKS WITHOUT MORTAR
LEAD: ONE of the simplest and most attractive ways to install a paved walk or patio is to use bricks laid on a bed of sand without mortar or cement.

LEAD: HELEN HALLISSEY, a victim of Alzheimer's disease, was growing more forgetful and confused.

Rome
LEAD: To the Editor: ''What's Doing in Rome'' (Travel, May 10) mentioned the pensione Scalinata di Spagna.
We also found, accidentally, Trinita dei Monte on the Via Sistina, a few doors from the Hasler.

THE SECRETS OF SOVIET STAR WARS
LEAD: FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, THE wizards of reconnaissance in the United States Government have been obsessed by the mystery of Dushanbe.

LEAD: THREE months after Haiti's then President, Jean-Claude Duvalier, fled into exile in France, the new Government moved to recover up to $400 million in cash and property that it said he and associates had absconded with.

For authors employed to compose road markers, obviously, unequivocal clarity should be the sign qua non.

Clifford Mason's play is very long and, at the end, emotionally puzzling.

By Katie Johnson. (Houghton Mifflin, $15.95.) In a small, cluttered classroom in rural Maine, Katie Johnson's first graders are learning to read, but not by fitting themselves into someone else's world, like the antiseptic family life of Dick, Jane, Sally and Puff.

LYNN CONNOLLY WEDS
LEAD: Lynn Connolly and Christian I. Halabi were married yesterday at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Tulsa, Okla., by the Rev.

Why Bigger Isn't Better in Banking
LEAD: IF recent reports are to be believed, the Treasury Department has decided that the Government should encourage the creation of financial leviathans called ''superbanks.'' While Treasury spokesmen have tried to downplay the issue, Administration policies clearly are moving in this direction.

Exploring The Kingdom of AIDS

WORLD OF LAW IS OCEANA'S UNIVERSE
LEAD: PHILIP F. COHEN, the 75-year-old president of Oceana Publications in Dobbs Ferry, needs no visual aids to stir his memory when he talks about his long life in the book business.

Comparing the Small Print
LEAD: You're ready to sign for the rental car.
Before you left for the airport, you called your insurance agent and learned that you are not covered for damage caused by a collision.
Therefore, you decide to pay for the collision damage waiver, at perhaps $9 a day.
It acts like insurance, although the renting companies say it simply waives their right to collect from you if the auto comes back in less than its original condition.

TENDING TO THE GARDEN OF THE HEART
LEAD: I read Ruth Jernick's ''Summer People, Chilly Season''  [ Opinion Page, May 31 ]  with ambivalence and a still larger measure of sadness.

FOSTERING TALK OF THE WRITTEN WORD
LEAD: THE passionate Joyceans, the merely curious and a few individuals who were clearly considering running for the hills began arriving at 7 P.M., half an hour before the annual Bloomsday celebration - a paeanistic symposium to the novelist James Joyce - was to begin.


Headliners; Behind Bars
LEAD: All was not forgiven last week when Terrence Peter Jackson showed up for sentencing after spending 17 years on the run.

The East End
LEAD: To the Editor: Your readers may be interested in knowing that the Cockney Museum sponsors a guided walk called ''The Jewish East End,'' which covers the area mentioned in ''Celebrating the East End's Jewish Heritage'' (Travel, June 7).
It is very informative and gives a clear picture of where and how Jewish migration fits into the history of London; because so much of English history is intertwined with the history of the church, the walk offers a different and refreshing perspective.


REPUBLICANS DEBATE STRATEGY FOR HOLDING ONTO THE WHITE HOUSE
LEAD: IF there was unanimity on one thing at the Republican National Committee meeting here last week, it was that ''four more years'' is not the slogan for the party's future.


At Henley, Fast Boats and Straw Boaters

PLEASED BY THE GOOD IN TEEN-AGERS
LEAD: MY son has a motto at his youth house that states, ''There's No Such Thing as a Bad Kid.'' I would be reluctant to make such a sweeping generalization.
After all, he is my son and I remember some things he has forgotten.
But I do get a little tired of the other generalizations, too, the comments that sweep all teen-agers into the rotten category.


ORIGIN OF THRIFTS
LEAD: BANKING existed for many generations before modern financial regulation, but the very origins of the savings and loan industry bespeak involvement in the political process.

Learning From Masters of the Wilds
LEAD: Small boys imitate older brothers who hit home runs, and so grown-up fishermen imitate fishing guides.
There are sound reasons why a city angler should avoid unfamiliar great waters unless he has a guide to keep him out of quicksand and instruct him in the mores of local fish.
But the attachment of client to guide involves something deeper than reason.


THE MORAL MEANING OF MEETING WALDHEIM

DELACROIX, A QUINTESSENTIALLY FRENCH PAINTER
LEAD: THE EUGENE DELACROIX RET-rospective at the Kunsthaus in Zurich is about as good a Delacroix show as anyone can now hope for outside France.

Exploring The Kingdom of AIDS
LEAD: I quickly grew weary of Peter Davis's article ''Exploring the Kingdom of AIDS'' (May 31).
He never entered the kingdom, but, instead, wrote about the playgrounds of the rich.
Why is it that my hospital, nestled in a high-risk area, doesn't even have an AIDS program, let alone an interviewer?
While he worries about those who have access to education and health care, I worry about the adolescents

Breaking Out of the Low-Price Pack
LEAD: HIGHLAND SUPERSTORES, the giant consumer electronics retailer in the Midwest and South, is offering its own version of the ''lemon'' law to cover defective televisions, VCR's and other products.
It also now has a 30-day no-questions-asked policy on returns, as does Circuit City Stores, an even bigger chain based in Richmond.


HEARING JAZZ AT ITS RISKY BEST - IN THE CLUBS
LEAD: WHEN THE JVC JAZZ Festival trundles out of town tonight, for some New Yorkers and visitors it will mean the end of 1987's allotment of jazz.
For those listeners, if it's not in a concert hall, then it's not serious music.
It's almost as if the jazz clubs don't exist.


Dance: Iris Park Offers 'Prayer in Three Acts'
LEAD: ONE could sense a desire to unite spirit with flesh and the sacred with the secular in the program that Iris Park and Dancers presented Thursday night at the Marymount Manhattan Theater.
But many of Ms.

HOW MACARTHUR GRANTS AFFECT WINNERS
LEAD: THE PEOPLE who live on Hartley Avenue in Princeton have become familiar with the word ''MacArthur.''


EXPRESSION IN STAMFORD
LEAD: NOW operating under the aliases of postmodernism and pluralism, Romanticism is as powerful as it has ever been in its career of some 200 years.
The reason, no doubt, is that this movement-cum-state of mind that previously required only a yearning for the ineffable today aspires to nothing more lofty than self-expression.


THE STORY UNFOLDS
LEAD: The Iran-contra hearings recessed last week, after Lt.
Col.
Oliver L. North agreed to testify starting July 7.
The Congressional committees heard new testimony that laid the groundwork for what is certain to be intense questioning about a broad cover-up attempt last fall.
Highlights of the week's developments follow.

Headliners; In the Spotlight
LEAD: Once again last week, the stage belonged to George Abbott as Broadway luminaries gathered to celebrate the producer's 100th birthday.
The party fell on the eve of the opening of Mr.
Abbott's 130th Broadway production, a revival of a half-century-old show entitled, what else, ''Broadway.'' Mr.
Abbott, who went from acting to writing, directing and producing, heard tributes from Helen Hayes, Jerome Robbins, Lillian Gish, Butterfly McQueen and others whose lights he helped brighten in productions stretching back to ''Coquette'' in 1927.


Learning Russian
LEAD: To the Editor: I read with interest the response to the question about language opportunity sources in Russian (Q &amp; A, May 17).

Robert P. Casey, caught in a legal and political bind, has opened the door for more litigation over a 20-year-old water diversion project at the eastern edge of Pennsylvania that has taken on national significance as a battle between developers and environmentalists.


The Meisner Era
LEAD:  To the Editor:


IN NICARAGUA, FOREBODINGS OF WARFARE WITHOUT END
LEAD: EVIDENCE of the accelerating war in the Nicaraguan countryside is everywhere.
Food and almost everything else are in even shorter supply than usual in the capital, and more young men seem to be going off to join the army.


ARTS GROUPS MEET AS HARTMAN SEASON IS CANCELED
LEAD: AS the opportunities to see live professional theater in the county have dwindled over the last decade, many residents have traveled to nearby Stamford, Conn., where the Hartman Theater Company has offered six shows a season.
But now, in the wake of the Hartman's economic problems, Stamford is facing a question familiar to theater-lovers in

A WINNING COMBINATION IN DARIEN
LEAD: GOOD news for families or couples who want to eat out without getting a bank loan: At the Black Goose Grille in Darien, there isn't a dinner entree above $13.95, and most are in the $10.95 range.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Track and Field  East Germany Looks Strong: East Germany dominated both the men's and women's competition in the first day of the European Track and Field cup yesterday in Prague.
The highlight was Marlies Goehr's victory in the women's 100-meter dash, with a time of 10.95 seconds.
The East Germans won all but one of eight women's events, topping the standings with 62 points.


HOW CAN THE METS GET BACK IN THE RACE?
LEAD: I believe the Mets can get back into the pennant race simply by waiting out their injuries and resolving a few minor problems, a solution demonstrated by the Yankee teams of the late 70's.

Last week, Mr.
Glass's companions were released but the American's whereabouts remained a mystery.

Wayne Jamison, U.S.A., a Presbyterian chaplain, performed the ceremony.


IS THERE GOLD AT THE END OF THIS RAINBOW OF ROMANCES?
LEAD: THE VIDEOTAPES - BLACK plastic cassettes with pretty pictures on the cover - hardly look like a revolution in the making.
But the ''Shades of Love'' series, four romance stories that were released last month by Karl-Lorimar Home Video, are breaking some fundamental rules of the video-cassette business.


BECKER FINDS HOME AWAY FROM HOME
LEAD: When Boris Becker said he was heading home after losing on Friday to Peter Doohan of Australia, he meant Monte Carlo, where he lives with his friend Benedicte Courtin.
This has been a sore point with West Germans, who still idolize Becker but have become a little more critical in the past year.


NEW YORKERS, ETC.
LEAD: MARRIAGE, which sort of went out of fashion for a while, at least in Manhattan, is back among the things that are all right to do.
It is, in fact, exceedingly popular with all age groups, but how those singles beyond the first flush of youth ever get to the altar, or even to a romantic supper by candlelight, is difficult to fathom.


The Business Equivalent of a Full-Service Hotel
LEAD: BUZZ YATES sells corporate jets out of a one-man office in Atlanta without even a nameplate on the door.
It's a low-budget operation.


Classical Music
LEAD: July 4 inspires any orchestra or festival worth its (stars and) stripes into an extravanganza of Americana, usually with fireworks obbligato.
This Saturday, there will be July 4 programs at Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass.; at Caramoor in Katonah, N.Y.; in Princeton with the New Jersey Symphony Summer Pops; at the Summer of Music on the Hudson in Tarrytown, N.J., and at the Charles Ives Center for the Arts in Danbury,

Maine Land Plan Is Approved
LEAD: The Maine Legislature has approved a $35 million bond issue to buy land for public parks, which, if approved by voters in November, will be the state's most ambitious land buying program.

LEAD: When local crops of delicate raspberries and hearty yellow squash arrive at farm stands next week, chances are they will find their way to some kitchens where fresh produce has rarely been tasted.


The Rocky Road To Press Freedom
LEAD: SOUTHERN friendliness in McCormick, S.C., was what impressed Ken Fortenberry when he first moved in with his family as the new owner of the town's weekly newspaper.

LEAD: To the Editor:


MAYOTTE STRUGGLES TO VICTORY
LEAD: Some players, according to Henri Leconte of France, were shocked into silence.
But Pat Cash of Australia pretended that nothing had changed.

GUARDS WON'T PLAY BALL IF INMATES CAN WATCH

Last Week's Tally in Key Eastern States
LEAD:  Senate  1.Fairness Doctrine: Vote to send to the Commerce Committee President Reagan's veto of a bill that would write into law a policy requiring broadcasters to present divergent views on controversial topics. (The action effectively kills the measure.) Approved 53 to 45, June 23.  2.


PERSONAL FINANCE
LEAD: PARENTS of children at the Walden School on Manhattan's Upper West Side will meet this week with school officials to ask a lot of questions about the institution's finances.
Walden earlier this month sought permission to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, catching the families of the school's 250 students by surprise.


Republican Anger With Regan Increases
LEAD: The New York State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, who has long been considered a political maverick, has been detaching himself even more than usual from his Republican colleagues in recent weeks - and angering party leaders in the process.


THE ADVANTAGES OF A NETWORK
LEAD: MOST of my photographer friends are by now deeply immersed in the arcane lore of computerdom.
Socketing RAM chips, mastering the art of MS-DOS and programming in D-Base have become at least as much fun for my friends as fine-tuning ISO speeds, arguing over zoom lenses and mixing defunct developers.


San Antonio Mayor in Drive To Unify Hispanic Americans
LEAD: Mayor Henry Cisneros of San Antonio has called for developing the first unified political agenda for diverse Hispanic American groups, including Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans and Puerto Ricans.


Ingrid Rockefeller to Marry

Asa Shiverick Jr. of Hunting Valley, Ohio.
The Rev.
William Shively performed the ceremony at St.
Christopher's-by-the-River Episcopal Church.


'UNTOUCHABLES' LURCHES BETWEEN PLAYING IT STRAIGHT AND PLAYING IT COOL
LEAD: BRIAN DE PALMA MIGHT have made a movie about Al Capone, but instead he decided to make a movie called ''The Untouchables.'' In its title and its choice of a hero, the G-man Eliot Ness, it salutes the famous television series that can still be found doing the rounds late at night, recalling the black-and-white simplicities of the 1950's and early 60's, and which even at the time looked back to the simplicities of a still earlier epoch.

Reagan said recently.
Boring indeed, the last few days of hearings.


BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL REPERTORY FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY
LEAD: WHAT are the traditional accompaniments for a Fourth of July cookout?


The Gold Watch
LEAD: IT HANGS, SUSPENDED IN A glass enclosure, near my record-playing equipment, and that means that I see it every day.
A gold pocket watch made in Schaffhausen, probably from the 1930's, emphatically unfashionable today but not old enough to be ''antique.'' The hands are stopped at 6:40.
In all likelihood, it was P.M., because I don't remember ever rewinding it since the watch passed into my hands at the railroad station in Budapest on April 15, 1939, the last day of my ''early life.


MOVING TO FLORIDA: MORE QUESTIONS
LEAD: I wish the interview with the Poryleses, who moved from the Northport area to Wellington, Fla., had been more probing  [ '' 'It's Like L.I. in the 1960's' - in Florida,'' May 31 ] .
When Mrs.
Poryles said they had moved for several reasons and named one as ''negative New York City influences creeping in,'' why wasn't she asked to define or identify these influences?


Pirates Honor Kiner
LEAD: RALPH KINER will be the focus of attention before the Mets play the Pirates in Pittsburgh on Sept. 19, when he will be stepping out of the Met broadcast booth to be honored by his old ball club.
The Pirates announced yesterday that they would retire Kiner's No. 4 in ceremonies before the game.
Pittsburgh will also retire Bill Mazeroski's No.


LUCY LUCKHARDT WEDS
LEAD: Lucy Anne Luckhardt, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Philip George Luckhardt of Easton, Conn., was married yesterday to Stephen Andrew Calder, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

The Rev.
Douglas J. Rumford officiated at the First Presbyterian Church in Fairfield, Conn.
Mrs.
Calder, a graduate of Wake Forest University, is a freelance writer.


A Native American Delicacy: Blue Corn
LEAD: The first blue corn I ever had was a purple-flecked tortilla, wrapped (untraditionally, I know now) around chicken and cheese, and smothered with green chili sauce and sour cream - an enchilada at a little restaurant called Sofio's in Telluride, Colo.
Recently arrived from Boston, I had never seen the stonelike shadowy surface of a blue corn tortilla against the pale soft green of chili sauce, the white of sour cream.

COLLEGES SHOULD SERVE ALL, NOT JUST SOME
LEAD: THE primary goals set for the National Collegiate Athletic Association's special convention, which begins tomorrow in Dallas, are to contain costs and to maintain a balance between intercollegiate athletics and other institutional programs.
The N.C.A.A.
Presidents Commission, which called the convention, has expressed its commitment to restoring integrity and fiscal sanity to our nation's collegiate athletics programs - a welcomed and necessary intervention.

EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO PEACE AND QUIET
LEAD: THE fitness craze has created a Monster - the zealot who isn't content just to pursue her sport, but who is bent on converting those of us who would rather not sweat or risk life and limb.
What is worse is that they do their nagging under the guise of having your best interests at heart.


NEWS SUMMARY: SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1987
LEAD:  International 3-19  Major concessions in South Korea are being prepared by senior members of the ruling party in an effort to draw the opposition into negotiations intended to defuse the country's political crisis.
Page 1  The complex Soviet pricing system, with surprisingly high or low prices for products of uneven quality, may be altered by a new program proposed by Mikhail S.


PAY CABLE DELIVERS A VARIETY OF PUNCH LINES
LEAD: PAY-CABLE'S COMEDY CARA-van keeps gathering speed, offering as periodic specials the kind of shows that once might have appeared weekly on commercial television or, at least, as familiar acts on ''The Ed Sullivan Show.'' With the exception of Johnny Carson and David Letterman, who can use interviews to flesh out their late-night jokes, most comedians have a tough time coming up with enough new material to fill the demands of a regular series.


COUNTRY MUSIC'S YOUNG TURKS DO IT AGAIN
LEAD: THE SUMMER OF 1987 PROMISES to be a heady season for American country music.
A genre that only two years ago seemed determined to suffocate itself in the musical equivalent of wall-to-wall carpeting is being revitalized by a new generation of raw, edgy young voices reasserting the continuity between contemporary country and time-honored strains of honky-tonk, rockabilly and older


PATRICIA OWENS MARRIES
LEAD: Patricia Jane Owens, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
John S. Owens of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Burton Charls Hurlock, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Woman's Life and Novels
LEAD:  To the Editor:


Torme, McKee, Schuur
LEAD: THE opportunity to hear pop-jazz singers in a big-band setting are precious few these days.
And when those voices are first-rate, the accompaniment of a band, rather than an intimate ensemble, can be a revelation.
Lonette McKee and Diane Schuur, two promising young jazz singers with strongly defined musical personalities, are familiar to New York audiences from stage and club appearances.


The Business School Brain Drain
LEAD: WHEN it came to hiring business Ph.D.'s, universities used to operate in a buyer's market.
Corporate America viewed the business doctors as too highbrow to be effective in a nuts-and-bolts business environment.
And the Ph.D.'s saw the corporations as too mercenary to provide the intellectual environment for which they hungered.


FUMBLING THE BALL ON DEFENSE FRAUD
LEAD: IN its much-publicized war against fraud by defense contractors, the Justice Department is trying to regroup after its most embarrassing surrender.


Pacific Isles: Paradise Lost In Economics
LEAD: This is the kind of South Pacific paradise that most Americans would love to be marooned on: lovely beaches, relaxed and friendly people, and bananas and coconuts always available for the picking.


SCHULTZ, NEW N.C.A.A. CHIEF, WON'T DODGE BIG ISSUES
LEAD: HE has lived, he says, according to a plan.
A high school and college sports star in Iowa, he wanted to coach.
And so, for 25 years, he did, on both the high school and college levels.
He wanted to get a graduate degree and become a businessman, and so he went to school part time and established a home-construction business.

Peasants Tell of Rights Abuses by Sandinistas
LEAD: The Nicaraguan Army has committed serious human-rights abuses in the southern border region of Nicaragua over the last two years, according to interviews with several refugees who fled to Costa Rica last month, accounts from other peasants still in southern Nicaragua and investigations by two American human-rights groups.


HOW CAN THE METS GET BACK IN THE RACE?
LEAD: The arrogant prima donnas at Shea didn't deserve to win it all last year.
Without Lady Luck shining on them, the Mets are another ordinary club.


Exploring The Kingdom of AIDS
LEAD: If I were a man, I do not think I would would want to be married to a woman who considered me ''a perfect first husband.'' Moreover, I thought Samantha Ellis's story of ''bringing'' a stagehand back to New York from the Midwest for a little sexual fun was quite shocking.


Queens Political Tools: Ad Agency and Papers
LEAD: In a continuing political struggle among Queens Democrats, Representative Gary L. Ackerman has two potent weapons at his disposal, a newspaper chain and an advertising, printing and consulting company in which he is the majority owner.


SEX CAN SPOIL THE SCENE
LEAD: ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY through ''Devil in the Flesh,'' Marco Bellocchio's updated Italian variation on Raymond Radiguet's 1923 French novel set during World War I, Mr.
Bellocchio takes a carefully considered leap toward artistic freedom but lands in an esthetic void.
A hard-core sex sequence, which might initially have seemed a bold decision, turns out to have been a fatal gaffe.


Concert: New York City Gay Men's Chorus
LEAD: SUCH events as Thursday's concert by the New York City Gay Men's Chorus are not the kind that forge ideas in the service of art.
What was celebrated in Alice Tully Hall, on the contrary, was the feeling of community and fellowship among the city's homosexuals - its warmth and worth framed in eminently forgettable music.


ANNE DAVID
LEAD: Anne David, an author and the wife of Hal David, the lyricist, died of lung cancer Friday at her home in Manhattan after a long illness.
She was 62 years old.


Murder Hits Home
LEAD: Samuel Freedman is right in saying that a small town forges bonds that last a lifetime.
Although I'm nine years older, his teachers were mine, and the Highland Fling was where I started as a reporter, too.


Graf Won't Pose
LEAD: STEFFI GRAF, the 18-year-old West German tennis star, has turned down a $270,000 offer to pose for a series of ''erotic photographs'' in the German-language edition of Penthouse magazine.


Scandal Watch, Upstate and Down
LEAD: An anonymous letter last week precipitated a quick switch of nominees to head the New York State Thruway Authority and prompted leading law-enforcement officials to hint at a possible statewide scandal.


AN ISLAND THAT SUMS UP HAWAII
LEAD: Other islands may be larger, have flashier hotels and restaurants and boast more shopping and golf courses.
But Kauai may be the most beautiful and most varied of all the Hawaiian Islands.


WIRE COMPANY WINS CHEAPER POWER
LEAD: THE past mingles with the space age in the lobby of the Hudson Wire Company in Ossining.
A wooden grandfather clock that served the company when it opened for business in 1904 stands against one wall and still keeps exact time.
On a nearby table, a glass display case holds samples of Hudson wire that went to the moon on Apollo 8 in 1968.


PICATINNY'S PRIZE
LEAD: The 5,800 civilian and 200 military personnel at the Picatinny Arsenal Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center have won the Army's 1986 Center of the Year award, placing first among 15 Army research and development centers and laboratories.


GORBACHEV MAKES HIS PUSH FOR THE GOOD LIFE
LEAD: MIKHAIL S. GORBACHEV did not mince words about the Soviet standard of living when he addressed the Communist Party's Central Committee last week.
Criticizing agencies and officials by name for failing to improve consumer goods and services, he said, ''We cannot put up with the big lag in community and consumer services, with an unsatisfactory situation in passenger transport, communications, tourism, physical training and sport.

BOSTON'S CHANCE FOR ITS OWN BATTERY PARK CITY
LEAD: THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF GET-ting a lot more office space into an existing downtown: squeezing it in or adding it on.

As so often happens on television, this taped segment of the ''Do-It-Yourself'' show tries to pack too much information into a single half hour.
The cassette does a good job of demonstrating most of the steps involved in cutting, fitting and installing both plywood and solid wood paneling, but because it tries to crowd in so much, some tricky working techniques are glossed over too quickly.

LEAD: The women had traveled 12,000 miles, all the way from Tokyo, and when they arrived in Manhattan yesterday, they had one man's name on their lips - Hiroshi Itsuki, the Frank Sinatra of Japan.
Just in case anyone wondered how deep was their love, that was his picture on the little green buttons they were wearing.


RED SOX SCUFF RHODEN
LEAD: There were letters about scuffed baseballs and there was a warning about scuffed baseballs, and there was anger about the letters and the warning about scuffed baseballs.
But there were no scuffed baseballs at Yankee Stadium yesterday - at least no baseballs that were scuffed by Rick Rhoden.

Give Brazil Another Chance
LEAD: Stunned by quadruple-digit inflation and a precipitous decline in foreign currency reserves, Brazil has agreed to tighten its belt.
That's welcome news.
After the failure of something-for-everyone economics, Brazil badly needs a dose of austerity.
The task for creditors is to persuade the Government to stay on a reform track but not press so hard that they undermine the country's fragile democracy.

How to Release Prisoners: Under Guard

LEAD: At the stroke of 3 o'clock yesterday, as marchers and spectators at the Gay/Lesbian Pride Parade fell silent along Fifth Avenue, a cloud of lavender and pink balloons rose from the steps of the New York Public Library, momentarily obscuring the library's stone lions and then dispersing in the breeze.

RECHARGED CARDINALS PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF
LEAD: BASED on the way the St.
Louis Cardinals hit when they won the National League pennant in 1985 and the way they have hit this season, most of which they have led the Eastern Division, it would seem that last season their astute manager, Whitey Herzog, simply misplaced the buttons he pushes in the dugout when he wants hits and runs.


DANCE: FRENCH TROUPE IN 2 WORKS AT DURHAM

Good Marriage in Brooklyn
LEAD: The $700 million Metrotech development project planned for downtown Brooklyn is based on a sound idea: Help big employers take advantage of the city's scientific and technical institutions.

THEATER: ''DREAMGIRLS,'' A MUSICAL, IS REVIVED
LEAD: THE marquee at the Ambassador Theater says that Broadway's new edition of ''Dreamgirls'' is ''the Michael Bennett production,'' but one has real reason to fear that the billing is a case of wishful promotion.
Mr.
Bennett, disabled by illness, has been inactive as a director for well over a year.
And how could his initial production of ''Dreamgirls,'' which ran from 1981 to 1985 at the Imperial, fit into the Ambassador anyway?
