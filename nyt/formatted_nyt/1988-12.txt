Gasoline Station Of Historic Note
LEAD: NOT too often does a gasoline station make the National Register of Historic Places.
But one in Yonkers on the Saw Mill River Parkway was deemed eligible by the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.


Healthful Recipies That Require Little Attention
LEAD: MY son was rummaging through some old books at a flea market last week and came upon a diet manual from the 1930's.
Glancing through it, he was amazed to read menus suggesting liver and bacon for breakfast, lamb chops for lunch and steak for dinner.


THEY CAN GET IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE
LEAD: LIKE A GIANT MATCHBOX LYING ON its side, the warehouse in Burbank stretches long, low and white toward the rough foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.
It stands in a neighborhood of body shops and small factories, its identity announced only by a small, red-lettered sign: Price Club.

Body Shop
LEAD: EVANGELINE CALVIN TELLS A story about a man who was new in Portland, Ore., and didn't know about her business.
Driving through town one night, he looked up and spotted a beautiful woman, completely undressed, standing in a lighted window.
Smitten - or maybe just curious - he returned the next day.

Sentimental Attachments, by the Dozen
LEAD: THIS side of a Tyrolean Hat convention, it would be hard to find anything to equal the proliferation of gimcracks and gewgaws that people are affixing to one piece of clothing or another.
Distinguished ornamentalogists surmise that the mania may have something to do with the onset of the Christmas season, which brings out the kid in all of us.

LEAD: An out-of-competition testing program fully supported by the athletes was unanimously approved today by The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track and field.

Practical Traveler; What U.S. Pays for Trips
LEAD: Like most travelers who work out a budget before their trip, the Federal Government calculates the cost of travel in various places for employees on official business - everyone from State Department couriers to White House staff members.
The result is compiled in a monthly publication, ''Maximum Travel Per Diem Allowances for Foreign Areas,'' listing a daily rate for lodging and meals in about 1,000 cities.


NEWS SUMMARY
LEAD:  INTERNATIONAL/3-33


TEARING APART EASTERN AIRLINES
LEAD: It is impossible to understand the cold war at Eastern without understanding the airline unions' earlier experience with Frank Lorenzo at Continental Airlines.
On Sept. 24, 1983, Mr.
Lorenzo put Continental into bankruptcy, after negotiations with the carrier's unions failed to win the $100 million in concessions he claimed were needed to make the airline profitable.


East Lyme Neighbors Battle Hunters
LEAD: A TRUCK with three hunters in the cab and a freshly killed deer in the back, rolled up to the check station for hunters at the Stone's Ranch Military Reservation in East Lyme.

POSTINGS: Poughkeepsie Progress; A River Project
LEAD: Like many other river cities, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., is cut off from its waterfront by highways and railroad tracks.
Worse, what little land does lie between Route 9 and the Hudson River south of the Mid-Hudson Bridge was cleared of houses 20 years ago in the name of urban renewal.
There it has been left empty as if to not block the views of passing motorists and Amtrak passengers.


THE SPY WHO SAVED ME - A THRILLER STARRING JOHN LE CARRE
LEAD: As with first love, most book publishers vividly can recall the circumstances of their first big success.
I still remember the very low point I had reached in my short career more than a quarter-century ago before the miracle happened.
Defying all the standard odds, a book I acquired from London as a result of my very first trip there - a grimly realistic thriller by an unknown


Jacalyn Barnett Wed To Dr. Ronald Ruden

Ronald Alan Ruden, a son of Arthur Ruden of Garden City, L.I., and the late Jeannette Ruden.
Rabbi Joel S. Goor performed the ceremony at the Lycee Francais in New York.


POSTINGS: Weehawken Project; Condos on a Pier
LEAD: Town houses line a pier on the western shore of the Hudson River, each affording a Circle Line-level view of Manhattan, and ferry boats whisk their business-suited owners across the water to work.
This is not the fuzzy vision of an urban planner, but the reality John Tedesco is creating in Weehawken, N.J.


OLD-FASHIONED AND UP TO DATE
LEAD: HOME COOKING (Knopf, $17.95), by the novelist Laurie Colwin, is as much memoir as cookbook and as much about eating as cooking.
The recipes are for the kinds of things your mother used to make: baked beans with Boston brown bread, pot roast, potato pancakes -savory, filling and labor-intensive.
There is a chapter titled ''Easy Cooking for Exhausted People,'' which offers a recipe for vegetarian chili calling for four kinds of beans - one to be found at the health food store, another at the Indian store!


An Infamous Anniversary for Topical Collectors
LEAD: THE speech by Franklin Delano Roosevelt began like this:


The Case for a High-Estrogen President
LEAD: To the Editor:


Q and A
LEAD:  Choosing a Tour  Question: After years of vacationing solo, in countries where we could communicate, we are contemplating joining a tour in countries like China or Indonesia whose languages we cannot speak.
How do we pick a tour organizer?
Is there a consumers' report that rates tour operators?

LEAD: Experts on the Middle East, including a senior foreign policy adviser to President-elect Bush, say the next administration must move swiftly to show its interest in promoting Arab-Israeli peace through active American diplomacy.


Weaving Symbols Into Interfaith Union
LEAD: WE began to see the implications of our interfaith marriage when Isaac, age 3, announced to a dinner guest that, pretty soon, ''the baby Jesus was coming down the chimney to light the Hanukkah candles and that's when we would get our presents.'' Assimilation is the special gift of the young.


WHY THIS TREK COST $3,890
LEAD: Mouths went agape and eyes bugged out when I told friends about my recent African mountaineering trek.
Unfortunately, it was not my rhapsodic accounts of the moonlit snows of Kilimanjaro or dawn at 15,000 feet on Mount Kenya that so astonished them.
No, it was the cost of the trip - a 19-day expedition run by Mountain Travel, the oldest and largest adventure travel company in the United States.


George Glasser Weds Alexandra de Trenck
LEAD: At the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York, Alexandra de Trenck, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

C.
A.
Cameron of Harrison, N.Y., were married yesterday by the Rev.
Charles A. Amstein.


TEARING APART EASTERN AIRLINES
LEAD: Eastern Airlines is one more example of a takeover gone sour, and this may well be a portent of things to come (''Tearing Apart Eastern Airlines,'' by William Stockton, Nov. 6).
First, Frank Lorenzo saddles Eastern Airlines with hundreds of millions of dollars in debt with his hostile takeover.
Then he complains that Eastern is losing money, so he tries to bust the unions and dismisses thousands of employees.


Finding a Parking Space Could Drive You Crazy
LEAD: BRIAN used to ride to work with me.
As he approached the car on this particular morning, I noticed that he was limping. ''What happened?'' I asked. ''Skinned my knee,'' he replied shortly, evidently not wishing to discuss it. ''How did you do it?'' I asked, ignoring his right to privacy. ''Saving a parking space.


TRAILBLAZERS OF THE NEW HIGH FINANCE
LEAD: ON THE MORNING OF OCT. 19, 1987, A CAUTIOUS, SOBER GENTLEMAN named Stanley A. Seneker arrived at the 12th floor of Glass House, Ford Motor Company's world headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., to assume his new duties as chief financial officer.
The events of the day, he recalls with typical understatement, came as ''quite a surprise.

Yanks Look for One More Pitcher
LEAD: Dave LaPoint is the first.
The second, the Yankees hope, will come in a trade in the next few days.


A Painter Finally Gets His Due
LEAD: A TYPICAL roundup of major New Jersey artists inevitably includes Richard Anuskiewicz and George Segal and just as inevitably omits Hughie Lee-Smith.
Meanwhile, in the larger world, there are painters half Mr.
Lee-Smith's age - 73 - and half as gifted who have long since had retrospectives.
So it is a pleasure to report that Mr.


Giving the Look Of a Changing Guard
LEAD: The totems of shifting power are everywhere.
At the Palm Restaurant downtown, the owners are getting ready for what they call ''the changing of the guard'' - when they remove the caricatures of Ronald and Nancy Reagan in the center of the dining room and replace them with ones of George and Barbara Bush.


Reviews/Music; Eddy and Kalish Duo
LEAD: Timothy Eddy and Gilbert Kalish, who form a satisfying cello and piano duo, have the kind of talents that almost exclude big international careers.
One found in their Town Hall recital Wednesday night no sign of flamboyance, no spectacular gestures, no larger-than-life musical personalities; instead a thorough understanding of their material and a selfless affection for it.


Korea Asks: Is Disgrace Enough for Its Ex-President?
LEAD: FOR the seven years of his repressive rule, President Chun Doo Hwan dominated South Korea's images of itself: Nearly every day Koreans were fed innocuous pictures of him dedicating a new highway or inspecting a factory, while few dared to openly criticize his Government.


WHAT'S INANNA? MODEM? SKA? A QUIZ FOR THE WINTER SOLSTICE
LEAD: Once upon a time, argues E. D. Hirsch Jr. in his 1987 book, ''Cultural Literacy,'' when schools and colleges offered a standard curriculum, there existed a great shared body of knowledge.
Mourning the end of those days, Mr.
Hirsch offered in their memory some 5,000 terms - passwords to savviness: book titles, authors, dates, scientific concepts, sayings, historical events.


For Greek Ruling Party, the Plays Still Sting
LEAD: One scene in the play shows an elderly politician frolicking with a young woman, while another has beggars in the street lamenting Greece's worsening economic plight and the political scandals rocking the country.
Yet another has dancers inviting the audience to join in refrains calling on the Government to go.


Spray-Can Painting
LEAD: FOR painting or applying other finish to small or detailed items such as furniture, outdoor equipment and decorative hardware, no method is quicker or easier than spraying with an aerosol finish, the type available in pressurized cans.


A Gift of Hope When Cold and Hunger Are Life's Constant Companions; A Hand Reaches Out To Brooklyn's Poor
LEAD: With more than 2,000,000 people, Brooklyn is a borough of promising growth, but also a borough scarred by poverty.
Major efforts are succeeding in attracting new business and industry.
But large numbers of the unemployed remain dependent and despairing.


Stepping Down
LEAD: A graduate student at the University of Rochester found a notable lack of originality in some of the published papers of Dr.
Shervert H. Frazier, an eminent psychiatrist.
The student, Paul Scatena, last summer brought his concerns to the attention of officials at Harvard Medical School, where Dr.
Frazier was a professor and head of one of Harvard's principal teaching hospitals.


Steroid Use Is Not Just an Adult Problem
LEAD: IN the last two months the subject of anabolic steroids has maintained a highly visible profile in the news.
Although interest was initially kindled by the Ben Johnson incident, public concern has been further heightened by reports that elite athletes represent only a small percentage of steroid users.


Up to New Tricks
LEAD: ''LOOKS LIKE A MOVIE,'' SAID THE MIDDLE-AGED guy in the golf cap to his sleek young playmate in the acid-washed skirt.
It was just after 1 A.M. and they were holding hands, gawking from the second-floor pedestrian bridge in the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City.
Down below, a film crew was toiling in the brilliantly lit parking lot on Mississippi Avenue.


At American Joe's Bar he Twists Are Political
LEAD: American Joe Miedusiewski could be one of the young professionals who have been lured in recent years to East Baltimore by inexpensive housing and safe streets.


Retailers Optimistic at Season's Start
LEAD: IT is not very often that both shoppers and merchants are smiling at the same time.
In the hurly-burly world of holiday shopping, they are often adversaries.
But despite some fears to the contrary, that does not seem to be the case so far for the 1988 holiday season.


Keeping Alive Memory of Dukakis
LEAD: Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis and Mr.
Bush may have had a ''good discussion'' in a spirit of ''good will'' Friday, as the President-elect put it.
But the competitive edge has not completely faded.
In the transition press office sits a platform, which moves up and down to adjust to varying heights, labeled: ''The Mike Dukakis Memorial Podium.


Prospects; Mexico's Stumbling Steps
LEAD: Mexico's new President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was sworn into office on Thursday.
After his inauguration, Mr.
Salinas said the payments Mexico makes on its $104 billion foreign debt are unacceptable.
He explained that Mexico's priority will not be to pay its debt, but to return to growth.
Is Mexico's economy ready to grow?


IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester; Building Bonuses for Public Amenities
LEAD: LAST month, a four-year-old art gallery in Marlborough opened a branch in downtown Hartford where it had no decorating costs and will pay no rent.
It is the first beneficiary of a city zoning ordinance passed in 1984 that gives developers of commercial buildings extra square footage in return for providing space for public use.


QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Next Week; What Stands Out In the N.F.L. This Year?
LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.
Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


The Benefits of Unemployment
LEAD: IT took me two months to muster the courage to file for unemployment benefits.
A friend told me how her unemployment benefits had enabled her to continue her graduate studies while she searched for a job, and I thought that perhaps I too deserved to put in my claim.


Should Steroid Use by Atheletes Be Allowed
LEAD: If athletes are willing to risk liver, kidney and heart failure for an edge in their quest for mega-salaries in the short term, can anyone seriously believe that the owners, benevolent souls that they are, will move to curb steroid use?
AL FORINO  Middlebury, Conn.


GRIPPED BY GOLD FEVER
LEAD: THE SLEEPY TOWN OF ELKO, Nev., used to erupt once a year when local ranchers drove their cattle to the railhead, and cowboys, their wallets crammed with cash, headed for the casinos and brothels on and around Idaho Street.
Today, in Elko, whose population has swelled from 8,000 to 16,000 since 1980, it's sort of like that all year round.


Crews Chosen for 4 Shuttle Flights
LEAD: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has announced four crews for future missions of the space shuttle, including the shuttle's first black commander and a number of space rookies.


Capitalism's Flaws
LEAD: To the Editor:


They're Dreaming of a Green Christmas


Should Steroid Use by Atheletes Be Allowed
LEAD: Probably not, because of the ever mounting medical evidence that steroids cause severe long term physical maladies.
But in a society that condones team doctors injecting injured players with cortisone and other pain numbing potions, which surely cause as much damage as steroids, one needs to look at the greater question of ''What price victory?


Stepping Up
LEAD: Top Presidential aides do not move laterally out of the White House: those who do not step down into obscurity tend to step up on the career ladder.
Last week came the turn of President Reagan's national security adviser, Lieut.
Gen.
Colin L. Powell.
The White House announced that General Powell would be nominated for a fourth star - Senate consent is considered a formality - and, come next April, given responsibility for defending the American mainland.


Reviews/Music; 16-Voice Choir Performs in a Multitude of Styles
LEAD: Among those who love choral music, there are those who love to be swept away by the grandeur, volume and sheer vocal heftiness of a full-scale choir.
Chamber choirs, on the other hand, are a rarer delicacy.
What they offer, potentially, is a sleek, refined sound, and a kind of transparency that only the most finely trained large choirs can approach.


The Party Line Isn't So Straight Anymore
LEAD: AS Senate Democrats elected their new majority leader last week, they did so on an optimistic note: If they were still out of power in the White House, they were far from powerless in Washington.
Paradoxically, one reason the Democrats had anything at all to celebrate as a party was that among the voters back home, party labels are meaning less and less.


Islanders' Losing Streak at 7
LEAD: The effort was there, the goals were not.
A 4-2 loss in Pittsburgh tonight capped a disastrous three-game trip for the Islanders and extended their losing streak to seven games.


No Longer the Only Game in Town
LEAD: Since World War II, the United States has been able to count on its dominance of the non-Communist world's weapons trade to help further its foreign policy goals, create jobs and profits, and help the nation's export balance.
But to the consternation of American industry executives and Pentagon officials, that dominance is in serious danger.

TEARING APART EASTERN AIRLINES
LEAD: Your article implied that Eastern airlines might become profitable if its long-term employees would grant concessions.
What you should have asked is why Frank Lorenzo cannot make Continental Airlines profitable.
After declaring bankruptcy to eliminate Continental Airlines' unions, he had among the lowest labor costs in the industry.


Answering the Mail
LEAD: Q. Our asphalt shingle roof has dark streaks of mildew on it, even though there are no overhanging trees that keep it shaded.
When we had mildew on the siding, we scrubbed it off with a mixture of bleach and water.

CACTUS AND HATHAWAY MEN
LEAD: In looking ahead to the Giants' schedule not long ago, Phil Simms spoke of having to play ''St.
Louis.'' He meant Phoenix, but he's not alone.
Out of habit many pro football people still refer to ''St.

ARCHITECTURE
LEAD: Architecture books this year have struck a pleasing balance between those that have focused on the work of individual designers and those that have cut a wide swath through history.
The process of unearthing important architects who have been given short shrift by architectural writers in the past continues apace, bringing us several fine monographs about architects from earlier in this century.


This Traditional 'Aida' Focuses On Real People

''And I'm convinced that one can make an operatic evening, set in the period the composer designated, seem alive and telling to a modern audience.

LEAD: On the crowded sidewalks of Brighton Beach, where shoppers speaking Russian trawl expectantly through the stores as if they were still in the Soviet Union, Mikhail S. Gorbachev is getting some unlikely praise in the days before he arrives in New York.


PLEASED AS PUNCH
LEAD: Tis the season to partake of strong drink from bowls.
Why this is so is unclear.
Probably because there are lots of parties and it's cheaper and easier to mix a lot of things in a bowl than it is to handle the crowd on a drink-by-drink basis.
Whatever the concoction in the bowl - and some can be, well, startling - it is invariably called a punch, a tradition dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries, the golden age of rum.

CLASSICS? BAH, HUMBUG: A SYMPOSIUM
LEAD: The sentimentality of Christmas sometimes brings out the Scrooge in each of us, and this year we asked the participants in our Christmas symposium to play literary Scrooge and tell us about the classics that make them most grouchy.
The literary pantheon has always had fluid membership, and when our Scrooges revealed who they thought should be evicted from its halls, it became evident that nobody is guaranteed eternal tenure.


Like Having Another Set of Eyes
LEAD: Pausing at a critical moment in the operation, when the slightest slip could have devastating results, the surgeon monitors the patient's vital signs as they scroll across a corner of the computer screen. ''Show me the latest sequence of CT scans,'' he asks, and the technician at the computer on the other side of the operating room types in the appropriate commands.


Reviews/Music; An Ex-Prodigy Returns to the Piano
LEAD: It would be no bad thing if the passionless correct piano-competition winners everybody complains about had to spend an evening listening to Richard Gresko, or someone like him, play the piano.
Mr.

Jazz That Flies Beyond The Pigeonholes
LEAD: SINCE THE 1960'S, THE WORD jazz has put in some overtime.
The music's original impulses have spread, as surely as a river entering a broad delta, into different styles and movements Unfortunately, the kinds of jazz musicians who have reached the status of public figure have never reflected jazz's breadth.

Deficit Estimate Is Doubled
LEAD: SAGGING tax and gaming revenues have caused the estimated state budget deficit for the current year to double in a month, to $116 million from $56 million.


Why Everyone Knew About the Secret Shuttle Mission
LEAD: NOT all secrets can be kept all that secret.
The Defense Department was reminded of this in the days before Friday's launching of the space shuttle Atlantis.
The payload tucked away in the shuttle's cargo bay was classified top secret.
But everyone, it seemed, had a good idea of what it was.


Review/Rock; Bobby Previte Leads A Fusionist Quartet
LEAD: On the last tune of his set at the Knitting Factory on Tuesday night, the composer and drummer Bobby Previte set his two guitarists battling.
Looping and fierce metallic melodies snarled away at each other, only to smooth out into a country-styled riff, then into rock power chords.
Mr.
Previte's group played with the exuberant power of the best rock bands, as it had during much of the show, Mr.


For Japan's Working Women, a Slow Recognition
LEAD: On Japanese television, there are, by and large, two kinds of women.

STRIKE UP THE CHOIR!
LEAD: I read Stephen Jay Gould's article ''Strike Up the Choir!'' (Nov. 6) with great interest and greater nostalgia.

Books for Women Who Read About Men - Too Much

In the past several years, cash registers have jingled with the sale of such best sellers as ''Women Who Love Too Much,'' ''Women Men Love, Women Men Leave,'' and ''Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them.''


NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Randolph, Me.; Rail Line Goes Back to Nature

Carson Deserves The 'Group Hug'
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


NEW JERSEY OPINIONIn Lieu of Flowers, Please Send Chocolates
LEAD: IT was a race to the grave.
Big Jim and Mary were dying - he of heart disease, she of cancer.
The two cousins had grown up on opposite sides of the street.
Now, on opposite sides of the Hudson, they were engaged in a macabre pas de mort.


Should Steroid Use by Atheletes Be Allowed
LEAD: This is how it was meant to be: man or woman against nature.
Brawn and brains against the brute.
Since Milo started to lift the calf, one man did it himself, and to him goes the glory and satisfaction of a deed well done.

Annual Report On the Mob
LEAD: MEMBERS OF ORGANIZED CRIME HAVEN'T fared all that well in court this year.
Yet, in movies, they've come up winners in three oddball comedies that are making some observers feel queasy.


Should Steroid Use by Atheletes Be Allowed
LEAD: Absolutely.
Their use or non-use should replace the current definition as to what is an amateur and what is a professional.
The Olympic Games would regain their appeal.
Our fans and sports commentators would revel in what would amount to the public suicide of its greatest pro stars after a winning performance and the right message would be sent to our young about the dangers of substance abuse.


On Language; Gifts of Gab for 1989
LEAD: AN ITALIAN, WHEN bidding farewell formally, says &gt;arrivederci (literally, ''to see each other again'').
When more relaxed, the person waving goodbye says &gt;ciao. (I pause for the reader to ask: Where does that come from?) &gt;Ciao is a dialectical alteration of &gt;schiavo, meaning ''slave''; the original phrase that was used in saying ''bye-bye, bambino'' was &gt;sono vostro schiavo, ''I am your slave.

Tower Still Waits To Hear From Friend
LEAD: In the category of ''they also serve who only stand and wait,'' John G. Tower is still waiting to hear if his old friend, Mr.

Tower as Defense Secretary.


Review/Theater; 'Angalak,' Or, Inuit High Jinks
LEAD: If all ghosts were as good-natured as the three that supply most of the action in Walt Vail's ''Angalak,'' who would not want to be haunted?
To be sure, the one who in life was Ivik, the favorite husband of the title character, is a bit stiff in his ghostly existence as a caribou.
But the two others, also sometime husbands of Angalak (at the same time, it turns out) - Tilgut, a hunter turned after death into an affectionate bear, and


Tomorrowland, With a Dash of Fantasyland
LEAD: THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF talk about how bizarre the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's new Pavilion for Japanese Art is.
Well, yes: any building that has a roof with fins that look like mastodons, walls of folded translucent panels, and an interior full of swooping ramps and curving balconies can hardly be called conventional.


EDITOR'S CHOICE: THE BEST BOOKS OF 1988

POSTINGS: What's an Architrave?; Village Guide
LEAD: ''Nineteenth Century Dwelling Houses of Greenwich Village'' is a beginner's guide to architectural appreciation, chock full of drawings and diagrams that distinguish a lintel from a newel, an entablature from an architrave.
But this 16-page booklet is not meant to decorate a coffee table.
Used properly - as it is by those who borrow copies from the Association of Village

EMBITTERED ARABS STILL PRESSING U.S. FOR PEACE EFFORT

Wrong Position For Don Baylor
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Hospitals Overwhelmed as Poor In New York City Search for Care
LEAD: The AIDS epidemic that health-care experts said would overwhelm New York City hospitals has clearly taken its toll and will continue to do so.
So has a nursing shortage, a shortage of beds and the rise in drug abusers seeking treatment.


Review/Music; Blomstedt Leads 20th-Century Bill
LEAD: The San Francisco Symphony is in sound hands and good condition, to judge by its Carnegie Hall concert under Herbert Blomstedt Friday evening.
It seems to face no great problems beyond those that are the birthright of today's symphony orchestra, chief among these being a certain risk of uninterestingness.


A Christmas Non-Tie
LEAD: With a happy heart, a New Yorker whose brother-in-law admires her taste went shopping at a famous store.
He wanted a tie to go with his new greenish tweed jacket.


Sarah Bower Is Engaged
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Hamilton Bower of Bronxville, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Sarah Palmer Bower, to Paul Herbert Maenner, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

A May wedding is planned.
Miss Bower, a graduate of Brown University, is a marketing associate with World Book in Chicago.


You Can Never Have Too Many Animals
LEAD: IT looks as if I'm probably never going to have a goat farm.
The book ''Raising Goats the Modern Way'' tells you everything you need to know except where the zoning laws will let you add a goat or two to your family and still be within commuting distance of a city.
Or how to convince your spouse that raising goats is not the wackiest idea since ''Star Wars.

LEAD: At St.
Ignatius Loyola Roman Catholic Church in New York, Barbara Anne Lane, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

KOCH RENEWS CALL ON SCHOOL TENURE
LEAD: Mayor Koch yesterday took his call for change in the school principals' tenure system directly to the principals, who were meeting in their annual convention.


Rekindling the Good Spirit Behind the 'L' Word
LEAD: FOR today's politicians, being branded with the ''L'' word is seen to be as disfiguring as the scarlet ''A'' that Hester Prynne had to bear upon her breast.


A LOWLY FISH GOES UPSCALE
LEAD: IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA, THE livin' has never been all that easy -even when the fish were jumpin'.
In the nation's poorest state, many a hungry family relied on a regular diet of catfish from the muddy pond down the road.
The big, ugly, bottom-feeding fish might have an earthy flavor but, once cleaned, dredged in cornmeal and deep-fried, it made for a tasty meal.


Walker Ponders Quitting, or Moving On
LEAD: Even though Wesley Walker is catching passes once again, the season has upset him so much he says he is thinking of quitting football after this campaign.


Correction
LEAD: An obituary by The Associated Press in some copies last Sunday about Marian P. Welch, editor of two John Birch Society publications, described the namesake of the society incorrectly.

He was killed by Chinese Communists on Aug.


'The Laws Are Not Well-Enforced

POISON GAS TRACES ARE FOUND IN IRAQ

VIVE LA DIFFERENCE
LEAD: Congratulations to Mark Hunter on having found the right person (About Men, ''Vive la Difference,'' Nov. 13).
Surely, he owes American women no apology or explanation for marrying outside his own country.
But his personal good luck should create no occasion for bad-thing American feminists.
If, at times, we have had to move away from conventional manners, it has been in state legislatures, the halls of Congress and the offices of university presidents and corporate boards of directors.


Throw Out the Lifeline: Remember to Help the Neediest Cases; A Woman, Battered, Stands Up
LEAD: Wanda A. did not leave her boyfriend after he shot at her and missed.
She did not leave him when he tore their apartment to shreds and forced her to have sex with him.

When Playing Santa, Avoid the Red Ink
LEAD: Inviting displays of holiday gifts in every store window and mall can tempt even the most level-headed of shoppers to throw caution to the winds and spend more than they had planned.
The financial challenge of the holidays is to buy the most suitable gifts for everyone on your list without regretting those purchases when the bills start rolling in next month.


ART
LEAD: One of the casualties of evolution is the book on art that made sense, fitted into anyone's overcoat pocket and gave us something that we could not get anywhere else.
It was cheap.
Often it carried no pictures.
In time, it became so much a part of ourselves that we didn't like to go on a journey without it.

So did I. But the results were always the same: match to Dad.


Stepping Into Jeopardy
LEAD: Another politician might be daunted by the prospect of spending 20 years in prison and paying fines of $17.3 million, but for Salvador Jorge Blanco, a former President of the Dominican Republic, the larger issue is honor.
Mr.
Jorge Blanco, whom Dominican courts convicted in absentia on corruption charges last month, returned home last week to try to reopen the case.


TALKING: Employees; Avoiding Personnel Minefields
LEAD: THE growth of protective personnel legislation in the last decade and the increasing number of challenges based on allegations of wrongful dismissal or unlawful labor practices has made the hiring, handling and dismissal of employees a legal minefield.


The Day New York Stopped
LEAD: Consider next Wednesday, Dec. 7, 1988.
It's not likely to be as famous as its 1941 predecessor, the day of Pearl Harbor.
Still, it may live on in a lesser infamy.
Wednesday promises to be a day for the Guinness Book of Gridlock.


Garfield's Picture, To Teach a Lesson
LEAD: Even though the President-elect is rarely around, there is tight security at the Federal office building on Connecticut Avenue downtown where the transition headquarters is located.
All visitors must go through a metal detector, a computerized I.D. check and several layers of guards.


FOUR MONTHS OF NEW YEAR'S IN ASIA
LEAD: One Dec. 31 I wore a silly hat at the American Club in Tokyo.
Revelers were tooting into horns, pecking cheeks at midnight, turning prosaically tipsy.
In this expatriate stronghold - with its aerobic classes, basketball courts, bottomless coffee - we were saluting the incoming year in classic Western fashion.


Beneath A Bridge Lie Mystery, Fear
LEAD: MY 7-year-old son, two of his friends, and I were on an evening walk to the little black bridge not far from our home.

WHERE DAVIS LED THE CONFEDERACY (Kit Kittle)
LEAD: The War Between the States, as the Civil War is still referred to in the South, ''proved secession to be impractical.

NORTHEAST JOURNAL
LEAD:  Crystal Ball Ignites Fire


Review/Pop; Ruben Blades's Salsa
LEAD: In Latin music, Ruben Blades has staked out a territory all his own, where salsa, jazz, politics and literature meet and meld.
His group, Son del Solar (formerly Seis del Solar) mixes Latin percussion with the advanced harmonies and electric keyboards of a jazz-fusion band; his songs, in Spanish, tell politically informed stories, invoke childhood memories of his native Panama or set Gabriel Garcia Marquez's plots to music.


A New Tune at the Chamber Music Society
LEAD: IN POLITICS, DEMOCRATIC TRADITION dictates that when the chief of state leaves office his cabinet resigns en masse to allow the heir to power complete freedom in choosing his associates.
That makes sense.
His closest aides, after all, will be important factors in his success or failure.
No leader can be better than those who serve under him.


At Kentucky, Basketball Sags Under Weighty Problems
LEAD: Eddie Sutton walked briskly down the hallway that leads from his office at Memorial Coliseum to the coaches locker room.

Stuck in the Middle Of a 'Soft Market'
LEAD: IN November 1987, my husband and I began a voyage of discovery.
On the way, we discovered our unlimited capacity for rejection, disappointment and depression.
Since our trip began, we found that selling a house, especially one in which we've lived for 25 years, can be psychologically and physically demanding and debilitating.


Steel Cocoon Heralds Municipal Building Face Lift
LEAD: The bureaucratic center of New York City is disappearing beneath a labyrinth of tubes, nets and catwalks and will not fully emerge again until 1993.
But the scaffolding creeping 580 feet up the Municipal Building on Centre Street in lower Manhattan will stop short of obscuring ''Civic Fame,'' the 25-foot gilded statue that stands on top.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Storage Buildings; Windfall Profits Inspiring Moving Days
LEAD: MOVING and storage companies buy warehouses in low-budget locations for storage capacity, not redevelopment potential.
But when surroundings improve, the warehouses often become far more valuable as real estate deals than as storage centers.

THE MARKET GIVES ROMANCE A BOOST
LEAD: THE STOCKBROKER was working his way through piles of sell orders, that morning of Oct. 20, 1987, when the telephone rang.
It was Tisch calling, with a request to buy $300,000 in blue-chip stocks.
The move was very much in keeping with the contrarian strategies of Laurence A. Tisch, C.E.O. of the Loews Corporation and CBS, but the voice on the phone belonged to his daughter-in-law, Susan H.

A Seafood Heritage, Home at Last&gt;

Fare of the Country; Dense, Rich Plum Pudding in London
LEAD: ''HALLO!
A great deal of steam!
The pudding was out of the copper.
A smell like a washing-day!
That was the cloth!
A smell like an eating-house and a pastry cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!
That was the pudding.
In half a minute, Mrs.
Cratchit entered - flushed, but smiling proudly - with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.

A YANK GETS TO MAKE HIS OWN BRITISH MOVIE
LEAD: IN A DISUSED MENTAL HOSPITAL preserved from demolition because of its architectural interest, on the gentrified banks of London's Regent's Canal, in the side streets, doorways, parks and living rooms of once-middle-class districts of northwest London now housing a population so diverse that everything from electioneering pamphlets to advertisements for job vacancies are printed in five languages - the dream project of the American film director Randal


TEARING APART EASTERN AIRLINES
LEAD: Your article on Eastern Airlines served to emphasize how little regard companies have for their employees, especially long-term ones.

UPWARDLY MOBILE
LEAD: THE STEEP GRANITE WALL OF PYWIACK Dome, an 800-foot-high chunk of rock in Yosemite National Park, glitters in the afternoon sun.
I am 150 feet up its sheer face, thin air beneath my heels, supporting my weight with clenched toes within my thin climbing shoes on ''ledges'' of rock not much wider than a saltshaker.

NINE SHRINES TO THE OFFBEAT IN ROME
LEAD: They are sometimes more than a little time-consuming to find, and their opening and closing hours are as mysterious and erratic as the Roman weather in spring.
Nevertheless, the less-publicized, out-of-the-way museums of Rome can provide the persistent visitor with such exquisite novelties as chandeliers made from monks' bones, locks of hair from the great

If RJR Nabisco Can Do It, Why Can't I?
LEAD: I HAVE KNOWN STEVE K. FOR ALMOST 20 years.
We were in law school together and then worked at the Federal Trade Commission for about one year.

Bed and Breakfast
LEAD: To the Editor: Donald Goddard's generally useful article on London's B &amp; B's is marred by an uncritical enthusiasm that conflicts with my experience.

Polly Martin Wed To Marc Schaefer
LEAD: The marriage of Polly Day Martin and Marc Kingsley Schaefer took place yesterday in New York at the apartment of Mr. and Mrs.
John Bryson, stepfather and mother of the bride.
The Rev.
Beatrice Blair, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony.


Union Vote Could Change Tradition
LEAD: When Ray Carney says it takes courage to run for president of Local 560 of the teamsters here, that may be more than the usual campaign rhetoric.
After all, the last man to campaign against the leadership was beaten and garroted with piano wire.


North, Northwest
LEAD: President Reagan has done few things as sharply disappointing to many of his conservative supporters as his decision, made known last week, not to pardon Oliver North before trial.
A pardon for the former Marine colonel had become the passion of the political right.


Transactions
LEAD:  Baseball


Lucian Freud: The Unblinking Eye
LEAD: LUCIAN FREUD HAS BECOME a figure of popular myth, an artist poised between the underworld and the aristocracy, a kind of slumming Faust who prowls lowlife pubs and eats woodcock for breakfast.


5 BODIES PROMPT HUNT FOR A SLAYER
LEAD: The skeletal remains of five people have been found along two highways here in southeastern Massachusetts, prompting concern that one killer might be responsible.


Pearl Harbor: A Peaceful Sunday Is
LEAD: IT was a cold but bright Sunday in early winter, I remember, when I unlocked and opened Houghton's Drug Store in a little farming town in northwest Missouri.
It was almost 1 P.M.
Church was over, and I had had a quick sandwich at home.


Australia Goes Asian
LEAD: OUR NEIGHBORHOOD garage is running a special on tires.
Nothing unusual about that.
Next week, perhaps, it will be batteries.
What is unusual is that the sale signs are in Japanese.


Wilander and Agassi Eliminated
LEAD: This has been a year of change in men's tennis, introducing fresh faces and scrambled rankings.
Now, in the Nabisco Masters, even a couple of players who have been responsible for establishing a new order have been victimized.
Those fans holding official programs at Madison Square Garden yesterday may cross off the names of one heart throb and the No.


FOOD &amp; WINE
LEAD: Like any well-chosen guest, a book about food or drink should be thoughtfully selected.
Whether the cook's taste is exotic or home-style, highly technical or rather haphazard, there are outstanding choices this season, ranging from lavish oversize volumes to stocking stuffers.  *

LEAD: Like a weary cowboy coming in off the range to sleep under a dry roof, Jack Aker is coming off the baseball circuit for the first time in 30 years.


INVESTING IN AN ABSENCE OF CIVILIZATION
LEAD: It is 6 o'clock in the morning in East Africa.
The sky outside your tent is not quite light, but the birds have already begun tuning up, all together, as though a conductor had waved a baton.
The sky turns a faint pearl, and though you hear no footsteps, there is the smooth discreet sound of a tent zipper.


Easing Musical Practice
LEAD: PRACTICE, practice.
Every good music student does it, but how many enjoy it?
Practicing is lonely, frustrating and sometimes painful, many say.
Yet the conscientious persevere, and this, according to the violinist and teacher Burton Kaplan, is not always a beneficial thing.


Free Advice for an Aching Back
LEAD: RECENTLY I joined the ranks of those suffering from a cruel and unremitting form of torture known as lower back pain.
The morning I was stricken was like any other, except I couldn't bend my knees far enough to get my panty hose on.

Ailey: Dancing the Dream
LEAD: ARTIST AND HUMANIST ROLLED into one, Alvin Ailey has been the great anomaly of American dance for the last 30 years.
At a time when nearly all the arts turned toward abstraction, not to speak of inaccessibility via trendy minimalist and conceptualist currents, Mr.
Ailey insisted on celebrating the human spirit.


NORTH CAROLINA PREVAILS IN REMATCH WITH MISSOURI

Choices and Value Abound In the Middle Price Range
LEAD: THE ANCIENT GREEKS extolled the golden mean - the idea of moderation and appropriate measure.
An expression of this thoughtful attitude can be found in audio equipment at the mid-price level.
Such sound gear is neither hampered by stringency in regard to cost, nor inflated by hubris of engineering ambition.


Mary Beth Donnelly to Wed
LEAD: Mary Elizabeth Donnelly and Steven Albert Westlake plan to marry Feb. 11.
Mr. and Mrs.
John P. Donnelly of Binghamton, N.Y., have announced their daughter's engagement to a son of Donald E. Westlake of New York, the novelist, and Nedra Henderson of Binghamton.

Review/Pop; A Neville Brother Goes Solo
LEAD: In New Orleans during the mid-70's, when the Neville Brothers band rose out of the ashes of the Meters, Ivan Neville, then a teen-ager, had a featured spot amid his older relatives.
His songs were always anomalies, the low points of the show; uninspired mainstream pop, they stood in sharp relief to the traditionalism of his family's music.


Giants Pin Hopes on Defense
LEAD: If the Giants are to qualify for the playoffs, they must play at their best or close to their best today against the Phoenix Cardinals in Giants Stadium.


A Passport to TV's Never-Never Land of 1962
LEAD: A GENERATION AGO, FRED ALLEN quipped that all the sincerity in Hollywood could be squeezed into the navel of a flea and there would still be room left over for two caraway seeds and the heart of an agent.
Not much has changed.
A major reason for Hollywood's disingenuousness along the way has been the enormous sums of money involved in producing and distributing television programming.


School Shuts for Disease
LEAD: A private alternative elementary school closed today to let an outbreak of whooping cough run its course after parents balked at subjecting their children to immunization or antibiotic treatment.
The teachers council voted to shut the Rudolf Steiner School until Jan. 4, said a faculty spokesman.
He said the state Department of Public Health had threatened to allow only those students and teachers taking antibiotics to attend classes, and so few agreed that it would have been impossible for the school to operate.

Egypt Mediates, and Gets No Satisfaction
LEAD: DIPLOMACY, a Western practitioner of the art said the other day, is to roll with the punches while giving the impression of fancy footwork.


Classical Bronzes Speak of More Than Art
LEAD: ''THE GODS DELIGHT'' AT THE Cleveland Museum of Art is drawing a large, rapt and silent public, every one of whom moves through the show as a free spirit. (There is no Acoustiguide).
Quite clearly, every visitor is spellbound by a vision of human beauty, human nature and the human potential that is definitive and in no need of amendment.


Sliding Devils Anger Coach
LEAD: With John MacLean and Patrik Sundstrom the only players scoring with any consistency, it's no wonder the Devils are without a victory in their last seven games.


Susan Murphy to Wed J. N. Whitman in April

The Homeless, From Africa to New Jersey
LEAD: 'They say to me, ''Where are you from?'' and usually I say Africa because many haven't heard of Ethiopia.
And then they say, ''Do you have such problems there?'' And I say, ''Oh much worse, much more acute.'' They nod and say, ''Oh yes, oh yes,'' but most of the time I think they don't quite get it.


Joseph P. Scordato and Karen A. Wendell Marry
LEAD: Karen A. Wendell, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Walter Henry Wendell Jr. of Punta Gorda, Fla., and Joseph P. Scordato, the son of Joseph C. Scordato of Valley Cottage, N.Y., and Patricia A. Nickerson of New Rochelle, N.Y., were married yesterday.

GARDENING
LEAD: Now that the chores of autumn are done and the winter is at hand, it is a time for armchair gardening and catching up on horticultural reading.
It is a time of lull, just before nursery catalogues begin to pour into our mailboxes early next year.
Among the current books on gardening, here are four with high merit, although each one will appeal to a different kind of audience.

LEAD: As Spain's economy glides along at boom levels, fueled by foreign investments and growing consumer demand, political clouds continue to build and undermine the stability touted by the Socialist Government.


HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS
LEAD: Sometime in the beginning of December - the exact hour may vary - an irrepressible urge overcomes the civilized world.
Quite suddenly, people are transformed into hosts.
Even the most urbane, cool-headed sophisticates find themselves threading strings of popcorn and cranberries, humming Christmas carols and plying people with stacks of presents and plates heaped with food.


With a Knack for Knits
LEAD: JOAN VASS has expanded her range since she introduced hand-knitted caps and scarves 11 years ago: she now shows jump suits, evening dresses and daytime suits in silk, wool and linen.
But the knits still have a special cachet.
They include midriff-baring pullovers, cardigans with a Chanel look, simple tank tops and sweaters and dresses with ruffled edges.


A Mutant Pirc Makes an Appearance
LEAD: FOR no apparent reason, an offbeat opening swept down upon the United States championship like a sudden virus, and after the tournament ended Oct. 16 in Cambridge Springs, Pa., it was anybody's guess whether it would ever be seen again.


Secret Satellite Lofted, Maybe
LEAD: Astronauts on the space shuttle Atlantis are believed to have deployed a reconnaissance radar satellite in orbit today, if the secret military mission was keeping to schedule.


The New Good-Time Blues: More Fireworks, Less Fire
LEAD: THERE'S ONE IN EVERY college town, sometimes two or three.
Larger municipalities support even more, and New York has at least a dozen.
They call themselves blues bands, and the musicians are usually white; they sport slouch or porkpie hats, sunglasses, banged-up vintage guitars and sometimes vintage zoot suits with harmonicas in the pockets.


THE NATION: An Accounting; The Environment's Gains and Losses

THE WORLD'S RICHEST MUSEUM
LEAD: I enjoyed Michael Kimmelman's article about what the J. Paul Getty Museum, in Malibu, Calif., is up to (''The World's Richest Museum,'' Oct. 23).
My observation about the reported attacks by Thomas Hoving (the editor in chief of Connoisseur magazine) on the Getty is that it's hooey.
What appears to be an attack is a well conceived campaign to reap the Getty the maximum of publicity.


Let Jean Harris Seek Parole
LEAD: ''You are a brilliant woman'' Judge Russell Leggett said to Jean Harris on March 21, 1981, ''and I ask that recognition be given to that in prison, where you could be most useful by bringing some light into those other women's lives.'' Then he sentenced Mrs.

MRS. THATCHER'S CHILDREN
LEAD: FOR MANY - BUT NOT all - of the people who live in it, Mrs.
Thatcher's Britain feels today like a rich and booming society.
In the London stores, money flows freely.
In the clubs and pubs, so does the lager and the champagne -even more so now that Britain's once strict licensing laws have been relaxed.

LEAD: Seton Hall ended seven years of frustration and a 75-year St.
John's home-court jinx last night.

John's, 74-63.


TALKING: Holidays; Decorating Within The Rules
LEAD: DECKING the halls with boughs of holly - or mistletoe, wreaths, trees, colored lights or candles - is entirely up to the owner of a house or an apartment, if the decorating is done inside.

INDIA: ALWAYS INVENTING ITSELF
LEAD: IN AMERICAN living in India is a passenger on a turbulent voyage, never certain if the country is moving forward into a more prosperous, enlightened future or disintegrating under pressures of hatred and violence.
During three-and-a-half years of covering India, I wrote often of floods, earthquakes and other calamities: a ferry capsizing, a train plunging into a river, the suffering left by a poisonous chemical leak that killed thousands.


Dr. Lorie Zimmerman To Marry in February
LEAD: Dr.

Review/Opera; Americans Hold Sway In London 'Rigoletto'
LEAD: The conquest of Europe's opera houses by American singers has been a topic of much discussion on both sides of the Atlantic in recent seasons.

PERSPECTIVES: Helping Buyers; Pension Fund Widens Housing Role
LEAD: IT took Angela Battaglia four months to sell 44 unbuilt houses in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn this fall.

A Generation of Hard Knocks Recalled
LEAD: The recent piano recital by Byron Janis, marking the 40th anniversary of his Carnegie Hall debut, brought to mind F. Scott Fitzgerald's wry observation in ''The Last Tycoon'' that there are no second acts in American lives.
A literal-minded person might argue with Fitzgerald about exactly at what age the curtain comes down on the first act of an American life, but let's not quibble.


The Teapot's the Thing This Season
LEAD: WHAT has four wheels and pours?
The answer, of course, is a teapot shaped like a chariot.
On exhibit at the Lee Sclar Gallery, 14 South Street, Morristown, this teapot is among many interpretations of a classic object that, as predictably as tinsel, are appearing this season in craft shops and galleries.


The Christmas Rose
LEAD: It's been a funny fall in New York, what with warm weather alternating with chill and sweaters alternating with down coats.
On some Greenwich Village houses, petunias are still spilling healthily from window boxes that would normally be bare by now, and more than one naked street tree is still circled by marigolds.


What is a Jew for?
LEAD: Some people here are turning to anguished and profound questions as they watch with dismay, even disgust, the cynical haggling to form a new government.
These are questions that haven't been asked for a long time.
The very existence of Israel seemed answer enough.


In Town Reynolds Built, Fear for Jobs
LEAD: In this town where the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was born in 1875, factory workers, office workers and managers had bought stock in Reynolds over decades for as little as $5 a share.

LEAD: This historic fishing port with its trawlers and luxury yachts, fish processing plants and cliffside mansions has spent the last decade in a frustrating battle against a rising tide of heroin addiction.


TAKING A BACK SEAT
LEAD: That they have been deemed universally uncomfortable doesn't seem to matter.
Indeed, hall chairs -those funny wooden seats first made for the great halls of English houses - are being voraciously collected by decorators and Anglophiles alike.
Renowned architects, the likes of William Kent, Robert Adam and Sir John Soane, made them for the buildings they designed.


It's Black, And Basically, It's Back
LEAD: OCCASIONALLY there is a stunning dress in a deep stained-glass color, or with lavish embroideries, that really catches your eye and holds it.
But the number that has set the tone at the toniest of this season's formal gatherings - whether it be a dress, a pants suit or a strapless jump suit in silk, wool crepe or velvet - is invariably black and has long and simple lines.


QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Next Week; How Do You Feel About Baseball on Cable TV?
LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.

James C. Burt performed what experts say was crude experimentation on hundreds of women without their consent.


America Is 'Fully Employed,' But Some Still Need Jobs
LEAD: NOT so long ago, 4 percent unemployment was considered more or less normal.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I am planning to install insulating board between my steam radiators and the outside walls immediately behind them.

LEAD: There were 6,300 contestants nationwide and the regional winners were all in their 30's - all but one.

BONN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT SOVIET CUTS
LEAD: Perhaps nowhere was Mikhail S. Gorbachev's pledge to cut his armies more warmly greeted than in West Germany, although the reaction was tinged with some anxiety over what impact the initiative might have on Bonn's internal and foreign politics.


It's Tit for Tat in the Albany Schoolyard

Assimilation Is Not Just Mimicry
LEAD: The essay titled ''Foreign Children: Hoping to Fit In'' (Opinion page, Nov. 6) about a World War II immigrant's experience struck a familiar chord but a very different conclusion with me.
I, too, am a first-generation American.
I breakfasted on a Swiss-import muesili when my classmates ate Frosted Flakes.


Man Freed in Officer's Slaying
LEAD: A man arrested in the shooting death of a police officer in Manhattan on Oct. 18 has been released because prosecutors had too little evidence to indict him.

SAN JUAN
LEAD: In Puerto Rico, McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King compete with lechoneras - fast-food restaurants specializing in highly seasoned roast pork and other local delicacies.
In the discos, the disk jockeys play about as much rock as they do salsa and merengue. (The trick to dancing to Latin rhythms is to sway the hips without moving the shoulders.) The language is Spanish, but so many Puerto Ricans are bilingual that visitors hoping to try their Spanish are often frustrated by Puerto Ricans more eager to practice their


What Stands Out In the N.F.L. This Year?
LEAD: Poor officiating at a constant rate.
Each week, there are numerous instances in which questionable calls are made.
There should be an upgrade in officiating in some respect.
There are referees who are not fit to have the responsibility of making decisions where games are hanging in the balance.
Referees are necessary, but I seriously question their present quality.


Fuse Boxes And Circuit Breakers
LEAD: IN all buildings supplied with electricity, circuit breakers or fuses are incorporated into the wiring, usually inside a wall-hung metal box called a distribution panel.

The Sweet Season
LEAD: The happiest, and tastiest, holiday art show in town is at the American Craft Museum. ''The Confectioner's Art'' includes a portrait of Miss Liberty done, pointillist style, in jelly beans and another of The Lone Ranger done in sprinkles.
There is a 12th-century Spanish tapestry made of chocolate and a modern assemblage contrived of licorice sticks.


Pacemaker Engineer Gets One
LEAD: Norman Roth, who helped develop one of the first heart pacemakers 30 years ago when he was a young engineer, has had one of the devices installed in his own chest, doctors said Friday.

DEER AT FACTORY PROVE TOO FERTILE

Set Guidelines for Export Market Share
LEAD: Optical fiber for data and telecommunications transmission, a ''target industry'' in Japan, became the focus of trade negotiations in the early 1980's.

Costly Components Offer Some Subtle Musical Joys
LEAD: It's not just the rich who buy fancy sound gear.
Surveys show that most blue-chip components are owned by listeners in income brackets that raise suspicion that they skipped lunch for years in order to buy the stuff.
They are a special breed of customer.
Their passion for music is simply too strong to let them balk at the price.


Bhutto Visits Father's Grave

They say the requirements have taxed an already overburdened court system to the breaking point.


Headliners; Stocking Up
LEAD: As some on Wall Street tell it, all that stands between Carl C. Icahn and his next $1 billion is James W. Kinnear.
But now it appears that Mr.
Icahn has begun moving Mr.
Kinnear out of the way.
Mr.
Icahn, a well-known corporate raider who is chairman of Trans World Airlines, owns 14.8 percent of Texaco Inc., which could be worth about $1 billion more than it cost if Texaco were put on the auction block.


When 'Ye Olde Inn' Looks Can Deceive

Its English Tudor architecture is a reflection of this affluent North Shore community.
Stucco and half-timbered walls, a large stone fireplace and twinkling carriage lights spell ''ye olde inn.''


An Invitation the West Can't Ignore
LEAD: What a startling scene: New York police clear Broadway for a visiting Soviet leader's hurtling motorcade while a giant sign flashes a hammer and sickle in lights and welcoming citizens chant, ''Gorby!

The P.L.O.: Only the Music's Better

The Pet Shop Boys Make a Science Of Ambiguity
LEAD: Since punk rock evaporated, English music has been like a position paper waiting for a sound to fulfill it.
This year that sound was ''acid house,'' a zealous, liberal adaptation of a mesmerizing music and subculture that arose from a handful of discos in Chicago.
London disk jockeys adapted the music for their own purposes, enhancing the hypnotically monotonous beats with cerebral sound effects while fog machines and psychedelic lighting effects simulated a hallucinogenic experience.


Philadelphia School Has Sponsors With Badges
LEAD: ''Agua!
Agua!'' children shout in the largely Hispanic West Kensington section of the city.
They are not asking for water.
The word is a code to warn drug dealers and buyers that the police, who drive marine-blue and white cars, are coming.


THE NATION: The View From America's Stranded Public Schools; Out of Patience: Detroiters Say No to More Taxes
LEAD: THE people of Detroit have been willing to spend money on their public schools in the past, approving 9 out of 10 property tax increases in the last decade.
But they have lately changed their minds.
In November, for example, voters agreed to renew an existing school tax but rejected a proposal to increase the tax and a proposal for a bond issue to pay off the schools' accumulated debt of nearly $70 million.


A Lesson in Unselfish Giving

Now, to Figure Why the Poor Get Poorer
LEAD: NEXT month, George Bush will presumably begin working toward his vision of a ''kinder, gentler'' America.
But last week, the plight of the homeless was underscored as bitter cold swept the Northeast and the annual winter count of the frozen-to-death began, raising the question of whether this is instead becoming a meaner nation, whose social ills are inextricably tied to its deepening economic divisions.


Many Have Watched Climbing Monkeys
LEAD: To the Editor:


'Legs': Long March to Opening Night

That opportunity - that challenge to leadership - is one result of last week's startling events.


The View From America's Stranded Public Schools
LEAD: IN report after report in recent years, commission after commission has warned about the deterioration of American public education.

Oblivion Bestrides The Career Path Of Jazz Artists
LEAD: A few months ago the trumpeter Jimmy Owens came up to me after a concert and asked if I had heard about ''jazz in the Middle Ages.'' It sounded like a set-up for a joke.

TALKING: Water Use; Saving With Meters
LEAD: SOME months ago, New York City began the monumental task of installing a water meter in every single-family home and apartment building in the five boroughs - a total of about 630,000 meters, according to recent estimates from the city's Bureau of Water Register.
The aim is to encourage conservation by more accurately billing for usage rather than using the old flat-rate system under which the amount charged was based on the size of the structure and its frontage on the public streets, rather than the habits of the residents.


A Tradition of Generosity: Remember the Neediest Cases Fund; Meeting Social Needs Of Staten Islanders
LEAD: For 69 years, since World War I, Staten Island Family Service Inc. has provided continuous service to the social needs of Staten Islanders.

Budgeting For Europe's Ski Trial; In and About France's Peaks
LEAD: IF anyone in the French ski resorts is putting a brake on prices to help American visitors parting with a weaker dollar, the evidence is hard to find.
Prices have been rising steadily at a rate of 5 or 6 percent a year and increases look about the same this season, even though France's general inflation rate has been only about 3 percent in 1988.

THE WORLD: Adjusting to Moscow's Disarmament Plans; For NATO, Gorbachev's Overture Has Drawbacks
LEAD: THE North Atlantic Treaty Organization, founded 40 years ago to protect Western democracies from the Soviet military threat, could be on the verge of a serious mid-life crisis.
Oddly, the root of the trouble is what should be regarded as good news: Mikhail S. Gorbachev's announcement of a Soviet troop withdrawal of 50,000 soldiers and 5,000 tanks from Eastern


Reviews/Dance; An Italian Troupe of Proselytizers
LEAD: Teatrodanza Contemporanea di Roma has been a pioneering modern-dance troupe in Italy, a country not known for its abiding interest in that art form.
But the company performing its New York debut on Dec. 10 at the 14th Street Dance Center of the Emanu-El Midtown Y did not have the haggard and truculent look one might expect of proselytizers at the barricades.


With Lasting Doubts, India Fosters Hopes of Better Ties to China
LEAD: MORE than half a century ago and two decades before he became India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru had a dream.
Friendship between China and India, he told a conference of anti-colonial parties in 1927, would form the core of a new pan-Asianism, a base on which to build a new order in the


Review/Music; A Saxophonist's Ascetic Sounds
LEAD: The six pieces played by the saxophonist and composer Jon Gibson at Experimental Intermedia on Tuesday night shared a gentleness that seemed, at first, self-explanatory.
But as the concert progressed, it became clear that behind the small, flowerlike figures he quietly drew out of his wind instruments lay a rhythmic tension that made even his longer pieces take on the strength of detail.

Reviews/Music; Trio's Pianist Goes Solo
LEAD: Daniel Epstein, most often heard in New York as the pianist of the Raphael Trio, reminded keyboard watchers at Weill Recital Hall Friday night that he is also a satisfying interpreter of the solo literature.
Like many good chamber players, he seems to lack the intensity of assertion that marks a musician for a virtuoso's career, but this does not at all mean that he plays without personal expression.


Pretoria's White Tribe Is Split on Its Sacred Day

Budgeting For Europe's Ski Trails; Austria, Switzerland and Italy
LEAD: THE decline of the dollar has had a sobering effect on the European ski resorts fearful of losing their cherished American clientele.

The increases used to reach 10 percent and more, at least for hotels.

Joseph Swensen and Jeffrey Kahane, for example, played an evening of Schubert for violin and piano that achieved high levels of communication through modest means.


Soviets and Chinese Seek Uncapitalist Stock Markets
LEAD: STOCK markets in Communist countries?

Vietnamese Fare in Old Saybrook
LEAD: VIETNAMESE restaurants have not burst upon the Connecticut dining scene with such force as Thai restaurants have in the past year.

'Healthy' Institutions Are Hurting, Too
LEAD: The basic facts about Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation-insured savings and loan associations are clear.
Rounded off, the numbers at the end of 1988 will be as follows: 3,100 associations with $1.3 trillion in assets, of which 500 associations with $125 billion in assets are insolvent; another 500 associations with $175 billion in assets would also be insolvent if intangible assets - ''good will'' and the F.S.L.I.C's assurances - are not counted.

LEAD: Someone asked Rick Pitino what he thought of the Knicks' 117-102 victory over the Washington Bullets last night at Madison Square Garden.


Staining Furniture

PINS: PARENTS FEEL OVERWHELMED
LEAD: As I understand it, a child 16 or older cannot be forced to live at home or attend counseling or therapy regardless of where or how the child is living.

POSTINGS: Jamaica Revival; New Offices
LEAD: When civic leaders of Jamaica, Queens, speak of a revival of their venerable business district, they point to the Social Security Administration building, which will be ready for its 2,700 office workers next month, and the three newly opened Archer Avenue subway stations.
But the Federal Government paid for one and a public authority spent the money for the other.


Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''I thought at one time they were trying to use the rescue teams to say that no one was left alive and they could go in to begin demolishing and clearing.

Here lies collusion, R.I.P.

Goodbye and good riddance.


Venice
LEAD: To the Editor: A warning to travelers flying into Venice: beware the airport water taxi scam.

Islanders End the Embarrassment
LEAD: The two teams came to the game dressed in each other's morale tonight.


Turkey
LEAD: To the Editor: In ''Journey East From Ankara'' (Travel, Nov. 6), James Blachowicz has done a disservice to the almost two million Armenians who died at the turn of the century in Turkey's genocide against the Armenians.

A Swedish Everyman Trapped in a False Eden
LEAD: Max Von Sydow knew he wanted to be in ''Pelle the Conqueror'' by the time he had read just 25 pages of the screenplay.
The script was a page-turner, he recalled, but more important was the character he was being asked to play, that of an ordinary individual who, in the course of the story, displays the full range of human emotion - the kind of role, he says, that comes his way too rarely in

A Tradition of Generosity: Remember the Neediest Cases Fund; Children's Aid Society Stretches Its Capacity
LEAD: More.
That has been the watchword for the Children's Aid Society throughout 1988.
We have stretched our capacity to the limit, yet there are still more children who need to be helped, provided for and even rescued.
More families who need our services and who turn to us when things go bad: a child who runs away, an infant who gets sick, a family that is burned out of its home.


Cynthia Parzych Is Wed
LEAD: Cynthia Mary Elizabeth Parzych, a daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs.
Stanley Parzych of New Britain, Conn., and John Anthony Aldren Turner, a son of Dr. and Mrs.

New York:  Alfred A. Knopf. $18.95.


Editorial Advice
LEAD: The last time Denny McLain came up for sentencing before Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich she gave him 23 years.
So the two-time Cy Young Award winner was in an understandably accommodating mood last week after he returned to Federal District Court in Tampa, Fla., for resentencing on the same racketeering and cocaine trafficking charges.


DOUBTS ABOUT THE WARREN COMMISSION
LEAD: David Belin contends that Americans won't accept the findings of the Warren Commission because they don't have all the facts.
The truth is, we don't want to believe that President John F. Kennedy was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald alone.


Jennings Has Inside View
LEAD: Dave Jennings, who has punted for both the Giants and the Jets, has a favorite for their game today. ''I'm rooting for the Celtics,'' he said.
Jennings is finishing his first season as the Jets' color radio broadcaster.
For most of the 1970's and 1980's, he was part of the New York scene as a punter: from 1974 to 1984 with the Giants, and from 1985 through 1987 for the

Except for the lone Orin O'Brien, sawing away on her double bass to support the Mozart Wind Serenade No.


Justice Delayed, Slightly
LEAD: Amid all the glare of publicity on the murder trial of Joel B. Steinberg, the Greenwich Village lawyer accused of beating 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg to death, the presiding judge, Harold J. Rothwax, an acting State Supreme Court Justice, has insisted on keeping courtroom nonsense and delays to a minimum.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I have improved the outside of my house by installing clear cedar shingles.

Blood, Alienation and Chauvinism Accompany Sri Lankans to Polls
LEAD: Dharshanie is only 22.
Her brother is a soldier.

Who's O.K.
LEAD: To the Editor:


Lasansky's Printmaking Virtuosity on Display in Purchase
LEAD: FOR a printmaker of Mauricio Lasansky's stature and age, 15 images make a niggardly retrospective.
But the show, which remains at the State University's Neuberger Museum in Purchase for the winter season, is a kind of trial run - not for the 74-year-old artist but for its curator, Roxanne Sexauer, who is an master's degree candidate in the university's department of visual arts.


Voluntary Tax Revenues Surpass Expectations
LEAD: TAX Commissioner Timothy F. Bannon said last week that extensive publicity about a crackdown on tax delinquents has helped produce millions of dollars more than predicted.

THE NATION: The Federal Safety Net; Bank Failures Set Records; The Insured Public Is Calm
LEAD: WHEN L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, held a press conference last week on the banking industry's record profits for the third quarter, another bit of information was disclosed almost as an aside: that 1988 would see another record -for bank failures.


A Slight Increase in Confidence
LEAD: At least judging by one measure, individual investors' confidence in the stock market appears to be staging something of a comeback.


Warsaw Pact Ministers Meet
LEAD: Warsaw Pact defense ministers gathered in Sofia today for their first joint meeting since Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, announced sweeping cuts in troops and equipment in Eastern Europe.

Reviews/Dance; A Choreography of Mayhem By the Bill Cratty Company
LEAD: Bill Cratty must delight in making dances.
The two new works his Bill Cratty Dance Theater presented Thursday night at St.
Mark's Church were filled with unusual steps.
The quirkier they looked, the better he appeared to like them.
But if they revealed Mr.
Cratty to be endlessly inventive, they also suggested that he may find it difficult to edit his creations.


OHIO GETS DEADLINE ON POLLUTION PLAN
LEAD: The Environmental Protection Agency has given Ohio officials two months to adopt a plan to inspect automobiles for pollution emissions in the Cleveland area or face a cutoff of $20 million in Federal highway funds.

Holiday Party Brings Cheer to Brooklyn


GALLERY VIEW
LEAD: In the late 1980's the art world is dominated more than ever by the almighty buck.
Auction prices are more and more out of sight.
Competition among dealers for artists and collectors has never been more bitter.
For the privilege of being on the board of a prestigious museum like the Whitney, a trustee is expected to contribute at least $100,000 a year, and museum boards have never been more corporate in their membership and tone.


Above All, Let's Be Complete
LEAD: It was in 1988, most musical historians agree, that the completeness mania began to get out of control.
From our aerie here in the 21st century we can easily trace the problem's origins and see how it developed into a worldwide malady that, in spite of all efforts to wipe it out, lingers on in our post-space-war world.

LEAD: I love it. The only thing better than a game a night would be two games a night.


Out of the Cabinet
LEAD: In Switzerland, where women were not granted the right to vote in national elections until 1971, Elisabeth Kopp has been a pioneer.
She was the first woman to enter the seven-person Swiss Executive, known as the Federal Cabinet, in 1984.
A recent poll named her the most popular Cabinet member, and under the country's rotating executive system, she was to become Vice President in February and President in 1990.


A Lurid, Mysterious Scandal Begins Taking Shape in Omaha

The N.C.A.A. Gets a Boost in Court
LEAD: Last Monday, the Supreme Court enhanced the legal position of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in a ruling involving Jerry Tarkanian, the University of Nevada-Las Vegas basketball coach.

Another Puzzling Matter

LEAD: UNLIKE most men nearing their 60th birthdays, Sherman Armstrong is not looking forward to retirement.
He's already done that - twice.


SAFETY BARRIERS
LEAD: Once, the fear of wrinkles was enough to send women racing for a jar of cream.
Now, the threats to skin are, well, more threatening.
The diminishing ozone layer, the multitude of pollutants, the swarm of free radicals - all are being flagged by cosmetics companies as hazards to skin.
It figures that a new category of products would emerge to protect skin from the environment.


Staining Furniture
LEAD: FURNITURE stain is a finishing material used to color and enhance the grain pattern of wood.
Because it is absorbed into wood and does not protect it, a surface-coating finish of shellac, lacquer, varnish or wax also must be applied.


Reviews/Music; A Montage of Monteverdi: Psalms, Motets and Magnificat
LEAD: There is great argument among scholars about whether Monteverdi's collection of Mass, vesper and motet settings - published in 1610 and marveled at since by music lovers - represents a designed religious observance or simply a disjointed resume for a composer seeking employment.


Wall St. on the Danube
LEAD: One of the best-selling board games in Hungary these days is Capitaly, a version of Monopoly, the object of which is, of course, to amass the most property and capital at the expense of other players.
Now, Hungary, long something of a hothouse for free-market experiments in the Communist world, is about to play


Reviews/Theater; Don Juan In His Own Language
LEAD: Was there ever a ladies' man like Don Juan?
In these enlightened times, one rather hopes not after seeing his villainies enacted in his mother tongue at Repertorio Espanol.
This versatile company is now staging ''Don Juan Tenorio,'' Jose Zorrilla's 1844 drama.
There is something special in the interpretation of Don Juan in this Spanish presentation.


Bias Seen in AIDS Studies

'A Christmas Carol' True to Form

Question Of the Week; How Do You Feel About Baseball on Cable TV?

Living in Brooklyn and not having cable, it's understandable that I'd be upset.


THE NATION: The View From America's Stranded Public Schools; Gangs and Drugs: Denver Feels the Pull of Poverty
LEAD: A NEW subject has been added to the training of Denver public-school teachers: the study of gang behavior.
A few years ago, teachers here said, the notion would have seemed preposterous.
But the rise in gangs and the problems they cause illustrates the changed nature of the classroom in Denver.


THE WORLD: The Semantics of Diplomacy; Getting Arafat to Say the Magic Words
LEAD: YASIR ARAFAT and the Palestine Liberation Organization traveled a long road before finding the precise words that would satisfy the United States's criteria for opening a dialogue.
The words changed only a little along this road.
But taken together they produced a statement last week that Secretary of State George P.


Working for Honor
LEAD: ''I won't claim that I liked school,'' Isaac Shongwe said last weekend, ''but I hated the position I was in.'' Not so now.
The 26-year-old black South African has become a member of an elite within an elite, one of the few of his race from his country to hold one of the Rhodes Scholarships, created in 1903 by the British colonial administrator of that name to prepare Anglo-Saxon men to lead the Western world.


Janine Imbriaco Is Wed
LEAD: At St.
Genevieve's Roman Catholic Church in Elizabeth, N.J., Janine A. Imbriaco, a daughter of Louis Imbriaco of Union, N.J., and the late Gloria Imbriaco, was married yesterday to Richard W. Lloyd, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

They May Be Also-Rans, but Jets Are Excited

For in both end zones a huge rectangle with the word ''JETS'' will be zippered into the Astroturf.


Carson Is In, McMillan Is Out

Especially in the past two years, the states have become activists in a broad variety of areas, like antitrust, consumer protection and the environment.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD: VERSATILE SINGERS When it comes to versatility, the New York Vocal Arts Ensemble is right up there in the ''soup to nuts'' department.

Coping When the Best Defense Is Long Johns
LEAD: When Bart Starr snatched the snap and lunged into the end zone with 13 seconds left, he clinched that classic Green Bay Packers 21-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys that is regarded as one of the greatest games in National Football League history.


Florence
LEAD: To the Editor: I enjoyed the humorous article by Louis Inturrisi (''Going to Pieces Over Masterpieces,'' Travel, Nov. 6).
I have just visited Florence and its numerous museums and churches, and although I did not myself experience Stendhal's Syndrome, I can understand how some people would.
I am referring to those who run in and out of museums without taking the time to really look, absorb and, why not?


GLICKMAN IS BACK WHERE HE BELONGS
LEAD: Old joke: Who's the only person to play for both the Dodgers and the Knicks in New York?
Answer: Gladys Goodding.


Mazda Has All the Trimmings About Cars
LEAD: When I was a kid, we optioned our cars the way we wanted them.
That meant going to the Pep Boys - Manny, Moe and Jack - or to Western Auto or to some such store for parts.


POSTINGS: Good Neighbor Policy; Clinton Park
LEAD: For as long as Hell's Kitchen Park on 10th Avenue has provided a bit of open space for residents of what once was Hell's Kitchen and now is Clinton, the vacant lot next to the park at 448 West 48th Street looked tantalizingly available for more recreational elbow-room.
But the city never bought the privately owned parcel.


Further Signs Of a Surge
LEAD: Numbers poured in from Washington, many indicating a resurgence in the economy's growth and heightening the possibility that the Federal Reserve would further tighten credit by raising the discount rate.
Already, the Fed funds rate - the rate at which banks lend to one another - has inched up.

Nets Hold Off Rally To Defeat Pacers
LEAD: The Nets have struggled this season, but things could be worse.
Just ask the Indiana Pacers.

LEAD: For a half-century, America's system of housing finance relied heavily on a highly regulated, specialized network of savings and loan institutions to finance owning a home.
But the protective environment of rigid regulation was legislated away in the early 1980's.
What is to become of our nation's home financing system?


IMAGES OF IMPROVISATION
LEAD: The Japanese photographer and fan K. Abe has compiled probably the best and most satisfying book of jazz photographs ever published.
Aside from the briefest of introductions by Nat Hentoff and Mr.
Abe, there is no text in JAZZ GIANTS: A Visual Retrospective (Billboard, $60).
Each photo is accompanied only by a small identifying caption.


A Busy Time Of Year
LEAD: BE sure to use certified outdoor wiring when decorating trees and shrubs.
Prune overgrown holly, yew, juniper, spruce and pine and use these trimmings for holiday decorations.
Water pots of hardy bulbs stored in the basement or cool room to be sure they form strong roots so they can be forced into bloom during the winter months.


Correction
LEAD: Because of computer entry errors, a letter on page 3 in some copies of the Arts and Leisure section today, about the Lincoln Center Theater, gives an incorrect date for a telecast and misstates the organization's budgetary needs.
The date, for ''Voices of Sarafina!,'' is Dec. 28.
The amount required for next year's season is $5 million to $5.5 million.


Smart Team
LEAD: When it comes to selecting academic all-America football teams, the emphasis is distinctly on academics.
But this year's team, selected by college sports information directors for the GTE Company, has one bona fide football star.
He is Mark Stepnoski, the University of Pittsburgh offensive lineman who was one of the three finalists for the Outland


Correction
LEAD: An article about abortion in The Week in Review on Nov. 27 misstated the number of state referendums since 1973 that have concerned abortion.

Eating to Hunt
LEAD: My father used to be an unabashed hunter who lived for deer season.
Every fall, he and my two brothers would raid the kitchen before their overnight forays and pack enough food for a Marine division.

STREETSCAPES: Park Avenue; A Grand Residential Boulevard or Just Monotony Lane?

Barry Champlain, Sculptured by Stone
LEAD: The making of every film breeds a few good stories.
Some are told at parties, some to your wife after the lights are out and some never told at all.
The making of ''Talk Radio,'' the film opening Wednesday at the Beekman, was for me a shuttle-rocket ride from the littered pavements of downtown New York City to the fast and shiny highways of the New Hollywood.


Submarine Is Commissioned

DOUBTS ABOUT THE WARREN COMMISSION
LEAD: I do not subscribe to any particular conspiracy theory, nor are my doubts fueled by ''speculations'' of ''sensationalists.'' I do not doubt Oswald's participation, only his independence.
Some of the theories that have been advanced are clearly nonsense.
On others, I reserve opinion.
The so-called Mafia theory is intriguing, but hardly proven.

POSTINGS: School Conversion; Lesson in Change
LEAD: How to convert a high school into a lower school?

Plugging in Numbers, With Ease
LEAD: Despite the supposed arrival of the electronic information age, executives are still bombarded with reams of paper containing useful information: newspapers, magazines, annual reports, filings, memos and all the output from desktop-publishing systems.
On the executive's desk is perhaps the most powerful analytical tool yet invented, the personal computer, but he or she is more than likely to analyze the material with mushware (the brain).


It's All in the Name (Some of the Time)
LEAD: IT takes guts to name a restaurant Murphy's Law.

A Hit as President-Elect

LEAD: ACCORDING to the folklore that has sprung up around the game, combinational tacticians are ill at ease facing positional players.
But does anyone really know whether this is true?


What South Africa Gets for the Continent's Last Colony
LEAD: SOUTH Africa's decision to give up control of Namibia, the last colony in Africa, is in many ways the result of the kind of compromise often proposed for the Middle East - a barter of land for peace and international acceptance.


A PAIN IN THE NECK
LEAD: Your article mentions that manipulation of the neck has been associated with transient neurological symptoms and even stroke.
This is an extremely delicate area, in which a complex network of blood vessels and nerves pass through foramina, spaces between two bony areas in the neck.
These foramina often are narrowed in the elderly.


The Characters Dont' Know From Adam
LEAD: Larry Gelbart's view of this moment in American history is not bright. ''I don't think I know just how precarious our position is,'' he said, mentioning environment perils, the danger of atomic war and what he feels is a dearth of decent leadership.

Reviews/Music; Earth and Nature Help To Shape Foss Concert
LEAD: The Meet the Moderns concert presented by Lukas Foss and members of the Brooklyn Philharmonic on Wednesday evening at Cooper Union was called ''Music From the Planet Earth'' - not the most limiting or descriptive of titles.
But as it turned out, the title had a double meaning.
On one hand, it suggested the international flavor of the program, which included music by American, British, Greek, Italian and Japanese composers.


ABOUT BOOKS
LEAD: Books have long been considered a staple of holiday gift-giving.

A PAIN IN THE NECK
LEAD: With only one serious neurological injury in tens of millions of manipulations, it would seem that chiropractors have the safest treatment for neck and back problems.

Billie Gayle Wenzel Weds M. C. Bailkin
LEAD: Billie Gayle Wenzel, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Subduing the Lion Killers
LEAD: AS DUSK APPROACH-ed, thick gray clouds hung over Nairobi, Kenya, like a heavy canopy, and the air had a damp mid-winter chill.

Reviews/Music; Improvisations For the Guitar
LEAD: Though the three improvised pieces played by the guitarist Derek Bailey weren't literally the same -same notes, same order - they were similar enough in their devices and textures to make the first set at the Knitting Factory on Wednesday night drag on longer than it should have.
And in their spirited similarity, the three pieces pointed out a weakness in Mr.

A Dragonish Display in New Haven
LEAD: Bug-eyed dragons emblazoned on the Chinese ceramics exhibited at the Yale University Art Gallery are bound to spark more fantasy than fear in viewers.
For the winged, horned reptiles whipping energetically around beach-ball-sized jars, breathing fire as they stretch clawed paws on basins and raging, fangs bared, on the center of great platters, are propitious symbols - not docile, but seemingly well disposed to all.

Theater Reviews: A Different Opinion
LEAD: I strongly feel that you are doing the New Jersey area a disservice by using Alvin Klein as a theater critic.

Searching for The Shades Of Stalag 17B
LEAD: I WAS afraid to go back.
I wanted to go, but would I travel 4,600 miles and find no trace of Stalag 17B, the P.O.W. camp west of Vienna where I had spent a year of my life?
No trace of the cottage north of the Danube where, in the last weeks of World War II, with the S.S. fanned out - shooting first, asking questions later - Victor and Josefine Gutmann risked their lives to give me food and an escape route to Switzerland?

LEAD: Barry Switzer says he had no knowledge of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules violations in his football program at the University of Oklahoma, and there is no reason, certainly, to dispute the head coach.

Review/Film; Eden for 3, In 'Genesis'
LEAD: Rest easy.
Despite the title, ''Genesis'' is not a biblical extravaganza.
The Indian director Mrinal Sen's 1986 movie, now at the Public Theater, is a simply conceived, artfully rendered parable of love and jealousy, freedom and slavery.
The tale is rudimentary, its themes a touch obvious, yet the telling, done with grave humanity, carries meanings of its own.

CONSUMER'S WORLD: Coping; With Christmas Letdown
LEAD: The prospect of a three-day Christmas weekend is enough to make even champion copers quiver.

Hope Is More Than Happiness
LEAD: NOT long ago a child asked me, ''Why are your endings all so sad?'' The question threw me a bit.

A Walk Through the Snow and the Years
LEAD: THE snow came like sleep, slow, steady and sounds muffled as if held under a blanket.

I walk looking for Milltown, looking for myself.


ABROAD, AND BARELY BILINGUAL
LEAD: One baking August afternoon on Rome's Via del Corso, I stopped at the elegant Europa for an ice cream.
In front of me in the gelato line stood a middle-aged woman, her hands on the hips of her slacks as she read the list of flavors.

Good Things From Small Labels
LEAD: Assembling best-records lists every year, one notices recurrent patterns.
We are still in a period of massive reissues by the major classical companies of their long-playing-record catalogues onto compact disks.
Thus any selection of the best new recordings of the year might seem tilted artificially toward smaller companies.

The Ultimate Elitist Event
LEAD: To the Editor:


Israelis Pull Together and Rightward

Getting to Heart of Christmas
LEAD: CHRISTMAS should be more than a momentary carol-induced intoxication, or, although it's a start, a nebulous yearning for peace on Earth brought on by falling snow at twilight, or the shining face of a child.


Animal Rights Group Is Quiet in the Woods
LEAD: Sometimes it is more difficult to get our points across to reporters than to hunters.
Our anti-hunting actions in Connecticut's woodlands have never included ''making noise'' as we go (''Advocates of Animal Rights See Influence Grow in State,'' Nov. 27).
To do so could, theoretically, frighten deer into the path of an unseen hunter, which, not surprisingly, is the last thing we want to do.


OFFICES THAT FLY AND MORE TELEPHONES IN THE SKY

The Meaning of Christmas

No letter was sent off to the North Pole; cookies and milk were not left out for Santa.

A Soup of Styles: The Specter of Pluralism Returns

After New Year's Eve, for the Stomach

Canada Backs Trade Pact
The House of Commons gave final approval to the Canada-United States free-trade agreement that is to go into effect Jan.


Trendlets, Revivals and a League of Women
LEAD: In popular music, 1988 was a year without a consensus or a rallying point.
It is likely to be one of the most lucrative years ever for the recording business, fueled in part by the growing popularity (and high price) of compact disks.
Yet despite a few attempts, there was no pre-eminent performer who reached beyond the pop audience the way U2 did in 1987 or Michael Jackson in 1984.

Have Art, Will Travel
LEAD: Given the record prices being paid for fine art these days, Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza might never be able to sell his huge collection as a unit.

NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  No More Goodbyes  It's one of the ironies of contemporary life, according to the hero of this Shirley Hazzard novel, that lovers rarely part anymore: their tragedy is that they stay together in one way or another.

LEAD: In David Aaron's new spy novel ''Agent of Influence'' (Putnam, $18.95), a group of Wall Street M.&amp;A. men are about to lose a leveraged buyout deal to a competitor with better inside information and deeper pockets.

We live off of his crumbs, but those are still more than you ever dreamed you'd have.''
a senior Drexel official,
speaking of Michael Milken.


At Notre Dame, Losses Bred Leaders
LEAD: Mark Green decided to go east to college.
He could have gone most anywhere, and he chose Notre Dame.
But when Green came home to Riverside, Calif., for the holidays four years ago, he felt much more than one year removed from being a consensus high school all-American.
He had experienced a season of unexpected mediocrity.


ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD: Q. Our home-built kitchen cabinets are covered with Formica and this is separating from the particle board underneath.
I would like to refurbish these cabinets.
I can either reglue the existing laminate, then apply another on top of that, or remove the Formica, then apply a new laminate directly to the particle board.


CULTURED CLUTTER IN A PARIS MUSEUM
LEAD: When the Academy of Fine Arts flourished in France and painters treasured their links with the past, they often signaled their success by starting collections of their own.
If they also married a rich woman, then they could buy enough to fill a small museum.
That, in fact, is the story of Ernest Hebert, an artist of limited talent whose portraits were in great demand between 1840 and 1900.


Mayor Barry Denies Interfering in an Inquiry
LEAD: Mayor Marion S. Barry says it is purely coincidental that he visited a man at a hotel room while the police were checking allegations that the man had offered drugs to maids in exchange for sex.

THE WORLD: Lessons of the Quake; Through Shock After Shock, Gorbachev Keeps His Feet
LEAD: IT is not hard to imagine Mikhail S. Gorbachev, an inveterate stock-taker, sitting down to calculate the effects of the past two weeks on his own standing as a leader, and concluding that on balance he had made the best of a dreadful situation.


In the End, Plenty to Laugh About
LEAD: While 1988 was pushing its way from January to December, it never seemed an especially funny year.
It was a grind.
There wasn't time to analyze what was happening since there were too many movies to be looked at: 419 this year compared to 388 in 1987.
This sets a new record for the Reagan decade, one that will probably stick, since, according to trade observers, the production boom prompted by the home video market has peaked.


An Era Ends: Gov. O'Neill Is Selling Family Tavern
LEAD: THE East Hampton tavern that has been in Governor O'Neill's family for 52 years is closed today for Christmas and will reopen tomorrow to serve a few rounds on the house to regular customers.

LEAD: The Houston Oilers survived the great outdoors, the road and three final onside kicks today to topple the Browns, 24-23, in the American Conference wild-card playoff game.


A Year for Once-in-a-Lifetime Exhibitions
LEAD: There is no doubt that in terms of the major museum exhibition -the show thought up, thought through, lodged deep in current scholarship and installed in a way that is a credit to the museum profession - 1988 will go down in history as an annus mirabilis.
For years, we have heard from our constant companion, Gloomy Gus, that exhibitions of that kind were obsolete, frivolous, injurious to works of art, prohibitively expensive and destructive of the privacy, tranquillity and potential sublimity of the museum experience.


Drawings in Stamford, Herzl Emanuel in Westport
LEAD: DRAWING used to be a means to an end and, for many artists, it still is.
The product itself, however, has come up in the world.
Connoisseurs of art take drawings as they come, valuing them for revealing aspects of an artist that can be obscured by painting or sculpture.

At Last, the Ontological Divorce Novel
LEAD: IF you read contemporary fiction you will notice that we thrash out the ultimate terms of our divorces not in court or on the couches of therapy, but in novels.

Closing the Tank Gap: NATO Looks to Robots
LEAD: It is an old Army axiom that the best way to fight a tank is with another tank.
But despite Mikhail Gorbachev's recent promise that the Soviet Union will unilaterally reduce its arsenal of tanks by 10,000, analysts at the Pentagon say the United States cannot hope to overcome the Soviet bloc's numerical advantage in tanks, and they doubt the Soviets would ever agree to such a thing in negotiations with the West.

Goodbye, L.I.; It's Been Fun, but the Party's Over
LEAD: THANK you, Long Island.
We're leaving now and we were taught that you always say ''thank you'' when you leave a party.
And it was a very nice party, thank you very much.
But we have to leave before the ice cream cake goes all gooey and the balloons get small and withered.
And we have another party to go to.


Christmas In the Making
LEAD: AROUND HALLOWEEN, about the time the leaves burned at the curbside, my father set the clock ticking toward Christmas.

Christmas Future
LEAD: On the African Savanna, it is a strikingly foreign image.

From a 'Singing Detective' to Violence Verite
LEAD: Flip-flopping its way more pervasively than ever into our everyday lives, television in 1988 was, depending on where it grabbed you, appalling and astonishing.

There are today almost 700 wineries where, 50 years ago, there were a couple of dozen.
Who can say who will be the best 50 years from now?

LEAD: AN $847 million plan developed by the Army Corps of Engineers to eliminate flooding in the Passaic River Basin has given rise to a dispute that threatens to doom the project before it has even begun.


Switzerland
LEAD: To the Editor: The article by Barbara Cansino on ''Swiss Embroidery and Lace'' (Shopper's World, Nov. 20) was interesting but erroneously referred to ''16th-century St.
Gallen in the canton of Appenzell.'' My 1982 Michelin guide to Switzerland states that ''The country of Appenzell and the great Alpine combe of the Toggenburg (Upper Thur Valley) are separated by an administrative borderline, for Appenzell has been a separate canton since 1513, while the Toggenburg is still under the control of St.


After New Year's Eve, for the Stomach
LEAD: WHEN midnight has struck and you've rung in the new year it is nice to sit down to a festive snack with your champagne - something to line the stomach before you go to bed.

Travel Data Center.


Now This Late Word on the Early Music Debate
LEAD: The debate about the authentic performance of early music is shifting into a new gear.
Previously the battle lines were drawn between those who espoused old instruments with their bright, plangent sounds, and those who preferred the greater sophistication of modern instruments; between those who believed in using the evidence of the past to arrive at original performance styles and those who believed in the continuity of modern performance techniques.


College Action


Gasoline
LEAD: To the Editor: A comment about the letter on unleaded regular gasoline (bleifrei), which appeared on Nov. 13: My wife and I picked up a car in Munich last summer and were advised that either unleaded or regular gasoline could be used but that the bleifrei was recommended; the catalytic converter would be installed when our car was turned in for shipment to the United

Each Shout Does Count

Whatever Became of Cereal?
LEAD: THE other day, I was at the grocery store in the cereal aisle and it took me about 10 minutes to spot the cornflakes.
They were not mis-stocked or pushed way in the back behind something else.

You know, the area where the basic corn, oat, wheat and bran cereals are kept.

Rethinking the Arms Complex
LEAD: TOP officials of the Energy Department have recently spoken candidly about how decades of mismanagement and sloppiness produced a record of pollution and disrepair in the nuclear weapons industry that almost defied comprehension.

The Sugar Plum Set Dresses Up
LEAD: ONE of the few things more magical than watching the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy at Christmas time is to go to a party onstage after ''The Nutcracker'' and actually meet her.
It is also, of course, a rare opportunity to chat up Drosselmeier, who looks a little scary but is secretly a fun guy.


Just How Good Are The Knicks This Year?
LEAD: Good enough to win often and with style . . . to bring the game's smartest and loudest fans back to the Garden . . . to offer (and presumably sell) season tickets in the stratosphere . . . to help us forget the pathetic teams of the 80's . . . and to ease my pain over the Giants' loss to the Jets.

Elizabeth Journal; &gt;Anticrime Plan:A 'Berlin Wall'
LEAD: LIKE many aging residents in this Union County city, Iris Brown has a distrust of the streets.

THE REGION: In the Rockaways; A Queens Beachfront Is Ground for a Fight Over Housing Goals
LEAD: THE street sign, which identifies the intersection as Beach 69th Street and Story Road, is perhaps the only indication that civilization still has designs on the forlorn stretch of sand and weeds in the Arverne section of Queens.

Prospects; Deregulation Plus Five
LEAD: Five years ago, a Federal District Court ordered the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the nation's telephone monopoly.

The industry remains in flux, however, as companies move in and out of businesses.


Stocks That Have Nowhere to Go but Up
LEAD: The stocks of computer-chip manufacturers have reached historic lows and have nowhere to go but up, a growing number of analysts say. ''They've hit bottom,'' said Thomas P. Kurlak, an influential analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company.

They (the witches) look me in the eye with carefully guarded understanding and ask, ''Why?

Curbing Excess on Wall Street
LEAD: Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s dramatic decision to plead guilty to six felony counts of fraud last week and pay $650 million in fines for violating securities laws, comes at a critical juncture for the United States business community.

McCary smiled and shook her head in surprise.

Just How Good Are The Knicks This Year?
LEAD: I don't believe that there is another team in the N.B.A. that can stack up to the Knicks' lineup if you take into account the bench players.

At the shooting guard position they have two guys, Gerald Wilkins and Trent Tucker, who could start on a lot of N.B.A.

Slay Inflation With Rapid Growth
LEAD: Interest rates and the supposed trade-off between faster growth and higher inflation will be a problem for President Bush in 1989.

Two Cheers

TV: Under the Revival Tent
LEAD: ON a vacant rock-strewn lot last summer in the heart of a troubled Central Ward neighborhood here, a revival tent rose and a minister faced an anxious crowd.
For three weeks the Rev.
Brian Jefferson Mosley preached the gospel and performed old-fashioned head-dunking baptisms, all captured on film and the subject of a New Jersey Network documentary scheduled to be broadcast tomorrow at 7 P


HAVE YOURSELF A LITERARY CHRISTMAS
LEAD: HOWEVER one stands, or kneels, theologically, it's not difficult to agree that Christmas is one of the great human fictions - in that all of us who celebrate it know exactly what role we've been assigned in this year's picture-book enactment of the holiday.
Whether playing the ecstatic tissue-tearing child, the photographing parent, the maidenly aunt or avuncular uncle, we are never more ''literary'' than we are on Christmas morning.


CHILDREN OF CHOICE
LEAD: All of the reasons that Katha Pollitt and her friends give for having had an abortion add up to the same thing: me; me first.
What does it say for our generation when we feel that our lives should not be interrupted by inconvenience?
Are we being taught that we can respond to any problem by restructuring the environment to suit our needs?


CLEESE UP CLOSE
LEAD: John Cleese, looking fit and chipper, is sitting on a sofa in a television studio in Bristol, England, not far from where he was born.
He is on the 46th day of promotional interviews for his film ''A Fish Called Wanda.'' This interview will be, by his estimate, about the 150th he has given, but he shows no hint of the boredom or restlessness that this wearying process occasions.

Why Aren't You Sweating, Jane? Leave Me Alone!
LEAD: I LOATHE Jane Fonda.

In fact, she used to be someone I admired.


Romney Marsh
LEAD: To the Editor: The article about Romney Marsh (Travel, Aug. 28) by Benedict Nightingale has just come to my attention.
One or two minor misconceptions about the Marsh hardly detract from a delightful and wide-ranging account of this lovely landscape.
Your readers may be interested to know that the ''main road, cutting inland'' is not on the top of an ancient wall - straight as a die, it is the 13th-century canal cut to preserve the port of New Romney - unsuccessfully, as Mr.

Just How Good Are The Knicks This Year?
LEAD: Make no doubt about it, the Knicks are a good team.
Just how good is a question only a full 82-game schedule can answer.

After that, tune in in April.
