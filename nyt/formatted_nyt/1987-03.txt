Among the most notable examples is Yves Saint Laurent's use of Mondrian's motifs in 1965-66.
In this season's collections, many of the designs of Jean-Paul Gaultier, known for his Russian Constructivist images, seem to have emerged from the paintings of Richard Lindner and Oskar Schlemmer, while Oscar de la Renta's pouf skirts bring Degas's ballerinas to mind.

TROLLING FOR THE BASS VIA SMALL SPEAKERS
LEAD: The deepest notes in music have always cast a curious spell upon listeners, a kind of shuddering enchantment.
At some level of consciousness, this reaction may be linked to our ancestors' primal fear of thunder.

The Focus on Israel
LEAD: The fact that the Palestinian question was only brought up in the final portion of the article told me a great deal about Mr.

Star Wars and New Solutions
LEAD: If ''Star Wars'' is supposed to have a role, then I would define it as a ploy devised by the Soviet Union to cause us great harm.

DOES BOXING STILL HAVE APPEAL?

Boxing does not have ''appeal'' because there are too many sanctioning bodies (W.B.A., W.B.C., I.B.F., etc.) and too many Madison Avenue boys (who are pitted against club fighters or over the hill has-beens) and there is a general ignorance by the fans not interested in the artistry of boxing.

LEAD: Thomas Friedman's cogent summary of the varied causes for the world's consuming interest in Israel omitted the overriding reason.


A CHAMPION'S STYLE IS CONTAGIOUS

POTINGS: 24 in Columbia; Rural Housing
LEAD: For years, John P. Rooney, a real-estate lawyer in Manhattan, has owned 124 acres of untouched land in the Town of Greenport, N.Y.

CATALONIAN SHOES WITH A PAST
LEAD: Sundays in Barcelona, if you're walking near the cathedral just before noon, you'll hear the sound of instruments being tuned.
The music, which is coming from the square in front of the 15th-century building, is that of the cobla, an 11-piece band of wind instruments and double bass.
People are hurrying down the side streets, converging on the square, not for a performance, but to participate in a dance that takes place in plazas all over Catalonia, a fiercely independent region in northeastern Spain.

The chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees suggested last week that the law could still work even if

What I may lack in recruiting ability, I make up for in technical skills.
I have studied Wooden, Knight, Holtzman and Auerbach.

REALTY AND RUDE AWAKENINGS
LEAD: AFTER three years of dealing with Roman banks, language difficulties, and the incomprehensible bureaucratic tangles in which Italy specializes, I looked forward to the move back to New York.

IN PRAISE OF THE OLD-FASHIONED PERENNIALS
LEAD: An emphasis to buy everything new stirs gardeners to neglect the old-fashioned favorites.

One is silver and the other is gold.''


S.I. COLLEGE TEAM TO REFUSE TOURNAMENT BID
LEAD: The College of Staten Island basketball team has agreed to refuse a probable bid from a major invitational tournament, dropping opposition to a ban the college president had imposed on postseason play because of a brawl with racial overtones at a regular-season game.


IN THE SHADOW OF THE BUDGET DEFICIT
LEAD: REPORTS that the Administration and the Congressional leadership are prepared to abandon the $108 billion budget-deficit ceiling should be unwelcome news to anyone concerned with closing our trade deficit.

DOES BOXING STILL HAVE APPEAL?
LEAD: Boxing, slthough still maintaining its strongest fans, has lost much of the great general interest that has long sustained it.

Yet his life demonstrated as clearly as Dr.


THE CATCH-22 OF CONSUMER CREDIT
LEAD: IT SEEMS ironic.
While some deeply indebted credit-card customers find their mailboxes stuffed with new loan offers, other solid citizens find themselves unable to borrow because they lack that all-important passkey to obtaining credit - a credit history.
People who have never borrowed, or who have paid all their debts without a blemish or who have been living abroad sometimes discover they are ''nonpersons'' in the credit world.


USING THE FRUITS OF WINTER ADDS COLOR AND ZEST TO THE MENU
LEAD: IN winter the produce stands turn gold and orange with citrus fruits.

THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCATS' FRIEND

But he wasn't just another neighborhood stray.


MOVIE BLOODLINES LEAD TO RAMBO'S CHILDREN
LEAD: Films may not have the bloodlines that race horses do, but a hit has a way of leaving a trail.
Its descendants are liable to be indirect, thanks to the singularity that makes it a hit in the first place, and to the riskiness of exact cloning (since the authorized clone is almost always a letdown, and the clone without the ''II'' in its title seldom stands a chance).


MUSIC: CAYENNE JAZZ BAND
LEAD: THE Cayenne Jazz Band, which on Thursday played one of the two free jazz concerts being given daily through Tuesday at the South Street Seaport's Jazz Festival, is a seven-piece band with an unusual mixture of 1920's traditional jazz and 1950's be-bop along with generous servings of Duke Ellington.

'STARLIGHT EXPRESS' ROLLS TO MARKET WITH A ROCK BEAT
LEAD: If the $8 million Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ''Starlight Express'' becomes the commercial blockbuster that its producers envision, its advertising slogan, ''The race is on!'' could resound from coast to coast for years to come.

WHAT'S NEW IN MUSIC TECHNOLOGY
LEAD: GUITARS, a few brass instruments, even a violin or two line the counters along the entrance to Alex Musical Instruments on Manhattan's 48th Street.

THE NATION: New Price Index Bows; Charting How We Spend Our Money
LEAD: ECONOMISTS are never sure whether the periodic revisions in the ways the Government measures inflation will produce figures that are a little smaller, a little bigger, or about the same as before.
That also does not worry them much.
The statistically operative word is insignificant, though the adjustments, which reflect changes in the way Americans spend their money, affect almost every ''consumer unit,'' as the statisticians prefer to call households, through cost-of-living increases in labor contracts and Federal benefit programs.

A GUEST CONDUCTOR FOR THE PC
LEAD: DEVELOPERS of computer software appear to labor under the illusion that users will amass whole libraries of programs.

PART-TIME LEGISLATURE FINDS LITTLE TIME TP PONDER ETHICS
LEAD: GOVERNOR Cuomo took on a formidable task when he called recently for an end to letting New York's State Legislators dispense funds almost at will to institutions and groups in their home districts.

Suggested by the Art of Edward Ruscha.
A film by Gary Conklin.
Mystic Fire Video. 28 minutes. $50.

Revealing an Ordeal
LEAD: David L. Wolper, the producer, sought for years to put ''The Betty Ford Story'' on film.

LEAD: THE Hungarian pianist Zoltan Kocsis has made a considerable international career for himself over the last decade, in part through his concert appearances but in larger part, one suspects, through his many recordings.

The prosecutor asked the court to give Mr.
Abdallah, a Lebanese Christian, a ''moderate'' sentence, linking his punishment to the fate of French hostages in Lebanon and threats of terrorist reprisals in Paris.


DOES BOXING STILL HAVE APPEAL?
LEAD: Boxing will always have a special appeal for sporting fans.
Everbody likes a good fight, and boxing appeals to the primal instincts.
It is a one-on-one contest that pits two athletes against each other.

However, the sport has lost some of its luster with so many divisions and champions around.

SAILING THE THAMES, SOMEHOW

On the river, in a flotilla of anything that can be made to move over water, are English, Scots, Welsh, Southerners, Northerners, Midlanders, U's and non


RELAX, IT'S ONLY A THEORY

THE INSTANT SEASONED TRAVELER
LEAD: Following is a primer, offering suggestions to help the traveler smooth the way and get better value on a trip abroad.
AIR TRAVEL is much more expensive in Europe than in the United States and on the Atlantic routes.
European airlines belong to an organization that structures fares to what the expense-account traffic will bear.


Caray Plans Return
LEAD: HIS speech is still a bit slurred, and he'll need someone to push his wheelchair up the ramps at Wrigley Field, but if all goes well Harry Caray, the 70-year-old announcer who suffered a stroke Feb. 17, should be in the booth for the Chicago Cubs' first game, April 7.


CONCERT: JAPANESE MUSIC
LEAD: TWO performing groups, Kodo from Japan and the New York-based Soh Daiko, shared a concert at Japan Society on Tuesday that fairly rumbled and roared.
If most of the traditional Japanese music heard in the United States seems gravely ethereal, the music of the taiko, a large ceremonial drum featured by both groups, is certainly an antidote.

Raymond Myerson of Santa Barbara, Calif., took place last evening in Manhattan.
Rabbi David Posner officiated at the Pierre.


RIPENING DESIRE AND THE MUSE OF MIDDLE AGE
LEAD: LITERATURE misses out on most of the fun of art.
We don't get colors or new materials or music, just a lot of ''he saids'' and ''she saids'' mingled with greed and passion and ambition and bounded by the death of the characters or the laziness of the author or both.


A TANGY 'PIRATE' AND PRICELESS DUKE
LEAD: The Magician of Lublin HBO/Cannon Video. 106 minutes. $79.95.
If, as it appears, the lighting in this 1979 movie was designed to obscure rather than illuminate, it succeeds entirely in the video cassette version.


WHAT'S IN A NAME? HISTORY
LEAD: SOMETIMES the question is not so much what's in a name as it is what's in a place?

Owing to Fair Play
LEAD: Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr., Democrat of Indiana, has become one of the more unpredictable lawmakers in his 11 terms in the House.
Now he has drafted a bill that would treat members of Congress and other Federal employees just like other citizens if they are forced into bankruptcy.
The bill would repeal a current provision that shields some of their income from debtors.


CASE DIVIDES LEGISLATORS ON THE QUESTION OF ETHICS

Private Diplomacy, Exposed
LEAD: It's no longer conjecture about the White House's ''privatized'' foreign policy.
The details are as vivid as the unblushing memos in the Tower Commission report, as devastating as the flow charts showing how Lieut.
Col.
Oliver North squeezed secret donations from foreign clients for the contras.

BONECRUSHER SMITH: AN UNLIKELY ROUTE TO BOXING SUMMIT
LEAD: THE life of James Smith, of Lillington, N.C., has had the variegated richness that used to be virtually mandatory for the biographical blurb describing any red-blooded novelist.

LEAD: Top White House positions rarely come with any guarantee of job security, and these days their occupants are even less inclined to boast tenure.

Juvenal Delinquent
LEAD: Someone with classical tastes adorned the Tower Commission report with the apt epigraph, ''Quis custodiet ipsos Custodes?'' Every third-year Latin student knows that's from Juvenal: ''Who will watch the watchmen?'' Juvenal wrote a lot of good lines, suitable for moralizers of every persuasion.

'MISERABLES' ALREADY A FINANCIAL HIT
LEAD: By 10 A.M. last Friday, there were already seven people waiting to buy tickets for ''Les Miserables.'' One man said that he had never bought tickets for a Broadway show in advance, but that he had a friend who had seen this one in London and had ''absolutely loved it'' and talked him into it.
He was not alone.


THE QUIRKY BEHAVIOR OF BONDS
LEAD: Rarely has the credit market behaved more perversely than it did late last week.
On Thursday, bond prices fell when they should have benefited from a steep 7.5 percent decline in durable goods orders for January.

'THE BETTY FORD STORY,' ON ABC
LEAD: ''The Betty Ford Story,'' on ABC tonight at 9, is one of those sui-generis television presentations that command attention more for their subject matter than their artistic merit.
As a portrait of alcohol and prescription-drug addiction, the film is carefully subdued and, despite its messy subject, insistently tasteful.

IBERIA AIR COMES OFF ROPES

DAVID TAYLOR PERFORMS AT THE 92D STREET Y
LEAD: The bass trombonist David Taylor presented a creative and unusual concert at the 92d Street Y Saturday night.
Mr.
Taylor's instrument is a relatively unfamiliar one; so, too, was most the music he played.

Taylor built his program, especially the two extended suites of his own making.

MUSIC: A NEW 'SOUTH PACIFIC' BY THE CITY OPERA
LEAD: TO the New York City Opera's credit, its new production of ''South Pacific,'' which opened Saturday night for a nine-week run, seems a successful, intelligently intended reproduction of the Broadway original.
Yes, amplification is used, but it's subtly handled.
Yes, the New York State Theater is bigger than a Broadway house, but Desmond Heeley's entirely traditional sets fill the stage comfortably, and the characters don't disappear in the clutter.

The Other Catastrophic Cost
LEAD: The doubters and critics still have a point.

The script by Mark Magill offers snatches of a few days in 1936, out of order in an attempt perhaps to suggest the spirit of Stein's own ''Cubist'' writings.

A Daughter's Father
LEAD: I was most alarmed to hear that, since Richard Sandza's daughter, Annie, ''will never be an N.F.L. quarterback,'' she will ''have to settle for cheerleader.'' I would have thought that, given an interest in athletics, she might ''settle'' for being Grete Waitz or Martina Navratilova.

No Headline
LEAD: THE SCENE WAS MACABRE: on the stage of the Broadway Theater, two massive towers made of junk moved on tracks toward and then away from each other, a hulking, oddly graceful dance.

Partnerships: New Focus On Income
LEAD: DON'T write off limited partnerships as an investment vehicle yet.
The right partnership investment can offer individual investors considerable advantages - professional management; a relatively high rate of return with the potential for capital appreciation; direct ownership of underlying assets so that profits are passed through directly to the investor, and, the Tax Reform


ONE VOICE, HEARD 'ROUND THE COUNTRY
LEAD: SOME readers were perplexed last fall when a Pensacola, Fla., newspaper asked them to choose their favorite radio disk jockey.
Doc Bailey was nominated for best disk jockey by both WWAV in Ft.
Walton Beach, Fla. and WBLT-FM in Mobile, Ala., towns that are more than 150 miles apart.


Uninspired Judging
LEAD: Four years ago Brevard Hand, a Federal district judge in Mobile, Ala., held that the First Amendment's protections for religious liberty did not apply to the states.
So Alabama, if it chose, could establish a state religion.

THEATER: BILATERAL TALKS IN 'WALK IN THE WOODS'
LEAD: In Lee Blessing's play ''A Walk in the Woods,'' two arms negotiators - one from the United States and the other from the Soviet Union - meet in Geneva and edge toward common ground.

LEAD: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir wants the United States to stop giving special refugee status to Jews emigrating from the Soviet Union.

GETTING DOWN TO THE FINE PRINT
LEAD: THE United States and the Soviet Union have already worked out the main elements of an agreement on medium-range missiles - those capable of traveling between 1,120 to 3,100 miles.

THE ART BEHIND THE DOTS
LEAD: SLIGHT, TRIM, GRAY-HAIRED, ROY LICHTENSTEIN is a diffident man who immerses himself in his work and keeps the world at a distance.
The few who are permitted to visit his Manhattan studio are invariably struck by the discrepancy between this extremely reserved man and the brash, irrev-erent world of his paintings, in which a brunette leaps to catch a beach ball or a teen-ager coos to her boyfriend on the phone, ''Oh, Jeff .


STUBBORN MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD HOME
LEAD: I GO from room to room remembering.
I stop at my sister Pattie's old room and remember how pretty she looked as she stepped into her bridal dress 25 years ago. ''I'm feeling happy but nervous,'' I can hear her saying.

The Men Who Hold Colombia Hostage
LEAD: CARLOS LEHDER RIVAS THOUGHT HE WAS safe from arrest.
In fact, in all of Colombia, there were probably only a handful of officials who believed that he or any of a half-dozen other billionaire cocaine traffickers could be reached by the law.
After all, the ''mafiosos,'' as they are known locally, had repeatedly defied the Government, murdering anyone, from Cabinet Ministers to Supreme Court justices, who stood in their way.

WAS S.M.U. PENALTY APPROPRIATE?
LEAD: The penalty was not appropriate because it will have no impact in the long run.
As long as bigtime college athletics are million-dollar enterprises, and newspapers run the point spreads next to the schedules, we need only wait for the next scandal to hit.
Given the atmosphere in intercollegiate Division I sports and the control exercised by alumni and athletic directors, until the presidents and the faculties assume the responsibility for their athletic programs, we will continue to have periodic scandals, outrages and deaths.

FOR TALL EXECUTIVES: TWO BUMPS A DAY, $600 AN INCH
LEAD: EVERYONE wants to be a person of ''towering accomplishments.'' It's always a compliment when someone refers to you as a ''corporate giant.'' But what if you are literally a corporate giant?

Not because he's the chairman.


Comparing State Taxes in the Tristate Area
LEAD: The examples below show a couple with wages of $50,000, long-term capital gains of $10,000 (which under Federal rules are reduced to $4,000 for 1986 because of the 60 percent exclusion rule) and a spousal I.R.A. of $2,250.

LAW AFFECTING 1986 RETURNS: 14 brackets from 11% to 50% indexed  NEW LAW: Five rates in 1987, from 11% to 38.5%; 2 rates in 1988:, indexed, 15%, 28%, with 5% surcharge for some**
EXEMPTIONS


WAS S.M.U. PENALTY APPROPRIATE?
LEAD: One of the major goals of a university is to provide young men and women with the tools for life after ''rah-rah.'' They should also lend guidance toward the straight and narrow path.
S.M.U. (and many other major centers of higher learning) did just the opposite: corrupting young men with a variety of illicit inducements with little regard to their scholastic advancement.


A PEEK AT I.B.M.'S TRUMP CARD
LEAD: LUIS ARZUBI leaned over a microscope here the other day, focused on a small part of a silicon wafer jammed with hundreds of memory chips, and said with a broad smile: ''Here, look at this.'' Etched into the silicon, alongside the expected line of densely packed memory cells and razor-straight circuitry, was an unexpected image: a leaping gazelle.


Deborah Glick Weds
LEAD: Deborah Karen Glick, a group product manager for Pfizer Laboratories in New York, and Richard Dale Kirschner, a lawyer in New York, were married last evening in Alpine, N.J.
Rabbi Alan Greenspan performed the ceremony at the Tamcrest Country Club.
The couple's parents are Dr. and Mrs.
Stanley Glick of Liberty, N.Y., and Mr.


SOMEBODY TO TALK ABOUT
LEAD: AS THE MOVIE opens, a middle-aged man in an unimpressive coat walks through New York traffic, hands jammed in his pockets.
He enters a street-level door below a small sign that says ''The Performing Garage.'' Inside, at one end of a large room, an old wooden table holds a pitcher and glass of water.


Where Young People Choose to Live
LEAD: FOR Dillon Remler, it was a process of elimination that began with the boroughs.


THE DANCE: 'CHANNELS/INSERTS'
LEAD: MERCE CUNNINGHAM is a generous choreographer, for he always gives one lots to look at.
On Thursday night at the City Center Theater, when the Merce Cunningham Dance Company's program included ''Duets'' and ''Channels/Inserts,'' one could admire Mr.
Cunningham's handling of large and small groups.


PROSPECTS
LEAD: Inventories and Inflation A stronger economy and growing exports will encourage businessmen to slowly build up inventories, says Morris Cohen, president of Morris Cohen &amp; Associates, a Hackensack, N.J., consulting firm.
He expects the increase in non-farm inventories to be $12 billion higher this year than in 1986.


USE OF COTTAGES FOR HOMELESS STIRS CORTLANDT ZONING DISPUTE
LEAD: THIRTY homeless families have moved into a cluster of old white bungalows in a former summer colony at Mohegan Lake, but because of a zoning dispute their stoves have been removed and their future there is uncertain.


SCULPTURE THAT SPRINGS FROM SURREALISM
LEAD: WHILE THE EAST VILLAGE is not known as a sculpture center, there are an unusually high number of sculpture exhibitions there now, and they provide one more indication of the strength of the current sculpture situation.
The best of these shows are not going to satisfy addicts of the new.
They are likely to reward a search for independence and imagination.


THE PUBLIC'S FEELINGS ABOUT ITS FIRST LADIES ARE DECIDEDLY MIXED
LEAD: ''DESPICABLE fiction'' were the words a visibly angry President Reagan used last week to denounce reports that his wife Nancy was an aggressive manipulator of the affairs of state, who, after three months of acrimonious trying, had succeeded in ousting Donald T. Regan as White House chief of staff.


Michigan Shocks Purdue, 104-68
LEAD: Antoine Joubert scored 20 of his 30 points in the first half today as Michigan crushed Purdue, 104-68, dashing the Boilermakers' hopes for an outright Big Ten championship.


'Yankee' Police Chief Upsetting Shreveport
LEAD: Charles Gruber has ruffled a few feathers since he arrived here in December.


THE SONS OF COMMUNISM
LEAD: ONE IS A 52-YEAR-OLD Czechoslovak engineer; the other, a 38-year-old Hungarian architect.


U.S. AND CHINA UNITED BY ANTIPATHY TO THE SOVIET UNION
LEAD: NOBODY who knew Ronald Reagan's devout anti-Communism could have imagined that as President he would be helping ''Red China'' manufacture its own ammunition for 105 millimeter howitzers, training elite Chinese industrial managers and coordinating American and Chinese military aid to an Asian guerrilla force.


'TIME FOR THE NEW TRAINERS'
LEAD: FOR a boxing trainer, older is always supposed to be better.


New White House Aide May Be Leaving Post
LEAD: John O. Koehler, President Reagan's White House communications director for one week, has reportedly been asked to resign.


Financial Markets Favored
LEAD: IN the broadest sense investors should benefit from the Tax Reform Act of 1986 because the lower rates are aimed both at stimulating the economy and at letting individuals keep more of what they earn, thereby increasing the funds available for investment.
Also, with tax incentives removed from real estate and other shelters, the financial markets are more attractive.


COMPUTERS THAT DOUBLE AS TURNTABLES
LEAD: TO a computer, a radio show is only so many hundreds of thousands of bits of data.
And a growing number of studios are introducing computers that transmit that data, in the form of sound.
The result is that some disk jockeys who gave up records for tape are spinning disks again - floppy ones.


Recipe for Guesswork
LEAD: At 2 A.M. a week ago Friday, New York City's Board of Estimate succumbed to its dream, a world in which it will never be blamed for rent increases because they won't happen.


A TOP PLAYER NEARS A TITLE IN BRIDGE PLAY
LEAD: One of the leading players in the world women's rankings was in a commanding position going into the final session of the National Women's Pair Championship at the American Contract Bridge League's Spring Nationals here tonight.


REAGAN STRIVES TO DISPEL IMAGE OF HANDS-OFF LEADER WHO LOST TOUCH
LEAD: THE stakes were high as President Reagan, the old master of television oratory, addressed the nation from the Oval Office last week.
The Tower Commission report on the Iran-contra affair had not dealt with him kindly; he was a ''President who didn't do his job,'' as one member, Edmund S. Muskie, put it.


Holly Phillips Married To Ernest Peter Wiehl
LEAD: At the Episcopal Church of Our Saviour in San Gabriel, Calif., yesterday Holly Hamilton Phillips, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
James Albert Phillips 3d of San Marino, Calif., was married to Ernest Peter Wiehl, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Ernest Alfred Wiehl Jr. of Fairfield, Conn., and Stuart, Fla.
The Rev.


DRIVER TRAINING AND CRASHES
LEAD: ''A 'Skid School' for Drivers''  [ Feb. 15 ]  suggests that drivers with skid training in particular and driver education in general are better drivers.
Research evidence suggests otherwise.


REBELS WORK HARD FOR A BIG PAYOFF
LEAD: FOR the nation's No. 1-ranked college basketball team, the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, practice had ended.


ICON OF MODERNISM POISED FOR EXTINCTION
LEAD: THERE IS NOTHING, AT FIRST glance, particularly appealing about the Aluminaire House, a two-story box of glass and aluminum that sits on the grounds of an estate in Huntington, L.I.
The house is surely not lyrical in its detailing, and it is somewhat graceless in its proportions.
Moreover, bad alterations and years of neglect have put it in a condition that can most charitably be described as rundown.


NEW ROCHELLE FESTIVAL CELEBRATES THE FUNNY SIDE OF LIFE
LEAD: SUBURBIA - especially in Westchester County - has been a key ingredient in the mix of comedy that has entertained millions of Americans for almost a century, bringing them gags and chuckles, laughter and guffaws.


Searching for Mr. Bonaprop
LEAD: In his article ''Mr.
Bonaprop,'' (On Language, Feb. 15), William Safire writes that he has ''long been searching for the origin of 'The opera ain't over till the fat lady sings.' '' His most probative finding is a 1978 reference from The Washington Post that attributes the ''fat lady'' to a San Antonio sportswriter.


A PRIEST GOES TO COURT
LEAD: The Rev.
Charles E. Curran, on the losing end of a seven-year struggle with the Vatican over his liberal views on sexual ethics, has gone to court to try to overturn his suspension as a teacher in the theology department of Catholic University of America in Washington.
It is the only Catholic college in the United States that receives Vatican accreditation, and Father Curran has been a tenured full professor there since 1971.


SOLUTIONS SUGGESTED FOR REPAIR PROBLEMS
LEAD: TO catch up on mail, the Home Clinic column is again devoted to answering questions about frequently encountered repair and maintenance problems.


WHERE LIFE ALWAYS WINS
LEAD: PLAYBOYS AND KILLJOYS  An Essay on the Theory and Practice of Comedy.
By Harry Levin. 214 pp.
New York: Oxford University Press. $18.95.


IN THE 80'S, MONEY CAN BUY LOVE
LEAD: LOVE IS UBIQUITOUS.
SO ARE lust, rebelliousness and the urge to party.
As long as pop songs ride the airwaves, there will be come-ons and put-downs, promises of ecstasy and howls of frustration.
But while domestic affairs occupy the foreground, pop also picks up other cultural stirrings, and in the 1980's, songwriters have seized two new subjects: money and information.


A Daughter's Father
LEAD: One hopes Richard Sandza will come to understand that growing up ''big and strong'' doesn't mean being an N.F.L. quarterback (''A Daughter's Father,'' About Men, Feb. 1).
It means being big enough and strong enough not to worry about a tiny scar over an eyebrow any more than Golda Meir worried about the wart on her face or Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland worries that she isn't as tall as George


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
LEAD: WEITZ TO SPEAK ''I am normally not a novelist,'' said John Weitz, the celebrated fashion designer, who added that he would talk about ''what it is like to decide to write a book when writing is not your profession.'' The talk begins at 4 P.M. today in the Hackley School Chapel, Tarrytown.


A Hurled Stone Causes Injuries to Jersey Driver
LEAD: A New Jersey man was injured yesterday when a cobblestone was thrown through the windshield of his car as he drove on the Henry Hudson Parkway in Manhattan, the police said.


TEACHING THE CONTRAS LEFTIST REBELS' METHODS
LEAD: WITH new battle plans, weapons and American training the contra guerrillas appear to be on the offensive again in Nicaragua.
Infiltrating from Honduras through jungle passes like the ones that crease this mountain zone, the rebels say they are making a final effort to become a guerrilla force able to challenge the


BASEBALL'S RULING SERVANT

By Bowie Kuhn.
Illustrated. 453 pp.
New York: Times Books. $19.95.


From Con Ed, a Rare Announcement
LEAD: Since the Consolidated Edison Company had never made such a pronouncement in the lifetimes of most New Yorkers, it held a news conference last week to announce a reduction in electricity rates.


CONCERT: ILLINOIS ENSEMBLE
LEAD: THE Illinois Chamber Orchestra, formed two years ago using members of the Springfield Symphony, made its first trip to New York on Friday night.
Their program at Alice Tully Hall was cushioned by some interesting music and excellent soloists.


Relearning Old Strokes At School for Sculling
LEAD: It was 7:30 A.M. at the Florida Rowing Center.
Twenty-eight gleaming new fiberglass shells were stacked on racks under a large Australian pine.


AFRICAN SEEKING U.S. HEARING ON BURUNDI KILLINGS
LEAD: For the last 15 years, an African woman has sought to focus public attention on the mass killings in Burundi in 1972, win compensation for the families of victims and rehabilitate the name of her husband, a former Cabinet minister who was executed after he was accused of being an author of an uprising that preceded the killings.


Allison B. Conway Is a Bride
LEAD: Allison Brandes Conway and Richard Brian Carey, vice presidents in the investment banking sector of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in New York and London respectively, were married yesterday at the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn Heights.
The Rev.
Frank A. Goodwin, a Baptist minister, performed the ceremony.


...AND WHAT WE TELL THE HOUSE TO DO
LEAD: MY mother-in-law has this recurring nightmare.


HOW THE ISRAELIS FELL INTO STRAINS WITH WASHINGTON
LEAD: IN the history of Israeli-American relations, the last two weeks probably marked one of the lowest points.
First, the Tower Commission report singled out Israel for encouraging and facilitating - for its own interests - the American arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.
The ink on that report had barely dried last week when a Federal District Court in Washington sentenced Jonathan J.


On the Trail Of the Buddha
LEAD: Tracking the path of the peripatetic Buddha over the plains and mountains of Nepal can be an enlightening journey, but it can also be a bewildering maze for those trying to distinguish history from legend.


Cave-In Kills 3 at Foundry
LEAD: Sand stored in a silo at a foundry fell on three workers today, burying them alive, the authorities said.
The men were pronounced dead at the scene, said Reedsburg Fire Chief Don Lichte of Reedsburg, which is 40 miles northwest of Madison.
The three men apparently were clearing away sand that was clinging to the sides of the silo, Chief Lichte said.


FATS WALLER AND FRIENDS, 1941-1946
LEAD: Jazz Classics, a division of Videofidelity. 29 minutes. $19.95.


Dina Cathey Plans To Marry in June
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Sterling Eugene Cathey of Locust Valley, L.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Susan Diane Cathey, to Michael Nettleton Millard, a son of Mrs.
Donald Henry Millard of Greenwich, Conn., and the late Dr.
Millard.
A June wedding is planned.


PUBLIC-SECTOR UNIONS ARE LABOR'S DARLINGS
LEAD: THE decline of the labor movement has been much chronicled in recent years, as have the protestations of its leaders that the decline has been greatly exaggerated.
But the numbers show only one area in which organized labor is enjoying robust health.
Public-sector workers - from firefighters to sanitation workers to teachers - are doing far better than their private-sector brothers and sisters.


CONCERT: ABBADO LEADS VIENNA PHILHARMONIC
LEAD: THERE are those who question our late-20th-century culture's seeming fixation on Beethoven, on Beethoven concert cycles, on Beethoven recorded cycles.
Right now, starting last night, New York is being favored with another such series - this time of the complete symphonies and concertos plus three overtures in six concerts through Friday night, with the first two installments of Deutsche Grammophon's recorded cycle of the symphonies already in the stores.


TOWN REGULATES TANNING SALONS
LEAD: THIS quiet Somerset County commuter town may not be at the forefront on many issues, but it is breaking ground on tanning salons.


Maura A. Del Gaudio Plans To Marry Peter Marcon Jr.
LEAD: Dr. and Mrs.
Joseph M. Del Gaudio of Greenwich, Conn., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Maura Anne Del Gaudio, to Peter J. Marcon Jr., the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Marcon of Larchmont, N.Y.


TWO BARITONES FOR THE AGES
LEAD: Many of the best new records over the past year or so have been old.
Two outstanding ones are Seraphim's boxed reissue of all the surviving recordings of the baritone Mattia Battistini (1856-1928; IG 6153) and the Metropolitan Opera's release of its own broadcast politan Opera's release of its own broadcast of ''Simon Boccanegra'' from 1939, starring The ''Boccanegra'' provides the rare experience of hearing one of


Ohio Businesses Ask Curb on Prison Products
LEAD: Ohio businesses are pressing the Legislature to restrict the marketing and manufacturing of products made in the state's prisons.


WAS S.M.U. PENALTY APPROPRIATE?
LEAD: I don't think there's any doubt that S.M.U.'s penalty was appropriate, and I say that as an S.M.U. alumnus and an avid follower of Mustang football.
Nonetheless, when one looks at the litany of problems that has continued to surface in the S.M.U. football program during the past 30 years, somebody clearly had to do something and it had to be drastic.


BILLS ON GROUND WATER BEFORE CONGRESS AGAIN
LEAD: AS Connecticut strives to locate new sources of ground water, state environmental officials are hopeful that Congress will expand Federal technical assistance.


SPIRIT OF STAGE, BLAZING TRAILS
LEAD: IN Arthur Miller's new one-act drama, ''I Can't Remember Anything,'' which ends its run at Lincoln Center today, Geraldine Fitzgerald plays the role of a wealthy New England widow who meets nightly with a close family friend, Leo, trying to dilute the losses of the past by bantering and gently arguing with him about the absurdity and pain of old age.


Diocese v. Parish Over Prayer Book
LEAD: OF all the Episcopal churches in Connecticut, only Trinity-St.
Michaels in Fairfield refused to use the denomination's revised ''Book of Common Prayer'' or to recognize the ordination of women as priests.
The vestry said the prayer book, revised in 1979, was tainted by feminism and secular humanism.


CORRECTION
LEAD: An article on Feb. 8 on ''red-bag'' waste incorrectly identified the incineration site visited by Diane Carr, chief of staff for Assemblyman Patrick G. Halpin, Democrat of Lindenhurst, in June 1986.
The facility she visited was the Energy Combustion Corporation plant in Old Bethpage, which has been closed, and not Medi-Waste Inc.


Television
LEAD: ''The Spencer Tracy Legacy: A Tribute by Katharine Hepburn,'' a 1986 program that will be rebroadcast as a Film on Film special on Channel 13, Saturday night at 10:05, is another of those movie-clip compilations that celebrate the talent and glamour of film stars.
This one, however, is unusually rewarding.


THE EXUBERANCE AND DIGNITY OF LEONARD BERNSTEIN
LEAD: The preponderance of new records I come across repeat the obvious, so it is nice to find the occasional item that actually enriches the known or else opens a door to the less familiar.
Leonard Bernstein and the forces of the Bavarian Radio, for example, bring to Haydn's much-loved choral piece ''Paukenmesse'' the exuberance we have long associated with Mr.


Ms. Bluh Fiancee Of Dr. Lee Frost
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Alfred Bluh of Wayne and Deal, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Alison Robin Bluh to Dr.
Lee Thomas Frost, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
William Frost of Wayne.
A September wedding is planned.


Taiwanese to Be Tried in West in Murder of Writer
LEAD: A Taiwanese member of an international gang has been extradited from New York to California to stand trial for the 1984 murder of a Chinese-American journalist.


A HAUNTING WORK FOR ORCHESTRA AND SOPRANO
LEAD: The record I have listened to most often this past year is the Symphony No. 3 by Henryk Mikolaj Gorecki (Erato ERA 9275, no cassette or compact disk), featuring the Symphony Orchestra of the Southwestern Radio, Baden Baden, conducted by Ernest Bour.
It is a grave, melancholy work for orchestra and soprano, ineptly packaged with a cover that makes it look like punk rock, with no information about the composer, the artists or the origins of the symphony, no texts or translations.


PLAN IS OFFERED TO HEAD OFF AIR DELAYS
LEAD: WITH airport use expected to increase significantly over the next 20 years, officials should begin making major improvements at 10 of Connecticut's airports if they want to avoid air travel delays, the draft of a new report says.


Livia Brilliant to Wed Thomas G. Thompson
LEAD: Profs.
Richard and Eleanor L. Brilliant of Scarsdale, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter Livia Daniella Brilliant to Thomas Glenn Thompson, the son of Mary Edlo Thompson of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and the late John Lee Thompson.
A June wedding is planned.


MAKING THE TENANT THE 'RENTER'
LEAD: WHAT is a ''renter''?
Someone who rents an apartment, the layman is tempted to venture.


THE ZOROASTRIAN OF AMSTERDAM AVENUE
LEAD: THE RUG MERCHANT  By Phillip Lopate. 218 pp. New York: Viking. $16.95.


Jazz
LEAD: Charli Persip is one of the definitive modern jazz drummers, a graduate of Dizzy Gillespie's big bands and countless recording sessions, from some classic Blue Note albums of the late 50's to the present.
For a number of years now he has been leading his Superband, a big band that always benefited from his keen dynamics and deeply grounded rhythmic feel but suffered somewhat from a lack of stable personnel.


PILOT AND AIRLINE IN DETROIT CRASH HAD A HISTORY OF VIOLATIONS
LEAD: The pilot of a regional airliner that crashed and killed nine people Wednesday in Detroit was cited twice by the the Federal Aviation Administration for unsafe flying.


SAVIORS OF SOUND LOOK SOUTH, TO LESSONS OF CHESAPEAKE BAY
LEAD: PRESERVATIONISTS who hope to restore Long Island Sound are looking south, to the murky waters of the great Chesapeake Bay, for guidance.


Butcher Off First
LEAD: THE person who was first across the finish line in the 1986 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race was first across the starting line yesterday in Anchorage, Alaska, bound for Nome on a 1,100-mile trip.


Fields in Fettle

Fields, Margaret Dumont, Franklin Pangborn, Leon Errol. 1941.
Kartes Video Communications. 71 minutes. $19.95.


NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Kansas City, Mo.; Failed Project Is Demolished
LEAD: LESS than 30 years after it was built, the Wayne Miner Court housing project had become so rundown that Kansas City officials considered letting the state use it as a prison.


Do We Want a New Reagan but the Old Policies?
LEAD: To the Editor:


APARTMENT LIFE, WITHLOTS OF EXTRAS
LEAD: Some elderly people are too healthy for nursing homes, yet wary of the fen-for-yourself living of a standard apartment complex.
In an effort to create something in between, Paul T. Liistro is developing a retirement center in his hometown of Manchester, Conn., that will provide individual apartments as well as an exhaustive, perhaps an exhausting array of services.


Cissy Wade Is Engaged To H. T. Van Ingen 3d
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Gertrude Crockett Wade of Atlanta and George E. Wade Jr. of Columbus, Ga., of the engagement of their daughter, Trudy Wade, to Herbert Terrell Van Ingen 3d, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Van Ingen Jr. of Greenwich, Conn.
A July wedding is planned.


Cuba's Presence In Angola
LEAD: There's nothing so ''strange'' about Cuba's presence in Angola; James Brooke's study of the history of the region is just incomplete (''Cuba's Strange Mission in Angola,'' Feb. 1).
For starters, John Stockwell, the Central Intelligence Agency chief in Angola in 1974-75, writes in his book, ''In Search of Enemies,'' that the United States had opposed the Movement of the Popular Liberation of Angola (M.P.L.A.) in the 1960's and titilylyrerevented Angola's different political factions from negotiating a settlement.


Unusual Causes and Parties
LEAD: Cole Porter Oldie March 9 - The Bandwagon of Vintage Musicals has the nostalgic function of producing elderly musicals that probably would not fill a contemporary Broadway house night after night, like its productions of ''Bittersweet'' by Noel Coward and Vincent Youman's ''Rainbow.'' In the same category is Cole Porter's ''Star Dust,'' written in 1931 but never produced, although some of its songs, including ''I Get a Kick Out of You,'' went on to shine in later Porter musicals.


Army Morale And Lottery Plan
LEAD: IN need of funds for overseas morale and recreation programs, the Army was reported considering last year whether to start a lottery.


BOSTON, WITH EYE TO THE PAST, PLANS BIG EFFORT TO INTEGRATE PUBLIC HOUSING
LEAD: The city, which was torn by violence when it integrated its public schools in the 1970's, will make a concerted effort this spring to integrate its public housing when it begins to rent out more than 1,700 renovated apartments.


NORTH'S AIDES LINKED TO AUSTRALIA STUDY
LEAD: Several former military and intelligence officers who helped Lieut.
Col.
Oliver L. North ship weapons to Iran and Central America were closely associated with the co-founder of an Australian financial concern that collapsed in 1980, according to an Australian Government investigation.


Christine Bergin Becomes a Bride
LEAD: Christine Bergin, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Martin J. Bergin Jr. of Washington, was married there yesterday to Edward W. Whittemore Jr., the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Whittemore of Stamford, Conn.
The Rev.
David Mudd performed the ceremony at Our Lady of Victory Roman Catholic Church.


PHILANTHROPY IN A TIME OF TIGHTER GIVING
LEAD: THE young social activists of the 1960's are not expected to become the big givers of the 80's, even though many nonprofit organizations are counting on them now that Federal budget cuts have made the groups more dependent on private funds.


Mets Need Time
LEAD: Regarding Joseph Durso's article (''Mets Given Off-Field Pointer,'' The New York Times, Feb. 22), I fail to believe the only off-field pointer given for the regrettable incidents was ''I cautioned them not to discuss it.'' In my opinion this is not facing the off-field problems but simply sweeping them under the carpet and hoping they will go away.


DEMOCRATS ON BOARD OUTLINE THEIR PRIORITIES
LEAD: DEMOCRATS on the Board of Legislators criticized County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke last week for what they said was his failure to deal adequately with the major problems facing Westchester: a rising county budget, declining garbage-disposal capacity and the plight of the homeless.


FIRST, SET HIGHER ETHICAL STANDARDS...BUT NEW RULES ARE NEEDED, TOO
LEAD: THE insider trading scandals have left the investment community shell-shocked, reeling in an atmosphere of betrayal, anger, and self-doubt.
Stronger enforcement and some new regulations will deter future violators, yet those of us on Wall Street have already been galvanized into taking steps that, I am confident, will further reduce these abuses.


Jo Klingenstein, a Teacher, Engaged To Marry Peter R. Ziesing in August
LEAD: The engagement of Joanne Lee Klingenstein and Peter Raymond Ziesing, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Robert August Ziesing of St.
Davids, Pa., and Center Sandwich, N.H., has been announced by Mr. and Mrs.
Lee Paul Klingenstein of Scarsdale, N.Y., parents of the future bride.
An August wedding is planned.


NEW JERSEY JOURNAL
LEAD: AGRICULTURE MUSEUM ALTHOUGH it has no building to call home, the Agricultural Museum of the State of New Jersey does not exist on paper only.


AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE SILENT AND THINK ABOUT NEW GOALS
LEAD: WHEN I was a boy, I recall my grandfather's sitting quietly in his armchair, smoking his pipe and being very silent.
When he did venture a remark about world affairs or the weather, my grandmother would snarl at him:


Patricia Yeh Plans to Wed Lawrence Lue in Autumn
LEAD: Patricia Teresa Yeh and Lawrence Livingston Lue, who graduated from Cornell University in 1981 and received M.B.A. degrees in 1983 from New York University, plan to be married in the fall, Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Yeh of Williamsville, N.Y., father and stepmother of the bride-to-be, have announced.


Thomas Wolfe
LEAD: To the Editor:


Tanzanian Treasures, New Wing in Boston
LEAD: Rock Art From The Stone Age


U.S. FERRY STANDARDS CALLED TOUGHER
LEAD: A ferry of the type that capsized off Belgium on Friday night would probably be prevented from operating in United States waters because the design would not meet standards here, a Coast Guard inspector said yesterday.


CANTON IDEA: CERTIFY ALUMNI
LEAD: IF the Canton Superintendent of Schools has his way, when an employer finds a Canton High graduate to be educationally defective, the school system will fix the student free.
His idea likens students to consumer products, a comparison some people approve of and some do not.


Report Calls Mistrust a Threat to Atom Power
LEAD: Although the world now relies on nuclear power plants for 15 percent of its electricity, popular mistrust could bring a virtual end to the nuclear age early in the next century, according to a report published today by the Worldwatch Institute, a research organization.


Bolshoi Boy in a Romp
LEAD: Morning thunderstorms turned the $133,810 Gulfstream Breeders' Cup today from a 15-horse grass race to a five-horse dirt race, but the loss turned out to be more quantity than quality.
Bolshoi Boy, a prominent 3-year-old last year, showed he may be a major force this season by scoring a four-length victory over Arctic Honeymoon, Little Bold John, Smile and Come Summer on opening day at Gulfstream


TOPIC
LEAD: THE problem was that when a friend asked me if I could remember some ''first things'' that were important to me, I realized that I had blocked off a lot of those memories.
Last things are better.


Rome Flea Market
LEAD: To the Editor: Grazie molto for Louis Inturrisi's wonderful article on Porta Portese (''Roman Flea Market,'' Jan. 4).
As a student who lived in Rome for five months, I spent many Sundays wandering the stalls of this exciting market - certainly one of most entertaining ways to spend a Sunday morning (especially on a student's budget).


LIBRARY ELECTIONS: CONSOLIDATE THEM

THOSE TRICKY MUTUAL FUND COSTS
LEAD: UNTIL recently, mutual fund investors faced a simple choice: They could buy no-load funds directly, or they could purchase load funds and pay a broker's commission of up to 8.5 percent.
But now it requires a heavy dose of new math to compare the costs of different funds.
Apart from the customary operating expenses and management fees, fund managers have devised a farrago of other charges - high or low loads imposed when you buy, exit fees when you sell and some hard-to-find fees levied while you hold the fund.


A Verdict Eludes Gotti Jurors In First Day of Deliberations
LEAD: The jury in the John Gotti trial met for eight hours on its first day of deliberations yesterday without reaching a verdict.
Deliberations will resume today.


SOLUTIONS SUGGESTED FOR REPAIR PROBLEMS
LEAD: TO catch up on mail, the Home Clinic column is again devoted to answering questions about frequently encountered repair and maintenance problems.


NURSING PROFESSION AND POWER
LEAD: I read with great interest the article on the nursing shortage, for I, too, am a nurse who has recently left the hospital environment.
After 10 years of a continual love-hate relationship with my profession, I began to realize that the good did not outweigh the bad.
All those virtuous plans I'd made in nursing school to help mankind through illness blew away in a storm of short staffing, double shifts, low pay and, most intolerably, disrespect.


TRYING TO REGAIN THE MARKET IN CHIPS
LEAD: SEVEN years ago, the suggestion that the American computer chip industry would have to band together for survival would have seemed absurd.


WHERE'S THE GAME TONIGHT? ALL OVER THE COUNTY
LEAD: In Atlantic City it's the Golden Nugget or Caesars.
In Baltimore County it's the St.
Charles Borromeo School or the Pikesville Volunteer Fire Department or other unlikely institutions and groups that have been swept up by gambling fever.


FREE-WHEELING DEBATE ON FIRST AMENDMENT
LEAD: Freedom of speech, the principle embodied in the First Amendment to the Constitution, was the subject of fierce debate at a forum last week at the New York Public Library.


Jonestown Epilogue
LEAD: In a flashback to a horror tale, Larry Layton, a onetime follower of the Rev.
Jim Jones, a California cult leader, was sentenced to life in prison last week in San Francisco.
Mr.
Layton had been found guilty in Federal district court of conspiring in and aiding and abetting the 1978 murder in Guyana of United States Representative Leo J.


ANTI-SMOKING GROUPS QUESTION ETHICS OF TOBACCO CONCERNS' GIFTS TO THE ARTS
LEAD: When the Joffrey Ballet begins its national tour in Denver next week, the name of the largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States - Philip Morris Companies Inc. - will appear on thousands of the dance group's program guides and promotional posters.


THE JOY OF SKIING
LEAD: As a couple who enjoy skiing with our children and grandchildren, we feel compelled to comment on Barbara Klaus's ''Long Island Sound'' article on Feb. 1  [ ''Skiing: Are We Having Fun Yet?'' ] .


A TASTE OF THAILAND IN DANBURY
LEAD: RUN, don't walk, to Bangkok, the new and only Thai restaurant in Connecticut.

LEAD: To the Editor:


FOOD
LEAD: THOSE WHO ASPIRE TO THE American version of beurre blanc and puff pastry don't want to hear about cheese fries and Coca-Cola cake.
That is why Jane and Michael Stern, chroniclers of ''real American food,'' are persona non grata in some food circles.
What they have discovered on this country's back roads and byways over the last decade is often at odds with the cognoscenti's idealized picture of an elegant and classically pure culinary heritage.

ON INTRUDERS PARKING IN HANDICAPPED SPOTS
LEAD: I read with interest your article of Feb. 8 on parking for the disabled  [ ''Allocating Parking for the Disabled'' ] .

PAINTING WITH FANCIFUL STROKES
LEAD: HE HAS A LOOK OF THE NORTH-ern Renaissance.
Alert, bald, trim-bearded and rufous, he could have been a reluctant halberdier, somewhere in the Low Countries.

BUYERS BEWARE OF INVASIVE PLANTS
LEAD: Usually mail offerings for plants are printed in lively colors.
The copy is written in enticing language to make them sound like ''must haves.'' Caution.

Rather than joys to behold, these plants too often turn out to be nuisances or takeovers, the invasive species that gardeners would rather not have.


RECRIMINATIONS IN SWEDEN

In the year since the Swedish Prime Minister was gunned down on a Stockholm street, the police have interrogated hundreds of people, including Kurdish extremists and a member of a right-wing group.

IS THE MAFIA LIVING ON BORROWED TIME? A New York City Police Department expert on organized crime.    All of the recent trials showed that law enforcement could infiltrate the top leadership with informers and bugs. The new bosses probably will try to insulate themselves from us by having less contact with the capos (captains). There will be less reporting for instructions about routine business.  WILLIAM H. WEBSTER  Director of the F.B.I., who was chosen by President Reagan last week to be Director of Central Intelligence.    We don't claim to have finished the job. However, we have made a significant impact and they will never be able to operate again in the same manner.

LEAD: TWYLA THARP'S NEW WORKS -to be seen on a national tour following her company's season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music -have made that season the most successful ever in terms of popular appeal and packed houses.

John's limped through the last agonizing minutes of a brutal 80-51 loss to Providence Friday night, the question was, ''Are the Redmen finished?'' Perhaps not yet.

UNCERTAIN DAYS FOR CATCHERS-EMPLOYED AND UNEMPLOYED

ART ON THE MOVE BRIGHTENS WINTER
LEAD: TO coatmakers with an artistic flair, a plain cloth coat is like an empty canvas, waiting to be filled.
So fill these canvases they do, with all manner of decoration, from collages or silk-screened portraits to personal messages in applique.
In the process, these artisans have turned an otherwise utilitarian garment into an eye-catching delight, making the transition from autumn to spring much smoother.


Rewards of a Literary Marriage
LEAD: I am mystified that, despite her obvious and earnest footwork, Leslie Garis omits to mention Joan Didion's last and, arguably, best novel ''Democracy'' (1984), a particularly striking omission as it features an authorial and authoritative alter ego, one Inez Chistian Victor, and the elemental forces - vividly captured by Ms.

THE NEW BATTLEGROUND: RELIGION IN SCHOOLS TEXTBOOKS
LEAD: EVANGELICALS have long contended that the nation's Christian heritage has been omitted from school textbooks and replaced by the influence of a philosophy they call ''secular humanism,'' which is said to put humans not God at the center of life.
That argument attained the force of law in Alabama last week when Federal District Judge W.


WHAT'S NEW IN RADIO BROADCASTIN
LEAD: THIRTY years after it lost the battle for the living room to television, the radio industry is facing an all-out war.
Faced with music videos, compact disk players, portable cassette decks and digital record players, it is up against an ever-increasing number of competitors that are either distracting its audience, attracting its advertisers, or both.


PROPER PLANNING A KEY TO L.I.'S FUTURE
LEAD: James Larocca's comments on the Long Island Opinion Page on Feb. 8  [ ''Cautionary Note on L.I.

THE A.M. STATIONS GO FOR A FACELIFT

CONCERTS FOR YOUNGSTERS

THE MARINE OFFICER
LEAD: GOING TO A SUNDAY AFTER-noon movie is usually a good tonic for a retired Marine general suffering from midwinter blues.

New York: Beaufort Books. $17.95.


CRIME
LEAD: Simon Brett first attracted an enthusiastic following with his Charles Paris mysteries.
Paris - he is still with us - is a so-so British actor always getting involved with murder.
But what has made the Paris mysteries so entertaining are the show business asides, told with wry humor.
In some of his recent mysteries without Paris, Mr.


BUSH'S 'HUMPHREY' FACTOR

Carlton's Good Start
LEAD: THE comeback bid by Steve Carlton took a positive turn yesterday when the Philadelphia left-hander pitched two innings in the Phillies' exhibition game opener against the Toronto Blue Jays.

No Headline

With ''Little Ham,'' the George Street Playhouse here is offering such a treat - a modest one, but a treat is a treat.


ON LANGUAGE
LEAD: THERE I WAS, LYING on my back, bubble gum wadded in my cheek, a copy of ''Sheena, Queen of the Jungle'' held before my deliciously shocked eyes, ready to yell the fa-vorite comic-book sound, ''Aieeeee!'' as the muscular maiden pounced on some unsuspecting leopard, when my mother appeared at the doorway like a Neil Simon heroine to pronounce the awful imprecation: ''Lounge lizard!


Real Estate Loses Much Of Its Glory
LEAD: AS a result of last year's tax act, the real estate industry may no longer be the most favored child of the Internal Revenue Code, but it is still part of the royal family of investments.

Not at tax season.
Annually it makes its relentless winter/ spring imprint on our lives.


BLAST YIELDS CLUES ON COSMIC EVOLUTION
LEAD: Blazing with the light of nearly a billion suns, the exploding star that burst into view over the Southern Hemisphere Feb. 24 is yielding a trove of clues expected to help decipher the evolution of the universe.

Taos
LEAD: To the Editor: The article on Taos Ski Valley in New Mexico (Travel, Feb. 8) was interesting and informative, but I'd like to add to it.

MATERNAL MYSTIQUE AND TENDING PLANTS
LEAD: FOR some time now, I have harbored a secret guilt regarding my adamant aversion to the growing of house plants.
It is not the plants themselves that I object to; I love nothing more than a home overabundant in the lush greenery of nature.
It is, rather, the actual caring and tending process that I dislike, the nurturing of sprouts, the trimming of overgrown foliage, the watering and transplanting, the threat of all manner of pests.


A Florida Shore Where Solitude Rules
LEAD: The advertisement is inviting but vague - ''Escape to the island that time forgot - a pristine barrier island off the northwest coast of Florida.'' The only clue to the island's whereabouts is the name of a town, Carabelle, which the map shows is on the coast, west of the big bend on the Gulf of Mexico.

IN ART, AS IN LIFE, HIGH AND LOW SHOULD BE MINGLED BUT NOT MUDDLED
LEAD: THE MUSEUM OF MOD-ern art is currently planning a ''High-Low'' show for 1990, in which modern art is to be displayed side by side with its popular sources.

LEAD: FIFTY YEARS AGO, George Gershwin died of a brain tumor at the age of 38, shocking the musical world.


Gibbs's Task: Rebuilding The I.R.S.
LEAD: THE ghost of 1985 still haunts the Internal Revenue Service.
Talk to tax lawyers, agency employees, even some taxpayers, and they say that 1985 remains fresh in their minds - the year when the agency's computers suddenly went beserk.
The machines lost countless returns, sent thousands of erroneous letters to taxpayers demanding payments, and, in general, created the greatest collection of woes the service has ever seen.


Lower Rates, Fewer Breaks
LEAD: WELCOME to a new era in American tax policy.
Tax rates are at their lowest level in more than half a century, and many long-cherished tax breaks have been sharply curtailed, if not banished outright.

OVERNIGHT SENSATION UPSTAGED
LEAD: THE Big East tournament record lasted nearly 16 hours; the euphoria lasted only a few hours longer.


TIMIDITY VS. SPIRIT AT THE OPERA
LEAD: THE MOST IMMEDIATELY STRIKING FEA-ture of the Metropolitan Opera's 1987-88 repertory, announced the other day, is its timidity: just three new productions are planned, two of them segments of a ''Ring'' that will not fully materialize for two more seasons, the other a ''Trovatore'' perilously built around a great singer in decline, Joan Sutherland.


State Links To Federal Tax Code
LEAD: Although there are variations on the theme, the majority of states link their state income taxes to the Federal income tax code.

Pan Am's People
LEAD: To the Editor:


WHAT'S SHORTER, MORE COLORFUL -- AND MAYBE EASIER TO READ?
LEAD: FIRST there was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, promoted on its promise of simplification.
And indeed, it lowered the rates most people pay.
Then there was the Internal Revenue Service, directed to create a new W-4 form for taxpayers to compute how much should now be withheld from their paychecks.
And then came the howls of confusion, anxiety and frustration from taxpayers, their accountants and the politicians who represent them all.

LEAD: Gov.

THE DEEPER CHALLENGES OF STRIKING A MISSILES DEAL IN EUROPE
LEAD: THE nature of an imaginable war in Europe suddenly looked different last week.

CONCERT: FOSS AND SZERYNG
LEAD: HEITOR VILLA-LOBOS, born 100 years ago this month, is best known to us for his chamber and vocal works; though the list of his orchestral compositions is long, it is largely unexplored.
The Brooklyn Philharmonic's announcement of his Sinfonietta No. 2 (1947) for Friday night's concert at the Academy of Music promised a chance to hear an intriguing specimen in performance, but in the event, the more simply scored Sinfonietta No.

TYSON UNIFIES W.B.C.-W.B.A. TITLES

CAPE ACTS AGAINST HOUSING SHORTAGE

Use 1986 To Prepare For 1987
LEAD: THERE'S one big difference between 1986 and all previous years for taxpayers - that is 1987.
Little has changed for the 1986 returns that are due next month.
The forms look very much as they did a year ago, and most of the familiar deductions are there to be taken.
It's the calm before the storm.
The big differences, the changes wrought by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, will begin to be felt a year from now.

FEDERAL SALTWATER FISHING LICENSE SOUGHT
LEAD: For the second year, the Reagan Administration has sought to defray rising budget costs by requiring saltwater fishermen to pay at least $6 for a license.


YEARNING FOR THE DAYS OF SPRING
LEAD: MARCH: No month seems longer, 31 days without a break.
Unless Easter arrives early - which this year it doesn't - no holiday gives transitory relief.
The best March can muster is St.
Patrick's Day; no wonder everyone turns Irish on the 17th.
But you don't get a day off from work to celebrate or recover from it.

The Worm and the Apple; Automobile Breakdowns: Urban Cowboys
LEAD: For motorists, a collision on a New York City street means filing police reports and insurance claims and repair work, if not injury or death.
For the city's special breed of tow-truck cowboys, however, it means a reckless race for business.


PERSONAL HEALTH
LEAD: THE notion that various foods and nutrients can boost resistance to disease is one of the main tenets of popular but pseudoscientific nutritional theories.

Very fast.
Spring drifted in on Saturday morning, hung around long enough to make a few hearts beat faster and at about dawn on Sunday yielded to summer.

CONCERT: ROBERT CRAFT IN STRAVINSKY PROGRAM
LEAD: ROBERT CRAFT remains Igor Stravinsky's indefatiguable champion - the constant flow of what might called scholarly scrapbooks of Stravinskyana edited by him attest to that.
But as a performer of Stravinsky's music, Mr.
Craft has rather faded from the scene.
It was interesting, then, to encounter him at the helm of a Composers' Showcase concert Monday night at Alice Tully Hall, devoted to two mid-period Stravinsky masterpieces, ''Oedipus Rex'' (1927) and the ''Symphony of


Threat by Clemens
LEAD: If necessary, Roger Clemens is prepared to sit out the 1987 season, and his agent has countered the Boston Red Sox threat to fine the pitcher $1,000 a day for each day he is absent from camp with a threat of his own. ''Starting tomorrow, our offer to the Red Sox will increase by $1,500 a day,'' said Randy Hendricks, who claims Clemens ''feels insulted'' by Boston's proposal of $500,000 a year plus incentives which the club claims are worth $350,000 more.

FILM: SPALDING GRAY'S 'SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA'
LEAD: IT would be wrong to think of ''Swimming to Cambodia'' as a one-man show, even though it captures the performance of a single artist, Spalding Gray, as he sits alone on an almost empty stage.
For one thing, Mr.
Gray's feature-length monologue brings people, places and things so vibrantly to life that they're very nearly visible on the screen.

Stop Pakistan's Nuclear Bomb
LEAD: For years, Pakistan has lied to the United States about not having a nuclear weapons program, and for years the United States has bought the fiction.

Following are excerpts:


Perle Is Bowing Out, His Goals and Acerbity Intact
LEAD: Richard N. Perle, a staunch opponent of past arms control agreements with the Soviet Union and one of this city's most accomplished bureaucratic infighters, will leave office this spring, having accomplished his two main policy objectives: He has helped keep the Reagan Administration from concluding new agreements he deemed unsound and he has helped keep it from observing the old ones he was against from the start.

ART: AL HELD'S TAXIS, A WATERSHED FROM '59
LEAD: IN 1959, in the spaciousness and light of the studio of Sam Francis, Al Held attached photographic paper to the walls and painted four works that would signal his break with Abstract Expressionism.
The paint was acrylic.
The color was not mixed, as it tended to be in Abstract Expressionism, but black and white and the three primaries.

Our Towns; Trash From L.I. Sits Uneasily In Upstate Dump

OPERA: NEW PRODUCTION OF 'TURADOT' AT THE MET
LEAD: TWO decades have elapsed since the Metropolitan Opera opened its new house at Lincoln Center with a production of Samuel Barber's ''Antony and Cleopatra'' so ornately designed and overbearingly directed by Franco Zeffirelli that the night went down as an unforgettable fiasco.
Since then, Mr.
Zeffirelli has gone from excess to excess, most recently giving the Met such glittering shows as his inflated ''Boheme'' and his elephantine ''Tosca,'' both of which seem to delight Met audiences with their extravagance.


BAN ON TEXTBOOKS APPEALED
LEAD: The State Board of Education voted 5 to 4 today to appeal the decision of a Federal district judge who banned 44 textbooks from Alabama's public schools on the ground that they were promoting ''secular humanism'' as a religion.

Along with his chef and partner, Thomas Keller, a former chef at Raphael and La Reserve, he has created one of the handsomest and most provocative restaurants in the S


Hanged Man Called Suicide
LEAD: An unidentified man whose body was found hanging from a tree in Central Park early Wednesday, bound hand and foot, is believed to be a suicide, the police said yesterday.
A wallet containing $7 was found in the victim's pocket, but it held no identification papers.

Marlowe Play
LEAD: Christopher Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' will be presented by the Classic Theater through April 5 at the Shakespeare Center, 165 West 86th Street.

Children Return to Mothers
LEAD: Three children found in a park here last month have been returned to their mothers, members of a commune in the Washington, D.C., area.

The four boys and two girls were taken into state custody after they were found, dirty and insect-bitten, in the park.


Stern Justice for The Bronx
LEAD: The 12-year prison sentence for Stanley Friedman, the former Bronx Democratic chairman, is one of the stiffest in the annals of municipal corruption.
It properly measures this once-powerful politician's betrayal of public trust.
Such is Mr.
Friedman's continuing aura of influence that Judge Whitman Knapp saw fit to guard against his eventual return to power, especially over judge selection.


ORSER WINS AS BOITANO FALTERS

Tonight, it lost the men's title, and on Saturday night it will face an uphill battle to keep the women's.

OHIO STATE COACH EXPERT ON HOYA STYLE
LEAD: It isn't unusual for a young coach to study the strategies, techniques and styles of those he admires most.
So for the raw, yet energetic coach at American University several years ago, luck was in his favor.

Q&amp;A

The apartment next door to ours in the city recently became available and we would like to buy it and join it with ours to make one larger apartment.
If we joined the city apartments, would they be considered one residence for tax purposes, or would we be considered the owners of three residences - making the mortgage interest for the new purchase nondeductible according to the revised tax rules?

VIETNAMESE CUISINE IN GREENWICH
LEAD: ON entering the white-walled, high-ceilinged upstairs dining room of La Maison Indochine in Greenwich, one has the illusion of stepping into a cool oasis from the steamy heat of Vietnam.

WALKERS IN THE SUBURBS: A RARITY
LEAD: ANOTHER car emerges from a suburban garage, then rolls rear-end-first out into the street.

A NEW EXPERIENCE IN SIMPLICITY
LEAD: The newly introduced Canon EOS 650 and I went off to the Caribbean last week, a new experience for both of us.

I, on the other hand, took a few days to get relaxed with my high-tech companion.

STREET-CORNER ORATOR'S DEATH MARKS END OF ERA IN HARLEM

MARCHING TOWARD MATURITY
LEAD: JOHN HUGHES IS A MAN WITH FEW champions, and for good reason.
His detractors would argue that he has made some of the most cavalier, sophomoric films in recent years, and they would be right.

IN A CITY THAT LOVES A DEBATE, STORMS SWIRL OVER ITS NEWEST MUSEUM AND CULTURAL FUNDS
LEAD: LE MONDE THE OTHER DAY ran one of those backward glances designed, apparently, to make long-dead controversies look a little retroactively foolish.

Review; MUSIC: CARMEN McRAE
LEAD: CARMEN McRAE has risen steadily in stature as a jazz vocalist to the point where today she ranks alongside Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan as a supreme interpreter of American popular song.
Ms.

MEXICO FEARS THE LOSS OF AMERICA AS A SAFETY VALVE
LEAD: WITH just two months remaining before the main provisions of the new United States immigration law go into effect, Mexico is preparing for what many here fear will be a huge influx of returning workers.

LEAD: In the wake of the Pollard espionage case and the Iran-contra affair, American Jews are expressing greater anxiety about Israel's policies than at any time since the modern state was founded nearly 40 years ago, according to several American Jewish leaders.


Backstairs
LEAD: Once upon a time - from 1974 to 1977, to be precise - Sunday night went like this: After you washed the dishes and put the kids to bed and made sure you had enough cigarettes (lots of us were smoking then, remember?) and maybe poured yourself a little something, you sat down in front of the television set and thought of


Lynn Ackerman Planning to Wed
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Mr. and Mrs.

INDIANA DEFEATS AUBURN
LEAD: Steve Alford scored 31 points and his backcourt partner, Keith Smart, added 20 points and 15 assists as Indiana rallied from a 14-point deficit to beat Auburn, 107-90, today in the second round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Midwest Regional.


TAKING THE TODDLERS TO AUSTRALIA
LEAD: From the moment they walked into Toronto's Lester B. Pearson International Airport, one wearing a red sweatshirt with a choo-choo train emblem on the front, the other wearing an identical outfit in blue, it was obvious that Sarah and Stephen were not your typical travelers bound for Australia.
Neither weighed more than the three pieces of luggage we were taking with us on our three-week vacation.


A BLEAK PICTURE OF POLAND IN 'A WOMAN ALONE'
THE life depicted in the Polish film ''A Woman Alone'' is unrelievedly grim.
It is the life of Irena (Maria Chwalibog), an unwed working mother whose energies are being taxed to their limit.
She lives in a small room with her young son Bob (Pawel Witczak), and must share a bed with him; mother and son are also harassed by their landlord.
Her job as a letter carrier is so physically draining that she sometimes collapses under the weight of her sack.
Her life seems to hold no satisfactions, not even small ones.
Even when she bathes at home (where there is no indoor plumbing), she must do it with Bob's used bathwater.
And she has no real hope.
Irena pays weekly visits to a dying aunt whom she hopes may leave her a small sum, but the trips exhaust her even further - and she winds up having to assume household expenses for the aunt, who is apparently a miser.
She cannot turn to family, to friends, to her work or even to Bob for any comfort.


NEWS SUMMARY: SUNDAY, MARCH 15, 1987
LEAD: INTERNATIONAL  3-20  Stalin is the subject of public debate again in the Soviet Union, after more than 20 years.
The new campaign is more gradual and cautious than the de-Stalinization drive Nikita S. Khrushchev began in 1956.
Page 1  Iran's threat to oil tankers in the Persian Gulf has increased since it installed large land-based anti-ship missiles near the Strait of Hormuz, U.S.


JERSEY PAIR WINS BRIDGE TITLE
LEAD: Players from the New York metropolitan region made their presence felt in two major championships at the American Contract Bridge League's Spring Nationals here Friday night.


Stress and The Immune System
LEAD: It is becoming increasingly evident that the mind and emotions have a profound influence on immune-system function and that there is a continuing dialogue between these closely related structures (''New Clues to the Immune System,'' by Susan Squire, Feb. 1).
They use the same chemical messengers to communicate, and both have the ability to remember.


SKIING A VOLCANO IN THE DESERT
LEAD: Timberline at Mount Bachelor, nearly a full vertical mile above the desert floor of central Oregon, is a good place to forget the restraint of common sense and follow the tug of gravity.
Safety is fine, but on a mountain that seems made for the skier, it's more appropriate to relax, to move with the contour of the slope instead of trying to fight it.


Prague
LEAD: To the Editor: Re: Prague (Travel, Jan. 25) you were right.
One fears the place may be discovered, but we can't help letting on about its little pleasures.


'OTHER PEOPLE'S SMOKE': ROUND TWO
LEAD: On January 4, Business Forum ran a debate over the ills of passive - or, as it is more formally called, ''involuntary'' - smoking.
In his argument, Scott Edward Stapf of the Tobacco Institute questioned both Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's motivations, and his interpretation of data.
Moreover, he said that the recent Surgeon General's report on the subject is ''at odds'' with one released by the National Academy of Sciences in


GOING HOME AFTER A FAMILY QUARREL
LEAD: ''DO you have power?'' That is what a friend of mine asked me in the library a while ago.
I guess I looked at her sort of strangely, because the next thing she said was, ''I didn't mean in the large metaphysical sense.
I meant: Do you have power -you know, the storm and all?''


Timing Faulted In Drug Testing
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


FOR AN ADOPTED CHILD, CLOSED RECORDS VS. OPEN LOVING
LEAD: THE struggle to find myself has been a battle of heart and soul.
I am adopted.
The search for who I am could not start with my ancestors or blood relatives; I know little of them.
The search had to start from within.
People used to ask me how it felt to be adopted and it was always somewhat difficult to put my feelings into perspective.


TAKE ME TO THE BEACH: Beating the Heat Russian Style
LEAD: On a hot summer day in Moscow - there are usually a few before the first nip of autumn in mid-August - the place to be is the Bay of Joy, a tranquil junction of land and water about 15 miles outside the capital.


THE SHIITAKE MUSHROOM IS AT HOME IN MANY DISHES
LEAD: AMONG the foods that have been added to the culinary vocabulary in recent years are shiitake mushrooms.
Of all the varieties of exotic mushrooms, these are the easiest to obtain.


Dance
LEAD: The Murray Louis Dance Company opens at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday in a season that features the requisite premieres and revivals.
But the Louis dancers themselves are among the best reasons to get down to the Joyce during the company's two weeks there.
Mr.
Louis himself is, of course, one of the most engrossing solo performers around these days.


ETHIOPIA: REBELLION BEHIND A MASK OF CONFORMITY
LEAD: Ethiopia's Marxist Government, long a target of guerrillas financed by the Reagan Administration, appears to be more firmly entrenched but more widely resented than ever.


INDIA'S PRESIDENT CONFRONTS GANDHI
LEAD: A long-simmering dispute between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and President Zail Singh of India erupted in public this week, creating an embarrassing new political crisis for Mr.
Gandhi's Government.


Joseph Roth Reborn
LEAD: To the Editor:


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: THE PILTDOWN INQUEST.
By Charles Blinderman. (Prometheus, $22.95.) After three-quarters of a century, the perpetrator of the greatest hoax in scientific history remains unidentified.
Piltdown Man, represented by a human skull and apelike jaw found in an English gravel pit, stood tall in the halls of science as a missing link in human evolution for decades after the finds were announced in 1912.


KLEIN INTERCEDES IN RIFT
LEAD: JOHN V. N. KLEIN, the former Suffolk County Executive and new chairman of the Long Island Association, is trying to make peace between the association and many Republican state legislators from Long Island.


Walking Away From $2 Million
LEAD: HE checked into Los Angeles International Airport, and he struck a clerk as suspicious.
He was trying to exchange an airline ticket to Turkey for one to Switzerland.


Prague
LEAD: To the Editor: In reference to ''In Prague Today, Treasures of the Past,'' while I appreciate the information given by Olivier Bernier, I want to express my surprise and disappointment that no mention was made of the Jewish Quarter, which has so many important synagogues, buildings, museums and old streets, not to mention its world-famous old cemetery.


Dr. Gina A. Dunston to Wed in August
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Alice Zuber Dunston of Orange, N.J., of the engagement of her daughter, Dr.
Gina Allene Dunston, to Dr.
Peter Stuart Boone, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Nathaniel Boone of Closter, N.J., and Manchester, Vt.
The wedding is to be Aug. 8.


COMMUNITY BOARDS ARE FEELING UNLOVED AND POWERLESS
LEAD: LAST month, Mayor Koch announced that his administration had selected a team of developers to build a $636 million apartment and hotel complex on the Hudson River waterfront west of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.
Even before the selection had been made public, however, the local planning board, Community Board 4, said it would oppose any development at the site because it would exacerbate traffic congestion in the Chelsea


School's Needs Collide With New Zoning
LEAD: DURING a tour of the Nightingale-Bamford School, where she has presided as headmistress for 16 years, Joan McMenamin does not try to gild the facilities.
Rather, she emphasizes overcrowding.
She notes the computers forced out into the hallways, the cafeteria where lunch must begin at 10:30 A.M. to accommodate all 13 grades, the coats sliding off the racks onto the floor, the auditorium that doubles as a gym.


Michael C. Kanterman Wed to Ms. Neuberger
LEAD: At Congregation Rodeph Sholom in New York last night, Nancy Ellen Neuberger, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Neuberger of New York and Mamaroneck, N.Y., was married to Michael Charles Kanterman, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Abraham Kanterman of Spring Valley, N.Y.
Rabbi Gunter Hirschberg performed the ceremony.


CD PRICES HEAD FOR A DIP
LEAD: THE LONG-AWAITED PRICE break in compact disks hasn't quite arrived yet, but a major development in that direction will take place in the next few weeks and months, when all of the major record companies and some of the smaller ones introduce what they call budget or mid-priced lines of classical CD's, designed to carry retail prices of about $10.

A SYSTEM OVERLOADED: THE FOSTER-CARE CRISIS
LEAD: New York City foster-care children are being bounced from home to home and institution to institution in far greater numbers and under more chaotic conditions than officials, caseworkers and other experts can recall.


CHINA SEES LONG WAR ON WESTERN IDEAS
LEAD: Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang said today that China's campaign against Western ideas and for a reassertion of rigid Communist orthodoxy could last for decades.


IRISH SQUEAK BY; U.C.L.A. UPSET BY WYOMING
LEAD: Armon Gilliam scored 24 points and Freddie Banks added 15 as the University of Nevada-Las Vegas overcame a sluggish first half today and overpowered Kansas State, 80-61, in the West Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.


OASIS ON KANSAS PRAIRIE AWAITS CORPORATE FLIERS
LEAD: It looks like an airport: the familiar runways, the noise, the planes of all sizes moving awkwardly about on broad stretches of concrete.


GARY WARD PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW TO LAST IN MAJORS
LEAD: At various times in his baseball career, Gary Ward has had to push through roadblocks and avoid potholes.
He had to play in the minor leagues, for example, for eight years before winning a permanent job in the majors.
Then when he reached the majors to stay, he had to prove he could be an everyday player.


TOKYO'S SURPRISING GARDENS
LEAD: Tokyo is not the first city that leaps to most people's minds when Japanese gardens are discussed.
That distinction belongs, deservedly, to Kyoto.


Louise R. Merritt Planning to Wed
LEAD: The engagement of Louise Rose Merritt to John Devlin Keogh, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas F. Keogh of Larchmont, N.Y., has been announced by Mr. and Mrs.
William R. Merritt of Scituate, Mass., parents of the bride-to-be.
A September wedding is planned.


IN CANADA, NEW IMMIGRANTS AROUSE ETHNIC TENSIONS
LEAD: WHEN the Canadian Government moved last month to head off a rush of self-proclaimed refugees arriving at the country's airports and border posts, many of them Central Americans coming from the United States, it set off a highly charged debate.


On East 73d Street, A Lingering Vestige Of a Czech Heritage
LEAD: IT is one of those midblock surprises on the far-to-the-east East Side of Manhattan, well away from the well-traveled town-house and museum section.


WORDS AND MUSIC FROM THE DAYS WHEN WORDS AND MUSIC REIGNED
LEAD: IF there were still a Tin Pan Alley, it would have been talking about the motherlode of unpublished songs revealed last week, some unknown, many by some of its most famous songwriters, including George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Victor Herbert and Richard Rodgers.
The 80 crates of manuscripts, which had been assembled by Warner Brothers, were discovered about five years ago in a warehouse in Secaucus, N.J., and were moved to a vault in Manhattan.


CLASSICAL AND JAZZ ARTISTS MEET HALFWAY
LEAD: THE ''THIRD STREAM'' - a phrase the composer Gunther Schuller used in the 1950's to urge a confluence of jazz and classical music - is flowing wider and deeper than ever.
Jazz musicians are playing straight classical pieces, writing for chamber ensembles and working on hybrids where structure meets improvisation.


Mr. Henslow's Botanic Garden at Cambridge
LEAD: As the great parks and gardens of Europe come into bloom, three writers offer a nosegay of favorites.


O'ROURKE DEFENDS AIDS PLAN
LEAD: ''WE'RE dealing with a time bomb out there, and we must handle this on a countywide basis,'' County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke told county legislators in a packed committee room last week, explaining his decision to seek AIDS-center designation for the County Medical Center.


No Headline
LEAD: HALSTON, THE LEGENDARY fashion designer, sits in the two-story living room of his multimillion-dollar town house, his face slicked with bronzing gel.
He wears a black turtleneck, black slacks and red blazer, the outfit that was his signature when he was America's foremost fashion designer.
A fire fills the fireplace, white orchids fill the entry.


SHE INTERPRETS IN A SILENT WORLD
LEAD: ''I AM a freelance interpreter,'' said Elizabeth G. Nagler of Valley Stream.


SHORTCUTS TO SUMMER
LEAD: As soon as the temperature climbs above 55 degrees, the rush to peel off overcoats and gloves and pack away the heavy woolens begins.
For more and more men, the urge to cast off the trappings of winter extends to the hair as well.


Retiring Again
LEAD: HE was Julius Erving's coach at the University of Massachusetts, a man who retired eight years ago after turning in a 215-126 record, which made him the coach with the most victories in Minuteman history.
Now, at the age of 54, Jack Leaman, is retiring again, this time after a season as coach of the Massachusetts women's team.


British Paper Adding Sting to Death Notices
LEAD: Death's sting has a new meaning now that The Times of London is including candid descriptions of human peccadilloes in its obituaries.


EVIDENCE GROWS ON POSSIBLE LINK OF FIBERGLASS AND LUNG ILLNESSES
LEAD: Emerging evidence that fiberglass and other manufactured mineral fibers may cause lung cancer and other diseases is creating a sensitive, potentially far-reaching public health issue.

LEAD: Charles H. Tally, an expert in real-estate law and a senior partner in the New York law firm of Bachner, Tally, Polevoy, Misher &amp; Brinberg, died of cancer Friday in United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y.
He was 72 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.


CORRECTION
LEAD: A picture caption in some copies last Sunday with an article about the New York Knicks' game against the Los Angeles Clippers misidentified the player at the left.

LEAD: The Reagan Administration and Congress are poised for a fight over aid to Pakistan because of its work on developing a nuclear bomb, Administration and Congressional sources said today.

Polarization in Chicago
LEAD: To the Editor:


HILL STATIONS OF THE RAJ
LEAD: WHEN I THINK OF my childhood in north India, it is always summer: the days stretch endlessly, the sun is always at its zenith, turning the sky white with heat like a sheet of tin, the earth yellow and cracked with aridity.
Dust storms sweep in from the desert, burying whole cities under a suffocating yellow pelt.


Review; DANCE: DANNY BURACZESKI COMPANY AND JAZZ
LEAD: THE members of Jazzdance/The Danny Buraczeski Dance Company looked especially beguiling Wednesday night at the Marymount Manhattan Theater when they were dancing merrily away to recordings by such jazz musicians as Dave Brubeck, Lionel Hampton, Benny Goodman and Buddy Rich.


Review; MUSIC: THE KRONOS QUARTET AT WEILL HALL
LEAD: DESPITE their Haight-Ashbury cum Jetsons fashions and punk-rock hairdos, the members of the Kronos Quartet have assembled an ensemble of exceptional seriousness and importance.
They play all kinds of contemporary music - from Ornette Coleman to Terry Riley to John Cage and beyond - and play it with passion and style: their interpretations are alert, adaptive and altogether expert.


Review; MUSIC: LA GRAN SCENA
LEAD: ONE need not be a connoisseur of opera to enjoy the antic musical comedy of La Gran Scena Opera Company, the all-male operatic troupe that settled into the Ballroom on Tuesday evening (253 West 28th St.) for a 2 1/2-week engagement.


Washington Accord on ABM Issue Is Doubted
LEAD: A senior Pentagon official said today that prospects had dimmed for a compromise between the Administration and the Congress on the interpretation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.


CONTRAS ON THE DEFENSIVE IN THE WASHINGTON WARS
LEAD: IN the more than five years that the United States has been sending secret shipments of uniforms, guns and ammunition to fight the Sandinista Government, last week was one of the bleakest times for the Nicaraguan contra rebels .


FINDING THE RIGHT HINGE TO USE WHEN ADDING CABINETS
LEAD: IN remodeling cabinets, or building new ones, there is a wide range of hinges one can use for mounting the doors on these cabinets.
Aside from hinges that vary in finish and decorative design, they also vary in how they are mounted.
This in turn depends on the kind of doors to be hung.


HIS TOUGHEST CHALLENGE YET
LEAD: WHEN Sumner M. Redstone made his regular trip to Los Angeles late last year, he ran into his old pal Larry Tisch in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel.
Mr.
Redstone wondered what the new boss of CBS thought about his idea of putting together a group to make a bid for Viacom International, already the object of a management buyout.


NORHTEAST JOURNAL
LEAD:  A Tight Fit In Maryland


Prague
LEAD: To the Editor: In regard to the museums in Prague, there is one that was left out: that of the Jewish museum that Hitler arranged to have established, after winning World War II, of a people who no longer existed.
He did manage to kill six million.
He confiscated from the Jewish people in the conquered countries of Europe, art, sculpture, tapestries, religious articles and hundreds of musical instruments, which now hang in this museum.


DANCE
LEAD:  ROAD TO THE STAMPING GROUND  Nederlands Dans Theater.
Choreography by Jiri Kylian.
Home Vision.  60 minutes. $39.95.


BOSTON AIMS FOR EXTENSIVE WATER TRANSIT BY '88
LEAD: This began as a maritime city, but for years Boston turned away from its waterfront, treating its harbor, unused and largely inaccessible at the center of a bustling, crowded metropolis, like the hole in the doughnut.


Home Is Here, Not Russia
LEAD: Alexander Altman, age 15, stayed in America last month when his parents and 4-year-old brother went home to Russia.
Their separation was as anguished, but not as angry, as the Polovchak family's seven years ago.
Then, 12-year-old Walter Polovchak ran away and sought asylum to avoid going back to the


SMALL BUT ABUNDANT SIGNS OF SPRING
LEAD: WHEN spring officially arrives on Friday, it might be with grim skies, chilling winds and worse.
Nevertheless, naturalists and others attuned to the seasons say there will be abundant evidence - including honks, heliotropes and hairy sofas -that spring is coming and bringing plenty of lively activity.


BUSINESS
LEAD:  WINNING AT WORK, VOL. I  Karl Lorimar Home Video.  60 Minutes. $29.95.


American Express Tries a Credit Line
LEAD: After many years of demanding payment more or less immediately, the American Express Company has seen the possibilities in revolving credit.
And its announcement last week of a new credit card, just like a bank card in most respects but carrying a lower rate, has given the consumer-credit market a jolt.


Crack Murder: A Detective Story
LEAD: What a story (''Crack Murder: A Detective Story,'' by Ron Rosenbaum, Feb. 15)!
Halfway through the article (at the point that Detective Albert E. Cachie is talking about Mr. Marshall, ''the gentleman who lived on the ground floor with the broken lock . . . in a building overlooking the street where Halfback was first shot'') and hanging on every word,


Citizens Join Experts in Assessing Toxic Risks
LEAD: A three-day conference on the risks of living near chemical plants along the Kanawha River has aroused a new debate over how much chemical companies should do to assure the safety of their communities.


Numbers Change For Democrats, And for the G.O.P.
LEAD: Former Gov.
Bruce Babbitt of Arizona last week become the second major contender for the Democratic nomination for President formally to enter the race.
He offered himself in a manner designed to set himself apart from his one declared rival, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and the rest of the pack, and in a way reflective of his intense, thoughtful style.


Move to Block Election Fails
LEAD: Federal District Judge Michael Mihm has declined to block the April 7 municipal election here despite allegations that Peoria's electoral process discriminates against blacks.
He denied a request Friday by Timothy J. Cassidy, a candidate for the Park Board, for an injunction postponing the election.


ATLANTA
LEAD: Sometimes, amid the towers of glass and steel, it is hard to find the gracious, gentle side of Atlanta.
Then comes spring, and the air softens and the city erupts in flowers.
And suddenly Atlanta seems the best of the old and the new South, a glorious synthesis of gardeners and builders.


DEATH TOLL IN FERRY DISASTER COULD BE 200, BELGIUM SAYS
LEAD: More than 200 people may have died in the March 6 British ferry disaster, the Belgian Transport Minister said today.
But the ship's owners said the toll was still 134.


DePaul Gets Edge Against Redmen
LEAD: When St.
John's plays DePaul at the Horizon Sunday in the second round of the Midwest Regional, the Redmen will be facing quite a home-court disadvantage.


'TRACERS' AT PURCHSE
LEAD: BECAUSE professional theater is in short supply in the county, it follows that when a production as potent as the much-acclaimed ''Tracers'' passes through - even if it is just for one night - attention must be paid.


THE PHONY WAR
LEAD: The truth about narcotics in the United States is not that this country has lost the war against drugs.
It is that we never really decided to get into it.


WHAT'S NEW IN THE ANIMAL BUSINESS
LEAD: THERE is no disputing that animals contribute a lot more to society than companionship and food.
They sniff for bombs, gas leaks, and drugs; they catch criminals and serve as eyes for the blind and ears for the deaf; they rescue earthquake and avalanche victims.


Dr. Linda Hertzberg Planning to Wed
LEAD: Rabbi and Mrs.
Arthur Hertzberg of Englewood, N.J., and Hanover, N.H., have announced the engagement of their daughter Dr.
Linda Beth Hertzberg to Dr.
David Ira Merzel, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Oscar Merzel of Rockaway Park, Queens.


Corrections
LEAD: Because of a mechanical error, an article last Sunday about the wedding of Elizabeth Anne Donovan and Edward A. Nolan Jr. omitted the location and the name of the clergyman.


BLOCKER'S STYLE JUST FINE NOW FOR TEXAS-EL PASO
LEAD: The first impression was shaky.
Chris Blocker, a 6-foot-5-inch junior-college player who was being recruited by the University of Texas at El Paso, said the first impression is misleading.


THEIR PROPER SEASONS: Sometimes It All Comes Together
LEAD: I'd never got it by design -the best time in the best place.
Fog defeated our New Year's Eve in Venice.
Years ago, Bastille Day in Paris featured a truly awful girl I'd known at Smith snubbing us in the Ambassador's receiving line.
The azaleas on the Spanish Steps in all that sun made me long for home, for the chill but satisfying end of Lent and the reward of a walleyed chocolate bunny.


LOVE TRIANGLE IN 'WITCHBOARD'
THE one time I tried to use a Ouija board, the marker refused to move, and I tossed it aside after a few seconds. ''Witchboard'' convinces me I was right.
Any movie that features a Ouija - or ''witchboard,'' as we're told it's sometimes called - as a way for spirits to enter this world ought to offer the audience some guesswork.
But the first feature written and directed by Kevin S. Tenney is as moribund as any Ouija I've ever seen.
There is a romantic triangle in the background: Brandon, a rich, handsome, unnaturally blond young man; Linda, his former lover, and Jim, Brandon's former best friend who happens to be Linda's present lover.
In the greatest stretch of imagination the film calls for, we're asked to believe Jim did not steal Linda away from Brandon.
Right.
When Brandon brings his Ouija to a party at Jim and Linda's, they tune in a mass murderer named Malfeitor (''evildoer'' in Portuguese, the film says) disguised as the spirit of a little boy killed 30 years before.
Malfeitor possesses Linda until the two men in her life end their feud and team up to save her.
This film is so cheaply made that its grand special effect has a knife fly through the kitchen, and a conveniently open bottle of ketchup tips itself over; the ketchup drips on the knife to resemble blood, which the astute Linda takes as a bad sign.
The dialogue is so unreal that when Jim tells his landlady (in a cameo by Rose Marie; I don't know why) to call an ambulance for Linda, instead of running for the phone she stops to ask, ''Why, what happened?'' The plot is so predictable that when the Ouija slowly spells out its answers, the scenes are less suspenseful than ''Wheel of Fortune.''
One good thing I can say about ''Witchboard,'' which opened Friday at the Criterion Center and other theaters: Todd Allen as Jim doesn't overact. (Steven Nichols, as Brandon, and Tawny Kitaen, as Linda, do.) The very best I can say is that ''Witchboard'' should encourage struggling film makers.
Watch it and think, ''I can do better than that!''

Gotti and Friends Found Not Guilty
LEAD: John Gotti, the man painted by Federal prosecutors as the most powerful criminal in the nation's most powerful organized crime family, walked out of Federal court in Brooklyn a free man last week.


TAKE ME TO THE BEACH: A Mediterranean Resort on the Pacific
LEAD: Southern California, like few regions of the world, boasts an eclectic menu of beaches.
Each has a distinct personality: athletic beaches in Malibu, where surfers ride tubular waves; singles beaches, like the Marina Peninsula in Venice, a close replica of the scene at Fire Island; parklike beaches in San


THEIR PROPER SEASONS: Sundays in the Park with Louis XIV
LEAD: It started with water -water flowing, springing, cascading, rushing in a thousand ways into a thousand shapes - a permanent spectacle of light and movement that delighted and amazed visitors.
Even before Louis XIV built his great palace at Versailles, when only a hunting lodge stood at the top of the hill, the gardens and their fountains had already taken shape.


A NASTY, EMPTY, DANGEROUS WORD
LEAD: MODERN literature grew up with nationalism and with assorted epochal quackeries in which it participated deeply.
We like to imagine literature as the still, small voice of human conscience.
It is that only rarely, however.
Actively and passively, it has always borne along pernicious ideas.
Our laws protecting expression are meant to disperse power, to hedge in the potency of enthusiasms and hypotheses by assuring them critics and competitors.


HOW TO AVOID TUNNEL VISION
LEAD: A LAMENTABLE byproduct of today's information glut is a narrowing of vision.
At first glance, such a consequence seems quite the opposite of what one would expect.
More information should presumably present more opportunities for broader vision and understanding.
Yet the sheer volume of the data amassed makes almost inevitable the reduction of our focus to what is in the end a very narrow endeavor.


Outdoors; Pursuing Quail in Mexico's Wild Setting
LEAD: SITTING in a deserted hotel lobby under a faded but haughty oil portrait of Francisco de Montejo, the conqueror of Yucatan, I munched away at a 4 A.M. box breakfast of raisin buns and a croissant stuffed with salty Mexican ham.
I was at first puzzled by a noise drifting through the latticed, wrought-iron doors of the lobby.


Travel Advisory; New England Seacoast, Oregon Wine Country
LEAD: Whales, Birds And the Story Of Seafaring


Bookshelf; BOOKSHELF
LEAD: Additional titles of interest:
THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS AT THE WATERWORKS.
By Joanna Cole.
Illustrated by Bruce Degen.
Scholastic. $12.95. (Ages 8 to 12) Ms.
Frizzle may be the strangest teacher in the school, but her class trip to the waterworks is a model of surprising, inventive, accurate and very funny science writing.


Patricia Brown and Roger Cohn to Wed
LEAD: The engagement of Patricia Leigh Brown to Roger Guy Cohn, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Martin B. Cohn of Rockville Centre, L.I., has been announced by Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas J. McGreevy of Santa Fe, N.M., stepfather and mother of the future bride.
A May wedding is planned.


Off Broadway
LEAD: Some of the biggest names in New York real estate have been shuffling sites and assembling land north of Times Square.
They are preparing for the future office buildings that are expected to tower over and illuminate the area known as Midtown West with blinking, colorful signs.
Following in the wake are smaller players, who are also undertaking Class


The Contras and the Drain
LEAD: Where now in Nicaragua?
The President's crusade for the contras has suffered another, perhaps mortal blow.
He has to be wondering what policy to pursue if the rebel forces collapse.


'Significant Sales' Pace the Market
LEAD: AN elegant town house at 163 East 64th Street in Manhattan sold for $650,000 in 1977, $1.75 million in 1980, $2.5 million in 1982 and $4 million last year.


Catherine Mann Weds
LEAD: Catherine Marie Mann, a daughter of Barbara Mann of Clifton Springs, N.Y., and Charles A. Mann of Webster, N.Y., was married yesterday to Jacob Nielsen-Kolding, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Jorgen Nielsen-Kolding of Reigate, Surrey, England.
The Rev.
David Bonin performed the ceremony at St.
Anne's Roman Catholic Church in Palmyra, N.Y.


Prague
LEAD: To the Editor: The articles on Prague brought attention to an extraordinary city.
But you've touched only a bit more than the surface.

The Old Days At '21'
LEAD: The fact that an article about the ''21'' Club appeared in The New York Times Magazine indicates that it is no mere restaurant (''Making Old '21' Young,'' Feb. 15).
It had its own special ambiance, a wonderful bar, fantastic clientele, professional staff, not just the Kriendlers, Jerry Berns and Walter, but also Fred (who led you up the stairs) and Tino and Terry Guinan, and, no, upstairs was not Siberia.


LISBON'S NEW TAVARES

TOUGH DECISIONS ALONG A NEW ETHICAL FRONTIER
LEAD: AMERICANS are notoriously skeptical of busybodies and of government telling them what to do.

JUTLAND OF THE VIKINGS
LEAD: MY HOME IS Jutland, and when a stranger notes my unusual accent and asks me what part of Denmark I come from, I have a stock answer.
I am a West Jute, I say - from a little farther west than most.
That, of course, requires elaboration.
I am English, I explain, but from the ancient Danelaw, the northern half of England that was settled by the Danes about 850, where the Danish language and Danish laws held sway for over 200 years, and still, to this day, are more in evidence than its inhabitants know.


MIKE NICHOLS MEETS THE BARD AND IT'S LYRICAL
LEAD: In the usual winding journey before a musical reaches Broadway or environs, ''Stand-Up Shakespeare'' became a big-time theatrical possibility because of a New Year's Eve party at Robert Duvall's in 1983 and a Christmas Eve party given by Jeremy Irons in 1984.
Fortune hovered over both parties.
At the first, the creator and composer of the current show decided to join forces, and at the second, the director who made it all possible appeared.


PLENTY OF PIZAZZ IN DODGE SPORTS MODEL

ZONING IS VITAL TO QUALITY OF LIFE

Turkey
LEAD: To the Editor: I object to the tenor and substance of the description of the holocaust at Izmir (Smyrna) in 1922 in ''Where History's Sweep Conquers the Visitor'' by Frederic Raphael (Travel, Jan. 18).

What Art Is
LEAD: To the Editor:


By Paul Scott. Edited by Shelley C. Reece. 226 pp. New York: William Morrow &amp; Company. $15.95.  AFTER THE RAJ  British Novels of India Since 1947. By David Rubin. 197 pp. Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England. $19.95.    THE main outlines of Paul Scott's literary life are clear but much about the man and his achievement remains shadowy. Born in London in 1920 and educated at Winchmore Hill Collegiate School, Scott served in the army in India during the Second World War and then until 1960 worked in publishing and as director of the David Higham Agency, literary agents, writing plays and half a dozen novels after hours. Success came gradually between 1966 and 1975, as each of the volumes that would become the panoramic ''Raj Quartet'' appeared. A related novel, the splendid ''Staying On,'' won the prestigious Booker Prize in 1977. Scott died a year later, achieving extraordinary fame posthumously when millions of people watched ''The Raj Quartet'' on television during 1984-85 as ''The Jewel in the Crown,'' the first title in the series, and have bought the ''Raj'' novels ever since.   As yet though, there is no biography and only a handful of critical studies, the most useful of which have been those by Patrick Swinden, a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester. In this context, readers might well look to the 11 essays in ''On Writing and the Novel'' to learn more about Scott as a man and writer. But, with the notable exception of a fine piece called ''Method: The Mystery and the Mechanics'' and a subtle reflection on Britain and India after E. M. Forster, they are likely to be disappointed.   Scott was a reluctant essayist and nearly all the selections printed here were given as invitational talks at literary luncheons, summer school writers' conferences and dozens of stops on government-sponsored speaking tours of India. More often than not, his tone for the occasion is a kind of genial ''we're all in this together and good luck to us.'' Gentle jests about food and the weather mix with agreeable but platitudinous comments on the craft of fiction: ''Writing is a discovery . . . a vitamin, not a drug''; ''Imagination is not enough. Knowledge is necessary. And an experience of the oddity of life''; ''Literature must always be alive - to the past, to the present, to the opportunities of the future''; authors, rather like Tennessee Williams's ''poor Blanche Dubois,'' ''depend a great deal for well-being and peace of mind on the unconscious courtesy of strangers.''   About fiction in general and about other people's work, Scott is almost never illuminating; the same favorite quotations from Hazlitt, James or Lionel Trilling appear frequently with no glosses, and jovial anecdotes about Tolstoy and Turgenev, Shaw and Conrad stand in for analysis. Yet happily, Scott's concrete observations about his own work are always absorbing and revelatory. Every admirer of ''The Raj Quartet'' will treasure his explanation of how from glimpses of a girl in Calcutta, from reading about a criminal assault in Amritsar and the 1919 riots in the Punjab and from a long process of culling and reflecting, he ''discovered'' Daphne Manners and wrote the unforgettable description of the running girl that opens ''The Jewel in the Crown.''   Scott (in the essay on ''The Mystery and the Mechanics'') formulates his esthetic of the novel as a kind of dramatic poem built on expanding images and multiple points of view, and at the same time reveals one of his cardinal principles of characterization: that individual human action is often subject to the processes of an ienflamed collective conscience. Unlike so many of his bland observations about other writers and fiction in general, Scott's description of his own procedures has a contagious excitement and an interest that comes of a justified pride in obliged creation.   ''The image of the girl running didn't peter out -the veins of possible exploration became intensely complex. When you feel this happening you are at the heart of your mystery. Extracting the ore is the mechanical side of the operation, and to extract it you stand away from the image and subject it to a kind of bombardment, as if you're trying to split an atom. You bombard it with your knowledge, your experience, and your imagination, your creative impulse. If you're lucky you have a beautiful explosion.''   Something of the same purposive tension comes across in Scott's essay ''After Marabar: Britain and India, a Post-Fosterian View.'' Here the source of energy comes from his having been challenged by two vital and pointed questions about his work. ''Why,'' an Englishwoman asked, ''does he have to revive all that old bitterness?'' ''Tell me,'' queried an Indian, ''what you think you have to offer the world today that might be of value?'' The two blunt questions seemed inevitably to lead to a third: Didn't Forster in ''A Passage to India'' cover the subject satisfactorily enough?   Scott's answer comes out not in serial and conclusive form but as a textured meditation on some of the issues pertaining to all the questions. By reviving the old bitterness he hopes to combat present ignorance and prejudice and to forge a new understanding. But modesty requires him to admit that perhaps the most valuable thing he has to offer is the uncertainty of having anything of value to offer at all. In Scott's view, this mix of skepticism and idealism can best be expressed in that most valuable of dialectical forms, the novel. Fiction is a moral dialogue between writer and reader that invites not acquiescence but a ''creative and critical response to the life it depicts.'' Forster created such a dialogue, and so - Scott hopes - did he. In his opinion, however, ''The Raj Quartet'' is hardly a grand philosophical and prophetic set of novels, but rather a kind of elegiac saga that tries to capture ''the melancholy arising from too long an exile, from too far a removal from the source of dynamic native experience.''   For these views, and many others, Scott is the hero of David Rubin's study, ''After the Raj: British Novels of India Since 1947.'' Mr. Rubin, a novelist and visiting professor of modern Indian languages at Columbia University, begins with a brief survey of British fiction set in India before independence and skillfully identifies its dominant modes and myths. Then, following a chapter on Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, he turns to Scott, who in his judgment produced by far the best novels about the relations between the British and the Indians ''not only since Independence but since the very beginning of such fiction.''   Mr. Rubin's case for Scott's predominance in the tradition rests on a sure-footed, informative account of the narrative thrust, varied characterization and thematic coherence of ''The Raj Quartet.'' In Mr. Rubin's view, Scott's immense spectacle of the last years of the British in India is unified by the dramatic and complex working out of a metaphor that joins and illuminates public and private history.   What Scott has done is to make sexual excess, deviation and aberration a near-inevitable correlative of the imperial process; the greed, and the moral and ethical blindness that inspire and sustain colonialism in the sphere of public action are accompanied by a parallel degeneration in the private sphere, where sexual problems, violence and confusion reveal and symbolize the same moral failure. MR. RUBIN'S account of ''The Raj Quartet'' is often eloquent and insightful, but in his eagerness to support the case for Scott's supremacy, he continually finds it necessary to make claims for the importance of the four novels that are likely to strike many readers as strained to the point of implausibility. Because of the prominence of ''A Passage to India'' in the history of his subject, Mr. Rubin keeps whittling away at Forster's stature. While admitting his genius for physical and emotional evocation and for caricature, he finds his perceptions of India and the Indians only narrow and stereotypical, and too easily dismisses Forster's expansive mysteries as mere mystifications. Mr. Rubin (unlike Scott) resists the imaginative sweep of Forster's vision in which mysticism and comedy are inseparable; and he has virtually nothing to say about the brilliant originality and suppleness of Forster's style.   Then, too, in order to elevate Scott as both a chronicler of modern history and a psychological realist, Mr. Rubin unconvincingly compares him with Tolstoy and Proust. But the more persuasive comparison - mutatis mutandis - would be with Trollope, whose Barchester and Palliser novels offer some of the same pleasures of vivid storytelling, memorable characterization and shrewd social analysis that can make Scott's bleak panorama so engrossing. As Webster Schott once put it in these pages, ''The Raj Quartet'' is one of the longest, most successfully rendered works of 19th-century fiction written in the 20th century. Scott was probably pleased by that, and so should we be.

CONCERT: PHILHARMONIC OFFERS 'WAR REQUIEM'
LEAD: A QUARTER of a century has passed since Benjamin Britten's ''War Requiem'' had it first performance in Coventry's rebuilt cathedral, which Nazi fire bombs had destroyed in 1940.
In a time when so few new scores survive much beyond birth, Britten's solemn and deeply grieving work is still with us.
There are good reasons why, of course.

BROADWAY
LEAD: THE Roundabout Theater Company is celebrating its coming-of-age 21st birthday this year with a nice coup: the 20th-anniversary production of ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.'' And the Tony Award-winning play by Tom Stoppard is only part of the news.
The rest is in the cast, with a trio of stars named John Wood and John Rubinstein, both Tony winners, and Stephen Lang, who was featured in the recent Broadway production of ''Death of a Salesman.


THE EVENING HOURS
LEAD: CATHERINE DENEUVE came to 14th Street and created the biggest stir since S. Klein opened in 1910.
The reason was a benefit party Wednesday night at Nell's for Very Special Artists, an organization founded by Jean Kennedy Smith that provides opportunities in the arts for people with disabilities.
Parfums Phenix, a subsidiary of Avon, underwrote the evening, which raised $100,000 for the organization, but the fact that the company happens to make the film star's fragrance, Deneuve, was played down.

No Mandate, No Legitimate Power
LEAD: To appreciate the economic and political crisis afflicting Brazil, recall recent history, and the folly of compromising on democracy.
The exercise perhaps also offers lessons for South Korea, now planning its own transition from military to democratic rule.

TRUSTEE TO OVERSEE 2 UNIONS
LEAD: A former Federal prosecutor was named yesterday as the trustee to supervise two construction unions that the Government accused of falling under the influence of the Mafia.

Why Cuomo Convention Draft Is Unlikely
LEAD: To the Editor:


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: A Washington dispatch yesterday about the Environmental Protection Agency's program for financing asbestos removal in schools omitted a reason some funds will not be distributed until mid-June.

Coach Is Dismissed
LEAD: Mike Hanks, who refused to resign as South Alabama's basketball coach with two years remaining in his contract and refused other options offered by the school, was dismissed by Joe Gottfried, the school's athletic director.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS

For one thing, they are worried about a sudden loss of investor confidence if the scandals turn out to be even more widespread than it appears.

Democracy's Antibodies
LEAD: The American political system has been sorely tested in recent months.

SEEING THE EVOLUTION OF NEW YORK CITY THROUGH ARTISTS' EYES
LEAD: The city of New York, a collection of islands weighted with concrete in a broad bay, has never been a place where the artist could get away from it all.
Quite the contrary, it is a place where the artist comes, looks and depicts.
Each artist views the metropolis with different eyes, and lucky New Yorkers have abundant opportunities to see these perceptions and match them with their own in the city's museums and galleries.

La Mediterranee, on Second Avenue at 50th Street, is about as voguish as spats - but considerably more comfortable.


SHUBERT SIGNS 'PHANTOM OF THE OPERA'
LEAD: The Shubert Organization this week captured one of the few prizes left in a boom-or-bust industry when a British producer, Cameron Mackintosh, agreed to bring ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' the biggest hit of the London season, to the Majestic Theater, a Shubert-owned house, in November.

OPERA: 'I DUE LITIGANTI,' AN 18TH-CENTURY STORY
LEAD: MOZART'S great operatic decade fell 200 years ago, and though hardly any operas but Mozart's own survived it, a handful of others are known to us by name either because Mozart wrote arias to be inserted into them or because of a little inside joke in ''Don Giovanni.'' At the Don's party, the orchestra strikes up bits from rival operas popular in Vienna.

Penal Reformer Of Another Sort
LEAD: On occasion, something happens that reminds Coach Bob Timmons of 1972, when all 57 members of his University of Kansas track team were initially barred from the N.C.A.A. championships because of infractions he had supposedly committed several years earlier.
When such a reminder comes along, Timmons does what he did back then:


British Jobless Decline
LEAD: The number of Britons unemployed registered the biggest fall on record in February, raising Government hopes that it would drop below the symbolic three million mark in time for a summer or autumn election.


U.S. Priest, Freed From Transkei, Tells of Torture

SEMIFINALISTS REFLECT A SEASON
LEAD: While the Midwest Regional is no tougher or weaker than any of the other three, it certainly is a puzzling bracket to figure.
In a sense, this semifinal field of Indiana, Duke, Louisiana State and DePaul could be called a microcosm of the entire college basketball season itself: no dominant team, a predominance of outstanding guards and small forwards, and no one player who can singlehandedly carry his team to New


STAGE: 'LADY MOONSONG,' FAIRY TALE FOR GROWN-UPS
LEAD: WHEN we first meet Lady Moonsong (Mia Dillon) and her fisherman husband, Mr.
Monsoon (Reed Birney), in Alice Eve Cohen's theatrical collage of mythology, poetry and music, they are exchanging alliterative exclamations while making love wrapped in a blanket.
The scene is the happiest moment in a cautionary fable that augments the Grimm fairy tale ''The Three Wishes'' with plot elements borrowed from ''Macbeth'' and the Adam and


POP AND JAZZ GUIDE
LEAD: Carmen McRae, Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street (758-2272).
The veteran jazz singer's formidable intelligence is matched by an impeccable taste in songs and a way of bending phrases and shading notes that makes whatever she touches a penetrating exploration of life's more bitter truths.
Full of autobiographical overtones, her tough-tender ''Sophisticated Lady'' is a dried-eyed, moving reflection on the pleasures and perils of the jazz life.


A MUSICAL PASTICHE IN TRIBUTE TO JULE STYNE
LEAD: THIS being a pledge period for public television, the normal schedule is largely pre-empted for a slew of ''golden oldies'' offerings that presumably inspire viewers to rush to their mailboxes with support dollars.
We have had clips from old movies in tributes to James Stewart and Vincente Minnelli.

Japan Bond Plan
LEAD: The Japanese Ministry of Finance has approved a plan to increase the participation of foreign banks and securities firms in 10-year government bond sales.
In Japan, the 10-year bonds are allocated among banks and securities firms rather than sold through competitive bidding.
Although the foreign allocation remains small, it was a step to placate American Government officials and securities dealers who have complained that they are denied access to the Japanese market while Japanese firms compete freely in the American market.

LEAD: A report on Wednesday in the Briefing column of the Washington Talk page, about speculation on Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, misstated Arizona's means of filling any Congressional vacancy.
The seat is always filled by election, never by gubernatorial appointment.


5 VIEWS OF IMMIGRANT LIVES
LEAD: The American experience is the immigrant experience, of course; we know that already.
Nonetheless, ''The American Promise: Wanting It All,'' on Channel 4 at 9:30 P.M. tomorrow, still has something to say.
It makes up an attractive 30 minutes.
The program, one of a series, as the host, John Chancellor, says, about ''you and me and our country,'' looks at members of five immigrant families - Russian, Mexican, Japanese, Vietnamese and Armenian.


New Phase To Trading Inquiry
LEAD: A few defense lawyers - mostly with clients facing similar charges -worried yesterday that the guilty pleas by Boyd L. Jefferies mark a new phase in the investigation into stock-trading practices.
For as Mr.
Jefferies himself emphasized, he was not part of the insider-trading schemes that have been the main focus of the Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry.


AUCTIONS
LEAD: FROM now through Easter, while New York auction houses are relatively quiet, auctiongoers have a choice of traveling, telephoning or sending letters in order to place bids at sales elsewhere.

Jackson Condemns 'Economic Violence' as He Opens Headquarters in Iowa

A year from now, the system will be reviewed again.


Official Upheld At Dynamics
LEAD: The General Dynamics Corporation announced yesterday that a Defense Department appeals board had unanimously ruled that Lester Crown, executive vice president of the company and a member of its board, could keep his top-level security clearance.


The Fortress-America Myth
LEAD: In the third century B.C., the Emperor Shih Huang Ti began building a wall along China's northwest border to seal off the Middle Kingdom from marauding nomads, and 500 years later Hadrian tried the same approach in England.
A thousand years later, the same solution was invoked by the lords of medieval Europe to keep out bandits and armies.


Who Says Old People Have to Move Over; 'Don't Save Me Again'
LEAD: To the Editor:


Backstop Forefront
LEAD: If catching is the most arduous job in baseball, then let's hear it for 39-year-old Bob Boone.

Women See Rise in Job Bias
LEAD: Women's perception of job discrimination has grown despite recent improvements in their prospects for employment but men's opinions of the problem have not changed significantly, according to a recent Gallup Poll.

FILM: WHOOPI GOLDBERG IN 'BURGLAR'
LEAD: THE further the screen version of ''The Color Purple'' recedes into history, the better it looks, especially Steven Spielberg's presentation of Whoopi Goldberg, the star of her first film in what became an Oscar-nominated performance.


RHODEN UNCERTAIN FOR START IN OPENER
LEAD: In the past, there was only the mere suggestion that Rick Rhoden was going to be the Yankees' starting pitcher on opening day April 6 in Detroit.
But today, in comments that were almost off-handed, Manager Lou Piniella made it official.


Youth Guilty in Deaths Of TV Actor's Parents
LEAD: A 19-year-old janitor was convicted here today in the deaths of the parents of Patrick Duffy, a television actor.


RESTAURANTS
LEAD: UPON entering East, the handsome, countrified Japanese restaurant on the Upper East Side, you are stopped at an alcove of little wooden lockers and asked to remove your shoes.
You are then ushered into the dining room, which has two sections of low-slung tables separated by a center aisle that is as shiny as a new bowling lane from constant sock buffing.

Shelter Animals Make Poor Research Subjects; Appropriate Models
LEAD:  To the Editor:
Your Feb. 1 editorial Topics item about the use of pound animals in research contained errors that should be corrected.

NEWS SUMMARY: SATURDAY, MARCH 21, 1987
LEAD:  International 2-5, 28  Labor unrest in Yugoslavia has erupted recently.

DRUG SMUGGLERS: NEW BREED OF ETHNIC GANGS

IOWA ST. THREATENS IOWA'S BID FOR 10TH

DEMOCRATS MAINTAIN HOLD ON SOUTH
LEAD: In Washington, among those who formulate political strategy, the two-party South is considered a reality.


AIDS Strategies
LEAD:  To the Editor:
Your March 1 editorial on acquired immune deficiency syndrome advocates wider counseling and testing, public education and treatment of intravenous drug abusers.
This is no ''new strategy against AIDS.'' These were all part of the strategy devised last June at a meeting of senior U.S.


INDIANA HOLDS OFF BLUE DEVILS' RALLY
LEAD: Duke was willing and, for spots in the game, the Blue Devils were able.
But Indiana, relying on superior strength and quickness inside, was simply too powerful and defeated Duke, 88-82, in a Midwest Regional semifinal tonight.


Laurie Ostroff to Wed Roger Landau in June
LEAD: Herbert Ostroff of Verona, N.J., has announced the engagement of his daughter, Laurie Jill Ostroff, to Roger Landau, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Walter Landau of Teaneck, N.J.
The wedding is to be in June.


A SENSE OF EASE
LEAD: The starch has gone out of men's wear this season, along with much of the constraint.
In keeping with a time when dress tends to relax, the cut and feel of clothing have softened.
This spring, an unlined jacket, a loose sport shirt or oversized cardigan suggests a comfortable, lived-in gentility.


NEW JERSEY GUIDE
LEAD: JAZZ IN ENGLEWOOD Billy Taylor, the jazz pianist (and composer, arranger, conductor, actor, author, teacher and lecturer) will perform with his jazz trio Friday evening at John Harms Center for the Arts in Englewood.


Satellite for Indonesia Is Launched by NASA
LEAD: A $43 million communications satellite originally delayed because of the Challenger disaster has become the space agency's seventh straight successful launching.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: The lavish pictorial display in Mary C. Henderson's THEATER IN AMERICA: 200 Years of Plays, Players, and Productions (foreword by Joseph Papp; Abrams, $45) should not deter one from reading the text, for this is both a book for browsers and a valuable and relatively concise history.
Ms.
Henderson, formerly the curator of the Theater Collection at the Museum of the City of New York, has the curiosity of a bibliophile as well as the enthusiasm of someone who loves the stage.


AS PESTICIDES FADE, EAGLES RETURN TO ST. LAWRENCE
LEAD: Bald eagles, recovering from the effects of pesticide contamination and human predators, are reclaiming the St.
Lawrence River as an important winter habitat.


ARCH OBOLER, WROTE THRILLERS FOR RADIO IN 1930'S AND 40'S

SHIITE RADICALS: RISING WRATH JARS THE MIDEAST

Ernest Levi of Kendall, Fla., of the engagement of their daughter Michelle Anne Levi to Scott Michael Sarason, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
David Sarason of Great Neck, L.I.


GETAWAY CLOTHES
LEAD: By the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, the symptoms are usually in full evidence.
Suits are replaced by blazers and slacks, shoes are more likely to be slip-on than laced and, as the afternoon wears on, tie knots tend to slide farther and farther down shirt fronts.


COUNTRIES MOVING IN BATTLE ON AIDS
LEAD: As the number of AIDS cases grows around the world, scores of nations outside the already highly infected areas of North America and Western Europe are beginning to gear up for a battle against what is increasingly being described as a modern-day plague, according to World Health Organization officials.


THE WOMAN WITHOUT A FIRST NAME
LEAD: I MET Jim's wife at a picnic.
She had a college degree, a big house, a diamond wedding ring and two little pigtailed daughters.
What she didn't have was a first name. ''Hi, I'm Jim's wife,'' she said as an introduction. ''Hi, I didn't catch your first name.'' ''Just call me Jim's wife - everybody does,'' she said with a dismissing wave of her hand.


CASINOS WIDEN RECRUITING DRIVE
LEAD: TRUMP'S CASTLE Hotel-Casino opened in June 1985, and the following August employment in the casino industry here hit a peak of 41,000.
Since then, it has hovered between 41,000 and 37,000, depending on the season.

Hugo J. Gelardin of New York and Quogue, L.I., of the engagement of their daughter Nicole Gelardin to A.Mark Berlin Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Arnold M. Berlin of Winnetka, Ill.
A May wedding is planned.


CITYSCAPE: Gimbels; A 'Big Store' Designed to Educate Bargain Hunters
LEAD: IN an era of boutiques and mixed-use buildings, of luxury goods and marketing for the affluent, the basic, unadorned department store is something of a dinosaur - and the Gimbels building, on Avenue of the Americas just south of Herald Square, is on the verge of being fossilized.


KY. WESLEYAN TAKES 5TH TITLE
LEAD: MEN'S DIVISION II-III


Headliners; A Fall
LEAD: The trail of toppling dominoes in the Government's investigations of Wall Street reached the West Coast last week.

TEXAS EDGES RUTGERS IN EAST REGIONAL, 85-77
LEAD: The towering presence of a 6-foot- 8-inch freshman, who was 6 inches taller than any other woman on the court and who blocked shots while hardly leaving her feet, helped destroy Rutgers's hopes for an N.C.A.A. basketball title today.


Headliners; A Dismissal
LEAD: As Interior Secretary from 1981 to 1983, James Watt, among other things, represented the Government in its dealings with Indians.
Mr.
Watt, a lawyer, has since turned to representing Indians in their dealings with the Government.
It has not been the smoothest of transitions.
One client, the Crow Indians of Montana, dismissed Mr.


PENALIZED PLAYERS LEARN THROUGH SERVICE
LEAD: SOME of the two dozen teen-agers, Mona Riscoe recalled, ''knew his name and some knew who he was after he began to talk.
Some didn't know about him as a baseball player but were aware of the cocaine trials and who he was because of that.''


GREAT MOMENTS (WELL, ALMOST) IN L.I. HISTORY
LEAD: NINETEEN EIGHTY-SEVEN is the 200th anniversary of the drafting of the Constitution, an event that will inspire a host of celebrations, conferences and symposiums across the nation.
This is as it should be, of course, but as far as I can see there will be a dearth of such activities on Long Island.


Review; MUSIC: NEW YORK WOODWIND QUINTET
LEAD: COMMISSIONING new works is one important function of our well-established chamber ensembles, but a certain first-performance syndrome sometimes keeps the new pieces, even the good ones, from being taken up by groups who didn't commission them.
The New York Woodwind Quintet therefore earns double credit for bringing to Merkin Hall Monday night a quarter-hour piece called ''Just Time,'' composed by Martin Bresnick for the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival, where the Taft


Correction
LEAD: A report on March 15, about bills before the General Assembly's Public Health Committee dealing with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, misidentified State Senator Cynthia Matthews of Wethersfield, the committee's co-chairwoman.
She is a Democrat.


KISSING OFF SNOW WHITE
LEAD: THE new fairy tales rising out of the social and political struggles of the late 1960's and 1970's excite me both as a literary critic and as the father of a 2 1/2-year-old daughter.
Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and the other chaste heroines have been radically transformed.
Comatose princesses no longer wait for their dream princes or venerable fathers to rescue them.


AIDS AND INSURERS
LEAD: To the Editor:


Correction
LEAD: Two charts in a grouping last Sunday with an article about foster care in New York City omitted scale numerals.
One, on race, showed a steady decline of the percent of children in foster care who are white, from 17.8 percent in 1977 to 8.4 percent in 1986.
The chart on age showed a steady increase in the percent of children under 6 years old, from 18.0 percent in 1977 to 31.6 percent in 1986.


LEARNING THE LESSONS OF UNCIVIL OBEDIENCE
LEAD: THE day after January's heaviest snow, my wife, Jennifer, and I awoke to find our street plowed - a rare and happy event.
Unfortunately, the plows in their zeal had shoved a wall of snow against the cars parked on the street, ours included.
We couldn't get out; we couldn't even open the car doors.


Fighting to Stay On the Farm
LEAD: THINGS were looking grim for Duane Kruse, a northwestern Illinois farmer, when he made page 1 news last Nov. 25.


Through Jungle and Ice by Armchair
LEAD: When winter is supposed to be over and isn't, and spring is supposed to be here and is laggard (a slower word than late), and every sunny day has to be paid for with a week of grayness or rain, you see what Eliot meant by calling April the cruelest month.


U.S.-SOVIET TALKS PULL EUROPEANS TOGETHER
LEAD: SPEAKING in Brussels last week, Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British Foreign Secretary, caught a mood that has crystallized since it became apparent that the United States and the Soviet Union might very well remove their medium-range missiles from Europe.
It was a plea for Western Europe to get its act together.


WAITING FOR NATIONAL PRESTO TO POP John C. Boland
LEAD: National Presto Industries is best known for its small appliances - corn poppers, pressure cookers, electric fry pans - ''the kind of thing you buy for your mother-in-law at Christmas,'' said a broker who has been buying the stock.
The shares, which topped $40 in February, were trading at about $33 last week on the Big Board after disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.


Reports From Eight Regions: Southwest
LEAD: The slump in the energy industry remains the overriding factor holding the region's unemployment level at nearly 9 percent, and calls are still heard for diversification of the economic base.
But restoring vigor to the once-soaring economy of the Southwest through expansion of non-energy-related businesses could take three years, economists warn.


Banking Is Becoming A Specialty Item
LEAD: MARK A. HOLOD, for seven years a real-estate manager for Pepsico, woke up one day last December to discover that he was a banker.


COPENHAGEN
LEAD: What do they do in Copenhagen when the Tivoli gardens are closed?
In fact, quite a lot.
The Danish capital, while eagerly anticipating the reopening of the gardens on May 1, bustles with life.
The cultural season is in full swing, and the streets are alive with shoppers and strollers.


Israel Loosens Ties With Pretoria
LEAD: In common with more than a few countries, Israel has long been ambivalent about South Africa.
It has condemned the South Africans' racial policies while quietly selling them weapons and military technology.
Taking a step back from that position last week, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said no new military contracts would be signed with South Africa.


ISRAEL TRYING JEWS FOR TALKING TO P.L.O.
LEAD: For the first time in the history of Israel, four Jews are being tried by the Government for holding peace talks with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.


Marketing a Musical
LEAD: To the Editor:


Robots Right at Home In This Region
LEAD: THE Westchester-Connecticut region, rarely identified as a center for high-technology manufacturing companies, has within its boundaries two of the world's major producers of industrial robots.
One of them, Unimation Inc., was the first company in the world to produce an industrial robot - not in Japan but in Danbury,


CORRECTION
LEAD: A review in the Arts and Leisure section on March 15 of recordings of Anton Bruckner's music misidentified the orchestra Bernard Haitink conducted in a Philips recording of the Fourth Symphony.
It is the Vienna Philharmonic.


The Worm and the Apple: Productivity Gains; Trash Triumph
LEAD: Six years ago, New York City won work rule changes permitting the Sanitation Department to use collection trucks with two workers instead of three.
The conversion, now complete, has produced gratifying gains in productivity and efficiency - warranting apples all around for the department's managers and workers.


'FROM MONEY TO INTEGRITY'
LEAD: I read with great relief the article on Midge Turk Richardson, the editor of Seventeen magazine (''When She Talks, Teen-Agers Listen,'' Long Islanders, Feb. 1).
Relief to be told that today's young teen-agers are anti-yuppie.
Working hard and acquiring a lot of money is hollow.
Working hard and acquiring a lot of personal satisfaction is where it's at.


LAST ROUND IN HOUSING FIGHT?
LEAD: TWELVE years ago, an optimistic Janet Hanson and her fledgling fair-housing group, Suffolk Housing Services, filed a suit accusing the Town of Brookhaven of illegally using zoning to exclude the poor.


Father of French Hostage Asks for Mercy on Beirut TV
LEAD: The father of the French hostage Jean-Louis Normandin came to Beirut today and pleaded on television for his son's life.


SCHOLARS WHO SHAPED MODERNISM
LEAD: WITH THE DEATH IN JANU-ary of Arthur Drexler, longtime director of the department of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, and the death last month of Henry-Russell Hitchcock, the dean of American architectural historians, it has been a grim winter indeed for architectural scholarship.


THE BUSIEST OF TIMES BEGINS
LEAD: Proceed with chores gradually even though spring is here.
Mulches: It is too early to remove protective mulches from perennials; wait until the season is more secure and weather warmer.
Vegetables: If the ground was prepared last fall, plant seed of spinach, lettuce, peas.
Lawns: Rake off winter debris, dead grass, tree fruits and twigs.


Poland

FLORAL DESIGNERS ADD SOME ORGANIZATION TO NATURE'S PALETTE
LEAD: THEY are artists working with live color.
Nature is their medium as well as their message.
Their creations are at once painterly and sculptural - and smell good, too.
The five women arranging party baskets in a blossoms-strewn room in Scarsdale once worked at professions as diverse as nursing and computer technology.


ABOUT BOOKS
LEAD: ON Dec. 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the Constitution, and there are myriad opportunities this bicentennial year to learn about its role in the birth and growth of constitutional government.


LEARNING DIGNITY FROM THE 'SELTZER MAN'

LEAD:  To the Editor:


AIRLINES IN QUANDARY OVER REQUEST TO DO MORE TO STEM DRUG FLOW
LEAD: The arrest of 40 airline employees earlier this month on charges of smuggling cocaine into Kennedy International Airport has touched off a debate over how tightly air carriers should police their employees and operations.


Hair-Growth Drug Already Has Its Fans in Canada
LEAD: ''We're not growing hair like werewolves here in Canada, but the population is interested in this drug and the bald population is extremely interested.''


Boxing's Order Curbs Violence
LEAD:  To the Sports Editor:


California
LEAD: To the Editor: Having just returned from a similar trip, I was especially interested in the articles about the California coast.
The occasion was a family reunion of three grown children, a daughter-in-law, my husband and I. We took a weekend tour of that delightful coastal stretch and made several vista stops along the way.


Martha A. Jeffery Becomes a Bride
LEAD: At the Greenfield Hill Congregational Church in Fairfield, Conn., Martha Ann Jeffery, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Reuben Jeffery Jr. of Southport, Conn., was married yesterday to Peter James Hart Jr., the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Hart of Altoona, Pa.
The Rev.
George Coxe Bland Jr. performed the ceremony.


SOLOSITS ON THE BIG SCREEN
LEAD: DON'T PANIC.
IT SAYS MORE about the underutilized flexibility of films than about their uncertain financial state that the most entertaining new movie to arrive in New York since ''Radio Days'' is ''Swimming to Cambodia,'' Spalding Gray's one-man performance piece directed for the screen by Jonathan


Nancy J. Bregstein, a Lawyer, Marries
LEAD: Nancy Jane Bregstein, a partner in the Washington law firm Shea &amp; Gardner, and Dr.
Gary Victor Gordon, a rheumatologist at the Lankenau Hospital in Philadelphia, were married last night at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington.
Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie performed the ceremony.


Fire on Oil Tanker in Jersey
LEAD: A fire that broke out tonight on a docked tanker unloading 26 million gallons of crude oil sent flames 20 feet in the air before it was extinguished, the Coast Guard said.
Coast Guard officials said no injuries were reported and the British tanker, which was docked at the Eagle Point Coastal Refinery across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, suffered little damage in the blaze.


Is 'Glasnost' a Game of Mirrors?
LEAD: This article was prepared by a group of dissident Soviet emigres, all living in the West.
They are Vasily Aksyonov, Vladimir Bukovsky, Edward Kuznetsov, Yuri Lyubimov, Vladimir Maximov, Ernst Neizvestny and Aleksandr Zinoviev.


YOUNG DANNY KAYE
LEAD: To the Editor:


SEX RATIO DISPUTE TROUBLES WOMEN AT CAROLINA U.
LEAD: Some women who are students and faculty members at the University of North Carolina have taken exception to the consternation several trustees have expressed over the growing number of women in the student body.


A French Disneyland Near Paris Is Approved
LEAD: A Disneyland leisure park that is expected to draw 10 million visitors a year will be built outside Paris, the French Government announced today.


TALKING: Brownstones; Special Aspects of Co-op Life
LEAD: AT first glance, a co-operative apartment in a town house - in New York City often called a brownstone no matter what its facade is made of - may look like an attractive alternative to one in a conventional elevator building.


Peggy Anne Smoler, a Sales Manager, Is Married
LEAD: Peggy Anne Smoler, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Avrum D. Smoler of New York, was married last evening to Scott M. Schecter, the son of Mrs.
Irving Cohen of Jericho, L.I., and the late Gerald Schecter.
Rabbi David Posner performed the ceremony at the Fairview Country Club in Greenwich, Conn.


Food; PUTTING A LITTLE SPARK INTO COOKING FOR TWO
LEAD: COOKING for two night after night does not have to be a boring chore.
Because you are dealing in small quantities you can be imaginative without taking up a great deal of time.
The kind of recipes I enjoy making are those that I can put together easily after I get home from work - and that don't require the use of every pan in the kitchen.


KEEPING THEIR WIT ABOUT THEM
LEAD: ALTHOUGH THERE WILL ALWAYS be actresses who make audiences laugh by poking fun at themselves and their characters, the preferred path to comedy is that of wit and intelligence, as demonstrated by a number of women currently performing on the New York stage.
Giving droll performances of the most serious intentions and the most pleasurable results are Lisa Banes, Laura Hicks and Patricia Hodges as a time-trekking trio in ''On the Verge or the Geography of Yearning'' and Dianne Wiest in ''Hunting Cockroaches.


Beth Kugel to Marry
LEAD: The engagement of Beth Judith Kugel to Martin Emanuel Einhorn, the son of May Stern Einhorn of Kew Gardens, Queens, and the late Richard Einhorn, has been announced by the future bride's parents, Florence and Barry Kugel of New York.
Miss Kugel graduated from the State University at Albany.
Her fiance is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America.


Minds, Molecules and Monsters
LEAD:  To the Editor:  In reviewing Jon Franklin's ''Molecules of the Mind'' (Feb. 8), Barry L. Jacobs writes: ''Indeed, as Mary Shelley tells us in 'Frankenstein,' it would be easy to mistake the brain of a beggar or thief for that of a nobleman or genius.'' Frankenstein's monster must have had quite a brain; he was reading ''Paradise Lost'' within a year or so after he was assembled.


NEW YORKERS, ETC.
LEAD: WHAT can you do when it's there, lurking in the minds of most men, and even a lot of women: the idea that all women love to shop.
Oh, they'll concede, maybe not scurrying around for scallions and lentil soup, vacuum cleaners and ladders.
But for clothes, accessories, cosmetics?
Of course!
Naturally!


Target Qaddafi
LEAD: Seymour Hersh's article raises questions which the Congress should have been asking long ago:


Dance; HOW CUNNING HAM BUILDS DRAMA
LEAD: WHEN CHOREOGRAPHERS are called poetic, it is frequently because their work looks pure and pretty.
This is a romantic view of both poetry and dance, but it does not fit as far as Merce Cunningham is concerned.


Where Deadly Force Became Rare
LEAD:  To the Editor:


LOVING THE ACRES BUT SEEING THE FLAWS
LEAD: I am in much agreement with Elizabeth Hunter re ''Living a Life on an Acre of L.I.''  [ Opinion Page, Feb. 22 ] .
We too have been in love with Long Island's North Shore for decades.
Being in Montauk or Sag Harbor or on the Baiting Hollow bluffs, etc., gives both me and my husband a real high.


POSTINGS: 5,700 Sq. Ft.; Modular Mansion
LEAD: Most modular houses are simple, predesigned stuctures kept under 2,500 square feet for easy shipment and assembly.
But a modular home planned for Mamaroneck, N.Y. is shattering that stereotype with an elaborate French-provincial design and 5,700 square feet of space.


HOW DID I EVER GET ALONG ALONE?
LEAD: WHILE the business reporters of the nation have had a field day reporting the belt-tightening processes of major corporations, a few thousand Westchester residents have been caught in the squeeze.
These are the major and minor executives and their wives who suddenly find themselves among the retired.


GOLDEN BOXES WITH LUSTROUS PEDIGREES
LEAD: GOLD BOXES - TOYS OF Europe's 18th- and 19th-century aristocrats -continue to delight 20th-century collectors, two of whom, Arthur and Rosalinde Gilbert, are sharing most of their precious objects with the public in an exhibition on view at A La Vieille Russie, 781 Fifth Avenue (at 59th Street).


CORRECTION
LEAD: Some copies of Sports Pages yesterday contained a headline about Louisiana State's 63-58 basketball victory over DePaul in Cincinnati Friday night but omitted an article on the game.
A report appears today in Section 5.


WHO'S WHO AND WHERE
LEAD: The League of Women Voters has just issued its free 1987 directory of public officials, a 48-page pamphlet the size of a legal envelope.


FANCY FOOTWORK OFF THE FIELD, TOO
LEAD: GARBED in a T-shirt and navy-blue sweatpants, Mike Daly put one sock-clad foot in front of the other and concentrated. ''Right, left, right,'' he said, panting, as he lumbered across the polished wood floor.
Then, his feet got tangled. ''Missed it,'' he murmured, and started over again. ''Right, left, right.


Kids on Safari
LEAD: To the Editor: We liked Martha Eliott's article on ''Taking a Safari With Kids in Kenya'' (Travel, Jan. 4), but we disagree with her statement that group travel is the best way to travel with kids in Africa.
She also says that siblings would have fought if they had not had other children around.
This was not our experience.


Aviators Guide Disabled Jet
LEAD: Two Navy aviators guided their disabled F-14 fighter jet beyond homes and a busy freeway before safely bailing out Friday, witnesses and the authorities said.
The plane then crashed into a hillside.
The aviators, on a training mission out of the Miramar Naval Air Station near here, were identified as John R.


AFTER 30 YEARS, THE COINS KEEP JINGLING
LEAD: THE coin-operated newspaper rack is celebrating its 30th birthday this year, and it has never been in better shape. ''Business has been doing nothing but growing for the last 10 to 15 years,'' said David C. Kaspar, vice president for sales of Kaspar Wire Works Inc., the Shiner, Tex., company that is the largest of the half-dozen-or-so concerns that produce coin-operated racks in the United


Target Qaddafi
LEAD: Seymour Hersh charges that the principal purpose of the Libya air raid was to assassinate Col.
Muammar el-Qaddafi and his family.
Perhaps he's right, perhaps not, but his article fails to make his case.
Why?
Virtually every ''fact'' Mr.
Hersh adduces is attributed to a nameless ''source.''


LONG RUNS, HIGH RISKS
LEAD: EUGENE O'NEILL WOULD have understood Victoria Principal's problem.
Long before the dawn of prime time and Nielsens, the playwright dramatized the Faustian bargain his actor-father, James O'Neill, had struck with a lucrative, long-running stage role as the Count of Monte Cristo.


NEW INDICTMENTS COULD CLARIFY THE 'THRESHOLD OF IMPROPRIETY'
LEAD: THE indictments of two powerful Democrats on Federal charges of bribery, fraud and conspiracy last week gave New York State politicians, already wrestling with matters of ethics on several fronts, another question to ponder.
Where is the line between influencing politicians, especially through the time-honored tradition of gifts, and bribing them?


AIDS Treatment Wins the Approval Of Federal Agency
LEAD: Deciding that the promise of prolonging the lives of some AIDS patients outweighs serious side effects, the Food and Drug Administration last week approved the use of the drug azidothymidine, or AZT.
A cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome is not in sight, but AZT may offer many victims a shred of hope.

TRYING TO GET AMERICAN INTO COMPETITIVE TRIM
LEAD: NOT LONG AFTER President Reagan delivered his State of the Union Message in January, the White House sent members of Congress a hefty 1,600-page document detailing dozens of proposals to improve American ''competitiveness'' - a phrase that has come to embrace everything from revisions in the antitrust laws to assistance for dislocated workers and new legislation that would protect intellectual property.


FITCHBURG, MASS., HAS A SAFETY NET FOR HOMELESS

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD:  FADING, MY PARMACHEENE BELLE.
By Joanna Scott. (Ticknor &amp; Fields, $17.95.) For readers not versed in the ways of trout fishing, a Parmacheene Belle is one of the most fetching of flies, able to draw the biggest fish, but one that ''wears out so fast we got to make use of it sparingly.'' Elusive title aside, this is a remarkably inventive first novel, narrated in the first-person voice of a curmudgeonly old angler whose wife of 53 years, his own Parmacheene Belle, has just died.


COACH OF IOWA RETURNS HOME, AND FINDS A WINNING PROGRAM
LEAD: After all these years, Tom Davis was going home.
He grew up in the Midwest, in Wisconsin, where he attended college and began his coaching career at the high-school level.
The prospect of cold, barren winters did not depress him.
The understanding that a basketball program would be a rallying point for an entire state was not the type of pressure he would try to avoid.

'Intimate Partners'
LEAD:  To the Editor:
It's a shame that Carol Tavris could not be more enthusiastic in her review of Maggie Scarf's ''Intimate Partners'' (March 1), because it's an important book that should have had a front-page review and lots of praise.


2 PIANISTS A CELLIST, ORGANIST AND OBOIST
LEAD:  Louis Lortie  Louis Lortie's impressive recital at the 92d Street Y Wednesday night introduced New York to a Canadian pianist with musical and technical gifts out of the ordinary.
Mr.

WHEN MORE MANHATTAN IS NEEDED, NEW YORK JUST CREATES IT
LEAD: IF Peter Minuit had stood on what is now the southern tip of Manhattan when he negotiated the island's purchase from the Indians in 1626, he would have been under water.

NOTED WITH PLESURE
LEAD:  Beautiful Thoughts About Time


Carlton Loses Job
LEAD: IT'S hard to get back your old stuff when you're 42 years old, especially if your old stuff was the stuff of legends.
Now after trying for a comeback as an unpaid, nonroster pitcher at the Phillies' training camp, Steve Carlton has been dropped from the squad.
For Carlton, a four-time Cy Young Award winner who spent 15 of his 22 major-league seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies before his release last June, the anticlimactic end came after the left-hander, knowing his job was on the line, allowed four runs on four hits Friday in the Phillies' 8-3 loss to the St.

LEAD: AFFECTIONATELY profiled in the hourlong documentary ''A Hero's Journey,'' the scholar and teacher Joseph Campbell seems a figure of heroic proportions.

LIBERTY PARK MARINA
LEAD: IT'S NOT that Morris Pesin of Jersey City doesn't like water sports.

THE SPECIAL LUSTER OF THE GREAT TEACHER
LEAD: GREAT MUSICIANS WHO ARE not also great teachers - and that, you know, means most of them - are like gold mines whose entrances have been covered over.
The precious ore that lies inside each of them remains hidden, an El Dorado of learning and experience that is lost forever at death.
That is why the comparatively few musical celebrities who also become great teachers, such as Andres Segovia and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, take on a special luster as they grow older.


BRITAIN LEADS WITH SEVERAL NEW ISSUES
LEAD: THE British Post Office began its 1987 program with two divergent looks at our world.

Skiing

The Waterbury Area Takes On a New Shine
LEAD: WHEN the brass mills began dying out a dozen years ago in this industrial city in west-central Connecticut 100 miles from New York City, it looked as if the area was in for some tough times.
But it turned out the demise of the brass giants was the best thing to happen to Waterbury, because high-technology concerns, cleaner and better paying, have moved in to take their place.


DEFENDER OF FRENCH STYLE
LEAD: FRENCH MUSICAL STYLE - always elusive - has become even more so in recent years.
Indeed, many fear it is vanishing altogether.
In somewhat of a coup, the Metropolitan Opera now has within its walls three eminent conservators of an esteemed tradition.

BATTLE SCENES ON CANVAS AT FAIRFIELD U.
LEAD: THE Forbes Magazine collection that bestowed ''Victorian Childhood'' on the Yale Center for British Art earlier this season now brings ''Valor and Vainglory'' to Fairfield University.

Review; STAGE: MEXICAN 'ROSE OF TWO AROMAS,' IN ENGLISH
LEAD: TWO women who compute the costs and benefits of love in ''A Rose of Two Aromas'' are not the first people to keep double sets of books, but their bottom lines turn out to be a surprise.
The popular Mexican playwright Emilio Carballido has given this old story enough new twists to extort a lot of laughter from the audience.


'GRAND AND INTIMATE' SETTING FOR ART
LEAD: VISITING Silvermine Collection '87 at Pitney Bowes's world headquarters in Stamford is like visiting a contemporary art museum.

By Norman Cousins. (Norton, $15.95.) According to Norman Cousins, the world is mad. ''The Pathology of Power'' traces the etiology of its illness, from Hiroshima, where the decision to drop what Harry Truman called ''the terrible bomb'' had, Mr.

How Novels and Software Are the Same (and Not the Same)
LEAD:  To the Editor:

CRIMINALS, AUTHORS, AND CRIMINAL AUTHORS
LEAD: THEY are known nationally as the ''Son of Sam'' laws, even though the first of these statutes was passed in New York months before David Berkowitz, the self-styled ''Son of Sam'' killer, was captured 10 years ago and notwithstanding the fact that the law was never successfully applied to his case.

Or do our evaluations change?


MATCH-POINT STAKES WON THE GAME
LEAD: THE variation in technique dictated by different forms of scoring is more obvious in the play than the bidding: The pairs player, hungry for overtricks, takes risks that he would not consider in a team game.


LETTING GRANDPA DELIVER THE NEWS
LEAD: TO Brian J. Kelly, using children to deliver the weekly Greenwood (Ind.) Gazette to 19,000 geographically dispersed customers made no sense.

POSTINGS: Saving the Views; Quarry Low-Rise
LEAD: Over the years, village officials in South Orange, N.J., had considered many proposals for the development of a former stone quarry.

Review; THEATER: RODGERS AND HART
LEAD: ''TOO MANY GIRLS,'' the 1939 Rodgers and Hart show that is receiving a buoyant revival by the Equity Library Theater, was the first musical with a collegiate setting to become a hit on Broadway after ''The Student Prince,'' which had opened 15 years earlier.
Set at the fictitious Pottawatomie College, in exotic New Mexico, it tells the story of four Ivy League football players who are hired by the wealthiest man in America to be his daughter's secret bodyguards after she decides to enroll in his out-of-the-way alma mater.

The Locked Files

Suddenly they are alive again, demanding attention again.

Biotechnology at M.I.T.
LEAD:  To the Editor:  In his otherwise able review of Martin Kenney's ''Biotechnology'' (Feb. 15), Richard Novick goes out of his way to rebut Mr.
Kenney's description of the Whitehead Institute as a conduit for corporate control over academic biotechnology research - a description he terms a serious deficiency and ''a considerable disservice'' to those involved.


Target Qaddafi
LEAD: Your account of the conniving, deception and lawlessness that culminated in the United States bombing raid on Libya brings to mind the old caution that we must choose our enemies with care because we tend eventually to become like them.
That 77 percent of Americans polled approved our own brand of international terrorism tells me far more about my countrymen than

James Episcopal Church in Scarsdale, N.Y., was the setting yesterday for the marriage of Dorothy Estabrook Kindred, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

ARAB ARMS SALES DRAW LESS PROTEST

REPLACING A FAUCET CAN BE EASIER THAN REPAIRING ONE
LEAD: ALTHOUGH most homeowners think of it as a job that is beyond their scope, replacing a kitchen or bathroom faucet is a fairly simple plumbing project that is sometimes easier than trying to repair the old one.

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD: ECLECTIC MUSICAL MIX FROM the Chipmunks to the Beasty Boys, Miss Piggy to Bon Jovi, it was an interesting mix of vocalists heard on the Sag Harbor radio station WLNG-AM/FM last Sunday night.

Darwin on Women
LEAD:  To the Editor:

CORRECTIONS

TOURNAMENT, AND MEMORIES, RETURN
LEAD: THE cheerleaders hugged and kissed him, the fans stormed out of their seats and paraded him round the court on their shoulders.
For Joe Lapchick, at the age of 65, it was the sweetest day, and the last day, of a 50-year career of playing and coaching basketball.


Going Public
LEAD: FOR THE LAST 19 years, the general public has viewed Jay Spectre's interiors only vicariously - by delving through pages of sleek decorating magazines.

LEAD: Two weekends ago, as the followers of Syracuse University anticipated its annual early exit from the national collegiate basketball tournament, they had no problem selecting the area that would seal the doom of the Orangemen.


AVENTURES IN TINSELTOWN
LEAD: ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT from Manhattan, I realized I had forgotten the tape recorder microphone at home, so I stopped to buy a new one.
The salesman wanted to know why I needed it, and when I told him I was going out to Los Angeles to do an interview, he wanted to know who I was interviewing. ''Bette Midler,'' I said.


One Killed, 8 Injured As Balloon Hits Wire
LEAD: A hot air balloon carrying tourists over a scenic mountain area collided with electrical wires today and its gondola plunged 50 feet to the ground, killing one person and injuring eight.


The Nancy Gene
LEAD: SINCE PRESIDENT Reagan can't bear to fire anybody, his wife has to do it for him.
A sensible division of First Family duties, is it not?
Yet when the famous firing of White House staff chief Donald Regan brought it to light, many people registered shock and loathing.


LAFONTAINE'S TWO LATE GOALS HELP TO SINK RANGERS
LEAD: The Islanders were trailing but then Pat LaFontaine, like a boomerang, darted into the danger zone in front of the Ranger net and made his presence felt with two third-period goals tonight.


Broadcast TV
LEAD: Although life in general is famously stingy with second chances, television -where the rerun has been polished to high art - is generous to a fault.
On Monday at 9 P.M., Channel 13 has a splendid offer - another chance to see the 1984 movie ''El Norte.''


STOPPING THE HIGH-TECH GIVEAWAY
LEAD: WHEN Reagan Administration opposition forced Fujitsu Ltd. to drop its plans to buy control of the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation last week, Fujitsu and Fairchild executives immediately made it clear that their relationship was not dead.
The two companies now plan to enter into a series of technology-exchange and development programs and joint manufacturing projects that will enable the companies to make and sell each other's products.


ESPOSITO: IS HE GOOD FOR RANGERS?
LEAD: Yes, Phil Esposito is good for the Rangers!
Esposito is good for the entire sport of hockey.
His go-for-it-all attitude has sent waves through the N.H.L. and has lifted the Rangers.
No longer do Ranger fans need to wait until the playoffs to see good Ranger hockey.

LEAD: ''Something went wrong in our value systems, and it is vital that we all learn from my mistakes and those of others.''


MERITS AND DEMERITS OF DOUBLED PAWNS
LEAD: THERE is no disputing Savielly Tartakover's old saying,''An isolated pawn spreads gloom all over the chessboard,'' but it would have been equally appropriate if he had made doubled pawns his subject.

TO WIFE AND STATE, DUKAKIS TIMING IS A SURPRISE
LEAD: Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts has often been described as a politician long on process and short on style.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  KING SOLOMON'S MINES REVISITED: Western Interests and the Burdened History of Southern Africa.
By William Minter. (Basic, $21.95.) Coming to the Afrikaner's rescue, William Minter says ''segregation was a cooperative venture'' of Boer and Briton.
In this history, which attempts to influence current Western policy toward South Africa, the author, a contributing editor of Africa News Service, shows how the imperial pursuit of wealth subjugated the African long before the Afrikaners in South Africa formally instituted the racially discriminatory apartheid system.


RACEWAY'S PROBLEMS WERE PREDICTABLE
LEAD: On Feb. 15, you published an article that stressed that Roosevelt Raceway was in financial jeopardy and had attributed a loss of nearly $2 million to the track for the first five weeks of racing this year  [ ''Fate of Raceway Hangs in Balance'' ] .


Target Qaddafi
LEAD: I thank Seymour M. Hersh for his very fine reporting in ''Target Qaddafi'' (Feb. 22).
What his article underscores for me is a dangerous coherence in the formation and implementation of foreign policy in the Reagan White House.
It scares me that it is possible for some of this country's most delicate foreign involvements to be conceived and carried out by President Reagan and a handful of his unofficial advisers, but it is scarier still that they act on the basis of archaic moral codes, by which these men sanction the murder of those who strike them as most morally repugnant.


A POLITICAL CONVLESCENCE BEGINS, PROGNOSIS UNCERTAIN
LEAD: '' IT was a dull press conference,'' said Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, after President Reagan met with reporters last Thursday evening, his first such session in four months. ''It probably didn't inspire anyone.'' Friday morning, one of the President's senior advisers said, ''From our point of view, that's a plus, because it means that he didn't go out there and blow it.


Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''For Islamic modernists, reformers, the middle ground has caved in.
There isn't any middle ground.

Fouad Ajami, professor at Johns Hopkins University, on the Sunni-Shiite conflict.  [ 22:1.

Desmond Charles O'Neill of New Canaan, Conn., has been announced by Mr. and Mrs.
Richard D. McDonough of Old Greenwich, Conn., parents of the bride-to-be.


L.I. Problem: Filling Jobs
LEAD: LONG ISLAND'S business leaders are without a doubt optimistic about career opportunities in both Nassau and Suffolk counties.
Thousands of jobs - in many career fields, including high technology, services and retail - are being created each year, they say.
But many of those same business leaders are equally pessimistic about their industries' ability to attract workers to fill them.


WHAT'S NEW IN NEWSPAPER DELIVERY
LEAD: FOR more than two centuries, the newspaper delivery business has depended on the entrepreneurial spirit and unlimited energy of children.
The kids would deliver papers by foot to about 50 customers along a small route, drop in for a soda or cookie along the way and make their money - rarely more than $50 a week - from the difference between the wholesale and retail prices of the delivered copies and from customers' tips.


MIX-UPS AT BICENTENNIAL GIVE PHILADELPHIA JITTERS
LEAD: Is Philadelphia about to blow it again?


Lingering in An Irish Hamlet
LEAD: Nearly every tour bus traveling between Limerick and Killarney stops in Adare.


Skiers Blaze a Rugged Trail Across Vermont
LEAD: IT would be difficult to pick a better time to cross-country ski 280 miles up the length of the state of Vermont.
The weather is warm, the snow deep and the days long.
From Feb. 27 to March 21, groups have been skiing consecutive sections of the proposed Catamount Trail.
In some places the trail is well-marked and groomed; in others it can be found only with compass bearing through the woods.


Crafts Carve a Niche in Rome
LEAD: Although many people value Rome more for its historic monuments than its shopping posibilities, many shops have recently opened in the Eternal City and are changing this opinion.


Jersey Becomes A Job Factory
LEAD: JUST OVER a decade ago, New Jersey had become synonymous in many people's minds with trouble.
Its school systems were running out of money, its biggest cities were embroiled in racial and political distress, and the factories that had long given the state an identity as a manufacturing powerhouse were closing down at an alarming rate, throwing thousands of men and women out of work.


VICTIM'S SON: EX-PROSECUTOR OF THE MAFIA
LEAD: William I. Aronwald, the son of the slain Parking Violations Bureau hearing officer, George M. Aronwald, earned a reputation as an aggressive prosecutor and a successful defense lawyer.
Both careers enveloped the son in stormy controversies over the last 20 years.


A CHILLIER CLIMATE FOR THE LEFT IN FINLAND
LEAD: FOR decades, the Communist Party was one of the groups that dominated the coalition politics of Finland.
But after last week's parliamentary election, it was clear that the Communists, once a vital mediator in Helsinki's delicate relations with the Soviet Union, had fallen into the lower tier of Finnish politics that includes smaller parties representing Christian fundamentalists, a Swedish-speaking minority and environmentalists.


Hotel Enterprises Booming on the Island
LEAD: ''WE'RE LOOKING for nice people,'' said Howard Feiertag, who is overseeing hiring of the staff for the Royce Carlin Hotel in Melville, L.I., a 306-room facility now taking shape on Route 110 near the Nassau-Suffolk County border. ''We are looking for friendly people, people who smile, people who get along with people.


A Coach for Madden
LEAD: HE'S gotten a lot of mileage out of his well-known fear of flying, which led him to swear off air travel and take to the cross-country rails, but after years of changing trains in Chicago, John Madden is turning his back on trains.
It's not that the football-coach-turned-television-commentator has developed a phobia for trains, but rather that he has been gripped by a sudden love of buses, specifically a seductive $500,000 custom-built motor coach that Greyhound is providing him along with a driver to take him from assignment to assignment.


FRONTONS ASK LOWER AGE LIMIT
LEAD: CONCERNED over steadily declining attendance, the state's three jai alai frontons are pushing for legislation that would lower the minimum age for patrons to 14 to 18.


Q and A
LEAD:  Buying an Insider's Rights  Question: I bought insider's rights for an apartment in a building being converted into a co-op.
As part of the agreement, the tenant who sold me the rights moved out and I took over the rent.
I have already given the tenant half of the $5,000 payment to take his position and will pay the rest when the building is converted.


The Worm and the Apple: Productivity Gains; Appetizing Street
LEAD: West 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, known as Restaurant Row for its variety of high-class bistros and cafes lining both sides, has long been one of New York City's better blocks.
Now it's better still, thanks to a handsome street renovation that earns an apple for the city's Department of Transportation.


STAGE: POLITICAL SATIRE IN GERSHWIN DOUBLE BILL
LEAD: After more than half a century, the barbs of political satire might be expected to seem blunted or obscure to present-day audiences.
But ''Of Thee I Sing,'' which opened in 1931, ran for 441 performances and won a Pulitzer Prize, and its less successful 1933 sequel, ''Let 'Em Eat Cake,'' which closed after 90 performances, are dotted with satirical jabs that could be quite contemporary.


JAPANESE: DELUXE, NOT AUSTERE
LEAD: THE stereotype of the austere, spartan Japanese restaurant is shattered by the Kokura II restaurant in Woodbury.
Valet parking is the first indication that this is a Japanese restaurant in the deluxe style.

PAKISTAN STIFFENS ON ATOM PROGRAM
LEAD: Rising American pressure on Pakistan to stop developing a nuclear bomb has provoked objections throughout the country and raised doubts among some about the reliability of Washington as a friend.


ABOUT LONG ISLAND
LEAD: ELIZABETH KNOLHOFF and her son moved out of our neighborhood less than a full year ago, but we miss them more, not less, each day.
And they only moved to Freeport, one town away, but they might as well have moved to the moon.


A Male Secretary
LEAD: In his article ''A Male Secretary'' (About Men, Feb. 22), Joseph Finder presents himself as a patronizing elitist, accepting a subservient position until he finds a ''real job.'' However, my objection is not so much to his tone as to his contention that he understands the frustrations of secretaries.


TWO CULTURES FACE THE UNIVERSAL THEMES OF RENOUNCING LIFE AND EMBRACING GOD
LEAD: RELIGION - REAL RELI-gion - may offer its comforts, but it is not a comfortable thing.
It finds the world wanting; it makes inexorable demands, and there are times, as a new stage production and a new movie in New York both set out to demonstrate, when it will settle for nothing less than life itself.


FALL RIVER'S PLAN PIONEERS AGAINST SEGREGATION BY LANGUAGE
LEAD: A school desegregation plan designed to end the isolation of a linguistic minority will begin here next month in what state and city officials say is the first such effort in the country.


GLUM ROCK: MOPE AROUND THE CLOCK
LEAD: ''I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I feel,'' Morrissey of the Smiths sings on the band's new double album, ''Louder Than Bombs.''

LEAD: Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States Trade Representative, once boasted at a State Department lunch about the bargain he had found last May in a tailor's shop in Seoul, South Korea.
The two suits he bought there cost only $150 each, he said, adding, ''They would be $500 apiece here.''

Lessons Mr. Reagan Hasn't Learned
LEAD: Anyone wondering whether Ronald Reagan is physically fit, reasonably alert and well attended by his new White House team can take some reassurance from his recent news conference.
Anyone hoping for enlightenment on the Iran-contra scandal has to be disappointed.
His stance remains one of self-mystification.

WESTCHESTER GUIDE
LEAD: PAPER BAG PLAYERS After 29 exhuberant seasons, surely there is nobody who doesn't like The Paper Bag Players, the imaginative children's-theater ensemble performing this week and next at the Music Hall in Tarrytown.

NICARAGUA RELIVES ITS YANKEE PAST
LEAD: THIS GRACEFUL AND DIGNI-fied city, founded in 1524, is the only place in Nicaragua where one feels in touch with Latin America's colonial past.
Sculpted iron balconies protrude from whitewashed buildings, and strong cedar beams support elegant churches.
The Spanish-style central plaza is as stately as any in the hemisphere.


OUTFITS TO BIKE BY
LEAD: IT used to be that when you wanted to go for a bicycle ride, you just hopped on your bicycle and started pedaling.
But these days the right stuff for a bike ride includes not only a two-wheeler but an appropriate outfit.


Gardener's Dream: No Cloudy Days
LEAD: WHAT gardener hasn't been frustrated at times by a scarcity of sunshine to make things grow or ripen?
Lawrence E. Stanhope of Lakeland, Fla., came up with a solution.


ARNOLD BAX: DOWDY, YES, BUT DAZZLING
LEAD: SOME COMPOSERS ARE OUT OF fashion, like Hindemith, and some composers are really out of fashion.
Take Arnold Bax.
Bax is a name known to lovers of classical music in this country, of course, but just barely.
Even in his native England, which so dotes on its dowdy old late Romantics, there is apparently considerable resistance to programming his scores in concerts - or so claims the Scottish conductor Bryden Thomson in the February issue of the English record magazine


LANDSCAPES THAT ARE ROOTED IN THE 60'S
LEAD: NEIL JENNEY, PAT STEIR AND Joe Zucker are all well-known painters in their 40's.
All three are currently showing around 70th Street and Madison Avenue, in galleries in which they have not exhibited before.
All three have been painting landscapes that stretch and pull against their 1960's roots without giving any indication of leaving the 60's behind.


Memorial for the Crew of the Challenger
LEAD: June Scobee, widow of Francis R. Scobee, the commander of the shuttle Challenger, placing flowers on his grave at Arlington National Cemetery, Va., after a ceremony yesterday dedicating a memorial there to the seven astronauts who were killed when the shuttle exploded. (AP)


KEY 1954 BIAS CASE: A DRAMA BACKSTAGE
LEAD: A recently published oral history sheds important new light on the behind-the-scenes drama that led up to the Supreme Court's historic 1954 decision striking down school segregation, including private discussions between Justice Felix Frankfurter and a key Justice Department lawyer.


FRESH FROM THE SEA
LEAD: WHEN JEAN-LOUIS PALLADIN RETURNED TO Paris last fall to demonstrate what French chefs have done for America, he brought with him Maryland crabmeat, Maine lobster coral and Tennessee caviar. ''I wanted to show chefs in France how good American seafood ingredients are to cook with,'' says Palladin, who in 1974, at the age of 28, was the youngest chef in France to receive two of


FROM ATOMIC PROJECT TO THE BOARDROOM
LEAD: ''I WAS never an empire builder,'' said Albert Nerken of Brookville. ''I always put one foot in front of the other and said: What seems the reasonable thing to do next?''

One-Room School Expands
LEAD: New Hampshire soon will lose one of its three one-room schoolhouses.
Voters in the Newfound School District on Wednesday approved adding a second room to the Village School in Alexandria.
Built in the 1850's and used by 20 first graders and second graders, the school has run out of room.
The other two one-room schoolhouses are the Hebron Village School, also in the Newfound district, and the Blue School in Landaff.


Friday Before 'Foe'
LEAD:  To the Editor:
In his review of J. M. Coetzee's ''Foe'' (Feb. 22), which expands upon ''Robinson Crusoe,'' Denis Donoghue mentions Jean Rhys's ''Wide Sargasso Sea'' as a similar reworking of a classic.
That was ''Jane Eyre,'' but there is another example closer to the subject.
Michel Tournier's ''Friday'' (published in this country in 1969) also retells the story of Robinson Crusoe and is a strange, wonderful book.

The correct numbers are: Pamela Crane, president, (201) 233-2643; Hazel Scherb, vice president, (201) 322-4064.


The Palme Obsession
LEAD: In his article ''The Palme Obsession: The Murder Sweden Can't Forget or Solve'' (March 1), Richard Reeves argues that the Swedish Government has deliberately withheld important facts about the investigation of the assassination of Sweden's Prime Minister, Olof Palme.


Children and the Bomb
LEAD:  To the Editor:  I don't know what Roger Sutton in his essay ''Yooks, Zooks and the Bomb'' (Feb. 22) expects children's books concerning ''this nuclear deal'' to accomplish, but his smug attitude of ''Get away from me, kid, let the grown-ups handle this'' is surprising given his occupation as a librarian.


CORRECTION
LEAD: An article on March 8 about a panel to review New York City school decentralization misstated results of a study on the high school dropout rate.
The study, by the Educational Priorities Panel, estimated that 54 percent of all pupils in the 1986 graduating class - not just black and Hispanic ones - had dropped out of school between 9th and 12th grades.


POSTINGS: Historic Buildings; 'Protect or Plunder'

Take the case of Joan Helpern, proprietor of one of the powerhouses of an industry that designs and makes elegant, avant-garde shoes mostly in Italy and sells huge quantities of them in America.

LEAD: With about 20 seconds remaining in the most glorious afternoon of his young coaching career, Rick Pitino of Providence was confronted by one of the school's heralded alumni, John Thompson, in front of the Friars' bench.
The Georgetown coach extended his hand, whispered a few congratulatory words and then turned to rejoin his team.


SLAIN MAN'S SON WANTS U.S. INQUIRY
LEAD: As New York City police officials sought clues in the slaying of a Parking Violations Bureau hearing officer, his son said yesterday that he would ask for a Federal investigation to determine if his own work as a prosecutor of several organized-crime figures was a motive for the shooting.


DROPOUTS BECOME 'BUSINESS INTERNS'
LEAD: FROM all appearances, the class being held in the engineering and technology building at Westchester Community College in Valhalla on a recent morning looked like any other college class.

PAPERBOYS GO THE WAY OF THE DODO
LEAD: EVERY year, The San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News hires some 5,000 paperboys to deliver 264,000 papers a day over 3,500 routes.
That math looks skewed, but it is not.
Annual turnover at the paper is hitting about 150 percent - which means that Timothy J. Allridge, director of consumer marketing, and his staff have to spend an inordinate amount of time recruiting and training new carriers.


Jazz
LEAD: New work by ambitious jazz composers - innovators who fill large-scale structures with unabashed melody and emotionality -can be heard all around the city this week.
On Monday, the bassist David Holland will unveil new pieces for 12-piece ensemble at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street; Thursday through next Sunday, the cornetist Lawrence (Butch) Morris's new music-theater work, ''Fire,'' will be presented by the Medicine Show Theater Ensemble, 303 East 44th Street.

REPLACING A FAUCET CAN BE EASIER THAN REPAIRING ONE
LEAD: ALTHOUGH most homeowners think of it as a job that is beyond their scope, replacing a kitchen or bathroom faucet is a fairly simple plumbing project that is sometimes easier than trying to repair the old one.


A MODEST BANK MAKES THE BIG LEAGUES
LEAD: AT the First Union Corporation, colleagues of Edward E. Crutchfield Jr. still talk about the time in 1968 when Mr.
Crutchfield tackled - and solved - some serious problems in the bank's credit card operations.
Then just 26 years old, he kept the back office operation open 24 hours a day and brought in a cot to sleep on.


DUKAKIS DECIDES TO RUN
LEAD: THE final size of the early Democratic field is no longer uncertain.
One of the last waverers, Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, announced last week that he was in the running for the party's 1988 Presidential nomination.

LEAD: HISTORICALLY the best of friends with the United States, Costa Rica has been sharply at odds with the Reagan Administration of late.

Hillary Roberts and Peter Rinfret Wed
LEAD: Hillary Roberts, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.

MELTING IS SLOW IN S.E. ASIAN POT

Still, he is prepared for the problems he knows will arise because a Malay, Linda Hakimin, is his wife.


ESPOSITO: IS HE GOOD FOR RANGERS?
LEAD: As a broadcaster, the word ''stupid'' was uttered by Phil Esposito quite often as he commented on hockey events, on and off the ice.
His actions as a general manager merit that evaluation.
Win or lose, trading away a John Tonelli-type player (Kelly Miller) and a successful forward (Mike Ridley) to a dormant Washington team (which gave up a non-playing Bob Carpenter) was as idiotic a trade as has been effected.


Scott I. Oran Plans to Wed Meryl A. Kessler in August

RIGHETTI SEES RECOVERY FROM POOR START
LEAD: In the warm solitude of the early afternoon last week, Dave Righetti searched for answers to a spring of discontent.

PRESIDENT IN QUARREL WITH THE DEMOCRATS OVER FEDERAL BUDGET
LEAD: President Reagan and Congressional Democrats quarreled about the budget today, each accusing the other of using ''smoke and mirrors'' to distort the truth about Federal spending.


Turning Tax Changes To Your Advantage
LEAD: WHETHER you're a corporate executive, computer engineer, nurse's aide or a self-employed shoe repairman, you probably feel warmly about the money your job provides.

Food; PUTTING A LITTLE SPARK INTO COOKING FOR TWO
LEAD: COOKING for two night after night does not have to be a boring chore.
Because you are dealing in small quantities you can be imaginative without taking up a great deal of time.
The kind of recipes I enjoy making are those that I can put together easily after I get home from work - and that don't require the use of every pan in the kitchen.

A COUNTRY NDER GUNS - AND STILL UNDERFED
LEAD: THE 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon once wrote: ''Beset on all sides by foes, the Abyssinians slept for a thousand years forgetful of the world by which they were forgotten.'' Now, after a decade of revolution, war and famine, modern Ethiopia is wide awake to the 20th-century world of superpower politics.


ITALY' HERALDS OF THE BAROQUE
LEAD: ''WHAT'S IN A NAME?'' poor innocent Romeo asked. ''Everything'' is the worldling's answer.
A rose by any other name may smell as sweet, but it sure isn't going to get corporate sponsorship.
Anyone who doubts that has only to consider the fact that not one cent of corporate money could be raised for the major exhibition of 16th- and 17th-century Italian Old Master painting that opens to the public at the Metropolitan Museum next Thursday and can be seen there through


EXPLORING THE BYWAYS OF HARPSICHRD REPERTORY
LEAD: ''I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO show a greater range of the literature than the 30 or 50 years' worth of music people normally play,'' explains Ton Koopman, the Dutch harpsichordist, when asked about the unusually broad scope of the program he will perform at the Metropolitan Museum of Art this evening at 8 o'clock.

MX Hits Its Target in Test
LEAD: An unarmed MX missile was launched from an underground silo here today and successfully delivered six mock warheads to targets 4,200 miles away on a Pacific atoll, military officials said.

These days, that custom may seem as pointless as it is quaint, since many of the new spring suits appear to have seen months of comfortable wear.


NUMBER OF BLACKS IN TOP JOBS IN ADMINISTRATION OFF SHARPLY
LEAD: The number of blacks holding senior policy-making and managerial positions in the Federal Government has dropped dramatically since President Reagan took office, but the number of women, after a sharp decline, has returned to about the level of 1980, Government data show.

Internment in Hindsight
LEAD:  To the Editor:  Patrick S. Washburn's review of Richard Drinnon's ''Keeper of Concentration Camps'' (Feb. 22) is fair in one sense, that Mr.
Drinnon studies Dillon S. Myer, director of the War Relocation Authority, and his actions from our contemporary viewpoint.
But Mr.
Washburn's admonition to beware of ''hindsight'' is self-defeating.


INCREASINGLY, PRO CASH BEATS PRO BONO
LEAD: JOHN S. R. SHAD, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, startled a Congressional subcommittee recently by saying that his $82,500-a-year salary, the highest at the S.E.C., was less than his daughter, admitted to the bar only last year, earned at her New York law firm.

Other projects starting soon in the region are a pulp mill and fish farm near the Washington coast and a steel mill in


The Lure of Puerto Vallarta
LEAD: For two hours they marched down the cobblestone main street past the Town Hall, a dazzling rainbow of color in their school uniforms with homemade red-green-yellow pompons whirling above their heads.
In Puerto Vallarta on Mexico's west coast, the Anniversary of the Revolution is celebrated not with caissons but with a children's parade enlivened by teen-age gymnasts and beauty queens and horseback riders.


The Nursing Profession Is in Need of Care
LEAD: THE nursing profession promises to be a wide open job field in the coming decade.
The problem will be in making it attractive enough to entice young people and to keep experienced nurses, seeking better job opportunities and working conditions, from leaving.


WHAT CHARLES KNEW: HOMAGE TO AN ENGLISH TEACHER
LEAD: HE was a tobacco brown, soft-eyed, angular man.
He had transformed himself from a poor Bluefield, W.Va., mountain boy into an American intellectual.
He had crafted an Oxonian mask behind which one could only surmise black beginnings.
I caught glimpses of that ethnic past in the twinkle - the almost break-loose and ''signifying'' laughter - of his eyes when he told us of his dissertation.


WITH SPRING COME THE FIRST BUDS OF BLIGHT
LEAD: THESE are among those times that can really try your soul: what little snow that's left on the roadside is filthy with exhaust and sand, and spring is not yet enough in the air to have tempted even a hint of green up from the still-sleeping earth.
If the daylight lasts longer and the air is not so bitingly cold, you are yet faced with the sludge and detritus of contemporary life: the beer bottles, filtered cigarette butts, plastic fast-food containers and styrofoam coffee cups that somehow never find their way to a proper garbage can.


Purchase of Michigan Oaks Completed by Nature Group
LEAD: The largest stand of red oaks in seven states has been saved, with a group of conservationists completing the purchase of the 238-acre site in the northern tip of Lower Michigan.


IF WISHES WERE JAZZ CD'S . . .
LEAD: WHEN THE COMPACT DISK was introduced, the policy makers and engineers at record companies were less than sanguine about the prospects of converting material from the 78 r.p.m. era to the new technology, and lovers of classic jazz resigned themselves to sticking with the good old LP.


Juror Is Wrongly Jailed For His Father's Crime
LEAD: A man arrested while serving on a jury turned out to be the wrong man, the authorities discovered Friday after he spent a night in jail.
The man they really wanted was his father.


HAVING A MINIMALIST TIME, WISH YOU WERE HERE
LEAD: ''I DO not expect to see many travel books in the near future,'' Evelyn Waugh wrote in 1946.
Like Claude Levi-Strauss, he saw the world turning into a ''monoculture.'' The sense of place would give way to placelessness, and when every country had been contaminated by every other one, the whole world would be ''Westernized.

CORRECTION
LEAD: A dispatch on March 13 from Palo Alto, Calif., and a report last Sunday in The Week in Review, about a lawsuit by a British scholar denied a professorship at Stanford University, described the suit incorrectly.

Food; PUTTING A LITTLE SPARK INTO COOKING FOR TWO
LEAD: COOKING for two night after night does not have to be a boring chore.
Because you are dealing in small quantities you can be imaginative without taking up a great deal of time.

7 YEARS LATER, HOPE FOR TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE

The aftermath has been long, slow and anguished.


Poets and Their Fathers
LEAD:  To the Editor:  Stanley Kunitz's essay ''The Poet's Quest for the Father'' (Feb. 22) shows his largeness of spirit.
It also shows his depth and ability as a thinker and critic.

THE INVOICE IS IN THE ETHER
LEAD: PERSONAL computers have been touted as the linchpins of the paperless office, still presumed, against all the evidence, to be imminent.
The catalogues I receive, however, are resplendent with paper products to feed these hungry machines.
Mountains of press releases are still deposited in my mail, and the tractor feed strips torn off my reams of manuscripts are recycled by my son Revell in the production of incredible quantities of everything from papier-mache to ersatz soggy woggies -modern-day, supersized spitballs so much a part of the current educational scene.

Q.


TEN MYTHS ABOUT THE REAGAN DEBACLE
LEAD: WE ARE AT THE INTERMISSION FOLLOWING Act I of a three-act drama entitled ''The Iranian Arms Affair.'' Not a catchy title - not Irangate, or Iranscam, or Iranamok - just a simple label for a wild and worrisome plot.


Library Data Bases
LEAD: When it comes to research, says the New Jersey Library Association in Trenton, there is no greater source of information than one's own hometown library - especially in these changing times, when computer data bases are replacing traditional reference volumes.


SHIFTING PROPORTIONS
LEAD: INFLUENTIAL DESIGNERS CREATE new fashion by how they cut a corner, shape a shoulder, lift a hem or drop a waistline.
Sometimes, an extra nudge can start a trend.
Recently, designers and manufacturers in Paris, Milan and New York have favored short hems, which is to say somewhere above the knee - the conservative at the top, the daring an inch or two above that.


Bravery and Baloney
LEAD: You have to admire President Reagan's bravery at his last news conference, but you don't have to swallow his baloney.


BAROQUE FESTIVAL BEGINS IN YONKERS
LEAD: THE 22d annual Hoff-Barthelson Baroque Festival begins at 3 P.M. today in Yonkers's South Presbyterian Church, with Emanuel Vardi leading the student-faculty orchestra in the first three Brandenburg Concertos of Bach, and the school's director, Marv Helton, conducting the Festival Chorus in Handel's stirring Chandos Anthem, ''O Praise the Lord.

TEACHER PAY LEADS RISE IN BUDGETS FOR TOWN

A CASE FOR USING LIGHTER EQUIPTMENT
LEAD: A friend of mine recently developed a bad case of photographer's back.
This occupation-specific malady is brought on by lugging pounds of camera gear over hills, dales and city sidewalks.

Japan Kept Out Of U.S. Chips
LEAD: Whoever corners the world semiconductor market controls the engines of the information age.
So much is at stake, in fact, that the Reagan Administration is apparently willing to shield the American makers of computer chips at the expense of bending its free market principles.

A POLISH 'WOMAN FROM THE PROVINCES'
''A WOMAN FROM THE PROVINCES'' finally works almost in spite of itself.
The Polish movie, which will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art tonight at 9 and tomorrow at 6 P.M., creates a mosaic of a woman who did nothing more special than live out an arduous existence in a village.
It takes a while, but the director, Andrzej Baranski, finds the truth in the truism that every closely observed life is extraordinary.
His screenplay, based on a novel by Waldemar Sieminski, begins with Andzia at age 60 watching television in a comfortable house and relecting chattily on everyday pleasures.
We learn, in flashbacks, that she was widowed young and left with two babies; until late in life she had to do menial work to get by.
Andzia is a survivor, without histrionics.
Gradually, memories from a half-century come together to create this woman from the provinces.
The tone is as subdued as the faded and sometimes fuzzy color; for a stretch or two you may find yourself growing impatient, but the unhurried pace, the unpressured manner prove faithful to the material.

IMPROVING ON PERFECTION
LEAD: WHEN THE FIRST CD players were sounding off back in '83, their promoters proclaimed that perfection had been achieved.
Now it turns out that it was possible to improve on perfection.
That's lucky; for perfection is a final state, inherently static and terribly boring.
Imperfection is more fun.
It allows things to go on.


STORAGE SPACE, PRESHRUNK
LEAD: THEY are 10 inches high and 4 inches wide, are made of enameled steel and are replicas of gym lockers.
The miniature storage units, which come with a tiny padlock and set of keys, are meant to hold trinkets instead of sneakers and sweatsuits. ''They made me smile and particularly appealed to me because I work out,'' said Stephen Nitolo, manager of one of the shops that sell the little lockers.


CLUB IS RESTORING LUSTER TO NOTED ACTOR'S ROOMS

A BONE MARROW DONOR'S EXPERIENCE
LEAD: In response to the desperate need for bone marrow donors  [ ''Aiding the Search for Marrow Donors,'' Feb. 1 ] , I would like to explain what might seem quite frightening.

FEDERAL AGENCY REPORT RENEWS DEBATE ON VALUE OF A DOLLAR IN EDUCATION
LEAD: PARENTS who have scrimped to send their children to private schools or voted for higher taxes to improve their public school systems may be confused by the Education Department's recent statements discounting the value of the dollar in promoting student achievement.


ESPOSITO: IS HE GOOD FOR RANGERS?
LEAD: Evidently the pressure of not winning a Stanley Cup in so many years has brought about all this shuffling of the deck.
It is unfortunate that the Ranger G.M. and acting coach has so little faith in his club's scouting and youth development that he constantly feels that he must trade away anyone brought to him by that system.

Bruins 8, Kings 6: Ray Bourque fired a 60-foot slap shot for the winning goal with 29 seconds remaining yesterday.

Base Pains in Spain, and Elsewhere
LEAD: Haggling about military bases has all the joys of arm-wrestling on a sinking raft.
Global strategic interests get hopelessly mixed with angry regional disputes when dealing with NATO allies like Greece and Turkey.
Figuring fair compensation for Azores bases stirs argument in Portugal.
And things can go sour when democracies inherit base agreements signed by departed dictators, as in the Philippines.


SHEARSON, NIPPON LIFE MAKE PLANS
LEAD: In a sign of the kind of cooperation the two concerns expect to build, Shearson Lehman Brothers and the Nippon Life Insurance Company plan to set up a joint venture in London if their deal to sell 13 percent of Shearson to Nippon is approved, officials at the companies have said.


CABARET: NANCY LAMOTT
LEAD: CABARET singers who combine contemporary pop songs with vintage standards often find themselves on one or the other side of the fence.
Either they connect emotionally to the older material and are uncomfortable with the new or vice versa.
Nancy LaMott, who is appearing at Don't Tell Mama, 343 West 46th Street, on Friday and Saturday nights through April 11, seems equally at home in both camps.


Arms Control Agreements Are Not Defenses

Educated in New York
LEAD: Many a visitor to Paris is amazed by the variety of ways to order coffee.
There's un cafe, of course, and un grand and un demi.
But then there's au lait and creme, nature and express.
It all seems incomparably foreign.
And that, a newcomer to New York tells us, is exactly how she felt for weeks in the local deli at breakfast time.


TUCSON IN A GRASS-ROOTS BATTLE AGAINST ALLERGIES
LEAD: When Sam Lena moved from humid East Texas to arid Tucson 47 years ago to get away from his allergies he brought with him the seeds, or the pollen, as it were, of his own troubles.


TANGLED STRANDS: ANATOMY OF THE NEW YORK CITY SCANDAL
LEAD: A complicated, sometimes interlocking set of corruption investigations that began more than a year ago has implicated New York City, state and Federal officials, toppled political leaders and shaken the administration of Mayor Koch.
These cases are not all directly related, but together they provide a view of a government where influence was routinely traded and political allies became involved in secret business deals to reap profits at the taxpayers' expense.

MET OPERA: 'DIALOGUES OF THE CARMELITES'
LEAD: THE newest work in the Metropolitan Opera's repertory is Poulenc's solemn 30-year-old ''Dialogues of the Carmelites,'' and the production, by John Dexter, is one of its strongest - perhaps the strongest surviving emblem of the direction the house once seemed intent on taking, a direction far removed from the Zeffirelli-Ponnelle circus of recent months.

Get Behind Reagan on Arms Control

Margaret Whiting Opens at the Algonquin
LEAD: Among veteran pop singers who matured in the 1940's, Margaret Whiting has the singular gift of being absolutely clear, simple and direct about whatever she sings.

THAMES SAMPLER ON 13
LEAD: BACK in 1976, Britain's Thames Television pulled a publicity coup by pre-empting an entire week of prime time on New York station WOR, Channel 9. ''Thames on 9,'' as it was called, offered everything from ribald comedy to powerful drama.
The week provided an enviable sampling of product in a key marketplace for a company that, until then, had been known in this country primarily for the acclaimed documentary series ''The World at War.


MAGAZINE ON COUNTRY INNS READY
LEAD: JUST because the last of Gail Kent's four children went off to college this year does not mean that the big house in South Orange, N.J., is now an empty nest.
She has filled it with a magazine publishing enterprise.

LEAD: Senior officials of the Reagan Administration say the cost of aiding farmers has become such a burden to so many countries that the United States wants to push the problem to the top of the list of international economic issues to be negotiated this year.

LEAD: On the evening of May 13, 1978, four men entered the Dixie Furniture Store here, secured the showroom by forcing everyone to lie face down on the floor, and as they searched for cash, one of them shot and killed a police officer.


DANCE: ROBERT KOVICH
LEAD: ACCORDING to the program note, Robert Kovich's ''Multiple/Choice Crimes,'' which the Danspace Project presented Friday night at St.
Mark's Church, concerned three people who went into a trance, relived myths, returned to reality and revealed their peccadillos.
Although that note may indeed have summarized Mr.

'DO WHAT YOU DID LAST YEAR'
LEAD: ON the brown Naugahyde couch in a corner of Bill Parcells's office at Giants Stadium, a small pewter replica of the Super Bowl trophy rested on its side, unceremoniously and almost unseen.
In a clutter nearby were four ''Coach of the Year'' trophies and plaques that he has been awarded in recent weeks.


Education, Not Politics, in District 6
LEAD: New York City's public schools are in trouble partly because the central Board of Education tolerates too much patronage and politics by community school boards.
Welcome, therefore, Chancellor Nathan Quinones's suspension of a local board's powers following a report of its educational and administrative failures.


The Same Country?
LEAD: How is our Asian ally doing against a tenacious Communist insurgency?
Says a just-returned diplomat to Congress: The authorities are dealing ''realistically and effectively'' with the threat and the situation is ''very positive.'' Warns a Pentagon policymaker: The government has ''regrettably failed'' to develop a comprehensive counterinsurgency plan and ''distrust and apathy pervade civil-military relations.


A WINTER OF CROWDS AT MOVIES
LEAD: Led by ''Platoon,'' ''Outrageous Fortune,'' and such unstoppable 1986 movies as ''Crocodile Dundee'' and ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,'' the 1987 winter box office has been remarkable.
For six weeks in a row, ticket sales have set records for this time of year.


Picture Perfect
LEAD: A front-page article in SportsMonday last week portrayed Don Mattingly as a never-self-satisfied superstar driven by, even obsessed with, a quest for perfection at the plate.
Now here's another anecdote that underscores the point.

Gipper 1, Gators 0
LEAD: It's been a better season for the University of Florida basketball team than for Ronald Reagan, of course, but the President won in a blowout last Thursday night when six of the seven CBS affiliates in Florida and four in upstate New York declined to televise his news conference live, in favor of the Florida-Syracuse regional semifinal.


5 Seized in Paris Arms Raid
LEAD: Security agents arrested five people of Tunisian origin and seized arms, explosives and ammunition in a raid Saturday night, the Interior Ministry said today.

Bush Pledges Support to Ecuador After Quake
LEAD: Vice President Bush in Quito yesterday with a shipment of relief supplies.
Mr.
Bush, on a five-hour visit, promised support to the Ecuadorean Government, beleaguered after a series of earthquakes devastated the country's oil-producing eastern region on March 5.
At least 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were left homeless.


'FIGHT FOR LIFE,' ON ABC
LEAD: ''FIGHT FOR LIFE'' ponders a moral question: What does God want us to do?
It doesn't answer, of course -how could it? - although Jerry Lewis soliliquizes just like Tevye.
Mostly, though, the two-hour movie, on ABC at 9 o'clock tonight, wants to be heart-warming.
Intermittently, it is.


REPORT LINKS VW, BANKS
LEAD: A financial newsletter that reported in November that Volkswagen had lost large sums in currency transactions said Friday that some banks had circumvented banking regulations with help from Volkswagen's foreign-exchange department.
It did not name the banks.

Falwell Hints Short PTL Term
LEAD: The Rev.
Jerry Falwell said today that he may soon decide to give up leadership of the troubled PTL ministry.


Designated White House Savior
LEAD: Some Presidencies, like Lyndon Johnson's in Vietnam, failed through tragedies too deep for any individual to avert.
Others have gone awry through such egregious blunders that it seems an ounce of common sense in the President's ear would surely have saved him.
What if Presidents were to install not just a biographer, as Mr.


YUGOSLAV WARNS AGAINST STRIKES
LEAD: Prime Minister Branko Mikulic, facing widespread strikes and rising political dissent, was quoted today as saying the army would be used if necessary to defend the country's Communist political system.


AT THE MET, A PERFORMANCE BY THE FIRST LADY
LEAD: Nancy Reagan made her debut on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House last night.
She didn't sing.
She didn't need to.
Just by being there, she was the star of ''On Stage at the Met,'' a gala fund-raising dinner that took place on the stage of the opera house.


Cop Takes a Cop-Out
LEAD: Perhaps you believe that a grand jury, at the urging of a special prosecutor, has indicted Michael Deaver for peddling influence - specifically, for breaking the ethics in government law, which restricts former Government officials from immediately lobbying their ex-colleagues.


MANILA STRIVES TO TURN CORNER
LEAD: After three years of painful and destabilizing recession, the Philippine economy is showing signs of recovery, perhaps even an impending boom, economists and diplomats here say.


Calloway Did the Dishes

LEAD: She sat alone in the back of the room, watching intently as her husband began explaining how he had outcoached one of the nation's most respected coaches in Saturday's championship game of the Southeast Regional.


Murray's 'Mbizio Suite' At the Public Theater
LEAD: David Murray's ''Mbizio Suite for Johnny Dyani,'' billed as a concert-length work for strings, percussion and saxophone, had a disappointing premiere Monday at the Public Theater, which had commissioned it.
Its best parts were its least orchestral ones, partly because the 11-piece string section was ragged, and partly because the score itself seemed half-fledged and amorphous.


Outdoors; Aiming for Safety
LEAD: INSPIRED in part by the special deer seasons many states set aside for them, more and more hunters are going forth with muzzleloading rifles or smoothbores, and some of these nimrods aren't as familiar as they should be with their weapons or the sport of black-powder shooting itself.


INVOKING HARRIMAN, WESTCHESTER DEMOCRATS FORM A GROUP

LEAD: A Nicaraguan rebel spokesman says the contras may send a helicopter to get the body of a Canadian freelance journalist who was killed last week in fighting between the contras and Government troops in central Nicaragua.


Paul Plishka New Lead In 'Boris Godunov'
LEAD: It is easy to point out flaws in Mussorgsky's ''Boris Godunov,'' in much the same manner that one can find structural defects in the Himalayas, but there are few more majestic, epical, proud and terrible works in the repertory.
The Metropolitan Opera's current production of ''Boris'' has undergone several cast changes since its revival earlier this season.


SYRACUSE BLENDED TALENT AND RESOLVE
LEAD: As Greg Monroe sat and discussed his team, his eyes were focused straight ahead, his voice was quiet and his tone was serious.
To look at Monroe, he could have been discussing a routine practice on a dreary wintertime day at Syracuse University.
But early Saturday evening, he happened to be talking about a team that had quietly overcome its flaws to become one of the final four teams to remain in the national collegiate basketball tournament.


Clouds for a Skyline
LEAD: Like the Yankees, the Mets have artwork on their minds.
They say it has nothing to do with adopting a tri-state outlook and posing as the metropolitan-area baseball team in the wake of their World Series championship, but they would prefer a new corporate logo.
To them, the current one is just too cluttered: scripted ''Mets'' and baseball stitching superimposed on a likeness of the Brooklyn Bridge, with the crowded New


Tutu Appeals for Halt To the Guerrilla War
LEAD: Archbishop Desmond Tutu said tonight that he had made a personal appeal to black guerrilla leaders to halt their armed struggle in South Africa but held out little hope of a cease-fire.

STAGE: 'ONE NIGHT ONLY' SOHO PERFORMANCE AR

LEASEBACK DEAL AT OHIO EDISON
LEAD: The Ohio Edison Company said Friday that it had completed a $509 million sale and leaseback arrangement for 30 percent of its share of the Perry nuclear power plant.


Harlow Anecdotes
LEAD: Few people in Government in recent years have been as widely respected as Bryce Harlow, an adviser and confidant of Presidents and legislators of both parties for decades.
In the weeks since he died last month, Mr.
Harlow's friends have been swapping anecdotes about his humor, tact and, most of all, competence.

Baker was Senate majority leader, joined forces to run Ogilvy &amp; Mather Public Affairs, a Washington subsidiary of the national public relations firm of Ogilvy &amp; Mather.


DANCE: RISA JAROLSOW
LEAD: RISA JAROSLOW makes choreography an adventure.
One was never able to predict what would happen next in the works that Risa Jaroslow and Dancers performed Wednesday night at the Classic Stage Company, for Ms.
Jaroslow kept sending her dancers off in unexpected directions.
Yet one knew from the performers' intensity that every step mattered in these dances to music by Elliot Randall, Michael Galasso and a group called the Saqqara Dogs.

LEAD: Ted Bates Advertising, a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiary, has promoted Gordon Fenton, 45, and Robert L. Froelich, 49, executive vice presidents, to co-chief creative directors.


MUSIC: DINOS CONSTANTINIDES
LEAD: OF the several works by Dinos Constantinides that were played at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall Saturday afternoon, the most substantial was also the least interesting.
This was ''Intimations,'' a one-act opera based on a poem by David Madden.
This ''maybe she did, maybe she didn't'' tale of murder and frustration seemed shrill and rather sordid, learned but conventional in its musical Modernism, despite the expressive performances by Susan Faust Straley and Cynthia Dewey.


EXECUTIVES
LEAD: *
Atwood Richards Inc., a barter company, named Robert E. Levitan senior vice president, product remarketing and trading.


EXHAUSTED BURMA STRUGGLES IN ISOLATION

EXPANSION SELECTION: DIFFICULT DECISIONS
LEAD: Phoenix was here.
So was Memphis.
So were Oakland and Jacksonville and Sacramento and even Montreal.
All those cities want a National Football League franchise, and their representatives were here most of last week at the league meetings to make a pitch to the owners.


NIEKRO'S IMPRESSIVE OUTING COULD WIDEN YANKEES' OPTIONS
LEAD: Here is the problem: In a camp that was supposed to have a shortage of quality pitching, the Yankees find themselves thinking of some pleasant possibilities.
They have six starters throwing well and only five openings.


TRIAL NEAR IN PAKISTAN HIJACKING

Government at Work, Dept. of Trinkets
LEAD: Doling out trinkets and memorabilia is a longstanding practice at the White House and throughout the Government.
And rare is the recipient who does not like to show off his or her gift.


RALLY BEATS IOWA, 84-81
LEAD: Losing would have been a disappointment, but the prospect of being routed would have stung long after the college basketball season had ended and Jerry Tarkanian had chewed his last towel.
The Nevada-Las Vegas coach was aware of the doubts that critics have about his team: that the Runnin' Rebels play in a weak conference, are undisciplined and will invariably end their season somewhere short of that magic kingdom known as the Final


'ANGRY' JOHNSON FINES STRAWBERRY $1,500

AMBACH JOINS SCHOOL GROUP
LEAD: Gordon M. Ambach, who resigned last July as New York State Commissioner of Education, has accepted a post as executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, the professional organization of state education commissioners and superintendents.
The council, which is based in Washington, develops positions on major education issues and lobbies for them with Congress and Federal agencies.


Buffaloed Bisons
LEAD: You can say this for Jim Valvano: Even in the face of season-ending defeat, the North Carolina State basketball coach loses neither his perspective nor his humor.
Right after the Wolfpack was eliminated by Florida from this year's national tournament, Valvano allowed that things could have been worse, and indeed had been.


CONCERT: 6 COMPOSITIONS BY MA SHUI-LONG
LEAD: THE music of East and West is divided by common materials following opposite paths.

Milking It in Cowtown
LEAD: If you're among the hordes who plan to visit Calgary for the Winter Games next February, you have a problem: A large number of hoteliers there are acting as if you've just struck gold and they want a piece of the take.
In addition to demanding as much as two and a half times the usual room rates, many hotels are insisting on minimum-stay Olympic bookings so lengthy that guests who comply will be all but qualified to vote in the local elections by the time their reservations expire.


Music Noted in Brief; Alicia de Larrocha Performs 'Carnaval'
LEAD: ''Carnaval'' has been a frequent visitor to New York piano recitals this season, and brilliant and generous of spirit as Schumann's music is, it has come fairly close to wearing out its welcome.


THE WHOLESALE DRUG INDUSTRY

One of the brightest spots, analysts say, is the wholesale drug distribution business.


DISPUTE GROWS ON EX-SAILORS' HOME

The furor that followed has been an enduring one, as new revelations about the inner workings of the city's political structure continue to emerge.


ARCHITECTURE: LE CORBUSIER EXHIBITION IN LONDON
LEAD: Le Corbusier never built a building in England.
Yet his influence in this country far exceeded that in France, where he lived for most of his adult life.
Far more than any English architect, Le Corbusier shaped postwar English architecture.
So it is fitting, if more than a little surprising, that in this centennial year of his birth it is here and not in


MORE SUSPECTS ARE SOUGHT IN CONSTRUCTION BOSS DEATH
LEAD: The Nassau County police, who have arrested a wealthy Long Island real-estate developer in the murder of one of his former construction supervisor, are searching for ''two or possibly three'' other suspects and are likely to make more arrests this week, a police spokesman said yesterday.


MILITANT SHIITES' ROLE IN SOUTH LEBANON GROWS
LEAD: The growing military strength of Islamic fundamentalists in southern Lebanon appears to be resulting in power struggles among Shiite Moslems there and increasing attacks on the buffer-zone militiamen who act as Israel's proxy.


AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT MOVES
LEAD: At first the mannequin in the window of the Gallery of Wearable Art in SoHo is still, its eyes staring blankly onto the street.
But passers-by are likely to do a double take.
The mannequin changes poses from right to left.
It pivots, it dances, it sways its flowing blond hair from shoulder to shoulder.

HIGH-STAKES BINGO COMES TO EVERGLADES

MUSIC: BAROQUE OPERA
LEAD: SMALL opera in New York usually means a troupe of worthy amateurs and semi-professionals banded together to present a work that might not otherwise be heard, and one is willing to overlook certain flaws of execution for this spirit of adventure.
Concert Royal and the New York Baroque Dance Company, who presented Handel's ''Terpsicore'' and Rameau's ''Pygmalion'' at the Marymount Manhattan Theater

Now, 26 Questioners
LEAD: The decision by the Senate and House committees investigating the Iran-Nicaragua affair to meld their investigations and hold joint hearings has been widely applauded.
It seems likely to avoid what Daniel K. Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat who heads the Senate panel, has called ''an un-seemly competition for headlines'' between the two committees.


Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''The answer to the terrorism of the left and the right is not social and economic reform but police and military action.''  - President Corazon C. Aquino  of the Philippines.  [ A1:6. ]


On the Ledeen Case
LEAD: Although it found no evidence to support it, the Tower Commission, in its report last month, published a memorandum written by Lieut.

DOUBT CAST ON TOWER PANEL FINDING
LEAD: The Tower Commission's general counsel, elaborating on the report's findings on the financing of the Iran arms sales, said today that the commission had no evidence that Adnan M. Khashoggi, a Saudi businessman, received duplicate payments.


FILM HISTORY BEING LOST BY OVERSIGHT AND PLAN
LEAD: When thousands of blueprints for sets of old M-G-M movies were destroyed a few weeks ago, it was by accident.
Through carelessness and sometimes by design, the movie industry is being robbed of much of its history each year.


Murray Goes for Pros
LEAD: Kevin Murray, the quarterback who led Texas A&amp;M to Southwest Conference championships and Cotton Bowl appearances the last two seasons, announced he would forgo his final year of eligibility and make himself available for this spring's National Football League draft.

With All Deliberate Impropriety
LEAD: Imagine the outcry if a Supreme Court Justice were caught feeding inside information from the Court to the Justice Department lawyer in an explosive case, something like abortion.

A Woman's Right
LEAD: To the Editor:


Texaco Offers New Evidence

FILM: 'BLIND DATE,' A COMEDY BY BLAKE EDWARDS
LEAD: THE perfect gag, as orchestrated with supreme professionalism by Blake Edwards, is something that proceeds in stages.
It has a beginning, a middle, an end, and maybe even a postscript or two.
The beginning is the anticipatory stage, as when Bruce Willis, playing the man in ''Blind Date'' who falls in love with a woman who should never drink, is seen with a hypodermic syringe, some whisky and a box of chocolates.


'WITHNAIL AND I,' A COMEDY
THE place is London, where the swinging 1960's are coming to an end.
Nearly gone is the decade of ''The Yellow Submarine,'' ''Hair,'' dropping out and turning on (preferably with money from home or an idependent income), of ''Oh!
Calcutta!'' Mary Quant, free love, public sex, booze, ''Blow-Up,'' pills to soar on and pills for the descent.
For a favored few, the 60's were one long time out.
For even fewer, they were something to recycle and celebrate in music, movies and plays, as well as in the journalese of the new journalism.
For the rest, much of what identified the period as the 60's existed in another dimension.
One was aware that something special was happening, even though a lot of it was invisible to the naked eye.

I know.
It was a long time ago, but still as clear as yesterday, that, after two years of pleading, rejection, waiting, hoping and much embarrassing discussion about my sex life (what was the matter with them, I have two natural children), we were finally awarded a 3-day-old girl.

MAKING IT CHILD'S PLAY

WAKING FROM A FASCIST YOUTH An Italian Story. By Dan Vittorio Segre. 273 pp. Bethesda, Md.: Adler &amp; Adler. $16.95.    ITALIAN Jewry, the most ancient of the Western Diaspora communities, remains still too little known outside of the peninsula itself. Of late, however, as the result of translations of works by several notable authors - among them Primo Levi, Giorgio Bassani and Natalia Ginzburg - readers in this country have been given a glimpse into some compelling moments in the recent lives of Italian Jews. With his own translation of his ''Memoirs of a Fortunate Jew,'' published in Italy in 1985, Dan Vittorio Segre opens up one of the more fascinating chapters in the history and culture of his countrymen, even as he chronicles the story of his departure from them.   Today a professor of Zionism and Jewish political thought at Haifa University in Israel, Mr. Segre was born the son of a wealthy Jewish landowner in the Piedmont. The time of his birth was auspicious, for it coincided with a constellation of national and political tendencies that, at first glance, strikes the reader as bizarre: ''I never entered into the Mussolini regime - I was born into it. As a totally assimilated Jew and as an Italian raised under a political regime of which my family and all my friends approved without any reservation I, too, saw Fascism as the only natural form of existence.'' As Mr. Segre recounts his story, it becomes clear that an idyllic Fascism was not, in fact, to be his lot any more than it was to be his country's, and at the age of 16, in 1939, he abandoned Mussolini's Italy for Palestine. How and why he came to make this move and what awaited him in its aftermath form the heart of his engaging narrative.   To understand his story, one needs to look back to the 19th century and to the place of the Jews in the political history of Italy. During the crucial decades of the Risorgimento, the Jews of Italy gave unreserved support to the policy of national unification. In Mr. Segre's words, they rightly saw themselves as ''the founding fathers of a new nation'' and typically ''felt more Italian than the Italians.'' Convinced that nationalism would bring an end to centuries of discrimination, they enthusiastically embraced the new movement. It would have been inconceivable to these ardent Jewish patriots that the country to which they had given so much of themselves and into which they had seemingly been received as equals would, only a short time later, chase them out of their own homes. That, though, is precisely what was to occur, for with the institution of the racial laws of 1938 the Jews found themselves suddenly disenfranchised. Their shock at this betrayal was profound. Looking back at events, Mr. Segre came to realize that, for all of his early illusions about having a ''normal and carefree'' life under Fascism, he had ''lived in the belly of the monster, totally unaware of its existence.''   Although he came from an anti-Zionist home, the young Mr. Segre embarked almost immediately for Palestine and for a way of life for which he was not in the least prepared. Many of his most vivid pages describe his feelings of uprootedness and estrangement in a country and a culture that were alien to him. Lacking solid connections to any ancestral Judaism or to the newer collectivist ideologies of Zionism, the author saw himself ''in exile in the motherland to which  [ he ]  had chosen to return.'' He joined a kibbutz, then left it for studies at an agricultural school. A short time later he joined the Palestine Regiment of the British Army and served for six years in an intelligence unit, much of the time in Jerusalem.   The world he came to know in these early, difficult years of resettlement was one ''of frenetic action, without reserves or counterweights, with no hiding places for the soul.'' Whatever else life may have been like in Palestine, it was anything but dull: ''From the setting of the sun until dawn, the entire Yishuv  [ the Jewish settlement ]  did nothing but argue.'' Mr. Segre's accounts of this clamorous life and of the people who composed it -British soldiers and colonial administrators, city Arabs and Bedouins, secular and religious Zionists, Jewish pietists and apostates - are richly drawn, as is his account of his own bewilderment as a young Italian romantic displaced into a human landscape roiling with intense competition of egos and ideologies of every sort. ''Nobody,'' he writes, ''and first and foremost myself, knew exactly who I was.''   To bring some clarity out of so much confusion is the challenge of every work of autobiographical reconstruction. Mr. Segre takes up the challenge by reaching back into his past in an effort to explore the many sides of a single, troubling question, one that awoke in him during the years of his youth in Fascist Italy and accompanied him to Palestine: is it possible to comprehend someone else's anguish, share someone else's sorrow and pain? DISTURBED by what he regards as his coldness or indifference to the sufferings of others, Mr. Segre engages in sustained reflection about the turbulent and sometimes tortured lives of his parents, his friends and lovers, his native and adopted lands.   Along the way, in tones alternately humorous and serious, he comes face to face with some wrenchingly difficult truths about himself, foremost among them his abiding sense of isolation and inner estrangement. The insights that he manages to gain as he recalls some of his more poignant encounters with family and country, religion and politics, sexuality and morality, self and other are of a high order and indicate a maturing grasp of the world's complexities. By the book's end, the author has succeeded in making sense out of what otherwise would appear to be so much contradictory experience, and he comes to learn, if only in rare moments of shared experience, that life ''is stronger than evil.'' Such knowledge, in a book that registers moments of profound alienation and pain, is no small achievement. That Mr. Segre has been able to accomplish so much in a story filled with significant historical as well as personal detail is everyone's gain.

In Defense Of the Black Market
LEAD: It is hardly by chance that Mario Vargas Llosa described the life of Hernando de Soto, the theoretician of the market, and not the life of the practitioners, the street vendors of Peru.

ADDING A CENTRAL VACUUM CLEANING SYSTEM TO THE HOUSE
LEAD: ALTHOUGH the ideal time to install a central vacuum cleaning system is while the house is under construction, many homeowners do not realize that it is practical to install a system in an existing house.

AN INVITING SITUATION, BUT WHOSE TURN IS IT?

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  STORIES WE LISTENED TO.
By John Haines. (Bench Press, 408 Haverford Place, Swarthmore, Pa., 19081, Cloth, $16; Paper, $8.) To the question ''Why on earth would anyone want to live in the wilderness?'' John Haines provides a lyrical answer in this short book of essays about life in Alaska.
His is not the ooh-and-ah prose of travel writing, or the macho rhythm of outdoor magazines or even the Linnaean detail of nature books.

DELICATE FLAVOR OF MAPLE ENHANCES THE DESSERT MENU
LEAD: AMONG the annual rites of spring is the flow of sap in the sugar maples.
Although it is not an important event in this immediate locality, maple-sugaring represents a substantial industry in upstate New York, New England and Canada.
A few weeks ago the Canadians in the province of Quebec were concerned that an extended spell of unseasonably cold weather might hinder or delay the maple-sugaring season.


SLEEK AND SUITED FOR ACTION
LEAD: BATHING SUITS COULD ONCE be easily classified as either athletic or chic.

Exotic Abundance From the Amazon
LEAD: When Ana Maria Martins decided to open a restaurant that serves the best of Amazon cooking, she began her search for recipes in the heart of the Brazilian rain forest, not far from Belem.

ARMS TALKS HAVE IMPACT ON MUCH MORE THAN WEAPONRY
LEAD: THE Soviet-American relationship is tethered to arms control.
The range of compromise and cooperation in trade, human rights, cultural and scientific exchange, third world conflicts and other areas is defined by the negotiations to contain the nuclear arms race.
The prospect of an arms accord increases the possible range.

No Headline
LEAD: ON THE SATURDAY BEFORE THE final week of the Baby M trial in New Jersey, I went to visit Noel Keane, the lawyer who had arranged the contested contract in that case.
He was doing business as usual, which meant that his comfortable two-story offices in Dearborn, Mich., were full of prospective surrogate mothers, often with husbands and babies in tow, and infertile couples who had come to check out the candidates for surrogacy.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  OSCAR DEAREST: Six Decades of Scandal, Politics and Greed Behind Hollywood's Academy Awards 1927-1986.
By Peter H. Brown and Jim Pinkston. (Perennial Library/Harper &amp; Row, Paper, $12.95.) As a national ritual dutifully observed by millions, the annual Academy Awards telecast ranks somewhere between New Year's Eve and ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.


Paterno's Rose Fever
LEAD: SPENDING the winter celebrating a national football championship can apparently take its toll on a coach and his players.

LEAD: With the new White House team promoting cooperation and its leader outfitted with what his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, called ''a new agenda,'' President Reagan took to the road last week on the first legs of a drive intended to turn public attention to domestic policy and away from the Iran-contra scandals.


Martinique
LEAD: To the Editor: The article on Martinique (Travel, Feb. 1) brought back happy memories of a stay some years ago.
But Virginie F. and George A. Elbert didn't do justice to St.-Pierre.

James M. Molyneux of Richmond Hill, Queens.


OF RESEARCH AND REPUTATION
LEAD: In what has been described as a battle between the haves and the have nots, the academic community is debating how Federal money should be awarded for building and renovating university research facilities.
Should Congress continue its current practice of giving the money directly to universities, without a review of the scientific merit of the proposals, or should schools compete for the money on the basis of their reputations as research institutions?


AIDS Curbs in Prague
LEAD: The youth newspaper Mlada Fronta reported today that 27 people infected with the AIDS virus have been told to make pledges regarding their sexual conduct, including a promise to use condoms.
The article did not say who had required the promises or what action would be taken if anyone refused to sign or violated a pledge.


Capitalizing On a Name

Verbatim; Homeless Generation
LEAD: 'When I read in your report that there are 11,000 children in hotels and shelters, half of whom are under age five, my feeling was confirmed that unless we do something to change their living conditions soon, we will have created an entire generation of disaffected and angry young people.'  - David N.

Keeping City Jail System Afloat
LEAD: New York City's need for more jail space was illustrated as never before last week by the lengths to which the city is prepared to go to get it.


Pandora's Box
LEAD: To the multitude of modern problems afflicting today's Africa - debt, apartheid, guerrilla warfare - add the resurgence of a very old one: religious violence.
In recent weeks, the continent's two most populous countries, Nigeria and Egypt, have experienced deadly Moslem-Christian clashes.
Defusing these potentially explosive conflicts is now an urgent government priority in both Lagos and Cairo.


ITALY ASKS VATICAN EXTRADITION
LEAD: Italy has asked the Vatican to extradite an American Archbishop and two colleagues charged with being accessories to fraudulent bankruptcy.

The report said:


MARKETING WEST GERMAN ARMS
LEAD: THE issue was illicit arms shipments to an embargoed country, and a legislative commission held hearings.
Some witnesses -Government employees and industry executives - simply could not remember key events; the head of Government said he was unaware of any wrongdoing, and his senior foreign policy aide said he had not bothered to read a key contract that lay on his desk for months before he fed it into a shredder.

LEAD: WHAT is it exactly that Appleby and Pitt do?


Trading in an 'Under-the-Counter' Fund
LEAD: MOST of the money going into the bull market has chased blue chips.
Thus, the oldest mutual fund investing in obscure companies, the Over-the-Counter Securities Fund, run by the Wellington Management Company in Boston, rose just 4.7 percent in 1986, against a robust 18.6 percent return for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.


A REPORT ON THE VACATION'S EFFORTS
LEAD: MY vacation slides shot with the Canon EOS 650 are back and, to answer my own question of two weeks ago, they generally came out as advertised.
The exposures are consistent and the focus is right on the money.
If I had it all to do over again, however, I would use the camera's exposure-bias feature to program in a consistent half-stop underexposure.


June Bingham Marries Robert B. Birge
LEAD: June Rossbach Bingham and Robert Bowen Birge were married yesterday in the Edgehill Church at Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx.

Charleston
LEAD: On March 22, 1816, a young Sea Island cotton planter wrote to a friend that Charleston's inhabitants were ''vying with each other'' in the splendor and number of their parties and that there was ''scarce a night for many weeks past on which the sound of the fiddle has not been heard.''


OLD SYNAGOGUE DENIED ELEVATOR BID
LEAD: A landmark synagogue on Gramercy Park South has been denied city approval for its plan to add an outside elevator for the elderly and the handicapped.


AN OPERA? NO, IT'S A (GASP!) SET
LEAD: THE ''BAYREUTH HUSH,'' THE REVERENTIAL, all but palpable silence that prevails during performances in the Wagnerian shrine known as the Festspielhaus, is part of operatic legend.
Well, don't be jealous, New York.

MCENROE DOMINATES JARRYD IN SEMIFINAL
LEAD: John McEnroe, playing with a tender hip, reached the final of the $315,000 Belgian Indoor Tennis Championships today by defeating an off-form Anders Jarryd of Sweden, 6-3, 6-3.


CONCERT: JOYCE LINDORFF, HARPSICHORD
LEAD: THE revival of the harpsichord early in this century, by Wanda Landowska and others, was naturally most important for the performance of 18th-century music.
But a fascinating side effect was the cultivation of new repertory for the instrument.
This is not a tendency that petered out as French neo-Classicism ebbed.


ADDING A CENTRAL VACUUM CLEANING SYSTEM TO THE HOUSE
LEAD: ALTHOUGH the ideal time to install a central vacuum cleaning system is while the house is under construction, many homeowners do not realize that it is practical to install a system in an existing house.
In fact, an increasingly large number of these systems are being installed each year, many of them by do-it-yourselfers.


CLASSES IN VERMONT: SCIENCE AND TALKING ABOUT IT
LEAD: Dressed in patched jeans and a chamois shirt, his wool cap set at a rakish angle, Mark Gershman muscles an earth auger into a hole in the ice on a beaver pond.
Clustered around him on the melting ice are a handful of colleagues who shout their approval as he hauls up the auger.
Mr.
Gershman has struck dirt.


TECHNOLOGY STEALS THE THUNDER
LEAD: MARSHALL McLuhan's famous description of television, ''the medium is the message,'' could be applied as easily to popular music.
In the last 50 years - and especially since the mid-1960's - changing technology has altered the form, shape, scale and even the meaning of popular music.
Increasingly, its subject has become the ambiguous relationship between people and machines.


O'MEARA, SIMPSON ARE TIED WITH 202
LEAD: Ben Crenshaw, winner of last week's USF&amp;G Classic in New Orleans, said that the rainy weather conditions this week ''have taken the sting out of the golf course,'' and that's one reason such low scores were being shot in the 14th annual Tournament Players Championship.

ABOUT LONG ISLAND
LEAD: TAKING the first steps down a long, steep flight of stairs the other day, I was visited by a vision of catastrophe, a presentiment of peril, a frisson of fear.
I saw myself tripping and falling and breaking my front teeth.


A FEVERISH PROPOSAL
LEAD: NEUROPSYCHOPHARMA-cologists and other kill-joys have been looking into the pathology of spring fever, and it turns out that the world may be on the verge of a clinical breakthrough: a simple therapy by which even the most obdurately contented of spring fever victims may be brought back to reality, miraculously restored to his or her normal complex of twitches and neurotic anxieties.


In Defense Of the Black Market
LEAD: While walking up Broadway the other day, I realized that Mario Vargas Llosa's article on thriving black markets does not apply solely to third-world countries like Peru.


DANCE: JOANNA HAIGOOD
LEAD: JOANNA HAIGOOD, a dancer and choreographer from San Francisco, came quietly into town on Wednesday for a performance at the Theater of the Riverside Church that kept the audience in its seats well after she had taken her last bow.
No one, it seemed, wanted to leave.
Ms.
Haigood is a rare performer, and the solos she presented captured not only her own remarkable qualities but a sense of the joy of moving and of her trust in the audience's intelligence and similar sense of pleasure.


U.S. JEWS AND ISRAELIS: A QUESTION OF IDENTITY
LEAD: IN the last few weeks there has been an unusually high level of tension between some American Jews and some Israeli Jews.
Underlying their debate is the fact that as much as they have in common, they often interpret the meaning of Jewish history and the significance of the state of Israel in very different terms.


REFUTATIONS SWING IN AN ENDLESS CYCLE
LEAD: DESPITE the breaking of many lances, it is extraordinary how little can be conclusively established regarding the major opening systems.
There are just so many possibilities, so many branching-off points in so many byways, that it would be unwarranted conceit to condemn this or that defense as refuted or unplayable.


Syracuse and Indiana to Vie for N.C.A.A. Title
LEAD: Rony Seikaly of Syracuse and Jacek Duda of Providence fighting for a rebound as Derrick Coleman looked on during tournament semifinal.
Syracuse won, 77-63, and will face Indiana, which beat Nevada-Las Vegas, 97-93, for the N.C.A.A. championship tomorrow.

HOW WILL THE METS AND YANKS DO IN 1987?
LEAD: I think the Mets can do as well in '87 as they did in '86.
The big question is the pitching: Will it be as consistent?

They have their same great players plus Dave Magadan and Kevin McReynolds.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD:  BOLT.
By Dick Francis. (Putnam, $17.95.)

Just the Tickets
LEAD: THERE are no cheering crowds or preferred parking places for Earl Campbell at the University of Texas these days, but the former running back, who won the 1977 Heisman Trophy and went on to an outstanding pro career, is enduring the one and paying dearly for the latter.

TOO MANY LAWS, NOT ENOUGH NEED
LEAD: IN a recent article on the proliferation of senseless, useless and meaningless bills that impede the legislative process in Hartford and impose heavy costs on the taxpayers, one word leaped out at me.
The word ''only.'' The sentence: Lieut.
Gov.
Joseph J. Fauliso ''noted that 4,844 bills had been introduced in the 1981 session and only 547 became law.


WHAT MAKES LIFE WORTH WRITING?
LEAD: THE popularity of biographies continues to bewilder me.

That was, in fact, their problem.

Cable Television

STRIVING FOR A BETTER RELATIONSHIP
LEAD: THE PATIENT WAS IN EARLY MIDDLE AGE, in fairly good health.
He had also reached a point of familial contentment that had led him to seek out a vasectomy.

The move would allow B.P. a greater foothold for development of American oil and gas resources, but analysts note it also would further concentrate B.P.

LEAD: WHEN ''THE MUSICAL Comedy Murders of 1940'' went into rehearsal at the Circle Repertory Company, the playwright and director, John Bishop, set up a chart with colloquialisms from the period.

LEAD: ITrrxh was not only the Supreme Court's most sweeping endorsement of affirmative action after nine years of agonizing, splintering and seesawing on the issue.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING: SEEKING A SOLUTION
LEAD: Bishop McGann is right to be concerned about the lack of affordable housing, more properly called cheap housing  [ ''Affordable Housing Is a Basic Human Right,'' Opinion Page ] .

TODAY'S COLLEGE ATHLETES FACE A NEW SORT OF TEST
LEAD: A FULL season has passed since the cocaine-induced death of Len Bias, the University of Maryland's all-American basketball star.

NICOTINE: HARDER TO KICK...THAN HEROIN

LEAD:  To the Sports Editor:


SENATE RACE IS BEGINNING TO WARM UP

KEEPING PACE WITH GARBAGE FACTS
LEAD: An Opinion Page article  [ ''We'll Drown in Garbage Unless. . .,'' March 1 ]  by a retired solid waste engineer for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation who has not kept pace with the times contained information that was out-of-date and incorrect.


GARDENING A NEW APPROACH TO LAWN CARE IS GAINING GROUND
LEAD: IT'S lawn time again.
Spring usually brings out the fervor of lawn keepers.
They dream of having the greenest one on the block and proceed with vigor spawned by an acute case of cabin fever.
And neighbors, having been inside for the winter, are outdoors again with garden tools in hand.


Static and Discord In the World Of TV Evangelism
LEAD: In the book of Matthew, Jesus tells his disciples of the prophecies that must be fulfilled before he returns to save the planet.
Among the events that are to precede a Second Coming are earthquakes, famines, nation rising against nation, and the preaching of the gospel to each of the world's inhabitants.


A NAZI PAST AND THE PRESENT
LEAD: FOR more than 30 years, Karl Linnas, who is now 67 years old, lived quietly on Long Island, supporting himself as a draftsman.
Before that, according to the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, Mr.

'KILLER BARS' ELUDE MASSACHUETTS NET
LEAD: IN 1982, as legislatures, courts and the police nationwide were moving to punish drunken drivers, Massachusetts legislators tried a novel tack: They passed a law requiring judges to ask those convicted of drunken driving where they had had their last drink.
The bars most often mentioned would be investigated by the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission and, if they habitually sold drinks to intoxicated people, would be fined or even shut.


Defeated Libyans Fleeing in Chad
LEAD: Chad, a sparsely populated vastness of Saharan desert and African savanna, has been a battlefield for factions armed and aided mainly by Libya and France for nearly all the 26 years since General de Gaulle declared its ''independence'' in 1960.
Last week, French-backed forces of President Hissen Habre announced sweeping victories over Libyans and their poorly trained Islamic Legion.


'Past Tense,' Cocteau and Opium
LEAD:  To the Editor:


SCULPTURE AS A HIGH-WIRE PERFORMANCE
LEAD: THE SCULPTURE OF NANCY Graves has for some years divided opinion the way Moses divided the Red Sea.
There are those who prize it as a source of endless and rewarding astonishment, and there are those who find it contrived, inept, affected, flimsy and arguably not sculpture at all.
Between the two camps, lines are clearly drawn and never crossed.


Resolving Contractor Disputes
LEAD: WATER is dripping from the skylight, the tiles are the wrong shade of blue and, although the job was supposed to be completed by November, it is almost April and the work still is not done.


WHERE TO HELP GROWING HUNGER NEEDS
LEAD: ''Soup Kitchens and Pantries Feed Growing Numbers of the Hungry'' (Feb. 22) by Betsy Brown was praiseworthy coverage of the serious and puzzling problem of growing hunger needs in Westchester County.
Many people have expressed an interest in doing something about it.
There was an unfortunate omission of information of where to send contributions.


The Japanese Interments
LEAD:  To the Editor:


ITALIAN FARE WITH A SPECIAL TOUCH
LEAD: HAD I been recognized?
When the owner of La Caravella restaurant in Hicksville invited our table to tour the kitchen, that was my first thought.
But friends who dined at the restaurant on another night were also given the kitchen tour, as were two tables of strangers.
It was not recognition but pride that prompted the owner's invitation.

A YOUNG HARPIST'S TWO WORLDS
LEAD: NAOKO YOSHINO'S school friends did not know for many years that she played the harp.

But when she won a harp contest in Jerusalem at the age of 18, her friends began coming to hear her play.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: HE'S the newest head of the senior league, so it's only appropriate that Bart Giamatti should begin his first season as president of the National League by throwing out the first pitch for baseball's oldest team.
He'll do that April 6 when the Cincinnati Reds open at home against the Montreal Expos.


Of Koch's Power To Sway Cities
LEAD: SOME 1,500 municipal officials at a convention of the National League of Cities in San Antonio gave Mayor Koch a standing ovation in November after he urged the group to declare war on narcotics.

Buildings Commissioner Charles M. Smith Jr. called it ''early Robinson Crusoe.''


IS TV TEMPERING DERRING-DO?
LEAD: IT'S PERMISSIBLE TO WONDER about Dodge Morgan.
It's not that he wanted to sail around the world alone; it's not that he left his wife and two children at home for five months while he did.
We understand all that.
An adventure is an adventure, and no one holds it against Odysseus, say, because he skipped around for years while Penelope worked at a loom.


Willful Evasions
LEAD: Ignorance was perhaps the least likely of mitigating circumstances Robert B. Anderson might have raised in his defense against tax evasion charges.
Mr.
Anderson, who last week pleaded guilty to bank fraud and evading taxes on about $127,500 in income, was Secretary of the Treasury from 1957 to 1961.

CANADA WANTS OFF THE BACK BURNER
LEAD: WHEN Vice President Bush visited Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in Ottawa in January, more than one Canadian newspaper columnist pointed out that Mr.

It was a symbolic detail for many Canadians, who often complain that American leaders are woefully ill-informed about their northern neighbor.


Aquino Goes for Military Victory
LEAD: The olive branch did not work, Corazon C. Aquino said, so she is taking up the sword against leftist insurgents and rightist terrorists.

MUSIC: GOLDEN FLEECE
LEAD: FRIDAY'S four stage offerings by the Golden Fleece company at the Tomi Theater explored the pros and cons of music's new-found conservatism.
This is a small company known primarily for presenting the brand new, yet all of these works - for better and for worse - were really recent explorations of some very familiar ways of writing music.


Brecht-Weill, 1931
LEAD:  THE THREEPENNY OPERA  The Brecht-Weill adaptation of John Gay's ''Beggar's Opera.'' Black-and-white 1931 film directed by G.W.

Profits Have a Place in Philanthropy
LEAD: AS THE 200th birthday of the Constitution approaches, questions are being raised about a marketing technique - cause-related marketing - that increasingly is becoming a major means of bankrolling such public celebrations.

MEREDITH MONK AND PING CHONG: IN TRANSIT AGAIN
LEAD: AS SPIRALS OF PIANO THIRDS curl around her voice, Meredith Monk sings a crystal-sharp melody in micro-intervals and watches a dozen performers moving around the rehearsal space.
It is the first ''shlonk-through,'' as she calls it, for a revival of ''The Travelogue Series,'' a collaboration with fellow experimental-theater artist Ping Chong, and she is doing triple duty as co-director, performer and stand-in for a missing singer.


HOW WILL THE METS AND YANKS DO IN 1987?
LEAD: Don't bet on a Subway Series in 1987.
Although the Mets and Yankees will win their share of games, I don't expect either to win their division.
The Mets won't win because of complacency and inconsistency; the Yankees because of lack of depth (especially pitching) and Righetti's burnout.
JUDY GOLDBERG


Athletes and the Pressure to Perform

The anxiety disorders include panic disorder (which may progress to agoraphobia) and social phobia (which, in a discrete form, manifests as performance anxiety).


Pop Music
LEAD: In a fast, loud, edgy, messy city, New York rock bands fight back with speed and noise and dissonance and more than a little humor.

CLEANING THE HOUSE: SO MUCH WORK FOR SO LITTLE RESPECT
LEAD: LAST summer my 20-year-old daughter gave me an unsolicited discount when I hired her to clean my Fire Island house on a weekly basis.

FOR WEST GERMANY, AN EASTWARD TUG
LEAD: THE political course of West Germany, the continental pivot of the Atlantic alliance, looks like it will be influenced by two important factors in the coming months.
One is the palpable weakness of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Government, notably in its dealings with restless state barons of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, and the other is a sudden warming of Bonn's relations with Moscow and East Berlin.

Driving through a neighborhood where economic decay and vigor appear in equal parts - a fuel-oil company is well-kept across from a vacant one-story brick building - before you know it, you are upon this little masonry jewel, a burnt brown riot of pressed and shaped brick, chimneys with spiral designs, stepped gables and round-bottomed roof tiles.

See No Evil in Albany
LEAD: Manfred Ohrenstein, the Democratic minority leader of the New York State Senate, says he sees nothing wrong in padding the legislative payroll with ''no show'' staff members who work exclusively on political campaigns.

BUDDY EBSEN AND JOEY CRAMER STAR IN 'STONE FOX'
LEAD: LAST week on NBC, Britain's cheeky ''Spitting Image'' puppets did a spoof of the Academy Awards.
When the ceremonies began, most of the audience promptly decided to take a nap until the action really started, around the time the presenters got to the Best Actress nominations.

OPERA: VICKERS IN 'SAMSON ET DALILA'
LEAD: CAMILLE SAINT-SAENS'S ''Samson et Dalila'' is an opera of earnest purpose and drastically uneven inspiration, plausible in the hands of an extraordinary tenor whose identification with the hero can transcend the ordinariness of his music and a mezzo-soprano who can seize the opportunities of three great arias that stand out like oases in the score.


The Citrus Shuffle
LEAD: In the Grapefruit League, there are squeeze plays that have nothing to do with a bunt.
They're maneuvers of major league clubs wanting to wrest new spring homes for themselves.
Either the team fakes the hit-and-run and gets its host community to spiff up or replace its training complex, or it does run and scores a new complex in another town, which can expect to pay upward of $5 million for construction.


LYLE WINS T.P.C. IN PLAYOFF

LEAD: ''TOMORROW and Tomorrow,'' as played by the Center for Contemporary Opera at the Henry Street Settlement Saturday night, returns to the original intentions of opera's creators more than 300 years ago.

FOR MARY ALICE, 'FENCES' HAS A UNIVERSAL THEME
LEAD: For 18 years she has built her life around him, loving him, serving him, making a home for him, raising their sons.

Arm Afghans, Balance the Rest
LEAD: It's not hard to guess why Soviet planes flown by Afghan pilots are striking across the border at Pakistan.
The aim is intimidation.
By raising the stakes in its eight-year war in Afghanistan, Moscow hopes to impel Pakistan to accept its peace terms.
That would mean cutting off all outside aid to Afghan insurgents and giving 115,000

HUSSEIN IS SAID TO REBUFF U.S.
