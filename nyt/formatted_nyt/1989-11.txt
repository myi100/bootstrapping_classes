LEAD: Ian Millar, lanky and professorial and the perennial shepherd of the Canadian National Team's most promising show jumpers, is tall enough that Puissance walls do not dwarf him.

DIALOGUE: Reinventing City Government  Charter Revision: Yes or No?; It's Urban Paralysis.
LEAD: New York City needs a strong, streamlined government to deal with the challenges it faces in the next decade.
Problems like building drug rehabilitation centers, cutting budgets, housing the homeless and keeping businesses in New York will require decisive action that could alienate some constituencies.


Grand Finale: Beene, Karan and Mizrahi
LEAD: In the venerable vaudeville tradition, the New York fashion shows save the best for last.
Yesterday Geoffrey Beene presented his elegantly designed clothes, which would be considered inventive in any fashion capital.
He was followed by Donna Karan, who continues to broaden the meaning of sportswear.

Lethal Loophole for Poison Gas
LEAD: Does President Bush want to ban chemical weapons?
He tells the U.N. he does.
But he lets the Pentagon keep making new ones.
His waffling won't hasten a treaty to ban these weapons or help persuade other states to sign it.
Third world states, fearful that rivals may make chemical weapons, may want to make them, too.

His Honorarium
LEAD: After a dozen years of amateur philosophizing and scolding, Edward I. Koch has decided to turn pro.
The Mayor, whose offer to serve a fourth term was declined by New York voters, said last week that when he leaves office in January he will hit the lecture circuit and maybe even hire out to do a few product endorsements.

From an Empty Nest, the Voice of the Turtle
LEAD: HUMAN the hamster must have sensed his superfluity.
While we were agonizing over how to dispose of our unwanted pet, he bit my son, caught his cold and died.
It was all so convenient, we couldn't have planned things better.


In Quest of Turkey's Majestic Rugs
LEAD: EVEN when the Aegean sun is most intense, there's a freshness to the air behind the giant stone walls of the 17th-century caravansary in the center of Kusadasi, in southwestern Turkey.
This renovated Ottoman inn, known in its modern Turkish incarnation as the Kervansaray, has shady palms and flowering trees in the central court and cushioned chambers along the side and is an irresistible place to while way the hours admiring a vast array of brightly colored carpets.


Campus Life: Massachusetts; Where Students Live and Work As Firefighters
LEAD: A week before final exams last December, Christopher Hookway spent part of a Friday evening in an ambulance, trying to dress the wounds of a drunken student who had shattered a plate-glass dormitory window with his fist.

Feeling Like an Onlooker As a Baby Is Awaited
LEAD: OF all the landmarks in the unique relationship between mother and daughter - first day at school, first date, high school prom, wedding - the most meaningful and overwhelming is the time when a daughter becomes pregnant.


In Pisa, a Jewel of a Museum
LEAD: FREQUENTLY dusty, dim and grimy showcases, Italian museums have been much criticized of late.
They are often closed for sciopero (strike), restauro (restoration), and even, in the case of museums run by a religious order, for lutto (mourning) if one of the order's members has died.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. After a shower, water accumulated in the tub to a depth of seven inches.
After several hours, I removed the drain stopper and tried a 3-foot-long snake, but this did not help.
Drainage in the bathroom sink and basement sink seemed fine.
I started to scoop water out of the tub and pour a chemical drain cleaner into the toilet.


As Projects Crumble, Brazil Is Thinking Small
LEAD: After the state electric company here ran out of money this month, 3,300 workers walked off the construction site of Xingo dam, one of the country's largest public works projects.


The Elephant Didn't Seek the Limelight
LEAD: Your Oct. 15 article regarding Gildah, an Asian elephant  [ ''Anywhere She Wants,'' Long Island Journal ] , was rather misleading.


Reston, Retiring at 80, Still Looks Up the Road
LEAD: James Reston, who retired from The New York Times on Friday, his 80th birthday, said in a farewell interview that President Bush should do more, at this potentially pivotal moment, ''to help along'' the political and economic evolution in the Soviet Union.


DO DRUG MAKERS GIVE MAIL HOUSES A SPECIAL DEAL?
LEAD: The protests of retail pharmacists have not slowed the rapid growth of prescriptions sold by mail - at least not yet.


In the Final Hours, Pete Rozelle Reflects
LEAD: The words still stick in Pete Rozelle's craw.
At a 1975 meeting of National Football League club owners, he sat there and listened as Carroll Rosenbloom challenged his reign as commissioner.
Several months earlier, Rosenbloom, then the owner of the Los Angeles Rams, had signed Ron Jessie, a wide receiver who was a free agent after having exercised the option clause of his contract with the Detroit Lions.


Iceland
LEAD: To the Editor: Having recently returned from two weeks in Iceland, we enjoyed ''A Chunk of Lava in the Sea.'' However, we disagree with the description of the land: ''not a single plant among all the brave and graceful Icelandic grasses, mosses and wildflowers has yet been able to climb the volcano Eldfell for new life.


Notre Dame Collects No. 21
LEAD: Top-ranked Notre Dame tied a school record today with its 21st consecutive victory, beating Navy, 41-0.
The victory was also Notre Dame's first shutout in six years.


Jazz at Winter Garden
LEAD: The jazz singer Betty Carter is to perform at 2 P.M. today at the World Financial Center's Winter Garden, in Battery Park City, in the block between West Street and the Hudson River and between Liberty and Vesey Streets.
Admission is free; information, 945-0505.


They Tried to Give Beethoven a Bad Name
LEAD: When Richard Sterba died at the age of 91 the other day in Grosse Pointe, Mich., the obituary duly noted that ''Dr.
Sterba specialized in the psychoanalytic study of artists, publishing biographies of Beethoven and Michelangelo.'' From that terse description one might not have gathered that this was the same Dr.


Farewell To a Friend I Barely Knew
LEAD: I REMEMBER the night I first met David.
Sue had phoned me two days earlier. ''We've got a buddy for you.
When can you meet him?'' As soon as possible, I said.


Review/Music; String Quartets in Three Idioms
LEAD: At once compatible and contradictory were the first two items on Wednesday's program by the Tokyo String Quartet at the 92d Street Y. Mozart - whose Quartet in G (K. 387) began the evening - was perhaps the first of our confessional composers.
This confiding, commiserating tone established an intimacy between musician and listener that became the modus operandi of 19th-century music.


Officials See String of Navy Accidents as Random
LEAD: Current and former Navy officials insist that the succession of accidents this week was more a random illustration of the dangers of life at sea than a sign of deficiencies in training or maintenance.


More Than Just Another Dr. Kildare
LEAD: From Dr.
Ehrlich to Dr.
Kildare, from Paul Muni to Richard Chamberlain, from yellow fever to black lung, medicine and entertainment have long been bedfellows.
By now, the medical drama tends to run as predictable a course as the common cold.
The dedicated young doctor sets out on the road to the cure for something dire; he works hard, makes personal sacrifices, meets rebuffs, almost despairs - then succeeds.


Arthur Kopit's ''End of the World...''
LEAD: A PLAYWRIGHT (the real Arthur Kopit) sets out to write a play about the end of the world.
What he comes up with is a play about a playwright (the fictional Michael Trent) who is writing a play about the end of the world.


Review/Music; 'The Creation' by Haydn
LEAD: From this distance, it is hard to disentangle the seminal music of earlier centuries from its progeny, and particularly difficult in the case of Haydn's oratorios, which all but disappeared under the weight of ponderous and stultifying successors.
Perhaps that accounts for the modest crowd Richard Westenburg and his Musica Sacra attracted to Avery Fisher Hall on Friday evening to hear Haydn's '


The Reversals of History
LEAD: Former President Jimmy Carter is back in the capital for an informal reunion with staffers from his Administration and a symposium in which he'll report on his mediation efforts in eastern Africa, Central America and elsewhere.

By Robert William Fogel.  1539 pp.
New York:  W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $22.50.


WHAT'S DOING IN: San Antonio
LEAD: The first thing you notice about San Antonio is that it's so old.
It was settled in 1718, and the buildings on the narrow streets seem to vibrate with history.
This is true not only of the Alamo, which is the spiritual and physical center of downtown, but also of 18th-century missions scattered about the city, the gingerbread homes of the King William historic district and the bustling Mexican Market


Landmark Rock is Reborn, but as Papier-Mache


Colorado Edges Nebraska to Reach 9-0 Mark
LEAD: At the end of an afternoon that may never be forgotten at the base of the Rocky Mountains, J.J.
Flannigan, the senior tailback at the University of Colorado, had to return to the football field for one more look.

Temporary Hospital Rates Are Restored
LEAD: A SUPERIOR COURT judge has refused to enter a dispute over hospital rates, marking a victory for a controversial state policy of granting temporary increases of 5.5 percent to hospitals that requested increases of up to 18 percent.


In Mediterranean Cooking, Olive Oil Is Even in Dessert
LEAD: MEDITERRANEAN cooking refers to the cuisines of Italy, Spain, southern France, Greece, Turkey, Israel and the North African countries that border the sea.
Their dependence on olive oil accounts in part for their current popularity.


Miss Sullivan Weds M. C. Sanford Jr.
LEAD: The wedding of Jennifer Corcoran Sullivan, an associate at Lazard Freres &amp; Company, and Marshall Clement Sanford Jr., an associate at the Chemical Realty Corporation, both in New York, took place yesterday at Christ Memorial Chapel on Jupiter Island, Fla.
The Rev.
Leo O'Donovan, a Roman Catholic priest and the president of Georgetown University, performed the ceremony.


Program Trading Is Not the Culprit
LEAD: Program trading bashing has become as fashionable today as attacking Communists was during the McCarthy era.
Ban program trading -or so the argument goes - and stock market volatility will dissappear, the Dow Jones Industrial Average will stabilize and the small investor will return to the market.


Iceland
LEAD: To the Editor: So Iceland's Heimaey island (''A Chunk of Lava in the Sea,'' Travel, Aug. 20) has 4,800 inhabitants now.


Bill on Graduation
LEAD: A bill that would require colleges to disclose graduation rates of student-athletes was approved by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee last week and sent to the full Senate.
The measure, which is backed by Sen.
Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, and many others, also has wide support in the House, although no action is expected there this year.


U.S. in Crucial Qualifier
LEAD: The United States soccer team needs 3 points from two games to qualify for the World Cup finals in Italy next summer and it is expected to get 2 of them Sunday against El Salvador.


Sherlock Holmes's Mail: Not Too Mysterious
LEAD: Nikki Caparn is Sherlock Holmes's secretary. Yes, that Sherlock Holmes.


Question Of the Week; Are There Too Many Injuries in The N.F.L.?
LEAD: Absolutely.
The average career of an N.F.L. player is 3.8 years.
It is the only sport, including hockey and boxing, in which United Press International puts out a weekly injury list.
In other words, the N.F.L. is one day a week of playing and at least six days of recovering.


Defenses Are on the Blitz
LEAD: Whether it was the Eagle, the Spinner or the 46, National Football League teams in the first half of the season have created catchy monikers for their defenses with a primary goal in mind: line maneuvers up front that created havoc and provided pressure on quarterbacks.


FLASHCARD
LEAD: THREE-QUARTERS of the class of 1986 with bachelor's degrees had full-time jobs within a year of graduation.
An additional 11 percent were employed part time, and almost 3 in 10 had continued their education beyond a bachelor's degree.
Eighty-five percent of the 1986 degree recipients in business and management found full-time employment by 1987, the most likely field of study to do so.


Paula S. Fritz, Actress, Weds

FLASHCARD
LEAD: ALMOST all freshmen college students from Arizona remain in their home state.
Ninety-seven percent of Arizonans in college for the first time in 1986 enrolled in campuses within the state.
Close behind is California, with 95 percent of students registering at colleges in their native state.
Just over half of students from New Hampshire remain in the Granite State for their college education, which is the lowest proportion in the country.


Cameron C. Adams and John J. Soroko Are Wed
LEAD: Cameron Colket Adams and John Jeming Soroko were married yesterday at the Cathedral Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, Pa.
The Rev.
Robert Schenkel Jr. performed the Episcopal ceremony.


LECH'S AMERICAN ANGEL
LEAD: Your article on Basia Johnson gave me a sense of deja-vu; she seems so much like that other immensely wealthy ''queen'' who has been in the news lately.
Who knows, she may be able to do for Polish shipbuilding what Leona Helmsley has done for the New York hotel business.
Even if the Gdansk shipyard venture fails, she still gets a tax write-off.


Lisa Smith Is Married
LEAD: Lisa Smith, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Harvey E. Smith of Great Neck, L.I., was married yesterday evening to Arnold Markowitz, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

FICTION
LEAD:  THE GLITTER AND THE GOLD.
By Fred Mustard Stewart. (NAL Books/New American Library, $19.95.) In his latest novel, the author of ''Century'' and ''Ellis Island'' proves once again that he knows how to spin a compelling yarn.

Couple's Sex Conviction Stirs Town

Philanthropy for the 21st Century
LEAD: The fourth-generation Rockefellers are confronted with their own mortality.
As most of these heirs to one of the nation's wealthiest dynasties step deeper into middle age, they are searching for a meaningful way to leave their imprint.


CRIME
LEAD: Those wonderfully clever but trouble-prone young barristers whose misadventures so amused us in Sarah Caudwell's earlier mysteries (''Thus Was Adonis Murdered'' and ''The Shortest Way to Hades'') return for another great lark in THE SIRENS SANG OF MURDER (Delacorte, $16.95).
To the chagrin of the narrator, Hilary Tamar, a learned Oxford professor of legal history who dotes on these irrepressible puppies, one of their number, young Cantrip, has skipped off to the Channel Islands to advise an international tax-planning firm on a complicated trust fund case.


Shakira Caine: Jewelry Designer

An American Accent for Teachers From Abroad
LEAD: DURING a class at Syracuse University this fall, Athanasios Captanis kept looking at himself in the mirror and talking just to hear the sound of his own voice.
As his teachers were quick to point out, this was no exercise in narcissism for Mr.
Captanis, a 24-year-old doctoral student in chemical engineering from Greece.

Kathryn L. Danes Marries J. G. Cohen
LEAD: Kathryn Leonora Danes, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The ceremony was performed by Justice Stanley Parness of State Supreme Court in New


On Language; Nice, Bossy
LEAD: SODA JERKS (NOW called &gt;fountain attendants) know that a &gt;black cow is a root beer float.
What of &gt;cash cow? ''It is apparent that  [ Mortimer ]  Zuckerman has improved the magazine during a very difficult period for newsmagazines,'' wrote Eleanor Randolph of The Washington Post about the owner of the competing U.S.

LEAD: The 18th century glowed again at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Monday night and at the Fashion Institute of Techonology Tuesday.

The host was Henry Racamier, president of Louis Vuitton.


Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''He's learned a lot, he's gaining pace, but I'm not sure whether he's quick enough to keep up with events.
He must become more bold.''

an opposition leader,
speaking of Egon Krenz,
the East German
Communist chief.  [ 17:1. ]


WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER
LEAD: It was on the night of George Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention that my fondness for Peggy Noonan turned to fan worship (''Confessions of a White House Speechwriter,'' Oct. 15).
When George placed his hand over his heart and began to lead the delegates in the Pledge of Allegiance, I unashamedly began to screech and cry like a teeny bopper, realizing that the liberal

John the Divine.


That Dammed Hercules By Bruce Weber
LEAD: PAINTED ON THE FACE OF THE Tignes Dam, which is 250 meters long and 180 meters high, the portrait of Hercules by Jean-Marie Pierret is likely the world's largest fresco.
A Herculean project in itself, it's also a reasonably apt symbol for the Olympic Games, which will arrive nearby, in Albertville, France, in the winter of 1992.


In the Footsteps of a Marathon Veteran
LEAD: On the occasion of the 20th New York City Marathon, I think it's only fair that nouveau runners be told how it used to be in the old days when the race was confined to Central Park.
The tune from ''Rocky'' had not yet serenaded runners.
There were two Port-a-Johns and no waiting.
The rallying cry of the underdog, as reflected in the ''Rocky'' metaphor, has been the marathon's most compelling theme.


Heidi Olson Wed To R. F. Duffy Jr.
LEAD: Heidi Marie Olson, the special assistant to the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and Roger Francis Duffy Jr., an associate partner in design at the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, both in New York, were married yesterday at the All Souls Unitarian Church.

Concerns About Growth Raise Interest in Local Races
LEAD: VOTERS in 158 municipalities will go to the polls on Tuesday to elect first selectmen and mayors, but in Fairfield, Westport and a number of other towns the contests for local zoning boards are attracting as much attention as the races for the top office.


U.S. Thinks Twice About Armenian Measure
LEAD: Opposition is mounting in Congress and in the Bush Administration to a resolution before the Senate to declare a national day of remembrance for the widespread killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War I. President Bush increased Administration efforts to defeat the resolution last week by writing letters to Senator Bob Dole, the Republican minority leader and chief sponsor of the measure, and other congressional leaders.

Though typical for many college campuses, at Albertus Magnus College in New


Pollution In Glen Cove
LEAD: With reference to ''Glen Cove Acts to Update Environmental Laws,'' Oct. 22, anent environmental ordinances recently passed in Glen Cove, I hasten to point out that the most important development here is the cleanup of the industrial polluted areas.

School Was to Be Great for Spike, but Spike Had A Different Idea
LEAD: Sometimes, like all parents, I wonder if I truly know what is best for my young son.
William -- or Spike, as he has come to be called -- has generally gone along with my plans for him over the last two-and-a-half years with a certain agreeableness.
But this year he put he brakes on and taught me a lesson I will not forget.


Greek Composer, Once Communist, Joins the Right
LEAD: For years Mikis Theodorakis sent his thundering chords across concert halls and movie theaters everywhere and was widely lauded as the heroic Communist who endured torture, prison and exile for his ideals.

Review/Music; A Concert of New Music 'In Celebration of the Soloist
LEAD: One approaches a new music concert called ''A Celebration of the Soloist'' and containing a piece called ''Narcissus'' with some suspicion.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Under the treaty, the term of the American administrator of the Canal Company expires on Dec. 31.

Modern Dances of Bones Rather Than Flesh
LEAD: The loneliness that wells up in Susanne Linke's extraordinary performance of Dore Hoyer's dances is so extreme that the pain distilled in these powerful solos seems hardly capable of healing.

Review/Dance; BarriersIn Reveries Of Waiting

From the looks of them, it was easy to believe they had been cooped up together for a whole month of rainy Sundays.

So they waited.
They twitched.
They bickered.
And calmed down.


Question Of the Week; Are There Too Many Injuries in The N.F.L.?

DOCTORS PROFIT FROM MEDICINES YET BEAT RETAILERS' PRICES
LEAD: To Dr.
Arnold D. Panzer, dispensing prescriptions simply makes good business sense. ''I have a seven-day-a week, walk-in, primary care practice, so dispensing medicine is in line with the focus of my practice - convenience,'' he said. ''My patients don't have to schlep over to a pharmacy.''


How the Cocaine Is Coming In This Time
LEAD: AMERICA loves a showdown between good and evil, and when President Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia launched a surprise attack on cocaine traffickers on Aug. 18, the United States stood up and cheered.
Then came the hurricane, the earthquake and the World Series, and the nation turned its attention elsewhere.


COLD FUSION CONFUSION
LEAD: Your authors contend that ''good'' scientists always try to ''kill the discovery.'' That is straight out of Karl Popper's philosophy of falsification, and it simply doesn't describe the behavior of real scientists.
No scientist kills his own discovery - you verify it to your own satisfaction, publish it and let the skeptics do their worst.


Prospects; An Even Slower Economy
LEAD: The economy grew by 2.5 percent in the third quarter, and the unemployment rate for October was virtually unchanged from the month before at 5.3 percent.

So where is the economy headed?
Four economists offer their views.


No More
LEAD: The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, once the largest afternoon newspaper in the country, died at home last week after a long illness.
It was 86 years old.
In its heyday, the newspaper had more than 700,000 readers and was known to keep a safe full of cash on the premises to finance the whims of the founder, William Randolph Hearst, or bail too-enterprising reporters out of jail.

Montauk
LEAD: To the Editor: The story about Montauk by David Laskin (''History at the Tip of Long Island,'' Travel, Aug. 27) raised fond memories dating back more than 50 years.
In those days Montauk was a landscape serene, beautiful and unspoiled by suburban sprawl.
And I recall that the Long Island Rail Road had a Fisherman's Special from Penn Station.


Musical Minds Of the Elderly
LEAD: NEAR 91st Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, a motorist really needed to get someone's attention.
The driver honked the horn - first a steady blare, then staccato beeping, then a fretful combination of the two.


The Antithesis of a Neighborhood Bar
LEAD: THE restaurant is called Allisters, but its owners are Don and Robin McAllister.
Why the name change?
My guess is that McAllisters sounds a lot like an Irish pub, the kind of place known for burgers and beer.
This Oakdale restaurant is the antithesis of a casual neighborhood bar.


Their Trash Can Be Our Treasure
LEAD: I RECOGNIZED the symptoms shortly after we were married: a chronic need to drive slowly through neighborhoods on trash day and an uncanny ability to find treasure in someone else's discards.

The single most intimidating thing is writing for 10 fingers.'' Oliver Knussen was on the phone from London giving reasons why, after a year, his six-minute piano piece, due to be delivered in three weeks, wasn't finished.
He tried another excuse. ''I'm ridiculously overcommitted - if Peter Serkin weren't so nice I wouldn't even have started.


Jets' Fans Asking, Who Is to Blame?
LEAD: Everything is going wrong these days with the Jets, whose 1-7 record is the worst in the American Conference, who can't get a backup quarterback to report for $68,750 a game, whose head coach's closest assistant screams at him and punches windows and kicks doors.


FLASHCARD

Last year almost half the full-time college students between the ages of 16 and 24 were employed.

Sixteen years ago only 37 percent of the full-time students in that age group were part of the labor force.


Pennies to Pay Fines Do Not Please Court
LEAD: Three motorists given speeding tickets each sent the St.
Clair Circuit Court clerk $50 in pennies to pay for the fines, and the clerk says he will not accept them.


CAN A NOVELIST SAVE PERU?
LEAD: THE SMALL TWIN-ENGINE PLANE had pierced the layer of thick fog that blankets Lima each winter, and beyond the portholes there lay only an engulfing nothingness the color of unbleached bed linen.
I was sitting next to the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who had been making a half-hearted attempt to read a book he had brought along, but who was looking out now at the fog, thinking things.

Concern Over the Costs Of Malpractice Liability
LEAD: ''A CHILD falls off a swing and bumps his head,'' Dr.

Now you give him $100 worth of X-rays and maybe a CAT scan, and then you tell him to go home and put ice on it.


Nina Reetz Sets Wedding Plans

BLACKBOARD: Quiz; The Things You Know You Know
LEAD: These are the questions that try men's and women's souls; the ones to which you absolutely, positively know the answers - until someone asks you.
Then your brain seizes up, your mind goes blank and your mouth splutters out vague phrases that serve as a stalling tactic -something original like ''Just a minute, it's on the tip of my tongue.

LECH'S AMERICAN ANGEL
LEAD: David Margolick's article might have provided insight into this unusual woman of great initiative.
He speaks of Basia Johnson's story as ''the American dream come true.'' But, as her story demonstrates, women in America are not guaranteed lasting happiness simply by marrying the American dream.

Knight Extension
LEAD: If there was a sense of urgency when the Indiana University board of trustees met last week, it was understandable.
In Bloomington, where basketball looms large, it must have appeared that the Hoosiers' renowned coach, Bob Knight, was practically on the verge of packing his bags.
That's because it dawned on someone that Knight's 10-year contract was about to expire.

Touchstone Has A Recognizable Touch
LEAD: ''The Bear,'' as it might have been made by Touchstone Pictures: Bart, the 2,000-pound grizzly, would not star.
Bart is high-priced and makes a lot of demands - e.g., six whole chickens and a lot of fruit punch every day - so his more accommodating understudy, Doc, might be a better idea.
The British Columbian scenery, which was actually filmed in the Bavarian Alps, need not be quite as authentic; it could be augmented by studio-built sets.


WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER
LEAD: In describing her first face-to-face meeting with Ronald Reagan, Peggy Noonan writes: ''There was a quizzical look on his face as he listened to what was going on around him, and I realized he doesn't really hear very much, and his appearance of constant good humor is connected to his deafness.''


A Case of Puppy Love
LEAD: JUST the other day, while walking our new puppy, I was confronted by a car swerving across the road toward us as though it were intent on running us down.

How Bush Will Prepare To Be Loose At a Summit
LEAD: IN announcing plans for his Mediterranean summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Bush repeatedly emphasized last week that this meeting will have no agenda and will not decide anything.

LEAD: JUST as the lights fade on the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival production of ''The Night of the Iguana,'' Ellen Barry, as the weary Hannah Jelkes, entreats God to put an end to her seemingly endless wanderings with Nonno, her ''97 years young'' grandfather, ''the oldest living and practicing poet on earth.

I rented a Chevrolet Corsica from Dollar Rent a Car in Orlando, Fla.

LEAD: Yes; players are bigger, stronger and faster, but the philosophy of coaching remains the same: ''Hit or get hit, hurt or get hurt, maim or get maimed, intimidate or get intimidated.''  CHRIS SWEENEY  Northport, L.I.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: There are some people who have only to open their mouths to be real downers.
They are not insulting and they are not necessarily complainers about life, marriage, children or finances - they're not even negative in the traditional sense.
They merely bring out the not-so-nice characteristics in others, and one of those characteristics is an almost irresistible urge to give them a good swat.


Correction
LEAD: An article on Sept. 24 about the Vermont-Quebec border area referred incorrectly to three towns in the area.

COLD FUSION CONFUSION
LEAD: The remarks of Robert P. Crease and N. P. Samios, in their article ''Cold Fusion Confusion'' (Sept. 24), add to a long history of scientific ''spin control'' - attempts by established science to protect its professional solidarity from outside threats, real or imagined.

Employers in the Suburbs Try Commuter Management

Small Steps Toward Acceptance Renew Debate on Gay Marriage

Unfortunately, in reviewing places to stay in that quaint seacoast village, you left out the Carlton House, which was in the center of the photo.

LEAD: Audrey Smaltz has just finished one of her busiest weeks in the year, unseen by the audiences at the spring fashion collections in New York but nevertheless actively involved in nine of the major shows, including those of Carolyne Roehm, Donna Karan, Arnold Scaasi, Rebecca Moses and Adrienne Vittadini.


Israeli Policy Goes Beyond Die-Hard Ideologues

Windfall Taxes
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Special Role Of Parochial Schools
LEAD: The article on parochial schools (''About New Jersey,'' Sept. 24) states well the need for concern over inadequacies in financing schools in New Jersey cities as opposed to their suburban counterparts.
It also highlights clearly the financial needs of the Catholic schools in the cities.
However, several generalizations about these schools need to be clarified.


The Museum That Theory Built
LEAD: A medium-sized museum in a medium-sized city that has been underwritten by a rich retailer and designed by an architect who has never before built a museum would seem like a prescription for total irrelevance.
And the fact that the museum will open without a single picture on its walls might seem to render it not only irrelevant but laughable.


Baker and Australians Urge Fiji to Reach Ethnic Accord
LEAD: The United States and Australia urged Fiji today to find a solution to its political problems that would be acceptable to all ethnic groups in the South Pacific island chain.


Chemical Makers Are Cleared in Lawsuit by Textile Workers
LEAD: A Circuit Court jury has cleared three chemical manufacturers in a lawsuit brought by textile workers who claimed that exposure to a toxic material gave them a crippling lung disease.


Adventuring In the Cloud Forests Of Ecuador
LEAD: THE cloud forest of Ecuador sounded so gentle.
It is, after all, jungle, that is to say, rain forest, but at altitudes high enough to eliminate the sweltering heat, ants, mosquitoes, malaria and even poisonous snakes.
Its mountainous inclines make it perfect for trekking, more or less.


Making College Ends Meet: Linnyette Richardson
LEAD:  Income: $21,000 (Single parent); Children: Age 1  *
Change life insurance  *
Join savings plan with matching employer contribution  *
Invest in taxable not tax-deferred instruments


Lifestyle: Sunday Menu; Savory Pork: Marinade Is the Trick
LEAD: It is not true that you must give up pork if you are on a low-fat diet.
Pork tenderloins are not only tender, they are also very low in fat.
It is easy to compensate for that lack of fat with a savory marinade, which adds immeasurably to the flavor of the meat.
The longer it is allowed to sit, the deeper it penetrates.


Class Actions
LEAD: Most school children would rather be called jerks, dweebs or nerds than nothing at all. ''The teacher remembers the kids who play cards when they're not suppposed to and the kids who fight, better than she remembers the other kids -except the smart ones,'' said 9-year-old Matthew Henkel, a fourth-grader at the Immaculate Conception School in Secaucus, N


The Age Of Egalitarianism Takes a Toll
LEAD: THIS morning, my 8:20 commuter train to New York was canceled at the last minute.
There was an announcement that those of us waiting on the platform should walk to the New Haven side of the tracks, where a train would pick us up in 10 minutes.
Since I am seven months pregnant, the idea of folding up my newspaper, recapping my warm cup of decaffeinated coffee and walking up and down two sets of stairs with a heavy briefcase was somewhat daunting.


Ms. Quigley Weds A. J. Tschinkel Jr.
LEAD: Frances Kerrin Quigley, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Francis D. Quigley of West Palm Beach, Fla., was married in New York yesterday to Andrew Joseph Tschinkel Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Tschinkel of Jamaica Estates, Queens.
The Rev.
George G. Maley performed the ceremony at St.
Patrick's Cathedral.


What's Notable: A Book of Wondrous Trees
LEAD: THE biggest known moss cawara cypress tree in New England stands in a Greenwich cemetery.
One of the largest elms in Connecticut is in the middle of a street in Norwich.
And Gen.
George Washington is believed to have met with his officers beside a white oak in the Gaylordsville section of New Milford.


Hard-Fought Campaigns Await Voters' Verdict
LEAD: VOTERS will finally get their chance Tuesday to settle one of the hardest fought County Executive election contests in recent years, choosing between the two-term Republican incumbent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, and his Democratic challenger, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky.


Pastimes; Chess
LEAD: Some of the oldest openings seem innocuous, but beware that impression - it may mean only that you are too young to have seen them in their heyday.
Then they were tested in battle after battle and analyzed to the hilt because they were once the cutting edge, the focus of the avant-garde ideas about strategy.


Record Milk Prices Are Expected to Rise Further
LEAD: The price of milk rose to a record 75 cents a quart in the New York metropolitan region in October and is likely to rise even more before the end of the year, New York State milk marketing experts said this week.


Voters to Make Choices Tuesday for Governor and Assembly
LEAD: AFTER watching a bitter campaign for governor between James J. Florio, the Democratic candidate, and Jim Courter, the Republican nominee, voters will have their say on Tuesday, when they will also decide party control of the 80-member State Assembly and the fate of five public questions that call for $590 million in proposed spending.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. After a shower, water accumulated in the tub to a depth of seven inches.
After several hours, I removed the drain stopper and tried a 3-foot-long snake, but this did not help.
Drainage in the bathroom sink and basement sink seemed fine.
I started to scoop water out of the tub and pour a chemical drain cleaner into the toilet.


Precautions With Wood Stoves
LEAD: IF you are planning to get a wood-burning stove, there are several things to consider before making a choice.
First check with your building inspector or fire marshal to find out whether installing a wood stove is permitted where you live and what restrictions and requirements apply.


THE GUIDE
LEAD:  WALKING TOUR


Review/Theater; Neil Simon's Dismal New York City
LEAD: To be sure, life in New York City has its drawbacks.
Crime is rampant, pollution is everywhere and nothing works: if the hospitals or the garbage men aren't on strike, the water is turned off.
But it could be worse.
You could have Mel Edison as a neighbor.


Editors' Note
LEAD: A front-page article in the Arts and Leisure section today and the section's cover drawing, about the new production of ''The Threepenny Opera,'' depict Maureen McGovern in the role of Polly Peachum.
After the section went to press, it was announced that because of a vocal cord injury, Ms.
McGovern would not perform for several weeks.


Xavier Goes to Great Lengths to Play
LEAD: There has been no Metro Bowl, pitting the best teams from the Catholic High Schools Football League against the best from the Public Schools Athletic League, since 1986.
So Xavier and Fordham Prep had no reason to believe there would be added significance to their annual Thanksgiving Day clash this year, no worry that the winner would qualify to play the public school champion.


MOST OF IT IS TRUE, THE REST IS SHOW BUSINESS
LEAD:  ALL MY BEST FRIENDS  By George Burns with David Fisher.
Illustrated. 320 pp.
New York:  G. P. Putnam's Sons. $17.95


Texas Instruments Gets Personal
LEAD: Texas Instruments Inc. last week added its name to the growing list of companies that are offering impressive portable computers and personal laser printers.
Well known as a maker of semiconductors, industrial automation and control systems, military electronics and powerful calculators, T.I. has in recent years offered few products that the average consumer of business computers might buy off the shelf.


Island Haven For Wildlife In Georgia
LEAD: GEORGIA'S last family-owned barrier island and a wilderness resort, Little St.
Simons, about halfway between Savannah and Jacksonville, Fla., is not to be confused with neighboring St.
Simons, a 15-minute boat ride away, which it caps like a beret.
St.
Simons has sleek golf and tennis resorts, condominium colonies and shopping malls.


Pastimes; Camera
LEAD: Remember Art Linkletter's comment that ''Kids say the darndest things?'' Well, readers of this column can say the darndest things, too.
Sometimes a letter arrives that points to a real picture-taking problem.


FICTION
LEAD:  ASHES OF IZALCO.
By Claribel Alegria and Darwin J. Flakoll.
Translated by Darwin J. Flakoll. (Curbstone Press/Talman, Cloth, $17.95; Paper, $9.95.) A political polemic presented in the form of a novel is a tricky hybrid.
To be persuasive while balancing the message with the medium is no mean feat.


EX MACHINA: Computer Redux
LEAD: THE TEACHERS and administrators of William B. Travis High School in Austin, Tex., have a vision: they want to transform Travis into a world-class school with an emphasis on the study of global issues, using computers and other advanced technology.


F.B.I. Will Purge Files of Names of Protesters
LEAD: The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it will purge its files of thousands of names of people and organizations collected during its controversial investigation of Americans who protested United States policy in Central America.


Fashion: On the Street; On the Street Cozy, but Not Smothering, Dresses
LEAD: Making sense of the weather is never easy, but at no time of the year is it trickier than now.
The lined trench coat is back from storage and ready for duty, and the muffler and gloves are standing by in the hall closet, along with the boots.
Unless someone has made a grievous error, this is November.


Alabama on Rise In 23-10 Victory
LEAD: Siran Stacy ran for 149 yards and Gary Hollingsworth passed for 151 today as Alabama defeated Mississippi State, 23-10, and moved closer to its first Southeastern Conference title since 1981.


Brazil's Atlantic Playground
LEAD: DWARFED by the transoceanic behemoths of Air France and Varig, a small blue-and-white propeller plane scoots every day past Recife's imposing international air terminal.
Once airborne, the plane leaves behind Brazil's northeastern bulge and heads out to sea, in the direction of Africa.


Nets Keep Calm To Edge the Magic
LEAD: There was nothing magical about the Nets' victory tonight.
They earned it.
The Nets won because they stood up to an emotional effort from the expansion Orlando Magic, which was making its National Basketball Association debut before a festive and vocal sellout crowd.


LONG DELAY IS SEEN ON U.S. RIGHTS POST
LEAD: Three months after President Bush's nominee for the nation's top civil rights enforcement job was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee, Bush Administration officials say it is unlikely that the Justice Department post will be filled before January.


Penrod, Scattergood and Jeeves

John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church in Wellesley, Mass.
The Rev.
Joseph J. Driscoll performed the ceremony.


If It Ain't Broke. . .
LEAD: To the Editor:


Lifestyle: Sunday Outing; Where Even the Ivy Is Ivy-Covered
LEAD: The last stretch of road to Princeton University winds through trees, past tilled fields and over Lake Carnegie, a body of water perfectly shaped - by design - for the sport of rowing.
If, as on one Sunday in autumn, the lake is full of delicate boats powered by young people with considerable muscle definition, cheered on by banner-waving fans, the perfect collegiate moment may be experienced.


Venetian Glass: Ancient Designs, Modern Accents
LEAD: ''The Venetians: Modern Glass 1919-90,'' the largest exhibition of post-World War I Venetian glass vessels ever mounted in New York, now fills the Muriel Karasik gallery, 1094 Madison Avenue, at 82d Street.
It will remain through Dec. 2.


Review/Pop; Some Good Dirty Fun
LEAD: In a series of mock violent skits by the group Gwar at the Rapp Arts Center on Monday night, heads rolled, blood spurted into the audience, a mutant animal wrestled with a Roman centurion and oversize sex organs appeared in various forms.


Female Rappers Strut Their Stuff In a Male Domain
LEAD: In most rap songs, there are only two kinds of women - those who say yes, to become pliant and ornamental sex objects, and those who say no, to be reviled as coldhearted money-grubbers.
That's because, well beyond its first decade, rap has been an almost exclusively male domain.
Although the first wave of rap records in the late 1970's included a female group, the Funky Four Plus One, among the hundreds of rappers making records during the 1980's, there have been barely enough female performers to be counted on both hands.


Shedding Light on Evil Men and a Sinister Time
LEAD: One of the more alarming chapters in recent American history is an often overlooked episode from the 1920's.
The wonder is that a time so filled with evil men and frightening doings has remained in obscurity; that it didn't scare Americans half to death.
And that such an episode has only now been given dramatic re-creation, in a two-part NBC mini-series, ''Cross of Fire.


PITCHING DOCTORS
LEAD: THE SUDDEN DEATH LAST JUNE OF JOHN Matuszak, once a defensive lineman for the Los Angeles (formerly Oakland) Raiders, was initially ascribed to cocaine, but later was declared by the Los Angeles County Coroner to be the result of an accidental overdose of a prescription drug.
Matuszak had been relieving chronic back pain with Darvocet, a form of propoxyphene.


Giuliani and Dinkins Income Reports Put Them in New York City's Top 2%
LEAD: While neither the Democratic nor the Republican candidate for mayor appears to enjoy a lavish style of living, their incomes put them comfortably in the top 2 percent of taxpayers in New York City.


Traffic Alert
LEAD: Because of the New York City Marathon, these streets will be closed to traffic in Manhattan for much of this morning and afternoon: First Avenue from 59th Street to the Willis Avenue Bridge, Fifth Avenue from 136th Street to 102d Street and Central Park South from Fifth Avenue to Broadway.
In addition, some traffic lanes on the Queensboro Bridge, the Willis Avenue Bridge, the Madison Avenue Bridge and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge will be closed.


A Soviet Hoopster In the Promised Land
LEAD: Sarunas Marciulionis, the first Soviet ever signed to a National Basketball Association contract, is lying face down across a trainer's table in the basement of the New England College gym in Henniker, N.H.
It's late summer, the beginning of preseason rookie camp for Marciulionis's new team, the Golden State Warriors, and, after a workout, he is being treated for a strained lower back.


WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER
LEAD: Peggy Noonan paints a rather bleak picture of the pervasive White House milieu - one in which staff members are encouraged to be ''average'' and where, thanks to speechwriters, the Administration ''got invented every day.''


End Paper: Letters from China; They Misjudged The Dragon
LEAD: MOST OF MY 240 graduate and undergraduate students at the Beijing Institute of Chemical Technology were witty, wise, sweet and highly intelligent - sometimes brilliant.
They were patriotic, with a deep-rooted love of their homeland, its ways and its people.

Morton Bialstock of Delray Beach, Fla., have made known the engagement of their daughter, Harriet Joy Bialstock, to Jerome Theodore Dorfman, the son of Lillian Dorfman of Guttenberg, N.J., and the late Abraham Dorfman.
A May wedding is planned.


Europe's Buyout Bulge
LEAD: The mergers and acquisitions movement that started to snowball in Europe three years ago has grown into an avalanche that is remaking the Continent's corporate landscape.
That avalanche will likely continue to thunder as companies rush to prepare for the more competitive era that will result as the European


'Lawrence' Restored - Alas, in Miniature
LEAD: With all due respect to the lovingly restored LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the version that played so thrillingly in theaters earlier this year and is newly available on cassette (1962, RCA/Columbia Home Video $29.95), the decision about which if any version to watch at home isn't entirely simple.
There are arguments to be made for each side of the issue.


Question Of the Week; Are There Too Many Injuries in The N.F.L.?
LEAD: Yes.
Why?
Is it because the steel-hard plastic (blastic?) helmets and bonecrushing, ligament-tearing shoulder pads can't yield but can only mash mortal flesh?


Columbia Finds A Way to Lose
LEAD: The memory of their 44-game losing steak faded last season when the Columbia Lions won twice.
But the pressure of expectations has weighed heavily on the Lions this season.
And with each loss, the load increases.


Spain Shifts Toward Right Edge Of the Socialist Order
LEAD: AT a time of ideological confusion on the European left, with both Communists and social democrats struggling to redefine their philosophies, the re-election of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party last Sunday raised a fascinating question: Was this a victory or a defeat for socialism?


Indispensable Witness to High Drama
LEAD: Touring the majestic exhibition of paintings and drawings by Jacques-Louis David that has just opened both in the Louvre and in the Chateau de Versailles, this critic remembered what happened a year or two ago when curators all over the world were wondering how best to mark the bicentennial year of the French Revolution of 1789.


Japan's Foreign Aid Problem
LEAD: Yoshito Kimura has a $23.5 billion headache.


Joining the Community of Letters
LEAD: To the Editor:


Comings and Goings
LEAD: When the 0-8 Dallas Cowboys take the field against the Washington Redskins today, the starting Dallas quarterback will be Steve Walsh, not his fellow rookie, Troy Aikman, according to Coach Jimmy Johnson, who said that Aikman had not made enough progress in recovering from a finger injury to reclaim the job.


Students Say Best Death Is a Late One
LEAD: ''LIVE HIGH, die young and leave behind a good-looking corpse,'' a slogan among college students of the 80's that was popularized by an article in Rolling Stone magazine, has met its own early demise.
Most students want to live long, prosper and die painlessly at an old age, according to a survey of more than 200 students at the Rochester Institute of Technology.


Pharmacies Fight Off New Competition
LEAD: There is a drug war in America today that has nothing to do with crack dens and money laundering.
Pharmacies are fighting to keep what was once their exclusive domain: the retail market for prescription drugs.
Since 1985, health maintenance organizations, doctors and mail-order houses have cornered a growing share of that business and last year sold 15 percent of the nation's $28 billion in prescription drugs.


Jets' Ryan Is Activated
LEAD: The Jets activated Pat Ryan yesterday, giving them a proven alternative to Ken O'Brien at quarterback for the first time this season.


Uprising Aggravates Israel's Economic Troubles
LEAD: As Israel enters its 11th month of deep recession and the unemployment rate moves toward 10 percent, political leaders are increasingly blaming the Palestinian uprising.

The Peace Plan Wears Thin in Nicaragua
LEAD: WHEN five Central American presidents signed a peace plan two years ago, critics dismissed it as a utopian vision bound to fail in a violent land.
But the plan's author, President Oscar Arias


Defense Boosts Penn St.
LEAD: Ray Tarasi kicked a career-high four field goals and the defense forced six turnovers as Penn State defeated West Virginia, 19-9, today before 85,911 spectators, the fifth-largest crowd in Beaver Stadium history.


Surprise Ending
LEAD: It would doubtless overstate the case to call S. I. Newhouse the George Steinbrenner of publishing.
But like the Yankee's owner, he has shown a real flair for making abrupt changes in top management.
In 1986, William Shawn, the longtime editor of The New Yorker, got the unexpected ax.
Last year, it was Grace Mirabella, the editor of Vogue.


Vincent's Appointments Are Fostering a Positive Atmosphere
LEAD: With months of talk about lockouts and strikes, a delay to the start of next season or an interruption once the season begins almost seems inevitable.
But two new factors have entered the labor situation in the last few weeks that could put a more positive tint on the picture.


Miss Handel Wed To Michael Baker
LEAD: The wedding of Karen A. Handel, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Morton E. Handel of West Hartford, Conn., to Michael S. Baker, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Francis K. Baker of Cumberland, R.I., took place yesterday.
Judge Samuel Freed of Connecticut Superior Court officiated at the Marriott hotel in Farmington,


COLD FUSION CONFUSION
LEAD: I was amused, then not so amused by ''Symptom No. 2: The 'discoverers' are outsiders.'' The ridicule of outsiders in their quest for truth is the hallmark of orthodoxy.
The function of orthodoxy, however, is to preserve the status quo.
Creativity comes from outsiders, like two bicycle mechanics from Dayton, or a lonely patent clerk in Switzerland.


PERSPECTIVES: The Starrett Proposal; Giving Housing a Push in Spring Creek
LEAD: THE occasional visitor to Starrett City, the 5,800-unit rental development near the Shore Parkway in southeastern Brooklyn, might be puzzled by the wording of the welcoming sign.
It no longer says Starrett City.
It now reads ''Welcome to Starrett at Spring Creek.''

Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 5 (1816) and Gustav Holst's ''Planets'' (1916-17) may represent extremes of musical Romanticism, from the most chaste to the most grandiose, but this trivial historical observation gains nothing in the demonstration.

Review/Theater; Infidelity And Love On Tape

But for some black Chicagoans, dining with Richard M. Daley in his office is not necessarily something to boast about.


SPEECHWRITERS AND POLITICIANS
LEAD: Clearly, a modern President hasn't time to craft speeches in the manner of Lincoln on the train to Gettysburg, so we should expect the White House to employ writers.
But that oratory can be ordered up as casually as lunch - devoid of a President's participation in the development of theme, tone and nuance - gives us not statesmanship, but artifice and public-relations hokum.

LEAD: IT is fall, the beginning of my 10th year afloat.

Familiarity: Worth the Risk
LEAD: I WOULD be inclined, temperamentally, to say ''right on'' to Richard Elman, whose provocative article of Oct. 8  [ Opinion, ''Familiarity Breeds Mayhem'' ]  was like a whiff from the ammonia bottle, clearing the sinuses in its originality.

The Heyday of Rococo in Central Europe
LEAD: The subject of the new decorative arts rooms in the Metropolitan Museum - ''Central Europe: 1700-1800'' - is one as to which I must declare an interest.

Question Of the Week; Is Graf's Dominance Good for Tennis?
LEAD: Has the question ever been asked, ''Is Mike Tyson's dominance good for boxing?'' The question appears to be sexist.

Iran Rescue Nothing Like Panama Coup
LEAD: To the Editor:


East Is East, and West Is West
LEAD: BY now the parkas have been ransomed from the cleaners, the spare condominium key found and the snow tires rotated.

A 'Yellow Brick Road' Brightens a Museum
LEAD: What's the future of a fine museum in a faded urban setting on the wrong side of the Hudson?
Bright, predicts Samuel C. Miller, director of the Newark Museum and chief plotter of its just-completed $21 million renovation-expansion.
The revamping has not only tuned up the physical plant of this once-drab inner-city institution but - with gallery space nearly doubled, to 60,000 square feet - has also enabled it to reveal the depth and excellence of its hard-won holdings.


Auctioning Off the National Patrimony
LEAD: Although world attention is focused on the drama of Communist reform, the statist systems of Latin America are undergoing an ideological restructuring that is no less radical than perestroika.
New leaders like Argentina's Carlos Saul Menem and Mexico's Carlos Salinas de Gortari are bent on privatizing their economies and opening them to the international market.

Lasting Effect of Quake: Quality of Life Is Shaken
LEAD: The beguiling landscape here looks just as it did a month ago, the skyline is largely intact and the city is up and running.
But appearances are deceiving.
For millions of Bay Area residents, most of them far from the manifest ruin of Oct. 17, life after the earthquake is vastly different from what it was before: an unnerving sequence of annoyances, none of them traumas in themselves, but deeply unsettling when put together.


G. H. Schweitzer, 79, A Painter and Sculptor
LEAD: Gertrude Honig Schweitzer, an artist whose works are in collections at several prominent museums, died Friday after a brief illness, at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J.

Drug Agency Faults Customs in Cocaine Case
LEAD: A week after Federal agents seized more than five tons of cocaine packed in barrels of lye in a Queens warehouse, no one had been arrested yesterday and Federal law-enforcement authorities said the search for at least five suspects had been hampered by a lack of communication between the Customs Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Intoxicated by My Illness
LEAD: SO MUCH OF A writer's life consists of assumed suffering, rhetorical suffering, that I felt something like relief, even elation, when the doctor told me that I had cancer of the prostate.

LEAD: Thene Mishon Martin and Robert Pettit Irwin were married yesterday by the Rev.

After the Flood, Art
LEAD: There is a picturesque example of nature and art imitating each other in a lower corner of Central Park, where a sculptured zoo meanders along the paths between the real-life menagerie and the duck pond.
It is called Noah's Art, and it harbors beasts that the ark never took aboard - steel lions and stone birds, a bald eagle with an alabaster head, and a concrete tiger that looks like an animal cracker walking down a gangplank.


If You're Thinking of Living in: Sloatsburg
LEAD: WHEN George Washington stopped at Sloatsburg, an old Rockland County joke has it, he told the residents not to change a thing - and they haven't.


Reviews/Music; American Chamber Works
LEAD: The Chelsea Chamber Ensemble's all-American program last Monday night at Weill Recital Hall, part of American Music Week, offered a mixed bag of accessible 20th-century American music.

LEAD: Soviet citizens hailed the end of the Berlin wall today as an omen, if not an outright prod, for even faster Soviet progress toward genuine democracy and economic recovery.


Pastimes; Stamps
LEAD: Collecting new issues from the United Nations has fallen somewhat out of favor with those who call themselves ''serious'' collectors.
The organization has adopted the philosophy espoused by a number of smaller stamp-issuing entities (and big ones, too, like the United States): Stamps are no longer merely receipts for postal services; they are a commodity.

CHINA UPDATE: HOW THE HARDLINERS WON
LEAD: HU YAOBANG ALWAYS TRIED TO DO things his own way, from the day at age 14 when he ran away from home to join the Communists to the time in 1986 when, as party leader, he suggested that maybe it was time for Deng Xiaoping to retire.
This year, after he had his heart attack - embarrassingly, 40 minutes into a Politburo meeting - the doctor ordered him to spend a week in bed.

Mario M. Cuomo and the New York Telephone Company in 1987 appears to be thawing a year ahead of schedule.

Privatizing Will Make Life Worse
LEAD: I attended the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington last month.

To do this, countries like Brazil and

Social Events
LEAD:  Seeking a Cure


CLAMOR IN THE EAST: Reunion in West Berlin; For All, East and West, A Day Like No Other
LEAD: The great reunion party was not limited to East Germans.
While the ''Ossis'' romped through the shopping boulevards and department stores, ''Wessies'' and tourists gathered at the wall they had decorated so brightly over the years with layer upon layer of bright graffiti to sing, stare and often to chip off a piece to take home.


Okoye Helps Fans Get Sunday Cheer

LEAD: Seasoned party bosses who have dominated Indian politics for decades have a new task in 1989.

POSTINGS: Reverse Mortgages and Repairs; New Help for Older Homeowners
LEAD: Two government programs announced this month offer loans and grants to older homeowners having low incomes or housing problems or both.

LEAD: MARGARET I. O'BRIEN was on the phone again, this time talking to a man who had just received an exclusive, red-hot art tip.
He was leaving momentarily to meet an art collector offering terrific deals on genuine Egyptian art - either modern art or some of that Pharaoh stuff, he wasn't sure which.
The man wanted Ms.


The Models and the Glamour Trade
LEAD: THE SEARCH FOR ''THE look,'' the magic that will make lipsticks jump into pocketbooks and magazines walk off newsstands, is endless and truly global.
Start with the lips.
Lips are big right now.
Today's hot models - Cordulla, Christy, Michaela, Naomi - all have full, seductive lips.
It used to be the eyes that did the selling, but now the fashion magazines send out big wet kisses to the unsuspecting passerby.


Frank Gehry's Village of Geometric Forms at Yale
LEAD: There have been studies, investigations, and researches of all kinds, but in the end no one is really sure what kind of environment best suits people with serious mental illness.
It is known that certain things do not work - buildings that are willfully eccentric, for one thing, or buildings that are too flexible and changeable, both of which deny the order, stability and constancy that many emotionally disturbed people feel most comfortable with.


From Seas Around the World
LEAD: ''WITH its brilliant greeny-blue back marked with dark curving lines, its metallic sides and white belly, the mackeral is a handsome fish.
One might almost describe it as flashy in appearance, noticing that the French name maqueraeu also means 'pimp' and that in the past mackeral was a term for dandy in England.


Get Somebody Else to Do It
LEAD: For people who love to shop, New York City is the promised land.
If it exists, you can probably find it here.
But for those who hateshopping - or who do not have the time to trudge from store to store battling crowds - it's even better.
There's no place where it's easier to get somebody else to do it for you.


Arab Groups Fear Israeli Curbs on Donations
LEAD: Eight years ago, five Israeli-Arab doctors troubled by deficient health-care services in Arab villages in Galilee decided to take matters into their own hands.

Global Warming Means New Global Politics
LEAD: UNTIL recently, politicians who wanted to avoid the issue of global warming could duck behind the scientific uncertainties.
Now, with soaring public concern for the environment and wide scientific agreement about the nature if not the timing of the problem, the debate has shifted.
The question is no longer whether the threat is real, but rather how fast it needs to be countered and at what expense.

Hopes Are Rising For Lower Rates By STEVE DODSON
LEAD: The credit market took hope from signs of an easing in Fed monetary policy.
On Tuesday the Fed added money to the banking system when the Federal funds rate was at 8 11/16, bringing the rate down to 8 1/2 percent.
But when the rate went below that, to 8 3/8, the Fed acted to drain money from the system, leading analysts to conclude that the easing would be limited.

Opera (Or Whatever) Shows Life
LEAD: Those who keep fever charts on the health of contemporary opera report that the patient may be taking a turn for the better.
That would be welcome news for concerned friends who have been standing outside the recovery room for years, wringing hands and silently composing funerary tributes.
A recent article in Opera News, the Metropolitan Opera Guild's magazine, cited optimistic figures from the Central Opera Service: during the 1988-89 season, American companies produced more than 60 world premieres.

Her Style Is Imitable, but It's Her Own

The agency had bought rights to use ''Do You Wanna Dance,'' which Ms.

When Ms.
Midler refused to participate, it hired one of her former backup singers to imitate her.


A Savings Failure That Illustrates Everything Wrong With the Industry
LEAD: THE collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in California has come to represent a microcosm - in the extreme, to be sure - of the failure of hundreds of other thrift institutions at a cost to taxpayers of more than $100 billion.

South Korea
LEAD: To the Editor: In his article about the royal palaces of Seoul (Travel, Sept. 17), Richard Halloran writes that the ghosts of the Yi Dynasty, whose kings ruled Korea from 1392 to 1910, still haunt their former residences.
However, not all of the Yi Dynasty inhabitants of Seoul's palaces are ghosts.


Protecting a Child Can Go Too Far
LEAD: It is not Shane who has been maligned in the controversy initiated by his mother, Cindy Soehner, concerning home schooling.
He is probably a ''nice, quiet boy,'' as his mother's friend claims in her Oct. 22 letter.

Living With Style; Crumbs in the Covers
LEAD: IT MAY CONJURE UP IMAGES OF A PRIM WHITE WICKER tray, a rose in a bud vase, neatly trimmed toast and well-polished silver - all the fantasies of a hotel advertisement.
In fact, eating in bed is a precarious activity.
Crumbs are an obvious hazard.
So are tippy soups, wayward sauces and small, slippery morsels.


Review/Pop; Wrenching Songs Of Love
LEAD: Courtly, exalted, dangerous love -an all-consuming passion whose bearers burn and suffer and risk death -fills the songs of Isabel Pantoja, a Spanish pop singer who performed to an adoring crowd on Tuesday night at the Beacon Theater.
Song after song, audience members proffered flowers; admirers handed her notes, and photographers mobbed the stage.

OUR MOST NOTORIOUS SCULPTOR
LEAD: Richard Serra's ''Tilted Arc'' is described as ''nearly the length of a city block.'' It ''stuck up from the plaza like a shark's dark fin.'' I do remember it as being very long, but that romantic description reminds me of the fish I caught last summer: it, too, was nearly the length of a city block.


Jean Dyer, Investment Officer, Is Wed

Philip and James Roman Catholic Church in Baltimore by the Rev.

FIGHTING AIDS ALL THE WAY
LEAD: Larry Josephs has told a story that is similar to one I could tell: I, too, tested positive for the AIDS virus in 1987 (''Fighting AIDS All the Way,'' Oct. 8).
As Mr.
Josephs explained, one of the key indicators of approaching illness is a patient's T-4 cell count.
Like Mr.

Gauging the Aftershocks Of Disaster Coverage
LEAD: Now that some time has passed since the recent California earthquake, one can see more clearly how television has remade the cultural landscape.
Nowadays, disasters happen twice - first live, then on television.
As with assassinations, hostage crises and other unscripted traumas, television immediately crowds into experience and reshapes it.


Review/Dance; New Works From 4 Choreographers
LEAD: The Salon Project, organized by Susan Osberg and Joan Duddy, is an admirable attempt to provide choreographers with opportunities to show new works in varied styles.

No. 5: Strategies For an Anti-Shopper
LEAD: As a general rule, men shop but women go shopping.
That is to say, if a man requires a new shirt, he goes to the appropriate store with a clear idea of what he wants.
If his specific need cannot be met, he returns home and faces the world in an old shirt and a rage.
To men, money is something not to be spent but to be held and fondled; to men, checkbooks and safe deposit boxes are fetishes; they dream about these sacred objects, and their prayers are all in numerals.


Installing Adjustable Wall Shelves
LEAD: ADJUSTABLE wall shelves, the kind featuring metal standards that are slotted to accept brackets sold with them, are versatile, easy to obtain and relatively inexpensive.

All Work and Little Play Are Too Often Dad's Fate
LEAD: I HAVE a vivid memory as a small boy, no more than 7 or 8, of playing outside my home late one afternoon and seeing my father return from work.
I ran over to him with the excitement of a small boy who wants his father's love and approval to gleefully ask him about his day at work.
I do not remember his words verbatim, but they were something to the effect that ''work was work.

The Rev.
Peter Krebs officiated, assisted by the Rev.


13 Counts Of Murder
LEAD: The tone of the prosecution in the case of Richard Ramirez might be characterized as one of regret that Mr.

Mr.
Ramirez was found guilty two months ago of killing 13 people and committing dozens of other felonies in the 1985 wave of ''Night Stalker'' attacks in Southern California.


Joan Siederer Is Married

Deng Is Ex-Chairman But Not an Ex-Leader
LEAD: DENG XIAOPING gave up his last office in the Communist Party last week, but it remains to be seen whether he will give up power.
Mr.
Deng's authority has come not from his titles, but from his eminence and from the Confucian-style respect that other leaders give him.
The 85-year-old Mr.
Deng has not surrendered this status with his job as chairman of the party's Central Military


Pastimes; Coins
LEAD: Even though the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America is three years away, a slew of commemoratives is starting to appear.

LEAD: Time flies by, but the words and images from favorite children's books remain perennially fresh.
The following first lines are from a dozen American children's books that appeared before 1950, but they will be familiar to children, parents and grandparents.
See if you can match them with the accompanying illustrations and, if you can, guess the year they were published.


Lifestyle: Sunday Menu; Even Past Its Prime, Wine Is Excellent for Cooking
LEAD: Bill Plante, CBS State Department correspondent and well-known enophile, confessed recently to a little experiment he conducted with leftover wine: he put it in the freezer.

It was, he said, quite drinkable, and since his first experiment he has continued to store and thaw leftover wine this way.

Four economists speculate on what the Fed might do.


Review/Music; Quintet's Taste for Adventure in Art
LEAD: Of the five woodwind works the Quintet of the Americas presented at Merkin Concert Hall on Tuesday evening to celebrate its 10th anniversary, one in particular seemed to typify its adventuresome and self-effacing approach to its art.
In C. Bryan Rulon's ''Quintet Too Plus One,'' written for the group in 1987, the players virtually disappeared amid the tangle of electronic paraphernalia that littered the stage, while the composer dominated the scene with his synthesizer and a conductor, Joel

Tailgate Terrorists: Another Aspect
LEAD: I read with interest Lydia Rosenfeld's letter to the New Jersey editor (Oct. 15) concerning ''tailgate terrorists,'' but she failed to mention the primary cause for that problem, i.e., the driver who tries to ''control'' traffic by driving 55 M.P.H. in the left and center lanes, instead of staying to the right.

LEAD: Even as the nation's mayors and governors push President Bush to provide more resources for the war on drugs, they have been waging a civil war over whether the cities or the states ought to control the new Federal funds pledged to the battle.

Review/Dance; Odd Events at a Picnic, From Senta Driver
LEAD: Usually, there is nothing puzzling about picnics.
They allow people to relax, eat and, if they wish, frisk about.
Nevertheless, Senta Driver made a picnic a puzzling - and intellectually stimulating - occasion in ''The Grand Duchesses Laughing,'' which received its New York premiere Thursday night on the program Ms.


The Giddy Minimalism Of Jim Jarmusch

Fashion; What They're Wearing In Bed
LEAD: A bit of highly unscientific research among the fashion set discloses that designers who spend their waking hours conjuring up great style statements are just like everyone else when it comes time to turn out the lights.
An awful lot of them like to take it all off. ''Nothing,'' states CALVIN KLEIN.


Heather McClelland Wed

An Old Friend Joins the Parade


FIGHTING AIDS ALL THE WAY
LEAD: One can offer only sympathy to Larry Josephs in his continuing battle against AIDS.
But it's beyond understanding that he can speak of ''safe'' sex with his friend Craig.
It smacks of self-destruction on both sides. ''Safe'' is not absolutely safe.
EUGENE W.  FELDMAN, D.M.D.
Lewistown, Pa.


TV's Black World Turns - But Stays Unreal
LEAD: There is a telling moment in the 1986 film ''Soul Man'' when a young man explains to a friend why he has decided to down a bottle of tanning pills and turn himself black.
The friend is skeptical: What's it actually going to be like, being black?


The Contributions Of Craft Artists
LEAD: The Oct. 1 article ''Three-Day Fair to Open'' showed the high caliber of craft artists currently at work in the Garden State.


Pastimes; Chess
LEAD: Some of what is interpreted to be stubbornness or excessive persistence may be made up of heavy doses of wishful thinking.
When we see a prominent grandmaster return to a favorite defense that has never given him anything but headaches - and do so on only the flimsiest pretext that his new move is really a valuable improvement that rescues his line of play from disaster - one must wonder what is going on in his head.


What Brought Out the County's Voters
LEAD: EVEN when they could not recall the names on the ballot, county residents entered voting booths in large numbers last week and often had a particular candidate or issue in mind, and the belief that their opinions mattered.

The bridegroom is a son of Alexander B.


SPEECHWRITERS AND POLITICIANS
LEAD: Do we really need to hear how Peggy Noonan mingled with the great minds of America in the mess hall at the White House?
Isn't the essence of her political thought encapsulated in her mastery of grand phrases, such as ''a thousand points of light,'' which somehow resonate without making waves?
KATHLEEN O'NEIL


OUR MOST NOTORIOUS SCULPTOR
LEAD: You ask, in your article, why the French love the sculptor Richard Serra while Americans recognize him for the fraud he is.
For that matter, why do the French love Jerry Lewis?
They obviously have some odd ideas regarding talent.
EVE GOLDEN  Secaucus, N.J.


Setting the Record Straight
LEAD: To the Editor:


No Shortage of Takers as Indians Start Trade Talks on Carter
LEAD: Joe Carter did not hit a home run, drive in a run or even swing a bat; he wasn't even on the premises.

Silver Pieces With Elegant Pasts And New Uses

I had to buy that pot.''


College Coaches' Brief Encounters
LEAD: Outside the office window of the new basketball coach at Arizona State University, it was difficult to tell what point of the season Bill Frieder had reached.

LEAD:  CHRISTMAS TREE FESTIVAL


No. 4: Echt and Eclectic Source
LEAD: Fairway Fruits and Vegetables, the echt Upper West Side market a couple of blocks up Broadway from the Ansonia Hotel, says that 60,000 customers a week cruise through its packed aisles of produce, delicatessen, dairy goods and you-name-it (Kirbys, anyone?).
Of those 60,000, probably 40,000 are little old ladies who wield their shopping carts, dawn to midnight, the way a matador brandishes a cape.


Royal Couple Of the King Of Instruments
LEAD: In May of 1975, Maurice Durufle and his wife, Marie-Madeleine Durufle Chevalier, might have been one of the world's happiest couples.

Leftover Change
LEAD: To the Editor: In her article on converting currency (Practical Traveler, Sept. 3), Betsy Wade, in offering a solution for using leftover foreign currency, was probably unaware that Change for Good is the registered trademark of our organization in the United States.

LEAD:  SOVIET UNION


DAT Recorders For Home Use Finally Arrive
LEAD: After about four years of anticipatory tizzy, American audiophiles can now walk into a store and walk out with a DAT recorder.

This is unquestionably a milestone, and the price is correspondingly hefty: $11,000.


Question Of the Week; Is Graf's Dominance Good for Tennis?
LEAD: Athletes who dominate their sport raise the standards for others to follow, inspire younger players, and bring in fans.
The Celtics of the 60's, Steelers in the 70's, Edwin Moses for what seemed an eternity, were all dominant.
I don't recall people asking if they were ''good'' for their sport.

Tempos That Tell More Than Time
LEAD: Three recent albums of almost nonstop brilliance by the pianist Andrew Hill, 52 years old, the alto saxophonist Frank Morgan, 55, and the flugelhornist Art Farmer, 61, are good examples of how, for jazz musicians, age amplifies control.
The critic Hugh Kenner once wrote that art is the accumulation of detail; in jazz, detail derives from constant playing and the experience that comes with age.

Getting in Gear For the Slopes
LEAD: EVERY year ski resorts boast of the millions they spend sprucing up their lifts and trails for winter.

In Splendid Isolation On the Tetons's Far Side
LEAD: WE skied in the west last winter, partly to check on a rumor.
Four of us - my wife, Holly, our 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, our friend Susan and I - began our mid-January holiday with three days at Jackson Hole, the great Wyoming resort that I'd skied before and wanted to introduce the others to.
But at home in Connecticut, we'd decided to take advantage of a combination deal that would also give us a taste of Grand Targhee, a resort a little over an hour away from Jackson Hole, on the other side of the Tetons.

The Census: How a Head Count Grew and Grew
LEAD: THE first United States census was taken almost two centuries ago.
It was designed as a simple head count to regularize the composition of the House of Representatives, with one seat for every 30,000 citizens. (Excluded were American Indians not paying taxes.)

At the Front in the Battle Over Unix

LEAD: ADJUSTABLE wall shelves, the kind featuring metal standards that are slotted to accept brackets sold with them, are versatile, easy to obtain and relatively inexpensive.
They are also easy to install, but there are a few pitfalls.


Pastimes; Bridge
LEAD: It is reasonable to teach a beginner that against silent opponents he should head for game in no-trump, if he cannot find a major suit fit.

Michigan Overruns Illinois

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Lifestyle: Sunday Outing; Capturing Decades of Moving Images Video games take up the entire third floor of the American Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, Queens, for the year-old museum's exhibition ''Hot Circuits, a Video Arcade.''   ''We try to find things that are accessible to a large group of people,'' said Jo Ann Hanley, a curator at the museum, which opened in September 1988. ''The audience that comes here is much broader than, say, the audience that goes to the Museum of Modern Art.''   The three-story, 50,000-square-foot museum, which calls itself ''the first in the United States devoted to the art, history and technology of motion pictures, television and video,'' has exhibitions, film screenings, lectures and a gift shop. Unlike other institutions, like the Museum of Broadcasting in Manhattan, the museum is not concerned with the collection or preservation of film and video.   ''I think of the museum as a rose,'' said Rochelle Slovin, its founding director. ''It is revealing itself slowly as people begin to understand that the museum encompasses everything from the very early silent films to the very latest applications of video.''   The dimly lighted second floor is the heart of the museum, with its exhibits exposing the magic of special effects, a lavish re-creation of a 1920's movie palace and the ''TV Lounge.'' After walking up the winding staircase from the ground floor, a visitor encounters ''The Getaway Car,'' 63 color video monitors framed by bumpers, spinning tires and headlights and forming a Technicolor collage of flashing images.   A few feet away, a more prosaic bank of video screens show scenes from films and television shows. Each monitor is connected to a handset on which the visitor can listen to a running commentary. At one station, the 1950 production of ''All About Eve,'' starring Bette Davis, is analyzed by its director and screenwriter, Joseph L. Mankiewicz.   By viewing directors, production designers, actors and writers as artists and examining the creative process, the museum avoids becoming a repository for nostalgia, a place where flea-market gleanings are displayed. But the museum building itself had an important role in film history: it is part of a complex used by Paramount Pictures in the era of silent films and early talkies.   ''We are trying to present the historical and social considerations of these media so that people can better appreciate and enjoy the media with which they are confronted everyday of their lives,'' Ms. Slovin said.   Many exhibits underscore the intimate relationship between popular and consumer cultures. The visitor sees a white party frock worn by Joan Crawford in the 1932 movie ''Letty Lynton'' and reads that 500,000 copies of the dress were sold at Macy's alone that year. Part of a wall is filled with television-character lunch boxes like those that millions of children have carried to school for years.   The 47 video games, each with a text explaining its significance, have an obvious appeal for children, but other exhibits, like the hologram that projects costumes and the sound-effects machine, also invite adults to participate.   The overwhelmingly intricate and colorful ''Tut's Fever Movie Palace,'' a 20-foot-wide working re-creation of a 1920's movie theater created by Red Grooms and Lysiane Luong, is like a room made from a child's dream about ancient Egypt and movie stars. The walls are lined with murals of movie stars and Egyptian statues.   ''This place captures the fun of the old theaters,'' said Barbara Ehrlich, a 59-year-old school psychologist who was visiting the museum last week from Great Neck, L.I. ''The theater itself used to be one of the best things about going to the theater.''   Two theaters (more humble than ''Tut's Fever'') also have screenings. Next weekend, as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's New Music America Festival, the museum will present musical accompaniment to silent films. ''The Best of Everything: The New York Woman 1947-61,'' a film series about female New Yorkers on both sides of the camera, will begin on Nov. 24. Many of the museum's more than 700 annual screenings are accompanied by lectures.   Admission to the museum, at 34-12 36th Street, at 35th Avenue, in Astoria, is $5, $2.50 for students and children, and $4 for those over 65. Film and video screenings, along with five tokens for use in the ''Hot Circuits'' video games exhibit, which runs through Nov. 26, are included in the admission price. The museum is open Tuesday to Friday noon to 5 P.M. and Saturday and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. For program information, call 718-784-0077. Getting There   By subway: Take the R or the G train to Steinway Street. Walk down Steinway Street to 35th Avenue and right to 36th Street. Or take the N train to Broadway in Astoria; walk east on Broadway to 36th Street, turn right and proceed to 35th Avenue.   By car: Take the Grand Central Parkway to the Hoyt Avenue exit and turn left on 31st Street; turn left on 35th Avenue and proceed to 36th Street. A commercial parking lot is one block east of the museum on 35th Avenue.   For further travel information, call 718-784-4777.

Country French in a Revamped Setting
LEAD: AFTER a fire destroyed Stonehenge, an old farmhouse turned inn in Ridgefield, it emerged from the ashes, completely rebuilt, and re-opened its doors last May.

The World of Wearable Art
LEAD: BORDERS BETWEEN the arts tend to be vague in New York.
It's quite common to find the same artist moving from painting to sculpture and on to jewelry design.
That range suggests the parameters of today's jewelry artists, who are fabricating complex, one-of-a-kind objects that translate the concerns of mainstream art into the language of silver and gold.


From Seas Around the World
LEAD: ''WITH its brilliant greeny-blue back marked with dark curving lines, its metallic sides and white belly, the mackeral is a handsome fish.

He was more than a pianist.


OUR MOST NOTORIOUS SCULPTOR
LEAD: Did the people and the press turn on Richard Serra because of government incitement?

Starts in Housing Show 12% Rebound for October WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (AP) -Housing starts bounced back by 12 percent in October from September's seven-year low, the Commerce Department reported today.   Analysts said they expected the construction rate to remain stable through the first quarter of 1990.   ''The housing market seems to have bottomed out,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. But he and other analysts said they did not expect any surge in building.   The Commerce Department reported that new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million units last month.  Drops in Previous Two Months     The 12 percent rebound from September was the sharpest gain since a 13 percent advance in December 1986. Starts had fallen 4.6 percent in September and 6.4 percent in August.   Although September's pace was revised upward from the 1.26 million reported earlier, it was still the most sluggish since new homes and apartments were built at an annual rate of 1.17 million units in October 1982 during the depths of a recession.   Many analysts attributed the September construction drop to a rise in mortgage rates and said the October gain followed a subsequent decline.   The housing industry has been among the hardest hit as the Federal Reserve drove up interest rates to slow economic growth and lower inflation. But the Fed has slowly eased rates over the summer and, except for the blip in September, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have fallen from March's 11.22 percent peak to 9.82 percent by the end of October, according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.  Decline in Inventories     The higher rates stifled sales and bolstered inventories of single-family homes to an 8.1-month supply by last March, said Richard Peach, an economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. As rates have fallen, he added, inventories have dropped to a six-month supply, which, he said, ''by historical standards'' puts the industry ''in good shape.''   But even though many analysts expect mortgage rates to drop another half of a percentage point in coming months, Mr. Peach said he did not expect a sharp rise in building.   Construction of single-family homes in October rose 6.9 percent, to an annual rate of 1.03 million units. Single-family starts had fallen 3 percent in September and 3.5 percent in August.   Apartment construction rose 28 percent in October, to an annual rate of 393,000 units. It had fallen 9.4 percent in September after dropping 14 percent in August.   Total housing starts during the first 10 months of the year were down 6 percent from the corresponding period of 1988.   The South, which posted a 14.7 drop for the steepest regional decline in September, turned in the sharpest increase in October, up by 17.1 percent, to 562,000 units. It was followed by the Midwest with a 16.5 percent gain, to 289,000 units.   Construction rose 6 percent in the Northeast, to 176,000 units, and 5.1 percent in the West, to 393,000 units.

Review/Jazz; Strings Make the Most of It
LEAD: A crucial problem for a jazz group made up predominantly of strings is its ability to engender a swinging attack.

Still, the value of one-on-one transmission from teacher to student - from one Bach to the next, from Haydn to Beethoven, from Liszt to his phalanx of epigones - can hardly be overestimated.

Ban on Journal Erodes Thais' Tolerant Image
LEAD: Although Thailand's ban on the import and sale of The Asian Wall Street Journal is likely to be temporary, it is certain to diminish the country's reputation for tolerance.
The damage has increased as the Government considers a similar ban on the weekly Far Eastern Economic Review.

What Are Europeans Supposed to Do Next, And Who Will Get to Decide?
LEAD: THE latest rush of change in Eastern Europe has left the West in emotional confusion as politicians struggle to interpret events that even the most astute pundits had failed to predict.

LEAD: The First Presbyterian Church in New York was the setting yesterday for the wedding of Livia J. Ling, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.

John B. Macnab performed the ceremony.


Reviews/Music; Speculum Musicae in Takemitsu Finale
LEAD: There are three explanations for Toru Takemitsu's unquestioned status as Japan's best-known composer.
First, his music is pretty good, the sonic tip of a deep-probing esthetic and philosophical exploration of the intersections between East and West.
Second, he is adept at international composer careerism, which is not so much a cynical dismissal as a dispassionate observation.


Winter Wedding For Jan Sigmon
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Jackson Marcus Sigmon of Bethlehem, Pa., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Jan Alison Sigmon, to Andrew L. Dworkin, a son of Ruth Berman Dworkin of New York and the late Bernard Dworkin.

Is It Time Now to Cry for 'Evita'?
LEAD: Political unrest, financial collapse and bruised egos - enough to rival the life of the dramatic Eva Peron herself - have marked the tortured path of ''Evita'' from stage toward the screen.
Like so many film projects in Hollywood that go on for years without being made, ''Evita'' is an example of the hazards of the high-stakes marriage between art and commerce.


Review/Dance; The Joffrey in All-Ashton Bill

LEAD: The recent skirmish between John E. Frohnmayer, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and Artists Space, an alternative gallery in Manhattan that is one of the Endowment's constituents, over a $10,000 grant for an art show about AIDS throws into sharp relief the increasing struggle in this country between artists who are straining the boundaries of what is acceptable and lawmakers voicing concern about standards of morality.


Ghosts: Appearance And Reality
LEAD: As a colleague of Terence M. Hines at Pace University, I would take issue with some of his statements in your Oct. 29 issue Westchester Q&amp;A (''Seeing Is Believing? Not Necessarily'').
In answer to the question ''How can we be sure there aren't ghosts?'' he replies ''. . .The burden of proof is always on the proponents to produce something other than vague reports and fuzzy photographs, which are known to have been faked in the past.


Temple Upsets Rutgers By 36-33

20th-Century Art, $20 Million Prices
LEAD: AFTER a five-year run of higher and higher prices, the art market shows few signs of leveling off.
But tastes are beginning to shift from French Impressionism to modern and contemporary art.

Conduct a Test of a Gold Standard
LEAD: In 1971, following President Nixon's repudiation of the agreement at Bretton Woods to redeem dollars in gold bullion, I was one of the first economists on Wall Street to warn that Nixon's ''New Economics'' policy would lead to serious economic and financial problems in the 1970's.


Of Passion, Politics and Other People's Money STAGE VIEW; Of Passion, Politics and Other People's Money
LEAD: To my way of thinking, which I do not propose as the only way, virtually everything else that's new in town is a relief from ''Orpheus Descending.''


MOVING DAY: THE BOOKS I LEFT BEHIND
LEAD: I have always thought of books not so much as something to read but as something to live with.
Anthony Powell has a novel called ''Books Do Furnish a Room,'' and for me they have furnished a life.
They are not bound volumes of pages but companions.
In my first apartment, a tenement in Greenwich Village, books were all the furniture

Corrections
LEAD: A map last Sunday showing Germany's 1914 borders mislabeled the territory to the northeast.

Rivals Think A's Have Good Shot at a 'Dynasty'
LEAD: Three weeks into the sports world's latest ''dynasty,'' no one has made any serious moves to challenge the Oakland Athletics.

A Tool for Examining Foreign Patents and Research
LEAD: Translation has long been an after-thought for many American companies.
But it may be gaining as cultural chauvinism goes out of style.
In fact, as markets grow more global and the competition heightens, translation is becoming part of more companies' competitive artilleries.


Dinkins Initiates Quest for a Police Commissioner
LEAD: Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins's quest for a police commissioner is to begin in earnest this week with the naming of a search committee.


Outsiders Who Specialized in Talking Pictures
LEAD: Every now and then the New York art scene is treated to the sight of raw, irrepressible talent making itself up as it goes along, with little in the way of training or guidance from other art.
Sometimes this work is called visionary art, sometimes outsider art.
Sometimes it fits into or along the margins of a bona-fide contemporary art movement, like Chicago's Hairy Who, with its tightly wound antic imagery, or like Neo


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. The cold-water faucet in my bathroom sink gives off a loud whistling or humming noise whenever it is turned on.
The noise stops when the faucet is turned on all the way.

Why the Hard Sell Didn't Work For Detroit
LEAD: THE report on car and truck sales released last week was, by most accounts, a grim harbinger for the American auto industry.
While foreign manufacturers are suffering, too, the brunt of the decline hit the Big Three automakers, raising new questions about whether Detroit is entering its first recession in almost a decade.


Yonder $12.80, Wins Remsen
LEAD: Yonder and Rootentootenwooten, who could not keep up with New York's best 2-year-olds earlier in the year, proved yesterday that additional time and distance have moved them along as they scored important stakes victories at Aqueduct.


Prospects; How to Fix the New Yorker
LEAD: The 64-year-old New Yorker magazine, acquired by Conde Nast Publications Inc. in 1985 for $200 million, has shown a decline in advertising, although circulation is up.
Although it earned $6 million a year at the time of its purchase, many analysts now think the magazine is losing money.
Can the New Yorker - famed for its fiction and reportage but now criticized as passe - reverse its fortunes?


Top Stereo Can Be A Bottom-Dollar Experience
LEAD: It's not even Thanksgiving yet, but, as any retailer will happily tell you, it is never too early to think about Christmas.
If stereo is on your list, and you worry about the economy - your own economy, that is - it is reassuring that an inviting choice of musically competent components can be had at relatively low cost.

LEAD: Claire Lang von Arnold, a fashion consultant and retailing executive, died of pneumonia Friday at her home in Manhattan.
She was 91 years old.


Has Putting on The Glitz Become Passe?
LEAD: Popular culture has always mirrored its times and, as the 1980's draw to a close, efforts are inevitably being made to single out those arts, artifacts and entertainments that perhaps best reflected the spirit and values of the decade.
Where was the Reagan Era captured, even if unintentionally, most vividly?


WHAT'S DOING IN: Atlanta
LEAD: Atlanta, more than any other city in the South, has always looked forward rather than back - interested in the bustle of commerce rather than the history and lore that's so much a part of many Southern cities.
Its charms rest partly on the gorgeous wooded setting it began with and partly on the modern city created by the economic juggernaut of the recent past and almost not at all on what came between.


Self-Inflicted Wound
LEAD: ''As to the beating of the man, it was only moderate enough to convince him to accept detention.'' - Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's Defense Minister, in a letter to former President Carter.


For Cost-Wary Businesses: Leased Help
LEAD: THREE years ago, when Brian O'Loughlin started an asbestos-removal company, only two people were on the payroll.

O'Loughlin said, the company doubled in size again.


Question Of the Week; Are the Rangers Legitimate Contenders?
LEAD: The Rangers, if healthy, can definitely make a run at the end of the year.
If the Rangers can keep up their strong play until Carey Wilson returns, they'll be in position to win the Patrick Division and possibly contend for the cup.
An injury to either Tomas Sandstrom or Brian Leetch would basically eliminate any legitimate chance they'd have, however, since they lack the depth of Calgary or Montreal.


WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS CULTURE
LEAD: Museums reflect culture and to some measure control it.
They collect and exhibit what their curators find instructive or exceptional.
In MUSEOLOGY (Aperture, $39.95), the photographer Richard Ross presents the results of a 10-year exploration of art and natural history museums in the United States, France, England, Egypt and Greece.


Question Of the Week; Are the Rangers Legitimate Contenders?

LEAD: On Tuesday, the chef Frederic Piepenburg examined his croissant, checked his white-chocolate mousse and black forest cakes, put on a clean chef's jacket and walked out of his pastry shop on York Avenue in Manhattan.

On this vote, a yes vote was a vote to approve the pay package.

Fashion: On the Street; Seeing Double and Triple And Quadruple and . . .
LEAD: Karl Lagerfeld's suits for Chanel and his own KL collection do get around.
His red and black Chanel number, for instance, which sells for about $14,000 in Paris, can be seen at right, heading in opposite directions.
At that price one wouldn't think the odds were in favor of two of these custom-made suits showing up at the same spot at the same time, but that just goes to show how popular Mr.

Lifestyle: Sunday Menu; Leftover Turkey, In Disguise

At an Iceless High School, Hockey Team Takes Up Dancing

LEAD: Ten years ago, Arthur and Teddy Edelman sold their fashion leather business in Manhattan to Mitsubishi, the Japanese company, and focused exclusively on home furnishings, providing interior designers and architects with high-quality and unusually textured leathers. ''We liked fashion,'' said Teddy Edelman, who is 61 years old.


New-Music Festival; Brooklyn Ensemble And Moondog's Return
LEAD: From either inclination or a lack of opportunity, composers who frequent New Music America festivals do not normally write for symphonic forces.
Not all the festivals have even offered such extravaganzas.
But this year's 10th-anniversary festival gathered itself together Thursday night for a Brooklyn Philharmonic program at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater - which has already proven itself a fine acoustical venue for such events.


Debra Kimelman Wed To Stephen A. Weiss
LEAD: Debra Merril Kimelman, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Martin Kimelman of Great Neck, L.I., was married yesterday to Stephen Andrew Weiss, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

Pa-Rum-Pum-Pum-Pum
LEAD: IF THERE'S A HUB OF THE ANnual whirlwind that is Christmas in New York, it's probably Rockefeller Center - the famous tree, the skating rink, the strolling carolers and brass, not to mention the likelihood that more tourists carrying more gift-wrapped packages toddle through there than any other place on earth.

Architecture View; A Radical Idea: Baseball As It Used to Be
LEAD: The Baltimore Orioles did not make it to the American League pennant last season, but they came close.
If major league baseball offered awards for architecture, however, this team would win hands down.
For the design for the Orioles' new 46,000-seat stadium in downtown Baltimore, which will begin contruction this spring and be finished in time for the 1992 season, is the best plan for a major-league baseball park inmore than a generation.

In Oyster Bay, a Fish Fancier's Haven
LEAD: LONG ISLANDERS seeking country dining at a quaint atmospheric inn will not be enticed by the Mill River Inn's drab exterior.
This ill-lighted, undistinguished gray building situated in a less-than-gentrified section of Oyster Bay will attract few walk-ins.


Singles' Plight
LEAD: To the Editor: I recall a letter by a single traveler who complained about exorbitant rates.
I concur and think it is high time the travel industry recognized that there are many singles out there, and by charging this ridiculous single supplement they discourage us from traveling.

LEAD: For most Americans, the term ''cabaret,'' if it suggests anything at all, probably conjures up movie images of a hyperkinetic Liza Minnelli and an epicene Joel Grey in a squalid Berlin dive on the eve of the Nazi era.
In the film ''Cabaret,'' the Minnelli character's invocation of ''divine decadence'' helped stamp the very word ''cabaret'' with intimations of depravity that it unfortunately still carries.

U.S. CHAMBERMAID, POLISH QUEEN
LEAD: David Margolick exaggerates the contrast between American and Polish perceptions of Basia Johnson (''Lech's American Angel,'' Oct. 8).

How to Do Justice to the Native Cranberry
LEAD: FOR many Americans, cranberries are thought of only once a year, as a sauce or condiment to serve alongside turkey.
If turkey happens to make it to the dinner table more than once a year, then the cranberries will accompany it on those occasions as well.
That does not do justice to the native cranberry.

Garden Party Whatsit
LEAD: ONE OF THE GREAT word-pictures in the American language is &gt;the skunk at the garden party.
Think about it: There is the garden party, an elegant institution peopled with perfumed ladies in large hats and gentlemen in blazers and green pants who are holding gin fizzes.
An expensive tent called a ''marquee'' is in place in case of showers; a few of the fellows slip off for a slow game of croquet, and into this strawberry-and-cream world meanders a small black animal with a white streak down its back and a bushy tail, with the potential, if it is frightened, of causing such a stink as to rende

By Susan Howatch. (Knopf, $18.95.) This third novel in Susan Howatch's ecclesiastical series (the first two were ''Glittering Images'' and ''Glamorous Powers'') demands so insistently to be taken seriously that - though it flies in the face of good sense - one is left with no choice but to do so.


Hey, Dude, Like NEH-oh Way!
LEAD: I HAVE NEVER MUCH LIKED THE WAY I TALK.
IN UPSTATE New York, where I was raised, people said things like ''Lemme have a HEE-am SEEN-wich'' and ''You scared the BEE-JEES-us outa me.'' It had no grace.
Nowhere in our local speech was there the hint of a drawl, or any majestic New England tones, or even a trace of downstate Brooklynese - which can sound almost poetic if you are in the right mood.

Your article did not take a position on the $1 billion breach of contract suit filed by Warner against Sony and the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company, but I think it is important for

But even the non-nuclear side of a plant like Shoreham has substantial differences from a conventional plant, and those differences may become extremely clear in the next two months or so.


FOOTBALL
LEAD:  LOOKING DEEP.
By Terry Bradshaw with Buddy Martin. (Contemporary, $17.95.) As Susan Sontag once remarked, writing well is the best revenge.
Revenge is probably not what Terry Bradshaw had in mind when he wrote ''Looking Deep'' with the Denver Post sports columnist Buddy Martin, but that is what he has got: revenge over the scores of sportswriters who called him dumb during his career as a quarterback with the Pittsburg Steelers and who will never write a book about football as good as this one.

LEAD: It wasn't until the end of the pianist Don Pullen's last tune of his first set at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday night that it became clear how unusual his compositional ideas are.

A Victim's Appeal
LEAD: Moral suasion may occasionally move a politician to tears, but it rarely moves a gun control measure toward enactment in the face of gun lobby opposition.

LEAD: As if the National Football League weren't violent enough and its players weren't solvent enough, Buddy Ryan, the coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, has been accused by Jimmy Johnson, the Dallas Cowboys' coach, of putting a ''bounty'' on the helmets of a quarterback and a kicker.
It's time Ryan was called on the carpet to explain these charges and others that circulated long before this controversy flared.

New York:  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $18.95.


A Yankee Upstart Sprouts in Thatcher's London
LEAD: The scale of Canary Wharf is immense: 24 buildings on 71 acres, its centerpiece a 50-story, 800-foot-high skyscraper by Cesar Pelli that when finished will be the tallest building in Britain.
This is most assuredly not the London of Christopher Wren or of John Nash.
Nor is it the London of Prince Charles, who has made it clear that he expects this huge tower to be a desecration of the city's skyline.


The City Council Finds Its Elbows
LEAD: FOR years, the New York City Council has mostly labored in the political shadows, spending a lot of its time dealing with such matters as new names for city streets, parks and ball fields.
At the other end of City Hall the Board of Estimate, dominated largely by the mayor, has held the limelight, making many important decisions on municipal affairs.


Lifestyle: Sunday Menu; For Pasta, Creamy Lightness

Paying for Oil-Troubled Waters
LEAD: The wreck of the Exxon Valdez eight months ago in Alaska's Prince William Sound caused America's largest oil spill and may yet turn out to be America's most costly environmental disaster.
But it has yielded a measure of redemption, jolting Congress into writing credible legislation that would greatly increase the cost of carelessness by shippers and producers of oil.

CONNECTICUT GUIDE
LEAD:  FESTIVAL OF TREES


Streetscapes: U.S. Rubber Company Building; Restoring Luster to a 1912 Lady
LEAD: The 20-story headquarters Carrere &amp; Hastings created in 1912 for the U.S.
Rubber Company at 1790 Broadway, at 58th Street, is a building of discreet qualities.
It cannot claim any superlatives, and most of the guidebooks omit it, but it has what many better known buildings lack, good manners.


Same Language, But Not the Same
LEAD: As I read ''Are We Speaking the Same Language?'' by Dorothy C. Judd (Opinion Page, Oct. 15), I felt as though I could have written it.
I was born and raised in Boston; my late husband, in Maine (he never did sound like a ''State-o'-Mainer'' though his older sisters did, and still do, even after 50-plus years in


PattiSue Plumer Plans a Wedding
LEAD: The engagement of PattiSue Plumer, a member of the 1988 United States Olympic track and field team, to Steven David Levere, the son of Dr. and Mrs.

A Guide for Hikers, Sunday and Otherwise
LEAD: A CLIMB up steep stone steps in Kent, a walk in the wild near Bethlehem's town center and a hike over glacially formed ridges called eskers are among the outings described in the new edition of ''Country Walks in Connecticut'' by Susan D. Cooley of Middletown.


ABOUT MEN
LEAD: LIVING IN THE MIDDLE of the woods in upstate New York, I am sometimes reminded that a gun can be a useful tool in the normal course of country life.
As serene and pastoral as it all appears from the white Adirondack chair - a big house, porches, stream, barn, ducks, dogs, cats, a pickup truck, basketball hoop and seven kids of various sizes and shapes - there is a perilous world beyond the periphery of the lawn, where deer are often seen grazing on the long grasses.


In the Streets of Prague, The Mood Is Victorious

NEWS SUMMARY

The World of Endless Labels

FICTION
LEAD:  THE PARADISE MOTEL.
By Eric McCormack. (Viking, $17.95.) Eric McCormack's brilliant and unsettling first novel steeps itself in mystery, horror and suspense to tell a story about the very art of storytelling.
Each character in ''The Paradise Motel'' is a teller of tales, which makes them all liars, and no one's words are to be trusted.

10 Questioned Over Bomb Found on Saudi Jet
LEAD: The police questioned 10 passengers today about a bomb found on Thursday aboard a Saudi jumbo jet carrying 339 people.
The bomb failed to go off, and the plane returned safely to Pakistan.


Cautious Slovaks Yearn for a Bit of Breathing Room
LEAD: Unlike their Czech countrymen in Prague, 175 miles to the northwest, few Slovaks in this city of 500,000 on the Danube rushed into the streets singing and dancing last night when the resignation of the party leadership was announced.

CONDUCT UNBECOMING?

PLAN FOR HOMELESS IS CALLED MODEST
LEAD: Advocates for the homeless welcome the Bush Administration's plans for helping homeless people as important and symbolic steps, but they say the proposal is too modest to have much impact on the growing problem.


Europe's Changes Mean Earlier Word of Attack
LEAD: American intelligence experts have concluded that the United States is likely to have about a month or more of warning of a full-scale Soviet attack in Europe, or far more than it previously thought, Administration officials say.

LEAD: The crack business, it turns out, is a modern, brutalized version of a 19th-century sweatshop.


CONDUCT UNBECOMING?

Question Of the Week; Will Soccer Ever Be Popular In the U.S.?
LEAD: With one swipe of his left foot, Paul Caligiuri, a United States midfielder, has brought soccer closer to that goal than ever.

Scarsdale Bridal For Ellen Glaser
LEAD: At the Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale, N.Y., Ellen Glaser, a reporter for The Federal Times in Springfield, Va., was married last evening to Scott Rafshoon, a political reporter for The Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, Va.
Rabbi Jack Stern and Cantor Stephen Merkel officiated.


A View of Warhol Surfaces From The Old Underground
LEAD: ''Andy was a person.
Just like we are.
Just like you are.'' Perhaps.
But so many people have taken credit for inventing Andy Warhol that Lou Reed's observation sounds less obvious than it should.
Warhol himself apparently liked nothing better than having fake Andys all over the place.
And he generally delighted in whatever myths about him might be in circulation.


Correction
LEAD: The Prospects column last Sunday about the New Yorker magazine misidentified the magazine's purchaser and misstated its purchase price.
Advance Publications Inc. acquired the magazine for $168 million.


Census Confronting Worker Shortness
LEAD: A FEW months ago Donald R. Byrnes was cautiously optimistic.
Even a month ago, he was only ''mildly anxious.'' These days, he is still trying to keep his cool, he says, but it is getting more and more difficult.


Czechoslovakia's Opulent Spas
LEAD: For centuries, Carlsbad and Marienbad - the German names for Czechoslovakia's most famous spa towns, Karlovy Vary and Marianske Lazne - drew Europe's most prominent political and artistic figures.


Pastimes; Chess
LEAD: It makes good sense to reverse the course of a game against the average opponent because the chances are he will either not catch on to the alteration of circumstances or be too slow or timid to react forcefully.
But it is a different story if you are up against the world champion.


Marcos Associate Slips Back Into Manila
LEAD: A business and political associate of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos has slipped into the Philippines in a homecoming that took the Government by surprise and raised the hopes of Marcos supporters.

PITTSBURGH CLEANS UP ITS ACT
LEAD: BILL JOHNSON KILLS THE ENGINE OF HIS RUBYRED Mercury Astro and lets the sleek fiberglass bass boat drift along the steep northern shore of the Monongahela River, into the heart of Pittsburgh.


How to Beat Prepay Charge For Air Tickets
LEAD: More and more airlines are assessing penalties, known as prepay charges, for travelers who book an advance-purchase seat through a travel agent but get the ticket issued at the airport.
There is a way to get around the penalty, which is usually about $25, but it requires a bit of planning.


What Gorbachev Wants From the Pope
LEAD: IT was Stalin who asked derisively how many divisions the Pope had.
Now, a successor who would dismantle Stalin's legacy is about to journey to Rome, recognizing that what the Pope may lack in troop strength he compensates for with a moral and political force that even the Kremlin must respect.


New Japan Car War Weapon: A 'Little Engine That Could'
LEAD: Having attracted American buyers for years with high quality and reliability, Japanese auto makers are now moving to win sales with a new competitive edge: technically advanced engines that burn fuel more efficiently and produce more power than most American engines.


ENVY, THE WRITER'S DISEASE
LEAD: It used to be like a fever with me, a compulsion, a madness: to go into a bookstore, head straight for the brand-new books, flip right to the back of the jacket and see if the author was young or old, my age or even - rats! - younger.
Envy is a vocational hazard for most writers.
It festers in one's mind, distracting one from one's own work, at its most virulent even capable of rousing the sufferer from sleep to brood over another's triumph.


The High Price of Smiling
LEAD: ALMOST everyone I know has a driver's license, yet none of my friends have ever shown theirs to me.
Perhaps they are as ashamed of the photograph on it as I am of mine.
People usually don't show them around, proudly, like baby pictures.
Instead, they are carefully hidden in billfolds or handbags, retrieved only when identification is required.


Czechoslovakia's Next Step Is Even Trickier
LEAD: ''I'VE been a reform Communist all my life,'' said a party loyalist in his late 50's a couple of weeks ago. ''They've always told me that it was still too early for my kind of thinking.
Now I'm afraid it's too late.''


Psychoanalyzing Vienna and Its Oedipus Complex
LEAD: FIFTY years after Freud died in London, Vienna is dutifully paying respect to its famous son.
This fall a stream of exhibits and other commemorations has reminded the Viennese of their association with the founder of psychoanalysis, who lived in this city for 78 years.
But psychoanalysts here say that behind Vienna's public acknowledgments is a deep ambivalence toward Freud and his ideas.


Review/Dance; A Jazz-Modern Mix From Michiyo Tanaka
LEAD: Michiyo and Dancers, a New York-based company directed by Michiyo Tanaka, a Japanese-born choreographer, shared a program with the Sapporo Seibi Dance Company, a visiting troupe from Sapporo, Japan, on the evening of Nov. 17 at Gould Hall.
Both groups combined jazz with various modern-dance styles.

Commercial Property: Long Island City; Ambitious Projects Delayed as Conversions Proceed
LEAD: Two New York City agencies - the Planning Commission and the Public Development Corporation - are preparing blueprints for the brighter future that seems to be in store for Long Island City now that Citicorp has planted a striking Manhattan-style office tower there.


Boy Found Dead on Elevator
LEAD: A 12-year-old boy was found dead yesterday after he apparently had been playing on top of an elevator in a Harlem building, the Housing Authority police said.
The body of the boy, Walter McMillan, was found about 5:30 P.M. atop the elevator car, which was at the 27th floor of the Polo Ground housing project at 2955 Frederick Douglass Boulevard, said Sgt.


A New Industry Springs Up: Europe 1992
LEAD: While many American businesses are still trying to figure out how to take advantage of the 12-nation European Community's move to a single market economy in 1992, others are already profiting from it.


A Token of a Purposeful Life
LEAD: MANY years ago, I inherited my father's pocket watch, a timepiece that had significance well beyond its practical use as a monitor of moments.
It was a symbol of passage, an engraved token of termination, awarded 45 years ago by the management of the Soluble Coffee Division of General Foods at the culmination of a lifetime of service.


Bringing Basic Health Care to the Poor
LEAD: WITH the approach of winter, New York City's hospitals are bracing for what is fast becoming a sorry seasonal ritual: huge numbers of patients, many with preventable illnesses, packed double to a berth or spilling into emergency room hallways, waiting hours for treatment and, when needed, admission to scarce beds.


Review/Cabaret; Chita Rivera a la Vaudeville
LEAD: Chita Rivera, at age 56, personifies the tough-as-nails show-business trouper determined to stay on the boards as long as she can kick up her heels and play the raucous life of the party.


Hearing at Hand for Captain In Oil Spill in Alaskan Sound
LEAD: Lawyers for the tanker captain accused of allowing the nation's worst oil spill to occur will seek to have his case thrown out of court on claims of immunity, a flawed sobriety test and other grounds, in a hearing that begins Monday.


PLANE IN SALVADOR WITH SOVIET ARMS CRASHES AND 4 DIE
LEAD: A light plane carrying two dozen Soviet-made antiaircraft missiles crashed in eastern El Salvador today on what Government officials said was a mission to resupply leftist guerrillas here with weapons from Nicaragua.


SHOWDOWN AT WINDOW ROCK
LEAD: UNDER THE BRILLIANT BLUE ARIZONA SKY, AN air-conditioned GMC Sierra bumps along a weed-choked wagon track near the main road to Kaibito, just south of Many Waters Lake, at the foot of the Peak Where the Wildcats Stretch.
In the back seat, Peter MacDonald, the embattled leader of the Navajo nation, peers through the tinted glass window at a distant figure on horseback.


HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES

PARENTS AND CHILDREN
LEAD:  WHY KIDS LIE: How Parents Can Encourage Truthfulness.
By Paul Ekman with Mary Ann Mason Ekman and Tom Ekman. (Scribners, $17.95.) This thoughtful and provocative book is much better than its title suggests.
Mr.
Ekman, a research psychologist, has spent years studying the phenomenon of truth and its distortion, and he's taken all that he's learned and applied it to young people learning to be adults and to the parents struggling to help them.


Michigan Gains Rose Bowl Slot
LEAD: The evidence was clear: Michigan had the better team today against Ohio State.
But it took the Wolverines almost forever to prove that and to confirm their reservations for the Tournament of Roses.


Are Many Salespeople Stumped?
LEAD: In the beginning of the personal computer age, many executives were appalled at the low quality of sales help.
Some salespeople could not answer basic questions.
Worse, some passed off their wild guesses as expertise.
As years went by, salespeople climbed the learning curve along with users, and it became fairly rare to find a dunce selling equipment in the major stores.


A Stellar Quartet Offers Brahms
LEAD: ISAAC STERN, Jaime Laredo, Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax are scheduled to record the two Brahms Piano Quartets, but before that they have decided to play the towering masterworks in concert.
One of the concerts will be at 8 P.M.
Friday in Woolsey Hall in New Haven (432-4159).
The other will be at 3 P.M.


BERN
LEAD: The Bernese may have a reputation for staidness, but they did noticeably rejoice when a female among the brown Alpine bears that are kept in a pit near the Nydegg Bridge whelped early this year.
There had been no cubs in 1988, and the happy event was felt to augur well for Switzerland's capital.
The bear is Bern's emblem; the city's name is believed to be derived from the German word for bear.

New York:  Simon &amp; Schuster. $18.95.

LEAD: Michael Jordan's 29 points, 14 rebounds and 9 assists led the Chicago Bulls to a 104-91 victory over the Golden State Warriors today.


Neediest Cases Fund Begins 78th Appeal
LEAD: The Christmas decorations that appeared everywhere last week, the throngs of shoppers, the anticipation of a joyous holiday season - none of this can camouflage the poverty and pain in the metropolitan area.


A Century's Worth Of Decoys Alight At the Peabody
LEAD: The most memorable carved and painted ducks, geese and shorebirds exhibited in ''Tollers and Tattlers: Massachusetts Waterfowl Decoys 1840-1940,'' at the Peabody Museum here, are rarely the prettiest or most realistic renderings.
Of the 193 decoys shown, the most compelling are the working varieties made for hunters, to pull birds from the sky.

LEAD:  AMELIA EARHART  A Biography.
By Doris L. Rich.
Illustrated. 322 pp.
Washington:  Smithsonian Institution Press. $19.95.

Martin's Press. $22.95.


Can Movies Teach History?
LEAD: Something strange - not new, but ever more conspicuous - haunts the cultural landscape.
Movie makers and television producers have become our most powerful, though perhaps not our most careful, historians.
It seems fair to say that more people are getting their history, or what they think is history, from the movies these days than from the standard history books.


SPIES &amp; THRILLERS
LEAD: On the very first page of THE TITAN GAME by Niven Busch (Random House, $17.95), it is clear that we are in the presence of a real writer.
The topic is weapons. ''Never before in history had there been such a glut of weapons of all kinds: weapons lurking with eyes agleam in the black holes of outer space; weapons that could pop out of the void and kill at ten times the speed of sound; weapons as small as pinheads and as big as cathedrals; .


Fashion; Glamorous Comfort in Party Shoes
LEAD: Holiday shoes for men and women are ornate yet practical this season.
Women's shoes are lavishly embellished, but designed with low heels and high vamps.
For men, the fussy dance pump with its round toe and grosgrain bow is supplemented with daytime styles - lace-up or slip-on - made in elegant materials like faille, satin or gleaming patent leather.


Outdoors; Unusual Repasts With Foragers
LEAD: I have before me a series of snapshots of a mink trying to yank a pickerel from an angler's hand.


Fright Mail
LEAD: More than a fib but less than a fraud - that's how one member of Congress describes a postal phenomenon known as ''fright mail.'' These are solicitations sent out by organizations with names like the ''Social Security Protection Bureau'' or the ''Internal Review Service,'' often in official-looking envelopes bearing the notice: ''Official Business.


'They're Sold on Patriotism'
LEAD: DAVID R. WALLACE of New Haven, a lieutenant colonel in the Army and a Vietnam combat pilot decorated seven times for heroism, has had a new challenge for the past year, as the Army's chief recruiter in Connecticut.

LEAD: Twenty-one people were injured when a Korean Air Lines jet with 54 people on board crashed and caught fire on takeoff today from Kimpo Airport in Seoul, a spokesman said.


A Town Where the Mayor Oversees Crime
LEAD: The real crime capital of the world may be a small town nestled in a rural Virginia forest where bank robberies, kidnappings and deadly extortion plots are running rampant.
The town's mayor shrugs it off with a serene smile.


Andrew Young Going Afield to Run for Governor
LEAD: Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta is aggressively traveling the state these days, buttonholing all who will listen to his plans for a run at the Governor's mansion in 1990.


Four 'Liaisons,' But Only One Is Dangereuse
At a cocktail party full of jazzy music, tinkling ice cubes and an aura of boozy flirtation, a French diplomat named Valmont stalks the room, making eyes at women wearing little black dresses.
His wife, Juliette, has plotted this event as part of her ambitious campaign to further her husband's career, but her sultry eyes are also on the lookout for desirable men.
They are cold-blooded opportunists with a notorious open marriage, these Valmonts, played by Jeanne Moreau and Gerard Philipe in a world-weary manner.
But, directed by the less-than-artistic Roger Vadim, this first screen version of ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' was hardly a timeless triumph.
In 1959, having earned a bad-boy reputation with ''And God Created Woman,'' Mr.
Vadim took up Choderlos de Laclos's classic 1782 novel of sexual manipulation and romantic war games and sent it skittering toward the 60's.
Here, when Valmont falls desperately in love with an apparently unattainable woman, she is a ski bunny with hair teased up like Brigitte Bardot's.


A Correction
LEAD: The name of one of the writers of a letter published Nov. 19 under the subheading ''Northern Bigotry'' did not appear correctly.
He is Michael J. Graetz, Justus S. Hotchkiss Professor of Law at Yale University.


The Bishop and the Truce of Tolerance
LEAD: The Roman Catholic Bishop of San Diego has denied communion to Lucy Killea, a state Assemblywoman, because as a candidate for California's Senate she strongly advocates the pro-choice position in the abortion debate.


Plan for a Community Of Laotians Stirs Debate
LEAD: A LAOTIAN immigrant, hoping to preserve Laotian heritage in his new country, wants to build a community of 25 homes for Laotian refugees in the small Tolland County town of Willington, but some residents see it as a shunning of American ways and plan to fight the proposal.


POSTINGS: TriBeCa Warehouse; From 4 Buildings, One
LEAD: Four 100-year-old buildings that had stood vacant for a decade on the eastern end of the block bounded by Laight, Vestry, Varick and Hudson Streets in TriBeCa have been renovated into a warehouse intended primarily for household goods.
Called the New York Security Mini Storage, the six-story facility near the Manhattan end of the Holland Tunnel that incorporates the adjacent buildings will have 28 Laight Street as its address.


Feeding Raccoons: Other Viewpoints
LEAD: I'd like to point out to Janet Pollak (''My 7 Visitors and How They Really Love to Eat,'' Opinion Page, Oct. 22) that one person's raccoon food is another person's decaying garbage.
I don't want to be labeled a curmudgeon, so I won't write about the human need for the unconditional love given by pets.


Amy Gantzel Wed To Mark Godfrey
LEAD: Amy Frances Gantzel and Mark Holland Godfrey were married yesterday by the Rev.
Gregory Floyd at St.
Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Aspen, Colo.
The bride, 25 years old, is the daughter of Roberta Robson of Victoria, British Columbia, and Steen Gantzel of Aspen.
Her husband, 27, a son of the late Mr.


POSTINGS: West of Broadway; Rialto Rehabs
LEAD: Cleaning and dressing up the exteriors of two theaters just west of Broadway in Manhattan's rialto is costing their owner about $900,000.
The facade of the Ritz Theater, at 219 West 48th Street, has just been cleaned and renovated for $400,000 and the Virginia Theater, at 245 West 52d Street, is undergoing a more extensive facelift that will also replace the marquee and doors at a total cost of $500,000.


Campus Life: Washington; Fans and Police Clash as Goal Post Is Uprooted, Prompting an Inquiry

LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Mark Michelson of Brookline, Mass., have announced January wedding plans for their daughter Ruth Leah Michelson and David Kahan, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Alfred Kahan of Brookline.


Voice of the Turtle: What to Do With Pets
LEAD: I'd like to answer the question that Linda Martin asked in her excellent ''From an Empty Nest, the Voice of the Turtle'' (Nov. 5).
That is, ''What to do with pets when their owners leave for college.'' As the adoption chairperson for the New York Turtle and Tortoise Society, I have had to find numerous homes for turtles like Ms.


Lifestyle; Learning to Be a Beer Connoisseur
LEAD: Raspberry ale? Is this man serious?


Plan for Sun-Hogging Tower Angers Kenyans
LEAD: The construction of the tallest office tower in Africa on a sprawling, tree-studded city park here has provoked unusual popular hostility in a country where opposition to official projects is voiced with care.


The Struggle To Sell Tickets
LEAD: Fred Rosen keeps a stuffed wizard on his credenza, a gift from a business associate who applauded his seemingly magical transformation of a nearly bankrupt company into one of the largest entertainment ticketing companies in the nation.


Will Cuts Help the Deficit?
LEAD: REDUCTIONS in military spending will not produce a pot of money for domestic programs any time soon.
Nor will the cuts make it easier for President Bush and Congress to lower the budget deficit next year.
The deficit problem is simply too daunting and potential Pentagon cuts too gradual to make much short-term difference.


The Nuclear Industry Tries Again
LEAD: Right now, the American nuclear power industry appears headed for extinction.
Every plant of the more than 100 ordered since 1973 has been canceled, and many others are approaching retirement.
But reactor manufacturers say that fears of global warming - the greenhouse effect - are giving them a second chance.


Fashion: On the Street; The Mundane Soars On Flights of Fancy
LEAD: The fall fashion accessory is often much more than just a scarf, a handbag, a bracelet or a pair of earrings.

No Drug Found in Falcon
LEAD: Medical investigators said today that the Falcons' rookie offensive tackle Ralph Norwood had apparently not taken drugs or alcohol before he was killed in an automobile crash eight miles from the Falcons' training center.


Pacifism Motivated Holocaust Deeds
LEAD: In Judy Chicurel's thorough article on the people of Le Chambon, France, who saved thousands of Jews during World War II (''Film Recalls 'Conspiracy of Goodness''' Oct. 29) one amplification is necessary if we are to understand why those French villagers took such enormous risks.

Keeping an Identity in a World of Hyphenated Surnames

A Portrait of Richard Burton Probes His Psyche MICHAEL BILLINGTON: Michael Billington is drama critic of The Guardian.
LEAD: Like Ken Russell, John Schlesinger and John Boorman, Tony Palmer is a graduate of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the 1960's: what has come to be seen, in retrospect, as the Golden Age of British television.
But where many of his former colleagues have become movie directors, Mr.
Palmer is best known as a maker of musical documentaries (including studies of Maria Callas, Benjamin Britten and William Walton) and feature-length portraits of composers (most recently Shostakovich in ''Testimony'').


Class Consciousness: The Pros and Cons
LEAD: The scrapbook-ready 1980's moment in ''Immediate Family,'' the film about a comfortable middle-class couple seeking to adopt the baby of an unwed lower-class teen-ager, is the one in which the prospective parents look at snapshots of the pregnant girl's family.
Her late mother, a lank-haired hippie, is seen standing beside a clothesline; her stepfather, a truck driver, is positioned in front of a small house with a factory in the background.


Critics Pick Some Favorites Of the Year;  Luminous Mendelssohn Led by Mackerras
LEAD: The record that gave me the greatest pleasure and demanded the most repeated listening this year was Sir Charles Mackerras's second CD outing with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, a luminous Mendelssohn ''Italian'' Symphony paired with a light-textured, elfin performance of eight extracts from the ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' incidental music (Virgin VC 7 90725).


'If There Was Light'
LEAD: These incredible days of November 1989 have been crowded with political wonders.
But for me nothing could equal the emotions of the moment when Alexander Dubcek stood before 300,000 people in Wenceslas Square, Prague, and said: ''I am among you again.''


Thieves Get Rich in Scrap Metal Boom
LEAD: Over the past two years, this city has stuggled with a new form of highway robbery: Thieves have ripped out $120,000 worth of underground copper wires from street lights, knocking out the lights and leaving roads dangerously dark.


Farewells and On to Moscow for Younger Set

Review/Opera; New Leads In 'Frau'
LEAD: Bare competence does not harm operas like ''Die Frau Ohne Schatten,'' but the three new singers in the Metropolitan Opera's current production of Strauss's opera hardly did it much good.


Pastimes; Bridge
LEAD: The result of the Reisinger Board-a-Match Team Championship that concluded the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals in Lancaster, Pa. last weekend represented one minor surprise and one major one.

Will he acknowledge that when water and electricity finally were brought to the camp it was under


The Real Superpower At the Summit Will Be The Force of History
LEAD: PRESIDENT BUSH and Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet each other off the coast of Malta next week at one of those rare moments when you can hear the pages of history turning - a moment when the 40-year-old arrangements of the postwar world are coming to an end and demanding redefinition.
But Mr.
Bush and Mr.


For 'Clown Ministry,' Laughter Is Gospel

A Museum That Exhibits The Lives of Workers
LEAD: THE Dog Museum in Manhattan proved long ago that nothing is immune to preservation.

CONDUCT UNBECOMING?
LEAD: David Baltimore is well known to me and to many other scientists as an eminently honorable man (''Conduct Unbecoming,'' by Philip Weiss, Oct. 29).

LEAD: HOME prices in New Jersey sharply outpaced income growth in the 1980's and exacerbated a worsening housing outlook, said a study released last week.


Question Of the Week; Will Soccer Ever Be Popular In the U.S.?
LEAD: Frankly, I find soccer as exciting as watching ice melt.
The sport has evolved into a series of 0-0, 1-0, and 2-1 games.
Unless the rules and strategy open up to the point where a single goal is not something to riot over, I doubt the sport will ever capture the hearts and imagination of the American sports fan.

LEAD: THE Board of Legislators, seeking what some members said was a much-needed bipartisan spirit, took steps to change its leadership last week as it began work on reducing the county's first $1 billion budget.

Light Mayonnaise, Light Dogfood, and Now Light Ice Cream
LEAD: Food manufacturers and diet marketers are seeing to it that the demand for low-calorie foods does not go unsated.
The selection of ''light'' foods is limitless: mayonnaise, canned fruit, popcorn and dog food.
Even Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc., usually a super-rich ice cream, recently announced a new light version.


The City's New Ethics: Too Strict, Too Loose Or Simply Confusing?
LEAD: POSSIBLY as early as January, or maybe not until July, all New York City employees will come under new ethics rules restricting post-government employment that are stricter than the current rules, or maybe not strict enough.


The Met on Radio And Its Impact On American Taste
LEAD: When America - or at least opera-loving America - hunkers down before the family radio console this Saturday afternoon, it will be celebrating more than the advent of yet another national broadcast season of the Metropolitan Opera.
This season marks the 50th anniversary of Texaco's sponsorship of the broadcasts, an astonishing span in the flighty history of


Evening Hours; At Charity Galas, Ballet, Samba And Lots of Food
LEAD: Elegant evening dresses and the sparkle of jewels brought grace and glitter to a week of charity galas.

Scholars Say Veneer of Nonchalance Masks Worry on German Unification
LEAD: Experts at American universities say anxiety about the prospect of German reunification is widespread in Europe and the United States despite declarations by Western leaders that they are unconcerned and that the issue should be resolved by the Germans themselves.


Pastimes; Around the Garden
LEAD: For This Week: If the Thanksgiving Day snow has melted, plant bulbs; they are better in the ground at this late date rather than tossed and forgotten in the back of a garage or toolshed.
Be sure the compost pile is securely piled so it does not blow down or away in winter storms.
Lightly prune rambler and climbing roses, if their canes are subject to wind damage.

Gerald C. Hensley of Wellington, New Zealand.
A May wedding is planned.


THE KIMBELL MUSEUM
LEAD: A Kahn Favorite


Review/Theater; The Varieties of Life's Illumination, in 'Brightness'
LEAD: For Ping Chong, ''Brightness'' is an experiment in light and sound, a surrealistic canvas of nonserial images.
This new work (at La Mama Annex) is a small play of sensory but not intellectual stimulation.
As such, it should be considered a sidelight to Mr.
Chong's venturesome career as an author and director of conceptual theater.


Where the Brokers Are Still Smiling
LEAD: It's business as usual at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. and, considering the cutbacks on Wall Street these days, that is pretty remarkable.
Take the branch near here in suburban Frontenac.
One recent day, as the markets remained lackluster, there was the hum of business in the air.
Phones were ringing, brokers were chatting up clients and plans were being made to find desks for people who had just been hired.


Diversity of Works In Clay and Glass

Collecting Objectivty
LEAD: FREUD DESCRIBED COLLECTORS AS MISERLY, PEDANTIC, STUBBORN and compulsively tidy.
And indeed, most do confess their boundless penchant for objects is, well, a little eccentric. ''Anybody who collects is obsessed,'' says Sue Railey, an international representative for Christie's who has spent most of her life scouring flea markets and junk shops around the world.


Constance Kennedy, Teacher, Marries

James Grant, a Unitarian minister.


Durable 'Wiz' Revived On Bridgeport Stage
LEAD: THE transformation of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' into an all-black, jive-talking pop-rock gospel musical was no mere gimmick. ''The Wiz'' still works, and the festive, amiable production at the Downtown Cabaret Theater in Bridgeport attests its durability.


Ms. Motley Wed To J. C. Fischer
LEAD: Sarah H. Motley and J. Christopher Fischer were married yesterday at Trinity Episcopal Church in Princeton, N.J.
The Rt.
Rev.
William G. Burrill, the Episcopal Bishop of Rochester, and the Rt.
Rev.
Barbara C. Harris, the Suffragan Bishop of Massachusetts, performed the ceremony.


Style Makers; Scott Barrie, Fashion Designer
LEAD: Scott Barrie, who was known for designing sexy matte jersey dresses in the 1960's and 70's, has a new line and a whole new look.
After five years in Milan, working for Krizia, the Italian high-fashion house, he is now doing a collection of sportswear, knits and leather clothes under his own name.


SHOREHAM: A BAD IDEA THAT WON'T GO AWAY

Pennsylvania County Rejects Displaying of Nativity Scene

As the Wall Came Tumbling Down
LEAD: THE FOLLOWING IS THE RECORD OF a recent visit to East Berlin, at a time when the burst of freedom that greeted the opening of the borders to the West on Nov. 9 was still an anxiously held breath; when even the most optimistic could not imagine such a swift and fortunate denouement.
The drama, of course, is just beginning.


PRESSURING PERDUE
LEAD: HENRY SPIRA WORKS FROM home, a roomy rent-controlled apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side that looks like an office first, a cat playground second, and his residence only as an afterthought.
One room is dominated by word-processing equipment.
A second is filled with floor-to-ceiling shelves laden with files.


A Ballet Is a Ballet Is a Masterpiece
LEAD: No one makes ballets like ''A Wedding Bouquet'' anymore.
Even Sir Frederick Ashton, who choreographed this beguiling business in 1937, never created another work that stood so apart - in its multiplicity of meaning, mix of hilarity and poignancy and, most unexpectedly, its amalgam of a modernist text by Gertrude


The Steel Band Goes Mainstream
LEAD: Conrad Jordan has a proprietary interest in the steel drum, which he describes as ''the only musical instrument invented in this century and the only musical instrument invented in the Western Hemisphere.'' For more than 25 years Mr.
Jordan has been tuning steel drums and has made a life's work out of studying how the drum - also known as a pan or steel piano - is made.


Risks of Betting On Your Team
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Deadline Looms
LEAD: They haven't been built in a day, and at the rate construction has been going on 12 Italian soccer stadiums for the 1990 World Cup, there is some question as to whether they can be built at all, at least in time for the May deadline.


Homeless Man Gets Boost in Life
LEAD: SOMETIMES in the evening Stephen Pearman and his wife, Helena, jog along the boardwalk near their Asbury Park apartment.
They lean against the rail and watch the waves spill onto the jetty.


INSIDE THE INTIFADA
LEAD: The reference to Arabs lining up to find day work in '' 'slave markets' in Jerusalem'' is beneath contempt.
When longshoremen are picked out to unload ships in the United States, is this a ''slave market''?
If Arab contractors pick up laborers, is this a ''slave market''?
And at what hour would one expect laborers to line up if they expect to do a full days' work, if not before 8 A.M.?


Dragging The Ocean For Winter's Bounty
LEAD: AFTER spending more than a month overhauling and winterizing his fishing boat, ET, Tony Sougstad is ready for the rugged season.


Susan Morris Is Engaged

Carl Morris of Pittsburgh, have announced.
Miss Morris, 25 years old, is an administrative assistant for employee benefits at the Burson Marsteller public relations company in New York.


A Sampling of Spas
LEAD: Viewed from afar, Czech and Hungarian spas seem oddly medicinal places.
Government-approved brochures come laced with words like ''acidulous'' and ''anti-inflammatory'' and promise rejuvenated muscles, kidneys, blood and heart.


Quiet Art Need Not Be Boring or Wimpish
LEAD: The spotlight of the art world is rarely drawn to art that is quiet and discreet.
New York is so noisy, so swollen with information, so restless with issues that seem to demand immediate attention, that reticent, self-contained art is easily overlooked or dismissed.
There is a general assumption - particularly in New


Law Professor Takes Soviets by Storm With Crisp Oratory and Hard Work
LEAD: The fastest rising political star in the Soviet Union is not a Communist Party luminary, flamboyant populist, angry dissident or smoldering nationalist.


A-Hunting They Will Go
LEAD: AT 5 A.M. on the William Floyd Parkway in Suffolk, no creatures are stirring, not even a raccoon.
It is so dark, so still, you don't know if it's morning or evening, and your body begs not to find out.


From Obscurity to Spotlight, Urbanek Faces the Skeptics
LEAD: Karel Urbanek, a Communist Party functionary unknown abroad and little known in his own nation before he was surprisingly chosen as Communist Party chief, found himself in his first day in office at the center of swelling criticism.
He was forced to go on television to appeal to the Czechoslovak nation for understanding.


Soaking in the Pashas' Pools
LEAD: Budapest is a bather's dream city.
Nowhere else in the world will you find this combination of a rich cultural life, magnificent architecture and good restaurants with endless possibilities for bathing and swimming in pools fed by thermal springs.


Correction
LEAD: A headline last Sunday about the Rev.
Leonid Kishkovsky, an Orthodox priest, described the National Council of Churches incorrectly.
It links 32 Christian denominations, not just Protestants.


Style Makers; Yan Basel, Decorative Artist ARTIST
LEAD: On a visit to New York this month, Yan Basely thought about the artists who inspired his decorative designs, paintings that lend themselves to fabric, wallpaper and carpet. ''Watteau was always important,'' he said.
Right now he is thinking of Thomas Hart Benton.

Stephen Chinlund, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony at the Greens Farms Congregational Church in Westport,


Wallpaper Without Tears
LEAD: APPLYING wallpaper is no longer the tricky, messy task it once was.
Although stronger paper and slower-drying adhesives have eased the job considerably, achieving smooth-surfaced results still depends on preparing the wall carefully before applying the paper.


Michael Harwood, 55, Naturalist
LEAD: Michael Harwood, an author and naturalist, died of an embolism Friday at the University of California at San Diego Medical Center, where he had undergone arterial surgery.

Illegal Apartments And Realtor Profits
LEAD: If Bill Cook (''Illegal Apartments: Let's Face Facts,'' Letter, Oct. 22) was really interested in stating statistics, they should be the amount of profits Realtors (like himself) are raking in at the expense of the taxpayer.

New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. $22.95.


Union Square: Gritty Past, Bright Future
LEAD: The people who live in the vicinity of Union Square are engaged in heated debate about the future of real estate development in their neighborhood.
Some equate development with progress, saying that until the last few years the area was regarded by many as having no future at all; others worry that too much development will ruin its social and architectural diversity.


At Last, an 'Event' That Really Is an Event
LEAD: We have learned to cringe from superstar personal appearances, but when Kathleen Battle and Placido Domingo gave a joint operatic concert during the Metropolitan Opera's Tokyo engagement last year, something was going right.
Maybe the plan to issue a Deutsche Grammophon recording (427 686; CD and cassette) made it special; maybe the participation of James Levine (appearing for the first time in Japan) added a sense of occasion and pride.


Pastimes; Stamps
LEAD: Few people other than philatelists know the location of Alaouites or Zil Elwannyen Sesel.
Who but a stamp collector would track down 52 cancellations used in Titusville, Pa.?


Inmate Charged in Pennsylvania Prison Riot
LEAD: An inmate whose sentence was to have expired today was the first to be charged in connection with two nights of riots last month at Camp Hill State Prison in which 123 guards and inmates were injured, the police said today.

Salvador Rebels Lose Touch, But Still Show Their Strength
LEAD: WITH something approaching awe, the rebel looked at the hotel room - a double bed, a carpet, a private bath and a tiled shower.
That may be standard in any motel in the United States, but it is unfathomable luxury for most Salvadorans. ''I'm from the countryside,'' the guerrilla said. ''I've never been in San Salvador before.


A Spring Ceremony For Sandy Weinberger
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Morton Weinberger of Delray Beach, Fla., have announced the engagement of their daughter Sandy Weinberger to Steven Sloane, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

In Moscow, Support for Pole Is Moral but Not Financial
LEAD: Poland's Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said today that he had achieved ''complete unanimity'' with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on key issues of European security, but he evidently won no immediate help from the Kremlin in dealing with his economic crisis.


CONDUCT UNBECOMING?
LEAD: Dr.
Baltimore showed considerable hubris in asserting that, by confronting Representative Dingell, he was ''acting in the best interests of all scientists. . . .'' As one trained in the sciences, I do not want him speaking for me.


The Meaning of Berlin
LEAD: The second World War was plotted in Berlin, and since Germany's defeat its former capital has been at the focal point of most of the serious crises threatening another major war.
This underscores the meaning of the opening of the wall and the transformation of Eastern Europe.

LEAD: The East German leader, Egon Krenz, made a surprise visit to Leipzig this morning, strolling confidently through the reform movement's stronghold just one day after announcing that the Communist Party wants to surrender its constitutional monopoly on political power.


INSIDE THE INTIFADA
LEAD: I looked carefully at the pictures that accompanied your article, and saw young men, their faces covered, armed with stones and firebombs.
They seemed well-dressed, in blue jeans and sweat shirts.
I did not see torn clothing; indeed, the general impression was one of strength and good health.


APPLE POLISHING
LEAD: I don't understand how Marcia Adams can say that the Apple Cake With Hot Caramel Sauce ''will keep for a week'' (Food: ''Apple Polishing,'' Oct. 8).
Only part of mine ever made it into the fridge, and that lasted only until the next day.
Thank you for a delicious recipe.

Jones Beach Shows: A Local Decision
LEAD: In a comprehensive article about the Jones Beach theater contract  [ ''Major Promoters Vying for Jones Beach Shows,'' Nov. 12 ] , an important point about the process by which New York State selects the entertainment for the theater appeared to have escaped your correspondent.


Collecting Sure Things
LEAD: IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE PACK RATS EXACTLY, IT'S JUST THAT THEY HAVE idees fixes about certain kinds of clothing.
So they collect them. ''I am not a collector,'' the writer Fran Lebowitz says emphatically.
Nevertheless, she has 25 pairs of jeans.
She also owns about 100 men's shirts: ''Ninety-eight of them from Brooks Brothers.


Elizabeth Glaser Plans a Wedding

Federal Plan for Police Corps Divides Officials

But some law-enforcement officials have expressed skepticism over the proposal.


Foul-Ball Damages
LEAD: Few legal principles are as established as the one that holds that when you go to a baseball game you accept the risk of being hit by a foul ball.
Courts have held so over and over.
But that particular judicial word has not gotten through to a court in Chicago.
Last week, a Cook County Circuit Court jury awarded a 16-year-old boy, Delbert Yates Jr., $67,500 of Cubs money for damages suffered when he was hit by a foul ball at Wrigley


ABOUT NEW JERSEY
LEAD: OFFICIALLY it is New Jersey State Prison, but more often than not it's called Trenton, the end of the line, the toughest maximum-security prison in New Jersey, a place from which, it is said, there are only two ways out: over the wall or with a toe tag.


Disasters Challenge Our Sense of Values
LEAD: WITHIN days of the devastation wrought by the California earthquake, the President of the United States urged Americans to contribute to the Red Cross as ''the only organization chartered and authorized by Congress to act at times of great national calamity.''


Question Of the Week; Will Soccer Ever Be Popular In the U.S.?
LEAD: Soccer in the United States will continue to struggle as long as newspapers like The Times continue to give the sport little or no ink.
With the United States now qualifying for Italy, and especially with the World Cup being held in this country in 1994, isn't it about time soccer got some expanded coverage?


Restaurant Meals Going Door to Door for the Working Public
LEAD: WHEN Duncan MacLaine and Charles Carafiello began Chefs' Express, a restaurant meal-delivery service, they said they thought their focus would be on food.
The partners have discovered, however, that their three-month-old Hartsdale-based business fills more needs than the merely dietary.


Talking: For Sale Signs; Imposing Viable Controls
LEAD: Until recently, few people made a fuss when a neighbor posted a ''For Sale'' sign on his front lawn, since it usually remained there for a just few weeks.
Moreover, the right to do so seemed - like the right to decorate a front yard at Christmas - indisputable.
It was, after all, a personal act on private property.


For Kremlin, Afghanistan Is No Europe
LEAD: As they gathered by the glow of a 40-watt bulb here one evening this week, a group of Afghans opposed to the Soviet-backed Government of President Najibullah found hope in the recent events that have unseated Communist leaders in Eastern Europe.
Government officials and Soviet diplomats, however, say the situations are not comparable.


The U.S. Shouldn't Abdicate Leadership
LEAD: The startling changes sweeping across Eastern Europe have evoked two inconsistent reactions in Washington, an exhilarating sense of historic opportunity and a debilitating sense of the limits of our resources and power.

Family Ties
LEAD: A dispute over who gave birth to 11-year-old Kimberly Michelle Mays has ended.
A point was proved, but nobody won.
Genetic tests showed 10 days ago that Kimberly was not the biological daughter of Robert and Barbara Mays, the Sarasota, Fla., couple who raised her from birth.

After that, the Giants' main rivalries were with the Dallas Cowboys and then the Washington Redskins.


Question Of the Week; Will Soccer Ever Be Popular In the U.S.?

Cowboy Music, but No Horse
LEAD: DOES anyone remember ''The Strawberry Roan,'' ''The Saginaw Trail'' and ''Texans Never Cry''?


Neo-Nebuchadnezzar
LEAD: THE RESTORATION OF THE CITY of Babylon is likely the most long overdue project in history.
It is the desire of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to restore from 2,000-year-old rubble (above, lower right) the glory of the city at its most glorious.
The was during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Babylonia's ruler from 605 to 562 B


A New Breed of Dieter Watches Weight at the Workpalce
LEAD: Men are more likely to join weight-control programs held at their workplace than those that meet in their community.
That is what the Diet Workshop branch in Dayton, Ohio, which is considered the fattest state, has discovered.
Males account for 33 percent of the 400 people enrolled in its workplace programs, but make up only 9 percent of the 3,200 dieters in its standard program.


State's Elderly Gain Influence As Lobby Group
LEAD: WHEN the House of Representatives approved a measure to expand the Medicare program to protect older Americans from the high cost of acute extended illness, all 14 members of the New Jersey delegation voted for it.
But when the House voted to repeal or curtail the Catastrophic Coverage Act last month, all 14 largely abandoned it.


Parents Debate Roles in AIDS Education
LEAD: A NEW state law that requires AIDS education in public schools is getting mixed reviews from parents.
Some say that such lessons should be taught at home and that the classes should stress abstinence rather than safe sex.
Other parents say they are relieved that the schools are offering AIDS classes.


Japan Will Help Poland and Hungary
LEAD: Responding to appeals from the Bush Administration and European nations, Japan has announced that it would provide $150 million in loans to Poland as an initial step to help both Poland and eventually Hungary deal with their financial crises and break loose from the Soviet bloc.


Wallpaper Without Tears
LEAD: APPLYING wallpaper is no longer the tricky, messy task it once was.
Although stronger paper and slower-drying adhesives have eased the job considerably, achieving smooth-surfaced results still depends on preparing the wall carefully before applying the paper.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Skiing  Schneider Captures Slalom: Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, the defending World Cup champion, who fell on her first run of the season Friday, turned in two flawless runs to win the women's slalom yesterday at Park City, Utah.

CONDUCT UNBECOMING?
LEAD: Representative John Dingell's singular ambition has been to expand his power base by grabbing any issue that is related to energy and commerce and letting loose his army of investigators.
Issues that do not interest the news media are discarded.
Mr.
Dingell needs to be taken down a peg, but none of the Democratic leadership has had the courage to rein in this modern day McCarthyite.


Question Of the Week; Will Soccer Ever Be Popular In the U.S.?
LEAD: No.
The American sports mentality simply does not have the patience or attention span for a continuous-play game.
Half the fun of football, baseball, basketball, etc., is the time when there is no action.
During these breaks we argue over the pros and cons of our team's performance, go to the refrigerator, mull our ineptitude in this week's pool picks, and on and on.


Carol Bassok Marries
LEAD: Carol M. Bassok, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Nathan Bassok of West Hartford, Conn., was married last evening to Michael B. Lowenstein, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

In Italy, a Brooder Takes a Break
LEAD: Traveling alone has its pluses: you can go where you want when you want, and you are spared that runaway irritation that comes of suddenly spotting all the little flaws in your companion (who alone seems to be detaining you from perfect enjoyment) and the tension of having to keep that knowledge secret.


Rather Than Pork, Seafood and Beans
LEAD: PORK and beans is one thing, but fish with beans?
Now that people are trying to cut down on fat (even in winter, when we crave sustaining food), there is no reason not to serve seafood instead of the usual pork, duck or ham with dried beans and peas.


Shannon Duffy to Marry
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
John Duffy of Marlborough, Mass., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Shannon Mary Duffy, to Peter Guyon Weiland Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Liquid Protein: The Diet of the Stars
LEAD: Baby boomers may prefer the concept of weight control to the diet, but they still love a good fad.

Sales of these liquid proteins have grown to $5 billion a year since the late 1970's.

Why Groovy Isn't Groovy Anymore
LEAD: By the end of 1990, record companies are saying, the vinyl LP will be mostly a memory.
Statistics are piling up: According to the Recording Industry Association of America, which monitors the larger companies, in the first half of 1989 LP's accounted for only 4 percent of the value of recordings shipped; in units, LP's were outnumbered 12 to 1 by cassettes and nearly 6 to 1 by CD's.

PARENTS AND CHILDREN
LEAD:  GROWING UP WRITING By Arlene Silberman. (Times Books, $18.95.) I wish this book had been available when my son came home from kindergarten last year, eagerly starting stories with the invented spelling he had learned through his school's ''Writing to Read'' program.
Despite my professional writing credentials and parental desire to see him enjoy writing as much as I do, in my compulsion to ''correct'' spelling and grammar I reacted like the benighted parents and educators Arlene Silberman indicts in her provocative and important new book.

Where It's Always a Day for Turkey
LEAD: LET'S talk turkey.

Thanksgiving still lives at the Three Village Inn, where every Sunday a $19.95 turkey dinner with all the trimmings is served (children, $9.95.) Even those who cannot stand to look at turkey after three days of leftovers will find something to like here.

Rather Than Pork, Seafood and Beans
LEAD: PORK and beans is one thing, but fish with beans?
Now that people are trying to cut down on fat (even in winter, when we crave sustaining food), there is no reason not to serve seafood instead of the usual pork, duck or ham with dried beans and peas.


PRAGUE OPPOSITION MOUNTS HUGE PROTEST, DENOUNCING NEW LEADERSHIP AS 'A TRICK'
LEAD: Opposition leaders redoubled their pressure on the tottering Communist regime in Czechoslovakia today, staging an immense protest rally and insisting that the shuffling of the Politburo on Friday night and further resignations this morning had failed to move the nation far enough toward democracy.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Soon after we moved into our new home, a wood toilet paper roller was accidentally flushed down the toilet.
All attempts to remove this with a snake have failed.
Sometimes the toilet flushes O.K. and other times not.
Do you know of anything that would dissolve the roller?

LEAD: Elizabeth Ann Yeiser, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

LEAD: A Havana court sentenced three Cuban human rights advocates to prison after convicting them of giving false information to foreign journalists during a drug trial last summer, the Cuban government press agency reported.


Homeless, Helpless Neediest
LEAD: New Yorkers have learned to avert their eyes.
There may now be 90,000 homeless people in New York City, and many of them have been on the streets so long they blur into the cityscape, regarded more and more as nuisance rather than tragedy.
But their misery endures, and it presents only the most visible dimension of urban degradation.


Correction
LEAD: A chart last Sunday about Vietnamese refugees arriving in three Asian countries was incorrectly labeled.
The numbers were in thousands.


Pastimes; Camera
LEAD: Watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade - from the comfort of my armchair, thank you - reminded me of the years I used to venture out early in the morning to capture the parade on film.
It never snowed, like it did this year, but it always seemed to be either bitterly cold, raining or both.


Krone's Arm Hurt
LEAD: The jockey Julie Krone suffered a fracture of her left forearm near the wrist and a dislocation of the left elbow Friday night when she was thrown from her horse and kicked in the sixth race at the Meadowlands.


A Novel Competition
LEAD: Many a benefactor of mankind would have been content with colorizing ''Casablanca.'' Not Ted Turner.
The chairman of the Turner Broadcasting System last week announced a plan to set the world's most vivid imaginations to pondering how, as time goes by, the survival and prosperity of all life on earth can be assured.


Wallpaper Without Tears
LEAD: APPLYING wallpaper is no longer the tricky, messy task it once was.

They previously expected only 14 days.


Islanders' Slide Grows Deeper

The numbers on the scoreboard change only in that they become uglier by the game.

LEAD: BUDGET officials were working late at the Pentagon last week as the Red Army Chorus launched into its program onstage at Kennedy Center, just across the river.


A Warehouse Tenant's Show of Endurance

In an Autumn Storm, Thoughts of a Hard Rain
LEAD: I WAS sitting in the grass high above Long Island Sound.
For nearly a week the North Fork area had been intensely humid, with squalls building throughout each day, and striking, usually by night, leaving in their wake immaculate skies that lasted into bright dawns, the air hot but dry.


Photojournalism: Heroism Meets Esthetics
LEAD: Photojournalism, as it has been defined by its practitioners and mythologized by their admirers, is a discipline that combines aspects of social reform, individual heroism and emotional compassion.
It also aspires to be recognized as art.
But like photography as a whole, photojournalism does not slip seamlessly into the realm of the esthetic.


Feeding Raccoons: Other Views
LEAD: It's always heartening reading something good on wildlife (Janet Pollak's ''My 7 Visitors and How They Really Love to Eat''), as well as a gustatory risible riot.


The Action Is Spirited At Public Bike Auction
LEAD: LUIS ROLDAN, an 8-year-old third grader from Highland Park, clenched a $10 bill in a fist thrust deep in his pocket.

Luis was convinced that the bike would soon be his.

Basque In It
LEAD: AS I WAS DRIVING THROUGH Nevada recently, a highway billboard proclaimed ''Winnemucca -If You Don't Visit, Who Will?''

SOUND
LEAD: According to John Keats, beauty is truth and vice versa.
Some recording artists disagree.


Critics Pick Some Favorites Of the Year; Romantic Norrington And Gelber's Beethoven
LEAD: Roger Norrington's landmark recording of Berlioz's ''Symphonie fantastique'' (Angel CDC-49543) does not obviate every previous performance, nor should it be expected to.
Good enough to please even those utterly indifferent to the early-music movement, it owes its distinction to Mr.
Norrington's remarkable sensitivity to timbral niceties and to the composer's imagination as shaped by the actual instruments of his day.


Miami Snaps Streak By Irish
LEAD: On one frenzied evening in the Orange Bowl, the University of Miami ended Notre Dame's hope for a second consecutive perfect championship season, placed what had been the longest current major-college winning streak into the past and created a new set of contenders for the top of the final football polls.


A Potpourri of Questions From Readers
LEAD: Below are answers to some recent questions from readers of the Personal Finance column.


A Revival of 'Camelot,' An Old-Style Musical
LEAD: TO no one's surprise, An Evening Dinner Theater is at its best with musicals that are tradition-bound, rather than technologically up to the minute or innovative in form.
And if ever there was an old-style musical that is worth pondering every now and again, for message as well as music, it is ''Camelot.


Reviews/Music; New-Sounding Oldies In Contemporary Series
LEAD: Series titles are often meant to be only loose indications of the music to be offered.
But at the first of this season's Music Today concerts, on Wednesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall, a listener was struck by the freedom with which the temporal part of the series' title has been stretched.
All four of the works on the program were by living composers, but only one of the pieces was written this year - or, for that matter, in the 1980's.


A CORRECTION
LEAD: The caption with a photograph of a home that accompanied an article on Jamaica Estates on Nov. 17 gave an incorrect location for the house.
It is on Midland Parkway.


Rather Than Pork, Seafood and Beans
LEAD: PORK and beans is one thing, but fish with beans?
Now that people are trying to cut down on fat (even in winter, when we crave sustaining food), there is no reason not to serve seafood instead of the usual pork, duck or ham with dried beans and peas.


Critics Pick Some Favorites Of the Year; New Energy From Pop By Droll Rappers
LEAD: Cold fusion may not have worked in science labs this year, but late-1980's popular music has been happily knocking together genres to release new energy.
De La Soul's ''3 Feet High and Rising'' (Tommy Boy 1019) sets three calm, droll rappers amid unexpected borrowings; its loopy playfulness and peace-symbol graphics were quickly dubbed ''hippie-hop.


Evidence Points to Aluminum's Link With Alzheimer's Disease
LEAD: To the Editor:


In Bulgaria's House of Humor, Satirists Seem to Miss a Beat
LEAD: The imposing bronze statue of Racho the Blacksmith stands on rocks in the middle of the Yantra River, a somewhat isolated spot for this city's legendary founder.

Salvador War: Errors on Both Sides
LEAD: The Salvadoran Army defeated the guerrillas in the battle for the cities but missed an opportunity to destroy a decade-old enemy.


Doing a Number on Opera Companies
LEAD: I've been thinking a lot lately about what is wrong with the world, and I have finally decided: data overload.
Because of the proliferation of computers and of people capable of running them, we are awash in information that nobody needs - or worse, that nobody believes.
Gatherers of statistics have great power, but they usually operate quietly.


Firefighters' Test in December
LEAD: New York City will resume its physical examination for prospective firefighters early next month even though the City Health Commissioner has warned that it can cause kidney failure, officials said yesterday.
