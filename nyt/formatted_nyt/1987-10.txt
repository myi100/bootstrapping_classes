Glimpses of Old China in Modern Beijing
LEAD: EVERY TIME I RETURN TO BEIJING AND SEE its skyline growing with cell-blocklike high-rise apartments, drive through its charmless streets and have to breathe the polluted air, I am reminded of how far the city has drifted from its past and wonder how the myth of Beijing as a beautiful city redolent of history has managed to survive its modern esthetic impoverishment.

ABETTING A BAD IMAGE OF NORTHEAST STUDENTS
LEAD: ''Taking a Freshman to College: An Education in Itself''  [ Aug. 16 ]  is the kind of article that feeds directly into Secretary of Education William J. Bennett's negative conception of the upper-middle-class college student attending private institutions in the Northeast.
The particular situation smacks of a materialism so crass as to exclude the experience of a great many entering freshmen and their parents.

WOULD YOU WATCH STRIKE TEAMS PLAY?
LEAD: Curiosity compels me to watch scab football. Conscience commands that I don't.


Hackers, Thieves and Carelessness
LEAD: THE hackers who break into a company's computers are usually on the intellectual equivalent of joyrides.

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Fanning French Fears
LEAD: THE USUALLY SOMNO-lent and sybaritic beach towns of France were the scenes this summer of a closely watched, deadly earnest political road show, a sort of itinerant political revival meeting that came complete with circus tents, impassioned speeches and rousing choruses of ''La Marseillaise.'' It marked something rarely seen in that country, at least in the relatively civil decades since World War

NASA's Manned-Space Nonsense
LEAD: Today marks the 30th anniversary of the Sputnik launching, which prompted a shocked United States Government to make a major investment in engineering and space exploration.

TWO GERMANYS, MANY VOLUMES
LEAD: Germany: one people, two nations, a rich and tortured past.
How to grasp it all?
Start chronologically with the 19th century, I suppose.

Thomas Mann's ''Buddenbrooks'' portrays the self-confident German middle class before the catastrophes of the 20th century.

A KINGDOM WAS BUILT OF CHICKENS AND CHORES

Food; AFTER QUICHE
LEAD: REMEMBER quiche Lorraine, that savory cheese and bacon tart that once spoke for all that was chic, French and gourmet?

RAVENNA'S JEWELED CHURCHES
LEAD: RAVENNA IS A PLEASANT NORTHERN ITALIAN TOWN practically on the Adriatic coast.
The city and its surroundings are flat, which makes for easy walking and accounts for the city's bicycle cult.
Bicycles are parked thickly, leaving the streets comparatively free of standing cars.


WELFARE PLAN PREVIEWS IN ATLANTIC CITY
LEAD: REACH, the state's new welfare program that was begun in Bergen and Middlesex Counties last week, makes one basic assumption: Welfare recipients really want to work.

UPDATING MOTHER GOOSE

THE QUAKERS THEN AND NOW
LEAD: As a Quaker who is very much alive on Long Island today, I read with pleasure about the current exhibition of the Nassau County Museum at the Sands Point Preserve  [ ''Recalling Quakers' Impact on L.I.'' ] .
I also appreciate the care the author took in indicating that Friends have a continuing presence as well as an illustrious past in this area.

THE END GAME HOLDS CREATIVE POTENTIAL
LEAD: IF you have not won in the opening and or the middle game, it is time to serve your opponent an end game.


New Orleans ... and All That Jazz
LEAD: IF YOU LIVE IN NEW ORLEANS, EXPECT guests.
My family and I moved here in 1985.
The guests came and there was never any problem entertaining them.
The city took care of that.
Though economically battered, New Orleans is still one of the world's great party towns - the result of a languorous climate, an abundance of food, especially from the sea, and a confluence of tolerant, somewhat exotic cultures on their unworried way to decadence.


CRAWFORD HURT IN ARMY LOSS
LEAD: Army's chances appeared hopeless today when Tory Crawford, the Cadets' best runner and passer and the nation's second-leading scorer, went out with a knee injury early in the second quarter.


EXPANSION OF MARINE POLICE IS URGED

INVENTING THE FUTURE
LEAD: If it is the premise of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (''Inventing the Future,'' by Edward Dolnick, Aug. 23) that such a think tank holds the key ''to invent [ ing ]  the future of newspapers, cinema, television and music,'' it is - or at least I hope it is - a mistaken one.


FORDHAM (4-0) TOPS ST. JOHN'S
LEAD: Eddie Pearson, a sophomore halfback, scored three touchdowns, one on a 68-yard punt return, to lead undefeated Fordham to a 34-23 triumph over St.
John's in a Liberty Conference game yesterday at Jack Coffey Field in the Bronx.


'Quilters': Swatches Of Overstatement
LEAD: NOT so sensible or cheering, in selection or in execution, is the WPI Theater's first production this season, the pseudomusical, ''Quilters.'' Here is a case of a small theater company overextended.

Arthur Mintz of Hollis, Queens, has been announced by the future bride's parents.
A May wedding is planned.


A LA CARTE
LEAD: ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT buffets conjure up visions of drab motel dining rooms crowded with hungry bargain hunters.
The Garden City Hotel's seafood buffet shatters this stereotype.


BUILDING BRIDGES THROUGH WORLD SPORT: SEOUL DREAM MOVES ON
LEAD: WHEN Seoul's bid to host the 1988 Olympic Games was first announced in April 1979, the then-president of the Korean Olympic Committee, Park Choung-kyu, a prime mover behind the idea, was unswayed by arguments that our still developing country was not in a position to either organize or afford the Games.


HONOLULU
LEAD: I DON'T USUALLY HUNT FOR ROMANTIC PLACES to dine.
I take my chances.
I let each place possess me in its own way, and wait for surfacings of special delight and poignance that will cause me to return.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: THE New York Rangers goalie, John Vanbiesbrouck, suffered a broken jaw during a practice session yesterday, but is expected to miss only a game or two of the regular season. . . .
At the age of 38, Steve Garvey may be playing his final major-league game today.
The first baseman's contract with the San Diego Padres expires after the game, the last of the season, and the club's president, Chub Feeney, said it would not be renewed.


A 'Bright Adventurer' in American Music
LEAD: PROUD AND IMPROBABLE, THE Watts Towers thrust out of a slum neighborhood in Los Angeles.
Constructed by a poor, Italian-born laborer, Simon Rodia, they are classic examples of ritualistic folk art, spires pieced together by hand from Coke bottles, seashells and every sort of found object -also known as junk - that Mr.


GIANTS FALL SHORT IN PRO REPLACEMENTS
LEAD: The Giants have four players on their replacement team with National Football League experience, and the two with the most experience worked in construction for a year before joining the team.

LEAD: The back room of politics is now as public, and as crowded, as a bus station.


Voters Will Decide Fate of Nuclear Plant in Maine
LEAD: Voters have twice rejected the idea that Maine's only nuclear power plant is too dangerous to operate, but a plan to dispose of high-level radioactive waste in Maine has created such a backlash that a third vote to shut the reactor may pass.


City Hall Notes; Yankees-City Agreement Goes Into Extra Innings
LEAD: Vincent Tese, the chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation, is evidently a positive thinker.
In September 1986, he announced that an agreement in principle had been reached with the New York Yankees, under which the baseball team would extend its lease at Yankee Stadium until the year 2022 and the city and state would build a new garage and other amenities.


Photography
LEAD: Mark Feldstein has all the instincts of a street photographer but none of the usual reliance on inherited stylistic ideas.
Since giving up painting for photography more than a decade ago, he has progressed from an early fascination with the medium's ability to describe surfaces to a sophisticated understanding of the ways in which chance and ambiguity shape the meaning of images.

Joseph H. Carey performed the ceremony at St.
Paul-on-the-Lake Roman Catholic Church in Grosse Pointe Farms.


Music: 'Influence of Jazz'
LEAD: THE International Society for Contemporary Music opened its 1987-88 season Thursday at Symphony Space with a program tracing ''The Influence of Jazz'' in compositions for chamber ensembles, soloists, electronics and tape.
It was a diverse, uneven, but frequently illuminating evening, especially when composers and performers penetrated beneath the surfaces of jazz to grapple with some of the music's processes.


If You're Thinking of Living in; Riverhead By JOHN RATHER
LEAD: TRAVELERS on the Long Island Expressway know Riverhead, if in no other way, as the town whose name appears repeatedly on traffic signs pointing east.

HISTORICAL ROOTS AT MORRISTOWN SHOW
LEAD: THE indebtedness of contemporary crafts to native American traditions often is acknowledged by artists who use those traditions as design or technical resources.


Eastern Europe for Westerners
LEAD: Not all that long ago, a correspondent reporting from Central and Eastern Europe would get the occasional letter from enterprising but somewhat timorous readers that made him feel that he ought to be asking his editor for hazard pay.
Such writers would inquire, in direct or circumlocuted terms, ''Is it safe for an American to come as a tourist to such dangerously Communist places as Poland or Hungary?


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: Because of a mechanical error, a sentence in Travel Advisory last Sunday about sales tax refunds appeared at the end of an item about a food festival in Lyons, France.
The sentence, which said refunds take six to eight weeks to be processed, should have appeared at the end of the item about the provincial sales tax in Ontario, Canada.


Film:'Near Dark,' a Tale of Vampires on the Road
LEAD: IS ''Near Dark'' a mainstream commercial movie, tinged with blood, about an Oklahoma farm boy seduced and abducted by vampires?
Or is it a fast-money thriller with artsy photography, about rowdy bloodsuckers who live like bikers and drive by night?


New F.B.I. Chief Leaves Hospital
LEAD: William S. Sessions going home yesterday after treatment for an ulcer.
He will be sworn in as the bureau's Director on Thursday. (AP)


CONNECTICUT OFFICIALS SEEK SOURCE OF LEAD IN SOIL
LEAD: Tests on soil in an impoverished neighborhood are expected to show in several weeks how the soil is being contaminated with lead that is poisoning children in northeastern Connecticut.

Saffron, Kashmir's Pot of Gold
LEAD: Kashmir is an emerald set in a ring of Himalayan mountains.
Here, in one of the world's most majestic settings, celestial benevolence has decreed that the world's most expensive spice should flourish.
At its current price in the United States, one ounce of saffron is literally worth its weight in gold.


Shortsighted on Long Shots
LEAD: America pioneered in photographing the earth from space, but its pictures for civilian use are now third best, behind those of France and the Soviet Union.
The Russians take the most precise photos.


Headliners; Defending the Realm
LEAD: It appears that the sun may have set on a bit of the Commonwealth, to the evident dismay of Queen Elizabeth II.
The Queen was unusually outspoken last week on the subject of Col.
Sitiveni Rabuka, who led a coup in the Pacific island state of Fiji, which, as a Commonwealth member, recognized the monarch as its nominal head of state.


ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD: Q. In the basement of our 80-year-old house the pipes are covered with asbestos and in some places the asbestos is cracking and flaking.
We do not use this basement for anything except storage and doing the laundry, but we are still concerned.
Should we have this repaired, and if so, by whom?


THE APPARITION OF NORTHERNNESS
LEAD: One dark wet November afternoon a few years ago, I flew in a small plane from Copenhagen to Aarhus, Denmark, and landed in a cold and pelting storm.
The wind drove more powerfully than any wind I had ever known before; it struck with a mythic moan, like that of the wind in the nursery rhyme: ''The North Wind will blooowww, and soon we'll have snooowww.


Korea Politician Vows To Avoid a Party Split
LEAD: A leading South Korean opposition figure said today that he would not ''betray the wishes'' of the people to avoid an opposition split in December's presidential elections and promised he and his major opposition rival would agree on a single candidacy.

NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Washington, D.C.; Easing Strains At Conventions
LEAD: THE Washington Convention Center attracts nearly 300,000 people a year, taxing the eight hotels in the area to the limit.
But three new hotels within a block of the center will soon ease the strain.


Can the Contras Go On?
LEAD: THE AIRDROP CAME suddenly.
Bright parachutes popped open a few hundred feet above the cluster of bare thatched huts and green tents that served as the contras' border command post.
Within moments, the wooden ammo crates thudded to the ground.
Having dispensed another load of American bullets to the Nicaraguan contras, the rebel supply plane ducked over the jungle tree line and headed back to its C.I.A.


Safety Accusations Surround a Radium Plant
LEAD: For decades, a New York-based company - believed to be the last commercial radium supplier in the western hemisphere - has been mishandling, and even losing, bits of the deadly radioactive element in the city, a two-year inquiry by a State Assembly committee has found.


WOULD YOU WATCH STRIKE TEAMS PLAY?
LEAD: Yes.
The strike creates a fascinating set of ''laboratory conditions'' under which the true worth of the coaches and their systems can be evaluated.
Now they are denuded of their star players, and the advantage of a more experienced defensive or offensive line.


Paris When It Shimmers
LEAD: HOW WONDERFUL TO SEE RAINY STREETS once more, wrote the Goncourt brothers in their joint diary after a stay in intolerably sunny Rome.
The Paris winter sky reflects wet sidewalks, or seems to, gray on gray.
A photograph by Alfred Stieglitz, ''A Snapshot, Paris,'' 1913, has it, exactly.
There is a print of the photograph in the Musee d'Orsay.


Tap-Dancer Among the Literati
LEAD: THE BOB FOSSE I KNEW WAS insecure, self-doubting, tormented, tense in his victories, angry in his defeats - everything I trust in an artist.


'Maurice' Brings A Small Book Into Sharp Relief By Focusing on Images of an Era


The Dutch Repolish A Small, Precious Gem of a Museum
LEAD: THE RECENT REOPENING OF the Mauritshuis in The Hague after a five-year closure is an event of international importance.
It was heightened by the arrival of the new acquisitions (18 from the present year alone), each one of which is conspicuous for the cockade of red, white and blue ribbon that it temporarily bears.


INSPECTING CHIMNEYS AND FIREPLACES
LEAD: SPRING is the best time to inspect chimneys and fireplaces.
The heating season is over, acids formed by combustion residues have not yet had a chance to corrode chimney parts seriously and plenty of time is available for repairs before cold weather sets in again.


A Cutback Looms in Health Insurance
LEAD: SOME dual-career couples, accustomed to having virtually all their medical bills paid through his-and-hers health insurance policies from their separate employers, may soon be in for a rude shock.

LEAD: SOME students at Iona College here will begin a ''Week on the Wagon'' tomorrow in an effort to focus attention on alcohol abuse, amid growing community concern about activities in the nearby North Avenue bar area.


ORIGINAL INTENT
LEAD: William Safire is in good company, but I'm not sure he's right (On Language, ''Hermen Eutic's Original Intent,'' Sept. 6).
Many writers have claimed a connection between Hermes and hermeneutics, but the evidence is in short supply.
Onions's etymological dictionary sees no connection, tracing hermeneutics back to the Greek hermeneuein, or interpret, and saving Hermes for the origin of hermetic (by way of Hermes Trismegistus, the author of occult science).


Dukakis Aides Quit; The Truth Hurts Two Campaigns
LEAD: POLITICAL professionals were of several minds last week about how much damage was caused the Presidential candidacy of Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis by the disclosure that it was two of his top aides who supplied a videotape that contributed to the downfall of a rival.

Translated by Patrick Creagh. 300 pp.
New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $19.95.


VINEYARD'S LINEAGE TRACED TO 19TH CENTURY
LEAD: It is not quite accurate to describe the Hargrave vineyard in Cutchogue  [ ''Grapes and Starling Wars,'' Aug. 30 ]  as a Long Island first.
In the 19th century and perhaps before then, the adaptability of Long Island soil to grapery was already well recognized.
Grape arbors were common features of gentlemen's country seats, as in the case of F.S.


Correction
LEAD: An article on Sept. 20 about greeting cards incorrectly described the relationship between the American Greetings Corporation and Rousana Cards.
American Greetings bought certain distribution rights and inventories from Rousana, which remains an independent company.


PRE-COLUMBIAN SCULPTURES
LEAD: THE Lehman College Art Gallery's present attraction is a group of small sculptures, pottery and textiles.
Most are pre-Columbian, the rest are African or Melanesian and all were drawn from the college's Testut-Obstfield Collection.
On view through Oct. 24, it is a show with no title and precious little documentation and, confined to the smaller of the gallery's two spaces, it could easily be overlooked.

Plea to Business: Don't Dump, Donate
LEAD: WASTE does not help a company's profit margins - or its image.
But in the food industry, where much of the product is fragile and short-lived, waste is an accepted part of doing business.
Or at least it was.


PRODUCER OF MODEL T PLAYERS
LEAD: Sometimes, by the time Vinnie O'Connor travels from his job as supervisor of health and physical education for Public School District 19 in Brooklyn to his job as head football coach at St.

MY GRANDFATHER, LEONID ANDREYEV: HEARD AGAIN, LOUD AND CLEAR
LEAD: AS a child I lived with my parents in a small modern apartment in a remote suburb of Paris.
My father's study, with its single window overlooking well-tended vegetable gardens, was a sunny, quiet room, walled with books and journals.
The thin, light-colored ones were collections of contemporary poetry in French and Russian.


Cody
LEAD: To the Editor: I read with interest Jim Robbins's article on Cody, Wyo. (Travel, July 26) and certainly share his enthusiasm.
When traveling the West, I always try to arrange accommodations at original hotels in the area.
In the case of Cody, Buffalo Bill constructed the Irma Hotel, named for his daughter.


INTRODUCING VIDEO TO ACTING COURSES
LEAD: ''MTV is here to stay,''


Music: In Philadelphia, A Festival of Americana
LEAD: Perhaps uncharacteristically, given its love of tradition, Philadelphia is full of avant-garde music at the moment.

Carol Cheswick Engaged to Wed Richard T. Ross

America's Debt to Japanese-Americans
LEAD: Through two world wars in which the United States and Germany were adversaries, anti-German feelings ran clear through society.

Verbatim: The Deer Problem
LEAD: ' People say isn't it wonderful, having deer in their backyards.
But after a while, after the deer start browsing, they start looking at them like rats.
Their attitude really changes. '  Nathaniel R. Dickinson, a wildlife official with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, on the increasing deer population in the New York metropolitan region.


AIDS BRINGS EXPANDED DEBATE ON RIGHTS OF THE TERMINALLY ILL
LEAD: IT seemed the stuff of a nightmare from fiction: a fatal disease ravaging the man's body from within, his decision to forgo heroic, life-prolonging steps and the doctors' decision to ignore those wishes and perform their medical magic on the comatose body.


Allen Replaces Moir
LEAD: A DAY after Charles Moir agreed to step down as Virginia Tech's basketball coach in the wake of the school's discovery of National Collegiate Athletic Association violations in his program, his assistant and former player, Frankie Allen, was named interim coach.
Moir, who compiled a 213-119 record over 11 seasons, resigned on Friday after signing an agreement that The Roanoke Times &amp; World

Whistle-Blower In a Lonely Fight

He simply refused to drive the rig after the accident and reported its condition to state authorities.


Music
LEAD: The centerpiece of the operatic week is Friday night's opening of ''Das Rheingold'' at the Met.
This is the least outwardly exciting of the four operas that make up Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle, and it hardly ever sells out, so there is a good chance for late deciders to hear it, either this time or at one of the repetitions.


The Coverage On Rental Cars
LEAD: On March 6, Michael Weiner, a 21-year-old Columbia engineering student, went to Florida for a vacation and rented a car there.
His father, Frank J. Weiner, a lawyer in Boston, had selected Value Rent-A-Car for Michael because it was then offering a rate of $129 a week, with payment for the collision damage waiver included.

LIVING WITH MS
LEAD: At a time when nurses are valiantly struggling to gain the professional recognition they have long deserved, we encounter the viewpoint of Rand Araskog, chairman and chief executive officer of I.T.T., who states ''the nurses were young, attractive and friendly.''

An Industry Built on Dubious Results
LEAD: THE Food and Drug Administration has been boasting that medical test kits for home use are 95 to 99 percent effective before they can be approved for sale.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  LOOKING FORWARD.
By George Bush with Victor Gold. (Doubleday, $18.95.) Vice President George Bush establishes the ground rules for his autobiography at the start, warning that it is not an ''inside story'' of his role in the Reagan Administration.
That caution is evident throughout, so much so that the book could easily be titled, like President Reagan's autobiography, ''Where's the Rest of Me?


The East Village of Paris
LEAD: As rents rise and gentrification comes to the once-rundown neighborhoods of Les Halles and the Marais, Paris is moving east.

New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $18.95.


NEW YORKERS, ETC.
LEAD: NEVER. Maybe. Sometimes. Why?


WOULD YOU WATCH STRIKE TEAMS PLAY?
LEAD: Absolutely not.
The idea is repulsive, revolting.
If we fans boycott the games, we really sock it to the owners.
Oh, how they deserve such sabotage.
Not that the players are any better.
Like most professional athletes, they earn far too much to complain about anything whatsoever.


For Now, Quiet on Iran-Contra Front
LEAD: EVERY once in a while, President Reagan's aides suggest that, on a particular controversy, it would be best if he just kept quiet.
That was the view for months in the heat of the Iran-contra affair.
Once, the President even pleaded laryngitis to avoid answering reporters' questions.


Bookshelf
LEAD: Additional titles of interest:


Sibelius Isn't the Only Scandinavian Composer
LEAD: SCANDINAVIAN SYMPHONIES, excepting those of Sibelius, have not become staple items on orchestral programs outside that geographical area, although some have long been available on recordings.
Setting aside value judgments on the works themselves, there are two likely reasons for this neglect: the relatively primitive nature of Scandinavian musical life in the early part of the 19th century, and the (continuing) peripheral location of the


INSIDE
LEAD: New Brand of Football  Pro football, of a sort, starts up again today as the N.F.L. tries to do what it has never done: continue play despite a players' strike.
Some non-striking regulars will join replacement players; striking players are expected to man picket lines at the stadiums.
Section 5.


THE GOD WHO HAS EVERYTHING
LEAD: ''EVERYTHING,'' AN operagoer who had just made first contact with Wagner's Wotan was overheard saying, ''is in there.'' The spontaneous exclamation resonates well with both the generalities and the particulars of the role, one of opera's richest and most difficult.
Wotan - the Norse god Odin, All-father, War-father - wants to shape the world and everything in it as Wagner wanted to remake not just music but all of art.


Angolan Rebels Display Wreckage of Soviet Aircraft
LEAD: An Angolan rebel standing amid the ruins of a Soviet-made helicopter that they said they shot down.


Farrell Pounds Holy Cross, 30-6
LEAD: Monsignor Farrell of Staten Island, last season's Catholic High Schools Football League champion, won its second game of this season in much the same way it won all the games on its schedule last year.
The Lions were led by their fine quarterback, Gary Wilkos, over Holy Cross, 30-6.


GROSHANS' 'MYSTERIOUS REALISM' AT THE JERSEY CITY MUSEUM
LEAD: IT USED to be that everyone understood what was meant by realism; however, for much of the 20th century, the term has been in doubt.
After all, the new realism that raged in Germany in the 1920's is not to be confused with the new realism that was Pop or, for that matter, with metaphysical, magical or romantic realism.


Bucharest: Between Two Worlds
LEAD: It used to be called the Paris of the Balkans, and it is still possible to see why, at least in part: the broad, tree-lined avenues and the buildings designed by French Beaux-Arts architects make Bucharest one of the handsomest cities in Eastern Europe.
But the animation, the excitement and, of course, the showy upper class are long gone.


NORTHEAST JOURNAL

Q and A
LEAD:  Fee for Check on a Tenant  Question: To lease our Manhattan apartment, the condominium's by-laws require us to obtain a waiver of the Right of First Refusal from the building's board of managers.

POSTINGS: Dobbs Ferry Mansion; Lot Divided For Clusters
LEAD: When the history of suburban real estate development is written, Springhurst Park in Dobb's Ferry, N.Y., could be footnoted as having risen from one of the longest-running approvals struggles ever.
It began in 1960, when the late Edward C. Iannace, a Westchester County developer, started seeking cluster zoning for his own eight-acre lot, which supported the family mansion - a nine-bedroom, 7,000-square-foot colonial.

He was 48 years old and lived in Manhattan.


OAXACA'S NIGHT OF THE RADISHES
LEAD: When you drop out of the clouds into Oaxaca, a gentle valley between some fairly serious mountains, you have the feeling you've found a secret that lies behind closed doors, something akin to that ripple of discovery in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.'' And if it is December, you fall into the soft grace of a summer not punishingly hot, but light-struck and temperate.


STREETSCAPES: The Central Park Tennis House; A Neo-Classical Structure in an Unstructured Setting

WE KICKED THE TIRES, AND A WHOLE LOT MORE
LEAD: THE ads for end-of-the-year automobile sales appeared simultaneously with our nine-year-old chariot playing dead in the garage.
High-tech resuscitation I knew, would be painful and cost-ineffective.
I muttered about pouring money into a bottomless pit.
My husband resorted to selective deafness, until, suddenly a week later, he jumped up from his desk chair and appropos of nothing, asked, ''Well, are we buying a new car or what?


Oklahoma O.K.
LEAD: THE University of Oklahoma athletic director, Donnie Duncan, said that the N.C.A.A. had conducted a preliminary investigation of the Sooner football program last month, but he said that the preliminary inquiry had not prompted a follow-up investigation, the usual procedure when apparent infractions are uncovered.


Hold the Borscht, Here Comes Mort Sahl
LEAD: MORT SAHL, A SATIRIST rooted in the comedy clubs of the urban hip, has worked the Borscht Belt only once - and that time was a disaster.
There was a police convention in the house, and just as he got rolling on his Richard Nixon jokes, the officers stood up and started singing ''God Bless America.


STATE PLANS AND LOCAL PERSPECTIVES
LEAD: WHEN government operates on the level of rhetoric, it is often surprisingly easy to achieve consensus.
When, however, it must move from rhetoric to specific policy recommendations, that consensus can evaporate quickly.
Often, the discrete meaning of rhetorical principles depends upon one's perspective.

Beyond the Boom: Where Do We Go From Here?
LEAD: A REPORT by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey last week reaffirmed that the 10-year expansion of the metropolitan area's economy has continued this year, fueled by a sustained boom in construction and resulting in the lowest unemployment rate in nearly two decades.
But the analysis, like several other recent assessments, also asked if the expansion is becoming more than the area will be able to handle.

By Jill Eisenstadt. (Knopf, $15.95.) The misadventures of a group of going-nowhere teen-agers in Jill Eisenstadt's first novel, ''From Rockaway,'' would seem to confirm every parent's worst nightmares about what his or her children do when left to their own devices.
The book's central characters are a handful of college-age (though not necessarily college-bound) kids, for whom the tedium of their small, dreary world is relieved only by self-destructive rebellion and atavistic ritual.

Carvalho will teach advanced students and serve as conductor of the Philharmonia, succeeding Otto-Werner Mueller.


A LITERARY TRIUMPH: SCARSDALE'S BOOK FAIR
LEAD: IN the life of a book, a book fair is perhaps the final chapter.
Removed, perhaps still unread, from the dusty shelf on which it has spent most of its existence, the book joins many of its kind on a table where, under usually chaotic conditions, it is inspected and most likely sold at a fraction of its original retail value.


DEBATE INTENSIFIES ON WAYS TO CURB GROWING DEER POPULATION
LEAD: THE state's deer population, which is on the rise, is providing thrilling sights for nature lovers.
It is also causing annoyance to gardeners, economic problems for farmers and severe danger to motorists, particularly Fairfield County motorists.


INSPECTING CHIMNEYS AND FIREPLACES

Henry Ford 2d
LEAD: The death of Henry Ford 2d at the age of 70 is not expected to affect the management of the big auto maker, but it will leave a void in the corporate culture.
A man who believed the boss should be the boss, Mr.
Ford nevertheless was not one to dismiss counsel lightly; indeed, when he seized control of the company in 1945, he listened carefully to those who knew more about running it than he did, until he had a firm grasp of its operations.


NEW JERSEY GUIDE
LEAD:  DENVILLE FESTIVAL  The Morris County community of Denville annually attracts more than 50,000 visitors to its Harvest Festival, which this year will be held Saturday.

Art
LEAD: ''History painting'' as a mode of contemporary art is the pretentious premise for a show of big figurative canvases at New York University's Grey Art Gallery (through Oct. 24).
The term refers to the highest genre of art from the Renaissance to the mid-19th century - the rendering of elevated themes from classical or Biblical sources that served as vehicles for moral commentary.

A SEASON OF GOLDEN CALM IN ANCIENT JERUSALEM
LEAD: Autumn in Jerusalem is a season of deep and generous pause in the ritual and agricultural life of this holy city.
Now the sun, the color of old burnished gold, hangs steady in the sky before beginning its slide into winter's silver depths.
Soon the sapphire-blue skies of the waning dry season, as if in response to autumnal prayers rising from synagogues the world over, will give way to mists, heralds of winter rains to soak the new-laid seeds and bring on the crops of spring.

STILL HERE AT THE NEW YORKER
LEAD: IT is a common enough occurrence for news as it grows old to turn into history but in my experience it is rare for history as it grows old to turn into news.
Rare or not, something of the kind appears to have happened with respect to ''Here at The New Yorker,'' which, having been published back in 1975, may be said to have passed into history, but which has lately become news on the strength of the many changes that have been taking place at the magazine over the last couple of years.


RANDOM DRUG-TESTING UNRESOLVED
LEAD: A QUESTION loomed for business and organized labor as a new state drug-testing law took effect last week - how much random testing would be allowed in the private-sector work force?


GOLDEN CITY BY THE BAY
LEAD: I HAVE VISITED SAN FRANCISCO AT least once a year for the last 20 years, yet the trigger of memory still evokes that pristine vision: an ocean liner moving out into the Pacific against the bare hills of Sausalito and, above it, rising from the fog, mystic, wonderful as the sword Excalibur, the graceful red span of the bridge.





Elena Sofonova: From Russia, With Love
LEAD: ELENA SOFONOVA DOES IT ALL with her eyes.
She suffers with them, smiles with them, searches with them - now for love, now simply for self-respect.
Soft and deep-set above the high Slavic cheekbones, they seem by far the strongest of her tools as an actress.
For her last two films, first the 1985 Soviet film ''Winter Cherries'' and now the widely admired Italian-Soviet offering, ''Dark Eyes,'' they have given her a way to evoke eloquently and almost silently the emotions of a charming and charmable woman who wants something more out of life than charm.


Treasury's Blunder in Paradise

The Government wants to collect more taxes, individuals and companies want to pay less, and tax advisers get into the act to craft ways of keeping tax bills down.

William Reid Pitts of Charlotte, N.C., were married yesterday at the First Presbyterian Church in Wilson.
The Rev.
George Johnson officiated.


Brazilians Skeptical of New Development Plan
LEAD: Sounding more like a candidate campaigning for office than the head of a government already 30 months old, President Jose Sarney has unveiled an ambitious long-term development program that, if carried out, would transform Brazil's badly bruised social profile.


MISS QUILLEN WED TO T. M. LOHRENZ
LEAD: At Trinity Episcopal Church in Wilmington, Del., Carol Everhart Quillen, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Union Says It Isn't Quitting
LEAD: The National Football League players' strike will not end without a contract, a union official said yesterday.


SWITCHING OVER TO STEEL SHOT
LEAD: WATERFOWLING seasons are approaching, and although you may plan to hunt where lead shot is still allowed, you should start using the nontoxic steel shot that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service will require for duck and goose hunting nationwide by 1991.


U.C.L.A. TROUNCES STANFORD
LEAD: Gaston Green sprinted 91 yards for a touchdown and set up another on a 54-yard pass play as U.C.L.A. trounced Stanford, 49-0, in a Pacific-10 Conference game today.


Below the Skirts
LEAD: ACCEPTANCE of short skirts has been abetted to a large extent by the fact that in the beginning - last spring - they were almost always presented with opaque panty hose, usually black.
Many women switched in summer to sheerer stockings.
These continue to be important with short evening dresses, but another category of panty hose is coming to the fore as cool weather approaches: a heavier style that can provide some warmth.


ROME
LEAD: AN ENCHANTED EVENING IN ROME DEPENDS on convivial company and good food and drink.
As in France, eating out here tends to be a religious ritual, but generally it's low church rather than high, and occasionally closer to a fundamentalist revival than to a solemn benediction.
There is no hush of holy sacrament, no delicate gourmet sipping and pecking.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  HOME GROUND, by Lynn Freed. (Penguin, $7.95.) By casting Ruth Frank, the narrator of this novel of South Africa, as a member of a family of theater people, the author provides ''a potent metaphor'' for the stage-managed world of apartheid, Janette Turner Hospital said here last year. ''What is extraordinary about this book is its perspective.


SHARP RISE FOUND IN SYPHILIS IN U.S.
LEAD: Federal and state officials report a dramatic increase in syphilis that is concentrated among minority heterosexual men and women in a few urban areas.


WOULD YOU WATCH STRIKE TEAMS PLAY?
LEAD: No Way! Baker Field and Columbia Lions, here I come  Bob McLouchlin  New York


Bacteria Resistant to Drugs Spreading Illness, U.S. Says
LEAD: The National Centers for Disease Control say that a drug-resistant strain of shigellosis that was first reported to have afflicted thousands of people at a July gathering in North Carolina has now apparently spread to four other settings.


PROPOSAL TO RESTRICT NUDITY IS ASSAILED
LEAD: I oppose Kenneth Herman's recent suggestion that the clothing-optional area be restricted  [ ''Nudity Ban Sought at Fire I. Light,'' Aug. 23 ] .

A Mark of Greatness
LEAD:  To the Editor:


Vietnamese Rejoins Her U.S. Mother
LEAD: For eight years, Mai Barlow kept the existence of a daughter in Vietnam a secret from her husband.
When she told him, it began a six-year quest that ended with a chance encounter with the right Vietnamese official at the right time.


Headliners; Self-Defense
LEAD: Perhaps at one time Karen Straw had thought about saving her marriage.
But in her last confrontation with her husband, she was mainly concerned about saving her life.
Ms.
Straw would testify later that her husband, Clifton, had beaten her frequently, beginning five months after their wedding in 1981.


Frozen In Time
LEAD: THE MARKINGS ON THE WOODEN packing case were deceptive. ''Horlick's Malted Milk Tablets,'' they said.
And the box was long thought to contain supplies for Roald Amundsen, the Norwegian explorer who not only discovered the South Pole but also was the first to fly across the Arctic.
When the box was turned over to the organizers of an Amundsen exhibition last year by the widow of the explorer's nephew and heir, it was found to hold not supplies but something much rarer: more than 200 lantern slides of


THE SNOW ABOVE, THE SAND BELOW
LEAD: As a New Yorker transplanted to California in the mid-1970's, I have rarely missed the traditional cycle of East Coast seasons, least of all winter.
But winter is now my favorite time of year - a season when southern California's skies, mountains, beaches, even man-made landscapes, seem renewed.


TALKING: Investors; Buyouts Of Tenants In Co-ops
LEAD: AS an increasing number of New York City rental buildings were converted to co-op ownership in the 80's, it became common for investors to buy from the sponsors units that tenants did not want to purchase.
State law permits rent-controlled or rent-stabilized tenants in most conversion situations to remain as renters.

Bush Supporters Drop Challenge in Michigan
LEAD: Supporters of Vice President Bush's Presidential campaign have abandoned a plan to challenge a conservative coalition that controls the state Republican Party.


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
LEAD:  CONSTITUTIONAL PARADE  The village of Mamaroneck celebrates the bicentennial of the Constitution at 1:30 P.M. today with a parade.
According to the organizers, it replicates an impromptu parade on Sept. 17, 1787, when the citizens of Philadephia turned out in droves and marched through the streets in support of the Constitution, which had just been signed.


When a Big House Engulfs a Small Opera
LEAD: TO PARAPHRASE GEORGE BER-nard Shaw, I have been to the Metropolitan Opera three times in a week and I still live.
To open the 1987-88 season, the company offered ''Otello'' as an hors d'oeuvre for Verdi lovers, then lured us to Massenet's ''Manon'' and Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' Only the ''Ariadne,'' though vocally uneven and often downright frustrating, stays brightly in mind, which might seem odd.


U.S. Refines Its Eligibility Rules for the Indian Health Service
LEAD: New rules setting more precise eligibility requirements for people receiving medical treatment from the Indian Health Service have been announced by the Department of Health and Human Services.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  VERSATILE VIRTUOSI  To open its new season in Brookville today, the New York Virtuosi Chamber Symphony drops a well-known name in classical music: Menuhin.
Jeremy Menuhin, that is, the pianist son of the celebrated violinist father, Yehudi.
Mr.
Menuhin plays Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (''Emperor''), and the orchestra, under the baton of Kenneth Klein, performs Mozart's ''Impresario Overture'' and Haydn's Symphony No.


Koreans Parade in New York
LEAD: A float, one of 22, in the eighth annual Korean Day Parade moving down Broadway yesterday afternoon.
An estimated 5,000 spectators watched some 5,000 marchers as the parade moved from West 41st Street to 23d Street.
The reviewing stand was outside Macy's at 34th Street. (The New York Times/Dith Pran)


Springsteen Looks at Love
LEAD: BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN doesn't trust myths.
For a decade, his songs have been whittling away at the notion that the American birthright is unlimited opportunity and rising expectations.
Now, with the new ''Tunnel of Love'' (Columbia 40999 LP, cassette and CD, scheduled for release tomorrow), he's confronting another illusion: the myth of love as perfect bliss and panacea.


HOTEL FARE, THOROUGHLY ITALIAN
LEAD: EUROPEAN hotel dining rooms have long been meccas for marvelous food.
In the last few years, American hotels have begun to blossom with highly rated restaurants.
Restaurant Giorgio in the Garden City Hotel is in this new sumptuous mode.

A Tip of the Hat to Bob Fosse
LEAD: BEFORE THE DAY'S RE-hearsal of ''Dancin','' his 1978 Broadway show, Bob Fosse stopped to answer a few questions, but his mind was not on conversation; his feet wanted to work.
Then he put on a pair of white gloves and faced his dancers, all of whom were wearing identical white gloves and straw hats at a rakish Fosse tilt (over one eye, as if to ward off the glare of artificial light).


JANE BUCKLEY HAS WEDDING
LEAD: Hylda Jane Buckley, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Michael B. Buckley of Watertown, Conn., and Christopher Newell Hurd, the son of Edward A. Hurd of Chicago and Nancy Whitney Lutz of Redding, Conn., were married yesterday.
The Rev.
John Blanchfield performed the ceremony at the Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church in Waterbury, Conn.


INTERNATIONAL TONE FOR WEEK
LEAD: THREE offbeat programs with an international flavor highlight the week's concert schedule, beginning today at 3 P.M. when the fine young clarinetist (and Yonkers resident) Esther Lamneck plays a free recital at the White Plains Library that includes a piece for a Hungarian relative of the clarinet called the tarogato.


New Tamil Raids in Sri Lanka
LEAD: Tamil separatists continued a rampage against majority Sinhalese residents today in attacks that have left more than 2,500 homeless in the last three days.


Bangkok Hotels
LEAD: To the Editor: Marian Burros's ''Living in Luxury in Bangkok'' (Travel, July 19) brought to mind my experiences at the Oriental Hotel and the Sheraton Royal Orchid.


A SPICE OF BRAZIL: AMADO'S TALES
LEAD: Brazil is so large, so varied and so unfinished that books about the country, both literary and academic, tend to offer a glimpse of a region or a slice of the past rather than a global vision of the future or an all-illuminating insight into the present.
There are innumerable tomes about the Amazon, for example, but they principally mirror the country's chaotic rush to colonize and exploit its hinterlands.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  Poetry at Play
To a fan, sport is poetry in motion - and for some, poetry too is a sport.
This is Robert Francis's ''Swimmer,'' from ''This Sporting Life'' (Milkweed), an anthology of American poems about sports and games, edited by Emilie Buchwald and Ruth Roston.
Observe how he negotiates his way  With trust and the least violence, making  The stranger friend, the enemy ally.


SEARCHING FOR PASSION
LEAD: Russell Baker's comments on too little passion came too close for comfort to me, and brought a tear of recognition.
The piece spoke to me of my political life, my social life and, particularly disheartening, my romantic life, with its cool acceptance of a physical relationship without a real commitment.


Overtures to Both Sides
LEAD: THE Soviet Union is moving to repair its troubled relations with Iran and at the same time expand Soviet influence among the Arab countries.
After the 1979 revolution, Iran cut its economic ties to its superpower neighbor, shutting down a gas pipeline to the southern Soviet Union, and closing Soviet consulates.


Quotations of the Day
LEAD: ''I am deeply shocked and grieved by the loss of life and the persons injured during the recent demonstrations by the Tibetan people against Chinese rule.'' - The Dalai Lama.  [ 1:4. ]


Q AND A
LEAD:  Leningrad Trips


IN FROM THE COLD
LEAD: Couple of years ago, after Director of Central Intelligence William Casey threatened to try to jail editors and reporters who dared to print information stamped ''secret,'' I received a call from a Federal law enforcement source.


Rainfall Damages Mighty Wurlitzer of Brooklyn
LEAD: What screaming rock fans and cheering basketball fans and even the incendiary devices of George Metesky, the Mad Bomber of the 1950's, did not do in 60 years, has been accomplished by months of rainfall - the silencing of the mighty 1928 Wurlitzer theater organ at the old Brooklyn Paramount Theater.

Maps. 355 pp.

Vienna
LEAD: To the Editor: Much as I liked Paul Hofmann's article on Viennese streetcars (Travel, Aug. 23), two additional features need mentioning:


Spivakov on the Joys Of Musical Glasnost
LEAD: PERHAPS it was the aura of glasnost surrounding him, but Vladimir Spivakov, elegant in his pinstriped blue suit, looked remarkably fresh on Friday night - coming directly from 22 hours in the air and a drive into Manhattan from Kennedy Airport.
The Soviet violinist and conductor is here from Moscow with the chamber orchestra he formed eight years ago, the Moscow Virtuosi.


Theater: 'Ambition,' By Halasz
LEAD: IN considering ''Ambition,'' a new play written, directed and designed by Peter Halasz, one must make a clear distinction between technique and both script and performance.
As an experiment in the use of film as a scenic, three-dimensional background for live theater, ''Ambition'' is inventive.
However, the design elements of the production are vitiated by Mr.


FICTION
LEAD:  FIRST BORN.
By Doris Mortman. (Bantam, $17.97.) Doris Mortman, author of the best seller ''Circles,'' clearly believes that more of everything is better.
Her new novel's locales stretch from Phoenix to Paris, her descriptions of fashion and decors take up a considerable portion of the book's 674 pages, and she has created not one but four heroines, all named after the grandmother they share.

Bethesda, Md.: Adler &amp; Adler. $18.95.


Troubling Signs Over Antarctica
LEAD: EVERY year when sunlight returns to the Antarctic, scientists can chart a thinning patch in the earth's ozone sunscreen.
Every year the measurements are more precise and more ominous, and this year they were worse than ever.


THE DAY NEW YORK BECAME HARMLESS
LEAD: ON Columbus Avenue near 61st Street, a young man sits beside a bridge table stacked with copies of what a poster describes as ''an original novel.'' The slender volumes, which he has apparently published himself, are attractively priced at $2.
The young man is handsome, not visibly eccentric.
He regards me with an open, frank expression - an unusual attitude for a novelist.


Headliners; JUMPING THE FENCE
LEAD: What with the exigencies of fund-raising and budget management, the calling of museum director these days can be rather akin to, well, being in trade.
Which is not to say that Sir Roy Strong has not thoroughly enjoyed his years as director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, but that he appears happy to be leaving that post behind him.


Controlling the Risk in Mutual Funds
LEAD: FOR investors eager to get in on the bull market but skeptical of their ability to pick good stocks, most brokers, advisers and financial columnists in recent years have advised buying a mutual fund, particularly one with a superior, long-term track record.
Often the broker or adviser has just such a fund at hand, which may be managed in-house or carry a generous sales commission.


Next Week; How Should The World Series Use The D.H.?
LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.
Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


Sunday Observer; The Glasnost Drapes
LEAD: THE K.G.B. IS WOR-ried about its image.


INSPECTING CHIMNEYS AND FIREPLACES
LEAD: SPRING is the best time to inspect chimneys and fireplaces.
The heating season is over, acids formed by combustion residues have not yet had a chance to corrode chimney parts seriously and plenty of time is available for repairs before cold weather sets in again.


REVALUATION FORCES A SCRABMLE FOR ASSESSORS
LEAD: BY law, Connecticut towns must reassess the properties on their tax rolls every 10 years to make sure each owner of a house or business is paying his fair share of taxes.

A New Baker Plan For World Aid
LEAD: The World Bank and I.M.F. meetings ended on a note of hope after the Reagan Administration took what seemed to be a more active role in helping spur the world economy and solving the third-world debt problem.
The spotlight was shared by President Reagan and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d.
Mr.

POSTINGS: 20 Shops With Offices Above; A Retail 'Mews' for Greenpoint
LEAD: If the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission grants a development team approval, a three-building complex in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn will become a retail ''mews,'' with about 20 shops on the first two levels and office space above.
Situated in a historic district, the buildings, at 126-132 Greenpoint Avenue off Manhattan


The Chamorros: Nicaragua's Remarkable Press Family
LEAD: WITH the reopening of the opposition newspaper La Prensa last week, Nicaragua regained one of its most celebrated institutions, and the remarkable Chamorro family once again stepped to the forefront of national life.
Both the newspaper and the family have become icons of Nicaraguan history, and both are certain to play important roles as the country advances tentatively toward liberalization under provisions of the new Central American peace accord, to go into effect Nov.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD: A Different PTL THE Bible breaks will continue at the PTL Equipment Company in Huntington Station.
Executives of the elevator-fixtures manufacturing company have no plans to change their operations or their name because of the PTL scandal or Jessica Hahn's recent Playboy magazine article.


Life in a Metal Box In Alaskan Tundra
LEAD: OLD shipping containers - 8-by-24-foot metal boxes - were being rented as apartments for $200 a month in Bethel, Alaska, with no shortage of tenants.


Bangkok Hotels
LEAD: To the Editor: As old Bangkok hands who have lived in that city and visited there many times, we read with keen interest your article on Bangkok.
We have known the old Oriental Hotel for 30 years and have been unhappy to see it grow from a charming old hostelry to the touristy behemoth it is today.


'DAY IN HOLLYWOO' IN FAIRFIELD
LEAD: THE Boston Post Road Stage Company has crossed over into musical comedy with the greatest of ease.


Ex-Patient Eases Path From Streets to Health
LEAD: At least three dozen men are slumped or sleeping in molded plastic chairs in the center for the homeless.
It is 8 P.M., and they are waiting to be assigned beds for the night.
Several say they have been waiting all day.


Big Spending for a Spent Fuel Bribe
LEAD: Washington has reached rock bottom in its five-year search for an underground site to store spent fuel from nuclear reactors.
The latest scheme, devised by Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, would make Nevada the unlucky host, recompensed with a $5 billion bribe.
Congress's other ideas being even worse, this one deserves attention.


Caring For the Condor
LEAD: ''THEY'RE ALLOPREENING,'' says Donald J. Sterner, hopefully, of the two California condors shown above.
The endangered birds are circumspect breeders, a problem for Sterner, whose job it is, as lead condor keeper at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, to assist the perpetuation of the species.
Allopreening, a ritual that frequently precedes the male's formal courtship of the female, consists of ''bits of behavior that bring them closer, nibbling each others' feathers, head and neck rubbing,'' Sterner says.


Even Offstage, These Performers Are Onstage
LEAD: MARTHA GRAHAM HAS often told us that ''theater is not a noun, it is a verb.'' The term ''theater'' derives from the Greek, signifying a place where things are to be seen.
The connotations of activity and of display in these definitions are especially applicable to dance as a theatrical art.
Nobody feels constrained to use the word ''proscenium'' to define the essence of theater.


FOCUS: Housing Aid; Replacing Lost U.S. Funding
LEAD: THE Kentucky Housing Corporation, a state agency, is using surplus cash to provide home loans to families with incomes of less than $21,000 a year.


A Master at Touching Up the Masters
LEAD: IN JOHN BREALEY'S LABORATORIES, a spacious complex at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where dulled and damaged paintings are brought back to vivid pictorial health, a few dozen pictures on easels are surrounded by rooms crowded with such tools of the restorer's trade as computers, microscopes, centrifuges, spectrophotometers, racks of test tubes and rows of black rubber hoses springing from stoppered bottles.


LIFE DOESN'T END AT THE CITY LIMITS
LEAD: THE general managers of New York City's major television stations should be encouraged to vacation on the East End.
They could say goodbye for a while to Nielsens, cable and strikes.
They could see the beauty of Long Island's farmland, luminous skies and sunsets by the sea.
And they could see some impressive regional television on newscasts emanating from across Long Island Sound and clearly received by viewers out


Alpaca Sweaters Woven in La Paz
LEAD: In a courtyard near El Prado, the main thoroughfare of La Paz, Bolivia, Isabel Mamani kneels on the floor as she grinds cochineal on a stone mortar, the kind of mortar used in most Bolivian homes to grind hot pepper, garlic and spices.
Cochineal, an insect that feeds on cactus, is also the name of a dye produced from female cochineal; a spectrum of reds, from scarlet to rust, is the result, and the colors are used to dye a line of scarves, sweaters and shawls produced by Artesanias Millma.


Lost Cities of Britain: The Quest for Camelot
LEAD: THERE ARE IN BRITAIN VANISHED cities, lost villages, disappeared kingdoms even, some with their names still on the map.
Trying to reach them isn't quite as hopeless as trying to reach the rainbow's end, but the point at which their legend and their geography meet is sure to be buried in a thicket of poetry.


UNBEATEN HOLY CROSS ROLLS
LEAD: Undefeated Holy Cross showed its strength today in a 49-7 rout of Colgate, the team regarded as the foremost rival on its schedule.
This was the fourth victory for the Crusaders; it was the second defeat in five games for Colgate, a Colonial League rival.


The Truth Is Also on Trial In a Texas Death Row Case
LEAD: A death row case that has been dominated by emotional issues of race is now centering on vexing questions of who is telling the truth and who is not.

LEAD: The long winter season on Cape Cod is a period more often than not of terrible weather.

New Year Postponed
LEAD: The United States Naval Observatory says 1987 will run long, with one extra second being added to the end of the year.

Woody Herman Gravely Ill
LEAD: Woody Herman was in critical condition today at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said.

Mr.
Herman was hospitalized Thursday because of congestive heart failure, emphysema and pneumonia, said his attorney, Kirk Pasich.


Street Fashion; Some Spots, for a Change
LEAD: LEOPARD spots are certainly leaving their mark on New York.
The distinctive buff and black rosette patterns, which occur naturally on leopards, are now being reproduced artificially on all sorts of things.
They're woven into wool and chiffon, stenciled onto leather and calfskin, and even dyed on the top of closely shorn heads (that hairdo should be interesting as it grows out).


LONDON
LEAD: TWENTY YEARS AGO, THE BEST LONDON RES-taurants - and there weren't many of them - specialized in a kind of Edwardian-French cuisine: strong tastes, lavish portions and an emphasis on creatures that can be shot - in other words, classic cooking for the hungry squirearchy.
Then nouvelle cuisine arrived to decimate the portions, overrefine the flavors and generally ruin our fun in the name of preserving our waistlines.


USE, BUT NEVER ABUSE
LEAD: HEMLINES are rising, ties widening, lapels thickening.
We live, it seems, in a world of fashion, and photography is not immune to its influence.
Fashion is especially a factor when it comes to how we tote our cameras around.


N.F.L. STANDBYS TAKE OFF
LEAD: AFTER 12 days of negotiations, demonstrations, accusations, union meetings, owner meetings, sponsor pullouts, picket lines, egg-throwing, name-calling, team-restocking and growing public dissatisfaction with the football industry in general, the National Football League returns to action today.
Sort of.

Call for a Boycott
LEAD: IF college athletic directors don't start hiring more black head coaches, the National Football League strike may not be the last unified action by athletes this year - not if Harry Edwards has his way.
Edwards, the Berkeley sociologist who advises the commissioner of baseball on racial matters, said that if blacks were not given more college coaching opportunities, he would urge black scholarship players to boycott this season's football bowl games and basketball playoffs.


New Jersey Drivers Fret Over the Cost Of Their Insurance
LEAD: NEW Jerseyans have known for some time that they pay the highest auto insurance premiums in the country.

Free Tickets

Question Of the Week; How Should The Series Use the D.H.?

LEAD: In order to keep peace and satisfy the traditionalists, why not allow the teams participating in the Series to use their own judgment?

Clothing and Crafts in Cairo
LEAD: Cairo's exotic Khan el Khalili bazaar is an obligatory stop for visitors, but not necessarily the best place to spend money.

Tailoring a Suit To Your Taste In Irish Tweed
LEAD: A visitor to the House of Donegal in the city of Cork may feel a bit as if he is on Savile Row.

Opera: New 'Rheingold' At the Metropolitan
LEAD: IN this era of daringly trendy reinterpretations of the ''Ring,'' there ought to be room for a brilliantly untrendy one.

Tigers Got More Than Their Money's Worth From Evans
LEAD: LAST winter the Detroit Tigers ignored the 29 home runs and 85 runs batted in Darrell Evans produced, looked at his salary instead and decided they were in no hurry to tender him a contract for this year.

Another Uptick In Interest Rates
LEAD: Up, up and away went the prime rate, as banks raised the key barometer to 9 percent, from 8 3/4.
The increase was the fifth so far this year, and, although it was expected, it still sent a chill down the spines of the people who had been thinking about borrowing money.
Short-term interest rates have been on the rise - indeed, yields in the bond market have been at or near two-year highs - and the prime has followed suit.


A LA CARTE
LEAD: SOME of the best food on Long Island is found not in restaurants or even your grandmother's kitchen, but at a private club.

Ban Chemical Weapons. But How?

First it rained.
Then it snowed.
Then it snowed some more.


SHOW PUTS 'SESAME' STAR AND CHILDREN ON STAGE
LEAD: IT had been an ordinary Friday at Once Upon a Time, the children's bookstore in New Rochelle.
Shoppers with and without toddlers in tow had come to browse or ask advice about books for their children.
The store's four owners were on hand: Betsy Bober Polivy, a former magazine editor; Ms.
Polivy's mother, Natalie Bober, herself an author of books for children and young adults; Jane Gelbard, Ms.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: A 29-year-old jockey, Joy Scott, has become the first woman to boot home a winner in the 19-year-history of the Oak Tree Racing Association meet at Santa Anita Park.

LEAD: THE buying and selling of commercial buildings in Manhattan has fallen to its lowest level of the decade, according to real-estate experts.
They say that high taxes and even higher hopes have prompted owners to cling to their Manhattan holdings.


TAKING RISKS
LEAD: I'm all for taking chances; I'm all for risks.
But isn't the purpose of a risk to reach a goal, or is the purpose of a risk risk itself?
I can understand perfectly Simmons's exhilaration in action, his sense of testing, but doesn't testing imply a conclusion to be reached, a new understanding, something of value gained?


FALL SOUPS USE VEGETABLES AND HERBS
LEAD: SOUPS for early fall that take advantage of the continuing harvest of vegetables and herbs should also be hearty and well-flavored.
The three suggested here comply with these requirements.


GORBACHEV'S GROUNDWORK FOR SUMMIT No. 3
LEAD: AS a chilly rain lashed Reykjavik exactly a year ago, the second summit between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan ended in failure.
It has taken 12 months to reassemble the pieces that nearly fell into place that weekend.
This time around, with more careful preparation, both sides appear to have a more realistic idea of what they want and how to get it.


Cuba Has Plan to Raid U.S. Base in Case of Attack, Defecting General Says
LEAD: A Cuban Air Force general who defected to the United States five months ago says Cuban combat pilots regularly practice for retaliatory strikes against an Air Force base in Florida.


Stamford Becomes State's Venture Capital Capital
LEAD: WITH fewer than 105,000 residents, the city of Stamford, in southwestern Connecticut ranks fifth in terms of the state's population.
But when it comes to cash, it ranks first.
Of $1.3 billion in venture capital available in Connecticut, for instance, $1 billion of it is in Stamford, which ranks fourth in the nation in terms of venture funds.

FALL SOUPS USE VEGETABLES AND HERBS

The three suggested here comply with these requirements.


CELEBRATING THE CONSTITUTION
LEAD: I hope Yale Kamisar's faulty comparison of AIDS testing with illicit drug testing, dragnet searches at airports and regulatory searches for health and safety violations will be cautiously avoided by those with judicial power (''Drugs, AIDS and the Threat to Privacy'').
A person harboring the AIDS virus has not committed a criminal act by virtue of being infected, and, furthermore, poses no risk to other individuals who themselves refrain from unsafe behavior.


The Price of Ideology
LEAD: It is a new experience for Americans to live under a Government driven by ideology.
We have had activist Presidents, but not ones fastened to a theory.
Franklin Roosevelt, the modern exemplar of vigor, was an utter pragmatist.
Richard Nixon went to China.
Lyndon Johnson urged us to reason together.


Hussein Postpones Election For New Jordan Parliament
LEAD: King Hussein, opening a new session of Parliament, said today that he was postponing elections to the lower house for two years.


FOR MAMET AND CROUSE, A MOVIE IS A FAMILY MATTER

NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  Punitive Paintings  At one time in Florence, paintings were a form of punishment, a practice that has continued in various guises to our time.
This is from ''The Stones of Florence'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich) by Mary McCarthy.


8 Arrested for Drugs on L.I.
LEAD: Eight people were arrested on drug-related felony charges after the Nassau County Police conducted a sweep of the Nassau Road area.
Officers from the county's Bureau of Special Operations swept through the street about 10 P.M.
Friday, recovering 43 vials of crack, a large bag of crack, $2,000 in cash and assorted drug paraphernalia, according to a police spokesman, Officer Peter Franzone.


Audiences Vs. Vexing Subjects
LEAD: SLOW, TERRIBLE DEATH, GRISLY EXPERI-ments and seemingly irrevocable pollution of the environment are hardly things about which audiences automatically want to hear.
But Carole Langer's ''Radium City'' hooked the crowd anyway, and when that happens, the film maker deserves as much praise for tact as for technique.


TAKING RISKS
LEAD: Thomas Simmons's celebration of life at the edge carries the implication that the rest of us are leading tame, backwater lives.
For a person whose mind and senses are open, a ''sense of drama'' and ''joy in action'' are everywhere: running down a country road, watching a flower unfold or watching a cat play with its tail.


ARTIST'S VIEW OF TIME
LEAD: Just in time for Erte's 95th birthday in November, a pocket watch he designed will go on sale at Gallery 121, 121 Spring Street in Soho, and in stores and art galleries around the country.


Art
LEAD: As is proved by the new exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris (Park Avenue at 42d Street), Stuart Davis (1892-1964) selected his motifs carefully and did not let them go until they had yielded every possible ounce of visual juice.
Titled ''Stuart Davis: An American in Paris,'' this exhibition (on view through Dec.

TURKISH ELECTION IS UNDER JEOPARDY
LEAD: A Turkish court has ruled that part of the country's new election procedure is unlawful, jeopardizing a general election scheduled in three weeks.


CELEBRATING THE CONSTITUTION
LEAD: William Safire's assertion that the war power ''has been wrested back and forth through two centuries, and the answer seems to lie in the inability of either branch to dominate the other'' (''Tug-of-War'') seriously misstates the true nature of the power over war.
In fact, as we celebrate our Constitution's bicentennial, the power to initiate and risk war has moved steadily and inexorably into the hands of the President alone.


At Car Rental Companies, the Owners Come and Go
LEAD: TRYING to get a fix on the $9 billion-or-so car rental industry is like carving an ice statue on a hot day.
You can do it - but it's not going to hold its shape for long.


The Extravagant Desserts of Sicily
LEAD: Sicilian desserts are the kind that children might dream up.
Thick, rich and sugary sweet concoctions made with unstinting proportions of cream, sugar, chocolate, fruit and nuts, all oozed into crispy pastry rolls, spread onto spongy layer cakes or hidden inside soft pastry pockets.
Then there are the mounds of buttery cookies, the fooled-you marzipan lookalike fruit and vegetables, the ice mountains of fruit- or coffee-flavored granitas, and ice cream that barely begins with vanilla, chocolate and strawberry.

LONG BEACH HOURS LAW PINCHES 7-ELEVEN STORE
LEAD: WHEN Tanveer Ahmad Khan first decided to buy the 7-Eleven franchise on Long Beach Road in Long Beach, he never suspected that he would be forced to close the convenience store every night at 11 P.M. and not reopen it until the next morning at 5.


Question Of the Week; How Should The Series Use the D.H.?
LEAD: The usual rules of hospitality should prevail - the host determines the rules, quite simply.
In the A.L. ball park, there will be a d.h.
In the N.L., there will not.


Penn St. Romps Over Rutgers
LEAD: Penn State ran up a 28-7 lead on Rutgers today and then relaxed.
But Scott Erney kept throwing the football for the Scarlet Knights and put a little fear into the mind of Joe Paterno, the Nittany Lions' coach.


Condom in College Newspaper
LEAD: The University of Vermont's student newspaper inserted a free condom in 5,000 of its Oct. 1 issues.
The condoms were part of a ''safe sex'' package that included two pamphlets, one on venereal diseases, another on AIDS.


ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD: Q. The walls inside my house are covered with rough-sawn knotty pine.
Because of some leaks, the wood along the bottom is stained dark in an irregular pattern that looks like a stock market graph.
The leaks are cured, but the stains remain.
How can I remove them?


Hofstra Beats Wagner in Showdown
LEAD: Hofstra took advantage of Wagner's listless defense in the first half to build a 24-0 lead today, then had to withstand Wagner's relentless offense in the second half for a 35-28 victory in a match of unbeaten teams.
The victory gave Hofstra a record of 5-0; Wagner dropped to 5-1.


JAVA GOLD UPSET IN GOLD CUP
LEAD: Creme Fraiche won the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup yesterday at Belmont Park by stealing an easy lead through staggeringly slow fractions that allowed him to post a 4 3/4-length victory over Java Gold.


The Clear Lesson of the Bork Nomination
LEAD: To the Editor:


Reversing Rural Blight in the Catskills
LEAD: FOR a century, the Beaverkill Valley in the Catskills has been a mecca for naturalists drawn by the great floral beauty covering the mountains, for sportsmen attracted by abundant turkey and deer, and especially for anglers who cast into its streams for the maddeningly elusive rainbow trout and then touted the region as a world-class fishing spot.


Philharmonic: Ohlsson Is Sanderling's Soloist
LEAD: THE latest guest conductor in the New York Philharmonic's young season is Kurt Sanderling.
Mr.
Sanderling is a German who apprenticed under Furtwangler, Klemperer and Kleiber in the 1920's but who also spent a third of his life in the Soviet Union.
His program at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday afternoon seemed a convergence of these experiences.


Far Above Par
LEAD: A MAN who spent his career building golf courses and a woman who spent hers tearing them up have been inducted into the PGA-World Golf Hall of Fame.
At ceremonies in Pinehurst, N.C., Robert Trent Jones, the 81-year-old golf course designer, was honored Friday along with Betsy Rawls, the 59-year-old former champion.


CAR MADNESS IN MANHATTAN: CURE SOUGHT
LEAD: EVERY workday 3.4 million people converge on Manhattan in movement so massive that the city's transportation commissioner, Ross Sandler, says it can only be compared to the tides.
It falls to Mr.
Sandler to smooth out the eddies and maintain the flow as best he can.
That task has grown progressively harder since the mid-70's, when the number of commuters started to climb.


Reborn Peronists Flex Their Muscles
LEAD: THE triumph of the Peronists in Argentina's congressional and provincial elections last month weighs almost as heavily on the victors as on President Raul Alfonsin and his party, the Radical Civic Union.


'DAY OF PAINTING'
LEAD: Armed with a box lunch, an easel and a taste for artistic adventure, 85 painters and watercolorists will descend on Cold Spring on Saturday to draw and color this little village on the Hudson River.


COWARD'S 'PRESENT LAUGHTER' AT DREW
LEAD: IN THE cavalcade of Sir Noel Coward's stage works - 27 in all - ''Present Laughter'' somehow is not thought to have come out of the top drawer.


LABOR SHORTAGE IS SEEN
LEAD: In discussing regional market trends, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, said: ''I don't like to hear people in Westchester talking about growth problems.
The problems of growth are easier to deal with than the problems of decline.
I know many other communities that would love to change places with Westchester.


At Yale, Aspiring Authors Flock to Fiction-Writing Courses
LEAD: Norma Klein had her first piece of fiction published at the age of 19, when she won a short-story contest.


CELEBRATING THE CONSTITUTION
LEAD: William Bradford Reynolds, in his article ''Power to the People,'' argues the Administration position that the courts shouldn't be creating rights.

CRIME
LEAD: Time was when private eyes were anything but thinking men.
Their brains resided in their fists, just as the brains of so many pianists are located in their finger tips.
Today things are different.
Most private eyes are depicted as sensitive plants, with emotional problems just like ours.
They spout philosophy.


A Computer View of What Might Be
LEAD: ONE problem for cosmetic dentists has been that patients have trouble visualizing the results of cosmetic alterations - and often back off because of uncertainty.
Dentists are hoping computer technology can ease those doubts.


Ancient Places That Anchor Yeats's Poems
LEAD: Like many unreconstructed English majors, I have a weakness for literary pilgrimages, a form of travel based on the principle that homage must be paid to genius.
So I have found myself at Ernest Hemingway's house in Key West, Mark Twain's boyhood haunts in Hannibal, Wordsworth's cottage in the Lake District and Karen Blixen's house on the outskirts of Nairobi.

Mom, Dad, the kids and Bruno the dog lounge around the simulated sun room of their life-support pod in Westchester.

Getting an Early Jump on April 15
LEAD: IT'S getting to be that time of year again - year-end tax planning time, that is - and the 1986 Tax Reform Act, with its mare's-nest of new and transitional rules, isn't making things any easier. ''The people who used to enjoy our tax-planning sessions now see me as something akin to root canal,'' said Robert A.


IRAQI JETS IN NEW ATTACKS IN GULF
LEAD: Iraqi warplanes attacked a ship in the Persian Gulf today, and Iraq said its jets hit an air base and three oil centers in Iran after a powerful explosion shook the Iraqi capital.

Jerrold D. Atlas of Warren Township, N.J., and Michael Shayon Ungar, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY SONS?
LEAD: OVERLOOKING the World War II invasion beaches of France, I stood and contemplated how differently I viewed war now that I was the mother of two boys.


Listening for the Music In the Words Onstage
LEAD: I WONDER IF ALL EFFECTIVE THEA-ter pieces, serious or otherwise, aren't in some way musical underneath.
It's easy enough, for instance, to hear - and even to see - the quiet, stabbing, funny counterpoint that helps build Alfred Uhry's ''Driving Miss Daisy'' to such a touching climax.


For Latin America, A Greening at the Top
LEAD: IN his 1975 novel ''The Autumn of the Patriarch,'' Gabriel Garcia Marquez imagined a Latin American despot so aged that he was ''older than all old men and all old animals on land or sea.'' To Latin Americans familiar with Juan Peron, Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay or Arnulfo Arias of Panama, among others, the portrayal was less a fantasy than a deft rendering of an all-too-familiar prototype.


Engineering in a Slump, But Future Is Bright
LEAD: AS CORPORATE AMERICA restructures itself to meet the needs of a changing marketplace, career opportunities for science and engineering graduates have waned considerably over the last three years.


Miss Kaelin Wed To Glen Holland

Raymond C. Holland of Riverside, Conn.
The Rev.
Russell J. Sloun performed the ceremony.


CLOSING THE DOOR ON HEAT LOSSES
LEAD: ALTHOUGH poorly sealed windows generally are touted as the greatest source of heat leaks in an insulated home, weatherstripping a main entrance door can have the same effect as sealing several windows.


Villanova 52, Cent. Conn. 20
LEAD: Kirk Schulz completed a school-record 28 of 38 passes for 359 yards for Villanova (4-0).
Central Connecticut fell to 1-4.
Villanova had a school-record 45 consecutive points in the second half.
A wide receiver, Robert Brady, caught 9 passes for 114 yards and a touchdown for the Wildcats.


Ellen Dwyer Wed To G. R. Sansone
LEAD: At the Heinz Memorial Chapel at the University of Pittsburgh yesterday evening, Ellen Lee Dwyer and Gregory R. Sansone were married by the Rev.
Stephen McCarren, a Roman Catholic priest.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  ALL'S FAIRS  As if one full-fledged, traditional fair - the Long Island Fair at the Old Bethpage Village Restoration - wasn't enough this weekend, here comes the Riverhead Country Fair today to entice suburbanites with a taste of what used to be in really rural America.
So from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., the parking lot at the Peconic River will be the scene of the customary fair activities - old-fashioned contests like spelling bees (and one new-fangled mini-marathon), rides, games, exhibits and, naturally, agricultural competitions.


Rochester U. Votes to End Its Ties to South Africa
LEAD: The University of Rochester has decided to divest itself of holdings in companies that do business in South Africa, reversing a 5-month-old policy that stirred campus and community opposition.


Question Of the Week; How Should The Series Use the D.H.?
LEAD: I suppose the simplest solution would be for the home team to select the rules of play.
That should be equitable as long as the rules remain vaguely recognizable to the visiting team.


Streetscapes: Brooklyn Museum; A Touch of Imperial Rome Gracing Eastern Parkway
LEAD: THE Brooklyn Museum has never even approached completion of its original master plan, designed in 1893 by McKim, Mead &amp; White.
But last year it held a competition for a completion on more modest lines.
The museum's decision on how to treat its 1930's lobby will indicate how far the pendulum is swinging away from orthodox modernism.


Where the Sun Rises First, Late Night TV Comes Last
LEAD: What with Bangor's many cultural attractions and nightlife opportunities, Margo Cobb was saying, the citizens find little time for late-night television.


ANALYZING THE ENDGAME
LEAD: THERE will be three United States teams taking part in the world team championships beginning today in Jamaica.
Two of them will be on the sidelines for the first nine days.


Twins' Runner Gets Ensnarled In One Play's Twists and Turns
LEAD: The play will become a footnote or a trivia question in future accounts of the 1987 American League pennant playoff, but today it might have served as the catapult that thrust the Minnesota Twins to the threshold of the World Series.


THEATER AYCKBOURN PREMIERE
LEAD: In recent years, Alan Ayckbourn has found an American theatrical home at the Alley Theater in Houston.
That regional company has produced seven of his plays, only a few of which have been seen in New York.
The Alley-Ayckbourn alliance culminated last night with the U. S. premiere of the playwright's newest work, ''Henceforward .


COLLEGES PLAN COURSES ON COMPUTERS
LEAD: LARGE companies and universities in the state met last week to look at offering college classes by dialing them up on personal computers.


POSTINGS: $200,000 Restoration; Water Mill's Windmill
LEAD: For a good part of the 19th century, the winds off the Atlantic on the eastern end of Long Island turned the wooden blades of the windmill that anchored the green in the hamlet of Water Mill.
Wheat and corn were ground there and farm families were fed for miles around.


Trailing, 17-0, Penn Rallies Over Brown
LEAD: Penn, the defending Ivy League football champion, scored 25 second-half points to rally from an early 17-0 deficit and stun Brown, 38-17, today at Franklin Field.


Votes in Congress; Last Week's Tally in Key Eastern States
LEAD:  House


The Senators, Judging Bork, Try to Define Conservatism
LEAD: AS senators have fallen into line against Robert H. Bork, there has been a subtext to their explanations of why they will not support his nomination to the Supreme Court.
Many of them, in criticizing Judge Bork, have also looked ahead to a new round and gone out of their way to emphasize that they are ready, willing and able to support a conservative.


Correction
LEAD: A front-page article in the Arts and Leisure section today about the new television season includes an outdated passage about the CBS-TV series ''Jake and the Fatman,'' derived from a videotape of the pilot episode supplied by the network for review.
In episodes that have been broadcast, the dialogue has been rewritten to use language that is not offensive; no words are bleeped out.


HOTEL ENDS ROLE IN DETENTION OF ALIENS
LEAD: A hotel at Kennedy International Airport that has served as a temporary detention center for travelers facing deportation has severed an arrangement with the Federal Government, citing negative publicity from reports of inhumane conditions by a civil rights organization.

Henri A. Stines, the bridegroom's godfather, officiated at the Episcopal Church of the Ascension in


Talks Halt as South Korean Seeks Presidency
LEAD: As Kim Young Sam sees it, he can't lose the race for president because South Koreans consider him the man who has led the struggle for democracy here.

U.S.-SOVIET TRADE OF STUDENTS STUDIED
LEAD: ''IT is certainly our hope that we can begin the kind of learning experience that will benefit both our students and the ones that come here,'' said Dr.

ALL IS FAR FROM QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT
LEAD: MORTIMER B. Zuckerman's plans to develop the western arc of Columbus Circle have been officially approved by New York City.
But many New Yorkers remain opposed to his proposal to replace the New York Coliseum with two multi-purpose towers, a project that some critics see as emblematic of a city government smitten by development fever.


VOTERS HAVE WIDE CHOICE ON JUDGES
LEAD: VOTERS in the county will fill the largest number of Supreme Court vacancies in the history of the Ninth Judicial District when they go to the polls in November.


CELEBRATING THE CONSTITUTION
LEAD: Judging from your selection of commentators and Anthony Lewis's comment that finding the Constitution's meaning is ''lawyers' work,'' I was surprised that your bicentennial issue didn't suggest that the Preamble be changed to begin ''We, the lawyers. . . .''

What's Doing in New Orleans
LEAD: New Orleans is a world-class city for idling.
The sultry south Louisiana climate almost demands it, the city's nickname ''the big easy'' attests it, and fall rivals spring as the prime season for it.


Question Of the Week; How Should The Series Use the D.H.?
LEAD: Use both the d.h. and let the pitcher hit.
By doing so, it allows the d.h. to take his spot in the lineup, keeping A.L. strategies intact, while ''old-fashioned'' N.L. baseball would still be a part of the fall classic.
Of course, fans would see less of their top- and middle-of-the-lineup favorites, but this would be offset by the inherent fairness to both teams.

hOW AN ORCHESTRA FELL SILENT: POSTLUDE
LEAD: FROM Claudio Arrau to Pinchas Zukerman, the great musical artists of the world appeared regularly with the White Plains Symphony Orchestra, which was founded in 1961 as the Music for Westchester Symphony Orchestra.

A FAILING GRADE FOR THE PRESENT TENSE
LEAD: PAULINE experienced many perils, but none to compare with the perils of the present tense.
She was tied to tracks, left to teeter on window ledges, allowed to hang from cliffs by the lace in her pantaloons.
Yet in the week while we waited for her bloomers to rip or the train to come, time held its breath as we held ours -in serial suspension; that is, we calmly ignored the pause in her plight as we went about our business, placing our modest cares in a parenthetical phrase; because, when the lace on her undies relaxed at last, when the train's hoot grew cruelly closer, or when


In Nicaragua, a Cease-Fire Decree Brings a Nervous Peace for Some

WHAT'S NEW IN COSMETIC DENTISTRY
LEAD: GOING into the 1980's, the dental industry appeared headed for some trouble - brought on, ironically, by its own impressive achievement in helping to reduce tooth decay in this country by 50 percent in two decades.

New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: If Patricia Bosworth, an author of some renown, could change one thing about herself, she has no doubt what it would be.
It's been galling her for years and the only thing she can't figure out is why she's never done anything about it.

A DESERT WASTELAND
LEAD: The Food column (''Seafood of the Desert,'' Aug. 30, by Susan Herrmann Loomis) was an unintentional parody of the trendy invasion that has turned much of the Southwest into a wasteland of tourists and yuppies.
Although real food can still be found in Santa Fe and northern New Mexico, it seems The New York Times would not care to say so.

The Job Outlook Across the Nation; MOUNTAIN
LEAD: UNEMPLOYMENT RATES have been a puzzling indicator of economic health in the Rocky Mountain West during the last year.

Meanwhile, Utah's unemployment rate inched upward to 6.6 percent in August, though John Mathews of the Utah Department of Employment Security sounds more optimistic than his counterparts.

Outdoors; Stalking the Elusive Bargain
LEAD: SKILL and experience are far more important in most outdoor pursuits than the quality -and cost - of the gear used.
However, most of us who camp, canoe, fish and hunt are to some extent enamored of equipment, and the possession, care and maintenance of a nearly perfect tool can be a deeply satisfying part of sport.


HEALTH BILL STALLS IN MASSACHUSETTS
LEAD: A proposal to make affordable health insurance available to all Massachusetts residents has met heavy resistance from state legislators, who call the proposal too expensive and unwieldy.

Hong Kong's Hottest Hot Spot
LEAD: OF all the Western-type businesses that Beijing seems to be warming to these days, perhaps the most unlikely is a gaudy nightclub here in the commercial district where cognac sells for $113 a bottle and 1,000 ''hostesses'' sell their services to a pin-striped clientele.

MAMET MAKE A DEBUT WITH 'HOUSE OF GAMES'
QUITE early in ''House of Games,'' David Mamet's entertaining, deadpan, seriocomic melodrama about con artists, there's a back-room poker game that sets the tone for everything that comes after.
Though the players could withdraw at any point, they don't, this being a serious game.
Raises are seen, and raised again.
The pot accumulates. ''Everybody stays.
Everybody pays,'' says the dealer.
Tensions mount and tempers shorten like fuses burning in slow-motion.
Somebody must be bluffing, and somebody must lose, though there's nothing in the book that says the bluffer must lose or that the best hand wins.


Question Of the Week; How Should The Series Use the D.H.?
LEAD: The d.h. ought to be eliminated not only from the World Series but also from the American League regular season as well.

LEAD: A half hour went by, but Jeff Reardon did not move.

Judge Bork's Victory
LEAD: What a gutsy, judicious thing to do.

A COMIC'S DREAMS PLAY ON BROADWAY
LEAD: NOW that he's an established entrepreneur in the world of comedy - as the president of Great Neck-based talent management and radio syndication companies - is it any wonder that Rory Rosegarten, at 25, is producing a Broadway musical that just happens to be called ''Late Nite Comic''?

BACK TO SCHOOL, SERIOUSLY

I greet the sitter at the door with a list of instructions, gather up my books, and


Frank Stella Finds Space for Cosmic Reliefs
LEAD: FROM THE TIME HE FIRST ELEC-trified the New York art world with a series of paintings consisting of black stripes on raw canvas, Frank Stella has been an artist who always seems to be working on the leading edge of contemporary art.
The black-stripe paintings of 1959 were avatars of Minimalism; the mid-70's series of painted reliefs called ''Exotic Birds'' heralded the return of decorative painting; the increasingly three-dimensional series that have followed have spoken to grafitti art and neo-Expressionism, among other trends.

Battered But Still Swinging, Reagan Enters Final Rounds
LEAD: This opening was particularly important because the President has tried vainly for almost seven years to persuade Congress to enact his views on such ''social issues'' as abortion and school prayer.

Lots of Lots, but Little for Development
LEAD: NEW YORK'S vast and seemingly inexhaustible supply of vacant city-owned land - apparent to anyone who has ventured into the weedy steppes of Brooklyn or the wasteland prairies of the Bronx - is running out.


Folk-Rock: R.E.M. And 10,000 Maniacs
LEAD: SOMETIMES the late 1980's seem to be the late 1960's turned inside out.
Consider folk-rock.
In the 1960's, it was a commercial hybrid; in the late 1980's, it has become the style of choice for iconoclasts, nonconformists and oddballs.
Foremost among them is R.E.M., a band from Athens, Ga., whose asymmetrical, often obscure songs are so tuneful and its concerts so galvanizing that the band is fast reaching the mainstream pop audience almost despite itself.


St. John's Is Upset By Pace
LEAD: Kevin Enterlein completed a school-record 26 passes in 50 attempts for 322 yards and two touchdowns to lead Pace to a 27-22 upset of St.

LEAD: Connecticut Democrats, searching for a candidate to challenge United States Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. next year, have found a likely prospect in Joseph I. Lieberman, the State Attorney General.


Music: The Sofia Chamber Orchestra
LEAD: THE good citizens of Budapest and Prague seem born with a distinctive sense of how the violin should be played - with an easy, unselfconscious pliancy that outsiders copy but find ultimately elusive.
This Central European tradition obviously reaches farther east as well.
The Sofia Chamber Orchestra, which played at the Metropolitan Museum on Thursday night, understands it well.


How's New York Doing? Much Better
LEAD: NEW YORK'S economic picture is never simple, but the current situation is trickier than most.
Early in the year there was a spate of announcements from major corporate headquarters that they would be departing the city, carrying hundreds of jobs to the outer edges of the suburbs or beyond.
Then there were headlines saying that New York

The Hypocrisy Industry
LEAD: There is such a large measure of hypocrisy, falsehood and double-dealing in the relations among nations that we hardly notice when one more case crops up.
That's life, so just walk on by.


Royals Changes
LEAD: Four coaches, including Hal McRae, who late last season passed up an offer to become manager of the Kansas City Royals and the fourth black manager ever in the major leagues, will not return to the Royals as batting coach in 1988.

The Public's Right to Speedier Justice
LEAD: The bicentennial of the Constitution and the attention focused on Judge Robert H. Bork's Supreme Court nomination have given us reason to look once again at the state of the judiciary as a whole.
On this subject, however, debate has been overly intellectual and rarified.
We have avoided the critical problems that plague participants in the legal system - judges, lawyers and litigants.

Film: Brazilian 'Vera'
LEAD: ''VERA,'' the first feature film by a new young Brazilian director named Sergio Toledo, is about an unhappy young woman, reared in a Sao Paolo orphanage, who becomes convinced she is a man inhabiting a female body.
The tone of the film is serious, matter-of-fact, even-tempered.


British Labor Is Bogged
LEAD: The rule of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has become so firm, so unshakable that even some Tory supporters are coming to bemoan ''the lack of any real opposition.''


Film: Christo, in 'Islands'
LEAD: ''ISLANDS'' offers, among other things, a case history of the politics of esthetics, the case being Christo, the artist whose fancy it is to swathe large areas in fabrics of various hues.
Albert Maysles, Charlotte Zwerin and David Maysles put their lightweight cameras and sound equipment to humorous use as they accompanied Christo into lobbying sessions with the West German Social Democratic leader Willy Brandt (about covering the Reichstag), with the Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, who has since also become Prime Minister (about covering the Pont Neuf), and with


Celtics Look at King
LEAD: Bernard King, the Knicks' free agent who has played only six games in the last two seasons because of an injured knee, has passed a physical examination with the Boston Celtics.

Iran Missile Hits A Gulf Tanker Owned in U.S.
LEAD: An Iranian missile struck an American-owned tanker in Kuwaiti waters today, causing a huge explosion and setting the tanker ablaze, the Pentagon said.

Mile-Square Reef Is Begun
LEAD: The building of the nation's biggest man-made rock reef, to be spread over a mile-square section of ocean bottom, began Wednesday.

Tractors began shoving quarry rock brought by barge from Santa Catalina Island into the sea a mile off Will Rogers State Beach.


Film: 'Blue Monkey,' Larva Tale
LEAD: ''BLUE MONKEY'' isn't much more than a standard angry-larva story, but it has been cleverly directed by William Fruet, who knows how to give it a new look.
To be sure, what happens in the film is essentially familiar, as a slimy little abomination appears, grows, hatches and goes on to terrorize everyone it meets.

THIS NEW WATERPROOF ONE EVEN HAS A 'BRAIN'

While there are a multitude of 35-millimeter cameras with one or the other of these features, this is the first camera to have them both.

WHAT'S NEW IN COLLEGE RECRUITING
LEAD: COLLEGE recruiters were once recent graduates just past acne who were given a credit card and a late-model car and pointed in the general direction of St.
Louis.
Their brochures described the 110 rolling acres above the Missouri, Ohio or Colorado River, the 10.5 million bound volumes in the college library, and the minimum test scores needed to enroll.


A FOND FAREWELL
LEAD: FEW men, or women, leave this world having provided pleasure to people in many countries.
This claim can certainly be made for Victor Mollo, who died last month in London at the age of 78.
For more than 20 years bridge players everywhere have chuckled over the adventures at the Griffins Club of the Hideous Hog, the Rueful Rabbit and other strange denizens of that fictional locale.


In the Middle Is the Only Place to Be
LEAD: I WOULD like to give a cheer, a resounding huzza for that generally considered dubious position of ''being in the middle.'' By that I refer to the very comfortable circumstances of being neither at the top nor the bottom of whatever it is that you do or are.

WHAT'S DOING IN FRANKFURT
LEAD: The city has many names: Bankfurt, Krankfurt, Angstfurt, Mainhattan.

In Jerusalem of the 1800's
LEAD: In Jerusalem, a city first settled some 5,000 years ago, little at tention was paid to 19th-century architecture until a few years ago, when several historically important buildings were torn down by developers.
Suddenly, the charm of those century-old structures was recognized, and now many of them have been renovated and turned into galleries and restaurants and even a small theater.


For Better Quality, Listen to the Workers
LEAD: A LARGE part of the growing trade problem facing us today has occurred simply because the American people continue to show that they will go anywhere for quality.

ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD: Q. The paint on my bedrooms walls had alligatored, so the painter scraped and spackled the alligatored areas, then painted with latex.

A TASTE OF SECRET PLACES

A MELLOWING TAIWAN SEES A DIFFERENT MAINLAND
LEAD: WHEN the Manchus toppled China's Ming Dynasty in 1644, supporters of the Ming emperors fled to southern China and the island of Taiwan, vowing that they would soon recover the mainland.

RECITAL: DANIEL WAITZMAN
LEAD: DANIEL WAITZMAN'S flute recital Thursday evening in Alice Tully Hall set out to prove a point: Mr.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  BLACK ROBES, WHITE JUSTICE.
By Bruce Wright. (Lyle Stuart. $15.95.) As a judge in the New York State courts for 17 years, Bruce Wright has never minced his words about the almost inevitable racism of white Americans, and that has often led to accusations that he hates all whites.
Justice Wright, now on the New York State Supreme Court, finds that somewhat ironic since his mother was white.


Correction
LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article about bottle laws in The Week in Review Oct. 4 misstated the status of legislation in California.
A recent California law, designed to encourage recycling, involves no deposit but gives consumers a penny per container turned in.
It represents a compromise between the beverage industry and environmentalists.

A NATION IN DECLINE?
LEAD: Barbara Tuchman's article successfully delineates the malaise afflicting this country.
The New York Times Magazine itself is a prime example of our illness.
Mrs.
Tuchman's article should have been the cover and the lead story in the magazine.
Instead, you featured Marcello Mastroianni - a perfect example of the use of image over substance and shallowness over relevance, and a significant indication that The Times will not make the effort to ''raise the level of public understanding from frivolity to a readiness to take serious things seriously .


MISS PFITZENMAYER TO WED
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Kenneth E. Pfitzenmayer Sr. of Chatham, N.J., have an-nouncedthe engagement of their daughter Elizabeth Ane Pfitzenmayer to Gregory John Robitaille, the son of Mrs.

A NATION IN DECLINE?
LEAD: I was disappointed by Barbara Tuchman's article.
Though the title teased us with an analysis of a society in decay, Mrs.
Tuchman failed to deliver: the essay was little more than an invective against the incompetencies of the Reagan Administration.
Surely the problem is not as simple as that.
Decline involves not merely the failures of a single administration.


DANCE: BY ROBERT LORCA, MORE THAN FLAMENCO
LEAD: THERE is theater that stands out for its artistic vision and for the pleasure of the performers' company.
The Spanish Dance Arts Company offered such theater on Thursday at the Symphony Space, in an evening of music and dance that was like sharing a glass of wine with old friends.


INCINERATION CRITICIZED
LEAD: Why are Richard T. Dewling, the state's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, and his assistant, Donald Dieiso, so intent on trashing scientists and concerned citizens who oppose incineration?

Headliners; Ingrate
LEAD: When Stig Bergling, Sweden's best-known spy, broke out of prison recently, he did not have to carve a gun out of soap or tunnel under a wall.

Study Says South Africa Prisons Breed Illness

'Storming Heaven' Defended
LEAD:  To the Editor:


For Swiss Elections, Little Suspense
LEAD: The world's most stable parliamentary democracy will go to the polls Sunday and most of the world will not take notice.

SUMPTUOUS 'SAYONARA' AT PAPER MILL
LEAD: ''SAYONARA,'' the musical version of James A. Michener's 1952 novel at the Paper Mill Playhouse through next Sunday, is purely and purposefully sumptuous, and that is the most instantly gratifying thing about it.


TALKING: Clubhouses; Leasing Facilities to Outsiders
LEAD: THE idea of outsiders wandering through a co-op building, a condominium or a homeowner association complex has always been troubling to the residents.

REAGAN VISIT SPURS STATE G.O.P. TO ACT
LEAD: PRESIDENT REAGAN'S visit to New Jersey last week put a few dollars into the state Republican campaign effort and got the party's leaders talking positively about their goals for Nov. 3.
But the event also revealed some worries.


CHER'S NEXT ACT
LEAD: IN CHER'S BEDROOM, there is seating for maybe a dozen.
Opposite a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook one of the Beverly Hills is a long banquette.
In front of the bed two enormous armchairs don't quite surround a vast ottoman.
Like the walls of the living room downstairs that, reminiscent of an ancient tomb, open up to let visitors in from the driveway; and like the huge, supposedly mystical, crystal mounted in the family room, the bedroom arrangement seems reasonable.


Flag Flies in Detroit
LEAD: IT has been 32 years since the Stanley Cup resided in Detroit.
It has been 22 years since the Red Wings captured a regular-season title.
There are banners marking the cups and the first-place victories in every National Hockey League city.

Trade Data Set Off A Market Plunge
LEAD: A brutal week for stocks gave the bull market its first serious correction since 1984 and even provoked some traders to start writing obituaries for the bull.
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 235.48 during the week, to close at 2,246.73.
The daily action was even more spectular with what was thought to be a record plunge of 95.46 on Wednesday, followed by a 57.61-point dive on Thursday and then the real topper, a plummet of 108.36 on Friday.


The Glory of Raphael, The Grace of Boucher
LEAD: IN EXHIBITIONS, AS IN MANY AN-other department of life, there is no mistaking the hand-sewn look.

SPLITTING HAIRS
LEAD: TODAY, MANY WOMEN are lavishing as much attention -and spending as much money - on caring for their hair as they do for their skin.

Mark's Roman Catholic Church.


SHOULD THE KNICKS TRY TO KEEP KING?
LEAD: The Knicks must sign King.
He appears much more capable of helping the Knicks win than Kenny Walker, who was himself injured last year.
Salary is hardly an issue.

A June wedding is planned.


Rob Reiner Applies the Human Touch
LEAD: HE MADE HIS DEBUT AS A DI-rector in 1984 with an affectionate ''rockumentary'' that chronicled the last screeches of a fictitious -and loud - heavy-metal band.
He then turned to a teen-age romance that recalled vintage Frank Capra more than the brat pack.
His third effort was set in the 50's - but instead of trading on nostalgia and the Big Bopper, it focused on four boys in search of a corpse.


My Life as a Boy
LEAD: THE greatest menace while I was growing up came from abroad, from the Germans and the Japanese, our enemies because we were American.
I still remember my terror as a 9-year-old when, running in from playing on the street after school, I saw the banner headline ''Corregidor Falls'' on the evening paper in our doorway and understood that the United States actually could lose the war it had entered only months before.

LEAD: To The Sports Editor:


A Classical Addition To a Contemporary House
LEAD: Rather than setting out to make their mark in a large city like many young architects, Alan P. Shope and Bernard M. Wharton chose to open their office above a restaurant in Greenwich, Conn.
But like most new firms, they began small - renovating antiquated kitchens and bathrooms and adding bedrooms over a garage or onto the back of a house.


Entertaining Innovations
LEAD: It is quite safe to make long-range forecasts.
By the time reality catches up with you, everyone has forgotten what you said.
It is short-term predictions that often leave you with egg on your face.
Luckily, home electronics is an exception to this rule.
Even short-range prophecy is relatively risk-free, because the future is so close its main features are already clear, even if details and timing are not.


Beads to Brighten And Bedeck Us
LEAD: BEADS - THE MOST basic and enduring adornments known to man -are the subject of an absorbing exhibition of exotic and familiar craft expressions, at Tambaran Gallery, 957 Madison Avenue (at 75th Street) through Nov. 15.

BUSH'S RIVALS TRY TO FAN A DISQUIET AMONG VOTERS
LEAD: TO his Republican Presidential rivals, Vice President George Bush is a political paradox, a clear front-runner who seems teasingly vulnerable.
Their problem is finding strategies to fuel voters' uneasiness - as shown in national polls - about Mr.
Bush's strength and independence.


Jazz
LEAD: Although Clare Fischer has been prominent in the jazz world as a composer, arranger and keyboard artist for more than 30 years, he has done most of his work in studios close to his home in California.

ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD: Q. The paint on my bedrooms walls had alligatored, so the painter scraped and spackled the alligatored areas, then painted with latex.
As he finished, areas that had not been spackled started to alligator.
The painter says that there are three layers of paint on the wall and the bottom layer was probably oil paint, and that is why his latex paint alligatored.


AH, YOUTH: WHEN ANYTHING GOES
LEAD: SO what's the matter with youngsters today?
When it comes to clothes, they seem to have this idea that it's O.K. to be a free spirit, to show some imagination, to break the rules.
Or worse, to make up their own rules.
Some of them look as if they reached into a dark closet and put on whatever they grabbed first.





Mathematics And Magic
LEAD: FROM THE DAWN OF HISTORY, sages have intertwined numbers with magic to create the gods, demons and world views needed by the rest of us to make existence seem comprehensible.
The resulting lore has led to vast bodies of superstitious rigmarole, but it has sometimes spawned the luminous visions that draw scientists toward truth.


Slinking Around
LEAD: To the Editor:


PHELAN AND GAMBLE HELP TOPPLE CADETS
LEAD: Army knew that Colgate's tailback, Kenny Gamble, was likely to have a big day at Michie Stadium today.
And he did, gaining 188 yards to move into fourth place on the all-purpose career collegiate yardage list.


In Cambridge, Stalking 'the Weirdest' and Inventing the Future
LEAD: The sleek silver building at 23 Ames Street is formally part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But instead of physics or engineering students, it is populated by rock stars, corporate executives, computer hackers and visionaries.


Lofty Plans for a Growing Family
LEAD: Walter Chatham is an architect who prides himself on the unconventional: His two-year-old sleeps in an industrial-size laundry bin, his dining room has columns but no walls and he treats cheap building materials such as salvaged pillars and corrugated steel with the same kind of reverence as he would hand-gilded cornice moldings or imported marble.


CAPITALS RALLY OVER RANGERS
LEAD: The Rangers didn't play well enough tonight to stave off a desperate charge by the Capitals, who earned a 4-3 victory on the strength of obstinate offense in the game's waning moments.

HIGH-LEVEL MOONLIGHTER: Charles E. Hugel; Tackling the Top Job at Two Companies
LEAD: LAST month, when RJR-Nabisco named as its chairman Charles E. Hugel, Combustion Engineering's chief executive, eyebrows shot up throughout the business community.
Why, people asked, would an Atlanta consumer products company pick an Easterner who has no packaged goods experience, has never worked for RJR, and has his hands full running a $2.7 billion company some 900 miles away?


Hotel Rooms for $100 a Night; London
LEAD: Despite inflation in Europe and the dollar's tumble from its high in early 1985, it is still possible to get a decent hotel room in London, Paris and Rome for about $100 a night for two people.
You may have to go off the beaten path, and you will not find such amenities as full room service, free air-conditioning or on-premises parking.

''It is quite possible that Mr.


A BROKEN COUNTRY
LEAD: Henry Kamm has made a crucial point that needs emphasis (''A Broken Country,'' Sept. 20): eight years after the killing fields, Cambodia today is still a broken country inhabited by broken-hearted, underfed and uneducated people with little hope and practically no help from the rest of the world.


JAZZ: DOROTHY DONEGAN
LEAD: IT is incredible that a major jazz club, the Village Vanguard, has been in continuous existence in New York for more than 50 years, and that the pianist Dorothy Donegan, a major jazz star, has been in and out of New York for more than 40 of those years, without ever performing at the Vanguard until this week.

REINVENTING THE AMERICAN AUTO
LEAD: THE American car has been the stuff of legend - in lyrics, literature, even love - since the early part of this century.
But in the last 10 years, it has been transformed more drastically than at any other time in the previous 50 years.
Faced with two energy crises in the 1970's and fierce competition from Japan,


One Flew Over the Chicken Nests
LEAD: HERE in Ossining, only 40 minutes by train from the heart of New York City, my neighbor Carole keeps hens.

High Costs Deciding Who Controls Medicine
LEAD: THE 1965 act that established Medicare began with the ringing declaration of a principle that the American Medical Association considers as fundamental as the separation between church and state: Nothing in this law shall be construed to authorize any Federal employee to ''exercise any supervision or control over the practice of medicine'' or over the compensation of any person providing health services.

SHOULD THE KNICKS TRY TO KEEP KING?
LEAD: Based on King's performance for the past two and one-half seasons, which consisted of only six games, the Knicks should not sign him.

A HODGEPODGE OF 'TREASURES' IN GREENWICH
LEAD: GIVEN the glut of art that now prevails, a time when there wasn't enough to go around can hardly be imagined.
Yet according to Audrey McMahon, this was the situation as recently as the 1920's, when she became head of the College Art Association and, as quoted by Francis V. O'Connor in ''The New Deal for Art'' of 1972, found that knowledge and appreciation of the subject went no farther west than the Alleghenies.

Today's Interest in The Gardens of The Past
LEAD: In the world of gardening, no word is more peculiar than new.
Mail-order nursery catalogues, especially the more sensational ones that like to promise miracles, tend to use it a lot, in boldface type followed by an exclamation point, or maybe three.
But if a catalogue lists something as new, it generally means only that the plant so described is new to that particular nursery.


INSTITUTIONS' EXPANSION PLANS INCH AHEAD
LEAD: IT has been two and a half years since both the Guggenheim and the Whitney museums announced their intentions to build major additions to their buildings.

LEAD: Papal Coins On Show in Rome


Law and Medicine: Easier Access
LEAD: NOW may be the time to go to medical or law school.
Applications are down significantly, and the schools are scrambling for candidates.

The peak for law schools was not until fall 1980, but the valley is just as deep.

STAGE: FOR COMEDY 'THE NO-FRILLS REVUE'
LEAD: WHEN the theater successfully spoofs itself before a knowing audience, the clubby laughter one hears is different in tone from that of any other kind of laughter generated from a New York stage: It is an appreciative smirk transformed into a satisfied chuckle.

Although their offices' design may become of increasing concern, current considerations involve the selection of telephones, computers, copiers and other instruments of commerce.


The Score On Chamber Music
LEAD: I HAVE WONDERED ABOUT STATISTICS EVER since I took a course from a professor who spent much of the semester explaining that the poll takers who predicted Dewey's defeat of Truman were right.

So, my instinct when any statistical analysis comes to hand is to hold it at arm's length.


Festival '87 Was High on Style
LEAD: AT THE AGE OF 25, THE ANNUAL New York Film Festival, which closed one week ago tonight at Lincoln Center, has been running almost as long as Johnny Carson's ''Tonight Show,'' possibly for many of the same reasons.

Opera: 'Tosca' at the Met With Eva Marton
LEAD: FRANCO ZEFFIRELLI'S two-year old production of ''Tosca'' lumbered onto the stage of the Metropolitan Opera again on Friday.
It is a monument to men's need to create things larger than themselves.

Hotel Rooms for $100 a Night; Rome
LEAD: Despite inflation in Europe and the dollar's tumble from its high in early 1985, it is still possible to get a decent hotel room in London, Paris and Rome for about $100 a night for two people.

Switzerland

SHOULD THE KNICKS TRY TO KEEP KING?
LEAD: Definitely not.
For two years he made laughingstocks of Dave DeBusschere and Scotty Stirling by taking the huge sum of $874,000 from the Knicks each year and not having the decency or courtesy to show his face at Knicks games to lend moral support.
During this two-year period a portion of the $3,400 I paid each year for my four courtside seats helped defray Captain King's salary while he was doing his disappearing act.

A NATION IN DECLINE?
LEAD: Though I have the greatest respect for Barbara Tuchman and very little for Ronald Reagan, I must protest one way Mrs.

Square Deal for Columbus Circle?
LEAD: BACK IN 1985, WHEN THE DE-sign for the skyscraper that has been proposed to replace the Coliseum at Columbus Circle was announced, the project, called Columbus Center, seemed certain to be built.

Recital: Juana Zayas, Pianist

Not much happens in the company's daily activities that escapes her notice.


Girl's Rescue Bolsters Texas City's Pride
LEAD: The rescue would have been dramatic enough anywhere.

Theater: 'Cabaret' and Joel Grey Return
THERE can't be a creepier sight on Broadway right now than Joel Grey.
Back in the role of the sleazy emcee in the musical ''Cabaret,'' the actor is made up just as he was in 1966 - with patent-leather hair, rouged cheeks, purple lips and drag-queen eyelashes.
He darts about like an overwound wind-up doll, twirling his cane with a spastic jerkiness.
As his eyes bulge, so his tongue has a most appalling way of flopping out of his mouth.
And when Mr.
Grey sings, his voice is a piercing siren that doesn't so much welcome revelers to his cabaret, the Kit Kat Klub, as lure them into the hell lurking just out of view - Berlin, 1929.

LEAD: THE Little Orchestra Society under its founder, the late Thomas K. Scherman, hewed out a place for itself in New York musical history largely through its pathbreaking programs of neglected older works such as Berlioz's ''Enfance du Christ.''

REAGAN'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MATTERS
LEAD: Following is a transcript of President Reagan's news conference yesterday in Washington, as recorded by The New York Times:


Topics of The Times; Another for a Poet
LEAD: Rarely have the Swedes displayed as much wit and sense as in bestowing the Nobel Prize in Literature on Joseph Brodsky, whose writing shimmers, just as their citation says, with raillery, parody and an amazing mastery of English idiom.
What a wonderful twist in the life of a poet who was once denounced in his native Leningrad as a ''militant parasite.


BOLD DANCE PROGRAMS THAT EMBRACE SOCIAL ISSUES
LEAD: DANCE, like life, has a way of swinging between extremes.
In modern dance, for instance, the socially involved choreography of the 1930's was very much a thing of the past by the early 60's, when minimalism and abstract formalism came into fashion.
This weekend's varied dance offerings suggest there is a renewed emphasis on work that looks to social issues, although there are performances that range along the spectrum.


Bridgeport Still Split on Fault in Tragedy

LEAD: AS the coming attractions might put it, ''Suspect'' brings you Cher as you've never seen her before.
It brings Cher as a smart, tough, no-nonsense Washington public defender who lives entirely for her work.
She even wears glasses.
And she turns out to be surprisingly credible in this role, certainly a lot likelier than anything else about Peter

LEAD: There was no lack of warning, not just from Cassandras but from serious, knowledgeable people.

Film: 'The Killing Time,' a Thriller
LEAD: JAMES M. CAIN casts a shadow over ''The Killing Time,'' which opens today at the Embassy 1 and other theaters.
Unfortunately, it isn't a very long one.
In a quiet little seacoast town, the kind of place where one of the two sheriffs (Beau Bridges) calls everyone but his colleague (Joe Don Baker) ''Ma'am,'' we are asked to believe that two of the film's four male principals can be contemplating deceit, frame-ups and cold-blooded murder.

LEAD: THE new exhibition at the Center for African Art provides an excellent introduction to African sculpture - especially to the stylistic diversity of its carved figures and masks - but this is only the beginning.

New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: SO far, you can count the number of Beautiful People there on your thumbs, but that's understandable.
It's not even on the same side of the river as Mortimer's and Le Cirque, for goodness' sake, and it lasts 11 hours!
That's asking a lot, even in the name of culture.


10 Days on Vacation With a 10-Year-Old
LEAD: Since nobody I know recommends a mother-son trip as a child-raising device, the vacation I took with my 10-year-old to Hawaii earlier this year was an experiment in more ways than one.
We were two generations with different interests going nearly 5,000 miles to a place we had never been before, trying to see and absorb as much as possible in 10 days' time.


THE CZECHS' DEFIANT PLAYWRIGHT

LEAD: THE county has traditionally supported fine orchestras, excellent choirs, top-notch chamber ensembles and all manner of innovative concert series, but all previous efforts to establish a base for professional opera in the county have been, at best, of short duration.
Undaunted by this precedent, a group of opera buffs have come together to form The Westchester Opera, with performing headquarters at the Tarrytown Music

REBEL WITH A CAUSE
LEAD: While politicians and the news media seem to be concerned with corporate raiders and wheeler-dealers, at one extreme, or with illegal immigrants and welfare recipients, at the other, it is ironic that only entertainers such as John Cougar Mellencamp, Willie Nelson and Bruce Springsteen seem to care about farmers and blue-collar workers who are caught in the middle.

LEAD:  To the Editor:


Question Of the Week; Do You Assess the Football Strike?
LEAD: To me, some of the big losers in the football strike were the networks' TV announcers.

POLLYANNA, EX-BUBBLEHEAD
LEAD: ELEANOR PORTER'S ''Pollyanna'' seems in our time to be a book few people have read but everyone dislikes because of its reputation.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS: REFLECTIONS ON BECOMING A GRANDFATHER

Dance: Second Bill by Wayne Group
LEAD: ONE forgives Dennis Wayne nearly everything for the choreography and opportunity he gives Gerard Alexander, a wonderful dancer, in a ballet inspired by Fred Astaire.

Music View; A TALE OF TWO OPERAS, OR WHEN NOT TO INTERFERE
LEAD: ABOUT HALFWAY INTO THE first scene of the Metropolitan Opera's new ''Rheingold'' on opening night, I became aware that surprisingly little of the staging was distracting my attention from Wagner's own shrewd way of telling his tale of moral decay and betrayal.
So hardened have we become to seeing directors and designers intrude their daring little persons into opera productions that the absence of conceptual handstands and theatrical back flips can now be startling.


Smoking Aloft
LEAD: To the Editor: I was recently on an Iberia Airlines flight fron Nice to Madrid and had requested a seat in the no-smoking section.

LEAD: East End Temple, now 40 years old, has always wanted a new home, but at its current location, the southeast corner of Second Avenue at 23d Street.

Dancers': More Than Meets The Eye
LEAD: NOT JUST A MOVIE, HERBERT Ross's film ''Dancers'' - starring Mikhail Baryshnikov - is a fable for our time.
Critics across the board have hated it.

Putting Old Wrinkles Into a Theater's New Face
LEAD: IT IS LITERALLY A DECADENT building, a place where crumbling plaster, broken column capitals and cracked archways have been carefully preserved, and in more than a few cases, artfully stage-managed.

ANSWERING THE MAIL

A Romantic Finds Reality In Caracas
LEAD: I grew up in Shanghai a privileged white at a time when China was racked by civil war and Japanese invasion, and the sight of penury next to wealth seemed as natural as rain and sun to my young eyes.

Q AND A
LEAD:  A Reason for Eviction  Question: A tenant covered by the Emergency Tenant Protection Act was offered a one- or two-year renewal lease as required by law.
The tenant refused to sign the lease unless it included a provision giving the tenant the right to terminate the lease upon giving the landlord 30 days' notice.


A COMMERCIAL VENTURE
LEAD: If Brent Staples's neighbor has started pimping in the elevator, he's probably a junkie, past caring about eviction notices (About Men, ''A Commercial Overture,'' Sept. 20).
Mr.
Staples should stop agonizing over the whole cosmic schmear and buy himself a good lock and an angle-iron.


FOR BISHOPS AND SANDINISTAS, THERE'S NO RECONCILIATION
LEAD: LEAFLETS circulating in some Nicaraguan war zones show a photograph of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra shaking hands with the Roman Catholic primate, Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo.

BAYLOR'S BUSINESS IS STILL UNIFINISHED
LEAD: At a moment that has seen baseball bats theatrically slammed to the ground and fists triumphantly shot toward the sky, Don Baylor just went about his business. ''I don't hit it and stop and throw my bat,'' Baylor said. ''I've always done it: you hit it and you run around the bases.''


The World's Beneath Paris
LEAD: Beneath the City of Light and giving it a kind of ballast there exists a vast labyrinth of tunnels, caves, quarries and canals little suspected by visitors.
Of course, even the most casual tourist knows of the Paris Metro, but few have looked at it as another sort of museum in which you may observe the daily life of the city.


IT'S TIME FOR HARDWARE CARE
LEAD: TAKE time to clean and do light maintenance on outdoor equipment before storing it for the winter.

IN SHORT
LEAD:  WHAT SHOULD BANKS DO?
By Robert E. Litan. (Brookings Institution, Cloth, $26.95; Paper, $9.95.) Not since just after the Depression has there been so much talk about the need to restructure the nation's financial system.
Several grand plans have been suggested, but perhaps none so intriguing as that put forward by Robert E.


Opera: Boston Camerata in 'L'Orfeo'
LEAD: MONTEVERDI'S ''Orfeo'' is not the first opera, but it is the first by a truly gripping composer.
Appearing in 1607, it was actually the sixth attempt at this new art - one intended to prod dramatic poetry with a new energy by coloring it with the melodies and rhythms of music.
It was an evolution that the Italian language with its broad vowels and elastic stresses made almost inevitable.


Recital: Robison and Fisk
LEAD: PAULA ROBISON and Eliot Fisk gave another of their appealing flute and guitar programs Friday evening at Weill Recital Hall.
The two players are expert, sensitive and affable; they know how to give the audience a good time, and they make a bit of modern music go down easy, even if they do not entirely evade a certain blandness in the process.


CORRECTION
LEAD: A dispatch from Las Vegas, Nev., last Sunday about air-traffic rules in Los Angeles misidentified the court where the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has filed a lawsuit.

U.S.-SOVIET SUMMIT MEETING
LEAD: The team was already hampered by the absence of its best player, Arvidas Sabonis, the 7-foot-2-inch center who is recovering from surgery on his Achilles' tendon one month ago.
Then there was an arduous 26-hour wait in the Soviet Union for heavy fog to lift before traveling.


Jingle Bell Rock In an All-Star Anthology
LEAD: SOMETIME AROUND MIDSUM-mer, about as far away psychologically from Christmas as one could possibly imagine, commercials appear for the annual Crazy Eddie Christmas sale.
Readers may feel a similar sense of inappropriateness at the October appearance of a Christmas album.
But marketing timetables being what they are, this seems to be the time to release such ventures, to judge from the host of

ADVICE ON MAMOGRAMS IS USUALLY NOT TAKEN
LEAD: ABOUT two months ago, Dr.
Leonard Davis, a radiologist in private practice in West Los Angeles, offered to do mammograms at the cut-rate price of $50 for women working at a Rockwell International plant in the San Fernando Valley.
Dr.
Davis, a strong advocate of mammography, the diagnostic technique that detected Nancy Reagan's breast cancer, reasoned that the price would be a strong incentive, since the test normally costs $100 to $150.

Hempstead Goes to 5-0
LEAD: The Hempstead Tigers (5-0) crushed previously unbeaten Massapequa (5-1), 44-7, yesterday, extending their unbeaten streak in Nassau County Conference I to 34 games.


INEXPENSIVE HELP FOR BOATERS
LEAD: The Westport Police Department's plan to to solicit $50 contributions from boaters forced to avail themselves of the services of the local Marine Rescue Unit  [ ''Westport to Solicit Boater Donations,'' Sept. 20 ]  appears to be yet another scheme by which the boating population of Connecticut, having been conceived by many to be all affluent and therefore all able to afford all such financial invasions, is to be expected to pay a second time for the services that it receives.


RUTGERS ON TOP; LOOK TO BOWL BID
LEAD: Rutgers stirred visions of its first trip to a bowl game outside the state of New Jersey by winning, 27-14, today from an Army team depleted by injuries to its quarterbacks.


SEARCH FOR CHARLIE MCCARTHY TUNES INTO END OF THE WORLD
LEAD: WE Americans tried hard to remove ourselves from the reality of what was going on in Europe in 1939.
After all, there was a large ocean between us, The War had saved the world for Democracy and the idea that anyone would even consider another was ridiculous.
Anyway, even if they did, it was not our business.


Protecting Trees In Lake Forest
LEAD: PEOPLE in Lake Forest, Ill., take trees seriously.
For eight consective years, the National Arbor Day Foundation has designated the community ''Tree City, U.S.A.'' because of the profuse planting and nurturing of trees by its 17,000 residents.


POLLUTION PROBLEMS IN LONG ISLAND SOUND
LEAD: Your article on pollution in Long Island Sound  [ ''Two Groups Forming on Sound Pollution,'' Sept. 27 ]  was timely.
A friend and I recently took an 11-day sailing cruise to Block Island and back and were shocked to learn that marinas don't provide facilities for dumping sewage from boat holding tanks or portable toilets.


PLAYING THE PERCENTAGES
LEAD: IT seldom happens that a single slam deal presents major problems in bidding and play that world-class players have trouble solving, even in the post-mortem.
One such deal, shown in the diagram, occurred at the start of the World Team Championships, which ended yesterday in Jamaica, and generated argument for several days.

HOLMES RETURNS IN 'FLIGHTS OF DEVILS'
LEAD: MOST regional theaters, if they do new plays at all, bury them in the middle of a season weighted down by Broadway comedies, familiar musicals and classic revivals.
As a refreshing change, Long Island Stage displayed the courage of its artistic conviction by opening its 13th season with a new play, ''Flights of Devils,'' by Tom M


THE GUIDE
LEAD:  GOOD EGGS  Never mind the birds and the bees; consider the fish.
The naturalists at the Cold Spring Harbor Fish Hatchery do, and, since this is fall, a traditional ritual, dating back to 1883, has begun: the autumn egg-taking.
That's a demonstration twice a day, Saturdays and Sundays at 1 and 3 P.M., that shows visitors how eggs are extruded from the female trout and then mixed with similarly extruded milt from the male to create fertilized eggs.


New Vitality In South Beach
LEAD: THE first building of South Pointe Towers began receiving occupants here last week, ending a long struggle with financial difficulties.


If You're Thinking of Living in:; Ansonia/Derby
LEAD: FOR more than 200 years, what are now Ansonia and Derby, at the confluence of the Naugatuck and Housatonic Rivers in Connecticut, were a single unincorporated community.
It was a thriving shipping and shipbuilding center from which sloops carried livestock and fish to the West Indies.


Dance: National Company of Senegal
LEAD: DANCE lovers applauding an enjoyable program may occasionally feel like rushing down the aisles to cheer the performers or even like jumping on stage to dance along with them.

Public TV: That Delicate Balance
LEAD: WHEN BILL MOYERS RE-turned to public television a year ago, he arrived with a slate of ambitious projects, a potful of foundation money and high expectations.
However, it was not long before Mr.
Moyers, who had been away for five years, was reminded of the frustrations of working in a system that is maddingly democratic, with as many bosses -317 - as it has stations.


Question Of the Week; Do You Assess the Football Strike?
LEAD: The owners were successful because they enacted a superior game plan.
By not ''closing shop,'' management was able to provide union members with an alternative to striking without pay.
And with renewed television contracts guaranteeing income, public acceptance wasn't even necessary for the replacement games to serve their purpose of breaking union solidarity.


THE HUNT BROTHERS' BILLION-DOLLAR DEBT
LEAD: I am disgusted at the legal tactics the Hunt brothers are using to avoid paying the $2.43 billion they owe their creditors (''Battling a Billion-Dollar Debt,'' by John A. Jenkins, Sept. 27).

MOVIES
LEAD:  The Bishop's Wife  Starring Cary Grant, David Niven, Loretta Young. 1947.
Embassy Home Entertainment. 109 minutes. $19.95.

ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD: Q. My toilet does not always flush properly.
When it doesn't, the water swirls around without going down and the toilet makes a gurgling sound.
A second flushing usually does it, but in rare cases I even have to use a plunger.
Originally the plumbing system lacked a vent stack, but I retrofitted one by installing a tee fitting that I cut into the main waste line in my basement.


Averting Blizzard of Paper
LEAD: Wall Street is rediscovering the importance of the denizens of the back office, who process and clear the endless stream of stock transactions, allowing the stock markets to function.

REAPING THE HARVEST
LEAD: BETWEEN MID-SEPTEMBER AND early November, segments of rural France take on an air of anticipation, anxiety and celebration.
It is vendange, the grape harvest, when the status of the grapes tells much about the wine for the year.
But regardless of the grapes' condition, vendange is a time for a fete, which translates, quite naturally, into good food and good times.


IGNORING THE PANIC WORSENS THE PROBLEM
LEAD: MARKET analysis provides the single most reliable tool for anticipating major changes in economic trends, and to some degree, accompanying social trends as well.
A particularly dramatic shift in the trend of a major market virtually always constitutes a signal that a fundamental change in the associated environment has occurred or will soon occur.


IN THE NEW YORK SUBURBS POLITICS IS SURPRISINGLY VARIED
LEAD: IN local elections next month, the New York suburban counties closest to New York City are likely to establish their political complexions for the next few years.

LEAD: The activities of Unicef, as well as those of other United Nations agencies in Lebanon, have been severely hampered by the depressed economy, deteriorating public services and terrorism, agency officials say.


The Perils of Tinkering With Credibility
LEAD: EVERY FILM REQUIRES ITS audience to make a leap of faith, but some leaps are longer than others.
A lot longer.
It isn't even a question of whether what we're seeing can literally be believed.
One film may make its viewers accept the idea that a nobody from Palookaville can slug his way to the top of the boxing world, or that a schoolboy can travel backward in time to meet his parents as teen-agers; another may strain credulity with the sight of a simple soul making a visit to his neighborhood store.


Social Events
LEAD: Celebrating the Theater  Halloween Preview  Oct. 25 - Costumes are optional but merriment is mandatory at a Caribbean Halloween party featuring Chinese-Hispanic food, a cash bar, dancing and a raffle at Bayamo, 704 Broadway (just north of Fourth Street).
The event, from 7 to 11 P.M., will benefit the Jewish Guild for the Blind, which has provided services for visually impaired people of all religions and races since 1914.


SPORTSMANSHIP SPOKEN HERE
LEAD: SINCE it is the most international of all sports, it has been said that soccer knows no language barrier.
But don't try telling that to Steve Kassoy, the coach of the boys' soccer team at Hartford Public High School.


TWO U.S. BRIDGE TEAMS WIN
LEAD: The world bridge championships drew to a close here today with the United States claiming a double victory.

A Musical Born of South African Protest
LEAD: THE LILTING SOUND OF Mbaqanga, South Africa's distinctive black pop music, filled Lincoln Center's Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater on a recent afternoon.
Six musicians, looking sharp in pressed khaki uniforms, were churning out the music's joyous rhythms, while a seventh player, Douglas Mnisi, swayed back and forth, embroidering the beat with lightning-fast runs on his electric guitar.


NO HEAVY LIFTING
LEAD: Most people share much more in common than they realize.
Our aspirations for ourselves, our families, our associates and our countries are usually not too different.
It is only natural, therefore, to have common ways of expressing these aspirations.


Where Have All the Folk Stars Gone?
LEAD: READING THE MEMOIRS of Joan Baez and Judy Collins, folk-music pioneers who are both now in their late 40's, one is tempted to mourn the vanishing tradition of the folk-music heroine.
Through the 60's and 70's, the image of the long-haired, guitar-toting folkie with flowers in her hair, burning with noble ideals, was a cliche that, while often ridiculed, bespoke a artistic seriousness that in the age of music video is disappearing from the pop mainstream.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  THE PIANOPLAYERS, by Anthony Burgess. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $4.95.) Anthony Burgess's 29th novel is about a man, much like the author's own father, whose piano playing provides the real-time soundtrack for silent pictures; his career falls apart with the advent of a new technology called talkies.


Highland Express
LEAD: To the Editor: On Aug. 24 you carried a Travel Advisory item on Highland Express, and for some time the Travel section has been carrying advertisements for this airline.
I bought seats on it because of the advertisements, and I feel it is my duty to warn others about the airline.

Charles G. Newbery performed the ceremony at St.
John's of Lattingtown Episcopal Church.


Question Of the Week; Do You Assess the Football Strike?
LEAD: The ramifications of the strike of 1987 parallel last week's stock-market crash.
Everyone involved got hurt: fans, owners, players, TV and vendors.
But most of all the fans.


Police Chief Bars AIDS List
LEAD: Police Commissioner Kevin M. Tucker has barred officers here from compiling ''any list related to a communicable-disease patient'' after a precinct posted the names and addresses of people believed to have AIDS.

Beaumont Theater Puts Out a Magazine
LEAD: ONE of the newest productions of the Vivian Beaumont Theater appears on paper rather than on stage.


Music: Leinsdorf Leads Philharmonic and Bolet

FROM THE WRITERS' CORNER: Four Voices; Susan Allen Toth: 'A Surge of Greed'
LEAD: BROKERS hurling themselves from high windows.
Men selling apples on street corners.
Silent, shuffling breadlines and shouting crowds outside banks.
Even for many of us who did not endure the Great Crash, images of the Depression still flicker across the years.
Is that why so many people panicked?


The Networks Stay Neutral

Beyond Left and Right, Let's Seek Common Sense

TAMIL RESISTANCE WANES
LEAD: INDIAN troops were winning the real estate in their battle with Tamil guerrillas last week, but their main political target, Velupillai Prabakaran, commander of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, reportedly escaped to fight another day.
After a two-week siege, 8,000 Indian soldiers were said to have captured all but a few pockets of resistance in Jaffna, the northern stronghold of Sri Lanka's Tamil minority.


In Brazil, Evangelicals Are on Rise
LEAD: Most Friday evenings, members of a local Pentecostal church gather near the water's edge on Copacabana Beach for intense and emotional prayer sessions at which they try to exorcise ''diabolical'' African spirits from prospective converts.


A VETERAN RETURNS TO WORK
LEAD: BRAD BENSON had decided before the National Football League players' strike that, no matter what anyone else did, he would follow a certain moral code.
This meant he would not cross the Giants' picket line and would not hold a grudge against those who did.
Or try not to, at any rate.


DR. DEBORAH A. DRISCOLL BECOMES BRIDE OF DR. CHRISTOS COUTIFARIS IN STAMFORD
LEAD: At the Greek Orthodox Church of the Archangels in Stamford, Conn., Dr.
Deborah A. Driscoll and Dr.
Christos B. Coutifaris were married yesterday by the Rev.
George Poulos.


CHARTER CHANGE IS SEEN AS A KEY MINORITY ISSUE
LEAD: People who crowded into a forum at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem last week agreed on one point: the planned revision of the New York City charter is the ''single most important political issue'' for the city's minority groups.


NEWS SUMMARY: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1987

Prenatal Clinic Established at Jersey High School
LEAD: The first prenatal clinic at a New Jersey high school has been established at the Chestnut Street School, an alternative high school here for about 125 pregnant teen-agers.


Film With a French Accent
LEAD: One day in the first week of June, we students at the Alliance Francaise set out like a band of Parisian Huck Finns to see, not the world, but the movies.
What freedom we had!
As debutants Francophones, it didn't make much difference to us which movie - we were bound to miss most of the dialogue anyway.


FROM THE WRITERS' CORNER: Four Voices; Robert Coles: Children's Questions
LEAD: MY work as a child psychiatrist keeps me in constant touch with young people, who have their own ways of indicating interest in the world, including the social or political or economic events that take place in it.
Boys and girls are especially prone to respond to the more dramatic events in the news - wars, earthquakes, accidents, robberies or murders, and needless to say, athletic contests.


C. P. OBERG WED TO SHERRI CARROLL
LEAD: The Bryn Mawr (Pa.) Presbyterian Church was the setting yesterday for the wedding of Sherri Lynne Carroll, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

EVEN FOOTBALL PLAYERS FIND LABOR'S GLORY HAS FADED
LEAD: Vanquished in their three-week strike, the behemoths of the National Football League Players Association carry back to gridirons across the country today an expensive lesson in labor-management gamesmanship - one that has become painfully familiar in recent years to tens of thousands of their less affluent fellow tenants in the battered House of


D. G. MURPHY, LAWYER, WED TO MARGARET CHAN
LEAD: The wedding of Margaret LaiPing Chan, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Give Unesco a Second Chance

Rock: Sonic Youth, At Cat Club
LEAD: NAME dropping, or ''citing influences,'' is a game rock musicians and rock critics play expertly, and these days the band name that seems to get dropped most frequently is that of the Velvet Underground.

REBEL WITH A CAUSE
LEAD: John Cougar Mellencamp's sobriquet ''Little Bastard'' might very well be attributable to his fiery demeanor (''Rebel With a Cause,'' by Timothy White, Sept. 27).

It reminds us of the rich, if perhaps simpler, qualities of a younger

LEAD: WHISTLES blew.
Officials in black-and-white striped shirts waved their arms.
