Respect Young Animals When Feeding Children
LEAD: I surely don't fault Moira Hodgson for wanting to give her baby the best (''Some Recipes That Keep Baby in Mind,'' May 28. But what I do find disturbing is that she recommends veal, of all things, as an alternative to the bland fare babies usually have to put up with. Doesn't she see the paradox? Doesn't she realize that by urging readers to feed their babies veal, she is ignoring the terrible cruelty inflicted on the infants of another species?

Wild Horses Ensnared in People's Battles

Tennis Court Appeal: Ground the Grunters
LEAD: Anyone who has watched the 15-year-old Yugoslav tennis star, Monica Seles, in her French Open match against Steffi Graf or during this past week at Wimbledon, must have been filled with admiration for the youngster.
At the same time, I cannot see how anyone could help but be annoyed at the grunts - more like piercing shrieks - that she emitted every single time she hit a shot.

The Message for China
LEAD: There are valid grounds for debate on how far the United States and allies should go in response to China's brutal new policy of repression.

Dangerous . . . No, Make That 'Fatal' Liaisons
LEAD: It seems a racy enough tale certainly, but on video even lust and seduction can sometimes use that something extra.
When it is released next week, ''Dangerous Liaisons'' will be its same libidinous self, but Warner Home Video is attempting to help it along a bit with ''repositioning'' - shifting it from one category to another in hopes of altering preconceived notions.

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING OPRAH
LEAD: Barbara Grizzuti Harrison's article ''The Importance of Being Oprah'' (June 11) was a bit harsh in its portrayal of Ms.
Winfrey as a self-ordained New Age guru for the talk-show masses.
If Ms.
Winfrey toots her own horn - if she feels compelled to evangelize about her ''path'' - it is understandable, given her triumph over a hellish childhood.


Sweet Memory of a Cherry Tree That Touched the Stars
LEAD: THE scream of a chain saw has never been my favorite sound, but this time my imagination must be kept sternly in check.

As Tanglewood Goes, So Go the Berkshires
LEAD: As the Boston Symphony opened at Tanglewood last weekend, the music festival, now in its 53d season, seemed as much a part of the Berkshires as the sparkling lakes, hills and villages in which it is set.
Yet the idyllic setting and musical experience are partly an illusion, for what the picnickers on the lawn don't see is the backstage bustle among busy musicians and the uneasy equilibrium in which festival and community exist.

Charles Cary officiated.


The Fabric of the Flag
LEAD: What is it about Americans and their flag?
As each Fourth of July rolls around, we excite the wonder of other democracies with our explosive patriotic fervor.
Americans salute flags, chant pledges and belt out anthems more than any other free people.
And this year, the patriotism has been whipped up by exaggerated reaction to the Supreme Court's flag-burning decision.


Why Kaiser Is Still the King
LEAD: Kathy Adams looked down at her 4-week-old son, born two months prematurely, and remembered the weeks of medical care he received under the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, from the intensive-care ward to the doctor's office.

Question Of the Week; Are the New Tennis Players Exciting?
LEAD: I think a lot of their game is based on power, especially on the men's side.
A match can be exciting with a lot of powerful groundstrokes, but after three hours of pounding away, it gets very monotonous.
The old players would use a more strategic approach to the game.
Now money has become a major issue with sponsors and endorsements, and it kind of takes the etiquette out of the game.

Candlewood Stages a Revival of 'Camelot'
LEAD: ''CAMELOT'' is not the best musical in history, and it is not the shortest one, either.

DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE
LEAD: Why do outhouse doors have crescent moons on them?
Ronald S. Barlow tells us the symbol was originally intended for the edification of illiterate rustics - the moon, a traditional female sign, indicated the women's john, a radiant sun the men's.
Since women's outhouses were generally kept in better repair than the men's, more of them survived, until finally the moon became the universal outhouse trademark.

PASTIMES: Camera
LEAD: Those of us who have struggled to make slides of black-and-white prints will not soon forget Kodak's direct-positive film developing kit.
Here's the way it worked: You loaded up with ultra-fine-grain, ultra-slow Panatomic-X, bracketed your exposures wildly and then souped the film in no fewer than 15 different solutions.

Review/Jazz; The Zawinul Syndicate
LEAD: Joe Zawinul's quirks, the foundation of some of the most influential jazz-rock fusion, led him off the deep end for the Zawinul Syndicate's late set Wednesday at the Bottom Line.
Mr.

But in his best work with Weather Report and Miles Davis, interruptions were balanced with melody.


A Man of the Theater With an Affinity for Opera
LEAD: Harold Prince is delighted when people ask him whether he has any background in opera.
The master of spectacle and laughs on Broadway is about to unveil his production of one of the great canonic operas, Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' on the New York City Opera's opening night, Thursday.

LIFE STYLE: Sunday Menu; A Tasty Meal in a Pocket
LEAD: This meal-in-a-sandwich takes advantage of summer produce: the dewiest cucumbers, the crispiest peppers and the juiciest tomatoes.
Fresh herbs are more plentiful now, too, and add a fillip of flavor.
The meal takes just minutes to prepare and barely heats up the kitchen.
But perhaps the nicest surprise is that it is low in calories.

The name derives from focus, Latin for hearth.


LIFE STYLE: Sunday Outing; On the North Fork of L.I., Quaint Waterfront Towns

More quaint than chic, and with a touch of New England flavor, the five towns that make up Southold - Laurel, Mattituck, Cutchogue, East Marion and Orient - are about a two-hour drive from Manhattan, and just 10 to 15 minutes from the Orient Point docks of the Cross Sound Ferry to New London,

LEAD: TWENTY years after Cleveland's Cuyahoga River caught fire and Lake Erie was pronounced dead, strangled on its own algae, the Great Lakes have made a slow recovery.

Review/Music; The Danish Radio Choir Stops Over
LEAD: The Danish Radio Choir, a mixed-voice group of 28, is in the midst of a seven-event American tour - one that seems to be carrying them mostly to big churches and big performing spaces.

By Steven Corbin. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $19.95.)

THE JOYS OF VICTIMHOOD
LEAD: A SHAME THERE ISN'T A MA-chine, the sociological equivalent of a seismograph, that registers fundamental shifts in social attitudes and concerns.
In the absence of such a machine, we all have to operate with our own often rather primitive social radar, taking our signals where we find them.
When one's dentist, for example, begins to say ''pasta'' instead of spaghetti or noodles, one knows that the interest in cookery has fully swept the middle classes.

LEAD: There are some compelling reasons why the Polish director Andrzej Wajda cannot accompany his two latest theatrical productions - ''The Dybbuk'' and ''Hamlet IV'' - to their American premieres next weekend at the Pepsico Summerfare International Performing Arts Festival at SUNY-Purchase.
It's not simply that he is president of the jury at the Moscow Film Festival, which begins Friday, or that he has just been elected a senator in Solidarity's landslide at the national polls.

Patent Problems

Intermarriage And Judaism
LEAD: I found Ari Goldman's interview of Egon Mayer  [ May 21 ]  very interesting.

Jewish parents who did whatever they could for their children, and only ask that they marry Jewish, feel betrayed and heartbroken.


Seeking Out Weekend Trips
LEAD: AMERICANS are traveling more often but taking shorter trips.
This trend, which surfaced in 1984, has been growing , according to survey after survey.

A SPRAY OF SPARKS ERUPTS TO MUSIC - WITH THE AID OF ELECTRONICS
LEAD: New technologies are taking some of the quesswork out of fireworks exhibition, making displays fancier and more dramatic.

A Century of Black History Brought Into Focus
LEAD: ''Black Photographers Bear Witness: 100 Years of Social Protest,'' at the Williams College Museum of Art, is fascinating evidence of the incomplete and unsettled state of photography history.

From Sound Stage To Strong, Silent Museum
LEAD: First it was the International Design Center, now it is the American Museum of the Moving Image.
The architects Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel seem to have cornered the market in making old industrial structures in Queens into significant new public buildings.
Like the International Design Center, a vast complex of furniture and design showrooms housed in a pair of old factory buildings in Long Island City, the American Museum of the Moving Image has an importance that goes far beyond Queens, and beyond New York City as well.

A Celebrity Returns, Undimmed

PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: There have been lots of excuses for not showing up for a game or even a tournament, but for stark simplicity, not to mention total incredibility, it is hard to beat Boris Spassky's reason for backing out of the Fifth World Cup Tournament in the World Trade Center in Rotterdam, which began June 3.
He was simply too tired.


Lucy H. Salter and David B. Singer, Health-Care Executive, Are Married

The Gospel According to Verity
LEAD: KNOWN AS THE PORTAL OF Paradise, it is the central entryway on the west front of the Cathedral of St.

And though much of the portal, including the bronze doors with their magnificently sculpted panels, has long been complete, for more than half a century the 24 lime-stone blocks flanking the doorway stood uncarved.


Some Major Regattas, but Not as Costly
LEAD: Three major regattas with as many as 700 boats and 3,000 competitors are set for the Northeast this summer.
Sailors are gravitating to a less costly approach to the sport.
It is one in which racing identical boats reduces the need to keep up with the ever-changing rating rules of handicap regattas.


Neneh Cherry Puts a New Spin On Dance-Pop
LEAD: Day and night, radio stations pump them out: computerized drumbeats and synthesizer lines that plink, hum and kick behind girlish voices vowing love or striking tough poses.

The Met's chairman, James S.

Nikolai Skurigin last week was not as badly damaged as he thought.
Colonel Skurigin noticed smoke from one engine right after he took off on a training flight from Kohlberg, Poland.

The East Demands Power And Finds It Hard to Supply
LEAD: THE electric companies of the middle Atlantic states ran so short of power last summer that on two occasions the utility consortium that coordinates their production had to cut voltage to avoid blackouts.
This year, with the summer less than one-third gone and the hottest weeks ahead, the consortium has already taken that step twice.

LEAD: For distillers, the 1980's have proved to be a prolonged hangover.


PERSPECTIVES: Battery Park City; Shaping the Pattern of Future Housing

FICTION
LEAD:  THE DOWNFALL OF THE GODS.
By Villy Sorensen.
Translated by Paula Hostrup-Jessen. (University of Nebraska, $14.95.) The versions of the Norse myths with which we are most familiar today are still the romantic 19th-century ones.
But each age must find its own truths in ancient lore, and so it is time for a new interpretation of these stories.

A number of theater people, however, manage to do what Macbeth could not - ignore the bloody corpse and get on with the business of eating and drinking and staying alive.


A Symbol of South African Struggle

LEAD: The new Canadian embassy here is not like Washington's other embassies.

LEAD:  Baseball


OPRAH TALK
LEAD: I am thoroughly disgusted by Oprah Winfrey's arrogant and self-serving theory of ''the Universe'' (''The Importance of Being Oprah,'' by Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, June 11).
Her claim that she was ''born for greatness'' ideologically contradicts her convenient reliance on free will.
Furthermore, her accusation that welfare mothers consciously ''choose'' to be such leads me to believe that her boyfriend, Stedman Graham, is not the only Republican in this wonder couple of the 1980's.


Budget Office Asks Cabinet To Review Financial Controls
LEAD: The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Richard G. Darman, has asked all Cabinet departments and two major non-Cabinet agencies to report on what they are doing to combat financial fraud and abuse, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget says.

Being Chinese Means Never Having To Say I Love You
LEAD: AS Carolyn was helping me to clean up after dinner last night, she asked me rather unexpectedly, ''Mom, have you ever kissed Grandma?'' ''No.'' I put away my tray. ''Have you ever told her that you love her?'' ''No.
Why?'' ''Why not?'' Yes, why not?
I stopped to think.
It simply is not our custom to show our affections openly.

These were the names that buzzed around the kitchen when corn was ready for picking.

The Way I Live Now

Every A.B.A. has its ''big books,'' and that year, one of the biggest was a novel called ''At Risk'' by Alice Hoffman.

I was just one of many gay men at the A.B.A.


Nominal Value

Several of this summer's films, from the sublime to the ridiculous, send their heroes searching for hints of God's presence in the universe, on quests for spiritual meaning.
There is the search for the Holy Grail in the high-spirited ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' the ghostly return of the Chicago Black Sox in the poignant ''Field of Dreams'' and even a journey through space to visit a possible deity in the simple-minded ''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.

Minority Contractors Push for Set-Aside Laws
LEAD: Among the minority contractors, the recently completed Legislative Office Building in Hartford is seen as clear proof that discrimination exists in Conneticut construction circles.
Because the building was a project of the legislative branch of government, it was exempt from a state set-aside law and less than 0.5 percent of its cost went to minority contractors.


Texas Businessman Hands Out $10,000 Checks in State Senate
LEAD: A millionaire handed out $10,000 checks on the State Senate floor one day this week while legislation that interested him was pending.

Compaq's Conquests in Europe

About Men; Images of a Brief Moment
LEAD: LET'S GET THIS straight.
I grew up angry, bitter, confused, wild.
I started smoking before I was 10 and sampled most of the better-known hallucinogens when I hit college.

Maybe that was because my father did enough of that for both of us.

Question Of the Week; What Should Happen To Rose?
LEAD: Pete Rose should take his lumps (as he gave them to Ray Fosse and Bud Harrelson) from the commissioner's hearing.
Then, if he doesn't like the result, he should go to civil court.
Rose is a grown man who agreed to abide by baseball's rules.
For him to try an end run around the commissioner's office is to make his own rules, which is what I suspect he has been doing for years.

Supremely Surly
LEAD: Suddenly but predictably, the Reagan appointees to the Supreme Court have taken control.
What's neither inevitable nor acceptable is the raucous tone and unruly language the members of the new majority direct even against each other.

A Castle to Dream
LEAD: TRAVELING in England today, some writers tell us, is often depressing.
In his recent ''Coasting,'' Jonathan Raban described a deteriorating rural culture and landscape.

Review/Pop; A Rock Beat for Dancing, With a Zairian Twist

San Francisco:  Harper &amp; Row. $17.95.


Question Of the Week; What Should Happen To Rose?
LEAD: The issue here, as with flag-burners, is much more important than the fate of the individuals accused.
It involves the Constitution.
If we are a democracy, and if baseball is our national game, why is it governed by a commissioner who is routinely called a ''dictator'' or a ''czar''?
If Pete Rose's contract is not renewed by the corporation, can he get a job with the opposition?


VIEWS FROM THE BARRICADES
LEAD:  WORDS OF FIRE, DEEDS OF BLOOD: The Mob, the Monarchy, and the French Revolution.
By Olivier Bernier. (Little, Brown, $21.95.) A history of the French Revolution poses two nearly insurmountable ''story problems'': first, in easing the reader through those stodgy early chapters in which the deficit mounts and a series of finance ministers fail to grasp the situation; then, in finding a way to stitch together a coherent narrative from the ragbag of obscure factions, variegated personalities and unaccountable plot turns that make up the later course of events.


OPRAH TALK
LEAD: I lived in Baltimore when Oprah Winfrey was the host of ''People Are Talking.'' A friend of mine appeared on her show to promote a book she had written that described her experience in getting over a terrifying rape.

NEWS SUMMARY
LEAD:  INTERNATIONAL/3-17


PASTIMES: Bridge
LEAD: Those who think that a Caucus-Race is something vaguely Congressional are quite wrong, and should refresh their memories of the subject by consulting chapter three of ''Alice in Wonderland.'' The chief feature of a Caucus-Race is that everyone moves in a circle and occasionally drops out.
This was the procedure April 27 at the Cavendish Club in New York City when 13 of the Lewis Carroll characters gathered to contest a bridge Caucus-Race invented by the White

LEAD: THE club district in the West 40's has seen a gradual decline from its high point around 1910 as the Elks, Lambs and other social clubs have given up their buildings.

LEAD: DEJA VU is common among skiers who go scuba diving in the Caribbean: Despite the warmth, there is something oddly familiar about that first plunge into the blue-green water.

PASTIMES: Around the Garden
LEAD: For This Week: This would be a good day to use water-soluble fertilizers on container plants, especially window boxes, patio tubs and clay pots; if any of the crops in the vegetable garden seem to be waning, water them with a water-soluble fertilizer, too.
Order the spring-flowering bulbs as fall catalogues are beginning to arrive in the mail.


A ROLLING STONE
LEAD: Bob Spitz's article ''Raw, Raunchy and Middle-Aged'' (June 4) on the Rolling Stone Keith Richards was insightful.
Insightful, that is, except for Mr.
Spitz's description of Keith Richards: ''a permanent 5-o'clock shadow clings like moss to the hollows of his cheeks.'' I thought everyone knew that a Rolling Stone gathers no moss.

Chiffon, Never a Cover-Up, Turns Into a Show-Off
LEAD: Chiffon was so popular in the 1960's they named a soul group and a margarine after it.
The latest chiffon craze started in Europe about a year and half ago, with the couture collection of Christian Lacroix.

BAD TIMES ON THE BAYOU
LEAD: Thank you for a very accurate account of Louisiana's economic depression (''Bad Times on the Bayou,'' by Wayne King, June 11).
I have recently left my home in southwest Louisiana to find work and a better quality of life.
This doesn't, however, lessen my love for my Cajun heritage, for Saturday mornings at Fred's bar in Mamou or for the Liberty Theater in Eunice on Saturday nights.


The Seas as Classrooms
LEAD: I ENCOUNTERED my first doctorfish on a Caribbean reef.
This was not the finned variety, but the two-legged species, a group of physicians combining a scuba vacation with a ''Diving Medicine in Depth'' seminar.
I felt so secure diving with a bunch of doctors, that I joined them on a dive trip to Fiji a few months later.

Latin Literacy: Pro Bono Redux
LEAD: As a classicist and educator by profession and an educated and literate person, I take issue with a recent letter to the editor  [ Is the Use of Latin 'Pro Bono?' May 28 ] .

The Browning of America, Part One
LEAD: IT took them over a year to build our new house.
We finally moved in during a torrential rainstorm.
Of course our yard was a sea of mud, and the moving van couldn't get up the driveway since the driveway was mud and a few stones, and the decorative island the developer had planted in the middle of our cul-de-sac prevented a large van from making a turn up our driveway even if we had had a functional one.

Vietnam Memories: The War Within
LEAD: BOMBS seemed to explode inches away from my unprotected skull, while grenades soared like bats all around me, draining the blood from all who stood in their way.

OPRAH TALK
LEAD: Oprah Winfrey presents facts, guests and situations in a fresh manner (because of who she is) and we make of it what we will.
That's pretty good for television.
She may be guilty of ''superficial curiosity,'' but that is equally true of every moderator and anchor that I have ever seen on television.


Review/Music; Tanglewood '89 Opens With Ozawa and Watts
LEAD: The Boston Symphony Orchestra opened its Tanglewood season Friday night by combining the tried and true with the well known and the beloved.

Where Little Saba Looms Large

Underneath Saba, the world is more complex.
Seventy feet below Diamond Rock - a starch-white, guano-covered pinnacle some 300 yards from shore - a wriggling azure blob turns out to be a school of blue tangs feeding on an uprotected mass of fish eggs.

WHEN WOMEN FINALLY GOT THE WORD
LEAD: What does a woman need in order to write?
A room of her own and a fixed income, perhaps, but only later on.
First she needs a language to write in.
But for much of history, East and West, the languages of literature were unavailable to women.
Classical languages - Greek and the literary Latin of ancient Rome, an imported Chinese used in early Japan - were once the only written languages that were different from the contemporary spoken tongue, and they were taught almost exclusively to wellborn men.

Wagner Coming to Westchester
LEAD: WHEN the Greenwich soprano Lili Seggos conceived her dream of a Richard Wagner summer festival, the Kensico Dam Plaza in Valhalla was its setting.
Valhalla, of course, is the name of the mythical hall in Wagner's four-opera cycle ''Der Ring des Nibelungen,'' but the plaza also appeals to Mrs.

Canadian Comics Take Aim at Cable Funny Bone
LEAD: In the back room at the Rivoli, you never know what you're going to see.

California
LEAD: To the Editor: Having lived on California's Monterey Peninsula for 20 years, I can tell you that Steven Weisman, in his otherwise informative article on hiking in Big Sur (Travel, June 4), should have mentioned that a post-hike total body search for ticks is mandatory.
Contrary to his report, there are indications of the spread of Lyme disease to the West Coast.

Tuning Up Air-Conditioners
LEAD: SUMMER'S dog days call on air-conditioners to deliver peak performance under grueling conditions.

PRICES: OUT OF SIGHT

A casual spin through a department store reveals that it does, and the price is soaring.
A 1.7-ounce jar of face cream can cost $125.
An elaborate box of loose powder, $75.
An ounce of perfume, $350.
Even a lipstick, something women pick up on impulse, can easily reach a blistering $16.

The Other Face of Glenn Close, Powdered
LEAD: In Stephen Frears's DANGEROUS LIAISONS (1988, Warner Home Video, $89.95), the circling camera scours the powdered faces of Glenn Close and John Malkovich, who play the Marquise de Merteuil and her accomplice in seduction, the Vicomte de Valmont.
Beneath their masks of 18th-century respectability, it finds evil in the half-concealed smirks and glittering eye contact shared by these ultimate sexual sophisticates.

LEAD: The letter by Rosalyn Weene  [ ''Esthetic Goals at Exhibitions,'' June 25 ]  commenting on the last Huntington Township Art League, and in particular the favorable review by Helen A.

Paris's Classic Look for Kids
LEAD: JUST about every American who has strolled through the Tuileries on a weekend afternoon has been entranced by the children in their Sunday best riding the old-fashioned carousel and sailing boats on the pond.

Yorkshire
LEAD: To the Editor: The article on steam trains in Yorkshire, England (Travel, May 7) in effect gave incorrect postage for obtaining the booklet ''Guide to Steam Trains in the British Isles.''

LEAD: WITH about half of the state's cable television companies facing re-licensing in the next couple of years, the decision in the United Cable TV Corporation case - the first to go before the state - is likely to set the tone for those to follow.

Castle Country Along the River Dee
LEAD: IT was not until 1852, when Queen Victoria apparently lost her heart to ''this dear Paradise'' and she and Prince Albert bought Balmoral Castle and its surrounding estate on the banks of the River Dee, that Britain's love affair with northeastern Scotland - its wind-swept grouse moors and salmon-teeming rivers - began.

Meanwhile, The P.L.O. Is Depending on Washington
LEAD: WHEN the late President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt argued in the mid-1970's that the United States held 99 percent of the cards in the Middle East game, the Palestine Liberation Organization attacked him bitterly as a defeatist American stooge.
But today, all Palestinian eyes are on the United States as the holder of the keys to peace in the Middle East and the Palestinian dream of a homeland.


Factionalism Hurts Afghan Rebels as Government Army Fails to Collapse
LEAD: Paradox seems to be the guiding principle of the 10-year-old war in Afghanistan.
The Soviet Army lost in Afghanistan because it never learned to fight a guerrilla war.
Now the rebels who beat them do not appear able to fight a conventional one.


New York's Poorest Neighborhoods Bear the Brunt of Social Programs

NUMISMATICS
LEAD: One of the strangest and most popular coins munches coral and algae on the bottom of the Indian Ocean.
The shell of the Maldive cowrie, Cypraea moneta, has been used as money by the Chinese, the Hawaiians, the West Africans and Ojibwa Indians.
It was considered money 4,300 years ago and is still used today.


Poignance Measured in Digits
LEAD: Normally the phonograph plays a casual accompaniment to our lives.
We think of it, quite rightly, as a means of entertainment.
Yet there are times when the machine suddenly shows a deeper aspect of its character, and the miraculous nature of the instrument stands revealed.


New Peronist: Blending Grit With Wealth
LEAD: Primly perched beneath her debutante portrait, Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat spoke in aristocratic tones about her new assignment: roving ambassador for Peronism, a movement traditionally associated with raucous, blue-collar nationalism.

LEAD: Betsy King crumpled over the last four holes of the Indianwood Golf and Country Club course today, took two bogeys and a double bogey in the stretch, and saw her four-stroke lead at the 44th United States Women's Open evaporate in the pressure cooker of the major championship.

Undergraduates Lament Raising Of Drinking Age
LEAD: Last July, Wyoming raised its legal drinking age from 19 to 21.

Double Header In Toronto: Batter Up, Top Down
LEAD: The best show at the Sky Dome, Toronto's extraordinary new 53,000-seat stadium, is the one almost no one gets to see: the smooth, nearly silent metamorphosis of this building from an indoor stadium to an outdoor one.
Watching the transformation is like no other experience in architecture.
Two massive, vaulted roof panels, each weighing more than 1,800 tons, slide to one end of the stadium, opening up the middle of the roof to the sky, after which a rounded panel at the end rotates all the way around the stadium and disappears beneath the others.

She is largely self-taught.
She paints rapidly in brush and ink.
The earliest of the 69 paintings in ''Yani: The Brush of Innocence,'' at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, were made when she was 3 and 4 years old.

Outdoors; Bonito Challenges The Best of Anglers
LEAD: To some light-tackle enthusiasts - including fly fishermen - the Atlantic bonito is the ultimate quarry.


AROUND THE GARDEN
LEAD: For This Week: Weed, weed, weed or these unwanted plants will usurp valuable soil nutrients and moisture.
Remove the faded flowers from petunias, geraniums, snapdragons and other border annuals to prolong their bloom season through the summer months and prevent them from forming seed pods.
Cut off stalks of flowers that bloomed either to ground level or to strong green stems, depending on the plants.

French Revolution
LEAD: To the Editor: I found ''In the Revolution's Footsteps'' most informative, but I missed a reference to the Chapelle Expiatoire in the Square Louis XVI (south side of Boulevard Haussmann, two blocks west of the Printemps department store).

Italian Fare and a Trattoria Ambiance
LEAD: THE owners of Gate's in New Canaan and the Pompano Grill in Westport have opened a new restaurant, in Fairfield, just beyond the green on the Post Road.
It is called Centro (pronounced CHEN-trow, the Italian way), thus establishing the restaurant's identity almost immediately.
Not that you will have any trouble catching on.

VINTAGE AUSTRALIA
LEAD: Once, a list of the great red wines of the world would have begun and ended in France; five or six Bordeaux, a couple of Burgundies, maybe one from the Rhone Valley.
No longer.
Great red wines are made all over the place these days: Italy, Spain, California, Chile, Australia.
In fact, one of the best of them all comes from Australia.

RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Cycling  Leaders 7 Seconds Apart: Jelle Nijdam of the Netherlands won the 14th leg of the men's Tour de France yesterday, but as the 2,020-mile bicycling event reached the base of the Alps in Gap, France, Laurent Fignon of France and Greg LeMond of the United States were running one-two, just seven seconds apart.


Stella, Reborn as an Unmarried Mother
LEAD: The director would be just a moment.
A nurse rushed into his office to administer the Hollywood equivalent of a swift kick in the backside, his twice-weekly vitamin B injection.
So when the young assistant knocked to say the cast and crew of ''Stella'' were ready on the set, a revitalized John Erman practically flew down the corridor in his white running shoes.


A Court Victory For Time Inc.
LEAD:  Time Inc. won a favorable court ruling in its attempt to acquire Warner Communications Inc. to create the world's largest media company.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I asked my fuel company not to top off the oil tank during summer, as I would rather not have to pay for all that fuel now.
They said that if the tank were not filled it would be subject to scaling, and debris could clog the lines.
I noted that this was a new tank, but they still say this is a possibility.

Question Of the Week; Are Foreign Golfers Better Than Americans?
LEAD: I don't think foreign golfers are better than ours, they are just hungrier.
Our guys are accustomed to large purses and are a little more laid-back.

Not Another Pretty Face
LEAD: ''I'M DOING THIS SEQUENCE where puppets come out of my back with the faces on them of the other cast members in torment,'' says Robert Englund. ''They're the souls of my victims.'' Englund is the actor known by millions of mostly teen-age film viewers as Freddy Krueger, the heinous, disfigured, dream-haunting murderer who first reached the screen in 1984 in ''A Nightmare on Elm Street.

THE EDUCATION OF DAN QUAYLE
LEAD: That's great that Dan Quayle learned a little Spanish prior to his recent trip to Central America.
Too bad he couldn't find time to brush up on the eight-word slogan of the United Negro College Fund.
But then, in Central America he probably had the opportunity to meet with a lot of potential campaign contributors.

Rock From Underground
LEAD: ''Everything i'll sing you's gonna be made out of rubber,'' Peter Mamonov declares on the first internationally released album by the Moscow band Zvuki Mu.
But with Soviet-bloc rock just beginning to reach the outside world, the music's implications are likely to be flexed and stretched in ways its creators could never have predicted.


Foreign Films May Translate Into Rentals
LEAD: In video there's this adage: foreign films play well only in New York and Los Angeles, and woefully almost everywhere else.
Consequently, it is estimated that only about 8 percent of the country's approximately 35,000 video outlets carry any foreign titles.
This fall, though, Orion Home Video will test the prevailing wisdom by deploying 24 of its strongest foreign titles in 500 outlets nationwide.

Style Makers; Ronald Mallory: Jewelry Designer
LEAD: The warmer the weather, the faster Ronald Mallory's jewelry moves.
His medium is mercury, the silvery stuff of thermometers that expands in heat and contracts in cold.


Blue-Blood Lineage, Prices to Match
LEAD: YEARS ago, the Montauk Yacht Club was the playground of the Whitneys, Vanderbilts and Astors.
These days, common folks make the scene, but the bank balance of a blue blood wouldn't be out of place when dining at Ziegfeld's, the club's restaurant.
The menu lists a $34 veal chop and lobster at $15 a pound.


Being Faithful to 'Leonore'
LEAD: In December of 1805, an extremely delicate conference was held at the Lichnowsky Palace in Vienna.
The previous month, Beethoven's first and, as it turned out, only opera had been performed to lukewarm success.
His friends and colleagues, having taken counsel among themselves and made detailed plans, were to meet the composer at a soiree and tell him that his opera needed work.


Paunches and Pinstripe Magic
LEAD: The old man took his place at the far end of the Yankee clubhouse, tugged on his uniform, then sat back and smiled.

Don Pullen, Making Sense of Jazz's Radical 60's
LEAD: Since the late 1950'S and early 1960's, when the cadres of the avant-garde momentarily overran the positions of the jazz mainstream, jazz has struggled, in its more fecund experiments, with a rapprochement between the two.


Triborough Tolls Rise 25 Percent
LEAD: Tolls on the seven bridges and two tunnels operated by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority rose by 25 percent at 3 A.M. today, prompting many motorists to buy extra tokens at toll booths yesterday because the existing tokens will be accepted indefinitely.

In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester; Vacancies Troubling Connecticut's Hotels

Polilce Departments Try To Pick Up on Satanism

To the Moon - and Back
LEAD: The United States caught the world's imagination when the Apollo project sent Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to tread the moon's ancient surface.
But in the 20 years since, the hope of Apollo, that humankind would take more giant steps in exploration of the universe, has been miserably thwarted.


Reviews/Music; A Glass Adaptation Of Poe Tale
LEAD: It is easy to understand why Debussy so ardently pursued Poe's ''Fall of the House of Usher.'' The opera was never really written, but its subject matter exudes the animism of the one stage work that Debussy did complete.
The forests, pools and gardens that surround ''Pelleas et Melisande'' have a spirit of their own - anthropomorphic properties that well out of


Hers; Ready, Willing and Wary
LEAD: RECENTLY I HAVE arrived at what I consider to be a dramatic new understanding of the concept of change.
Although I have always been intrigued by the idea of change in the abstract - even of radical self-transformation - and am daringly open to the untried and untrodden on an intellectual level, I have pursued a rather mollusk-like course in my personal life.


Compassion Served in 'Romantic'
LEAD: NOW that virtually all theater awards extant (perhaps a few newly invented ones, too) have been bestowed upon ''The Heidi Chronicles'' by Wendy Wasserstein, isn't it instructive to renew acquaintance with ''Isn't It Romantic,'' the play that turned a promising playwright into a critically and commercially successful one in 1981.


In Search of The Rates That Bring Borrowers
LEAD: FOR three months, interest rates have been inching down, sliding on their own as the economy weakened and then getting a slight push from the Federal Reserve.
But they almost certainly must go still lower before Americans become buyers again.


A Revue on the High Life in ''Red Hot and Cole''
LEAD: COLE PORTER, who rhymed youth with gin and vermouth, created his own genre: the sophisticated and playful, cooly romantic popular song that represented a time of, in his own inimitable lyric, ''falderal frivolity.''


For Argentina's Economy, the President Prescribes Pain
LEAD: ''GOD is Argentine,'' people here like to say - a way of assuring themselves that the rich and bountiful soil of Argentina will, somehow, take care of whatever abuses and excesses they commit.


Question Of the Week; Are Foreign Golfers Better Than Americans?
LEAD: No.
Curtis Strange won the last two United States Opens, the first golfer to achieve that feat since Ben Hogan.

FORBES MAGAZINE'S BIG GUN: Caspar W. Weinberger; From a Seat in the Cabinet To the Publisher's Chair
LEAD: Caspar W. Weinberger, the publisher not the Defense Secretary, is not at all displeased with his new life.

He mingles at frequent merry parties aboard Malcolm S.


For One Top Free Agent, Compensation Meant Penalization
LEAD: In the 1981 labor negotiations, the club owners, at the risk of a shutdown, insisted they had to have a system of professional compensation for free agents.

The clubs, it developed, didn't really like the idea, but it took them four years and a 50-day strike to find out.

Why Israel Stumbles So In the Search For Peace
LEAD: IT took 15 months of sustained violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip - and inside Israel as well - to push the Israeli Government into proposing elections in the occupied territories.
But last week the proposal all but came apart, under the pressures of an Israeli political system that seems to leave no room for bold action in the absence of national unanimity.


A Herbert Operetta Unfolds at the Emelin
LEAD: IF early 20th-century operetta isn't alive and well at the Emelin Theater, at least it's awake and breathing.
The Light Opera of Manhattan production of Victor Herbert's ''Sweethearts'' (circa 1913), being co-presented with the Performing Arts Center here, isn't likely to convert the uninitiated to the simple pleasures of an antiquated musical genre.


For U.S. Law Enforcers, the County is No Longer a Sleepy Outpost
LEAD: SIX years ago, the lone Federal prosecutor in the White Plains outpost of the United States Attorney's Southern District office spent much of his time looking for work by knocking on the doors of local police departments.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  THE PIGEON, by Patrick Suskind. (WashingtonJU Square/Pocket Books, $5.95.) The well-ordered life of a Parisian bank guard named Jonathan Noel is transformed completely when a pigeon shows up at his door. ''Mr.

LEAD: It hasn't quite received the attention of the Johnstown Flood, which took place in the same state exactly 100 years earlier, perhaps because the Spectrum Flood, which took place just two weeks ago, did not cause any loss of life or ruin many homes.


Fudging the Facts on Puerto Rico
LEAD: What's the right status for Puerto Rico, statehood, commonwealth or independence?
The answer to the perennial question isn't obvious.

That policy fuses ignorance and danger.


Pros' Golf Game Is Not for Amateurs
LEAD: THE argument occurred, as they often do, in a bar.
Roger Maltbie, the pro golfer, was impatiently trying to explain to a sober amateur of modest skill that square grooves were ruining the game.

Dante to Cobb to Rehnquist
LEAD: ONE day some scholar, maybe even one from Yale with a white beard and a graceful command of the language, will recall this period in baseball as a coda to ''The Divine Comedy.'' A period in which a red-capped national hero is dragged, justifiably or no, through an earthly version of Hell and Purgatory - that is, through local courts, state courts and Federal courts.

The Mop as a Metaphor For Life and Other Madness
The most amusing sequences in Al (Weird Al) Yankovic's disjointed farce about a UHF channel that beats out its network-affiliated rivals with wacky programming in the mode of ''Pee-wee's Playhouse'' are its spoofs of television ads, children's shows and music-videos.
When George Newman (Mr. Yankovic), a nerdy dreamer, takes over the management of his uncle's failing UHF station, he finds himself with an unlikely hit after the channel's sweet, dimwitted janitor, Stanley, takes over a flop children's show called ''Uncle Nutsy's Playhouse.'' Stanley quickly wins hearts dispensing an icky homespun philosophy using his beloved mop as a metaphor for life.
Inspired by Stanley's success, George transforms the channel into a kind of Mad magazine of the airwaves, with programs like ''Wheel of Fish,'' advertisements for a chain of stores called Spatula City, and a children's game show in which the first one to find the marble in a tub of oatmeal gets to drink from a fire hose.
In ''Raul's Wild Kingdom,'' the host innocently tries to teach dogs how to fly by tossing them out of his apartment window.

What's Right With New Federal Eviction Law
LEAD: To the Editor:


CAMPUS LIFE: Northwestern; Tradition Crumbles, Students Grumble
LEAD: It's tradition for Northwestern University students to cheer on a losing football team, to muddle through harsh Chicago winters and paint a rock set in the campus courtyard.
But traditions can be broken, or in this case, cracked.


VIOLENCE IN A MAN'S WORLD
LEAD: The violence to women does not stop on the streets.
The emotional trauma is perpetuated by the courts.
Gender bias in judicial proceedings exists.
This is a subject that cannot be ignored.
It warrants the attention of every member of the bar and bench.
SHARON A. HOPKINS  Potomac, Md.


The Peter Pan Generation Makes Room for Small Fry
LEAD: It is a truism among baby boomers that none of them ever really feels grown up.
Their parents might have guarded such a feeling as a shameful little secret, but this generation refuses to be quiet about it.
The idea provides the nagging uneasiness beneath ''The Big Chill,'' the bedrock assumption of television's ''Thirtysomething,'' and the most astute feature of ''Big.


BASEBALL: National League; Expos Get 5 Runs Off Franco in 9th to Beat Reds
LEAD: The Reds' John Franco had given up one home run this season and recorded 23 saves in 26 opportunities.
Then came his appearance against the Expos today.


LONG ISLAND OPINIONPrice of Progress: One Pea Patch
LEAD: THERE used to be a wooded lot on the corner of Route 25A and Norwood Avenue in Northport.
There had been a house there once, years ago, the remnants of its foundation long overgrown with weeds and scrub.
All along the edge of the lot grew sweet peas.


An August Bridal For Helena Potter
LEAD: Announcement of the engagement of Helena Belle Potter to John Bennett Marks, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
John H. Marks of Princeton, N.J., has been made by the prospective bride's parents, Dr. and Mrs.
Robert T. Potter of Plattsburgh, N.Y.
An August wedding is planned.


Chorus in 'Henry V'
LEAD: To the Editor:


Order of the Day at This Inn: Relax
LEAD: TWO dozen miles from olde English Victoria, on the rugged side of Vancouver Island, is tiny Sooke, where the tourist attractions run to towering evergreens and lonesome rocky beaches.


Resolving Fate of New Rochelle's Station
LEAD: A SIGN in the window of the ticket booth at the train station here sums up the state of the building.
Hand-lettered on a piece of cardboard, it used to read, ''No restrooms/Amtrak planning to put them in.'' But after a few months, someone revised it to read, simply, ''No restrooms.''


Cashing In on Rising Health Care Costs
LEAD: Despite the best efforts of insurers and the Federal Government, health care costs continue to rise faster than the gross national product.
That is bad news for the parties paying the bill, but good news for emerging growth companies in the field of medical technology that develop high-tech solutions for use in medical imaging, disease diagnosis and drug delivery.


PASTIMES: Numismatics
LEAD: ''Greenbacks'' were the first United States paper money issued for general circulation and, like a lot of other countries' paper money, they came about because of financial difficulties.

VIOLENCE IN A MAN'S WORLD
LEAD: Last year I received a tearful phone call from a relative, telling me her drunken husband was beating her once again (with small children looking on).
Suddenly, the line went dead.
I was left with the question of what I should do.
Hang up and pretend nothing happened?
Call in the morning to see what injuries she had suffered?


Street Smarts Beyond Rap's Braggadocio
LEAD: From the outside, Rap is a monolith - the sound of booming beats and loudmouthed, tuneless egotists chanting.
But with rap now in its second decade as the music of urban teen-agers (and, increasingly, of suburbanites as well), it is anything but unified.


Peruvian Textiles: Incas' Glowing Heritage
LEAD: WHEN Francisco Pizarro and his conquistadors invaded Peru in 1532, they were amazed to discover warehouses crammed with all manner of textiles.
The Spaniards were also dazzled by the splendor of the cloth, for the Incas, elaborating on 3,000 years of tradition, had produced weavings of exceptional beauty and complexity.

LEAD:  Siberian Miners' Misery
Housing was at the top of the grievance lists of many Siberian miners who started the nationwide strike that has gripped the nation for two weeks.
But many have returned to work disappointed.

Deng's Retirement Plans
Deng Xiaoping has announced in an unpublished speech that he plans to retire, Chinese officials said.


What Kind of House Does $5 Million Buy?
LEAD: A MILLION dollars may not buy what it once did - a baronial estate in the county, for example - but $5 million will still buy something special.
And apparently there are enough affluent buyers about to encourage the speculative construction of multimillion-dollar dwellings.


Honey, They Shrunk the Computer
LEAD: Several companies now offer or are getting ready to offer a generation of portable machines that weigh six pounds or less.


Peter Windett: Graphic Designer
LEAD: Peter Windett, the 43-year-old graphic designer for Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, which sells toiletries and foods in more than 170 shops in 6 countries, is a master of illusion.
He creates instant tradition for new products, just as he did when he dreamed up the name of the company.

James William Hunt of Harvard, Mass., and Boothbay Harbor, Me.


Glibness but No Wit at Art Show
LEAD: It was interesting - and a bit ironic - that Helen Harrison's critique  [ May 28 ]  of the overly abstract Huntington Township Art League show at the Heckscher Museum was illustrated by two definitely nonabstract pieces, one a folk-art joke, in fact.


Gloria M. Hoyal Engaged
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Raymond G. Hoyal of Downey, Calif., have announced September wedding plans for their daughter Gloria M. Hoyal, 26 years old, an associate at Battle Fowler, and Randall Marc Skigen, 32, an associate at Lord Day &amp; Lord, Barrett Smith, both Manhattan law firms.

Tent Made With Flags Set Up in Tompkins Sq.

Echoes in the Courtroom
LEAD: When Bette Midler sings ''Do You Wanna Dance,'' a critic wrote in 1972, her style ''irresistably wraps the vocalist in the seamiest, sexiest voice imaginable.'' Ford bought the rights to the song to use in a commercial for its Mercury Sable, and asked Miss Midler to sing it.
When she refused, Ford's advertising agency,


N.F.L. Defends Player Updates
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


A Davis Cup Setback for U.S.
LEAD: Before their Davis Cup semifinal series against West Germany, the members of the United States squad thought they had the entire scenario figured out.
The recent Wimbledon victory by Boris Becker of West Germany, coupled with the withdrawal of the injured John McEnroe from the American team, meant that both Andre Agassi and Brad Gilbert would have to beat the West German No.


Rome
LEAD: To the Editor: My most recent visit to Rome was marred by an incident at a trattoria.
It's customary to pay more for a meal at restaurants along the Via Veneto and in the Vatican area.
From 3,000 to 4,000 lire (about $2.50 to $3.25) for a cup of coffee or hot chocolate is the going rate, and the prices are usually posted.


Workers Have Indeed United, As if on a Dare by Gorbachev
LEAD: ''ALAS, over the past few years there has been less trade union activity,'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev fairly sighed two years ago in mid-flight through the various rosy challenges he put to the Soviet masses in his book, ''Perestroika.'' Suddenly, as if poor Yorick responded in the grasp of Hamlet, the


Question Of the Week; Should Bo Jackson Give Up One Sport?
LEAD: Personally, I'm getting a bit sick of Bo and all of the hype surrounding him.
What's the big deal?
He's batting .260 and has already struck out 98 times.
He's hardly a Ruben Sierra or a Mike Greenwell, who both don't even get a third of the attention they deserve.
Hitting a home run in an All-Star Game does not make someone Paul Bunyan or a legend.


250 More Jobs at Merrill Lynch Are to Be Moved to New Jersey
LEAD: Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, which announced last month that it would move 2,600 jobs from New York City to Jersey City, is planning to move about 250 more employees to New Jersey, officials inside and outside the finanical company said.


VIOLENCE IN A MAN'S WORLD
LEAD: Katha Pollitt's observations in her article ''Violence in a Man's World'' (Hers, June 18), are chillingly accurate.
Unless it's headline news, violent behavior on the part of males is largely ignored, if not condoned.

Peter J. Garry officiated at St.
Brigid Roman Catholic Church in Peapack, N.J.


FICTION
LEAD:  THE WOMEN WHO WALK.
By Nancy Huddleston Packer. (Louisiana State University, $17.95.) Painted in ''swirls of blood and milk,'' the carefully rendered family studies in Nancy Huddleston Packer's second book of stories examine the quiet violence of everyday life, tracing the emotional tightropes we all learn to walk and the nets we dive into as we fall.


Selling Tools to Biotechnologists
LEAD: Like the merchants who found riches supplying gold miners with picks and shovels, Applied Biosystems Inc. has carved out a profitable niche producing the tools that biotechnology companies use to perform their gene-splicing magic.
Applied Biosystems is the leading maker of biotechnology instruments used for either putting together or taking apart the basic building blocks of life: D.N


FICTION
LEAD:  SHADES OF FORTUNE.
By Stephen Birmingham. (Little, Brown, $18.95.) The ghost of '' 'Our Crowd': The Great Jewish Families of New York'' hovers over Stephen Birmingham's latest novel - not a powerful ghost but an anemic creature quite incapable of breathing life into an improbable story whose banal prose and careless point of view are all the more perplexing because they come from a writer who has, at least in his nonfiction, demonstrated a certain narrative gift.


F.D.R. Drive Closed for Repairs


Food; HOT STUFF
LEAD: As soon as the temperature edges above 80, New Yorkers start clamoring for ice cream.
Out in the Southwest, and other parts of the world where hot has a whole different meaning, they fight fire with fire.
Nothing is as cooling as a hot pepper.

Sunday after Sunday, people all over the country reveled in the magic of Roger Staubach and Bob Hayes and Bob Lilly and Mel Renfro and the other Dallas Cowboys.
The public bought Cowboys shirts and caps and mugs and key rings, and people who knew nothing about the Dallas Cowboys recognized the Dallas Cowboys

Inflation Shows Signs of Easing
LEAD: Inflation eased in June, with consumer prices rising only two-tenths of 1 percent.
That is the smallest increase in 16 months and is sharply lower than the six-tenths of 1 percent rise in May.
Prices of energy and clothing declined in June and food prices were up only modestly.
Still, consumer prices have risen at a 5.9 percent annual rate so far in 1989, the highest six-month rate since 1982.


NONFICTION
LEAD:  POETRY AND THE WORLD.
By Robert Pinsky. (Ecco, $19.95.) Robert Pinsky, who confesses in ''Poetry and the World'' to ''a kind of pitying mistrust toward all literary criticism,'' nonetheless brings his distinguished credentials as a man of letters to bear on that double cosmos of his title.
Academia today requires that a batch of essays like this one - all the pieces have been previously published, in a variety of contexts - insist on its integral status as a book, rather than a collection.


Challenging the Validity of the Bard
LEAD: YES, Edward deVere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, is the actual author of the plays and sonnets ascribed to William Shakespeare.
This is what Thomas J. Layton, a fictitious junior professor and a doctoral candidate in a fictitious American university, tells us - and tells us - in ''All the Queen's Men,'' the numbing play by John Nassivera at the Westport Country


FICTION
LEAD:  OUR GOLDEN IRONBURG: A Novel With Formulas.
By Vassily Aksyonov.
Translated by Ronald E. Peterson. (Ardis, $23.50.) Written in 1972, this energetically satiric novel by Vassily Aksyonov went unpublished in the Soviet Union and saw print in the United States in a Russian edition only after the author immigrated to this country in 1980.


Prussian Attitudes In Sag Harbor
LEAD: Joanne Starkey's review of the American Hotel  [ ''Dining Out,'' May 21 ]  is right on the mark.
Apparently some negative traditions on eastern Long Island are still alive and well.
I can remember going there 10 or 12 years ago and suffering through hours of the staff's pretentious snobbery while choking down a piece of boiled duck smothered in what tasted like canned peas.


A Bookie Named Oregon
LEAD: Short of money but unwilling to let its young people go without, the state of Oregon last week took state-sanctioned gambling another big step, agreeing to make book on pro football games.


The Bulk-for-Benefits Deal in Zoning
LEAD: ALMOST 30 years after New York City rewrote its land-use policies and pioneered a controversial strategy of exchanging zoning bonuses for public amenities, its incentive zoning approach is being buffeted by a fresh round of criticism from public officials and neighborhood advocates.


A RAFT OF CREATURE COMFORTS TO LURE CUSTOMERS AWAY FROM HOME
LEAD: A night at the opera perhaps it wasn't, but going to the movies was definitely a classy night out back when theaters were ''palaces'' and the movies were, well, operatic.


Quinones Released
LEAD: The Pittsburgh Pirates released Rey Quinones, their starting shortstop, yesterday, only three months after trading a starting pitcher and two of their top minor league prospects for him.
The Pirates acquired Quinones from Seattle on April 21, along Bill Wilkinson, a minor league pitcher, in exchange for Mike Dunne, a 13-game winner in 1987; Mark Merchant, an outfielder, and Mike


On the Second Shift
LEAD: To the Editor:


Benefit Parties Take to Water For the Summer
LEAD: Last week the charity circuit abandoned its hotel ballrooms for yachts and cruise boats in the harbor.

T. F. Doyle Wed To Miss Mackie
LEAD: Shevaun Maria Elizabeth Mackie, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Robert A. Mackie of Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Groton Long Point, Conn., was married yesterday in Irvington-on-Hudson to Thomas Frederick Doyle, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
William J. Doyle of West Falmouth, Mass.
The Rev.
Timothy J. Scannell officiated at the Roman Catholic Church of the Immaculate


Range of Options For Child Care
LEAD: I am responding to a misleading statement that appeared in a letter to the editor regarding employer-supported child care  [ ''Child Care Centers at Stony Brook,'' June 11 ] .
While it is true that there are a limited number of child care centers with a limited number of openings, there are other choices for parents and employers.

Lauder's Mayoral Campaign Is a Bonanza for Consultants
LEAD: Ronald Lauder's mayoral campaign, which has spent a record $8.5 million so far, has been a bonanza for campaign consultants across the nation in general and for the allies of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in particular.


The Government Is Hiring, Which Isn't Easy  It's Loneliest At the Top of The Bureaucracy
LEAD: THE 1980's have not been kind to civil servants, and some people say the Federal work force is taking revenge by falling apart.
President Bush, the first President in a dozen years who did not campaign against the bureaucracy, responded this month by proposing pay raises for political appointees and a few hundred specialists in the Civil Service.


Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''We couldn't keep saying, 'Don't have an abortion, but you're on your own.' We had to put our money where our mouths were.''  - Betsy Powell,  a Right to Life official.  [ 1:2. ]


HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES
LEAD:  CLASSICAL  American Songs: Works by Paul Bowles, Lee Hoiby, Richard Hundley, Eric Klein, John Musto and Virgil Thomson  William Sharp, baritone; Steven Blier, piano.
New World NW 369; CD and LP.
Lovers of the American art song have had a good year - first Jan DeGaetani's stunning ''Songs of America'' (Nonesuch 79178) and now this.


For Polish Film, a Mood of Cautious Optimism
LEAD: Among the numerous posters on the streets of Warsaw urging Poles to vote for Solidarity's candidates in the elections last month, one was particularly striking: in the middle of the bold red letters that spell out ''Solidarnosc'' was the vertical image of Gary Cooper as the sheriff in ''High Noon.


STREETSCAPES: The McAlpin Marine Grill; The Fate of a Polychrome Grotto Hangs in Balance
LEAD: IT'S one of the most unusual interiors in New York City - an expansive grotto of flowing, polychrome terra cotta.
The 1912 Marine Grill in the old Hotel McAlpin at the southeast corner of 34th Street and Avenue of the Americas was developing a cult following among architectural historians and preservationists.


Melinda R. Stolley To Wed Musician

LEAD: EVERY evening Johnny Michaels, the program director at WWYZ in Hartford, brings home stacks of letters from listeners responding to the station's new country music format and reads them while he relaxes in front of the television.

An August wedding is planned.


Stanley Goes Global: Profits and Problems
LEAD: Stanley Works, an old-line New England toolmaker best known for its saws and tape measures, has become a global company in recent years, illustrating the extent to which globalization of manufacturing is reaching into the grass roots.


As the U.S. Gives and Takes, A Rise in the Regional Deficit
LEAD: EACH year for the past 12, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, has released a study of how the states fare in their balance of payments with the Federal Government; that is, how much each state's citizens pay in taxes compared with how much Federal money they get.
In the 1988 fiscal year, he said, the Government collected $71 billion more than it returned -an average of $291 for each

Waterfront Transit Plan Questioned
LEAD: WHEN Gov.
Thomas H. Kean announced a $2.5 billion transportation plan for the Hudson River waterfront in late June, the proposal sounded very much like a $1 billion plan he proposed in 1985.

New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: It goes without saying that $53.9 million (van Gogh's ''Irises''), $47.9 million (Picasso's ''Yo'' self-portrait) and $39.9 million (van Gogh's ''Sunflowers'') are slightly beyond most budgets and, in fact, almost beyond comprehension.

Review/Dance; 'Bayadere' Third Act With New Kirov Leads
LEAD: New York dance audiences have seen their share of productions of the ''Kingdom of the Shades'' scene from ''La Bayadere'' since the Kirov Ballet brought the excerpt from the Petipa ballet to the West early in the 1960's.

FICTION
LEAD:  MY FATHER IN DREAMS.
By C. E. Poverman. (Scribners, $22.50.) C. E. Poverman's fourth book of fiction is not a novel so much as a series of short stories that lurches around the narcissistic Jed Hartwick and his equally unlikable family and friends.
The emotionally parasitic Jed and these other unsympathetic characters - manic-depressives, obsessive-compulsives and silent sociopaths - inflict physical and emotional pain on themselves and one another.


Prospects; Candor From The Fed

CBS HAS WON THE WORLD SERIES......NOW IT COULD LOSE ITS SHIRT
LEAD: SINCE THE GAME OF BASE-ball is our national pastime, the making of money our civil religion, and the watching of television our communal opiate, it follows that putting baseball on television is a very big business.

Fashion; Paris Couture Today Get Ready for Surprises
LEAD: Consistency is certainly not a characteristic of fashion.
As the fall 1989 Paris couture week neared, it seemed a capital idea to anticipate what the most important designers would show, with examples from their already completed fall ready-to-wear collections.
Wrong.
Caught by fax or phone, six out of seven of them indicated that, in shows starting today, they were pursuing directions other than the ones shown here.

Tax Villain: Municipal Unions
LEAD: In the ode to County Executive Patrick G. Halpin entitled ''To Quell Revolt, Halpin Pledges No Tax Increase'' (July 2), any Republican mentioned in the article was cast in the most negative light.

LEAD: The art dealer brought the small double-sided drawing, only 3 by 4 inches, to Christie's in New York, saying he was acting for a friend and did not know what the artwork was.

Derby Fare
LEAD: To the Editor: Regarding the article on mint juleps and Derby-Pie (''The Favorite at Churchill Downs: Derby-Pie,'' Travel, April 30), may I point out that Henry Clay died in 1852?

There are orchestral programs, opera, musical comedy, solo recitals, chamber music and more.


LOBBYING TO FIGHT TAXES AND HIGHER WAGES
LEAD: A 10-cent tax on the admission price to a local movie house may not seem like much.
But add to it a possible salary increase for the staff of high-school students who work at theaters and major capital expenditures to make cinemas accessible to the disabled and you have an appreciably higher-priced admission ticket.


Safe Use of Extension Ladders
LEAD: LADDERS are almost always necessary when working on a home's exterior.
Usually, the type needed is an extension ladder.
These consist of two straight sections, one of which can be slid upward and hooked near the end of the other to form a single long length.

Works in Progress;  From the Ground Up, Warily
LEAD: &gt;TEN MILES EAST OF SPITAK, the Armenian town closest to the epicenter of last December's cataclysmic earthquake, the city of Kirovakan still has a skyline.
All 100 or so of the 9- and 10-story apartment buildings there remain erect.
Meanwhile, in Leninakan, 30 miles west of Spitak, most of the equivalent structures were leveled by the quake (right) or damaged beyond repair and demolished.


Danny DeVito Paints an American Gothic
LEAD: Michael Douglas is a mess.
His face is sweaty and unshaven, his greasy hair unkempt, and his expensive shirt looks as if Smokey the Bear used it as a pajama top.
In his hand is a menacing automobile crank and on his face a look of the purest malevolence. ''Divorce,'' he says evenly, ''is a bitch.''


Rolling Stones Gather Curiosity
LEAD: In Washington, First Selectman Alan J. Chapin has lost count of the number of reporters who have come to town to interview him in the last week or so.


THE EDUCATION OF DAN QUAYLE
LEAD: Now I see why George Bush feels entitled to be called the education President - he is allowing us to finance ''The Education of Dan Quayle'' (by Maureen Dowd, June 25).
This scholarship program includes private tutors, a modest mansion within walking distance of an exclusive house, a personal jet for exotic field trips and a ''grant'' considerably more generous than Mr.


Teaching Teachers to Teach the Arts
LEAD: The term ''Arts Education'' is often suspect, conjuring images of boring slide presentations and droning lecturers in an auditorium full of uninterested and unruly third graders.
But the Lincoln Center Institute for the Arts in Education takes a different approach, one that evolved after nearly a decade of trial and error.


BASEBALL: American League; Canseco Belts Another As Orioles Fall Again

Mark Mendel of Radnor, Pa., and Aspen, Colo.


Rodeos
LEAD: To the Editor: The Sundance Kid did not pair up with Butch Cassidy until the early 1890's and most certainly did not participate in the June 24, 1889, holdup of the San Miguel Valley Bank in Telluride, Colo. (''Cowboy Decor, in Boot, Spur and Horn'' by Dyan Zaslowsky, Travel, June 18).
According to most accounts, Butch Cassidy, Matt Warner, Tom McCarty and Bert Madden robbed the bank while several accomplices, including Cassidy's brother, Dan Parker, secured relay horses outside of town.


A Novel Test for an Old Soviet Industry
LEAD: The promise of a planned economy, whatever its shortcomings, is the security of a certain orderliness.
But since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power four years ago, Vladimir A. Yamnikov, the stocky 49-year-old manager of the Kristall vodka distillery here, has found security in short supply.
Instead, he has had to deal with the turbulence typically found in unruly free-market economies.


Review/Music; Camerata Koln, at the Frick
LEAD: At the Frick Collection on Wednesday afternoon, the Camerata Koln played a number of 18th-century styles using the same 18th-century instruments.
On the surface of it, a fundamental premise of the early-music movement would appear to have been breached - the precise matching of historical instruments to precise moments in history.


D. C. Oakley Wed To Miss Brennan
LEAD: Eileen Mary Brennan, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Donald P. Brennan of Old Brookville and Cutchogue, L.I., was married yesterday to Daniel Charles Oakley, a son of Dr. and Mrs.

Enjoy Fresh Tomatoes While They're Abundant
LEAD: TOMATO sandwiches were one of my favorite summer treats when I was growing up in England.
They were made with brown bread and butter, and tomatoes from the garden that were still warm from the sun.
We ate them sprinkled with a little salt for teatime and had hot tea, which we drank even on the hottest of days because my grandfather said that no drink was more cooling.


International Flavor Adds Zest to London Festival
LEAD: Beyond the appetite here for American exports - which produced the well-timed July 4 opening of ''Anything Goes,'' and continues unabated - London's theatrical life has taken an international turn of late.
Such imported fare is traditional at the Edinburgh International Festival, which occasionally sends its best offerings south for further exposure.


Traveler's Checks
LEAD: To the Editor: My wife lost her MasterCard in Argentina, probably in Buenos Aires, but didn't notice the loss until checking in at a hotel in Puerto Iguazu.
It was late in the day and we weren't able to reach MasterCard's representative bank in town.
But banks in Puerto Iguazu open at 6 A.M., and we were there when it opened only to be told that the lost card would have to be reported to MasterCard's office in Buenos Aires.

Review/Rock; Zvuki Mu, Residents: Double Bill
LEAD: The Residents, from San Francisco, and Zvuki Mu, from Moscow, made a smart pairing for a Serious Fun program Friday night at Alice Tully Hall.
Both bands view rock skeptically, from a distance - a geographical one for Zvuki Mu, an artistic one for the Residents.
Both write songs that pile up terse riffs to grate against each other in well-planned dissonance.

The Eastern Seaboard, Connecticut, the Housatonic River Valley - all a world of rain.


FASHION: On the Street; No, You Don't Need Ear Lobes Of Steel

The Long Way To Outer Space
LEAD: THE tableau on the Postal Service's new $2.40 Priority Mail stamp is oddly reminiscent of the landing at Iwo Jima: two men, in this case astronauts not marines, plant an unwaving Stars and Stripes on alien territory, the airless desolation of the Moon.


Never Too Early for Cuomo Not To Throw His Hat in the Ring

PASTIMES: Camera
LEAD: One of the reasons professional photographers have been slow to adopt all-automatic cameras has to do with personality.

A Remedy Worse Than the Problem
LEAD: The insider-trading scandals that have rocked Wall Street have made it politically popular to increase the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement powers.
But expanding the powers of government over the affairs of business is always a dangerous proposition.
Therefore, the S.E.C.'s latest proposal to expand its powers should be carefully weighed.


Safe Use of Extension Ladders

The Thoroughbred Called Deauville
LEAD: ON a visit from Paris to his native Normandy, the artist Eugene Boudin was recaptured by the loveliness of the province.

Learning and Testing: The State's Role
LEAD: I hope it is not too late to heed the warning implicit in Andrew Dunn's June 11 Opinion article, ''Test on Skills Is Warped.''

S&amp;L Solutions
LEAD: To the Editor:


TALKING: Selling; Strategies For a Slow Market
LEAD: IN parts of the nation where the real estate market had been booming for as long as most people can remember, many find it intolerable to sell a home at a loss - or even to take a lower price than a neighbor took for a similar house two years ago.
But that is what often happens lately, as the rising number of ''for sale'' signs, prolific and stubborn as weeds, seem to beckon fewer and fewer buyers.


Indian Pudding, a Yankee Indulgence
LEAD: AT its richest a deep reddish gold, Indian pudding is the color of its cornmeal, darkened with molasses and hours of baking.

It is belated because


The Institution as Impresario
LEAD: Something fundamental has changed in the way classical music performances reach the concert hall.

Design; The GAZEBO
LEAD: Gazebos may seem like frivolous little garden ornaments, but they are actually quite practical structures, a fact landscape designers discovered centuries ago.
Not only does a gazebo serve as a focal point - a small charming building to be looked at from afar - it also provides shelter - a place to escape to in the rain or a perch where one can read or simply look out and enjoy the view.

Developer Has An Interest Too
LEAD: In his article May 28, Mr.
Pilevsky claims special interests ''distort reality'' in our region; yet as a developer himself he certainly has a special interest.

Question Of the Week; Should Bo Jackson Give Up One Sport?

LEAD: In spring training, Buck Rodgers, manager of the Montreal Expos, boasted that his team had as good a corps of starting pitchers as the Mets.

Corrections

LEAD: THE new Oregon lottery based on the outcomes of National Football League games may have drawn protests from the N.F.L. last week, but those familiar with the Oregon scheme say the league's complaints are likely to do little more than draw attention to the new game and spur its adoption by other states.

A Literary Corner Of Cornwall
LEAD: ROBERT BRIDGES, the Poet Laureate in King George V's day, called Fowey, in Cornwall, ''the most poetic-looking town in England.''

Judith Kogan, a lawyer and harpist who graduated from Juilliard, tells of cutthroat competition at her alma mater.

LEAD: WHEN the Waterford Public Library agreed to be the repository of documents for the Millstone I nuclear energy plant 18 years ago, it was a matter of storing just a few file boxes in a closet.

On a Desolate Beach in Queens, a Point of Departure
LEAD: If there could be any doubt that the common wisdom about how large-scale housing developments are made in this country has changed, a look at the latest proposal for a very large housing complex in New York City, a plan for 10,000 units in the Arverne area of Queens, should dispel it.
If it goes ahead, the Arverne project will be the largest single housing development in New York since Co-op City in the

Question Of the Week; Should Bo Jackson Give Up One Sport?
LEAD: Bo Jackson's feats of derring-do have convinced me beyond the shadow of a doubt that he should not give up one sport.
The fact that he might be burned out within 5 or maybe 10 years is not relevant.
If he manages two incomes with prudence, he will be financially secure for the rest of his life.


Angola Talks Suspended
LEAD: Talks aimed at ending the Angolan civil war were suspended today when the rebel delegation requested consultations with their leaders, according to news reports.
According to reports in Kinshasa, Zaire, where the talks are being held, the negotiations are to resume July 31.


Enjoy Fresh Tomatoes While They're Abundant
LEAD: TOMATO sandwiches were one of my favorite summer treats when I was growing up in England.
They were made with brown bread and butter, and tomatoes from the garden that were still warm from the sun.
We ate them sprinkled with a little salt for teatime and had hot tea, which we drank even on the hottest of days because my grandfather said that no drink was more cooling.


Williams's Camp Criticizes Referee
LEAD: The consequences of one referee's decision continued to be the subject of debate a day after Mike Tyson retained his heavyweight title by stopping Carl (the Truth) Williams just 93 seconds into their scheduled 12-round bout Friday night.


Safe Use of Extension Ladders
LEAD: LADDERS are almost always necessary when working on a home's exterior.
Usually, the type needed is an extension ladder.
These consist of two straight sections, one of which can be slid upward and hooked near the end of the other to form a single long length.


Church Must Look at Causes of Clergy Shortage; Beginning of the End
LEAD: To the Editor:


Shoreham Error: Building It at All
LEAD: The mistake of Shoreham is not dismantling the plant (''Shoreham Set for New Arena,'' July 9).
The mistake was bulding it in the first place.


In Today's Election, Japan's Ruling Elite Faces a Fed-Up People
LEAD: DURING a generation of command over Japan's political system, the Liberal Democratic Party became accustomed to a world in which few bothered to wonder what it would be like if someone else were in power.
But with Japanese voters increasingly irate and impatient, the party has approached the national election today with the enthusiasm of a man contemplating his own hanging.


An Avalanche of Information Is Coming to Video Screens
LEAD: AS the computer screen rivals the printed page as a way of publishing information, readers may have to get used to stranger things than electronic newspapers.

CAMPUS LIFE: Texas; Bat Enrollment Adds to Mystique Of 'Batman' Fever
LEAD: Although the University of Texas boasts the nation's second-largest college enrollment, another population - one that comes out only at night - may be outnumbering the students.


GREETINGS AND SALUTATIONS
LEAD: ''Greetings is a salutary salutation'' to introduce a business letter, writes William Safire in ''The Mulvihill Perplexity'' (On Language, June 25).
Omigod!
It's plain to see that Mr.
Safire never received that famous little card from Uncle Sam saying, ''I want YOU!'' To men of a certain age, greetings is the most traumatic word in the English language.


Rodeos
LEAD: To the Editor: I was dismayed to see you promoting rodeos (Travel, June 18).
You must know the cruelty involved.
One picture shows clearly the tight belt around the bull's abdomen, put on by the trainers to pain him so much that he will try to unseat the rider.
The text says this is the most dangerous ride; how about danger to the bull?

Review/Theater; Maria Tucci in 'The Rose Tattoo'
LEAD: Perhaps the most exacting measure of a playwright's enduring place in dramatic literature is the scrutiny of time on the writer's secondary works.
Even in the critical and commercial decline of his later years, the masterpieces of Tennessee Williams were never questioned.
Now, six years after his death, revivals of some of the second-rank plays, like ''Night of the Iguana'' and ''Orpheus Descending,'' serve as a testament to the abiding power of


Review/Film; A Droll Buddy Who Drools And Eats a Stereo Speaker
LEAD: ''Turner and Hooch'' is yet another mismatched-buddy movie, only this time the fussy partner is played by Tom Hanks and the slobby partner by someone who truly slobbers.

LEAD: The House Judiciary Committee today approved legislation intended to outlaw flag burning, setting off a partisan scramble as Republicans complained of being steamrolled and insisted that a constitutional amendment was essential to protect the flag.


The Helms Process
LEAD: It looked like another Parade of Yahoos: Led by Senator Jesse Helms, the Senate Wednesday inveighed against ''obscene or indecent'' art.
Shades of ''Madame Bovary'' or ''Tropic of Cancer'' or ''I Am Curious - Yellow.'' But the question here is harder than whether politicians should censor art.
It's whether public funds should subsidize art that offends public taste.

If Jason, the hockey-masked killer, sauntered through Times Square, would anyone notice?
Would he be even a little conspicuous on the subway?
Of course not.
And that's the arch premise ''Friday the 13th Part VIII - Jason Takes Manhattan'' is advertising.
In a television commercial for the film, a teen-age couple rushes into a coffee shop and the young woman yells, ''There's a maniac trying to kill us!'' The waitress, who can spot tourists blocks away, drawls, ''Welcome to New Yawk.''
Now for some truth in advertising.
That smart, witty scene has almost nothing to do with the rest of the film.
Most of this story takes place on a cruise ship bound for New York, and much of the Lakeview High senior class is wiped out at sea in all the usual ways. (Jason prefers variations on stabbing with a nice, cheap ax, but he'll resort to electrocution when the budget allows.) Five characters in a little lifeboat row to New York unforgivably close to the movie's end.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT/VIDEO: AND KEEP IN MIND
LEAD: Here are some of the most notable releases of the last few months.
BIRD - In a psychological character study of remarkable complexity, directed by Clint Eastwood, Forest Whitaker plays the saxophonist Charlie Parker as a kind of big brilliant baby.
Drenched in great music, the film ''may be long, messy, and a bit drab-looking, but it is still one of the two or three most powerful jazz-oriented features ever produced.


Some Thoughts On Wimbledon
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


There's H.U.D. Where's Justice?

In the 11 years since, practically all of the nation's Olympians have competed in a festival and many achieved their first fame before festival crowds.


Ringing in the Year With a Murder
LEAD: ACCORDING to the plot of Bob Barry's ''Murder Among Friends,'' currently at the BayWay Arts Center in East Islip, one way of celebrating the new year is by murdering your narcissistic husband.
Or perhaps your fabulously wealthy wife.
Or maybe your virile young lover.
The one sure thing in this lightweight thriller is that someone is indeed murdered.


Libby Ginway And a Doctor To Wed in '90
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
John R. Ginway of Lake Forest, Ill., and Mantoloking, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Mary Elizabeth Ginway, to Dr.

The Ordinary Miracle
LEAD: FOR nine months, my body was preparing another human being for life.
For nine months, I was preparing myself for the ordinary miracle of birth.
I made sugar a stranger, emasculated my daily cup of coffee by ordering decaffeinated, and blacklisted alcohol.
I stopped working 12 hour days and learned to putter.


Gnats, Ticks, Time and Happiness
LEAD: IT is almost August.
The locals say a wet spring has spawned the enormous clouds of gnats, and when you're not fanning them away from your face, you're checking your ankles for ticks.
You are 80 miles from home, living temporarily in the Hamptons, in a cottage that smells of mold, Lysol and low tide.

In Latin America, Headlines Inspire The Drama
LEAD: For the Latin American theater, the headlines on today's front page have become as rich a source of inspiration as the hallowed classics of Lope de Vega or Garcia Lorca.
Exile, revolution, political repression, the foreign debt and drug trafficking are themes that are increasingly capturing the imagination of Latin American playwrights and directors, and it is precisely those concerns that permeate the works that will be performed at the monthlong Festival Latino at the Public Theater in New York, which begins this week.


Not Too Contrite
LEAD: After his little meeting with Bill White, the National League president, about some intemperate remarks he had made about a couple of umpires after a costly questionable call in a game against the Astros in Houston, Nick Leyva, the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, couldn't have been more contrite.


Rutherford Journal; Sale of Houses by College Strains Relations With Town
LEAD: LOCAL lore has it that the last time residents of this tree-lined suburb questioned the benefit of having a college campus in town, the president of Fairleigh Dickinson University paid the employees' salaries in silver dollars.
Shortly afterward, many of the coins began to appear in local merchants' cash registers, a subtle but convincing reminder that the school was indeed a good neighbor.


Scaling New Heights
LEAD: In 1982, while climbing Gables Peak near Yosemite National Park in California, Mark Wellman fell 50 feet and was left paralyzed from the waist down.
Last week, Mr.
Wellman, accompanied by a friend, became the first paraplegic to conquer Yosemite's challenging El Capitan.

LEAD: The box score shows that the winning pitcher in the Athletics' 8-7 victory over the Seattle Mariners in Oakland on Friday night was Todd Burns.

Review/Music; Diverse Triple Bill for Serious Fun
LEAD: Recent works by Lucia Hwong, Scott Johnson and Anthony Davis were presented in a Serious Fun triple bill on Wednesday evening at Alice Tully Hall.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Review/Theater; A Harbach Musical From 1910
LEAD: The Manhattan dance studio that is the setting for the first act of the Otto Harbach-Karl Hoschna musical ''Madame Sherry'' is a place where twittery socialities play at being budding Isadora Duncans.
In ''Aesthetic Dancing/Every Little Movement,'' the opening number of the Goodspeed Opera House's glowing revival of the 1910 show, half a dozen students waft about the stage, their chiffon-draped arms spread like giant butterfly wings in an interpretive dance that looks at once silly and sensuous.


Hotel Chains Plunge Into Life-Care Field
LEAD: ''OF the current 65-plus American market,'' said Brian Swinton, leaning over the starched table linen and shimmering stemware in the dining room of the Quadrangle, the Marriott Corporation's new retirement development in Haverford, Pa., ''81 percent own their own home, 64 percent without a mortgage.

LEAD: In a mission to enhance cooperation between the superpowers, two MIG jet fighters will be escorted over the United States next month on their way to a Canadian air show.


Homecoming
LEAD: To the Editor: One is thankful for the many visitors from other ethnic backgrounds whose sensitive response to things Italian more than makes up for the obtuseness of most of one's fellow Italians.
Under the shock of discovering that their fathers were not born in a palace or in a split level, they are known to flee in despair not just from the ancestral huts but from the uneven pavement of Piazza San Marco, from the stinking Venetian canals and the oppressive Roman forum, eager only to take refuge in Ozone Park or Scranton or


Correction
LEAD: A picture caption in some copies last Sunday, about Israel's allowing Palestinian students to return to school, misstated the day that classes resumed.
It was Saturday, July 22.


Keeping The Deepest Secret of All
LEAD: AS a child, I found it very hard to keep secrets, especially if they were happy secrets.
A surprise party.
Or a very special present.
Or a special someone coming to visit.
Serious secrets were another thing.
I didn't like serious secrets.
I didn't like knowing that something not too good was about to happen.

Italy's Endangered Treasures
LEAD: ON the morning of March 18, without any warning, the massive Civic Tower of Pavia collapsed; it had for nearly 1,000 years risen at the center of the ancient and illustrious city near Milan.

Soviet Business Consultants Sharpen Hammer and Sickle
LEAD: He is 31 years old, he drives a pricey imported car, his tastes in clothing run to European-cut suits and yellow ''power'' ties, and his notion of a fringe benefit is paying tennis-court fees for his staff.
Aleksandr I. Rubtsov is the Soviet equivalent of a young urban professional, a private management consultant in a country where the very concept of such a job would until recently have been alien.


Wayward Pilot Convalescing

SELLING A 'LIFE-STYLE' AT ONE-STOP FURNITURE SHOPSZ
LEAD: The convenience demanded by young, dual-career couples is the driving force behind the boom in one-stop furniture shops, referred to as life-style stores. ''We are seemingly too lazy to do our own homework and we want to see everything at once, down to the napkin holders,'' said Mr.
Brackett of the furniture manufacturers association.


Tone Down The Rhetoric
LEAD: Two recent articles about the issues raised by the cancellation of the Robert Mapplethorpe photography exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington - Hilton Kramer's ''Is Art Above the Laws of Decency? (July 2) and Grace Glueck's ''Art on the Firing Line'' (July 9) - have prompted an unusually large number of letters from readers.


Children Alone
LEAD: To the Editor: The article on children traveling alone (Practical Traveler, June 11) left out directions on where a child can get help if things go wrong.
In olden times at major railroad stations there were the conspicuously marked offices of the Travelers' Aid Society.
Unfortunately today, even where such facilities exist, adequate signs are missing at most airports.

GERMANY AND THE WALL
LEAD: In his article ''If the Wall Came Tumbling Down'' (June 25), Peter Schneider concludes that, as Dr.

Why A.T.&amp; T. and Intel Linked Up
LEAD: The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has not been able to capitalize on its networking and telecommunications expertise in the business computer market.
It has sold personal computers under the A.T.&amp; T. label since 1984, but both the sales and the technology of the machines have been disappointing.


FILM
Translated From the Yiddish by Paul Mazursky ''Do this one now!
For the Gipper!'' boomed Paul Mazursky in his foghorn voice.
At his cue, Ron Silver and Anjelica Huston began strolling past Leibel Bistritzky's Kosher Gourmet Foods on Essex Street between Grand and Hester on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
A Panavision camera on a remote-controlled crane followed the actors as they ambled past carts full of vegetables, knishes and steaming roasted peanuts on a street crowded with women in babushkas and Hasidim in broad-brimmed velvet hats.
More than 200 sweating actors, extras and crew members toiled in the shimmering heat to give the scene the look and sound of the 1949 street envisioned by Isaac Bashevis Singer in his novel, ''Enemies, a Love Story.'' Mr.
Silver, wearing a postwar beige suit and a brown felt fedora, paused in front of a herring vendor and looked meaningfully at Ms.
Huston.


Balancing Video Ratings And Artwork
LEAD: What sights should you and your children have to endure in a video store?
For a young medium that many still associate with pornography and violence, often pictured on lurid cassette boxes, this is a contentious topic at a time when state and local governments are increasingly being urged to regulate store content.


PASTIMES: Numismatics
LEAD: Usually we forget about small change.
And why not?
Pennies, nickles and dimes agglomerate in ashtrays and jelly glasses.
If someone gives us lots of change instead of bills, we're almost insulted.


A Greek Island of Space and Light
LEAD: IN the spring of 1945, the poet and novelist Lawrence Durrell arrived on Rhodes with a British occupation force.
The war in Europe had just ended and the island's main harbor was still full of German mines.
Durrell, ''speechless with gratitude'' upon taking his first swim in the blue Aegean, realized that ''space, light and solitude will have to be rediscovered again here, in all their ramifications.

Hers; A Wake-Up Call
LEAD: IT IS USUAL FOR ME TO fall asleep before my husband does.
It is also usual for him to be watching television until he feels like falling asleep, too.
Normally, this doesn't bother me.
I am used to it; in fact, Ted Koppel's intelligent-sounding voice has become my adult lullaby.
But last night, I was awakened by a voice talking about where to hide missiles.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  FIRE &amp; FEAR: The Inside Story of Mike Tyson.
By Jose Torres. (Warner Books, $16.95.) The prepublication hoo-ha surrounding ''Fire &amp; Fear'' - concerning the heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson's alleged pleasure in beating his sex partners, especially his former wife, the actress Robin Givens - focuses on but a throwaway passage in this otherwise insightful book about the brutishness of the modern professional boxing game and those who are drawn to it.

(July 2) and Grace Glueck's ''Art on the Firing Line'' (July 9) - have prompted an unusually large number of letters from readers.


FASHION: On the Street; Just for Fun: Summer Hats
LEAD: The summer hat means portable shade and a special opportunity to be whimsical.
History shows that the hat was designed to protect and to display social position and wealth.
Then it became an integral part of fashion.
And then it all but disappeared.
But hats are being worn again, especially in summer, and often just for fun.


Homemade Tapes Can Be the Life (or Death) of the Party
LEAD: Sooner or later, a rock critic has to put up or shut up.
For me, that time is pre-party time, when the host, with a nod toward my ever-vaster record collection, asks me to make a dance tape or two. ''Sure, no problem,'' I say, with mounting dread.
An awesome responsibility has been placed in my hands.


Food; Skillet Skills
LEAD: I had recently arrived in this country from Barcelona and was about to go with friends on my first camping trip.
We spent days shopping for the right equipment: a pup tent that we'd use for a kitchen, a butane stove and a camping toaster, among other things.
After setting out, we saw several signs for tag sales, a concept we foreigners couldn't understand.

Decoys That Lure Collectors
LEAD: IN a good season in Canada (and the fall of 1876 was a good season) the hunter and decoy carver George Warin could shoot 824 ducks during their annual migration.
The Migratory Birds Convention Act of 1917 ended carnage on that scale, but thousands of duck decoys - the market hunters' essential tools - remain from those days.

LEAD: Pamela Schneider found something amiss amid the usual vigorous clatter of crockery and cutlery that accompanies meals at summer camps.


LIFE STYLE: Sunday Brunch; Summery Tomatoes With Fish
LEAD: At this time of year it's impossible to find enough ways to use the sweetly acidic tomatoes of summer.
The tomato cilantro vinaigrette would be excellent with any strong-flavored fish and, if your tastes run to oily fish like mackerel or bluefish, it provides a refreshing foil.


Luxury Features In Midprice Decks
LEAD: Cassettes, it is widely unremarked, are by far the world's most popular music medium.
Avid audio fans turn their attention to hotter topics, such as technical disputes about digital decoding, or the seemingly endless political tangles of DAT (digital audio tape) that have kept this superior method of home recording from gaining a foothold in this country.

What could be better than being constantly underwater, borne by cool currents, feasting on colorful algae and, of course, smaller fish?


Spending, Politics And Darman's Slap at The Profligate American
LEAD: JUST what is Richard G. Darman up to?
Mr.
Darman is President Bush's budget director, but this month he put in a strong bid to be the Administration's Big Thinker as well.
In an address to the National Press Club, he offered both an overarching theme for the Bush Administration's endeavors and a warning that Americans are ''robbing the future to give to the present'' in an orgy of what he called ''cultural now-now-ism.


Mississippi Is Ordered to Open Its Anti-Rights Files

Deutsche Bank's Bigger Reach
LEAD: ''Almighty Supreme Being,'' the West German press often calls him.


Legacy of Modern Times, an L.I. Utopia
LEAD: THE yellow octagonal building with vertical clapboard siding looks like a mini-circus tent.
Brentwood's first schoolhouse, in use from 1857 to 1907, and the objective of preservationists, is hardly a typical little red schoolhouse.
But, then, the people who built it were hardly typical.

The Outlook for Weather Forecasting
LEAD: OVER the last three decades, the accuracy of short-term weather forecasts in the United States has about doubled, thanks to computers, satellites and radar.

Patrick Frey: Fabric and Accessories Designer
LEAD: Twenty years ago, when Patrick Frey was working in New York as a trainee at Brunschwig &amp; Fils, the textile company, he wrote to his father in Paris that he was very happy and wanted to stay here.

L.A. FIGHTS FOR BREATH
LEAD: THE POLITICIAN HAD JUST DESCRIBED HOW the new master plan to cleanse the grimy air over metropolitan Los Angeles imperils industry.

The Palm House Returns After a Disappearing Act
LEAD: For architectural purists, few events this season have equaled in impact the brief opening in London of the newly renovated Palm House at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew.

LIFE STYLE: Sunday Outing; In Mystic, Heritage Of the Sea Lives On
LEAD: When Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall honeymooned in the coastal New England community of Mystic in the 1940's, the quiet village had little more than a few shops and a small museum as its attractions.
Fifty years later, Mystic has become a tourist net, drawing more than a million visitors a year to the seaport, aquarium and shopping districts.


Munich
LEAD: To the Editor: ''What's Doing in Munich'' (Travel, June 4) was excellent, but, as in reports on Rome, Florence and Venice, you tell the reader about Europe on $500 a day per person, not how to enjoy it on $100 a day - a couple, as my wife and I always have managed.
Especially in Munich you can eat excellently under $10 a person; just look for the crowded restaurants where the residents eat.

LEAD: A potent mix of personal and bureaucratic ambitions is driving the Bush Administration to undertake a major expansion of manned exploration of the solar system, Government officials and private experts say.


Note to Posterity On Measuring Real Success

Terrell will be a plus.


Croquet Memories, With Harpo Marx
LEAD: IN the spring my husband and I put in a croquet court at our North Haven home.
The zoning laws of North Haven call for two acres per home, so we had plenty of room for a championship-size court - 105 feet by 84 feet.
We measured space, cleared brush, sowed grass seed and bought a top-of-the-line Jacques croquet set, imported from

LEAD: THE old gentleman's garden, a tightly planted crazy quilt of red, yellow, orange, pink and purple, always reminded me of my college economics professor.


Repairing Casement Windows
LEAD: CASEMENT windows, which open and close by pivoting on hinges, generally develop fewer problems than double-hung windows, whose two sashes slide in channels.

PASTIMES: Stamps
LEAD: Pigeon posts have been known for centuries.
They were usually set up to replace communications cut by war: When Antony besieged Brutus at Modena, Pliny the historian says, Brutus used carrier pigeons to get news to the Romans.

Repairing Casement Windows
LEAD: CASEMENT windows, which open and close by pivoting on hinges, generally develop fewer problems than double-hung windows, whose two sashes slide in channels.
But casement windows can become hard to close because of insufficient lubrication, dirt-clogged parts, or a worn crank.
Usually, casement windows are easy to repair and can be done from inside.

Question Of the Week; Are Yanks Making The Right Moves?
LEAD: Unquestionably, the Yankees are making all the right moves.
Why, just last week Syd Thrift and Dallas Green showed us again how shrewd they are by trading Mike Pagliarulo.
Everybody knows that Pags was a liability and a drain on team spirit.
Of course, it may not be apparent just yet that all of the Yankees' moves are the right ones.


Simple Place in a Sophisticated Spot
LEAD: EVERY year, residents from the Moriches to Montauk spend long summer evenings grumbling about the local restaurants: the crowds, the green summer service staffs, and the talented chefs who departed with last winter's first chilly blast.

By Sara M. Evans and Barbara J. Nelson.  224 pp.

When Film Becomes a Feast of Words
LEAD: Part of this memory is vague, and part exceptionally clear.
Several years ago, in a ''Letter From Paris'' in The New Yorker, the journalist Jane Kramer made an offhand remark that seemed to hold an essential truth.
The precise subject was so beside the point that it has faded from memory entirely, but the idea resurfaces any time a new Eric Rohmer film appears.


FOR TV, IT'S OUT OF THE TUXEDO AND BACK TO REALITY
LEAD: Whether by chance or calculation, television series often provide remarkable reflections of the real world.
Program forms, from situation comedies to action adventures, may remain the same, but content is always being adjusted to fit the changing times.
As Nancy Reagan's glittering gowns gave way to Barbara Bush's sensible shoes, so ''Dynasty'' is about to be replaced by less upscale, possibly even gentler diversions.

Scarsdale's Staging of 'Edwin Drood' Discovers Local Talent

Rupert Holmes himself, his mind on the coming Broadway opening of his new play, ''Accomplice,'' was unaware of the summer theater's plans.


The Sultry Underworld of 'Iguana'
LEAD: AS Tennessee Williams's plays - the exalted and the considerably less so - gushed forth from the mid-1940's through the 1970's, it was easy for critics and audiences to dismiss many of them as prodigal indulgences, sheer pretentiousness or even self-parody.


Question Of the Week; Are Yanks Making The Right Moves?
LEAD: The best move Syd Thrift can make would be to trade aging veterans such as Ken Phelps, Steve Balboni and Dale Mohorcic for some solid starting pitching.
The Yankees also have some bright young pitching prospects in their Class AA farm system who may be ready for the big leagues soon.

Do not neglect using water-soluble fertilizers for plants growing in window boxes, tubs or containers; plants need nutrients if leaves are beginning to turn yellow.

DAN QUAYLE AND ALLAN BLOOM
LEAD: Maureen Dowd's article ''The Education of Dan Quayle'' (June 25) did little to reassure those of us uneasy with the plummeting caliber of many of our elected officials.

ART VIEW
LEAD: There is much to think about in a short book called ''First Diasporist Manifesto,'' by R. B. Kitaj, the American painter who is now based in London, and published by Thames &amp; Hudson.

BRITS BUY UP THE AD BUSINESS
LEAD: Because of its global view, Randall Rothenberg's article ''Brits Buy Up the Ad Business'' (July 2) missed a human side of the story.

Where Crusaders Camped in Turkey
LEAD: ON their way to the Holy Land, the medieval soldiers, pilgrims, priests and nobles of the Crusades left behind them trails of settlement and plunder and awestruck accounts of the rich empires of the eastern Mediterranean.

Repairing Casement Windows
LEAD: CASEMENT windows, which open and close by pivoting on hinges, generally develop fewer problems than double-hung windows, whose two sashes slide in channels.
But casement windows can become hard to close because of insufficient lubrication, dirt-clogged parts, or a worn crank.

Question Of the Week; Are Yanks Making The Right Moves?

A Skirmish Over Seaborne Drugs
LEAD: To the casual observer, a container of pumpkins transported by sea and resting on the docks here not long ago appeared harmless enough.

It is piling up in our backwayrds, begging to be burned, buried or recycled, and spawning a new industry of waste management.


For Pestilence, Natural Controls
LEAD: Now we read there is a fungus that is decimating gypsy-moth caterpillars.
It is related to one native to Japan that was introduced here in 1910, but then ''the scientists lost track of it,'' according to officials in the Department of Agriculture, until it ''re-introduced'' itself this spring.
But why the long lapse of scientific attention and research follow-through on a potential natural control?

WOODSTOCK PLUS 20
LEAD: Before anyone bothers to transform Woodstock into a shrine for the generation named after it, the crucial question - Does anyone really care? - must be asked (''20 Years, and 50 Miles Down the Road,'' by Jon Bowermaster, July 2).

Lessons for Prisoners and Prisons
LEAD: GETTING tough on crime is easy.
The problem is what to do with the criminals afterward.
Handed the charge of making room for an ever-spiraling number of inmates, jailers across the New York region are faced increasingly with a task that society has chosen to shirk - training, educating and rehabilitating a population that is overwhelmingly illiterate, unemployed or drug-addicted.


What Exxon Will Be Leaving Behind
LEAD: AFTER the Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska last March, Exxon promised to do something that many environmentalists said was impossible: clean 11 million gallons of oil from hundreds of miles of shoreline and thousands of square miles of water.
Last week, the company seemed well on its way to accomplishing something that might seem equally improbable: spending $1.25 billion on the cleanup, or about $10 million a day, while making hardly anyone happy.


Marylanders Fighting Army Over Old School

Seeking a Fresh Image, the Kirov Goes Astray

LEAD: Whoever thought that changing the Henderson-Washington-Winfield trio to a Polonia-Kelly-Barfield outfield would improve the team chemistry and actually make the Yanks a more interesting team to watch?
