In Paris, a Love Affair Between New and Old
LEAD: The French have always had a fondness for the word ''cohabitation.'' And surely no term more aptly describes the state of public architecture in this city right now, as I. M.

This Spring, Kick Up Your Heels for Less

Right now around New York City there are dozens of $100-or-less styles that can be worn for work, for play or for more serious socializing.
The season is part of the reason.


CAMPUS LIFE: Fordham; Live Rams Sought For Perilous Job; Any Volunteers?
LEAD: Long, long ago, in the 70's, on the gentle rolling hills of Fordham's Rose Hill campus in the Bronx, the Fordham Ram, the school's mascot, was ambushed, painted green and hung by its hooves from a bridge, the story goes.
It died.
Eventually, the empty Ram Barn gave way to dormitories.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. We have two doors in our house that keep closing by themselves when we leave them open.

Any idea how I can keep these doors from closing by themselves?


FASHION: On the Street; A Rainbow of Raincoats
LEAD: Rainy weather creates its own fashions - not all of them practical, but most of them fun.

China's Hotels Mean Business
LEAD: RETURNING TO HER room at the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel in Beijing last December, Margaret Z. Lee, a marketing specialist for Honeywell, was astonished to find what appeared to be gold coins twice as big as dollar pieces resting on her pillow.
What impressed Lee, a frequent visitor to China from Honeywell's base in Hong Kong, was the size of the foil-wrapped chocolates.


NONFICTION
LEAD:  XIANG LAKE: Nine Centuries of Chinese Life.
By R. Keith Schoppa. (Yale University, $30.) In this carefully researched, scholarly work, a chronicle of the Xiang Lake reservoir in China's Zhejiang province from its creation in 1112 to the present, R.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  CHILDREN OF THE SIEGE.
By Pauline Cutting. (St. Martin's, $15.95.) Most of what we know about the Beirut crisis comes from bewildering, often conflicting news accounts of skirmishes, cease-fires and shifting alliances.
It is almost impossible to comprehend the changing motives of those involved, much less what it is like to live within the crumbling buildings and refugee camps of West Beirut.


Suddenly, Mars Seems a Little Farther Away
LEAD: THE dream of people flying to Mars will almost certainly come true in the 21st century.

A MEGAMUSEUM IN A MILL TOWN
LEAD: There are some points in Ms.
Weisgall's article at which I take umbrage.
For example, she describes North Adams as a poverty-stricken mill town featuring tenements on Mount Greylock, diners that do not serve brunch and a mayor in a green polyester blazer.


Review/Dance; A Curiosity Shop Of Sound and Motion
LEAD: Festivals, by definition, ought to be special events.
But on Wednesday night at the Horace Mann Theater, Festival Showcase II only intermittently looked special.
As a result, this program - a presentation of the Morningside Dance Festival of Columbia University Teachers College - was a showcase that had far too many trinkets on display.


Roles of 'Uncommon Women'
LEAD: THE drama department in the school where I teach was producing ''Uncommon Women and Others,'' a play about the reunion of a Mount Holyoke College graduating class.
Attractive, talented girls from the upper school would be be playing the roles.
They are lithe, angular, achingly young and right for the parts.


'I'm Not Rappaport': Park Bench Pathos
LEAD: HERB GARDNER's Tony Award-winning comedy, ''I'm Not Rappaport,'' at the Arena Players Main Stage Theater in East Farmingdale, is the kind of play that lets us feel good for not doing anything about social problems.


Legal-Aid Project Strives to Help Poor
LEAD: IT was an unusually slow Tuesday morning for Victor Ambrose, a lawyer for the poor.
His only case at the Nassau County District Court in Hempstead had just been postponed, and so he trudged several blocks through a chilly rain back to his office at the Nassau-Suffolk Law Services Committee Inc., an organization of three dozen lawyers who represent the poor in civil litigation at no cost.


Cost Comparisons
LEAD: To the Editor: I am a longtime fan of Portugal and have harangued my friends about its low prices.
In your chart, you compare dinner in Lisbon at Gambrinus with the New York Oyster Bar.
This is not comparing apples with apples - or even oranges.
It's comparing apples with brussels sprouts.
Gambrinus is grand luxe.


SPEAKING OF THE UPSPEAKABLE
LEAD: I, too, was sexually assaulted after my freshman year in college.
Unlike Ms.
Sebold, I was not raped.
But in an emotional sense, it makes no difference.
Seven years later, I still feel the same fear in the pit of my stomach when I put my key in the door late at night.
I still hear myself scream in the empty hallway after he let me go.


Lina Wertmuller Zeroes In on AIDS
LEAD: What is Lina Wertmuller's next film about?
Ask the publicist: ''One of the most potent and controversial topics of our generation.'' Ask the Italian production company: ''A frantic search for truth.''

Lost in the Bohemian Fog
LEAD: Jazz music and film have rarely been spun together more evocatively than in ''Let's Get Lost,'' Bruce Weber's documentary biography of the late jazz trumpeter and singer Chet Baker.


Lately, 'Early Music' Is Getting Much Later
LEAD: The English conductor Roger Norrington, who was barely known outside of London just a few years ago, has become about the hottest commodity in classical music.
One uses that word advisedly, since aside from awards for his Beethoven symphony performances on original instruments and the reams of journalistic copy he has inspired, his disks sell handily worldwide, challenging the sales of better-known maestros with brand-name orchestras.


Concrete Reefs to Face Test
LEAD: ENGINEERS are preparing to install a concrete reef system off the coast of this Cape May County community to demonstrate how to counteract beach erosion.
If successful, the project could be duplicated elsewhere and save taxpayers in the state millions of dollars a year in sand replenishment and beach restoration.


From the Garden to the Table
LEAD: CHARD or Swiss chard, is a vegetable with which many people are barely acquainted.
There are those who might be able to recognize it in the market but who have rarely cooked or eaten it.
For many shoppers, it's just another of those mysterious bunches of green.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Quid Pro Quo From Developers; Using Private Funds for Public Improvements
LEAD: In a reversal of practice, when communities offered inducements to attract office and industrial projects, commercial developers today are being pressured to provide public improvements ranging from sewer lines to sculpture.
Sometimes the exactions are plainly stated in law books; sometimes they are hammered out informally.


The Story Of Baseball: You Can Go Home Again
LEAD: If baseball is a narrative, it is like others - a work of imagination whose deeper structures and patterns of repetition force a tale, oft-told, to fresh and hither-to-unforeseen meaning.
But what is the nature of the tale oft-told that recommences with every pitch, with every game, with every season?


A Queens Woman Shoots Son
LEAD: A woman shot and wounded her 30-year-old son, described as a longtime drug addict, in an argument in their Queens home, the police said yesterday.

To Close Shortfall, Officials Say, Cuomo Must Find New Revenues

The Dilemma of 'Open Skies'
LEAD: GLOBALONEY,'' SAID THE REPUB-lican Congresswoman from Connecticut.

CONNECTICUT OPINION

LEAD: Except for Spiro Malas and Andrij Dobriansky in the tiny parts of the Captain and Zaretski, the cast for the Wednesday evening performance of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin'' at the Metropolitan Opera was entirely different, including the conductor, than when the opera was first presented this season only three weeks ago.


Companies Discovering Many Values In Artworks LBy ANDREW L. YARROW
LEAD: IF the Medicis were alive today, these great Renaissance patrons of the arts might well inhabit sleek suburban bank buildings and sprawling corporate campuses.

Reviews/Music; The Minnesota, in a Messiaen Aviary
LEAD: The Minnesota Orchestra has long been one of this country's truly honorable second-rate ensembles.

But just below that level, it has proven fully capable of committed, deeply musical performances.

Esposito Replaces Bergeron
LEAD: April Fool's Day was less than 12 hours old, and Phil Esposito, a grim and uncomfortable general manager, was already weary of explaining to reporters that it all was no joke.

PASTIMES: Camera
LEAD: Last week I once again had the dubious honor of being a juror for a nationwide photography competition, this time at the Catskill Center for Photography in Woodstock, N.Y.

A Mind's-Eye View of Beckett's World
LEAD: Of all Samuel Beckett's dramatic works, the ones that have been most neglected are his radio plays.
The major stage plays are continually revived, the television plays are shown with a certain frequency, at least in West Germany, but his work for radio exists largely as printed texts.
On the page, they lose half their dimension.

New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: There are certain givens when it comes to memorable days in people's lives.

A Foundation's Helping Hands
LEAD: Pro Bono Inc. may well be one of the ''ducks'' to which Scott McVay, executive director of the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, referred in the recent article on that organization (''A Low-Key Foundation That Likes to Take Risks in Giving'').

CAMPUS LIFE: Carnegie-Mellon; A Tradition Ends: Party Falls Victim To a Liquor Law
LEAD: Since 1915, Carnegie-Mellon University students have gotten together every four years for an all-night, all-out costume party called the beaux-arts ball.

Question Of the Week; How Will The Yanks And Mets Do in 1989?
LEAD: The Mets are a cinch to win even with Darryl Strawberry striking out in the clutch.

A fantasy about a childlike middle-aged Dutch baker and a documentary about a well-known sculptor rearranging stones in the Sahara definitely sounds like a forced double bill.
But ''Egg,'' Danniel Danniel's fiction about a 35-year-old naif, and Philip Haas's ''Stones and Flies: Richard Long in the Sahara,'' are both sophisticated films about simplicity itself.
These two unconventional works, opening today at Film Forum 1, run scarcely more than an hour and a half combined.
They are energetic, engaging, paradoxical little forays into one huge question: how do simple values and forms survive in our complex modern world?
''Stones and Flies'' begins with a man walking - the fundamental activity Mr.
Long has been turning into art for 20 years.
The British artist travels the world, leaving behind stones he has shaped into circles and lines, sometimes photographing the traces of his walks.

Review/Rock; Roots-Tinged Sounds And Dance-Floor Style
LEAD: The New Orleans Radiators should be heard from a dance floor.
The band, which was formed in 1977, has perfected a sputtering, undulating, relaxed but insinuating mambo-shuffle-funk groove that goes straight to the hips.
Long established as New Orleans's best-loved bar band, the Radiators have built a nationwide following with that groove and with arrangements that recall Little Feat, the Grateful Dead, the Band, the Allman

LEAD: By its nature, the back nine is the Masters' theater.

Question Of the Week; Did Esposito Make the Right Move?

The Splendors of a Northwest Spring
LEAD: Visitors to the Pacific Northwest are often struck by the richness and depth of April's floral display.

Question Of the Week; Did Esposito Make the Right Move?

Much of what takes place on the earth's surface is the geographer's domain: climate, natural resources, industries and inhabitants of continents and countries, and more.


A Garden That Spans the Centuries
LEAD: Visiting Newby is a spring tonic.
The English winter in North Yorkshire can be bleak, yet in the south-sloping gardens of Newby Hall, reached through sweeping parkland enclosed by sheltering woodland, spring comes early.
The flowering plants of April and May will surprise and delight visitors.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  JOHN HELD, JR.: Illustrator of the Jazz Age, by Shelley Armitage. (Syracuse University, $24.95.) By creating the image of the Flapper, John Held Jr. helped define the free spirit of the 1920's and made himself a millionaire.
But styles changed, his fortunes crashed and he was left to start life over again.


Question Of the Week; Did Esposito Make the Right Move?

1960's 'Hair' in Bridgeport Revival
LEAD: IN the late 1960's, there was a musical about innocence, peace, love and harmony - and protest.
With a bountiful rock score, a minimalist book and free-flowing staging, it signaled a radical new form for the Broadway musical.
It also had a profusion of taboo words, scenes depicting drug use and lovemaking, and one scene displaying frontal nudity.


Esposito Brothers Facing Off Again
LEAD: They competed against each other vigorously in meaningless street games, in more serious confrontations at the youth level and then, finally, in the National Hockey League.
Now, the most significant battle between the Esposito brothers, Phil and Tony, is being fought by others while they watch.

By Michael Moss.
Illustrated. 346 pp.
New York:  Doubleday &amp; Company.


Corrections
LEAD: An article on March 19 about the High Desert Museum in Bend, Ore., misstated the city's location.
It is 166 miles southeast of Portland.
A map with the article omitted the direct route from Portland to Bend and misidentified the mountain west of Bend.
The road is U.S. 26; the mountain is Mount Bachelor.


A TALE OF TWO CLOSET
LEAD: Last summer I visited friends who had recently moved into a new house.
Their architect had done well by them: The spaces were generous, the rooms lofty, the kitchen appliances had been cleverly tucked into the walls, and any surfaces that might get wet (and some that might not) were covered in granite, slate or marble.


The Library Connection
LEAD: THERE is a monument in our town.
There are no holidays that commemorate it.
No wreaths are laid at its feet in remembrance, and there are no lofty speeches made in tribute.
And yet it plays a very important part in each of our lives.
At their first introduction, little children approach it in wide-eyed awe.

Chicago Race Divisions Begin at Home
LEAD: WHETHER or not Chicago is the most racially segregated big city in the nation, as demographers often maintain, there is no question that black people and white people are usually not neighbors.
Indeed, political experts say, the unusually high degree of segregation in housing helps explain the unusually sharp racial division at the voting booth, as was evident last Tuesday when Richard M.


Anne Cady Is Married
LEAD: The marriage of Anne Payan Cady, a daughter of Ruth Payan Cady of Somers, N.Y., and Everett Ware Cady Jr. of Ferrisburg, Vt., to John William Keegan Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Each year the number of applicants has grown, practically doubling from a decade ago.


Taking Colette on a Holiday
LEAD: WE were heading to the Perigord to celebrate 10 years of marriage.
Truffles and foie gras, walks in the fields, fishing; a hideaway bedroom under the eaves.
Perhaps we would look at cave painting at Les Eyzies.
On the other hand we might go no farther than the garden at our inn, sipping fresh lemonade or Vichy with raspberries.


IS COMPETENCE ENOUGH?
LEAD: According to a professor in Mr.
Lukas's article, bureaucrats and government school apparatchiks think the best job to have is one running other people's lives (thunderous applause, please).
Further, it appears that ''a lot of what goes on in the private sector isn't terribly important.'' This was no doubt proclaimed by the good professor after he put on sunglasses, drove a car and picked up typed class notes, all of which were supplied by private industry.


U.S. Doubles Has Pair of Aces
LEAD: Compared with their more illustrious teammates, Ken Flach and Robert Seguso lead rather uneventful tennis lives.


Preventive Detention May Save Lives
LEAD: THEY are two seemingly unrelated murder cases.
One is from Morris County.
One is from Cumberland County.


Sorry, Long Number
LEAD: Have you tried making a long-distance call from a pay telephone lately?
A.T.&amp;T.'s virtual monopoly over pay phones came to an end on April 1 in the belief that competition will force down rates.
It may, but the first results are confusion, frustration and sometimes outrageous tolls.


Eastern Europe Tests The Limits of Liberalism
LEAD: THE sweeping new measures announced last week in Poland demonstrate once again how rapid the pace of change has become in parts of the East bloc - more rapid than in Moscow and fast enough to generate new debate in the West about how far it should go in encouraging political transformation in Eastern Europe.


Recladding A Tower
LEAD: SHELBY PIERCE is more accustomed to the engineering of oil refineries than of skyscrapers.
But the 80-story Amoco corporate headquarters here needs attention and Mr.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. The ceiling in one of our rooms is finished with sand paint.
Some months ago, we repainted, and since then the seams have cracked and pieces have fallen off.

TELEPHONES: HIGH-TECH OPTIONS
LEAD: THE TELEPHONE, LONG A simple, single-purpose household fixture, has recently undergone a revolution.
In the past 10 years or so, our homes and, in some cases, our cars have become home to answering machines, cordless phones, automatic dialers, speaker phones, call diverters, cellular phones and telefax machines, to name but a few.


Mapping The Terrain of Jerseysomething

Richard Leonard officiated.
The bride, a freelance writer, graduated from the Brearley School and magna cum laude from Brown University.


Tongue Untied
LEAD: Robert Fraga, an associate professor of mathematics who speaks lovingly of derivatives and integrals, thought his calculus class was getting stale.
He recently found a solution - foreign languages.
Now his students at Ripon College in Wisconsin are grappling with calculus problems presented in the native languages of Belgium, France, India, Japan and the Soviet Union.


Chaplin, Inventing Modern Times; Spinning Reels of Memory On a Master's Centenary
LEAD: What is your favorite bit of business from a Chaplin film?
Charlie stealing a hot dog from a baby and, when he has finished it, carefully wiping the tot's lips?
Charlie planting a fringed lampshade on his head and then standing rigid enough to pass for furniture?
Charlie putting up with a 4-year-old monster until the room clears of adults, then treating the brat to a precise, rather refined, thoroughly deserved kick in the midriff?


Marlene Stewart: Costume Designer
LEAD: In the music video ''Like a Prayer,'' the singer Madonna wears a brown satin slip and dances in front of burning crosses.
Objections to the religious imagery caused Pepsico Inc. to cancel a $5 million commercial for Pepsi-Cola that featured the song.
More typically, though, it has been Madonna's attire that has caused a stir.


Inquiry Report Near, Democrats Fight for Speaker
LEAD: Speaker of the House Jim Wright and his supporters have begun a quiet counteroffensive to try to salvage his image as the House ethics committee's investigation of him nears an end.


Dr. Mack Lipkin, 82, Professor of Medicine

He was 82 years old and also maintained a residence in New York City.


Soviet Travel: Friendship and Flexibility
LEAD: LIKE explorers finding new riches under the sun, county residents are discovering the Soviet Union.
A college modern-dance ensemble, a photographer, a songwriter and a group of high-school students are among the latest to feel the warmth of glasnost in their planned or just-completed trips to Russia.


U.S. Sports Heading Overseas; PRO LEAGUES IN AMERICA EYE THE GLOBE
LEAD: Symbolically and fittingly, a basketball painted like a globe sits in the locker-room-sized office of David Stern, the National Basketball Association commissioner.


Sugar Sweetens County Commerce
LEAD: I was most interested to read the article ''The View From: Refined Sugars Inc.''  [ March 19 ] .
Sugar refining is probably the oldest continuing industry in Westchester, and readers who are interested in learning its history might want to read an article titled ''Sugar Time on the Hudson,'' which appears in the Winter 1989 issue of our journal, The Westchester Historian.


Zvereva Blocks Navratilova From Final
LEAD: Martina Navratilova entered this tournament intent on earning a showdown with Steffi Graf, the player who displaced her at the pinnacle of women's tennis, but she was eliminated before the duel could happen.
Navratilova was headed off at the penultimate pass today by Natalya Zvereva of the Soviet Union, who defeated the defending champion, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, in an upset in the semifinal round of the Family Circle

Reviews/Dance; Serenity and Bellicosity In Jackson-Tanabe Bill
LEAD: The exquisite can be compelling, but generally only in small doses.
And the doses were large in ''Daimon,'' a program of new and recent dances by Kristin Jackson and Mariko Tanabe that ends today at the Mulberry Street Theater (70 Mulberry Street).


KEPPING EMPLOYEES IN STITCHES AND RAISING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY
LEAD: Comedy's hip image, fast pace and young, upwardly mobile audience has made it an effective tool for corporations in advertising and in motivating their employees.


Arafat Opposes Shamir's Plan
LEAD: Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has dismissed as ''inappropriate'' an American-backed Israeli proposal for elections in the Israeli-occupied territories.


Laser 3-D Lessons
LEAD: Besides the subjects you would expect in an elementary-school arts program, like drama, dance and art, the elementary schools of North Bellmore, L.I., offer a bit of the esoteric: holography.
According to its officials, it is the nation's only permanent program in grade school.


Why Johnny's Watching Needs Watching
LEAD: Just suppose that your 9-year-old child returned from school one afternoon proudly displaying the new class reading primers, somewhat simplified versions of ''Fanny Hill'' and the exploits of the Marquis de Sade.
You and hundreds of other parents would descend the very day in righteous wrath on a beleaguered school board.


REPENTANCE FIRST, PEACE LATER
LEAD:  THE WRATH OF JONAH  The Crisis of Religious Nationalism in the  Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.
By Rosemary Radford Ruether and Herman J. Ruether.  277 pp.

O'Neill to Marquette
LEAD: Kevin O'Neill, who earned a reputation as one of the nation's top recruiters during three years as an assistant at Arizona, was named Marquette University's head basketball coach yesterday.

CAMPUS LIFE: University of Virginia; Fraternity Pledges Are 'On Line' in Rite of Passage
LEAD: Ten college men stand at attention in uniforms, complete with berets.
They speak only when barking responses to their commander's orders and they all have the sternest of looks on their faces.

Martin B. Stahl of Edison, N.J., was married there last evening at Temple Emanu-El to David Max Mermelstein, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

Red Smith Award
LEAD: Edwin Pope, the sports editor of The Miami Herald, has won the 1989 Red Smith Award for career contributions to sports journalism.
The award, given by The Associated Press Sports Editors, is named for The New York Times columnist who died in 1982.


SCIENCE FICTION: IMAGINARY WOLRDS AND REAL-LIFE QUESTIONS
LEAD: Fourteen years ago I began to teach a course in science fiction at Dartmouth College.
Spaceships figured in the reading, along with faster-than-light travel, telepathic robots and in one story some bright orange aliens who rather resembled tennis balls on legs.


WHAT'S DOING IN: Louisville
LEAD: Stand alongside Jean Dubuffet's dancing figures atop the steps of the Kentucky Center for the Arts and look around.
There is hardly a better way to grasp what's happening in Louisville.
From this vantage the visitor sees the city's belatedly developing skyline, a vista of black-box and mirror-walled towers and spindly cranes, punctuated by Michael Graves's post-classical Humana Building, a granite-and-marble work.


Review/Dance; Clacking of Tap Shoes In Village Gate Series
LEAD: A new series of tap-dance performances got under way Monday night at the Top of the Village Gate, where every Monday this month Manhattan Tap, a talented young ensemble, is to appear with guest dancers and musicians.
The first guests in the series were Charles (Cookie) Cook and James (Buster) Brown, two veteran tap dancers who are among today's most distinguished exemplars of that art form.


COMEDIANS WHO BECOME ACTORS ARE NOW TAKEN SERIOUSLY
LEAD: As the comedy market has gotten hotter, so has the demand for top comedians by television and movie producers. ''There always has been a crossover from stand-up comedy to television and film,'' said Marty Klein, president of the Agency for Performing Artists, which handles Steve Martin and David Letterman.


Polish Agreement Is Seen as Putting the Economic Ball in the West's Court
LEAD: At the conclusion of the successful round-table talks in Warsaw last week, Gen.

It was time, he said, for Western governments to ''fulfill their commitments to Poland.

The article was done very well.


Norway Says 50 Survive

A Week for the Voice And for the Piano
LEAD: THIS will be a week for singing, with two operas, an oratorio, a requiem and a musical comedy classic among the concert highlights.
It will also be a good week for piano music, because Jorge Bolet, Lorin Hollander, Jeremy Menuhin and Vladimir Ashkenazy are among the visitors.


Artistic License
LEAD: To the Editor:


PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: There is nothing quite as chaotic in chess as the naming of opening variations.
Even in those cases where the original name was perhaps justified, someone will come along and rename it after a current practitioner who enjoys success with it.
That may last for one chess generation, that is, until a successor appears on the scene and has it named for him.


Of Sigmund and Minna
LEAD: To the Editor:


'Concerts in Color' at Union Church
LEAD: ON Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday afternoons from April through December, the stained-glass windows of Henri Matisse and Marc Chagall are on view at the Union Church of Pocantico Hills.

Kurt Christian Schluntz, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
H.
Edward Schluntz of Newton, Mass., has been made known by the future bride's parents, Dr. and Mrs.
Keith Merritt Lindgren of Chevy Chase, Md.
The couple plan to marry in October.


Plan or No Plan, Debt Relief Is Not Around the Corner
LEAD: THE struggle over how to handle the third world debt crisis has entered a risky new stage.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has raised expectations in the highly indebted countries with his plan to encourage greater debt relief on the part of commercial banks.
But as became clear at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank last week, the plan is still far from fully conceived and lacks important support from European and


CAN GORBACHEV FEED RUSSIA?
LEAD: IN MOSCOW LATE LAST SUMMER, I DID as ordinary Muscovites must - joined a creeping line in a sour-smelling, meagerly stocked food store, shuffled for half an hour toward a poky butcher who mostly loitered with his back turned, and finally bought a kilo of fat attached to a sliver of beef.


Rose Garden Ritual: Athletes on Parade
LEAD: Gone are the Washington Senators -unfortunately only the baseball club, that is - but not the President's affection for sports and sportsmen.


FLASHCARD
LEAD: The three most popular fields of doctoral studies in 1986 were education, physical science and engineering.
The fewest Ph.D.'s were awarded in protective services, parks and recreation and law. - National Center for Education Statistics

It will open the new season on Tuesday and run until June 23.


Correction
LEAD: An article last Sunday about the beginning of Namibia's transition to independence misstated the role of Cuban troops in some editions.
The Cubans are pulling out of Angola, not Namibia.


Let's Get the Contras Out of Honduras Now
LEAD: To the Editor:


THE WORLD: Meeting Bush; To Shamir, Washington Isn't As Warm as It Used to Be
LEAD: THERE was a moment Thursday as Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and President Bush were speaking to reporters about the results of their White House meeting when it sounded as if the two men were actually on the same wavelength.
Allowing Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to elect a leadership, they agreed, was the best way to break the deadlock and open the way for broader negotiations.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Times Sq. Signage; A Mandated Comeback for the Great White
LEAD: MANY of the kinetic signs that pushed up the voltage of Times Square after dark are gone today - replaced by dark skeletons of future hotels and office towers.
But as those buildings open over the next two years, they will be gilded by more than an acre of neon, flashing lights, video screens and billboards.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD:  Tingles at the I.R.S.
IT'S Tingle Table time at the Internal Revenue Service. ''By next week we'll have all the Tingle Tables in use,'' said Joanne Luciani of the I.R.S., as she and a visitor surveyed the Tingle Table room, officially known as the extracting room, at the I.R.S.
Brookhaven Service Center.


80 Nations Clear Way to Resume Trade Talks
LEAD: More than 80 trading nations today adopted negotiating guidelines for textiles, agriculture, and two other areas, clearing the way for the resumption of suspended international trade talks.


Sacking Out
LEAD: Richard Press is piqued.
Fashion professionals have trumpeted Milan's rendition of the Yankee sack suit - broad-shouldered, wide-chested, loose-fitting - as the last word in high style.
But Press isn't having any of it. ''I find it amusing that Milanese designers are telling hairdressers that the sack suit is now appropriate wear,'' says the vice president of J.


Robin Truesdell to Wed
LEAD: Robin Suzanne Truesdell and Jeffrey Edward Sher are planning an August wedding, Carolyn Truesdell and J. Richard Cheney of Houston, the mother and stepfather of the bride-to-be, have announced.
Mr.

Ms.
Truesdell, a daughter also of Leonard C.


As Clear As ...
LEAD: In their never-ending search for original thesis topics, Ph.D. candidates choose subjects whose titles are often notable for their length, if not lucidity.

Laura Lovelace to Wed Kent Guernsey May 6
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Giles Edward Lovelace of Charleston, S.C., have announced plans for a May 6 wedding for their daughter, Laura Sue Addison Lovelace, and Kent Chapman Guernsey, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
David Taylor Guernsey of Litchfield, Conn.


A Style With Many Faces
LEAD: SOFTENED MODERNISM?
A discovery for interior designers perhaps, but architects have been trying to make modernism's hard edges gentler for more than a generation - although maybe it's more accurate to say that they have really been struggling with the question of just how hard modernism ought to be.


Child Care Wars
LEAD: The squat white building at a busy Washington, D.C., intersection is anything but impressive, but by most standards it is the very model of quality child care.
The building, housing the Senate Employees' Child Care Center just a few blocks from the Capitol, is open from 7:30 A.M. to 6:45 P.M., accommodating the needs of working parents.


Education Life/Section 4A
LEAD: A geography quiz, on page 24, is among the items on education in America.


Katmandu
LEAD: To the Editor: Perhaps Ms.
Fleming didn't see any flower children during her three-month stay in Katmandu, but I certainly did last November.
They are disguised as post-pubescent yuppies and ride bicycles around the city like maniacs.
They'd put most New York bike messengers to shame.


Taking the Mystery Out of Swiss Chard
LEAD: CHARD or Swiss chard, is a vegetable with which many people are barely acquainted.
There are those who might be able to recognize it in the market but who have rarely cooked or eaten it.
For many shoppers, it's just another of those mysterious bunches of green.


IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: Fewer Problems; The Medical Record On DES Emerges After Years of Research and Anxiety
LEAD: AFTER years of anguish, the daughters of women who took DES during their pregnancies have received encouraging news lately.
Last week they won an important victory when the New York Court of Appeals made it easier for them to sue companies that made the drug, which was prescribed to avert miscarriages.


Of Sigmund and Minna
LEAD: To the Editor:


Detained Yugoslav a Suicide
LEAD: An ethnic Albanian committed suicide by jumping out a window during interrogation as security forces investigated sabotage in Kosovo, newspapers said today.
The Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti said the ethnic Albanian, Djemaili Rasit Berisa, leaped to his death Thursday while being questioned in Prizren, a Kosovo town.


Leaving East Rockaway
LEAD: I've finally made up my mind.
After eight years of living in East Rockaway, I'm packing my belongings and moving back to Rockville Centre.


Moscow Confirms Blaze and Deaths Aboard Lost Nuclear Sub
LEAD: The Soviet Government today confirmed the fire and fatalities aboard a nuclear-powered submarine that sank at sea Friday, but insisted that there was no danger of nuclear contamination of the environment.


SOFTENING MODERN SPACES
LEAD: Even though the interior designer John Saladino calls them ''filing cabinets for living,'' modern houses and apartments need not be stark and cold.
Without compromising the virtues of modern architecture, they can be made both softer and more inviting.
Suggestions from top professionals vary from the selection of color to the placement of furniture, yet all believe in harmonizing with the building's original design.


Time Executive Retires, to Another Job
LEAD: EARLY on as a correspondent for Life magazine, Don Wilson covered the demise of The New York Sun, the Alger Hiss spy trial and, oh yes, the roller-skating horse in Bowling Green, Ky.


'Playboy' Brogue Becomes Creole
LEAD: A CROSS-CULTURAL festival of sorts is happening at Crossroads, the black theater company that's as worldly minded as it is theatrically varied. ''Playboy of the West Indies,'' which is boisterously holding forth through next Sunday, is the Trinidad playwright Mustapha Matura's contemporary transposition of the turn-of-the-century Irish classic, ''The Playboy of the Western World'' by John Millington


John Muir Trail
LEAD: To the Editor: I wonder if the article on hiking California's John Muir Trail from Yosemite to Mount Whitney (Travel, Jan. 15) has not left the impression that hiking any section of the trail is only for hardy hikers?
I am certainly not one, yet in 1977 four of us did a lesser backpack, which culminated in climbing Mount Whitney, and we did it without resupply logistics.


IS COMPETENCE ENOUGH?
LEAD: Mr.
Lukas's article on the Kennedy School shows deserved recognition for graduate school studies in government rather than in the hallowed fields of medicine, law and business.
Unfortunately, however, Mr.
Lukas's article focuses on faculty debates rather than on students.


Mementos of the Rise and Staying Power of Rock-and-Roll
LEAD: THE current show at the Museum of Art, Science and Industry contains little art and less science.

Review/Concert; Euterpean Ensemble

SPRING REPORT: Morality Lessons; Democracy 101
LEAD: Central to the life of a just community is public discussion of issues that affect students.

Drug Arrests And the Courts' Pleas for Help
LEAD: NEW YORK CITY'S war on drugs has resulted in so many arrests that there are simply not enough prosecutors, judges, Legal Aid lawyers or probation officers to give adequate attention to each of the thousands of cases, let alone courtrooms to try the suspects in or jail cells to hold the convicts.

Spanish Handcrafts Faithful to Tradition
LEAD: THE dramatically varied land of Spain has been celebrated for centuries - not just by the prodigious Cervantes or Lope de Vega or Goya or Velazquez, but by the more pragmatic artisans of Spain's pueblos and regions.
While Cervantes was immortalizing the man of La Mancha, Velazquez the family of Philip IV, Spain's anonymous potters and spinners were seeing a brown earthenware jar in the clay of Castile-La Mancha, a carpet or tapestry in the hemp of Madrid.

POSTINGS: Waterbury Mall; Lease-Buy Option
LEAD: The developer of a new retail project in Waterbury, Conn., is using a novel hook to lure tenants: He will lease space in the 49,000-square-foot complex for about $18 a square foot, then allow the tenants the option of buying their stores during the first three years of the lease at a price between $185 and $200 a square foot.

Where Poodle Skirts and Crinolines Live On
LEAD: Marjorie McCown was wearing diapers in the mid-1950's, a time when the original production of ''The Pajama Game'' was on Broadway and more mature women were sporting crinolines beneath their poodle-decorated skirts.
Ms.
McCown, who was born 34 years ago in Tuscola, Ill., may have missed some of the fashions of the 50's the first time around, but she had the opportunity to re-create them as costume designer for the New York City Opera's revival of ''The Pajama Game.


Question Of the Week; Did Esposito Make the Right Move?
LEAD: Two wrongs don't make a right.
Trading a first-round pick for a volatile coach was the first wrong.
Dropping that coach just before the playoffs was the second, and only amplifies the first.
GEORGE SIDEBOTHAM  Princeton, N.J.


LIFESTYLE: Sunday Menu; Counterculture Potato Dish (But Hold the Cholesterol)
LEAD: Years ago in a counterculture restaurant on the Pacific Coast Highway near Santa Barbara, Calif., one of the most popular dishes was a baked potato awash in butter, smothered with vegetables, seasoned with miso and topped with cheese.

There was a long wait, but when the potato arrived the perfectly cooked vegetables atop the fluffy, creamy-white interior were worth it.


Managing When It's All in the Family
LEAD: S.C.
Johnson &amp; Sons Inc. is one of the largest family-owned companies in the United States, with revenues of more than $2 billion.

Soviet Writers Look Across A Big Gap
LEAD: THE Soviet Union has never been among the 61 countries that have chapters of PEN, the international association of poets, essayists, novelists, editors and translators - and for obvious reasons.
Membership requires adherence to the association's charter.
And at the charter's heart is freedom of expression, open protest against censorship and efforts to free imprisoned writers.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. The ceiling in one of our rooms is finished with sand paint.
Some months ago, we repainted, and since then the seams have cracked and pieces have fallen off.

No Depth on 'Wuthering Heights'
LEAD: Of all the spirits fluttering over the moors of Wuthering Heights, the most restless, disturbed soul must be Emily Bronte's.

RANGERS ONE LOSS FROM THE END
LEAD: There were white towels everywhere in Madison Square Garden last night.
The promotional gimmick, though, soon became a bitter memento.
For the crowd that waved the towels so enthusiastically at the start of the night no doubt wanted nothing more than to throw them in a couple of hours later.
Certainly, they tossed just about everything else into the rink.


FINDING 'THE ZONE'
LEAD: NO ONE KNOWS WHEN IT FIRST CAME TO BE called ''the zone,'' but if you want an example of the lofty, almost mystical state to which sport, at times, can grant one entry, you couldn't do better than this one, recalled by the great Brazilian genius of soccer, Pele, in his book, written with Robert L.

LEAD: To the Editor:


In East, Harvard Is Crew to Beat
LEAD: The test between Brown, a formidable challenger, and Harvard, the reigning champion of college crew racing, was postponed today.

April Showers Arrive in Maine as Snow


Review/Theater; Introspection and Enigma In Everywoman Drama
LEAD: Before the lights come up on ''Night Breath,'' a curious play by Dennis Clontz that is being staged by the Beacon Project, a medley of recorded folk songs is played as a sort of prelude.

LEAD: One-run games are turning the winning way for the Kansas City Royals.


The Fine Distinctions of Jeremy Irons
LEAD: Though mannerism has flourished as an acting style lately, Jeremy Irons's exceptional career has been built on intelligent restraint.

Ms. Kollek Plans To Marry in May
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.

Denys Roberts Evans of Headington, Oxford, England, and the late Rev.
Denys Roberts Evans.


Traditional Thai and Warm Hospitality
LEAD: IT is not a quantum leap from Hunan and Sichuan Chinese regional cooking, a recent rage in Connecticut, to the even more incendiary cuisine of Thailand.
A new Thai arrival is King &amp; I in Bridgeport, across from Treeland off the Huntington Turnpike. (Take exit 8 on Route 8.) As new and small as it is - just a narrow storefront with a tiny upper level - King &amp; I was packed with diners on what are normally slow weeknights, and many of the patrons at the close-together tables seemed to be regulars.


A Crater Moonscape In Maui
LEAD: IN the late afternoon at Leleiwi Overlook on Mount Haleakala on the island of Maui in the Hawaiian Islands, visitors sometimes see their shadows projected against the clouds below and surrounded by a circular rainbow, a phenomenon known as Brocken's Specter.

Prospects; Banks as Takeover Targets
LEAD: Last week, the Citizens and Southern Corporation, a bank holding company, rejected a hostile takeover bid from another bank holding company, the NCNB Corporation, which recently acquired the ailing First Republicbank of Texas.

Finding Cruise Ships Fitted for Wheelchair Users
LEAD: THE Star Princess entered service at the end of March, sailing from Florida to the western Caribbean on a 10-day cruise, with 10 cabins out of 735 adapted for wheelchair users.
That may not look like a big number, but it ranks among the larger totals for a single vessel.
And it was enough to register a big jump in the number of accessible cabins for people with no mobility, for there is a big difference between ''wheelchairs accepted,'' a common locution used by cruise lines, and ''wheelchair accessible.


Mahwah Journal; Township Is Puzzled by Telephoned Bomb Threats
LEAD: IN this small Bergen County community at the foot of the Ramapo Mountains, a faceless specter haunts the mixture of tree-lined back roads and modern office parks, and the residents speak of it only in hushed whispers over morning coffee at the local confectionery shop.


NEW ANGLES ON MODERN
LEAD: Modern.
The word has chilly connotations: glass and steel, stark white rooms, the spare architecture of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe.
But these stereotyped images represent only one part of modern design, the International Style of the 1920's.
In reality, modernism has reappeared - in different guises and visions - each successive decade.


Here's the Pitch, Made of Porcelain

Question Of the Week; Did Esposito Make the Right Move?
LEAD: One might agree that Esposito has been impatient and impulsive at times.
But Ranger fans are just as eager for the Stanley Cup.
Although Bergeron has a good winning percentage and is purported to be a great playoff coach, his teams haven't won diddley squat.
Enough said.

Review/Music; A Lyrical Japanese Epic on Life's Fragility
LEAD: The Japanese remember ''The Tale of Heike'' as we might Homer and Dante.
The epic quality of its story - a 12th-century war between the Genji and the Heike clans - is given breadth and depth first by its ruminations on the fragility of life and the reality of death, and then by a lyrical style that has come to be deeply reverenced over the centuries.

Correction
LEAD: An article Feb. 19 on Panamanians' attitudes about the United States misstated the origins of most black Panamanians.

LEAD: THE doctor's secretary and I had no problem agreeing on a date and time for my first office visit.

LEAD:  THE PATH OF NO RESISTANCE: The Story of the Revolution in Superconductivity.
By Bruce Schechter. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $19.95.)

Tax Time Nostalgia Trip
LEAD: There is one good thing about tax time.
I review my life during the last year.
While searching for deductions, my checkbook guides me through happenings that are new history.
I am reminded of the good, the bad and the neutral events; the tennis lessons; the course in computer literacy; the trips to the hairdresser, the visits to the doctor and dentist; the shopping sprees; the much-anticipated vacation; the unexpected car repairs; the tickets for concert and plays; the attendance at lectures, the restaurants I patronized and the tourist shops

LEAD: A television program starting next fall just might make M.B.A.'s out of America's couch potatoes.

Becoming a Hi-Fi Detective
LEAD: Not all topics warrant the full treatment, and once again it's time for short takes.

That Syncing Feeling
LEAD: I wish it were a nightmare.
As elaborate lights illuminated a stageful of smoke-machine smoke, on came a full band - singers, dancers, guitarists, keyboardists, a drummer.
The first song had a big beat, layered vocal harmonies and a dance move for every line of lyrics.
It didn't seem to bother anyone but a lone, cranky critic that the drum kit was untouched until five songs into the set, or that the backup vocals (and, it seemed, some of the lead vocals as well) were on tape along with the beat.

LEAD: God is just a guy named Joe in Bruce Graham's apocalyptical comedy, ''Early One Evening at the Rainbow Bar and Grille.''

A Feminist's Daughter
LEAD: WHEN my daughter announced what she wanted to be, I wanted to fling myself from the car.

New Tapes Strive For CD Standards
LEAD: No tape recorder can be any better than the tape running in it.

LEAD: Unlike virtually all other architectural icons, which turn out to be smaller than you think they will be, the Eiffel Tower is bigger.

Review/Theater; The Nostalgia of Murder When the Lights Go Out
LEAD: Years ago, when movies were in their infancy and television was not even a gleam in an inventor's eye, theater had a stranglehold on what is now called light entertainment.

Easing the Next Slump
LEAD: With the economic expansion running out of steam, a number of economists are predicting a recession next year.

LEAD: ONE of my father's most nourishing gifts was an appreciation and deep love of nature.
There are few things that fill me with joy more than the discovery of a fawn pausing to drink from an icy brook, or the sight of a porpoise swimming off the shore of a deserted beach.
The vibrant cacophony of color that explodes on a hillside as autumn takes possession brings with it an ecstasy that enriches my life and leaves me searching for ever more fulfillment.

Bennett's Two Problems: Supply and Demand
LEAD: IN the 1960's, the debate over battling illegal narcotics in the United States pitted those who stressed greater law enforcement against advocates of medical solutions.
By the 1970's, reducing the supply of drugs seemed to be in vogue.
Today, though Federal resources still concentrate on choking off the drug flow, there is a growing realization that such efforts must be coupled with more aggressive strategies for diminishing demand by educating people about the perils of drugs.

CRIME
LEAD: ''The history of guns is the history of Detroit.'' Loren D. Estleman jolts us with this one in SILENT THUNDER (Houghton Mifflin, $16.95), his timely new Amos Walker mystery on the subject of assault weapons in the hands of private citizens.
The square-jawed and utterly unflappable Walker - after roughing it up in nine adventures with Detroit's meanest, still one of the most reliable for-hire gumshoes on the job - checks into this case when the murdered heir to an industrial fortune is discovered to have been hoarding enough illegal munitions in his whoopee room to wipe out Zambia.

LEAD: The costume jewelry trade may be Rhode Island's biggest manufacturing employer.

Replacing Rotten Door Sills

Mildly decayed sills can be repaired by using two-part wood hardener and filler.
Worn and badly decayed sills must be replaced.


Tick, Tock, and Now It's Time for Tempo
LEAD: Music is a many-doored mystery.
Performers and scholars, therefore, periodically find themselves fastening attention on only one of its elements in hopes of discovering the key to its secrets.
Until recently, the door we heard knocked at most insistently was marked Sonority, no doubt because that is an aspect of music obviously thrown into focus by the burgeoning original-instrument movement.


STORMING MONTANA'S WILDERNESS
LEAD: WHEN WE FIRST HIT this country, we thought we had died and gone to heaven,'' says Keith Shaw, a retired biology teacher who describes himself as ''a worn-out cowboy.'' Shaw and his wife, Leslie, live with their seven horses on a windy, flat-country plot of range land - an enthusiastic real-estate agent might call it a ''ranchette'' - 20 miles out of the isolated village of Choteau, Mont., on the western edge of the Great Plains.


Reviews/Theater; A Flight From Austerity of the Heart
LEAD: ''The Phantom Lady,'' which is now being offered by the SoHo Rep as an American debut, has a certain documented durability about it.

In an eloquent and often poetic English translation by Edwin

Fashion; Like a Gent
LEAD: OVER THE YEARS, WOMEN HAVE OFTEN BORROWED STYLISH IDEAS FROM A MAN'S CLOSET.
EVER SINCE THE 1920'S, WHEN THE INCOMPARABLE COCO CHANEL LIFTED A MALE FRIEND'S CASUAL CLOTHES AND TURNED THEM INTO DESIRABLE FEMALE ATTIRE, THE FAD HAS COME AND GONE.
IN THE 1970'S, THE PRACTICALITY AND COMFORT OF MEN'S DRESS WAS THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED FOR WOMEN.


Reviews/Theater; Deaths in One Family, An Analysis of Rage
LEAD: ''Walkers,'' an enraged but exasperatingly sketchy new drama by Marion Isaac McClinton, a Minnesota-based playwright, tackles so many serious themes that only a four-hour epic tragedy could begin to develop them into a cohesive dramatic tapestry.
Racism, black self-hatred and inherited patterns of family violence are only the three most obvious issues among those raised by the play, at the Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th


Kafka Gives His Regards to Broadway
LEAD: Franz Kafka did not automatically expect the worst when he learned that his early masterpiece, ''Metamorphosis,'' was to be turned into a Broadway play.
His delicate fantasy had been darkened by so many portentous interpretations by critics - Freudians, Marxists, structuralists and post-structuralists - that a mere transformation from one artistic medium to another might even restore something of its original witty clarity.


Giamatti Is Baseball's Poet
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:

At 40, on the Inside Looking Out
LEAD: ''OVER the Hill!'' The greeting cards with matching balloons and wrapping paper screamed their message in chilling black and white.
How cute.
I giggled and I laughed until I, too, was Over the Hill and sliding down from the apex of my youth.
Frantic at what was beyond my control, I took stock.
I had an 18-year-old mind trapped in a 40-year-old body.


PERSPECTIVES: The Nehemiah Plan; A High-Volume Builder Yearns for Land

FOCUS: Cleveland; Hopes for Downtown Pinned to Housing

Air Travel
LEAD: To the Editor: I wish to take exception to the information you were given by the Air Transport Association to answer a question about carrying a portable oxygen unit aboard a plane (Q &amp; A, Jan. 29).
You said that in some cases passengers can carry their own oxygen on board, provided arrangements are made at least 48 hours in advance and the airline has confirmation from the passenger's physician that oxygen is needed.


The Soviets and the Enmities Within
LEAD: THE unrest that killed at least 19 people in the Soviet republic of Georgia last week is the latest crisis in what is usually called Moscow's ''nationalities problem.'' But as events there showed, the problem is not so much nationalities - a term that suggests loose ethnic groupings -as old and rooted nations, with identities that predate both Russian and Soviet power.


Waterbury Show Reveas a Confounding Sculptor
LEAD: CHRISTOPHER HEWAT'S view of the art world may be summed up as ''if you can't lick it, join it.'' And to judge from statements made by him for a 1983 show in Manhattan, he has done just that by establishing a museum in his cellar, naming it the Musee Ruse and - something that distinguishes it from most other institutions of this kind - showing only forgeries.

Commuting Is the Only Way to Travel
LEAD: A QUESTION I am asked at least once a month is how I can tolerate my three-hour, round-trip commute each weekday.
All that wasted time, they say, when I could be sleeping or spending time with my family or simply relaxing.
I just smile and honestly reply that I thoroughly enjoy commuting.
I take the Metro-North train from Greens Farms, a medium-sized station in Westport, to Grand Central Terminal.

But instead, on Friday afternoon, they met reporters.

She has left behind, in the garage of her home in Howell, N.J., the clunker she's had since high school and a two-year-old mountain bike; they are likely to remain right where they are -unused.
The clunker tires her out quickly because it's heavy and cumbersome; the mountain bike is uncomfortable to ride because it's too big.

Casinos And the Age Of Takeovers
LEAD: DONALD TRUMP'S foray into Caesars World International a while ago has clearly intensified regulatory interest in casino takeovers and somewhat changed the terms of the debate.
Whereas once there was concern simply over quick raids for short-term profits, more notoriously known as greenmail, we are now having to rethink whether longer-term investments by casino companies for control of a competitor are any better.


STREETSCAPES: Public School 157; A Conversion to Serve Another Generation's Needy

S.A.T.'s: Don't Shoot The Test Makers
LEAD: THE college admissions process has become such an ordeal for applicants and parents it is not surprising that scapegoats must be found.

THE FELDMAN PROJECT
LEAD: The mature work of the late Morton Feldman (1926-87) is poorly represented on records.
That makes the appearance of ''Three Voices'' on the New Albion label especially welcome (NA 018; CD only).
But there are peculiarities about this recording, and they pose questions about Feldman's genuinely original esthetic that his performers haven't yet satisfactorily resolved.

Baltimore's Working Waterfront
LEAD: ON a foggy night in Fell's Point the dim light from the iron streetlamps casts a pale glow on the paving stones, and Baltimore's old waterfront neighborhood seems little changed from the 18th century.

A Triumph, Maybe, For Small Science

Mail Calls
LEAD: To the Editor:


HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA: A JOURNEY OF CONSCIENCE
LEAD: ON A CRISP DAY IN BEIJING LAST DECEM-ber, the kind of day when a fine haze of yellow dust swirls above the cinder-colored buildings, I took a taxi to a row of free-market stands where I expected an old acquaintance, a man named Lu Lin, to be waiting.
The taxi, a sleek Toyota, sleeker than the taxis I knew when I lived in the Chinese capital a decade ago, dropped me off in front of a new hotel, near a row of rickety stalls of a sort that did not exist when I was a Beijing-based journalist.

With Love and Hope, Letting Go Of a Son
LEAD: The apartment feels so empty when I come in.
What was once my son's bedroom is now a depository for everything that I now don't know what to do with.
The hooks are still on the walls but all the pictures of the Mets are gone.
The cupboards are practically bare of his clothes and the drawers which used to contain socks and underwear are empty.


Pushing the Sincerity Button
LEAD: At the end of the first side of Madonna's new album, ''Like a Prayer,'' is a song called ''Promise to Try,'' which seems to be about a woman's need to carry on in the face of emotional adversity.
It's not the words that interest me here, however, but the balance between musical cliche and originality in any song.

LEAD: SPEAKERS of the House give their names to public buildings, leave their mark on legislation and play a central role in the games of power in the nation's capital.
But they rarely burst into the consciousness of the public at large.


Changing Rules
LEAD: When Rear Adm.
Richard H. Truly took over the space shuttle program after the Challenger disaster in 1986, astronauts relied on him to insure that safety would be uppermost when flights resumed.

Pitigliano
LEAD: To the Editor: I enjoyed William B. Whitman's article on Pitigliano (Travel, March 12).
However, the author is unjust to Pope Sixtus V. The pope responsible for the influx of Jewish refugees in 1569 was Pius V (1565-72), who in 1569 expelled the Jews from the papal states.
Sixtus V (1585-90) allowed the return of the Jews, including Jewish bankers and moneylenders.

PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: Some 15 years ago, when the unlimited-number-of-games format for world championship matches was hotly debated, the specter of ceaseless play with neither contestant winning the requisite six or ten games arose, but it was not until the 1984 title match between Karpov and Gary Kasparov that the defect actually showed up.


Can Society Tell You What Tastes Good?
LEAD: We are, so it seems, what we are told to eat.

A stirring, vibrant performance in a work that bespeaks the composer's extraordinary natural sophistication.


Marc J. Cohen: Book Designer
LEAD: Marc J. Cohen has been designing book covers for a dozen years, but only now is the spotlight on the 35-year-old Brooklyn native who heads his owns design firm in Manhattan.
This is because he designed the covers for the acclaimed Vintage International series, the first 15 titles of which were published three weeks ago.

Review/Dance; New Works From Donald Byrd Company

But one could not always tell how those moments were connected.


Nancy Ruskin, Lawyer, Weds D. J. Castleman
LEAD: The marriage of Nancy Ruskin, the daughter of State Supreme Court Justice and Mrs.
Alvin R. Ruskin of New Rochelle, N.Y., to Daniel Jeffrey Castleman, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Louis S. Castleman of Lynbrook, L.I., took place last evening at the Fairview Country Club in Greenwich, Conn.
Rabbi Amiel Wohl officiated.


The Red-Eye Disease
LEAD: In Moscow recently, a veteran American expert made a comparison.
Americans want ''to keep up with the Joneses,'' even if it means a frenetic rat race.
Russians worry about ''keeping the Joneskis at our level; why should they get ahead?'' Concern about ''unjustifiable inequality and excessive privilege,'' as a Trilateral Commission report noted, is a major source of resistance to Mikhail


A Return To the Girls On the Train
LEAD: WE did everything I hate about commuting.
And I loved it.
Elaine, Susie and I. It started about five years ago when I was a novice at taking the Harlem Line train from North White Plains to Grand Central Terminal and when I was full of enthusiasm - a good job, at a big company, in the big city.

LEAD: Coach P. J. Carlesimo of Seton Hall said he believes that a National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation of Andrew Gaze would find that neither the Australian Olympian nor the university violated any rules.


Striving to Become a Global No. 2
LEAD: Last week, after months of rumors, the SmithKline Beckman Corporation, based in Philadelphia, and the Beecham Group P.L.C., based in London, announced their intention to merge.
If approved by their shareholders, the new company - to be called SmithKline Beecham - will be the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company after Merck &amp; Company, and would have a research budget expected to exceed $500 million a year.


An Aalto Pilgrimage, on Foot
LEAD: ALVAR AALTO is considered one of the foremost architects of our century, along with Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright.
Architects from all over the world regularly make pilgrimages to see his work.
But his buildings, and most of his designs except for his widely distributed chairs and stools, are far less familiar than the work of other modern masters since most of the best examples are in Finland.


Stieb Going for 1-Hitter Distinction
LEAD: Orel Hershiser captured everyone's attention with his streak of 59 scoreless innings late last season, but on the basis of what-have-you-done-lately, Dave Stieb has to command a major share of everyone's early-season attention.


Bird Says He'd Play
LEAD: Even though he is not in shape to play without tiring easily, Larry Bird, sidelined since Nov. 19 after surgery on both heels, says he would play if the Boston Celtics wanted him to.


DOES YOUR ANALYST READ HENRY JAMES?
LEAD: While psychotherapy has changed since Freud published ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' in 1900, its terminology has not improved.
If anything, it has grown worse in going from ''castration complex'' and ''penis envy'' to ''object relations.'' All of these strike me as indecent ways to describe our struggle for happiness.


Four Shot in Bronx Project; A Drug Link Is Investigated
LEAD: Four people were injured last night in a shooting in a Bronx public housing project, the police said.


Doing Fine
LEAD: After Barbara Bush lost 18 pounds and suffered from eye irritations, doctors concluded that the 63-year-old First Lady had an overactive thyroid gland from a condition of unknown cause called Graves' disease.
Last week, during a two-hour stay at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Mrs.
Bush sipped a solution of a radioactive form of iodine to stop the production of thyroid hormones, which regulate the body's metabolism and other functions.


Nevada
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Seeing Ground Zero in Nevada'' (Travel, March 12) brought back vivid memories.
I was one of ''the national press invited in and allowed to cover'' the first open-to-the-media atmospheric test at Nevada's Yucca Flat on April 22, 1952.
Among the reporters who gathered 10 miles from Ground Zero to see (and feel the hot blast of) the explosion were The New York Times's veteran atomic expert, Bill Lawrence, the broadcaster Lowell Thomas and the Hearst columnist Bob


Prime Time for Communists?
LEAD: To the Editor:


Dogs and the Disabled: New Role
LEAD: ''Charger puts the light on for me,'' said 18-year-old Andrew Cosel of Stony Brook. ''He brings me my crutches.
He also brings me my clothes in the morning.
But I like Charger best when he kisses me.''


TOO YOUNG TO DIE?
LEAD: Ron Rosenbaum's article ''Too Young to Die?'' (March 12), on the juvenile death penalty, is factually precise and emotionally moving.
The issue is the nature and character of a 16-year-old boy who kills.
However, I believe you used the wrong photograph of Heath Wilkins on your magazine cover.
The recent photo of him as a young adult living on death row illustrates more than anything the accelerated maturation effect of such an environment.


Alex Lindsay: Shopping Bag Designer
LEAD: Consider the designer shopping bag.
Consider Alex Lindsay.
To all intents they're synonymous.


Stewart Leads as Dark Halts Heritage
LEAD: Just before it got too dark to see where a shot sent the golf ball, Payne Stewart broke a close struggle with Ken Perry for the lead during the third round of the MCI Heritage Classic today to go three strokes up.


STAGE VIEW
LEAD: ''Forbidden Broadway.'' The very title is clearly meant to suggest something clandestine and a bit wicked.
And in its early years, in 1983 or 1984, Gerard Alessandrini's revue did indeed leave you feeling that you'd been sharing the evening murk with a cabal of performing witches and warlocks, assembled to stick verbal pins into effigies of their theatrical enemies - and inflict pain, if not on their bodies, at least on their egos.


The Season Was Over, Mate
LEAD: Everything seemed fine until Andrew Gaze got on the plane and waved g'day to his new-found mates.
Up to then, we were quite willing to go along with the central story line:


Pamela Kinder Weds Robert Pik
LEAD: Pamela Kinder and Robert Roger Pik were married yesterday in the chapel of the Noroton Presbyterian Church in Darien, Conn., where the Rev.

Her husband is the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Robert R.


Chilly Response At the Public
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Smell of the Popcorn, The Roar of the Mall
LEAD: MALLS are all over Connecticut.
They breed like rabbits and must emit a high-pitched whistle that only teen-agers and adolescents can hear.
Remember that old Victorian on the corner?
It's gone.
They couldn't fit a mall in the one-and-a-half-acre lot so instead they built a mini-mall.

The Rev.
Paul A. Kress officiated.


On NBC, A Second Helping of 'Tattinger's'
LEAD: Restaurant closings aren't normally reported in the entertainment section of newspapers.

Dental School's Closing Puts Students in Quandary
LEAD: FOR Moshen Taheri, everything had fallen into place.
He worked for six years to save money for postgraduate work and to help his younger brother attend school overseas.
He got married and bought a house.
Now, he finally had the opportunity to realize his career ambition.
He would become a dentist by graduating from one of the most respected dental schools in the country.


Agreeableness vs. Anger
LEAD: HOSTILITY CAN BE SUICIDAL.
A host of recent studies come to the same conclusion: People who are chronically hostile, who see the world through a lens of suspicion and cynicism, are particularly vulnerable to heart disease.
The data also suggest that hostility increases the risk of contracting a range of other ailments as well.


CAMPUS LIFE: William and Mary; Spring Break: Annual Blizzard Of False I.D.'s
LEAD: With students returning from spring break, one of the most-talked about topics on campus is a favorite practice of those who make the annual trek to Florida: creating a fake identification card so that those under the legal drinking age of 21 can get into the hot spots.


Demonstration Renews Question of Confict for Newspapers
LEAD: Journalists from The New York Times and The Washington Post who participated in last Sunday's march in Washington in support of abortion rights violated their papers' conflict-of-interest policies, according to editors at both news organizations.


Reviews/Music; Composers From Russia, New and Old
LEAD: The New York University Chamber Music Society has been offering a series called ''The Year of Russian Music'' this season at Merkin Concert Hall.
The latest installment, offered on Thursday evening, was almost two concerts in one, with the first half devoted to duo-piano music of Stravinsky and the second to colorfully scored chamber works by contemporary Soviet composers.


Correction
LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article in some editions of The Week in Review last Sunday on health concerns of women whose mothers took DES in pregnancy misattributed a quotation.
It was Dr.
Emmanuel Friedman of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston who said of DES and cancer: ''Clearly a relationship exists.


Question Of the Week; Should N.B.A. Stars Play in the Olympics?
LEAD: Absolutely not!
It would deprive our student-athletes the opportunity of the dream of a lifetime.
Although we've fallen short of the gold, the American public should not panic.
Attention should be given to the team-selection process, emphasizing players who can score from the perimeter and play good team defense.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  ART'S 'CUTTING EDGE'  To find out what's really new on the contemporary art scene, curators at the Fine Arts Museum of Long Island in Hempstead went to the source of such wisdom.


IN QUOTES
LEAD: ''The settlement insures that the problems that occurred at Drexel will not be repeated.''
Gary Lynch
S.E.C. director of enforcement.


Reviews/Music; Mozart's 9th Concerto By Alicia de Larrocha
LEAD: This week's subscription program at the New York Philharmonic combines the tried and true with more of the same: a brightly played early Haydn symphony (the one called No. 5, though it is not really quite that early); Alicia de Larrocha in Mozart's Ninth Concerto, and Tchaikovsky's ''Pathetique'' symphony, under the experienced stewardship of Gunther


Reviews/Pop; One British Songwriter Takes a Dim View of Love
LEAD: Tanita Tikaram, the 19-year-old British songwriter who performed Thursday at the Bottom Line, sings of conundrums and love in a veiled, breathy contralto.
Her songs are well-turned enigmas, and although she and her band were too constrained onstage, she is already a thoroughly individualistic performer.


Town Acts To Keep Its 'Hams' On the Air
LEAD: AN attempt by local municipalities to regulate the size and location of television satellite dishes and radio antennas has aroused concern among ham radio operators throughout Long Island, who fear that such ordinances will hinder their activities.


Question Of the Week; Should N.B.A. Stars Play in the Olympics?
LEAD: No.
The road from the Olympics to the National Basketball Association is not a two-way street.
First-round draft picks will become glorified bench-warmers while the likes of Ewing, Stockton and the Mailman perform in Barcelona in 1992.
The spirit of the Olympics should be to honor those who are in the process of fulfilling their potential as amateur athletes.


Sports of The Times; Why Nobody Steals Home Anymore
LEAD: Once upon a time stealing home was a cherished art in baseball.
The runner would carefully take a long lead off third base and suddenly, with the pitcher in a deliberate windup, streak for the plate as the ball and the catcher converged on him in a cloud of dirt.
Safe or out?
And if he were safe, he had not only stolen a base, he had also stolen a run.


School Board Elections: A Tool for Teaching
LEAD: For the first time since the New York City school system was decentralized 20 years ago, the Board of Education is trying to turn the local school board elections into a meaningful educational experience for its students and their parents.


PATIENTS' RIGHTS
LEAD: Morton Hunt gave an excellent description of the newly recognized rights of hospitalized patients.
It's a story that deserves attention because so few patients are aware of their rights.


Rearranging the Brancusis
LEAD: The speaker is Kirk Varnedoe of the Museum of Modern Art, the subject is the artist Scott Burton. ''I heard him saying that every sculptor has at the base of his work a central gesture.
He said he always thought about Brancusi's bases as tables that he reached out and squeezed.
I thought: if only I could get across this bear hug, this lived relationship with art.


Court Rules Cigarette Warnings Do Not Block Suits
LEAD: The Minnesota Supreme Court has ruled that warning labels on cigarette packs do not give tobacco companies blanket immunity from lawsuits by victims of lung cancer and other illnesses related to smoking.

TRAVEL ADVISORY
LEAD:  Disney World Eliminating Three-Day Pass


Scott, Gumbel And That Memo
LEAD: To the Editor; Willard Scott  [ '' 'Today,' After That Infamous Memo,'' April 2 ]  is not funny, not faintly amusing, not endearing, not quaint, not cute.
To avoid him I don't watch NBC any more in the morning.
He is really awful and, believe me, no threat to Bryant Gumbel.
MARILYN VALDEN  Greenwich, Conn.


A Loving Salute To the Noblest Of Tall Buildings
LEAD: ''Samuel Bronfman turned whisky into gold, and then gold into bronze with this beautiful building,'' said Brendan Gill, the writer, who was co-chairman of the dinner given by the New York Landmarks Conservancy to salute Phyllis Lambert and the impending landmark designation of the Seagram Building.


LIFESTYLE: Sunday Menu; For Brunches Served Later, Fresh Salmon and Linguine
LEAD: In the days when brunches began at 11 A.M., salmon with linguine and green salad with goat cheese dressing might not have been a menu of choice. but now, brunch is seldom served before noon or 1 on Sundays, and that means most people have had something to eat earlier in the day.


Jordan Does Everything But Bulls Are Slumping
LEAD: There are times when Michael Jordan seems to be everywhere.
Go to the supermarket, and you will see Jordan's picture on a Wheaties box.
Turn on your television, and Jordan may be on the next commercial.


HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES
LEAD:  CLASSICAL  Erik Satie: Collected Items From a Silent Dream.
Alan Marks, piano.
London 425 208-2; CD and cassette.
I wonder if we do not undervalue the tiny and often familiar items included here.
Listening to Alan Marks's admirable simplicity - simplicity being perhaps art's most difficult chore - one begins to hear not just Satie's gentle admonishment of Romantic excess and charming iconoclasm, but also a disembodied purity of considerable power.


A Town That Won't Give Up Its Fight Against an Incinerator
LEAD: RESIDENTS of Preston have been ordered by a Superior Court judge to allow construction of a trash-to-energy plant in their town.
The town's own attorneys have told them that avenues of appeal hold little hope.

Reviews/Pop; A Voice of the Indiana Heartland
LEAD: Early in her show at the Criterion Center's spacious new cabaret at Broadway and 45th Street, Gretchen Cryer recalls her childhood in a tiny Indiana farm community during the 1940's and 50's. ''It was like growing up in a different century - about 1850 or so,'' she says before going on to describe a life that could be frustrating in its social constrictions but that offered a special closeness with nature.


Hollywood Takes to the Global Stage
LEAD: United Artists, the movie studio founded by Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, is being acquired by Australia's Qintex Group.

Correction
LEAD: A picture caption on March 19 about Versailles described the courtyard incorrectly.
It has no steps.


A Land of a Thousand Lakes
LEAD: FINLAND is shaped like a summer squash, with the Arctic Circle the stem, the capital of Helsinki the base, and the lake region the fleshiest part, where the country bellies out.
Just about at Finland's center of gravity is Hankasalmi, home to my Finnish friend and traveling companion as well as our point of departure from which to tour Keski Suomi, or Middle Finland, as the lake region is called.


Sharing the Big Payoff With Uncle
LEAD: They have become a fixture of street life in New York and other cities: long lines of would-be millionaires waiting to buy lottery tickets when the jackpot has reached dizzying heights.
Similarly, the possibility of a lucky streak sends busloads of retirees on their way to Atlantic City.
Still others pin their hopes on bingo games in church halls.


Cards Edge Mets In 10th
LEAD: The revival worked for one day, and then the St.
Louis Cardinals teased out a 3-2 victory over the Mets in 10 innings today.
But the Mets promised that they would not abandon their new lineup or their new spirit, and said they would rise again.


Guetterman's Success Hasn't Changed Him
LEAD: The first time the bullpen gate opened in the ninth inning the other night, Lee Guetterman walked across the outfield grass and heard the thumping of his heart.
He had been pitching professionally since 1981, had been working in the big leagues since 1984, and yet this was something brand new.


For the Pixies, Irony Begins At Home
LEAD: ''I'm in a state, I'm in a state,'' Charles (Black) Francis of the Pixies sighs in one of the 15 songs on ''Doolittle'' (Elektra 60856, LP, cassette and CD); then he howls it.
He never gets around to explaining just what that state is, but he doesn't have to.
The band's music defines it for him better than anything he says.

Three French Farces, One Sensibility
LEAD: ''HUSBANDS, Wives and Lovers'' is the umbrella title of three French farces currently at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale.


Whetting the Appetite
LEAD: Restaurant menus are not exactly paragons of truth in advertising.
More than once, I have been served high-priced ''bay scallops'' that were in fact lower-quality calicos, ''garden-fresh'' vegetables that were harvested from a freezer and saffron sauces that had merely been tinted with turmeric.
For years, I have been suspicious of dishes described as having a Champagne sauce.


Progress Meets Its Match
LEAD: IT has to go, my old friend, companion of my solitude, queen of my cluttered study, my dear 40-year-old manual Royal typewriter.
It got me through graduate school, bravely typing themes of unimaginable dullness.
It fed me when I had to write for my living.


Move for Parental Choice in Schools Gains
LEAD: FOR the last six years, Joyce Caesar has been battling Irvington public school officials over her daughter's education.

The Area's Economy Feels the Austerity at the Pentagon
LEAD: AFTER the years of rapid growth, military contractors in the New York region are having to cut jobs and costs, and devise new strategies to stay competitive.

But the New York region, corporate executives say, faces added competition from companies in the South that have cheaper labor and production costs.

PASTIMES: Gardening; To the Rescue Of Native Plants For Posterity
LEAD: Bill Brumback's work with native plants finds him as busy and as enthusiastic in the field or laboratory as he is in the greenhouse.

'Damn Yankees' in Darien
LEAD: ''THE Pajama Game'' and ''Damn Yankees'' are musical-comedy standards, if not classics, but who can tell you why?
Only the audiences that were there in 1954 and 1955, respectively.


Coach Retires, Plunges Ahead
LEAD: In 1945, Hobie Billingsley won the national collegiate one-meter and three-meter diving titles for Ohio State.

He earned $500 a year for coaching and $3,900 for teaching physical education classes.
He made ends meet by doing comedy diving and trampoline routines with Bruce Harlan, a college teammate.

LEAD: Exports of costume jewelry jumped 26 percent last year, but the news was of little comfort to American producers.
After all, the $111 million in exports was only one-sixth of the value of imports.


TOO YOUNG TO DIE?
LEAD: I in no way condone Heath Wilkins's act of murder; however, to put this boy to death would be morally wrong.
How can a child who never had a chance, who would have had to overcome tremendous obstacles under normal conditions to make something of his life, how can this child be put to death?
He is obviously intelligent, penitent and so devoid of hope that he prefers death to life.

A&amp;E: A Cable Success Story
LEAD: Five years ago, in the formative days of Arts &amp; Entertainment, employees used to pester Nickolas Davatzes, the cable network's president, about his refusal to keep a picture of his family in the office.

Correction
LEAD: An article in the Long Island Weekly last Sunday about an increase in sexually transmitted diseases incorrectly described New York State's law on when sex partners of people who have tested positive for the AIDS antibody may be informed of the results.
Local health departments may notify sex partners only with consent of the person who was tested.


Question Of the Week; Should N.B.A. Stars Play in the Olympics?
LEAD: Yes.
Olympic competition is supposed to represent the highest level of competition.
This ideal is not realized when certain people are prohibited from competing because they are professionals.
Many believe the N.B.A. stars, not the Olympic stars, are the best players in the world.
They should be given the opportunity to prove it.


Ulster Town Mourns Victim of I.R.A.

LEAD: With the exception of the Penske organization, the recent history of two-car teams on the Indy-car circuit has not been good.


Keeping the Trade out of Foreign Clutches
LEAD: The costume jewelry trade has deep roots in Rhode Island.
It dates back to Colonial silversmiths, who hammered out teaspoons and thimbles and who developed a method in the early 1800's for reducing the cost of jewelry by rolling a thin sheet of gold over a cheaper base.
Rhode Island manufacturers still produce more than 60 percent of the nation's costume jewelry.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I have dark-brown Formica on the tops of my kitchen counters.
These tops have become dull and there seems to be a residue of cleaning powder that I am unable to remove.

In the Race For Glory, The Cars Fly
In ''Speed Zone,'' an amiably silly farce about a crazed car race from Washington to Santa Monica, Calif., everyone from the Smothers Brothers to Brooke Shields to Carl Lewis puts in an appearance.
The roster of contestants who will stop at nothing to win a coast-to-coast Cannonball run includes half a dozen mismatched driver-and-passenger teams.
The most diverting couple are Charlie (John Candy) and Tiffany (Donna Dixon), a harassed parking lot attendant who has a way with a car, and a Marilyn Monroe-like starlet whose dream in life is to appear on ''Divorce Court.'' While driving backward, caught between a battalion of advancing police cars and a freight train, the two still maintain enough composure to keep playing movie trivia games.

Optical Industry Braces for Change Under Deregulation
LEAD: The Federal Government plans to sweep away hundreds of laws that regulate the sale of eyeglasses in most states.

AMR Halts Offer
LEAD: The AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, said it was no longer interested in bidding for Wardair Ltd. because Wardair's financial record does not justify a bid.

The Zest of the Uninteresting
LEAD: John Cage creates lectures the way he composes, and that has created a hubbub that has kept the artistic community in the Boston area astir for months.
During the first of his series of Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University, in October, over a third of the audience walked out in the middle, and one local professor emeritus who preferred anonymity remarked that ''it was a testimony to the disastrous state of American education that anybody stayed and listened.


Opponents Fault Koch on City Maintenance
LEAD: Three candidates who are challenging Mayor Edward I. Koch's bid for a fourth term yesterday assailed his administration's record on maintaining bridges and roads and in building housing, schools and other public works projects.


Trouble for Canseco
LEAD: The way Dave Parker sees it, ''when it happens to Joe Blow or Charlie Tuna, it's no big deal.'' But it was neither Joe Blow nor Charlie Tuna who, as the police tell it, left a loaded pistol on the floor by the driver's seat of a locked car parked on a San Francisco college campus.
The auto was in full view of any passer-by curious enough to wonder what a millionaire athlete's $75,000 customized candy-apple-red Jaguar looks like up close.


West Meets East
LEAD: The nearest thing to a Texas oil millionaire that most Japanese had seen was on ''Dallas.'' Last week, they got a closeup of the real thing, T. Boone Pickens, who was visiting Tokyo after buying a 20 percent stake in Japan's largest automotive lighting equipment company, Koito Manufacturing.
In Tokyo's clubby financial world, where takeovers and raiders are rare, Mr.

Reviews/Music; Violin and Balinese Rattles In Counterculture Program
LEAD: Malcolm Goldstein, a violinist and composer who has been active in what might be called counterculture new music for nearly three decades, performed for an audience of 10 (swelled to about twice that number by a group arriving at intermission) at the Penine Hart Gallery in SoHo Friday night.


A Nontraditional Singing For 'Don Giovanni'
LEAD: WHEN the curtain rises Saturday on Christopher Alden's production of ''Don Giovanni,'' opera-goers will see the aristocratic playboy garbed in an up-to-date tuxedo, rather than the traditional 16th-century doublet and hose.


Soviet Economy Not Responding to Change, U.S. Says
LEAD: The Soviet Union has experienced another year of slow economic growth, forcing Mikhail S. Gorbachev to scale back some of his plans for economic change, according to a new report by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency.


Co-op Clues
LEAD: To the Editor:


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Three sides of my house are covered with asbestos shingles.

In New England, Work Can Be Mixed Blessing
LEAD: Despite starting pay as high as $6 an hour, McDonald's and the Holiday Inn find it so hard to find workers here that they routinely import workers from sister businesses in Plattsburgh, N.Y., a 60-minute ferry ride across Lake Champlain.


The Scramble for Eligible Entries
LEAD: To the Editor:


ABOUT BOOKS
LEAD: IT is an irony of research that the exciting discoveries one seeks in far-off places may turn up almost within arm's reach, or so it would seem from the career of William B. Styple, a 28-year-old writer and editor who lives in the Hudson County town of Kearny.


Alaskans Are Urged to Mark Spill With Period of Silence
LEAD: Gov.
Steve Cowper today asked Alaskans to observe five minutes of silence on Sunday in remembrance of the way things were before the Exxon Valdez oil spill fouled hundreds of miles of pristine coastline.

Social Events
LEAD:  For New Leaders


'Soda' Upstages 'Pop,' But Enough is Enough

Easy Goer Up to Par In Wood
LEAD: Easy Goer won the $568,000 Wood Memorial Stakes at Aqueduct yesterday with a performance that may not have looked as impressive as his other triumphs but was actually at least as strong.


For Farmers in Spring, Corn's Promise Is Eternal
LEAD: After a summer of drought, a winter of rising costs and a spring of meager rain, farmers here have plenty of reasons to grumble.
But as they climb aboard their tractors and roll out to their fields these days, the mood is generally upbeat.


Eurocentrism? We Aren't The World
LEAD: ''Eurocentric'' has become a fighting word in academe - and it's about time.
According to a recent front-page story in this newspaper, attempts are being made to teach history and culture in ways that recognize the contributions of non-Europeans.
Those attempts are being resisted in some quarters as voguish and ill informed, as make-work projects for minorities, and as a threat to the cultural achievements of the Western


''People Are Really In a Fishing Mood''
LEAD: THE fishing season, which opened last weekend, is the busiest time of year for George J. Babey.
He is the director of the Aquatic Resources Education program of the State Department of Environmental Protection in Hartford, where he trains volunteers who teach classes in more than a dozen cities and towns around the state on where and how to fish.


Ballet, Yaddo Reap Benefits From Galas
LEAD: The theme was a ''Tropical Heat Wave,'' the place was Lincoln Center and who was on the dance floor? ''Some of the best dancers in the world,'' said Susan Kerr, a member of the organizing committee.
The fifth annual New York City Ballet Dance With the Dancers benefit raised more than $135,000 and drew a crowd of 700.

THE WORLD: Incentives for Warsaw; Washington Offers Help for a Price
LEAD: PRESIDENT BUSH signaled last week that Washington is willing to take a chance on Poland, but only if Poland is willing to accept economic changes that give a much freer rein to private enterprise.


FICTION
LEAD:  PEARL'S PROGRESS.
By James Kaplan. (Knopf, $18.95.) In James Kaplan's first novel, a poet named Philip Pearl accepts a university teaching job in the tiny hamlet of Pickett, Miss.
For this bred-in-the-bone Manhattanite, ''progress'' consists largely of a bumpy and somewhat bemused adjustment to life in the Magnolia State.


Rejuvenating Screens for Spring
LEAD: WITH warm weather comes the rush to reinstall window and door screens.
Many homeowners store screens without repairing them, and so cleaning and rejuvenating them is a common springtime ritual.


Traditions Easily Lose Their Luster
LEAD: Rules worth living by are not numerous.
Yes, the Ten Commandments must be considered.
And Nelson Algren's ''never eat at a place called 'Mom's.' '' To those immutable laws I would add another: never, even if trapped between flights at an airport, buy a book with an embossed cover.
But beyond such rudimentary dicta, human behavior is difficult to keep codified.


Frederick Olivari Marries Kathleen M. Flahive
LEAD: Kathleen Marie Flahive, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
John Henry Flahive of Yardley, Pa., was married yesterday to Frederick Corrado Olivari, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

Pitching Rescues The Mets
LEAD: They may be hitting .226 as a team.
Darryl Strawberry has a hurt right shoulder and isn't playing.
Howard Johnson has a hurt right shoulder and is playing.
And Ron Darling and Bob Ojeda have started seven games, won none, lost six and allowed 49 hits and 28 runs in 30 innings.
But don't bury the Mets yet.


Not Leaving East Rockaway
LEAD: At the risk of making East Rockaway too appealing, I must respond to the article by Claire M. Lynch entitled ''Leaving East Rockaway'' (Opinion, April 9).


Biking in England's Farm Country
LEAD: THE old adage, it's as easy as riding a bicycle, was about to be tested - literally.
I had joined up with a group of bicycling enthusiasts for a weeklong cycling tour called a Bicycle Beano and offered by a company of the same name.


The Caribbean
LEAD: To the Editor: How ironic that Ms.
Wade did not mention the country that offers the best medical care in the Caribbean.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Tennis  Lendl and Edberg in Final: Top-seeded Ivan Lendl and No. 2-seeded Stefan Edberg overcame strong wind yesterday to reach the final of the $752,500 Japan Open in Tokyo.

Life and Death Are the Actors On Her Stage

LEAD: Our Lady of Peace Roman Catholic Church in North Augusta, S.C., was the setting yesterday for the wedding of Sharon Gleeson, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas E. Gleeson of Smoke Rise, N.J., and David Nicholas Cowart, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

Question Of the Week; Who Is The Greatest Fighter Of All Time?
LEAD: It is nearly impossible to compare fighters across weight divisions and generations.
But the quality of their opponents is a reasonable criterion to use in evaluating who was the greatest fighter of all time.
Using this measurement, Sugar Ray Robinson seems the greatest of the great fighters.
Early in his career, he fought such notable opponents as Fritzie Zivic and Jake LaMotta; midcareer he faced Randy Turpin and Bobo Olson.


A Father's Census Reveals A 97 Teddy-Bear Population
LEAD: I TOOK a census the other morning.
Six months after moving, I noticed the corners of our new house beginning to narrow.

Upper West Siders
LEAD: WHEN I GRADUATED IN 1959, administrators at the Trinity School (on 91st between Columbus and Amsterdam) were considering a move eastward across Central Park.

CROSS-SELLING: PEPSI PLUGS 'TOP GUN' FOR A SPOT ON THE TAPE

Q and A
LEAD:  Jazz at Sea


Anglers Return To Reel In Spring
LEAD: IN our family, the most common harbinger of spring is not the return of the swallows to their nests or the sprouting of the crocus.

For Brian Dennehy, Character Tells All
LEAD: Like a stranded whale, Brian Dennehy lies helplessly behind two trash cans, blood pouring down his arm.

President Bush's Hundred Days; Seen Against Ronald Reagan's 2,922 Days
LEAD: George Bush reaches his hundredth day in office Saturday and already the pundits ask: George, what happened to what you call ''the vision thing''?
There's no agenda, complains one political scientist.
No clear goals and convictions, writes another; the President drifts while Mikhail Gorbachev catches the wind.


IS COMPETENCE ENOUGH?
LEAD: Your article on the Kennedy School of Government sheds much light on what's gone wrong, not just there, but also at the Harvard Business School (''Is Competence Enough?'' by J. Anthony Lukas, March 12).

Life and Death on Sulawesi
LEAD: AFTER a walk along a path between rice paddies skimmed by large black butterflies with turquoise tails, we stood at the bottom of a limestone cliff.
Above us, on two long balconies dug into the rock, tau-tau, effigies of the dead, leaned against a rail.
The effigies' wooden hands were extended, their clothes tattered, their bags for traveling into the next world slung over their shoulders, and their wide eyes looked down at us.


Upper East Side
LEAD: THERE SEEMS ALWAYS TO HAVE been a perception of the Upper East Side of Manhattan as the private preserve of the rich and privileged, its residents of a certain wealthy, conservative and snobbish persuasion.

A Building With the Razzle but Not the Dazzle
LEAD: Like any artist who produces a work of utter brilliance, an architect who designs a truly great building is forever after constrained by it.
Not only in the obvious way - does what comes along later measure up to the triumph? - but in a more subtle way, too, in the expectation that all future work will somehow continue to explore the same themes as the great achievement.

LEAD: The spectacular gold jewelry and gilded artifacts made in West Africa over the last 200 years are usually outnumbered in art exhibitions by bronze, wood, stone and ivory objects from this sub-Saharan region.

EDNA O'BRIEN'S RITUALS
LEAD: If Edna O'Brien practiced any of the major religions, you would be too scared of repercussions to make fun of her observances (''Reveling in Heartbreak,'' by Richard B. Woodward, March 12).

Review/Opera; Pavarotti and Battle in Met 'Elisir'
LEAD: Except for three passages, Nemorino in ''L'Elisir d'Amore'' is nearly a perfect role for Luciano Pavarotti, who sang it at the Metropolitan Opera Friday night in the season's first performance of the work.
It doesn't overtax the stamina or volume of his voice (both were more than ample Friday); it isn't too high; it benefits from his lively, pointed diction, and it gives generous opportunities for both of his strongest traits as an actor - clowning and simple pathos.

Tape Recorders Bound Ahead
LEAD: A lock-and-key relationship exists between recording tape and the tape recorders for which they are intended.

PROTEST IN THE SOVIET REPUBLICS
LEAD: Democracy is the big threat to the Muscovite empire, not nationalism, as Zbigniew Brzezinski argues in his article ''Will the Soviet Empire Self-Destruct?'' (Feb. 26).

The Speed of Sound: A Matter of Fact
LEAD: In Robert P. Levine's essay ''When the Ballpark Cost Just a Nickel''  [ Westchester Opinion, March 26 ] , he states, in an otherwise well-written piece, that he thinks sound at sea level travels 550 feet a second.
Of course, he does parenthesize his very inaccurate thought.
If he has forgotten what he should have learned in his high school ''physics'' class and doesn't have sufficient reference volumes in his personal book collection, he at least could have made a trip to his local library.

LEAD: No one can deny Ali's superiority in hand speed and ring mobility.

Since joining the Bengals in 1983 as a rookie out of Oklahoma, he had been in drug rehabilitation five times.


Philippine Rebels Say They Killed U.S. Colonel
LEAD: Communist rebels said today that they killed an American army officer on Friday because the officer was a ''direct participant'' in the Government's counterinsurgency program.


In Buying the Ring, Togetherness
LEAD: On a recent rainy Saturday, one of the many couples drifting in and out of Cartier on Fifth Avenue was John Le Boutillier, who works at an advertising agency, and his fiancee, Suzy Shore, an employee of the New York City government.
At Tiffany's the same day, the counters were crowded with couples peering into the cases, many clutching Tiffany's ''How to Buy a Diamond Guide.


PASTIMES: Bridge
LEAD: The longest bridge event ever played, and in many ways the most remarkable, ended eight days ago.
It was the Marathon Bridge Battle of the Sexes, played at the Cavendish Club in New York City and the Club du Bridgeur in Paris.
It lasted two weeks.


T. H. Pough Weds Miss Glendinning
LEAD: At St.
Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in New York, Victoria Jean Glendinning was married yesterday to Tristram Hooper Pough.
The Rev.
Allan Arthur Hinman and the Rev.
Judith Baumer officiated.
Barbara Lundy was her sister's matron of honor, and William Schmidt was the best man.


Clearing the Air in the Schools
LEAD: THE signs ringing New Jersey's schools that indicate that one is entering a ''drug-free school zone'' proclaim a worthy goal.
A bill recently passed the Assembly by a 59-10 vote that would move our schools significantly closer to becoming genuinely drug-free.
Of equal importance, the bill controls tobacco smoke pollution in the public schools and abates the health hazard this material causes.


THE WAY WE LIVE NOW
LEAD: HEN ANTHONY TROLLOPE published ''The Way We Live Now'' in 1875, no one expected his book to be anything other than a work of fiction.
But to tackle the same topic today, we must confront a world grown conditioned to fact.


Pageants and Exhibitions Highlight the Celebration
LEAD: These are some of the events scheduled to celebrate the bicentennial of George Washington's inauguration as the first President of the United States.
Today

For Two of America's Arab Allies, The Worst Wounds Are Economic
LEAD: OVER the last month, the leaders of Egypt and Jordan, the linchpins of Washington's diplomacy among the Arabs, have visited the United States as part of the search for a Middle East peace.
At home, their people are locked in a less exalted quest called getting by.


Sticking to Guns
LEAD: Adnan M. Khashoggi may well rue the day he set foot outside the nice, straightforward international arms trade and tried to help his old friend, former President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines, make some real estate investments.
At the request of United States officials who are seeking his extradition, the Saudi financier was arrested in Switzerland last week on charges that he engaged in ''illegal property dealings'' involving at least $103 million that Mr.


Tired Nets Finish Tiresome Season
LEAD: When asked if he was glad the Nets' season was over, Roy Hinson didn't hesitate.


Free Spirits
LEAD: To the Editor:


A Sprightly Portable, but Flawed
LEAD: Is any advance in portability worth jeopardizing the integrity of your data?
Many people would say no, but one intriguing machine introduced at the Comdex trade show in Chicago earlier this month poses that question bluntly.


VIOLENT PROTESTS REPORTED IN CHINA
LEAD: A week of growing anti-Government protests turned violent for the first time on Saturday, spreading to the central Chinese city of Xian, where protesters attacked the provincial Government headquarters, injuring 130 officers and burning 20 houses, the official New China News Agency reported this morning.


Rock and Roll Is a Fundamental
LEAD: SOMETHING unexpected happened to me on my way to an empty nest.

Reviews/Music; Contemporary Ensemble From Manhattan School
LEAD: Wednesday evening's concert at the Manhattan School of Music was perhaps more useful to its performers than to its audience.
That this institution, through the Manhattan Contemporary Ensemble, involves students in full-scale attempts at new and recent music speaks well for its program, especially in a larger music-education system overly concerned with the past.


Jurors Mark 2 Years on California Abuse Case
LEAD: Jurors marked the occasion with a cake as the McMartin preschool molestation trial ended its second year Thursday.
But no one was rejoicing at the length of the case, which is about to become Los Angeles's longest trial.


Girls' Night Out
LEAD: THEY COULD JUST AS WELL BE piled on a twin bed in flannel nightgowns, engrossed in a half-gallon of Heavenly Hash.
But here they are in the middle of Manhattan, four successful women in their mid-30's, their hard-won figures decked out in Stephen Sprouse and Saint Laurent and their iron wills dissolving before a feast of sweets at Le


REAGAN TO VISIT JAPAN
LEAD: Former President Ronald Reagan will make his first overseas visit since leaving the White House when he goes to Japan in October.
Details of the trip, announced Thrusday by the Fujisankei Communications Group, were not made public, but the Fujisankei statement said Mr.
Reagan would meet with Japanese leaders.


PASTIMES: Numismatics
LEAD: Good gamblers are a cautious bunch.
They figure the odds to two or three-decimal places and know the payback to the exact penny.
Nothing irks them more than to be paid in spurious or devalued currency - it throws off their calculations.
In the mid-1800's gamblers were faced with a slight problem.


At Your Service
LEAD: ANYONE WHO HAS BRAVED THE COSMETICS area of a department store knows the hazards: the frenzied activity, the spritzes of fragrance, the shouts, the hawking.
All of this hullabaloo can't disguise the fact that service at the counter is spotty, at best.


What's Happened to Middle Class
LEAD: IT SEEMED SIMPLE ENOUGH, ON THE face of it: find, identify and characterize the middle class in the New York metropolitan area.
Sort of like stalking gazelles in the Serengeti just before the rains.
Just zero in on the middle-class multitudes and pinpoint the epicenter of their middle-class consciousness.


Correction
LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the crush at a British soccer stadium in which more than 90 people were killed misstated sanctions imposed on some British teams.
English club teams and their supporters have been banned from the three major soccer competitions in Europe, but the English national team and club teams from elsewhere in Britain remain eligible.


Catherine McMahon To Wed Next Month
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Charles F. McMahon of West Orange, N.J., have announced May wedding plans for their daughter Catherine Mary McMahon and Thomas Michael Toomey, 1982 graduates of Stonehill College.
The prospective bridegroom is a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas E. Toomey of Manchester, Conn.


Lisa Frank and Maureen Fullam - Trompe L'oeil Artists
LEAD: Does Donald Trump like trompe l'oeil?
The question arose when Lisa Frank and Maureen Fullam were bidding on a decorative painting job for an interior court of the Plaza hotel.
Part of their proposal was to paint a shimmering blue-green rectangle on the roof of the grand ballroom so that guests at the hotel, looking down from their rooms, would think of a swimming pool.


The I.R.A.'s Political Allies Run Against Its Violent Side
LEAD: SINN FEIN, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, is finding itself handicapped as it prepares for elections in Northern Ireland next month.

BASEBALL
LEAD:  THE CUBS OF '69: Recollections of the Team That Should Have Been.
By Rick Talley. (Contemporary Books, $17.95.) The only time I ever played hooky, I skipped school in 1969 to watch the Chicago Cubs play the Cincinnati Reds.
It was June, and I sat with the official Bleacher Bums, tormenting Pete Rose.


THATCHER PUTS THE LID ON
LEAD: It seems queer that James Atlas's otherwise fine discussion of censorship in Great Britain under Mrs.
Thatcher's Government omits any mention of the notorious Clause 28 (''Thatcher Puts the Lid On,'' March 5).


IS COMPETENCE ENOUGH
LEAD: My only complaint about Anthony Lukas's article on Harvard's Kennedy School was its gratuitous swipe at Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis's failed bid for the Presidency.
Mr.
Dukakis has both gut-level values and a mastery of management technocracy.
If anyone ''regressed'' in ''the grubby business of getting elected,'' it was George Bush for having unleashed the Ailes-Teeter-Atwater smear team.


'The Diaries of Adam and Eve': Its Genesis, From Its Creator
LEAD: Mervyn Rothstein, who has never before interviewed a celebrated 19th-century American literary figure, would like to thank David Birney, Everett Emerson's ''Authentic Mark Twain,'' Hal Holbrook's ''Mark Twain Tonight!'' and John Bartlett for their assistance in conversing with Mr.
Twain.

LEAD: FOR three years, one prominent group of people at concerts in Theater A at the State University of New York's campus here could not hear the music - the musicians themselves.


WHAT'S DOING IN: Portland, Ore.
LEAD: Sprouting from the banks of the Willamette River, between the beaches of the Pacific Ocean and the year-round ski slopes of Mount Hood, the traditionally outdoorsy city of Portland, Ore., has evolved into one of the Pacific Northwest's most progressive urban centers.


The Hidden Suburbia: Despite Problems, the Spirit Survives
LEAD: THE picture of suburbia is a familiar one.
There's the comfortable house on the tree-lined street inhabited by an attractive couple and their lovely children.
We know without being told that there are two cars in the garage, toys for both adults and children, little luxuries to make the easy life even easier.

John Hurt Zeroes In on Another Outsider
LEAD: John Hurt is an actor who specializes in playing outsiders.

Travlish
LEAD: To the Editor: Elaine Kendall's ''A Short Course in Travlish'' (Travel, March 5) includes Fodor's Travel Guides with most other guidebooks that use ''only words that elicit positive responses, favoring those that conjure up visions of comfort, prosperity and beauty.''


NONFICTION
LEAD:  LIVES ON THE BOUNDARY: The Struggles and Achievements of America's Underprepared.

Editors' Note
LEAD: An article headed ''The Life Style of the East Side 5-Year-Old'' appears today in New York, New York, part 2 of The Times Magazine.
As its introduction specifies, the article is based on the lives of several children, but the narrative combines them into two, called Nick and Kim.


Reviews/Music; The Mystical Celibidache Conducts
LEAD: One of the exciting aspects of New York's musical life is the event at which everybody who presumes to be anybody converges to check out the latest sensation.
If the sensation happens to be controversial, all the better: then the everybody-anybodies stand around during the intermission and afterwards, when the mere audience is bravoing away, and discuss the concert with gushing enthusiasm, heated animation, bored indifference or cynical disdain.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Three sides of my house are covered with asbestos shingles.
They are in good condition, but we want to put up cedar wood shingles.
A contractor recommended putting up furring strips over the asbestos shingles, then nailing the cedar shingles to these.
Should the asbestos shingles be removed first?


Now Hear This: Ads That Talk in Magazines
LEAD: MAGAZINE readers may soon hear - as well as read - advertisements touting perfumes, cigarettes or hotels.


Closing Loopholes to Save Neighborhoods
LEAD: THE view from the back door of Pamela Keating's one-family home on 157th Street in Flushing, Queens, is of a big hole where two other single-family houses once stood.
They were torn down last winter, and what will soon rise from the hole is a brick block of a building containing eight apartments.

Canal Commission Tightens Rules On Development
LEAD: FOR more than 150 years after the creation of the Delaware and Raritan Canal in 1830, the scenery along the 60-mile route changed little.
Small settlements like Griggstown, Raven Rock and Kingston cropped up along the route, but they were little more than crossroads separated by miles of farmland and uninhabited natural areas.

LEAD: Patricia Kim Weber, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Stanley Roger Weber of Palisades, N.Y., was married yesterday to Roger Victor Meier, a son of Frederic Meier and Deborah Willen Meier, both of New York.

Knicks and Nets Go Separate Ways
LEAD: It was Alumni Night at Madison Square Garden last night and the Knicks relived the feats some of the stars of their past had recorded.


Things Happened When Jazz Got on Screen
LEAD: Film and jazz are no strangers, dating back - if one takes liberties with the word jazz - to Al Jolson in the 1927 movie ''The Jazz Singer.'' Lately a spate of films have focused squarely on jazz (''Let's Get Lost,'' '' 'Round Midnight'' and ''Bird''), but between Jolson and ''Bird,'' jazz has made the odd appearance, sometimes in a starring role, sometimes as atmospheric seasoning.


Montefalco, Perched Over Umbria
LEAD: ITS name roughly translates as ''a falcon on its nest,'' and for centuries Montefalco has afforded travelers to Italy the most panoramic view of the Umbria region.
Indeed, perched atop a mountain lining Italy's Clitumnus Valley, Montefalco has also been called the Balcony of Umbria.
From inside the ramparts of this tiny 14th-century village, one can see for miles - to Perugia and Assisi in the north, Trevi in the east and


IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester; Many Shop Around, but Few Stay to Buy

Comics as Inspiration: Are We Having Fun Yet?
LEAD: I the book ''Krazy Kat: A Novel in Five Panels,'' Jay Cantor's update of George Herriman's celebrated comic strip, the angry, brick-throwing Ignatz Mouse writes an indignant letter to Offisa Bull Pup that expresses his frustration with his two-dimensional status:

Claiming A Culture
LEAD: IT'S AN EARLY SPRING EVENING IN Brooklyn, and Nur Ali is moving amid the cheerful clutter of what she calls her ''mission shop,'' the Admiral Family Circle, named after the Islamic collective of which she is a part.
While Mrs.
Ali, 50, calls out advice to Ahmad, a tailor and member of the collective, she rearranges racks of African-influenced dashikis and bubahs, answers the intermittent ringing of a phone and searches through merchandise at the front of the store in order to locate a tajj - a pillbox-shaped leather-and-cloth hat - for her son A.


Punchless Yanks Now 0-5 Against Indians
LEAD: By the time Tommy John walked off the mound and headed toward the dugout late this afternoon, the game had essentially been played and lost.

CAMPUS LIFE: Texas; Student's Killing Brings Rethinking Of Trips to Mexico

IN THE VALLEY OF THE KILLER DOLLS
LEAD: THere are skeletons in Barbie's family closet.
The killer doll, a creepy and ludicrous idea, has inspired plenty of bad films and a very few enduring ones.
The best are witty about the silly genre they take advantage of.


Giants Want Runners and Blockers
LEAD: The Giants have the makings of a winning team, yet they are not good enough to become a Super Bowl team again simply by filling one or two gaps.
They have many holdover offensive linemen and running backs, yet those positions appear to be their two priorities in the National Football League draft today and tomorrow.


Ms. Park Married In a Jersey Event
LEAD: Heijung Park and Michael Colameco, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Schooling in Japan Offers Some Insights
LEAD: IN cinderblock buildings, 45 students, all dressed alike, sit in barren classrooms and learn from paperback texts with no pictures.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. We are planning a one-room addition to our vacation house.
It will have a cathedral ceiling and be exposed on three sides.
The house has 2-by-4 construction with fiberglass insulation, which we don't feel is adequate.
Would we better off building the new walls with 2-by-6's to allow room for more insulation, or should we build with 2-by-4's and use rigid Styrofoam boards for insulation?


Restored Budget Aid Praised
LEAD: THE managers of social services programs in the county praised the new state budget last week, pleased that devastating cuts had been averted for at least a year.

Arthur Kennedy: Comeback for a Curmudgeon
LEAD: At 75, Arthur Kennedy's throaty cackle seems more orchestral, and surely more wicked, than it did when he ventured it professionally in ''Lawrence of Arabia,'' ''Elmer Gantry,'' ''Peyton Place'' and many of his 70-odd other films.
There he was, at lunch in the city he now calls home, cackling his way through Laurence Olivier stories and Marlene Dietrich stories on a recent afternoon, when Pat Hogan - his favorite waitress in the Pavilion Restaurant on Liberty

When Duke Sat Down At the Orchestra

What is not usually mentioned is that Ellington helped to shape these distinctive qualities by the way he used them in his arrangements.


BIG LITTLE MAGAZINES: A READER'S GUIDE
LEAD: Resembling a Rorschach test, ''literary journal'' is a fuzzy little inkblob of a name.
To a romantic, it might bring to mind The Paris Review, its very title carrying the whiff of Hemingway paring down sentences at some Left Bank cafe in the 1920's.
Never mind that the journal was founded in the 1950's and has an office overlooking the East River.

In Search of a Richer Lazard
LEAD: Lazard Freres &amp; Company has always marched to a different drummer on Wall Street.
Take their offices.
Located far from the downtown financial district, Lazard has no mahogany-paneled suites, English antiques or Oriental rugs.
Instead, its Rockefeller Center offices can best be described as dingy.
Carpets are frayed, walls are barren.


A Flag-Flapping Salute to the First Inaugural

When TV Tickled the Public's Fancy

The ceremonies, which included the first televised speech by a President, Franklin D.


London
LEAD: To the Editor: As a follow-up to the reply to the question (Q &amp; A, March 26) concerning apartment rentals in London, I would like to make your readers aware of what may be the most comprehensive source on the subject.
It is the British Tourist Authority's booklet ''Apartments in London 1988/89.'' While it does not attempt to rate or recommend any of the properties it lists, the 60-page booklet does include both agencies through which apartments can be rented and apartment houses that specialize in short-term rentals.


The 'Look' That Makes the Yankees
LEAD: THE streets bordering the Raleigh Athletic Equipment Company on Columbus Avenue here are narrow and deserted.

The Utah Fusion Circus
LEAD: For the last month, scientists around the world have been poised between deepest doubt and highest hope.
The University of Utah claimed on March 23 that two researchers had learned how to fuse atomic nuclei at room temperature.
Yet despite a month of attempts to repeat the Utah experiment, no one yet knows if the claim will evaporate in smoke and recrimination or prove the first step to a revolutionary new source of energy.

Walks Focus on a Wildflower
LEAD: LAST spring, my 5-year-old and I enjoyed the simple pleasures of regular walks in our neighborhood.
We had a 3-month-old baby who loved her stroller ride, and so the three of us set off.
The route was the same each time, but anticipation was the motivation, especially on those days when we weren't sure we wanted to walk at all.

Corporate Day Care Pays for Itself
LEAD: Your recent article (April 16) titled ''On-Site Day Care Puts Companies to Test'' unfortunately perpetuates the myth that high quality, affordable, on-site child care is unattainable.
This is just not true.


For Punchball Players, Stickball Is for Sissies
LEAD: The New York Times must be enamored of stories on stickball.
In my opinion it is a sissified sport.

City Charter: Test Driving A New Model
LEAD: A MONTH after the United States Supreme Court ruled that the New York City Board of Estimate ran afoul of the Constitution, the Charter Revision Commission began considering how to rearrange local government.
A plan proposed last week by the commission's chairman, Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., would weave an intricate system of checks on mayoral authority, giving a legislature - the City Council and perhaps another house - more influence, and community boards and voters more information on city policies and programs.


Woman Trapped in Car Wash
LEAD: A woman who stopped at a car wash about 2 A.M.
Friday was locked in by accident and suffered carbon monoxide poisoning when she left her automobile engine running, the police said.

PERSPECTIVES: Lower-Density Zoning; Changing the Rules for Attached Housing
LEAD: ZONING changes can have far-reaching consequences.
Those that have been proposed by staff members of the Department of City Planning, and are currently under consideration by the City Planning Commission, are potentially more far-reaching in their consequences citywide than any since 1961, when the current city zoning amendment was revised.


Jackson Says the Crowd Helped, Too

Science, Politics And Survival
LEAD: LIKE the snail darter and the Furbish lousewort, the spotted owl was added last week to a small but distinguished list of flora and fauna that have exercised political and economic influence far out of proportion to their size or nominal worth.


POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
LEAD: WHEN WILLIAM THOURLBY, A NEW York image consultant, says George Bush has ''taken an adjustment,'' he isn't talking tailors' talk.
Thourlby, a former actor who bills himself as a wardrobe counselor to Presidents, is using a fancy thespian term for slipping into character - one that aptly describes this President's 100-day metamorphosis from a modestly outfitted Everyman to an icon of power in pin stripes.

Bowing Out
LEAD: On his silver jubilee as chief conductor and artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1980, Herbert von Karajan talked of his love for his players and their relationship ''as a family.'' As has happened in some families, Mr.

CAMPUS LIFE: Illinois; Being Accepted: Gay Students Attend a Prom

TALKING: Keeping Cool; Regulations Governing Equipment

HOMOSEXUALITY: WHO AND WHY?
LEAD: Melvin Konner writes that his friend ''changed his sexual orientation.'' However, it is far from clear that anyone can change so essential a part of his personality.
Some sex therapists have advised their lesbian and gay patients to use homosexual fantasies during heterosexual behavior, which is hardly a change in sexual orientation.

LEAD: As the choking summer air pollution season nears, the air over the Los Angeles basin, the worst in the country, is as thick with the politics of smog as with the smog itself.


HUMAN RIGHTS IN GUATEMALA
LEAD: Mr.
Kinzer might have mentioned the sad tale of the so-called model villages in Guatemala.
In the name of national security, the army raids the countryside, burning villages and forcing people into ''model villages.'' Scattered among these enclosures, the Indian people are forced to live among Indians of different languages and backgrounds, in a confined and regimented area, under constant surveillance.


PASTIMES: Stamps
LEAD: Two of the best-defined subsets of collectors are those who care about the backs of stamps, and those who do not.
Collectors who care, check whether an older stamp has its original gum, or whether there is a piece of a hinge stuck on.
Collectors who do not care, are content with a fine design or clear cancel on the face.


PASTIMES: Bridge
LEAD: It used to be true, in both North America and the rest of the world, that experts and administrators were in separate groups: The experts did not administer, and the administrators were not experts.
But that trend has dwindled, with improved results in a variety of ways.
It seems to be true that smart players make smart organizers when they are willing to find the time and make the effort.


When the Setting Upstages the Sound
LEAD: THE genuine music festival is an immovable feast where site and sound are inextricable.
They go together like Yin and Yang, Laurel and Hardy, heads and tails, breathing in and out.
Thinking back over decades of summertime traveling in pursuit of the festival high, I find that memory is sharpest where the music and the milieu intermingle and fuse.


CAMPUS LIFE: Boston; For Politics or Profit, the Free Microphone Awaits
LEAD: ''When they announce George Bush's name, we all ought to get up and walk away,'' said one undergraduate, her voice booming through the loudspeaker as she urged her classmates to vote with their feet at Boston University's May 21 graduation ceremony, at which the President is to speak.


Baseball; Darling Gets First Victory of '89

Looking To the Court
LEAD: It will be summer, in all likelihood, before the Supreme Court decides the Missouri abortion case.

A Reminder of Teheran of Yesteryear
LEAD: THE caption under a photograph taken at Great Neck's Colbeh restaurant on a recent Saturday night could well read: ''Teheran before the fall of the Shah.'' Long Islanders familiar with Mineola's Portuguese colony and Lindenhurst's Germans may be unaware of Great Neck's Iranian Jews.

LEAD: Hale Smith, a composer himself, reminded us before Wednesday evening's New Music for Young Ensembles concert at Weill Recital Hall that ''writing easy music is not easy.''

LEAD: Q. We are planning a one-room addition to our vacation house.
It will have a cathedral ceiling and be exposed on three sides.
The house has 2-by-4 construction with fiberglass insulation, which we don't feel is adequate.
Would we better off building the new walls with 2-by-6's to allow room for more insulation, or should we build with 2-by-4's and use rigid Styrofoam boards for insulation?

DOUBLE STANDARDS
LEAD: The silhouette of a pair of pitched metal roof-lines set side by side recalls the simple form of so-called shotgun houses, those shacklike dwellings often built for sharecroppers in the South.
The image is one that New York architect Walter Chatham uses to describe his own beach house.
Built in Seaside, a new town in Florida's Panhandle region, it was designed to conform to the town's 6-year-old urban codes drawn up by Coconut Grove town planners Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk.

What It Means To Be a Sex Object
LEAD: In reference to ''On Being a Sex Object'' (Long Island Journal, April 2), Women Against Pornography feels it is essential to call attention to what being a sex object really means.
Obviously, the school administrator who offered students a workshop with Ms.

Fresh Shipments From the Knitting Factory
LEAD: The Knitting Factory is a room just about wide enough to swing a guitar overhead, with a window behind the stage overlooking a blank stretch of East Houston Street in lower Manhattan.

LEAD: COUNTY officials are planning to build a technologically sophisticated plant that would convert solid wastes to reusable products.

Is It Funny? Read the Program
LEAD: Wit in music is too rare to constitute a genre.
It does turn up here and there - in the operas of Mozart and certain songs of Hugo Wolf, for example - but what passes for musical wit is rarely fine-tuned enough to deserve the name.
Understood, all musical levity is in the ear of the beholder.
Listener A slaps a thigh over the very idea of the late Dennis Brain performing a concerto for garden hose; B merely groans.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. We are planning a one-room addition to our vacation house.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  HEART'S DESIRE: The Best of Edward Hoagland.
Essays From Twenty Years. (Summit Books, Paper, $12.95; Cloth, $24.95.) Unlike many writers on nature and the out-of-doors, Edward Hoagland is never guilty of concocted mysticism or self-serving, suspect rapture of the deep (or heights).
His writing, whether its subject is woodland or the crowded waterways around Manhattan - both landscapes are included in this volume - is distinguished by his direct, intense observations and the associations to which they give rise.


Outdoors; New Limit for Striped Bass in Northeast
LEAD: Striped bass angling has begun in some areas of the Northeast, and fishermen should remember that minimum-length limits for the species have once again inched upward.

IN THE GRASP OF ROMANCE: MY LIFE AS FIONA HILL
LEAD: I read my first historical romance in a fog composed of equal parts Darvon and pain.
I was 20 years old, a junior in college, and I had just had my wisdom teeth removed.
Realizing I'd be too woozy to read my assigned Keats and Coleridge, I had plucked the book at random from a rack of paperbacks at the drugstore; propped up on three pillows, I opened it hopefully.


An Awareness of Disabled Workers
LEAD: Some effects of the 1973 Rehabilitation Amendments Act are familiar by now: curb cutouts and ramps to accommodate wheelchairs, special stalls in restrooms, ''kneeling'' buses and Braille buttons for elevators.
But a revision of the act may lead to profound changes in computers as well.


Data and Comment About Smoking
LEAD: Professional antismoker Karen J. Fersht made a number of misleading statements in her recent interview  [ ''Westchester Q&amp;A,'' March 19 ] .

ALL IN THE FAMILY
LEAD: One of the highest compliments a child can pay a parent is to choose his or her profession.
In the food world, the passing of the baton from parent to child is often more natural than in other fields.
A child absorbs the smells, tastes and skills as an ordinary part of life at home.
Growing up, though, he or she must overcome the challenge facing any child of famous parents: how to take those skills and establish an independent style.


Edith A. Tarbox, A News Anchor, Weds Executive

LEAD: ''Bar-Barre,'' presented by the Transe Express Circus of Crest, France, on Wednesday night in a basement rehearsal studio at the John Houseman Theater, takes place in a small bar with a mechanical football game.

LEAD: The Gramm-Rudman law to reduce the budget deficit requires a balanced budget by 1993.
Under the act, next year's deficit target is $100 billion - which was met earlier this month in an agreement between Congress and the Bush Administration.
Critics argue that the act is flawed and that the budget agreement was achieved through accounting tricks.

1945: THE FIRST 'INSTANT' PAPERBACK
LEAD: Only nine days after the sudden death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt from a cerebral hemorrhage, a new book about the man and his accomplishments went on sale. ''Franklin Delano Roosevelt: A Memorial,'' a 249-page paperback, sold for 25 cents and was published by Pocket Books.
Pocket's editor in chief, Donald Porter Geddes, spent a long weekend gathering and editing the text - biography, tributes, poetry, photographs - with the cooperation of scholars and news organizations.


When a Lawyer Steals Your Money
LEAD: Most people think of their lawyers as professionals who are there to help solve their problems, not create new ones.
Yet occasionally, disreputable attorneys will fleece clients.
They will make off with the down payment on a house from an escrow account, surreptitiously settle a personal injury case and steal the settlement or misappropriate the funds in a child's trust.


Russians Out, Afghan Chief Gains By Painting Rebels as Foreign Tool
LEAD: In a political turnabout, President Najibullah of Afghanistan is using the pullout of Soviet troops who backed his Communist Government through 10 years of civil war to portray himself as a true Afghan and Muslim nationalist and to paint the Islamic guerrillas as agents of foreign powers.


Review/Jazz; Yosuke Yamashita Reshapes Some Oldies
LEAD: Yosuke Yamashita, a Japanese pianist who rarely gets to New York, played a set at Sweet Basil on Thursday night in which he attempted, as many younger pianists have, to reconcile the fundamentally different esthetics of the pianist Cecil Taylor and the mainstream jazz tradition.
It is an odd spectacle: a pianist in 1989 trying to incorporate the style of a pianist who came to prominence in the 1960's with a tradition set in the mid-1940's.


INQUIRY TO REOPEN IN SCIENCE DISPUTE
LEAD: The National Institutes of Health and a Congressional subcommittee are reopening inquiries into questions of fraud and tampering with data in a controversial research paper whose authors included the Nobel laureate Dr.

CAMPUS LIFE: Fairfield; Hello Troll, Meet Puddles, Or Is It Flipper?
LEAD: For college students, freshman year inevitably starts with polite introductions, handshakes, ''where are you from'' and ''what's your major.'' But it quickly becomes a time for one of the hottest competitions on campus: the nickname game.

LEAD: Cathleen Anne Kirk, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

John Faris, a cousin of the bridegroom, performed the ceremony at the Roman Catholic Church of the Annunciation in Crestwood, N


20,000 Leagues Under, Into and Across the Atlantic
LEAD: The Grand Canyon is a strange place, one might at first imagine, to serve as the inspiration for a mind-expanding TV series about the geology and natural history of the Atlantic Ocean.
But on second thought, not so strange - providing one comes armed with some intelligence about plate tectonics and the adult education of Ron Redfern.


This Time, the Army Isn't Even in the Wings
LEAD: AT first glance, the economic chaos and political uncertainty that have taken hold in Argentina might seem to make the country vulnerable to a military coup.
But even though Argentines can only wonder what will happen on or after May 14, when presidential elections are scheduled, or by inauguration day at the end of the year, the risk of a coup does not appear to be on people's minds.

To which the former world champion from the Soviet Armenian Republic replied, ''Which Russian team?''


Police Authority And Weaponry
LEAD: R. H. Hodges' April 2 letter, on the choice of semiautomatic pistols for many police departments  [ ''Police Turning to 9-mm.
Guns to Fight Crime,'' March 12 ]  was informative in many aspects, but did not respond to the fears voiced in the original report by Dorothy L. DiCintio, to the effect that the police trend toward more firepower would lead to the shooting of ''more innocent people.


Question Of the Week; Who Is The M.V.P. In the N.B.A?
LEAD: Magic Johnson, without a doubt.
He may not lead the league in scoring, assists or rebounds, but he is the glue that holds the Lakers together.
Jordan will always be there setting records, and Ewing, Malone and Barkley should stick around long enough for another chance.
MATTHEW QUIRK  Rhinebeck, N.Y.

Recalling the Graphics Feast At the 1939 World's Fair
LEAD: To the 50 million people who visited it and the many more who wish they had, the 1939 New York World's Fair was visually a graphics feast, with a dynamic icon - the Trylon and Perisphere.
Stark white and streamlined, the soaring 610-foot-high triangular spire (its name coined to suggest a three-sided pylon) and massive, 180-foot-diameter globe, both sheathed in painted gypsum, dominated the fair when it opened in Flushing Meadows Park in


Hunger Strike in South Africa
LEAD: Seventeen black political detainees have begun a new hunger strike in Diepkloof Prison in Johannesburg, vowing not to eat or drink until they are freed, human rights activists said today.

Too Many Books?
LEAD: To the Editor:

In addition to the offices of the French National Railroads, German Rail and Swiss Federal Railways they are also sold at offices of the Italian State Railways.


1947: THE TEEN AGE BOOK CLUB
LEAD: The Teen Age Book Club was established by Scholastic Inc., publisher of a score of magazines read by schoolchildren.
Junior high school teachers arranged membership in the club for their students, who paid 25 cents a month and received a new paperback book each month.
Some were new books, some were classics; all were illustrated.


Kissinger and Friends And Revolving Doors
LEAD: At a time when Washington is agonizing over how to insure that official responsibilities are adequately separated from private interests, the example of Kissinger Associates Inc. raises particularly thorny questions.


'Television Is Like Having a Stranger In'

Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., on American Playhouse, Wednesday at 9 P.M. on Channel 13.


Dancing And Dining And Dicing
LEAD: They ate, they danced, and most of all they gambled.
At the McGambling Party to benefit the Ronald McDonald House charity, casino chips were on everyone's mind.
Win or lose, the money all went to a good cause, but that didn't stop people from giving roulette, craps or blackjack their best shot.
Winners spent their money at a silent auction.


Correction
LEAD: Because of a computer entry error, the paperback fiction best-seller list on page 40 of The Times Book Review today reverses the ranking of two books. ''The Drawing of the Three,'' by Stephen King (Plume/NAL), should be No. 1. ''Tapestry,'' by Belva Plain (Dell), should be No. 2.


Brian Friel's Ireland: Both Private and Political
LEAD: It was a rainy afternoon in New York, the day's rehearsals had ended, and the Irish dramatist Brian Friel was back in the city where he began his international career with ''Philadelphia, Here I Come!'' more than two decades ago.
He was in town for the belated American premiere of his 1979 play ''Aristocrats,'' which opened Tuesday, and that meant submitting to a journalistic rite - the interview - which he is known to dislike.


Lucio Fontana: Slashing His Way Toward Infinity
LEAD: Precisely four decades have passed since Lucio Fontana decided that a canvas was not simply something to be painted on but also something to be punctured, slashed and appended with stones.
By the mid 1940's Fontana had established a name for himself in his native Argentina and had become known in his adopted homeland of Italy as a sculptor of wildly diverse inclinations, having produced staid academic statues, polychromed figurines, geometric arrangements and what looked most of all like amorphous lumps of mud.


Ms Mills Married To Jeffrey Russell
LEAD: Rosemary Mills, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Gerard Edward Mills of Bergenfield, N.J., was married yesterday to Jeffrey Joseph Russell, a sone of Mr. and Mrs.
Harry A. Russell of Riverdale, the Bronx, and Brookton, Me.

Colorado's Sahara Sands
LEAD: SHORTLY after dawn one day in October I arrived at Great Sand Dunes National Monument in south-central Colorado to watch the sun peel onto the sand.

Its latest restaurant is called Three Sixty Eight, on the corner of Orange and Audubon


Soft-Shell Crabs, Quick and Intriguing, Are Back
LEAD: SPRING has arrived when soft-shell crabs appear in the fish market.

Reviews/Dance; Sensual Applications to Music of the Intellect

Louis Cardinals over the Los Angeles Dodgers, 1-0.


Drawing on the DARK SIDE
LEAD: THE PROSTITUTE SQUATS IN the shadows, her leather-clad haunches poised atop black leather boots.
Her cruel face is encased in a leather mask; in her left hand she clutches a leather whip.
She has come for one purpose: to mete out punishment.
Is this a dominant mistress working the wharves of Hamburg, a character in a porn film, or a Helmut


Education Is the Best Way to Fight Crime
LEAD: To the Editor:


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: At the beginning of some vacation trips, Donna Cosulich throws her wristwatch at the bottom of her duffel bag, to be retrieved only as she prepares to return home.
Her companions generally follow suit, and after the initial shock no one really cares about the time.
That makes a lot of sense when you're at the bottom of the Grand


Everlasting Love: In Pop, Is That All There Is?
LEAD: Judging by the world of the hit song, one could easily assume that Western culture is obsessed with love.
Like some Orwellian prophecy, the music industry machine-tools tune after tune about love found, love lost, love as obsession, love as an afterthought and every conceivable incarnation between.

'The Figure Revisited,' Figural Energy Is Explored
LEAD: THE last time art's magnetic field reversed itself was at the start of the 1980's, when figuration, in the form of Neo-Expressionism, officially replaced abstraction.
Presaged by Pop, the shift reflected its influence and there are signs of this in ''The Figure Revisited'' at the Gallery at Hastings-on

The issue of race is complicating consideration of a plan in which Nashville would merge its white-dominated public hospital into a historically black institution, a step no city has ever taken.
Page 24.

Tension on the far-eastern Soviet-Chinese border has given way, for now, to a bemused vigilance.


Dale Glasser: Graphic Designer
LEAD: Ask Dale Glasser ''What's cooking?'' and you can be sure she'll know.
Not only that, but she'll probably be able to quote you the meal's price as well.


'Picking Up Sand'
LEAD: In Arcadia, Fla., in 1967, the seven children of James Richardson died after eating lunch tainted with insecticide.
Although Mr.
Richardson was working in a citrus grove eight miles away when a baby sitter served lunch, he was convicted and originally sentenced to death.
Last week, a judge assigned to review the case ordered his release, ruling that the 1968 trial was marred by prosecutors' misconduct and perjured testimony.


HOMOSEXUALITY: WHO AND WHY?
LEAD: According to the findings Melvin Konner cites, most cultures of the world accept the inevitability of homosexuality as a naturally occurring human event.
Is it not time, therefore, to investigate why the need to condemn this mode of sexual expression exists to so great an extent?

Crowded Jails Exact Toll On Women
LEAD: FOR years, overcrowding in New Jersey's county jails was a problem only for men.
The few women who went to jail rarely filled the handful of cells designated for them.


Minor White's Quest for Symbolic Significance
LEAD: From the perspective of today's insistently self-conscious and distanced style of art photography, it is difficult to fathom the importance and influence of Minor White.
At the time of his death 13 years ago, he was the leading voice for photography's expressive powers.
A photographer, editor (of the magazine Aperture), teacher and critic whose views were unabashedly psychoanalytic and mystical, he shaped the esthetic climate of postwar photography in much the same way that Alfred

Look Up From the Trenches
LEAD: The tempest over Bonn's call to negotiate with the Soviets on short-range nuclear missiles in Europe should be kept in a teacup.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is a bumbler, which can't be news to anyone, and his natural insensitivity is compounded by his panic at losing votes.
His Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, is pushy, which is politically rewarding in West


On a Treadmill Coining Anagrams
LEAD: THE treadmill may not be the modern equivalent of the medieval rack, but it comes close.
Those of us condemned to its inexorable belt suffer doubly.
Not only do we have to push our fading muscles to their limit, but we're bored out of our wits doing it.
Of the two, I found the boredom more difficult to bear.


Question Of the Week; Who Is The M.V.P. In the N.B.A?
LEAD: Magic Johnson is the most valuable player.

Does the Dow Index Follow Any Logic But Its Own?
LEAD: FRIDAY April 21: The Dow Jones industrial average soars 32 points, capping a week in which stock prices reached their highest level in 18 months.
Computerized ''program trading'' by big investors is credited.
But the market, analysts say, is also responding to the widespread view that interest rates have peaked.


Cop Art
LEAD: IN THE COURSE OF SEEKING out a commission to adorn a county facility in Kenmore, Wash., a few miles north of Seattle, the painter and sculptor Thompson Brennan had what he calls an ''Aha! experience.'' Without a cogent idea for a proposal to submit to the King County Arts Commission, he was visiting the evidence and supply room at the county courthouse, ''and I asked the officer in charge what the police did with confiscated weapons, stuff that they gathered in the course of investigations.

By Es'kia Mphahlele. (Readers International, Paper, $8.95; Cloth, $16.95.) As a herdboy and street urchin, the South African writer Es'kia Mphahlele knew both his country's rich pastoral pleasures and its stark urban blight.
In his new book of short stories, ''Renewal Time,'' Mr.

LEAD: To the Editor:


A Different View on Dining Out
LEAD: The article on Chengdu East said that ''$27 for half a duck and four pancakes seems a little excessive.'' The price, $27, is for a whole duck, not a half duck.
Indeed, it would be too expensive for half a duck at that price.
We at Chengdu East take the review seriously and sincerely and will, with our best effort, improve ourselves as fast as we can.

FASHION: On the Street; Vests Step Out From the Wings
LEAD: Gone are the days when the vest was the wallflower of a three-piece suit, as often as not left home on the hanger while the jacket and trousers went out to party with the boss.

Benefits Law Continues to Vex
LEAD: I would like to point out an inaccuracy in article on Section 89 testing (''Benefits Law Vexes Experts,'' April 9).
We have followed this law from its inception through the Federal Reporter of March 7, 1989, and testing is required only once a year, not twice as reported.
The actual testing date is selected by the employer.


Question Of the Week; Who Is The M.V.P. In the N.B.A?
LEAD: To choose an m.v.p. you have to imagine the team without that player.
The Lakers without Magic would be above .500 because they would still have Scott, Worthy, Cooper, Green, Thompson, and the still formidable Abdul-Jabbar.

LEAD: To the Editor:


CAMPUS LIFE: Dartmouth; Forestry Team, Flexing Muscles, Turns Back Clock

That worked.
Well, sort of.


Prepare for Crisis, It's Part of Business
LEAD: Many critics have faulted Lawrence Rawl, chairman of the Exxon Corporation, for not taking the first jet to Alaska upon hearing about the massive oil spill.
While his public response time was woefully inadequate given the severity of the crisis, those who say Mr.
Rawl should have gone to faraway Valdez just because ''it is the thing to do in these types of crises'' are overly concerned with symbolism and naive about the exigencies of crisis communications and management.


Soft-Shell Crabs, Quick and Intriguing, Are Back

Q and A
LEAD:  John Muir Trail


Jewelry
LEAD: To the Editor: While Susan Heller Anderson's Hong Kong pearl piece (Travel, March 26) was a model of how to shop for jewelry, it obscured some points.
It is nearly impossible to compare strands of pearls, or other pieces of jewelry, if they are not being evaluated side by side.
Her comparison of Falconer's ''pink-hued pearls'' in Hong Kong and New York assumes there is only one shade of pink, and then overlooks the quality of the ''skin'' of the pearls.


HOMOSEXUALITY: WHO AND WHY?
LEAD: Melvin Konner's article, ''Homosexuality: Who and Why?'' (Body and Mind, April 2), should go far toward stimulating informed, rational thinking on the subject.

When Art Becomes a Matter of Life or Death
LEAD: Avner Eisenberg, who is also known as Avner the Eccentric, is balancing a hat on his nose.
The hat is blue, with a wide, shiny black plastic brim, and it is by the edge of its brim that it is standing, motionless, ignorant of gravity, on his fleshy slope.
Mr.
Eisenberg has performed this particular feat quite often, of course, but this time there is something different about it.

'THE TAO IS UP'
LEAD: IF YOU HAVE READ HER BOOKS, HEARING MAXINE Hong Kingston's voice is a surprise.
It is slightly breathless, almost girlish, out of sync with that of the fiercely impudent, unforgiving narrator of ''The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts,'' Kingston's first book, published in 1976.
In this phantasmagoric portrait of an artist growing up female and Chinese-American in Stockton,

Single's Fees
LEAD: To the Editor: I read with interest Betsy Wade's ''Getting Around Fees on Singles'' (Practical Traveler, March 12).
Having toured the world during a 10-year period as a single (widow), I preferred the freedom and privacy of my own quarters, when available.
Being part of a tour has many advantages, but the close proximity to several dozen people every day makes time alone quite worthwhile.


Soft-Shell Crabs, Quick and Intriguing, Are Back

Would she reject me out of hand?
How would I get along with her?

In Films, Heaven's No Paradise
LEAD: Does heaven contain cornfields or poolside cabanas?
Does it resemble a post-modern palazzo, where Degas ballerinas dance in a grand foyer and children play violins while strolling through wide halls?
Or is heaven a more mundane idea entirely, a place where you can eat whatever you want and never get fat?

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. We are planning a one-room addition to our vacation house.
It will have a cathedral ceiling and be exposed on three sides.
The house has 2-by-4 construction with fiberglass insulation, which we don't feel is adequate.
Would we better off building the new walls with 2-by-6's to allow room for more insulation, or should we build with 2-by-4's and use rigid Styrofoam boards for insulation?


Paul Taylor, Choreographer of Contradictions
LEAD: There are four Paul Taylors.
One choreographs dark pieces, another creates light comic works, a third favors homemade rituals and the last seems to invent pure-dance pieces inspired by music.
Great artists being more complex than such convenient reductionism implies, Mr.
Taylor is obviously all of the above and then some.


Counting Food and Water As Extraordinary Support
LEAD: THREE weeks ago, Carrie A. Coons regained consciousness and managed to speak after four and a half months in what doctors had said was an irreversible coma.

The Favorite at Churchill Downs: Derby-Pie
LEAD: DERBY WEEK is the one time of year when sin is sanctioned in Kentucky.
Betting is not only condoned but actually regarded as a patriotic duty, since so much is riding on the Run for the Roses on the first Saturday in May.
Overindulgence also seems socially acceptable in the whirl of energy and excess that marks the week leading up to that over-in-an-instant horse race.


Strength In Adversity For Gonzalez

LEAD: At a time when real estate development is reducing the number of legitimate theaters in Manhattan, a new one will formally open Wednesday in the basement of a new condominium in Union Square.
The 130-seat facility at 108 East 15th Street will be used by the Vineyard Theater, a nonprofit dramatic company, and named the Gertrude and Irving Dimson Theatre.


PASTIMES: Camera
LEAD: One of photography's distinguishing characteristics is its ability to render a wealth of detail.
Some sages have gone so far as to suggest that the descriptive capacity of photography is part of what defines its essence as a form of visual expression.
In any case, pictures taken with cameras can be crisp and clear in a way that no other pictures can be.


JOHN GOTTI: RUNNING THE MOB
LEAD: Some readers, seeing John Gotti featured on the cover of your magazine, might assume that crime does pay - at least in the public relations sense of ''I don't care what you say about me as long as you spell my name correctly.''

LEAD: Dr. and Mrs.

A June wedding is planned.


HUMAN RIGHTS IN GUATEMALA

1966: ''THE LORD OF THE RINGS''
LEAD: J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings,'' a 1,200-page trilogy about a fantasy world in which Good is at war with Evil, made the No. 1 spot on the paperback best-seller list - a remarkable event, because the highly praised saga had originally been published in hard covers a dozen years before, but had not sold notably well.


The Unsung Hero
LEAD: I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED postoperative recovery rooms to be hellish places filled with pain and moans and occasional retching.
Last year, I visited a recovery room that challenged my view: the two dozen occupants - fresh wounds dressed with gauze and surgical drains in place -were sleeping, reading, sipping soda.


A London Enclave of Whole Foods
LEAD: VISITORS to London will never stumble into Neal's Yard; they must look for it tucked away, almost a cul-de-sac in Soho.
But once there, the inclination is to mosey around, taste a little this, investigate a little that and relax in the congenial courtyard.
It might be called an updated 17th-century shopping center.


Corrections
LEAD: An article last Sunday about an exhibition at the Pelham Art Center misstated the closing date.
The show, ''Selected Images: 150 Years of American History by American Photographers,'' continues through May 27, not May 1.


In Christie Whodunit, Red Herrings Abound
LEAD: AGATHA CHRISTIE's ''Go Back for Murder,'' which deals with family values and filial devotion, has a lot to recommend it.
It is a classic whodunit filled with red herrings.
It has a subplot of romantic love.
And it is receiving a strong production at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale, where it will remain through

'We Are Doomed to Be Successful'
LEAD: After nearly four years, perestroika has failed to produce tangible economic results in the Soviet Union.

As a result, many Soviet political leaders are desperately seeking new ideas - and Nikolai P.


Acoustics Are The Treasure In Bank's Hall
LEAD: Craig Dory and Brian Levine have opened a joint account, so to speak, at the Troy Savings Bank in upstate New York, but not at a teller's window.
They are doing business as Dorian Recordings, in the acoustically celebrated concert hall atop the bank.

Comedies With a Dash of Menace
LEAD: A self-deprecator by nature - ''I'm a tall, thin, funny-looking lady, a ridiculous person'' - Tina Howe is trying hard not to tempt the fates by getting overexcited.

The Advantages of Plastic Pipe
LEAD: PLASTIC plumbing pipe is ideal for amateurs to use because it is easy to work with and requires no special skills or tools.


Diplomatic 'Walk in Woods'
LEAD: IN its most cosmically conscious season yet, how fitting for the Whole Theater to choose ''A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing.
This is the play about a Russian (who says he's a diplomat) and an American (who calls himself a negotiator), sitting around and talking about saving the world - or at least forging ''a path to sanity.


Puzzles And Possibilities
LEAD: THE steps are the sort that should take you to the front door of an older house in the city.

ARCHITECTURE VIEW
LEAD: This month construction is to begin on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which will occupy a 1.7-acre site adjacent to the Mall, within view of the Washington Monument and looking across the Tidal Basin to the Jefferson Memorial.
It is a prominent site for a museum that will mark an event that is remembered not for its glory, like most other things commemorated on the Mall, but for its horror.


Pentagon Fights for Budget Cut (Yes)
LEAD: THE Pentagon-approved plan to cut military spending by closing down and consolidating scores of military bases is moving ahead fitfully, against the opposition of some Congressmen who don't want their states to lose income and jobs.


Laurels
LEAD: To the Editor:


A Sense of Direction
LEAD: WHEN I WAS growing up in England, one of the first things my father taught my brother and me was how to read a map.

Last call to have power equipment serviced.
Last call to apply pre-emergent herbicides to lawns and service areas to control weed growth, especially crabgrass.


Review/Opera; 'Jane Heir,' Italianate Bronte
LEAD: Everybody has defects, and one of mine is that I have never managed to read any novel by Charlotte Bronte.
Accordingly, I anticipated visiting ''Jane Heir,'' presented by the Mesopotamian Opera on Friday night at Performance Space 122 (First Avenue and Ninth Street), in the position of someone who attempts to appreciate Donizetti's ''Lucia'' without having read ''The Bride of Lammermoor,'' or ''Nabucco,'' ''Messiah'' and ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' without having read the

CRIME
LEAD: A fresh, crisply accented voice comes blowing out of Kansas City in HOT WIRE (Bantam, Paper, $3.50).
In this breezy debut by Randy Russell, a petty car thief with the wonderful moniker of Alton Benjamin (Rooster) Franklin graduates to the big time by knocking off a bank.
The heist is nice; but things go haywire when the loot is lost and Rooster's accomplice gets killed.


Russian Revolutions
LEAD: In 1917, the Communist Party made a revolution in Russia that shook the world.

Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Greenwich Village.


Shanley's Comedy Plays With Weighty Themes
LEAD: IT isn't every theater that has the grace and the guts to pick a play as sublimely ridiculous as ''Italian American Reconciliation'' by John Patrick Shanley.
Give the Boston Post Road Stage Company points for that.
